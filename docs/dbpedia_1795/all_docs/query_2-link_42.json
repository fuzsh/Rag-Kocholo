Box 1346 Ann Arbor, Ml 48106-1346 Abstract The Arjan Tomb: at the Crossroads of the Elamite and the Persian Empires by Javier Alvarez-Mon Doctor of Philosophy in Near Eastern Studies University of California, Berkeley Professor David Stronach, Chair This dissertation is based on a study of the archaeological evidence that derives from the Arjan tomb, a partly stone-walled elite burial found in 1982 in the vicinity of the ancient city of Arrajan, near the modern town of Behbahan in the Khuzestan Province of Iran. In 2003, under the auspices of a Fulbright-Hays Scholarship, the present writer had the opportunity to access the excavated materials recovered from this rich tomb. Previous studies of the Arjan tomb and its associated funerary goods placed the date of the material in question between the 7 th and the early 6 th centuries BC. This is a period traditionally associated with the last days of the Elamite Empire and the emergence for the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Scholars focusing on Elamite-Persian emergence emphasize the survival of Elamite traditions, sometimes going as far as to suggest that the Persian Empire could not have arisen without the prior existence of the Elamite kingdom. Not withstanding the force with which such claims were sometimes made, the material evidence to support them was generally lacking prior to 1982. It is within this framework that the fortuitous discovery of the Arjan tomb emerges as potentially one of the major archaeological discoveries of recent times. The fact that this burial can be confidendy dated to the last part of the 7 th century BC, or to the last years of the Elamite Empire, presents an exceptional opportunity to reassess and substantiate former views and to articulate new ones. Based on the evidence provided by the Arjan tomb and its exceptional grave goods, the present study offers a comprehensive new analysis of the artistic characteristics of late Neo-Elamite Empire, and, by the same token, it seeks to provide a new foundation for the genesis of the art of the Achaemenid Persian world.

INTRODUCTION AND GOALS In 1981-82 in Arjan, located north of Behbahan in Khuzestan Province in Iran, a bulldozer leveling the ground for the construction of a dam on the Marun River cut through a stone-walled tomb located on top of one of the higher hills on the left bank of the river. 1 Archaeologists F. Towhidi and A. Khalilian, from the Office of Historical Remains, arrived at the location where, in the presence of the local authorities, they proceeded to uncover a rectangular underground tomb chamber and to remove its contents. According to archaeologist F. Towhidi, there were no architectural remains in the vicinity of the tomb. No further survey or excavation was undertaken outside the confines of the tomb itself (Towhidi and Khalilian 1982: 233). 2 The removal of the contents of the tomb was undertaken in the presence of local religious and secular authorities from Behbahan. All the objects were packed and transferred to the National Museum of Iran. A summary report on the finds was published in 1982 (Towhidi and Khalilian 1982) with a more detailed publication in English appearing in 1985 (Alizadeh 1985). Further publications of specific individual materials found in the Arjan tomb have dealt with the textiles (Mo'taqed 1990), the Arjan bowl (Sarraf 1990, Majidzadeh 1990, Stronach 2003c, 2004a, 2004b, and Alvarez-Mon 2004), aspects of the Arjan beaker (Sarraf 1990), and the Arjan ring (Sarraf 1996, Stronach 2000). 1 The driver noticed the cavity. He went inside and faced an underground chamber with a metal coffin inside. The authorities were then alerted. According to the original report by F. Towhidi and A. Khalilian, the bulldozer destroyed two large pottery jars lying on the surface of the burial. This surface also included burnt soil (Towhidi and Khalilian 1982: 233). One of the surface pots may have survived (see section dedicated to the objects found outside the grave). 2 I am most grateful to Mr. Towhidi for clarifying various aspects regarding the excavation of the Arjan tomb and its original setting. 2 In 2003, under the auspices of a Fulbright-Hays Scholarship and working closely with the authorities of the National Museum of Iran as well as with the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization (ICHO) and the provincial authorities of Khuzistan, the present writer was able to create a digital record of all the principal objects froun in the tomb. In addition, I had the opportunity to access all the material recovered from the Arjan tomb, including the bathtub coffin. After closely inspecting and digitally recording all the objects it became apparent to me that most of the material was stylistically closely related and that a publication presenting the total corpus of objects was required in order to understand the exceptional importance of the find. The author is most grateful to the help and warm hospitality of Mohammad Reza Kargar, Director of the National Museum of Iran; Shahrook Razamjou, Director of the Center for Achaemenid Studies; Zahra Jafarmohammadi, Head Curator at the National Museum of Iran; Mohammed H. Talebian, director of the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization at Haft Tappeh, Tchogha Zanbil and Persepolis; Peter Morgan, Director of the British Institute for Persian Studies; and Remi Boucharlat, Director of the IFRI (Institut Francais de la Recherche en Iran). Previous studies of the Arjan tomb and funerary related goods have placed the manufacture of this material between the 7 th and early 6 th centuries BC. This time- period is considered to fall within the broad Neo-Elamite II-III periods (743-539 BC). Traditionally, our knowledge of the Neo-Elamite period (ca. 1000-539 BC) has depended on the sequence of Elamite political history presented by the Assyrian royal inscriptions and the Babylonian chronicles (Streck 1916: 358-348; Cameron 1936: 155- 169; Hinz 1972: 138-161; Stolper 1984a: 44-56; Miroschedjil990: 47-95; Boucharlat 1994: 220; Potts 1999: 259-309; Waters 2000; and Henkelman 2000, 2002). Due to the 3 In addition, and on the basis of the relative concordance of the three individuals named Kurlus, F. Vallat has suggested they might be one and the same person. Accordingly, Parsirra and Kidin-Hutran would have been brothers. In defense of a higher chronology for the Arjan material, A. Alizadeh has stressed the absence of sufficient data on the development of the Elamite language during the first centuries of the first millennium BC, holding that the inscription may possibly be earlier than the date suggested by Vallat, i.e. earlier than 650 BC (Alizadeh 1985: 56). 31 Artistic analysis of the materials and the tomb found at Arjan have placed the finds variously from the second half of the 8 th century to the first quarter of the 6 th century (Towhidi and Khalilian 1982: 232-28, Alizadeh 1985, Majidzadeh 1990, Stronach 2000, 2003c, 2004); Although there is increasing consensus in narrowing this chronology to the 7 th or the beginning of the 6 th centuries BC (Boehmer 1989: 142-143, Carter 1994: 65-77, Stronach 2000). In the past few years a significant reassessment of the sources together with the incorporation of new textual and archaeological evidence has prompted an alternative view of the Neo-Elamite period that, though still very much dependent on foreign sources, seeks to critically integrate them into the emergent historical context (Miroschedji 1990; Vallat 1996b, Potts 1999: 259-307; Henkelman 2000, 2003). The period is divided into three or two parts, according to whether one follows textual or archaeological evidence. In both cases, the earliest part of the period (c. 1000-c. 743 31 Our knowledge of Neo-Elamite vocabulary, grammar, and syntax remains imperfect; thus the translation and interpretation of many texts are uncertain. As a rule, moreover, Neo-Elamite texts provide little internal information regarding their date. Neo- Elamite paleographic and stylistic features \"do not prove consistent even within the same inscription and it is difficult to establish accurate dates for these inscriptions on such criteria\" (Henkelman 2000: 2). 15 BC) remains practically unknown. 32 The archaeological division championed by Pierre de Mkoschedji proposes a bipartite division with a transition from Neo-Elamite I to the Neo-Elamite II, at about 725/700 BC (de Mkoschedji 1981, 1982; Carter and Stolper 1984: 182; Carter 1994). Significantly, de Mkoschedji stresses the archaeological continuity in the material record of the Neo-Elamite II and Neo- Elamite III periods, notwithstanding the supposed instability of central government or the severe destruction of 647-646 BC claimed by Assurbanipal (de Mkoschedji 1981: 36-40; Reade 2000). E. Carter however does indicate a \"less smooth transition than that reconstructed by Mkoschedji\" as attested by changes in the ceramic record (Carter 1994: 73). The tripartite chronological division of the period proposed by textual sources heavily relies on the Assyro-Babylonian sources for an understanding of the Neo-Elamite II period (770/743-653/646). This period usually refers to the time of close Assyro-Elamite-Babylonian relationships. The year 653 BC marks the installation by Assurbanipal of Huban-nikas II as 'king of Elam' and Tammaritu I as 'king of Hidalu.' This date is taken as the end date of an independent centralized Elamite kingdom and therefore marks the end of the Neo-Elamite II period. Some divergence arises regarding the validity of this approach. W. Henkelman indicates that 653 BC \"does not, imply a kind of co-regency or a breaking apart of Elam into several kingdoms\" (Henkelman 2002: 4). F. Vallat and D. Potts prefer to extend the ending date of the Neo-Elamite II period to the sacking of Susa in 647-646 BC (Vallat 1996: 385; Potts 1999: 260; Reade 2000). Finally, the Neo-Elamite III period (653/646 - 32 Textually, there is no attestation of an Elamite king before Huban-nikas I (743-717). The date of this king's reign is taken as the transition between the Neo-Elamite I and the Neo- Elamite II periods. But, as pointed out by Henkelman, \"an Elamite king could hardly have been mentioned anywhere, as the first datable entry in the Assyrian Chronicle I is 745 BC\" (Henkelman 2002: 4). 16 c.539 BC) ends with a relative date corresponding to the hypothetical conquest of Elam by Cyrus II, the Great (c. 559-530). The Neo-Elamite III period is itself divided into two phases: the Neo-Elamite IIIA (c. 653/647-605/585 B.C.), and Neo-Elamite IIIB (605/585-539 B.C.) periods (Potts 1999: 295-301). Table I.

Studies of funerary practices in general, and in the ancient Near East in particular, have established correlations between the way individuals are buried and their social context, including their social identity. 34 Further, if we follow the positivist approach of Binford, the specific characteristics of a burial, such as (1) type of burial, (2) preparation and disposition of the deceased's body, and (3) nature of the funerary goods, can be used to identify the level of social complexity that was involved (Binford 1972: 235; see also Tainter 1977: 322 in Forest 1983: 11; and Pearson 1999: 31). Thus, theoretically, social organization is manifested in a burial through indicators of collective input. That is, the higher the rank of an individual, the more impressive the evidence for collective mobilization would be. In addition, an intact burial presents a narrative of the ritual, funerary, and religious beliefs espoused by the community (Pearson 1999: 71). This second, perhaps more speculative, assertion calls for the reconstruction of religious beliefs from the material evidence present in the burial. Certain particular characteristics, such as the burial's orientation, its location in respect to the other burials and the living quarters of the community, the position of the deceased, or the type of burial goods, are not random, but are clues to the spiritual 34 For general studies see Champman, Kinnes, and Randsborg (1981) and Pearson (1999); for the ancient Near East in particular see 'Grab' in the RIA; for Mesopotamian burial practices in general see Campbell and Green (1995) and Forest (1983). 19 beliefs held by the community at large (Forest 1983: 12-13). In this respect, the burial may be seen as a provisional second home imbued with symbolic characteristics that can eventually be decoded (Pearson 1999: 3-11). Conversely, some elements of the symbolic language may be beyond our reach since they are no longer observable, not least because perishable materials such as wood, basketry work, or textiles, are rarely preserved. Apart from material remains, any interpretation of funerary beliefs and practices must also take account of textual documentation. The general outline of Mesopotamian funerary religious beliefs and related temple rituals compiled from a multitude of literary and administrative texts indicates that the social status of the deceased was supposed to be replicated in the underworld and that certain funerary goods may have be intended as gifts to the gods of the underworld. 35 A number of Elamite texts from the end of the Sukkalmah (c. 1 5000 BC) period found in a funerary context in the Apadana mound contain invaluable information regarding Elamite eschatological beliefs. In particular, the presence of concepts such as a final weighting and judgment of the deceased set these tablets apart in such a way that they stand \"without parallel in all the literature of ancient Mesopotamia\" (Bottero 1982: 394, Scheil 1916) , 36 These documents refer to Inshushinak as the god of the underground and as the judge in charge of fixing the destiny of the dead (Steve 1987: text 25, n. 35 Beyond this general statement, the possibility that a systematic presentation of 'Mesopotamian religion' could be written seems to be beyond reach. The reasons given are most compelling: the limitation of available evidence, and the \"problem of comprehension across the barriers of conceptual conditioning\" (see Oppenheim 1977: 172). 36 M. -J. Steve and H.Gasche place the funerary cave where this particular tablet was found at the end of the Sukkalmah period (Ville Royale XII, ca. 1500 BC); Linguistically, the script in the tablet is situated between the period of the Babylonian king Ammi-saduqa (1646 BC) and the end of the Sukkalmah period (Stolper and Carter 1984: 31; Steve and Gasche 1996: 333). 20 157). 37 Middle Ekmite inscriptions from the royal tomb at Haft Tappeh stipulate the amount of food (flour, beer, sheep) assigned to the six guards in charge of maintaining and repairing the installations of a building and of performing various rituals and funerary offerings related to the deceased Elamite king, Tepti-Ahar (Reiner 1973). Neo-Elamite funerary practices as evidenced by funerary archaeological remains indicate the belief in some sort of existence after death. 38 This belief entails the metaphysical journey of the deceased to the underworld 39 and the ensuing judgment by the Annunaki gods. One of the duties of the living was to make periodic funerary offerings of food, drink and oil to deceased relatives. This understanding of death seems to follow longstanding beliefs developed in Mesopotamia throughout millennia (see Black and Green 1992: 27). Given however the fact that our information comes from limited samples of texts and from one specific location we have to be cautious about presuming that similar beliefs applied throughout Elam. Nevertheless, such funerary textsas we have from Elam do suggest that comparable attitudes towards death and the netherworld were shared, in the main, by the populations of Elam and Mesopotamia (see Scheil 1916; Vallat 1989: 46-47; Koch 1995). The possibility that the Arjan burial can further our knowledge of late Neo- Elamite funerary practices in a truly substantial way is limited by the fact that the burial is, so far, one of a kind and that no excavations in the general vicinity of the tomb have been inititated. 37 Steve considers Inshushinak to be a counterpart to the Mesopotamian Nergal. Both happen to be the protectors of vegetation and the flock (Steve 1987: text 25, note 157). 38 See Vallat 1989. In Mesopotamia, the words gidim / etemmu may refer to the person's spirit living in the underworld. Once a person dies, the last breath of one's life, the etemmu I gidim, becomes breeze and leaves for the underworld. The gidim however also has the potential to go back to persecute the living (see Black and Green 1992: 88) . 39 This journey has been best described by literary texts such as the Gilgamesh Epic or the Descent of Ishtar (see Dalley 1989 and Leick 1991). 21 THE IDENTITY OF ARJAN The Arjan tomb was found fortuitously in the fall of 1982 by the driver of a bulldozer who was leveling ground prior to the construction of the Marun (I) dam. 40 The Arjan burial lies close to the left bank of the Marun river, about 12 km to the north of the modem city of Behbahan, in the border region between the Khuzestan and Fars provinces of Iran [plates 1, 2]. This region was one of the main gateways linking the Iranian highlands and Mesopotamia. Today two roads lead westwards across Khuzestan, one in the south via Ahwaz, the other in the north via Ram-Hormuz and Susa. Mahruban, the Persian Gulf port for Arrajan during the classical Islamic period (7 th to 11 th centuries AD), was a two-day journey away via RIshahr. 41 The Behbahan plain, which is about 30 m above sea level, is separated from the central plain by an extension of the Zagros mountains reaching to the south. About 5 km north of Arjan the Zagros piedmont rises sharply to 900 m. The nearby mountains reach heights of more than 3,500 m and are capped with snow throughout the year. In addition, the river Marun cuts deeply into the plain, creating a natural boundary during the time of the spring and summer floods. The burial itself was found in the foothill located north of the ancient city of Arrajan [see plate 3]. The observable remains of this city stand 8 km northeast of Behbahan in an area known as Argun, near the southern bank of the Marun river 40 The construction of the Marun I dam was completed in 1992. The height of the dam is 203 meters (bedrock to crest) and the length of the dam crest is 340 meters (Emami et. al. 2003). 41 There are ruins of a port-town about 17 km north of Bandar Daylam. To my knowledge, this area has not been surveyed so it is unknown whether there are Elamite remains apart from those associated with the port of Busher-Liyan. 22 (which is to be identified with the Medieval Tab but also was known as in medieval times as the Jarahiyah or Jarahi river and the Kordestan river). According to Arab geographers, the river Marun has its source in the mountains south-west of Isfahan, at Al-Buurj, and reached the Persian Gulf to the west of Mahruban (le Strange 1905: 270). 42 The site of the ancient medieval city of Arrajan covers an area of c. 1.5 X 2.5 k, and its vicinity is known by its Sassanian as well as its Islamic remains. 43 11.1. Historical Identity The ancient town of Arrajan was an important agricultural and commercial emporium during both the Sassanian and the Medieval periods. Medieval sources give alternative names for Arrajan, all of which contain the common component Qobad/Kavad (Ram-Qobad, Beram-Qobad, Abar-Qobad and Beh az Ahmed-e Kavad) which points to the Sassanian king Kavad I (484, 488-487 and 499-531 A.D.) who is said to have been the city's founder (Gaube 1973, 1986: 519). The city flourished after the Islamic conquest and became one of the centers of regional trade (well known for its linen production, soap, grape-syrup, date-gardens and olive oil). In 1085 A.D. the town was devastated by an earthquake 44 giving rise to the foundation of the present day regional center of Behbahan. 45 42 West of Behbehan, in the Zeytun region, was an ancient tomb known as the Zahede-Soujte. It was located next to a natural crevice in the rock from which sulphurous exhalations emanate, lightening the area during the night (Demorgny 1913: 109). 43 In a hill near Arjan was a cave from which bitumen was taken. It was celebrated for its medicinal properties. In the town of Arrajan itself there was a well called the Bir Shahik whose water was said to never be exhausted (Le Strange 1905: 269). 44 Other accounts ascribe the destruction of the town to IsmaHIs or Assassins (Bosworth 1984: 165 n. 93). 45 To the south of Arjan stands a prominent wall enclosing a square approximately 300 by 600 m. To the north, parts of a bridge across the Kordestan river have survived. Close above the head of the bridge, on top of a high conglomerate terrace where the Imamzada Reza 23 According to Aurel Stein, who traveled in the region during the years 1932—36, the area were Arjan is situated was a major center in ancient times. \"The town of Behbehan, [is situated in a wide plain of fertile alluvial soil, but scantily populated. . . . It is possible that the old road continued through the ancient site of Arrajan, which preceded Behbehan as a local center and emporium of trade down to medieval times. . . .\" (Stein 1940: 82). The 10th-century Arabic geographers Muqaddasi and Ibn Hauqal described the Behbehan region as \"the storehouse for Persia and Mesopotamia ... an extremely pleasant city, rich in water, cereals, dates, grapes, olives, oil, lemons, and nuts. Summer and winter fruits are here harvested.\" (Stein 1940: 82). II. 2. Archaeological Surveys Despite the considerable political and economic importance attached to Behbehan and its region during the Sassanian and classical Islamic periods archaeological surveys of the region have failed to discover any evidence of settlement belonging to the Neo-Elamite period (Nissen 1988: 275; see also Nissen and Redman 1971; Nissen 1976; Zagarell 1978: 119; and Carter 1984: 75). 46 According to archaeologist F. Towhidi, the presence of the Arjan burial near the west bank of the shrine lies and, separated from Argun by a tract of land, lie the ruins of a pre-Islamic setdement. To the south there are remains of a Sassanian bridge and dam structure. Near the bridge, and above the southern bank of the river, can be found the remains of a casde. Other medieval pre-Islamic towns mentioned in the accounts of the Arab conquest (639-644 A.D.) are Jannaba (ruins near the present Bandar-e Ganava on the Gulf), Rishar (pre-Islamic Rev- Ardashlr, ruins about 25 km southeast of Arjan on the northern bank of the Hendljan river) and SIniz (some 23 km southeast of Bandar-e Ganava). Important Phartian rock releifs are also located 44 km to the north of Arrajan, in the Ting-e Sarvak valley (Vanden Berghe 1983: 28- 32). For further information see Gaube's seminal study of the region (1986: 520). 46 Donnald McCown, who excavated at Tal-e Ghazir (Ram Hormuz) also surveyed the area around Behbehan during the 1950's (Carter 1994: 68). I have been unsuccessful at finding any records of these surveys. 24 river indicates that we should look under the Sassanian and Islamic remains for any traces of an Elamite occupation. 47 In 1812 Kinneir and his surveyor, Monteith, passed next to the ruins of Aragian on their way to Shiraz from Shustar (Kinneir 1813: 72). According to de Bode: \"Half way between Behbehan and the river Kurdistan [Marun], are ruins over a considerable extent of ground [Arrejan]. These remains consist of kiln-burnt bricks, white mortar, and more or less elevated artificial mounds of earth. It was among them, I believe, that Sir John Macdonald Kinnier found a stone slab, with an arrow-headed inscription — a sure sign of remote antiquity\" (De Bode 1845: 295-296). Unfortunately, the stone slab with the cuneiform inscription refered by De Bode is not mentioned by Kinneir in his Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire. When H. J. Nissen surveyed parts of the Behbehan plain in 1970 he was aware that the region represented \"the geographically easiest and best connection between the middle and lower plains of Khuzestan and the Marv Dashtt plain of Fars\" (Nissen 1976; 1988: 275; Nissen and Redman 1971). The results of the 1970 Nissen survey were confined to the plain within about 7 km of Behbehan itself. 48 The report mentions 59 sites ranging from the prehistoric times to the Islamic period but lacking any Elamite evidence (Nissen and Redman 1971: 48). Of these sites, 43 were inhabited in the Islamic period only; 9 Islamic sites were founded on earlier occupations; and only 4 locations showed evidence of prehistoric settlement dating to the 5 th and 4 th millennia, relating the area to both Susiana and Tall-i Bakun III, in Fars (Nissen 47 Pers. comm. 48 I have been unable to clarify if these surveys reached the Arjan archaeological remains. 25 1976). 49 The relative location of prehistoric sites such as Tepe Sohz and the surviving pattern of irrigation channels indicate that water from the river was brought to the plain by means of a pardy open, pardy tunneled canal which branches off the river higher up in the gorge (Nissen 1976: 277). The setdement pattern in the Behbehan plain can be thought of as a number of straight connected lines, which would seem to imply irrigation. Yet, as Zagarell points out, this pattern may be explained by positing that the center of the plain was often flooded and that the settlements had to be established around the flooded area (Zagarell 1978: 174). 50 North of Behbehan, preliminary surveys of Iron Age remains from the Middle Zagros territories of the Lurdagan, Khana Mirza, Chigha Khor and Shahr-e Kord plains are said to reveal ceramic parallels with Posht-e Kuh Luristan (Zagarell 1982, 1983). In sum, the archaeological evidence from the general area where the Arjan burial was found is broadly characterized by Sassanian and Islamic constructions. Except for the Neo-Elamite burial at Arjan, no other Elamite remains have surfaced so far. On the other hand, it appears that the surveys that have taken place to date have not examined the entire area occupied by the extensive Arrajan ruins and its surrounding area. II. 3 Arjan and Hidalu Based on the information provided by the Assyrian sources, three main urban centers existed in Elam during the neo-Elamite period: Madaktu, Susa and Hidalu. 49 South of the river Marun 37 sites were recorded; and opf these, 26 were inhabited in Islamic times alone period. 50 Two Sialk III type sherds recovered from the Behbehan region indicate that contacts with the central plateau existed at least since the Godin Tepe V. Setdements become more numerous in the Bakun (lie) B and A 1-4 periods (Zagarell 1978: 173). 26 Although many places have been proposed, the location of the cities of Madaktu and Hidalu remains uncertain. 51 A number of locations have been proposed for Hidalu, which appeared as Ha-i-da-la in the annals of Sennacherib and as Hi-da-li / I-da-li, in documents from Susa (Hinz 1975: 391). W. Hinz privileged the modern town of Behbehan as the location of ancient Hidalu. G. Cameron located Hidali somewhere along the Karun River (Cameron 1936: 165). J. Hansman places the \"mountains of Hidalu\" north-east of Behbehan (Hansman 1974: 108, n. 54). Duchesne identifies Huhnur/unar/Unar with Arjan/Arrajan, which he believes to be covered by the modern ruins of Behbehan, and places Hidalu in the area of Kuhgiluya, east and north of the Behbehan plain (Duchesne 1986: 66). 52 Finally, D. T. Potts, following de Miroschedji, places Hidalu between Behbehan and Ram Hormuz (Potts 1999: 272; 2005). Lack of textual and archaeological precision reveals this matter to be inconclusive (Potts 2005: 175) and calls for further surveys of the Behbehan region (Stronach 1999); while E. Carter recommends an examination of the pottery that is to be found on the ancient site of Arrajan (Carter 1994: 72). The above suggestions rely on the interpretation of Assyrian , Elamite and Persian written sources for the location of Hidalu (see Vallat 1993: 96 and Stolper 2005 for references). The Assyrian sources refer to the seat of an Elamite kingdom since at least the beginning of the 7 th century BC, located fa kirib fade ruqM, in the far away 51 Madaktu has been identified by P. de Miroschedji as Tepe Patak (Miroschedji 1986: 215). Tepe Patak, is a major archaeological site situated on the modern route between Andimeshk and Deh Luran. It is about 250 m. wide and 13m high, with a total surface of about 6 hectares. The identification of Madaktu with Tepe Patak (Rawlinson , de Mecquenem, de Miroschedji, Potts 1999b; 20, n. 31) has been questioned by Cordoba (Cordoba 1997) and challenged by Potts and others (Potts 1999b: 13, n. 3 and 22; Potts 1999: 272; Potts 2005). According to Potts, the site must lie north of Susa, between the Karkheh (Ulaya/Eulaios) and the Dez (Idide/Coprates) rivers. A more precise location depends on further research (Potts 1999a: 25). 52 See Potts 2005 for a full discussion. 27 mountains. In addition, the Assyrian sources indicate that Hidalu (with the variants Haidala, Hidali, Hdda/u), was close to the city of Huhnur/Hunar/Unar.\" As the Assyrian armies began to raid deep into western Elam, Hidalu became a refuge of the Elamite kings and it possibly also became the true political center of Elam at this time. So far is known, Hidalu never suffered direct Assyrian assault, even if Assyrian troops reached the border of the city. The political status of 7 th century Hidalu also appears to have been closely associated with that of Madaktu and Susa. This situation seems to have continued during the first part of the 6 th century BC, as indicated by four administrative documents found at Susa. 54 These consist of receipts for transactions made at Hidalu but issued on the authorization of an official based at Susa (Scheil 1907). 55 These tablets add little to our information regarding the specific location of Hidalu. Yet, they attest to the presence at Hidalu of a textile center participating in a trade network associated with Susa. The Persepolis Fortification Tablets (dated to between 504 and 494 BC) include further detail as to the location of Hidalu. Inter alia, 53 Letter ABL 1311 is from Assurbanipal's reign and refers to Hunnuru (Hunnir or Hunnar) \"at the border of Hidalu.\" The letter provides evidence for a route between Parsumas and Bit-Bunakki. The route described went: Parsumas-Hidalu-Hunnuru-Bubilu-Madaktu-[...- kja/ /Jak-Bit-Bnnzkki. According to Fuchs and Parpola, the stretch between Hidalu and Madaktu would roughly correspond to \"one of the roads nowadays connecting Behbehan with Dezful\" (Fuchs and Parpola 2001: 33-34). 54 The general date of these documents may lie in the first half of the 6 th century BC with a more precise date around 580 BC provided by Vallat (1998: 311) or around 570 BC provided by Tavernier (2004: 32). 55 All texts after Scheil (1907): [Tablet 37, rev.4], Fragmentary tablet mentioning an inhabitant of Hidalu (Idakra); [Tablet 65], 1 mine and 20 siecles of red color (harkaman) where used (for dying?) at Hidalu, registered by the official Kuddakaka, dated Aiar month (April/May); [Tablet 69], Fragmentary tablet, a number of objects registered by the official Kuddakaka and supplied at Hidalu by Huban Nugash, son of Huban Ukra, dated Kisilimu month (Nov/Dec); [Tablet 238], Fragmentary tablet, an individual with an Iranian name?

Ration to be issued at Hidali Accounts (Hallock's category W) 1994 Hidalu 203 (20* year) provisions provided According to the evidence of the Persepolis tablets, during the late 6 th and early 5 th century BC the town of Hidali accommodated substantial administrative facilities and storage units (such as were used to house large quantities of grain). The information provided by tablets 1400, 1402-1406 indicates that the town of Hidali was located between Susa and Persepolis and enjoyed close relations with, and perhaps stood in the vicinity of, the towns of Dasher and Kesat (above documents PFT 35, 1851, and 2057). These two towns, Kesat and Dasher, provide important points of reference for the relative location of Hidalu. In tablet 2057 three men make their way from Dasher to Hidalu. Dasher is identified by H. Koch as the 18 th stop in the Persepolis-Susa highway, situated between Zila-Humban and Shurkutir, which is 32 modern-day Masjid Soleiman (Koch 1986 and 1990: 200-202). 56 In tablet PFT 35 grain is taken from the storehouse of Hidalu to Kesat while in tablet PFT 1852 grain from Kesat is to be dispersed at Hidalu. Thus Kesat/ Gisat appears to be located on the boundary between Elam and Persia (H. Koch 1990: 213-216). 57 In addition, five texts mentioning Hidalu and Kesat share the presence of two seals suggesting that the same individuals may have been involved in these transactions and, consequently, that both locations may have been administratively related (seals 20 and 53 on tablets 35, 352, 550, 1850, 1851). 58 In sum, according to the foregoing textual evidence, the (royal) town of Hidalu, an urban center of Elamite power during the 7 th century BC, 59 was actively participating in a commercial network administrated by Susa during the first half of the 6 th century BC and remained an important center of trade and communications during the Achaemenid period (ca. 500 BC). Unfortunately, the texts fail to provide a specific location for Hidalu but only give an approximate sense of its position in relation to two other towns, Kesat/ Gisat and Dasher. At all events, the distinction of the Arjan tomb and the adjacent Sassanian settiement can be said to underline the importance of the Behbehan region as an enduring candidate for the location of one of these towns. Finally, D.T. Potts has sounded a skeptical note regarding the hypothetical and inconclusive nature of this research (Potts 2005: 175). In fact, substantial new lignt on 56 For a critical review of Koch's reconstruction of the 21 staging posts between Susa and Persepolis see Tuplin 1998. 57 Kesat is mentioned in six other Persepolis Fortification Tablets (352, 534, 550, 1849, 1850, and 1996) and in the Ururu plaque from Persepolis. 58 One of these two seals may have belonged to Mannuwish, who oversaw a grain deposit at Kesat during the years 21-26 (501/500-496/495 BC; (Garrison and Root 2003: 229). 59 An interesting letter written in Hidalu by the Assyrian official Bel-epus, points to the presence of a group of Babylonians in Hidalu during the time of king Tammaritu (653 BC; Leichty 1983). 33 this topic is most likely to come from detailed archaeological surveys throughout the region, combined, af at all possible, with selected soundings in the most promising localities. 34 THE ARJAN BURIAL CHAMBER II.4. Excavation of the Burial Chamber In 1982 a bulldozer leveling the ground for the construction of a dam on the Marun river cut through part of a stone-built tomb located on the left bank of the river [see plate 4]. 60 Archaeologists F. Towhidi and A. Khalilian, from the Iranian Office of Historical Remains, were sent to Arjan where, in the presence of the local authorities, proceeded to reveal a rectangular underground tomb chamber and to remove its contents. According to F. Towhidi, there were no architectural remains around the tomb. No further survey or excavation was undertaken of remains adjacent to the tomb (Towhidi and Khalilian 1982: 233). 61 The cleaning of the contents of the tomb was done in presence of the religious and civil authorities from Behbahan 152 and all the objects were packed and transferred to the National Museum of Iran. 63 60 The driver noticed a cavity. He went inside and faced an underground chamber with a metal coffin inside. The authorities were then alerted. According to the original report by F. Towhidi and A. Khalilian, the bulldozer destroyed two large pottery jars lying on the surface of the burial. This surface also included burnt soil (Tohidi and Khalilian 1982: 233). One of the surface pots may have survived (see section dedicated to the objects found outside the grave). 61 I am most grateful to the kindness of Mr. Towhidi for clarifying various aspects regarding the excavation of the Arjan tomb and its original setting. 62 In addition to archaeologists F. Towhidi and A. Khlilian, the other individuals involved were: the governor Mr Jameh Darpour; Mr Dehghan of the Republican Guard Authorities; Mr. Naji Aleshaagh and Mr Torkazad, engineers with the water and electricity organization; The manager of the Islamic General Guidance Office in Khozestan and Behbahan; Mr. Naser Turkey Habib Abadi who is an Archaeologist; and the photographers of the Historical Athar Office Mr. Malik Araghi, Ali Abadi Hasas and Harndehi (Towhidi and Khalilian 1982). 6i Since the discovery of the Arjan tomb a number Iranian scholars such as Mr. Ehsan Yaghmayi have attempted further examination of the Arjan tomb and vicinity but the information remains rather vague and, so far, none of this survey or excavations (?) has been made public (personal communication from Ali Mousavi). 35 II. 5. The Burial Chamber: Analysis and Typology The top of the rectangular burial chamber was found 1.10 meters below surface level. The chamber had a near east-west orientation. The interior of the chamber measured 2.50 m in length, 1.36 m in width and 0.90 m high and was covered with five heavy cap stones of various dimensions and shapes: (averages from east to west) slab 1: 0.52 x 2.20 m; slab 2: 2.04 x ? m; slab 3: 1.35 x ? m; slab 4: unknown; and slab 5: 1.30 x 160 m [see plate 5]. With the exception of a possible entrance on the eastern wall, all the walls were built of eleven layers of relatively regular rectangular stone slabs. The eastern wall seems not to have had a stone wall. The surface of the floor, the walls, and the upper edge of the chamber were plastered with gypsum. The tomb contained a number of exceptional artifacts placed inside and outside a U-shaped (bathtub) bronze coffin. The objects found outside the coffin comprised ornate versions of household items: 10 chalices, one jar, one candelabrum stand, and one lamp — all cast in bronze — one exceptional beaker made in bronze and faience, a jar made in silver, and one sizable bronze bowl. Inside the coffin and next to the skeletal remains lying in a flexed position were various luxurious items of personal apparel: 98 gold bracteates that originally must have been sewn to a robe, cotton textile fragments folded pillow-like beneath the skull, a golden ring-like object deposited over the chest next to the left hand of the deceased, a small silver rod, and an iron dagger with bone hilt, silver foil, and gold and agate decorations lying near the left side of the skeleton. No pottery was present, a fact perhaps easily explained if one coniders the tomb was flooded and remained so for a considerable amount of time (see comments on the bathtub coffin). 36 Previous studies of the Arjan burial have stressed the highland-lowland dual composite aspect of this type of tomb construction (Majidzadeh 1990). The usage of stone for the side walls and the roof is foreign to the western Elamite region of Susiana but common in the Zagros highland region of Luristan. A short review of the particularities of Luristan funerary traditions in the Pusht-i Kuh was recently completed by B. Overlaet (Overlaet 2003: 62-68). The 121 tombs discussed by Overlaet present a number of characteristics most relevant for their connections with the Arjan burial [see plate 6]. The tombs were grouped in cemeteries and, since they were often re-used, the exact location of their entrance was marked at surface level. Examples from Chamhzi Mumah indicate that stone circles and sometimes one or more head stones marked the surface of the location of the burial chamber. 64 The burial chamber was situated at a depth between 0.30 and 0.70 m below the surface (Haerinck and Overlaet 1998: 3-6, ill. 1, fig. 5, pis. 7-9; Overlaet 2003: 62). The Luristan tombs were grouped in cemeteries but the Arjan burial appearsto have been an isolated phenomenon. Given the virtual absence of archaeological work defining the setting of the Arjan burial we have to reserve judgment as to the isolation of the interment. The presence in the Arjan tomb of two large jars at the surface level (situated 1.10 meters above the burial) may have served to indicate the presence of the actual burial chamber. According to B. Overlaet \"when a tomb was planned to be reused it was necessary to assemble an accessible entrance which would not destabilize the construction when it was reopened and which could be located by some sort of indication at the surface... The entrance to the tomb chamber was closed with one or 64 \"How exactly the tombs were identified at the surface remains an open question\" (Overlaet 2003: 63). 37 two large stones, which were sometimes placed on a horizontal stone ('the threshold'), and between two vertical stones ('the doorposts')\" (Overlaet 2003: 64) (see plate 7:1 1). 65 It is most significant that the Arjan burial chamber was built with three solid walls made of stones while leaving the eastern wall free. As in the case of examples from Luristan, this may suggest the original presence of a threshold and a doorstone on the eastern side. Unfortunately, this section of the chamber was disturbed by machinery at the time of its discovery making the presence of a threshold and doorposts just a likely possibility. As at Arjan, some tombs in Luristan are covered with cap stones of irregular shapes. Large heavy cap stones covered the ceiling of the Arjan burial. Their weight and size indicate that their transportation and placement would have required a great degree of coordination and organization (Overlaet 2003: 63). Most tombs from Luristan have no special floor surface. The few exceptions contain floors made of stone slabs or paving tiles (Overlaet 2003: 66). The materials used for the tomb construction and the building techniques used in Luristan depended probably on the local availability of the building materials and seem to have little significance as a chronological indicator. In addition, \"there are no indications that stones were worked to adapt their size or shape\" (Overlaet 2003: 66). In contrast, the walls of the Arjan tomb were made of regular, symmetrical, and parallel arrangements of stones. The angles of the chamber were also skillfully made. This, in conjunction with the plastering of the floors and walls, presents a marked departure from Luristan 65 Some burials contain an entrance limited to the upper half of the wall (Pa-yi Kal or Bard-i Bal) (Overlaet 2003: 64). 38 funerary architecture. 66 Instead, gypsum plastered walls and floor, and the symmetrical design of the tomb follow traditions associated with Elamite burial practices from western Elam, included Susiana and Ram Hormuz. Funerary evidence from the pre-Achaemenid sites of Tepe Bormi and Tall-i Ghazir, in the Ram Hormuz plain can be compared to those found at Susa (Ville Royale II and VR-Ap trench 5244, de Miroschedji 1981a; 1981b in Carter 1994: 70-71). The funerary goods are associated with the Neo-Elamite II phase (725/700-520 BC), with parallels to the Achaemenid Village I ware types (Carter 1994: 71). Burial L was apparendy constructed with a lid made of a mud slab, one side was partially built of bricks 67 and walls covered with green-gray plaster. All the bodies were oriented with their heads facing south (Carter 1994: 71). The presence in Arjan of an underground stone-built funerary chamber coated with gypsum plaster represents a significant departure from the traditional architectural wisdom of western Elam. For centuries — whether at Susa, Tchogha Zanbil or Haft Tappeh — underground funerary chambers were built with a characteristic backed brick radial vault and, at least for those of monumental proportions, coated on the inside with gypsum. The building of brick chambers required craft expertise, 68 available material, and fidelity to a continuing funerary tradition. Many of the funerary vaulted 66 The cist tombs from Ilam, in the Pusht-i Kuh, include rectangular individual cist tombs built with stone slabs. Except for one tomb (out of 16 so far published), they were all oriented east-west; An Iron Age IIB-III has been suggested (Overlaet 2003: 17-18). 67 The brick size (9.5 x 39-40 x 39-40 cm) is comparable to the ones appearing on burials 763 and 639 (Ville Royale II level 7B; Miroschedji 1981a: 41, in Carter 1994: 71). 68 Most of the surviving examples of smaller tombs in western Elam were roofed with corbelled vaults. Gypsum mortar is usually used between the bricks. 39 tombs from Susa were provided with an entrance that allowed for a multiplicity of burials perhaps suggesting the the presence of family mausolea. In sum, the Arjan burial combines two types of funerary traditions. In its usage of stone versus mud brick the tomb follows traditions attested in the Zagros mountains of Luristan. On the other side, the gypsum plastered walls and floor, and the symmetrical design of the tomb follow traditions associated with Elamite burial practices from western Elam, included Susiana and Ram Hormuz. The significance of this new type of funerary architecture, which can be said to be characterized by a combination of highland-lowland traditions, should be applied with some caution since we know nothing or little about first millennium funerary practices from the Behbehan region, the central Zagros highlands, 70 or Fars. 71 There is however no doubt the technique of building a stone walled chamber, coating it with plaster, and covering the tomb with large cap stones involves particular skill, much organization and manpower. 72 This, in addition to the luxurious items found inside the tomb, suggest that its occupant enjoyed a status of wealth and high rank (Majidzadeh 1990: 131-144). 69 These tombs have not yet been published; only a brief description appeared on the various articles byR. Ghirshman 1964, 1965a, 1965b, 1966b, 1967, 1968b, and 1970. 70 North of Behbehan, a preliminary survey of Iron Age remains from the Middle Zagros territories of Lurdagan plain, Khana Mirza plain, Chigha Khor and Shahr-e Kord plains have not disclosed evidence of funerary practices (Zagarell 1982). 71 The evidence from Fars pertains only to a cluster of isolated burials from Tall-i Malyan which further offer some indication of the presence of a nomadic population in the region during the first half f the first millennium BC (see burial 47 from EDD, Carter 1994: 66). 72 According to B. Overlaet there seems to be a direct relationships between a more substantial investment of time and effort in the burial construction and the social status of the most valuable burial goods inside. The examples from the Iron Age III cemetery at Chamahzi Mumah and tomb 10 at Bard-i Bal (perhaps reused from Iron Age I down to Iron Age III) may support this idea (Overlaet 2003: 63 and 556). 40 THE BATHTUB COFFIN II.6. The U-Shaped 'Bathtub' Coffin Inside the burial chamber there was a U-shaped bronze coffin measuring 1 32 x 60 x 60 cm [see plate 7] made of two separate halves joined by two stays riveted to the body. The bottom of the coffin and its overhanging ledge are also fastened to the main body in the same fashion [plate 7]. Each end of the coffin has two ribbed pairs of handles riveted to the coffin just below the rim [figure 8:1]. Some pieces of decayed rope were found tied to the handles. The lid itself consists of a bronze U-shaped sheet with a separate band riveted around its edge as a rim. This band still shows at least three registers of incised decoration representing buds and lotus flowers running parallel to the edge of the lid [figures 8:3, 8:4]. 73 Each end of the lid has a single bronze handle rivetted to the surface and aligned with the long axis of the coffin. The U-shaped coffin found in Arjan shares many typological features with other coffins, which, given their similarity to nineteenth century bathtubs, are commonly known in the literature as \"bathtub\" coffins. These coffins or sarcophagi were made of clay or bronze, with straight sides, rounded at one end and squared-off at the other. They could also have a pair of handles at either end. There are hundreds of terracotta counterparts to the bronze 'bathtub' coffins. Their geographical extent reaches all the way from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Their chronological range is difficult to interpret. In Elam, bathtub type coffins made of clay are well attested as early as the Sukkalmah period (de Mecquenem 1980: 29, see fig. 12, pg. 73 1 am most appreciative to John Curtis for looking over and confirming these details. 41 134). 74 Bathtub clay coffins continued to be used during the Achaemenid period 75 and even down to the Parthian period (Zorn 1993: 220). 16 The particular type of bronze coffin found in Arjan has been found to share close analogies with a number of coffins made during the Neo-Assyrian period which are ascribed to the second half of the 8 th century and the first half of the 7 th century BC (ca. 750-650 BC; Curtis 1983: 86). These bathtub bronze coffins were almost certainly 74 Such coffins can be horizontally grooved as well as flat sided. Interestingly, in all the examples mentioned by R. de Mecquenem, both under the central courtyard and in the eastern sector of the Achaemenid palace, the terracotta bathtubs were found \"renverses\" (de Mecquenem 1922: 118-119, fig. 1; 1980: 21). This would indicate that the original purpose of these bathtubs was not to be used as funerary receptacles into which the deceased's body was deposited but as instant, roofed, funerary spaces. At Haft Tappeh a pottery sarcophagus measuring 0.47 m high, 1.55x 0.59 m at the rim and 1.32 x 0.55 at the base was found on the western edge of the Temple Complex (Negahban 1991: 22, plate 19A). A thick rope made of palm fiber and bitumen may have been used as internal structure to reinforce the walls; this coffin had a lid and was not inverted. In a related area, a number of large pottery jars big enough to contain the body of a child were found lying nearby. There is also an example of a large jar \"enclosing the body within the broad open mouth of the jar\" (Negahban 1991: 22). In brief, this would indicate that the original purposes of many of these bathtubs was not to be used as funerary receptacles into which the deceased's body was deposited but as small, readily available roofed \"tombs\". 75 What follows is a list of sites arranged geographically from west to east where bathtub coffins have been reported. Tell en-Nasbeh, Tell-el Far'an, Tell el-Mazar, Megiddo, Shechem, and perhaps Dothan. The stratigraphy and associated finds suggests a late 8 th century down to the 6 th — Neo-Babylonian period (ca. 586-539 BC) — and early 5 th centuries (Zorn 1993: 219). Jordan near Amman, dated to the 7 th century BC (Harding 48 ff. P1.6. 47; see also Stern 8). Carchemish (Woolley 1939: 21-37). Til Barsip (Thureau-Dangin 1936: 76-78). 42 samples are reported from Babylon (Ruther 1926: 212-234); 43 samples in Nippur (McCown, Haines and Hansen 1967: 119; Gibson 1975: 74-75; Gibson 1978: 70-71; McCown 1978: 54); 3 samples in Tell al-Laham (Safar 1949: 161-163). Over 150 samples from Ur (Woolley 1962: 52- 87). 21 samples from Uruk (Boehmer 1987: 3; Finkbeiner 1984: 109; Noldeke, Heinrick and Schott 1933: 24; Rau 1987: 246); 39 samples from Ashur (Haller 1954: 4, 54-58). One sample from Khirbet Qasrij (Curtis 1989: 50); 3 samples at Nimrud (Oates 1957: 37-38; Oates and Oates 1958: 153-157; MaUowan 1966: 114-116); Bahrain (Glob 1954: 167-168; 1956: 172-173; Boucharlat 1995: 1349); For details see Zorn 1993: 219-220. 76 According to Strommenger the U-shaped coffins originated in the Assyrian heartland, as they are attested since the Middle Assyrian periods, and spread to southern Mesopotamian during the 8 th century and down to the 4 th century BC (Strommenger 1964: 170-171). A provoking question arises in regard to the possible genesis of this characteristic U- type of coffin. One may wonder if, ultimately, this shape evolved out of traditional underground stone burials which, as we have seen from the Luristan examples, were made with one straight side in order to allow for an entrance to the burial. 42 made by a single workshop located in Assyria 77 and have been described as \"made from two sheets of bronze hammered into shape and joined together in the middle of the long side. The joints are concealed by vertical strips of bronze applied inside and out and held in position by rivets. At either end of the coffin there are two heavy bronze handles, set just below the overhanging ledge\" (Curtis 1983: 85). As for the location where these bathtub coffins may have been manufactured, Curtis believes that these strongly Assyrian influenced coffins must have been made either in metropolitan Assyria or in one of its regional satellites (Curtis 1983: 93). 78 As indicated by the similarities of manufacture, the Arjan bathtub bronze coffin belongs to the family of bronze coffins from Nimrud, Dailaman, Ur, Ziwiye and Zinjirli. Given that we cannot rely on the alleged authenticity or on the reported origin of the Dailaman 79 and Ziwiye samples, the examples from Nimrud, Zinjirli, and Ur will serve as guidelines in which to establish a comparative analysis of the evidence. Table IV below illustrates the main characteristics of these bronze bathtubs and includes other U shaped bronze and oval terracotta bathtub type coffins found at Susa and Haft Tappeh, a discussion of their similarities and related implications ensues. 77 Although 'I am bound to admit that the case is far form proven' (Curtis 1983: 93). 78 However the presence of similar but not identical and considerably smaller examples from Anatolia dating to the Hittite period might indicate an earlier date and different origin for them (Kosay and Akok 1966: pi 34; pis. 7 107). 79 This is reported to be the property an antiquities dealer in Cologne (Curtis 1983: 85). 80 The circumstances of the 'Ziwiye' finds and the authenticity of some of the objects found associated with the bathtub coffin have been questioned and should be viewed with great caution (Muscarella 1977: 197-219; 2000: 76-81). The Ziwiye coffin is said to have contained the well known treasure associated with this site (Godard 1950: 13-18; Wilkinson 1963; 274-284; Curtis 1983: 85). An additional bronze coffin with lead cladding, measuring ca. 1.35 m in length is on exhibit at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. The latter coffin was purchased in eastern Anatolia. 43 Table of U-shaped Bronze (and Clay) \"Bathtub\" Coffins Location Dimensions (L,W,H) Dates / Decoration References Ur 8 ' -PG1 82 - PG2 83 PG1: 1.123 x 0.63 x 0.58 Late 8 to early 7 century BC PG2: 1.113 x Chased decoration on 0.57 x 0.54 vertical strip representing goats standing on rosettes 84 Woolley/Mallowa n 1956: 113 PL 17; Barnett 1956: 115; Moorey 1982: 260; Curtis 1983:92.

The handles were made in bronze (2.8 x 19.5 cm) with riveted rosette-shaped attachments (van Luschan and Andrae 1943: 171, S 3809 and pg. 118, plate 57). 86 The Zinjirli example is plain; it predates 670 BC when Esarhaddon destroyed the site (van Luschan and Andrae 1943: 118 ff. plate 57; Curtis 1983: 86). 44 Nimrud 1.3 m in Post Tiglath-Pileser III (744- Curtis 1995: 21; Three Bronz length (no 727) Damerji 1999: 4; Coffins 87 further Oates 2001: 86 dimensions and 202 found) Luristan, nea 1.80 x 0.87 x Unexcavated find Press release on Khorramabac 0.55 5/14/2005 88 Susa Inverted clay Apadana, Central courtyard, R. de coffins under the Achaemenid Mecquenem palace.

The bones of at least 13 individuals were recovered from inside the three bronze coffins, all representing secondary deposition. Coffin 1 contained the bones of a 20 to 29 year old woman together with a fetus and four children aged between 3 months and 11 years. Coffin 2 contained the skeleton of an 18 to 20 year old woman, together with a 6 to 12 year old child. Coffin 2 also yielded a breathtaking amount of precious objects consisting of 449 separate items, the gold and silver alone weighing some 23 kg. The most recent inscribed object in the tomb is a 15 mina duck weight of the time of Tiglath-Pileser III (744-727 BC). Coffin 3 contained the skeletons of five adults, three men and two woman (J. and D.
