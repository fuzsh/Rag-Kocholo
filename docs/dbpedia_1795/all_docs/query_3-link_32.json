        "text": "A new species of Teucrium L. from Southeast Anatolia (Turkey), Teucrium sirnakense Özcan & Dirmenci, is described and illustrated. The new species belongs to the sect. Scordium Boiss. and is closely related to Teucrium melissoides Boiss. & Hausskn. and Teucrium scordium L. s.l. The differences between the new species and its allies are discussed. A description, distribution map, ITS nrDNA phylogeny, and taxonomic comments on the new species are provided.\n\nA new species of Teucrium L., Teucrium aladagense Vural & H.Duman, is described from Aladağ mountain, located in Adana, Kayseri, and Niğde provinces in Turkey. The species belongs to Teucrium L. sect. Stachyobotrys Benth. A description, distribution map, habitat, information on trichome morphology, and the threatened category of the species are provided. The differences between the new species and its allies T. lamiifolium d’Urv s.l. and T. hircanicum L. are discussed, and an identification key is provided for the identification of similar taxa.\n\nThe article provides typification of the names of 10 species and varieties of the genus Teucrium described by S. V. Juzepczuk, N. P. Popov, M. V. Klokov, C. A. Meyer and F. E. L. Fischer, K. H. Rechinger, K. H. E. Koch and P.-E. Boissier in the Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Turkey. Six lectotypes and two neotypes are designated here.\n\nA critical taxonomic revision of the genus Teucrium (Lamiaceae) in Egypt is presented. It reveals the presence of fi ve species, including two subspecies and four varieties. Two new nomenclatural combinations are proposed: Teucrium jordanicum and T. jordanicum var. sinaicum . Th e latter in addition to T. polium subsp. capitatum are added for the fi rst time to the fl ora of the country. A key, annotated enumeration of species and notes on the distribution of the species are also provided.\n\nSeveral natural hybrids between Teucrium montanum L. and T. polium L. have been described in certain parts of the area where this two species are in sympatry. A new population with intermediate individuals that share morphological characteristics of both T. montanum and T. polium is found in Croatia (Bisko near Trilj), and most likely represent a hybridogenous taxon. The aim of this study is to compare morpho-anatomical and phytochemical characteristics of two parental species and their putative hybrid, as well as to determine the most important distinguishing characters between these three groups. In order to describe the variability and significance of morpho-anatomical and phytochemical differentiation of analysed groups several multivariate statistical analysis were conducted (PCA, CDA, DFA, UPGMA-clustering). All analyses confirm the separation of two species, T. polium and T. montanum, and reveal intermediate position of their putative hybrid. In this way, data of morphologica...\n\nIn this study, karyotypes of Teucrium sandrasicum O. Schwarz, T. brevifolium Schreb., T. divaricatum Sieber subsp. villosum (Celak.) Rech.f., T. flavum L. subsp. hellenicum Rech.f. and T. kotschyanum Poech taxa growing naturally in Turkey were determined. T. sandrasicum is endemic to Turkey. The squash method for preparation was used for chromosomal investigations. As a result, T. divaricatum subsp. villosum has a somatic chromosome number as 2n = 64 while T. flavum subsp. hellenicum and T. kotschyanum have 2n = 32 chromosomes and also T. sandrasicum and T. brevifolium have 2n = 30 chromosomes. The ideograms and detailed chromosome morphology measurements of the species were performed by the use of Image Analysis System (Bs200Pro). The research has made contribution to the taxonomic revision of the genus Teucrium in Turkey."
