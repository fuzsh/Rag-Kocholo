Thus, the of slogan of \"The Great Civilization\" as the expression the ideological and cultural ethos of the ruling elite was pitted against the slogan of an \"Islamic Republic\" which became the rallying cry of a mass revolt . Last but not the least, the processes of moernization in and by themselves have shown an inherent tendency, in Iran as elsewhere, toward atomization of society, bureaucratization\n\nand centralization\n\nof\n\nauthority,\n\nand homogeni-\n\nzation of culture.4 These triple are fundatendencies mentally rooted in the nature of modernization, which calls of manipulation for increasing of nature and levels society, technological production, bureaucratic rationaliand cultural zation, secularization. These primary carriers of modernization have operated universally in the and cultural economic, political, spheres to produce conof exploitation, ditions transience, anonymity, and anomie for modern man. However, some secondary carriers of modern industrial society have provided antidotes and defense mechanisms. The urbanization of society, the professionalization and pluralization of life worlds, the political mobilization of the oppressed, and the cognitive participaCOMMUNICATION AND REVOLUTION\n\n7\n\ntion of the emerging sectors in the decision-making processes represent forces which have each in a complex variety of ways provided multiple sources of identity, legitimacy and community. By contrast, mass communication, mass education, and mass consumption as the tertiary carriers of modernization have performed in a variety of contradictory ways under different historical settings and institutional arrangements. In general, however, we could say that wherever the institutions of social and political participation have lagged behind the carriers of modernization, the triple tendencies of atomization of society, centralization of authority and control (includingabureaucratization of communication through the mass media), and homogenization of culture, have produced various forms of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. The cult of the state as the embodiment of all that is true, good, and beautiful (i.e., Reason and Order) plagued Iran no less than it has other modernizing societies with totalitarian tendencies. The state did not recognize any truth beyond itself and could not tolerate any challenges to its authority and legitimacy. All other institutions were to serve its mundane yet mystified purposes and designs with no claim to any purpose and design of their own. Every whisper of opposition was considered the ultimate treason, leaving little room for a natural development of contradictions and their resolution. In Iran, the forces of modernization--particularly in the nearly 60 years of Pahlavi rule--thus represented a relentless drive toward Westernization, secularization, and centralization of authority buttressed by a modern army and police apparatus, an expanding and parasitic and the support and blessings bureaucracy, of Western In this process, powers. the indigenous institutions of social and political comparticipation (the village munity, the tribes, the urban voluntary associations such as the guilds, the mosque, the khaneqah, the zurkhaneh) were repressed or undermined without being effectively replaced by modern institutions of social participation.

Despite all of this, the system was not a full-proof totalitarian one. It operated under an economy open to international movements of goods, services, and capital, sensitive and vulnerable to world public opinion, and with a great deal of population movement both within the country and without. The general collapse of the system should be attributed, therefore, as much to feelings of homelessness, depersonalization, and humiliation in most sectors of the population as to economic mismanagement, political repression, social cultural injustice, alienation, and moral corruption. Imperial pretensions increased as the substance of power diminished. Thus, the legitimation of the regime of interactive through the processes communication, cognitive participation, self-identification, and self-authenof the citizens tification with the state faltered. In the meantime, the processes of atomization, bureauand homogenization cratization, took place largely through COMMUNICATION AND REVOLUTION\n\n9\n\nconrapid economic growth, the unfolding of an acquisitive sumer society, a high rate of urbanization and social moin the and great drives toward secularization bilization, The social syslegal, educational, and cultural spheres. tem was not able, however, to absorb the disintegrating effects of all these forces which were unleashed, particafter the so-called \"White Revolution\" of the early ularly What seemed to many foreign observers as a showcase '60s. and development, was in fact of enlightened dictatorship The financial corrupthe making of a national tragedy. repression, and intelpolitical tion, social injustices, lectual arrogance of the regime, augmented particularly after the quadrupling of oil revenues in 1973, provided only additional fuel to the deepening resentments of a society undergoing the agonies of change. Although the collapse of the system took place in a dramatically short period of time, from September 1978 to February 1979, the surprise was not in its demise but in the fact that it had survived for so long. A profound sense of malaise characterized Persian society in the '70s--the hour of its material triumphs; and the glitter did not conceal to the perceptive the moral decadence and cultural vacuity. In this context, therefore, it was no wonder that for leadership Iranian society turned to a sector least affected by the corrupting influences of modernization, the ulama. Because the ulama under the Pahlavis had been stripped of their control over the legal, progressively and endowment (waqf) institutions educational, charitable, while still retaining their spiritual powers through the mosque and minbar, they had both the cause and the means Twice in this century the ulama to stir the opposition. had entered into an alliance with the bazaar merchants and in campaigns to limit the monthe liberal intelligentsia Revoluarchy. In both of these cases (the Constitutional m'ovementof tion of 1905-11 and the oil nationalization who led the 1951-53), it was the liberal intellectuals way and the ulama who provided the mass support, but the situation had radically changed in the meantime. The riots of 1963, taking place in protest against the \"White to come. Revolution,\" were a harbinger of the new politics led from Qom They were organized and almost exclusively IRANIAN STUDIES\n\n10\n\nwith Ayatollah Khomeini as its leading spokesman. They had been preceded by a visit paid to Qom by the shah in December 1962, during which he had castigated the radical ulama as backward, and lice-ridden,\" to be crushed if \"tobscurantist, they resisted his enlightened reforms. This was followed by the referendum of January 1963, which seemed to have given him popular support for his six-point reform program. But the program was rejected in the following June by massive riots. The last vestiges of rapport between the monarchy and the ulama, which had supported each other since the coup of 1953 against the common threat of communism, was ruptured. For the moment, however, the radical ulama seemed to have been isolated from their allies among the bazaaris and the liberal intellectuals who, represented by the National Front, acted bewildered during the riots of 1963. This was the beginning of a relentless bestruggle tween the radical ulama and the monarchical regime, characand venom. terized by bitterness In interviews conducted by the author with some leading religious leaders in 1974, the issues emerged quite clearly.6 To the ulama (though not a monolithic and homogeneous group), it seemed that the entire trend of Iranian society was going against their sense the of truth, and justice. goodness, Their archenemies, and their foreign Bahais, the secularizing technocrats, advisers were ruling supreme in every niche and corner--in the court, in the armed forces, in SAVAK, in important branches of the civil and in the booming fibureaucracy, nancial and industrial enterprises. Having wrested the and charitable educational, from their institutions legal, hands, the monarchical regime was intent on taking their prerogatives away even in family and religious matters. The new Family Law of 1967-74 introduced measures that undermined some of the fundamental tenets of Islam on marriage and divorce.

The secular view was profoundly Westernized and couched in Faustian terms: a remorseless search for power by means of the mastery of science and technology. The shah himself typified such an attitude by his love of gadgets (particularly military gadgets); his fetish for high, capital-intensive technology (e.g., nuclear energy, in a country endowed with immense resources of oil and natural gas); and his ambition, flaunted with missionary zeal, to transform Iran within twenty years into the world's fifth major industrial power. Symbolic throughout, one of his first acts after returning to power in 1953 was to change the name of the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of War. But all this show of strength was undermined by a tragic undercurrent of mysticism and martyrdom, a constant appeal to the unseen powers who protected his life in four assassination a steadfast attempts, call to meet his destiny, and in the end a resignation to accept the inevitable instead of engaging in a bloody counterrevolution.7 The same themes of power, blood, and martyrdom also ran in the religious opposition's world view, but as a major note. The unconscious motives beneath the choice of Dr. Mosaddeq and Ayatollah Khomeini as the opposition's charismatic leaders in less than a generation reveals a profound continuity of historical archetypes. The historical consciousness of Iranians has been always deeply moved by the memory of those heroic martyrs who achieved positions of spiritual power through acts of defiance against tyrants, by shedding their blood to redeem the weak and the oppressed.

The power of television to demystify was thoroughly forgotten. The king increasingly appeared as a jester, with no clothes at all. The absence of intermediary channels of communication between the state and the people meant that messages often fell on either deaf or incredulous ears. A vicious circle was at work; the government imposed its own construction of reality upon the audiences and received in turn, through the media and the intelligence network, its own prettified reconstruction of unTo paraphrase Lord Acton, power blinded pleasant truths. and absolute power blinded absolutely. It was Prime Minister Sharif-Emami who, in the fall of 1978, shrewdly recognized the extent of the credibility \"If we say it gap: is daytime when it is daytime, people will deduce it is night-time.\" The technological feat of covering this vast and mountainous country by a large network of microwave communication system within a decade or so was thus largely countercommunicative. Meanwhile, in direct contrast, the traditional communication system was thriving. religious Its success depended on several factors. It used informal channels and small, as opposed to big, media. Its message was familiar and designed in terms of the archetypical legends of Persian historical memory. And it was credible because it corresponded to the living reality of its audience, delivered by legitimate opinion leaders. The network was organized around some 60,000 to 200,000 mullahs10 who had come from small towns and villages to be trained in Qom, Najaf, or Mashad and then go back to their towns and villages--with little or no brain drain. Whereas the professional broadcasters and journalists were mostly Westernized urban dwellers, the mullahs retained organic ties with the lower and middle classes COMMUNICATION AND REVOLUTION\n\n17\n\nand knew their\n\nhopes and sufferings.\n\nThe madrasa (theological seminary) at Qom alone could claim a student population of some 12,000-15,000 talabehs, mostly of peasant origins, who led a life of monastic simplicity on small stipends from the ayatollahs. The talabehs were the hard core of the religious revival, increasingly radicalized by the widening gulf between rich and poor, between the religious and secular life, and the heavy burden of political Khorepression. After 1963, it was Ayatollah meini's militancy and Ali Shari'ati's special blending of Shi'ism, Marxism, and existentialism that captured the imagination of this religious intelligentsia.11 The communication network on which this increasingly and revolutionary volatile group depended was as old as Islam itself. It was based on some 90,000 mosques, ranging from the city centers to the smallest settlement. These mosques were increasingly supplemented by numerous new religious lecture halls (hosayniyeh), by informal meetings at people's homes where the Quran was read and interpreted, and by religious processions (dasteh) and religious mournings (rowzeh khani). The best known of these religious centers was the Hosayniyeh Ershad in Tehran, which became intellectual center of a modernist movement the thriving But the center was soon in the late '60s and early '70s. and Ali Shari'ati, its closed down, the movement repressed, leader, detained by the government.12 link in this communication network Another essential to the ulama through allied was the bazaar.

IRANIAN STUDIES\n\n18\n\nhas been thus primarily urban and commercial. The network of guilds (asnaf), mosques, and covered bazaars has always formed the throbbing centers of Islamic cities. This netallied to a whole host of other work has been historically of mixed secular and religious urban voluntary associations The khaneqah (the Sufi house of worship), functions. the zurkhaneh the (the traditional sports house of strength),\n\nor qahvehkhaneh dowreh (periodic\n\nthe chaikhaneh\n\n(coffee\n\nor tea houses),\n\nthe\n\nof small urban peer groups) get-togethers all served to provide a resilient informal network of communication which could always mobilize the urban population on behalf of mass political causes. The two other critical links in this system consisted of the lutis (the chivalrous men who combined physical strength with moral uprightness) and the retail merchants. Although this combination of forces degenerated at times into mob action on behalf of obscurantist and sectarian causes, given the right leadership, it also acted through history as the only real urban power against the unlimited and arbitrary powers of the shahs. Since the turn of the century, this informal communication network has effectively galvanized three mass movements. On all three occasions (the constitutional revolutionary movement, the oil nationalization movement, and the Islamic revolutionary movement), the ulama and the bazaar entered into an alliance with the radical intelligentsia to work against and despotism. imperialism Through this alliance, the traditional communication networks were linked directly with the more modern networks, using schools and universities, the urban dowrehs, the underground and exiled publications, the poetry reading circuits, It etc. was this combination of forces and communication channels which was put to work against the monarchy, particularly after June 1963. The ulama's last ties to the monarchy were severed after the shah's bitter attack on the \"liceridden and obscurantist\" mullahs, delivered in a staged demonstration in Qom six months earlier.

The number of periodicals published in exile abroad rose to more than 35. The newer electronic devices provided opportunities for many novel uses. The introduction of transistorized audiotape machines greatly increased the sales of prerecorded religious messages. Tapes were used both for strictly religious and for political messages.

This seeming tautology indicates the bankruptcy of expost facto theorization about revolution,when what in fact is needed is a mode of analysis able to determine under what circumstances a given set of factors will lead to revolution and under what conditions seemingly identical factors will not. In short, we should be as interested in explaining how revolutions come about as we are in their mechanics. Given the extraordinarily high level of popular participation in the Iranian revolution, an attempt should be made to link participation in the revolution with participation in the prerevolutionary period. Additionally, an explanation must be sought that accounts for the broad-based urban support for the revolution, and minimal rural involvement. In sum, because the most salient aspect of the Iranian revolution lies in the of political nature of participation in it, the perspective participation should aid us in understanding the questions In this paper I argue that in Iran, rapid posed above. socioeconomic development gave rise to demands for popular participation. By ignoring or trying to negate these demands, the shah forced those seeking participation into political action outside the proscribed system. At the this extrasystemic was fragmented and difoutset, activity fuse. Ultimately, however, it culminated in a coherent and overwhelming tide of anti-Pahlavi countermobilization, spearinfraheaded by the only group in Iran with the requisite and popular legitimacy--the structural attributes religious sector.\n\nMobilization\n\nand Participation\n\nin\n\nIran\n\nBefore the rise to power of MohammadReza Shah Pahlavi in 1941, popular political participation rarely exfelt Its relative absence became acutely isted in Iran. only during the middle and late years of the shah's rule.

Thus, Iran evolved into what Huntington has called a \"modernizing monarchy,\" in this case characterized by a particularly pragmatic and cynical form of modernization whose primary goal was preservation of the Pahlavi dynasty.3 Modernization had as its goal not social improvement per se, but rather the unrealized ambition of improving the country's economic status while at the same time keeping the level of popular political involvement as it had been for generations. This caricature of modernity was meant to embody all of the qualities related to such processes, with one major exception--political modernity. For inherent in the peculiarly contradictory goal of a modernizing monarchy is the maintenance of a particularly nonmodern form of state management, monarchical autocracy. It is in the tension between these two competing goals that we find the most relevant antecedents to the Iranian revolution. As a means of illuminating the origins of the Iranian revolution, we might turn to Karl Deutsch's formulation of social mobilization.4 According to him, the process of modernization a form of mobilization entails in which various sectors of society are inducted into and inculcated with the values of a changing society around them. Along with social mobilization, a process of politicization begins to occur in which citizens develop an increased awareness of the existence and activities of their national government. Through such factors as an increase in literacy, GNP, educational attainment, urbanization, and exposure to mass media and the elements of a modern society (cities, factories, shops), consciousness is raised and an irreversible desire for political involvement If stimulated. national to sanction elites are either unable or unwilling participation, they may be paving the wayfor political instability and for a government out of touch with its citizenry. Such an outcome, according to Myron Weiner, may be termed a \"crisis of participation,\" which in i-ts most dramatic form may spell revolution.5\n\nPSEUDOPARTICIPATION\n\nAND COUNTERMOBILIZATION\n\n33\n\nthat social mobilization Although others recognize they are not as sanguine as culminates in politicization, of providing opDeutsch or Weiner about the advisability Samuel Huntington for political participation. portunities is sensitive to the problem, arguing that when participation apparatus created to absorb it, exceeds the institutional for Huntington, powill ensue.6 Therefore, instability restricted. should be carefully In litical participation a more recent work with Joan Nelson, he argues for an emphasis on economic growth, which he feels will produce a 7 fashion. in a responsible to participate middle class likely the dangers of politicization David Apter also recognizes in which a population political mobilization, and discusses of is provided with the form, although not the substance, of such mobilAn example, par excellence, participation.8 ization may be found in the Soviet Union, where much effort is expended on an elaborate and cosmetic charade of the parthis that facilitate The conditions ticipatory process.9 to exist in most deare not likely \"pseudoparticipation\" three In Iran, the shah had essentially states. veloping options open to him in response to growing politicization, in the fashion (1) the gradual expansion of participation of particidiscussed by Deutsch and Weiner; (2) repression pation a la Huntington until such time as there was a midof the partidle class up to the task; or (3) replication cipatory process emphasizing form not substance in the by Apter.

The actiof such regime opponents were avidly followed by most vities to the crown. Iranians well aware of any and all opposition also contributed Other aspects of social mobilization For example, expansion in Iran. to popular politicization of the mass media was a central developmental priority of the shah. The reasons for this lay not in a desire to provide cheap popular entertainment, but rather to capitalize on radio and television as valuable tools for effecting social mobilization. According to one scholar close to National Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT), \"broadcasting in developing countries cannot play a neutral or pasfor sive role.\" Instead, the media should be \"catalysts while \"foschange and stimuli to national development,\" tering the development of a socially aware and patriotic youth,\" and strengthening the \"bases of national unity.\"119 The revolution attests to NIRT's failure to attain its goals, of its potential the but the regime's perceptions reflect shah's overall and strategies. developmental priorities By 1978 NIRT employed 7,000 people, with projections for doubling its staff by the 1980s. In 1975-76 its budget rose by 20 percent, while other government agencies had and mass their's cut. Indeed, the budget for information communications of which NIRT was a central component exceeded that of culture and arts as well as urban development, and was only 25 percent less than the budget for social seof NIRT's telecurity and welfare.20 Yet, fully one-third vision and radio programs were offered in English and other of the shah's European languages, a reflection, many felt, for the West and disdain for things Persian.21 preference Programming was surprisingly mediocre, with strong doses of Western-style films and thrillers.

This conflict between the society's most and the government served as a particulardeprived citizens ly unflattering portrait of the shah and his modernizers. Reacting to the chaos around him, the shah replaced Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hovayda with Jamshid Amuzegar. Amuzegar was compelled to begin his tenure by restricting credit to fight the country's raging inflation. These restrictions led to a recession, a cutback on building and development programs, and an increase in unemployment which affected large numbers of urban migrants. Foolishly, Amuzegar also eliminated government subsidies to the religious sector. None of these restrictions endeared the new prime to the Iranian people. minister Regime insensitivity of to the nature and intensity to it generated further opposition, opposition while its attempts at political mobilization through the Rastakhiz Party had clearly failed. Sensing regime indecisiveness, as well as taking inspiration from criticisms by Iranian students abroad, human rights groups, and even the United States government, various middle-class professional and associational groups decided to act. Realizing that politically they had nothing to lose, these groups chose to go outside of the system to express their discontent, for no means to express dissatisfaction within the system existed. Their activities to were almost incomprehensible the regime, a regime that prided itself on having fostered the dramatic growth of an urban middle class. According to James Bill, \"the middle classes in Iran.. .make up over 25 percent of the population.\",29 This sector, Iran's most socially mobilized, was the sector most eager for political input and most outraged by its denial. Yet it should be emphasized that their initial goal was to bring about reform, not revolution. It was only later, after the establishment of ties with the religious sector, that they became sufficiently confident to seek an end to the Pahlavi dynasty altogether. tion\n\nThroughout this period, Iran's crisis was gradually transformed into a crisis\n\nof participaof the system\n\nPSEUDOPARTICIPATION AND COUNTERMOBILIZATION\n\n41\n\nas a whole. In May of 1977, a group of 53 attorneys called for an investigation into the absence of impartiality in the judiciary.30 In June, the Writers' Association, long banned, sent an open letter to the prime minister signed by 40 of its members. Among their demands were regime recognition of their organization and greater cultural freedom. Three days later the National Front sent a similar letter, this time directly to the shah, asking for greater regime adherence to the constitution. The Group for Free Books and Thought was established by publishers seeking to eliminate and government control of publishing. In early censorship November a manifesto, a signed by 56 people representing of groups, was circulated. variety It asked for a return to the constitution, an end to human rights violations, the of single-party abolition rule, the release of political prisoners, and free elections. Other groups composed of bazaaris, teachers, judges, doctors, university professors, and students were also active. The Iranian Bar Association headed by Hasan Nazih and Hedayatollah Matin-Daftari (a grandson of Mosaddeq) was particularly audible in its call for free elections of political and the release prisoners. On November 20, the Iranian Committee for Freedom and Human of Mehdi Bazargan. Rights was founded under the leadership Finally, on successive evenings from October 10 through October 19, 1977, a series of poetry readings sponsored was held at the Goethe Instiby the Writers' Association tute in Tehran.31 The poems read were extremely diverse, in their criticisms of the shah and the decline yet direct in the quality of life throughout Iran. And as 1977 came to an end with an attempt on the life of the shah's sister in France, and Jimmy Carter's now famous Niavaran Palace speech, time seemed to be running out for the monarch as to him grew dramatically.32 opposition Yet such opposition of a reformist was still nature.

Although there had been evidence of regime opposition emanating from the religious sector, primarily Ayatollah Khomeini in Najaf, the shah chose to attribute all opposition to the religious community while talking vaguely of \"Islamic Marxists.\" On January 7, 1978, the Tehran daily newspaper Ettela'at published a letter and personattacking Khomeini in a vicious al fashion. The letter is assumed to have been the work of the shah or one of his flunkies. During the following two days, riots of unanticipated severity swept the holy city of Qom by a citizenry outraged by the regime's attack on a respected religious leader. These riots were the start of a cycle of violent protests, and 40 days later, a commemorative gathering was held for those who died earlier. This Arba'in led to protest, further loss of life, another commemoration 40 days later, and so on. The attack of Khomeini in Ettela'at and the subsequent riots were an important watershed in the long history of to the Pahlavi dynasty, clerical opposition highlighting Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as the one religious leader from whom the regime had most to fear. While Khomeini has always been known as a political figure within Iran's religious community,33 by crudely attributing all regime oppoto the religious sition sector and to Khomeini particularly, the shah unwittingly provided a signpost delineating the as the \"official\" ayatollah head of a national opposition. This ineptitude on the part of the monarch in no way supports those who argue that he \"created Khomeini.\" The obviously slanderous Ettela'at letter served to ironically enhance the ayatollah's already substantial antiregime It also helped to initiate credentials.34 the counterwhich led to the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty. mobilization Countermobilization may simply be defined as the of social mobilization forces by counterelites against an existing political order.35 The needs of such counterelites are remarkably similar to those of a national elite, for in both cases mobilization on a mass level is sought, with support drawn from a broad cross-section of a society.

Unlike other revolutions undertaken by small cadres of professional in Iran was revolutionaries, the revolution For example, on Tasu'ah characterized by its broad base. 2 million and Ashura 1978, an estimated people marched through of Tehran in what the opposition the streets termed a referendum against the shah. Through its network of mullahs and mosques, the religious was able to generate mass opposition support on extremely short notice. Combined with this external pressure on the regime, large numbers of middle-class Iranians exerted internal pressure by work stoppages and antiregime activities from within the national bureaucracy itself. Algar provides a useful description of this countermobilization, stating: As for what we call in broad terms the [revolutionary] movement, people should not be under the illusion that this is a question of a formally organized movement with membership criteria, and so forth... it was a broad-based Islamic movement and not some kind of affair in which people sit down, as an examining body, and decide who is worthy to be admitted. What is necessary is to recruit, in an informal fashion, the massive support of the overwhelming majority of the people... .This is what happened in Iran. It is not that a secret party or organization was set up which brought more and more people into the fold .... The Revolution was genuinely a people's movement. One can say that the Islamic Revolution in Iran was an example of mass political participation and is unique in modern times.38 The broad base and general informality of the Iranian opposition made it almost impervious to regime attempts to quash it. And although Algar's emphasis on the role of Islam seems most appropriate for the lower classes. he PSEUDOPARTICIPATION AND COUNTERMOBILIZATION\n\n45\n\nrevolutionary of antishah, captures the spirit large segments of the Iranian which attracted\n\ncommitment population.\n\nConclusions\n\nthe poillustrated Events in Iran have dramatically highlightaccompanying social mobilization, liticization may lead to politing the manner in which \"modernization\" was in large part an outThe revolution ical instability. that gave rise to political growth of social mobilization among those sectors most exposed to moderniexpectations sectors, as well as resentment among traditional zation, at regime attempts to bypass or eradicate who bristled Rapid economic development is often rules. their societal good, but the presumed by modernizers to be an unmitigated A refor re-evaluation. gives cause Iranian experience gime that puts its faith in what it imagines to be the economic growth, may of accelerated potential stabilizing the More importantly, more than it expects. be getting mechanisms may magnify rather absence of participatory thus exacerbating popular dissatisfaction, than ameliorate the needs of the by frustrating popular dissatisfaction if not resolved. people to have their problems recognized, in the found expression In Iran, the hunger to participate and popuopportunity, economic equality, call for justice, When lar input into numerous aspects of state management. or seems to exist without a corsuch input does not exist, of a crisis on governmental policies, responding influence In the Iranian case, it can be may emerge. participation was more than mere of participation argued that this crisis of formalized particiabsence the over distress monoscopic inabilpatory mechanisms per se, but rather the collective or improve the quality of life ity of Iranians to influence of parunderstanding Such an ecological in their country. one, helps to as opposed to a more mechanistic ticipation, ensocial of widely different explain countermobilization Opponents of the shah simply into antishah activity. tities practice, political conventional ignored and circumvented expressources of political instead on alternative relying secon the capacity of the religious sion and, ultimately, to the Pahlavi dynasty. mass opposition tor to orchestrate IRANIAN STUDIES\n\n46\n\nFinally, there is much to be learned from the role in the Iranian revolution.

In the United States, the so-called Moral Majority actively contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan and the defeat of several legislators whose stands on various morally significant issues were unacceptable to it. A nervous Polish government followed the visit of a Polish pope to Poland half expecting religious-based protest in what is supposed to be a \"Godless\" communist society. In Israel, religious extremists are trying to annex the West Bank, which they feel has been promised them by God. And in addition to the religiousin Iran, we have seen an attack on the based revolution Grand Mosque in Mecca, an Islamic Brotherhood in Syria that is trying to topple an unpopular Alawite ruling elite, and attacks on Libya's Col. MuammarQaddafi, who has tried to reof classical place important portions Islamic doctrine with his Green Book. Muslim rebels have been active in the Philippines, Turks in eastern Anatolia have gone on the offensive against the imposed secularism and anticlericalism of Ataturk's while various Islamic-based successors, oppositionist groups in Egypt have attacked Anwar Sadat for his separate peace with Israel and insensitivity to the travails of Palestinian nationalism. Thus, we can talk not only of Islamic \"revival\" or \"resurgence,\" the so-called for Islam has been vital for hundreds of years, but of a more generalized growth in world religiosity. Daniel Levine has correctly captured the spirit of such activity in his essay, \"Religion and Politics, Politics and Religion,\" in which he the ways these two seemingly discrete discusses human endeavors are inextricably linked while influencing one another.39 Characterizations of the Iranian revolution in the West are often inaccurate and ignorant, missing the fundamental role that religion has played as a source of strength and sustenance for adherents of innumerable faiths over countless centuries in all corners of the world. Recommitments may have their place in the modernizaligious tion process, serving as a refuge from the more dehumanizing and anomic aspects of dramatic and rapid social change. PSEUDOPARTICIPATION\n\nAND COUNTERMOBILIZATION\n\n47\n\nMoreover, in light of the absence of conventional participatory mechanisms, formalized religious organizations can, and in the view of some religious leaders should, act as vehicles for improving the quality of life of their adherents. In some societies such religious-based political activity can serve as an accurate reflection of wider social needs while at the same time leading to dramatic political consequences. In part, this was the case in Iran.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.\n\nFor an analysis emphasizing popular frustrations over relative deprivation see, Ted Gurr, Why Men Rebel (Princeton, 1969); for a state apparatus under pressure from the international system see, Theda Skocpol, and Social States of France, Russia\n\nRevolutions: and China\n\nA Comparative\n\nAnalysis\n\n(New York, 1979); for imcirculation peded elite see, Vilfredo Pareto, The Mind and Society (New York, 1935) or Robert Putnam, The Comparative Study of Political Elites (Englewood Cliffs, 1976); and for conflict between social classes see, V.
