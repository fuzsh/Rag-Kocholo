The document discusses various terms used to describe Iranian peoples and civilization, including Persian, Kurd, Tajik, and Iranian. It argues that up until the 20th century, the term \"Persian\" was generally used to refer to anyone of Iranian origin, rather than just speakers of the Persian language. The document also notes that all Iranian peoples share a common origin and history, despite some promotion of separate identities in recent times. It aims to promote unity among Iranian peoples while respecting linguistic diversity.",
