        "text": "This article discusses Tolstoy’s faith in the unity of its two aspects: as the state of mind of its carrier and in terms of its content and the life principles that flow from it. It is shown that at the same time and in the same respect Tolstoy was the bearer of the faith and its investigator; therefore, its adequate interpretation is possible only if the principles established by him for himself are taken into account instead of an abstract and outward interpretation of what faith should be. The article considers, first, Tolstoy’s explanation of faith in various works, letters, diaries, and the like during the last thirty years of his life; and second, his distinctive expressions of faith along with discussions of it. The article demonstrates the equivalence of Tolstoy’s state of mind and the content of his faith, as well as its purely individual character. The study concludes with a discussion of the significance of Tolstoy’s understanding of faith for us today.\n\nThroughout his life, Tolstoy had an abiding interest in religious faith and Christian teaching. His interpretation of faith and the Christian teaching was a supreme manifestation of his love of freedom, which formed its main motive and substance. Tolstoy made a long journey to attain faith, the journey that to him was a search for the meaning of life. Faith as Tolstoy understood it was a way of attaining the “I.” Tolstoy’s theology of freedom is based on mutually exclusive principles: faith is life in the perspective of infinity; it liberates man from the temporariness of this world and thus of the fear of death; Christianity makes a person free because it is based on the sole truth, love as the essence of God and man; love is the motive force of freedom. Keywords: Christianity, Leo Tolstoy, freedom, God, faith, love, religion, religious tolerance\n\nThis is a conference paper. Further details of the conference can be found at: http://www.ipsa.org/site/content/view/110/69/lang,en/ and http://hdl.handle.net/2134/6700. In the last thirty years of his life, Leo Tolstoy wrote countless books, essays and pamphlets expounding his radical religious and political views. In these, Tolstoy expresses his deep discontent with the state, with the church, with the economy and with revolutionaries, and he formulated a strategy for change based on his understanding of Christianity. This paper argues that many of his criticisms hold as true today as they did when he penned them a century ago, and that therefore Tolstoy’s political thought has not lost any of its relevance in the twenty-first century. The state – whether autocratic or democratic – continues to use violence or the threat of it to impose its will upon those who dissent from its agenda. The church continues to pay little attention to what Tolstoy sees as the clear and truly revoluti...\n\nBrief Sketch of the Life and Times of Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy Tolstoy's midlife crisis wasn't that unusual. Studies show that after professionals like doctors put in tremendous efforts in achieving their goal of becoming doctors, they often feel a let down when they reach their goal. They put in long hours at hospitals as interns as well as tedious hours studying and all that - but when they become established and successful as doctors, they often have let downs, become depressed or spiral into mid-life cycles. The conclusion that many psychologists come to is that it is the striving that makes people happy much more than reaching a goal. That is when people reach a goal, they ask themselves, is this all there is to life? Tolstoy, after he achieved amazing fame and recognition after publishing War and Peace, got depressed and went into an identity-spiritual crisis. What made his historical was first his fame as a writer, second that he was Russian aristocracy who rejected the aristocratic way of life, and third his unique way of resolving a spiritual struggle that lasted for many long years. The life and development of Lev Tolstoy, the novelist and radical Christian was woven into the fabric of Russian Culture and History. After Tolstoy published his epic novel War and Peace and gained wealth and fame, Tolstoy experienced a severe identity-spiritual crisis. He became despondent and suicidal. Tolstoy was perhaps the ultimate rational and logical individual. He concluded that the petty desires of greed, lust, and fame were reprehensible and meaningless. He proceeded to rationally analyze meaning and concluded that rationalism does not in and of itself generate meaning. He finally reached the conclusion that through faith alone does one find true meaning. In his book, Confessions, which is an account of his personal spiritual struggles, Tolstoy observes, “Thus in addition to rational knowledge, which I had hitherto thought to be the only knowledge, I was inevitably led to acknowledge that there does exist another kind of knowledge – an irrational one – possessed by humanity as a whole: faith, which affords the possibility of living.” (Conf p. 53) As a result of his identity-spiritual crisis and his incredibly intense personal search for the meaning of life, Lev Tolstoy became not just a Christina – but a radical Christian – which eventually gave birth to the what is called the Tolstoyan Movement which was a radical “Christian” movement of the times."
