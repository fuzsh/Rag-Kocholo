Bosworth This volume of al-lhbari 's History has a particularly wide sweep and interest. It provides the most complete and detailed historical source for the Persian empire of the Sismids , whose four centuries of rule were one of the most glorious periods in Persia 's long history. It also gives information on the history of p re-Islamic Arabs of the Mesopotamian desert fringes and eastern Arabia (in al-Iftra and the Ghass nid kingdom), and on the quite separate civilization of South Arabia, the Yemen, otherwise known mainly by inscriptions. it furnishes details of the centuries '-long warfare of the two great empires of Western Asia, the SdsAnids and the Byzantine Greeks, a titanic struggle which paved the way for the subsequent rise of the new faith of Islam . The volume is thus of great value for scholars, from Byzantinists to Semitists and Iranists . It provides the first English translation of this key section of al-lkbarl's work , one for which non-Arabists have hitherto relied on a partial German translation , meritorious for its time but now 120 years old. This new translation is enriched by a detailed commentary which takes into account up-to-date scholarship.\n\nSUNY Series in Near Eastern Studies Said Amin Ariomand, Edkor\n\nThe State University of New York Press\n\n90000>\n\n9\n\n443569\n\nTHE HISTORY OFAL-f'ABARI AN ANNOTATED TRANSLATION\n\nVOLUME V The Sasanids, the Byzantines, the Lakhmids, and Yemen\n\nThe History of al-Tabari Editorial Board Ihsan Abbas, University of Jordan, Amman C.

Jarir al -Tabari (839-923), here rendered as The History of al-Tabari, is by common consent the most important universal history produced in the world of Islam. It has been translated here in its entirety for the first time for the benefit of non-Arabists , with historical and philological notes for those interested in the particulars of the text. In his monumental work al-Tabari explores the history of the ancient nations, with special emphasis on biblical peoples and prophets, the legendary and factual history of ancient Iran, and, in great detail, the rise of Islam, the life of the Prophet Muhammad, and the history of the Islamic world down to the year 915. The first volume of this translation contains a biography of al-Tabari and a discussion of the method, scope, and value of his work. It also provides information on some of the technical considerations that have guided the work of the translators . The thirty-ninth volume is a compendium of biographies of early members of the Muslim community, compiled by al-Tabari; although not strictly a part of his History, it complements it.\n\nThe History has been divided here into thirty-nine volumes, each of which covers about two hundred pages of the original Arabic text in the Leiden edition. An attempt has been made to draw the dividing lines between the individual volumes in such a way that each is to some degree independent and can be read as such. The page numbers of the Leiden edition appear in the margins of the translated volumes.\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nAl-Tabari very often q otes his sources verbatim and traces the chain of transmission (is dd) to an original source. The chains of transmitters are, for the sake of brevity, rendered by only a dash (-) between the individual links in the chain . Thus, \"According to Ibn Humayd- Salamah-Ibn Ishaq \" means that al-Tabari received the report from Ibn Humayd, who said that he was told by Salamah, who said that he was told by Ibn Ishaq, and so on. The numerous subtle and important differences in the original Arabic wording have been disregarded. The table of contents at the beginning of each volume gives a brief survey of the topics dealt with in that particular volume. It also includes the headings and subheadings as they appear in alTabari's text, as well as those occasionally introduced by the translator. Well-known place names, such as, for instance , Mecca, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Damascus, and the Yemen, are given in their English spellings. Less common place names , which are the vast majority, are transliterated. Biblical figures appear in the accepted English spelling. Iranian names are usually transcribed according to their Arabic forms, and the presumed Iranian forms are often discussed in the footnotes. Technical terms have been translated wherever possible, but some, such as dirham, and imam, have been retained in Arabic forms . Others that cannot be translated with sufficient precision have been retained and italicized, as well as footnoted.\n\nThe annotation is aimed chiefly at clarifying difficult passages, identifying individuals and place names, and discussing textual difficulties. Much leeway has been left to the translators to include in the footnotes whatever they consider necessary and helpful. The bibliographies list all the sources mentioned in the annotation.\n\nThe index in each volume contains all the names of persons and places referred to in the text, as well as those mentioned in the notes as far as they refer to the medieval period. It does not include the names of modem scholars . A general index, it is hoped, will appear after all the volumes have been published.

Instead, although we do not get the year -by-year treatment of events used for post -Islamic times, we emerge instead into something that is recognizable as real history: the origins of the successors to the Parthian Arsacids of Persia, the Sasanids, and the subsequent four centuries ' history of the dynasty; the Sasanids' sporadic episodes of warfare with the Romans/Byzantines, and, on the eastern frontiers of the Sasanid empire, occasional wars with the peoples of Inner Asia , the Turin of Firdawsi's version of the Persian national epic, the Shah-ndmah; the Sasanids' attempts to maintain a buffer-state on the desert fringes of Mesopotamia in the shape of the Arab Lakhmid princes who, it was hoped, would protect Mesopotamia from depredations by the Bedouins of inner Arabia ; the Sasanids' installing of military bases on the western shores of the Persian Gulf in order to turn the gulf into a Persian lake, safe for their commerce; from the fifth century onwards, an interventionist policy across central Arabia , culmi-\n\nxvi Translator's Foreword nating in the Persian occupation of Yemen in 570 for some sixty years; but then, at the end , the sudden disintegration of the empire at the hands of first the Byzantines and then the Muslim Arabs. This section of al-Tabari 's work is thus by no means exclusively concerned with the affairs of the Persian imperial heartland proper, the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia, where the capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon lay, but is to a considerable extent concerned with its western and southwestern fringes; that is, the Roman/ Byzantine provinces of eastern Anatolia and the Semitic Near East, including such ruling Arab families as the Lakhmids of alII Iirah and the chiefs of Kindah of the family of Hujr Akil al-Murar in central Arabia. Much of the material in al-Tabarl on the Sasanids' external relations can be corroborated or amplified from outside contemporary or near-contemporary sources . For the warfare with the Romans /Byzantines, there is a rich array of Byzantine chroniclers, some of them, like Procopius, closely connected with the military commanders concerned or, like Agathias , with a special channel of communication for knowledge of Persian affairs. For the Arabian peninsula, there is a fair amount of Arabic information, admittedly post-Islamic in the form we know it, about the Lakhmid kings and the chiefs of Kindah , arising out of the Arabs' passion for genealogical information and its historical background and out of the need to elucidate the background of poetic activity at the court of al-Hirah or in the person of a poet-chief like Imru' al-Qays. In his translation, Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden ( see on this, below), Noldeke omitted some sections of al-Tabarl 's material on pre-Islamic Yemen , since he considered it as \"zu fabelhafte \" ( 88017-8824, but with 88119-8824 inserted out of order in his translation at 147-48; 89o4 -89214; 9011-91717 . He also omitted as irrelevant to his general topic 96615-9812, on the miraculous birth and early upbringing of the Prophet Muhammad, and the closing section in this Prima series, vol. 2, 106917- 107220, on the chronology of the world from Adam to the Prophet's birth . With regard to the South Arabian material, during the 1870s, with little more secondary material available on the history of the pre-Islamic Arabs than A. P. Caussin de Perceval's attempt at making historical bricks without straw, his Essai sur l 'histoire des Arabes avant 1 'Islamisme, pendant 1'epoque de Mahomet et jusqu 'd la reduction de toutes les tribus\n\nTranslator's Foreword xvii sous la loi musulmane (Paris 1847 -48), this must have seemed substantially the case. Only from the early 187os, through the pioneer efforts of scholarly travelers like Halevy in copying inscriptions on the spot, with his subsequent decipherment of the script and then further elucidation of the material by D. H . Muller and others, did knowledge begin to emerge of the rich but patchy heritage of South Arabian inscriptions (and also, around this time, of inscriptions in other languages of the peninsula like Thamudic, Lihyanitic, Safaitic, etc. ). Noldeke was of course aware of the pioneer discoveries and publications here , but the material was still meager in quantity and philologically difficult to evaluate . During the course of the present century, the study of Epigraphic South Arabian has emerged as a fully grown branch of Semitic studies, and we now have confirmation -if at times in an allusive rather than direct manner-of several apparently \"fabelhafte\" events in al-Tabari's presentation of South Arabian history. Nor should one forget the significant quantity of material in Syriac and other languages of the Christian Orient that has now come to light and has illuminated the formation of an indigenous Christian church in Southwestern Arabia and such episodes as the struggle for political power and influence there involving such outside powers as Abyssinia, Byzantium, and Persia. Even the history of the lands beyond Persia's northeastern frontier has had a certain amount of fresh illumination thrown upon it by recent work on the Western Turk empire and on the Kushans , Kidarites, and Hephthalites, utilizing the results of such disciplines as archaeology, numismatics, and epigraphy; and the emergence in the last decade of material from a family archive in what is now northern Afghanistan will almost certainly increase our knowledge of the history and language of Bactria, the later Islamic Tukharistan, in its preIslamic phase. We have been talking about the peripheries of Persia, but there remains central to this section of al-Tabari 's History the Persian and Mesopotamian core of the Sasanid empire. The populations and resources of these territories, the firm social structure, the cohesive power within society of the Zoroastrian state church and its ethos, the richness of the irrigated lands of the Sawad of Iraq and the oases of the Iranian plateau, all these provided the motive power for Sasanid expansionism and military success. For nearly\n\nxviii Translator's Foreword four centuries there was a perceptible trend of Sasanid military success over the Romans/Byzantines: in the great battleground of Upper Mesopotamia, the Persian captured Nisibis in 363 and held it continuously thereafter as a bastion of Persian power threatening the Greeks, with the supreme success of final breakthrough in 614. Recently, James Howard-Johnston has perceptively weighed up the comparative positions and roles of the two great empires of the Near and Middle East, concluding that it was above all the Persians ' possession of Mesopotamia, with its populousness, its advanced, irrigated agriculture and its position at the head of the Persian Gulf with trade routes stretching thither from the Eastall these advantages complementing the results of a similar exploitation of the oasis economies of the Iranian plateau-which gradually gave the Sasanids the edge over Byzantium, enabling inter alia the emperors to use the threat of renewed military action to impose humiliating, tribute-paying conditions on the Greeks.' Unfortunately, our knowledge of whole stretches of Sasanid internal history and of the mechanisms driving the empire remains very imperfect. Such basic topics as the nature of the social structure and the roles of the aristocracy, gentry, priesthood, and merchants, and the nature of the landholding and financial system on which the state apparatus rested, continue to excite discussion and controversy among scholars. Sources of information like that from the rich corpus of Sasanid royal and priestly inscriptions and reliefs, the testimony of coins and sealings, the material concerning subordinate faiths of the empire such as that from the conciliar acts of the Nestorian Church and from the Babylonian Talmud, have all been carefully sifted, but cannot compensate for the almost total absence of contemporary records and literature in Middle Persian; and the exact dating and provenance of such exiguous material as we do have, like the Letter of Tansar (see on this p. 17 n. 66, below) continue to be debated. Hence the continued, central importance of al-Tabari's historical information on Sasanid history, supplemented by equally valuable if scantier information in writers like Ibn Qutaybah, al-Ya`qubi, al-Dinawari, al-Mas`udi, and Hamzah al-Isfahan. r. Howard-Johnston, \"The Two Great Powers in Late Antiquity: A Comparison,\" 18o-97.\n\nTranslator's Foreword xix It is undeniably true, as Howard-Johnston has again observed, that the version of Sasanid history that reached al-Tabari from one or other versions of the Khwaday-namag or Book of Kings, probably from that translated into Arabic by the late Umayyad writer In al-Muqaffa', almost certainly involved much distortion, suppression, and invention ? The penchant for entertaining anecdotes, memorable sayings , curiosa, moralizing tales, and the like, which seem to go back to the Book of Kings's Pahlavi original, was characteristic also of early Arabic udaba' or litt6rateurs. In his endeavor to produce a plausible, straightforward historical narrative, al-Tabari must have tried valiantly to cut his way through a mass of entertaining but historically irrelevant information presented to him in these royal annals, but he could not entirely break free of the adab tradition (cf. his inclusion of the totally unhistorical story of Shabur U's wandering disguised in the Roman camp and capture, p. 6o below, and the tale of Kawad I's escape from imprisonment at the end of the interregnum of Jamasp's rule, p. 13 S below ). Al-Tabari's efforts at pruning less relevant material can be seen in the shortened Persian translation produced by Abu `Ali Bal'ami (see on this, below), in which the Samanid vizier put back in his narrative certain items from the Sasanid historical tradition where he thought al-Tabari had pruned it overzealously . The fact that anecdotal material of the examples given above remained in al-Tabari's History detracts only a little from confidence in his search for sober history.\n\nThere is nevertheless a certain unevenness of treatment, perhaps inevitable considering the material within al-Tabari's hands. Sometimes confirmation or amplification of incidents in alTabari's narrative can be found in, for example, the Greek , Syriac, or Armenian sources, but when the internal history of the Sisk-Ad empire did not impinge upon or affect the Christians of Persia, there was little reason for Eastern Christian sources to notice events there. Hence we are left with many blank or little-known periods in Sasanid history, such as the reigns of Bahram II in the later third century (covering seventeen years), of Bahram IV at the end of the fourth century (eleven years) and of Yazdagird II in the\n\n2. Ibid., 170-72.\n\nxx Translator's Foreword mid fifth century (almost two decades), skated over by al-Tabari (see pp. 46, 69, io6-io9 below). For a crucial subject like Khusraw Anusharwan's financial, tenurial, and military reforms, vital for our understanding of the internal dynamics of the later Sasanid empire, we are still largely dependent on al-Tabari's account; it is detailed and informative, but capable of varying interpretation, and hence has not surprisingly attracted a substantial body of comment and interpretation (see p. 258 n. 624, below). The same applies to the slightly earlier episode of Mazdak and his religiosocial movement in the reign of Kawad I and the earlier part of Anusharwan's reign, which has given rise to widely varying interpretations, often not unconnected with the political and social views of the scholars concerned (see p. 132 n. 342, below).\n\nWe must be grateful to al-Tabari for preserving as much as he did of hard historical material, among the less valuable episodes of his History that were meant more for entertainment than instruction. Writing a history of the Sasanids without the Arabic chronicles, even though these last date from two or three centuries after the empire's demise, would be a daunting task. II The achievement of Theodor Noldeke (1836-1930 in producing in 1878 his Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden and its stupendous commentary, was uniformly praised on its publication (save for one petulant French reviewer, although one recalls that this was only seven years after the French loss of Alsace-Lorraine to the German empire and that Noldeke was at that moment sitting in Alsace in a professorial chair at Strassburg/Strasbourg University). In his extended review article of the work, Alfred von Gutschmid stated that Noldeke's utilization of al-Tabari had made it possible for the first time to write a real history of the Sasanids 3 Succeeding generations of scholars-and not only orientalists but those from other disciplines like Byzantine studies-have continued to use Noldeke's work and will doubtless continue to do so, when so 3. See F.-C. Muth, Die Annalen von at-Tabari im Spiegel der europaischen Bearbeitungen, 57 and nn. 323-37.\n\nTranslator's Foreword xxi much of the material he brought to bear on the elucidation and amplification of the Arabic text, that from the Greek, Latin, Syriac, Hebrew, Georgian, and Armenian sources (the latter via his Berlin colleague von Gutschmid), remains still valid. Noldeke himself regarded his translation as perhaps his chef d'oeuvre.4 Nevertheless, a plethora of new information has emerged in the intervening rzo years, and this needs to be integrated with any new translation of the Arabic text. Today we live in an age of many specialists but not of polymaths like Noldeke. How can any single person nowadays-not least the present `abd 1iagirattempt to gather up and integrate all this new information? Thus as noted above, since Noldeke's time, a whole new field within Semitic studies, that of Epigraphic South Arabian and South Arabian history, has emerged and matured. The obvious answer to the problem would be a team of experts collaborating on the project of a translation plus a commentary that would almost certainly exceed by many times the length of the translation itself. Such projects are easy to conceive but hard to finance and even harder to realize. The final volume of the History of al-Tabari project cannot wait a further twenty years or so, which is what such a team of experts in different fields might well require (though Noldeke finished his translation in one year!); and their finished product would almost inevitably be outdated in many respects before the end of the period of time involved. Hence the present work is offered now for readers' consideration as one which had to be completed within a period of two years only. The present translator and commentator is conscious of whole areas of new scholarship which should, in ideal conditions, be brought into consideration for the commentary; for instance, much exciting and relevant work is coming out of the Workshops on Late Antiquity and Early Islam, and this has been only partially tapped. But a halt must be called at some point, and I have reluctantly arrived at this, whether the achievement is worthwhile, the reader must judge for himself.\n\n4. His view here was expressed in a letter to Goldziher, cited by F. Rosenthal, The History of al-Tabari, an Annotated Translation. I. General Introduction and From the Creation to the Flood, 144 n. 469.\n\nxxii Translator's Foreword The generations of Arabists who have used Noldeke's Geschichte cannot have failed to be impressed by the degree of accuracy which he achieved in his translation.5 Where, as with so much of pre-Islamic poetry, replete as it is with recondite allusions, often totally unrecoverable today, doubt and uncertainty remained, he noted this. Since he actually published the translation a year before the appearance of the edited text (volume 1 of the Prima Series) on which it was based, a more complete understanding of the text led him on occasion to revise his translation (see, e.g., p. 65 n. 177 below). But such occasions were few and far between. What has happened since Noldeke's time is that several Arabic texts that he had to use in manuscript, such as Ibn Qutaybah's `Uyun al-akhbdr, al-Ya`qubi's Ta'rikh, al-Dinawari's alAkhbdr al-tiwdl, and various poetical diwdns, have now been critically edited, and wherever possible, I have taken advantage of improved readings in these editions. When the project for an edition of the History was first mooted in the early 1870s under the stimulus of the Leiden Arabist M. J. de Goeje,6 Noldeke undertook to edit the section on the Sasanids (Prima series, 813-1067) and, after the unexpected death of Otto Loth, the ensuing section 1067-1572; that is, up to almost the end of the events of A.H. 6. Basically, Noldeke had at his disposal for the section on the Sasanids the three manuscripts (i) L = Leiden 497, covering the whole period except for a lacuna at 87812-89917; (2) C = Constantinople/Istanbul, Koprulii 1040; and (3) T and t = Tubingen Ma. VI, 2 (Wetzstein Collection), with two parts, the second copied later than the first. Other manuscripts in part supplemented these, including P = Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, ancien fonds 627 (a manuscript cognate with L), from 89912 (i.e., soon after the beginning of the reign of Khusraw I Anusharwan); and BM = British Library, Add. 23,263, from 9159 (i.e., in the section on the Tubba` king of Yemen As'ad Abu Karib). Noldeke also mentioned that he had found useful Ibn Hisham's version of Ibn 5. Cf. Irfan Shahid, \"Theodor Noldeke's'Geschichte der Perser and Araber,' an Evaluation,\" 119-21. 6. See on the project and its genesis, Introductio, pp. xxn-xxxv; J. W. Fuck, Die arabischen Studien in Europa bis in den Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, 212-14; Muth, Die Annalen von al-Tabari, 8-13; Rosenthal, The History of al-Tabari, an Annotated Translation, I, 141-42.\n\nTranslator's Foreword xxiii Ishaq's Sfrat al-nabi (available in the printed edition of 1858-6o by F. Wustenfeld); the anonymous history contained in the manuscript Sprenger 30 (in the collection acquired in 1858 from Sprenger by the Prussian State Library in Berlin , and still unpublished; it corresponds to one of the two main versions used by al-Tabari for the history of the Sasanids; see on the work the dissertation of J. G. Rothstein , De chronographo arabo anonymo, qui codice Berolinensi Sprengriano tricesimo continetur ); and the Gotha manuscript 24-25 of Bal'ami's abbreviated, and in places slightly amplified, Persian translation of al-Tabari 's History (H. Zotenberg's French translation was not published until 186774).7 The Cairo 1960-69 text of al-Tabari 's History by the veteran Egyptian editor Muhammad Abu al -Fall Ibrahim, which incorporates some readings from Istanbul Topkapi Saray manuscripts and certain other ones, has been compared by the present translator with the Leiden text; the additional information gleaned has, however, proved negligible. The rendering of Arabic names and terms follows the usual system of The History of al-Tabarf. In regard to Epigraphic South Arabian, I have endeavored to follow the generally acknowledged system as exemplified in A. F. L. Beeston's Sabaic Grammar. It is the rendering of pre-Islamic Iranian names and terms that causes difficulties, and no watertight system seems possible here. At the suggestion of Mr F. C. de Blois, for the spelling of Middle Persian words and names I have endeavored to follow the principles laid down by D . N. MacKenzie in his A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary (cf. his exposition of the ambiguities and difficulties involved in handling the Pahlavi script, Introduction, pp. x-xv) and now generally accepted by specialists; namely, a strict distinction between transliteration of the consonantal script and transcription of the reconstructed Sasanid pronunciation . For example, the name of the first Sasanid ruler is transliterated 'rthstr but transcribed as ArdaxÂ§ir. His father's name is transliterated p'pky but transcribed as Pabag. ArdaxMir's son's name is spelled etymologically as Shpwlhly (for Sah + puhr), and the contemporary Sasanid pronunciation was ^abuhr, as we know from the Manichaean Middle Per7. See Introductio, pp. L-Ln, and for Bal'ami's translation specifically, Muth, Die Annalen von at-Tabari, 20-27.\n\nxxiv Translator's Foreword sian spelling . 'bwhr; although in the commentary to al-Tabari's History I have used the later Middle Persian (and early New Persian) form for this last name of Shabur, as being closer to the Arabic version of the name. A further slight anomaly is that I have used the later form Ardashir rather than the strictly correct, earlier form Ardakhshir, as again reflecting early New Persian usage and as being also the familiar Arabic equivalent. Such institutions as the John Rylands University Library, Manchester; the Widener Library, Harvard University ; and the Oriental Institute Library, Oxford, have aided completion of the work. Several colleagues have been helpful in making books available to me, providing xeroxes of articles difficult of access to me, sending offprints of their own articles, and giving information and guidance on various obscure or contested points. Thus I am grateful to Mr. Mohsen Ashtiany (Columbia University); Dr. S. P. Brock (Oxford University ); Dr. Paul M . Cobb (Wake Forest University, N.C.); the Rev. Professor J. A. Emerton (Cambridge University); Dr. G. Greatrex (University of Wales, Cardiff); Dr. R. G . Hoyland (Oxford University); Dr. Ph . Huyse (Paris); Mr. M. C . A Macdonald (Oxford); Prof. D. N. MacKenzie (Anglesey); Dr. M. I . Mochiri (Paris ); Professor Chr. Robin ( CNRS, Aix-en-Provence ); Professor N. Sims-Williams ( SOAS, London); Professor G. Rex Smith (Manchester University ); and Professor Edward Ullendorff (Oxford). My colleague in Manchester, Professor W. C. Brice, has drawn the maps in an expert fashion . In particular, Mr. F. C . de Blois (Royal Asiatic Society, London ), with his special expertise in such fields as Iranian, South Arabian, and Syriac studies, has been kind enough to read through a draft of the commentary and to make a considerable number of corrections and valuable suggestions for improvement; some of these are explicitly acknowledged in the commentary, but there are many other, unacknowledged places where he has saved me from error or has enriched the documentation. Hence I am deeply grateful to him. But at the end, the usual confession must be made : responsibility for the final product remains my own.\n\nC. Edmund Bosworth\n\nTable r.

Al-Tabari intends by this term, as he has earlier explained (I, 706), the Parthians or Arsacids, considered as regional powers in comparison with such universal monarchs as the Achaemenid emperors of Persia and Alexander the Great. The SasSnids themselves regarded the \"Party Kings,\" comprising the Arsacids' predecessors the Seleucids (in fact, little known in Iranian historical tradition ) and the Arsacids themselves, as an interruption in the development through the ages, from legendary times onward, of the legitimate, unified Persian monarchy, even though the Arsacids ruled for the very respectable span of 474 years . But historical mention of the Achaemenids in indigenous Persian sources seems to be exiguous, beyond some knowledge of the last kings, the Dares (Darius III being the only monarch mentioned, e.g., in Zoroastrian sources like the Denkard and the Bundahisn, and in Firdawsi's Shdh-ndmah) (M. A. Dandamayev and V . G. Lukonin, however, have suggested that, in the Sasanid national consciousness, these two Darius were in any case attached to the Kayanids ; see their The Culture and Social Institutions of Ancient Iran, 372-73). The problem has exercised modern scholars, who have tended to draw the conclusion that the Sasanids had little or no knowledge of the Achaemenids, hence could not in any significant way have considered themselves as heirs of the Achaemenids. The arguments have been set forth and discussed, with a wealth of pertinent information, by Ehsan Yarshater in his \"Were the Sasanians Heirs to the Achaemenids? \" 517-39, and his \"Iranian National History,\" 378; and cf. A. Christensen, Les Kayanides, 35-43 . Subsequent Iranian historical scholarship has overwhelmingly endorsed Yarshater 's view; see, e.g., G. Gnoli, The Idea of Iran, 136-38; J. WiesehOfer, Die 'dunklen Jahrhunderte' des Persis, 19i and idem, Ancient Persia from 5 yo B.C. to 650 A.D.,167-69 . Only Touraj Daryaee has recently challenged this consensus, assembling references to the\n\n[I, 813]\n\n2 [The Kings of the Persians] Israel, the Romans ( al-Rum), and the Arabs, up to the time of Ardashir.2\n\n[Ardashir I] When there had elapsed, according to what the Christians and the possessors of the early Scriptures relate, 523 years, but according to the Zoroastrians (al-Majus ), 266 years, since Alexander had taken control of the land of Babylon,3 there arose Ardashir, 4 son of Babak Shah, King of Khir, son of the younger Sasan, son of Babak, son of Sasan, son of Babak, son of M.h.r.m. s, son of Sasan, son of Achaemenids from earlier Sasanid sources , citing the veneration by the Sasanids of Persepolis as a sacred site ( but they regarded it as stemming from legendary or semilegendary times!) and suggesting that non -Persian authors such as Greek, Armenian, Jewish, and Muslim ones (including, of these last, the Khwarazmian alBiruni in his al-Athar al-bagiyah ) were well aware of the Achaemenids; see his \"National History or Keyanid History ? The Nature of Sasanid Zoroastrian Historiography,\" 129-41 . Nevertheless, as emphasized above, the weight of opinion concurs in the view that the Sasanids did not regard themselves as heirs to the Achaemenids, but to the Kayanids. 2. See The History of al-Tabari, vol. III, The Children of Israel, and vol . IV, The Ancient Kingdoms. 3. The chronology attributed by al-Tabari to the Christians here , and elsewhere, as the \"Years of Alexander,\" is based on the Seleucid era, that commemorating Seleucus I's assumption of power at Babylon , commonly fixed at i October 312 B.C. The Byzantine historian Agathias dated the beginning of Ardashir 's reign to the year 5 38 of the era of Alexander, i.e., A.D . 226-27, probably with Ardashir's coronation at Ctesiphon in mind ( cf. Averil Cameron, \"Agathias on the Sassanians ,\" 117). Interpretation of the bilingual , i.e., Parthian and Middle Persian , inscription at Blshapur would seem to point to the \"official \" beginning of the Sasanid dynasty's rule as being in the calendar year 27 September 223 to 25 September 224; but the topic remains uncertain and controversial . Since Alexander's era was considered to have begun with his accession, the traditional figure for the length of his reign, fourteen years (e.g., in al-Tabari, I, 702, citing \" the Persians\"), these years had to be subtracted from the known figure of 537 years to give 524 years as the interval separating Ardashir from Alexander ' s death. The lesser figure of the Magians or Zoroastrians given here reflects Sasanid ideological considerations , foreshortening the actual 474 years of Parthian rule in an attempt to depreciate the duration of their predecessors ' power (in reality, this had been longer than the rule of the Sasanids was to extend ). See Th . Noldeke, trans. i n. i; EIr s.v. Arsacids. V. The Arsacid Era, and VI. Arsacid Chronology in Traditional History (A. Sh. Shahbazi). 4. MP '.r. t.h.s.t.r, pronounced ArdaxÂ§ir, from a hypocoristic form *Rtax9ira of the full OP form * Rtaxsathra, i.e., Artaxerxes . The name had apparently continued in use among local princes of Fars during the Arsacid period , on numismatic evidence. See Noldeke, trans. i n. 2; D . Sellwood, \" Minor States in Southern Iran,\" 304-305 ; EIr, s. v. Ardaair I. i. History (J. Wiesehofer).\n\n[The Kings of the Persians]\n\n3\n\nKing Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, son of Bishtasb, son of Luhrasb, son of Kaywaji (?), son of Kaymanush. According to another genealogy, [he was] Ardashir, son of Babak, son of Sasan, son of Babak, son of Zara;, son of Biha-Afridh, son of the elder Sasan, son of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, son of Bishtasb, son of Luhrasb.s [He [8141 arose] in Fars seeking, as he alleged, to avenge the blood of his paternal cousin Dara, son of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, on whom Alexander had made war and had killed two of the latter's chief commanders. As he said, he wished to recover the royal power (or: the kingdom) for its rightful holders and for those who had held it continuously in the previous time of his predecessors and forefathers, before the \"Party Kings,\" and [wished] to gather it together again under one head and one monarch.6 It is mentioned that he was born in a village (qaryah) of the I^takhr region called Tirudih, situated in the rural district (rustaq)\n\n5. On the problems in the Sasanid genealogies, see G. Morrison, \"The Sassanian Genealogy in Mas 'udi,\" 42-44; R. N. Frye, The Heritage of Persia, 207-208; idem, \"The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians .\" 116-317 . The genealogies go back to personages like Zarir and Bihi-Afridh who were attached (nonhistorically) to the Arsacids, and then back to the legendary Kayanids, the Achaemenids having by Sisinid times (apart from the Dariuses ) receded into a legendary haze. See Noldeke, trans. 2, nn. 1-3, 3 n. i. The question of the nearer descent of Ardashir, whether Sasin was actually his grandfather or a more remote ancestor (the jadd of al-Tabari's text could imply either of these), or directly connected with the line of Pabag at all, has aroused considerable discussion, since the sources , literary and epigraphic, offer differing interpretations . Thus, noting the description of Sawn as a lord but with no explicit filiation of Pabag as the son of Sasin in the Ka'ba-yi Zardusht inscription at Naqshi Rustam, R. N. Frye is inclined to believe that Sawn was a remote ancestor whose name was used for the dynasty as a whole, just as the Achaemenids took their name from the totally obscure Haxamania/Achaemenes, while noting the epic tradition that, since Sasan died just after his son Ardashir's birth, the boy was adopted, following current Zoroastrian practice, as Pibag 's own son. The popular Persian tradition, exemplified in the Middle Persian romance, the Kar-namag-i Ardagir-i Pabagan, pace the view expressed here by al-Tabari, makes Ardashir the son of Sisan, the local ruler Pabag having given his daughter in marriage to Sasan after hearing of the latter's noble descent from Diri, i.e., the last Achaemenid Darius III (considered by the Sasanids as the last Kayanid king ). See the discussions in R. N. Frye, \"History and Sasanian Inscriptions,\" 215-16; idem, \"The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians,\" 116-17; EIr, s.v. Ardaair I. i. History (Wiesehbfer). 6. Again reflecting Sasinid imperial propaganda that Ardashir restored the unity of the state as the heir of earlier, pre-Arsacid rulers whom he now avenged on Artabanus V.\n\n4\n\n[The Kings of the Persians]\n\nof Khir7 in the administrative division (kurah) of Istakhr.s His grandfather Sasan was a courageous and mighty warrior whose courage and military might were such that he fought singlehanded eighty of the strong and valiant men of Istakhr and put them all to flight. His wife stemmed from one of the royal families in Fars called the B5zranjin . 9 She was named Rambihisht, and possessed beauty and perfection . Sasan was the custodian of the fire temple of Istakhr called that of Anahidh.10 He was also a devotee of the chase and of equestrian pursuits (a1-furusiyyah). 7. This town of Fars (other forms such as Khayr and Khiyar are found in the geographers) lay near the southeastern tip of Lake Bakhtigan in the district of Niriz, and marked a stage on the Shiraz- Kirman road. See G. Le Strange, The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate, 289-90; P. Schwarz, Iran im Mittelalter, 104-105. The location of Tirudih, and the exact form of its name , remain unclear. 8. In Sasanid times , Stakhr (thus written in Pahlavi script, stir ) was regarded as both the religious and political center for the dynasty , given the origins of the Sasanids themselves from the district . It lay on the Pulvar river north of Persepolis, and may have come into prominence after Alexander the Great 's destructions at Persepolis. In Islamic times, it remained moderately significant as the center of the kurah or administrative district (see on this term n. r 19 below ) of the same name but was gradually overshadowed by the foundation in early Umayyad times of Shiraz, which became the capital for the whole of Fars . See Noldeke, trans. 3 n. 2j Le Strange, Lands, 275-76; Schwarz, Iran, 13-16; W. Barthold, An Historical Geography of Iran, 151-53; E12, s.v. Istakhr (M. Streck-G. C. Miles ); Elr, s.v. Estakr (A. D. H. Bivar and Mary Boyce), This tradition identifying Tirudih as Ardashir's birthplace may well deserve credence; before the Sasanids , the Arsacids had continued to venerate their original home in northeastern Persia , on the evidence of Isidore of Charax. 9. The correct form of this name is unclear . Noldeke, trans. 4 n. i, compared it with a mountainous district of western Fars, Bazrang , mentioned by the Islamic geographers al-IStakhri and Ibn Hawgal (see Le Strange, Lands, 171-72; Schwarz, Iran, r 18-r9 ), so that we might possibly have a family name derived from a place. The Bazrangis were apparently a family of local potentates in Fars, acknowledging the Arsacids as their suzerains but in practice largely autonomous ; after the time of Ardashir, however, they disappear from historical record. See EIr, s.v. Bazrangi (R. N. Frye). Whether Ardashir really was related to one of these families cannot now be ascertained, but such a link is by no means improbable; A. von Gutschmid, \"Bemerkungen zu Tabari 's Sasanidengeschichte, ubersetzt von Th. Noldeke,\" 734, was less skeptical than Noldeke about such a possibility. ro. The Avestan Arodvi Sura Anahita \" mighty, immaculate one of the waters,\" a goddess of fertility, nurturer of crops and herds , and also of success in battle, MP Ardwisur Anahid, had also become identified with the Western Iranian Anahiti, apparently the goddess of the planet Venus . Venerated by the Achaemenids from the time of Artaxerxes II onward, the cult was popular among the early Sasanids, and Shapur I called his daughter and queen Adur Anahid , \"Fire (and) Anahid,\" i.e., this was a dvandva name, from the names of two deities . According to al-Tabari's source, presumably the Khwaday-namag or \"Book of Kings,\" Ardashir was now laying claim to custodianship of the fire temple that had grown out of a shrine to\n\n[The Kings of the Persians]\n\n5\n\nRambihisht provided Sasan with a son , Babak, whose hair, at the moment he was born, was already over a span long.\" When he reached the age of sound judgment , he assumed rule over the people after his father. Then his son Ardashir was born to him. The ruler of Iglakhr at that time was a man from the Bazranjin family called, according to what I have been told from information going back to Hisham b. Muhammad (i.e., In al-Kalbi), 12 Juzhir,13 Anahid, the beginning of a tradition among the Sasanids that their founder had been at once warrior hero, prince, and priest. See Nbldeke, trans . 4 n. 2; EIr, s.v. Anahid. i. Ardwisur Anahid (M. Boyce). 11. A legendary touch, like being born with a full set of teeth, presaging future strength and greatness . See N8ldeke, trans. 4, n. 3. 12. The major early Islamic historian of pre-Islamic Arabia, including Yemen and the fringes of the northern and central Arabian Desert facing the empires of the Byzantines and the Sasanids, and also a prime authority, as his magnum opus the Jamharat al-nasab shows, on Arab tribal genealogy and history , born in Kufah ca. 120/737 and died there in 204 /819 or 205 /821. His interest in pre-Islamic Arabian history seems to have arisen partly from a desire to elucidate the background of the Qur'an, and partly from his Kalbi family origins , for the Kalb had played a glorious role in South Arabian tribal history as the mainstay of the Qu4i'ah, and then in early Islamic times had been the principal military backing for the Umayyad caliphs in Syria. Moreover, his home town of al-Kafah lay close to al-I-I-irah, in preIslamic times the capital of the Lakhmid kings, whose history Hisham was especially concerned to elucidate (see, e.g., al-Tabari, I, 821-22, pp. 20-22 below). His interest here was such that he called one of his sons al-Mundhir , the name so typical of Lakhmid kings that they are often referred to as al -Manadhirah, and thus himself acquired the kunyah or patronymic of Abu al-Mundhir. This interest in the Lakhmids further gave him a desire to make available to his contemporaries in early 'Abbasid Iraq the history of the Lakhmids ' suzerains, the rulers of Persia . This explains why Hisham provided so much material for alTabari on the Persian monarchs (which al -Tabari, being himself of Iranian stock, was probably not averse from using); he wrote a special monograph, no longer extant, on the Parthian Arsacids, the Kitab Mulnk al-lawa'if. This material on the Lakhmids and Sasanids is much greater in quantity and richer in caliber than the exiguous material al-Tabari could find on the Ghassanids of Syria and their suzerains the Byzantines. Apart from his careful use of written sources, including historical traditions and narratives, akhbdr, derived from his father Muhammad, a noted Qur'anic scholar and exegete, Hishim apparently had access to some written documents on the Lakhmids still available in al-l Kirsh during his own lifetime. He combed local churches and monasteries for their inscriptions and for documents preserved there. He was especially familiar with the verses of the poet of the last Lakhmids at al-I-Iirah, 'Adi b. Zayd (seen. 116 below), but must have had the whole corpus of pre-Islamic poetry and that of the interval between the Jahiliyyah and the new Islamic dispensation, the mukhadram, at his fingertips. See on Hisham and his father Ibn al-Kalbi , trans. W. Caskel and G . Strenziok, Jamharat al-nasab, introduction; Fuat Sezgin, GAS, I, 268-71; A. A. Duri, The Rise of Historical Writing among the Arabs, 51-52, 146-47; Irfan Shahid, Byzantium\n\n6 [The Kings of the Persians]\n\n[8151 and, according to others, Juzhir. This last had a eunuch called Tira,14 whom he had appointed castellan (arjabadh)15 of Darabjird.I6 When Ardashir reached the age of seven years, his father took him to Juzhir, whose seat was at al-Bay4a',17 made his son stand before Juzhir, and asked the latter if he would attach the boy to Tira as a foster child of his and as the future castellan in Tira's stead. Juzhir agreed to his request and had the terms of the request written out for him in a formal sealed document (sijill).18 Babak and the Arabs in the Fourth Century, 349-66; E72, s.v. al-Kalb! (W. Ataullah). 13. Older forms Gochithr, Gochihr, rendered in Greek sources as Gosithres \"a former king of the Persians.\" It means \"whose seed is cattle,\" i.e., parent of the cattle, gao6ithra being used in the Avesta as an epithet of the moon. See Noldeke, trans. 4 n. 4; F. Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch, 110. No coins from Gochihr (or from any other Bazranjis) are extant, but his historical existence seems likely. 14. This name stems from such a compound name as Tir- dad \"given, created by Tir or Mercury.\" In Greek sources a king of Characene is named as Tiraios (from whom coins are known), and it may have been this ruler who gave his name to the Nahr Ti-rd or Tirin river or canal of early Islamic al-Ahwaz (Yaqut, Mu'jam albulddn, V, 319; Le Strange, Lands, 241; Schwarz, Iran, 308, 313-15). See Noldeke, trans. 4 n. 5; Justi, Namenbuch, 325, 326-27; P. Gignoux, Noms propres sassanides en moyen-perse epigraphique, no. 899. 15. Noldeke, trans. 5 n. r, took (h)argabadh to mean \"castellan,\" but the coexistence of the specific Middle Persian term dizbed, meaning \"commander of a fortress,\" led some scholars subsequently to doubt this interpretation and suggest a meaning like \"tax collector\" for an MP *hargbed. However, Christensen, L'Iran sous les Sassanides, 107, noted that, at the outset of the Sasanid state, it was an office held by the prince Ardashir (I) (see al-Tabari, I, 815, p. 7 below), and in EIr, s.v. Argbed, M.-L. Chaumont opts for the former meaning, \"commander of an arg,\" to use the NP term corresponding to MP *argbed. Both readings of the word are possible. It clearly became a very prestigious office, and later, al-Tabari, I, 869, p. 104 below, states that it was close in status to that of the commander-in-chief of the army. 16. A town and kiuah of eastern Fars, in modern times having the curtailed form Darab, corresponding to what in Seljuq and 11-Khanid times was known as the lands of the Shabankara'i Kurds. See Yaqut, Bulddn, ii, 446; Le Strange, Lands, 288-89; Schwarz, Iran, 92-97; EI2, s.v. Darabd'ird (D.N. Wilber). 17. Literally, \"the white [fortress, town, etc..\" a town of Fars lying to the north of Shiraz and in the Kimfiruz district. This region flourished as far back as Elamite times as that of Anshan (see EIr, s.v. Anshan [J. Hansman]), but al-Bayda' is today little more than a village. See Yaqut, Bulddn, I, 529; Le Strange, Lands, 280; Schwarz, Iran, 16-17, 54; Barthold, Historical Geography, 153, 161; EI2, s.v. al-BaySla' (0. Lofgren); EIr, s.v. Bayia (C. E. Bosworth). 18. Derived from Latin sigillum \"seal\" and then in Late Latin and Byzantine Greek usage applied to the document or scroll to which a seal had been affixed, this term came into Arabic certainly by Qur'anic times (cf. Sarah XXI, 104). It later acquired various technical legal and administrative senses. See E12 s.v. Sidjill. i. I{ur'anic and early Arabic usage (F. C. de Blois).\n\n[The Kings of the Persians] 7\n\ntook him along to Tira, who received him handsomely and adopted him as his own son. When Tina died, Ardashir took over his office, and performed the function admirably. A group of astrologers and diviners informed him that he had been born under an auspicious star and that he would rule the lands (sc., the whole of Iran). It is related that , after this, Ardashir behaved in a modest and unpretentious manner in pursuance of this forecast, and continued each day to grow in good deeds and conduct, and that he saw in a dream an angel sitting by his head who told him that God was going to give him rulership over the lands, so he was to prepare for this . When he awoke, he rejoiced at this and felt within himself power and great strength such as he had never before known. The first thing he did was to proceed to a place in the Darabjird district called Jubanan, 19 and killed a ruler there named FAsin.20 Then he went along to a place called Kun.s (?) and killed a ruler there called Manushihr,21 and after that to a place called L.r.wir (?),22 where he killed a ruler there named Dara .23 In all these places he appointed persons [as governors] responsible to him. He then wrote to his father (sc., to Babak) telling him what he had accomplished, and called upon him to rise up against Juzhir, who [816] r9. Literally, \" cowherds,\" MP â¢gobdnan, in this form or the singular Juban, is the name of several villages in Persia , cf. Yaqut, Bulddn, II, 176 ( Jubinan), N, 487 (Kuban(an)); but most probably here is meant what was in early Islamic times the town of Jubanan on the northern shore of Lake Bakhtigin (now, it seems, vanished from the map) and on the I*lakhr-Sirajan -Kirman road. See Noldeke, trans. 6 n. 3; Le Strange, Lands, 278-79, Schwarz, Iran, 1o9. 20. Thus the reading of the ms. Sprenger 30, an anonymous chronographical work (see Introductio, p. LII), i.e., Pisin, Pasin, a name familiar in the Iranian national legend, see Justi, Namenbuch, 252-5 3; but other mss. have readings that could be Wds.f.r (see text, n. g), cf. Wasbuhr, etc. 21. This name of a hero in the Iranian national legend (literally, \"from the race of Manu,\" in Indian legend, the first man; see Yarshater, \"Iranian National History,\" 433-35, and Gignoux, Noms propres sassanides, no. 559) is attested on preSasanid coins, or on coins roughly contemporary with the advent of Ardashir to power, issued by kings of Persis. See Noldeke, trans. p. 6 n. 6.\n\n22. Both Kun.s and Lurwir are unidentified. 23. This ancient name of Achaemenid kings had survived among local rulers during the Arsacid period, and one of these may have been the eponymous founder of Darabjird (according to the Middle Persian geography used by J. Markwart, ed. G. Messina, in his A Catalogue of the Provincial Capitals of Eranshahr, l9, by a Did, son of Dara), since names of towns composed of a personal name and the ending -gird do not occur before the time of Alexander the Great. See Noldeke, trans. 6 n. 7.\n\n8 [The Kings of the Persians]\n\nwas at al -Bayda'; this Babak did, killing him and seizing his crown,24 and then he wrote to Ardawan the Pahlawi, king of the mountain regions (al-Jibal, i.e., Media) and the adjoining lands,25 humbly entreating and requesting from him permission to place upon his son Sabur's head the crown of Juzhir. Ardawan, however, wrote back to him in harsh terms informing him that he and his son Ardashir were to be regarded as rebels, since the two of them had killed people; but Babak took no notice of this. Babak died around that time, and Sabur, son of Babak, was invested with the crown and reigned in his father' s place as king.26 He wrote to Ardashir instructing him to proceed to his court, but Ardashir held back. Accordingly, Sabur grew angry at Ardashir's recalcitrance; he gathered together troops and set off at the head of them to make war on Ardashir. He left Istakhr [and encamped in the building (bins') of Khumay27 on the road to Darabjird, but part of the building fell on top of him and killed him. When news of this reached Ardashir, he proceeded to Istakhr].28 He found there a number of his brothers, some of them older than himself. They 24. The account transmitted by al-Tabari seems to magnify Ardashir's role in the fighting against Artabanus ; it may well have been Babak and not his son who took the initiative here . See Noldeke , trans. 7 n. 1. 25. That is, the last Arsacid king, Artabanus IV (in the older reckoning, Artabanus V), r. ca. 213-ca. 224. The Greek form Artabanus, Parthian and MP Ardawan, represents OP *Arta -banu \"the glory of Arta\" (i .e., the divine order of the Avesta, cf. Eli s.v. Ardwahiat (M. Boyce]). See Noldeke, trans. 7 n. 2; A. D. H. Bivar, \"The Political History of Iran under the Arsacids,\" 94-96, 99; EIr, s.v. Artabanus (M.R. Dandamaev, K. Schippmann). The form Ardawan was taken over by the Arab historians; see the citations detailed in al-Mas 'udi, Murnj al-dhahab, ed. Ch. Pellat, VI, Index gdndraux, 137. 26. The name Shabur, MP Shahpuhr, \"son of the king,\" ultimately going back to OP *XÂ§ayathiya.pnthra, was not apparently used before the Sasanids ( see Justi, Namenbuch, 284-87 ; Gignoux, Les noms propres sassanides, no. 858). Whether Shabur was thus named by his father to buttress his right to succeed to the throne is uncertain. His reign was long enough for him to mint coins . In any case, Ardashir's theoretical role as a usurper was subsequently validated by his succession on Shabur's accidental death. See Noldeke, trans. 7 n. 3; EIr, s.v. Ardaair I. i. History (Wiesehofer). 27. Humay, Avestan Humaya, is in the Avesta the daughter of Wishtaspa, playing a role in later Persian epic tradition somewhat like that of the Assyrian queen Semiramis . Early Islamic authors such as al-Dinawari , al-Mas'udi, and Hamza alIsfahani attribute to Humay the building of palaces in the vicinity of Istakhr, in one of which Shabur now met his death, possibly in an earthquake. See Noldeke, trans. 8 n. 2; Justi, Namenbuch, 131-32; M. Mayrhofer, Die altiranischen Namen, no. 177. 28. These words are supplied from the ms. Sprenger 30.\n\n[The Kings of the Persians]\n\n9\n\nnevertheless gathered together and brought in the crown and the royal throne, and then offered them all to Ardashir . Hence he was crowned and sat down on the throne. He began his reign with vigorous and incisive measures. He appointed various persons to diverse offices , and nominated a man called Abarsam to the position of Chief Minister (buzurg framadhdr), lavishing largesse on him and giving him numerous charges. 29 He appointed a man named Fah.r (?) as Chief Mobadh (mubadhdn mubadh )30 He got wind of a plot on the part of his brothers and some other persons in his entourage to assassinate him, hence he slew a great number of them. Then news came to him that the people of Darabjird had risen against him, so he returned thither and conquered the town after killing a number of its citizens . He proceeded to Kirman, where there was a king called Balash.31 There was a fiercely fought battle, in which Ar-\n\n29. Abarsam is a fully historical figure, attested as a high -ranking official of Ardashir's in Shabur I's Naqsh- i Rustam inscription, in which the latter monarch lists those court dignitaries in whose memory Shabur had set up a pious founda. tion. He could not have been the chief minister, since this official for both Ardashir and Shabur is named as a Babag, and his exact rank and title are uncertain, but he was obviously exalted enough for the late Sasanid tradition , as transmitted by alTabari, to consider him as chief minister. See Mr, s.v. Abarsam ( E. Yarshater). For Abarsam' s supposed part in the preservation and then production at an opportune moment of the prince Shabur, see al-Tabari, I, 823-25, pp. 24 -27 below. It is, however, an anachronism of al -Tabari's source that he introduces already the office of buzurg framadhar, which is not attested till the early fifth century (see on the office, n. 257 below). Court and administration cannot have been so neatly organized at this early time, the highest offices under the Sasanids in their first century of power were actually those of the (h)argbed (see above, n. 15) and the bidakhsh, a kind of viceroy, cf. EIr, s.v. BidaxÂ§ ( W. Sundermann). See Noldeke, trans. 9 n. 2, and on the name Abarsam, Justi, Namenbuch , 1, and Gignoux, Noms propres sassanides , no, 14. 30. This renders MP mowbed mowbedan \"supreme priest,\" in Syriac the rig maghufe; see NSldeke, trans . 451, Excursus 3. The title comes into usage comparatively late in the Sasanid period and is not an early one . As NSldeke remarks, trans. 9 n. 3, the new ruler, whether from personal conviction or for reasons of state, showed himself eager to establish the Zoroastrian clergy in a leading role under his dynasty. 31. This, or Walash, is the NP form of MP Wardakhsh, well known in the Greek forms Vologesos, etc., and it was a frequent name for the Arsacid kings, later appearing also in the Sasanid royal line in the shape of Balash, son of Yazdajird 11 (484-88 ), see, p. 126 below. This Balash of Kirman must have been a local ruler of the last Arsacids, and he may have been the founder of the town of Walashgird, on the road connecting Jiruft with Hurmuz , mentioned by the Islamic geographers (Yaqut, Buldan, V, 383; Le Strange, Lands, 317-18; Schwarz, Iran, 248). See\n\nro [The Kings of the Persians]\n\ndashir took part personally, until he captured Balash and seized control of the city. Ardashir thereupon appointed as governor over Kirman one of his sons, also called Ardashir. Ruling in the coastlands along the Persian Gulf was a king called 'b.t.n.b.w.d (Haftanbukht ?),32 who was accorded divine attributes and worship. Ardashir marched against him, killed him by cutting him in half with his sword, put to death the members of his entourage, and brought forth from their subterranean store rooms (matdmfr)33 extensive treasures that had been piled up there. He wrote to Mihrak, the king of Abarsas (?)34 in the district of Ardashir Khurrah'3S and to a group of his fellow rulers, summoning them to his obedience. When they refused to submit, he Noldeke, trans. io n. 2; EIr, s.v. BalaÂ§ (M. L. Chaumont). In Sasanid times and in early Islamic times up to the fourth/tenth century, the shahr-i Kirmdn, the provincial capital, was what became the early Islamic city of Sirajin, in the western part of the province and near the modem Sa'idabad. It may have been this first Sasanid governor, Ardashu, son of Ardashir I, who laid out what was perhaps a military encampment, rather than a city, at Weh Ardashir in the northeastern part of the province (IIamzah al-Igfahani, Ta'rikh, 43), the place that became in later times Guwashir or Bardasir, provincial capital under the Buyids and, afterward, became the modern city of Kirman. See Noldeke, trans. Io n. 3; Le Strange, Lands, 300-301; J. Marquart, Erdnsahr nach der Geographie des Ps. Moses Xorenac'i, 30; Markwart-Messina, Catalogue of the Provincial Capitals, 90; Barthold, Historical Geography, 137-38; EI2, s.v. Kirman (A. K. S. Lambton). 32. Thus according to text, n. b. Noldeke, trans. Io n. i renders the reading '.s.w.w.d of the Sprenger ms. as Astawadh (?). The spelling Haftinbukht (?) is probably a misrendering of an Achaemenid term for an administrative district, denoting a component part of a province, a term that survived through Islamic times as the modern place-name Haftuwan, a village to the southwest of Khunj, in the western part of Laristan, in southern Fars. 33. Sing. matmnrah, meaning a subterranean chamber, either natural or manmade, used essentially for the storage of foodstuffs like grain (i.e., as a silo) or, as here, for treasure. The plural form is not infrequently a toponym in early Islamic times, as in Byzantine Asia Minor, see al-Tabari, III, I104, year 216/831-32, and in general, Ere, s.v. Matmura (Ch. Pellat). 34. Thus in Ibn al-Athir, Kdmil, I, 382, but regarded by Noldeke as dubious; the mss. have various incomprehensible readings, see text, n. d. For Mihrag, older form Mithrak, see Justi, Namenbuch, 207-208; Gignoux, Noms propres sassanides, no. 629. 3 5. One of the five knrahs or administrative districts making up the province of Fars, in which was later situated the Islamic provincial capital Shiraz. The kl rah's MP name, \"Ardashir's glory,\" commemorated the founder of the Sasanid dynasty, while the original town there of Gur, the Islamic Jur and then Firuzabad, was said to have been built on the site of Ardashir's decisive victory over the last Arsacid Ardawin or Ardabanus IV in ca. A.D. 224. See Noldeke, trans. I I is. 2, 446 Excursus 3; Yaqut, Bulddn, IV, 283; Le Strange, Lands, 248-49; Schwarz, Iran, 43ff.; Barthold, Historical Geography, 152-53, 158-59; EI2, s.v.

He then went to Jur; he founded the city [there] and began the construction of the palace called al-Tirbal36 and also of a fire temple. While he was engaged in these activities, an envoy from Ardawan (Azdawan, Lazdawan ?)37 arrived bearing a letter from the latter. Hence Ardashir assembled the leading men in the state (alnds)38 for this purpose and read out the document in their presence. The contents were as follows: \"You have presumed beyond your rank in society, and have brought down on yourself destruction, 0 Kurd brought up amongst the tents of the Kurds!39 Who gave you leave to assume the crown on your head, and permission to seize all the territories you have assembled together and whose rulers and peoples you have subdued? Who ordered you to build the city which you have founded in the desert of ... ?\"-he meant jur40-\"When we allow you to go ahead and construct it, then build a city in the desert which is ten farsakhs across and call it Ram Ardashir!\"41 He went on to inform Ardashir that he had dispatched the king of al-Ahwaz against him, with orders to bring back Ardashir to him in bonds. Ardashir replied, \"It [818] is God who has bestowed on me the crown which I have assumed, who has given me authority over the lands which I have conquered, and who has aided me against the mighty potentates (jabdbirah) and kings whom I have slain. As for the city which I am to build and which I am to name Ram Ardashir, I very much hope to get my hands on you and then send your head and your 36.

A looking-forward to later Islamic times when , certainly from the 'Abbasid period onward, kurd, \"shepherd, nomad,\" is virtually a synonym for \"robber, bandit, brigand.\" 40. See for Jar, n. 35 above. 41. Literally, \"joy of Ardashir.\" Ardashir's words here are of course ironic: you may plan a city, but you won't be able to carry out the plan!

Not much time had elapsed before a letter reached him from Abarsam with the news that the king of al-Ahwaz had appeared but that he had retreated after being defeated in battle.43Whereupon Ardashir proceeded to Isbahan, took its king Shadh Sabur prisoner and then killed him,` after which he returned to Fars, and went forth to give battle to Nirufarr (?), ruler of al-Ahwaz, marching to Arrajan,45 Sanbzl (?),46 and Tashan,47 dependencies of [the district of] Ram Hurmuz, and then to Surraq.48 When he reached these places, he rode on with a group of his retainers until he stood on the banks of the Dujayl (here, the Karon river),49 took control of the city [already existing there], and founded the [new] city of Suq al-Ahwaz;50 then he returned to Fars 42. Again ironically, Ardashir asserts that he has no need of a new city, but will adorn his existing one with his enemy's head. See Noldeke, tr. I2 n. 5. 43. This ruler would be the ruler of Elymais, a vassal of the last Arsacids, the region of southeastern Khuzistan, with its center at the modem Tang-i Sarvak, coins are extant from these petty rulers. 44. Ardashir is now for the first time moving out of Fars against neighboring potentates. Nothing is known of the rulers in Isfahan at this time, Noldeke, trans. 13 n. 1, surmised that ShAdh Sabur, literally \"joy of Shabur,\" should perhaps be read as Shah Sabur, since the name in the text would be more fittingly that of a town. 45â¢ The name of a city and of the westernmost kurah of Fars , adjacent to the border with the province of Ahwaz. Al-Tabari's mention of it here would be anachronistic in the light of the information in many Arabic authors that it was founded by the emperor Qubadh (I) (i.e., some two- and-a-half centuries after Ardashir's time), but clearly an older town existed on the site, which QubAdh may have rebuilt.

Ardawan replied that he would meet Ardashir on a plain called Hurmuzjan53 at the end of the month of Mihr. Ardashir, however, reached the place before the appointed time in order to take up a [favorable] position on the plain. He dug out a ditch to protect himself and his army, and took possession of [81g] a spring there.54 Ardawan came up against him, and the troops deployed themselves in battle order. Saber, Ardashir's son, had name Ahwaz also being applied to the province 's capital, further defined as the province's \"market\" (suq), given the agricultural and commercial prosperity of the province. There was probably an Achaemenid settlement on the site of Suq Ahwaz, which Ardashir rebuilt and refounded as his own city, Hurmuz Ardashir (see alTabari, I, 820, p. 16 below), and in Sasanid times it prospered greatly as the capital of the province of Susiana after the decay of Susa.

Artabanus ( K. Schippmann), at II, 65oa. There remains, nevertheless, the possibility that the encounter took place in eastern Khuzistan if the name Hurmuzdijan should have some connection with the town of Ram -Hurmuz; the terrain there would certainly be suitable for extensive cavalry maneuvering.\n\n14\n\n[The Kings of the Persians]\n\nalready gone forward in order to shield his father. Fierce fighting got under way, in the course of which Sabur killed Dadhbundadh,55 Ardawan's secretary (sc., the writer of the letter) with his own hand. Ardashir rushed forward from his battle position toward Ardawan and killed him. There was great slaughter among Ardawan's troops, and the survivors fled the field. It is said that Ardashir dismounted and trampled Ardawan's head with his feet. On that day of battle, Ardashir received the title of \"Supreme King\" (Shdhanshdh, literally \"King of Kings\").56 Then he went from there to Hamadhan and conquered it by force of arms, as also the mountain region (al-Jabal), Azerbaijan, Armenia, and [the region of ] al-Mawsil. The he went from alMawsil to Suristan, that is, the Sawad,57 and took possession of it for himself. On the banks of the Tigris, opposite the city of Ctesiphon (which is the city that forms the eastern part of al55â¢ The rendering preferred by Noldeke, text n. a, for the dar.n.b.dadh of the text (Sprenger ms., dad.b.n.dar). 56. Ardashir commemorated his victory in a rock relief, the largest surviving Sasanid one, on a mountainside near his town of Ardashir Khurrah. See EIr, s.v. Ardair I. ii. Rock reliefs (H. Luschey) (with illustrations). Ardashir's symbolic investiture with the ancient title of \" King of Kings\" is depicted in a relief at Naqsh-i Rustam, in which the king receives the diadem of sovereignty from Ahura Mazda, and in other reliefs depicting god and king at the bridge near Ardashir-Khurrah and at Naqsh-i Rajab. See Georgina Herrmann, The Iranian Revival, 82-88 , 90 (illustration); Luschey, loc. cit. (with illustrations). His assumption of the title is also noted in the other Arabic sources on the Sasanids: alYa'qubi, Ta'rikh, I, 179; al-Dinawari, al-Akhbar al-fiwal, 43; al-Mas'ndi, Murnj, II, x61 = Â§585. It was from the date of his victory over Ardawan (see above, n. 54), i.e., the regnal year 223-24, or at his formal accession to the throne shortly afterwards (probably therefore at some point between 224 and 226, see Frye, \"The Political History of Iran,\" I 18-19 , and n. 68 below) that Ardashir dated the beginning of his reign, which extended till his death, most probably in 242 (the chronology of the early Sisanids is in many places uncertain). See Noldeke, trans. 15 n. I; the genealogical table of Sasanid rulers in Frye, The Heritage of Persia, 295 (in which several dates for the early Sasanids need correction), and his list in \"The Political History of Iran under the Sassanians,\" 178 (again with some early dates to be corrected); EIr, s.v. Ardalir I. i. History (J. Wiesehbfer). 57. Noldeke, trans. 15 n. 3, took Suristin to be a Persian translation of Beth Aramaye, \"land of the Syrians.\" It could also denote \"the region of the Nahr Sara,\" this being the name the Arabs gaye to what was then the eastern branch of the middle Euphrates (now the river's main channel; see Yaqut, Buldan, III, 279; Le Strange, Lands, 70; Marquart, Eri nsahr, 21; Markwart-Messina, Catalogue of the Provincial Capitals, 103). It is equated with the Sawad, \"the dark lands\" (contrasted, in its vegetation and greenery, with the dazzling whiteness of the surrounding desert), the irrigated region of Mesopotamia. See E12, s.v. Sawad (C. E. Bosworth).\n\n[The Kings of the Persians] 15 Mada'in), he built a city on the western side, which he called Bih Ardashir. He formed this into a province (kfirah), adding to it Bihrasirr, al-Rumagan, Nahr Dargit, Kutha and Nahr Jawbar,58 and appointed local governors ('ummal) over them. Then he went back from the Sawad to Iqakhr, and thence to Sijistan, thence to Jurjan, and thence to Abarshahr,59 Marw, Balkh, and Khwarazm, as far as the farthest frontiers of Khurasan, after which he returned to Marw. He killed a large number of people , and despatched their heads to the fire temple of Anahidh. Then he returned from Marw\n\nto Fars and took up his quarters at Jur. Envoys from the kings of [820] the Kushan, of Turan, and of Makran, came to him offering their submission. 60 From Jur, Ardashir went to al-Balirayn and laid siege to its king Sanatruq. The latter was reduced to the extremity of need, till finally he threw himself down from the walls of the citadel and perished. Ardashir returned to al-Mada'in and estab58. For these places, see Noldeke, trans . 16 nn. 3, 4; Le Strange, Lands, 34, 6870; Marquart, Eransahr, 164-65; Morony, Iraq after the Muslim Conquest, 143ff. As Noldeke observed, tr. 16 n. 4, these administrative arrangements reflect late Sasanid administrative geography, not that of Ardashir's time, shown by the inclusion of Rumagan, the settlement of Weh-Andiyog-Khusraw, founded by Annsharwan for the people of Antioch carried off after the Persian conquest of that city in 540, and called in Arabic al-Rumiyyah. See Fry, \"The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians,\" r55; EIr, s.v. \"Deportations . ii. In the Parthian and Sasanian Periods\" ( E. Kettenhofen), at VII, 3oia; pp. 157-58 below. 59. That is, the region around Nishapur, the central part of Khurasan, the province to which ArdashIr turned his attention once he had secured western Persia. The name Abarshahr probably reflected an old 'Aparn-xsathr \"country of the Aparnak,\" Greek Aparnoi, the leading tribe of the Dahae who founded the Parthian empire. For the city of Nishapur and its foundation, see n. 163 below. See Yaqut, Buldan, I, 65-66; Noldeke, trans. 17 n. 2, 59 n. 3; Le Strange, Lands, 382-88; Marquart, Eranaahr, 36, 74-75 (his rendering of Abarshahr as \"upper country\" is to be rejected); Markwart -Messina, Catalogue of the Provincial Capitals, 52-53; Barthold, Historical Geography, 94ff.; E12, s.v. Nishapur (E. Honigmann-C. E. Bosworth). 60. These potentates were neighbors of the Sasanids in what is now northern Afghanistan and the Sijistan -Baluchistan region. The demise of the Kushan empire, which had in its heyday straddled the Hindu Kush and extended over northern India, seems to have taken place ca. 225 , and is probably to be connected with Ardashir's campaigns against the Kushan Shah, laconically referred to here. See Noldeke, tr. 17 n. 5) Bivar, \"The History of Eastern Iran,\" 203. Turan was in early Islamic times a region of east- central Baluchistan associated with Qugdar or Khuzdar, i.e., it lay to the north of the coastal region of Makran and, as Noldeke observed, trans. 18 n. x , is not to be confused with Turin, the name the Iranians gave to the peoples beyond the Oxus. The Paikuli inscriptions of some two generations after Ardashir's time mention the Makuran Shah as a vassal of the Sasanids but not the Tnr3n Shah. See Ell, s.v. Turin (V. Minorsky).\n\n1 6 [The Kings of the Persians]\n\nlished himself there, and he had his son Shabar crowned within his own lifetime.61 It is related that there was in a village called Alar, in the district of Kujaran, which is one of the rural districts of the coastland of Ardashir Khurrah, a queen who was accorded the respect and worship of a divinity and who possessed wealth, treasuries, and soldiers. Ardashir made war on her priestly custodians (sadanah), killed her, and seized as booty immense wealth and treasures belonging to her. [It is further related] that he built eight cities: in Fars, the city of Ardashir Khurrah, that is, Jar, the city of Ram Ardashir, and the city of Riw Ardashir;61 in al-Ahwaz, Hurmuz Ardashir, that is, Suq al-Ahwaz; in the Sawad, Bih Ardashir, that is, the western side of al-Mada'in,63 and Astabadh Ardashir, that is, Karkh Maysan; in al-Bahrayn, Fasa (?) Ardashir, i.e the city of al-Khatt;64 and in [the region of ] al-Mawsil, Budh Ardashir, that is, Hazzah.65 61. These movements by Ardashir mark the beginning of Sasanid attempts to control the western shores of the Gulf , and we now have the start of a Persian political, cultural, and religious penetration into eastern Arabia that was to continue until the advent there of Islam in the 63os . The appearance of the Parthian name Sanatruq/Sinatrices, so common among the Arsacids and their dependents in Adiabene and Commagene , may mean that this local ruler in Bahrayn was an Arsacid vassal . See Noldeke, trans. 18 n. 3; A. Siddiqi, Studien fiber die persischen Fremdworter im klassischen Arabisch, 77-79; Bosworth, \"Iran and the Arabs before Islam,\" 603-604. The coronation of Shaper with his father's crown and the joint rule of father and son is confirmed by Ardashir 's late coins , which, inter alia, depict Ardashir and a youthful king symbolizing the son, and also by rock reliefs , including one at Darabgird apparently depicting Shaper, victorious over the Romans, and wearing his father's crown . See Elr, s.v. Darab . iii. Rock Reliefs (Georgina Herrmann). 62. This name later became Reshahr /Rishahr. Its modem ruins lie at the southern end of the Bushire peninsula; the name survived at least until the sixteenth century in that of the Portuguese fort of \"Reixer.\" See Noldeke, trans . 19 n. 4; Schwarz, Iran, 120-21; Wilson, The Persian Gulf, 73-74; Barthold, Historical Geography, 164; E12, s.v. Bushahr (Bushir) (L. Lockhart). 63. That is, the newly refounded-Seleucia. See J. M. Fiey, \"Topographie chr6tienne de Mahoze,\" 400, 409-10. 64. Al-Khatt was a term applied by early Islamic historians and geographers to the coastlands of eastern Arabia from the head of the Persian Gulf down to Oman, without any more precise definition. The particular settlement of al-Khatt was said to be held by the `Abd al-Qays tribe and to be an entrep6t for a famous type of spear, the Khatti, imported from India and sold to the Bedouins, but it is impossible to locate it firmly . The name would appear to be old and to be connected with the Chatenia of the classical geographers . See Noldeke, tr. 20 n. 3; PW, III/ 2, S.V. Chattenia (D. H. Muller); Bosworth, \"Iran and the Arabs before Islam,\" 593-4; EI2, s.v. al-Khatt (A. Grohmann). 65. I;Iazzah, marked today by an entirely Muslim village Heza to the southwest\n\n[The Kings of the Persians] 17\n\nIt is mentioned that, when Ardashir first came to power, he wrote to the Party Kings eloquently phrased letters setting forth his rightful claim to authority over them and summoning them to obedience. When he came to the end of his life, he set forth his testament for his successor.66 All through his career he was the object of praise and was victorious in war. No military force of his was ever put to flight nor was any banner of his ever hurled down. [821] of Irbil, was the administrative center of a region of the same name in Adiabene, the region between the Greater and the Lesser Zab rivers in northern Mesopotamia (see on it, Ely, s.v. Adiabene [D. Sellwood]j. The town is frequently mentioned in Nestorian Christian literature as the seat of a bishopric in the metropolitanate of Irbil ( and ca. 12oo a Jacobite bishopric is mentioned there). Ibn iiawgal in the fourth/tenth century still speaks of the ar4i Flazzah and its component rustags. See Noldeke, tr. 20 n. 4; M. Canard, Histoire des H'amdanides, 123; Fiey, Assyrie chrdtienne, I, 165-67; Morony, Iraq after the Muslim Conquest , 132-33 . Hamzah al-Igfahiini devotes much of his section on Ardashir in Ta'rikh, 42-44, to the many cities the emperor founded and his many fire temples and other buildings. Although a zealous adherent of Zoroastrianism , Ardashir seems to have been tolerant of the Christian communities within his realm, although it was only toward 25o that what might be called a catholic Christianity, with a defined dogma, evolved with a proper ecclesiastical hierarchy, at least as far as the Tigris. See J. Labourt, Le Christianisme dans l 'empire perse sous la dynastie sassanide, 224-632 , 10-17; M.-L. Chaumont, \"Les Sassanides et la Christianisme de l'Empire iranien au Me si8cle de notre 8re,\" 167-68. 66. This is a reference to what was in Islamic times known as the 'ahd Ardashir, in fact a good example of the \"Mirrors for Princes\" genre , listed by Ibn al-Nadim in his Fihrist, 377-78, trans. Bayard Dodge, The Fihrist of al-Nadim. A TenthCentury Survey of Muslim Culture, II, 740, as the Kitab 'Ahd Ardashir Babakan ila ibnihi Saber and described as a translation from Pahlavi . Whether any material from the time of Ardashir is actually contained in it is unknown , but it is more likely that material ostensibly from Ardashir was imputed to him later . The text and a translation of it, at that time still in manuscript, were given by Mario Grignaschi in his \"Quelques specimens de la litterature sassanide conservde dans les bibliothtques d'Istanbul,\" 46-90, and the work has been subsequently edited and published by Ihs3n 'Abbas, 'Ahd Ardashir, Beirut 1967 . A related text is the A'in-i Ardashir, a collection of aphorisms and advice on statecraft , also edited and translated by Grignaschi in op, cit., 91-133 . Also relevant here is mention of the so-called Letter of Tansar, known subsequently to the Islamic world through an Arabic translation, probably by Ibn al-Muqaffa' from a lost Pahlavi original, but now known substantially in a New Persian version . It purports to be the work of Ardashir's Chief Priest, TOsar or Tansar; it adjures a local prince of Tabaristan to submit to the Sasanid ruler and, in general , justifies Sasanid rule and political conduct. Although it is generally accepted that the Letter in its existing form dates substantially from the time of Khusraw Antisharwan, i.e., the sixth century, it may well have a core going back to the third century . See E12, s.v. Tansar, Kitib IF. C. de Blois). See also for a recent consideration of all three of these texts as part of the movement for translating works from the Pahlavi into Arabic, and their place in the subsequent development of Islamic political and social thinking , Louise Marlow, Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought, 72-88.\n\n[The Kings of the Persians]\n\nHe reduced to submission67 and humiliated all the rulers of the lands around his own kingdom, and conquered the lands totally. He divided up the land into provinces, laid out cities, established the various ranks and offices in the state, and exerted himself in multiplying the fertility and flourishing of the land. His reign lasted, from the time when he killed Ardawan till he himself perished, fourteen years, but according to others, fourteen years and ten months.68 There was related to me a narrative going back to Hisham b. Muhammad (i.e., Ibn al-Kalbi) that states:69 Ardashir moved for67. wa-athkana fi al-ard, echoing Qur'an, VIII, 68/67. 68. Ardashir I reigned from spring 224, the date his victory over Ardawan took place, or 226 (see n. 56 above ) to 24o as sole ruler, and then for two more years till his death as coruler with his son Shaper. There has, in fact, been much discussion about the chronology of Ardashir's last years and the exact date of his death; this latter event should probably be placed, in WiesehSfer's estimation (see below), in early 242, most likely in February of that year. Ardashir' s name appears on his coins as 'ARTH^TR. See, on his coins, Furdoonjee D. I. Paruck, Sasanian Coins, 51-52, 305-16, 413-16, Plates I-III, Table I; R. GSbl, Sasanian Numismatics, 42, Tables I-Ia, Plates 1-2; D. Sellwood, P. Whitting, and R. Williams, An Introduction to Sasanian Coins, 21, 73-78; Hodge Mehdi Malek, \"A Survey of Research on Sasanian Numismatics,\" 232-33. The Arabic sources on the rise of the Sasanids and Ardashir 's reign include Ibn Qutaybah, Ma'arif, 653-54; al-Ya'qubi, Ta'rikh, I, 179 (very brief ); al-Dinawari, alAkhbar al-Fiwal, 42-45 (Ardashir's rise to power and defeat of Ardawhr's son Farrukhin, the extension of his authority over outlying provinces and the story of the clandestine birth and upbringing of his son Saber (I), see below, al-Tabari, I, 823-25); Hamzah al-Isfahan, Ta'rikh, 42-44 (Ardashir's rise and consolidation of power, his new cities and his building operations ); al-Mas'edi, Muruj, 11, 148, 15163 a Â§Â§ 573, 576-88 (his defining of the various ranks in the Persian social, military, and religious structures , his emphasis on court ceremonial, his urban foundations and building works, and his aphorisms on statecraft and monarchical power, as set forth in the Kar-namag (-i Ardaiir-i Pabagan], on which see n. 5 above); idem, Tanbih, 98-100, trans.

Zotenberg, Chronique de Abou-Djafar-Mo'hammed-ben-Djarir-ben-Yezid Tabari, I, 527-28, II, 66-75. For studies on the reign of Ardashir in general , see e.g., Christensen, Sassanides, 86-96; Frye, The Heritage of Persia, 207-21; idem, \"The Political History of Iran under the Sasanians,\" 118-25, 178; EIr, s.v. Ardalir I. i. History (J. WiesehSfer). NSldeke, trans. 21 n. 4, thought that the picture of the first Sasanid emperor as an exemplary ruler, while not without some basis, was exaggerated. Ardashir can nevertheless be accounted a firm and successful ruler who brought unity to the Persian lands after the chaotic conditions of the late Arsacid period. It is probably true that he extirpated the Arsacid royal family within Persia (though not in Armenia, see n. 84 below ), but he conciliated and took into his service many of the great Parthian military and administrative families , thus providing some element of continuity within the state. 69.
