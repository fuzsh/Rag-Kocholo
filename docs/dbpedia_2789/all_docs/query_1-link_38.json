        "text": "3pmEST (12, my time)\n\nTuesday, August 8th, 3pm - 6pm: Alejandro Jodorowsky\n\nA rare, in-person interview between Brian and one of the most iconoclastic and psychedelic filmmakers in the world: Chilean-born, 87-year-old, Alejandro Jodorowsky. Touted as godfather of midnight movies with the advent of 1970's El Topo and later epics The Holy Mountain and Santa Sangre, Jodorowsky talks to WFMU right on the heels of the initial release of his brand new film Endless Poetry. This is the second of three installments in which the director chronicles his own life and upbringing among Chilean poets and artist friends, as well as his tumultuous family relationships. Throughout his life, Jodorowsky has approached every multi-faceted artistic avenue with ferocity, passion and defiance; studying mime with Marcel Marceau and enacting surrealist plays and events during his tenure in Paris, then migrating to Mexico to begin his journey into filmmaking, tarot, comic art, and psychomagic. His near-miss in creating an otherworldly screen rendition of Dune was well-recounted in a recent critically-heralded documentary. He even has an asteroid named after him. Decades of stunted distrubution due to hassles with Allen Klein's Abkco organization finally ceased in 2007 when his movies became majorly available again, and finally Jodorowsky's mindblowing aesthetic has seeped into more mainstream consciousness and inspired a whole new breed of artists and fans worldwide. Meanwhile, he has simultaneously loaded the decks for a myriad of current and future projects, which will all be discussed today. Also, there will be talk of music from his films, most recently composed by his son Adan (who also portrays his father in the new Endless Poetry)."
