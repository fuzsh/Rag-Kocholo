        "text": "Light In The Attic will be releasing the original soundtrack to the documentary film Jodorowsky's Dune in November. Composed by Kurt Stenzel on analogue synthesizers like the Moog Source, CA-101a and Roland Juno 6, the soundtrack is said to be as cosmically futuristic and “as fantastic as Jodorowsky’s vision”. Directed by Frank Pavich, the 2013 documentary tells the story of the cult film maker and psycho-magic protagonist Alejandro Jodorowsky’s unsuccessful attempt to adapt Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi novel Dune for the screen. Describing his vision for the film, Jodorowsky said, “I wanted to make something sacred. A film that gives LSD hallucinations without LSD. To change the young minds of all the world.” His Dune screenplay was cast to a pretty majestic crowd including Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger and Orson Welles, and Pink Floyd and Magma were down to record its soundtrack. By the time the production ran out of funds and came to a halt in the mid-1970s, the script was long enough to make a film several hours long.\n\nJodorowsky's Dune: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, with sleevenotes by the composer Kurt Stenzel, will be released by Light In The Attic on 13 November in 2xLP, CD & digital formats.
