        "text": "One of my favorite soundtracks ever! And a somewhat confusing record. First, there are two versions – the film score on Apple (which I hear is to be avoided) and this bay area jazzfunk jam “inspired by the film” by the Shades of Joy on Douglas.\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky – the movie’s director is credited here with writing all the music (which sounds improvised), yet appears to play no instrument or take part in the session at all. But, of the people who do actually play on this record, most noteable is funky keyboard legend Howard Wales! The sound here ranges from all out funky get-downs, to trippy, moody electric Miles Davis-esque excursions. Very highly recommended."
