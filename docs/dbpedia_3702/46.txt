Music labels powered by Proton benefit from our constant devotion to helping save time, freeing up more energy for higher pursuits (or getting some much needed rest). That's why we invent the Compilation Tool -- which streamlines and simplifies the process of re-releasing existing tracks on a new release, without having to re-upload files, re-enter metadata, or do much of anything else except select the songs to be re-released.

This is great for "Best Of" compilations, putting an album together of earlier released singles, or any time a previously released song wants to be released again.

The Compilation Tool is a feature inside SoundSystem empowering music labels to compile and re-release tracks with minimal effort. It automatically copies over all metadata like track titles, artists, genres, royalty rates, expenses, contracts, and previously uploaded WAV files -- saving tons of time!

If you are re-releasing music on your label on a compilation, we strongly encourage informing artists about the new release. This makes sure they're aware of and OK with the re-release, but also means they can help with promotion!
