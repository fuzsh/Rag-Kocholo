        "text": "A must-have for every Who fan, October 30, 2003\n\nBy Andreas Martin\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Meaty-Beaty-Big-Bouncy-Who/dp/B000008MA0/ref=ntt_mus_ep_dpt_4\n\nThis was the first best-of album of The Who, released back in 1971 on LP. It is still the best, especially in the CD version, mastered by Steve Hoffman (known from audiophile labels DCC and Audio Fidelity). The only other best-of CD you need is Who's Better Who's Best.\n\nA track-by-track review:\n\n1. I Can't Explain. This is the best version on CD you can find. True mono, powerful bass, punchy sound, almost no distortion. I never imagined that this rather primitive recording could sound so great.\n\n2. The Kids Are Alright. This is the edited version (2:45) that was on the US album \"The Who Sings My Generation\", and that is also on \"The Ultimate Collection\" and the MCA \"Who\"s Better Who\"s Best\". It still sounds great, but the longer version (3:05) can be found on the Polydor \"Who's Better Who's Best\".\n\n3. Happy Jack. True mono, good sound. The version on \"Who\"s Better Who\"s Best\" sounds a little cleaner, though.\n\n4. I Can See For Miles. This is the original stereo album mix, with Pete's guitar moving between the channels during the solo. Great sound.\n\n5. Pictures Of Lily. True mono. This is mastered just like the original single, with a fade-up at the beginning and a slight crescendo during the entire song. Good sound, but I prefer the cold start on \"Who's Better Who's Best\".\n\n6. My Generation. True mono. This always sounds dirty, on every CD. But that is what it is supposed to sound. Still a signature song for The Who.\n\n7. The Seeker. Stereo. This is the best version you can find on CD. The guitar intro blows you away.\n\n8. Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere. True mono. Not the best-sounding recording. The version here is okay, but \"Who's Better Who's Best\" probably used a better source.\n\n9. Pinball Wizard. The best version you can find. Amazing detail and definition. Just the right amount of hiss to make it sound real. Most other version have a delayed echo on the intro; it sounds much better here.\n\n10. Legal Matter. The best version you can find. True mono.\n\n11. Boris The Spider. Stereo version. Sounds good and not as distorted as on \"The Ultimate Collection\" or the fake stereo version on \"My Generation - The Very Best Of The Who\". (I prefer the mono mix, though.)\n\n12. Magic Bus. Stereo mix with extended intro (3:21). Best version you can find. This is not the long version (4:36) that was on the \"Meaty Beaty Big & Bouncy\" LP, because only a fake stereo tape of that one could be found. The background vocals always sound a little thin on the stereo mix; it still sounds better here than everywhere else.\n\n13. Substitute. True mono. This does not sound good. Probably taken from an equalized 45 master. The version on \"Who's Better Who's Best\" is much better and cleaner.\n\n14. I'm A Boy. This the an alternate, longer, earlier version. This is not the single version. True stereo and top sound. The same version is on the bonus disc of the limited edition of \"The Ultimate Collecion\", but there it is truncated and distorted.(The single version is on \"Who's Better Who\"s Best\", even in (twin-track) stereo)).\n\nYes. I believe new copies are still sold at Amazon Canada.\n\nSorry, I can't read that\n\nA must-have for every Who fan, October 30, 2003\n\nBy Andreas Martin\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Meaty-Beaty-Big-Bouncy-Who/dp/B000008MA0/ref=ntt_mus_ep_dpt_4\n\nThis was the first best-of album of The Who, released back in 1971 on LP.
