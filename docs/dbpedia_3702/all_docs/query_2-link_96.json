        "text": "As you probably know EMI/Apple virtually never allow Beatles songs to appear on compilations. \"Best of the Sixties\", that kind of thing.\n\nHowever in 1986, as part of the UK's \"Now That's What I Call Music\" series, a special Summer Album/Summer Tape was released. This compilation (I used to have it on tape) contained not only \"All You Need Is Love\", but also \"Here Comes The Sun\".\n\nThese are the actual master recordings, not a group that sound like The Beatles!\n\nDoes anyone know how and why this happened? It's very strange. Would the three Beatles and Yoko have had to signed off on this, or was the Apple/EMI agreement different in those days?\n\nFinally, does anyone have any other instances of The Beatles' recordings appearing on a various artists compilations?\n\nLink here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_That's_What_I_Call_Music_â€“_The_Summer_Album\n\nThere were a few during the time in the late 70s/early eighties when EMI were also constantly packaging Beatles comp after comp.\n\nI remember a Merseybeat LP comp in '84 ish which had an early Beatles hit on it (She Loves You maybe?). There was also a EMI Rock comp in the late 70s with Get Back on it.\n\nWas it not one of the lawsuits to do with Sessions and the Heineken tape and then the negotiations to issue the Beatles on CD which led to an agreement where Apple had to sign off on anything EMI wanted to do...which meant stuff like this pretty much stopped.\n\nChris\n\nOnly one i recall seeing on any compilations is \" Ain't She Sweet\". When i make my own compilation tapes or CD's I never put Beatles songs on any of them either. It would end up being mostly Beatles. lol.\n\nFew others too like Jefferson Airplane, Hendrix and some others i don't add to compilation tapes either\n\nExactly like those Readers Digest style best of the sixties with no Beatles or Rolling Stones on them\n\nThis one contains a few Beatles tracks, but is also a promo:\n\nThe Ronco Do it Now collection contained \"Nowhere Man,\" but apparently was for a charity/nonprofit.\n\nHow many strictly-for-profit, non-EMI/Capitol VA collections have Beatles tracks from the \"official\" canon (i.e., no \"Ain't She Sweet\"s) appeared on? Can't be more than a handful.\n\nA \"benefit\" collection from around 1971 called \"Do it Now\" featured Nowhere Man. Ronco label maybe (going from memory).\n\nIn the early 80s, on the Music For Pleasure label (EMI's budget label) there was a series of albums released called \"Saville's Time Travels\" each covering a single year.\n\nThe 1963 album started off with She loves you.\n\nThe 1964 album started with I want to hold your hand.\n\nThe 1965 album started off with Help!\n\nThe 1966 album incorporated Paperback Writer.\n\nI can't find the tracklisting of the 1967 album, but they didn't appear on the 1968 edition, so I think that was it.\n\nThe 1967 copy of Saville's time travels does not include any Beatles material.\n\nbtw Those Saville pressings from early 1980s are an excellent analogue source of EMI singles and good pressings to boot\n\nBelow is about as low into the cheapo cheapo market as it ever went. A 3 cassette MFP set from 1983. Sorry about the crappy scan. 'She Loves You' and 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' are in there.\n\nAttached Files:\n\nscan0002.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n55.8 KB\n\nViews:\n\n1\n\nSaville's travels are a mixture of mono stereo. You can just see STEREO/*MONO and MONO/*STEREO above the MFP logo top right in the scans above. I have 62 thru 67. In 62 a few American tracks are stereo e.g. 'Speedy Gonzales', by 67 they are mostly stereo, but not 'Hi Ho Silver Lining', 'Carrie Anne', HH:'There's a kind of Hush' and 5 others. But 63 has 'She Loves You' notated as stereo, as does 67 'Whiter Shade of Pale'."
