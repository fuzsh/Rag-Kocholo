        "text": "For compilation-o-philes, the Time-Life collections are the Holy Grail. The licensing muscle of Time-Life has more pull than any other collections, anywhere, at any price. I've listed the entries to the following series:\n\nThe Rock 'N' Roll Era\n\nClassic Rock\n\nCountry USA\n\nYour Hit Parade\n\nSounds Of The Seventies\n\nSuperhits/AM Gold\n\nRhythm & Blues/Solid Gold Soul\n\nContemporary Country\n\nHistory Of Rock 'N' Roll\n\nGuitar Rock\n\nSounds Of The Eighties\n\nBody Talk\n\nClassic Country\n\nElvis Presley Collection\n\nBody + Soul\n\nModern Rock\n\nGlory Days Of Rock 'N' Roll\n\nSingers And Songwriters\n\nI've provided scans of what I have.\n\nThe definitive 1950s set. The early discs sound pretty bad, due to source material being shipped to Time-Life on analog reel-to-reel tapes. Sound levels are a bit low. Remarkable track selection, probably the deepest 1950s pop set ever released. These are all single discs, with about twenty-two tracks each. Some of these have been remastered or reissued with a few different tracks; you can tell by “RE-1” or “RE-2” in the matrix number on the discs. Time-Life released an additional Vol. 51 in 1996, four years after the original series ended. The Time-Life numbering scheme is 2RNR-xx.\n\n1957 (released 1987)\n\nThe original pressing has a total run time of 52:18. The original includes three tracks with electronically reprocessed stereo (Come Go With Me, I'm Walkin', Party Doll), and several tracks with truncated fades.\n\nThe \"RE-2\" reissue has a total running time of 52:37. The RE-2 reissue has the same track listing and art/booklet as the original release, and can only be visually distinguished from the original release by the RE-2 in the matrix number on the CD. The RE-2 reissue features drastically improved sound on nearly all tracks, likely from lower-generation source tapes. All tracks are in pure mono. It is unclear if there was ever an RE-1 reissue for this disc.\n\nThere was also a pressing on JCI Records that uses the track listing and mastering of the RE-2 reissue.\n\n1962 (1987)\n\nTrack 18 on the original pressing is \"Twistin' The Night Away\".\n\nThe \"RE-1\" reissue has the same track listing and art/booklet as the original release, and can only be visually distinguished from the original release by the RE-1 in the matrix number on the CD. The RE-1 reissue features drastically improved sound on nearly all tracks, likely from lower-generation source tapes.\n\nTrack 18 on the \"RE-2\" reissue is \"Sherry\". Sound quality of the other tracks is comparable to the RE-1 reissue. The RE-2 reissue remained in print until at least 1994, as evidenced by a pressing with a Mould SID Code.\n\nThere was also a pressing on JCI Records that uses the track listing and mastering of the RE-2 reissue.\n\nThe Beach Boys: 1962-1967 (1988)\n\n1961 (1987)\n\nTracks 10 and 18 on the original pressing are \"Shop Around\" and \"Please Mr. Postman\".\n\nThe \"RE-1\" reissue has the same track listing and art/booklet as the original release, and can only be visually distinguished from the original release by the RE-1 in the matrix number on the CD. The RE-1 reissue features drastically improved sound on nearly all tracks, likely from lower-generation source tapes.\n\nTracks 10 and 18 on a pressing on JCI Records are \"Heart And Soul\" and \"Apache\". The other 20 tracks are digitally identical to the RE-1 reissue.\n\n1958 (1987)\n\nThe original pressing is likely the \"RE-1\" release; there are no known variants of this CD that lack the RE- designation. The RE-1 release has 23 tracks, including \"To Know Him, Is To Love Him\".\n\nThe \"RE-2\" reissue has only 22 tracks, omitting \"To Know Him, Is To Love Him\" and reordering the remaining tracks. The RE-2 reissue features drastically improved sound on nearly all tracks, likely from lower-generation source tapes.\n\nThere was also a pressing on JCI Records that uses the track listing and mastering of the RE-2 reissue.\n\nElvis Presley: 1954-1961 (1988)\n\n1963 (1986)\n\n1954-1955 (1988)\n\nThe Everly Brothers: 1957-1962 (1987)\n\n1964 (1987)\n\nTrack 2 on the original pressing is \"California Sun\".\n\nThe \"RE-1\" reissue has the same track listing and art/booklet as the original release, and can only be visually distinguished from the original release by the RE-1 in the matrix number on the CD. The RE-1 reissue probably features drastically improved sound on nearly all tracks, likely from lower-generation source tapes, but I can't confirm.\n\nTrack 2 on the \"RE-2\" reissue is \"Rag Doll\". I can confirm that the sound on RE-2 is vastly improved over the original release.\n\n1960 (1987)\n\nTracks 4 and 15 on the original pressing are Sam Cooke's \"Wonderful World\" and \"Chain Gang\".\n\nThere may not be an RE-1 reissue for this release.\n\nTracks 4 and 15 on the RE-2 reissue are \"Wonderful World\" and \"Cathy's Clown\", according to the Both Sides Now discography. I haven't encountered the RE-2 variant at all; it's likely quite rare.\n\nTracks 4 and 15 on the \"RE-3\" reissue are \"Last Date\" and \"Cathy's Clown\". Time-Life lost the rights to the Sam Cooke tracks.\n\nThe Supremes: 1963-1969 (1987)\n\n1959 (1988)\n\nThe original pressings have sleepover party artwork. On the last page of the booklet, the copyright date for the cover art is 1988.\n\nMore common later pressings have Ritchie Valens on stage artwork. On the last page of the booklet, the copyright date for the cover art is 1989.\n\nThe audio is the same on both.\n\n1956 (1987)\n\nThe original pressing (and mastering) remained in print until at least 1994, as evidenced by a pressing with a Mould SID Code.\n\nThere was also a pressing on JCI Records that uses the track listing and mastering of the original release.\n\nFrankie Valli & The Four Seasons: 1962-1967 (1987)\n\n1962: Still Rockin' (1988)\n\nTracks 2 and 17 on the original pressing are Sam Cooke's \"Having A Party\" and \"Bring It On Home To Me\".\n\nTracks 11 and 12 on the \"RE-1\" reissue are \"Crying In The Rain\" and \"Big Girls Don't Cry\", which replace the Sam Cooke tracks. The remaining 20 tracks are retained in order from the original release, but with the two Sam Cooke tracks deleted and the two replacement tracks inserted in the middle of the track listing.\n\n\"Turn On Your Love Light\" is a stereo alternate take on the original release, and the mono hit version on the RE-1 reissue. \"I Need Your Lovin'\" is mono on the original release, and stereo (and from better-sounding source tapes) on the RE-1 reissue. All the remaining tracks on the RE-1 reissue (tracks 1-10, 13-16, 18-20, and 22) are digitally identical clones of the original release.\n\n1957: Still Rockin' (1988)\n\nTrack 6 on the original pressing is Sam Cooke's \"You Send Me\".\n\nTrack 6 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Be Bop Baby\". \"Hula Love\" is cleaned up on the RE-1 reissue to remove some of the clipping (high-frequency distortion in the loud portions). All the remaining tracks on the RE-1 reissue (tracks 1-5, 7-15, and 17-22) are digitally identical clones of the original release.\n\n1961: Still Rockin' (1989)\n\nThe original pressing is likely the \"RE-1\" release; there are no known variants of this CD that lack the RE- designation. Track 4 of the RE-1 release is Sam Cooke's \"Cupid\".\n\nTrack 4 of the \"RE-2\" reissue is \"Walk Right Back\". Compared to RE-1, the RE-2 reissue features new analog transfers (and not necessarily improvements) on tracks 2, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, and 19. All others are digitally identical (tracks 1, 3, 6, 18, 21, and 22), are digital clones with one or more level changes in the song (tracks 9-12 and 15-17), or are digital clones that adjust the left/right balance (track 20).\n\n1963: Still Rockin' (1989)\n\nThere is a \"RE-1\" release, but I doubt that there is a non-RE original release that was released earlier. A review from the Both Sides Now website claimed that there was a non-RE original release with the same track listing as the RE-1, and that the RE-1 had upgraded sound from the original release. I couldn't find any images of a non-RE matrix number for this release.\n\n1959: Still Rockin' (1989)\n\nTracks 4 and 10 on the original pressing are Sam Cooke's \"Only Sixteen\" and Paul Anka's \"Lonely Boy\".\n\nTracks 4 and 10 on the \"RE-1\" reissue are \"('Til) I Kissed You\" and \"It's Late\". All other tracks on the RE-1 reissue (tracks 1-3, 5-9, and 11-22) are digitally identical clones of the original release.\n\n1958: Still Rockin' (1989) \"RE-1\" version; I haven't encountered any releases without the RE-1.\n\n1960: Still Rockin' (1989) \"RE-1\" version; I haven't encountered any releases without the RE-1.\n\n1956: Still Rockin' (1989)\n\nThe '50s: Keep On Rockin' (1989) \"RE-1\" version; I haven't encountered any releases without the RE-1.\n\nThe '60s: Keep On Rockin' (1989)\n\nElvis, The King: 1954-1965 (1990)\n\nTeen Idols (1990)\n\nThe '50s: Rave On (1990)\n\nTrack 11 on the original pressing is Paul Anka's \"You Are My Destiny\".\n\nTrack 11 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Tall Cool One\". All other tracks on the RE-1 reissue are digitally identical clones of the original release.\n\nThe '60s: Rave On (1990)\n\nRoots Of Rock: 1945-1956 (1990)\n\nRicky Nelson: 1957-1972 (1990)\n\nRed-Hot Rockabilly (1990)\n\nThe '50s: Last Dance (1990)\n\nRoy Orbison: 1960-1965 (1991)\n\nThe '60s: Last Dance (1991) \"RE-1\" version; I haven't encountered any releases without the RE-1.\n\nAxes & Saxes: The Great Instrumentals (1991)\n\nWeird, Wild & Wacky (1991)\n\nTrack 13 on the original pressing is a non-hit rerecording of Larry Verne's \"Mr. Custer\".\n\nThe \"RE-1\" reissue has the same track listing and art/booklet as the original release, and can only be visually distinguished from the original release by the RE-1 in the matrix number on the CD. Track 13 of the RE-1 reissue is the original hit version of Larry Verne's \"Mr. Custer\". All other tracks on the RE-1 reissue are digitally identical to the original release.\n\nRock Classics: The Originals (1991)\n\nTrack 13 on the \"RE-1\" version is Richard Berry's \"Louie Louie\". I haven't encountered any releases without the RE- designation in the matrix number.\n\nTrack 13 on the \"RE-2\" reissue is Don And Dewey's \"I'm Leavin' It All Up To You\".\n\nTrack 11 on RE-2 is a new analog transfer of the same source tape used on RE-1. Track 14 on RE-2 is a new analog transfer that fades about 16 beats earlier than RE-1. Track 15 is the 45 version on RE-2, but is a previously unreleased version from the 1991 CD \"The Isley Brothers Story\" on RE-1. Track 16 is a mono mix on RE-1, but a stereo mix on RE-2. Tracks 1-10, 12, and 17-22 of RE-2 are volume-adjusted digital clones of the corresponding tracks from RE-1. (Tracks 1 and 7 are 1.9 dB louder on RE-2. Tracks 2 and 10 are 2.4 dB louder on RE-2. Tracks 3 and 20 are 2.6 dB louder on RE-2. Tracks 4, 5, 19, 21, and 22 are 2.9 dB louder on RE-2. Tracks 6, 8, 9, 12, and 17 are 2.7 dB louder on RE-2. Track 18 is 3.1 dB louder on RE-2.)\n\nThe New Orleans Sound (1991)\n\nThe '60s: Teen Time (1991)\n\nR & B Gems (1991)\n\nThe '60s: Sock Hop (1991)\n\nRoots Of Rock II (1992)\n\nLost Treasures (1992)\n\nStreet Corner Serenade (1992)\n\nThe '60s: Jukebox Memories (1992)\n\nTeen Idols II (1992)\n\nR & B Gems II (1992)\n\nLost Treasures II (1992)\n\nStreet Corner Serenade II (1992)\n\nThe Great Rock 'N' Roll Instrumentals (1996)\n\nThe definitive 1960s set. Same quibbles as with the Rock ’N’ Roll Era series - the early discs sound pretty bad, due to source material being shipped to Time-Life on analog reel-to-reel tapes. Sound levels are a bit low on this set as well. Track selection is also remarkable, probably the deepest 1960s pop set ever released. All are single discs, with about twenty-two tracks each. Time-Life released an additional Vol. 31 in 1996, five years after the original series ended. The Time-Life numbering scheme is 2CLR-xx.\n\n1965 (released 1987)\n\n1966 (1987)\n\n\"Tell It Like It Is\" on the original pressings is a 3:09 non-hit remake.\n\n\"Tell It Like It Is\" on the \"RE-1\" reissue is the 2:43 hit version.\n\nThe RE-1 reissue has all its tracks remastered using significantly better-sounding source tapes than what were used on the original release. The original release and the RE-1 reissue use identical artwork for the booklets and discs. The only way to tell the releases apart is to inspect the matrix number in the inner hub of the CD.\n\n1964 (1987)\n\nThe original pressings have 22 tracks and the \"A Go-Go\" cover art.\n\nThe 1989 \"RE-1\" reissue has 25 tracks (adding \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\", \"Hippy Hippy Shake\", and \"She's Not There\", and reordering the tracks) and the painted lady face cover art. In general, the RE-1 reissue uses significantly better-sounding source tapes than what were used on the original release.\n\nThe 1993 \"RE-2\" reissue has 24 tracks (deleting \"A Summer Song\") and the painted lady face cover art. The RE-2 reissue has comparable sound to the RE-1. All 24 tracks are digital clones from the RE-1 reissue, with adjustments for levels, balance, and EQ. \"Come See About Me\" is missing the opening drumbeat on RE-2, but is OK on RE-1.\n\n\"How Do You Do It\" is mono on original release and stereo on RE-1 and RE-2.\n\n\"Fun Fun Fun\" is mono LP mix on original release and is stereo LP mix on RE-1 and RE-2.\n\n\"Farmer John\" is stereo LP version on original and is mono 45 version on RE-1 and RE-2.\n\n\"Needles And Pins\" is mono on original release and stereo on RE-1 and RE-2.\n\n1968 (1988)\n\nThe original pressings have ladies-in-car artwork.\n\nMore common later pressings have guys-in-weeds artwork.\n\nThe audio is the same on both. Note that the copyright date is 1988 (shown on the CD and inside the booklet), not 1987 (as printed on back cover).\n\n1967 (1988)\n\nThe original pressings have people-on-building artwork.\n\nMore common later pressings have people-on-stage artwork.\n\nThe audio is the same on both.\n\n1969 (1988)\n\n1966: The Beat Goes On (1988)\n\n1965: The Beat Goes On (1988)\n\n1964: The Beat Goes On (1988)\n\n1967: The Beat Goes On (1988)\n\n1968: The Beat Goes On (1989)\n\n1969: The Beat Goes On (1989)\n\nTrack 4 on the original pressings is \"Sugar Sugar\".\n\nTrack 4 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Grazing In The Grass\".\n\nTracks 1-3, 5-18, and 20-22 are digitally exactly 0.7 dB louder on the RE-1 reissue. Track 19 is digitally exactly 0.6 dB louder on the RE-1 reissue.\n\n1966: Shakin' All Over (1989)\n\n1965: Shakin' All Over (1989)\n\n1967: Shakin' All Over (1989)\n\n1964: Shakin' All Over (1989)\n\nTrack 17 on the original pressings is \"Steal Away\".\n\nTrack 17 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Saturday Night At The Movies\".\n\nRock Renaissance (1989) \"RE-1\" reissue; it's not clear if Time-Life ever released a version without the RE-1.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (1989)\n\n1968: Shakin' All Over (1989)\n\n1969: Shakin' All Over (1990)\n\nRock Renaissance II (1990)\n\n1966: Blowin' Your Mind (1990) \"RE-1\" reissue; it's not clear if Time-Life ever released a version without the RE-1.\n\n1965: Blowin' Your Mind (1990)\n\n1967: Blowin' Your Mind (1990)\n\nOn the Soul Side (1990)\n\nRock Renaissance III (1990)\n\n1968: Blowin' Your Mind (1991)\n\nOn the Soul Side II (1991)\n\nGarage Rock Nuggets (1991)\n\nRock Renaissance IV (1991)\n\nTotally Fantastic '60s (1996)\n\nYear-by-year volumes of country music, covering 1950 through 1972. Each volume is a single disc with 24 tracks. This was Time-Life's first series that was not manufactured exclusively by Warner Special Products. I noticed some tracks had their left and right channels swapped, but I haven't spent enough time with this set to determine if it's entire discs or just isolated tracks. The Time-Life numbering scheme is CTD-xx.\n\n1961 (released 1988)\n\n1957 (1988)\n\n1962 (1988)\n\n1970 (1988)\n\n1971 (1989)\n\n1968 (1989)\n\n1958 (1989)\n\n1969 (1989)\n\n1959 (1988)\n\n1965 (1989)\n\n1963 (1989)\n\n1960 (1989)\n\n1956 (1990)\n\n1964 (1990)\n\n1954 (1990)\n\n1952 (1990)\n\n1967 (1990)\n\n1972 (1990)\n\n1955 (1991)\n\n1953 (1990)\n\n1966 (1991)\n\n1951 (1991)\n\n1950 (1991)\n\nThe definitive 1940s set. Bill Inglot was involved with Vols. 1-31, making those volumes essential for 1940s pop. This was Time-Life's second of only two early series that were not manufactured exclusively by Warner Special Products. The Time-Life numbering scheme is HPD-xx.\n\n1951 (released 1988)\n\n1950 (1988)\n\n1953 (1989)\n\n1945 (1989)\n\n1952 (1989)\n\n1949 (1989)\n\n1954 (1989)\n\n1946 (1989)\n\n1955 (1989)\n\n1947 (1989)\n\n1958 (1990)\n\n1948 (1990)\n\n1959 (1990)\n\n1944 (1990)\n\n1956 (1990)\n\n1941 (1990)\n\n1957 (1990)\n\n1942 (1990)\n\nThe Early '50s (1991)\n\n1943 (1991)\n\nThe Mid '50s (1991)\n\n1940 (1991)\n\nThe Late '50s (1991)\n\nThe War Years (1991)\n\nThe '50s (1991)\n\nThe Late '40s (1991)\n\nThe Unforgettable '50s (1991)\n\nThe Fabulous '50s (1992)\n\nThe '40s (1992)\n\n'50s Instrumentals (1992)\n\nThe '50s Forever (1992)\n\nInto The '60s (1992)\n\nThe Early '60s (1993)\n\n'60s Instrumentals (1993)\n\nThe Fun-Time '50s And '60s (1993)\n\nThe '50s Pop Revival (1993)\n\nThe '60s (1993)\n\nThe '50s Generation (1993)\n\n'60s Instrumentals Take Two (1993)\n\nGolden Goofers (1993)\n\nTime-Life's mainstream 1970s pop series, billed in their promotional material as \"the '70s greatest hits\".\n\nFor 1970s material, my radio show's permanent library included all of these volumes, Abba's Gold, possibly a hits collection from Earth, Wind & Fire and Elvis Costello, and not much else. These discs really are the be-all/end-all of 1970s US pop.\n\nThe initial run of this series, released from 1989 to 1994, was numbered SOD-xx.\n\n1970 (released 1989)\n\n1971 (1989)\n\nJerry Garcia is on the front cover of the original artwork.\n\nMarvin Gaye is on the front cover of the (far more common) reissue artwork. The two releases have identical audio.\n\n1972 (1989)\n\n1976 (1989) \"RE-1\" reissue; it's not clear if Time-Life ever released a version without the RE-1.\n\n1977 (1990)\n\nTrack 2 on the original pressings is \"Dancing Queen\".\n\nTrack 2 on the (far more common) \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Serpentine Fire\".\n\n1973 (1990)\n\n1974 (1990)\n\nJoni Mitchell is on the front cover of one pressing.\n\nSome leaves are on the front cover of a more common pressing. The two releases have identical audio.\n\n1975 (1990)\n\n1979 (1990)\n\n1978 (1990)\n\nThe Bee Gees are on the front cover of the original artwork.\n\nA guitarist is on the front cover of the reissue artwork. The two releases have identical audio.\n\n1970: Take Two (1990)\n\n1971: Take Two (1990)\n\n1972: Take Two (1991) \"RE-1\" reissue; it's not clear if Time-Life ever released a version without the RE-1.\n\n1973: Take Two (1991)\n\n1974: Take Two (1991)\n\n1975: Take Two (1991)\n\n1977: Take Two (1991)\n\nTrack 14 on the original pressings is \"Sleepwalker\".\n\nTrack 14 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Don't Stop\".\n\n1976: Take Two (1991)\n\nTrack 2 on the original pressings is \"The Boys Are Back In Town\".\n\nTrack 2 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Over My Head\".\n\n1979: Take Two (1991)\n\n1978: Take Two (1991)\n\nTrack 7 on the original pressings is \"A Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy\".\n\nTrack 7 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Every Kinda People\".\n\nRock 'N' Soul Seventies (1991)\n\nSeventies Top Forty (1992)\n\nTrack 9 on the original pressings is \"Little Willy\".\n\nTrack 9 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"I Need You\".\n\nGuitar Power (1992)\n\nTracks 4, 8, 10, 12, and 15 on the original pressings (I assume that it's the original pressing because it includes a Kinks song, and no one has reported owning a version with RE-1 or no RE in the matrix number) are \"Lady Love\", \"Locomotive Breath\", \"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\", \"Blues Power\", and \"Juke Box Music\".\n\nTracks 4, 8, 10, 12, and 15 on the reissue with catalog number R942-23 are \"Bad Case Of Loving You\", \"Funk #49\", \"Yank Me, Crank Me\", \"Fool For The City\", and \"Easy Rider (Let The Wind Pay The Way)\".\n\nFM Rock (1992)\n\nSeventies Generation (1992)\n\nFM Rock II (1992)\n\nDance Fever (1992) \"RE-1\" reissue; it's not clear if Time-Life ever released a version without the RE-1.\n\nFM Rock III (1992)\n\nTrack 2 on the \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Take Me To The Pilot\"; it's not clear if Time-Life ever released a version without the RE-1.\n\nTrack 2 on the \"RE-2\" reissue is \"Nobody\".\n\nFM Rock IV (1993)\n\nTracks 13 and 18 on the original pressings are \"(You Got To Walk And) Don't Look Back\" and \"Bridge Of Sighs\".

But in 1994, Time-Life felt that Celebration should be part of the series, as evidenced by pages of this Time-Life catalog, mailed to me in October 1994.\n\nHere is mastering information, as printed verbatim in the booklets:\n\nVols. 1-3 and 7: \"Digitally remastered at K-Disc, Hollywood, Calif.; Ken Perry, engineer\"\n\nVols. 4 and 6: \"Digitally remastered at A & M; Ken Perry, engineer\"\n\nVol. 5: \"Digitally remastered at MCA Recording Studio, North Hollywood, Calif.; Jim Phillips, engineer\"\n\nVols. 8-25: \"Digitally remastered at MCA Recording Studio, North Hollywood, Calif.\"\n\nVols. 26, 27, and 29-31: \"Digitally remastered at Hit and Run Studios, Rockville, Md.

R840-05 through R840-10 are a subseries called '70s Dance Party, all of which are mastered by Dennis Drake. These are superb disco collections - among the very best I've ever encountered.\n\nVol. R840-10 is the same as volume SOD-09, with the same track order and mastering but new packaging.\n\nMid-1960s to mid-1970 light pop, similar in flavor to Rhino’s Have A Nice Day CDs. There is a lot of overlap with other Time-Life series. All are single CDs, with twenty-one or twenty-two tracks each. Sonically, many of the early discs have levels that are too low. Several discs have all of their tracks with left and right channels swapped. Many tracks shorten the very tail of the fade. From 1994 to 1996, Time-Life repackaged Vols. 1-20 of Superhits as Vols. 1-20 of the AM Gold series (but in a different order), with the same track listing and mastering, but new artwork.\n\nSuperhits (numbering scheme is SUD-xx):\n\n1966 (released 1990) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 9\n\n1968 (1990) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 4\n\n1965 (1990) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 10\n\n1970 (1990) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 2\n\n1967 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 8\n\n1962 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 18\n\n1969 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 1\n\n1963 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 17\n\n1964 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 11\n\n1971 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 6\n\n1972 (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 7\n\nThe Mid-'60s (1991) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 5\n\n1973 (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 3\n\nThe Late '60s (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 14\n\nThe Early '60s (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 19\n\nThe Early '70s (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 13\n\nMid-'60s Classics (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 16\n\nLate-'60s Classics (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 12\n\nEarly-'60s Classics (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 20\n\nEarly '70s Classics (1992) - reissued as AM Gold Vol. 15\n\nCarpenters Collection (1993)\n\nAM Gold (numbering scheme AM1-xx for early volumes, R984-xx for later volumes):\n\n1969 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 7\n\n1970 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 4\n\n1973 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 13\n\n1968 (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 2\n\nThe Mid-'60s (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 12\n\n1971 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 10\n\nTracks 6 and 11 on Superhits and on original pressings are \"Sweet City Woman\" and \"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\"\n\nTracks 6 and 11 on \"RE-1\" reissue are \"Brand New Key\" and \"Mr. Bojangles\"\n\n1972 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 11\n\nTrack 7 on Superhits and on original pressings is \"Nice To Be With You\"\n\nTrack 7 on \"RE-1\" reissue is \"Long Cool Woman (In A Black Dress)\"\n\n1967 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 5\n\n1966 (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 1\n\n1965 (1994) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 3\n\n1964 (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 9\n\nLate-'60s Classics (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 18\n\nThe Early '70s (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 16\n\nThe Late '60s (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 14\n\nEarly '70s Classics (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 20\n\nTracks 7 and 14 on Superhits and on original release are \"Sweet Mary\" and \"Hitchin' A Ride\"\n\nTracks 7 and 14 on \"RE-1\" reissue are \"We May Never Pass This Way (Again)\" and \"Right Place Wrong Time\"\n\nMid-'60s Classics (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 17\n\n1963 (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 8\n\n1962 (1995) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 6\n\nThe Early '60s (1996) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 15\n\nEarly-'60s Classics (1996) - reissue of Superhits Vol. 19\n\nTrack 6 on Superhits and original release is \"Puppy Love\"\n\nTrack 6 on \"RE-1\" reissue is \"A Little Bitty Tear\"\n\n1974 (1996)\n\n1975 (1996)\n\n1976 (1996)\n\n1977 (1997)\n\n1978 (1997)\n\n1979 (1997)\n\nTV Themes Of The '60s (1996)\n\nTeen Idols Of the '70s (1999)\n\n#1 Hits Of The '70s: '70-'74 (2000)\n\n#1 Hits Of The '70s: '75-'79 (2000)\n\nMellow Hits Of The '70s (2000)\n\n[likely doesn't exist]\n\nThe '60s Generation (2001)\n\nSmash Hits Of The '70s (2001)\n\nPerfect Harmony (2002)\n\nRockin' Down The Highway (2004)\n\nMainstream R&B series covering the mid-1950s to the early 1970s. From 1990 to 1992, Time-Life released Vols. 1-20 of the Rhythm & Blues series. Time-Life introduced the Solid Gold Soul series in 1996. Throughout 1996 and 1997, Time-Life repackaged 17 of the first 20 volumes of Rhythm & Blues series as releases in the Solid Gold Soul series. The Solid Gold Soul releases included updated artwork and packaging, but used the same track listings and masterings. In 1996, Time-Life released the yearly collections for 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976 simultaneously in the Rhythm & Blues series (as Vols. 21-24) and the Solid Gold Soul series (as Vols. 8-11). There were no further releases for the Rhythm & Blues series beyond Vol. 24 in 1996. The Solid Gold Soul series continued with new releases until about 2001. Steve Carr mastered the 1990-1992 releases. Dennis Drake mastered the releases from 1996 onward.\n\nRhythm & Blues (numbering scheme RHD-xx):\n\n1966 (1990) - reissued as SGS Vol. 1\n\n1963 (1990) - reissued as SGS Vol. 14\n\n1959 (1990) - reissued as SGS Vol. 21\n\n1968 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 3\n\n1956 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 24\n\nRay Charles 1954-1966 (1991)\n\n1965 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 12\n\n1957 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 23\n\n1971 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 6\n\n1967 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 2\n\n1962 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 18\n\n1964 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 13\n\n1969 (1991) - reissued as SGS Vol. 4\n\n1961 (1992) - reissued as SGS Vol. 19\n\n1960 (1992) - reissued as SGS Vol. 20\n\n1958 (1992) - reissued as SGS Vol. 22\n\n1955 (1992)\n\n1970 (1992) - reissued as SGS Vol. 5\n\n1954 (1992)\n\n1972 (1992) - reissued as SGS Vol. 7\n\n1974 (1996) - also released as SGS Vol. 9\n\n1975 (1996) - also released as SGS Vol. 10\n\n1976 (1996) - also released as SGS Vol. 11\n\n1973 (1996) - also released as SGS Vol. 8\n\nSolid Gold Soul (numbering scheme R838-xx):\n\n1966 (1990) - reissue of R&B Vol. 1\n\n1967 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 10\n\n1968 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 4\n\n1969 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 13\n\n1970 (1996) - reissue of R&B Vol. 18\n\n1971 (1996) - reissue of R&B Vol. 9\n\n1972 (1996) - reissue of R&B Vol. 20\n\n1973 (1996) - also released as R&B Vol. 24\n\n1974 (1996) - also released as R&B Vol. 21\n\n1975 (1996) - also released as R&B Vol. 22\n\n1976 (1996) - also released as R&B Vol. 23\n\n1965 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 7\n\n1964 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 12\n\n1963 (1990) - reissue of R&B Vol. 2\n\n1979 (1997)\n\n1977 (1997)\n\n1978 (1997)\n\n1962 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 11\n\n1961 (1992) - reissue of R&B Vol. 14\n\n1960 (1992) - reissue of R&B Vol. 15\n\n1959 (1990) - reissue of R&B Vol. 3\n\n1958 (1992) - reissue of R&B Vol. 16\n\n1957 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 8\n\n1956 (1991) - reissue of R&B Vol. 5\n\nEarly '80s (1999)\n\nMid-'80s (2000)\n\nDeep Soul (1999)\n\nInspiration (2000)\n\nMake It Funky (2001)\n\nSuperbad: Soul Of The City (2001)\n\nOld School Love Affair (2001)\n\nSingle-disc volumes devoted to time frames, rather than individual years.

Because each volume was devoted to a cluster of about five years, rather than a single year, the series didn't work well with the serial subscription business model. They sold poorly, and the series was scrapped after just eight volumes. Too bad; these were extremely well done.

All are single CDs, with seventeen to twenty-one tracks each. Levels are all pretty consistent, with no clipping at all. Graphics are all the same, with lots of red. Vols. 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16-20, 24, 25, and 27 have some tracks that are digital clones of existing CDs. Vol. 3 has many tracks with their left and right channels reversed. Vols. 1-16 are mastered by Steve Carr. Vols. 19-21, 26, and 27 are mastered by Dennis Drake. Vols. 17-18 and 22-25 don’t list a mastering engineer.

Vol. 25-30 form a subseries called The Rolling Stone Collection. On the whole, they’re very good, but not perfect. Vols. 1-4 and 25 include many tracks that use the same analog transfers as existing CDs. Vols. 5-24 and 26-32 include many tracks that are digital clones of existing CDs. Vols. 5, 6, 8, 9, and 24 include some additional compression on some tracks, compared to those earlier CDs; avoid these if possible. Vols. 14, 17, 18, 20, 22, and 23 are mastered by Dennis Drake.

Vols. 7 and 13-22 are mastered by Dennis Drake. Many tracks on all discs are digital clones of existing CDs. This series marks Time-Life's first foray into releasing two-CD sets. They weren't sure at first; the first six volumes were available in both two-CD sets (with twenty-four tracks total) and one-CD sets (with eighteen tracks, all of which appear on the two-CD version). The two-CD sets proved more popular; the rest of the volumes were available only as two-CD sets, with twelve tracks per CD. Just about all subsequent series would use two-CD sets. Additional Vols. 21 and 22 were released in 2000 and 2001, respectively, two and three years after the original series ended. The Time-Life numbering scheme for the two-CD sets is R834-xx.\n\nForever Yours (released 1996)\n\nJust For You (1996)\n\nMoonlight Nights (1996)\n\nTogether Forever (1996)\n\nSealed With A Kiss (1996)\n\nOnly You (1996)\n\nHearts In Motion (1996)\n\nOn My Mind (1996)\n\nMagic Moments (1996)\n\nFrom The Heart (1997)\n\nAfter Dark (1997)\n\nBy Candlelight (1997)\n\nJust The Two Of Us (1997)\n\nLove And Tenderness (1997)\n\nOnce In A Lifetime (1997)\n\nSweet Nothings (1997)\n\nHeart To Heart (1997)\n\nRomantic Moments (1998)\n\nAlways And Forever (1998)\n\nHeart And Soul (1998)\n\nHearts On Fire (2000)\n\nForever Love (2001)\n\nThese are two-CD sets, fifteen tracks per disc, all mastered by Dennis Drake. Sound is superb throughout. The Time-Life numbering scheme is R808-xx.\n\nThere are three additional two-CD sets that are unnumbered: Hard To Find Hits (2003), Great Duets (2004), and Honky Tonk Heroes (2004). There are many, many additional unnumbered one-CD volumes released starting in 2003.\n\n1960-1964 (released 1997)\n\n1965-1969 (1998)\n\n1950-1959 (1998)\n\n1970-1974 (1998)\n\n1975-1979 (1998)\n\nGolden '50s (1998)\n\nGolden '60s (1998)\n\nGolden '70s (1998)\n\nGolden '40s (1999)\n\nThe Nashville Era 1958-1963 (1999)\n\n1980-1984 (1999)\n\n1964-1968 (1999)\n\nHonky-Tonkin' 1952-1957 (1999)\n\n1969-1975 (1999)\n\nThe Sixties Legends (1999)\n\nThe Fifties Legends (1999)\n\nThe '60s Treasures (2000)\n\nThe '50s Treasures (2000)\n\nThe '70s Treasures (1999)\n\n1941-1951 (2000)\n\nGreat Story Songs (2001)\n\nGreat Country Gospel (2001)\n\nGreat Country Gospel II (2001)\n\nGreat Story Songs II (2002)\n\n?\n\nQueens of Country (2003)\n\nThese are all two-CD sets, and all feature a previously unreleased Elvis track. This is a lot of Elvis and includes just about all his Hot 100 singles except for about three later ones. All discs are mastered by Dennis Drake. I suspect that many of the tracks are digital clones of the RCA five-CD sets covering the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s decades. A single-CD Christmas volume was released in 2000 as Vol. 16. Vol. 15 is the European version of the Christmas CD, which seems to be the same as the US version in every way except the volume number. The Time-Life numbering scheme is R806-xx.\n\nLove Songs (released 1997)\n\nRock 'N' Roll (1997)\n\nFrom The Heart (1998)\n\nCountry (1998)\n\nMovie Magic (1997)\n\nThe Rocker (1998)\n\nThe Romantic (1998)\n\nRhythm And Blues (1998)\n\nGospel (1998)\n\nTreasures 1953-1958 (1998)\n\nTreasures 1960-1963 (1998)\n\nTreasures 1964-1969 (1999)\n\nTreasures 1970-1976 (1999)\n\nFun At The Movies (1999)\n\n[European version of Christmas CD]\n\nChristmas (2000)\n\nThese are two-CD sets, similar in flavor to Rhino’s Smooth Grooves discs.
