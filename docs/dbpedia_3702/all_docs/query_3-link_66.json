        "text": "Simon Taffe, founder and curator of End of the Road, is set to release a special compilation of the tracks that he’s played out over the festival site when and where the live artists are not performing. It’s out on 16 September, and entitledÂ Between The Music; Taffe had the following to say about the project:\n\nâ[It’s] a compilation based on all the tracks that I play in between bands on all the different stages. Itâs not really necessarily bands that play End of the Road, itâs more like my whole record collection. I still get really excited to make a compilation, even though itâs a lot bloody harder these days because everyoneâs heard everything on Spotify. But I love sharing music with people and love introducing them to songs.”\n\nThe compilation features the likes of The Lafayettes, Lael Neale, Paul Robeson and tons more. The plan is for Between The Music to become an ongoing series, showcasing the best deep cuts and rarities hand-selected by the EOTR guru. You can pre-order the record here;Â if you’re going to the festival this year, there’ll be an exclusive clear vinyl run to purchase onsite.\n\nAs usual, the EOTR team have smashed it with the lineup this year. Attendees to the event at Larmer Tree Gardens will be able to catch the likes of Pixies,Â Bright Eyes,Â Fleet Foxes,Â Khruangbin, NilÃ¼fer Yanya,Â Yard Act,Â Deathcrash,Â Black Midi,Â Perfume Genius,Â Moor Mother,Â Nala Sinephro,Â Cassandra Jenkins, Part Chimp,Â Audiobooks, Lucy Dacus, Ross From Friends, Sudan Archives, Emma-Jean Thackray, Soccer Mommy, Los Bitchos, AnaÃ¯s Mitchell, KEYAH/BLU, Alabaster DePlume, Modern Woman, Grove, Aldous Harding, Tinariwen and so many more.
