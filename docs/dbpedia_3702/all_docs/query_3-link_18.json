        "text": "The triple-whammy of iTunes, YouTube and Spotify was supposed to kill off the compilation album, but it seems its demise has been greatly exaggerated. Based on new figures from the BPI, officially released next month, compilation sales have grown significantly in the UK for the first time in a decade.\n\nIn 2012, more than 20.6m compilation albums were sold in Britain, up from 19.2m the year before. Barring a minuscule uptick in 2007, compilation album sales have been falling steadily since 2004, when 39m were sold: iTunes arrived in the UK that year, allowing consumers for the first time to buy just the tracks they wanted. Streaming services such as Spotify, Rdio and Deezer were presumed to be accelerating that process.\n\nYet faced with so much online choice, consumers are seemingly rediscovering the joy of a well-curated compilation – and, ironically, downloads are powering the revival. Compilations are the fastest-growing part of the digital albums market: back in 2006, just 0.4% of compilation albums were sold as downloads but by last year this had grown to 23.5%. Inevitably the Now That's What I Call Music! franchise dominated, with nine of the 20 biggest compilations last year (and taking all top four places).\n\nOther big sellers showed the power of a strong theme or brand – notably dance titles Anthems 90 and XX – Twenty Years (both from Ministry Of Sound) as well as Isles of Wonder (the music used in the Olympics opening ceremony), Be My Baby (a 60s female pop collection), Dreamboats & Petticoats 6 (predominantly music from the 1950s) and Motown Anthems. Their 7.2% growth in 2012 is carrying through to 2013, too – with sales in the first three months of this year up 11.8% from the opening quarter of 2012.Compilations are the gateway drug for many pop fans, bulging with the hits they know and the odd track they might never have heard. Often pushed to 40 or more songs, they often offered greater value for money than many 12-track artist albums that sold for around the same price. Titles like Motown Chartbusters might have established the compilation album in the 1960s, but the golden era was really the mid-1980s through to the late-1990s. Here were double albums that were wonderfully erratic in their genre selections and whose only duty was to reflect the charts , meaning pop sat cheek by jowl with dance, indie, rock and that freak hit by a geriatric legend having a final swing at fame. Truly, all of pop life was here.\n\nNow, in an age of digital ubiquity and the tyranny of too much choice, mainstream consumers are starting to lean again on trusted handrails to guide them through the music of today and yesterday. While services such as Last.fm, Pandora, The Hype Machine and even Twitter's recent music app are all trying to crack accelerated music discovery for those at the cutting edge, it is established compilation brands (The Now … series turns 30 this November) that are weathering the format storms best.\n\nDorian Lynskey's top 10 compilations\n\nAnthology of American Folk Music (Folkways, 1952)\n\nHarry Smith's eccentric, obsessive labour of love informed a generation.\n\nNuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era 1965-1968 (Elektra, 1972)\n\nEnduring and influential chronicle of garage rock's reckless youth.\n\nSaturday Night Fever (RSO, 1977)\n\nSome soundtracks transcend their movies, like this disco classic.\n\nNow That's What I Call Music! (1983-present)\n\nThe Top 40's answer to Hansard. Your favourite's probably your first one.\n\nBack to Mono (1958-1969) (ABKCO, 1991)\n\nFour-disc anthology of visionary Phil Spector in his Wall of Sound glory days.\n\n200% Dynamite (Soul Jazz, 1999)\n\nExuberant celebration of Jamaican music from Britain's finest compilation label.\n\nTamla Motown Gold: The Sound of Young America (Universal, 2001)\n\nMotown was good at albums but exceptional at singles. This 82-track collection is joy unconfined.\n\nSay It Loud! A Celebration of Black Music in America (Rhino, 2001)\n\nExtraordinary six-CD history lesson, from Scott Joplin to Coolio.\n\n2 Many DJs: As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2 (2002)\n\nThrill-packed highlight of the early 00s mash-up craze.\n\nMary Anne Hobbs: 2Warrior Dubz (Planet Mu, 2006)\n\nRising dance scenes need compilations to document them. This helped define dubstep."
