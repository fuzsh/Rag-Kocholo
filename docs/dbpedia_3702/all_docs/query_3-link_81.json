U2 did not participate in that song, however, they did contribute “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” to this compilation. The album was put together for the Earth Summit in 1992, and funds raised through the album were used in support of conservation work in the rainforests. The version of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” is simply the studio version found on “The Joshua Tree”.\n\nAn earlier album involving the founders of ELF, used a background track of nature sounds as the musical background for environmental lyrics. Those nature sounds were used on the Earthrise albums, and “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” was also released on a promotional single for the project, which was a different mix than the album version. On the promotional CD they added approximately 20 seconds of these nature sounds at the start of the track, but the version of the song was still that from “The Joshua Tree” now mixed with some of these environmental sounds. In 2005 a second album was released, this time titled “Earthrise II: Artists for the Environment”. U2 would also lend a track to this compilation, this time the “Temple Bar” edit of “Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses”, but that too was an extended version with added nature noises, but this time at the end of the track. In 1999, U2 would again contribute a track to the ELF, this time “Mofo (Phunk Phorce Mix)” was used on the double CD, “Planet Electrica: Protection”. The proceeds from this later album went to the people of Honduras, in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.\n\nLiner Notes\n\nRelated Promotional Videos\n\nRelated News"
