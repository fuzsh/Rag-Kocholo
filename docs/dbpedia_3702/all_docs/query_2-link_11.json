        "text": "Hello, there is no way I can display compilation albums in album release year order as the individual track production year may be decades different from the release date of the compilation CD. I have recently requested to Apple via iTunes feedback that they add a new field for ALBUM YEAR which can be manually populated. If it is left blank, the default would be as present, the year on the most recent track in the album. This way, all individual songs can be sorted into the year they were recorded, and at the same time, all albums can be sorted into the year they were released.\n\nI have a large collection of over 32,000 tracks so this level of sorting sophistication is important to me. I have gone to the effort to have the correct year assigned to every single track in my collection, but this means compilation albums mostly show up nowhere near their release date in album grid view, when shown in date order...\n\nIf you agree with this additional field being a good idea, please also submit a feedback enhancement request to Apple via the iTunes app. Please just cut and paste this for content if you don't want to write your own submission. ðŸ™‚\n\nI agree that this would be a useful enhancement though I'd prefer to see both an original release date (y/m/d) and an edition release date. However, the iTunes data model is unlikely to support any of this as it doesn't appear to even recognize \"album\" as a primary concept - all metadata is held at the individual track level and it is this metadata that's used to group songs into albums in the presentation layer.\n\nAs a workaround, I use a somewhat esoteric scheme that populates the Sort Album field with a concatenation of the artist (most significant of Sort Album Artist, Album Artist, Sort Artist and Artist) with the album release date in yyyymmdd format. The result of this (if applied consistently throughout a library) is that sorting albums by Artist and Title actually gives a chronological correct listing by artist and then by release date."
