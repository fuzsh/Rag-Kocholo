        "text": "Jimmie Rodgers considered by many to be the father of Country Music began his career with the railroad at the age of fourteen following in his father, Aaron's footsteps. In 1911, he went to work as a brakeman but had to cut his railroading career short because of contracting consumption in 1924. The following year he entered show business as a black face singer & banjo player. He began his recording career with Victor Talking Machine Company in Bristol, Tennessee in 1927. Earlier that year he had been appearing on radio station WWNG in Asheville, North Carolina. In five short years he rose from an unknown Tennessee hillbilly singer to one of the greatest entertainers & recording artists of the twentieth century. He made millions & he spent the millions as fast as he made them. In 1933, needing to replenish his funds, he travelled to New York city to make some recordings. He was so weak from the ravages of consumption that a cot had to be placed in the recording studio allowing him to rest in between takes. One week into his recording session Jimmie Rodgers finally lost the battle with his only enemy, consumption. He had recorded twelve songs during that session. In 1961 Jimmie Rodgers became the first member in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nBlues legend Blind Lemon Jefferson has been called the most influential bluesman in the history of blues singers. While his recording career was prolific but short--almost 100 titles from 1926-29--he became arguably the most popular blues singer in black America.\n\nBorn in Couchman, TX, in 1897, he was one of seven children. Blind from birth, he learned how to play the guitar in order to scrape together money to make a living. In 1917 he moved from his rural East Texas home to Dallas, where he played on street corners in the Deep Ellum section of the city for spare change. His lyrical skills, offbeat and intricate guitar style and showmanship attracted regular customers, and he was eventually able to earn enough money to support a wife and child. In addition to the blues, he also played spirituals, work songs and folk tunes, He traveled around the South, played in the Mississippi Delta, and in 1925 a record-store owner in Dallas recommended him to a contact at Paramount Records. Executives there liked his style and invited him to Chicago to record. He recorded some songs under the name Deacon L.J. Bates, and his recordings were critical and financial successes. He also recorded many of his own compositions, such as \"Match Box Blues\", \"See That My Grave is Kept Clean\" and \"That Black Snake Moan\".\n\nHe died in 1929, although there was no official certificate of death. There are various stories about how he died--one is that he froze to death in a Chicago snowstorm, another is that a sudden heart attack killed him. In 1980 he was inducted into the Blues Foundation's Hall of Fame.\n\nBlues legend Willie Dixon was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi. His mother was a devoutly religious person who spent much of her time writing religious poems, which gave the young Willie exposure to rhyming and meter. At a young age he sang with a gospel group called the Union Jubilee Singers, who had a show on radio station WQBC in Vicksburg. Dixon and two friends however were arrested after they were caught stealing wood and other items from a doctor's house, and then sent to a prison farm. He briefly gave up singing for a career as a boxer, but soon returned to his first love, music.\n\nHe left Mississippi in 1936 train-hopping to Chicago, which had a vibrant music scene, but he also kept his hand in boxing; in 1937 he became the Illinois Golden Gloves Boxing Champion. He turned pro (and even sparred with heavyweight champion Joe Louis), but after just four professional fights he got into a brawl with his manager in the Illinois Boxing Commissioner's office over money he believed he was being cheated out of, and his boxing career--for all practical purposes--was over. Going back to his musical roots, he took up bass playing, and in 1939 he and guitarist Leonard Caston started a group called The Five Breezes. The group played in Chicago-area clubs and even made a few records, but in 1941 it broke up when Dixon was arrested for refusing to serve in the military, after ignoring draft notices for months. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison.\n\nAfter finishing his sentence he formed another group, The Four Jumps of Jive, which made the rounds of Chicago's clubs, and even cut a few singles for Mercury Records. He later formed yet another group, with his old friend Caston and Bernardo Dennis, called The Big Three. At the same time Dixon was playing in the city's South Side blues clubs with such greats as Muddy Waters. He was playing one night in 1948 at the Macomba Lounge when he met brothers Phil Chess and Leonard Chess, the club's owners who had just started up Chess Records. They offered Dixon a job at the label as a songwriter and producer, and he soon went to work for them full-time. Soon Chess artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf (aka \"Howlin' Wolf\") and Little Walter were recording songs written by Dixon, which met with great success. Dixon also recorded some singles on his own, but he wasn't as successful a recording artist as he was a songwriter.\n\nIn 1957 Dixon left Chess for Cobra Records, and worked with such legendary guitarists as Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. Unfortunately, Cobra went out of business after two years, and Dixon returned to Chess. In addition to his songwriting and producing chores, he also formed the Chicago Blues All-Stars and toured extensively with them.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s he got involved in composing film soundtracks, and he wrote the score for Martin Scorsese's Die Farbe des Geldes (1986). In 1980 he was inducted into the Blues Foundation's Hall of Fame. He still played clubs, festivals and toured the US and Europe, in addition to his songwriting and producing work. By 1990, however, his health began to decline and he had to cut down on his touring and scale back his performances with the Chicago Blues All-Stars. He died of a heart ailment in Burbank, California, two years later.\n\nCharley and Nora Guthrie named their son after the Democrat elected president that year. Woodrow Wilson Guthrie knew hard times as a youngster (his house burned down, his sister Clara burned to death, his father's small-town business and political careers never went anywhere, his mother suffered from undiagnosed Huntington's Disease and was declared insane), but he enjoyed performing (dancing, playing harmonica, writing songs) and learning (he read voraciously in the public library). In 1933 he married Mary Jennings, five years his junior, with whom he would have three children. In 1935 he joined the Oakies and Arkies driven to California by the Dust Bowl. His songs went from describing the tragedy of the migrants to urging their unionization. Though he wrote a column for the Weekly People, he never joined the Communist Party. When Will Geer got a part in the play \"Tobacco Road\" he invited Woody to join him in New York where he met Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Leadbelly, Cisco Houston. He was commissioned to write songs for a never-completed documentary on Washington State's Grand Coulee Dam, and it was in the Pacific Northwest that his family left him. Back in New York in 1940, Woody joined Pete Seeger's Alamanc Singers and married Martha Graham dancer Marjorie Mazia. His autobiography, Bound for Glory, was published in 1943. He served in the Merchant Marine in World War II, and three ships were torpedoed from under him. In 1947 his and Marjorie's daughter, Cathy, was burned to death in an apartment fire. They had three more children: Arlo, Joady and Nora. In 1953 he married for a third time, to Anneke Van Kirk. They had a child, Lorinna Lynn Guthrie. When Anneke and Guthrie divorced, their daughter was adopted by a couple they knew, and did not have any further contact with Guthrie. Lorinna died prematurely (at age 19) in 1973, in a car accident in California.\n\nIn the 1950s he experienced bouts of irrational behavior and was often unable to play his guitar; his condition was ultimately diagnosed as Huntington's Disease. The rest of that decade and into the 1960s a new generation, notably including Bob Dylan, began to discover and play his music, adapting some of it to the new Civil Rights movement.\n\nSixteen-year-old Pete Seeger enrolled at the Avon Old Farms School in Connecticut and then decided to become a hermit. His life since then has been one social cause after another, buoyed by an almost indefatigable career as a self-described \"sing-along leader.\"\n\nDuring the 1930s he attended Harvard, from which his musicologist father Charles Seeger (a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and a conscientious objector during World War I) had graduated in 1908. As an alternative to his major, Sociology (which he disliked), he played tenor banjo (failing to make the Harvard Jazz Band) and participated in the pacifist/communist Harvard Student Union so much that he lost his scholarship, leaving Harvard in 1938. In 1939 actor/folksinger 'Will Geer' organized the \"All-American Left-Wing Folk-Song Revival Movement,\" a benefit concert for migrant workers in California. It was there that Pete met Woody Guthrie and began touring with him. In 1940 Seeger started the Almanac Singers with Lee Hays, Pete Hawes and Millard Lampell; during his tours with this pro-union, anti-war group the FBI began a file on him. The group broke up at the start of World War II (Seeger enlisted in the army; Guthrie entered the Merchant Marine). After the war he started People's Songs (later Sing Out!), and in 1949 formed a new group, The Weavers, with Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman and Ronnie Gilbert'. For years he had trouble with the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and was, effectively, blacklisted. He recorded dozens of albums (Columbia, Folkways) and wrote thousands of songs, among which are \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone,\" \"If I Had a Hammer,\" and \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" (which in the 1960s became a huge hit for The Byrds). He helped start the Greenwich Village music magazine Broadside in the 1960s and reorganized the Newport Folk Festival. In 1996 the North American Folk Music and Dance Alliance awarded him its first Lifetime Achievement Award. He helped start Clearwater, an organization which sails a 106-foot boat along the Hudson River to show children the dangers of pollution.\n\nDoc was blind from infancy due to an eye infection before his first birthday. He grew up playing harmonica and a homemade banjo but learned guitar after his father bought him a $12 Stella acoustic when he was 13. He attended North Carolina's school for the visually impaired. He was born Arthel Lane Watson and picked up the nickname \"Doc\" at the suggestion of an audience member at a radio broadcast when he was in his teens. Watson was instrumental in developing the canon for 1960s folk musicians with his recordings of traditional tunes like Deep River Blues and Shady Grove; he didn't play just the music of the Appalachian Mountains. Before folklorist and musician Ralph Rinzler first recorded him backing old-time banjo player Clarence \"Tom\" Ashley in 1960, he worked with a local dance band, playing honky-tonk, rockabilly, pop and square-dance tunes. 1999 saw a release of a compilation album The Best of Doc Watson 1964-1968.He was a master of both finger-picking and flat-picking styles. In 1997, Watson received the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton. In 2000, Watson was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in Owensboro, Kentucky. Watson also won seven Grammys over a 33-year period and received Grammy's lifetime achievement award in 2004. For many years, Watson toured with his son, Merle Watson, who died in a 1985 tractor accident. Merle's memory is honored by MerleFest, an annual North Carolina roots-music festival that the elder Watson hosted. Held on the last weekend in April since 1988, MerleFest draws more than 75,000 annually to Wilkes Community College in Wilkesboro, N.C. In late May 2012, Watson was listed in critical condition but was responsive at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, after undergoing colon surgery. The 89-year-old Watson had fallen early in the week. No bones were broken, but an underlying condition prompted the surgery. He passed May 29, 2012 after surgery.\n\nComposer, songwriter and actor Stan Jones was born in Douglas, Arizona, on June 5, 1914. He learned to ride horses as a child, a skill that came in handy later in his life (as did his talent for singing and playing the guitar). After his father died his mother moved the family to Los Angeles. He attended UC Berkeley for a time, and began riding the rodeo circuit in his spare time to make money. He dropped out of college in 1934, however, to join the navy, and after his discharge held a variety of jobs all over the country, including copper miner, logger and snowplow driver. He was hired as a firefighter by the US Forest Service, and later became a Forest Ranger, being assigned to various national parks in the western US.\n\nWhile stationed at Death Valley, California, in 1948, he was assigned to be technical advisor for a western being shot there, The Walking Hills (1949). In between filming, he would sit around with the cast and crew and play various songs he had written. They encouraged him to try to get the songs published, and he eventually sent his compositions to several music publishers. One of his songs was picked up and recorded by folksinger Burl Ives for Columbia Records, \"Riders in the Sky\". It was then recorded by Bing Crosby and, under the title \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\", by Vaughn Monroe, whose version became a major hit, so much so that cowboy actor Gene Autry filmed a movie using the title (Gespensterreiter (1949)), in addition to recording the song itself, and Stan's career was off and running. His songs were used in two westerns by acclaimed director John Ford -- Westlich St. Louis (1950) and Rio Grande (1950), in which Stan also played a cavalry sergeant -- and Autry again made a movie based on another of Stan's songs, Whirlwind (1951), in which Stan also had a small part. His songs were used in a half-dozen more films over the next few years.\n\nIn 1955 actor Harry Carey Jr. was hired by Walt Disney for a TV series called The Adventures of Spin and Marty (1955). Carey had worked with Stan on both \"Wagon Master\" and \"Rio Grande\" and suggested to Disney that Stan be hired to write songs for the show, a suggestion Disney followed. Stan wrote all the songs for the first two seasons of the show (he also made an occasional appearance before the cameras), but for the third season many of the songs were written by others, although some of Stan's were used.\n\nHe later worked on the soundtracks for several Disney films, and was the co-writer for the theme song for the western series Cheyenne (1955). In 1956 he was hired to play Deputy Olson on the modern-day western series The Sheriff of Cochise (1956) (later renamed \"U.S. Marshal\") and in addition wrote the theme song and even some episodes of the show. In 1959 he worked for director John Ford again, writing the songs for his western Der letzte Befehl (1959) and even playing, uncredited, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Then it was back to television work for Disney. His last film as an actor was in Ten Who Dared (1960).\n\nStan Jones died in Los Angeles, California, in 1963.\n\nBorn in Rosine Kentucky, he was the youngest of eight children. Orphaned at age 11 he was raised by his uncle, fiddler Pendleton Vandiver. Learning the fiddle from his mother and taught further by his uncle, at an early age he began playing dances with uncle and brothers. Besides his uncle (whom he immortalized in the song \"Unlce Pen\") his musical inspiration was Arnold Schultz, a black guitarist from whom he learned the blues. By the early 1930s he and his brother Charlie had a successful duo, cutting their first record in 1936, but in 1938 they broke up. In the late 1930s, the first person to make the mandolin a lead instrument in country music, he developed the style that became bluegrass. In has debut at the Grand Old Opry in 1939 he performed a version of 'Rodgers, Jimmy (II)' tune \"Muleskinner Blues\" - this is generally considered the first true bluegrass tune. In the classic band The Bluegrass Boys in the late 1940s he set an instrumental standard for bluegrass that still stands. In later years, with the explosion of interest in bluegrass on college campuses, he began an expanded career with festival appearances. In 1981, battling colon cancer, he wrote and recorded \"My Last Days on Earth\" - those last days lasted another 15 years."
