        "text": "[…continued form last post]\n\nAs it turns out we were a bit hasty with last posting. I focused on some titles at the expense of others due to the time factor in writing these posts. PPM is written during my lunch hour as it’s usually the most free time I have during the day. But as the plentiful comments to the last post have made clear, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.\n\nWhen it comes down to anthologizing Bowie’s decade of 1970-1980, there were several other titles that I shamefully neglected last post. I knowingly left out “ChangesTwoBowie” for no good reason that I could ascertain. And then I forgot all about this one!\n\nDavid Bowie: Original Soundtrack From the Film ChristianE F. – US – LP [1982]\n\nV-2 Schneider\n\nTVC-15 [7″ 3:29 edit]\n\nHeroes / Helden [unique Eng/Ger. mashup mix]\n\nBoys Keep Swinging\n\nSense Of Doubt\n\nStation To Station [live]\n\nLook Back In Anger\n\nStay [3:21 US 7″ edit]\n\nWarszawa\n\nThe OST to “Christiane F.” was released to the 1981 German film “Christiane F. Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Zoo” based on the harrowing memoir of being a teenage heroin addict living in Berlin in the late 70s. Here we see the belated 1982 US release of the album, which now sported a collage with a prominent image of Bowie’s performance as himself in the film. The mix here was strictly on the “Stationtostation” through “Lodger” era, and thus was an unimpeachable focus on the second half of Bowie’s golden decade. Glad to see the jaunty “V-2 Schneider” here but there were a pair of seven inch edits here as well as the live version of “Station To Station” from “Stage” and the German-only mashup of the English/German versions of “Heroes/Helden” at seen at right. In all honesty, this was the Bowie music that teenage Germans should have been listening to in the late 70s, but it was a shame about all of the drugs and prostitution.\n\nDavie Bowie: ChangesTwoBowie – US – LP [1981]\n\nAladdin Sane [1913-1938-197?] / On Broadway\n\nOh! You Pretty Things\n\nStarman\n\n1984\n\nAshes To Ashes\n\nSound And Vision\n\nFashion\n\nWild Is The Wind\n\nJohn I’m Only Dancing (Again) 1975\n\nD.J.\n\n1981 brought a much needed update to the “Changes#” series of Bowie greatest hits compilations, and I always discounted this one, because instead of picking up in 1977 and moving to 1980, it tried to have things both ways. But having only four tracks from “Low” to “Scary Monsters [And Super Creeps]” was a huge error to my eyes. Six of the cuts here retread the same 1972-1976 territory of “ChangesOneBowie.” [insert foghorn SFX] This album should have been able to dive deep into the fertile growth period Bowie had in that time period. When he made my absolute favorite of his music.\n\nAdding insult to injury was the cover design, with a mediocre full color Greg Gorman portrait that had a terrible type treatment as well. It looked enough like the layout to “ChangesOneBowie” to remind you how much better that cover looked in comparison. And it was cheating to include “Wild Is the Wind” just because some RCA exec thought it could stand as a single five years later on the strength of its inclusion here. I remember seeing the video they made for that on MTV in 1982 and being incredulous that they went back in 1981 to make one. The band in the clip had Bowie’s PA Coco Schwab as the guitarist [!] though Mel Gaynor [soon to join Simple Minds] and Tony Visconti were miming as the rhythm section.\n\nDavid Bowie: Golden Years – US – LP [1983]\n\nFashion\n\nRed Sails\n\nLook Back In Anger\n\nI Can’t Explain\n\nAshes To Ashes\n\nGolden Years\n\nJoe The Lion\n\nScary Monsters [And Super Creeps]\n\nWild Is The Wind\n\nThe music it contained seemed to be pretty random with it being yet another ’76-’80 era compilation, but the devil here was in the details. And the details were actually the most interesting thing about this LP. RCA thought it was a good idea to pull tracks from the set lists that Bowie was selling to the “Let’s Dance” tour audience that dated back to his late 70s RCA era! So if Johnny went to see the “Serious Moonlight” tour and wondered about all of those other songs Bowie sang, here they were in a single E-Z package for purchase. Incredible.\n\nNow we’ll repost the poll with all of these albums. Anyone who has already voted may do so again. I could have repopulated your earlier vote in the new poll, but what if you had preferred “ChangesTwoBowie?” It’s not my cup of tea, but your mileage may vary.\n\n-30-"
