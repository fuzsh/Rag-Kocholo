They are organized in folders with the “album name” of the compilation. Inside are files that may or may not have information of the actual album of that track. Most have a track number within their custom compilation.\n\nMy problem is, I have no Idea how to make beets recognize that the current folder is a compilation with that album name.\n\nI want to preserve the folder name and the track numbers, but want to update any other tags if they are wrong or missing. They should be copied into the Compilations folder according to my config.yaml.\n\nI have no idea how to import such compilations, or if it is even possible with beets.\n\nMaybe you can help me\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nThat’s a good idea.\n\nIs there a way to import the folder as an album with the folder name?\n\nRight now if I import the folder it is automatically renamed to the album title of the first track it encounters.\n\nAlso the track numbers are changed, even if I “use as is”.\n\nI am a bit confused right now."
