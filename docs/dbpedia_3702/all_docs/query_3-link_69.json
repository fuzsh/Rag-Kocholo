This was largely by way of introducing me to a larger variety of artists at a cheap price…aka the point of a sampler. So many of my now favorite artists are because I first heard one of their songs on a compilation that was either free with purchase of a featured band or 1.99/2.99 otherwise. Also, fair warning though there are a billion WOW compilation albums it doesn’t make this list falling into the honorable mention category. If I had to pick a year as my favorite though it would likely be 1997 or 1998. Anyway, here we go!\n\n20. Songs from the penalty box Vol. 6 (2009)\n\n19. 7ball Magazine: Gas Compilation 4 (1996)\n\n18. Never Say Dinosaur (1995)\n\n17. Veggie Rocks! (2004)\n\n16. Ten: The Birthday Album Forefront (1998)\n\n15. Seltzer 2 (1998)\n\n14. Awesome God: Rich Mullins Tribute (1998)\n\n13. Strong Hand of Love Mark Heard Tribute (1994)\n\n12. Listen Louder (1999)\n\n11. !Hero The Rock Opera (2002)\n\n10. Seltzer (1996)\n\n9. In the Name of Love (2004)\n\n8. City on a Hill (2000)\n\n7. Streams In The Desert (1999)\n\n6. Along the Road (1994)\n\n5. Roaring Lambs (2000)\n\n4. Simply Fabulous (1997)\n\n3. Exodus (1998)\n\n2. Songs From the Loft (1993)\n\n1. Glory Revealed (2007)\n\nWhat about you?! What were/are your favorite compilation albums in Christian music?\n\nHappy listening everyone!"
