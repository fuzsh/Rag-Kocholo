        "text": "I found what I believe is a resolution to my own question. The discussion Compilations/Various Artists Problem helped to give me a different perspective on the problem. To explain my own understanding, Compilations tend to (from what I've seen) only organize themselves under the 'Compilations' category when they have more than one song in the album. One user in the discussion seemed to suggest that all tracks needed a 'track artist' listed in order for the album to be correctly categorized."
