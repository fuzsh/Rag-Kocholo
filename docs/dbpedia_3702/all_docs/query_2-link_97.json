        "text": "Q. What are Compilation Albums?\n\nA. A compilation album is a collection of songs from various different artists assembled together to create a new music album that offers music not from just a single music artist (as a traditional album does), but from multiple artists, in order to provide variety for the consumer listener.\n\nAudioSparx has multiple channel partners who create compilation albums for AudioSparx from the music on the website here at AudioSparx. Additionally, AudioSparx itself functions as a record label in that we too create and release compilation albums on a regular basis. In 2021 we released over 5,000 new compilation albums alone.\n\nWe and our channel partners distribute the albums we create to numerous different retail and streaming services (DSPs) including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, Deezer, Rhapsody, and others.\n\nOn these types of consumer music streaming/listening decks, any sales of the compilation albums or the single tracks contained on the albums are not sold for any type of commercial use by the end client, they are strictly only for personal listening by the end consumer client. However, the music on the compilation albums is also distributed for use in User-Generated Content (UGC) on social media sites such as Facebook, Snapchat, and TikTok, helping to diversity the types of earnings that occur with the compilation albums.\n\n---."
