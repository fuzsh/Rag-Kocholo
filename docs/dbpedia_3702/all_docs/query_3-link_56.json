        "text": "I was looking at the latest feed on Discogs and noticed a Bowie compilation that was new to me this morning. “Chameleon” was an Australian/New Zealand compilation new to me, and with a very dated line in airbrush art using the now hoary cut-up matrix of Bowie archetypes forming a collage of his various looks. But a glance at the contents was more inspiring! Like all of the compilations we’ll review today, it attempts to be a single disc LP that encompassed the crucial 1970-1980 period upon which Bowie’s reputation actually rests.\n\nAnd that got me thinking of the practicality of making a single LP that could most successfully make the case of Bowie’s artistic relevance to the 70s and beyond. So I started looking at the other compilations for the artist. I discounted the several in the 70s that compiled his proto-“Space Odyssey” material as being of marginal interest at best. What we wanted to consider here were the albums that captured Bowie at his artistic peak. The sort of album that would act as a gateway drug to a lifetime of Bowie fandom. Seeing if there was a clear leader in the field. We’ll start with the grand daddy of them all.\n\nDavid Bowie: ChangesOneBowie – US – LP [1976]\n\nSpace Oddity\n\nJohn, I’m Only Dancing\n\nChanges\n\nZiggy Stardust\n\nSuffragette City\n\nThe Jean Genie\n\nDiamond Dogs\n\nRebel Rebel\n\nYoung Americans\n\nFame\n\nGolden Years\n\nIn 1979, a friend was taking a trip to visit his older brother who had a famously large collection of albums. I gave my friend a few blank tapes and asked him to tape me a few to expand my horizons. The tape I can vividly remember 43 years later was significant. One side was “Ziggy Stardust” and the other was “Changesonebowie.” I had only heard a handful of Bowie songs on the radio by 1979, so “Changesonebowie” was perhaps the most expansive “greatest hits” album possible, with many of the tunes new to my teenage ears. All of them were great songs! And the introspective Hollywood glam shot of Bowie on the cover by Tom Kelley oozed class, intelligence, and panache. Picking up the design cues from the then just out “Stationtostation” didn’t hurt a single bit.\n\nThe one failure for the album I can possibly suggest, was that owing to its release in the spring of 1976, it missed out on the apogee of Bowie’s artistic growth arc. Which I would maintain peaked in the ’76-’80 period. So, as wonderful an enticement to Bowie fandom that this is, it’s missing what I would consider the best work of his career. And in a hard-to-believe factoid, I’ve never owned a copy.\n\nDavid Bowie: Bowie Now – USP – LP [1978]\n\nV-2 Schneider\n\nAlways Crashing In The Same Car\n\nSons Of The Silent Age\n\nBreaking Glass\n\nNeuköln\n\nSpeed Of Life\n\nJoe The Lion\n\nWhat In The World\n\nBlackout\n\nWeeping Wall\n\nThe Secret Life Of Arabia\n\nThis was a US promo designed to get reticent, stick-in-the-mud US DJs and Program Directors to possibly play the two “weird” new albums that Bowie issued in 1977 to deaf ears on the US radio waves. I can say that until I bought my “Nice Price” budget RCA copies of “Low” and “Heroes” in 1981 I had never heard a note from these opuses. Which was a crying shame! This compilation alternated cuts from each of the albums in question and while none would balk at the selections, there was always so much more that could have been included!\n\nI can’t believe that “Heroes” or “Beauty + The Beast” were not here. Nor “Sound + Vision” or “Be My Wife,” either! But, aaaaah…! This was the only one with “The Secret life Of Arabia!” That counted for a lot. In 2018, this album was reissued commercially on white vinyl for Record Store Day, so if it calls to you, it won’t cost an arm and a leg if you can do without an original pressing.\n\nDavid Bowie: Chameleon – OZ – LP [1979]\n\nStarman\n\nAladdin Sane\n\nSorrow\n\nDiamond Dogs\n\n1984\n\nBreaking Glass\n\nHeroes\n\nV-2 Schneider\n\nBeauty And The Beast\n\nBoys Keep Swinging\n\nD.J.\n\nLook Back In Anger\n\nNow this is a fascinating playlist! Side one is a quick sweep through 72-74 before getting deep into the Proto-Post-Punk peak of Bowie with seven tracks from the “Berlin Trilogy” of ’77-’79! With my taste in Bowie, this one was weighted very surprisingly to the modern sounds that I appreciated the most. And you were gifted with “Heroes” and “Beauty + The Beast” this time! That’s more like it! Early material got short shrift, but at the end of the day, this playlist fascinates me as it seems the work of a kindred spirit. Tracking down one of these in the northern hemisphere might prove difficult, but if I saw one <$10 it would be mine in a heartbeat. Used prices in the US range from $16-$200+ on Discogs, for what it’s worth.\n\nDavid Bowie: 1980 All Clear – USP – LP [1979]\n\nThe Man Who Sold The World\n\nSpace Oddity\n\nZiggy Stardust\n\nPanic In Detroit\n\nAlways Crashing In The Same Car\n\n1984\n\nGolden Years\n\nFascination\n\nHeroes\n\nBoys Keep Swinging\n\nThis one is actually in my Record Cell due to the thoughtful ministrations of my loved one, who keeps a sharp eye peeled for this sort of thing in her travels. Of course, The Glam Rock Nun is a Bowie fan too! It’s got crucial songs like “Space Oddity” and “Ziggy Stardust” but had lots of room for fascinating deep cuts like the electric “Panic In Detroit” or “1984.” And this was the only one with anything from “The Man Who Sold The World.” While still keeping the door open for some of the late 70s canon. A very well curated selection. I might not like this more than “Chameleon,” but I might agree that it was on objectively “better” a representation of the breadth of Bowie’s music.\n\nDavid Bowie: The Best Of Bowie – UK – LP [1980]\n\nSpace Oddity\n\nLife On Mars\n\nStarman\n\nRock ‘n’ Roll Suicide\n\nJohn, I’m Only Dancing\n\nThe Jean Genie\n\nBreaking Glass\n\nSorrow\n\nDiamond Dogs\n\nYoung Americans\n\nFame\n\nGolden Years\n\nTVC 15\n\nSound And Vision\n\nHeroes\n\nBoys Keep Swinging\n\nHere’s another one that I ran across and bought just for the sake of it! This was the only K-Tel artist compilation that might appeal to me [apart from “The Magic of ABBA®]. Aside from “Heroes,” it’s lacking most of my absolute peak favorites, but this was still a very strong selection. Possibly the strongest yet in this review.\n\nThe critical factor here, though, and to its technical detriment, was that many of these songs were edited down from their LP versions in unique edits to cram sixteen [16 HITS – 16!] Bowie tunes onto a single LP. of course, that was precisely why I bought this! Those obscure Bowie edits that appeared nowhere else were a magnet to me. The cover design, carried over from the then-current Edward Bell “Fashion” single, didn’t hurt either.\n\nDavid Bowie: Fame + Fashion – US – CD [1984]\n\nSpace Oddity\n\nChanges\n\nStarman\n\n1984\n\nYoung Americans\n\nFame\n\nGolden Years\n\nTVC 15\n\n“Heroes”\n\nD.J.\n\nFashion\n\nAshes To Ashes\n\nThis was the last Bowie compilation that drew upon the era in question here. And like some of the ones we’ve already discussed, it drew upon the then-current Bowie style for its visage. Unfortunately, this was the “Let’s Dance” era and the “Geraldine Ferraro” look of Bowie’s that I have exactly zero time for! I find it interesting that “Rebel Rebel” from “Diamond Dogs” was hard to find on any of these, yet “1984,” what I would consider a deep cut, was on half of these albums. I find that strange.\n\nTo its credit, this was the only one that had the singles from “Scary Monsters” in the running, which was a real benefit. I ran across my CD copy in the wilderness years where Bowie on the silver disc was impossibly scarce, so I was happy to have this CD. It was well-balanced, if lacking in many of my absolute favorites. But a shame about the cover. Not to mention the scabrous state of whatever masters RCA dredged up to digitize for this one! Some of these songs sound as if they were sourced from flexi-discs!\n\nThere would be many Bowie compilations to come down the pike in the next 37 years, but most of them were multi disc CD sets that allowed for much greater depth of inclusion. But there was something to be said for the succinct challenge of making a single LP that could capture all of the many facets to this artist. And the attempt to make each one of these albums was a noble attempt to count the number of angels who could dance on the head of a Bowie-shaped pin.\n\n-30-"
