        "text": "Originally posted in May 2009, updated December 2023.\n\nGrowing up in the ’70s, I discovered a number of bands, and their back-catalogues, through compilations. This is a sampling of some of those albums that had a marked influence on me.\n\n24 Golden Oldies\n\nA double album released in South Africa only in 1973. Included “Cry To Me” by The Staccatos and “For Your Precious Love” by The Flames. I discovered Frijid Pink’s psychedelic version of “House Of The Rising Sun” because of this album.\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Hot Rocks\n\nThe South African version had a different track listing to the US release. Included ‘Little Red Rooster’ and ‘Under The Boardwalk’ for example, and omitted ‘Brown Sugar’ and ‘Wild Horses’.\n\nRead more >\n\nThe Beatles – The Red And The Blue Albums\n\nTwo double albums, with every song a masterpiece. When these were re-released on CD in 1993, I bought them the day they came out. And though the whole of the Red Album could have been fitted onto a single CD, I didn’t mind paying full double album price. How many double CDs have so many classic chart-topping and million-selling songs on them? Worth every cent.\n\nRemixed and expanded in November 2023.\n\nAmerican Graffiti (soundtrack)\n\nAlong with the film “Let The Good Times Roll” this was my introduction to rock ‘n roll history.\n\nThe Who – Pinball And Other Wizards 1965-1975 (South African only release)\n\nThis was a South African-only 2LP compilation released in 1975. I first heard “Tommy” in the early ’70s and had bought “The Who By Numbers” in 1975, and then this compilation introduced me to the furious madness of The Who’s pre-Tommy catalogue.\n\nIt has the same track listing as the French and German releases, “’64-’74 The Best Of The Last Ten Years“.\n\nHowever, despite the years mentioned in the titles, these compilations only actually go up to 1971, so I have added tracks up to 1975, and also opened with ‘I Can’t Explain’, their first charting single, which had been omitted for some reason… I can’t explain why.\n\nDeep Purple – Mark I & II\n\nThis compilation was the album that introduced me to the early days of Deep Purple. This collection of singles and album tracks from the Deep Purple Mark I and Mark II back-catalogue, was released in late 1973 in South Africa on the Purple Records label. It was also released around the world, but I have never seen an official CD re-issue.\n\nThis was the first album release in the world of “When A Blind Man Cries” (previously only available as the b-side of the “Never Before” single), which was a very popular track in South Africa in the ’70s and even received radio play. “Woman From Tokyo” was listed as only being 2.44 long (the single edit), but the full-length album version (5.47) was actually featured on my vinyl album.\n\nRead more >\n\nMusic Of Our Time\n\nA CBS sampler from 1971, that was sold at a bargain price. Amazing collection. Still one of my favourites.\n\nGolden Earring – Hearing Earring\n\nThis was a compilation only released in South Africa and Holland, I think, which featured the best tracks from ‘Together’ and ‘Seven Tears’.\n\nSound track recordings from the film Jimi Hendrix\n\nA compilation of various live tracks and interviews. My main introduction to the live experience that was Jimi Hendrix.\n\nRevelations\n\nTriple album collection from Glastonbury Fayre in 1971. A strange mixture of artists and genres that introduced me to bands like Mighty Baby, Pink Fairies and Grateful Dead.\n\nI bought this 3LP set in December 1975 as I was intrigued by the artist line-up; some of my favourites like Bowie, Edgar Broughton Band and Gong were featured, as well as bands I had heard of, but not heard before, like Grateful Dead, Pink Fairies, etc.\n\nThin Lizzy – The Continuing Saga Of The Ageing Orphans\n\nGreat album, that helped me discover the early years of Thin Lizzy, though I already knew Vagabonds Of The Western World, which is still one of my all-time favourite albums.\n\nThis Is The Moody Blues\n\nA double compilation album with all the songs crossfading into each other. Like Pink Floyd’s Echoes collection many years later.\n\nSuck It And See!\n\nDouble album sampler from Vertigo. From Folk (Magna Carta) to Metal (Black Sabbath) and most places in-between. The South African pressing had a different track listing to the overseas version. This was the only place to find Jade Warrior’s “Mwenga Sketch” for many years.\n\nHonourary mention\n\nLet The Good Times Roll (soundtrack)\n\nNot really a compilation but the soundtrack to a film of a live rock and roll revival in 1973, that I saw over and over again. Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Chubby Checker and others just blew me away. And the sampled soundbites from old TV shows, backstage comments and DJ introductions made it even better."
