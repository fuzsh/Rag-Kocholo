        "text": "Sales of the latest NOW That’s What I Call Music are being hailed as the latest sign that the compilation album is alive and well. In just one straw in the wind, the current release has just become the fastest selling album of 2016 in the U.K.\n\nMusic analysts have been watching the series in the face of competition from streaming and selective singles downloads. There were initial fears that the concept would cannibalize singles sales. In order to cherry-pick though, listeners need to be aware of all the material available. Some buyers don’t listen to the radio or have much time for other services, and seem happy to get a curated collection of the biggest hits. While it may be all available on iTunes, it is also cheaper to buy all in one compilation of more than 2o tracks.\n\nWhile the latest British figures are comparatively small, they fit with a trend for the multi-platinum NOW series. These are hailed by Universal Music Group as the world’s best-selling multi-artist albums, with sales topping 250 million worldwide, including more than 97 million in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe British numbering system of the titles differs from those in the U.S., with the latest in Britain being NOW That’s What I Call Music! 93. This album shifted 247,000 copies this last week, according to the Official Charts Company. That exceeded the previous best for this year, held by David Bowie’s Blackstar, which sold 146,000 copies in its opening week after the star’s untimely death in January.\n\nSignificantly, sales for NOW 93 have outperformed the last two in the series. NOW 92 sold 211,000 units in its first week last year, with NOW 91 shifting 224,000 over its first seven days. However, 264,000 people bought NOW 90 in its debut week.\n\nThe series started in the U.K. and Ireland in the early 1980s, going on the international success and arriving in the U.S. in 1998. All of the volumes have reached Billboard’s Top 10 and some 19 volumes have reached the top. The series has generated features such as its “What’s Next ” extras of artists to watch and titles such as NOW That’s What I Call Power Ballads Hits! Along the way there have been titles dedicated to rock, dance, country, decades, British artists, Christmas, Disney tracks, and many more."
