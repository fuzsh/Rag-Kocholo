A compilation containing Toploader, Feeder, Stereo-bloody-phonics and Oasis.\n\nI can barely contain my excitement.\n\nBut wait! What’s this?\n\nThe Beta Band? The Super Furry Animals?\n\nDaft Punk? Radiohead?\n\nThe Chemical Brothers (dodgy late period, but hey!)…\n\n….\n\nIt couldn’t be a…\n\nno, it’s not possible, it could be a….a..good compilation?…\n\n…\n\nOh wait, Starsailor.\n\nBugger.\n\nThe Album Vol.3\n\n(March 25, 2002)\n\nNumber of Discs:2\n\nLabel: Virgin TV\n\nASIN: B0000647L4\n\nCatalogue Number: VTDCD441\n\nDisc: 1\n\n1.

Breathe - Telepopmusik\n\nNow, I realise it’s Virgin compilation department to include an oasis track at every possible opportunity, but couldn’t they have skipped the Hindu Times, I mean, everyone else did. Boom boom.\n\n<Sigh>\n\nWell, well, Starsailor, we meet again, and Stereophonics, great, fantastic, missed you.\n\nNo, really.\n\nBut, it’s got to be said that, while these aren’t anywhere near as appalling as they could be, (there’s a nice mix of dance and indie (Xpress 2, Timo Maas, Daft Punk), there’s a few smaller acts (Electric Soft Parade, Vex Red)) , it’s all just very ‘worthy’.\n\nBy now, it seems obvious this series isn’t doing the same job Indie Top 20 compilations did, there’s nothing small around, no John Peel bothering artists, nothing for you to discover…it’s all so..so…alright, so Mum And Dad thinking it’s ‘a nice tune’, so top 40.\n\nAnd where’s the rage? The punky angst.\n\nNot in anything Zero 7 did, anyway.\n\n‘Silent Sigh’ is about right.\n\nThe Album Vol.4\n\n(September 2, 2002)\n\nNumber of Discs:2\n\nLabel: Virgin TV\n\nASIN: B00006GF8G\n\nCatalogue Number: VTDCD481\n\n1.

The Bees - Wash In The Rain\n\n20. 41 Client - Pornography\n\nModern times, a 3 year gap and a lots changed, or so you’d think ,but really it’s an improvement rather than a total overhaul.. Ok, we’re not still firmly in the valley of the dulls, but nonetheless, this odd mixture has some boring stuff laced in amongst the better.\n\nAdd Athlete to our dull but worthy foes, but hats off for including the Bees, Engineers, Bloc Party, Willy Mason and so on….certainly a better class of track.\n\nREMs track is an odd choice, that track is ancient!\n\nNice compilation though…for new indie people or grungers, or whatever the daft title is this days.\n\nTa!"
