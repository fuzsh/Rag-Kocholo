        "text": "2022-01-06 01:14:14\n\nHello, I ripped an audio CD to FLAC which contains 80s music but it is a combination of Pop, Rock, Hip Hop, etc... songs with various artists.\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/1021345-Various-Summer-87\n\nI have more CDs like that I would like to transfer to my computer.\n\nThese are the metadata fields I use:\n\nCode: [Select]\n\nThese fields change for each track:\n\nTITLE=Name of Track\n\nARTIST=Name of Artist\n\nThese fields stay the same for all tracks:\n\nALBUMARTIST=Various Artists\n\nGENRE=?\n\nDo you use something like Various for the GENRE when you deal with compilation albums? I'm aware of the fact that FLAC supports multiple GENRE tags but I would like to limit it to just one for the sake of simplicity.\n\nRe: What genre you assign to compilation CDs with various artists?\n\nReply #1 – 2022-01-06 02:10:07\n\nI don't pay much attention to the genre, and fill in the field with entries that apply to most tracks. I might use general \"Pop\" on a compilation of chart-toppers, or maybe \"Pop; Pop Rock\" if half or more of them are powerful music. A lot of rock is a type of pop music. Classic party hip-hop is kinda popular too, unlike gangster hip hop. Sometimes the genre varies within an album, and I don't know enough about the categories to assign them to every track, and it would take too much time.\n\nRe: What genre you assign to compilation CDs with various artists?\n\nReply #2 – 2022-01-06 09:21:10\n\nI would use '80s' tag in the genre.\n\nEZ CD Audio Converter\n\nRe: What genre you assign to compilation CDs with various artists?\n\nReply #3 – 2022-01-08 15:11:37\n\nEach track has its own metadata so the genre can be different but I don't know think the online databases support that so you might have to edit manually after ripping, It's the same with the release year... I like to update each track with the original year.\n\nRe: What genre you assign to compilation CDs with various artists?\n\nReply #4 – 2022-01-08 16:03:38\n\nMy pragmatic solution, as it should scale to hundreds of compilations, best-of albums with featuring artists, etc.. is this: one genre per album, where\n\nin the case there is dominant one, I pick that.\n\nfor truly genre-spanning discs, I have\n\n\"Charts\" (mostly \"That's What I Call Music\" and similar long-running series) as a specific catch-all and\n\n\"Mix\" for varied, but not necessarily charts-oriented compilations.\n\n[/2ct]\n\nRe: What genre you assign to compilation CDs with various artists?\n\nReply #5 – 2022-01-18 10:08:41\n\nI'd say GENRE is down to each individual track, not down to the album.\n\nSometimes the same artist might put tracks of different genres on the same album, too. I don't think it's wise to peg genres to the medium.\n\nMy view on this is: Even though tracks come on an album, to me it makes more sense to see the album as a feature of the track:\n\nThe track name, release date, GTIN, EAN, etc. are all things I consider items bound to the track, rather to the album as an entity.\n\nThis seems to work well with a more modern approach to music, i.e. where individual tracks can be bought without the album, and also distributed unbound to the album.\n\nRe: What genre you assign to compilation CDs with various artists?\n\nReply #6 – 2022-01-19 10:12:58\n\nI'd use 'Pop'. Also, isn't 'Various Artists' a little redundant in the ALBUMARTIST field? Just use 'Various'."
