        "text": "We are less than two weeks away from a landmark moment in the history of popular music, when the most trusted curators of pop music for over 35 years, NOW That’s What I Call Music, release NOW100 on 20 July.\n\nCelebrating 100 albums featuring over 2000 artists and sales of over 120 million, this iconic moment in pop history will have fans across the nation celebrating nearly four decades of the world’s biggest music brand mapping the soundtrack to their lives.\n\nHaving woven its way into the hearts of the British public back in 1983 - when there were 4 TV channels and no mobile phones - the treasured compilation albums have become part of the country’s history and ingrained in its popular culture, with sales equivalent to every UK household owning 4 NOW albums.\n\nThe musical institution has since found global success in over 60 countries including the USA, South Korea and New Zealand.\n\nTo acknowledge this monumental occasion, NOW That’s What I Call Music! 100 will feature two discs; the first celebrating the biggest pop tunes of the moment including Calvin Harris & Dua Lipa, George Ezra and Clean Bandit and the second a NOWstalgia-filled special, remembering the best of the past 99 albums, with classic tracks from UB40, Phil Collins, Oasis, Spice Girls and Destiny’s Child.\n\nAlso on disc 1, there is an extra special track from the winners of GMB’s “Sing It To Win It”, girl-band MU4 with “You Can’t Hurry Love” by the Supremes, recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Recording Studios.\n\nPhil Collin’s cover version of this classic is the opening track for the very first NOW album. NOW1 will be re-issued on CD, cassette and vinyl to celebrate this momentous occasion and reflect how NOW has evolved over 35 years.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough the NOW Music App will be the only place you can download and listen to all 100 NOW albums.\n\nOver the years the NOW albums have mapped the supersonic careers of the biggest names in pop music, with Robbie Williams holding the record for most appearances, featuring a whopping thirty times with Take That chart-toppers such as Pray and It Only Takes A Minute, and solo hits Angels, Millennium and ROCK DJ. Bajan songstress Rihanna places second, with twenty-seven NOW appearances and Calvin Harris takes third place, featuring twenty-six times.\n\nWhilst NOW has been the backdrop for the most iconic music moments for the past 35 years, its rise has been so stratospheric that it is now part of history, firmly woven into the UK’s pop cultural fabric. Whether it’s Cabbage Patch Dolls in 1983, Tamagotchis in 1996 or the final episode of Friends in 2004, the brand sparks NOWstalgia in everyone, as memories and music intertwine and transport people to the most memorable moments in their lives.\n\n25 NOW Facts to whet your appetite:\n\n1.
