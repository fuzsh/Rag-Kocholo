        "text": "Compilation albums had been in the UK charts since 1956, when the Carousel original soundtrack was #1 for a total of six weeks out of 38 between 1956 and 1961. Decca even had two EPs, All Star Hit Parade (1956) and All Star Hit Parade No 2 (1957) in the singles chart.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1972 there were many releases on labels such as Pye, HMV, Parlophone, Philips, Decca, Tamla Motown, Atlantic, Polydor, Stax, CBS, Island, Music for Pleasure, Marble Arch, EMI, Hallmark and Trojan.\n\nHowever, in 1972, something big happened. Three major players emerged that would have the power of advertising on their side: K-Tel, Ronco and Arcade Records. They blazed the way for other labels to produce commercially successful albums containing current hits by various artists, bringing them all together and negating the need to by the albums the singles had spawned from.\n\nHere, in order of how they entered the UK charts are the very first successful albums credited to Various Artists that used the power of advertising.\n\nK-Tel\n\nAs Advertised on TV\n\nCanadian Philip Kives was a demonstration salesman, selling cookware door-to-door. Using his own money he formed his own company, K-Tel (“K” for Kives) and created a new type of television commercial, originally marketing a Teflon-coated frying pan. In a deal with a department store and a local TV station, he continued to produce commercials. Kives bought and marketed a range of products from Seymour Popeil, father of Ronco founder Ron Popeil. In 1965, he began successfully selling knives in Australia, and later sourced his own products.\n\nIn 1966, Kives marketed his company’s first compilation album, 25 Great Country Artists Singing Their Original Hits on the Artistic label, which sold out. This was soon followed by 25 Polka Greats, the first album to bear the K-Tel name.\n\nK-Tel was officially incorporated in 1968 and expanded throughout the 1970s. His cousin Raymond ran the US division from 1967 to 1977, and then he was in charge of the European wing between 1977 and 1984.\n\nIn Australia, K-Tel owned Majestic Records who had been releasing compilation albums since the mid-1960s. It was run by Peter Reedman and Kives recruited his twin brother Don to set up a UK division of K-Tel Records in the early 1970s. Using the tagline “20 ORIGINAL STARS – 20 ORIGINAL HITS”, Reedman’s first project was 20 Dynamic Hits, released in 1972.\n\n20 Dynamic Hits (K-Tel, TE 292, 1972)\n\n20 Dynamic Hits featured British artists like rockers Deep Purple (who got two tracks on the album) and Liverpudlian songstress Cilla Black alongside American funk band Sly & the Family Stone and Mexican guitarist Carlos Santana.\n\nIt contained no UK No 1s and one hit wonders Danyel Gerard, Ronnie Dyson, Redbone, The Congregation, and Blood, Sweat & Tears. Don Reedman was not afraid to include releases that were outside the UK Top 50, or even did not chart.\n\nIn a 2005 article published in the Independent, “K-Tel: the secret history!”, Bob Stanley spoke to founder Philip Kives about the success of K-Tel, and remarked that his father bought the album, along with three million other people. The cover looked like it had been put together by a kid with Letraset and felt tips.\n\nThe album broke into the UK albums chart on June 4, 1972, at #4. The following week it began its eight week run at #1. In all, the album was in the chart for 28 weeks.\n\nArcade Records\n\nAs Advertised on TV\n\nWhile 20 Dynamic Hits was enjoying its seventh week at the top, a new player in budget compilation albums entered the arena: Arcade Records. Entering at #4, just as 20 Dynamic Hits had done, was 20 Fantastic Hits By the Original Artists.\n\nArcade Records was a British record company specialising in mid/budget price multi-artist compilation albums founded in 1972. Founder Laurence Myers had been managing and producing for British artists such as David Bowie and the Rolling Stones. He realised that music consumers were home taping their favourite songs, creating mixtapes. He decided to copy this trend by releasing multi-artist and one-artist compilation albums.\n\nWhile other budget labels like Hallmark and Music for Pleasure had been relatively successful, they often contained versions of hits by soundalikes. Myers decided to only pick original artists and songs for his albums.\n\nLike K-Tel, Arcade relied heavily on TV and radio advertising.\n\n20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists (Arcade, 2891 001, 1972)\n\nArcade’s first release was 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists and featured British artists like Rod Stewart, Slade, The New Seekers, and Daniel Boone, alongside international acts such as The Osmonds, Melanie (who gets two tracks on the album), and the Bee Gees.\n\nAlso included were one hit wonders The Mixtures and The Piglets. Donny Osmond appears twice: with his No 1 hit “Puppy Love”, and alongside his brothers with a song that did not chart. Daniel Boone gets two mentions, as he co-wrote the last track, performed by the Chelsea Football Team.\n\n20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists entered the UK albums chart at #4 on July 29, 1972 and then on August 6, 1972 replaced K-Tel’s 20 Dynamic Hits at the top, where it stayed for five weeks. It then dropped to #2 for two weeks while Rod Stewart was #1 with Never a Dull Moment but returned for one more week. 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists spent a total of 24 weeks in the chart.\n\n20 All Time Greats of the 50s (K-Tel, NE 490, 1972)\n\nKnocking 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists was the next release from K-Tel, 20 All Time Greats of the 50s. It went straight into the chart at #1 on October 7, 1972 and promptly stayed there for eight weeks. It would return for three further weeks on December 17, 1972.\n\nThe album contained tracks that might have been popular on British radio but most did not make it into the UK singles chart. Therefore, the selection was probably based upon their success in the US. However, the album did contain two UK #1s, one each from from Guy Mitchell and Doris Day.\n\nRonco\n\nAs seen on TV\n\nRonco was founded in the US by American inventor Ron Popeil in 1964. Initially, the company sold gadgets developed by Ron’s father, Samuel. During the 1970s, Ron began developing his own products.\n\nWhen, in 1966, rival company K-Tel released its first compilation album, 25 Great Country Artists Singing Their Original Hits, selling every copy, Popeil was inspired to set up his own label. Ronco’s first album was Do It Now – 20 Giant Hits, released in 1970. In the United Kingdom their first release was 20 Star Tracks Vol 1, in 1972, which went to #2 in the UK albums chart. The following year they released the That’ll Be the Day soundtrack album, which was their first of three #1 albums in the UK.\n\nAfter the emergence of the Now That’s What I Call Music! range, Ronco disappeared from the UK market in 1984 after its parent company went bankrupt.\n\n20 Star Tracks Vol 1 (Ronco, PP 2001, 1972)\n\nMaking its debut at #3 on October 21, 1972 was Ronco’s first release Star Tracks Vol 1. It would peak at #2 for two weeks and spend just 13 weeks on the chart. The album cover was arguably similar to that of K-Tel’s 20 Dynamic Hits.\n\nThe album featured British artists like Cat Stevens, Mott the Hoople, Mungo Jerry, and the Sweet alongside Canadian singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie, American Scott English, and English-Australian singer Olivia Newton-John. Also included was Laurie Styvers, who never had any hits in the UK, and songs for acts popular in the UK that did not chart.\n\nThere 13 UK Top 20 hits including two 1s: “Amazing Grace” from The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and “In the Summertime” by Mungo Jerry.\n\nDespite the title claiming this to be volume one, there was no volume two to follow.\n\n22 Dynamic Hits Vol II (K-Tel, TE 291, 1972)\n\nK-Tel’s oddly titled sequel to 20 Dynamic Hits, 22 Dynamic Hits Vol II, followed its predecessor by also entering the UK chart at #4. It began its chart run of 12 weeks on November 25, 1972 and it peaked at #2 for two weeks at the very end of the year, held off the top spot by 20 All time Greats of the 50s.\n\nWhereas 20 Dynamic Hits contained no UK No 1s, 22 Dynamic Hits Vol. II had three, from Chicory Tip (named on the album sleeve as Chickory Tip), Joe Cocker, and T Rex. As on the previous release, this one contained a few singles that did not chart. In 1972, the UK chart comprised of the Top 50 and one of the tracks, “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass had made it as far as #51.\n\n20 FAntastic Hits by the Original Artists Volume Two (Arcade, 2891 002, 1972)\n\nHot on K-Tel’s 22 Dynamic Hits Vol II, was Arcade;s 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists Volume Two, entering the same charts at exactly the same time but at #5. It would spend 13 weeks in the chart and also peak at #2.\n\nMaking a return were the New Seekers, Dawn, the Bee Gees, Donny Osmond, Melanie, and Slade. They were joined by the likes of T Rex, Derek & the Dominoes, Bay City Rollers, Sammy Davis Jr and Mary Hopkin. The album featured five No 1 hits, two one-hit wonders in Mardi Gras, and Frederick Knight, one song that did not chart and a b-side to a top selling single.\n\nIt was in the company of three K-Tel albums in the Top 5: 25 Rockin’ and Rollin’ Greats at #1, 20 All Time Greats of the 50s (#3) and 22 Dynamic Hits Vol II (#4).\n\nTamla Motown\n\nIn 1959, Berry Gordy Jr founded Tamla Records, which was incorporated as Motown Record Corporation the following year. From 1965 the label Tamla Motown was used outside the US. Previously, Motown records were released in the UK on London American Records (1960-1961), Fontana Records (1961-1962), Oriole American Records (1962-1963) and Stateside Records (1963-1965).\n\nIn 1967, Tamla Motown released British Motown Chartbusters, which went to #2. The following year, British Chartbusters Vol 2 went to #8. From 1969, the title was shortened to Motown Chartbusters. Volumes 3, 4 and 5 were all #1s but Volume 6 was a #2.\n\nMotown Chartbusters Vol 7\n\nCharted at #44 on November 25, 1972 and spent a total of 16 weeks in the Top 50, peaking at #9.\n\n25 Rockin’ & Rollin’ Greats (K-Tel, NE 493, 1972)\n\nThe following week, K-Tel unleashed another album, going straight in at #1 and staying there for three weeks. 25 Rockin’ & Rollin’ Greats would be in the chart for 18 weeks.\n\nThe album contained 17 Top 20 hits including five #1s from Bill Haley & his Comets, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, the Dave Clark Five, Lonnie Donegan, and Roy Orbison. The Surfaris and Bobby Day were one-hit wonders, three tracks did not chart in the UK, including one from Ronnie Hawkins who never had a UK hit.\n\n20 Flash Back Greats of the Sixties (K-Tel, NE 494, 1973)\n\nOn March 25, 1973, K-Tel had another album go straight in at #1, and it was there for just two weeks at the start of its 11 week run in the chart.\n\n16 of the tracks on 20 Flash Back Greats of the Sixties had been Top 20 hits, including five #1s from the Kinks, the Searchers, Gary Puckett & the Union Gap, Scott McKenzie, and the Byrds. Three tracks did not chart, one of which was from Joanie Sommers who never had a UK hit single.\n\n40 Fantastic Hits from the 50s and 60s (Arcade, ADE P3-4, 1973)\n\nArcade returned to the charts on April 7, 1973 with 40 Fantastic Hits from the 50s and 60s, debuting at #2 but not doing any better than that during its 15 week run.\n\nThis was the first 2-LP set from the “As Seen on TV” labels to chart. 34 tracks had achieved Top 10 in the singles chart, and the selection included 12 #1s. Neil Sedaka had two songs on this album, both had peaked at #3. Just one song, from Frankie Laine did not chart.\n\nBelieve in Music (K-Tel, TE 294, 1973)\n\nK-Tel’s Believe in Music entered the chart at #31 on April 21, 1973 and then peaked at #2 for the next fortnight before leaving the chart after just eight weeks.\n\n20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists Volume Three (arcade, ADE P5, 1973)\n\n20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists Volume Three entered the chart at #4 on May 26, 1973. The following two weeks saw it peak at #3. Therefore, Volume One reached #1, Volume Two peaked at #2 and Volume Three got to #3. Spooky, huh? It stayed on chart for just eight weeks.\n\nEMI Records Ltd\n\nElectric and Musical Industries Ltd, was formed in 1931 by the merger of the Columbia Gramophone Company (including Parlophone) and the Gramophone Company (“His Master’s Voice”). That same year, the company’s legendary Abbey Road studios were opened.\n\nEMI released its first LPs in 1952, which were released on a variety of subsidiary labels such as Parlophone, HMV, Columbia and Capitol Records. With so many stellar artists like the Cliff Richard, the Beach Boys, Nat ‘King’ Cole, the Beatles, and Frank Sinatra, they became the best-known and most successful recording company at the time.\n\nIn 1967, Columbia and Parlophone took care of rock and pop music, and HMV became solely involved in the release of classical music. Two years later, Harvest Records took on the emerging progressive rock genre including Pink Floyd.\n\nElectric and Musical Industries Ltd became EMI Ltd in 1971. EMI Records Ltd was a British record label founded in 1972, and launched in 1973 as the successor to Columbia and Parlophone. They signed new musical acts that became global successes: Kraftwerk, Queen, Olivia Newton-John, Iron Maiden, Kate Bush, Sheena Easton, Pink Floyd, for example.\n\nIn 1979, EMI acquired United Artists Records, and merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to form Thorn EMI who, in 1991, took over Chrysalis Records and Virgin Records.\n\nIn the 2000s, EMI were involved in a number of lawsuits with artists and other record labels, leading to losses and being acquired by Universal Music Group (recorded music) and Sony/ATV Music (music publishing).\n\nPure Gold On EMI (EMI, EMK 251, 1973)\n\nPure Gold on EMI entered the UK chart at #2 on June 2, 1973. For the following three weeks, it was #1, and remained in the chart for a total of 11 weeks.\n\nPhilips Records\n\nAs Advertised on TV\n\nPhilips is a Dutch conglomerate, founded in 1891, and one of the largest electronics companies in the world. In 1950 it formed Philips Records, which eventually formed part of PolyGram. Philips introduced the Compact Audio Cassette in 1963, initially for dictation machines. As their sound quality improved, they became used to record sound and became popular alongside vinyl records for selling recorded music.\n\nIn 1953, Philips released singles by the likes of Flanagan & Allen, Gracie Fields, Frankie Laine, and Johnnie Ray. In 1958, they created a subsidiary, Fontana Records and, in 1962, CBS Records. In the 1960s and 1970s, Philips became a major label in rock and pop, signing acts such as Marty Wilde, Roy Castle, and Dusty Springfield. They also released albums by Lena Zavaroni, Peters & Lee, and Nana Mouskouri, and issuing novelty records by personalities such as Ed Stewart and Bruce Forsyth.\n\nIn 1970, Philps and Fontana merged with Mercury Records and Vertigo Records, forming Phonogram. By 1980, Phonogram, Mercury Records, RSO Records, Casablanca and Polydor Records became PolyGram Records.\n\n20 Original Chart Hits (Philips, TV1, 1972)\n\nOn June 2, 1973, 20 Original Chart Hits entered the UK chart at #32. During its 11 week run, the best it achieved was #9.\n\nThat’ll Be the Day (Ronco, TBC, 1973)\n\nRonco released That’ll Be the Day as the official soundtrack to the 1973 film of the same name starring David Essex and Ringo Starr. It entered the chart at #2 on June 23, 1973 and then was #1 for the next seven weeks, completely disappearing after that.\n\nMotown Chartbusters Volume 8\n\nSpending its first three weeks from November 3, 1973 on the chart at #9, this album spent a total of 15 weeks in the Top 50.\n\nBBC Records\n\nBBC Records was founded in 1967 to exploit the corporation’s output of radio and television for educational and domestic use. The division was known as BBC Radio Enterprises (1967–1970), BBC Records (1970–1972) and BBC Records & Tapes (1972–1989).\n\nMusic for a Royal Wedding\n\nEntered chart at #14 on December 8, 1973.
