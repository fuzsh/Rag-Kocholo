        "text": "by Soldier777 Fri Mar 29, 2019 1:22 am\n\nWhat are some of your thoughts of unreleased/new songs on compilation/rerecord albums for those of you who collect these albums? Do you think they are as good as material from the original albums or do they have the feel of being left over tracks not good enough to be on a previous album? These songs aren't talked about enough probably where some consider compilation albums are an unnecessary part of a band's back catalogue to fulfill the record contract unless there are more than 2 unreleased material or the older songs are rerecords. When one thinks of a favorite track from a band these songs are often not though of.\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby Guest Fri Mar 29, 2019 3:38 am\n\nI love new tracks / versions being put onto compilations, soundtracks, and GH releases. Some of them are among my favorite tracks by the artist.\n\nFor Christian:\n\nStryper has quite a few that I consider must haves..\n\nFrom their re-recording album Second Coming\n\nTwo new songs on this album, and both are among my favorite Stryper tunes.\n\nBlackened and Bleeding From The Inside Out\n\nFrom their covers album The Covering\n\nOne new song, also among my favorite Stryper tunes.\n\nGod\n\nFrom 7 The Best of Stryper\n\nTwo new tracks, Something, which I really like...and For You which is also a really good song.\n\nFrom Can't Stop The Rock\n\nAlso two new tracks, Believe and Can't Stop The Rock. Both good songs.\n\nAlso, the Regency Records comps from the 80's have tons of tracks that were never released and are not available anywhere else, plus alternate versions of songs that were released later.\n\nFor Secular:\n\nAC/DC has some songs that were released as new tracks on compilations that are must have Ac/Dc songs.\n\nWho Made Who from the Maximum Overdrive soundtrack\n\nBig Gun from Last Action Hero soundtrack\n\nOne of my favorite Greatest Hits compilations of all time is Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits by KISS because of the new tracks / versions that are on it.\n\nLet's Put The X In Sex\n\nYou Make Me Rock Hard\n\nBeth with Eric Carr on vocals\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby eatbugs Fri Mar 29, 2019 11:35 am\n\nSometimes they are just as good. Sometimes not. The reason most of us don't mention them as favorite songs is that best-of's are overlooked when we think of a band's catalog.\n\nI don't know about the \"filling a record contract\" thing. I have always assumed it was done by record companies to weasel extra money from completist fans who want every song but wouldn't normally spend money on a compilation. The modern version of this are all of the reissues with different sets of bonus tracks or bands that put out deluxe editions of albums a year later with extra songs I won't hear because I got the original (glaring at you, Disciple).\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby Follower of Jesus Sat Mar 30, 2019 8:21 am\n\nBride’s “Everybody Knows My Name” and “Same Ol’ Sinner” from their End of the Age compilation are awesome.\n\nTamplin’s “When Secrets Cry Out Loud” and “Little Liar” from the Shout/Tamplin compilation are also great songs.\n\nOn the secular side, Primal Fear covered Heart’s “If Looks Could Kill” on their latest greatest hits compilation, and it’s a top 10 PF song.\n\nSo, yeah, I really like this practice.\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby Black Rider Sat Mar 30, 2019 11:48 am\n\nThose Bride songs are what came to mind too.\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby eatbugs Sat Mar 30, 2019 2:30 pm\n\nBlack Rider wrote:Those Bride songs are what came to mind too.\n\nMe too except that the Everybody Knows My Name from Kinetic Faith is better.\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby bodachi Sat Mar 30, 2019 2:54 pm\n\n^Nope, the original \"Everybody Knows My Name\" is the better version\n\nTourniquet: \"Trivializing the Momentous, Complicating the Obvious\" from the Acoustic Archives is one of my all-time favorite Tourniquet songs! Incredible song\n\nAnd from the Collected Works both bonus tracks are amazing\n\nAltar Boys had a long-lost song on the GLM remaster that's also pretty sweet\n\nTheocracy's \"Wages of Sin\" is killer\n\nHonorable mention to the Steve Taylor \"+3 That Never Escaped\" from his \"The Best We Could Find\"\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby Soldier777 Sat Mar 30, 2019 3:36 pm\n\nBought4Life and Follower of Jesus, I was thinking of those same Stryper and Shout/Tamplin albums when I created this thread.\n\nSome other compilations I have in my collection:\n\nKen Tamplin - Liquid Music Compilation - Something Sacred and Lord Have Mercy\n\nDeliverance -A Decade Of - Rescue (this song is on the 2008 version of Weapons of Our Warefare album\n\nWhitecross - To the Limit - It's My Life and You're My Lord\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby Follower of Jesus Sat Mar 30, 2019 3:59 pm\n\nI forgot about the Deliverance and Whitecross albums. I love Rescue! Also, You’re My Lord is one of my favorite Whitecross songs.\n\nEven more evidence that this is a great practice!\n\nRe: Unreleased/New Songs on Compilation Albums...\n\nby eatbugs Sun Mar 31, 2019 2:23 am\n\nbodachi wrote:^Nope, the original \"Everybody Knows My Name\" is the better version\n\nTourniquet: \"Trivializing the Momentous, Complicating the Obvious\" from the Acoustic Archives is one of my all-time favorite Tourniquet songs!
