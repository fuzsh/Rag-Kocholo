Only for those albums where there are multiple artists is Compilations useful, in my opinion.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Chris CA\n\nUser level: Level 10\n\n82,440 points\n\nOn songs with a \"Featured/Guest\" artist and it is a \"normal\" album, I move the guest artist name to the song title and uncheck the album as a compilation.\n\n\"Smooth\" - Santana featuring Rob Thomas\n\nbecomes\n\n\"Smooth featuring Rob Thomas\" - Santana\n\nThis way the artist shows up as only Santana.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: varjak paw\n\nUser level: Level 10\n\n170,218 points\n\nUse of the \"Album Artist\" field can also help in situations where there are multiple artists.
