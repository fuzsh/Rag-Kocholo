        "text": "Post by George Tropicana on\n\nYou may remember Aselin Debison, the young girl with the big voice, who released her stunning debut album \"Sweet Is The Melody\" in September 2002.\n\nNow she's 14 and she's back with a singer-songwriter sound. Check out \"Life\" and its video at www.aselin.com\n\nIt looks like one of the videos Sean (computerfreak) would like! She looks like JoJo now too!\n\n\"Life\" sounds nice enough of a rock/pop song.. but what happened to that \"special voice\" which captured my attention back in 2002?\n\n--\n\nWatch the video: www.sonymusic.ca/cgi-bin/Canada/stream.cgi?file=Canada/AselinDebison/Life_hi.wmv\n\nEDIT: On second listen, I really like it. The video, mature lyrics, and melody fit together so well. No disrespect to JoJo, Raven, and Hilary Duff, but I would really be happy to see a positive image like Aselin shown on music video channels. This is what many young adults go through, trying to discover who they are and learn what \"life\" is about.\n\nPost by George Tropicana on\n\nJanuary 18, 2005\n\nGet On Aselin's Mailing List And Score Tix To A Private Show!\n\nHave you made sure you're on Aselin Debison's official mailing list?
