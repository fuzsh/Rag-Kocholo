        "text": "Dedication + Determination + Desire = Success\n\nBy being selected, each team member agrees to give 100% all of the time. Each team member also agrees to try their best to get along with each other, despite any past conflicts or outside influences. Negative/discouraging/rude or other such remarks will NOT be tolerated by athletes or PARENTS. Conflict should be addressed in a mature manner and if needed, the coaches should be notified immediately and PRIVATELY. If an athlete or parent displays a continual bad attitude, it is grounds for IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL.\n\nBeing on All-Stars does not mean you are an All-Star tumbler or you have the best jumps or you are the greatest flyer. Keep in mind we all have our strengths and weaknesses. You must have an ALL-STAR ATTITUDE. Respect yourself, your coaches, and each other. WE ARE A TEAM!\n\nPractice/Class\n\nPractice is Mandatory. The importance of attendance cannot be stressed enough. Disciplinary action will be taken if attendance becomes a problem. If a child misses the last practice prior to a competition, the decision of their ability to compete will be based on the coaches’ discretion. This decision will be based on past attendance, overall attitude, and the amount of changes made to a routine. If an athlete has to sit out a competition, they are STILL REQUIRED to attend the competition in full uniform and hair to show support for their team as well as be financially responsible! EXAMPLE: Concussed athletes may be excused from competition.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\n1) Attendance is mandatory to all competitions, practices, and performances unless medically excused.\n\n2) Each child is allowed 6 excused absences from practices for the season. After the 6 absence...the monthly fee will be increased by $30/month for any missed practices for the remainder of the season! We don’t want your $ as much as we want the athletes!\n\n3) If an absence is going to occur, a 2-week notice MUST be given or replacements may occur.\n\n4) Excused absences from practice only are as follows:\n\na) Death in the family\n\nb) Illness\n\nc) School/Academic meeting that could affect the grade ONLY\n\nd) Family member in the hospital (i.e. brother, sister, mother, father, stepmother, stepfather, grandmother, grandfather)\n\ne) Family vacation\n\nf) Activity or athletic function that the athlete themselves are a part of.\n\n5) Unexcused absences for practices are as follows:\n\na) Birthday\n\nb) Birthday party\n\nc) Anything else the coaches see fit (i.e. excessive missing for other activities)\n\nd) School and or Sporting Events\n\n6) There are no excused absences from performances and competitions unless excused by a coach prior to the season. If a performance or competition is missed for any other reason the child may be dismissed from the team.\n\nFCE Compromise\n\nSummer classes are the most important time for the athletes and teams. This is the time in which bonding throughout the team occurs therefore, summer practices are mandatory. We do understand that many families do utilize this time for vacationing. It is required that a 2 week notice for vacation be submitted.\n\nFor those athletes who will be cheering for a school team or are members of another sport team, congratulations on making the squad! We will try to be understanding of time conflicts BUT the attendance policy will be in effect and Findlay Elite MUST be your #1 priority NO EXCEPTIONS! To make it easier on all of us, it is required that a schedule of school games, functions and practices be submitted immediately. ** There is no “down time” for our full year cheer season. PRACTICES are just as important as competitions because routines are constantly changing throughout the season! PLEASE do not try out if you plan on making another team a priority.\n\nFundraisers\n\nFundraising will be done as a group. Any monies accumulated will be placed in each individual’s escrow account. Only that individual will reap the benefits from the money earned. This money can be used for the following: competitions, choreography and uniform fees. If for any reason an athlete is no longer on the team, any remaining balance will be forfeited. Money left over in your escrow account will NOT rollover from year to year.\n\nUniforms\n\nUniform prices will be approx. $300. Warm ups will be ordered at a later time. Many of you have these already. They’re approx. $100 and will be ordered prior to the competition season. We’re going to have a team practice uniform this season. This is so that we have a uniform for the fair competitions and for any exhibitions or community service that we may do.\n\n**NEW** If we have a tiny or level 1 mini team…. we will look into the idea of a more cost effective uniform!\n\nCHOREOGRAPHY/MUSIC\n\nChoreography Camp & music fee will be decided upon and according to each team. The senior & junior squads will have professional choreography! The fee will be determined according to flights, hotels, food, and rental car. The price will range from $150 - $275.\n\n** If you miss choreography because of a conflict, you’re still RESPONSIBLE for the choreography payments & an alternate will be placed in your spot! It is you’re responsibility to learn from the alternate what you missed!\n\n** We try to pass down our routines from the older squads each year with some “TWEAKING” or music changes. Every team member will pay a minimum $125 fee for choreography. We are hoping that this will help lower the price for all team members!\n\nRole of the Parent\n\n1. Be the #1 fan of Findlay Elite.\n\n2. Let the coaches do all of the coaching and to be \"quiet spectators\" at practice.\n\n3. Contact the head coach if they have an issue that needs to be addressed, and to address that issue only with the coaching staff @ the appropriate time.\n\n4. Support coach discipline.\n\n5. Support your child 100% of the time. Our goal is to allow your athlete to be the best that he/she can be.\n\n6. Respect the role of the coaches as the ones who make the final decisions and run the program.\n\n7. Help coaches de-emphasize the role of the flyer. Many parents influence their own children to believe the flyer is the star of the show; this could not be more false. It takes a great athlete to be a base and that is nothing to be ashamed of. We couldn’t have flyers without bases!\n\n8. Be parent volunteers. Looking for SPIRIT IDEAS for comps.\n\n9. Do Not Gossip. Please do not discuss negative comments about other children or the coaches in front of your child. Remember children are sponges and a negative attitude will be reflected in your child during practice.\n\n10. We are a team & we’re asking that everyone sit together at competition (as much as possible). GOOD CONDUCT IS REQUIRED @ ALL TIMES!\n\n11. Make decisions and take action based on:\n\na. Good of the program.\n\nb. The good of the team.\n\nc. Good of their child.\n\nd. Their own personal good.\n\n12. We’re going to ask that you stay to cheer on all teams for the competitions! WE’RE GOING TO REQUIRE it during the NATIONAL COMPETITIONS! POWER in #’s and the team loves seeing our faces and hearing us CHEER along w/ them!\n\nSafety Issues/ Hurt vs. Injury\n\nA natural occurrence in any sport is injury. Cheerleading incorporates advanced pyramids that can be seven feet or higher into the air and tumbling passes that may cause strain on ankles, wrists, shins, etc. Naturally, stunts will fall, tumbling passes bust, and bumps and bruises occur. It is important that each team member realizes that they must \"stay tough\" and be able to get up and move on. A bruised arm is an example of \"hurt\". A broken arm is an example of an \"injury.\" Squad members are expected to \"get tough\" and continue through it unless they are seriously injured. All major injuries will be handled with the utmost seriousness. Coaches should be notified of any injuries or hurts that occurred outside of practice that may affect their performance during a class or practice. A doctors’ note is required if an athlete is not able to perform ALL SKILLS for more than 1 practice. A doctor’s note to return to full work out will also be required.\n\nSafety issues when it comes to stunting are of extreme importance. As a competitive cheerleading team, all members are expected to adhere to safe stunting techniques at all times. Talking, laughing, or goofing off during any kind of stunt are all prohibited. Staying focused, making appropriate corrections to skill technique and communicating with members of the stunt group is vital to the success and safety of all team members.\n\nGeneral Rules\n\n1. No gum or candy chewing.\n\n2. No abusive or vulgar language.\n\n3. No fighting.\n\n4. No body jewelry.\n\n5. Regular attendance is A MUST\n\n6. If you are injured, not on bed-rest and not contagious it is REQUIRED to come to practice and observe and condition. NO CELL PHONES FOR INJURED ATHELTES IN PRACTICE AREA!\n\n7.

This includes fees being paid on time!\n\n13. Have a positive attitude.\n\n14. Work hard and perform well.\n\n15. Respect yourself, your coaches and each other.\n\nConduct\n\n1.

If one voluntarily quits a 30-day written notice MUST still be submitted to Traci and your credit card will be charged a $500 + 4% credit card charge for our restructuring fee. All monies that are paid to FCE will be non-refundable whether the removal is voluntary or involuntary.
