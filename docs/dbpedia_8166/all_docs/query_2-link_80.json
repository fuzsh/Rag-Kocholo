        "text": "There are all kinds of wonderful obscure Christmas songs I enjoy. I could probably do a Top 40 of nothing but relatively obscure holiday recordings.\n\nSeveral I will mention that I like to hear every year:\n\n\"Christmas in the Trenches\" by John McCutcheon - the best song ever written about the 1914 Christmas Truce, which took place during World War I. For 24 hours, the Brits and Germans stopped shooting at each other and sang, played pickup soccer, exchanged pleasantries and gifts, and other peaceful activities while their superiors either looked the other way or joined in themselves. McCutcheon's version is a first-person account by a fictional (?) soldier named Francis Tolliver, who reflects years later on what it really meant. I discovered this one on the radio, of all places, by a station that used the wonderful compilation Must Be Santa! The Rounder Christmas Album in its holiday-music programming.\n\n\"The Gift\" by Aselin Debison - another version of the no-gift-fit-for-a-newborn-king story that is most familiar in \"The Little Drummer Boy,\" this is the story of a \"poor orphan girl named Maria\" who brought a bird she nursed from near-death. I won't ruin the rest of the story if you've never heard the song before, but I will say that Ms. Debison was only 12 years old when she recorded it, and what a lovely voice the girl had. I think I first heard this song on the Delilah radio show, and long after everyone else filed it away, she played it during the holiday season every year. It was released as a promo CD single in 2002, and also appears on the album Sweet Is the Melody. Interestingly, \"The Gift\" was first recorded by Garth Brooks on his Beyond the Season Christmas CD, where it was mostly overlooked.\n\n\"Hey Santa Claus\" by the Moonglows - this was the \"jump\" side of this classic R&B group's 1952 Christmas single for the Chance label of Chicago, and it rocks! The original 45 or 78 brings hundreds of dollars, but I first encountered it on the 1980s MCA compilation Rockin' Little Christmas.\n\n\"Jesus Christ\" by Big Star - from the sessions for their Third/Sister Lovers album, I first encountered this on a diverse compilation called Xmas Marks the Spot from Rykodisc in the 1990s.\n\n\"Old Toy Trains\" by Roger Miller - a 1967 single that is gorgeous. I probably heard it earlier, but it first made an indelible impression when I got the Country Christmas 3-LP set from Time-Life Music in the late 1980s or early 1990s.\n\n\"The Pretty Little Dolly\" by Mona Abboud - one of the funniest Christmas songs ever, recorded live on the Tonight Show in the 1960s but not issued on a 45 until the 1980s. The late great Bob Collins, an old-fashioned talk-show guy on WGN radio back when that station was great, played this on his show, and I could not stop laughing. Many years later, around the time I was working on the Goldmine Christmas Record Price Guide, Mona herself sent me a copy of the 45 after I said I was having a hard time finding a copy.\n\n\"Rudy\" by the Be Good Tanyas - the saga of a homeless man who happened to have the same first name as a Christmas icon. A few years ago, I asked about this song on this very forum because I heard it as part of the piped-in music at an Eddie Bauer outlet store on Black Friday, and I absolutely had to find out what it was. Someone in the store thought it might have been the Indigo Girls... This song appeared on one of those eclectic Nettwork Records Maybe This Christmas CDs and later on the A Winter's Night Nettwork best-of.\n\n\"Sweetest Dreams Be Thine\" by Theodore Bikel - another really pretty song, Bikel recorded it for an Elektra non-holiday LP called Songs of the Earth in the mid-1960s, and it also wound up on one of the best, if not the best, department-store Christmas record of all time, A Very Merry Christmas from the Grants chain in 1967. I highly recommend the entire album, which also featured the first release of \"The Star Carol\" by Simon & Garfunkel, another beautiful obscurity.\n\nThat's a very interesting list."
