        "text": "The song \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" was song by Bill Frisell in the movie FINDING FORRESTER. It was also sung in the scene from ER when Mark Green passed away. And, I am having the song played at my husband's funeral as well recognizing a celebration of the life of \"the greatest man we ever knew\" my wonderful Papa who became the unfortunate victim of Alzheimer's Disease for the past 10 years.\n\nIt's lilting melody helps all to realize that David J is still alive and well with his spirit forever with us...as my husband he is the \"pot of gold\" at the end of the rainbow and now resides peacefully in God's Kingdom.\n\nThere seems to be conflicting opinions about who actually sang this song. I believe IZ has a version very similar to the one in Finding Forrester, but on the soundtrack, a guy named Melvin Amina (never heard of him and can't find any CDs under his name) is credited with the version that rolls during the credits and Bill Frisell is listed for another instrumental version that occurs during the movie. It turns out that Melvin Amina plays guitar for the piece. Why he is listed as receiving the main credit? I am not sure, maybe he redid the song identical to IZ or something.\n\nhello everybody! i can't believe when a find this page! i was thinking what i'amthe only one who has this question! \"Who sang the version of somewhere...\" But i'am not alone! yup :P I find a page whit information of \"Israel\" Who sang this B-E-Autiful song... You can find the lyrics too.\n\nWell, i hope u like it, keep enjoying that song like me... and i fell very good when i find this page and i read all the comentaries about this song. Thank you all and be happy.\n\nhttp://www.stlyrics.com/songs/i/israelkamakawiwoole6157/somewhereovertherainbow239745.html\n\nHELLO TO ALL THAT IS READING THIS I WAS WATCHING A TALK SHOW, AND THIS WAS MANY YEARS BACK. JUDY WAS NOT THE SINGER OF THE SONG SHE HAD TO HAVE A STAND IN COME IN AND SING FOR HER. DO TO SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO SING DURING THE MOVIE. SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER VOICE THAT CAUSED HER TO LOOSE THE ABILITY TO SING SO THEY HIRED A STAND IN SINGER FOR HER. I DO NOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE STAND IN BUT I DOING MY RESEARCH ON MY VIDEOS I HAVE COLLECTED OVER THE YRS AND WHEN I FIND IT I WILL POST THE WHOLE INTERVIEW ON THE WEB SO ALL CAN SEE THAT JUDY WAS NOT THE SINGER OF THE SHOW..\n\nI can't believe all the great information right next to completely contradictory misinformation!\n\nFirst, the 50 First Dates version is Israel Kamakawiwo`ole. End of story. It's a traditional Hawaiian ukelele arrangement that is syncopated, so it sounds to non-musicians similar to reggae or \"jamaican\" music. It's Hawaiian, though.\n\nI did not see Finding Forrester, but several posters here suggest that Bill Frissell sung this song on the soundtrack. I have to ask, is this a quiet, cracking voice or is it a singer's voice? If it's the latter, I can assure you that it's not Bill Frissell. He must've played an instrumental version on the soundtrack because Bill barely [i]speaks[/i] in concert, let alone sings. He is a master instrumentalist and works with great vocalists, but he does not sing. In fact, he's quite shy when speaking between songs. I know. I've mixed sound for him. Only once, but once was enough to know.\n\nA quick Google search of \"Finding Forrester song credits\" yielded a page that lists the musicians (no vocalists) which reads like a Who's who of great instrumentalists.

So much to say.\n\nSomewhere Over the Rainbow - Music written some time between 1930 and 1935 by Harold Arlen (Feb 1905 to April 23, 1986)and lyrics by E.Y.Harburg (April 8, 1896 to March 5, 1981)and originally Sung by Judy Garland\n\n65 years ago, On Feb. 29, 1940, at the Academy Award banquet held at the \"Cocoanut Grove\", it won the Academy Award for best song. Indeed, four years ago, when the Recording Industry Association of America chose the 365 songs of the 20th century, \"Rainbow\" came in first.\n\nIn the meantime, as a guitarist, my Favorite version is of course, by Bill Frizell. I heard it first when we went to see the movie Finding Forrester. The moment I got home, I downloaded it so I cold learn to play it.\n\nIn the meantime, PLEASE, PLEASE do yourself a favor and check out the version done by the late Eva Cassidy. The CD is \"The Other Side\" by Chuck Brown and Eva Cassidy (Liaison Records cbd02263). Her web site is:http://evacassidy.org/eva/\n\nIf you listen to it, please post your opinion!\n\nIn answer to the original question about the episode of er i'm pretty sure it was Iz who did that version, it would only make sense since the scene was set in HW. in regards to Joe black, i looked at the credits and it said Iz did that version as well, however it has the what a wonderful world reprise and many people have posted that T newman did the versions with the wonderful world mixed in it, so does that mean that Newman also just copied a different version of Iz's arrangement or what? Lastly on the etoys comercial although it was arranged in the style of Iz i don't think he actually gets credit for that one, the comercial needed a longer intro so i am fairly sure it was redone by some session studio musicians, also when you listen to the voice and humming it has a higher pitch than Iz. Any thoughts?\n\non my exchange sister from france, 2nd last day here in canada. we (me, my mom and her) were coming back from somewhere in the car when this song came on the radio. we all sang it together (unusual but whatever) and i have it on video on my digital camera. shes back in france now.\n\nlast wknd my mom and i watched 50 first dates and when the song came on at the end of the song it reminded me of that moment and i missed her so much just then. my sister!\n\nwell thats my story...i love that song.\n\nSorry, no answers to anyone else's questions...but I have a question myself. In around the late 1980's or early 1990's I acquired a cassette tape with a male singer, whose name escapes me, and along with all his other songs he sang \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\". His rendition was fabulous. Note-range impeccable. I was living in Ontario, Canada when the cassette came out, although I'm sure this guy was American and not much older than around 25. This is what I can remember: he was mid-20's, was white, (I don't mean that racially, only helpfully), added no fancy flair, (didn't need to), I think he went National, not sure. He wasn't country, classical, jazz, or rap...just plain beautiful singing. The other songs on this tape were equally well-sung and were mostly love songs. I have been looking for this artist and in particular this tape for 25+yrs. Can anyone help me?\n\nHundreds of singers have recorded their own versions of \"Over the Rainbow\" , most notably by Patti LaBelle, Melissa Manchester, Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, Linda Eder, Johnny Mathis, Jo Stafford, Doris Day, Martina McBride, Ella Fitzgerald, Olivia Newton-John, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett, and the late Eva Cassidy. Barbra Streisand, Eric Clapton, Kylie Minogue, and Garland's daughters Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft have sung the song in concert. One of the most interesting versions was recorded by the late Hawaiian singer Israel Kamakawiwo'olewhose medley of \"Rainbow\" and Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" was featured on the soundtrack of the films Meet Joe Black, Finding Forrester, and 50 First Dates. James Stewart memorably warbled a rendition while carrying a \"drunk\" Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story. Even horror legend Vincent Price did a version in the film Dr. Phibes Rises Again.\n\nBritish television comedian Kenny Everett sometimes did comedy segments that included the unique sound of a British police car siren and Everett singing the lyrics, \"Behind me!\" and \"That's where you'll find me!\"\n\nThe cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes covered the song for their 1999 album Are a Drag, and in the animated series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Grey Delisle sang it as her character, Mandy. Guitarist Joe Satriani occasionally covers the song at his concerts.\n\n=) I'm really happy today, I've learn more than ever, i found this afternoon a compilation of some versions of SOTR available for free at \" http://www.radioblogclub.com/open/103741/thomas_newman/Meet%20Joe%20Black%20-%20Thomas%20Newman%20-%20Somewhere%20Over%20The%20Rainbow \"\n\nYou can't download, and there're some errors about singers but that's really not important to appreciate these songs.\n\nYou can find versions of:\n\n-Judy Garland(for sure+ Disney version)\n\n-Israel Kamakawiwo'ole Meet Joe Black and Finding Forester)\n\n-Tony Bennett(Jazz Version)\n\n-Chat Baker\n\n-Tom Waits\n\n-Ray Charles\n\n-Ella Fitzgerald(Jazz but with female voice)\n\n-Placido Domingo(seems to be a really old version, as an opera.

An additional verse was to play when Dorothy was locked in a room in the witch's castle, helplessly awaiting death as the witch's hourglass ran out. A rehearsal recording of the song survives and was included in the Deluxe CD set. In that rendition, Dorothy weeps her way through it, unable to finish, concluding with a tear-filled, \"I'm frightened, Auntie Em; I'm frightened!\" Garland's tearful rendition of this extra verse was reportedly deemed so heart-wrenching that it was edited from the film, in order to spare young viewers from its powerful emotions, especially given the startling scene that immediately followed it.\n\nModern-day recordings of the song\n\nSam Harris performed a winning rendition on the first season of the original Star Search.\n\nBarbra Streisand,\n\nBette Midler,\n\nEric Clapton,\n\nJerry Lee Lewis,\n\nKylie Minogue,\n\nRufus Wainwright,\n\nCeltic Woman (with �rla Fallon)\n\nGarland's daughters Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft have sung the song in concert.\n\nIsrael Kamakawiwo'ole (Meet Joe Black, Finding Forrester, and 50 First Dates)\n\nJames Stewart ( in The Philadelphia Story)\n\nVincent Price\n\nElisabeth Andreassen\n\nThe Demensions (doo-wop version in 1960)\n\nDiana Ross (1990 Academy Awards)\n\nKenny Everett\n\nMe First and the Gimme Gimmes\n\nJoe Satriani\n\nRitchie Blackmore\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins (live concert album Earphoria)\n\nRay Charles's (Genius Loves Company) as a duet with Johnny Mathis.\n\nOliver Field\n\nJane MonheitKimberley Locke.\n\nKyla\n\nSarah Geronimo & Sheryn Regis\n\nAngela Chang\n\nDavid Tao\n\nGoh Kheng Long\n\nTim\n\nKylie Minogue's\n\nAngela Chang\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nArt Tatum\n\nAselin Debison\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nBette Midler\n\nBilly Thorpe & The Aztecs\n\nBlink 182\n\nBob Marley\n\nBobby McFerrin\n\nThe Blanks (in the Scrubs episode \"My Way Home\" as the Worthless Peons)\n\nBuckethead (recorded as Somewhere over the Slaughterhouse)\n\nCarly Simon\n\nCatherine Wagener\n\nCarnie Wilson\n\nC�line Dion\n\nCeltic Woman\n\nChad Mitchell Trio\n\nChet Baker\n\nConnie Francis\n\nCosmic Gate\n\nDana\n\nDave Brubeck\n\nDave Koz\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nDavid Grisman\n\nDeep Purple\n\nDizzy Gillespie\n\nDoris Day\n\nEdyta Gorniak\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\nElizabeth Marvelly\n\nEric Clapton\n\nErroll Garner\n\nEva Cassidy\n\nEydie Gorm�\n\nFaith Hill\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nFreddie Wadling\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nGuy Sebastian\n\nHarry Connick, Jr.\n\nHarry Nilsson\n\nIl Divo\n\nIsrael Kamakawiwo'ole\n\nJackie Wilson\n\nJake Shimabukuro\n\nJames Galway\n\nJane Monheit\n\nJerry Lee Lewis\n\nJewel\n\nJim Brickman\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nJingle Cats\n\nJo Stafford\n\nJohn Martyn\n\nJohnny Mathis\n\nJoey Foxx\n\nJon Edmiston\n\nKatharine McPhee\n\nKatherine Jenkins\n\nKeith Jarrett\n\nKenny G\n\nKimberley Locke\n\nKirk Whalum\n\nKyla\n\nKylie Minogue\n\nLeon Russell\n\nLeona Lewis\n\nLiberace\n\nLinda Eder\n\nLivington Taylor\n\nLouis Prima\n\nMaceo Parker\n\nM�go de Oz\n\nMandy Patinkin\n\nMariah Carey\n\nMartin Taylor\n\nMartina McBride\n\nMarusha\n\nMe First and the Gimme Gimmes\n\nMelanie C\n\nMelissa Manchester\n\nmelody.\n\nMetallica\n\nMichael Ball\n\nMormon Tabernacle Choir\n\nNana Mouskouri\n\nNorah Jones\n\nOlivia Newton-John\n\nOscar Peterson\n\nPatti LaBelle\n\nPhil Collins\n\nPhish\n\nPl�cido Domingo\n\nThe Platters\n\nQueen\n\nRainbow\n\nRay Charles\n\nReel Big Fish\n\nRenee Fleming\n\nRenee Olstead\n\nRichard Clayderman\n\nRichard Elliot\n\nRicki-Lee Coulter\n\nRosenshontz\n\nSam Harris\n\nSandy Patty\n\nSarah Vaughan\n\nSelena\n\nShawn McDonald\n\nShayne Ward\n\nShirley Bassey\n\nStan Getz\n\nStan Kenton\n\nStanley Jordan\n\nSteve Stevens\n\nSteve Vai\n\nSusannah McCorkle\n\nThe Flaming Lips\n\nThe Innocence Mission\n\nThe Mystics\n\nThe Ohio Players\n\nThe Platters\n\nThe Ramones\n\nTiny Tim\n\nTom Jones\n\nTommy Emmanuel\n\nTony Bennett\n\nTori Amos\n\nVic Damone\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nLeona Lewis\n\nChris Impellitteri\n\nGene Vincent\n\nIn The Wizard of Oz, Over the Rainbow, part of the song was cut from the film.
