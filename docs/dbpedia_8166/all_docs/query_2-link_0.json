Aselin Debison's singing career began when she was just eight years old. In 1999, Aselin Debison was asked to sing for thousands of miners during a rally at a skating rink in her hometown. Aselin Debison sang The Island (a Cape Breton anthem) and it aired on local TV stations.\n\nAselin Debison's Big Break:\n\nAselin Debison was spotted by Sony Classical President, Peter Gelb, at the 2002 East Coast Music Awards. Aselin Debison's now signed to a five album record deal with Sony Music. Aselin Debison's style is Celtic-influenced, pop-folk music. Aselin Debison describes her style as \"rootsy.\"\n\nAselin Debison - Did U know?\n\nAselin Debison's first name name came from the lion, Aslan, in C.S Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nOther than Celtic and folk music, Aselin Debison's into Britney Spears, *NSYNC, Christina Aguilera and Destiny's Child.\n\nAselin Debison collects porcelain dolls and likes to ride her scooter.\n\nAselin Debison Says...\n\n\"My singing voice is a gift, and I don't want to take any lessons that will do anything to it.
