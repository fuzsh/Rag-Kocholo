        "text": "Solutions & Services\n\nWe designed our solutions and services with Value Propositions as the core, providing a strong foundation of offerings around the complete Value Proposition Life Cycle - from development through execution and assessment. These slices of the life cycle cover the many ways in which you work with Value Propositions. No matter where you are focusing within the life cycle it is vital to recognize both the internal and external aspects of each slice. Internally all functional areas, such as Marketing, Sales and Operations, just to name a few, should support the Value Proposition. Externally your various constituents - customers, partners, investors, etc., should see and feel the proposition come to life. That is why within each slice of the Value Proposition Life Cycle, we provide specific solutions and services that focus on the internal perspective and the external perspective, as well as bringing both perspectives together. As all of these components of the Value Proposition Life Cycle are never mutually exclusive, we pull together the right combination of these solutions and services to specifically target your needs.\n\nMoreover, it never matters where you are within the life cycle. For each client, it varies at which point in this life cycle our work begins. Some are launching a new product in which we help develop a strong, differentiated Value Proposition. Others have a Value Proposition but need help executing on it properly. Other still may just want an objective assessment on whether their propositions are in fact translating to their customers the way they intend. No matter where you are with your value proposition, Mezzanine Consulting LLC has the right set of solutions and services to assist you in achieving your objectives."
