        "text": "\"Moonlight Shadow\" is a pop song written and performed by English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, released as a single in May 1983, and included in the album, Crises, of the same year.[2] The vocals were performed by Scottish vocalist Maggie Reilly, who had joined Mike Oldfield in 1980. It is Oldfield's most successful single to date, reaching number one on a number of charts around Europe.\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Release\n\n2 Live performances\n\n3 Artwork\n\n4 Production\n\n5 Lyrical content\n\n6 Video\n\n7 Track listing\n\n7.1 7-inch vinyl\n\n7.2 12-inch vinyl\n\n7.3 German vinyl\n\n7.4 1988 CD\n\n7.5 1993 CD\n\n8 Chart positions\n\n8.1 Year-End Chart\n\n9 Personnel\n\n10 Appearances and influence in other media\n\n11 Cover versions\n\n11.1 Groove Coverage version\n\n12 References\n\n13 External links\n\nRelease[edit][]\n\nThe single peaked at number 4 in the British charts, making it Oldfield's second highest ranked single after \"Portsmouth\", which reached number 3 in 1976. \"Moonlight Shadow\" was successful throughout Europe. It reached number 1 in many countries, including Brazil for two weeks, Italy, Austria, Switzerland for four weeks and Norway for six weeks. It spent four weeks at number 2 in Germany, hit number 6 in Australia, and peaked at number 3 in New Zealand and France. It was re-released as a maxi-CD single in 1993 to promote Oldfield's Elements box set, charting at number 52.\n\nA 12\" single (later reissued on a 3\" CD single) featured an extended version of the song with an extra verse, and the single B-side was \"Rite of Man\", which was a rare instance of Oldfield singing lead vocal. The extended mix also appears on his compilation album The Platinum Collection.\n\nIn 1991 the song was re-released in France, and in 1993 it was featured on promos for Elements in France and Spain. The 1993 reissue included \"Bones\" and \"In the Pool\" as B-sides, which had previously been released as B-sides with \"To France\". Furthermore the name of the song was used for the 2013 Universal Music compilation album of Oldfield's music, Moonlight Shadow: The Collection.\n\nLive performances[edit][]\n\nMaggie Reilly sang \"Moonlight Shadow\" live when she toured with Oldfield in the 1980s. However since then, other singers have performed the song live with Oldfield including, Anita Hegerland(during the late 1980s), Pepsi Demacque (at the Tubular Bells III premiere and at the Live Then & Now '99 tour), Miriam Stockley (at the Millennium concert) and Rosa Cedrón (at Nokia Night of the Proms).\n\nArtwork[edit][]\n\nThe original cover art is an enlargement of the lower right corner of the Crises album cover by UK artist Terry Ilott. This shows a man with his foot on a ledge with the sea and sky in the background. The moon, the tower and its shadow from the album cover cannot be seen on the single cover.\n\nThe artwork for the 1993 reissue followed the style of the Elements artwork in most countries.\n\nProduction[edit][]\n\nAn early version of the song was entitled \"Midnight Passion\" with vocals by British singer Hazel O'Connor.[3] Along with Maggie Reilly, a girlfriend of one of the roadies when Oldfield was on tour, Oldfield used a rhyming dictionary and recorded many of the lyrics word by word.[4] According to Oldfield, Virgin Records were immediately happy with the song and wanted more pieces similar to it.[citation needed] Reilly also sang on \"Foreign Affair\" on Crises.\n\nOldfield later sampled the drums from \"Moonlight Shadow\" for the song \"Man in the Rain\" on his 1998 album, Tubular Bells III.[5]\n\nAn unplugged mix of the song appears on the 2013 Mercury Records reissue of the Crises album.\n\nLyrical content[edit][]\n\nIt has been suggested that the lyrics of the song are a reference to the murder of John Lennon despite the fact that the events in the song do not correspond with those of Lennon's murder.[6][7] Lennon was shot four times just before 11pm, whereas in the song the time is 4am and the number of shots is six. When asked if \"Moonlight Shadow\" is a reference to John Lennon's murder in a 1995 interview, Oldfield responded:\n\nNot really... well, perhaps, when I look back on it, maybe it was. I actually arrived in New York that awful evening when he was shot and I was staying at the Virgin Records house in Perry Street, which was just a few blocks down the road from the Dakota Building where it happened, so it probably sank into my subconscious. It was originally inspired by a film I loved – 'Houdini', starring Tony Curtis, which was about attempts to contactHoudini after he'd died, through spiritualism... it was originally a song influenced by that, but a lot of other things must have crept in there without me realizing it.\n\n—Mike Oldfield, \"Gareth Randall Interviews Mike Oldfield\".\n\nIn the German lyrics, sung by Juliane Werding, it's seven shots, obviously due to singability.[citation needed]\n\nVideo[edit][]\n\nThere are two versions of the video: the full-length original, and a shorter one which omits a verse. The reason for the shorter version was for the requirements of some TV broadcasters, and the way both versions are edited suggests that Oldfield's touring guitarist \"Ant\" (Anthony Glynne) performed the second, overdriven half of the guitar solo, which is not the case. Also in the video is Oldfield's touring drummer, Pierre Moerlen, miming the part played by Simon Phillips on the recording.\n\nTrack listing[edit][]\n\n7-inch vinyl[edit][]\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" (7\" mix) – 3:37\n\n\"Rite of Man\" – 2:21\n\n12-inch vinyl[edit][]\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" (Extended version) – 5:18\n\n\"Rite of Man\" – 2:21\n\nGerman vinyl[edit][]\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" – 3:37\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" (Extended version) – 5:18\n\n\"Rite of Man\" – 2:21\n\n\"To France\" – 4:43\n\n\"Jungle Gardenia\" – 2:45 (Mike Oldfield)\n\n\"Taurus 3\" – 2:25\n\n1988 CD[edit][]\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" (Extended version) – 5:18\n\n\"Rite of Man\" – 2:21\n\n\"To France\" – 4:44\n\n\"Jungle Gardenia\" – 2:44\n\n1993 CD[edit][]\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" – 3:35\n\n\"Moonlight Shadow\" (Extended version) – 5:18\n\n\"In the Pool\" – 3:40\n\n\"Bones\" – 3:19\n\nChart positions[edit][]\n\nThe song performed particularly well in European charts, reaching number one in countries such as Norway, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland and Austria.\n\nChart (1983) Peak\n\nposition\n\nAustralian Singles Chart[citation needed] 6 Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40)[8] 1 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)[9] 1 Eurochart Hot 100[citation needed] 1 Germany (Media Control AG)[10] 2 Irish Singles Chart[citation needed] 1 Italy (FIMI)[11] 1 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)[12] 2 Netherlands (Mega Single Top 100)[13] 1 French Singles Chart[14] 3 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)[15] 3 Norway (VG-lista)[16] 1 Polish Singles Chart[citation needed] 1 South African Singles Chart[17] 7 Spain (AFYVE)[18] 1 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)[19] 1 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)[20] 1 UK Singles (Official Charts Company)[21] 4\n\nYear-End Chart[edit][]\n\nChart (1984) Peak\n\nposition\n\nAustralian Singles Chart 52 Austrian Singles Chart 1 Belgian VRT Top 30 7 Dutch Singles Chart 5 German Media Control Charts 3 Italian Singles Chart 6 Spanish Singles Chart 2 Swiss Singles Chart 2 U.K. Singles Chart 29\n\nPreceded by\n\n\"Flashdance...
