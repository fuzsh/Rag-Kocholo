        "text": "I've been meaning to start this thread for a while. Here is my album-by-album of the amazing career of one Garth Brooks (I didn't do every album, though):\n\nGARTH BROOKS (self-titled debut)- Great album that really ushered in a new breed of country music that we would go on to hear in the nineties. Major singles were \"Not Counting You\", \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\", \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old), and \"The Dance\". Great non-single tracks as well. Garth had a hand in writing 5 of the 10 tracks.\n\nNO FENCES - Another great album which would start a trend among the rest of Garth's albums; strange album titles. (Usually in country music the album title was either the artist's name, a name taken from a song on the album, or a description of what was on the album.) Major singles include \"The Thunder Roles\" (the video for which was banned from TNN because it was deemed too violent), \"Two Of A Kind, Workin' On A Full House\", \"Friends In Low Places\", and \"Unanswered Prayers\". This album also sports backing vocals from Trisha Yearwood (who would go on to solo success a while afterwards and is now engaged to Garth.) There is also a great cover of \"Mr. Blue\". Radio plays a lot of the album cuts including \"Wild Horses\" (not The Rolling Stones song.)\n\nROPIN' THE WIND - Even though it was first known as \"son of NO FENCES\", this album would go on to create the biggest sensation of any Garth album yet! It was the first album in history to debut at #1 on both the Billboard 200 Top Albums chart and the Billboard country chart. It was Garth's second album to sell ten million copies! On the country chart, while \"Ropin'\" was at #1, #2 and #3 were \"No Fences\" and \"Garth Brooks\" respectively. Major singles included \"Shameless\" (written and first recorded by Billy Joel), \"The River\", \"Papa Loved Mama\", \"Rodeo\", and \"What She's Doing Now\". Amazingly, no videos were created for this album.\n\nTHE CHASE - While it was very successful, I thought \"The Chase\" was kind of dissapointing. It contained a leftover from the \"Ropin'\" sessions (\"Walkin' After Midnight\") and a cover of \"Dixie Chicken\". Major singles included \"We Shall Be Free\" and \"That Summer\". There were some singles that don't get much fanfare, \"Somewhere Other Than The Night\" and \"Learning To Live Again\" just didn't work for Garth. Tony Arata, writer of the dance, returns for \"Face To Face\". This brings up an interesting Garth trait, he puts his favorite songs last on the albums.\n\nIN PIECES - This is more like it. Great singles on this album like \"Standing Outside The Fire\", \"American Honky-Tonk Bar Association\", \"Ain't Going Down (Til The Sun Comes Up)\", \"The Red Strokes\" (strange video for this one), and \"Calling Baton Rouge\". The non-single album tracks weren't really magical but \"One Night A Day\" did become a concert favorite around this time.\n\nTHE HITS - Nothing new here. Good for a Garth newbie.\n\nFRESH HORSES - I never bothered to buy this one. It was a commercial dissapointment for which Garth blamed the record label.\n\nSEVENS - Garth at the top of his game. Upping the ante to 14 songs (instead of the ussual 10), Garth is hot of the heels of his phenominal Central Park concert (I was there!) \"Longneck Bottle\" features Steve Wariner. \"Two Pina Coladas\" was the biggest hit on here. \"You Move Me\" and \"Do What You Gotta Do\" were modest hits. If you are a Garth newbie, get this along with \"The Hits\" and you should be all set.\n\n\"The Dance\" is the song that got me into country music. I'm not ashamed to admit that. Before I heard that song (actually, I saw the video on TNN or CMT), I tended only to like country songs that crossed over to the pop charts, with a rare exception such as \"Pancho and Lefty\" or \"Highwayman.\" But thanks to \"The Dance,\" and the awfully rare original 45 that I found around the same time, I became a country music fan, both new and old.\n\nAlso, \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old),\" Garth's first hit single, is a classic country song worthy of ANYONE's catalog. The only better rodeo songs are \"Amarillo By Morning\" and \"Someday Soon.\"\n\nThis was the only Garth Brooks album released to stores on vinyl in the United States; it's a tough one to find. Somewhat easier to find, though still tough, is the Columbia House version with the extra \"5\" in the catalog number.\n\nActually, the album title fits Garth's intent perfectly; he wanted to break down the artificial barriers between different styles of music, especially between country and other kinds of music, thus \"no fences.\" This album made Garth Brooks into a Phenomenon. Four singles hit #1 on the country charts, and \"Wild Horses\" made the top 10 a full 10 years after this album was originally issued.\n\nThis album was a beneficiary of Billboard magazine's change in chart methods that took place in 1991. Before then, the LP charts were based on reports of sales filed by humans, and it was said for years that these reports understated the sales of two kinds of music -- country and contemporary Christian. When, in the first week of the SoundScan chart, No Fences instantly jumped from the mid-teens to #2, there was the proof for the country side. Never again would country music's popularity be understated.\n\nVinyl copies of No Fences were issued by both the Columbia House and BMG music clubs; the BMG version is more desirable, but both are rare.\n\nA little bit of a slump; this album had \"only\" three #1 country singles, \"Shameless,\" \"What She's Doing Now\" and \"The River.\" All told, another excellent album; the rot had not yet begun to set in. I personally prefer No Fences, but this, too, is a fine collection of songs.\n\nThis was the last Garth LP to see any vinyl release in the States; it came out through Columbia House and is even more rare than No Fences. Peculiarly, the U.S. vinyl version has six songs on one side and four on the other...\n\nThis, to me, is where Garth started to forget what got him to the top in the first place. There were still two #1 singles -- \"Somewhere Other Than the Night\" and \"That Summer\" -- but neither one (IMO) was in the same league as his earlier hits. I've always had a soft spot for \"Learning to Live Again.\"\n\nMy opinion of this CD isn't nearly as high as Jared's. I enjoyed \"Ain't Going Down (Til the Sun Comes Up),\" which was one of his fastest-rising #1 singles ever, as it came out a couple months before the album did. But I never liked \"Standing Outside the Fire,\" which I feel is Garth's most overrated song. \"Calling Baton Rouge\" was good, and \"One Night a Day\" is a nice ballad, but the rot was definitely setting in by here.\n\nThis album, other than being the most unlimited \"limited edition\" CD ever (it's officially out of print, but still very easy to find), is noteworthy for an associated promotional item, the \"CD Zooming\" disc, which included a 30-second (or so) snippet of every song on every Garth album to that point, divided by album. Each album section began with a brief comment from Garth about that album. It was originally going to be offered as a bonus disc with The Hits, but became a mail-order premium because, in the rush to get the CD out by Christmas in 1994, the two parts could not be assembled. Thus the \"CD Zooming\" disc is fairly hard to find.\n\nI had to look it up to remember what was on this one. It has one great song on it, \"The Beaches of Cheyenne\" -- Garth's last great single IMO. This was also when Capitol's special markets division stopped routinely issuing Garth's radio hits on \"jukebox only\" 45s; after \"Beaches,\" only sporadic others came out on 45, thus forcing singles fans to find promotional CD singles. (None of Garth's hits were ever issued on commercial CD singles, unless you include Chris Gaines, and none after 1990 were on cassette singles.)\n\n\"The Fever\" was his attempt to re-do an Aerosmith song; \"She's Every Woman,\" the first single and a #1 hit, was nothing to get excited about.\n\nIMO, not a great album. \"Two Pina Coladas\" is another overrated song. \"Longneck Bottle\" and \"Do What You Gotta Do\" came out on 45s, but none of the others did... Some of the momentum of Sevens was interrupted by the release of The Limited Series box set and the release of the Bob Dylan-composed \"To Make You Feel My Love\" as a single to radio (promo only).\n\nA couple of stray tracks: \"Hard Luck Woman,\" which Garth did for the KISS my A$$ tribute album, sounds scarily like the original version... Also, there was a 45 of \"Friends in Low Places (Live Version),\" lifted from a 1992 video, that contained the legendary \"third verse\" of the song...\n\nI want to mention another one of Garth's albums, because I think it's excellent. That is his first Christmas CD, Beyond the Season. Many nice re-makes are on here, including the second-best version of \"Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy\" (no one could surpass Buck Owens' original). Plus it had several original tunes; \"The Old Man's Back in Town\" was serviced to radio as a single (and was issued on a 45) and rocks. Another one, \"The Gift,\" was written by Stephanie Davis, a regular songwriter for Garth in the early days. Why Garth's version was overlooked is a mystery; \"The Gift\" was re-made in a stunning version a couple years ago by someone named Aselin Debison."
