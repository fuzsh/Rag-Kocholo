        "text": "Susan. 1987 April 20,2018\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident\n\nI have my mother at Marian for almost a year. The only problem I see or hear about is laundry. I know keeping it sorted is a big job and I appreciate the free service, but my mother's laundry is important to me. Other than that, I am pleased. I would give it 4 and a half stars. I am deducting half a point for the laundry!\n\nRandyG2991 November 11, 2017\n\nI am very happy with Marian Manor. Good people, good food and not charging me an arm and a leg!\n\nUser1111471 May 23,2017\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident\n\nI am pleased with the care my father has gotten. It is a small home with 40 beds, but I like the feel of it. The staff are kind and attentive. The front office is responsive and understanding. I would say every one cares about the people there. Dad has dementia so it is hard for him to tell me anything but he does say the food is good but they serve too much. He says they are good to him so I am happy.\n\nMama190865 February 19, 2017\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident\n\nMy aunt has been here for a little over 4 months. I like the care, the people and the staff. I like where it is located but I do not like the new buildings going in all way around it. I do notlike the road to get to it but once you are on there property it is beautiful. In my opionion it is nice and a good place to have people cared for. My aunt is always clean and cared for. The place is clean. The staff seems to be always the same and not always different people. If they need to change anything, it is the road to get there. The administrative people say the road is not theres but they should complain to whoever it belongs to to get it fixed! I recommend the place for the care.\n\nUser1095935 March 11, 2017\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident\n\nI toured Marian Manor last weekend. I liked it a great deal. My mother is still able to do some things for herself, but not a lot. She is not safe to stay in her home alone because she can not remember to turn the stove off, lock the doors or just be safe in general. I will certainly use Marian Manor when mom can no longer stay in her home with home health care. The prices for Marian Manor are in line with others in the area, maybe a little cheaper . Nice little home . Recommended looking into if your loved one needs care.\n\nMary 78 December 1 2016\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident\n\nI toured Marian looking for a place for my dad who has dementia. When I stopped by, I was met by a friendly administrator who spent over an hour with me, helping me understanding what my choices were.. She was very knowledgeable about dementia. I really liked the atmosphere of the place, warm and homey. I moved my dad in the following week. Since he has been there, he has gotten stronger and seems better since they straightened out his numerous medications . The place is clean and does not smell like a nursing home. I would be happy to talk to anyone about Marian and recommend it.. It is an older building but well taken care of. I don't care about all the hoop-la of the bells and whistles other places have, I was more concerned about the care dad would receive. and he gets good care. As far as I am concerned that is what matters.\n\nUser1987245 July 27th,2016\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident\n\nMy mom was at Marian Manor until her death. They gave the best care to her that I could expect. The staff was exceptionally kind to my mother and my family. We would pop in at no special time during the weekdays and weekends and the place was always clean, the people taken care of . I would recommend Marian Manor to anyone looking for care for a loved one. I was very happy with how they took care of my mother and would recommend it to anyone.\n\nCharlie D April 18, 2016\n\nI am a friend or relative of resident"
