Alexandra Chando has joined the cast for The CW pilot Dead People.

Chando will star opposite The Walking Dead's Andrew J West, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Dead People follows a cab driver called Floyd (West), who - after a near-death experience - finds that he can communicate with ghosts.

Floyd's new ability gives him the opportunity to speak to his late ex-wife Pearl (Chando), who he has never gotten over.

Pearl, described as "sweet and funny", tries to help Floyd move on with his life.

Dead People is written and executive produced by Tom Kapinos (Californication).

Chando is known for her roles as Emma Becker and Sutton Mercer in The Lying Game .
