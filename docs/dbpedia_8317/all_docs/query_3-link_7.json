Strong, tasteful, and elegant, Alexandra remains a chic modern classic with a solid historic pedigree.\n\nAlexandra is the feminine form of Alexander, which ultimately derived from the Greek components alexein, meaning \"to defend,\" and anÄ“r, \"man.\" In Greek mythology, Alexandra was an epithet of the goddess Hera.\n\nAlexandra was made fashionable in the English-speaking world by the Danish princess who married England's King Edward VII in 1863, and there have been other royal bearers in both Britain and Russia. Alexandra is the present queen's first middle name. Widely used in Russia, Alexandras can be found in the works of Dostoevsky and Chekhov."
