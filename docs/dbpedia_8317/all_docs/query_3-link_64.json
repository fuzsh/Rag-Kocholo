Unlike Emma, who has bounced from foster home to foster home, Sutton was adopted by wealthy parents, Ted (series star ANDY BUCKLEY) and Kristin Mercer (series star HELEN SLATER), and is seemingly living every teenager's dream life. Both girls are eager to meet each other in person, yet Sutton feels it is better to wait until she tells her adoptive parents what she has discovered.

Wanting to please the father she never had, Emma must learn to ballroom dance for the annual father-daughter dance. Realizing she is in dire need of assistance, Ethan offers to help, in turn risking revealing his and Sutton's secret relationship. Will Emma be able to put aside her worries for Sutton and shine on the dance floor? Or will the night's series of events force her to reveal her true identity? Meanwhile, as the teenagers do anything to keep their secrets, the parents may be lying to keep life-altering secrets of their own.\n\n42 min Â· Aug 21, 2011 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 3\n\nDouble Dibs\n\nAfter revealing Sutton's real relationship with Ethan, the Mercers insist she invite him over for dinner.

As Emma and Ethan struggle to keep order in Arizona, Sutton and Thayer (recurring guest star CHRISTIAN ALEXANDER - Eastwick) discover shocking revelations in Los Angeles pertaining to the search for the girls' birth mother. Although the outcome may not turn out to be what Sutton had hoped for, it does lead her to wonder what it is that everyone around her has been hiding all of these years.

With this discovery, Sutton asks Emma to try to remember all the memories she has of her childhood with their birth mother, which, for Emma, is slim to none. It is not until during a nighttime rendezvous with Ethan that Emma remembers pieces of her former life, allowing Sutton to locate the house which Emma shared with their long-lost mother, as well as secrets many around them have tried to hide. Will the house and the new information be the missing piece of the puzzle, or are the superstitions true? Can curiosity kill? Meanwhile, with Ethan facing a lot of trouble, Emma tries to convince Ted that Ethan is innocent. But when she pushes, Emma sees she has hit a nerve with Ted, leading her to believe that he might be hiding something. Although she does not know what, it appears Ted is feeling guilty and knows more than he is willing to share.\n\n41 min Â· Sep 4, 2011 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 5\n\nOver Exposed\n\nWith the Homecoming dance fast approaching, Emma is shocked to find out that Sutton is running for queen. Panicked, Emma devises a plan to not have to attend the dance, thus dropping out of the race against Nisha, which raises red flags for all who know Sutton. Realizing that she must go through with it, Emma is rushed back into the spotlight and finds herself clinging to Ethan for support and comfort. Although both know Sutton wants the relationship kept a secret, the homecoming dance electrifies feelings that have been present from their first meeting. Will Ethan and Emma go behind Sutton's back and finally take the \"secret\" relationship public? Or, by doing so, will a much anticipated relationship emerge?\n\n41 min Â· Sep 11, 2011 TV-14\n\nEPISODE 6\n\nBad Boys Break Hearts\n\nNow that Sutton has realized there is more than just a friendship brewing between Emma and Ethan, she decides to get revenge in her own way.

Even though she knows she should make amends, Sutton cannot bring herself to allow any distractions to get in the way of finding Annie Hobbes. Back in Arizona, Emma has begun to conduct her own investigation, possibly endangering her secret switch with Sutton. Will Sutton and Emma be able to find Annie Hobbes, or will their search endanger not only their lives but the lives of others as well?\n\n41 min Â· Sep 18, 2011 TV-14"
