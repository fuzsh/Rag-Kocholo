The series was produced by Pratt Enterprises, Alloy Entertainment, and Warner Horizon Television and is loosely based on a series of books of the same name by Sara Shepard. It stars Alexandra Chando, playing as the twin sisters Sutton Mercer and Emma Becker. On July 15, 2013, Chando confirmed the series was canceled by the network after two seasons.[1][2]\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series follows Emma Becker, a kind-hearted foster child in Vegas who learns she has an identical twin sister named Sutton Mercer in Phoenix. Sutton, unlike Emma, was adopted by wealthy parents and is seemingly living an ideal life. Emma runs away from Vegas to Phoenix to meet Sutton after wrongful accusations about her were made.[3] After their initial meeting, Sutton talks Emma into stepping into her life for a few days while she pursues a lead on the mysterious identity of their birth mother. After Sutton inexplicably fails to return to the girls’ designated meeting place, Emma must decide whether to come clean about her identity and risk her own safety in the hope of uncovering her twin sister's whereabouts, along with the truth about why they were separated in the first place.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile the television series shares many of the same characters as the book series of the same name, there are important differences (chief among them that Sutton is deceased in the books):[4]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nAlexandra Chando as Sutton Mercer and Emma Becker (Emma Paxton in the books[5]).
