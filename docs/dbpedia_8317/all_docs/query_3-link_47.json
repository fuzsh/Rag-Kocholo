Korey, who’s absolutely wonderful to speak with and extremely talented, chatted with me recently about her music and upcoming release. Music has always been a passion for the talented actress, and now all of her hardwork has paid off with her very first EP!\n\nNo bias needed, Korey’s music is absolutely beautiful and my iTunes is ready to make some downloads. “Love Me Let You Go,” “Break of Dawn” and “I Surrender” are just some of her songs that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nNew EP comes out at the end of August! When did you know you wanted to get serious about singing?\n\nTINSEL KOREY: I’ve always been doing it side by side and a lot of people haven’t known. I’ve been performing for years now. It’s just that my acting career took off before my music career did and it was always kind of like a juggling act. So I’ve actually been writing songs for a very long time and then this year I was just like, I need to get it done because every year the fans are like, “When is the album coming?” And I’m always like next year next year and finally I was like you know what, I just need to do it this year. So I kind of just put my foot down and made it happen.\n\nDid you need to take some time off from acting projects?\n\nNo, I didn’t step away from acting. I’m kind of waiting for the right project right now. So it was a matter of the project. I’m looking for comedy and action right now. So it just kind of just gave me a little bit of a break and I was still auditioning and doing that kind of stuff. But I just told my team I really need to focus on music unless something grand comes up. And so since the beginning of the year, the first four months—just really focusing and I did it at night. So I was able to take meetings and still do auditions and do all that. I just worked pretty much from 7 p.m. to two in the morning.\n\nHow long did the process take?\n\nAbout four months!\n\nHow do you feel about the final product?\n\nI mean it’s amazing. I’ve been doing this for a very long time and I’m an independent artist, which means I have to do everything by myself—funds and everything. Since you’re going through the emotions and you’re writing down your lyrics and writing down your songs and to see it all in a package is an amazing feeling. Especially since I did it myself and I don’t have a label backing me, or anything. It’s definitely a proud moment.\n\nYou’ve written all the tracks. What’s the process like when you write a song? What’s one of your favorites?\n\nI think “I Surrender” is now my favorite. I wrote that song a few years back, like four years ago, and then when I was looking at my catalog of music to pick which ones I wanted to put on the album that one just kept coming up in my head. Then we reworked it so the original is different. The lyrics are the same, but the music and everything has changed. Just the feeling of inspiration that I get from it now compared to where it was before. It was a little sadder. It’s interesting to see how it has transitioned over the time into this almost like inspiring song about surrendering to love.\n\nAre you planning on going on tour?\n\nI mean yeah, I would love to! I’m very green to music. So a lot of times I don’t know what I’m doing. I would love to go on tour, but I don’t know how that works. I’m learning as I go along, which is really interesting for me to share with my fans because I know a lot of them have aspirations for music. But I definitely want to perform and I have been in the past just figuring out the time and maybe where to perform and just how that all works. I’m learning as I go along. All I know myself is that I love making music. It’s the passion that really is driving me right now. The business stuff I’m sort of finding my step in.\n\nAre the nerves (if any) different between singing and acting?\n\nI don’t think you really lose that nerve. That’s part of the excitement of feeling alive when you’re making art. I think with acting—I’ve been doing it professionally a lot longer so I don’t get as nervous. But with music, the rush and the build up to getting the words out of your mouth is definitely a nerve-racking thing. And then once I start singing it’s like part of your soul. Just jumps out on stage and you’re just like, ‘Oh, okay. I’m all right.’ And you can just live in that beautiful moment of expressing what’s coming through you.\n\nDo you have any rituals before you head into the studio?\n\nI always have tea with lots and lots of honey. That’s something that I have every time I’ve gotten to the studio. I don’t know if I have a tradition. This process has been a lot different just because music wise I was working with my producer on it. There’s this one time when I remember I was trying to write a happy song, because a lot of my songs are really thought provoking and about relationships. I was like, ‘I need to write a happy song.’ But it made me angry and I ended up writing a song that was darker. But it had the intention. I realized you can’t have an intention of going into the studio. If you go in there like, ‘I’m going to do this,’ it’s just not going to happen. I just remember being so frustrated and so angry. I don’t think we ended up using that song. You just have to let what happens in the studio happen and just go with it.\n\nIs there someone you’d love to collaborate with?\n\nYes. Eminem.\n\nGet out of here. Are you serious?\n\nYes! I love Eminem, and I love that he is just so free with his expression but also he seems to do a lot fusion with singer songwriters that have this ethereal tone to their voice. I hope that I have that and I just love him as an artist. Eminem would be like my number one person to collaborate.\n\nWould you ever rap?\n\nYou know, something that really frustrates me is that I can’t rap! I’ve tried but I can’t do it and it frustrates me to no end! So I keep that for my karaoke nights. [Laughs]\n\n“Love Me Let Me Go” is a favorite. But what about “Break of Dawn?” Did you use some wordplay and get inspired from your time on Breaking Dawn?\n\nNo, I think it is a little bit of word play! I did write that song way before I even got Twilight. It had nothing to do with Twilight what so ever. It was definitely a word play when I was thinking about the title but it was also the song that I wanted to pitch to Breaking Dawn. I ended up being a little too late to pitch it. They listened to it and thought everything was great, but unfortunately they had already done the music score to it.\n\nAre there any television shows you’d love to feature your songs on?\n\nOh my God. There was one television show called Enlightened with with Laura Dern on HBO. It’s all about sort of finding yourself and this holistic type of living and I actually thought that “Seize the Day” would fit perfectly or “I Surrender” would fit perfectly with that show. If I could have my songs anywhere I actually think my songs fit perfectly for a soundtrack or for music in television. And so I’m sort of just trying to cross platform it and see how it works because I feel like there is a lot of story in my songs and they are kind of almost built for film and television.\n\nDid you find yourself singing a lot while filming?\n\nActually funny enough, the day after we wrapped everyone was kind of hanging out and there was this girl who was singing and then I think it was Alex [Meraz] and Bronson [Pelletier], they were like, “Tinsel, you should song!” So I borrowed her guitar and I serenaded the cast and crew with my song “Letter.” So that was kind of cool.\n\nWhat a nice memory.\n\nYeah! It was definitely a cool moment, and also just from getting encouragement from my wolf boys. That was a good thing.\n\nDo you have any plans on celebrating once the EP comes out?\n\nI’ve been thinking about an EP release and just a celebration of that. Right now I’m kind of taking one day at a time, but that’s definitely the next step—to figure out how to celebrate this next chapter in my life!\n\nWill a lot of werewolves be in attendance?\n\nWell, I hope! I’ll be really mad if they don’t. [Laughs] I would hope they would come and support me and they always have with my music, so I don’t see why they wouldn’t show up!\n\nStay tuned for more with Tinsel about Breaking Dawn: Part 2 set to premiere in November! And don’t forget, her very first EP comes out on August 30!\n\n2 Reasons Macaulay And Kieran Culkin Are Doing Something Right\n\nMila Kunis and Emma Stone. Is there anything left to say? Macauley and Kieran both landed themselves the two biggest actresses in the business right before they really made a splash in the headlines. Weird, right? When thinking about the Culkin brothers all that really comes to mind is Home Alone. “Kevin, you’re such a disease!” and Kieran wetting the bed and getting his nose squished by the chair because milk spilled everywhere. The two may not be a Ryan Gosling when it comes to looks, but they clearly have something going on if they were able to get with these two favorites.\n\nAfter a brief marriage to actress Rachel Miner in 1998, Macauley moved on to Mila Kunis in May 2002. The two dated during the time people still thought of her as Jackie from That 70s Show until calling it quits in January 2011. The relationship lasted almost a decade. TEN years. Do you know what can happen in 10 years? Do you know what did happen during that time? Two president’s took office, the very first Spider-Manhit theaters (ahem, Emma), Ryan Reynolds showed his face in Van Wilder, Harry Potter was only on its second film, A WALK TO REMEMBER premiered, Brangelina became a thing, Ashton Kutcher married Demi in 2005, some chick named Katy Perry debuted her controversial tune “I Kissed A Girl” and even something called Bieber Fever struck tweens everywhere. Mila and Macauley have experienced it all together.\n\nAs for Emma and Kieran, the couple lasted only a few months in 2010.\n\nMacauley and Kieran, how do you do it? How did you do it? There’s not much talk on the brothers now, but we imagine Mila and Emma to still be giddy about dating the boys. In fact, maybe that’s exactly what they are talking about here.\n\nNew Girl’ Hannah Simone Is More Than Adorkable, Reveals Passions Besides Acting\n\nWhere are the street youths at? How much money is in the douchbag jar right about now and what’s Nick Miller (and his adorable face) up to? New Girl is currently working on its second season, but one can’t help but miss the apartment mate shenanigans while waiting patiently for its return. Not to mention, how many times can a fan really try to play the American Drinking game without really knowing the rules? Well, while you wait for Schmidt to reappear with his silk robe, check out what Hannah Simone enjoys doing when the cameras aren’t rolling. She tells Ology what her three passions are besides playing Cece on the Emmy nominated comedy.\n\n“Food Ology is one,” she says. “I love to cook and create dishes and experiment Ology. That’s a huge passion of mine.” Mind you, she probably won’t be sticking her entire arm in a bowl of batter just to get a rise out of someone in real life.\n\n“I think movie Ology,” she adds. “I like to sit and watch. And in those 90 minutes care and love those characters. It can be somewhat magical. And traveling.”\n\nThough Hannah is on a hugely successful show at the moment, she comes off as one of the sweetest actors around. Adorkable, indeed.\n\nInterview: Garcelle Beauvais Keeps Busy With Denzel Washington’s ‘Flight’\n\nGarcelle Beauvais has essentially done it all in the entertainment business. She started out as a model, began her acting debut on television, went on to the big screen and is now writing a children’s book. Currently seen on the TBS hit Franklin & Bash, Garcelle has clearly been keeping busy since her Jamie Foxx Show days. In between acting alongside actor faves like Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Breckin Meyer, Garcelle caught up with Ology about her new book deal and upcoming film Flight that’s set to open in November. Garcelle plays the ex-wife of Denzel Washington’s character, who eventually gets accused of drinking while on the job.\n\n| Related: Garcelle give us Franklin & Bash scoop and Saved By The Bell jokes |\n\nOLOGY: You started out modeling. Did you know you eventually wanted to go into acting? How was that transition?\n\nGARCELLE BEAUVAIS: No! I had no idea I wanted to be an actress. It was really sort of like what else do you do? And I thought okay, I’m not going to go to med school. I’d rather do something more creative. And I thought, “Well, what could I do?” Acting just sort of came along and it made sense, and I had my first son Oliver and I didn’t really want to raise him in New York so I thought, “Okay, let’s move to California.” And what’s in Hollywood? Acting! Sort of like a natural transition I guess.\n\nWell, everything obviously turned out great for you! Your new film Flight comes out in a few months. Why’d you want to jump on board?\n\nWell, he–Denzel is amazing. I mean, he just makes you bring your A game. He was just amazing. I think there’s a really big twist in the movie and I think that will grab people. But [Director] Robert Zemeckis and Denzel Washington, how bad could it be?\n\nWas this the first time you ever met Denzel for a project?\n\nNo, our kids actually went to school together, but you know, just first time working with him. But I hadn’t seen him in a while so it was good.\n\nIs there anyone else you’d love to work with?\n\nYeah! I’d love to work with [George] Clooney. There are a lot of amazing people I’d love to work with. I’ve had a great career and I’m open. Open to whatever the universe brings me.\n\nHas there ever been a role you would have loved to do?\n\nSharon Stone’s part in Basic Instinct. I thought, here’s a strong, sexy, dangerous woman. I would have loved that.\n\nWhat kind of roles are you usually drawn to? What television shows do you watch?\n\nWell, I’m more into stories that are people. I’m not a big action blow em’ up type of stuff person. Those are not the movies that I gravitate to. I like smaller movies about relationships between people. So I would say, on TV, I don’t watch a lot of TV, but I would say Greys Anatomy would be great. Private Practice. Things that are more about people, I gravitate to.\n\nAre you more drawn to television or film? Or is it all based on how good the script is?\n\nWell, I’ve always favored TV because of my kids, and being a mom. I never really wanted to be away for three or four months at a time. And TV allows me to be home. That’s why I’ve always gravitated to it. But no, I would do films too. If it’s a great part, I’m in.\n\nSpeaking of your kids, you’re coming out with a new children’s book!\n\nIn October it’s coming out! But I’m really excited about it! It’s something that I’ve had in mind for a long time and I felt like there weren’t any books that spoke to kids of mixed races. And I mean, everybody’s mixed with something now. I’m living in two homes. It’s for kids who go back and forth. It’s from their point of view on going back and forth, but in a loving and beautiful way. It’s an adjustment for everybody to go back and forth like that.\n\nAbsolutely. How old are your two twin boys now?\n\nThey’re four!\n\nOh wow. You’re busy!\n\n[Laughs] I just flew back from Miami with them. Let me tell you, oh my God, I was exhausted!\n\nWas that for an early summer vacation?\n\nYeah, a little vacation, a little work. I hosted an event for a charity, for Haiti actually. My family’s there so I thought what a great way to bring the boys and have them hang out with their cousins and stuff. It was nice.\n\nIs the book something that could turn into a series?\n\nYou know what, we’re in talks. We’ll see what happens, you know? We’re planting seeds everywhere. So hopefully that may come somewhere down the line. So from your mouth to God’s ears.\n\nWhat are three passions in life you have besides acting?\n\nOh, number one my family. Number two would be, just when I say love, I mean being spiritual. I would say spirituality, spiritual. Loving–being loving. Coming from a good place and not spreading hate around. And I would say the third one would be leaving something behind for our kids. Leaving you know, clean land, fresh water. Just leaving a legacy behind for our kids that‘s good and clean.\n\nI’ve never heard that answer before. I like that.\n\nYay! Original answer, good!\n\n‘Vampire Diaries’ Exclusive: There’s A New Bonnie Coming To Town In Season 4\n\nBonnie Wright may not be in with the vampire crew (and may be the only one on the planet to not love the Salvatore brothers), but that doesn’t mean she didn’t have a huge part in leaving fans stunned at the end of the Vampire Diaries season three finale. Basically, Elena turned into a (spoiler!) vampire, she chose Stefan over Damon and Bonnie ultimately looked out for herself and resurrected Klaus. Or, put Klaus in Tyler’s body. OR, put Tyler in Klaus’s body. It all gets very confusing. In any case, during a recent conference call about Kat Graham’s new YouTube show AwesomenessTV, the actress revealed what’s up ahead for Bonnie in the fourth season.\n\n“I think that we’ll possibly show a side of her that’s more darker, a side that Bonnie might not even be ready to deal with. I mean you’ll probably see a dark Bonnie, but nothing is really promised in Vampire Diaries. I honestly don’t know where they’re going with her,” she reveals.\n\nDarker, yes. But anything can ultimately happen in Mystic Falls. “You’re gonna see a Bonnie that’s in more of a vulnerable place. She’s always kind of been vulnerable, but she’s gone through certain things that have made her that way. She’s gonna lose even more than she’s ever lost and she’s going to find a way to fill that hole. And it’s gonna be a little drama, but…”\n\nWait for it…\n\n“Fans have yet to see Bonnie in the way that they are going to see her in season 4.”\n\nFine by us, as long as those Salvatore brothers stay intact!\n\n‘Veep’ Star Sufe Bradshaw On Her Second Career Choice, What’s On Her iPod\n\nJust like every other year, HBO swept the Emmy nominations early Thursday morning when winning hopefuls were announced for the 2012 Primetime Emmys. Newcomer Girls struck big for the network alongside Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire and Curb Your Enthusiasm. But let’s not forget Veep. The political comedy got renewed after just a few episodes airing and rightfully so. The cast is fantastic and the banter is even better.\n\nRecently, Ology chatted with Sufe Bradshaw, who plays the no nonsense Sue, and she let us in on what her second career choice would be. “There’s really a part of me that would love to tell stories,” she reveals. “I like the idea of a reall good story. So writing for sure. It also goes along with poetry. It’s definitely something that’s always been in my life. I haven’t crossed over into the screen-writing place, but I just want to write stories. I like the expression of art.”\n\nThough she’s only in her first career now, at least Sufe can mirror the compelling and fast-paced writing the creators of Veep have created. After all, the whole cast is probably celebrating their Emmy nods right about now by meeting up at a huge Veep billboard near an L.A. highway. That’s at least what they did when they found out they were picked up for a second season.\n\nAs for what can be found on her iPod, Sufe definitely seems to have different taste compared to what Sue would enjoy. “Gotta have the Kanye West in there!” she laughs. “He’s awesome! I’m a big fan of John Mayer, too. I’m a big jazz girl. I listen to John Coltrane and Miles Davis too!”\n\nOkay, so maybe some Kanye is blasting while the crew raise a toast in celebration right about now too.\n\nVeep is nominated for Oustanding Comedy Series, Julia Louis-Dreyfus for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series.\n\nHBO leads all other networks and channels with 81 nominations. Production is underway for season two of the political comedy, and recognition for its outstanding work is sure to carry over in 2013.\n\n‘Vampire Diaries’ Exclusive: Don’t Expect Kat Graham’s Music To Be Featured In Mystic Falls\n\nSorry Kat Graham music lovers. The actress isn’t planning on having any of her own material appear on the fourth season of the Vampire Diaries. Granted, her songs may have only worked during electrifying vamp biting scenes and high school dances, but when we last chatted with Kat about the series we just couldn’t resist asking just in case.\n\n“I hope not unless Kat Graham, quote on quote, visits the Vampire Diaries.” she reveals. “I don’t think Bonnie could sing my music. I like scoring music for the actual soundtrack, which I’ve done in the past. I’m not really interested in singing my songs other than for myself, if that makes any sense, other than the character of Bonnie.”\n\nBut don’t be a witch about it fans. The series has already introduced us to some of the most repeat-worthy tunes:\n\n– Jason Walker, “Down”\n\n– Sanders Bohlke, “The Weight of Us”\n\n– Barcelona, “Come Back When You Come”\n\n– Placebo, “Running Up That Hill”\n\n– Ed Sheeran, “Give Me Love”\n\nThough her music won’t be appearing, Kat and the cast are severely missed (ahem, Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley) as they continue to film the show’s fourth season.\n\nThe actors are so talented, and their hardwork must have something to do with how they are behind the scenes. “I am very to myself before a scene. I don’t joke around,” Kat admits. “We have the set super quiet all the time. You can hear a pin drop on set. Other than that, I’m not much fun!”\n\nThough she says she’s not, we couldn’t disagree more!\n\n‘Vampire Diaries’ Exclusive: There’s A New Bonnie Coming To Town In Season 4\n\nBonnie Wright may not be in with the vampire crew (and may be the only one on the planet to not love the Salvatore brothers), but that doesn’t mean she didn’t have a huge part in leaving fans stunned at the end of the Vampire Diaries season three finale. Basically, Elena turned into a (spoiler!) vampire, she chose Stefan over Damon and Bonnie ultimately looked out for herself and resurrected Klaus. Or, put Klaus in Tyler’s body. OR, put Tyler in Klaus’s body. It all gets very confusing. In any case, during a recent conference call about Kat Graham’s new YouTube show AwesomenessTV, the actress revealed what’s up ahead for Bonnie in the fourth season.\n\n“I think that we’ll possibly show a side of her that’s more darker, a side that Bonnie might not even be ready to deal with. I mean you’ll probably see a dark Bonnie, but nothing is really promised in Vampire Diaries. I honestly don’t know where they’re going with her,” she reveals.\n\nDarker, yes. But anything can ultimately happen in Mystic Falls. “You’re gonna see a Bonnie that’s in more of a vulnerable place. She’s always kind of been vulnerable, but she’s gone through certain things that have made her that way. She’s gonna lose even more than she’s ever lost and she’s going to find a way to fill that hole. And it’s gonna be a little drama, but…”\n\nWait for it…\n\n“Fans have yet to see Bonnie in the way that they are going to see her in season 4.”\n\nFine by us, as long as those Salvatore brothers stay intact!\n\nKat Graham Interview: ‘Vampire Diaries’ Star Lands New YouTube Music Show\n\nDespite having a killer acting gig on the CW’s Vampire Diaries alongside Ian Somerhalder, Paul Wesley and Nina Dobrev, actress Kat Graham has also been keeping busy with her budding music career. The actress just premiered her very first single “Put Your Graffiti On Me” a few months back, and is now being featured in the new show AwesomenessTV. “Road To…” is a behind the scenes YouTube experience for fans to see what tour life is currently like for Graham when it comes to her journey into the music industry.\n\n“My style is a little crazy,” Kat admits to Ology. “I’ve always trying to like—I think I’m toning it down, but then I always wind up just kind of doing my own thing. My biggest style inspirations come from the 90s. I’m really inspired by TLC and I’m inspired by Janet Jackson and different designers like Jeremy Scott. I’m inspired by the drag queen scene, by the combat boots, the torn up jeans and baggy skirts. I love that look. I guess that’s kind of where I lie in terms of my own personal style.”\n\nKat’s fierce attitude certainly doesn’t go unnoticed when she takes the stage. Neither do her outfits that clearly show her creativity. “I love Kanye West and I’m really inspired by him a lot,” she adds. “He does something with men’s fashion, which rappers have done. Very few, like Pharrell, he’s done a lot. And MIA is huge too. People US Weekly just puts on their Fashion Police, but like not always on their cover.”\n\nFilming for season four of TVD is underway and singing has become a huge priority in Kat’s life. But what else is she passionate about? She loves animals, art and spirituality. “I’m passionate about animals. I could be a bit obsessive about art and artists. Like Renaissance artists, most particularly Leonardo da Vinci and the history of things; the background of them and the story behind it. I’m very passionate about the Renaissance era.”"
