        "text": "alexandra chando\n\nThe Lying Games has been our new addiction since it premiered this summer and we can't believe the fall finale is here! We're dying to know what will happen to Emma and Sutton - and which twin will end up with Ethan! To get the scoop on Monday night's finale and so much more, CG caught up with Emma/Sutton herself - Alexandra Chando - to get the scoop straight from the source!\n\nCosmogirl: What would you say is the most exciting thing to look forward to in the finale?\n\nAlexandra Chandro: Sutton and Emma reuniting! They haven't seen each other face to face since the first episode so it's really something to look forward to. Drama goes down!\n\nCG: What's hardest part about playing two characters?\n\nAC: It's gotten a lot easier, because I know them both really well. But I would say keeping them straight, because they each handle things differently. Whenever Sutton is thrown something emotional, I find it the most challenging. She definitely handles things a lot differently than Emma. That has proved to be one of the biggest challenges.\n\nCG: Do you have a preference of which twin you like to play more?\n\nAC: Well, I will say that in the finale I loved playing Sutton! She is back with a vengeance and she is so fun. There are also moments with Emma that I really enjoy, so both, but I would say in the finale: Sutton.\n\nCG: Who are you more like in real life, Sutton or Emma?\n\nAC: I would say Emma. She comes a little bit more naturally to me. There are qualities of Sutton that I have, as far as how she handles situations and her emotions, but for the most part I'm more like Emma.\n\nCG: What is the vibe on set like?\n\nAC: Well, we're definitely all very close and we're in Austin, so we sort of only have each other. We go out on weekends, and we hang out, which is fun. It's definitely a different experience than if we were filming in LA and we were all going back to our own friends and apartments and everything. That, for sure, has brought us together. It's just a really fun vibe on set.\n\nCG: Are there any on set romances?\n\nAC: There are a lot of hot guys on our show - we got very lucky! But no, no on set romances, just very good friends. Which is cool.\n\nCG: Speaking of hot guys, where do you see Emma and Ethan's relationship going?\n\nAC: I think that they're really good together. We didn't get to see a really big taste of what they could be and what they are because it's always been that pushing and pulling relationship and the resisting on Emma's part. You know, they were broken up for two episodes, so I think it would be kind of cool to have them together and be what they truly are like when they both give in, finally.\n\nCG: What's the worst lie you've ever told?\n\nAC: I try not to lie! I try to be as honest as I can be."
