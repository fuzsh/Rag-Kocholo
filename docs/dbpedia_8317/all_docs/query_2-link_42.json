The first video from the event features Alexandra Chando (Emma/Sutton) and Blair Redford (Ethan) talking about what’s coming up on THE LYING GAME when the show returns tonight, after PRETTY LITTLE LIARS, at 9/8c on ABC Fam (apologies for how loud the video is. I did my best to eliminate the background noise, but holy heavens, that was the loudest carpet I’ve EVER been on)!\n\nWill you be watching tonight? What would you love to see for Ethan and Emma or Ethan and Sutton or Emma and Sutton??"
