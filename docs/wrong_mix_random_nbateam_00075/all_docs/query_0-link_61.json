        "text": "Historical Notes\n\nSchwab's opened in 1932 when Philadelphia natives and brothers, Jack, Leon, Bernard and Martin Schwab, bought a failing pharmacy on the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards. The pharmacy was located just around the corner from several studios and the brothers set up their pharmacy to cater to the Hollywood crowd. Schwab's was more than just a place to fill prescriptions: there was a grocery store, a make-up counter (Gloria Swanson bought all her cosmetics there) and a restaurant that served all-American fare like hamburgers and meatloaf (Marlon Brando and Orson Welles were fans).*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\n1938 - Harold Arlen was working on a movie score for an upcoming film, The Wizard of Oz. He was having a difficult time composing a ballad for one particular scene. Ballads were usually love songs, but this scene was about a lonely farm girl longing for \"a place where there isn't any trouble,\" and it had him stumped. He decided to take a break from writing and catch a movie at Grauman's Theater with his wife, Anya. He sat in the passenger seat with Anya at the wheel. They turned onto Sunset Blvd, heading East, when suddenly he touched her arm and asked her to pull over. Anya parked the car under the neon sign of Schwab's Pharmacy, as Harold scribbled the melody that just came to him. He rushed inside to call his writing partner, Yip Harburg, from the Schwab's payphone.\n\n\"Yippers, can you meet me at my house in 10 minutes? I think I got a nugget.\"\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSidney Skolsky, a syndicated Hollywood gossip columnist for the New York Daily News who was the first journalist to use the nickname \"Oscar\" for the Academy Award in print, made Schwab's famous in the 1930s. He used the drugstore as his office, and called his column in Photoplay, the premiere movie magazine in the U.S. at the time, \"From A Stool At Schwab's\".\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the 1970s and early ’80s, a new set of celebrities began gracing the fountain with their presence, including Eric Estrada, Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone, Goldie Hawn and Jerry Brown. In 1980, Jack Schwab passed away at age 75, and after five decades of service, the Schwab’s on Sunset Boulevard closed down. Leon Schwab stated that the closure was due to family reasons, but the truth was that the company was in financial distress. In 1983, everything that was not bolted down, from the stools and counters to the pharmacy’s famous Rolodex, was auctioned off to the highest bidder. The large red-and-blue neon sign that hung over the front door sold for $650.*\n\nIt took the wrecking ball a couple of more years to knock down Schwab's, but in 1988 the building came down, making way for a large retail complex.Â\n\nThe Origins of Googie Architectrure\n\nAlan Hess, the author of Googie: Fifties Coffeeshop Architecture, traces Googie back to three Coffee Dan's restaurants designed by John Lautner in the early forties.\n\n\"He selected the vaults and glass walls and trusses and angles of his buildings to fit the original, often unusual, concepts of space he favored,\" writes Hess.\n\nLautner originated the style that would be refined and reinterpreted by many others. Unintentionally, he also gave the style a name when, in 1949, he designed Googie's Coffee Shop at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights in Los Angeles.\n\nProfessor Douglas Haskell of Yale was driving through Los Angeles when he and architectural photographer Julius Shulman came upon Googie's. \"Stop the car!\" Haskell yelled. \"This is Googie architecture.\" While Haskell was dubious about the style, he made the name \"Googie architecture\" stick by using it in a 1952 article in House and Home magazine.*\n\nThe Googie Look\n\nAlthough Googie buildings were often quite different from one another, Douglas Haskell noted that the style had certain rules:\n\n1. It can look organic, but it must be abstract. \"If it looks like a bird, it must be a geometric bird. It's better yet if the house had more than one theme: like an abstract mushroom surmounted by an abstract bird.\"\n\n2. Ignore gravity altogether. \"Whenever possible, the building must hang from the sky.\"\n\n3. Multiple structural elements. Inclusion is the rule, rather than minimalism. New materials, including sheet glass, glass blocks, asbestos, plywood and plastic gave the architect a whole new palette to work with. Other innovations allowed steel and cement to be used in new ways. Suddenly, architects had more elbowroom for their dreams. A room made of plastic could look like a log cabin, a space ship, or almost anything.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWest Hollywood, colloquially referred to as WeHo, was incorporated in 1984 and is home to the famous Sunset Strip.Â The irregular boundary of the town is featured in the city logo, and was largely formed from the unincorporated area that had not become part of the surrounding cities (Los Angeles and Beverly Hills).*^\n\nWest Hollywood owes its existence to one of Southern California's first interurban electric railways, the Pasadena and Pacific. Assembled by Moses H. Sherman and his brother-in-law Eli P. Clark from failed and fragmentary predecessors, the Pasadena and Pacific connected the booming city of Los Angeles with the beach town of Santa Monica. Along the way, it crossed a sprawling coastal plain dotted with marshes, tar pits, and citrus groves. Today's Santa Monica Boulevard traces the railway's route across what was then called the Cahuenga Valley.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nDuring the final decade years of the nineteenth century, the first large land development in what would later become West Hollywoodâthe town of \"Sherman\"âwas established by Moses Sherman and his partners of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, an interurban railroad line which later became part of the Pacific Electric Railway system. Sherman became the location of the railroad's main shops, railroad yards, and \"car barns\". Many working-class employees of the railroad settled in this town.Â It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated, liquor-friendly (during Prohibition) place for eccentric people wary of government interference.\n\nFor years, farms and open fields separated the town of Sherman from the neighboring communities of Colegrove and Hollywood (an independent city from 1903 to 1910). Though connected by the tracks of the Pasadena and Pacificâlater bounded on each side by paved roadways for motor cars and named Santa Monica Boulevardâit was not until the early 1920s that the growing Los Angeles metropolis met the street grid of Sherman. ^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFor many years, the area that is now the city of West Hollywood was an unincorporated area in the midst of Los Angeles. Because gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but still legal in Los Angeles County, the 1920s saw the proliferation of many casinos, night clubs, etc., along Sunset Boulevard (which starts in downtown Los Angeles and runs westward). These businesses were immune from the sometimes heavy-handed law-enforcement of the L.A. Police Department.\n\nIn 1925, In a controversial decision, Sherman adopted \"West Hollywood\", \"...a moniker pioneered earlier in the decade by the West Hollywood Realty Board\" as its informal name, though it remained under the governance of Los Angeles County.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nBeginning in 1922, Sherman's population boomed. As the town's development began to merge with that of Hollywood, by then a part of the City of Los Angeles, some in both Sherman and the metropolis began speaking of annexation.\n\nLos Angeles promptly annexed several large but mostly vacant tracts surrounding Sherman; the 1,203-acre Fairfax district became part of Los Angeles with the unanimous approval of its 16 residents, and a 7-0 vote joined the 430-acre Melrose district with L.A.\n\nL.A. easily incorporated these vast tracts into its city limits without contention, but Sherman was an established community with an independent identity, and the issue of annexation divided Sherman's population and business interests. Realtors supported it, arguing that future development depended on access to Los Angeles' sewer and fire protection services. Sherman's Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce opposed joining the city, however, fearful of increased property taxes.\n\nUltimately the anti-annexationist forces prevailed. Instead of relying on L.A.'s utility connections and public services, Sherman financed construction of its own sewer system and relied upon the county for police and fire protection services. ^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe tracks running down the center of Santa Monica Boulevard became part of the Pacific Electric Railway in 1911 and carried red cars until 1954. They then remained largely unused for decades, serving the occasional Southern Pacific freight train through the 1970s. It was not until 1999 that the West Hollywood segment of the tracks were dug up and replaced by a landscaped median.^\n\nClick HERE to see same view in 2016.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWhen United Artists was formed in 1919 byÂ Charlie Chaplin,Â Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, andÂ D. W. Griffith, the founders never intended the company to be like a regular Hollywood studio. It started solely as a distribution company. Its mission was to release films made by independent producers, therefore it had no studio lot. However, many of the independent producers owned their own property, like theÂ Charlie Chaplin Studio on Sunset Boulevard.Â The closest thing to a studio lot was the property owned by Pickford and Fairbanks on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Formosa Avenue in Hollywood. The studio lot's address is now 1041 North Formosa Avenue.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe 18-acre property on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Formosa Avenue was originally owned by Jesse Durham Hampton, and then became known as the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio. As United Artists began to lure independent producers away from the major studios, many of the producers like Samuel Goldwyn and Joseph Schenck rented offices and stages on the property. In the early 1920s, the lot was renamed the United Artists Studio, though it was operated as a separate entity from United Artists the distribution company.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAfter Douglas Fairbanks died in 1939, leaving his share of the deed to Mary Pickford, Goldwyn sought to rename the lot \"Samuel Goldwyn Studio.\" Pickford and Goldwyn fought over the name and ownership of the property until a court ordered that the lot be auctioned in 1955.\n\nJames Mulvey, Goldwyn's most trusted business confidant and president of Samuel Goldwyn Inc., outbid Pickford for the property. The lot officially became Samuel Goldwyn Studio and remained so until Warner Brothers purchased the site in 1980.^\n\nWarner Bros. sold the studio lot in 1999 and the name of this studio lot was changed to \"The Lot.\"\n\nAcross the street is the Formosa Cafe, a legendary Hollywood hangout.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn Feb , 2022 the iconic Tower Records building was demolished.\n\nHere's the Tower building (8801 Sunset Blvd) history timeline\n\nâ¢ 1928 - 1935 Magnetic Service Station (Venetian Studio - antique furniture adjacent on west side at 8811 Sunset)\n\nâ¢ 1935: Simon’s Drive-in opens\n\nâ¢ 1945: Dolores Drive-In opens\n\nâ¢ 1952: Jack’s on the Strip drive-in opens.

Before that it was known as the St. James Club and Hotel, a grand 13 story, the Strip's 1st high-rise (built in 1931), and one of Hollywood 's best examples of Art Deco design. Virtually every star in Hollywood stayed here at one time or another. It was a favorite of Howard Hughes, who kept a number of suites here fore his various girlfriends; other guest included Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and John Wayne (who is said to have kept a cow on the balcony outside his penthouse suite for fresh milk).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSunset Boulevard, a long winding thoroughfare that begins in downtown Los Angeles and runs westward over 20 miles, ends at the Pacific Ocean near Malibu. The best-known portion of the boulevard is the mile and a half stretch between Hollywood and Beverly Hills, known as \"The Sunset Strip\".*\n\nThe Chateau Marmont Hotel was a great castle on the hill inspired by the architecture of the Loire Valley in France was built in 1927, opened in 1929 as an apartment house, and was changed to a hotel in 1931, becoming the \"Hotel to the Stars\".*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1940 Preston Sturges, successful Hollywood writer and director, opened Players Nightclub. Stars and writers made it their home base. Humphrey Bogart, Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman (writer of several Marx Brothers movies), and Donald Ogden Stewart (screenwriter of 1938âs Marie Antoinette and 1940âs The Philadelphia Story) all got smashed on The Playersâ drinks, which were said to be the most potent in town.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck (Sturgesâ leading lady in The Lady Eve), Orson Welles (who stayed next door at the Chateau Marmont when he first came to Hollywood), Joel McCrea (who starred in three of Sturgesâ pictures), Rudy Vallee, director William Wyler, and writer William Faulkner were all regulars at their friendâs establishment. Multi-millionaire Howard Hughes became a regular guest. He often dined on the top floor, frequently preferring to eat alone.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1926 Fred Horowitz, a prominent Los Angeles attorney, chose the site at Marmont Lane and Sunset Boulevard to construct an apartment building. Horowitz had recently traveled to Europe for inspiration and returned to California with photos of a Gothic Chateau along the Loire River. In 1927 Horowitz commissioned his brother-in-law, European-trained architect Arnold A. Weitzman, to design the seven-story, L-shaped building based on his French photos. When deciding upon a name for the building, Chateau Sunset and Chateau Hollywood were rejected in favor of Chateau Marmont, a name conceived by the small street running across the front of the property.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOn February 1, 1929, Chateau Marmont opened its doors to the public as the newest residence of Hollywood. Local newspapers described the Chateau as “Los Angeles’s newest, finest and most exclusive apartment house ... superbly situated, close enough to active businesses to be accessible and far enough away to insure quiet and privacy.”\n\nDue to the high rents and inability to keep tenants for long-term commitments during the depression, Fred Horowitz chose to sell the apartment building to Albert E. Smith for $750,000 in cash. The following year, Chateau Marmont was converted into a hotel. The apartments became suites with kitchens and living rooms. The property was also refurbished with antiques from depression-era estate sales.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWith its external appearance of a castle or Gothic fort, combined with its residential past, incredibly thick walls, discreet entry, and highly protective staff who treated guests like members of the family, the Chateau Marmont became the ideal hideout.\n\nEuropean guests found the architecture familiar and comforting, sexual outsiders felt accepted, the emotionally shy were shielded, and anyone else with a reason to hide simply blended into the woodworkâfrom the start there was the feeling of a shared sensibility. Greta Garbo felt comfortable here, as did Howard Hughes.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nMembers of Led Zeppelin rode their motorcycles through the lobby in the 1960s.\n\nOn March 5, 1982, comedian John Belushi died from a speedball injection in Bungalow No. 3.\n\nOn January 23, 2004, photographer Helmut Newton, who lived at the hotel, lost control of his Cadillac and crashed into the driveway wall. He was killed.\n\nThere is a commonly-denied and non-denied story that Benicio Del Toro and Scarlett Johansson hooked up in the elevator the night before the 2004 Oscars.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nCiro's (later known as Ciro's Le Disc) was a nightclub in West Hollywood located at 8433 Sunset Boulevard, on the Sunset Strip. It opened in January 1940 by entrepreneur William Wilkerson. Herman Hover took over management of Ciro's in 1942 until it closed its doors in 1957.\n\nCo-founder Wilkerson also opened Cafe Trocadero, in 1934, and the restaurant La Rue, both on the Strip, and later originated The Flamingo in Las Vegas, only to have control of the resort wrested from his control by mobster Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the 1960s, Ciro's became a Sunset Strip rock and roll club, and was the only major venue on the Strip to make such a transition while keeping its original name. The Byrds got their start there in 1964. Accounts of the period (reproduced in the sleeve notes to The Preflyte Sessions box set) describe a \"church-like\" atmosphere, with interpretive dancing. The club also served as the host during the recording of the 1965 Dick Dale album \"Rock Out With Dick Dale: Live At Ciro's\"\n\nThe site of Ciro's became Art Laboe's circa 1970 and the The Comedy Store in 1972.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Comedy Store was opened in April 1972 by comedians Sammy Shore and Rudy DeLuca. The building was formerly the home of Ciro's, a popular Hollywood nightclub owned by William Wilkerson, and later a rock and roll venue, where The Byrds were discovered in 1964.\n\nWhen the venue reopened as The Comedy Store in 1972, it included a 99-seat theatre, where Johnny Carson was one of the first comics to perform. As a result of a divorce settlement, Sammy Shore's ex-wife Mitzi Shore began operating the club in 1973, and she was able to buy the building in 1976. She immediately renovated and expanded the club to include a 450-seat main room.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Comedy Store has featured performances from every important comedian. The names of its headliners are vaunted on its outside walls.\n\nThis was once the site of Ciro’s, one of Hollywood’s most popular nightclubs during the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe building is supposedly haunted. TV’s “Access Hollywood” once brought in a psychic, billed her as a “spiritual journalist,” and had her talk about angry mobsters still supposedly trapped in the building’s basement. ^^+\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Mocambo opened on January 3, 1941, and became an immediate success. It was owned by Charlie Morrison and Felix Young.Â The club's Latin American-themed decor designed by Tony Duquette cost $100,000 (equivalent to $1,663,801 in 2017). Along the walls were glass cages holding live cockatoos, macaws, seagulls, pigeons, and parrots. With big band music, the club became one of the most popular dance-till-dawn spots in town. On any given night, one might find the room filled with the leading men and women of the motion picture industry.\n\nIn 1943, when Frank Sinatra became a solo act, he made his Los Angeles debut at the Mocambo.\n\nOn March 15, 1955 Ella Fitzgerald opened at the Mocambo, after Marilyn Monroe lobbied the owner for the booking. The booking was instrumental in Fitzgerald's career. The incident was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer in 2005.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAmong the many celebrities who frequented the Mocambo were Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Errol Flynn, Charlie Chaplin, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Henry Fonda, Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, Bob Hope, James Cagney, Sophia Loren, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, Grace Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, Howard Hughes, Kay Francis, Marlene Dietrich, Theda Bara, Tyrone Power, Jayne Mansfield, John Wayne, Ben Blue, Ann Sothern, and Louis B. Mayer. Myrna Loy and Arthur Hornblow, Jr. celebrated their divorce there.\n\nThe club's main stage was replicated on the TV series I Love Lucy as the \"Tropicana\" Club. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were frequent guests at the Mocambo and were close friends of Charlie Morrison.\n\nEarly in 1957, club operator and co-owner Charlie Morrison died at his Beverly Hills home. The Mocambo remained in business for one final year, before closing its doors on June 30, 1958. The building was then sold, reopened as a supper club called The Cloister, and eventually demolished.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\n*Eddie Cantor, born Edward Israel Iskowitz, was a comedian, dancer, singer, actor, and songwriter.Â He is also known for being the second president of the Screen Actors Guild, serving from 1933 to 1935. He invented the title \"The March of Dimes\" for the donation campaigns of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was organized to combat polio. It was a play on the The March of Time newsreels popular at the time. He began the first campaign on his radio show in January 1938, asking listeners to mail a dime to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At that time, Roosevelt was the most notable American victim of polio. Other entertainers joined in the appeal via their own shows, and the White House mail room was deluged with 2,680,000 dimesâa large sum at the time.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Hacienda Park Apartments (renamed Coronet Apartments in late 1930s) was built in 1927 and operated initially as a luxury apartment building catering to the entertainment business. In the 1930s, it became the \"most famous brothel in California.\" Â The building declined in prestige in the 1950s and 1960 and was acquired by rock star Rod Stewart in the 1970s. After Stewart's plans to redevelop the building as a luxury hotel ended in a legal dispute, the building was nearly destroyed in a 1983 fire that was found to be of suspicious origin. Since 1986, it has been known as the Piazza del Sol, and it now houses the offices of several production companies, including Miramax Films. The restaurant Katana, co-owned by Ryan Seacrest and Tori Spelling and described by Newsweek as \"so hip it hurts,\" also operates at the building.*^\n\nA check of the Piazza del Sol’s listing in the National Register reveals a quirk in the record. The Register shows its original name as Hacienda Arms Apartments, not the Hacienda Park Apartments â a name that in 1927 connected the building to the neighborhood around it, Hacienda Park. It’s by no means a fatal error, and the rest of the information appears to be correct, but this small mistake has been magnified over the years â picked up and repeated in dozens of articles and books, including, for example, the headline of the building’s Wikipedia page.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWil Wright’s was a chain of ice cream parlors that dotted the Southern California landscape up until the mid-seventies.Â In addition to the West Hollywood location, they could be found in Beverly Hills (corner of Beverly Drive and Charleville), Westwood Village (corner of Glendon and Lindbrook), Pacific Palisades (San Vicente), Sherman Oaks (corner of Ventura and Van Nuys Blvd). They were the perfect place to take a date after the movie.Â The delicate pink and red decor and little marble tables and wire-frame chairs made you feel like you were seated inside a Valentine’s Day card.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFlorence Nightingale Graham (1878 â 1966), who went by the business name Elizabeth Arden, was a Canadian American businesswoman who founded what is now Elizabeth Arden, Inc., and built a cosmetics empire in the United States. By 1929 she owned 150 upscale salons across the United States and Europe. Her 1000 products were found in the luxury market in 22 countries. She was the sole owner, and at the peak of her career, she was one of the wealthiest women in the world.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nPupi’s, which opened in the mid- to late 1950s, sat on the south side of the Sunset Strip, in the historically upscale portion known as Sunset Plaza. It had a striped awning over sidewalk tables, but the little flagstone patio was the real attraction, along with some Perspex that blocked the wind coming up from the great sweep that separated its patrons from the wider Los Angeles Basin below.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThis restaurant was originally called the Mermaid Cafe built in the late 1920's. In 1933 it premiered as The Villa Nova and taken over by film director Vincente Minnelli and silent film actor-director Allen Dale.\n\nMarilyn Monroe went on her first blind date with Joe DiMaggio here in 1953 and Vincent proposed to Judy Garland at the Villa Nova in 1945. When Elmer Valentine, Lou Adler and Mario Maglieri took it over in 1972, they originally wanted to call it \"Over The Rainbow\" in their honor - but the city would not allow the sign to reach a certain height, so they shortened it to, \"The Rainbow\".*^^*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Rainbow became known as a hangout for rock musicians and their groupies. Notable regulars at the Rainbow in this period include Keith Moon, Alice Cooper, Micky Dolenz, Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Neil Diamond. Elvis Presley was known to have occasionally visited the Rainbow. The group of musicians calling themselves the Hollywood Vampires made the Rainbow their home away from home in the mid-1970s. In the last two decades of his life, MotÃ¶rhead frontman Lemmy was a daily fixture at the Rainbow whenever the band was not on tour, and often played a video poker machine at the end of the bar table.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Roxy was opened on September 23, 1973, by Elmer Valentine and Lou Adler, along with original partners David Geffen, Elliot Roberts and Peter Asher. They took over the building previously occupied by a strip club owned by Chuck Landis called the Largo. (Adler was also responsible for bringing the stage play The Rocky Horror Show to the United States, and it opened its first American run at The Roxy Theatre in 1974, before it was made into the movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show the next year. *^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nNeil Young and his band The Santa Monica Flyers played the Roxy for the first week it was open. Only three months later, the original Genesis lineup with Peter Gabriel played several consecutive days at the Roxy, a run that some band members and many fans consider to be amongst their finest performances (due partially to the intimate atmosphere and good acoustics of the venue, as well as the legendary reputation of \"Hollywood\" amongst performers around the world).\n\nPaul Reubens, then a struggling comedian, introduced his Pee-wee Herman character in a raunchy revue here in 1981 that included other aspiring comics including Phil Hartman and Elayne Boosler. *^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe original Dolores Diner is behind the building. Muntz used that space for his car stereo installations. This building was originally built as a model used to sell the condos in the Shoreham building in 1961. Budget Rent-A-Car took it over, and then Muntz added that framing extenstion on the west side of the building.\n\nThe above building was a music store and showroom for \"Madman\" Muntz's Stereo Paks, the first successful car stereo system \"and a popular hangout for teenagers in the '60s.\" (In addition to inventing 4-tracks, Muntz popularized the nickname \"TV\" for television.\n\nTower Records moved into the building in 1971.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nDuring the 1940s Sherry’s was popular with L.A.’s mafia element. On July 20, 1949 gangster Mickey Cohen and 3 others were ambushed at 3:45 a.m. in front of the restaurant on the Sunset Strip. Mickey's car drove up to the curb and gunmen (hiding across the street under an advertising sign â out of view) opened fire with shotguns. The gunmen then sped away in a gray auto, tossing out the guns a block away. Mickey was the least seriously wounded.*#\n\nSherry’s later became the famous rock club Gazzari’s on the Strip.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nGazzarri's reached its peak of popularity in the late 1960s, featuring Jim Morrison's young new group, along with other LA talent such as The Bobby Fuller Four, Buffalo Springfield, and The Walker Brothers. It then achieved major LA relevance again in the late 70's, featuring the David Lee Roth-led Van Halen nightly for months on end, and then into the 1980s thru the early 90's as one of the top LA glam metal nightclubs. It was owned and operated by the \"Godfather of Rock and Roll\", Bill Gazzarri. Gazzarri himself was known for dressing up as a Chicago-style gangster and frequenting the club on performance nights. Located near the corner of Doheny and Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, and just several dozen yards from both the Rainbow Bar and Grill and The Roxy Theatre, Gazzarri's became famous as a launching pad for future rock and roll stars.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe restaurant was run by a black woman named Louise Brooks but owned by Phil Selznick, who was David O. Selznick’s uncle. He also took over the It CafÃ© on Vine Street from Clara Bow, and Club Versailles at 8590 Sunset, which was rumored to be a front for Bugsy Siegel and later became Mocambo. Something dodgy was going on because Mammy Louise’s Bayou was raided in the fall of 1938 and subsequently went under. Its next incarnation was an upscale lesbian bar called Cafe Internationale.Â\n\nToday the building, after a major renovation, has been converted into a furniture store.Â Click HERE for contemporary view.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Finlandia Baths were downstairs in the basement of the Crosby Building where a virtual who's who of closeted gay and straight male stars went for a bake or to rub the kinks out or have them rubbed out, as the case may be. Regulars apparently included Kirk Douglas, Cornel Wilde, Humphrey Bogart, Tony Curtis, Hugh O'Brien, Rock Hudson and the Crosby brothers and many others. The building is still there albeit somewhat folded, spindled and mutilated but the bones are still good and still visible. Finlandia Baths have predictably morphed into a tattoo parlor."
