It is now called âClarke Orbitâ in his honour.\n\nAsteroid 4923 Clarke\n\nDiscovered in March 1981, this minor planet goes around the Sun in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. So named by International Astronomical Union (IAU) to honour Arthur C Clarke.\n\n\"Two possibilities exist:\n\neither we are alone\n\nin the Universe\n\nor we are not.\n\nBoth are equally terrifying.\n\n- Arthur C Clarke\n\nArthur C Clarke\n\nOfficial Website\n\nArthur C Clarke (1917 - 2008) was an author, undersea explorer, science populariser and so much more. He first proposed the communications satellites and promoted space travel. His science fiction and TV shows have sparked the imagination of millions worldwide.\n\nSir Arthur C Clarke:\n\nBrief Biography\n\n\"The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.\"\n\nArthur C Clarke\n\nSir Arthur C Clarke:\n\n90th Birthday Reflections\n\nâHow inappropriate to\n\ncall this planet âEarthâ\n\nwhen it is clearly âOceanâ.â\n\n- Arthur C Clarke"
