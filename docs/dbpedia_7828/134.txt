Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has dropped her new surname.

The singer will now be referred to as Cheryl, because she claims people are having difficulties pronouncing her married name, reports The Sunday People.

She explained: "It's just Cheryl because everyone seems to be having a hard time saying it."

Cheryl married boyfriend Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini last month (July 7) in a private ceremony on the island of Mustique after three months of dating.

She revealed news of the marriage by posting a picture of her wedding ring on Instagram, which has been valued between Â£200,000 and Â£300,000.

Cheryl will return as a judge on The X Factor next month, alongside Simon Cowell, Mel B and Louis Walsh.
