        "text": "The X Factor judge, formerly Cheryl Cole, married 33-year-old French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini last month.\n\n“Everyone is having a hard time saying it,” she revealed and ­suggested: “Just say Cheryl.”\n\nX Factor boss Simon Cowell admitted her new name was a mouthful, agreeing: “We just have to call her Cheryl, like Madonna.”\n\nThe singer, 31, is back after a four-year absence from the ITV show which returns later this month and her latest single, Crazy Stupid Love, has topped the UK charts.\n\nShe said of fellow judge Cowell: “The second I sat down it was like we have never been apart.\n\n“I am the happiest I have ever been. It’s been an amazing week, an amazing year. I’m thrilled my record went to number one and I’m glad I’m back.” Cheryl warned she and Simon could still be at loggerheads when it comes to judging. “I am going to be honest in how I feel in a way that is not offensive.\n\n“I think it is important when someone comes with a dream and you don’t just cut them. Simon can.\n\n“It’s fair to be truthful but there is a way of saying the same thing in a different way.”\n\nCowell joked about her wedding: “I’m surprised she’s found anyone to take her on full time because she’s high maintenance.”\n\nHe added: “I’m selling babies to her. She is fantastic with Eric [Simon’s baby]. I wouldn’t be ­surprised if she is next.”\n\nCowell admitted: “Cheryl is so easy to wind up. I’ve been teasing her a little bit about her marriage. I’m happy for her. She sent me a text on the day it happened. It said, ‘Are you sitting down? I’ve got married’.”\n\nThe music mogul also suggested he had a role for former judge Tulisa Contostavlos after she was caught up in a drugs scandal and convicted of assaulting a celebrity blogger. “She deserves a break,” he said."
