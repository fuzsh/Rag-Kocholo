        "text": "10 months ago\n\nKelly Brook has been named the riskiest celebrity to search for online as part of a study into computer viruses and how hackers entice users to dangerous websites.\n\nThe model and TV personality was found to be the most dangerous search term by Intel Security, which carried out the research.\n\nThe report looked at the most famous people in popular culture, and analysed how many search results linked to them actually led to websites containing malicious software and viruses.\n\nKatie Price was second on the list, with new X Factor judge Nick Grimshaw third.\n\nFellow X Factor judge Rita Ora was fourth on the list, which was last year topped by another judge from the ITV talent show, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who dropped to 18th this year.\n\nIntel Security’s Nick Viney said: “The desire for consumers to have access to the latest celebrity gossip can often make them vulnerable to cybercrime.\n\n“Most consumers are unaware of the potential risks they are exposing themselves to by clicking on sites that provide them with the latest news and entertainment. But cyber-criminals are quick to exploit this desire for breaking celebrity news, leading consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices and steal their private data.”\n\nVictoria Beckham was fifth on the list, just ahead of Kate Middleton, while Idris Elba, Frank Lampard, Jeremy Clarkson and Tom Hardy completed the top 10.\n\nAs well as publishing the list, Intel Security also offered advice to web users about searching for celebrities in order to find out the latest news about them. This included a warning to not click on links from third-party sources, instead using only official websites in order to prevent potential cyber attacks.\n\n« Return to Tech"
