        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is firmly in the limelight once again with a new, natural beauty look having gone \"all back to basics\". Alongside her busy X Factor schedule she recently revealed the third addition to her fragrance success story; StormFlower Noir. Cosmo's Online Beauty Editor Bridget met the pop icon to talk perfume (of course), overcoming bad brows and why she now lives by the beauty philosophy \"less is more\".\n\nScroll down for the video.\n\n1. \"I bathe in my fragrance. 25 pumps each time. I apply it literally everywhere and I let it fall onto my body.\"\n\n2. \"I had a teenage fragrance called Red Jeans by Versace. You used to buy it in a tin and I wore that all the way through high school, so if I smell that again today it takes me all the way back to then.\"\n\n3. \"I can't stand when men seem like they bathe in their aftershave. A guy walks past you, and you're like 'Really? Did you put on enough aftershave?!' I like it to be a bit more discreet on a guy, more unisex – I hate overpowering smells on women too. If it's too 'in your face' I don't like it. Simon [Cowell] uses this lime fragrance. He puts loads on his hands and puts on his face and around his white t-shirt and it's a very distinctive smell. It's very fresh and limey.\"\n\n4. \"I don't let anybody near my eyebrows. I've had too many bad experiences with threading, waxing. At one point I tried to pluck my own eyebrows like Marilyn Monroe – and I'm not talking that long ago. Why I thought I could achieve that is beyond me. So now I just let them grow and take away the strays with tweezers.\"\n\nCheryl at the launch of her new perfume\n\n5. \"For night-time lipstick I go for a colour. Like my [L'Oreal Paris lipstick] Color Riche which is Red Passion or a nude colour in the daytime called Greige – that's what I've got on now.\"\n\n6. \"Because I'm olive skin toned I have to be really careful with beige colours on my lips. I can look washed out, or if I use something with too much of a yellow pigment it looks like I don't have lips! So I have to be really careful with the colour 'nude' I use.\"\n\n7. \"The beauty secret I wish I'd known when I was younger is SPF. I used to bake – I was a bit of a sun worshipper. I used to put on no factor, or an oil that enhanced the tan rather than prevented one, so I wish somebody had have told me that you can still get a nice glow but with protection also. I wear factor 30 now.\"\n\n8. \"I am comfortable with no makeup on. I think the more experience you have with it the more comfortable you become.\"\n\n9. \"Less is more. I've got a lot of nieces and nephews so I remember that hormone changes can affect your skin so if you might not want to go out makeup-free (although I'd advise it as it allows your skin to breath) I would say go for more of a light coverage like a tinted moisturiser. A lot of younger women seem to think they need to put loads and loads of makeup on but really it should be the opposite.\"\n\n10. \"Contouring can look ridiculous. It's better for a rounder face to give it more definition, whereas if you already have strong bone structure you can look a bit ridiculous.\"\n\n11. \"I do have [contouring] tricks but I only use them when I feel like I need to. It depends on the outfit – if it's is a masculine look like a blazer or something structured then I tend to go for the chiselled look, but in everyday life or if I'm wearing a girly dress or jeans and a t-shirt then no contouring. I have quite strong bone structure so I don't really need that much.\"\n\n12. \"I've always played with the length of my hair and I'm very spontaneous. People tend to think that I plan these things but I don't, there might be a day when I think 'do you know what? Cut it off, I've had enough!' – so [my bob] was one of those. I hadn't had it that short for so many years it was actually nice.\"\n\n13. \"The problem is you tend to think 'less hair, less maintenance' but it's SO not true! When you've got longer hair you can just put it in a top knot and still look cool but you always have to dry it or style it when it's short otherwise mine takes on a life of its own. I wake up in the morning like Mr Majeika!\"\n\n14. \"This is my natural hair colour. Yes, all back to basics.\"\n\n15. \"I did whiten my teeth years ago. Don't go too crazy; it can look ridiculous if your teeth are crazy white. I won't mention any names (!!!) but it can look slightly odd.\"\n\n16. \"I am a massive tea drinker. In the morning I have a coffee to wake up but I'm a massive tea drinker – I'm from the north!\"\n\n17. \"I have heard a straw is a better way for your teeth to handle coffee. But it's a really odd sensation and it doesn't taste good! So I drink a hot drink normally but I drink a cold drink with a straw.\"\n\n18. \"I eat a lot of avocado, it's really good for your skin. And a lot of nuts, almonds. Blueberries are also really good for your skin. And I drink water like it's going out of fashion.\""
