        "text": "There was much talk about the divorce of her second marriage. And it looks like Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is following in the footsteps of Madonna and Adele, Cheryl will be changing her name. The 32-year-old is planning to change her name as she goes through her divorce from French businessman Jean-Bernard.\n\nCheryl and Jean-Bernard married in 2014, 4 years after her divorce from English footballer Ashley Cole. It was precisely this last name, that the singer became famous by publishing the first hits like \"Fight for this love\" in 2009. Only 1 year later, she would be separated from the footballer, but was again known by his last name, although for a while she kept her last name: Cheryl Ann Tweedy.\n\nHer private life seems to have been far from peaceful; Cheryl has not denied the words that while she is legally married to the entrepreneur, she is experiencing a relationship with the member of \"One Direction\", Liam Payne. On her Instagram, the singer has published photos with the latter.\n\nAfter completing her final season as a member of the British X Factor jury, Cheryl has decided to focus on music. She is working to bring new projects, which will now bear only her name: Cheryl."
