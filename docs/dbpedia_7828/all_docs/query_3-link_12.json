        "text": "She's one of the nation's sweethearts but Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has said that life could have turned out a very different way, had it not been her passion for dancing. The former Girls Aloud singer revealed that attending dance classes regularly as a little girl saved her from a life on the streets.\n\n\"It's so important that when you're younger you have something that you're disciplined in, something you enjoy,\" said Cheryl, who started dancing at the age of three.\n\n\"I could have ended up in prison,\" Cheryl Fernandez-Versini admitted\n\n\"It sets you up for the rest of your life. If I didn't have this and I wasn't lucky enough to come to dance classes, and have that discipline instilled in me, I could have gone any route,\" she added. \"I could have ended up in prison – any route could have happened had I not had this opportunity.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old pop star was speaking to fellow Geordies Ant and Dec for their documentary, When Ant & Dec Met The Prince: 40 Years of The Prince's Trust. The presenters, who rose to fame on Byker Grove, admitted that the same could have happened to them.\n\nSpeaking about how he got his lucky break for the children's TV show at the age of 13, Ant said: \"Lord knows what would have happened, probably the same route. You don't know.\"\n\n\"I think I was always gonna be alright,\" joked Dec.\n\n\"It's so important that when you're younger you have something that you're disciplined in,\" said the singer\n\nThe comedy duo have once again teamed up to present their special ITV show, which airs on Monday night. The one-off documentary is a celebration of Prince Charles' youth charity The Prince's Trust and as an ambassador of the organisation, Cheryl was more than happy to appear in it.\n\nThe X Factor judge has set up two charities in collaboration with The Prince's Trust – The Cheryl Cole Foundation and Cheryl's Trust – both of which donate funds to the royal charity.\n\nCheryl admitted that she was \"happy to see the back of\" 2015\n\nApart from seeing her on TV, fans can also expect new music from the Crazy Stupid Love songstress. Cheryl recently took to Instagram to tell fans that she was heading to the studio."
