        "text": "Cheryl Tweedy's ex-husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini insists he doesn't even think about his former wife anymore.\n\nThe restaurateur says he has moved on from the X Factor star, who he spent just 18 months with.\n\nHe said: “I’ve lost a lot. I don’t have my parents, I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m alone now.\n\n“I married someone who was famous, I was thrust into this mad world – I didn’t like it.\n\n“There was really awful things said about me, about my family, but I feel like I survived it. And I’m here surviving, doing my thing.”\n\nJean-Bernard wed the former Girls Aloud star 12 weeks after they met at a party in 2014. They split in 2015.\n\nHe said: “It’s been two years – I feel like a different person. That was the old me.”\n\nCheryl went on to find love with One Direction singer Liam Payne, 23. Their baby son, Bear, was born in March.\n\nAdmitting he would like children himself, Jean-Bernard said: “If someone I used to be with goes on to have another boyfriend or have children, that’s good for them, I wish them well – but I’m not going to think about it.\n\n“When I’m not with someone I don’t think about them. Right now I’m focused on work.”\n\nThe businessman has opened a pop-up restaurant in Cannes, named Versini in tribute to his late mother.\n\nIt has attracted stars including Eva Longoria and Naomi Campbell – in town for the French resort’s film festival.\n\nOccupying the roof of a five-star hotel, the restaurant is a blueprint for a permanent venture in London.\n\nJean-Bernard said: “I’ve learned about being alone and having to do things on my own.\n\n“I’m in love with my restaurant. I’ve married it, I’m sleeping with it, I’m living it.\n\n“I lost my mum and I wanted to carry on her name – that was the most important thing for me.”"
