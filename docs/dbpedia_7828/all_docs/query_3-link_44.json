        "text": "Recent reports out of the UK have alleged that the British superstar and teen heart-throb are in a “secret relationship”.\n\nA friend of the duo chatted to The Sun, telling the publication the shock coupling is “the real deal.”\n\nApparently the 22-year-old has told friends he is “madly in love” with the former Girls Aloud star and he’s got the ink to prove it.\n\nThe 32-year-old is well known for her infamous rose tattoos on her bottom, and the 1D singer decided to get a matching one on his hand.\n\nCheryl is in the midst of a divorce after she ended her whirlwind marriage with her husband of 19 months, Jean-Bernard Fernandez Versini.\n\nIt’s believed Liam and the X Factor judge have been dating since last December.\n\nThe pair first met five years ago on the reality singing competition when Liam was just 17 years old.\n\nDuring their time on the show, Cheryl had nothing but kind words for the teen and his band mates, telling viewers, “You are great kids and I love chatting to you backstage, you are good lads, nice lads.”\n\nThe well-placed pal explained to the British paper that the pair have become closer over the years thanks to their mutual friend, Simon Cowell.\n\n“Cheryl has obviously known Liam for many years.”\n\nExplaining, “They’ve always got on well because they are both northern and share many of the same interests.”\n\n“But there was never anything romantic between them in the past.”\n\nCheryl and Liam worked together professionally in 2014 after the boy band member remixed the singer’s song, ‘I Don’t Care’.\n\nWatch: Cheryl and Liam share a smooch at the X Factor finale\n\nTweeting the 1D star, Cheryl quipped, “Thanks Payno, I love it,” along with dancing emojis.\n\nThe pal explained how their friendship has since blossomed, “Their relationship developed very quickly in December after the X Factor final where One Direction gave their final performance before starting their hiatus.”\n\nWhile Cheryl has been dealing with the demise of her marriage, Liam has been coping with the split of his band.\n\nThe source revealed that despite the difficult months, the smitten stars have been getting through their respective hardships together.\n\n“Cheryl is like a different person. She’s carefree and happy again. There’s a lot less stress in her life.”\n\nBefore adding, “Liam was really struggling with the idea of life after the band to begin with – being in the spotlight and that level of fame had started to get to him. But he’s been so happy with Cheryl. He’s been telling people close to him that he’s madly in love.”\n\nThe musicians might not be ready to go public, but they have no issue airing their relationship out.\n\nBefore the pair attended the Brit Awards separately, Liam commented on one of Cheryl’s Instagram snap , saying “see you there babe” followed by a wink emoji.\n\nTime will tell whether the pair decide to go public, but no doubt they’ll have a legion of fans cheering on this poptastic pairing."
