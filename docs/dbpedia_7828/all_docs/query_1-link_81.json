        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is poised to become the new face of charity call service Childline. The 33-year-old pop star is reported to have secretly filmed a series of adverts for the charity NSPCC at the end of September at a studio in London, with the adverts said to be filled with emotion. A source told The Sun newspaper: \"The adverts are sure to get a lot of people talking. \"They're very emotive and there's no gimmicks. Cheryl was delighted to be asked to take part in the ads as it's a cause very close to her heart.\" The adverts will reportedly feature the former Girls Aloud star sitting on a stool and giving a speech. But rather than the viewers hearing Cheryl's distinctive voice, they will hear those of various Childline callers who have been the victims of abuse. One of the voice recordings, for instance, has been created by a child who has been sexually abused. Cheryl is the latest big-name celebrity who has thrown her support behind the charity, which has previously been fronted by her long-time friend and former co-star on the UK 'X Factor' Simon Cowell. Meanwhile, the music mogul recently addressed widespread rumours that Cheryl is pregnant with the baby of former One Direction star Liam Payne, revealing he'd love to be handed the role of godfather. Asked about the speculation, Simon said: \"I expect him to be called Simon. Or Simone, either one I'm happy with that. I doubt Cheryl will be.\""
