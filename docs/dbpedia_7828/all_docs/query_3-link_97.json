        "text": "And it's about time people left her alone now.\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini is, and always has been, drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nHowever, since she made her return to The X Factor in August, her appearance has been intensely scrutinised, with people calling her \"too thin\".\n\nFollowing Saturday night's episode, a Facebook user uploaded this post, saying: \"I'm sorry I think this woman is naturally beautiful but it's heartbreaking to see her tonight on #xfactor #thisisntagoodrolemodelforkids.\"\n\nBut many comments defended Cheryl and urged people to stop speculating about her appearance.\n\nOthers said women should stop \"bringing other women down\".\n\nThis, coincidentally, is something Cheryl recently spoke out about.\n\nIn an interview with the Evening Standard, she said:\n\nI can take whatever they [the media] throw at me after 13 years, what worries me is what it's doing to the younger generation. And some of the people writing this stuff are women. There is no sisterhood. The body shaming has to stop. It's bullshit. Something has to be done, changed, even if it's done in law. I am very happy and very healthy.\n\nShe was also driven to make her Instagram account private in October after receiving so many body-shaming comments. ðŸ˜” ðŸ˜”\n\nShe wrote a lengthy post about how the comments had made her feel:\n\nI am so sick and tired of it being OK to call somebody too thin or \"a bag of bones.\" I would never dream of calling someone too fat and that they should maybe cut down on their food intake. What's the difference? You have no idea what I have been through. Just loosing [sic] my father in law v recently and everything that comes with that. Not that I am or should justify myself to anyone. I am so f sick of people thinking it's ok to be mean or body shame anyone. And it's woman on woman. Have some respect.\n\nAnd it's not just women â€“ on Saturday, even Lord Sugar decided to weigh in with his opinion.\n\nAll of which suggests that maybe it's now time to leave her, and any opinions about her body, alone.\n\nShare This Article"
