It has also been alleged that she would like to be introduced as Cheryl Fernandez-Versini on The X Factor.\n\nA source told Digital Spy that her X Factor colleagues believed that her wedding was a prank.\n\nThey said: \"Everyone thought it was a prank when we saw it in the paper. It truly was the best-kept secret in showbiz.\n\n\"Jean-Bernard has come down to auditions before and he's a very nice guy. We're very happy for Cheryl, and we're sure the judges will be sending out flowers and planning something fun for the arena auditions.\""
