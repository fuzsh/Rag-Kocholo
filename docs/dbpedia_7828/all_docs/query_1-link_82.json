        "text": "Cheryl Cole has said au revioir to her surname, with claims the Geordie star now wants to be called by her new married name, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Mirror.co.uk reports.\n\nAlready the former Girls Aloud singer has dropped “Cole” from her Twitter profile following the lavish wedding to new beau Jean-Bernard at the exclusive Cotton House resort on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nAnd ahead of her return to the X-Factor there’s speculation that the singer plans to use her new double-barreled moniker.\n\nIt has been reported that ‘pals’ of the star told them that she will now be known by her married name and plans to tell producers of the TV talent show she wants to be known as that when the new series starts next month.\n\nWor Cheryl and her new husband splashed out a small fortune on their paradise island wedding - including rings worth up to £300,000.\n\nBut the couple kept their nuptials secret from all but a few friends and family - and swore all the staff at the resort to secrecy.\n\nCheryl’s dad Garry Tweedy, 56, said: “She has left it for a while before making it public because she just wanted it to be kept completely private. I knew about it but Cheryl did that quite deliberately. And it worked.”\n\nGarry parted from Cheryl’s mum Joan Callaghan when the star was 11 but they are in regular contact via phone and text messages. He still lives in Newcastle and was one of only a handful of people to know about his daughter’s wedding before it was officially announced.\n\nHer stepdad Anthony Leighton, also in Newcastle, said: “I found out via Facebook. Cheryl doesn’t bother with us much.\n\n“She phones her sister and brother sometimes so it’s a bit of a surprise for everyone. But she’s lovely and I’m over the moon for her. If she’s happy then I’m happy.” Asked if the family attended the wedding, he said: “I couldn’t tell you. In this family nobody says nowt about nowt to anybody.”\n\nYet details of the ceremony are beginning to leak out, with the couple having wed at one of the resort’s top villas overlooking Macaroni Beach.\n\nThe villa costs £11,000 a week and comes with butler, chef, housekeeper and gardener, as well as a bar, 49ft pool, two plunge pools and a cinema.\n\nThe pair are expected to have a second bash to celebrate the wedding in the UK after getting hitched in front of just four guests - Cheryl’s mum Joan, personal assistant Lily England, Jean-Bernard’s mum and his best man.\n\nThe newlyweds and their guests are thought to have flown from London to St Lucia on a first-class flight costing £9,000 each, then taken a private jet to the celebrity haunt, costing £10,000 return.\n\nLittle expense was spare on the star’s rings either with jeweller to the stars Vashi Dominguez comparing it to bling queen Kim Kardashian’s when she tied the knot with rapper Kanye West.\n\n“Cheryl’s emerald-cut diamond engagement ring is reminiscent of Kim Kardashian’s, who recently wed rapper Kanye West. It is crafted from platinum in a wide band and mounted with two large side stones for that added sparkle. It’s a show-stopper and Cheryl wears it with an elegant channel-set diamond wedding ring - understated and sophisticated yet still beautifully eye-catching.\n\n“After such a whirlwind romance, it seems Jean-Bernard has pulled out all the stops to better the nation’s sweetheart’s previous rings, bought by Ashley Cole. This bridal set has a value of almost £300,000. I’d value the new engagement at £275,000 and the diamond wedding ring at £15,000.\n\n“He is to be congratulated for his taste. They are two gorgeous rings and work so well as a combination.”"
