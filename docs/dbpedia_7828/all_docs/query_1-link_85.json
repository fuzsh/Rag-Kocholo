        "text": "Cheryl Cole secretly marries Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in Mustique\n\nCheryl Cole’s elusive new HUSBAND Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini is about as low-key as they come – here’s what you need to know about the man whose name we are all trying to pronounce in Geordie accents this morning.\n\nHe’s French… Cheryl famously sang that she Can’t Speak French – a factor that could prove problematic when catching up with her very French new in-laws. Jean-Bernard splits his time between the French Riviera and St Barts and grew up on the French coast before heading to New York’s NYU for uni. So far, so lovely.\n\nHe's A Restaurateur… The two met at the Cannes Film Festival, where Cosy Box co-founder Jean-Bernard (known as JB to friends in the business) has been hosting his luxe pop-up eateries has for the last 6 years. He and his business partner, Francky Twister, have played host to everyone from Jared Leto to Paris Hilton and held installations around the world at A-list events like Art Basel and Paris Fashion Week. Tres chic.\n\nHe’s #Charming… “#gorgeous @ladyccole at @cosybox #lastnight #amazing #stunning #partying #party #goodtimes #crazy #elegant” he captioned his first Instagram snap of the two of them. Ordinarily we don’t rate over-hashtagging as a form of affection, but in this case, and with a couple that hot, we’re totally swooning for her."
