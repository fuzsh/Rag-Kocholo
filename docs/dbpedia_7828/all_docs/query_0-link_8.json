They have been dating for three months.\n\nWho is Cheryl Cole's husband?\n\nThe singer changed her name on Twitter yesterday from @CherylCole to @CherylOfficial, finally dropping her former husband Ashley Cole’s moniker. She did the same thing on Instagram, becoming misscheryl.\n\nShe also thanked fans for their many congratulations on Twitter.\n\nShe tried to shed Cole’s name once before in 2012, wishing to be known as simply Cheryl. It didn’t quite work with her fans though and she never legally made the change.\n\nThe X Factor presenter announced her wedding news on her website and Instagram page this weekend, also sharing a picture of her wedding and engagement ring.\n\n“I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news... Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14,” she wrote in a statement. “We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together.”\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini best quotes\n\nShow all 15\n\nFernandez-Versini is a French restaurant entrepreneur, who no one seems to know much about. He went studied business administration at New York University and the New York Times once included him in a feature about the city’s new crop of ‘Eurotrash’, describing how he took a gap year “just to party”.\n\nHe runs a pop-up nightclub and restaurant called Cosy Box open during Cannes Film Festival. It remains unclear what he does during the rest of the year.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
