I don't think this picture really screams anything.\n\nEdited at 2016-02-28 05:34 pm (UTC)\n\nShe's shopping in a supermarket? The only think gross and try hard here is your comment.\n\nEdited at 2016-02-28 05:03 pm (UTC)\n\nLol all these responses. I didnt know there were so many Chezza stans on ONTD.\n\nPeople jump on the randomest comments here. I had people get mad at me for pointing out Beck was a Scientologist in a post.\n\n(no subject) - trancexperiment Expand\n\n...you got three replies before posting this and two were people saying she's just shopping.

I mean, it could definitely be them but idk either one of their backs that intimately to tell you for sure.\n\nIsn't this in the last post? It's strange that the original source tweeted, deleted then went private right after posting that seems legit.\n\nLiam... so disappointed right now.\n\nsmh\n\ncoming for Nadine's brand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nclassic, especially with that twitter active today\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - pikapika217 Expand\n\npurfect\n\nI've never heard this Liam person sing but i am going to assume he sounds as mediocre as he looks.\n\nCheryl, i used to lowkey stan you but nowadays you a mess girl...\n\nthe only one in the band whose vocals matter tbh < 3\n\nNah, he's a talented singer and very versatile vocally.\n\nHe's a better singer than she is.\n\nthat ain't hard.\n\n(no subject) - misscrystal25 Expand\n\n(no subject) - clickyraptor Expand\n\nCheryl Ann Tweedy Cole Fernandez-Versini Payne!\n\ni hope they purchased nadine's album\n\nlove it or hate it, ONTD?\n\nlove, beyond love. favorite thing in the world, tbh. there's an organic coop opening in my neighbhorhood this summer and I'm SO excited.\n\nI love it and hate it. lol Just depends on the day.\n\nI like food and getting fresh food but i hate spending money so hate it. Food takes up a lot of my income cos i cook\n\nI walk to a farmers market right by my apt but i prefer trader joes or publix\n\ndepends on how i'm doing financially.\n\nwhen i've got cash to spare it's fun, but if i'm broke and it's down to how little i can spend in order to survive, i'd rather chew my own limbs off than have to step foot in a supermarket.\n\nlove grocery shopping, hate bringing bags up two flights up stairs and putting the food away\n\nLove it. Even when I'm having a bad day, picking out food I wanna eat relaxes me and makes me happy.\n\nI love it if it's not crowded. I made the mistake of going shopping during Thanksgiving weekend before. It was packed and I started to panic, I ended up going into the dog food aisle and having a good cry/breathing exercise. :(\n\nBut it's the only kind of shopping I like usually. I always get hungry while I'm there and end up eating things before I pay for them lmbo. (I keep the wrappers as proof, mind you!)\n\nI don't really mind it once I make myself go to the store. But I almost always spend too much cause I get stuff I didn't have on my list. 😁\n\nI LOVE grocery stores but I hate that I spend so much money at them lol\n\nHATE. I live in the city so the grocery store is always beyond crowded, and the aisles are so small, two carts can barely pass each other. And then we have to carry the shit home or push that granny cart.\n\nfarmers markets are fun tho\n\nI like it when I have enough money to get whatever and the store isn't crowded af\n\nHATE. My social anxiety is at its peak in shopping-related tasks; paying for something at a counter ad bagging it is like a nightmare. Plus the fact that most of it is food makes me extra anxious, seeing as I'm shameful about food in general.\n\nI have a lot of issues.\n\nI also just hate carrying the shopping back home after lol, it's only a 15 minute walk but it is the worst.\n\nThat's gonna be so expensive. I shop at Wal-Mart, ain't nobody got time for being poor and with little food.\n\nI hate and I mean hate food shopping if there's a list involved. My mother always has a list and I swear to god its my personal hell, but I have to do it because my mother can't. My job won't ever send me food shopping because they know I hate it and that list is always a huge bitch of a list. Just looking at a list I cringe.\n\nWhen I shop I just pick up shit. One time my mother gave me 3 list and my head almost exploded. She never did it again. If you want me to shop with a list I'm only going 1 place.\n\nI'm surprised at all the \"love\" comments...\n\nIt's a necessary evil to me so I'll just get it over with quickly\n\nI loved it when I was young and my parents supported me. Now it's kind of depressing looking at all the things I can't afford.\n\nEdited at 2016-02-28 05:39 pm (UTC)\n\nhate it because i don't know how to cook, can never think of meals to make, and never know what to buy.\n\nlove love love it. i especially love exploring supermarkets when i'm in a different country.\n\nWhat city are you from? I just watched the co-op Broad City episode and am super curious about them. Do u have to work a certain number of hours?\n\nI live in Cincinnati. The coop is opening in Clifton, which is near the university. It's got a 'natural' store in it already--but it's crazy overpriced and does not serve the needs of the diverse community. You don't have to work at the coop, you pay for membership and vote on major decisions like management and sourcing.\n\nidk i moved to germany and holy shit food is so cheap here that i'm constantly eating fruit and vegetables. much more than when i lived in the states. when i go home, my mom tells me to stop complaining like a depression widow about the price of food but i can't help it. /csb i like grocery shopping in europe but america makes me sad.\n\nRe: grocery shopping - localised Expand\n\nI HATE grocery shopping. To the point that I do my shopping online and pick it up at the store. Thank God they have that service.\n\nLove it but I always end up spending more than I intended to\n\nI love it when I'm in no hurry and can actually afford it.\n\nEdited at 2016-02-28 06:16 pm (UTC)\n\ni looooooove it, it's one of my fave things to do lol. but i buy way too much shit i don't need\n\nall these people who love it can shop for me, i despise it, it's such a chore\n\nI love it but hate that in the city centre there is only tiny ass Sainsbury's when I want that massive Tesco.\n\nHaaaaate it. Mostly I hate when I just need to pick up something to make for dinner and I end up spending $50. It would cost me less to just go out to eat.\n\nLove grocery shopping. Hate people with 25 things in the 12 items or less express line. There should be a special place in hell reserved for them.\n\nthis is such a weird couple. i feel like cheryl deserves a nice relationship considering what a colossal mess her love life has always been, but i'm also looking forward to how messy this could get.\n\ndo you think this is for promo? like i love cheryl but i dont think her solo career is what she had hoped for. also isnt she still married?\n\nyes lol\n\nWell… she's on x factor where everyone is jumping ship and it has increasingly terrible ratings, plus she's going to be recording a new album soon.\n\nShe does the absolute least to promote her albums, so I honestly think she's been more successful than she expected.\n\nbut i dont think her solo career is what she had hoped for.\n\nSis, Queen Cheezza does the least amount of any pop star and gets #1's with ease.\n\nWith the way they've handled it, it's so obvious they're looking for attention it's not even funny.\n\nThey confirmed their relationship to The Sun and People before anyone even asked or there where any pics of them together.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)"
