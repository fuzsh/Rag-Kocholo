        "text": "Cheryl - who has constantly had to defend her slim frame - took to Instagram today to slam the media once again for judging people on the way they look.\n\nThe lengthy post began: \"The other side of body shaming is skinny shaming. I think this happens just as much as shaming someone for being bigger.\"\n\nShe added: \"How often do you hear someone say, 'give that girl a sandwich', or 'she needs a good feed'?\n\n\"Everyone says they want the 'perfect body' and have so many body goals, but when a girl is just that bit too skinny, in your eyes, she gets judged.\"\n\nShe also said that people nowadays have it drilled into them that \"a certain size is too thin or too big\" but she insisted that it's \"ok to have a thigh gap\".\n\nCheryl continued: \"There is so, so, so, so much more to life than having the 'perfect body'. Every young person needs to understand that.\n\n\"Go travelling, learn about different cultures, be happy, fall in love and don't give a f**k about what people think.\n\n\"If your main goal in life is to be someone's 'body goals', you need to reconsider your attitude,\" she concluded.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There is no sisterhood.\n\n\"The body shaming has to stop. It’s bulls**t. Something has to be done, changed, even if it’s done in law.\""
