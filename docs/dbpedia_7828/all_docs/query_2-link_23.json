        "text": "The Crazy, Stupid, Love singer kept her surname from her marriage to Ashley Cole for four years following their divorce in 2010, but plans to be known just by her first name in her pop career.\n\nA friend of former Girls Aloud star told The Sun: \"Cheryl is very traditional and she is taking JB's name going forward.\n\n\"She kept the Cole name after her divorce from Ashley as it felt like a backwards step reverting to [her maiden name] Tweedy. But this is a very different situation.\"\n\n\"She's a traditionalist and this is the man she plans to spend the rest of her life with.\n\n\"For music, she's likely to use just Cheryl for her official artist name in the future.\"\n\nWhile Cheryl will drop her surname for her music, she is expected to use her surname on The X Factor - the UK reality show of which she has returned to the judging panel - and will be announced as Cheryl Fernandez-Versini by the series' famous voice Peter Dickson when the live shows start to mark a \"new phase\" for the pretty brunette.\n\nA show source said: \"It's certainly a mouthful, but it's great because her return to X Factor will mark a new phase in her life.\"\n\nCheryl first sparked speculation she was changing her name after changing her Twitter handle from @CherylCole to @CherylOfficial yesterday.\n\nThe Fight For This Love hitmaker is believed to have wed Jean-Bernard in a small ceremony of just four - which included her mother Joan Callaghan - on the island of Mustique, in the West Indies last week.\n\nShe took to Instagram to confirm the news, captioning a photo of a sparkling diamond on her ring finger: \"I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news... Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14.. We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together...\""
