        "text": "Pop star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has vowed to help Tyneside’s less fortunate as her charity swings into action.\n\nThe Geordie princess recently launched Cheryl’s Trust to help disadvantaged young people in the North East find employment and “build self-esteem.”\n\nAnd from the council estates of Newcastle to the shores of dazzling Lake Como, the girl done good.\n\nOver the course of the next 18 months she has pledged to raise £2m to help build a centre and, from here, hopes to open buildings in cities country-wide.\n\nShe has spent the past six months meeting businesses in the North East, with the first initiative to be announced later this month.\n\nWith one in five people here currently jobless, and having seen her own brother, Andrew, jailed in 2011 for his part in an armed robbery, Cheryl has witnessed first-hand the effects of crime and unemployment.\n\n“I have gone from wanting to do this to needing to do this, to give something back” she explains.\n\n“Sadly, in Newcastle we are in dire straights and I know that I’m one of the lucky ones – someone who was able to get out, and get a job.\n\n“I still have friends who are struggling up there. It’s hard to watch.\n\n“My brother has been in prison but it’s not just about him. There are multiple stories like this, so many examples of things I witnessed growing up- people with depression, low self-esteem and drug problems, and all these things the centre will be able to tackle.\n\n“I was working in a cafe before all this started and there is every chance I would still be doing that if I hadn’t found the job I love. I know I am very lucky.”\n\nDespite the glamorous world Cheryl now lives in, being a modern-day celebrity isn’t easy.\n\nToo thin, too fat, too pretty, too plain are all criticisms aimed at stars in today’s social media-obsessed world.\n\nAnd Cheryl is livid about it.\n\nDespite *those* dimples, and *that* profile, the star’s recent weight loss has seen her dubbed a “bag of bones”, with commentators across the land crudely pronouncing her an unhealthy role model.\n\nThe reality, she insists, is that she is a happy, healthy 32-year-old woman – one without an eating disorder.\n\n“No, I’m not anorexic,” she says.\n\n“It all started with a girl on Instagram calling us a bag of bones. At the time I was thinking people are so quick to judge without thinking, ‘Is there a reason why this person might be like that?’\n\n“Right now I feel like we are facing a lot of body issues in general – girls expected to have big booties, girls with thin legs – and it’s impossible.\n\n“It needs to slow down, or stop. It’s highlighting body insecurities and it’s not right.\n\n“I work 12 to 14 hours a day, I don’t even have time at the moment to exercise - and I don’t need to either.\n\n“It’s nice that people are concerned, but, honestly but there’s no cause for concern.\n\n“You can see I am completely and utterly well, and happy.”\n\nLooking at Cheryl she does look in shape.\n\nBut she is also glowing, and certainly does not have the gaunt, emaciated appearance of someone who doesn’t eat.\n\nShe probably just doesn’t gnaw at Wimpy by the bucket-load as fellow X Factor judge, Simon Cowell, recently joked.\n\nAs Cheryl – funnier, and quicker, in real life than you might expect – says: “You know what, I’m just about going to get through the day... I think I’ll survive.”\n\nChatting at the Grove hotel in Watford, where bootcamp auditions are being filmed, Cheryl is known for her guardedness in interviews.\n\nOr, as one writer put it, “speaking in platitudes.”\n\nSo, has fame made her overly-cautious? Or, like so many popstars of her time, has she merely been media trained into submission?\n\n“I’ve never had media training in my life and on, and off, the record I’m really fun, thank you very much,” she laughs.\n\n“But yes, I went through a period of time where I did become quite guarded, but I am past that now.\n\n“I got to the point where I was tired of all this rubbish being written about me so I wrote a book and put everything in that. And since then it feels like a new start, and I’ve been more open.\n\n“If someone is stand-offish with you, you become like that with them, and that person won’t get the best out of me. It’s an energy thing.”\n\nOf course, being Cheryl has its perks.\n\nWith over seven million followers online, designers queuing up to dress her, and brand ambassadors desperate to endorse her, such is her popularity that Cheryl is destined to hit “national treasure” status the very second she hits 50.\n\nBut being Chez has its drawbacks.\n\nWhile launching her solo career in 2010, she discovered ex-husband Ashley Cole had cheated on her with a blonde secretary.\n\nThe next evening she was up on stage at the Brit awards – minus wedding ring – belting out the words to her new single, the unfortunately entitled Fight For This Love.\n\nA few months later, following a break in Tanzania, she was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with malaria. She nearly died.\n\nThis girl is a trooper and, aptly, her fans are known as “Cheryl’s soldiers.”\n\nCheryl can barely sneeze without it being splashed across magazines, papers or gossip websites and it is this oppression which led to her getting a paparazzi injunction obtained at the High Court three years ago.\n\nCelebrity isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, as she explains: “Fame is absolutely not normal by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n“It’s a weird world, one you can’t understand unless you’ve experienced it, and I’ve stopped expecting people to understand it. You expect people just to get it, and they don’t. “And yet they think that they do because they read stuff, but until you’ve lived it or you’ve had a close brush with it, you really don’t get it.\n\n“It’s been 13 years I’ve been doing this now and in that time everything has changed.\n\n“Showbiz years are like dog ones, so I’m about 105.\n\n“At one point in my life it made me more cynical, definitely, but I’m over that now, and when I go home that’s my normality.”\n\nNormal for you or I might be a weekly shop, or a trip to the cinema. For Cheryl, this is no longer possible.\n\n“The last time I went to Sainsbury’s was about a year ago,” she says.\n\n“Now I order everything online, so that they just drop it to your door.\n\n“I do try and go out in disguise, and I’ve tried everything, but I still always get recognised. “I’ve even put gloves on to try and cover up the hand tattoos, and gone out wearing literally no make-up, see through glasses, my hair in a centre parting and these gloves, and then, sometimes, I get someone saying, ‘Oooh, you really look like that Cheryl.’\n\n“So then I put on an accent, and just say: ‘Oh really, do I?’”\n\nAfter coming to fame in 2002 in ITV reality show, Pop Stars: The Rivals and forming Girls Aloud alongside bandmates Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding and Nadine Coyle, she enjoyed a hugely successful 11 years with the band.\n\nRacking up four number ones and a Brit award win, Cheryl went on to launch a triumphant solo career, becoming the first UK female artist to achieve five number ones.\n\nIn 2008 she replaced Sharon Osbourne on the X Factor judging panel, and was an instant hit with fans, as well as guiding Alexandra Burke to victory.\n\nBut three years later, it all went horribly wrong when she wasaxed within days of joining the US version of the show.\n\nShe returned to the UK series last year, and hasn’t looked back.\n\n“I’m really enjoying it, and have never laughed this much,” she said.\n\nIn her personal life, Cheryl is also happier than ever after meeting, and marrying, French businessman, Jean-Bernard, with whom she celebrated her one year anniversary last month.\n\nClicking her fingers, she beams: “It just came around like that, and it’s all good.\n\n“We went away to Lake Como which was great.\n\n“I did have one eye open all the time for George Clooney and although I didn’t see him, the people there all put his name into a lot of sentences which is funny because it goes back to the whole fame thing nowadays, and how people are around it.”\n\nBut where would wor Cheryl be if she hadn’t found surprise fame, and love? “Coming over now to audition for the Overs,” she grins."
