        "text": "The ex-husband of X Factor star Cheryl Tweedy has told how he survived being thrust into the singer’s “mad world”.\n\nBut restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini said he has now “moved on” and never thinks about his former wife.\n\nThe 36-year-old Frenchman split from Cheryl, 33, after less than 18 months together.\n\nHe said: “I’ve lost a lot. I don’t have my parents, I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m alone now.\n\n“I married someone who was famous, I was thrust into this mad world – I didn’t like it.\n\n“There was really awful things said about me, about my family, but I feel like I survived it. And I’m here surviving, doing my thing.”\n\nJean-Bernard wed the former Girls Aloud star 12 weeks after they met at a party in 2014. They split in 2015.\n\nHe said: “It’s been two years – I feel like a different person. That was the old me.”\n\nCheryl went on to find love with One Direction singer Liam Payne, 23. Their baby son, Bear, was born in March.\n\nAdmitting he would like children himself, Jean-Bernard said: “If someone I used to be with goes on to have another boyfriend or have children, that’s good for them, I wish them well – but I’m not going to think about it.\n\n“When I’m not with someone I don’t think about them. Right now I’m focused on work.”\n\nThe businessman has opened a pop-up restaurant in Cannes, named Versini in tribute to his late mother.\n\nIt has attracted stars including Eva Longoria and Naomi Campbell – in town for the French resort’s film festival.\n\nOccupying the roof of a five-star hotel, the restaurant is a blueprint for a permanent venture in London.\n\nJean-Bernard said: “I’ve learned about being alone and having to do things on my own.\n\n“I’m in love with my restaurant. I’ve married it, I’m sleeping with it, I’m living it.\n\n“I lost my mum and I wanted to carry on her name – that was the most important thing for me.”\n\nGlamorous celebrity hangouts fill the Cannes Film Festival - but this year it is all about super swanky Versini.\n\nA-listers including Naomi Campbell, Elisabeth Moss and Eva Longoria have been flocking to the venue.\n\nAnd the man behind the pop up at the top of the Five Seas Hotel is Jean Bernard Fernandez Versini.\n\nIt follows his first Cannes pop up venture Cosy Box - a fun, dark venue with a disco vibe. But Versini is different. It oozes style and glamour with sophisticated signature cocktails such as Versini Martini and a two star Michelin chef flown in from Paris.\n\nCelebs such as Naomi Campbell and Eva Longoria have been flocking to the venue.\n\nJB continued: \"It's very different to Cosy Box, that was fun and light hearted but this is more sophisticated.\n\n\"I feel more confident in what I'm doing.\""
