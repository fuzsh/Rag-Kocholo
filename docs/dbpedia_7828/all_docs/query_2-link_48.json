        "text": "The changing names of Cheryl have come full circle – at least in business – as the singer now signs official documents with her maiden name.\n\nRead more: Kimberley Walsh opens up about “carnage” play dates with Cheryl\n\nThe singer’s boyfriend, Liam Payne, claimed earlier this year that Cheryl had reverted back to Tweedy.\n\nIt seems he was right, with documents from Cheryl’s million pound business being made public, showing the singer’s signature with Tweedy in full view.\n\n“Her name is officially Cheryl Tweedy now,” the former One Direction star said, back in May, “but to be honest it doesn’t really bother me, we have a kid together, there’s a lot more to our life.”\n\nCheryl initially made a name for herself as Cheryl Tweedy, appearing on Popstars: The Rivals, and forming Girls Aloud.\n\nShe began releasing solo material under her first married name, Cole, in 2008.\n\nCheryl was married to footballer Ashley Cole from 2006 to 2010, and Cheryl continued to go by Cole after their divorce, although she began to release music as simply, Cheryl.\n\nAfter her marriage to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in 2014 her name changed again. The two divorced last year, with the singer claiming their relationship led to her “stress and weight loss.”\n\nCheryl took home £400,000 from her company, CC Couture, in 2016, with the company reserves growing to £1.4 million.\n\nThe Sun has revealed that the released accounts clearly show that the singer has reverted back to her own name.\n\nRead more: Sarah Harding has tweeted “frenemy” Cheryl – and their social media fans can’t cope\n\nAfter her two divorces, Cheryl appears to have finally found happiness with Liam, and the two welcomed their first child, Bear, in March."
