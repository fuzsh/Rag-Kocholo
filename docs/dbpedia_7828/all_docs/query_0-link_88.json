        "text": "Cheryl has admitted she regrets changing her stage name when she got married, throwing some major shade her ex-husband’s way.\n\nOuch.\n\nThe Love Made Me Do It hitmaker has been through a few name changes, including Cole, Tweedy, and Fernandez-Versini before reverting to just Cheryl.\n\nHowever, speaking to Drag Race’s RuPaul and Michelle Visage on their podcast What’s The Tee?, she admitted the name changes were ‘tricky’.\n\nWhen asked by Ru if she regrets changing her stage name to reflect her married name, Cheryl said: ‘Yes I do. But it’s a difficult one isn’t it?\n\n‘I was Cheryl Tweedy, and then I got married and was married for six years to him,’ she recalled. ‘Then we broke up and it was my name by then, everybody knew me by then.\n\n‘And then you meet somebody else, then people are addressing you by your previous husband’s name, it’s a tricky one.’\n\nWith Ru confessing he couldn’t pronounce her second married name, when she tied the knot with restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, the 36-year-old quipped: ‘You don’t have to, you can forget all about that. We don’t worry about that.’\n\n‘That [name] did not roll off the tongue,’ Ru laughed, with Cheryl agreeing: ‘No.’\n\nAwkward!\n\nCheryl and Jean-Bernard tied the knot back in 2014, although the pair divorced two years later.\n\nShe went on to date Liam Payne for two years, with the two of them having their son Bear in 2017.\n\nSpeaking about motherhood, Cheryl previously told Metro.co.uk that the birth of her first child changed everything and allowed her to gain ‘genuine perspective on life’ leading her to never say never to anything again.\n\n‘I think when I had the baby everything changed and I have genuine perspective on life and what’s real and what’s important,’ she said, ‘and a new found respect and love for what I do and how much fun it is… I have fallen in love with my career again.’\n\nMORE : Cheryl feared son Bear being ‘swapped at birth’ as she opens up on motherhood"
