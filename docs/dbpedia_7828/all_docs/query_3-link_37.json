        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Liam Payne have taken things to the next level and moved in together, according to reports.\n\nThe former Girls Aloud singer has reportedly moved into the One Direction star’s LA mansion, after dating for the last five months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to The Sun, the couple have created a love nest at the multimillion pound property in Calabasas, Los Angeles, which Liam bought with his earnings from One Direction.\n\nA source told the newspaper: “Cheryl and Liam are getting more serious by the day.\n\n“They want to make the most of their time with each other before Cheryl has to go back to the UK, so it made sense for her to come and live with him.\n\n“They are so happy together and head over heels. It is definitely the real deal.”\n\nCheryl, who is in LA recording her new album, got together with the 22-year-old boybander after she split from her husband of 19 months, Jean Bernard-Versini, last year.\n\nThe 32-year-old former ‘X Factor’ judge went public with Liam last month, when they were papped holding hands as they left a dinner date in London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam split with long-term girlfriend Sophia Smith in November last year.\n\nEarlier this week, ‘X Factor’ boss Simon Cowell revealed that Cheryl and Liam were “like two little chipmunks madly in love”.\n\nHe said: “I saw them together and we had a really nice dinner. They were on good form. Literally, they were so cute.”"
