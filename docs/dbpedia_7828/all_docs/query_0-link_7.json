        "text": "‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you think I feel when you call my name?‚Äù The Artist Formerly Known As Cheryl Cole once asked us.\n\nWell, we‚Äôd love to find out ‚Äî but we‚Äôre just not sure which name you‚Äôd like to hear, Chezza.\n\nThere was a time once, many moons ago, when The Singer In Question was known as the Popstars: The Rivals TV talent show hopeful Cheryl Tweedy. It was a better, simpler time ‚Äî a time when life wasn‚Äôt cold, dreams still glittered and Girls Aloud would soon reign supreme as The World‚Äôs Greatest Girl Group Of The 21st Century.\n\nIn July 2006, Chezza married Ashley Cole, a footballer. It was in prime Chemistry era (chemistry, indeed!) as the Almighty Aloud ascended to the throne, and Cheryl quickly became the glamorous pop star we know (knew) as Cheryl Cole, all the way up until her 2009 debut solo album, 3 Words.\n\nSuddenly, raindrops began to fall and things became messy, resulting in Chezza‚Äôs divorce in 2010. Things immediately got a bit dicey regarding her stage name: Was Cheryl now Cheryl Tweedy again? No. She was Cheryl Cole still, according to her Messy Little Raindrops album cover and the name on her Twitter account ‚Äî the only valid form of identification.\n\nYears passed, and the divorce slowly but surely slipped from the headlines. It was time for a brand new record ‚Äî 2012‚Äôs A Million Lights ‚Äî which meant it was time for a brand new Cheryl. But what kind of Cheryl? A Cheryl Cheryl! That‚Äôs right: No Cole. No Tweedy. No nothing. Just Cheryl ‚Äî like Madonna, or Oprah.\n\nAnd now, two years later, we‚Äôre here: It‚Äôs 2014, and things are pretty crazy and stupid. (That is ‚Äî her horn-filled new single, ‚ÄúCrazy Stupid Love.‚Äù) And, in what seems to be an effort to explicitly display the definition of ‚ÄúCrazy Stupid Love,‚Äù Cheryl‚Äôs gone and married her French boyfriend of roughly 3 months, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. Crazy? Sure. Stupid? Maybe, maybe not. Love? Evidently!\n\nBut here‚Äôs the real question: What now? As of her surprise announcement last night, Cheryl‚Äôs already changed her Twitter handle to @CherylOfficial and her Instagram to ‚ÄúMiss Cheryl.‚Äù (Then again, there‚Äôs also an ad for ‚ÄúCrazy Stupid Love‚Äù by Cheryl Cole in her header.) And yet, she‚Äôs very much not Cheryl Cole at this point.\n\nThe only real options here are Cheryl Just Cheryl, Miss Cheryl, The Artist Formerly Known As Cheryl Cole, or Cheryl Tweecolesini. (I myself would love if Miss Cheryl had a moment ‚Äî although, isn‚Äôt she Mrs. Cheryl at this point? ARGH.)\n\nWhile the silent confusion rages on in my mind, let us wish a happy, healthy and #blessed marriage to Mr. & Mrs. Fernandez-Versini."
