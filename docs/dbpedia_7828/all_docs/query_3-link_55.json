        "text": "Too thin, too fat, too pretty, too plain – it’s not easy being a female celebrity in today’s social media-obsessed world.\n\nAnd Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is livid about it.\n\nDespite those dimples, and that profile, the star’s recent weight loss has led to her being dubbed a “bag of bones”, with commentators across the land crudely pronouncing her an unhealthy role model.\n\nThe reality, she insists, is that she is a happy, healthy 32-year-old woman – one without an eating disorder.\n\n“No, I’m not anorexic,” she sighs, clearly furious at even having to answer the question. “It all started with a girl on Instagram calling us a bag of bones.\n\n“At the time I was thinking people are so quick to judge without thinking, ‘Is there a reason why this person might be like that?’.\n\n“Right now I feel like we are facing a lot of body issues in general – girls expected to have big booties, girls with thin legs – and it’s impossible.\n\n“It needs to slow down, or stop. It’s highlighting body insecurities and it’s not right.\n\n“I work 12 to 14 hours a day. I don’t even have time at the moment to exercise – and I don’t need to either.\n\n“It’s nice that people are concerned, but, honestly there’s no cause for concern.\n\n“You can see I am completely and utterly well and happy.”\n\nLooking at Cheryl, she is very thin. But she is also glowing, and does not have the gaunt, emaciated appearance of someone who doesn’t eat.\n\nShe probably just doesn’t gnaw at Wimpy by the bucketload as fellow X Factor judge Simon Cowell recently joked.\n\nAs Cheryl – funnier and quicker in real life than you might expect – deadpans: “You know what, I’m just about going to get through the day... I think I’ll survive.”\n\nWe’re chatting at swanky The Grove hotel in Hertfordshire, where bootcamp auditions are being filmed – and Cheryl is known for her guardedness in interviews.\n\nSo, has fame made her over-cautious? Or, like so many pop stars has she been media-trained into submission?\n\n“I’ve never had media training. On, and off, the record I’m really fun, thank you very much!”, she laughs/snaps.\n\n“Yes, I went through a period of time where I did become quite guarded, but I am past that now.\n\n“I got to the point where I was tired of all this rubbish being written about me so I wrote a book and put everything in that. And since then it feels like a new start, and I’ve been more open.\n\n“If someone is standoffish with you, you become like that with them, and that person won’t get the best out of me. It’s an energy thing.”\n\nOf course, being Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, previously Cole, has its perks.\n\nWith more than seven million followers online, designers queuing up to dress her, and brand ambassadors desperate to endorse her, such is her popularity that Cheryl is destined to hit “national treasure” status the second she hits 50.\n\nBut being Chez has its drawbacks. While launching her solo career in 2010, she discovered her then-husband, footballer Ashley Cole, had cheated on her with a secretary.\n\nThe next evening Chez was on stage at the Brit Awards – minus wedding ring – belting out the words to her new single, the unfortunately entitled Fight For This Love.\n\nA few months later, following a holiday in Tanzania, she was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with malaria. She nearly died.\n\nThis girl is a fighter and, aptly, her fans are known as “Cheryl’s soldiers”.\n\nShe can barely sneeze without it being splashed across magazines, papers or gossip websites. And celebrity isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.\n\nShe says: “Fame is absolutely not normal by any stretch of the imagination. It’s a weird world, one you can’t understand unless you’ve experienced it. I’ve stopped expecting people to understand it.\n\n“It’s 13 years I’ve been doing this and in that time everything has changed. Showbiz years are like dog ones, so I’m about 105.\n\n“At one point it made me more cynical, definitely. But I’m over that now, and when I go home that’s my normality.”\n\nNormal for you or I might be a weekly shop, or a trip to the cinema. For Cheryl, this is no longer possible.\n\n“The last time I went to Sainsbury’s was about a year ago,” she says, ruefully.\n\n“Now I order everything online, so that they drop it to your door. I try and go out in disguise, and I’ve tried everything, but I still always get recognised.\n\n“I’ve even put gloves on to try and cover up the hand tattoos, and gone out wearing literally no make-up, see-through glasses, my hair in a centre parting and these gloves, and then, sometimes, I get someone saying, ‘Oooh, you really look like that Cheryl’.\n\n“So then I put on an accent, and just say ‘Oh really, do I?’.”\n\nAfter coming to fame in 2002 in ITV reality show Popstars: The Rivals and forming Girls Aloud alongside Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding and Nadine Coyle, she enjoyed a hugely successful 11 years with the group.\n\nAfter four number ones and a Brit Award, Cheryl went on to launch a triumphant solo career, becoming the first UK female artist to achieve five number ones.\n\nIn 2008 she replaced Sharon Osbourne on the X Factor judging panel, and was an instant hit with fans, as well as guiding Alexandra Burke to victory.\n\nThree years later, it all went horribly wrong when Cheryl was sacked within days of joining the US version of the show.\n\nShe returned to the UK series last year, and hasn’t looked back. “I’m really enjoying it, and have never laughed this much.”\n\nIn her personal life she is also happier than ever after marrying French businessman Jean-Bernard. They celebrated their first anniversary last month.\n\nClicking her fingers, she beams: “It just came around like that, and it’s all good. We went to Lake Como which was great.\n\n“I did have one eye open all the time for George Clooney and although I didn’t see him, the people there all put his name into a lot of sentences which is funny because it goes back to the whole fame thing.”\n\nFrom the council estates of Newcastle to the shores of dazzling Lake Como in Italy, the girl done good.\n\nYet she hasn’t forgotten her roots, and has set up Cheryl’s Trust to help disadvantaged young people in the North East to find employment and build self-esteem.\n\nOver the course of the next 18 months she has pledged to raise £2million to help build a centre for the charity.\n\nShe has spent six months meeting businesses in the North East, with the first initiative to be announced this month.\n\nOne in five people there is jobless, and Cheryl’s brother, Andrew, was jailed in 2011 for his part in an armed robbery, so she has witnessed first-hand the effects of crime and unemployment.\n\n“I have gone from wanting to do this to needing to do this, to give something back,” she explains. “Sadly, in Newcastle we are in dire straits and I know I’m one of the lucky ones – someone who was able to get out and get a job.\n\n“I still have friends who are struggling up there. It’s hard to watch.\n\n“My brother has been in prison but it’s not just about him. There are multiple stories like this, so many examples of things I witnessed growing up – people with depression and drug problems. The centre will be able to tackle these things.\n\n“I was working in a cafe before all this started. There is every chance I’d still be doing that if I hadn’t found the job I love.”\n\nShe pauses and grins: “Otherwise, I could literally be coming over now to audition for the Overs.”"
