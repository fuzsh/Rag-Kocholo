        "text": "I used to cover Cheryl Tweedy/Cole/Fernandez-Versini back when everyone called her Cheryl Cole. I started paying attention to her at the tail-end of her famously tumultuous marriage to footballer Ashley Cole circa 2008-2011. Ashley cheated on her, frequently from what I remember. He would cheat, they would split up, they eventually got back together. Then they split for good. Then Simon Cowell really tried to make Cheryl happen in Americaâ¦ only to have the experiment blow up in his face. He eventually fired her off of the American X-Factor, and Cheryl went back to the UK, where she quickly re-established her career as a reality show judge, celebrity personality/model and âlocal celebrity.â\n\nThen in May 2014, she met a French dude named Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. Two months later, they eloped. Because some women are just like that: dumb in love. And instead of realizing that sheâs kind of dumb in love and that she shouldnât make any rash decisions about her branding, Cheryl decided to drop her married name, Cole, for Fernandez-Versini. Thatâs when I tapped out â it was difficult enough to care about Cheryl when she was Cheryl Cole, but her latest married name made it impossible. She changed everything over to her married name and every media outlet was forced to use the total mouthful âCheryl Fernandez-Versini.â Well, a year and a half later and itâs done. Shock of all shocks, Cheryl now thinks she got married too quickly. Ya think?\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini is ‘divorcing’ her second husband Jean-Bernard after just 18 months of marriage. According to The Sunday Mirror, the 32-year-old singer has cited ‘irreconcilable differences’ as the reason for the split, which allegedly happened in August.\n\nA source told the newspaper: ‘In the end Cheryl realised she had married too soon and had been swept away by a bit of a whirlwind romance. Over time it became clear to each of them that they were very different people and from very different worlds. They are now focusing on making sure they stay friends. The divorce is amicable and they have both said they will always be there for each other.’\n\nAccording to The Sun on Sunday, The X Factor judge has ‘already begun formal legal proceedings’ in a bid to get a ‘quickie’ divorce from the restaurateur.\n\n[From The Daily Mail]\n\nDear celebrity women: this is why you donât change your professional name when you get married. Thatâs the lesson here. If you want to elope with some dude-face you just met, God bless and I hope you have great lawyers. But donât change your name, because A) youâll look like an idiot when they whole thing falls apart in a year and B) the name that made you famous is part of your branding as a celebrity. Thatâs why, after all of these years, so many people still call the Duchess of Cambridge âKate Middleton.â No one is trying to be rude, itâs just that she was famous for ten years with her maiden name and it became part of her (ânormalâ) brand. My advice to Cheryl would be to just go back to her maiden name and stay there, regardless of whether or not she ever remarries."
