According to The Sun, the star is keen to go by just ‘Cheryl’ for the moment, but is apparently considering going back to 'Cheryl Cole’, the name she took when she married footballer Ashley Cole, instead of her maiden name 'Tweedy’.  The news comes after it was confirmed that she is dating One Direction’s Liam Payne, with the 22-year-old singer taking to his Instagram page yesterday to share a snapshot of himself cuddling up to Chezza following speculation about their relationship.  It’s been said that the couple have been dating since December, just four months after Cheryl’s marriage to Jean-Bernard is said to have broken down.",
