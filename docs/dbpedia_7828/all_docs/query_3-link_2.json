        "text": "RAGING Cheryl was secretly taped in a ­furious row with her ex-husband after ordering him out of her home.\n\nNow, days after their divorce, she fears the 45-minute recording will go public and expose their marriage woes.\n\nJean-Bernard can be heard refusing to leave, leading to a massive argument between the pair, during which they hurl vile abuse at each other.\n\nCheryl, 33, had no idea the bust-up was being recorded and the tape lifts the lid on many more of the couple’s marriage secrets.\n\nSources claim the singer was stunned to discover her ex-husband’s “controlling and jealous” nature after rushing to marry him following a whirlwind romance, and the tape reveals she walked out after just five months.\n\nThe sources added that Frenchman Jean­-Bernard Fernandez-Versini “hated” her commitment to The X Factor — even demanding she quit the show.\n\nHe was reportedly so possessive that he once even warned her gay fellow judge Nick Grimshaw to “get his hands off her backside”.\n\nThe claims emerged days after the couple divorced, with one source telling The Sun on Sunday: “By the time Cheryl and JB’s marriage collapsed, their relationship was incredibly volatile.\n\n“They were constantly fighting, both in private and in public, and both felt pushed to the brink.\n\n“Cheryl had realised within five months of marrying JB that she had made a mistake, and she wanted to end things. But she felt under pressure to wait.\n\n“It was around the time that JB’s dad died, and she didn’t want to kick a man when he was down.\n\n\"But the longer the marriage dragged on, the more toxic things became between them and the more poisonous the things they both said in anger.”\n\nThe source added: “Not long after they were pictured together at Ant and Dec’s 40th birthday party last October, Cheryl tried to kick JB out of their house — but he refused.\n\n“Neither would back down and the fight turned very nasty.\n\n“JB was furious he was being forced out, and Cheryl isn’t the kind of person to just sit there and go, ‘Oh, OK then’ when she is being screamed at.\n\n“Both of them had hoped that, now that the divorce is happening, they could leave that day behind.\n\n“But the fear now for them both is that the recording somehow makes its way into the public domain and everyone can see how bad things really got.\n\n\"That would be devastating for both of them.”\n\nThe shock revelations come just days after the couple’s decree nisi was granted by the Central Family Court in London during a hearing lasting just 14 seconds.\n\nThe judge accepted that 35-year-old Jean-Bernard’s “unreasonable behaviour” was to blame for the marriage breakdown.\n\nCheryl met the Frenchman in Cannes in January 2014 and they wed just months later in a romantic ceremony on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nThe Geordie singer went on to gush about their happiness, despite drawing comments over her tiny frame as she walked The X Factor red carpet that year.\n\nAt the time, she blamed the death of her father-in-law for her sudden weight loss.\n\nBut papers lodged with the court last week said that JB was to blame for “stress and weight loss” she suffered ­during their 19-month marriage.\n\nAccusing Jean-Bernard of acting like a Svengali-type figure giving his wife career advice, the source said: “Cheryl was swept away by her romance with JB and she really wanted to marry him, settle down — and then have a family together.\n\n“But it very quickly became obvious that she didn’t know him at all.\n\n“He had managed to hide from her before that point how controlling and jealous he was capable of being. And when she found out it was a real shock.\n\n“He hated the fact she was on X Factor, as it made it harder for him to control her.\n\n“He would come along to every recording of the show that he was allowed at and would always insist on referring to her as ‘My wife’ rather than ‘Cheryl’.\n\n“It infuriated him that he wasn’t allowed at judge’s houses, or to travel with the rest of the panel.\n\n“He was constantly accusing her of spending too much time with other men and even once warned Nick to ‘Get his hands off my wife’s backside’. Those who were aware of it thought it was ludicrous.\n\n“The relationship between them was deteriorating badly month on month and Cheryl was growing thinner all the time as the stress took a hold on her.\n\n“Towards the end of 2014 they even split up. They later got back together, though they continued to row.\n\n\"Several of their rows were very public. Some of the worst took place at the X Factor studios.”\n\nThe pair’s relationship continued to deteriorate throughout last year, when they sparked speculation the marriage was over after spending months apart.\n\nCheryl managed at first to put a brave face on the breakdown, even agreeing to be pictured with her husband while wearing her wedding ring at Ant and Dec’s bash.\n\nBut sources told how, soon after, she reached the end of her tether.\n\nAnd when Jean-Bernard refused to move out of her house, she booked him into a five-star hotel in London for months on end in a bid to encourage him to pack his bags.\n\nThe source went on: “Cheryl paid for that hotel room for ages.\n\n“She was adamant by then that the marriage was over, but JB was still firmly in denial about it and was insisting that they could make things work.\n\n\"It made it very ­difficult to extricate herself from what she knew had been a disaster.\n\n“That’s why she is so pleased now that the divorce has been settled and she can move on with her life, and leave JB to get on with his. They both want a fresh start.”\n\nThe divorce came amid intense speculation that Cheryl is pregnant with boyfriend Liam Payne’s child after she was pictured with what appeared to be a baby bump.\n\nCheryl and Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, who replaced Louis Walsh on The X Factor for one year, grew close while appearing together on the panel of the ITV show.\n\nBut their friendship became a target for Jean-Bernard’s anger after he spotted a clip from the auditions which saw Nick rescue the star from a hoverboard.\n\nAs she wobbled on the surface, he stepped in to pick her up, wrapping his arms below her rear as she giggled.\n\nLashing out on Instagram, Jean-Bernard wrote: “Jimmy the grym you very funny and strong after all those hours in the gym but remember her ass is mine.”\n\nThe Frenchman later deleted the post — but not before fans had spotted it.\n\nAnd a source added: “This is a textbook example of how at times, JB let his jealousy get the better of him.\n\n\"It was clear to everyone but him that Nick and Cheryl could never be any more than good friends and that they were just having a laugh.\n\n“But he read something into it that just wasn’t there. And while that post was written in a way that could have been seen as light-hearted, it was very clear how possessive he was over Cheryl.”\n\nCheryl, who rose to fame with chart- ­toppers Girls Aloud in 2002, was originally married to former England and Arsenal footballer Ashley Cole.\n\nThe pair began dating in 2004 and announced their engagement the following year — finally tying the knot in 2006.\n\nBut in February 2010 Cheryl announced they were separating after Ashley repeatedly cheated on her.\n\nShe was granted a decree nisi in September of that year and went on to have a fling with US dancer and choreographer Derek Hough.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013 she dated another American dancer Tre Holloway, before meeting Jean—Bernard the next year.\n\nLast night a spokesman for Cheryl said: “She is not going to ­comment on any aspect of her private life”."
