        "text": "NEW name, new husband, new image, new life: it’s been quite the year for Cheryl Fernandez-Versini .\n\nLast time we met up with her – exactly 12 months ago at this very hotel in Cannes – she’d just been lifted off her Louboutins by millionaire French restaurateur Jean-Bernard.\n\nWhat we didn’t see coming was what happened next: a giddy holiday ‘fling’ that became a paradise beach wedding just three months later.\n\nToday, Cheryl’s back where it all started, once again at the Cannes Film Festival to strut her stuff for its official make-up sponsor, L’Oréal Paris.\n\nThis year, though, she and JB aren’t playing peekaboo with the paps, they’re stepping out together on the red carpet.\n\nWhen we arrive in her hotel room, there’s no sign of JB but we get a warm greeting from Cheryl who’s as friendly as ever, but confesses she’s in dire need of caffeine because she’s running on zero sleep.\n\nWe daren’t cheekily ask why, exactly, but what we can tell you is this – with her sassy new crop and the laid-back glow of a lady in lurrrve, Cheryl looks like a new woman.\n\nAnd as someone who has just begun a new chapter of her life on tropical sands, who better to welcome the arrival of summer?\n\nBut the stunning singer and TV star admits she’s not exactly the type to strut her way to her sunbed in bikini and heels – in fact, she likes to cover up.\n\nShe said: “Technically, you’re in knickers and a bra, which I always think is a little bit odd.\n\n“If I walked around in my underwear at home, my dad would be like, ‘Put some clothes on!’\n\n“So I like to wear a sarong or little pair of denim shorts to the beach, and only take them off when I’ve got my towel down and I’m ready to tan.”\n\nNot that she’s scared, mind – the red carpet is way more terrifying than strolling along a holiday beach.\n\nAnd she tends to hide herself behind a hat too – so keep your eyes peeled this summer.\n\nCheryl, 31, said: “If I wear a hat, I can usually blend in. But, to be honest, I only really go to the beach if the water is warm, I’m more of an activity girl.\n\n“On holiday I like to see the sights, or do fun things with my friends. I am actually not a sun worshipper, I get a bit anxious and bored.\n\n“Definitely the red carpet is scarier. The beach is beautiful, the negative ions from the sea put you in a good mood. I don’t get the scary adrenaline rush like the red carpet. The only downside to the beach is the paparazzi.”\n\nOf course, she’s recognised wherever she goes. But Cheryl admits she’s learned to live with the attention and copes much better now. Even if it can be a little surreal at times. She said: “I’m a lot more relaxed about it now but it never feels normal. Some girls recently asked me for a selfie in a restaurant toilet. It was weird.\n\n“If I’m at the table, there’s usually someone to say nicely, ‘She just wants to have dinner with her family’.\n\n“Or if I’ve eaten and I don’t have cabbage in my teeth, it’s completely fine.\n\n“However, in the bathroom, it was me with these three girls and I thought, ‘I have red wine lips, we are in the bathroom and no! Just no!’”\n\nYou might think that with her tiny frame and toned tum, Cheryl sticks to salad at all times, on holiday or not. But she’s as keen as the rest of us to throw aside the healthy eating regime and get stuck into some summer snacks by the pool.\n\nShe said: “There is no point going on vacation if you’re going to be on a diet. I don’t believe in diets anyway, they’re fads. If I was preparing for something big, like a movie role, I’d stick to what I needed to do. But a vacation is time to relax, have fun and not worry.\n\n“You put on a couple of pounds? Who cares? Your jeans are going to be a bit snug when you get back? So what? I can’t resist hot, salty, crispy fries with mayonnaise and ketchup. Mmm.”\n\nAdmired for her own killer bod, Cheryl has strong ideas about the perfect beach body – and it’s a good choice.\n\nShe said: “Gisele. She is freakishly beautiful. Like she’s been drawn. Because I have short legs, I do wonder what it must feel like to have legs as long as Gisele’s and see your feet so far away from your eyes. Although I don’t think I’m going to grow any taller at this point.”\n\nCheryl, as the face of L’Oréal, is a big fan of new beauty ideas, so she’s hooked on their new app this summer.\n\nShe said: “I love trying new things, which is why I’m addicted to L’Oréal’s Makeup Genius [a free phone app that applies virtual make-up on you]. I’ve been using it to try out ideas for the red carpet. Not everything suits me make-up-wise, sometimes I have ideas in my mind that don’t work in real life.\n\n“With this, I don’t have to apply make-up and then think, ‘Actually that doesn’t work on me, wipe it off.”\n\nThe beautiful singer and trained dancer loves nothing more than letting her hair down as she hits the clubs on holiday. Well, after a drink or two.\n\nShe said: “If it’s pre-drink, then I am very reserved and just enjoy the music and atmosphere. But a couple of drinks later, I’m up there – my friends can’t find me in the club, I’m dancing with strangers.\n\n“I’m one of those really happy tipsy people who just wants to have fun with everyone. My friends will say, ‘Where were you?’ and I’ll have made friends with a group of girls in the corner on my own.\n\n“I was impressed with myself the other day when a song came on and I could remember the words. [Breaks into song]: ‘The Venga Bus is coming. And everybody’s jumping’. Thank you, brain. I can’t remember what I did yesterday but I still know every word to Vengaboys songs.”\n\nOf course, her days of globetrotting and high-end hotels are a far cry from growing up in Newcastle. In fact, her childhood version of a holiday doesn’t sound like much fun.\n\nShe said: “We didn’t go on holidays. Never. Newcastle is coastal, so we’d go to Tynemouth Cullercoats Beach for days out, but it’s freezing the best part of the time, we’re not talking tropical holidays. We used to pick these sea snails off the rocks, you’d take off the eyes and boil them and eat them. It’s vile.”\n\nNo wonder she’s delighted with how life has turned out.\n\nCheryl said: “I have done some pretty sh*tty jobs, I’ve worked since I was 15 in cafés and stuff like that, but it’s all life experience.\n\n“I wouldn’t be able to appreciate the luxuries I have now without it. Sometimes it scares me how fortunate I am.”"
