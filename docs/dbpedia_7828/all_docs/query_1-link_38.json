        "text": "Pop singer Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has become the first British female solo artist to have five number one singles in the UK.\n\nHer latest song, I Don't Care, entered the Official Charts in pole position on Sunday.\n\nThe 31-year-old overtook Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora, who both have four chart-toppers.\n\n\"To be honest, I'm a little bit shell-shocked,\" she told BBC Radio 1's Jameela Jamil, who revealed the record.\n\nThe star gave the credit for the chart achievement to \"my supporters and the fans that have done everything they could to get it here\".\n\nPreviously known as Cheryl Cole, the X Factor judge married French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in June.\n\nShe previously scored four number ones with her former band, Girls Aloud, between 2002 and 2008.\n\nHer solo number ones are Fight For This Love (2009), Promise This (2010), Call My Name (2012) and Crazy Stupid Love (2014). Of those, only Fight For This Love remained at the top for a second week.\n\nAnd while she holds the chart record for a British female artist, Fernandez-Versini has a long way to go before she can beat Madonna, who has 13 UK number ones, and Rihanna, who has eight.\n\nElsewhere in the charts, Tom Odell scored a new entry at 21 with his cover of John Lennon's Real Love, which features on this year's John Lewis Christmas advert."
