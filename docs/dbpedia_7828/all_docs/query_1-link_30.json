        "text": "TV personality Kelly Brook has replaced X Factor judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini as the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to a cybercrime study.\n\nFor the ninth year in a row, Intel Security has researched popular culture’s most famous people to reveal which of them generates the most dangerous search results.\n\nThe study revealed that searches for certain musicians and models tend to expose internet searchers in the UK to more possible viruses and malware.\n\nCheryl dropped from first place in last year’s list to 18th place this year, suggesting her new marital surname could have made her a little safer online.\n\nThis is Kelly Brook’s first time in the list of the most dangerous celebrities and, by topping the poll, she beats the likes of Katie Price, Victoria Beckham and Cheryl’s fellow X Factor judges Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora.\n\nThe top ten most dangerous celebrities were a mix of musical artists, TV personalities, actors and models.\n\nCybercriminals are always looking for ways to take advantage of consumer interest around popular culture events, including talent shows, movies premieres, album releases and celebrity breakups.\n\n>See also: Cheryl Cole has the hack factor: Top 10 most dangerous online searches\n\nThey capitalise on this interest by enticing unsuspecting consumers to sites laden with malware.\n\n“The desire for consumers to have access to the latest celebrity gossip can often make them vulnerable to cybercrime,” said Nick Viney, VP of consumer, mobile and small business at Intel Security. “Most consumers are unaware of the potential risks they are exposing themselves to by clicking on sites that provide them with the latest news and entertainment.\n\n“But cybercriminals are quick to exploit this desire for breaking celebrity news, leading consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices and steal their private data.”\n\nPeople looking to download free music and films may be especially at risk. Celebrity names combined with the terms ‘free MP4’, ‘HD downloads’ or ‘torrent’ are some of the most searched terms on the internet, and when consumers search for music that is not made available through legitimate channels, they put both their digital lives and devices at risk.\n\nThis desire for the latest music and film release is evidenced by four musicians and three actors featuring in the top 20 – with Tom Hardy squeezing into the top ten – while Cara Delevigne and Kate Moss at 14th and 15th, respectively, represent the model profession on the list.\n\n10 most dangerous celebrities to search for online"
