        "text": "Chalk it up to \"Crazy Stupid Love.\"\n\nBritish pop star Cheryl Cole revealed Sunday that she secretly wed Frenchman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. In a statement posted to her website and various social media accounts, she wrote, \"I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news...Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14. We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together.\"\n\nThe X Factor U.K. judge included a close-up picture of her wedding rings with the statement.\n\nThe Girls Aloud singer, 31, and the restaurateur, 33, reportedly tied the knot on a beach in Mustique. Per the European media, four guests attended the ceremony, including Cole's mother, Joan Callaghan.\n\nThe couple began dating in April and made their public debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May.\n\nJean-Bernard, who once studied business administration at New York University, was reportedly eager to marry the \"Fight for This Love\" chart topper just two months into their relationship. Moving into Cheryl's U.K. pad last month fueled that fire. \"He's a very impulsive guy,\" a source told The Mirror. \"He thinks the two of them are perfect together and would love to marry her. To people who don't know him it might seem rushed, but he's a passionate Frenchmanâ€”he wears his heart on his sleeve.\"\n\nApparently so!"
