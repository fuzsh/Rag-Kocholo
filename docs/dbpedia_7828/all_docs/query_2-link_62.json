I know it seems like she is trying to phase out the use of Cole (on twitter, instagram etc) but that's not the same thing as becoming Fernandez-Versini.\n\nRe: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nInteresting that the title of this thread has been changed without Cheryl publicly announcing that she's taking her husband's name or it being used in any publicity material.

Seeing as she hasn't got rid of her ex husbands name.. I wouldn't be surprised if her current husband has told her to get rid of the Cole as that associates her with another man and it's not his surname. Fair enough if 'Cole' was her maiden name but it's not.\n\nRe: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nYes she should take her husbands name..

Fair enough if 'Cole' was her maiden name but it's not.\n\n\"Should\"? That's Cheryl's decision and only Cheryl's.\n\nRe: Cheryl - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nI was watching a Selena Gomez interview where she calls Cheryl \"the British Britney\", obviously Cheryl is no where near as good as Britney was. She does ooze star quality though, more so than Jessie J, Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding or any of the current crop of female British stars. I honestly don't know why she isn't a Worldwide star.\n\nI can't believe the stir her marriage has caused, some of the things I've read on Twitter are horrible. It's obvious she was completely heartbroken by Ashley, and now she's found love again she's grabbed it with both hands, good on her I say.\n\nRe: Cheryl - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nShe does ooze star quality though, more so than Jessie J, Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding or any of the current crop of female British stars.

If all it took to become a worldwide star was to outshine charisma vortex Rita Ora or the recurring nightmare that is Jessie J, I imagine she'd stroll it. You have to carve out some sort of identity for yourself to become a worldwide star, something which Cheryl shows no sign of doing four albums in.\n\nRe: Cheryl - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nGetting married to someone after 3 months is ridiculous and she deserves the ridicule. You absolutely do not know a person after that short a space of time. They're idiots for thinking otherwise but good luck to them figuring it out along the way and I hope they've not made a stupid mistake, but the odds are against them.\n\nRe: Cheryl - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nUnfortunately, I think Cheryl's voice does hold her back from 'Worldwide Stardom.' Those other British snooze-fests lack the charisma, but they can at least pass off as singers. Cheryl worked great in the context of a girl group. She has a unique and recognizable voice, but it is very limited. Obviously, Britney can't sing well, but has had the top songwriters and producers behind her from the get-go in addition to once-in-a-generation charisma. I just don't buy Cheryl as a solo artist. I always get the sense that she is sort of 'pretending' to be a pop star.\n\nUS here looking from the outside: I don't think anyone who isn't already invested in her personal life or celebrity will give any attention to her mediocre music. She still hasn't delivered a true mega-hit to transcend a gimmick coordinated with her story (\"Fight for This Love\" = Ashley's infidelity, \"Promise This\" = Malaria, \"Crazy Stupid Love\" = Fernandez-Michael Lucas whatever). \"Call My Name\" may be the closest thing, but would still sound like a \"We Found Love\" knockoff to anyone who didn't know who she was.\n\nRe: Cheryl - Crazy Stupid Love (Single) + Only Human (Album)\n\nIn some cultures, people get married to people they've never even met and they still have happy marriages. I don't think the odds are against any more than if they'd known each other for 3 years. A celebrity marriage seems tough.\n\nI would bet against a marriage to a \"nightclub entrepreneur\" playboy, though."
