        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versin has reportedly made her estranged husband Jean Bernard Fernandez-Versini sign a confidentiality agreement to stop him publicly discussing their former relationship.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the 33 year-old singer set up a 'vice-like' deal for the French restaurateur as she feared he would speak out about both their time together and her professional life. The newspaper reported that Cheryl, who quit The X Factor earlier this year, was worried her estranged spouse would reveal secrets about her time on the show.\n\nJean Bernard, who married the former Girls Aloud star in 2014, agreed to sign the confidentiality agreement which prevents him from speaking out about his time with Cheryl and anything to do with her professional life after being warned he could face a huge legal bill.\n\nA source close to the 35 year old businessman told The Sun: \"JB just wanted to have the freedom to speak but he knew that he couldn't fight against Cheryl's lawyers. They are too powerful and too expensive.\"\n\n\"He doesn't have the money for a long drawn out legal battle and Cheryl is adamant she doesn't want him to speak about their relationship and about The X Factor,\" revealed the source. \"The agreement he has had to sign is vice-like. It is watertight and if he speaks out about their marriage or anything he will be in front of a judge.\"\n\nThe pair separated in January after 18 months of marriage and Cheryl is now in a relationship with One Direction hunk Liam Payne.\n\nSOURCE: The Sun\n\nOn 18 April 2016, we wrote...\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini has responded to \"sh*t\" claims that she started her relationship with new boyfriend Liam Payne while she was still with ex, Jean Bernard.\n\nClaims said that Cheryl had begun her relationship with One Direction star Liam Payne while she was still with her husband. Rumours came as the pair were seen attending Ant and Dec's 40th birthday party in October.\n\nResponding to the cheating claims on her Twitter, Cheryl said: \"If anybody believes the shit they're reading today you really don't know me at all.\"\n\nJean Bernard also reportedly made a dig at his ex on his private Instagram account, saying: \"Certain people that love to say that they don't comment on their private life can't help themselves but to justify themselves which for me seems even more strange…\"\n\nThe couple filed for divorce in January.\n\nOn 11 January 2016, we wrote...\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini has announced her divorce from husband Jean-Bernard after 18 months of marriage.\n\nAccording to The Sunday Mirror, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for their split.\n\nIt has been claimed by a source that the relationship actually ended five months ago in August. The source explained: \"In the end Cheryl realised she had married too soon and had been swept away by a bit of a whirlwind romance.\"\n\nThey went on: \"Over time it became clear to each of them that they were very different people and from very different worlds. They are now focusing on making sure they stay friends. The divorce is amicable and they have both said they will always be there for each other.\"\n\nAnother source has claimed that the marriage ended because Cheryl had had enough of his jealousy: \"[Jean-Bernard] didn't like it when she had to spend time with other men and even became jealous when she was hanging out with her dogs.\" Dogs?!\n\nCheryl is yet to comment on the divorce though she posted this Instagram photo on New Years Eve:\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nShe captioned the photo: \"Bye 2015... you've been real!!!!! You have taught me a lot but I am happy to see the back of you !! .. Happy New Year everyone.. I hope this year brings you everything you wished for & is filled with happiness, love & laughter! Wishing you a happy, healthy & prosperous new year.\" A reference to the split, perhaps?\n\nThis will be Cheryl's second divorce after her marriage from Ashley Cole ended in 2010."
