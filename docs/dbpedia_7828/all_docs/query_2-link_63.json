        "text": "X Factor judge and former wife of footballer Ashley Cole, Cheryl “Cole” has reportedly married a French restaurant entrepreneur, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, on 7th July 2014. Her spokesman confirmed that she has adopted her new husband’s surname to become Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, finally leaving behind her ex-husband’s name which she retained for several years following their divorce back in 2010. Although she had previously tried to reinvent herself for publicity and marketing purposes as “Cheryl” she never legally changed her name.\n\nA wedding announced on social media\n\nAfter what was rumoured to be a mere three months of dating, the pair exchanged their vows on a beach on the island of Mustique with only four guests in attendance. Cheryl announced the news on her website and Instagram page, where she changed her username to “misscheryl”. On another social media channel, Twitter, she changed her name from @CherylCole to @CherylOfficial, making a clear statement that she no longer wishes to be associated with her former name. Whether or not the press will embrace this intention remains to be seen!\n\nDid she refuse a pre-nup?\n\nIn a statement, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said “I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news... Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14 … We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together.” Other than that, very few details have been revealed. However, it has been reported that the former Girls Aloud singer refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement (as was the case when she married Ashley Cole) which is rare when it comes to celebrities. It’s even more surprising in light of the speculation that the marriage was the culmination of a whirlwind romance.\n\nGetting your own set of pre-nups"
