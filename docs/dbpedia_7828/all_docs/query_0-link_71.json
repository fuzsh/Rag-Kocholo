        "text": "Singer Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's husband has accepted substantial privacy damages over a \"very upsetting\" magazine article about his family life.\n\nJean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini took legal action against National Magazine Company Ltd, the publisher of Reveal magazine, over the three-page story.\n\nHis solicitor told a High Court judge that, despite his wife's fame, he had no wish to be a public figure.\n\nReveal said it expressed regret for the distress and hurt it caused.\n\nMr Fernandez-Versini married the 31-year-old X Factor judge - better known by her previous name Cheryl Cole - in July.\n\nThe magazine's article detailed his childhood, his life in France, where he was brought up, and gave information about his father, late mother, their personal finance and relationships.\n\n'Unnecessary intrusion'\n\nSolicitor Callum Galbraith said the \"deeply intrusive\" article caused particular distress because he had actively sought to avoid the media's glare.\n\n\"Publicity was the inevitable, but avoidable, consequence for the claimant in so far as Reveal's article is concerned,\" Mr Galbraith said.\n\n\"Despite describing the article as the product of an investigation, at its core was a combination of speculation, gossip and private information.\n\n\"As Reveal now accepts, the article constituted an unjustifiable and unnecessary intrusion into the claimant's private and family life.\n\n\"The only reason for it being published at all was the fame and notoriety of the claimant's wife which is, of course, no justification for a publication that in truth should never have been made. Reveal now accepts this.\"\n\nThe sum paid has not been disclosed. Reveal's solicitor Aimee Nisbet said it would not republish the article or any similar information about Mr Fernandez-Versini in the future.\n\nNeither Mr Fernandez-Versini nor his wife were at the hearing."
