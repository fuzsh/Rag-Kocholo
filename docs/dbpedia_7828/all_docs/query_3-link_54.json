        "text": "Lifelong Labour voter Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has signalled she might take her vote elsewhere.\n\nThe multi-millionaire singer and X Factor judge told the Daily Telegraph she felt more responsibility to vote in the general election now that she paid a \"fucking lot of tax\".\n\nThe newspaper claimed that she said Labour's mansion tax on homes worth more than £2 million would \"fuck her over\" – although her spokeswoman said that comment had been taken \"out of context\".\n\nFernandez-Versini, who grew up on a council estate in Newcastle, said: \"I know there are people out there who think, 'Oh yeah, someone with money telling us that money doesn't matter,' but the truth is I've experienced both.\"\n\n\"There are big downsides that come with having money,\" she said.\n\n\"As many as with not having money. I mean, they're different types of stresses, but they're both stresses.\"\n\nAsked whether she would consider voting for David Cameron, she added: \"Not really. I want to hear what everyone's got to say. I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself.\n\n\"Now that I'm a mature woman, I feel like a greater responsibility now to vote for who runs our country. And I pay a fucking lot of tax. So I think that I need to have a really well-informed, well-educated opinion.\"\n\nShe also hinted she could enter politics herself, suggesting she could \"make my own party\".\n\nFernandez-Versini isn't the first high-profile figure to raise fears about Labour.\n\nLast year singer Myleene Klass had a pop at Ed Miliband over the mansion tax, telling him: \"You may as well tax me on this glass of water\".\n\nWildlife presenter Bill Oddie said he would vote Green rather than Labour in protest at the same levy. And TV duo Ant and Dec said they weren't convinced about Miliband as prime minister."
