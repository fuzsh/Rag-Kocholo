        "text": "When Cheryl Fernandez-Versini married Jean-Bernard in July 2014 after a whirlwind two-month romance, fans hoped she’d finally found her fairy-tale ending.\n\nBut by November, cracks seemed to be showing. JB wasn’t seen at the X Factor – the pair haven’t been pictured in public together since October – and a fragile-looking Cheryl broke down in tears live on the show.\n\nThe couple are now thought to be spending time apart, while trying to decide their next move. Insiders tell Closer the marriage began to crumble because the reality just didn’t seem to live up to their dreams.\n\nA source says: “JB thought they’d live a glamorous, pop star life, hanging out in LA. But Cheryl’s work life is so hectic, when she has time off she wants to catch up on sleep and watch TV. He felt it was the opposite of what she’d said to him at the start – that she wished she could travel the world as a normal person and have a wonderful social life. The reality didn’t end up being quite as exciting.”\n\nAnd it seems Cheryl was left disappointed, too. A source says: “At the start, JB was enthusiastic about having a family and seemed happy moving to the UK to be with her, but then he preferred socialising to cosy nights in. She felt that when reality kicked in, things started to fall apart.”"
