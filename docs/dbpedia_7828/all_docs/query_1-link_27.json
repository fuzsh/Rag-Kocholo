        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is planning to keep her married name after her divorce from husband Jean-Bernard, it has been claimed.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThere'll Be No Girls Aloud Reunion At Kimberley's Wedding\n\nSarah Harding Gives Her Verdict On Cheryl's Split\n\nCheryl's Husband Breaks Online Silence Following Divorce Reports\n\nThe ‘Call My Name’ singer is reportedly about to end her marriage with the French restaurateur, just 15 months after tying the knot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it has now been suggested she will keep his name rather than reverting back to her maiden name ‘Tweedy’ or previous surname ‘Cole’, with The Sun claiming she feels it is more in keeping with her life in 2016.\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini\n\nAn insider told the newspaper: “Cheryl has had to reinvent herself several times but her three past names all have very different memories.\n\n“Tweedy is associated with her assault court case, Cole with [ex-husband] Ashley’s cheating and now her new name with another failed marriage.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter splitting with footballer Ashley Cole in 2010, Cheryl retained her married name, claiming at the time that changing it back would make it appear that she was “ashamed” of the marriage.\n\nShe later changed her name professionally to simply Cheryl, which her last two albums, ‘A Million Lights’ and ‘Only Human’ were released under.\n\nFollowing weeks of speculation about of her marriage, various reports last week claimed that the pair were planning to divorce.\n\nAlthough Cheryl is yet to acknowledge the rumours, she has since made several public appearances, including at the hen night of former Girls Aloud bandmate, Kimberley Walsh."
