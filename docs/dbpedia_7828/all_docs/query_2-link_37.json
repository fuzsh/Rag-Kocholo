        "text": "What is Cheryl going by these days?\n\nShe’s probably most famous as Cole, the surname of her first husband, professional football player Ashley Cole. But in the 15 years we’ve known of her, she’s chopped and changed a fair few times.\n\nThe 33-year-old has been married twice and is now in a relationship with Liam Payne – so what exactly is she going by these days?\n\nTweedy?\n\nCheryl bounced onto our screens in 2002 as the fresh-faced 19-year-old who attempted to woo the Popstars: The Rivals judges with her shakey rendition of S Club 7’s Have You Ever (great choice, btw).\n\nHer vocals weren’t exactly on point, but the judges were so taken with her beauty that she sailed through.\n\n‘You have the most beautiful eyes and skin,’ Pete Waterman told her, before the three, including Louis Walsh and Geri Horner, put her through to the next round.\n\nAnd thus the name Cheryl Tweedy became ingrained in our minds thanks to our Saturday night TV, along with Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberly Walsh.\n\nCole?\n\nIn 2006 she married footballer Ashley Cole at the height of her Girls Aloud fame.\n\nThat lasted four years, before they split amid claims he cheated on her. In May she filed for divorce citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’.\n\nShe carried on using the monika though, as it seemed to be the one that most people associated with her.\n\nJust Cheryl?\n\nIn roughly 2012 Cheryl opted to drop her last name – who needs a surname when you’re that famous anyway? If it’s good enough for Cher, Madonna, Prince and Rihanna. So she then began going by the name Cheryl, with her reps sending emails to the press to state that from now on she should only be referred to as Cheryl.\n\nIt didn’t really stick though, did it?\n\nFernandez-Versini?\n\nIn 2014 she married Jean Bernard Fernandez-Versini after a whirlwind three month romance, taking on his name immediately and giving the X Factor voiceover guy a nice mouthful to introduce when she appeared back on the show.\n\nShe kind of became Cheryl F-V, just to save time.\n\nNope it’s just Cheryl, again\n\nBut alas, the name and marriage wasn’t to last, with the couple splitting 18 months later in December 2015, with their divorce being finalised in October 2016. So she ditched the F-V and went back to being Just Cheryl. They were granted a decree nisi in just 14 seconds.\n\nA source told The Mirror: ‘Cheryl wants to wipe the slate clean and start afresh with a new name, now the divorce is going through.’\n\nBasically, she has no surname. Well, she has a surname obviously, she can’t just have ‘Cheryl’ emblazoned across a credit card, but as far as the public are aware, she’s is just Cheryl.\n\nThe Sun claim she filed documents through her company CC Couture Ltd under the name Fernandez-Versini at the end of last year, so it seems like her last marital name is still on her official documents.\n\nA source told the paper: ‘Cheryl has had to reinvent herself several times but her three past names all have very different memories.\n\n‘Tweedy is associated with her assault court case, Cole with Ashley’s cheating and now her new name with another failed marriage.’\n\nBut still, she started dating Liam Payne at the beginning of 2016, and with a baby on the way, there’s no doubt another change in surname could be on the cards.\n\nWant more of this lovely stuff?
