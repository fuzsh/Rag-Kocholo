We have a kid together; there's a lot more to our life.'\n\nThe couple welcomed a son, Bear Payne, in March and held a 'meet the baby' party for him earlier this month. A spokesperson for Cheryl has also confirmed the news of her name change to MailOnline.\n\nCheryl took ex-husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini's last name when they married in 2014, but since their divorce she has gone by her first name only professionally. Before Fernandez-Versini, she went by Ashley Cole's surname from their marriage in 2006, keeping his name after their divorce in 2010.\n\nAlthough she once vowed she wouldn't go back to her maiden name after her divorce from Ashley Cole, it seems she's changed her mind.\n\nWe wonder if she'll become Cheryl Payne any time soon?"
