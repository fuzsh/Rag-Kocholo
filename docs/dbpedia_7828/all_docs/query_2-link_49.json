        "text": "It’s been a long time since Cheryl was known as Cheryl Tweedy, but the star has come full circle after officially reverting back to her maiden name.\n\nHer boyfriend Liam Payne made the revelation about the former Mrs Cole and Mrs Fernandez-Versini during an interview on Radio 1Xtra on Friday.\n\nThe 23-year-old explained that Cheryl has legally changed her name after failed marriages to footballer Ashley Cole and French businessman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.\n\nHe said: “Her name is officially Cheryl Tweedy now, but to be honest it doesn’t really bother me, we have a kid together, there’s a lot more to our life.”\n\nCheryl’s spokesperson confirmed the name change, but insisted she would still only be known by her first name professionally.\n\nA spokesperson told MailOnline: “Cheryl has been using her first name professionally for some time now and will continue to do so.”\n\nCheryl married Premier league footballer Ashely Cole in July 2006 in a lavish wedding paid for by OK! Magazine.\n\nThe pair had been dating since 2004, but split in 2010 amid claims he had cheated on her. They were divorced in September the same year.\n\nShe then tied-the-knot with French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014 after only three months of dating, but the pair had split by early 2016 with divorce papers being filed soon after."
