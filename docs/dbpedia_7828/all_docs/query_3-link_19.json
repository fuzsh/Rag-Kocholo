        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has broken her silence after threatening legal action over a photo showing light reflection was mistaken for a 'mysterious white powder'.\n\nThe X Factor judge posted a cryptic message to her Instagram account this afternoon criticising people who are concerned with \"ego, money and status\".\n\nEarlier today The Mirror obtained an exclusive image proving the star's innocence amid the photo storm.\n\nCheryl reposted a message to her Instagram page which read: \"Hold on to every genuine person you find. This generation has people driven by ego, money and status.\n\n\"As a result good souls are ruined daily. Keep your head up and be conscious of the energy you give out and connect with.\"\n\nAlongside the message Cheryl wrote: \"So true... #positivevibes only. Squeezing my [soldiers] tight!! Love you.\"\n\nThe Mirror has obtained an exclusive image of the area where the star was washing her hands at the London Coliseum during the British Fashion Awards on Monday night when a journalist snapped her in front of three bright lines of light.\n\nIt is clear the spotlights above the ledge in the picture created the mysterious white image which was mistaken for white powder.\n\nX Factor judge Cheryl is now preparing to take legal action after the pic of her at the star-studded annual bash surfaced online, leading to speculation.\n\nThe fashion journalist posted the photo along with the caption: \"Sadness in her eyes\". It was later deleted.\n\nThe 32-year-old star has always been strongly opposed to drugs, and previously admitted she was put off taking them after the death of her close friend, footballer John Courtney.\n\n\"It put me off drugs for life. That nightmare devastated all John's family and friends,\" she wrote in 2008 in Cheryl Cole: Her Story - The Unauthorised Biography.\n\nShe has also previously hit out at Kate Moss and Pete Doherty, who have been linked to drug use, saying: \"To see pictures of [Pete] Doherty glamourising the habit, and with Kate Moss on his arm, too. It makes me sick.\"\n\nA source close to the star told The Sun yesterday: \"It's outrageous that someone in the fashion industry has taken a picture of Cheryl like this and posted it publicly.\n\n\"She absolutely despises drugs and any connection linking her to them is ridiculous. She was just using the toilet.\""
