        "text": "Singer Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's husband has accepted substantial damages over an article about his private life in Reveal magazine.\n\nJean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini regarded the three-page article, \"The 'shy and quiet' past of Cheryl's new husband\", as a violation of his privacy.\n\nThe feature detailed his childhood and his life in France where he was raised. It revealed information about his father, his late mother, their personal finances, relationships and feelings about each other.\n\nHe took legal action against Reveal's publisher, the National Magazine Company, which is the UK division of the US company, Hearst.\n\nHis solicitor told a high court judge that, despite his wife's fame, he had no wish to be a public figure.\n\nFernandez-Versini married the 31-year-old X Factor judge - who is better known by her previous name, Cheryl Cole - in July.\n\nThe publisher accepted that the article invaded his privacy, apologised and expressed regret for the distress it caused him.\n\nHearst agreed to pay substantial damages and his legal costs. It was reported by the Daily Mail that he had sought damages of Â£100,000 for the breach of his human rights.\n\nThe couple did not attend the hearing."
