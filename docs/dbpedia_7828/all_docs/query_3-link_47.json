        "text": "Image: Getty\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini (nee Cole) and Liam Payne have welcomed their first child.\n\nThe couple announced the birth of their son on Instagram, each taking to their own account to share a photo of the One Direction star cradling the tiny baby, revealing he was born on March 22 and doesn’t have a name just yet.\n\nImage: Liam Payne via Instagram\n\n“My close friends and family know there are very few times when I’m left speechless… wow!” Liam, 23, captioned the photo. “I’m incredibly happy to welcome our new baby boy into the world, it’s a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life and my favourite memory I have so far.”\n\nHe also made a beautiful tribute to Cheryl, 33.\n\n“I’m completely in awe of his incredible mother and how she has been the whole way through this, she’s really made my dreams come true.\n\n“We haven’t named him yet but he’s already capturing hearts including mine. I feel very blessed.”\n\nMeanwhile former girl band member turned TV personality Cheryl was equally moved.\n\n“On Wednesday 22nd March Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy, weighing 7lb 9 and looking like a dream. Although he still doesn’t have a name he is already stealing hearts. We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival.”\n\nThe pair are believed to have started dating in December 2015 when Fernandez-Versini divorced her husband, Frenchman Jean-Bernard after 19 months of marriage. Liam, who is now worth a reported £25million first met Fernandez-Versini in 2010 when he was just 17-years-old and a contestant on the UK’s X Factor television show, in which his now-girlfriend was a judge.\n\nThey’ve certainly got a great meeting story for their son when he’s old enough to hear it."
