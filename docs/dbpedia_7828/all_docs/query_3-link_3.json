As the X Factor judge has began legal proceedings to divorce her second husband, take a look back at her rollercoaster love life with exes including Ashley Cole and professional dancer Derek Hough.\n\nJean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini (May 2014 - Jan 2016):\n\nCheryl married Jean-Bernard in July 2014 after a three-month relationship\n\nCheryl left fans stunned in July 2014 when she revealed that she had secretly tied the knot with French restaurateur Jean-Bernard after a whirlwind three month relationship. The singer shared her happy news with a photo of her engagement and wedding ring on Instagram, adding the caption: \"I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news… Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14…\"\n\nWhile the couple appeared truly happy together and reportedly bought a £4 million mansion in North London over the summer, their marriage has been rocked by split rumours since November as the couple spent increasingly long periods of time apart.\n\nAs well as deleting an Instagram photo of her husband over Christmas, Cheryl further fuelled rumours that she and Jean-Bernard had parted ways with a cryptic message on New Year's Day, writing: \"Bye 2015… you've been real!!!!! You have taught me a lot but I am happy to see the back of you!!\"\n\nTre Holloway (August 2012 – October 2013):\n\nCheryl dated US dancer Tre Holloway for a year\n\nCheryl dated US dancer Tre Holloway for around a year after meeting when she performed her single Promise This on the X Factor in 2010. The couple went public with their relationship in August 2012 and Cheryl was even said to be considering moving to America to live with him, however ultimately they are said to have struggled to maintain a long-distance relationship.\n\nSpeaking about her dancer boyfriend back in November 2012, Cheryl said: \"There is a stronger connection and a chemistry you wouldn't have with any other dancer. To have that relationship is rare, to be able to have it with you and share those moments is pretty special actually.\"\n\nDerek Hough (2010):\n\nDerek Hough has confirmed he dated Cheryl after her divorce from Ashley Cole\n\nCheryl struck up a close friendship with Dancing with the Stars professional dancer Derek after he starred in her Parachute music video in 2009. The pair were said to have begun dating the following year after Cheryl split from her husband Ashley Cole, with Derek whisking her away on a romantic holiday to Tanzania in June 2010.\n\nWhile the pair never confirmed their romance at the time, Derek has since revealed that he did briefly date the former Girls Aloud star, revealing: \"We dated for a while. Absolutely we are still friends, we are very close.\"\n\nAshley Cole (2004 - May 2010):\n\nVIEW GALLERY\n\nCheryl was married to Ashley Cole for three-and-a-half years\n\nCheryl first met footballer Ashley Cole when they both moved into the same apartment block in North London in 2004. The pair soon began dating and tied the knot in July 2006 after a year-long engagement.\n\nTheir marriage was rocked by a string of infidelity allegations, but Cheryl stood by Ashley before ultimately filing for divorce in May 2010. Reflecting on the split in October, Cheryl told InStyle: \"To be honest, I coped in public and crumbled in private.\""
