        "text": "During this weekend's X Factor, we were treated to performances from John Legend and judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.\n\nAs per usual people took to Twitter to express their thoughts and feelings on her performance.\n\n\"Unforgiveable\" and \"disgusting\" were just two comments as many felt she was miming her new song I Don't Care.\n\nBut according to her spokesperson, she wasn't and she \"did sing live\".\n\nNewsbeat got this statement from a spokesperson from the X Factor.\n\n\"The performance was pre-recorded about 30 minutes ahead of it going out.\n\n\"This was because of the big set build with lighting rig as there wasn't time for it to be all built and then taken down within the live schedule given everything else we had to fit in on the show.\"\n\nSo technically, the version that people at home saw was the pre-recorded live performance done 30 minutes earlier."
