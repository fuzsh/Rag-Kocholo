        "text": "She was born Cheryl Tweedy, then became Cheryl Cole, then Cheryl Fernandez-Versini...and now she’s officially gone full-circle and reverted back to her maiden name.\n\nEarlier this year Liam Payne said Cheryl would go back to being Cheryl Tweedy, but for the first time she has used her maiden name in official paperwork.\n\nIn documents for her company, CC Couture, which have just been made public, Cheryl signed off the paper work with her former name. Tweedy is back!\n\nIn May Liam said: \"Her name is officially Cheryl Tweedy now, but to be honest it doesn't really bother me, we have a kid together, there's a lot more to our life.\"\n\nBefore her relationship with Liam, Cheryl was married to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. They met in Cannes in 2014, and tied the knot just twelve weeks later – making her Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.\n\nAfter 19 months, however, they divorced.\n\nYears before in 2006, Cheryl became Cheryl Cole after marrying ex-England footballer Ashley Cole.\n\nBUT she announced she would be splitting from Ashley in 2010, citing “unreasonable behaviour.”\n\nThey divorced after four years of marriage, but Chezza kept the name despite the failed relationship – until she married Jean Bernard in 2014.\n\nCheryl Cole is probs her most well-known name: during this time Girls Aloud were at the height of their career.\n\nFor a while after divorcing Jean Bernard she dropped the surname and was just known as Cheryl – this was the name she used when releasing new music.\n\nFast forward to today and we have Cheryl Tweedy again, happy with Liam and their little son baby Bear.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nCheryl just threw mega shade at One Direction\n\nSam Smith spotted kissing this 13 Reasons Why actor"
