        "text": "Cheryl Cole is a British pop singer who got famous by a TV reality show after winning a place in a pop group called Girls Aloud. She achieved success with the group and subsequently as a solo artist. Her body is often on the press along with her love life. When she first started out she was quite slim but then along with her bandmates she lost weight and became skinny. Her weight fluctuates a lot. You can read more on her here if interested\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Cole.\n\nI just wanted to know what you guys think of her as a person and her body? Personally, I don't know whether she's genuine or not and am still trying to figure that out. A lot of people here love her or just completely annoyed by her. I liked her a lot in the beginning and still hold a soft spot for her because of her ex-husband infidelities and the whole X factor thing. I really wanted her to do well across the pond. Not a fan of her as a singer, and as for her body not really a fan either. I think she's an average pretty girl, a bit too barbie like for me and glammed up way too often.\n\nCheryl on the far right, with her bandmates.\n\nI think this was just after she won the TV show to be the band or shortly after the success of her band. Her boobs are huge here!\n\nMost recent picture, she's definitely quite a bit of weight here.\n\nShe fluctuates a lot, plus I think she never was that stage of skinny one should have worried about her condition (the media made quite a fuzz about it anyway, like they always do)\n\nI would have never heard of her if I hadn´t started reading some UK newspapers some time ago to improve my english (not sure about the effects )\n\nHer bandmate Nadine Coyle used to be really skinny about a year ago, but I think both of them didn´t look that good, it looked rather unnatural and forced."
