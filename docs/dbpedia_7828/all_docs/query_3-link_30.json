        "text": "The sad news that Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and her husband of 18 months, Jean-Bernard, were reportedly planning to divorce broke in recent days, and we're gutted for them. Following Cheryl's first marriage to footballer Ashley Cole, which ended in divorce after he cheated on her, we hoped Cheryl might have found true happiness in JB.\n\nBut, as for many people, that wasn't to be. And if reports are to be believed, the pair are currently in the process of splitting.\n\nThe only problem is, what the bloody hell is Cheryl going to be called? With her maiden name being Tweedy, she changed to Cheryl Cole when she married Ashley.\n\nSticking with the name Cole even after their divorce, Chezza was probably glad to ditch it when she got hitched again, and became the super-swanky sounding Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Darling.\n\nBut NOW what the eff is she going to do? There's only so many times you can reinvent yourself in showbusiness.\n\nThe Fernandez-Versinis in their happier days\n\nWell we know what we think she should go by the name of, and we've been calling her it for months. Cheryl Regina-Phalange is obviously a much more sensible option, not only harking back to some great days of comedy (thanks, Friends) but also sticking with the sophistication of her recently-acquired double-barrelled surname. It's ideal.\n\nBut for some reason she's not paying attention to what we want, and is apparently opting to stick with the initials CF-V for the forseeable. Can't be even the tiniest bit persuaded to go for CR-P, no? It's got a ring to it. #Justsaying.\n\nThe Sun has reported that while signing recent documents, Chez retained her most recent marital name, indicating that perhaps that is what she's planning to stick with. Having said that, though, she's not actually divorced yet, so she still is Cheryl Fernandez-Versini in the eyes of the law, even if she didn't want to be.\n\nSo it remains to be seen what she'll go with. Maybe she should sack them all off and just be 'Cheryl'. That would save a feckload of bother."
