        "text": "I took my sons seal-watching at the weekend off the Norfolk coast. That’s pretty important.\n\nI watched Ipswich lose at home to Forest on Saturday. That felt important, although nothing seems to be happening on the ‘We’re really not very good at all’ front.\n\n“I’m not sure why it keeps going wrong,” said Johnny Williams, plaintively.\n\nNegative, stifling tactics? Lack of inspiration? But what do I know? I’m only a girl…\n\nAnyway, there are lots of other super important things going on, like an American President elect with an apparent predilection for hiring people with far right connections, a Brexit muddle that no one seems to have a clue how to solve and a year that is shaping up to be ‘the worst year ever’ according to some, although 1939-45 weren’t so great, and nor were 1914-18…\n\nBut the real matter of importance this week for me was finding out that Cheryl Cole has finally come to her senses and decided to stop changing her name with every new husband.\n\nWhen one has a lot of husbands, one would have thought this was obvious because it is always an idea to endeavour to stop oneself from becoming faintly ludicrous, which from Tweedy to Cole to Fernandez-Versini, she was well on her way to achieving.\n\nBut at last she has woken up to the fact that she might just as well be ‘Cheryl’ and be done with it, which has a smidgeon of arrogance attached (what about all the other Cheryls?) but wins my approval because if there is one thing that really irritates me in 2016 (not even close to the worst year ever) it is women who change their names to his.\n\nI can still remember my horror as a child seeing a letter to my mother addressed to Mrs Roland Nice.\n\n“But your name is Sally,” I pointed out in confusion.\n\n“Yes, but when a lady marries, she takes her husband’s name,” Mum explained.\n\n“She what? So you’re called Roland now?”\n\n“No, I’m still Sally. But people address me as Mrs R Nice.”\n\n“Does that mean Dad is Mr Sally Nice then?”\n\n“Um, no.”\n\n“But why?”\n\n“Because…er…”\n\nAnd so it was that my mother failed entirely to convince me of the benefits of neither marriage nor renaming.\n\nMy other half being called Darren did nothing to alter my view.\n\nAnd thus I remain gloriously unmarried and will go to my grave with the name I was born with because… that is my name.\n\nUnlike every married woman I know who has honoured an ancient tradition to pass herself as a chattel from one man (her father) to another (her husband), I belong to no one.\n\nJust call me ‘Liz’ from now on. It’s important."
