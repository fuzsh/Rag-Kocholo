According to IBISWorld industry analyst Anthony Kelly, the industry’s performance is principally driven by the trends into construction, manufacturing and mining developments (particularly in the large industrial economies) and increasingly from work in the fields of technological development and the sustainable environment. Over the past decade the industry has expanded its operations by broadening across a wider range of multidisciplinary services, by the trend towards globalization and through the outsourcing of services by public authorities and major corporations.\n\nThe Global Engineering Services industry is one of the largest professional service industries, generating revenue of about $ 530 billion in 2012 (up 3.0% on the previous year), and employing 2.9 million people. Industry value added currently totals $ 318 billion, or 0.6% of the world’s GDP, two-thirds of which represents payments to employees and the balance the industry’s operating profit. The industry’s performance deteriorated during the late 2000s with the onset of recession in several of the largest developed economies and the subsequent decline in construction and industrial production. Despite the current improvement, industry revenue is estimated to average subdued growth by 0.5% per annum over the five years through 2012.\n\nInternational trade represents a significant share of industry activity (10.6% of revenue in 2012) and is mainly confined to relatively few large-scale consulting engineering firms that are capable of operating outside national boundaries, said Kelly. A feature of the industry that has accompanied globalization has been the amalgamation of the larger players to achieve scale economies, broaden the market and strengthen the human and financial resources (consistent with the trend evident in other knowledge-based industries such as accounting, law, advertising and architecture).\n\nThe Global Engineering Services industry has a low concentration of ownership, with the four largest companies accounting for about 6.0% of annual industry revenue. The largest players in the global market for engineering services include URS Corporation, SNC-Lavalin Group, Bechtel Group, Jacobs Engineering Group, Fluor Corporation, AECOM Technology Corporation, CH2M HILL Companies, WS Atkins plc, and Altran Technologies. Despite this low concentration, there has been a trend over the past decade for the consolidation of the operations of many of the world’s leading consulting engineering firms, through mergers or strategic alliances. These large-scale, multidisciplined, multinational companies are well placed to win contracts in most markets.

Brown Convention Center and will feature over 70 leading galleries from across the country.\n\nUnderscoring the Fairs commitment to the visitor experience, this years line-up of programs will again feature an extensive series of discussions, special events and tours, large-scale installations and the inaugural MRKTworks auction. These on- and off-site special events provide visitors with the opportunity to engage with art in an immersive and impactful way and to delver deeper into the innovation and experimentation of the contemporary market.\n\nEvents\n\nTexas Contemporary Art Fair celebrates the burgeoning growth of Houstons cultural landscape with an extensive range of tours and events in some of the Citys newest venues.\n\nThe week will begin with a pre-show reception hosted by the Asia Society Houston, Julie Kinzelman and Texas Contemporary at the newly unveiled Asia Society designed by architect Yoshio Taniguchi. Throughout the Fair, visitors will be invited to attend a special ribbon cutting ceremony of The Andy Monument with artist Rob Pruitt at CAMH, and Claudia Schmuckli, chief curator and director of the Blaffer Art Museum will host a private lunch as part of a behind-the-scenes tour of the newly-renovated museum.\n\nAs well, for the second year, the Opening Night Preview on October 18 will benefit the Contemporary Art Museum Houston (CAMH) and is anticipated to raise over $ 20,000 to support the museums free admission policy and extended hours.\n\nDiscussions & Guided Tours\n\nTexas Contemporary will host a series of discussions throughout the duration of the Fair. Speakers include artists Rob Pruitt and Eric Beltz as well as CAMH Director Bill Arning and a panel of photo and video artists will be organized and moderated by FotoFest International.\n\nFair visitors are invited to tour of several of the citys leading museums, private collections, the new Midtown Arts District, and the conservation studio, Whitten & Proctor Fine Art Conservation and Houston Collector Lester Marks, Museum of Fine Arts Curator Dena Woodhall, and Galveston Arts Center Curator and photography collector Clint Willour, will be among those giving guided tours of the fair. Curatorial Assistant Susan Sutton of the Menil Collection will also conduct a tour the critically-acclaimed exhibition, Silence, which looks at a century of art considering silence. For more information, visit: http://www.txcontemporary.com/texas/installations-and-events.\n\nInstallations\n\nThe artists whose works will be presented at this years Texas Contemporary Fair include Eric Beltz, Colby Bird, Dan Douke, Gina Phillips, OKAY MOUNTAIN, Travis Somerville and many others.\n\nEric Beltz, Revival Wall presented by Morgan Lehman\n\nBeltzs site-specific 9 x 12 wall drawing for Texas Contemporary is derived from the sampler patterns of his Elementary Forces series. Beltz uses the cross-stitch grid-map to create eye-popping illusions in his signature grayscale palette. This installation marks the first time the artist will bring these drawings out of the frame and into this monumental scale.\n\nGina Phillips, A Sentimental Tree Reminisces presented by Jonathan Ferrara Gallery\n\nThe installation will be constructed of textiles the largest of which will be a custom-made tree that will envelope a structural column. Interspersed among the spaces of the branches and the spaces between the ground and the branches will be various sized thought bubbles, representing nostalgic scenes from the trees past history. The installation will include cutout forms of animals, clouds and teeth; these three components are meant to represent the trees past, present and future.\n\nOKAY MOUNTAIN, Roadside Attractions presented by Mark Moore Gallery\n\nThe artist collective, OKAY MOUNTAIN, was commissioned to create Roadside Attractions, 2011 for the Cress Gallery of Art at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga as part of the Diane Marek Visiting Artist Series. The sculpture draws upon the mythology and quirkiness of different categories of roadside attractions with the purpose of delighting and confounding the expectations of the browser and would-be tourist. The brochures themselves mimic the discordant imagery and incongruous information often found in a typical visiting center brochure rack. This is a place where do-it-yourself and professional design are typically forced to cohabitate. All one hundred brochures are uniquely designed by the members of the collective. The printed works -like the brochures upon which they are drawn–are free to take by the viewing public, giving Roadside Attractions of a performative life outside the institutional setting where it originated.\n\nTravis Somerville, Well Division presented by Catharine Clark Gallery\n\nInspired by the famous photograph showing a refrigerated drinking fountain designated for WHITES sharing the same pluming with a porcelain fountain for COLOREDS, Somerville has created his own set of water fountains loosely based on the 2000 census and anticipation of changes for the 2010 census. Above each fountain is a label and inside each basin is a stereotypical image associated with that group.\n\nKim Beck, The Sky Is the Limit presented by Mixed Greens\n\nThis installation of light boxes of backlit prints captures a series of messages taken from advertisingSpace Available, All Sales Final, Everything Must Go–as they were drawn in the sky over Pittsburgh. The phrases, both exciting and portentous, indicate fantastic sales and business closings. The available space advertised is, of course, the most potent symbol of longing in the landscape: the sky. When loosed from paper signs and billboards, the texts evoke open-ended poetic phrases that, as evanescent marks in the sky, gradually fade back into air.\n\nColby Bird, Cord presented by Lora Reynolds Gallery\n\nColby Birds sculptures are minimal and precarious exercises in balance. The works are comprised of commercially abundant materials, such as chair parts, fruit, and lumber. While his work may appear to be elegant and effortless, he goes to painstaking lengths to create this illusion. Birds work carves out a space between high art and youthful insouciance.\n\nHerbert Mehler, WV 745 & WV 716 presented by Lausberg Contemporary\n\nThe inspiration for Mehlers artwork comes from organic and natural matter, such as fruits and seeds. The sculptures serve as a play between light fluid shapes and the seemingly insurmountable weight of the material. Simultaneously, the rhythmic fan-like structure strongly suggests architectural and man-made forms- the rhythm of the corten-steel forms evoke the serene undulating forms of the changing tides or mountain landscapes. It is this ambivalence between the natural and the man-made that makes Mehlers works so captivating. These sculptures are from Mehlers KAVEX series (2003- 2009).\n\nAgnes Denes, Pyramids of Conscience presented by Ballroom Marfa\n\nThese powerful monuments metaphorically and theoretically encapsulate our world’s most precious resource, water. Pyramid I is filled with tap water from Marfa, Pyramid II is filled with polluted water from the Rio Grande River. Pyramid III is filled with recycled motor oil, which symbolically references water as a commodity. Pyramid IV is constructed of mirrors, which reflect ourselves.\n\nDan Douke, Kingdom Come, presented by Peter Mendenhall Gallery\n\nAt first glance, Kingdom Come appears to be two large shipping crates on top of one another. In actuality, the five-sided work is composed of sixteen separate stretched canvases and is completely hand-crafted. The labels are hand-lettered, the wood texture, scrapes and smudges are all hand-painted, highlighting the artist"
