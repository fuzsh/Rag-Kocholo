        "text": "Cloud computing is gaining ground in the global ICT market and day by day a significant number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are adopting cloud services with sole purpose to improve their business environment and become more efficient, competitive and productive. Migrating a business IT infrastructure to the cloud offers reduction on server and storage costs, software maintenance expenditures, network and energy expenses as well as costs associated with disaster recovery. Since the cloud computing model works on a “pay-as-you-go” basis, it provides the option to pay for what is used. Thus, its adoption can offer slow start-up or expansion costs, creating an environment for rapid innovation and development. Into that context, this article presents the Greek side of cloud evolution through two representative case studies, the migration of an IT system of a Greek industry, from an in-house data center to Google Cloud and a study of the “in-house” IT infrastructure of the Natio...\n\nCloud computing refers to a paradigm shift to overall IT solutions while raising the accessibility, scalability and effectiveness through its enabling technologies. However, migrated cloud platforms and services cost benefits as well as performances are neither clear nor summarized. Globalization and the recessionary economic times have not only raised the bar of a better IT delivery models but also have given access to technology enabled services via internet. Cloud computing has vast potential in terms of lean Retail methodologies that can minimize the operational cost by using the third party based IT capabilities, as a service. It will not only increase the ROI but will also help in lowering the total cost of ownership. In this paper we have tried to compare the cloud computing cost benefits with the actual premise cost which an organization incurs normally. However, in spite of the cost benefits, many IT professional believe that the latest model i.e. \"cloud computing\" has risks and security concerns. This report demonstrates how to answer the following questions: (1) Idea behind cloud computing. (2) Monetary cost benefits of using cloud with respect to traditional premise computing. (3) What are the various security issues? We have tried to find out the cost benefit by comparing the Microsoft Azure cloud cost with the prevalent premise cost.\n\nIn last few years, cloud computing concept has emerged a lot which result that it has become the fastest growing business for the IT industry. There is no doubt it has become a promising business concept with win-win situation for the clients to shift. Cloud computing is a latest emerging business concept [1]. Now, recession-hit companies have acknowledged that simply by shifting into the cloud they will gain the fast access to best breed of business applications or appreciably enhance their productivity, all at negligible cost. As more and more data and information of individuals and companies is placed in the cloud, their concern about data and environment safety, security issues, requirements and challenges has also grown. In today’s scenario, each and every organization is totally dependent on the latest technologies those are updating & growing on daily basis. So that now it is becoming more challenging to secure the digital assets of a company in accordance with the changing d...\n\nCloud computing is a burgeoning technology that has ushered in a new era by allowing for a logical computational approach. Over a concept that delivers on-demand services online, it has revolutionized the mechanics of IT consumption. Unlike traditional hosting, cloud services are priced for per basis and may rise or decline in response to feedback. Such services are typically totally managed by cloud service providers and demand only a home computer with an internet connection from users. This model has got the attention of researchers, capitalists, and operators in latest days, with most of them presenting a range of cloud computing, frameworks, and ideas, resulting in a diversity of definitions, requirements, and models. Despite the excitement and development in the field, questions around privacy and security, service discovery partnerships, sharing of resources, and pricing have created additional worries about the model&#39;s genuine merits. Deny the reality that infrastructure...\n\nCloud computing is defined as the approach of computing where extremely scalable IT-related capabilities are delivered \"as a service\", using Internet technologies to many customers. There are many definitions of cloud computing, few of which are quoted in this study, but the basic concept remains the same. There are essential characteristics of Cloud Computing, which are mentioned in this study. Cloud Computing is based on technologies, and there are four deployment models in it and architectural layers that are also known as service models. The research paper gives an idea to the readers/audience about basics of Cloud Computing, its application in business and future of Cloud Computing in business and other areas. Further, the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing have been brought forward. In my viewpoint, I would like to state that, it depends on the organization/individual, how well it makes use of cloud computing so that he/she/organization can take maximum benefit from its advantages while simultaneously delicately handling the risks involved.The nature of this study is qualitative, and the author recommends there are many possible directions of research in cloud computing, which can be helpful for the development of society and the world.\n\nCloud computing is a revolution in computing architecture, transforming not only the Bwhere^ (location) of computing, but also the Bhow^ (the manner in which software is produced and the tools available for the automation of business processes). Cloud computing emerged as we transitioned from an era in which underlying computing resources were both scarce and expensive to an era in which the same resources were cheap and abundant. There are many ways to implement cloud architectures, and most people are familiar with public cloud services such as Gmail or Facebook. However, much of the impact of cloud computing on the economy will be driven by how large enterprises implement cloud architectures. Cloud is also poised to disrupt the Information Technology (IT) industry, broadly conceived, with a new wave of commoditization. Offerings optimized for high performance in an era of computing resource scarcity are giving way to loosely coupled, elastically managed architec-tures making use of cheap, abundant computing resources today."
