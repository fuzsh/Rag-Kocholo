        "text": "After an initial entrepreneurial stint of 3 Yrs at the age of 19 in my small home town Cuddalore (just 18 kms south of Pondicherry ðŸ™‚ ) , I went on to work at Hewlett-Packard at Bangalore for close to 4 years. There I was part of a team which built a sophisticated rule engine (Talarianâ€™s RTIE â€“ real time inference engine) based â€˜Fraud Detection Systemâ€™ for TACS Mobile Phone Networks for Vodafone\n\nLater, I joined Selectica as software analyst and rose to a senior position, as Director of Engineering, for the e-Insurance product division, in a span of 3.5 years. The e-Insurance division and its products were later acquired by Accenture.\n\nIn the technology side I worked in the areas of software architecture for complex enterprise applications, inference engines, configuration engines, rule-based computing & enterprise middleware. I have three patents (20030204629, 20060200772 & 20080256432 ) one in each of the last 3 organizations I worked. Aha, finally I used my patents. ðŸ™‚ ! After founding OrangeScape, my work has been around Business Planning, Technology Marketing,Establishing Partner Sales Channels, Evangelicalism, Analyst Relations, Fund Raising,Operations Management."
