        "text": "OrangeScape Technologies, a software product company, has announced the launch of BPO Suite, a comprehensive, ‘managed’ production floor solution for BPOs. This solution has been designed to enable BPO providers fight margin pressures by productivity saves and to improve predictability in delivery.\n\nBuilt on OrangeScape’s technology platform, BPO Suite offers ‘readily consumable value’ for BPOs, both for Transaction Processing and Knowledge Services companies, with the flexibility to customise and make it suitable for each business.\n\nSuresh Sambandam, founder and CEO of OrangeScape said, “The varying nature of jobs and the intensive intelligence involved, keeps the knowledge services industry at the high-value end of outsourcing. At the same time, the very nature of such services makes it complex for the business to measure and predict the progress of the jobs”. He further added, “Our solution provides an integrated environment for knowledge experts and managers to systematically plan, track and manage the production floor. Keeping track of how your employees are occupied, helps you plan better, improve utilisation and therefore, increase your profitability.”\n\nMost importantly, the suite offers a pan-optical view of the production floor with real-time visibility into people and process performance. This will allow BPO firms to meet higher quality standards.\n\n“With the experience gained by serving Indian BPO players like CGSL, 247Customer, Premedia Global, eNoah, Macmillan and others, we had come up with this prescriptive solution, tailor-made to address the pain points of the industry today,” said Sambandam."
