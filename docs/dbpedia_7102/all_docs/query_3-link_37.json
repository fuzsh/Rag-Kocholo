There are sceptics who say that India will never be able to overcome this services mindset and move on to develop creative global products and platforms. We don’t share that scepticism.\n\nWe believe that the success of the software services industry has created talent that now has the desire, confidence and expertise to build global technology products. Thousands of such initiatives are in the works around the country. Sujit John and Narayanan Krishnaswami bring to you a sample of these, some that have reached a degree of maturity, others that have seen amazing success in a short period.\n\n2/16\n\nArvind Rao & Mouli Raman - OnMobile\n\nFounded in 2000, in California, but moved to Bangalore two years later.\n\nBusiness\n\nMobile value added services like ringtones, ring back tones, alerts, voice-based searches.

Has onsite presence in 52 countries ; has 105 million unique users every month.\n\nRao, 52, who was in the venture capital industry in the US prior to forming On-Mobile , says the company’s strength has been its risk sharing and joint work with operators to make the products a success, instead of simply licensing its technology.
