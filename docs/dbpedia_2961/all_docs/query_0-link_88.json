They had their own uncharted terrain on which they could create a scene of their own, with their own experimental sound: Their home base, the now-legendary 9:30 Club, spawned a singular new wave movement, one whose influence can still be felt among D.C. bands of today. Their unique meshing of the visual arts crowd with the music world helped to usher in a unification of the D.C. creative community.\n\nOnly circumstance separated the Verbs from widespread national acclaim, so with this episode, we offer a candid telling of a story that we feel deserves recognition, a story of music that still sounds as fresh, driving, and progressive today as the day it was recorded. These are the recollections of an extraordinary period in time, told by those who lived it.\n\nCarly and Carrie would like to dedicate this episode to the memory of Robert Goldstein, whose music and essential contributions to the Verbs were a large part of the inspiration for this project.\n\nListen to Urban Verbs: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\nHere, shared with the public for the first time, is the detailed, two page letter legendary producer Brian Eno wrote to the Urban Verbs upon hearing them for the first time at CBGB. Delivered to the band the morning after the show and featuring extensive handwritten marginalia, the letter reflects Eno’s enthusiasm for their unique sound, the potential he heard in it, and his eagerness to record them — at his own expense.\n\nIn it, Eno is remarkably candid, mulling over ideas that seem dated now (“I’ve often thought of the next generation of machines and computers,” he muses) but were ahead of their time, offering suggestions and praise in equal amount. “That was how far I could go before getting embarrassed,” he concludes. “I realize that this gush might surprise you somewhat, but you came at a good time for me.”\n\nClick to expand thumbnails\n\nThank you very much to Rod Frantz for sharing this document with us.\n\nAnd here are the tracks Eno ended up producing for the Urban Verbs:\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nHere’s a publicity still of the Urban Verbs from the late ‘70s that’s cool af.\n\nHere’s some extensive info about the ARP Odyssey synthesizer Robin Rose used.\n\nWhile the Verbs were pioneers in the D.C. rock scene, this article from D.C. Whiz highlights some of their contemporaries, including the Slickee Boys, mentioned in this episode.\n\nFor a taste of what the B-52s were like around the time they played with the Urban Verbs, check out this in-depth look at their early days.\n\nHere’s some more info on Mike Thorne’s career.\n\nThe Washington Post covered the Urban Verbs extensively in their D.C. days. See our further reading links below to read everything from profiles of the band to reviews of their shows.\n\nThe Urban Verbs briefly reunited in 2008. Here’s an interview with the band from the time, and peep our further watching links below to see a 2008 performance of Terminal Bar.\n\nMore from Bob Boilen on the Urban Verbs.\n\nThe last time that all the original members of Urban Verbs publicly performed together was at the Katzen Arts Center in D.C. in May 2016. Check out our further watching links below to watch their performance.\n\nSee our further reading links below to read and listen to NPR’s poignant remembrance of Robert Goldstein.\n\nMembers of the Verbs, along with other DC bands and artists who continue their legacy, held a tribute concert for Robert Goldstein (which came to be known as RobertFest) at the new 9:30 Club in January 2017. A video of the entire show can be viewed in our links below.\n\nIn the mood for another oral history? The Washington Post did one in 2010 on the founding and subsequent life of the 9:30 Club.\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nRoddy Frantz — Vocals, Written-By — Lyrics\n\nRobert Goldstein — Guitar, Written-By — Music\n\nRobin Rose — Synthesizer\n\nLinda France — Bass and piano\n\nDanny Frankel — Drums and percussion\n\nMike Thorne — Producer\n\nFurther watching:\n\nRobertFest full concert | January 2017\n\nUrban Verbs live at Katzan Arts Center | May 2016\n\n“Terminal Bar” | 2008\n\nFurther reading:\n\nDance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation’s Capital | 2009\n\nAmbient Genius (Brian Eno profile) | The New Yorker (July 2014)\n\nRemembering Robert Goldstein, NPR’s Music Librarian and Our Friend | NPR (October 2016)\n\nUrban Verbs’ Renewal (on a 1995 reunion at the 9:30 Club) | Washington Post (December 1995)\n\nThe Urban Verbs: Future Tense (debut album review) | Washington Post (March 1980)\n\nThe Urban Verbs (Pension Building show review) | Washington Post (March 1980)\n\nThe Urban Verbs (profile of the band) | Washington Post (February 1979)\n\nTwo Rock Groups Play CBGB’s (show review) | The New York Times (November 1978)\n\nThe Urban Verbs (Corcoran Gallery show review) | Washington Post (October 1978)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEpisode 2.1: SOME GIRLS\n\nSOME GIRLS – The Rolling Stones – Rolling Stones Records – 1978\n\nDisco. Punk. Blues. Rock. Country. Touching on each of these unique, diverse genres on one album looks like a recipe for disaster on paper. And yet, in the tight span of 40 minutes, that combination was the magic kick that the Rolling Stones needed to revive their careers.\n\nThings were not looking good for the Stones by the late-70s. After getting carried away on their own popularity following a string of hit albums — Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St. — they released a string of subpar ones. Drugs were becoming an increasing problem, and a heroin bust left Keith Richards facing serious legal issues and the threat of an extended jail sentence. Their early peers, bands like the Beatles, the Animals, and Led Zeppelin, had either broken up long ago or were on the fade. And now in their early 30s, they were considered too old to be trusted as rock stars anymore, quickly losing relevancy to the young punks and disco acts on the rise.\n\nSuffice it to say, their next album had the power to make or break them. An experimentation with what was new, while still remaining true to the Stones’ established rock aesthetic, 1978’s Some Girls was a critical and commercial success that breathed new life into the band.\n\nIn this episode, we examine the influences of emerging musical movements like disco and punk on the Stones, how a decidedly British band made an album that captured the New York spirit, and why it stands up over time as a testament to the Rolling Stones’ continued legacy as one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.\n\nThis episode is in memory of all the people who were killed and injured in Las Vegas this week, and to the lasting influence of Tom Petty. May it remind you why we all love and celebrate music in the first place.\n\nListen to Some Girls: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps — while you’re there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nAlright, the Rolling Stones had a lonnnnng history before they even got around to Some Girls, so we’ll spare you all our CliffsNotes and just direct you to Wikipedia to spiral from there.\n\nWe’ve discussed this before: the mid- to late-70s were an incredibly exciting time in music, particularly in New York. It’s no wonder the Stones wanted to play catch-up and pull in punk and disco influences to stay current.\n\nLOL at the Stones being considered too old in the ‘70s.\n\nBecause of Keith’s legal issues stemming from a bust for heroin possession, Mick ends up being a driving creative force on Some Girls. For more about that, check out our further reading section below.\n\nCurrent artists are always going to be influenced by what came before, but we seem to be in the midst of a ‘70s and early ‘80s renaissance with bands like Vulfpeck, TOPS, etc.\n\nThat sentiment about all music being cyclical because there are only so many chords that we couldn’t source? It came from Tom Petty. He’s invaded our subconscious to the point where we could recall this interview he gave about 12 years ago, in which he says he’s found himself writing a song and “then [realizing] it’s somebody else’s song. […] But there’s only so many words and so many notes, so sometimes you do cross somebody else’s territory.”\n\nMick Jagger is a slut. There. We said it.\n\nBut THIS cannot honestly be real. Can it?\n\nHahahahahahahaha “Some Girls” would never be made today hahahahahaha\n\nHere’s a brief history of some of the Stones’ offensive songs. (“Brown Sugar” is exceptionally offensive so it gets its own treatment.)\n\nAnd here’s a brief history of that cover art debacle.\n\nNo, seriously, can anyone provide any evidence that Mick did research at CBGB because “Lies” and “Respectable” sure sound like he did.\n\nSomeone compiled a list of all the times Keef sings lead on Stones’ songs, so there’s that.\n\n“Beast of Burden” is easily one of the top 10 sexiest songs ever do not fight us on this.\n\nWhat’s there to say about the Rolling Stones’ legacy? They’ve been around forever and are seemingly immortal, having influenced countless of musicians and fans for more than 50 years.\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nMick Jagger — lead and backing vocals, electric guitar, piano, percussion\n\nKeith Richards — electric guitar, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, piano, lead vocals\n\nBill Wyman — bass guitar, synthesizer\n\nCharlie Watts — drums\n\nRonnie Wood — electric guitar, backing vocals, pedal steel, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, bass drum\n\nSugar Blue — harmonica\n\nIan McLagan — electric piano, organ\n\nMel Collins — saxophone\n\nSimone Kirke — congas\n\nTed Jensen — mastering\n\nFavorite track(s): Miss You (Carly) | Miss You (Carrie)\n\nLeast favorite track: Far Away Eyes (Carly) | Far Away Eyes and Before They Make Me Run (Carrie)\n\nFurther watching:\n\nShine a Light (Martin Scorsese documentary on the Rolling Stones) | 2008\n\nThe Rolling Stones: Just for the Record – The ’70s | 2002\n\nKeith Richards: Life (BBC documentary) | 2010\n\nSome Girls tour interview | 1978\n\nFurther reading:\n\nRolling Stones’ ‘Some Girls’ (from the 33 1/3 book series) | 2011\n\nLife (Keith Richards’ memoir) | 2010\n\nHow the Rolling Stones went disco: Inside the making of “Miss You” | Salon (August 2017)\n\nHow the Rolling Stones Bounced Back With ‘Some Girls’ | Ultimate Classic Rock (June 2015)\n\nThe Rolling Stone Interview: Jagger Remembers | Rolling Stone (December 1995)\n\nMick Jagger: Jumpin’ Jack Flash at 34 | Rolling Stone (June 1978)\n\nSome Girls review | Rolling Stone (June 1978)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEpisode 15: MUSIC\n\nMUSIC – Carole King – Sony Music – 1971\n\nBy the final months of 1971, Carole King was a bona fide superstar. A Los Angeles Times Top 10 Woman of the Year and platinum album seller, her solo singles chronically became hits, and in June of that year, she sold out Carnegie Hall. Her talent, relentless ambition, and steadfast belief in both had taken her to the height of musical recognition without compromising any of her originality — an exemplary feat that was emblematic of the dawning of the freer, more authentic era for women that the 1970s would come to be. She had named herself Carole King at age 14, and now, the woman that Brooklyn’s Carol Klein became was enjoying something else on her terms: her own success.\n\nThe album that brought it to her, of course, was Tapestry, but late in 1971, Carole King released her follow-up, Music. Though it received mixed reviews upon its release, Music showcases several of the tricks in Carole’s bag, with influences spanning jazz to R&B to classic pop, arrangements varying from the quiet and simple to the symphonic, and ranging in emotion while never losing her trademark intimacy. This is an album that is more than just a juggernaut’s endearing postscript — it is a declaration of confidence, awareness, and love.\n\nListen to Music: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps — while you’re there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nCarole King has had a prolific career since she was a teenager. You’ve probably (definitely) heard some of her early songs with Gerry Goffin like “The Loco-Motion,” “Up On The Roof,” and “One Fine Day.” (If you haven’t, then where have you been?)\n\nHere’s Robert Hillburn’s Women of the Year profile of Carole King.\n\nCheck out our further reading section below to read Rolling Stone’s original review of Music. (It’s not very kind, but we’re gonna be talking about it a lot.)\n\n“Brother, Brother” is totally a sister/response song to Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On?” Bop over to our master playlist on Spotify to hear them back to back and tell us if you agree or disagree.\n\nCarole has credited Toni Stern as a collaborator who helped give her the courage to write on her own after Gerry. Here’s some more about her.\n\nThrowback to our Graham Nash episode “It’s Going to Take Some Time” might remind you a bit of the mature breakup themes on Songs For Beginners.\n\nYes, the Carpenters covered “It’s Going to Take Some Time.” Yes, they used a flute. Yes, it was hokey. We have been here with our distaste for flutes before.\n\n“I never wanted to be Danny Kootch. I always thought it was the stupidest fucking nickname in the world.” — Danny Kortchmar AKA “Kootch”\n\nNo really, one day we’re going to do an episode all about the Section.\n\nIt’ll be just like a Jack Stratton Holy Trinities episode. (PS — You should really, really watch this one and also, if you dig funk, you should really, really listen to Vulfpeck.)\n\nICYMI in our Jackson Browne episode, read more about the Section in our further reading links below.\n\nHere’s Carole’s OG demo of that Monkees song.\n\nIf you’re ever feeling too good about yourself, remember that Cameron Crowe was reviewing albums for the San Diego Door when he was 14 years old. Read his review of Music here.\n\nHONESTLY, if you can find a copy of PBS’s American Masters: Troubadours: The Rise of the Singer-Songwriter, you will be a VIP friend of the pod. Its existence has all but been erased from the internet.\n\nHere’s a trailer for it, at least.\n\nCarrie was wrong; Emmylou Harris’s “Luxury Liner” came out in 1976, not 1975.\n\nYou know we’re all about that legacy — who lives, who dies, who tells your story?\n\nFirst, Carole King is still very much a presence in music today. In 2015, she received a Kennedy Center honor. In 2016, she headlined the British Summer Time Festival and played Tapestry live in its entirety for the very first time. This year, she released a song to support the Women’s March.\n\nSecond, some great artists you should check out who carry on her songwriting style and musical influence (we’ll put them all in the playlist): Sara Bareilles, Greta Morgan, Diane Birch, Vanessa Carlton… the list could go on, but here are some A+ starters.\n\nThird, she even has a musical about her life (Beautiful: The Carole King Musical) that’s been on Broadway for 3+ years now. Talk about legacy.\n\nIf you wanna talk to us: hit us up over email, like us on Facebook, or even feel free to slide into our DMs on Twitter.\n\nShoutout to our one star reviewer on iTunes, whoever you may be. They don’t want you to win. We love you anyway.\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nCarole King – Vocals, piano, electric piano, electric celeste, backing vocals\n\nRalph Schuckett – organ, electric piano, electric celeste\n\nDanny “Kootch” Kortchmar – acoustic and electric guitars, backing vocals\n\nJames Taylor – acoustic guitar, backing vocals\n\nCharles Larkey – electric and acoustic bass guitar\n\nJoel O’Brien, Russ Kunkel – drums\n\nMs. Bobbye Hall – congas, bongos, tambourine\n\nTeresa Calderon – congas\n\nCurtis Amy – tenor saxophone, flute\n\nOscar Brashear – flugelhorn\n\nWilliam Green – woodwind, flute, saxophone\n\nWilliam Collette – woodwind, flute, saxophone\n\nErnest Watts – woodwind, flute, saxophone\n\nPlas Johnson – woodwind, flute, saxophone\n\nMike Altschul – woodwind, flute, saxophone\n\nAbigale Haness – backing vocals\n\nMerry Clayton – backing vocals\n\nFavorite track(s): Sweet Seasons and Music (Carly) | Sweet Seasons and Brighter (Carrie)\n\nLeast favorite track: Surely (Carly) | Surely (Carrie)\n\nFurther watching:\n\nCarole King’s Kennedy Center Honors induction | 2015\n\nCarole King: “I never thought about gender” (MSNBC intervew) | 2015\n\nA Conversation With Carole King (book discussion at JFK Library) | 2012\n\nHotel California: LA From the Byrds to the Eagles | 2007\n\nFurther reading:\n\nA Natural Woman: A Memoir | 2012\n\nGirls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon — And the Journey of a Generation | 2008 (side note — this is a huge favorite of both Carrie and Carly)\n\nAn Oral History of Laurel Canyon, the ’60s and ’70s Music Mecca | Vanity Fair (March 2015)\n\nThe Section: Knights of Soft Rock | Rolling Stone (April 2013)\n\nMusic review | Rolling Stone (January 1972)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEpisode 13: NIGHTCLUBBING\n\nNIGHTCLUBBING – Grace Jones – Island Records – 1981\n\nMusic. Fashion. Art. Icon. Attempting to mix these to create an internationally acclaimed persona would be a daunting task for anyone with less magnetism than Grace Jones, who succeeded so overwhelmingly at becoming a cross-genre “It Girl” that she forged a path for future generations of singular artists to follow.\n\nAlready a well-known model and disco queen, Grace Jones began recording music in the late 1970s. The records did modestly well, but in 1979, Island Records founder and producer Chris Blackwell began working with her on a new musical aesthetic, combining funk, disco, reggae, and new wave styles to create something new — and uniquely Grace Jones. With the talents of Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Uziah Thompson, and other musicians who comprised the Compass Point All-Stars, the sessions that became Nightclubbing would go on to influence music through each subsequent decade.\n\nAs we seek to bridge the gap between the generations, there are few better examples of lasting musical, sartorial, and artistic inspiration than Grace Jones. In today’s episode on her 1981 album Nightclubbing, we explore the effervescent enigma of a woman who left her Jamaican home to travel the world, only to return to the Caribbean to create the music that would become the focal point of her legacy. We dive deep into the relationships between music and art, between the artist and the image, and between icon and legacy.\n\nListen to Nightclubbing: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps — while you’re there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nWe’ve mentioned this before, but once again, Chris Blackwell is a BAMF.\n\nAs is Alex Sadkin.\n\nRevisit our episode on Betty Davis’s They Say I’m Different and let us know if you see any similarities between Betty and Grace.\n\nTURN UP FOR COMPASS POINT 👏 👏 👏\n\nHere’s a rad podcast we literally just found that serves as a mini audio-documentary on the studio and some of the cool people who passed through and the records they made.\n\nSly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Barry Reynolds, and Uziah “Sticky” Thompson are all killer musicians on their own, but the sum = magic\n\nPeep our further reading for more on them.\n\nLet’s talk about this album cover!\n\nFirst and foremost: Grace Jones is the OG baddie, textbook unfuckwithable.\n\nEspecially, let’s talk about John Paul Goude.

We see you, James Murphy.\n\nFinally, worth repeating here, the final paragraph of Grace’s memoir: “If people complain that I am not doing enough of my old material, not performing all the hits, I will stand in front of them, a formlessness that engulfs all form. I will put on another hat, crack my whip, scatter fireflies, fix them with a five-thousand-year-old stare, fit to fight to the bitter end, becoming a ghost with the passing of time. I will be ready for the afterlife, for my bones to be buried in the mountains of Jamaica, or the canals of Venice, or the dark side of the moon, or under the ground in the cities I’ve lived in and loved. And I will say: Do you want to move forward with me, or not? Do you want to know where I am going next? It’s time for something else to happen.“\n\nFavorite track(s): Feel Up and Pull Up To The Bumper (Carly) | Pull Up To The Bumper and Feel Up (Carrie)\n\nLeast favorite track: Art Groupie (Carly) | I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango) (Carrie)\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nWally Badarou – keyboards\n\nMonte Browne – rhythm guitar\n\nMikey Chung – guitar\n\nMasai Delon – vocals\n\nTyrone Downie – keyboards, vocals\n\nSly Dunbar – drums, syndrums\n\nJack Emblow – accordion\n\nGrace Jones – vocals, backing vocals\n\nBarry Reynolds – guitar\n\nJess Roden – vocals\n\nRobbie Shakespeare – bass\n\nMel Speller – percussion, vocals\n\nUziah Thompson – percussion\n\nChris Blackwell, Alex Sadkin – production\n\nFurther Watching:\n\nGrace Jones: One Man Show | 1982\n\nGrace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami (trailer) | Forthcoming documentary\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nI’ll Never Write My Memoirs | Jones’s irony, please memoir (2015)\n\nGrace Jones: Warm Leatherette (re-issue review) | Pitchfork (June 2016)\n\nWelcome to Planet Grace Jones | Paper Magazine (October 2015)\n\nGrace Jones Explores Androgyny in a New Memoir | Vogue (September 2015)\n\nAs Much As I Can, As Black As I Am: The Queer History of Grace Jones | Pitchfork (August 2015)\n\nI’ve Seen That Face Before: Looking back on Grace Jones’s iconic Nightclubbing with the people who made it happen | Fact Magazine (May 2014)\n\nGrace Jones: Nightclubbing (deluxe re-issue review) | Pitchfork (May 2014)\n\nGrace Jones pulls up to the bumper | The Guardian (June 2011)\n\nChris Blackwell | Interview Magazine (March 2009)\n\nGrace Jones by Jean Paul Goude | V Magazine (February 2009)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEpisode 12: RUNNING ON EMPTY\n\nRUNNING ON EMPTY – Jackson Browne – Asylum Records – 1977\n\nRunning on Empty was an album that wasn’t supposed to work. Ten new cuts, all recorded live, in various parts of the country, over the course of two months? To his label, this sounded like pure folly, but Jackson Browne knew this was not just a way to fill time between studio albums; it was to be his labor of love.\n\nSince becoming a recording artist at the age of 18, Browne had experienced life both as Greenwich Village bohemian in the ‘60s with the likes of the Velvet Underground, and as an essential contributor to the emerging Southern California rock sound in the early ‘70s. By 1977, he was looking for something new to try, something he hadn’t yet done — so in August of that year, he took his favorite sessions players on the road and hit “record.”\n\nThe collection of recordings that became Running On Empty would be Jackson Browne’s greatest commercial success, going platinum within months of its release. Today, it remains a strikingly fresh portrait of the realities of touring life, and whether referencing the road to the next gig or the road to the next phase of life, it’s the album’s universal displays of humanity that keeps the songs in your head long after the needle hits the runout grooves.\n\nListen to Running on Empty: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps — while you’re there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nHiiiiii, here we are with another album from 1977 — you might notice its stark difference from our previous ‘77 episode on Marquee Moon.\n\nThe amount of iconic outputs from multiple musical genres in the ‘70s, but particularly 1977, never ceases to amaze us. Best year in pop culture. Fight us on this.\n\nYou can break down the differences and the reasons why they resonated with particular audiences in a million different ways, but at its most broad, let’s just say that Marquee Moon very much exemplified the East Coast/New York punk aesthetic, while Running On Empty can be held up as an example of the West Coast/Laurel Canyon/Cal Rock soft scene.\n\nSee our further reading section to read that really well-written original review of Running on Empty from Rolling Stone in 1978 we talked about.\n\nRunning on Empty was initially just a way to buy time to conceive new material for another traditional LP, but it became a way to break the repetitive record-making pattern success brings. JB has said: “You go, ‘OK, great, let’s try to do something more like that.’ But that’s not what you were doing when you did it in the first place. You were just doing what you wanted to do next.”\n\nHere’s that gorgeous Cameron Crowe essay from the 2005 re-issue that Carrie read an excerpt from. He’s the best.\n\nQuick background info about the session players on this album:\n\nThe Section (Danny “Kootch” Kortchmar, Craig Doerge, Leland Sklar, and Russ Kunkel) were Asylum’s de facto house band and have played on a slew of ‘70s soft rock albums for everyone from Carole King to Linda Ronstadt to Warren Zevon. There’s a great article about them in our further reading section.\n\nDavid Lindley and Jackson Browne have been long, long, longtime collaborators. You can read more about him in the links below, too.\n\nOur bad. The author of that rad review comparing circa-1977 culture to “feeling like a trashed Holiday Inn room” was actually RJ Smith for Blender Magazine in a review of the 2005 reissue, not, as we cited in the pod, Robert Christgau.\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t seem to find a working link for the full review — not even using Internet Archive’s Wayback machine — because Blender folded in 2009 and, apparently, took its archive with it.\n\nInterested in the Nick Drake comparison “The Road” brings up? Follow us on Spotify, where we will lay it all out for you.\n\nDavid Lindley is the real MVP on “You Love the Thunder,” bringing that gee-tar rock and roll edge to Jackson Browne’s soft piano rock.\n\n@ Haim: Please cover “You Love the Thunder.” Thanks, bye.\n\nAlright, buckle up. “Cocaine” has a LONG history.\n\nListen to Rev. Gary Davis’s “Cocaine Blues” here.\n\nListen to Davey Graham’s “Anji” here.\n\nListen to John Martyn’s reworking of both of those, “Cocain,” here.\n\nRead the anonymous (but curated by W.H. Auden) poem “Cocaine Lil and Morphine Sue” here.\n\nIf you have Running on Empty on vinyl, flip it over for some great Easter eggs in the track-by-track notes. Pro-tip: always read the liner notes.\n\nIf “The Load Out” doesn’t give you some feels, there’s a high possibility that you have an empty cavity in your chest where your heart is supposed to be.\n\nShoutout to roadies: we know you, we see you, we love you, we appreciate everything you do. We are once again saying: bands are a sum of their parts, and that continues after the music is recorded and the performance begins.\n\nShoutout to Roadies, our beloved, now-canceled Cameron Crowe series. It wasn’t perfect, but it was earnest, and it had bucketloads of heart. Give it a watch if you haven’t seen it, and maybe give it a second watch (or even a second chance) if you already have.\n\n“Stay” gets us:\n\nHead over to our master playlist on Spotify to hear the original Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs version that this is a reworking of.\n\nWatch this fantastic version where JB and David Lindley perform it as a mashup with the Mickey and Sylvia song “Love Is Strange.” Swoon a little.\n\nJackson Browne’s — and this album’s — legacy is long and ongoing.\n\nRunning On Empty, initially thought to be a crazy idea, ended up being his best-selling album and is on too many lists to count of the best live albums, best albums of the ‘70s, etc.\n\nSome current artists who have Jackson Browne’s fingerprints all over them: Dawes, Wilco, Jim James, Jenny Lewis, Tristen… the list goes on and on.\n\nAnyway, we love you JB\n\nFavorite track(s): The Load Out (Carly) | Running on Empty and Stay (Carrie)\n\nLeast favorite track: Rosie (Carly) | Love Needs a Heart (Carrie)\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nJackson Browne – guitar, piano, vocals\n\nRosemary Butler – background vocals, co-lead vocal on “Stay”\n\nCraig Doerge – piano, keyboards\n\nDoug Haywood – background vocals\n\nDanny Kortchmar – lead guitar, harmony vocals (on “Shaky Town”)\n\nRuss Kunkel – drums, snare drum, cardboard box, hi hat\n\nDavid Lindley – lap steel guitar, fiddle, co-lead vocal on “Stay”\n\nLeland Sklar – bass\n\nJoel Bernstein – background vocals (on “Rosie”) & tour photographer\n\nFurther watching:\n\n“One time I sued John McCain” interview segment | 2014\n\nJackson Browne’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction | 2004\n\n“Running on Empty” (2004 induction ceremony) | 2004\n\nFurther reading:\n\nSession legend/producer Russ Kunkel on 13 career-defining records | Music Radar (April 2014)\n\nThe Section: Knights of Soft Rock | Rolling Stone (April 2013)\n\nBehind the Song: Jackson Browne, “Running on Empty” |American Songwriter (December 2012)\n\nJackson Browne on Meeting David Lindley for the First Time | Fretboard Journal (March 2009)\n\nJackson Browne: The Rolling Stone Interview | Rolling Stone (August 1980)\n\nRunning on Empty (album review) | Rolling Stone (March 1978)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEpisode 11: I’M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU\n\nI’M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU – Al Green – Hi Records – 1972\n\nAl Green’s 1972 album I’m Still In Love With You is a personal one: an album for smooth Saturday nights and sweet Sunday mornings, for both weddings and double digit anniversaries. It recalls time spent with family, friends, and lovers, and inspires memories to be made in the future. It’s an album made for lasting connections, and is undoubtedly one that is best enjoyed when shared.\n\nIn this episode, we examine the foundation of this iconic record and explore the greater musical landscape from which it was born. We discuss the one-of-a-kind house band that gave the album its distinct sound, the Southern stronghold that informed the album’s character, and the producer who oversaw it all, mixing all the elements together to create what is arguably one the greatest American soul records of the 20th century. An album is only as good as the sum of its parts, and here, we examine how I’m Still In Love With You remains an upstanding example.\n\nListen to I’m Still In Love With You: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps — while you’re there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nHere’s a brief history of Memphis soul and Hi Records’ and Stax’s places within it.\n\nThe Hi Rhythm Band released their own album in 1976 —listen to it here.\n\nDebate: Did they make a banjo funky or is it like the flute, whose presence in funk is bad, like, 99 percent of the time? (Debate that flute opinion with us, too, if you want. It wouldn’t be the first time we had that discussion.)\n\nHere’s a simple, science-y explanation for why sound quality on vinyl can degrade the closer you get to the center of the album — hence, why Carrie assumes making a full, deep song like “I’m Still In Love With You” the very first track was more of a quality control choice than a creative one.\n\nThe Al Green drum sounds are SO. GOOD. You can thank Al Jackson, Jr. and Howard Grimes for that.\n\nHere’s a brief explainer about Al Jackson, Jr.’s contributions to soul music.\n\nAnd here’s a brief explainer about Howard Grimes.\n\nSee our further reading section below to read an in-depth Rolling Stone article on Al Green and Willie Mitchell circa 1973 where Mitchell talks about this two drummer technique.\n\nListen to Chance the Rapper’s “Give and Take” in our master playlist on Spotify.\n\nWe both kind of, sort of think the second side of this album is weak.

The band broke up. The band got back together and found themselves with a new opportunity to release an album — this time with a better name: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nReleased in 1976, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ self-titled debut is an amalgamation of styles and influences. It travels from classic blues to swampy country to classic ‘50s rock in songs that are abruptly short and full of anxious, pulsing rhythms that weren’t too deviant from the emerging punk scene. It’s no wonder people didn’t know what to do with them or how to classify them when the album was released.\n\nThough the album contains songs that are now staples of American pop culture, engrained in our collective consciousness — songs like “American Girl” and “Breakdown” — it would be a few years before Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers cemented their status as household name rock stars — but it’s a status they’ve held onto.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the variety of musical influences on early Heartbreakers work, dive into Tom Petty’s sparse songwriting style, and talk about why Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ enduring, four decade long careers truly inspire us.\n\nListen to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps — while you’re there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nWe love almost anything and everything Tom Petty (with and without the Heartbreakers) has released, but we’re covering the Heartbreakers’ debut, rather an album as iconic as Damn the Torpedoes, because we want to have conversations about albums without just rehashing what everyone else has already said. Check out our FAQ page for more on our philosophy.\n\nSee our further watching and further reading links below for two tomes on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers that we cannot endorse more emphatically.\n\nPetty is Warren Zanes’ incredibly in-depth, intimate, and breathtaking biography of Tom Petty that will probably make you love Tom Petty more than you thought you could.\n\nRunnin’ Down a Dream is Peter Bogdanovich’s epic, 4-hour long documentary of your dreams. It’s enthralling, candid, and thorough — so worth a binge session.\n\nIt all starts with Mudcrutch.\n\nListen to some of their original demos here or here.\n\nMudcrutch got back together in 2007 and have released two albums since. Listen to them here.\n\nTBH, we don’t blame the good people of 1976 for thinking Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were punk. It really doesn’t help that there was already a punk band — a staple at CBGB — who were also called the Heartbreakers…\n\nWe’re not going to get too too deep on lyrical analysis — Tom Petty’s songwriting is often sparse and without a lot of intentional metaphors to unpack; he’d probably roll his eyes and think we were really digging for bullshit if we went that route.\n\n(No, really, he wrote “Free Fallin’” just to make Jeff Lynne laugh.)\n\nBut here are all the lyrics just in case you want to go for it.\n\n“Breakdown” is a fantastic combination of old and new. Seriously.\n\nListen to “Breakdown.” Then listen to Booker T. and the M.G’s “Green Onions.” Note the similarities.\n\nListen to “Breakdown.” Then listen to Ray Charles’ “Hit the Road Jack.” Boom.\n\nListen to a live version of “Breakdown” where they weave the aforementioned classic into their own song.\n\nAll that seem like a lot? Follow us on Spotify to listen to all the great songs we just mentioned (and more to come!) in order of discussion for your listening-and-nerding pleasure.\n\nExcept for Suzi Quatro’s cover. That one you can watch here.\n\nWe love all the Heartbreakers, but honestly, people don’t talk enough about how MVP Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench are.\n\nAll roads go back to Gainesville. (Watch this. Trust us on this one.)\n\n500% here for this video of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performing “Anything That’s Rock ‘N’ Roll” on Top of the Pops.\n\n“Strangered in the Night” could totally be a sister song to “Two Gunslingers.” If you’re a regular listener, you’ll know how much we love sister songs.\n\nWe went down a musical rabbit hole again, which is fun.\n\nListen to Linda Ronstadt’s “You’re No Good.” Then listen to “Fooled Again.”\n\nListen to “Fooled Again.” Then listen to Sheryl Crowe’s “My Favorite Mistake.”\n\nDid your brain melt a little bit?\n\nBasslines, yo.\n\nAgree? Disagree? Just tell us.\n\nListen, “American Girl” is a bop and we don’t have time for any haters.\n\nSpeaking of the Byrds… Roger McGuinn actually ended up covering “American Girl” in 1977. (It’s in our master playlist, hint-hint, nudge-nudge.)\n\nSlow this song down and you’ve got a haunting (but good) ballad.\n\nSeriously. Don’t be that person who hates “American Girl” just because it’s popular. Just don’t.\n\nAlso, don’t be that person who wears the band tee-shirt without knowing anything about the band. Follow this trusty rule: Can you name two non-singles and the bassist? Then you can wear the band tee.\n\nWe love Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers so very much, apologies if we gushed a little.\n\nIf you missed the last (and only, so far!) Mudcrutch tour, we are truly sorry. (Carly feels your FOMO). If you did, and you’d like to talk about how magical it was with Carrie, hit us up.\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers are currently on a North American tour to commemorate their 40th anniversary.\n\nNo, it’s not a greatest hits tour; it’s full of deep cuts to be stoked about.\n\nIf you can go: GO.

Not long before, they had helped Hilly Kristal put the CBGB stage together; now, they were performing in the club that they would help to immortalize. Television, comprised of Tom Verlaine, Richard Lloyd, Richard Hell (replaced by Fred Smith in 1975), and Billy Ficca, soon became the de facto house band at CBGB, appearing regularly and becoming a staple of the growing scene that would come to include the Ramones, Blondie, Talking Heads, Dead Boys, and Patti Smith, to name a few.\n\nWith their popularity growing, the logical next step would have been to record an album, but Television bided their time. They chose to hone their sound, to develop and grow as a band, so by the time they were signed to Elektra Records in 1976, they were more than ready to begin work on what would become the seminal Marquee Moon. Released in early 1977, the album is regarded as one of the greatest of the punk era, containing songs that continue to be referenced today in covers and samples.\n\nWe chose this album as the first to be covered from our show’s namesake year because of its grit, its timeliness and timelessness, and its particular way of getting under your skin and making you feel more electrically charged than you were when you began the album. In this episode, we explore how Television’s and CBGB’s beginnings are inextricably linked, dive into Marquee Moon’s darkness and dreaminess, and outline the continuation of the band’s sound, proving that their legacy still thrives today.\n\nListen to Marquee Moon: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(and hey, while you’re at it, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be pod friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nRIP CBGB. We didn’t know you personally, but we’ve consumed enough (too much) secondhand information to miss you.\n\nAn anecdote about how long we’ve been ~like this~: when CBGB was closing, Carrie begged her parents to take her to one of the final concerts. Unsurprisingly, they were like “You are 15 years old. No.” Carly, also 15 at the time, cried and moaned “Nooo, I’m never going to get to go to CBGB!!!!” These are very true stories. You can ask our parents.\n\nWe do not speak of or even look at the men’s designer fashion store (or even use its name) that’s in CB’s place now. It’s offensive.\n\nSee our further watching section below to feast on some great docs about Hilly Kristal and CBGB. Just don’t watch the CBGB movie. It’s… not good.\n\nOur further reading section is also stacked, by the way.\n\nYou can listen to Neon Boys’ early demos here for a taste of what Television would become.\n\nYou can listen to the Brian Eno demos here to understand just how developed their final recorded music was.\n\nMarquee Moon was a commercial flop in the U.S., but it was a moderate hit in the U.K., and it ended up on countless year-end best-of reviews (not to mention more 10, 50, and 100 Best of All Time lists).\n\n20th Century Women gets early punk so right, but this quote is particularly spot on: “It’s like they’ve got this feeling, and they don’t have any skill, and they don’t want skill, because it’s really interesting what happens when your passion is bigger than the tools you have to deal with it. It creates this energy that’s raw. Isn’t it great?”\n\nWhat’s so fascinating about Television is that they were punks who had both — talent and passion — and were still able to exude raw energy.\n\nWe’ve discussed this before, but we love how diverse the CBGB microcosm was. Talk to us about it. We weren’t alive to witness it ourselves.\n\nThis episode goes out to Karin Berg and many, many other women whose histories have been buried. We’re doing our best to make sure their contributions aren’t forgotten.\n\nApparently “Venus” is about LSD? Or falling in love? Or both? Maybe don’t ask Tom Verlaine, because he’s actually said he doesn’t always understand what he’s writing.\n\nBut it basically feels like this.\n\nShoutout to basslines you can groove to. We love ‘em.\n\nOkay, but “Friction” totally sounds like it could be a Zeppelin song, despite sounding authentically Television at the same time. This just shows how complex their sound could be and how many influences Television pulled in.\n\nSee our further reading section below to check out the NME review of Marquee Moon and an insanely in-depth interview with Richard Lloyd that covers all the bases. Click on that link. Actually read it. It’s good. Seriously.\n\nLawrence Welk? Really? Really.\n\nFasten your seatbelts, grab your pool floaties, do whatever you gotta do. We’re about to tackle “Marquee Moon.”\n\nWhat. A. Side. One. Closer. Honestly. “Stairway to Heaven” is possibly the only song that can come close to comparing.\n\n“Marquee Moon” has several runtimes: 9:58 on the original vinyl pressing, 10:38 on subsequent rereleases, and 14 minutes or longer live. As much as we lust after having an OG copy of an album, we gotta say: those extra 40 seconds are so necessary.\n\nWhere were you when you first heard “Marquee Moon?”\n\nNo, really, someone wrote an opinion piece arguing that “Marquee Moon” is the best after party song ever.\n\nRanking it eighth in their flawed — we’ve mentioned our disdain for this list before (love you, Pitchfork, but cannot with this), but if you want to talk about it, by all means, contact us — list of the 200 best songs of the ‘70s, Pitchfork got something so, so right, describing “Marquee Moon” as: “punk’s contrarian think piece; a 10 minute odyssey for the dreamers and Deadheads inside CBGB.”\n\nThere is so. much. imagery. in this song. We would be here for hours if we went through it line by line, but here are the lyrics if you want to give it a stab.\n\nYes, that’s “Elevation” you hear sampled in “Lovefool.”\n\nTelevision’s legacy, though small in recorded output, is vast in influence, from playing an integral role in the incubator community of CBGB to influencing the sound of countless bands to follow them, from Pearl Jam to R.E.M. to the Strokes.\n\nTelevision still plays live dates together, although with guitarist Jimmy Rip in Richard Lloyd’s place.\n\nTelevision is hitting the festival circuit this summer, if you’re interested.\n\nRichard Lloyd is performing solo these days, including a set on June 3 in New York at the Bowery Electric. You know we’ll be there, so if you’re in the area, check it out (and come say hi).\n\nAs always, say hello on Facebook, Twitter, or email. We’ve had some wonderful conversations and made some great friends of the pod so far, and the more, the merrier.\n\nFavorite track(s): Marquee Moon and Friction (Carly) | Marquee Moon and See No Evil (Carrie)\n\nLeast favorite track: Torn Curtain (Carly) | Torn Curtain (Carrie)\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nBilly Ficca – drums\n\nRichard Lloyd – guitar (solo on tracks 1, 4, 5, and 6), vocals\n\nFred Smith – bass guitar, vocals\n\nTom Verlaine – guitar (solo on tracks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8), keyboards, lead vocals, production\n\nFurther watching:\n\nRichard Lloyd interview | 2013\n\nPunk Revolution NYC (Television comes in around part 4, but all parts are enthralling) | 2011\n\nRock and Roll Punk | 1995\n\nTom Verlaine interview | 1992\n\nHilly Kristal interview (Warning: you will get feels) | 1990\n\nThe Blank Generation | April 1976\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nTelevision’s Punk Epic “Marquee Moon,” 40 Years Later | Pitchfork (February 2017)\n\nHow Television Made Marquee Moon, the Best Punk Guitar Album Ever | The Observer (February 2017)\n\n1976-1978: CBGB’s House Photographer | Mashable (September 2014)\n\nFriction: The Making of Marquee Moon (aka the brilliant, super long Richard Lloyd interview) | Uncut Magazine (March 2012)\n\nTelevision’s Marquee Moon (from the 33 1/3 book series) | 2011\n\nThe Rise of New York’s ’70s Rock Scene | Vanity Fair (November 2002)\n\nMarquee Moon review | NME (February 1977)\n\nEverything is Combustible (Richard Lloyd’s forthcoming memoir) | October 2017\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEpisode 8: SONGS FOR BEGINNERS\n\nSONGS FOR BEGINNERS – Graham Nash – Atlantic Records – 1971\n\nThe year is 1970. America is in the midst of political turmoil: the Vietnam War faces extensive grassroots backlash, four students are killed at Kent State University in Ohio, and women strike for equality in New York. The music world is not without its share of anguish: the Beatles announce their breakup, American Top 40 is about to make scoring a hit record even more important to artists, and both Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin overdose and die within weeks of each other. Graham Nash is dealing with his own personal unrest. Fresh off of two breakups, romantically with Joni Mitchell and professionally with Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, and politically charged, Nash takes to the studio to record his debut solo album, Songs For Beginners.\n\nAssembled with the assistance of a slew of members of the crescendoing Laurel Canyon music community, Songs For Beginners succinctly captures the trifecta of traits that have defined Nash’s songwriting: gut-punches of raw emotion, crafted with a pop sensibility in mind, and full of rallying cries for social and political activism. Nash openly and unabashedly shares his most personal feelings, whether they are intimate depictions of heartbreak or outraged shouts, in a manner that will influence folk-rock and indie singer-songwriters for generations to come.\n\nIn this episode, we examine Graham Nash’s powerful lyrics and their lasting impression on society, discuss the wealth of music released during the Laurel Canyon era and the importance of creative incubator communities, and get deep into our feels about the relationship between Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell that fueled this album.\n\nListen to Songs For Beginners: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(and hey, while you’re at it, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be pod friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nSee our further watching section for a great short doc of Graham Nash’s history with the Hollies.\n\nWe love the music of Laurel Canyon. Here’s a playlist.\n\nWe long for the days of creative incubator communities. Here are some great articles about the Laurel Canyon scene, New York’s punk/post-punk/new wave scene, the Omaha indie rock movement, and the Market Hotel scene in Brooklyn worth checking out if you feel the same way.\n\nSO. MANY. PEOPLE. play on this album. Check out the personnel list below. It’s stacked.\n\nPop music doesn’t have to be meaningless, algorithm-pleasing, saccharine drivel. Pass it on.\n\nWe are going to talk so much about Joni Mitchell and feelings on this episode, so get ready.\n\nHere’s something tiny and lovely about Joni and Graham that will make your heart swell.\n\nBlue is Joni’s own breakup album, and it heavily features her relationship with Graham. It is one of the most perfect, heartbreaking, profound albums ever. (Sorry if you disagree, but also, if you do, who are you and has your heart been replaced with a cold battery?)\n\nA short history of Jerry Garcia just randomly deciding to play pedal steel guitar.\n\nDavid Crosby and Graham Nash both dated Joni Mitchell and remained good friends. They are not friends now. We don’t have nearly enough time to cover their petty drama right now, but the headline on this article about the current state of their relationship is quite entertaining.\n\nHere’s a definition of what the “silent majority” is, in case you weren’t alive for Nixon’s presidency or just didn’t pay attention in history class.\n\nThis is exactly how we feel when we listen to “Simple Man.”\n\nAlso, this.\n\n“If you hold sand too tightly in your hand, it will run through your fingers. Love, Joan.” It’s fine. We’re fine.\n\nWill never be over this photo of Joni and Graham, truly.\n\nSee the further watching links below for a fantastic interview with Graham from the Library of Congress. His anecdotes on love at first sight are around 45:20.\n\nObviously, they’d never work out, because Joni is the “Cactus Tree.”\n\nLet’s talk about “Chicago.”\n\nHere’s a summary of the Chicago Eight (later reduced to seven) trials.\n\nThis core theme — we must stand up for what is right and fight this systematic injustice — is still so unsettlingly relevant. Can we pause and think about that for a second?\n\nRead Graham’s thoughts about that changed “rules and regulations, who needs them?” lyric.\n\nGo see Graham Nash live, if you can. “Chicago” is still a showstopper.\n\nGraham Nash’s influence on artists can be seen anywhere from M. Ward to Fleet Foxes to Bon Iver (watch this live cover of “Simple Man”) and is vast. See 2010’s Be Yourself: A Tribute to Graham Nash’s Songs For Beginners to see just how sweeping.\n\nGraham Nash is still “shooting his mouth off” through art, whether it’s touring, recording new albums (his most recent, This Path Tonight, is quite good), painting, or photography. His philosophy is one we are behind 100 percent and one of the reasons why we have a great deal of respect for him: “This is what I do with my life. I get up in the morning and create. What an incredible life I get to lead. [….] I just want to make sure that, with every second I have left of my life, I need to be creating.”\n\nAs always, hit us up with your thoughts on today’s episode or just to say hey.

Formed in the south Bronx in 1976, prolific DJ Grandmaster Flash and his team of MCs (Melle Mel, Kidd Creole, Rahiem, Mr. Ness, and Keith Cowboy) started playing and rapping at house parties, with local fame and notoriety soon to follow. When “Rapper’s Delight” became the first hip-hop record to garner national attention in 1979, the door opened for the Furious Five to release their sound to the masses and come to commercial and critical success.\n\nReleased against a backdrop of an economically ravaged and crime-ridden New York City, The Message is widely heralded as the record that made social-consciousness a subject that could be covered by hip-hop. It’s an album that has received considerable praise, from creating a template from which hip-hop could expand, to setting technological standards by blending hip-hop and electronic music, foreshadowing the evolution of EDM.\n\nIn this episode, we examine The Message’s connection to modern hip-hop and rap, speak about the lyrical and musical techniques that excite us every time we listen to it, and take a look at the music that influenced the album, as well as what makes it an enduring influence on artists today.\n\nListen to The Message: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nHere’s a brief history of rap (as seen previously in our Tom Tom Club notes)\n\nSylvia Robinson was a total BAMF — this speaks a bit to why Carly is totally obsessed with her.\n\nHere’s some further reading on how funk influences hip-hop.\n\nWe love basslines. We love them entirely too much. Enjoy this playlist.\n\nHmm… doesn’t “It’s Nasty” sound so familiar? Oh, right. Yeah. That’s because it’s basically “Genius of Love.” Just like hip-hop references what came before it, we’re referencing what came before this episode. As in, revisit our Tom Tom Club episode and notes for a refresher on this particular bop and its history of being an iconic, oft-sampled song.\n\nLaura Levine is up there with Henry Diltz and Mick Rock as one of our favorite music photographers — you should really check out her work.\n\nOne of Levine’s iconic photos of Tina Weymouth and Grandmaster Flash for New York Rocker (a very cool local magazine that ran from 1976-1982, RIP) was included in a MoMA exhibition called “Looking at Music 3.0” in 2011\n\nHi, let’s talk about vocoders for a minute.\n\nHere’s a Wikipedia article that will explain what exactly they are much better than Carrie can.\n\nKraftwerk’s Autobahn is a great way to introduce yourself to what extensive usage of a vocoder sounds like. Listen to it. Maybe don’t listen to Neil Young’s Trans. (Or do?)\n\nWhile Zapp incorporated vocoder into their funk music, “Scorpio” took that and gave it a rap edge. So much so that Complex called “Scorpio” the greatest vocoder song ever.\n\nHere’s that enlightening video from Vox we talked about. It’s very technical and is not Kanye-stanning. Bets are, if you listen to this podcast, you have a pretty open mind; give it a chance.\n\nKanye West is an innovative producer because he views the human voice as the greatest instrument, and his “Scorpio”-influenced usage of the vocoder and electronic music-influence has pushed hip-hop and rap into a new direction over the past 10 years. Building these family trees of music is fun.\n\nYou can’t understand “The Message” without understanding the history of New York in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. We went into the CliffsNotes version, but to go more in-depth, we recommend documentaries like NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell or Blackout (links below in our Further Watching section), or reading Love Goes to Buildings on Fire.\n\n“The Message” is still excruciatingly relevant. New York didn’t get cleaner without some people paying a price. The problems evident in “The Message” still exist today, just amplified in smaller pressure cookers, exacerbated by issues like gentrification, the war on drugs, and the way the war on poverty has turned into a war on the poor.\n\nThe lineage of “The Message” is evident in current hip-hop, from Jay-Z to Kendrick Lamar. We’ll have some examples in our master playlist on Spotify.\n\nThe recording of “The Message” actually caused some discord within the group. According to this video note by Rahiem, each person auditioned to have a part on the track, and Melle Mel was the winner — but the rest weren’t pleased that it was just him.\n\n“The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel” was a bonus track released first as a single, then as the final track on the 1982 UK release and subsequent reissues.\n\nGrandmaster Flash revolutionized DJing with his quick mix theory, which you can read more about here. Science and math nerds, rejoice!\n\nFor the rest of us, basically, it’s called the get down.\n\nGrandmaster Flash and the Furious Five doesn’t have a happy ending as a group; they’ve broken up twice and performed under different combinations of alliances with no real clear chance of getting the original group back together. Animosity between some members still exists: in 2015, Scorpio made headlines when he accused Grandmaster Flash of being a “fake” DJ.\n\nWe have several issues with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s induction process, and we’re pretty sure we’re not alone — DM us, @ us, email us — we’d love to talk.\n\nPssst — if you like us, shares us with your friends, and please rate and review us in the iTunes store.
