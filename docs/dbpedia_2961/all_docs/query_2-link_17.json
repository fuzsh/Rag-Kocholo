        "text": "Hi Katy Question for Simon:\n\nI read some years ago that you wrote a song called \"On my own in Tel Aviv\", but that Alex Sadkin advised you to drop it on the grounds that it was \"too steamy\"(!). Is \"Tel Aviv\" as we know it the same song, minus the words? If so, is there any chance of a new recording with the words added again?\n\nBest wishes, Chris the Boy\n\n\"Dear Chris, I don't think that Alex Sadkin had anything to do really with the re-recording of Tel-Aviv. The original version was recorded at Air studios in London when we recorded the first \"Girls on Film\" demo. I'm not 100 % sure why it got scrapped, probably because we just moved on and didn't feel that the song was right for us. Frankly, I don't think we'll ever do that version of the song again but maybe a copy of the demo will surface someday. I do know that I haven't got a copy myself. thanx s\""
