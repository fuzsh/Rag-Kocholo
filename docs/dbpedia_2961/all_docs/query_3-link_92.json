        "text": "NIGHTCLUBBING ‚Äì Grace Jones ‚Äì Island Records ‚Äì 1981\n\nMusic. Fashion. Art. Icon. Attempting to mix these to create an internationally acclaimed persona would be a daunting task for anyone with less magnetism than Grace Jones, who succeeded so overwhelmingly at becoming a cross-genre ‚ÄúIt Girl‚Äù that she forged a path for future generations of singular artists to follow.\n\nAlready a well-known model and disco queen, Grace Jones began recording music in the late 1970s. The records did modestly well, but in 1979, Island Records founder and producer Chris Blackwell began working with her on a new musical aesthetic, combining funk, disco, reggae, and new wave styles to create something new ‚Äî and uniquely Grace Jones. With the talents of Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Uziah Thompson, and other musicians who comprised the Compass Point All-Stars, the sessions that became Nightclubbing would go on to influence music through each subsequent decade.\n\nAs we seek to bridge the gap between the generations, there are few better examples of lasting musical, sartorial, and artistic inspiration than Grace Jones. In today‚Äôs episode on her 1981 album Nightclubbing, we explore the effervescent enigma of a woman who left her Jamaican home to travel the world, only to return to the Caribbean to create the music that would become the focal point of her legacy. We dive deep into the relationships between music and art, between the artist and the image, and between icon and legacy.\n\nListen to Nightclubbing: iTunes | Spotify | YouTube\n\nSubscribe on iTunes\n\n(ps ‚Äî while you‚Äôre there, please rate and review us in the iTunes store so more people can discover us and we can all be friends who talk about music together!)\n\nEpisode notes and postscript corrections\n\nWe‚Äôve mentioned this before, but once again, Chris Blackwell is a BAMF.\n\nAs is Alex Sadkin.\n\nRevisit our episode on Betty Davis‚Äôs They Say I‚Äôm Different and let us know if you see any similarities between Betty and Grace.\n\nTURN UP FOR COMPASS POINT üëè üëè üëè\n\nHere‚Äôs a rad podcast we literally just found that serves as a mini audio-documentary on the studio and some of the cool people who passed through and the records they made.\n\nSly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Barry Reynolds, and Uziah ‚ÄúSticky‚Äù Thompson are all killer musicians on their own, but the sum = magic\n\nPeep our further reading for more on them.\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about this album cover!\n\nFirst and foremost: Grace Jones is the OG baddie, textbook unfuckwithable.\n\nEspecially, let‚Äôs talk about John Paul Goude. Here‚Äôs one article about their working relationship, but check out our further reading for more.\n\nHere‚Äôs that ‚ÄúI came to slay‚Äù Grace Jones-Pee Wee‚Äôs Christmas Special appearance we were talking about.\n\nThis album is full of cover songs, so check out our master playlist on Spotify for all the side by side comparisons.\n\nCheck out the further reading links below for a piece about Grace Jones‚Äôs androgynous impact on fashion and music that‚Äôs worth reading, if you‚Äôre interested.\n\nTwo words: Fonce Mizell.\n\nHere‚Äôs some science stuff about how Compass Point‚Äôs engineers EQ‚Äôd the bass and the drums the way they did that creates that cool, loud-but-open sound.\n\nHere are the translated lyrics to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Seen That Face Before (Libertango),‚Äù if you‚Äôd like a more thorough explanation than Carrie‚Äôs subpar French can offer. (She tried. Also, if anyone wants to tutor her, she‚Äôs willing to re-learn.)\n\nVisuals are a huge part of this album ‚Äî see our further watching section below for some great links.\n\nHere‚Äôs more info about ‚ÄúDemolition Man‚Äù so you can learn what exactly Sting was talking about when he wrote it.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve Done It Again‚Äù is probably about an LSD trip, so, there‚Äôs that.\n\nHere are the lyrics to LCD Soundsystem‚Äôs ‚ÄúLosing My Edge‚Äù so you can see the interestingly similar ‚ÄúI was there [insert historical event here]‚Äù structure. We see you, James Murphy.\n\nFinally, worth repeating here, the final paragraph of Grace‚Äôs memoir: ‚ÄúIf people complain that I am not doing enough of my old material, not performing all the hits, I will stand in front of them, a formlessness that engulfs all form. I will put on another hat, crack my whip, scatter fireflies, fix them with a five-thousand-year-old stare, fit to fight to the bitter end, becoming a ghost with the passing of time. I will be ready for the afterlife, for my bones to be buried in the mountains of Jamaica, or the canals of Venice, or the dark side of the moon, or under the ground in the cities I‚Äôve lived in and loved. And I will say: Do you want to move forward with me, or not? Do you want to know where I am going next? It‚Äôs time for something else to happen.‚Äú\n\nFavorite track(s): Feel Up and Pull Up To The Bumper (Carly) | Pull Up To The Bumper and Feel Up (Carrie)\n\nLeast favorite track: Art Groupie (Carly) | I‚Äôve Seen That Face Before (Libertango) (Carrie)\n\nAlbum credits:\n\nWally Badarou ‚Äì keyboards\n\nMonte Browne ‚Äì rhythm guitar\n\nMikey Chung ‚Äì guitar\n\nMasai Delon ‚Äì vocals\n\nTyrone Downie ‚Äì keyboards, vocals\n\nSly Dunbar ‚Äì drums, syndrums\n\nJack Emblow ‚Äì accordion\n\nGrace Jones ‚Äì vocals, backing vocals\n\nBarry Reynolds ‚Äì guitar\n\nJess Roden ‚Äì vocals\n\nRobbie Shakespeare ‚Äì bass\n\nMel Speller ‚Äì percussion, vocals\n\nUziah Thompson ‚Äì percussion\n\nChris Blackwell, Alex Sadkin ‚Äì production\n\nFurther Watching:\n\nGrace Jones: One Man Show | 1982\n\nGrace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami (trailer) | Forthcoming documentary\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nI‚Äôll Never Write My Memoirs | Jones‚Äôs irony, please memoir (2015)\n\nGrace Jones: Warm Leatherette (re-issue review) | Pitchfork (June 2016)\n\nWelcome to Planet Grace Jones | Paper Magazine (October 2015)\n\nGrace Jones Explores Androgyny in a New Memoir | Vogue (September 2015)\n\nAs Much As I Can, As Black As I Am: The Queer History of Grace Jones | Pitchfork (August 2015)\n\nI‚Äôve Seen That Face Before: Looking back on Grace Jones‚Äôs iconic Nightclubbing with the people who made it happen | Fact Magazine (May 2014)\n\nGrace Jones: Nightclubbing (deluxe re-issue review) | Pitchfork (May 2014)\n\nGrace Jones pulls up to the bumper | The Guardian (June 2011)\n\nChris Blackwell | Interview Magazine (March 2009)\n\nGrace Jones by Jean Paul Goude | V Magazine (February 2009)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
