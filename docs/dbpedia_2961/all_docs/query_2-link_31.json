        "text": "‘Hold Me Now’ is a song by British band the Thompson Twins. It was written as the first single from their fourth studio album, Into the Gap which was released in 1983. The song was written by the English singer, songwriter, composer, musician, record producer and lead vocalist Tom Bailey and the New Zealand musician Alannah Currie, along with the multi-instrumentalist, stylings guru Joe Leeway who provided the falsetto backing vocals. The song was produced by Alex Sadkin and Tom Bailey, and it peaked at #4 on the UK Singles Chart and it went to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band’s highest charting single in the US, and it was certified gold. The song is a mid-tempo new wave song that uses a varied instrumentation, including keyboards, a xylophone, a piano and Latin percussion.\n\nBailey and Currie were on-again, off-again couple and like all couples they went through different stages. Certain things can tear a couple apart and others stuff can bond them together. They got married in 1991 and they had two children together. This wrote song was written after a heated argument that they had resolved. They decided that this was an interesting emotional subject, discussing what it feels like to get back together again after a separation and this song contains the kind of ideas that come up and the way that emotions and physical attraction are brought together. Inevitably problems come up, stress rises and arguments happen, so nothing ever stays perfect forever. For some lucky people love is eternal, but for others life wins out over love.\n\nThis song has a permanence about it because it was triggered by a real relationship. This song is full of memories of when this couple was in a happy relationship and it discusses simple things like a picture hanging on a wall that will generate these thoughts again. In the song, the singer Bailey makes a desperate plea, although he’s not even sure what caused the damage or what he is trying to apologize for. He seems eager to work through their problems and move on, asking Currie to hold him, stay with him and love him again. When someone really needs to be comforted, they ask for a hug or to be held and there is nothing like the warmth and safety of being held in comforting arms to make a person feel better. Holding on to someone that you care about can help them feel closer to you, it can make the pain disappear and let the love begin again.\n\nWell, I have a picture\n\nPinned to my wall\n\nAn image of you and of me and we’re laughing\n\nAnd loving it all\n\nLook at our life now\n\nIt’s tattered and torn\n\nWe fuss and we fight and delight in the tears\n\nWe cry until dawn\n\nOh, hold me now\n\nOh, whoa, warm my heart\n\nStay with me\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nYou say I’m a dreamer\n\nWe’re two of a kind\n\nBoth of us searching for some perfect world we know\n\nWe’ll never find\n\nSo perhaps I should leave here\n\nYeah, yeah, go far away\n\nYou know that there’s nowhere that I’d rather be than\n\nWith you here today\n\nHold me now\n\nOh, oh, warm my heart\n\nStay with me\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nOh hold me now\n\nOh, oh, warm my heart\n\nStay with me\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nOh\n\nYou ask if I love you\n\nWhat can I say?\n\nYou know that I do and if this is just one of those\n\nGames that we play\n\nSo I’ll sing you a new song\n\nPlease don’t cry anymore\n\nI’ll ask your forgiveness though I don’t know\n\nJust what I’m asking it for\n\nHold me now (hold me in your loving arms)\n\nOh, whoa, warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)\n\nStay with me (ooh, stay with me)\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nHold me now (hold me in your loving arms)\n\nOh, whoa, warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)\n\nStay with me (ooh, stay with me)\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nHold me now (hold me in your loving arms)\n\nOh, oh, warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)\n\nStay with me (ooh, stay with me)\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nHold me now (hold me in your loving arms)\n\nOh, oh, warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)\n\nStay with me (ooh, stay with me)\n\nLet loving start, let loving start\n\nThe challenge today is to focus on this song and use it for a short story, a piece of flash fiction, or a poem that you can share with the WordPress writing community. There is no need to stick with this song, as if you like to write about another Thompson Twins song, or a song done by Duncan Sheik, or another song by a New Wave group, or one that was played by a Mainstream Pop group, then go with that. You might also go with a song that is about a couple getting back together. Maybe you could write a post about a song about someone that makes you feel good when you see them. If you would like to write about holding someone in your arms, that would also work.\n\nThe whole point of this MM Music challenge is to get you to think, to trigger something so that you can show how creative you are and everyone is welcome to participate. This challenge is very loose, so pretty much whatever you come up with will be acceptable. I try to throw some ideas out there for you and if they seem right, then go with it. You could write about a different song that features a xylophone, or you could write a song that has something to do with a picture.\n\nMindlovemisery’s Menagerie brings you a dose of fetish, good friends and an incomparable muse and Dylan Hughes will be here next Friday on December 4 with her First Line Friday and she will provide the first line for your post and then you get to write whatever comes afterward, with the length, genre, and structure being completely left up to you. I will be back on Friday, December 11 with another MM Music Challenge where we will discuss the song ‘Delta Dawn’. When you are finished writing your post, create a ping back to this post, but you can also place your link in the comments section below if you desire. This Mindlovemisery’s Menagerie Music Challenge has a special feature called Mr. Linky, which will allow you to instantly link your post after you click the Mr. Linky Button, and permit everyone to read your post sooner that way, and then follow the directions that are given."
