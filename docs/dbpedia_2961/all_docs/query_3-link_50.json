        "text": "Tag Archives: Thompson Twins\n\nReleased today in 1985: King For A Day\n\nTaken from pivotal album Here’s To Future Days, King For A Day was Thompson Twins’ last Top 40 in the UK. Some of the unfortunate incidents surrounding the creation of the album have already been covered in this blog. Most of the songs on it were written in early 1985, as Alannah Currie told Record Mirror a year later: “We were living in a place called Mount Le Jolie, which was a sort of 15th century house in the middle of nowhere. It was a freezing cold place with no central heating. We had to go down to the supermarket and buy space heaters, and we bought one each. We just sat for a month and a half in front of these space heaters. There was absolutely nothing to do for entertainment, except go down to the local supermarket, which was centrally heated, and wander round. It was the coldest winter Europe had ever had. Birds were literally freezing and falling out of the sky.”\n\nThe location had an effect on the album’s lyrical themes. “This whole place was bizarre,” she continued. “This house had all animal heads and old organs, a sort of very strange old museum full of centuries of this family’s possessions. It was very weird, that’s why I think a lot of the songs on the album were about dreams. We wrote a lot of them there. There was nothing else to do except dream, write songs, and look outside. It was just a wasteland of white. A few times we got snowed in and couldn’t get out. Then the telephone lines went down and the electricity kept going off. We fought like mad and threw things at each other, but had some good times as well. Got drunk and fell down in the snow a few times.”\n\nThe ended up with a record they were pleased with, as things came together in the end. “It could all fall apart just as easily as it came together,” Tom Bailey said, “and we’ll be similarly powerless to prevent it.” Soon, the existing arrangements for Thompson Twins would fall apart and Joe Leeway would leave. It’s difficult to know if, at the time of the interview (December 1985), that anyone in the band could see this coming. The Record Mirror piece ended with the following comment from bailey: “We don’t plan that far ahead, or we’d just turn into business people, which would spoil it for us and spoil it for our fans.”\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Oct. 11\n\n1985\n\nTHOMPSON TWINS King For A Day (Arista TWINS7)\n\nReleased today in 1988: In The Name Of Love ’88\n\nWhen it was first released, the writers’ credit for Thompson Twins’s In The Name of Love was given to “T. T.’s”, indicating that all the members of the group at the time had contributed to it. (The lyrics were Tom Bailey’s alone.) When it was remixed by Shep Pettibone for reissue in 1988, Thompson Twins were down to two members and the individual names of the writers were specified on the label. Originally recorded for the 1982 album Set, there were at that time seven Thompson Twins. In the US, a revised edition of this album was released with an amended track list including a couple of songs taken from their debut album A Product Of… (which hadn’t been released there) and a new title: the Americans named the album In The Name of Love after the song, although it hadn’t been a hit there. Nor had it here for that matter, but the following year a string of hits for the group began both in the UK and the US.\n\nDuring their most successful period, Thompson Twins comprised three members: Bailey, Alannah Currie and Joe Leeway. Leeway left in 1986, and Bailey and Currie (now a couple in their personal lives as well as professionally) continued as a duo. The hits had already begun to dry up though, and they had no Top 10 hits in the UK in the second half of the 80s. There were better chart returns in the US, where their album Here’s To Future Days had yielded two Top 10 hits. The remix of In The Name of Love was one of the few singles to do better here than over there: it didn’t make the Billboard chart but made #46 here. It was released to help promote the US compilation The Best Of Thompson Twins/Greatest Mixes.\n\nBefore the decade was out, Currie and Bailey almost made a return to the Top 10 in the UK when Debbie Harry took a song they had written, I Want That Man, to #13 in 1989. Thompson Twins was still a going concern at that time, but they were regularly offering their services to other artists. Bailey had contributed to a solo album by Phil Thornalley, released shortly before he started to front the new line-up of Johnny Hates Jazz, who had recently lost lead vocalist Clark Datchler.\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Oct. 3\n\n1980\n\nADAM ANT Dog Eat Dog (CBS CBS8039)\n\nECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN (Ian McCulloch) Puppet (Korova KOW11)\n\nGEN X (Billy Idol) Dancing With Myself (Chrysalis CHS2444)\n\nThe PROFESSIONALS 1-2-3 (Virgin VS376)\n\nSKIDS Goodbye Civilian (Virgin CHEAP5)\n\n1983\n\nUB40 Please Don’t Make Me Cry (DEP International DEP8)\n\n1986\n\nSWING OUT SISTER Breakout (Mercury SWING2)\n\n1988\n\nBREATHE Jonah [Re-issue] (Siren SRN95)\n\nTHOMPSON TWINS In The Name Of Love ’88 (Arista 111 808)\n\nReleased today in 1985: Roll Over\n\nTom Bailey being taken ill at the end of March 1985 threw Thompson Twins into chaos temporarily. The band was in London, preparing for the release and promotion of their new single Roll Over, when Bailey collapsed in the hotel they were staying at. “It was really strange,” Alannah Currie told Record Mirror. “I went to take some clothes into his room this morning and he fainted in front of me; it was really scary. I called the doctors and they said he was just exhausted. He’s going back to Paris tonight to a clinic and we’re hoping he’ll get better quickly. He’s been looking bad for the last couple of days. He’s been under a lot of strain as the producer of our new album.”\n\nThat new album was Here’s To Future Days. There had been some difficulties with it already: Thompson Twins had parted company with original producer Alex Sadkin, who had helmed their last two hugely successful albums. Bailey had then brought in Nile Rodgers as co-producer instead, junking the material already worked on with Sadkin. A new recording of their late ’84 hit Lay Your Hands On Me was made with Rodgers and included on the album when it was finally released, nearly a year after the original version of the song had appeared in the charts as a single. In the meantime, Bailey’s illness led to a re-think of the promotion of the album – and of their other commitments: a UK tour was cancelled.\n\nRoll Over, originally intended to be the first official single from the new album, did make it to the shops: but only just. With Bailey unable to help with promotion (it was released less than two weeks after his collapse), the decision was taken to pull it. It was withdrawn on its date of release and copies returned to Arista were destroyed. Bailey later got cold feet about the song altogether and it wasn’t included on the final track list for Here’s To Future Days. Instead, the anti-drugs song Don’t Mess With Doctor Dream was used as a single just prior to the album’s appearance.\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Apr. 12\n\n1985\n\nFAT BOYS Jail House Rap (Sutra U9123)\n\nHoward JONES Look Mama (WEA HOW7)\n\nTHOMPSON TWINS Roll Over (Arista TWINS8)\n\nReleased today in 1983: Love On Your Side\n\nLove On Your Side is from Thompson Twins’s foruth LP Quick Step And Side Kick, produced by Alex Sadkin.\n\nSadkin was a member of Compass Point All Stars, a loose collective of musicians, vocalists, producers, engineers and writers based at the state-of-the-art Compass Point recording studio built by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell in 1977 in Nassau, Bahamas. In essence, the All Stars were a ‘house band’ who could back any of the name artists who were recording at Compass Point; a key early critical and commercial success was the trio of albums released by Grace Jones at the start of the 1980s which typified the Compass Point sound: the distinctive rhythm section of Sly [Dunbar} and Robbie [Shakespeare] and the slick production values exhibited by Sadkin and Blackwell.\n\nSadkin had started his career as a session musician (in particular bass guitar and sax) before training as a mastering engineer. He produced or mixed records for a wide variety of artists including, in addition to Thompson Twins, Smash Hits cover stars Bob Marley, Sal Solo’s Classix Nouveau, Duran Duran (and one of its spin-offs – see yesterday’s article by following the link at the foot of this one), and Mick Hucknall’s Simply Red. Other notable successes were with Joe Cocker (another co-production with Blackwell on the album Sheffield Steel), Talking Heads (mixing the album Speaking In Tongues) and Foreigner (co-producing the Australian, American, British and Canadian #1 hit I Want To Know What Love Is and its parent album).\n\nIn July 1987, Sadkin was back at Compass Point recording with Jonathan Perkins’ band for Chrysalis records when he was killed in a car accident. He was 38. Engineer Will Gosling, Perkins and the band members who were with them at the time survived, but the album was ultimately abandoned: some tracks were later re-recorded and emerged on Perkins’ Snake Talk album in 1989. “Alex had an inner peace and a non-judgemental acceptance of people rarely seen in the music industry,” Perkins would say. “He was an ‘old soul’ – his serene presence, vibrations and musical ideas inspired anyone that worked or hung out with him.”\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Jan. 14\n\n1983\n\nCHINA CRISIS Christian (Virgin VS562)\n\nECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN (Ian McCulloch) The Cutter (Korova KOW26)\n\nTHOMPSON TWINS Love On Your Side (Arista ARIST504)"
