        "text": "''WHEN I make an album, I usually try to do something totally different,'' Billy Joel said the other day. And true to his word the 33-year-old singer, who will be performing tonight at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, L.I., and on New Year's Eve at Madison Square Garden, has indeed shifted gears on his latest album, ''The Nylon Curtain.'' With its use of sound effects, aural montage, exotic orchestration, and thickly overdubbed vocals, ''The Nylon Curtain''is a far cry from the pared-down rock of ''Glass Houses'' and harks back to the late 60's psychedelia of the Beatles.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' has also stirred up some controversy because its centerpiece is a haunting musical epilogue to the Vietnam War entitled ''Goodnight Saigon.'' The album cut begins and ends with a sputtering helicopter as it approaches and leaves a jungle site. These sound effects frame Mr. Joel's first-person-plural monologue of American paratroopers looking back at the war in sorrow. The verses are linked by a hearty male chorus repeating the refrain, ''and we would all go down together,'' which conjures up a ghostly brigade chanting from beyond the grave.\n\n''I wasn't trying to make a comment on the war, but writing about the soldier as a person,'' Mr. Joel explained. ''The song isn't a political statement, even though it's been interpreted as one. The European press found it too pro-American, but in South Korea they won't release the record because the Government think it's too anti-American.''\n\nMr. Joel has also received some complaints because he himself did not see military service. ''Of course I was hesitant to write about Vietnam, because I wasn't there,'' Mr. Joel said. ''But a lot of my friends fought in Vietnam and two close friends were killed. But the people I knew who fought and came back encouraged me to write it. I picked their brains and asked them what music they listened to, what they did, and how they felt. The feeling of camaraderie, of only having one another for support, was something they all still share.''\n\n''Goodnight Saigon'' is one of several very sobering songs on ''The Nylon Curtain.'' The current hit, ''Allentown,'' which also is a first-person monologue, describes the despair and anger of an unemployed steelworker. ''Laura'' clinically details the way a parent can instill a child with guilt. ''Scandinavian Skies,'' evokes a bad drug experience. ''Pressure'' is about living in a state of extreme anxiety. And ''Surprises,'' in which Mr. Joel views his whole life as a mysterious series of changes, was inspired by the singer's motorcycle accident last April, when he injured his left thumb.\n\n''The biggest thing I learned from the accident was that when you think you have all the control in the world, suddenly some one is going to run a red light,'' Mr. Joel said. ''Writing the song lyric, I tried to remember, almost through self-hypnosis, what was going through my mind subconsciously at the time of the accident. It's very stream-of-consciousness, and to this day, I don't know what some of it means.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
