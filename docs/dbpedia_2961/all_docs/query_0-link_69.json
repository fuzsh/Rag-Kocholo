I was puzzled because all four tracks listed on the cover were cuts from Duran Duran’s first two LPs – it seemed a pointless redundancy. I wondered not what Carnival was, but why it was.\n\nWhy Carnival was\n\nReleased in September 1982, Carnival was part of a marketing plan aimed at establishing Duran Duran as a dance-oriented group. By serving up a record of extended renditions of their singles – known as “night versions” among fans – EMI intended to get club DJs playing the band’s music.\n\nIf the EP’s title is any indication, it’s supposed to be a literal Duran Duran dance party.\n\nNot all versions of Carnival were created equal, however. Two main variants were issued to serve the band’s burgeoning fan bases in North America and Europe.\n\nThe North American version\n\nThe track listing and sleeve colour palette align the North American version closely with the Rio LP:\n\nSide 1: Hungry Like the Wolf (night version); and Girls on Film (night version)\n\nSide 2: My Own Way (remix); and Hold Back the Rain (remix)\n\nThis edition of Carnival is essentially just the first half of the Rio album, pared down. Noteworthy about this release:\n\nOddball track: Girls on Film is the clear outsider here, probably added to the running order due to its fame in the band’s X-rated music video\n\nRio conspicuously absent: It likely wasn’t included because it hadn’t yet been released as an official single in North America\n\nKershenbaum paw prints: The Rio tracks were all remixed by American producer, David Kershenbaum\n\nI argue Kershenbaum’s heavy-handed mixes make the songs less danceable, but concede his “more is more” approach probably helped them translate better on AM radio. He’d later be invited to remix the rest of side 1 of Rio for a late-1982 North American re-release.\n\nPart of Carnival’s legacy, then, was to saddle North American listeners with Kershenbaum’s bombastic treatment of the Rio album. (To this day I don’t have a copy on vinyl with the original, superior, mixes intact. Grr.)\n\nThe European version\n\nEuropean Carnival came in a similar sleeve, but its sterile white-and-blue hearkened to the band’s new romantic aesthetic, foreshadowing a strikingly different track listing:\n\nSide 1: Hungry Like the Wolf (night version); and Rio (night version)\n\nSide 2: Planet Earth (night version); and Girls on Film (night version)\n\nThis edition of Carnival is unquestionably the better of the two. While its North American counterpart merely offers “Rio lite,” European fans were treated to something special:\n\nEarly greatest hits: Drawing equally from Duran Duran’s debut and sophomore albums, the record functions as a succinct “best-of” package\n\nHigher quality: With Planet Earth and Rio installed, the European EP boasts 100% premium material\n\nPerfect companion: Containing night versions of all tracks, the European edition of Carnival is an outstanding complement to the band’s first two LPs\n\nCuriously, the record is anti-chronological: the Rio tracks appear on side 1 and songs from their debut are on side 2. (I discovered this for the first time in writing this post.) Pro-tip: If you get your hands on this version of Carnival, start with side 2.\n\nOddball Carnival versions and mixes\n\nIt’s worth noting the night versions for both Girls on Film and Rio don’t match up with their counterparts on their respective 12” singles.\n\nCarnival uses an ethereal mix of Girls on Film that’s ironically less danceable to my ears than the more muscular 12” version. I can’t say one is better than the other – although the Carnival mix may sacrifice some drive and propulsion, it more than makes up for it with texture and atmosphere.\n\nRio’s night version is an extended Kershenbaum remix that’s distinct from Rio (part 2) on the 12” single. As with Hungry Like the Wolf, Rio’s night version presents an instrumental verse and chorus before allowing Simon Le Bon’s vocals into the mix. Andy Hamilton’s guest appearance on sax is also dropped out mid-solo. By cutting these lead elements, the night version exposes the oft-overlooked melodic groove of John Taylor’s bass and provides clarity to Andy Taylor’s superb guitar tone.\n\nEncountering Carnvial: redux\n\nAs luck would have it, the second time I came across Carnival was the summer of 1984, when my family was on a trip to the Netherlands. I was set to embark on a quest for hard-to-find 12” singles from Duran Duran’s back catalog when I stumbled across a copy of the EP (EMI Dutch pressing No. 1A 062Z-64942) at the Free Record Shop in Leiden.\n\nI chose to purchase it not because I needed it – remember, I already had all the songs listed on the cover – I just felt compelled to acquire it. You could say it was the first record I ever collected for its own sake.\n\nImagine my shock when I brought the record back, slipped it out of its paper-thin sleeve and the songs’ true super-identities were revealed on the label: four whole night versions! I was in a state of shock – it satisfied so many wants at once.\n\nThat rush of excitement when I was 14 is still vivid to me today, and it’s a big part of what makes Carnival such a standout in my collection. I honestly wouldn’t trade it for a pristine butcher cover.\n\nEpilogue\n\nThere’s lots of reasons to feel sorry for young people today, but one of them is that few will ever know the thrill of finding a gem of a record when they least expect it.\n\nThere used to be a time when great music was sometimes scarce, and legwork had to be expended to find what you needed (yes, needed). If you were lucky, a day would come when you’d see the object of your desire out in the wild at a reasonable price, and you could get your paws on it and say “mine!”\n\nSomehow, patience, dogged persistence and surprise can make great music sound even sweeter. Case in point: The Carnival EP.\n\nWelcome to my review of Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Pleasuredome LP\n\nIs it a blend of prog and pop, or an exercise in excess?\n\nWhen I was in junior high school, none of my friends “got” Frankie. Only I “got” Frankie. No one but me appreciated the quirkiness, humour and – most importantly – solid craft and musicianship surrounding the band. (Note I used the word “surrounding” on purpose.)\n\nAll these qualities are in abundant quantity on the group’s 1984 debut LP, Welcome to the Pleasuredome. Although it’s true that the record is excessive and wildly uneven, when all’s said and done the overreach is part of the charm. I’ll explain.\n\nHigh concept or cash grab?\n\nProducer Trevor Horn was the chief architect of Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s records and to this day I can’t decide what he hoped to achieve with the Pleasuredome LP – it’s something of an enigma:\n\nOne part of me thinks his concept was to build a prog-inspired masterpiece, disguised as bubblegum pop.\n\nAnother part of me thinks he and his label, ZTT, sought to capitalize on Frankie’s popularity by releasing the biggest, costliest record possible.\n\nThe case for mock prog (TM)\n\nA convincing argument can be made that Horn had the nerve and good humour to consciously apply prog-rock norms to a top 40-oriented pop record:\n\nTwo-LP set: To start with, it’s a double album. Has any pop group ever issued a debut on two records before? The audacity is pretty awesome.\n\nEpic title track: The album opens with a marathon title track that occupies the entirety of side one. This stuff is normally the domain of Rush, ELP and Yes.\n\nProg pedigree of musicians: Speaking of Yes, at least two members of Pleasuredome’s session personnel are veterans of that band (guitarist Steve Howe and Horn himself), providing yet another potential clue to the record’s true intent. In fact, save for singer Holly Johnson, the lads in Frankie were cast as bit players on their own album.\n\nThe case for opportunism\n\nBut maybe I’m getting too cerebral and idealistic about the motives behind Pleasuredome. Frankie had delivered three smash singles by mid-1984 and the record-buying public’s appetite for their music was ravenous, especially in England. It’s conceivable ZTT calculated the public would buy any album by the band, even if a good proportion of it was stuffed with filler.\n\nAnd I’m not being subjective when I call some of Pleasuredome’s tracks “filler”: for starters, four of them are cover versions. And the 15-minute-long opener may have been less about artistic ambition and more about padding out the band’s scant original material to the fullest possible extent.\n\nTwo distinct halves\n\nOf course all these reflections about the album come in hindsight. When I first listened through the entire album, my overwhelming recollection is that it had two distinct halves:\n\nThe first half (record one) is a highlight-filled dance party polished to the nth degree\n\nThe second half (record two) pales by comparison, consisting mostly of anemic, uninspired material\n\nIt all blasts off with the immense title track – let’s get on with an in-depth analysis.\n\nRecord one – side A\n\nWhen Frankie originally demoed Welcome to the Pleasuredome – the song – in 1982, it was a slithery, minimalist dance number. Check it out here:\n\nFor its titular album, however, Horn stretched the song out into a dense, shifting multi-parted monster lasting a quarter of an hour. And lo, behold its glory: the song’s arrival is heralded with reverb-laden operatic voices and grandiose fanfare. It’s the sound I’d expect to hear with the opening of heaven’s gates.\n\nIt’s also reminiscent of the music that occurs when earthlings encounter the otherworldly monolith in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. I believe this was on purpose and is meant to deliver a tongue-in-cheek message: this record is the next evolution in pop music – get ready.\n\nThe fanfare dies and a gentle acoustic guitar interlude drifts the listener into a lush tropical environment teeming with exotic life. We’ve landed in the pleasuredome, evidently.\n\nAnd welcome to it. Jungle sounds abound: squawking birds and calling creatures flit by while a pan flute gently plays. When I first heard this at the age of 14, the sound effects’ use was revelatory. “You mean, you’re allowed to do that?” I thought incredulously.\n\nAfter about three minutes of this preamble, the song proper starts. At its core, it actually resembles the original Frankie composition and arrangement quite a bit. The bassline is almost untouched, guitars parts are mostly intact, and drums propel the song as before.\n\nBut Horn put way more meat on the song’s bones, appointing it with staccatoed sequencers, synths, percussion and improbable ambient touches, most notably a rhythmic harmonica. The extra layers may weigh the song down compared to the original, but they also make for a richer listen.\n\nAt the conclusion – where the single version would fade out – Horn dispenses with the original Frankie song, fully grabs the reins and takes the listener on an abrupt detour. Bass and drums drive the music forward and the jungle noises heard in the intro are reimagined by instruments as the peaceful pleasuredome mutates into snarling guitars and menacing synthetic sounds.\n\nThe journey then about-faces, returning to the song’s main musical themes but with some tasty jazz solos over top. Variations of the chorus explode back, first with exuberant female backing vocalists, then with Holly Johnson returning to take one final crack at it before everything draws to a close.\n\nAnyway, that’s the first song.\n\nRecord one – side B\n\nThe second side of record one begins with the anthemic, hook-laden Relax, which I’ve already described at length in a previous post. For its LP version, however, Horn opted to use an even slicker mix that ups the reverb and softens the percussion a touch. The result is an airier mix that’s less “pokey” on the ears. Beyond being my favourite version of the song, this LP mix helps it fit better into the context of the album as a whole.\n\nFrankie’s cover of Edwin Starr’s War follows, but in an interesting twist is presented on the album in an extended dance remix. My personal preference is for the shorter version from the Two Tribes 12” single, but the mix used here serves the overall continuity of the album nicely by bridging the dance-heavy Relax with the rollicking Two Tribes that comes next.\n\nTwo Tribes, as described before in this blog, is an energetic rock song that maintains the momentum of side B. Yet again, a new mix is offered on the LP that complements the rest of the album up to this point: it’s denser and less nimble than the 7” or 12” versions but is still very good stuff, and a fine close-out to record one.\n\nRecord two – side C\n\nIn truth, the Welcome to the Pleasuredome album could reasonably have stopped at record one and called it a day. A pretty short day, granted, but a day nonetheless. But no, Frankie pressed on with a second disc of material despite having few original songs left in their arsenal.\n\nA third of the songs on record two are cover versions, providing a good indicator for the amount of effort invested into the album’s latter half. The music is also noticeably less polished here than on the first disc, almost leaving one with the sense that they’re listening to an entirely different band.\n\nIt opens with a lacklustre (and fleeting) cover of Gerry and the Pacemakers’ Ferry ‘Cross the Mersey, an apparent attempt to tip their hats to their Liverpool home? I dunno. Things shift into higher gear when the band charges into Springsteen’s classic Born to Run – upon first listen it was my first exposure to the song, and they actually did an admirable job of it. I’ve seen Frankie play it live before and my sense is this is one of the few tracks Horn may have allowed the group to actually play their own instruments.\n\nAn inexplicable shift is made to (yet another) cover version, Do You Know the Way to San Jose. Rather than trying to make their mark on the song or do something daring, the band/Horn chose an arrangement fitting for a lounge act. The logic of this choice of song and treatment are beyond me.\n\nRecord two – side D\n\nThe remaining originals on the second record are unremarkable and harmless. Wish the Lads Were Here, Krisco Kisses, Black Night White Light and The Only Star in Heaven all benefit from the frantic quirkiness that characterize Frankie’s writing style. But while the songs had potential to be developed into something interesting, execution was pretty lazy and they unfortunately turned out flat and one-dimensional.\n\nThe final song, The Power of Love, is record two’s major outlier. While at its core a solid, relatively simple torch song, on record it was transformed into a weighty, string-drenched mega-ballad. The heavy drama causes the song to teeter close to parody, but never succumbs to it thanks to Anne Dudley’s tasteful arrangement. The song lays it on thick but knows when to yield and leave space to breathe, making for a very affecting piece of music. It would be Frankie’s third consecutive number one single in the UK.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, after all that, is the mock prog (TM) vs. bloated cash grab question settled? I think the answer lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe prog argument holds up best on record one: to begin with, the quality of the musicianship is excellent – even as a teen I had strong suspicions the band didn’t make very many of the sounds I heard on their album. More importantly, though, it’s forward-thinking and was, in many ways, groundbreaking for pop music in the 80s (read: progressive). This level of ambition was perhaps most evident on the title track, which takes the listener on a lengthy and eventful sonic journey.\n\nWhere the prog rock comparison breaks down is in the paucity of quality material on the album’s second half. Whether you love prog or hate it, something we should all be able to agree on is that its practitioners take pride in musical integrity and meaningful craft. I don’t think anyone could be fooled that either Horn or Frankie added a second disc to the Pleasuredome LP because they felt artistically compelled to cover Burt Bacharach.\n\nBut having said that, what if the double album – in and of itself – was the artistic statement? Maybe, just maybe, Horn tried to prove that a bubble-gum pop group like Frankie Goes to Hollywood could tread on “serious rock” territory if they wanted to. If true, then that would actually make Welcome to the Pleasuredome a concept album, which is very prog indeed.\n\nDid I just blow your mind? If I did and you liked it, please check out my other blog posts here.\n\nIs So Red the Rose the missing Duran Duran album?\n\nFind out how this side project bridges Duran Duran mark I and mark II.\n\nThe women illustrated on the LP covers for Rio and So Red the Rose may not be able to talk, but they say volumes about what transpired between 1982 and 1985 within Duran Duran.\n\nThe smiling Nagel girl adorning the band’s sophomore album is youthful, vivacious and radiant. The one pictured on So Red the Rose is more mature, world-weary and forlorn. I don’t know if this contrast was intentional, but the covers’ faces are metaphorical for both records – and even for the band itself.\n\nIntra-band conflict\n\nAt the end of 1984, Duran Duran finished their tour in support of their third LP, Seven and the Ragged Tiger. They’d reached an astonishing level of success and capped their gruelling year by releasing a live album and self-indulgent film (Arena and As the Lights Go Down, respectively). They also put out a new single, The Wild Boys.\n\nBy Duran Duran’s standards, the single was brutish and highlighted divisions within the group. Its awkward call and response between crushing guitars and plaintive synthesizers reeked of compromise gone bad. To me it was the sound of factions in the band fighting for dominance.\n\nTaking a hiatus: Arcadia and Power Station\n\nThe disunity was plain to hear and by early 1985 tensions boiled over, splintering the quintet in two:\n\nPower Station: Formed by Andy Taylor (guitar) and John Taylor (bass) in partnership with Chic drummer Tony Thompson and blue-eyed soul singer Robert Palmer\n\nArcadia: Formed by remaining Durans Simon Le Bon (vocals), Nick Rhodes (keyboards) and Roger Taylor (drums)\n\nAlthough each offshoot was publicly billed a side project, at the time I remember it really did seem Duran Duran was over. Both released records within months of each other, and they could not have struck more oppositional sounds or images.\n\nPower Station: Arcadia’s fraternal twin\n\nFirst out of the blocks was Power Station with their self-titled debut. Upon my first listen, I remember feeling shocked yet bored. The group’s singles were crude, and their look was miles away from the cool that Duran Duran exuded in their heyday. Andy Taylor, in particular, was unrecognizable as he fully committed to a new hair metal identity.\n\nDespite being produced by legendary groove master Bernard Edwards, the rhythm section captured on record was surprisingly muddy and imprecise. Andy Taylor revealed impressive chops but his blistering guitars often felt grafted on, causing Power Station to swing clumsily between dance music and hard rock.\n\nThe gritty record struck me as the Taylors’ reaction against the clean sound and image to which they’d each been tied. It would also foreshadow Duran Duran’s sound for the James Bond theme song, A View to a Kill, when the original line-up was reconstituted for the last time.\n\nSo Red the Rose – a reboot of Seven and the Ragged Tiger?\n\nIf Power Station pushed toward new (albeit misguided) horizons, Arcadia’s So Red the Rose took a look backward. LeBon, Rhodes and Roger Taylor continued further down the path they charted on Seven and the Ragged Tiger, even going so far as to rehire producer Alex Sadkin.\n\nUnencumbered by John and Andy Taylor, Arcadia were free to explore music that wasn’t anchored in rock. Leading off with the cheerfully eccentric single Election Day, the album had the effect of making The Wild Boys seem an aberration.\n\nI recall far preferring Arcadia’s refined sound over Power Station’s bombast and dutifully purchased a copy of So Red the Rose quickly after its release.\n\nSupporting personnel\n\nWithout a bassist or guitarist, Arcadia needed to fill out their lineup. In addition to adding some choice session players, the group exercised their newfound industry clout to stuff their record with notable notables:\n\nCarlos Alomar – the long-time David Bowie rhythm guitarist brought his unique, bubbly brand of funk, and is readily identifiable on the album’s first half\n\nDavid Gilmour and Herbie Hancock – the legendary guitarist and keyboard player each appeared on one track with contributions so sparse it’s fair to believe they were invited to play on the record for vanity reasons only\n\nSting – Appears as a prominent backing vocalist (He was another artist trying to escape the shadow of his band and made himself ubiquitous in 1985)\n\nAndy Mackay – The sax player was perhaps brought aboard in hopes that some of his Roxy Music magic would rub off\n\nAnd this list doesn’t include the bassist (Mark Egan, who did lots of great fretless work), string players, percussionists and drummers.\n\n“Wait,” I hear you say. “Didn’t Arcadia already have Roger Taylor on drums?” Well, kinda. Although an official band member, it appears Taylor wasn’t particularly committed to the project and checked out early from the sessions. After laying down a few tracks and doing the album photo shoot, he called it quits. Taylor also wasn’t compelled to appear in any Arcadia promo videos.\n\nAnalysis of So Red the Rose\n\nThe word “pretentious” didn’t really exist in my vocabulary back in 1985 but I knew what it was, and So Red the Rose fit the bill. From the ornate cover art by Assorted Images to the way the band depicted itself – clad in black like three Draculas – they plainly wanted to infuse their music with a dark romantic mystique. Heck, even the album’s title sounds like it’s spoken in broken English by a bad poet.\n\nA clear inspiration was surely Roxy Music’s Avalon, an elegant record from 1982 that enveloped listeners in luxury. In a few instances So Red the Rose would approach Avalon’s aesthetic, but fall short. (To be fair, it’s a pretty high bar.)\n\nThe band also seemed to deliberately mash-up western pop with kabuki music. I’m not kidding. Tracks often employ spacious percussion and ambient backdrops, lending them an exotic quality. The ink paintings and folding fan design motifs in the album art enhance this effect.\n\nHaving said that, I do remember finding So Red the Rose an enjoyable listen. Its overall sound was refreshingly familiar and true to form for the estranged Duran alums. It was pleasing to hear them refine the vision they laid out in their previous album and ambitiously push forward.\n\nTwo sides, two moods\n\nIt’s subtle, but the record is divided between two moods:\n\nSide 1: Dominated by slick, radio-friendly tracks (especially in the early going)\n\nSide 2: More serious and permeated by an unmistakeable dark undercurrent\n\nSingles Election Day, Keep Me in the Dark and Goodbye is Forever kick off the record on upbeat territory; it’s not until the harrowing The Flame that the record’s dark persona begins to emerge. Closing the side is the dreamy Missing, whose atmospherics captivated me as a youngster.\n\nI mean let’s face it, most of Arcadia’s teen audience had minimal – if any – exposure to ambient music; the often-haunting soundscapes they introduced me to were pretty revelatory.\n\nThe second half of the album is more bleak. All the songs on side 2 find Le Bon singing in various states of despair and abandoning his usual sunny disposition. It begins with the brief dirge, Rose Arcana, which seamlessly launches into The Promise.\n\nClocking in at 7:29, The Promise is the album’s centrepiece. At first blush the song seems so purposeful but upon repeated listens it feels… meaningless. Arcadia spent a lot of its celebrity capital on this track (it’s the only one in which Gilmour, Hancock and Sting appear) but its cryptic lyrics and self-important air cause the song to collapse under its own weight. Still, I give Arcadia credit for their ambition and earnestness.\n\nClosing out the record are El Diablo and Lady Ice. The former is a spirited Latin/gypsy pop song featuring flutes that echo The Chauffeur from Duran Duran’s Rio. A hooky chorus make the song one of the record’s more memorable tracks.\n\nLady Ice is Arcadia’s most bitter song and like Missing on side 1, is effective because of the moving way it explores ambience and subtlety.\n\nSide notes\n\nWhile typing this I recall that I once also owned the Election Day 12” single. I don’t really regret trading/selling it – it was just another standard-issue extended remix from the 80s, to the best of my recollection.\n\nMore memorable – and still present in my life – is the sheet music I purchased for So Red the Rose. I’m proficient enough at piano and guitar that I don’t have much use for sheet music anymore, but there’s simply no valid reason whatsoever for me to get rid of that book.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe fact that I bought Arcadia’s album, 12” single and sheet music, but nothing from Power Station should say everything about where my loyalties were as a kid. Make no mistake about it, So Red the Rose is better than Power Station, offering a far more satisfying and cerebral musical voyage (if that’s your kind of thing).\n\nIn my opinion So Red the Rose deserves a seat in the Duran Duran catalog. The record helps tell the story of the band by providing post-Seven and the Ragged Tiger continuity:\n\nIt marks a successful progression on that record’s sound\n\nIt closes out the journey the band took with producer Alex Sadkin\n\nIts moodiness captures the inner turmoil facing the band at the time\n\nIt creates a bridge to the group’s next full-length album, Notorious\n\nFinally, I should make amends. At times in this blog I’ve disparaged Nick Rhodes as the least talented Duran who I’ve accused of suppressing their rock roots. So Red the Rose proves he was one of the band’s principal visionaries. Sorry about that, Nick.\n\nReview of the Two Tribes single and 12″ extended mix\n\nMy take on Frankie’s controversial anti-war song.\n\nThis post is written within weeks of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot on the U.S. Capitol, and like most sensible people, the aftermath has me shook. The extreme polarization of society – especially American society, which I’m happy to observe from a distance – is remarkable. It’s astonishing how two halves of a population can be so far apart on absolutely everything.\n\nIf only I had a record review to do now that fits the circumstances we find ourselves in today…\n\nFrankie Say War: Two Tribes\n\nReleased in June 1984, Two Tribes was the second single released by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although less famous worldwide than their debut, Relax, it was an instant smash in England, entering the charts at No. 1.\n\nThe song captures the widespread fear of nuclear annihilation that gripped the west in the early 1980s. Although primarily a commentary on war, Two Tribes also touches on other themes:\n\nUs versus Them\n\nPropaganda\n\nMistrust between two solitudes\n\nAny of that feel familiar lately?\n\nExplosive first encounter\n\nI admit it – few of the real-world worries expressed in Two Tribes were mine back in the day. The song appealed to me not because of its message, but because it made for a captivating listen. Plus, it dovetailed with my fondness for Relax, which I’ve already documented in detail.\n\nI first became aware of Two Tribes in the summer of 1984 when I viewed its Godley and Creme-directed video. It memorably depicts former US and Soviet leaders Ronald Regan and Konstantin Chernenko engaged in hand-to-hand combat inside a wrestling pit. A surrounding crowd cheers the brawling leaders and by the end everyone is at each other’s throats until the Earth literally explodes.\n\nOverall sound and feel\n\nWhile Two Tribes shares the urgency of its dance-oriented predecessor, it’s otherwise a departure from Relax. The track closely resembles a straight-up rock song, even though most of its music was generated by a Fairlight synthesizer and LinnDrum machine.\n\nThe tense energy of Two Tribes is mainly derived from its jittery bass and delay-drenched guitars. A speedy high-hat and four-on-the-floor kick drum propel the song, with snare and cymbals innovatively reserved for punctuating stabs.\n\nIt begins with a grim false intro over an air attack siren before launching into the driving chorus, which forms the core of the song. There aren’t any discernible verses; instead, musical themes drift in and out between choruses like a stream of consciousness.\n\nFrankie’s scattershot songwriting on Two Tribes was tamed and brought into focus by producer Trevor Horn, who helped the band paint vivid sonic images:\n\nThe bassline brings to mind the kind of soundtrack that accompanies TV breaking news\n\nThe guitar gallops like a charging cavalry regiment\n\nMusical stabs and orchestral hits suggest physical aggression\n\nThe marching bridge evokes the pomp of a military parade\n\nFiery guitars in the song’s climax roar like diving fighter jets before the closing chords flash like bursting bombs\n\nNot bad for a pop tune!\n\nThe Two Tribes 7” single\n\nI can’t remember when I bought the record but it was likely early 1985, after I’d exhausted my exploration of Relax and wanted more to chew on. I cautiously purchased the 7” single (ZTT ISL-97004).\n\nThe record’s label appealed to me immediately – it cheekily positioned the spindle hole through the foreheads of Vladimir Lenin and Ronald Regan (on the A- and B-sides, respectively). Speaking of sides, here is what’s on my copy of the record:\n\nSide A: Two Tribes\n\nSide B: One February Friday\n\nAs with Relax, numerous single mixes exist for Two Tribes, and from what I can tell the “canon” version is the one used in the video. Toe-tapping percussion permeates the song and its rocky edges are softened by synth pads and a more mechanical bass sound.\n\nThe mix used on my copy of the 7” single, however, is far drier by comparison, focusing on guitar, bass and drums. Keyboards are dialled back while hand claps, bongos and cowbells are completely stripped away. I’d wager this mix is unique to North American pressings.\n\nNormally when I take a Pepsi challenge between North American and UK mixes of a song, I side with the UK version. Two Tribes is an exception – I much prefer the comparatively raw North American mix. I’m grateful to have this record in my collection because, YouTube aside, the mix it contains isn’t available for streaming.\n\nListen to the video clip below and take the “Two Tribes Pepsi challenge” for yourself:\n\nThe B-side of the single is One February Friday, an interview with bassist Mark O’Toole, drummer Peter Gill and guitarist Brian Nash. Oddly, none of these three Frankies contributed to Two Tribes’ recording – only lead singer Holly Johnson and co-vocalist Paul Rutherford are audible.\n\nThe actual performers on Two Tribes were expert session players Stephen Lipson (guitar), Andrew Richards (keyboards) and J. Jeczalik (programming). Here’s a delightful video I uncovered featuring Lipson and Horn playing an intimate live version of Two Tribes – talk about yer professors of the School of Rock:\n\nThe Two Tribes 12” single\n\nIt was inevitable I’d get the 12” single. As was customary at the time, I’d heard the extended mix on CFNY 102.1 FM and managed to get most of it on tape, but was jonesing for the whole song. Here’s the single’s running order (ZTT IS 1002):\n\nSide A: Two Tribes (extended “annihilation” mix)\n\nSide B: War; Two Tribes (instrumental “carnage” mix); and One February Friday\n\nTwo Tribes’ annihilation mix is more than just an extended 12” dance reworking; made with care and consideration by Horn, it’s infused with personality, irreverence and even a sense of humour. In other words, it’s meant to be listened to.\n\nTaking the UK single as a starting point, Horn pushes rhythm instruments to the foreground, and from there goes very dark, both in terms of sonic palette and message. Guitars are removed almost totally, firmly positioning bass as the lead instrument. Coupled with ominous, repeating low-register piano notes, the song takes on a monochrome quality. It’s an alternate aesthetic and I totally love it.\n\nDialogue is woven throughout the instrumental sections, adding more layers of interest:\n\nA Ronald Regan voice impersonator introduces the band and later quotes passages from a speech delivered by Hitler at the 1924 Beer Hall Putsch trial\n\nA dispassionate narrator sampled from a 1975 PSA film is dubbed over top the breakdown, starkly explaining nuclear fallout avoidance and informing about tagging deceased relatives, “for identification purposes”\n\nThe voice-overs are alternately funny and chilling, and in both cases strike a contrast against the backdrop of pumping electronic beats.\n\nThe band’s cover of Edwin Starr’s War on the B-side is a fine accompaniment to Two Tribes. The thematic relationship between the two songs couldn’t be clearer and they even share similar bass-dominant arrangements. Holly Johnson’s vocal is great and – improbably – the band truly succeeds in making Starr’s Motown classic their own.\n\nSleeve design\n\nCompleting the package is the sleeve imagery, likely conceived by ZTT co-founder and chief PR man, Paul Morley. The front cover exhibits a mural of Lenin, and the back contains a large shot of Regan, hand over heart.\n\nAmong the verbiage on the back are scary charts and stats about the combined nuclear firepower amassed by the rival superpowers, and a list of countries that would be targeted in the event of war. The aforementioned labels with provocative spindle hole placement is just… *chef’s kiss*.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAlright, I’m realizing now this is probably my longest blog post to date, and I’ve basically described just one song – obviously I’ve got considerable affection for Two Tribes. Having said that, it wasn’t until starting this post that I listened to the record again for the first time in years and years.\n\nThe song holds up remarkably well: Thematically, despite being about a bygone cold war it (sadly) manages to feel relevant nearly 40 years on. Particularly pertinent is the fact that it uses the term “tribes” to describe opposing factions.\n\nMusically, its sound and construction are so unusual that it can’t be pigeonholed as just another 80s pop song. And the impeccable quality of the annihilation mix only strengthens the case that Trevor Horn-helmed Frankie Goes to Hollywood singles hold a very special place in the panoply of extended 12” remixes from the 80s.\n\nIs Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas a modern Christmas carol?\n\n… or is it just the starting point of Bob Geldof’s legacy?\n\nA Christmas miracle! As I settle down at 11 p.m. on December 25, 2020 to start this post, it coincidentally happens that the next sequential record in my collection to write about is Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas.\n\nIt’s one of those records that occupies the grey zone separating bona-fide Christmas songs from non-Christmas songs (the same territory Die Hard inhabits in the realm of film). While some would argue the song is inherently tied to the season (see its title), others might say it’s overly preachy or has too much historical baggage to outlive the era of its release. Who’s right?\n\nA brief back story on Do They Know It’s Christmas\n\nBefore founding Band Aid and becoming synonymous with star-studded famine relief events, Bob Geldof was the singer for British new wave band The Boomtown Rats. In late 1984 he was jolted into activism after viewing a distressing BBC documentary about a long-standing famine that had ravaged Ethiopia for more than a year.\n\nDo They Know It’s Christmas was Geldof’s response to the crisis. Perhaps drawing inspiration from George Harrison’s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh, he was determined to put out a charity record in time for the holidays to raise money that could help alleviate the Ethiopians’ suffering.\n\nGetting Band Aid together\n\nIn early November 1984, Geldof met Ultravox’s Midge Ure; together they wrote Do They Know It’s Christmas and formed the nucleus of a short-lived supergroup, Band Aid.\n\nGeldof then acted quickly to persuade some of the top musical acts in Britain to join the band and raise the profile of the yet-to-be-recorded single. Pop stars like Sting, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet were quick to buy into his vision, and this early momentum encouraged other 80s notables to sign up, including:\n\nBono and Adam Clayton of U2\n\nBoy George and Jon Moss of Culture Club\n\nGeorge Michael of Wham!\n\nPaul Weller of Style Council\n\nPaul Young\n\nPhil Collins\n\nTo this day I consider it a minor miracle Geldof convinced so many A-listers to drop their egos and wipe their schedules for the Nov. 25 recording session on such short notice.\n\nFar-reaching impact\n\nI have no idea how confident Geldof was when he embarked on the Band Aid project, but I think it’s safe to say he probably far surpassed all his initial expectations:\n\nOver 40 prominent musicians joined in on the effort\n\nSales for the Do They Know It’s Christmas single raised £8 million within a year\n\nIn early 1985 the song inspired production of other famine relief charity singles in both the USA and Canada (We Are the World and Tears are not Enough, respectively)\n\nIn July 1985, the far more ambitious global Live Aid concert was successfully organized, which raised an additional $127 million and solidified Geldof’s status as an activist to be reckoned with\n\nPersonal recollections upon the song’s release\n\nI remember Do They Know It’s Christmas being on very heavy rotation that season, both on radio and television. The video was interesting because it captured the jarringly non-glamorous musicians at work in the studio as they recorded the track.\n\nGeldof’s bet that star power would attract attention and dollars from kids like me worked: I was glad to part with some paper-route money to support Band Aid’s mission in Africa in exchange for a shiny new record. However had the cause not been so important, I doubt I would’ve made the purchase – truth is, I don’t like the song very much.\n\nIs Do They Know It’s Christmas actually any good?\n\nAlthough the “feed the world” coda at the song’s end is admittedly catchy, I otherwise consider Do They Know It’s Christmas under-cooked as a piece of music. Had Geldof and Ure been afforded more time for refinement, they very well could have developed it into a truly epic song for the ages. Performances and production also feel slapdash, but I recognize it was a rush job and have always been more than happy to cut Band Aid plenty of slack.\n\nI was also very forgiving of the fact that the song is a downer. Its sombre lyrics and dirge-like mood stand in stark contrast to most Christmas music. But Do They Know It’s Christmas was never meant to fill listeners with festive cheer, anyway – its reason for being was to make people reflect on their lives and push them to think about others who are less fortunate.\n\nOne line in the song that always stayed with me was, “tonight thank God it’s them, instead of you,” sung earnestly by Bono. When the record first came out it struck me as harsh. In recent years, I’ve heard people complain the lyric smacks of privilege. But over the years I’ve come to appreciate those words – my reading of it today goes along the lines of, “there but for the grace of God go I,” which I consider a humble and appropriate statement.\n\nThe symbolic sleeve\n\nThe record came packaged in a sleeve designed by Peter Blake, who is best renowned for his work on the cover of The Beatles’ Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. As with Sergeant Pepper, Blake created a collage, this time using cut-outs of Victorian-era boys and girls enjoying an abundance of playthings, strongly contrasted against two famine-stricken children isolated in the foreground.\n\nAlso reminiscent of Sergeant Pepper, the reverse side of the sleeve contains a photo of the participants in the Band Aid project, alongside a chart of “who’s who.” As a major Duranie at the time (i.e. a Duran Duran fan) I remember proudly noting that all five members of the group were represented.\n\nThe 12” single\n\nAs something of a 12” single collector at the time, I chose to purchase the record in that particular format (Columbia 12CXP-05157, which is the Canadian pressing), with this running order:\n\nSide A: Do They Know It’s Christmas (remix)\n\nSide B: Do They Know It’s Christmas (standard mix) and Feed the World\n\nThe extended mix by Trevor Horn is hardly of much musical interest – it’s basically just the single version of the song, with an isolated drum track tacked on the end, over which Christmas greetings are delivered by Band Aid’s participants. Feed the World is just an instrumental of the standard Do They Know It’s Christmas, with said greetings over top.\n\nSpecial appearances in the greetings were made by Paul McCartney (who didn’t seem to grasp the gravity of the project), David Bowie and Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who was apparently only available by phone.\n\nThe remixes are all filler, but at the time I enjoyed hearing my musical heroes wish me well for the holidays. Some even took the opportunity to have their say about the famine, and of course leave it to Bowie to provide the most sobering message of them all. He’s like the “dad” of the remixes – all backing tracks die down so the listener can hear his words.\n\nWhy is this still in my collection?\n\nIn some ways, I’m kind of surprised Do They Know It’s Christmas has managed to endure in my collection for so many years. As mentioned earlier, I never considered the song particularly good to begin with, and I don’t ever listen to it, even during the holidays. It could be argued the record outlived its usefulness as soon as I’d paid for it and the money was directed toward famine relief.\n\nBut it stays in my collection, and yes I do consider it a Christmas song that transcends its era. It touches on the importance of gratitude and giving, which is generally absent from Christmas music but is something we should be mindful of for every holiday season, not just for the one that happened in 1984.\n\nThe record is also cool because of its timing: it captures a moment and sums up the famine, the artists in the recording, and even Live Aid. It’s one of the few records I own where the quality of the music doesn’t matter much, and its significance is measured mainly by the remarkable circumstances under which it was created.\n\nFrankie say review: the Relax 12” single\n\nFind out why Relax is more than a pop culture footnote.\n\nIn 1984 I was a dedicated Duranie, but late that year the band put out a couple bum releases that cooled me off. Neither the Arena live album or The Wild Boys 12” single remain in my collection today, and I don’t feel poorer for it.\n\nIn this Duran Duran trough period I sought greener pastures and found myself drawn to a song that became an obsession: Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\n\nFirmly a product of the 80s, the song is often dismissed as just a campy (albeit catchy) one-hit wonder with a racy video and accompanying t-shirt. A closer analysis and a dive into its history, however, reveal that there’s so much more.\n\nSong structure? What’s that?\n\nBearing more in common with a chant than a pop song, Relax relentlessly delivers its blunt lyrics over a pair of alternating chords. With the exception of an eight-bar bridge, it’s all verse and no chorus (or is it all chorus and no verse? I’m not sure).\n\nAnyway, in theory this should make the song oppressively boring, but visionary production by Trevor Horn kept that from happening. The degree of polish and sophistication he applied to Relax set it apart from other synth-driven music of its time. Even more remarkable was how Horn took a simple two-note hook and exploded it into a next-level pop song.\n\nModest origins\n\nIn 1982 Frankie performed an early, stripped-down version of Relax on BBC’s The Tube whilst donned, appropriately, in leather S&M gear. This minimalist arrangement caught the attention of Horn and his partner, Paul Morley. As producer and publicist of upstart label ZTT, the two saw potential in the unvarnished group and their “jingle,” as Horn described it, and inked a deal with the band.\n\nEver the control freak, Horn never seriously intended to let the lads in Frankie have much of a hand in recording. Instead he enlisted Ian Dury’s Blockheads to put backing tracks down, and two versions of Relax were completed, but neither were released:\n\nRelax version 1: a very 80s funk song that sticks to a guitar/bass/drum arrangement. This quickly becomes a bore – a couple of mid-song modulations help break the monotony, but make no mistake: had this been released it would’ve fast fallen into obscurity.\n\nRelax version 2: Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. Semi-industrial eighth notes generated by the then-cutting edge Fairlight CMI synth bring urgency to the music. Guitar, bass and drums still supply most of the rhythm, but regrettably dated samples (also from the Fairlight) take a large share of the sonic landscape. Although bolder than its predecessor, this one also gets tedious after a minute or two.\n\nThird time’s a charm\n\nNeither recording was to Horn’s satisfaction, so he started over from scratch. Musicians Andrew Richards (keyboards), J.J. Jeczalik (programming) and Stephen Lipson (guitar) were recruited to help take a blowtorch to the previous arrangements, and from the ashes a third version arose.\n\nTaking strong cues from the hi-NRG movement, Relax was re-imagined:\n\nThe song became an exercise in variation – new arrangements are presented with each repetition of the “chant.”\n\nSynths were brought to the fore with sparkling, squishy new sounds and effects.\n\nPercussion and hand claps from a Linn Drum machine supplemented the rhythm.\n\nA ludicrously simple single-note bassline formed the foundation of the song, and would become its signature.\n\nAbout that bassline – I’ve seen some musicians poke fun at the seemingly uninspired quarter-note drubbing on low E. The part gets chided for being rudimentary, but simplicity is the whole point: it was designed to make you move from the hip, not think.\n\nLast but certainly not least, lead vocalist Holly Johnson’s role in the success of the final version of Relax can’t be overstated. Stepping up his performance several notches, he plays the dual role of lead singer and hype man, letting loose with ad-libs throughout and supplying visceral feel to an otherwise synthetic pop tune.\n\nThe New York mix\n\nRelax earned a special place in my heart after I heard it one Saturday night on CFNY, a Toronto radio station. Midway through, the DJ grafted the 12” remix (aka New York mix) to the song, effectively creating a breakdown that reduced Relax to its component parts before the vocal’s return at the end.\n\nI happened to capture this on cassette, and listened to it over and over in the subsequent days/weeks. It was fascinating to hear Relax dissected in the New York mix, piece by piece. I got addicted.\n\nSounds that were barely audible on the single were showcased clearly in the extended remix, and I could hear how much craft went into putting every instrument in just the right place to serve the song. It made me appreciate how many subtle details contributed to the whole, and trained me to be a better listener. In an era where extended mixes were often lazily executed, the thoughtful New York mix was a breath of fresh air.\n\nTaking the plunge – buying the record\n\nI got the Relax 12” single a short time later (Island IS-69750) – it was inevitable. Finally, I had proper versions of both the single version and the fantastic New York mix in their entirety. Here’s the running order:\n\nSide A: Relax (New York mix)\n\nSide B: Relax (single version) and Relax (instrumental)\n\nIn addition to an extended running time, the New York mix differs from the mix on the single version by scooping out the midrange, pushing up the vocals and pulsating more. It also cuts out a relatively subdued part of the song, presumably to maintain momentum for people on the dance floor.\n\nSpeaking of dance floors, this record was clearly engineered for nightclubs. It’s enormously loud with a thumping low end that threatens to make the needle jump out of the record’s grooves with each beat (this actually happened to me once, way before I learned what “sound isolation” means).\n\nCover art – gosh\n\nThe 12″ single’s artwork was more provocative than anything else in my collection at the time. I remember getting a raised eyebrow from my mom one day when she saw the “two bodies” cover illustration; thankfully she never examined the sexually charged screed written on the reverse side.\n\nLooking at the rag-tag band photo, I wonder if Paul Morley was inspired by the way the Rolling Stones’ bad-boy image had been cast against that of the clean-cut Beatles in the early 60s. My sense is his original marketing plan for Frankie was to position them as the street-smart anti-Duran Duran (or anti-Culture Club, etc. – take your pick).\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI don’t mean to take too much away from Frankie Goes to Hollywood – particularly Holly Johnson – but Relax is primarily a testament to the skill of Trevor Horn. His forward-thinking work was tasteful enough to ensure Relax hasn’t become a cringe-inducing victim of the technology of the time. With scant source material to work with, he managed to create an enduring anthem that’s aged most admirably.\n\nDid David Bowie sell out with Let’s Dance?\n\nPut on your red shoes and find out.\n\nWhen I was in the grip of 80s teenage pop music – you know, Duran Duran, Michael Jackson, et al. – David Bowie’s sudden emergence on AM radio in 1983 with Let’s Dance came unexpected. To be honest, at the time he struck me like a dinosaur act gasping for attention (he was 36).\n\nBowie was of course already well-established, but for most his reputation for flamboyance outshined his talent, limiting his ambition to that of high-achieving cult artist. Part of what may have held him back were his flirtations with controversy and – shock – sexual ambiguity. I clearly remember my aunt reading aloud about him from an old edition of the Guiness Book of World Records in an entry on “homosexual entertainers.”\n\nHopping the Bowie bandwagon\n\nAnyway, to me Bowie didn’t have a whole lot of significance in 1983. He was the scary art clown in Ashes to Ashes; he was the guy who I thought needed help from Queen two years prior to have a hit with Under Pressure. Maybe that’s why his reappearance on top 40 radio reeked of desperation to me at first.\n\nThe err of my ways\n\nBut in short order I discovered I was very wrong about Bowie. The eponymous first single from Let’s Dance was outstanding. The video’s locale was reminiscent of Duran Duran’s exotic escapades, and was very much of its time.\n\nBy the time China Girl came out as the second single, I was fully on the Bowie bandwagon. When I first heard Modern Love on the radio six months later I lost my mind – I couldn’t get over the plethora of hits.\n\nA new deal with EMI\n\nLittle did I know then that a debate was brewing about whether Bowie had sold his soul with Let’s Dance. He departed his long-standing relationship with RCA in 1983 and signed a lucrative deal with EMI worth $17.5 million. Let’s Dance was to be the first of what were to be many golden eggs for his new label.\n\nAnd in many ways Bowie delivered on that promise:\n\nHe traded in his makeup for a non-threatening baggy suit and blonde pompadour\n\nHe aligned his overall image with the new wave bands of the day (which were directly influenced by his body of work in the 70s)\n\nAbove all, to produce the record he chose Chic alum Nile Rodgers, who’d never dabbled in the avant garde but had impeccable dance and hit-making credentials\n\nBut was it a sell-out?\n\nMuch on the record signaled Bowie’s new commercial direction: Rodgers’ monster funk guitar riffs, punchy horn sections and slammin’ beats courtesy of the mighty Omar Hakim and Tony Thompson.\n\nBut even the most radio-friendly of the album’s hits leaned to the left of everything else on top 40 radio. Throughout the record, Bowie’s vocal deliveries were inimitably cool and detached – trademark stuff. The greasy guitar leads from guest sideman Stevie Ray Vaughan was an inspired choice, lending Texas blues grit to even the poppiest of tunes.\n\nAnd can we talk about China Girl? The song was a smash, despite having a structure that defies so many top 40 conventions. If you haven’t heard it in a while, I urge you to check it out again and rediscover the song; it’s a mini-suite that journeys through distinct moods – a true rarity in pop music.\n\nWhat about the deep cuts?\n\nTrue to its billing as a release intended for the mainstream, the Let’s Dance album is very front-end loaded: The first three songs on side 1 constitute the entirety of the record’s singles. The fourth track, Without You, is a throwaway sop to his new target audience.\n\nOn side 2 Bowie stays truer to his outsider aesthetic. Certain of its songs could easily have sat alongside tracks from other classic albums like 1979’s Lodger (Riccochet) or 1980’s Scary Monsters (Criminal World and Cat People). As with side one, the fourth song – Shake It – is fluff.\n\nTurn to face the strange\n\nWhen I got my copy of the LP as a youngster (I somehow scored a radio promo copy, EMI catalog SO 17093), I remember finding it a challenging listen. As mentioned, side 1 was where all the pop action was, but side 2 was hard to fully wrap my head around.\n\nBut that was then and this is now. A more mature listen to the record, coupled with a richer understanding of its context in Bowie’s catalogue, is a far more rewarding experience.\n\nLet’s Dance strikes a bargain\n\nIs it possible that Let’s Dance was less of a cash grab and more of a challenge by Bowie to prove he could create a mainstream smash without sacrificing his vision? If so, I say he succeeded. Side 1 holds up as an outstanding pop record that retains vintage Bowie essence, while side 2 satisfies his (and his fans’) urge to continually explore and push boundaries.\n\nNormally when a musician attempts to be palatable to the mainstream, artistic compromises are made, yielding mediocre results. Fortunately here, Bowie succeeded in winning over an entirely new audience without sacrificing his aesthetic, his quality or his edge.\n\nWhen six sides are better than two\n\n10″ vinyl is the coolest. Let’s just get that out of the way.\n\nThis post is about how songs can be partitioned out on an album to make for an optimal listening experience. Today’s exhibit: a recently purchased copy of Era Vulgaris by Queens of the Stone Age that I’m pretty enthusiastic about.\n\nAlthough it’s often cited as one of QOTSA’s lesser efforts, to me Era Vulgaris is worthy of much praise. The 2007 album marked a departure from their previous four releases, and it’s clear Josh Homme & co. challenged themselves to colour outside the lines, embrace discord and get a little meaner.\n\nThe experiment was a success\n\nThe first time I discovered the album I distinctly recall thinking “OK, I’m in” around 15 seconds into the opener, Turnin’ On The Screw. Pairing a hypnotic drum beat with a monster guitar groove reminiscent of Led Zeppelin’s Dancing Days on steroids, it’s truly unique and very addictive.\n\nThe chaotic momentum continues with Sick Sick Sick and I’m Designer before subsiding with Into the Hollow. The band kicks up dust again with Misfit Love and Battery Acid and offers one more reprieve at the midway point of the album with the sultry Make it Wit Chu. The remaining tracks each build in intensity before climaxing with the Love and Rockets flavoured Run Pig Run, which is fantastically out-of-control and ends the record with a twisted fanfare.\n\nChallenging and definitely worth buying\n\nProduced by Homme with Chris Goss, Era Vulgaris is a dense record, to be sure. By times textured to the point of abrasive, if a listener isn’t careful they could get overwhelmed by the noise, and it’s for this reason I didn’t immediately dash out to buy a copy on vinyl.\n\nBut the cover art helped draw me, I have to admit it. Featuring subversive retro-style illustrations by Morning Breath, it perfectly accompanies the music. When I found out the album was reissued in late 2019 as a triple 10” LP by Ipecac Recordings, I was sold.\n\nAn unexpected choice: 1 x 12″ or 3 x 10″?\n\nThe pandemic hit about that time, and I was forced to make my purchase online. Unfortunately, the merchant I bought it from – the excellent Sonic Boom on Spadina St. in Toronto – mistakenly shipped me a “standard” 12” version at first. I told them about the error and in a demonstration of outstanding customer service they sent the correct 10” version, leaving me (albeit temporarily) with two different formats of the same album to contemplate.\n\nClearly, my preference was strongly for the triple 10” version. Not everyone likes ‘em, but I think they’re cool because they split the difference between a 12” LP and a 7” single. Plus, they’re kinda tiny and cute. They’re also somewhat of a novelty – I personally have only three others in my collection.\n\nWhy Era Vulgaris works best on six sides\n\nBut this post isn’t about the merits of 10” vs. 12”; it’s about what makes for a better listening experience: Era Vulgaris when split into halves, or into thirds (or sixths, to be more accurate). I fall squarely into the “split into sixths” camp.\n\nOf course, not every album works better when subdivided into an ever-greater number of sides, but the turmoil of Era Vulgaris gets tempered a lot when dosed in 10-minute bursts and is better for it. Here’s the running order:\n\nSide A: Turnin’ On The Screw and Sick, Sick, Sick\n\nSide B: I’m Designer and Into the Hollow\n\nSide C: Misfit Love and Running Joke\n\nSide D: Battery Acid and Make it Wit Chu\n\nSide E: 3’s & 7’s and Suture Up Your Future\n\nSide F: River in the Road and Run, Pig, Run\n\nFor those paying attention, there’s a bonus track added to the vinyl edition of the album – Running Joke is a slow, mournful song unlike anything else on the record. Homme’s vocal delivery is practically comatose; his performance seals in the oppressive atmosphere and makes for a crushing end to the third side.\n\nBonus tracks aside, the six-sided format absolutely works and helps draw out the character of each song. It’s far easier to appreciate Into the Hollow when you’re not busy recovering from the whiplash of the 1-2-3 punch of Turnin’ On The Screw, Sick Sick Sick and I’m Designer.\n\nSimilarly, the personalities of the harrowing Misfit Love and Battery Acid are more apparent when they’re not stacked up back-to-back against each other. On side E, the powerful 3’s and 7’s is complemented by the more reflective Suture Up Your Future. Side F closes everything out in fitting fashion with River in the Road – a song that would be a shoegaze soundscape if it not for its relentless marching-drum beats – and the aforementioned Run, Pig, Run.\n\nLike I mentioned in a previous post about why I like 12” singles, I’m a big fan of records that give focus where it’s needed when you put the needle down. I’m also a big fan of records that make “sense.” Era Vulgaris on triple 10” discs does both.\n\nPlus it’s got Bulby on the cover – what’s not to love?\n\nIs Michael Jackson’s Thriller overrated?\n\nHere’s my hot take on this classic album.\n\nIt’s pretty hard to write about early ‘80s records without acknowledging that 1983 and 1984 belonged to Michael Jackson. He was everywhere.\n\nDespite not even owning a copy of Thriller then, I knew almost every song from the record back to front. It wasn’t until many years after the album passed out of the charts that I bought my first copy on compact disc. A few years on and I picked up some used vinyl versions, as one does.\n\nThriller revisited\n\nWhen I re-listened to Thriller as an adult – well after the hype had settled – I recall being struck by two things:\n\nAll the background noise about M.J.’s complicated private life melts away when you put the needle down.\n\nMost of Thriller is nowhere near as great as I’d remembered.\n\nNow don’t beat up on me, I get why Thriller is the best-selling record of all time. It’s the quintessential cross-over album with something for everyone, and it built bridges between black and white audiences. With producer Quincy Jones, Jackson embraced electronics, funk, soul and rock, and synthesized them into an impressively coherent whole. It boasts some of the most enduring songs of the 20th century.\n\nMy compelling theory about Thriller\n\nBut when I take a look beyond the iconic tracks, dare I say it’s tempting to say the album should’ve been titled “Filler.”\n\nToo harsh? Yeah probably, but it’s telling that its best songs are the ones Jackson penned himself. I can’t shake the feeling he had a handful of obvious hits on his hands, wanted to put them into the world, but needed to enlist the support of professional songwriters like Rod Temperton to round out a full record.\n\nRevisionist Thriller\n\nCould you imagine a version of the album with only the Jackson compositions? Granted, it would be damn short, but it would’ve been the bona fide “killer” M.J. intended all along:\n\nWanna Be Startin’ Somethin’: Despite being jittery and synthetic, the album’s kick-off feels warm, celebratory and is firmly rooted in Afrobeat (a tip of the hat is given to Manu Dibango’s Soul Makossa with the “mama se, mama sa, mama coo sa” refrain). An undisputed classic.\n\nThe Girl is Mine: A harmless duet with Paul McCartney that captures a moment of genuine friendship before they fell out. Funny – had the former Beatle released this under his own name, he woulda been lambasted for it. Seriously, how often does Paul get dragged for schmaltz like this, but if said schmaltz is on Thriller, all is forgiven. #disgruntledMcCartneyfan\n\nBeat It: Jackson ventures confidently into rock territory and owns it. Twin guitar riffs interlock to support the song’s tight, danceable arrangement. Dropping in a solo by Eddie Van Halen may seem hare-brained on paper, but it was Quincy Jones’ masterstroke: not only does it actually work, it also carved out a new audience for Jackson.\n\nBillie Jean: Go to a New Year’s Eve party in the year 2099 and they’ll still play this song close to midnight, and partygoers will still go nuts over it. Billie Jean encapsulates everything that’s great about Thriller: simple hooks, a deep groove, loads of polish, a dash of paranoia, all capped off with an outstanding vocal.\n\nThe filler\n\nJackson’s four tunes are the ones he performed with the most conviction and invested with the most personality, by far. I can buy that he “felt” others like PYT (Pretty Young Thing) and even the title track, but they are lesser compositions compared to M.J.’s own creations. (Let’s be honest, Temperton’s Thriller only enjoys status as a “classic” because of its epic zombie video.)\n\nMost of the remaining tracks fit comfortably into the easy listening category. It doesn’t mean they’re bad; it just means they aren’t particularly remarkable or challenging. Jones’ production on these is slick to a fault, more or less rendering them as funky lounge music of very high quality.\n\nWith the exception of the guest appearances noted above, Jackson rarely shares the spotlight and is firmly the star of Thriller. Unfortunately, the decision to put him so far out front and centre comes at the expense of the album’s backing tracks. When Jackson doesn’t step up to make the songs sparkle, Thriller falls short on character.\n\nCan we talk about a couple more things?\n\nI’ve got two other quibbles about this record:\n\nSerious sequencing error: Each side has good flow, but whose idea was it to have the album limp across the finish line with The Lady in My Life? My pro-tip: When playing this album, start with side two – it kicks off with the one-two punch of Beat It and Billie Jean, and when you conclude the record on the flipside it ends with Vincent Price’s show-stopping rap and villainous cackle on the title track. It just makes so much more sense.\n\nThriller’s embarrassment of singles: When I say this, I don’t mean it as a compliment. What I mean is Jackson should’ve been slightly embarrassed to have released all but one of the songs on his album as official singles. C’mon, man.\n\nI don’t wanna be startin’ somethin’\n\nNo disrespect is intended with this blog post. I understand that Thriller is beloved by millions, and the album deserves the praise it’s received for all the reasons I gave above. I just think it’s important to get a little perspective on the record and remind ourselves that sales and popularity don’t necessarily equal top-notch quality (see McDonald’s). Aw shucks, that was too harsh again – sorry about that.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I still own three copies of Thriller – one on CD and two on vinyl. Both LPs are on Epic (catalog QE 38112), which are Canadian pressings dated to 1982. I have no plans to give any of them up anytime soon, so how bad can Thriller be, right? Not bad at all – just a little overrated.\n\nTop ten original line-up Duran Duran 12″ singles\n\nIt only counts if Andy’s on it.\n\nIf you stick with this blog long enough, one thing you’ll learn about me is that when I find something I like, I get drunk on it. This applies to Duran Duran’s early 12” singles.\n\nI remember a radio station\n\nWhen I was young, CFNY 102.1 Toronto had a healthy bias toward British pop that put them askew from the top 40 and made them interesting to me. The station often played extended mixes and if I was lucky I’d hear the Live Earl Jive spin a Duran Duran night version. If I was really lucky I’d jam a cassette into my mini-boom box in time to cue it up and record a good amount of the song.\n\nI remember a book\n\nIt was a Duran Duran biography by Kasper De Graaf and Malcolm Garrett that I bought in grade 7. In addition to providing a well-written back story on the band, it also had a full discography of all their LPs, 7” singles and 12” singles up to the time of publishing.\n\nSo. Many. Records. So many unexplored night versions and B-sides. Over the next 12 months or so, I managed to scoop them all up and they were consumed thoroughly in the ensuing years.\n\nThe top 10\n\nI consider myself an authority on the virtues and flaws of each 12” single by Duran Duran Mark I, so I’m gonna count them down from 10 to 1 – here we go…\n\n10. Save a Prayer\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5327 (UK pressing, 1982)\n\nA side: Save a Prayer\n\nB side: Hold Back the Rain (remix)\n\nThis 12” single ranks last only because it doesn’t offer anything “special” – all of its songs are pretty much exactly what you get on the Rio LP. Don’t get me wrong, Save a Prayer is one of the band’s finest moments and is an outstanding example of how each member serves the song equally. But special credit needs to be given to John Taylor, whose tasteful basslines subtly add both space and movement to the music.\n\nHaving said that, the original mix of Hold Back the Rain on the B-side was new to my ears back in 1984. Up to that point I’d only ever known the harsh Kershenbaum mix from the North American version of the Rio album (as described in a previous post).\n\n9. Rio\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5346 (UK pressing, 1982)\n\nA side: Rio (part 2)\n\nB side: Rio (LP version); My Own Way (LP version)\n\nRio part 2 is just a walkthrough of the LP version of the song, minus vocals during the verses. It doesn’t do much to enhance the listener’s appreciation for the music, but it does give the spotlight to another stellar performance by John Taylor. Also noteworthy is that Rio (part 2) doesn’t fade out – you get to hear the band play the song out to the very end.\n\n8. Hungry Like the Wolf\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5295 (UK pressing, 1982)\n\nA side: Hungry Like the Wolf (night version)\n\nB side: Careless Memories (live)\n\nI think when this was released in 1982, it marked the point where the band was too busy to step into a studio and re-record night versions of their singles. The so-called night version of Hungry Like the Wolf is a remix that runs the listener through an instrumental version of the song before replaying the whole thing all over again with vocals restored. I don’t care if the approach was lazy; after dropping a killer track like that, the band didn’t owe me one damn thing extra.\n\nCareless Memories was extracted from a live performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1981. I’ve heard that whole concert – it’s excellent – and I think they literally chose the worst song from that show for this B-side.\n\n7. Is There Something I Should Know\n\nCatalog No.: Capitol 75039 (Canadian pressing, 1983)\n\nA side: Is There Something I Should Know (Monster Mix)\n\nB side: Faith in This Colour\n\nI did a whole blog post about this 12” single already. Here’s the Coles Notes: it was my first 12” ever; it has a quality remix on the A-side; the instrumental B-side is weak; and it should have included the radio version of Is There Something I Should Know. If you want more detailed musings on this one, please consider this a written invitation from me to you to check out my earlier post.\n\n6. Union of the Snake\n\nCatalog No.: Capitol 75043 (Canadian pressing, 1983)\n\nA side: Union of the Snake (Monkey Mix)\n\nB side: Union of the Snake (LP version); Secret Oktober\n\nThe Monkey Mix of Union of the Snake is a worthy remix that goes a long way to redeem the original LP version of the song. It dials up the rhythm instruments and pushes out the clutter that crippled the LP version, making for a tidier arrangement and more discernable, meaningful song.\n\nSecret Oktober is underpinned by a tribal rhythm, yet still feels loose. The song would have added much-needed breathing room to side 1 of Seven and the Ragged Tiger had it been put there. To me it sounds like the foundation loop used for this song was slowed down and recycled in Tiger Tiger.\n\nUnlike all other 12” singles on this list, this one’s notable in that it plays at 33.3 rpm instead of 45. No idea why.\n\n5. New Moon on Monday\n\nCatalog No.: EMI 12 Duran 1 (UK pressing, 1984)\n\nA side: New Moon on Monday (remix)\n\nB side: Tiger Tiger (remix)\n\nThis one edges out Union of the Snake’s 12” single because it contains not one, but two remixes: one for New Moon on Monday (probably my favourite SATRT track) and another for Tiger Tiger.\n\nThe former is a thoughtful reworking that makes the guitar, bass and drums more present, bringing greater definition to parts that were buried on the LP version. The remix results in a leaner sound and even reveals a vocal outro reminiscent of the coda from Lou Reed’s Satellite of Love, another song about the moon. Coincidence? I prefer to think not.\n\nThe Tiger Tiger remix is – once again – an improvement over the LP version. The more spare treatment brings greater directness to the track. (Can we all just agree that we need a SATRT redux?)\n\n4. Careless Memories\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5168 (UK pressing, 1981)\n\nA side: Careless Memories\n\nB side: Fame; Khanada\n\nIronically, the weakest song on this 12” is the single, Careless Memories, which is just the run-of-the-mill LP version. The real gems are on the B-side.\n\nWell, maybe it’s a stretch to call Duran’s cover of David Bowie’s Fame a “gem” – it’s more robotic than funky and a tad fast for my taste. But it was my first-ever exposure to that song and it left a lasting impression on me.\n\nThe true sleeper is the other B-side, Khanada. Kicking off with a soaring guitar lead, the song is one of early Duran’s most dynamic. It sways softly through the verses until the double-time choruses drive up the tempo and intensity. The sitar-laden ending is mysteriously unsettling and when it’s over I can’t help but think this shoulda been on their debut album.\n\n3. Planet Earth\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5137 (UK pressing, 1981)\n\nA side: Planet Earth (night version)\n\nB side: Planet Earth; Late Bar\n\nThe first Duran Duran single, and the first night version I remember ever hearing. The overall arrangement stays true to the LP version, except for an obviously extended intro, slightly faster tempo and completely different breakdown. The sounds the band uses are vastly different, and this is what makes the Planet Earth night version striking. The snare drum is exchanged for hand claps; the guitar lead is replaced with a buzzing synth and then later, a saxophone. The song may remain fundamentally the same, but the sonic palette they chose gives it a slick new sheen.\n\nBy early Duran Duran standards, Late Bar is about as rough and tumble as they come. Seemingly about an all-night bender, the song is dominated by Andy Taylor’s overdriven guitar throughout; I imagine it drove keyboardist Nick Rhodes nuts. Not the band’s strongest B-side, but a tune that can be appreciated regardless for its uniqueness in their catalog.\n\n2. My Own Way\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5254 (UK pressing, 1981)\n\nA side: My Own Way (night version)\n\nB side: Like an Angel; My Own Way (short version)\n\nThis one scores points on so many levels, yet falls short of the number 1 spot due to sub-par execution.\n\nBoth the single and night versions of My Own Way turn the version from the Rio LP on its head. Absent are the heavy Simmons drum beats, muscular guitars and slapping, popping bass. Instead, strings permeate and the track has an unmistakable disco flavour. But there’s a disconnect – the strings sound like an afterthought and never mesh with the rhythm tracks. While I appreciate the effort to deliver fans something new, it doesn’t have nearly the same energy, power or personality as the superior LP version.\n\nBut the flip side, though. In my opinion Like an Angel isn’t just Duran Duran’s best B-side, it’s one of their best songs, period. The dreamy ballad easily outshines the A-side, and if I was in charge of the band I would’ve installed it on the Rio album in place of Lonely in Your Nightmare. Beautiful guitar leads abound through the whole song but never step on the toes of Simon Le Bon’s excellent vocal. The fact that a song of this quality was relegated to B-side status is proof positive that the band were operating at their peak and could just crap out sublime music at will.\n\n1. Girls on Film\n\nCatalog No.: 12 EMI 5206 (UK pressing, 1981)\n\nA side: Girls on Film (night version)\n\nB side: Girls on Film (single version); Faster Than Light\n\nThis one is tops because the A-side is what I consider to be the archetypal Duran Duran night version and boasts an excellent B-side, to boot.\n\nFirst let’s go over the Girls on Film night version. Was it re-recorded from scratch? Check. Was it radically rearranged? Check. Extended intro? Check. Dancefloor ready? Oh ya. This tune was overhauled in all the right ways – whole new parts got created, new textures were introduced, and melodies and licks got changed to the point where the resulting song is almost unrecognizable from its origin.\n\nI love how throughout the intro the rhythm section playfully halts and restarts, over and over again. It creatively keeps listeners in constant suspense and makes them practically beg for the groove to kick in (which doesn’t happen until the one-minute mark). After the first couple of verses and choruses, the song opens wide up and gives Andy Taylor room to emerge with an ethereal guitar solo. Then a new verse kicks in to take the song to a climax, and then fade.\n\nWhen I was young, Faster Than Light was my favourite of all the Duran Duran B-sides. It has a warm, welcoming feel and is undeniably catchy and singable. Now that I’m older the song still retains its many charms but seems slightly facile and doesn’t challenge in the same way as, say, Khanada or Late Bar. Still a very satisfying song and more than worthy as a B-side.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs I go through these records – especially the ones from ’81 and ’82 – I get the sense that they were meant to be ephemeral. The vinyl itself is surprisingly thin and the sleeves are made from stock that’s only slightly heavier than the paper in your printer. I can’t help but get the feeling that EMI expected the band’s then-teenage audience to consider these disposable.\n\nSome of us didn’t, though. I’m proud to say mine are still in pretty much the same shape as I found them in about 35 years ago – I’m a good boy."
