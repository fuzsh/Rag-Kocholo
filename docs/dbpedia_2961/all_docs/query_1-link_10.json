        "text": "Interesting thread. I recall the Propaganda album well but never stopped to look who played bass. He was cracking with Simple Minds, some of the B sides were quite something. I think that when he and Mick MacNeil quit, that band lost a leg or two (and it's heart). Back around '92 or '93 I got to know Mick MacNeil when he was working with Robin Zander (Cheap Trick) on an album and he used to tell me unlimited yarns about the behaviour of Jim Kerr (Herr Kerr as the band would say, you need the Glasgow accent to get that). Mick and Derek both got so sick of all that they quit.\n\nI'd say Propaganda's big album was the first lineup with Claudia Brucken: A Secret Wish (on ZTT) - remember 'The First Cut'?. 1234 was the new lineup and 'Heaven give me words' was a minor hit but the band seemed to fade rather quickly and I believe Virgin dropped them shortly after.\n\nBut the big thing looking back IMHO is the magic combo of Derek on bass and Mick on keys. There is no doubt at all that Mick composed all the big themes of the Simple Minds years - and Kerr made sure he never got the credit or nowhere near the credit he deserved.\n\nI know Simple Minds have fallen out of fashion but what they were doing in the early to mid years (up to Mick's departure) was quite magical, and they were stadium massive to boot. The Simple Minds sound powerhouse was Derek Forbes and Mick Macneil.\n\nthanks @darkandrew for reminding me of those years👍\n\nedit: Propaganda's hit was called Duel of course, featuring the lyric 'the first cut won't hurt at all...'\n\nEdited November 22, 2019 by Soledad\n\nI travel is a strange dance floor new wave hit that I love so much.\n\nI still remember when New Gold Dream (81, 82, 83, 84) was released. What an impressive album, still up to date today with these Derek's typical bass lines moving the woofers a lot. I still can see the big speakers moving a lot at Caroline Music in Louvain-la-Neuve where the record was played non stop all day long. Delightful.\n\nAfter that, the maxi single Waterfront went out with that hypnotic bass line.\n\nWas studying in Brussels back then and was a mate of La Strada record seller there. Told him the following album will be impressive. And it was as Sparkle in the rain still has this powerful sound, but not the surprising sound and composition of the previous. There was something in the air or more precisely in the record groove annoucing what was going to happen...\n\nAnd then came the announcement of Derek quitting the band. The next album came out and was impressively disappointing. The magic had gone with the bass...\n\nSo sad. That said I never liked the brother of Bun Kerr. Such an a**hole.\n\nDerek was a huge influence to me as a musician and still is and I got to meet him and interview him back in 2010 when he was playing with Los Mondo Bongo in 2010. Below is the interview that I posted on Basschat.\n\nAs for Simple Minds, you could probably say I am a massive fan and have seen them live so many times, sadly not with Derek on bass but fortunately with Mick McNeil. Personally, Simple Minds was most hurt when Mick McNeil left after the Street Fighting Years album. He was the sound of Simple Minds for me and over the years as more albums were released, they lost so much. The following album, Real Life was still a masterpiece, probably because Mick likely had an input in the songs but the following album really started to suffer although some good tracks did follow. As for Derek, again Simple Minds lost a lot when he left, he certainly had a signature sound with his flanger and fretless bass lines. However, John Giblin and Malcom Foster were both superb bassists and I think filled the gap, just in a different way. Derek did have an input in the Once Upon A Time album despite having left when it was finally recorded and did play some of the songs live before he left.\n\nHope this doesn’t derail the thread - and genuine apologies in advance to darkandrew if I do! - but with the discussion regarding the departure of the mighty Derek Forbes and Michael McNeil it’s worth bearing in mind how things could have turned out had they been able to get their producer of choice for the Sparkle in the Rain album, Alex Sadkin.\n\nFor me, it’s the last album I liked of theirs, albeit I find it patchy, to say the least. That said, there are a number of fine Derek Forbes moments on their.\n\nThese snippets of two demos have been on the internet for a while and as a fan of the band up to that point I am genuinely disappointed that the album didn’t follow this route, rather than the course Steve Lillywhite took them on.\n\nBook of Brilliant Things kicks in around the 3min mark...\n\nA Derek Forbes story. Back in a bygone age (circa 1983/84) me and some mates were in a band and sent a load of demo tapes out to various record companies, including Virgin Records - this is when they were based in/around Notting Hill/Ladbroke Grove area. We received a letter (I think) from a guy (again, I think) called Ronnie Gurr and were invited down to Virgin to discuss the demo.\n\nPicture us ecstatic and planning how to compete with the likes of Simple Minds, Comsat Angels and bands of that ilk who we were fans of at the time.\n\nWe met with Ronnie (a fine Scottish gentleman) and were listening to the demo in Virgin’s offices when the door bursts open and in walks Mr Forbes with a huge grin. “Can you turn that fu*king racket down. My granny is trying to sleep next door!” (I’d ask you to apply a thick Glaswegian accent to that, for best effect), and then promptly leaves.\n\n”It’s Derek Forbes”, I muttered, to no one in particular. “He’s great”.\n\n”That was Derek Forbes of Simple Minds”, said Mr Gurr. He then went on to tell us all about how amazing Simple Minds were, how they’d just set a record for appearing at Hammersmith Odeon, and turned the music down (pretty much to off!).\n\nWe all just looked at each other and waited for the earliest moment to leave!!\n\nSo to paraphrase the great Scooby Doo show finale: “And we woulda got away with it if it weren’t for that pesky Forbes”!!\n\nStill love him..."
