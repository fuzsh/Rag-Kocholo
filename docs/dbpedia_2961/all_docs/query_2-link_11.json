        "text": "Burning The Ground Exclusive 1984\n\nNEW 2022 Transfer!\n\nNEW Meticulous Audio Restoration!\n\nOriginally posted August 14, 2012\n\n++ Of note the original transfer in 2012 was the USA 12″ of “The Reflex” which was pressed at 33 ⅓ RPM it also did not include the live b-side track. For this NEW 2022 Transfer, I decided to use the UK 12″ which is pressed at 45 RPM for better sound fidelity along with the addition of “Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)” recorded live on the b-side.\n\n“The Reflex” is the eleventh single by the English new wave band Duran Duran, released in 1984. The song was heavily remixed for single release and was the third and last to be taken from their third studio album Seven and the Ragged Tiger (1983). The single became the band’s first to reach the top of the US singles chart and their second to top the UK singles chart.\n\n“The Reflex” became the band’s most successful single, topping the UK chart on 5 May 1984. It was their second UK No. 1, after 1983’s “Is There Something I Should Know?”, and would prove to be their last. The single entered the charts in America on 21 April 1984 at no. 46, became Duran Duran’s first of two singles to hit no. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 (for 2 weeks) on 23 June 1984 , and was a huge hit internationally. (Their only other single to hit no. 1 in the US was the title song to the 1985 James Bond film “A View to a Kill”.) It was also the first of two songs that kept “Dancing in the Dark” by Bruce Springsteen out of the top spot (the other one being Prince’s “When Doves Cry”). The band wanted it to be the lead single from Seven and the Ragged Tiger (1983), but their label did not like the warbling singing during the “why don’t you use it” segments, thinking this would hinder its success as a stand-alone single track.\n\nThe remixes for both the 7″ and 12″ singles were created by Nile Rodgers, of Chic fame. It was his first work with the band, and he would later go on to produce “The Wild Boys” single as well as the album Notorious (1986) and several tracks on Astronaut (2004).\n\nProducer Ian Little recalled the sound Nick Rhodes came up with on his Roland Jupiter-8 keyboard: “…whenever I hear that steel-drum part it always brings a smile to my face because it’s so out of tune. Steel drums always are, but it was exactly right in terms of rhythm and tone. So a wood-block sound was mixed in to make it even more percussive and, successfully, it did the job.”\n\nThe live B-side “Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)” is a cover version of a Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel song, recorded 16 November 1982 at Hammersmith Odeon in London, with lead Rebel Steve Harley joining the band onstage.\n\nSIDE A:\n\nThe Reflex (Dance Mix) 6:34\n\nMixed By – Jason Corsaro, Nile Rodgers\n\nWritten-By – Duran Duran\n\nSIDE B:\n\nThe Reflex (Dance Mix Edited) 4:22\n\nMixed By –Jason Corsaro, Nile Rodgers\n\nWritten-By – Duran Duran\n\nMake Me Smile (Come Up And See Me) 4:55\n\nMixed By – Ian Little\n\nWritten-By –Steve Harley\n\nVINYL GRADE:\n\nVinyl: Near Mint\n\nSleeve: Near Mint\n\nU.S. CHARTS HISTORY\n\nYear Single Chart Position 1984 The Reflex U.S. Billboard Hot 100 #1 1984 The Reflex U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play #15\n\nRELEASE INFORMATION:\n\nLabel: EMI – 12DURAN 2, EMI – 12 DURAN 2\n\nFormat: Vinyl, 12″, 45 RPM, Single\n\nCountry: UK\n\nReleased: Apr 28, 1984\n\nGenre: Rock, Pop\n\nStyle: New Wave, Synth-pop\n\nCREDITS:\n\nLacquer Cut By – Arun*\n\nProducer – Alex Sadkin (tracks: A, B1), Duran Duran (tracks: A, B1), Ian Little (tracks: A, B1)\n\nNOTES:\n\nTrack B2 recorded live in November 1982 at Hammersmith Odeon.\n\nManufactured In The UK By EMI Records Limited.\n\nFrom the LP “Seven And The Ragged Tiger”\n\nBuy the 12″ at DISCOGS\n\nVINYL TRANSFER & AUDIO RESTORATION:\n\n-DjPaulT\n\nburningtheground.net\n\nTHE GEAR:\n\nTurntable: Pro-Ject Debut Carbon (DC)\n\nCartridge/Stylus: Ortofon 2M Black\n\nTurntable Isolation Platform: ISO-Tone™ Turntable Isolation Platform\n\nPlatter: Pro-Ject Acryl-It platter\n\nStabilizer: Pro-Ject Record Puck\n\nPhono Pre-amp: Pro-Jec Tube Box DS2\n\nDAC: Alpha Design Labs GT40a USB DAC\n\nRecord Cleaning: VPI HW 16.5 Record Cleaning Machine\n\nArtwork Scans: Epson Workforce WF-7610 Professional Printer/Scanner\n\nSOFTWARE:\n\nRecording/Editing: Adobe Audition 3.0 (Recording)\n\nDown Sampling/Dither: iZotope RX Advanced 2\n\nArtwork Editor: Adobe Photoshop CS5\n\nClick Removal: Manual\n\nFLAC/MP3 Conversion: dBpoweramp\n\nM3U Playlist: Playlist Creator\n\nRESTORATION NOTES:\n\nAll vinyl rips are recorded @ 32bit/float\n\nFLAC (Level Eight)\n\nArtwork scanned at 600dpi\n\n**24bit FLAC Only Available For Seven Days!\n\nPassword: burningtheground\n\nYou can help show your support for this blog by making a donation using PayPal.

The song has since come to be one of Jones’ signature tunes. The song was co-written by Jones herself, Sly Dunbar, Dana Mano, and Robbie Shakespeare.\n\nUpon its release, “Pull Up to the Bumper” spent seven weeks at number 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, as well as becoming a Top-5 single on the U.S. R&B chart.\n\nIn 1985 the track was remixed and re-released to promote the Island Life compilation, the Extended Remix includes additional keyboard overdubs and remix by Paul “Groucho” Smykle. This 1985 remix peaked at #12 on the UK pop chart in early 1986.\n\nJones’ genre-hopping artistry earned her a diehard LGBTQ+ fan base from day one, largely because of her very uncommon divadom. By gleefully toying with masculine and feminine conventions, she offered her queer audience a constantly evolving performance in which they could recognize their own sexual fluidity. “Bumper” succinctly captures Jones’ protean mix of playfulness and aggression, simultaneously tongue-in-cheek and deadly serious. It’s a masterstroke of double entendre that, with its sinuous reggae-disco backdrop and Jones’ snarled vehicular puns, really only demands one thing from you: that you move.\n\nSIDE A:\n\nPull Up To The Bumper (Extended Remix) 6:25\n\nRemix – Paul “Groucho” Smykle\n\nProducer – Alex Sadkin, Chris Blackwell\n\nWritten-By – Dana Mano, Grace Jones, Koo Koo Baya\n\nSIDE B:\n\nLa Vie En Rose 7:20\n\nArranged By – Duke Williams\n\nProducer – Tom Moulton\n\nWritten-By – E.
