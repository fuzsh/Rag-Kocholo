        "text": "July 5, 2021\n\nALBUM REVIEW\n\nArcadia – So Red the Rose\n\nOVERALL (OUT OF 10): 9\n\nWhen Duran Duran took a break in the mid-80s after ruling the radiowaves for the first part of the decade, the band split cleanly into two camps – bassist John Taylor and guitarist Andy Taylor joined The Power Station with Robert Palmer, which anyone with any sense whatsoever would never have done. Singer Simon Le Bon, keyboardist Nick Rhodes, and drummer Roger Taylor wisely avoided any Robert Palmers and formed their own band, Arcadia, releasing their only album, 1985’s So Red the Rose. Which is a shame, I would have loved about 10 more albums just like it. That Arcadia was the far superior of the two side projects makes total sense – after all, what was Duran Duran’s appeal built on? Simon Le Bon’s charismatic and emotionally resonant vocals, and the synthesizer wizardry of Nick Rhodes. Andy Taylor was good at coming up with guitar parts that suited the band’s songs well, but Duran Duran was never really considered a guitar band. Arcadia kept the heart and soul of what made Duran Duran one of the greatest pop bands of its time, and if you had to pick as few members of Duran Duran as possible and still preserve as much of its sound as you could, Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhoades are the two I’d pick. And I guess it’s OK if Roger Taylor tagged along.\n\nI need to warn you up front, I am going to gush about So Red the Rose for the next few minutes, I am a huge fan of the album. If ever there was a criminally underappreciated album from the 80s, this is it. Kelvin Hayes over at the AllMusic site called So Red the Rose “certainly the best album Duran never made”. I appreciate a clever turn of phrase as much as the next guy, but I think a correction is in order – this is better than any album Duran Duran ever made. Surely not better than Rio you say? To which I reply, yes, it is in fact better than Rio. You can tell by looking at the album covers – sure, the “cherry ice cream smile” brunette on Rio has a cute sort of appeal, but there is something stark, bold, and mysterious – almost sinister, certainly with a hint of danger – about the woman pictured on So Red the Rose.\n\nShe’s like the Rio girl’s more sophisticated, enigmatic, passionate older cousin, who has much more adult pursuits in mind while her younger cousin “dances on the sand”. The Rio girl is the girl next door compared to the So Red the Rose girl’s Russian double agent, maybe triple agent. You’d expect to see the so Red the Rose woman on the runway – you’d expect to see the Rio girl at the mall. Wikipedia tells me the “album’s artwork featured painted ink drawings by fashion illustrator Tony Viramontes of fashion model Violeta Sanchez”. Whereas I think I saw the girl on Rio as one of the models on the wall at Walmart one time.\n\nSo yeah, So Red the Rose is obviously going to be the better album.\n\nBut seriously, you have to admit that cover is pretty striking. Back in the 80s when I was a teen I used to decorate the walls of my room with album covers, and I had that one in the perfect place on the wall where it was illuminated by a streetlight shining in through my bedroom window in the dark of night, and I’d lie in bed and the only thing I could see in the dark was the face of Lady Ice in the night. It was pretty cool – at least when you’re 17 anyway.\n\nBut it isn’t just the album cover that makes this “Duran Duran album that never was” so much better than the best album they actually made. So Red the Rose is superior to Rio in so many other ways.\n\nSo Red the Rose has the best production of any 80s album I have ever heard, bar none. If you ask me, 80s music gets a bad rap. Sure, a lot of it was Velveeta over-processed cheese product, but I think we have to give music in the 80s some credit for searching for new sounds in ways the music industry hadn’t since the days of The Beatles. There were all kinds of cool synthesizer sounds we began hearing in the early 80s, although it must be conceded that they were presaged by Brian Eno and David Bowie’s Berlin trilogy (and in fact much of the music that inspired Bowie). Credit where credit is due. But in the early 80s you heard sounds on albums that had never been heard before, and that sense of sonic adventurism that pervaded those years is sorely missed in 2021 if you ask me. Bands tried to come up with strange, interesting new synthesized sounds, it was a very creative time that way. You heard sounds on mainstream radio in 1985 you’d never have imagined a decade earlier. Synthesizers and keyboards were responsible for some real atrocities in the 80s, sure, but the quest for new, imaginative sounds is something we ought to appreciate in 80s music more than we do. I think So Red the Rose represents the climax of that 80s synthesizer adventurism.\n\nSo Red the Rose has some of the absolute best production on any album from any period I’ve ever heard. The music is incredibly textured – Duran Duran always had a thing for cool sounds popping out of nowhere all over in their songs, but on So Red the Rose they are used to better effect than even on Rio. As much as I love Rio, I’ve always felt the production was a bit stiff, the vocals in particular, but also the instrumentation. Everything sounds a little too regimented and calculated. That’s why I like the live versions of the songs on Arena so much better, they breathe a lot more, they feel less straightjacketed and claustrophobic. So Red the Rose doesn’t have that problem, it has a very natural, organic sound, despite being so based in the digital, as opposed to the analog, world. The album’s mix is remarkable – so much is going on in each and every track, but without ever once overwhelming or obscuring the song. I’m not sure I have ever heard an album with such a phenomenal mix.\n\n”Missing” deserves a special mention on this score – I have never heard anything like it. It is a beautiful song built on a sound collage, with its rich variety of sounds popping in and out, but all of which make sense in the context of the song. A sound collage with an exceptional, aching melody over top of it – for me, the song highlights why The Beatles’ “Revolution Number 9” fails so miserably in comparison as a sound collage – that “song” is just random sounds without any kind of structure or unifying theme. What Arcadia did so well with “Missing” was create a sound collage to support a remarkable, entrancing melody. One of the most haunting and beautiful songs I know, and a personal favorite of mine. There’s no real percussion on the song, there must have been something that was mixed out in the final mix that kept everything in time, but it gives the song a sort of phantom rhythm that you can’t hear, but can sense all the same. Of course, like any of the Duran Duran songs the lyrics don’t make a lick of sense, but all the same it has some wonderfully evocative lines, “whispering your love song in my ear/how do you touch me/when you’re not really here?”. The song is an overlooked masterpiece in my estimation, the pinnacle of everything Duran Duran ever sought to achieve in terms of New Romanticism.\n\nBut the entire album is brimming with fun, unexpected sounds that jump out at you from nowhere, but are an enhancement rather than a distraction. They all fit perfectly into the songs they were embedded in. This is an album that really needs to be listened to in headphones so you don’t miss a single sonic flourish. Besides, few albums I have heard take such good advantage of the full potential of stereo, sounds swirl around the stereo field, there’s always something interesting going on around the song. You get a taste of it in the opening moments as “Election Day” begins the album – sounds swirl around you through the speakers as Le Bon gives us a typically passionate vocal that more than makes up for whatever nonsense the lyrics are going on about. Le Bon is very much like Elton John in that respect – much like Elton John’s unsurpassed sense of melody was able to compensate for Bernie Taupin’s awful lyrics, Le Bon sang Duran Duran’s nonsense lyrics with such evocative passion that you didn’t even notice how empty they were – much like Elton, he sang them like they meant something, and did it so well it was more than enough to make you think they did. I have no idea what “I pull my shirt off and pray/Saving myself to suffer the heatwave…We’re coming up on re-election day” is supposed to mean, but it’s got such a great melody and Le Bon sings it with such panache that I don’t care. I’m hooked. Simon Le Bon deserves way more credit than he gets for being able to sell us all on such meaningless lyrics. On occasion a resonant line would pop up in a Duran Duran song, but never as part of any sort of narrative or thematic structure. And so it is with Arcadia – don’t look for much meaning in the lyrics, just be willing to go along for the ride with Le Bon’s poignant vocals. I love “Election Day”, in spite of the ridiculous Grace Jones interlude – the cool beat, catchy melody, and snazzy saxes after each chorus pull me in every time.\n\n”Missing” and “Election Day” are the two best songs on the album, but “El Diablo” isn’t far behind. A snatch of whirling Gypsy violin leads into sumptuous slice of pan pipe heaven, until Le Bon pulls you in with another irresistibly passionate and catchy chorus: “One life with the devil do I play/For so long el Diablo is to blame”. When in the bridge he sings “Oh el Diablo, el Diablo, won’t you sell me back my soul” (accented by some cool Spanish guitar) you’d swear he really was pleading with Old Scratch to get his soul back. I really can’t say enough about how integral Simon Le Bon was to Duran Duran’s and Arcadia’s success – in the hands of a less committed, less charismatic vocalist lyrics like these would be seen for the utter cheese that they are, but the guy sang them like they meant something and fooled us all into thinking they did. No small feat. Anyway, “El Diablo” is another mini-masterpiece, and kicks the crap out of 90% of anything on an actual Duran Duran album.\n\nSo those are the highlights, but there really aren’t any lowlights, on the whole it is a far stronger and consistent album than Rio. There’s nothing as boring and generic as “My Own Way”, and nothing as unremarkable as “Last Chance on the Stairway”. Of course, the rest of Rio is rock solid, but So Red the Rose doesn’t have any of Rio’s weak spots. There’s the slinky guitar riff, engaging melody, and falsetto jump in the chorus that powers “Goodbye is Forever”, the alluring pop of “Keep Me in the Dark”, and the supremely catchy “The Flame”, all of which boast the sterling production and interesting soundscapes found on the rest of the album. “Keep Me in the Dark” is one of the best songs I know of to listen to with a great pair of headphones – it has such a dynamic mix, so much action moving from ear to ear, it really is a remarkable listening experience when you can fully hear everything going on in the stereo field. “The Promise” boasts some typically exceptional guitar playing by guest David Gilmour, and backing vocals by Sting if you’re the kind of person who’s impressed by that, and another catchy falsetto drenched chorus: “Heaven hide your eyes/Heaven’s eyes will never dry”. Any of these songs could have been a single, all of them boast ear worm choruses and a shimmering pop sheen ready made for 80s radio.\n\nThe album closes out with “Lady Ice”, which while not exactly a weak track, I find the be the least impressive song on the album. It opens with some mysterious ominous keyboards with appropriately cold instrumentation and spooky trimmings. Oddly, the melody is much stronger in the verses than in the chorus – while the verses boast an engaging melody with another fantastic falsetto jump, the chorus sticks to just a couple of notes and is considerably less interesting. And then the song just kind of fades away abruptly after the last chorus, it’s really kind of odd – at the end of an album with such marvelously constructed songs the last one on the album kind of ends with just a whimper, it’s not the strong finale I would have hoped for. “Lady Ice” isn’t a weak song so much as one that could have been improved upon, but that’s a minor quibble on such a entrancing album.\n\nWe really need to sing producer Alex Sadkin’s praises here, his production work on the album was phenomenal, and he died tragically in a car crash a couple of short years later at the age of 38. Personally I think the musically boring 90s needed all the great producers it could get, and they really could have used him. I think it’s a real tragedy the music biz lost such a talented producer, someone who had worked with a variety of artists that included Stephen Stills and Neil Young, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Joe Cocker, and Grace Jones. He did an outstanding job on this album.\n\nYou’ve probably never heard So Red the Rose, but if you have the slightest interest in Duran Duran, or 80s music in general, you really need to hear it. I need to knock a point off on the rubric due to a proliferation of nonsense lyrics, but otherwise it’s a perfect album. I’ll go so far as to give it my endorsement as the best album of the 80s – my favorite anyway. It’s certainly the best the decade had to offer in terms of keyboard-based “New Romantic” pop, and a pure sonic marvel."
