        "text": "Another tardy response, but I think it will be of interest. I found this on the web:\n\n“Hitchcock Railway” is a song about someone getting a ride on an interstate railway. There are tickets bought to head west to Los Angeles. There’s also a round trip ticket back home. As the passenger is making their bed where a feather falls, their life seems to be uprooted. When he sings “been tried, guaranteed passport,” what does this mean? Has a ride on the Hitchcock Railway been tried before, so he knows it will be a ride made for comfort? Or is this a reference to his past? Has being “tried” involved having had to stand trial to face criminal charges? And now that he is guaranteed passport, he sees freedom on his horizon? And why is he going to “go insane” on this train?\n\nThe town of Hitchcock, Oklahoma, was established along the Enid and Anadarko Railway line (conveyed to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway in 1903) by the Hitchcock Townsite Company. There was a railway station in this town of over 300 people. But a fire burned down 21 businesses in 1905 and the community decreased to its current population of 121. (There is no railway in Hitchcock, South Dakota). But it is more likely that Don Dunn may have had Hitchcock, Texas, in mind for his song. Hitchcock, Texas, was created as a station of the railroad between Galveston and Houston in 1873 and around the turn of the 20th century became a vegetable shipping center. The settlement’s economy crashed in the 1930s after insect plagues in the surrounding areas, and the area stayed impoverished until the establishment of the Camp Wallace anti-aircraft training base and the Hitchcock Naval Air Station at the beginning of World War II. In the 1960s, with a population over 5,200, a trip out of Hitchcock, Texas, to L.A. would have been a dream come true for any working class Joe.\n\nThe only other possibility for the inspiration of ‘Hitchcock’ in the song’s title would be a popular reference to Alfred Hitchcock; The British filmmaker of sixty suspense and horror movies, including North By Northwest, Psycho, The Birds and Notorious. However, unless the reference to “going insane” is intended to convey some sort of mental breakdown, instead of being bored to tears, there is little in the lyrics to argue the filmmaker inspired the song’s title.\n\nSongwriter Don Dunn had also written “Lydia Purple,” which was a Top Ten hit in Vancouver in 1968 for The Collectors. Recording artists who’ve put a song by Don Dunn on vinyl include Sonny & Cher, Nancy Sinatra, Thelma Houston, Diana Ross, Rare Earth, the 5th Dimension, The Righteous Brothers and Junior Walker & The All-stars. Dunn has also been a guest vocalist on studio recordings for Diana Ross, Thelma Houston, Kenny Loggins, Seals and Crofts, Steely Dan, Kim Carnes, David Gates and Jennifer Warnes. He eventually moved to Nashville to focus on writing folk and country songs.\n\nAlso, since no one else seems to have mentioned it so far in this thread, Chris Stainton played piano on Drowned by The Who, playing a suspiciously familiar set of keyboard licks.\n\nI don't know if this was a jape by Stainton, or whether Townshend specifically requested that Stainton replicate his playing from Hitchcock Railway. I have to think that if Stainton was selected to play on this song (and 5:15) out of all the keyboard players in London at the time, then the lift may have been intentional on Townshend's part. Almost certainly Townshend would have been familiar with Cocker's recording.\n\nAllen Toussaint is the man behind hits of Fats Domino, Dave Bartholomew, Irma Thomas, Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe, Chris Kenner, The Meters, Art and Aaron Neville, Dr. John, The Pointer Sisters, Labelle and others – as songwriter, pianist, arranger or producer. He was the producer to call if you wanted a touch of New Orleans funk on your record. Only recently did I find out that he also was Naomi Neville (his mother’s name), writer of “Fortune Teller” and “Ruler of My Heart” aka “Pain in My Heart”. He recorded more than a dozen albums under his own name as a singer, too.\n\nSaw him live once – he was a great pianist. He died 2015, aged 77.\n\nMy favorite Toussaint moment is his own rendition of “Yes We Can Can”, aged 67:\n\nActually, „the steady drive of a rolling train” is my definition of a track that grabs me and holds me by its pounding rhythm. But here it’s not called for. You’re right: This version is totally overproduced.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s great version has horns and background singers, too, and even strings – but not all at the same time. They are sparingly used at the right time. The \"I heard it through the” choir is on Gladys Knight & The Pips’ version (recorded after but released before Gaye’s), but there it isn’t obtrusive. Creedence Clearwater Revival has proven that it can be done as a guitar song. But I don’t like the guitar solo in Joe’s recording – it’s over the top. The sparse production is the key to bring out the underlying drama of the lyrics.\n\nThank you for posting the last two tracks of this album.\n\nSheffield Steel\n\nStudio album by\n\nJoe Cocker\n\nReleased 22 May 1982\n\nRecorded Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas\n\nGenre Blues rock, soft rock\n\nLength 38:19\n\nLabel Island\n\nProducer Chris Blackwell, Alex Sadkin\n\nSheffield Steel is the eighth studio album by Joe Cocker, produced by Chris Blackwell and Alex Sadkin, with Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung and Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson, a.k.a. the Compass Point Allstars, a studio band named after the legendary Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas, and released in 1982. This was Cocker's first album for Island Records and followed a four-year break in recording for the singer following his previous album, Luxury You Can Afford. It was re-released in 2002 with several bonus tracks.\n\nJoe Cocker – lead vocals\n\nAdrian Belew, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung – guitar\n\nRobbie Shakespeare – bass guitar\n\nWally Badarou – keyboards\n\nSly Dunbar – drums\n\nUziah Thompson – percussion\n\nRobert Palmer, Jimmy Cliff – backing vocals\n\nTechnical\n\nChris Blackwell, Alex Sadkin – producers\n\nPaul Wexler – production associate\n\nAlex Sadkin, Benjamin Armbrister – engineer\n\nTed Jensen – mastering at Sterling Sound, NYC\n\nDavid Oxtoby – cover painting\n\n\"Look What You've Done\" (Leo Nocentelli)\n\n\"Shocked\" (Ira Ingber, Gregg Sutton)\n\n\"Sweet Little Woman\" (Andy Fraser)\n\n\"Seven Days\" (Bob Dylan)\n\n\"Marie\" (Randy Newman)\n\n\"Ruby Lee\" (Bill Withers, Melvin Dunlap)\n\n\"Many Rivers to Cross\" (Jimmy Cliff)\n\n\"So Good, So Right\" (Brenda Russell)\n\n\"Talking Back to the Night\" (Steve Winwood, Will Jennings)\n\n\"Just Like Always\" (Jimmy Webb)\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n\"Sweet Little Woman\" (Andy Fraser) [12\" mix]\n\n\"Look What You've Done\" (Leo Nocentelli) [12\" mix]\n\n\"Right in the Middle (Of Falling in Love)\" (Sam Dees)\n\n\"Inner City Blues\" (Marvin Gaye, James Nyx Jr.)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChris Blackwell leads Joe to Jamaica and gives him a house band to dream of. With the Rhythm section od Sly and Robbie, the guitar of Zappa and Crimson's Adrian Belew, we know before listening that these guys can play. a Quick scan of the playlist and the songwriters puts a smile on the face.....\n\nEverything looks like it is in place for an Actual Comeback album... but before we get there ....\n\nJoe Cocker and The Crusaders - I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today\n\nIn 1981 Joe recorded a single with the Crusaders. We get a really nice mellow intro, and it moves into a nice funky beat. Joe sounds refreshed and right into it. The arrangement and the production is much more complimentary to the vocalist.\n\nI am not sure how this came along, but I think this was a good step towards what we get here.\n\nI think the way this song is put together works a little better than what we received on the previous album.\n\nAnyway, I haven't had a chance to really revisit this album yet, but I am looking forward to doing so. This is an excellent album and is really the start of the rebirth of Joe Cocker.\n\nPlease give us your thoughts and feelings on this album, and we'll hit the first track or two tomorrow.\n\nCheers\n\nMark\n\nSheffield Steel\n\nNot only my favourite album by Joe Cocker but one of my favourite albums period.\n\nWhen this one was released I already was a huge Sly & Robbie fan, the best riddim twins. Linked with the Compass Point all stars they've proven many times that their playing works magic with many different artists and music styles. They're instantly recognizable and yet realize as a musician you need to serve the composition, plus let the singer shine. Blackwell and Sadkin were also a key factor in their success and their sound, which has proven to be almost timeless. Robert Palmer, who lived opposite of the Compass Point studios, dropped in for some backing vocals.\n\nThe album doesn't have any weak moments, song selection is great and yet really varied. Joe sounds better than ever before: raw and loud, tender and restrained, committed and totally in the spotlight. The reissue cd adds some great bonus tracks on top of it. Even the album cover is stellar.\n\nI would be very interested if someone could post relevant interviews (YT / print) with Joe about this album, music magazine articles, or interviews with any of the personnel.\n\nTo members who don't have a copy of this album: get it now; you're bound to enjoy it for years to come.\n\nJoin the thread for this album\n\nIn the Sheffield Steel MFSL thread some members have expressed their love for this album, so I'm calling @SteveS1 @PTgraphics @rstamberg and maybe @RoyalScam to join us this week and share their opinions. Thanks.\n\nThis is where I came back in, after jumping off with the ’72 Joe Cocker album.\n\nI was happy to hear You Are So Beautiful on the radio in ’74, just to know that Joe was still alive. But I assumed he had gone MOR, so I passed on the I Can Stand A Little Rain album.\n\nDidn’t even notice the ’75 Jamaica and ’76 Stingray albums when they came out.\n\nI remember watching Joe’s appearance with Belushi on SNL in ’76. Even though I’m sure Belushi approached this as a loving tribute to a hero, I felt it came across to the unknowing audience as more of a mocking satire rather than a celebration. I felt sad for Joe.\n\nI remember seeing the ’78 Luxury album in the stores, and feared Joe had gone disco!\n\nWhen Sheffield Steel appeared in ’82, there was a minor buzz in the press that Joe was back on track. Stripped down band, straightforward production, well-selected songs, even just the fact that it was on Island records was a big positive sign. I picked it up as a low risk purchase, not much to lose if it turned out to be a disappointment. The risk paid off, I loved it from first spin.\n\nJoe came through town on tour to support Sheffield Steel, and played the relatively small Old Waldorf. My first and only time seeing him appear live, and he just knocked me out.\n\nI immediately backtracked to pick up all the albums I had missed out on, including discovering the Crusaders’ Standing Tall album from ’81. I’m So Glad I’m Standing Here Today might as well have been Joe’s autobiography. What a life-affirming song and performance from a man who had seen his share of ups and (way) downs.\n\nSheffield Steel remains one of my all-time favorite albums to this day."
