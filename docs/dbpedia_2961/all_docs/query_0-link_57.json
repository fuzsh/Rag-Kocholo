        "text": "On the heels of that hit in 1982, they and their manager secretly worked to cut the band from 7 members to 3, and shuttled the trio of Alanah Currie, Tom Bailey and Joe Leeway to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to make more hit singles with legendary Island Records producer Alex Sadkin. The next three years of their lives were about to get nuts. They were going to become stars with three quick albums, music videos, hit singles on the Billboard and BBC charts and even a messy Live Aid appearance in Philadelphia with Madonna and Steve Stevens. They even added a logo by British graphic designer Andy Airfix. It looked really good and was perfectly fitted to the early 80s.\n\nThe band as we remember it was formed in London. Tom Bailey was the singer, from Halifax, West Yorkshire. And the driver of this bus, it seemed, was Alanah Currie, the blonde percussionist and writer from New Zealand. She took on most lyric duties, which I’ll get to in a bit.\n\nI remember exactly where I was in 1983 when they released their next two singles, Lies and Love On Your Side. I was at Whitman School in Brockton finishing fourth grade. I liked what I heard and saw, since the band fit right into the new generation of synthesizer bands. I particularly liked the bands diversity and the somewhat distinctive, almost drunken bass sound. I don’t think Joseph Martin Leeway gets enough credit for his use of an upright, fretless electric bass from 1983-1986. A very similar sounding bass appears in Thomas Dolby’s She Blinded Me With Science in 1983, and interestingly, it was played by Matthew Seligman, one of the four Twins members who was let go.\n\nSo here we have a band with the right look and sound for as many singles as they can deliver for the label. They had engineering and programming help from Thomas Dolby, who had been making money in the business since 1981 on Foreigner’s fourth album (“4”). They were just missing one key thing: consistently good lyrics. That’s one of their few weaknesses, and it has irked me for years. What brought this on is the numerous times I have compared Thompson Twins to their contemporaries in the synth-pop genre, particularly A Flock Of Seagulls, who in my analysis, did a little more with a little less. So let me dive into to some weak lines.\n\nFrom Hold Me Now (1984)\n\nYou say I'm a dreamer, we're two of a kind\n\nBoth of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find\n\nSo perhaps I should leave here\n\nYeah, yeah, and go far away\n\nBut you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be than with you here today\n\nThe video, by the way, is one of the best studio-shot music videos of the 1980s, up there with Killing Joke’s Love Like Blood.\n\nThe first verse of this smash hit is actually really good, depicting a couple that has their ups and downs. But things go off the rails in the second verse. We’re dreamers, fine. And then there’s this silly empty threat to run away. ‘Just kidding! I’d never do that. The perfect world is here babe, even though I just said we’ll never find it.’ Ugh, this is messy and weak. And yet the musical composition and mix makes it one of their best songs. In fact, if they didn’t have this smash hit, their shelf life would have been a lot shorter.\n\nMoving on. The Gap (1984)\n\nEast is east, west is west\n\nTwo different colors on the map\n\nWe say break the line, chew the fat\n\nKeep moving out into the gap\n\nTo a degree, I like the humor in this song. It’s inspired by 1,000 Nights with a sprinkle of good ‘ol T.E. Lawrence British imperialism, and it’s not not meant to be taken seriously. But I know poor lyrics when I hear them. Often it is better to be obtuse and weird than pull off this silly path to get to the title of the song. So, wait, this really is about geography?\n\nAnd finally King For A Day (1985)\n\nIf I was king for just one day\n\nI would give it all away\n\nI would give it all away to be with you\n\nIf I was king for just one day\n\nI have just one thing to say\n\nYou know what love is\n\nAll we need to get us through\n\nCan I pause for a moment and say how much I hate You Killed The Clown? I think the dislike for clowns is pretty widespread, so the title alone is a strike against the song. When I first heard the song around 2002, devouring as much New Wave music as I could, I remember questioning the meaning. Did a Debbie Downer put a stop to the fun? Did someone put a stop to comedy at a party or on a night out? Well, the lyrics suggest that someone shot down a woman who was being funny. Someone shut down the girl who was about to become the life of the party:\n\nDraped in silk gown\n\nShe danced around\n\nShe filled this place with her smile\n\nShe was the queen\n\nOf an Amazon dream\n\nShe made us feel for a while\n\nWas it from spite\n\nOr just sheer delight\n\nYou stooped so low\n\nI wanna know\n\nWhy you killed the clown\n\n(Yeah) You shot her down\n\nI watch you try\n\nTry to make that girl cry\n\nSo you could be king for just one day\n\nAnd you said that her smile\n\nWas no more than a lie\n\nJust because she had something, something to say\n\nWas it from spite\n\nOr just sheer delight\n\nYou stooped so low\n\nI wanna know\n\nWhy you killed the clown\n\n(Yeah) You shot her down\n\nYeah! Why did you shoot her down? And why did you make her cry so you could be king for a day? Ah, there goes Alanah Currie, referencing another bad song on the album! This band released their most successful trio of albums between 1983 and 1985. The last of that trilogy was terrible, aside from the great Lay Your Hands On Me. But the first two are their best. That wonderful bass and Prophet 5 is prevalent in so many of their songs from this trilogy. That’s their defining sound. That bass setup is overused, perhaps, but look at what they accomplished. They made four albums (half of which were good) and delivered over 10 hit singles in under four years. They toured. They played Live Aid in Philadelphia (while their close friend Thomas Dolby played keyboards for David Bowie at Wembley). Their sound and theme was consistent. They worked themselves to utter exhaustion (as young New Wave bands do). And then when Joe Leeway left the band, they carried on as a duo for 7 long years.\n\nIn the years that followed, I paid no attention to Thompson Twins, with one big exception. Their very good dance cover of Cole Porter’s Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was recorded around 1989, and was included on the excellent AIDS research and activism benefit album Red Hot + Blue.\n\nOne of the many discarded blog post ideas I’ve had over the last 15 years or so was a quick post about female pop stars in the mid 2000s. My post was going to make the case that Rihanna and Katy Perry are not as talented or as wildly creative as the stars we saw rise in the 1990s (Tori Amos, Fiona Apple), but they served their purpose for the present. They did the job, held the fort, and each gave us Super Bowl performances. But flash forward to 2023, and the pop landscape is very different. The best and most artistic artists are not on the big labels. Instead they are the independents. They probably always have been, but now in the streaming music era, they are so much easier to find, share, and mix together.\n\nLana Del Rey, Jessie Ware, FKA Twigs, Weyes Blood (Natalie Mering), and Caroline Polacek (“the girl in that band”) are not new in the music industry. They are all in their mid to late 30s. But they are the artists who are peaking right now to mark the next wave of greats. Several senior artists have guided them to greatness, particularly Enya. And in the case of Polacek and Wyse Blood, Brian Eno is also an influence. You can hear a lot of Eno in the guitar solo of Weyes Blood’s Mirror Forever and her last two albums overall. I also think Eno’s sound is found in the metallic guitar solo in Polacek’s Billions before Trinity School’s choir (out of Croydon, London) takes us home to close the album. It is May, and I still have Billions down as my best song of 2023, three months after it was officially released.\n\nNatalie Mering admits Eno was on her mind when she made her 2019 album, Titanic Rising. As she explained to the Australian Broadcasting Company:\n\nWe created a mood board, which was a picture of the Titanic with Brian Ferry on the stern and Brian Eno on the hull of the ship. It was rising out of the water like a phoenix from the ashes.\n\nMany critics picked-up on the Eno-like sounds and techniques, as AllMusic did:\n\nHere she underscores enormously orchestrated pop songs with eerie experimental ambience, imagining a dreamworld where Joni Mitchell's late-'70s output was produced by Brian Eno.\n\nTitanic Rising was more than a signer-songwriter project. Mering is a co-producer and she made sure her album had digital effects and soundscapes. Working with Jonathan Rado, she added a layer of psychedelic elements, walking the tightrope between futuristic and retro vinyl and cassette sounds. Her reluctant love song Andromeda even opens with the simulated sound of a damaged cassette tape. That sonic direction continues with her latest album and will likely continue with her next, which will close-out a planned trilogy of records for our dark, turbulent times.\n\nWhile FKA Twigs is working on her new, possibly more commercial album, we must acknowledge the triumph of her second full length album, Magdalene (2019), which helped make 2019 a pivotal year for women music artists. 2019 was also the breakthrough year for Caroline Polachek and Weyes Blood, who seem to recognize this and are now contemplating working together on a song. The year before the pandemic was a like a big bang for this new music. We got a buch of incredible songs like Cellophane, Daybed, Ocean Of Tears, Door, Movies and Wild Time. And now, women in their 30s, who cite Enya as a influence, rule the streaming playlists.\n\n2022 Newport Folk Festival\n\nThe marathon, three day Newport Folk Festival didn't have as much star power in 2022. I theorize that newer festivals like Palomino offered artists more money. Add the fact that just about every artist and band is touring this year and competing for venues, and you have quite a minefield of conflicts and missed connections.\n\nMy partner was trying to enjoy the Newport festival and prepare for a professional certification exam that Monday (the day after the festival wrapped) so it was difficult to see many acts nor enjoy the show very much. But we saw 40-50 minute sets by the following artists.\n\nOn Friday we caught Arooj Aftab, Bela Fleck, Taj Mahal, and Cortney Barnett.\n\nOn Saturday we saw Lucy Dacus, Clairo, Langhorne Slim, and Lucius.\n\nOn Sunday, we saw the excellent Hermanos Gutiérrez, Valerie June, Sylvan Esso, The Roots and the finale, Brandi Carlile and friends with Joni Mitchell.\n\nTwo sets really stood out in the final hours: Sylvan Esso and The Roots. Sylvan Esso is an electronic husband and wife duo from Durham who somehow make dance music that is folk-adjacent, thanks in large part to the dense lyrics. We liked them so much, we caught their show at Forest Hills Stadium in August.\n\nThe Roots, let by drummer Questlove, were on fire. They brought a big fun set that filled the fort with beats and a lot of energy. “Do you want more!,” shouted out Black Thought. I wish they had played another 20 minutes.\n\nAfter the Roots played, a cold, dirty fog rolled in. While it put a stop to the super hot sun, it was an unwelcome change as we were not dressed for such a drop in temperature and rise in dirtiness. A wet film covered us. It was gross.\n\nAnd that final set was uncomfortable. Let me explain.\n\nIt felt like I was seeing a contrived, forced event. It also felt mildly exploitative.\n\nIt started out well. Brandi Carlile -who has become the captain of the festival in recent years- played her own short set, and it was great. She then told the crowd to hold tight for the set to follow.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, Carlile returned to the stage, in front of a living room set of chairs, sofas and tables. She explained that since 2018, she's been invited to Joni Mitchell’s house in Laurel Canyon to perform songs with other artists while Joni holds court. It was a nervous affair for all the invitees and until 2022, it was sort of a secret society. Brandi and the festival decided it was a good idea to fly Joni out to Newport to recreate what happens in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nWell, I don't think that was a good idea.\n\nOn February 25, the world got a new album by Tears For Fears. The Tipping Point is the band’s seventh studio album, and not surprisingly, it is very good.\n\nTears For Fears don't have a single poor album. My favorite TFF albums continue to be The Hurting (1983) and Elemental (1993). I also defend Everybody Loves A Happy Ending (2004), with its powerful Brian Wilson style production. I knew Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, our boys from Bath, wouldn't come back with a studio album unless they had something important to say. I didn’t realize that they have been actively playing shows since 2004. They stepped-up their live shows and set list for a lot of outdoor, warm weather UK shows in the years before the pandemic. Both Curt and Roland have personal things to air out on this possible final album. There are some beautiful moments on The Tipping Point, and I would rank it along with Sowing The Seeds Of Love (1989) and Raoul And The Kings Of Spain (1995) as a solid, contemplative TFF album.\n\nIn 1990, I read stories saying that these guys were done. Curt wanted out of the band before the Seeds Of Love tour even began. But here we are 31 years later with 4 more albums, bringing the total to 7. Seeing the TFF songbook expand to nearly 100 songs is a great achievement. Not bad for two men who were seen as more sensitive and sadder than their contemporaries Duran Duran, XTC, The Psychedelic Furs, Talk Talk and Simple Minds, who filled arenas with their thoughtful, romantic pop.\n\nI wasn’t going to do a ranked list. This is not a music blog. I don’t do rankings. But screw it! Let’s do this!\n\nHere are all 7 Tears For Fears studio albums, ranked how I, Mister Sterling, see them.\n\nOh, but first! Something has to be acknowledged. A lot of their material is inspired by the late American psychologist, Arthur Janov, specifically his book, The Primal Scream and his development of primal therapy. Considering that Dr. Janov became a bit of a celebrity psychologist to famous people like John Lennon, I have a theory as well. I don’t think highly of Freudian theory, and primal theory was a revival of that. But I acknowledge that in the 1970s and 1980s, that second look at Freud helped inspire some good art and art criticism. I had a professor who made me view Italian Neorealism through a Freudian lens, and it proved to add a layer of entertainment and discussion, and very little else.\n\nSince Roland Orzabal has written songs either adjacent to or inspired by The Primal Scream, we can conclude that the book had a profound influence on his life. The Primal Scream inspired the band’s name, and most of the tracks on their debut album. (Interestingly it didn’t inspire Shout - that’s just a good protest song).\n\nI notice two things. First, we all go through phases of being influenced by media (the smart among us, anyway). The Primal Scream is the big bang that gave us Tears For Fears, but it didn’t remain the inspiration for their songs after their first two albums. Second, flawed inspiration or not, it set the tone for Tears For Fears as an emotionally-charged band. Some of their songs make me and millions of others cry. These boys broke from the chains of English society in which young men are seen and not heard (and girls fare even worse, of course). These boys were going to put their feelings out there. They presented themselves as university students in sweaters (“jumpers” as the British call them). Visually they looked like conformists, but they were anything but. They were and remain understated, sensitive rebels, much like their contemporary from Manchester, Morrissey. And well, isn’t that very English?\n\n7. The Tipping Point (2022)\n\nWait, didn’t I just say that The Tipping Point is very good? It is. It’s also the album in the band’s discography I don’t see myself going back to often. Like I wrote above, Roland and Curt wouldn’t record new songs unless they had something important to say. Tears For Fears is a project that juxtaposes memorable well crafted music with serious, sometimes depressing subject matter. As usual, it’s Roland who has the most to share, as he is the primary lyricist on all TFF albums. On Tipping Point, he brings at least three (and arguably four) songs about his late wife, Caroline, to whom he was married for nearly 35 years.\n\nThere is not a bad song on this, or any Tears For Fears album. That can be a problem if you are trying to rank them. But The Tipping Point is mainly a personal affair. Roland has important things he wants to air out. Rivers Of Mercy and Please Be Happy form the emotional core of this album. I think Rivers Of Mercy is fantastic.\n\nThe pair have said that there were more songs recorded with up and coming producers dating back to 2019 or so, but Roland and Curt rejected most of them. I’d be curious to know how those sounded. Maybe they have some remnants that can go into an eighth album. They are not done yet.\n\n6. The Seeds Of Love (1989)\n\nThis album has two great songs: Woman In Chains and Advice For The Young At Heart. But I rank it low, because again. when I judge a discography this strong, some good albums aren’t going to make my top three.\n\nIn August 1989 this album’s lead single blazed across FM radio stations and on MTV. The band’s third studio album belongs to a shortlist of albums that were made to show off the CD format. Albums like Brothers in Arms and So were big sellers in the relatively new format, as was Songs From The Big Chair and this album.\n\nEven though the production of this album was aimed for pristine CD sound, every album by Tears for Fears is under 51 minutes. This allows all of their albums to be pressed on a standard, two sided vinyl LP. And The Seeds Of Love was arranged with this in mind. It has four songs on each side, with side B being the less commercial side. But make no mistake, this whole album is a blend of two styles of pop. First, it is a Brian Wilson-inspired sound that brings Tears For Fears close to the sound of The Beatles, The Beach Boys and XTC (who had their sonically bright album Oranges And Lemons that same year).\n\nBut, second, let’s tackle the core of this album. This is the band’s ‘quiet storm’ album. Side B has moments that sound like Sade (her band, which is also called Sade). There are also elements soul, such as the self deprecating Bad Man’s Song on Side A. That piece was inspired by Orzabal overhearing tour crew members speaking very negatively of him.\n\nThe Seeds Of Love has a magnificent soundstage. You want to play this on a high end home system, through wood and Kevlar speakers that themselves recreate the big stage. The album sounds like a live performance.\n\nIt has to be said that Side A is just about perfect. Tears For Fears being the downers that they are, the album begins with Woman In Chains, which is one of their very best tracks. It was the second single from the album. Phil Collins delivers a restrained performance on drums and the song introduces the world to the voice of Oleta Adams. I know exactly where I was in my life when I first saw this video on MTV in November 1989.\n\nThe production of Seeds Of Love cost more than twice what the boys expected. They went through three producers, including their friend Chris Hughes, who had produced Songs From The Big Chair. In the end they re-recorded the album themselves, self-produced in their own studio. The final cost was over £1 Million. In today’s dollars, that’s over £2.5 Million. You can hear the money.\n\n5. Everyone Loves A Happy Ending (2004)\n\nThis is the previous time Roland and Curt got together in the studio to make a final statement. That’s now 18 years ago, and a new final statement is available for the world to listen. In a way, this album a direct sequel to The Seeds Of Love, thanks to its wonderful, lush production inspired by Brian Wilson and The Beatles. Perhaps Roland decided to make a bright pop album to celebrate the return of Curt. Or maybe he thought that The Seeds Of Love deserved a sequel. But, as we shall see, he took Tears For Fears to exciting new places with the two albums he led on his own. This album was a return to a 1960s sound, but my no means a regression.\n\nI think most fans like this album, but don’t love it. I myself haven’t memorized the title of every song. But what I do know is that it is a more complete album than The Seeds Of Love. The themes and musical styles come together better, and it’s more consistent. It was made under the assumption that it could be their last studio album (hence, the “ending.”). Roland was tired of label executives asking him to reunite with Curt. Over the years, they continued to meet with their lawyers and accountants for business reasons, like signing legal papers, and reviewing royalties and revenue sharing. Eventually, they started talking to each other, and the musical partnership resumed, and that’s the happy ending the label and fans wanted.\n\nOrzabal stuck with producer Tim Palmer, making this their third consecutive Tears For Fears album together. This means that Curt was rejoining a band that changed its studio and production team two years after he left it.\n\nI remember spinning the CD the day it was released, and it was a tense listen. I didn’t want one of my favorite bands to release a poor album when they didn’t have to release an album at all. The music critics at the time were fawning over The White Stripes and Interpol. Tears For Fears could have just done a greatest hits tour. But they gave us a new album that was better than The Seeds Of Love. The backing personnel had changed since 1989, but Roland and Curt continued to mature and grow as artists.\n\nThis album demands a full play, start to finish. It features bright songs that evoke movement, and feature a lot of guitar and drums. For example, I really like Killing With Kindness. I’m sure the boys like Thomas Dolby, but Killing With Kindness includes the line, “Don’t blind them with science.” I get a kick out of that reference to a fellow New Wave artist.\n\nOh, this album ends with a reprise of a song that appears earlier on the album - Los reyes Católicos. What was that I said about filler and artists highlighting their own work? Still fine. I rank this album high for having a huge heart.\n\n3. Elemental (1993)\n\nElemental continues to stun me as a near perfect pop album. This is also the album that made me a Tears For Fears fan, after 8 years resisting them. I was working as an unpaid intern at WBCN radio in Boston when this album came out. Of the six or so DJs who worked the classic late 80s/early 90s rotation at that station, one of them, Mark Parenteau, recommended the new Tears For Fears album more than once on-air. Tears For Fears had no chance of being played on WBCN in 1993. Songs in heavy rotation during my first few weeks at the station included Pets, Creep, the other Creep, Plush, and No Rain. But by the end of that summer, the two new CDs I wanted to bring with me for my third year at University were Robert Plant’s Fate Of Nations, and this one (oh, and Songs Of Faith And Devotion by Depeche Mode!).\n\nWhat makes Elemental a triumph? Roland Orzabal took full control. He wasn’t going to bend to trends or what was hot in pop music in 1992. He was going to ignore techno, trance and grunge. He knew the new album would struggle to go gold (which it did). He knew MTV wasn’t going to play any videos. And he knew that it was too soon for people to want to hear his songs from the 1980s (except, apparently, the audience in Bogotá, which depressed him). So he assembled an all new band and production team, led by Alan Griffiths and Tim Palmer. The latter mixed Pearl Jam’s debut album and became a fine producer himself starting with Elemental.\n\nThis album has peaks and valleys. It takes us somewhere. It has payoffs. I won’t link to every track, but anyone who likes Tears For Fears who has never listened to this album needs to sit down and give it a chance. It’s every bit as good as the albums that follow it in my ranking. This is the Tears For Fears podium -the top three.\n\nThe first three songs set the tone. This is the new Tears For Fears, and it’s on these tracks you clearly notice Curt is not there. But Roland’s electric guitars are back for the first time since Songs From The Big Chair.\n\nRecorded in 1982 and released in 1983, The Hurting is a snapshot of two young men and their nation in a particularly bleak moment in time. It is the time of Thatcherism, a made-up word with a very real history behind it. It’s the history of austerity being sold to people as an improvement over a previous political regime. But the austerity actually brought more sadness and social destruction. This is the backdrop of The Hurting.\n\nAt the age of 20 or 21, living in a flat above a pizzeria, probably lying on his bed or sofa, an unemployed Roland Orbazal wrote these extraordinary lyrics while watching people walk and drive by.\n\nAll around me are familiar faces\n\nWorn out places, worn out faces\n\nBright and early for the daily races\n\nGoing nowhere, going nowhere\n\nTheir tears are filling up their glasses\n\nNo expression, no expression\n\nHide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow\n\nNo tomorrow, no tomorrow\n\nAnd I find it kind of funny\n\nI find it kind of sad\n\nThe dreams in which I'm dying\n\nAre the best I've ever had\n\nI find it hard to tell you\n\nI find it hard to take\n\nWhen people run in circles it's a very, very\n\nMad world, mad world\n\nChildren waiting for the day they feel good\n\nHappy birthday, happy birthday\n\nAnd I feel the way that every child should\n\nSit and listen, sit and listen\n\nWent to school and I was very nervous\n\nNo one knew me, no one knew me\n\nHello, teacher! Tell me, what's my lesson?\n\nLook right through me, look right through me\n\nAnd I find it kind of funny\n\nI find it kind of sad\n\nThe dreams in which I'm dying\n\nAre the best I've ever had\n\nI find it hard to tell you\n\nI find it hard to take\n\nWhen people run in circles it's a very, very\n\nMad world, mad world\n\nEnlarging your world\n\nMad world\n\nThis is their first single. Curt sang the vocals. They had low expectations. Mercury, the record label, had low expectations. At least the label hired Depeche Mode’s director to shoot the music video. This song went to to number three on the UK pop chart on Halloween, 1982! Number three! And it stayed there for three weeks, not far from smash hits like Pass The Dutchie, and Do You Really Want To Hurt Me (both of which went to number one!). A note about those: New Wave included some reggae and both of those chart toppers are reggae songs. Eddie Grant’s Electric Avenue would be released just weeks later.\n\nMercury Records wanted more from this band, and fast. They knew Roland was developing a new song called Head Over Heels, but it wasn’t ready. And while the label pressured Roland and Curt to have a second album ready for 1984, they got the boys to release a cut track, The Way You Are, to hold fans over while Songs From The Big Chair was being developed. They toured. They took extra months to make their masterpiece. And then they toured again. No wonder they were too exhausted to play Live Aid on a day off in their summer 1985 tour.\n\n1. Songs From The Big Chair (1985)\n\nI didn’t want this to be my number one. Nope. I really wanted to put The Hurting here.\n\nHowever, I gave Songs From The Big Chair two full listens for this blog post. I had never listened to this album twice in a day, and I hadn’t played it in probably 12 years, because I feel it is their best known and most overplayed work. But after serious listens, I have a new judgement of this album. I heard things I hadn’t noticed nor appreciated before. Things like the Fairlight CMI in Shout. Sure I have heard the song dozens of times, but hearing it in 2022 let me think back and connect the dots. I first heard the Fairlight CMI on Peter Gabriel’s Security Album in 1982, and then Herbie Hancock’s Rockit album in 1983. By 1984, it was everywhere, even in hair metal. Phil Collins even dissed it. But you know what? The Farlight rules. Shout is also one of the few protest songs to chart in the 1980s.\n\nOnce they get that out of the way, what’s the second song? The Working Hour, which is 6 and a half minutes. Roland is so proud of this song, he still includes it in live set lists and almost named the album after it. Listen to that production and big budget mix. Remind you of another artist? Here’s a hint: he’s also from Bath. Yes, this is a very Peter Gabriel song for me. It’s like a cousin of Red Rain, with its grand piano and wide stereo sound (but Gabriel liked the Yamaha and Roland piano synths, right?). Jerry Marotta plays both drums and keyboards on The Working Hour. Perhaps just weeks after this album was released, Marotta would lay down the drum tracks for Red Rain (with Stewart Copeland performing the cymbals and high hat). This album makes the case for greatness with just its second track.\n\nHead Over Heels is the first love song Tears For Fears put on a record. It’s their wonderfully awkward love song. \"Something happens\" is passive voice. The songwriting here is genius. This describes anxiety, fear and a little anger all so well and efficiently. It's the love song for people who aren't players nor have any game. And it opens with chords that are instantly recognizable, just like Everybody Wants To Rule The World.\n\nThe final track is Listen. It’s mostly instrumental, and it dabs in World Music, but not the great way Peter Gabriel does it. If we knew this would be the final Tears For Fears album, it would go down as a weak final studio track. Roland Orzabal arranges the tracks. He knows how to pick them. Six of their seven albums close with really strong, fitting songs. The weakest closer, in my opinion is Listen. But can anyone complain after 8 songs -6 of them phenomenal- in just 41 minutes? Take your prize, Tears For Fears. This album is your masterpiece. It was produced by Chris Hughes, Adam Ant’s drummer. All synthesizers, programming, sequencing, and the Fairlight CMI were manned by Ian Stanley. Aside from Roland’s vocals and guitar, he IS this record, and he’s the guy in the Head Over Heels Video who’s got game.\n\nAnd this incredible album almost didn’t happen. Their label wanted this sophomore album released in 1984, hot on the heels of their great debut and first tour. But the boys would not rush things. They spent nearly all their money renovating a Grade II listed 16th century building, called The Wool Hall, converting it into their recording studio. Thus they made a studio that suited them, their sound, and their work pace.\n\nThey released Songs From The Big Chair when it was ready.\n\nThat too describes their fellow Bath native, Peter Gabriel. The world is still waiting for him to release his tenth and final studio album (it will probably never come). And this album set the standard for all Tears For Fears albums that followed. Roland Orbazal is the creative director, and he decides when a project is done.\n\nAre they done? Not this year. They start a US and UK tour this spring.\n\nFor years and years I thought 10,000 Days was weak. I've been a Tool fan since a friend forced me to listen to Opiate and Undertow in early 1994 at a snowbound U Mass. Each new album has arrived at a different stage in my life. But I was an idiot, an absolute idiot, for not loving 10,000 Days on the first listen.\n\nMy expectations for the album were low after the deafening, apocalyptic masterpiece of Lateralus. What on earth made me think that Lateralus would be as high as this band could get? Well, that was my very strange bias. And my bias that 10,000 Days would be a mild disappointment is the reason I didn't spin the album on my Yamaha CD player and Bowers & Wilkens speakers at home. I either ripped the CD to MP3 or copied the CD to MiniDisc and listened to the album, just once, on the NYC subway for an 80 minute ride. Seriously, I listed to it once in late April 2006, shrugged and thought, \"It's okay, but I don't hear anything close to Parabola,\" and then filed the CD into my cabinet of 4,000 discs.\n\nFear Inoculum made me appreciate just how great Danny Carey has become. He's my second best active rock drummer after Gavin Harrison. The pandemic era let me finally collect and appreciate Puscifer's discography (as well as their two streaming specials during this pandemic). And then finally, just this past summer, I spun 10,000 Days, properly, at home. It was a revelation. It's their peak. It's MJK's peak vocal performance, for sure - as strong as his work on the first A Perfect Circle album 7 years earlier. The lyrics are clever. The band performance is incredible. This is the recording in which Carey shows us that he is a master percussionist. The mixing and mastering couldn't be more perfect. In terms of themes and track order, it is a very complete album, up there or better than Ænima and Undertow when played start to finish. And then there's the energy. Compared for Fear Inoculum, the boys sound more than 20 years younger.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, this progressive rock / metal fan finally listened to 10,000 Days and I now agree that it is their second best album. I now feel like a Radiohead fan who stands by The King Of Limbs or In Rainbows as their best, but I've made my choice. 10,000 Days is a continuation of Tool's peak, which began with Lateralus. And their decades-long run of great albums and epic live shows continues.\n\nIf only it was that simple. Thankfully, plenty of people still understand that economics is adjacent to history as a field of study. Some might argue that they are inseparable. How could you describe the rise or decline of an empire or nation without addressing its economy?\n\nThe Roaring Twenties, like any economic boom, was brought about by a variety of factors. We had a continued immigration surge (immigration surges almost always lead to economic growth), widespread electrification, the rise of corporations, the dawn of the modern consumer culture, the rise of the US labor movement, and American culture began to define itself.\n\nA note on the last part: popular culture came of age. The rise of the music recording industry and radio went hand in hand, and great American music genres like blues, bluegrass and jazz were the main beneficiaries. Also, it has to be said that American culture is black. We can give white men some credit for the original American spirits. applejack and bourbon (although black people have been involved with those from the start in one form or another). But blues, bluegrass, jazz, barbecue cuisine, and (later) rock n’ roll, R&B, soul, funk, hip hop and rap are distinctly American and all black. And in the 1920s, only a lucky few black men and women could get a taste -a tiny serving- of prosperity and freedom that came with being an accomplished music artist. Later, some black artists would find more freedom in Paris, especially after the Tulsa race massacre in 1921. Let’s be clear. American culture is driven by black American culture. But black people are not allowed to be prosperous or be free. Still.\n\nOn the economic side of things, there really was a sea change. Publicly-traded corporations became powerful in the 1920s. But so did a new labor movement, which led to the standard five-day work week. The 1920s gave us weekends, right before the stock market crash and depression. And incredibly, the depression didn’t take our weekends away. Consumers in the late 19th century would often have to buy goods at a general store, and occasionally order products from a catalog (like a proto-Internet). In the 1920s, consumers still used mail order, but more of what they wanted was immediately available in bigger grocery stores and brightly-lit department stores. The American consumer themes of bigger faster and more had come of age. Automobiles were beginning to be owned by every family. Travelling from coast to coast was now possible in 4-5 days by train. The United States was starting to flex its industrial and technological muscle.\n\nWe still have a few intelligent people who know that history won’t be repeated simply because a pandemic is ending. Assuming we are just a few months away from this pandemic bing downgraded to an endemic, there can’t be a long-term surge in prosperity after what we’ve just seen in 2020. There are a few reasons for this.\n\nFirst, last year was a windfall for the billionaires. The wealth transfer in 2020 alone was shocking, even compared to the overall wealth transfer over the last 40 years. Some individuals just ran away with all the wealth. Kanye West (!) entered the billionaire club. And four of the wealthiest Americans alive saw their net worth grow by a combined $229 Billion. There is no catching up for the rest of humanity. This bigger wealth gap simply sets the stage for stagnant wealth creation for the global middle class, and the greater probability of political and social turmoil over wealth inequality. We can’t have a roaring 2020s if the only ones partying are 5,000 US families with a net worth over $100 Million. That’s a wealth gap on the scale of the Philippines, Russia or Brazil.\n\nSecond, there doesn’t appear to be a technological revolution to supercharge wealth creation. Autonomous driving isn’t it. Machine learning (marketed as AI) isn’t it. Billionaires buying tickets to low Earth orbit or the Moon isn’t it. Even the vaccines and biotech, as amazing as they are, aren’t it. Free broadband Internet access for all would be significant. But most municipalities aren’t on-board with that idea. Either that or they’re broke.\n\nThird, did I mention we’re broke? We aren’t rebuilding infrastructure. We’re letting municipal water systems fail and die. We aren’t putting money into the hands of builders. We aren’t making public university free of charge. We aren’t forgiving college debt. We aren’t expanding Medicare for all. We aren’t even trying to house the homeless. And where is our shift to clean, renewable energy? What moon shot do we have in us to kick-start a decade of strong economic growth?\n\nFourth, American manufacturing will never disappear, but the days of a healthy manufacturing sector are long gone. Manufacturing jobs have been replaced by Amazon warehouse and gig delivery jobs that pay a fraction of what the manufacturing jobs paid. Millions of Americans are working just as hard for less, and half of all Americans are poor. We’re going into to 2020s with the poverty, wealth gap and despair of the Great Depression.\n\nFifth, after the partial recovery of the travel, live entertainment, hospitality and dining sectors, we will still have a black hole in commercial real estate, as many workers are not returning to office spaces full-time. Working from home is now the norm for many, especially in information technology and information security. Some companies are learning to trust their remote workers to maintain their productivity, and are ending their leases for office space. A lot of commercial office space is going to have to convert to residential apartment space. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of buildings, did anyone notice how many vacant retail spaces there were in cities like New York and San Francisco back when the economy was growing? Brick and mortar retail is dead. All the cash is flowing to Amazon.\n\nIn sum, I just don’t see years of strong economic growth ahead. A return to the slow growth seen under Obama and Trump would be welcome. But long term, we are still in late capitalism. And man, does it suck. It’s a dystopian capitalist nightmare, frankly.\n\nI got guns, hoes, money, dro\n\nCars, boats, you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa\n\nYou name it\n\nGuns, hoes, money, dro\n\nCars, boats, you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa\n\nYou name it\n\nI’m throwing money off balcony into the crowd because I want to\n\nGod damn I feel good\n\nSure that you already know\n\nOne things understood\n\nAin’t nothin that can stop my glow\n\nMmm dog gonit\n\nCan’t I just take my time?\n\nAll these clout chasing motherfuckers rushin all around me I’m like\n\nBitch hold your horses\n\n(Prof you’re the best)\n\nI’m like true I am\n\nRosario Dawson know who I am\n\nIf it’s cool with you, girl I could move right in\n\nYou do not understand just how cool I am\n\nLike see, look at me, look at me\n\nI’m on a beach\n\nDon’t try to holler cause I’m out of reach\n\nI got no service, I’m out on the keys\n\nA couple woman\n\nMy dollars and me\n\nBout to go swimming\n\nThank god I’m a G\n\nOne shot for me\n\nUn bebidas para ti\n\nLet’s skinny dip in the sea\n\n(You know what I’m saying\n\nI’d rather do things we remember later\n\nYou know what I mean?)\n\nI got guns, hoes, money, dro\n\nCars, boats, you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa\n\nYou name it\n\nGuns, hoes, money, dro\n\nCars, boats, you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa\n\nYou name it\n\nI’m throwing money off balcony into the crowd because I want to\n\nOooh, seriously, look at myself\n\nCondom model over here\n\nOooh, seriously, look at my flow\n\nColder than a polar bear\n\nOooh, straight up I’m an awesome person\n\nOooh, you ain’t ready for this sauce I’m serving\n\nOooh, straight up, I’m an awesome person\n\nOooh, you ain’t ready for the sauuuce\n\nYoung Pookie, your highness\n\nGone find the finest vaginas\n\nFrom China to Thailand\n\nGot ‘em whinin\n\nWhy not combine ‘em?\n\nPardon me let me chime in\n\nBut there’s science behind my conniving\n\nI’m refined and violent\n\nThrow the lime in, fine dine the hyman\n\nSwag\n\nSwag\n\n(aaahh)\n\nI got guns, hoes, money, dro\n\nCars, boats, you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa\n\nYou name it\n\nGuns, hoes, money, dro\n\nCars, boats, you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa\n\nYou name it\n\nI’m throwing money off balcony into the crowd because I want to\n\n(Hey)\n\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up\n\n(Hey)\n\nSwear to god, if you could throw it at me that I’ll grab it and fuck it up\n\n(Hey)\n\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up\n\n(Hey)\n\nSwear to god, if you could throw it at me that I’ll grab it and fuck it up\n\nOooh, how bout that drink\n\nYou gonna finish that?\n\nIf your bro talking shit I’m gon’ get his ass\n\nI got two hands that gon’ fit his ass\n\nKnock him out cold, he gon’ shit his ass\n\nTalk on the phones up in Trinidad\n\nBout to make films up on SkinaMax\n\nOh you just jealous because my bedroom sounds like\n\nIt’s a fucking womens tennis match\n\n(aaahh)\n\nI feel good\n\n(ooohh-ahhh)\n\nI feel good\n\n(Yeah)\n\nI feel good\n\n(ooohh-ahhh)\n\nI feel good\n\n(Alright, yeah, alright)\n\n(I feel good)\n\nI got guns, hoes, money, dro\n\n(Feel good)\n\nCars, boats, (oooh I feel good) you should know\n\nDogs, bros, squad goals\n\nHold up, whoa (heyyy)\n\nWe can never go home\n\nWe no longer have one\n\nI'll help you carry the load\n\nI'll carry you in my arms\n\nThe kiss of the snow\n\nThe crescent moon above us\n\nOur blood is cold\n\nAnd we're alone\n\nBut I'm alone with you\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nWe will keep it alight together\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nIt will light our way forever\n\nIf I say shut your eyes\n\nIf I say look away\n\nBury your face in my shoulder\n\nThink of a birthday\n\nThe things you put in your head\n\nThey will stay here forever\n\nOur blood is cold\n\nAnd we're alone, love\n\nBut I'm alone with you\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nWe will keep it alight together\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nIt will light our way forever\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nWe will keep it alight together\n\nNow help me to carry the fire\n\nIt will light up our way forever\n\nIf I say shut your eyes\n\nIf I say shut your eyes\n\nBury me in suprise\n\nWhere I say shut your eyes\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nWe will keep it alight together\n\nHelp me carry the fire\n\nIt will light our way forever\n\nThe band never formally recorded the song as it was originally written, with lyrics inspired by the premise of The Road. They started playing the original version live in 2010 and finally recorded it in 2017. But the world has changed quite a bit from 2010. And hearing this song for the first time in March 2018, I interpreted it as a song for a world with a broken EU and a US being driven into the ground by Donald Trump's GOP. It's a song for our Theresa May and Donald Trump apocalypse. Lyrics are below the video.\n\nWe can never go home\n\nWe no longer have one\n\nI'll help you carry the load\n\nI'll carry you in my arms\n\nWe walk through the ash\n\nAnd the charred remains of our country\n\nKeep an eye on my back\n\nI'll keep an eye on the road\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nTo keep it alight together\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nThis road won't go on forever\n\nIf I say shut your eyes\n\nIf I say look away\n\nBury your face in my shoulder\n\nThink of a birthday\n\nThe things you put in your head\n\nThey will stay there forever\n\nI'm trying hard to hide your soul, son\n\nFrom things it's not meant to see\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nTo keep it alight together\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nThis road won't go on forever\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nTo keep it alight together\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nThis road won't go on forever\n\nIf I say shut your eyes\n\nIf I say shut your eyes\n\nBury me in surprise\n\nWhen I say shut your eyes, eyes\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nTo keep it alight together\n\nHelp me to carry the fire\n\nThis road won't go on forever\n\n30 years ago today, we got The Joshua Tree. A front-heavy rock album. Not as consistently great as The Unforgettable Fire (1984). But it was the commercial peak U2 fans knew they were capable of. Suddenly, I was not alone in choosing U2 on the jukebox in my favorite pizza joints in Brockton, Massachsusetts. I was in my final weeks in junior high, surrounded by kids who loved Bon Jovi and Motley Crue, and they HATED U2. Come September, I was in a high school where if you didn't love U2, you were considered way out of touch. You could love R.E.M. You could secretly listen to New Order or Depeche Mode. Or you could be so far ahead of the curve like me and own three Pixies albums by 1989. But if you didn't express your love of U2, you were an automatic outsider.\n\nNow the album itself does not move me like the next three U2 albums did. I still think Achtung Baby is their best masterpiece. But there are very few rock albums that open as strongly as The Joshua Tree. We're talking Led Zepplin IV or Back In Black-caliber openings. Where The Streets Have No Name is a soaring opening - peak classic U2. I Still haven't Found What I'm Looking For is this emotional gospel rock anthem. And despite its basic four bars, and resemblance to another Eno-produced four-bar classic, Once In A Lifetime, With Or Without You is still, still a great song thanks to the lyrics and Edge's galloping riffs. Then they follow that up with Bullet The Blue Sky, the leftist, violent song about Reagan's proxy wars, among other things. And then, THEN, U2 give us another anthem - the major-keyed song about heroin addiction, Running To Stand Still. Holy shit, this album. 30 years, kids.\n\nGuns N' Roses returned to New York City for the first time in two years for a three show \"residency,\" that coincided with the year's first Fashion Week. This latest GNR tour, which celebrates 25 years since the band's major label breakthrough (with Appetite for Destruction), has critics nationwide agreeing that it is the band's best outing since Slash left the band 16 years ago. It is also the band's best lineup since that time, as it seems that positive chemistry and fun is back in the band. Axl's current band is so good, in fact, they seem capable of producing a quality album if they committed to the project. And it is this lineup that will probably take the podium when the band is inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame this April.\n\nOn Friday February 10th, they rocked Roseland Ballroom with a three hour set.\n\nOn Sunday February 12th, they stepped up their game at Terminal 5.\n\nAnd on Wednesday February 15th, they returned to Webster Hall for the first time in nearly 24 years (23 years, 10 months to be exact), when they took the Appetite for Destruction tour to the venue then known as The Ritz. The Webster Hall show lived up to its high ticket price as a once in a lifetime chance to see the band perform a four hour show, which added five songs to the Terminal 5 setlist, including You're Crazy, Civil War, and My Michelle.\n\nI attended the second show, at Terminal 5 in Hell's Kitchen. Below is the review I originally sent out to friends the next morning.\n\nThe concert was a bit surreal. We never thought we'd see Guns N Roses live (they virtually broke up in 1996, but Axl never let the band die). Only Dizzy Reed on piano has stayed with Axl since the glory days. I do have to say, the rest of the band is immensely talented. They have four 6 string guitarists replacing the original two (three power guitarists and a backup/tech backstage who got credit), and the solos were Rock God quality, I think. Slash's late replacement, DJ Ashba (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Ashba ) worshiped Motley Crue as a teenager and his distorted Les Paul guitar seemed to fill in for Slash perfectly.\n\nAxl is not fat. He's still fit. But his face is bigger and shows signs of botox work. His blue eyes are electric. And he has become quite a good piano player. Twenty years ago, he would lay down some riffs in a ballad. Now he can play jazz and blues on the keys. We were impressed. And yes, he played on a baldwin baby grand.\n\nWe had to freeze outside of Terminal 5 on West 56th Street from about 9pm to 9:40. Once inside, we took our places on the main floor as the balconies had filled up. But the floor was the place to be. The show was sold out with a crowd of 3,000.\n\nA subpar hard rock band called the Chelsea Smiles opened the show shortly after 10pm. Now that I think about it, a more appropriate band would have been Powerman 5000 (led by Rob Zombie's brother), or the Dutch 1960s style band, The Hives. But we take what we're given. And the uninspired 6 songs served by the Chelsea Smiles were forgettable.\n\nGuns N Roses took the stage at 11:40, and played pretty much straight with minor breaks until at least 2:30. Yes, a three hour epic. Did I mention we were impressed? Here is the set list:\n\n00 - Intro [Recorded music: Dexter]\n\n01 - Chinese Democracy (they opened with Jungle two nights prior, and we were puzzled by this selection)\n\n02 - Welcome to the Jungle (it was 1988 all over again)\n\n03 - It's So Easy\n\n04 - Mr Brownstone (highlight of the show's first half)\n\n05 - Sorry (At this point, the computer generated video behind the band was replaced by Karaoke style live action videos, featuring suicidal teenagers, Sunset Strip pole dancers, and Formula One footage from the early 2000s (for You Could Be Mine). So....cheesy? Rush invests six figures into their graphics, man! \"That's not Tom Sawyer, that's Huckleberry Finn, stupid!!\"\n\n06 - Rocket Queen\n\n07 - Estranged\n\n08 - Richard Fortus guitar solo (who resembles Adrian Brody a bit) - James Bond Theme (which was spectacular)\n\n09 - Live and Let Die\n\n10 - Instrumental Jam - A reprise of ZZ Top's La Grange\n\n11 - This I Love\n\n12 - What's Your Motivation (led and sung by bassist Tommy Stinson, who resembles a young Rod Stewart, who can play bass very well, but unfortunately can't sing.) UPDATE 01/08/2020: I was mistaken. Tommy Stinson is a damn legend, as he was the bassist for The Replacements and has grown into a decent frontman in his own band. I saw him and his band open for the Psychedelic Furs in 2017.\n\n13 - Dizzy Reed piano solo - The Who's Baba O'Riely, possibly the first hard rock hit single in 1971, the crowd should have sung every line, but most were too young to know the lyrics, or too stoned to care\n\n14 - Street of Dreams\n\n15 - You Could Be Mine (which they did not play Friday night, one of the reasons this show was so long)\n\n16 - DJ Ashba guitar solo - The Ballad of Death\n\n17 - Sweet Child O' Mine (THE highlight of the show - Axl briefly swaying his hips to \"Where do we go now\")\n\n18 - Moving the baby grand to the stage, the band plays Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall, and Axl sings the chorus once he is able to sit at the piano, which led to the most abrupt transition of the night -\n\n19 - Axl Rose piano solo - a bluesy medley of Gran Torino and Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\n\n20 - November Rain (of course)\n\n21 - Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal guitar solo - The Pink Panther Theme (yes, and it was very 60s psychedelic and loud - good, unorthodox choice)\n\n22 - Knockin' on Heaven's Door (great, even as Axl's wireless microphones began to fail him)"
