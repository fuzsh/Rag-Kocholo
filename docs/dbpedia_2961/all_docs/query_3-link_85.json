        "text": "After the demise of the Original Mirrors Perkins signed a management contract with Checkmount,\n\na Scottish Management Company lead by Mick Rossi (whom he had met whilst supporting Roxy Music\n\nwith the Original Mirrors), Tommy Crossan and Harry Maguire.\n\n“Mick Rossi is a unique person, a one – off, a passionate man of Italian and Scottish parentage.\n\nHe could hold an audience (of even record company execs and musicians) spellbound by his oratory\n\nand humour. We worked together for twelve “happy years” it was a gas, a white knuckle ride.\n\n(Perkins 2005)\n\nPerkins started writing and recording nocturnal demos for his publisher (Peter Reichardt)\n\nWarner Brothers at Screaming Lord Sutch’s studio “Third Party Fire and Theft” in Notting\n\nHill (during the period of civil unrest, 81-82?).\n\nEngineered by Nick Pyall and Kieran and Brendan Walsh, Perkins worked with\n\nGlen Matlock (Sex Pistols), Danny Kustow (Tom Robinson Band), Pete Thomas (The Attractions),\n\nKevin Wilkinson and Anhony from the Water boys, Phil Spalding and Steve Allen\n\n(from the O. Mirrors) Perkins wrote prolifically and recorded as often as possible.\n\nPerkins publisher arranged a cover of his song “We all work out” by the black vocal group\n\nBeggar and Co, this hit the lower end of the charts.\n\nPerkins sent demos to RCA and was signed by Jack Stevens in 1983.\n\nReleasing “I’ll Lay My Silver Spurs She’s Wrong” EP in 1983, produced by Reggae\n\nProducer Godwin Logi at Island Studios, London.\n\n“Extraordinary and seminal”. (TIME OUT. 1983)\n\n“He’s one of the hottest properties around and he’s definitely our tip for the top”\n\n(Look Now Magazine)\n\nPerkins gigged with his Band “The Silver Spurs” playing various gigs in and out of London\n\nand supported Toyah on a British Tour;\n\n“Perkins has got more outrage in his soul than Iggy Pop and Lou Reed could ever muster on\n\nstage” (Toyah)\n\nand as guests of “The Police” at Wembley Stadium and Brighton, Christmas 1983.\n\n“Perkins cranks his Spurs into a blood - curdling frenzy of hard – edged\n\nfunking delight. Sax man Dave Winthrop stokes the soul fire cemented with a rock steady\n\nbeat by Kevin Wilkinson. Bass man Phil Spalding lassos his rhythm section, accepts control\n\nfrom Perkins and turns the boiler full on” (Soundcheck Magazine)\n\n“Perkins and his band the Silver Spurs are special” (Sounds)\n\nPerkins and band performed live on the television programme “THE TUBE” and was featured on\n\nthe “BEST OF THE TUBE” album released in 1985. Perkins’ A+R man Jack Stephens left RCA in 1985,\n\nPerkins was dropped by RCA soon after.\n\nDuring his time at RCA Perkins became friends with label mate Kevin Mooney and his girlfriend\n\nJordan from “Wide Boy Awake” Perkins played keyboards on their recordings\n\n(including the “Billy Hyena” EP produced by Francois Kavorkin) and in the band including their\n\ndebut at the Music Machine in Camden Town (or was it the Camden Palace then?)\n\n“Kevin was a genius, his music and style was so very ahead of its time”\n\n(Perkins 2005)\n\nhe died some few years later.\n\nWhile working in Notting Hill Perkins was introduced to “socialite” and Video producer Hilary\n\nParsons and her partner the Video director Robin Parsons of Ronin Films. Hilary, Robin and\n\nPerkins began making experimental videos to accompany new songs. Philip Saville the Film\n\nDirector asked Perkins to write and perform an original song in his film “Shadey”\n\nstarring amongst others Anthony Sher. This was released in 1985.\n\n“Black Comedy at it’s best “ (The Standard)\n\n“Jonathan Played a musician in the film, I liked him a lot, he was appealing and looked good\n\nand I like the songs” (Philip Saville)\n\nPerkins resurrected the Silver Spurs and recorded a Radio 1 sessions for John Peel and\n\nJanice Long\n\n“He’s got one of the best voices around” (Janice Long)\n\nfrom which a single called “Believe in Me” was released on his managers Label Checkmount\n\ndistributed through EMI. Remixed by Nick Pyall and Perkins at Eel Pie Studios.\n\nPerkins and band performed live on ITV’s Saturday morning T.V. show “73” along with Spike\n\nMilligan. Perkins also played several London club dates.\n\nThis activity bought Perkins to the attention of Record Producer Alex Sadkin, after several\n\nmeetings Sadkin, Alex bought Perkins to Chrysalis Records in 1986. Perkins’s manager the\n\n“very dab” Mick Rossi introduced to and signed Perkins with Publisher Stuart Hornall from\n\nRondor Music around the same time.\n\nAlex wanted to record the album at his old haunt Compass Point Studios in Nassau. Where he\n\nhad worked with Bob Marley and the Wailers. The band began recording there in July 1987.\n\nThree weeks later he was tragically killed in a car Accident.\n\nPerkins, Winthrop and Alex’s engineer Will…….? survived the crash, but the album despite\n\nvaliant efforts from Alex’s friend Producer Don Gehmen (who flew out to help) did not.\n\nPerkins left Chrysalis soon after.\n\n“Alex had an inner peace and non judgemental acceptance of people rarely seen in the music\n\nIndustry, he was an \"old soul\" his serene presence, vibrations and musical ideas inspired\n\neveryone that worked or hung out with him\"\n\n(Perkins 1987)\n\nReturning to London, Solicitor and gentleman James Wylie re-introduced Perkins to Dave Stewart\n\nof the Eurythmics (also signed by Jack Stevens to RCA)\n\nAfter some meetings in London and New York. Dave signed Perkins to Anxious Records in 1988.\n\nSome of the songs originally rehearsed and recorded with Alex were at last re-recorded for\n\nDave Stewart’s Anxious Records by the survivors of that original session accompanied by\n\nFrench Producer / engineer Manu Guiot."
