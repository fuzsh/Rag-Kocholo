        "text": "Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and Portfolio, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \"Send in the Clowns\" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, \"What I Did for Love\" from A Chorus Line and \"Tomorrow\" from Annie. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Édith Piaf's \"La Vie en rose\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \"Sorry\", and \"That's the Trouble\". The album finished with \"I Need a Man\", Jones's first club hit.[46] The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for Interview.\n\nMuse was the last of Jones's disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \"I'll Find My Way to You\", which Jones released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \"Again and Again\" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \"Suffer\". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.\n\nWith anti-disco sentiment spreading, and with the aid of the Compass Point All Stars, Jones transitioned into new wave music with the 1980 release of Warm Leatherette. The album included covers of songs by The Normal (\"Warm Leatherette\"), The Pretenders (\"Private Life\"), Roxy Music (\"Love Is the Drug\"), Smokey Robinson (\"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\"), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (\"Breakdown\") and Jacques Higelin (\"Pars\"). Sly Dunbar revealed that the title track was also the first to be recorded with Jones.[50][51] Tom Petty wrote the lyrics to \"Breakdown\", and he also wrote the third verse of Jones's reinterpretation.[52] The album included one song co-written by Jones, \"A Rolling Stone\". Originally, \"Pull Up to the Bumper\" was to be included on the album, but its R&B sound did not fit with the rest of the material.[53] By 1981, she had begun collaborating with photographer and graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude, with whom she also had a relationship.[54] An extended version of \"Private Life\" was released as a single, with a cover of the Joy Division song \"She's Lost Control\", a non-album track, as the B-side.\n\nThe 1981 release of Nightclubbing included Jones's covers of songs by Flash and the Pan (\"Walking in the Rain\"), Bill Withers (\"Use Me\"), Iggy Pop/David Bowie (\"Nightclubbing\") and Ástor Piazzolla (\"I've Seen That Face Before\"). Three songs were co-written by Jones: \"Feel Up\", \"Art Groupie\" and \"Pull Up to the Bumper\". Sting wrote \"Demolition Man\"; he later recorded it with The Police on the album Ghost in the Machine. \"I've Done It Again\" was written by Marianne Faithfull. The strong rhythm featured on Nightclubbing was produced by Compass Point All Stars, including Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson and Barry Reynolds. The album entered in the Top 5 in four countries, and became Jones's highest-ranking record on the US Billboard mainstream albums and R&B charts.\n\nHaving already recorded two reggae-oriented albums under the production of Compass Point All Stars, Jones went to Nassau, Bahamas in 1982 and recorded Living My Life; the album resulted in Jones's final contribution to the Compass Point trilogy, with only one cover, Melvin Van Peebles's \"The Apple Stretching\". The rest were original songs; \"Nipple to the Bottle\" was co-written with Sly Dunbar, and, apart from \"My Jamaican Guy\", the other tracks were collaborations with Barry Reynolds. Despite receiving a limited single release, the title track was left off the album. Further session outtakes included \"Man Around the House\" (Jones, Reynolds) and a cover of \"Ring of Fire\", written by June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore and popularized by Johnny Cash, both of which were included on the 1998 compilation Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions. The album's cover art resulted from another Jones/Goude collaboration; the artwork has been described as being as famous as the music on the record.[59] It features Jones's disembodied head cut out from a photograph and pasted onto a white background. Jones's head is sharpened, giving her head and face an angular shape.[60] A piece of plaster is pasted over her left eyebrow, and her forehead is covered with drops of sweat.\n\nAfter her success with Slave to the Rhythm, Island released Island Life, Jones's first best-of compilation, which featured songs from most of her releases with Island (Portfolio, Fame, Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing, Living My Life and Slave to the Rhythm). American writer and journalist Glenn O'Brien wrote the essay for the inlay booklet. The compilation charted in the UK, New Zealand and the United States.[67] The artwork on the cover of the compilation was of another Jones/Goude collaboration; it featured Jones's celestial body in a montage of separate images, following Goude's ideas on creating credible illusions with his cut-and-paint technique. The body position is anatomically impossible.[68]\n\nAfter Slave to the Rhythm and Island Life, Jones started to record again under a new contract with Manhattan Records, which resulted in Inside Story, Jones teamed up with music producer Nile Rodgers of Chic, whom Jones had previously tried to work with during the disco era.[72] The album was recorded at Skyline Studios in New York and post-produced at Atlantic Studios and Sterling Sound. Inside Story was the first album Jones produced, which resulted in heated disputes with Rodgers. Musically, the album was more accessible than her previous albums with the Compass Point All Stars, and explored different styles of pop music, with undertones of jazz, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. All songs on the album were written by Jones and Bruce Woolley. Richard Bernstein teamed up with Jones again to provide the album's artwork. Inside Story made the top 40 in several European countries. The album was Jones's last entry to date on US Billboard 200 albums chart. The same year, Jones starred as Katrina, an Egyptian queen vampire in the vampire film Vamp. For her work in the film, Jones was awarded a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn 1987, Jones appeared in two films, Straight to Hell, and Mary Lambert's Siesta, for which Jones was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. Bulletproof Heart was released in 1989, produced by Chris Stanley, who co-wrote, and co-produced the majority of the songs, and was featured as a guest vocalist on \"Don't Cry Freedom\". Robert Clivillés and David Cole of C+C Music Factory produced some tracks on the album.\n\nIn 1990, Jones appeared as herself in the documentary, Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol. 1992 saw Jones starring as Helen Strangé, in the Eddie Murphy film Boomerang, for which she also contributed the song \"7 Day Weekend\" to its soundtrack. Jones released two more soundtrack songs in 1992; \"Evilmainya\", recorded for the film Freddie as F.R.O.7, and \"Let Joy and Innocence Prevail\" for the film Toys. In 1994, she was due to release an electro album titled Black Marilyn with artwork featuring the singer as Marilyn Monroe. \"Sex Drive\" was released as the first single in September 1993, but the album was shelved due to Jones disliking the mixes that were presented by producers, whom she felt were primarily interested in sampling and had \"minced\" her vocals. Jones stated that the experience turned her off working on music.[73] The track \"Volunteer\", recorded during the same sessions, leaked in 2009.[74] In 1995, Jones reunited with Tom Moulton for a disco-house take on Candi Staton's 1978 song \"Victim\", however, the song's release was cancelled by Island Records.[75][76]\n\nThe two ended up with 23 tracks. The album, Hurricane, included autobiographical songs, such as \"This Is\", \"Williams' Blood\" and \"I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)\", an ode to her mother Marjorie. \"Love You to Life\" was another track based on real events and \"Corporate Cannibal\" referred to corporate capitalism. \"Well Well Well\" was recorded in memory of Alex Sadkin, member of Compass Point All Stars who had died in a motor accident 1987. \"Sunset Sunrise\" was written by Jones's son, Paulo; the song ponders the relationship between mankind and mother nature. Four songs were removed from the album, \"The Key to Funky\", \"Body Phenomenon\", \"Sister Sister\" and \"Misery\". For the production of the album, Jones teamed up with Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung, and Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson, of the Compass Point All Stars, with contributions from trip-hop artist Tricky, and Brian Eno.[86]\n\nThe album was released on Wall of Sound on 3 November 2008, in the United Kingdom. PIAS, the umbrella company of Wall of Sound, distributed Hurricane worldwide excluding North America.[87] The album scored 72 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic.[88] Prior to the album's release, Jones performed at Massive Attack's Meltdown festival in London on 19 June 2008, Jones performed four new songs from the album and premiered the music video which Jones and artist Nick Hooker collaborated on, which resulted in \"Corporate Cannibal\".[89][90][91] Jones promoted the album even further by appearing on talk show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, performed at several awards galas, and embarked on The Hurricane Tour. The same year, Jones was honoured with Q Idol Award.\n\nde7ca951e2"
