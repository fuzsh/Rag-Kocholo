        "text": "BURNING THE GROUND EXCLUSIVE 1986\n\n“C’est la Vie” is a song by American singer-songwriter Robbie Nevil from his self-titled debut album in 1986. The song was first recorded by gospel singer Beau Williams for his 1985 album Bodacious!.\n\nWritten by Nevil with Duncan Pain and Mark Holding, Nevil recorded the song for his eponymous debut album, and it was released as the first single. Nevil’s single spent two weeks at #2 on the U.S. singles chart in January 1987 and remained in the top 40 for 16 weeks, becoming his highest-charting U.S. hit. (It was kept from #1 by two songs, “Shake You Down” by Gregory Abbott and “At This Moment” by Billy Vera and the Beaters). Additionally, the song went to #1 on the American dance chart for one week in February 1987. Internationally, the song reached #3 on the United Kingdom charts. The song went to #1 almost exactly 20 years after Frank Sinatra’s song “That’s Life” (which is the English translation of the song title) did the same.\n\nNevil performed the song on the May 30, 1987 broadcast of Soul Train.\n\nSIDE A:\n\nC’est La Vie (Extended Version) 7:06\n\nEdited By – The Latin Rascals\n\nRemix – Arthur Baker\n\nC’est La Vie (Single Version) 3:25\n\nSIDE B:\n\nC’est La Vie (Dub Mix) 7:15\n\nEdited By – The Latin Rascals\n\nRemix – Arthur Baker\n\nTime Waits For No One 5:22\n\nVINYL GRADE:\n\nVinyl: Near Mint\n\nSleeve: Near Mint\n\nU.S. CHART HISTORY:\n\nYear Single Chart Position 1986 C’est La Vie U.S. Billboard Hot 100 #2 1986 C’est La Vie U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play #1\n\nRELEASE INFORMATION:\n\nLabel: Manhattan Records ‎– V-56036\n\nFormat: Vinyl, 12″, 33 ⅓ RPM\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: 1986\n\nGenre: Electronic, Rock, Pop\n\nStyle: Pop Rock, Synth-pop\n\nCREDITS:\n\nProducer – Alex Sadkin, Phil Thornalley\n\nNOTES:\n\nFrom the debut album “ROBBIE NEVIL”\n\nFind the 12″ on DISCOGS\n\nEQUIPMENT USED:\n\nTurntable: Pro-Ject Debut Carbon (DC)\n\nCartridge: Ortofon 2M\n\nStylus: Ortofon OM Stylus 30\n\nPlatter: Pro-Ject Acryl-It platter\n\nStabilizer: Pro-Ject Record Puck\n\nPhono Pre-amp: Bellari VP130 Tube Phono Preamp\n\nTube: Tung-Sol 12AX7ECC803-S Gold Electron Tube\n\nSoundcard: ESI Juli@\n\nRecord Cleaning: VPI HW 16.5 Record Cleaning Machine\n\nArtwork Scans: Brother MFC-6490CW Professional Series Scanner\n\nSOFTWARE USED:\n\nRecording/Editing: Adobe Audition 3.0 (Recording)\n\nDown Sampling: iZotope RX Advanced 2\n\nArtwork Editor: Adobe Photoshop CS5\n\nClick Removal: Manual\n\nFLAC/MP3 Conversion: dBpoweramp\n\nM3U Playlist: Playlist Creator\n\nRESTORATION NOTES:\n\nAll vinyl rips are recorded @ 32bit/float\n\nFLAC (Level Eight)\n\nMP3 (320kbps)\n\nArtwork scanned at 600dpi\n\nBURNING THE GROUND EXCLUSIVE 1987\n\n“Let Me Be the One” is a single by Exposé, released on May 15, 1987.

The song was produced by Bernard Edwards of Chic-fame and written by Jody Watley, Franne Golde and David Paul Bryant.\n\nWatley’s previous single, “Still a Thrill,” fared well in dance and R&B markets, but less-so in the mainstream. This prompted her label, MCA, to go in a more pop-friendly direction. “Don’t You Want Me” was one of the biggest crossover singles for the year 1987, reaching top ten on the Billboard pop and R&B charts and becoming a number-one dance club hit.\n\n“Don’t You Want Me” landed in the Top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart the week of October 24, 1987, advancing from #56 to #40. The song reached #6 on December 19, 1987 and remained there for three consecutive weeks.\n\nInternationally the single reched #55 U.K., #46 New Zealand and #24 Canada.\n\nSIDE A:\n\nDon’t You Want Me (Extended Mix) 6:48\n\nDon’t You Want Me (A Cappella) 4:12\n\nSIDE B:\n\nDon’t You Want Me (Radio Edit) 4:17\n\nDon’t You Want Me (Dub Version) 7:54\n\nVINYL GRADE:\n\nVinyl: Near Mint\n\nSleeve: Near Mint\n\nU.S. CHART HISTORY:\n\nYear Single Chart Position 1987 Don’t You Want Me U.S. Billboard Hot 100 #6 1987 Don’t You Want Me U.S. Billboard Hot Black Singles #3 1987 Don’t You Want Me U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play #1\n\nRELEASE INFORMATION:\n\nLabel: MCA Records ‎– MCA-23785, MCA Records ‎– MCA 23785\n\nFormat: Vinyl, 12″, 33 ⅓ RPM\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: 1987\n\nGenre: Electronic, Funk / Soul\n\nStyle: Synth-pop\n\nCREDITS:\n\nDesign – Lynn Robb\n\nManagement [Direction] – Bennett Freed Management\n\nMastered By – Herb Powers, Jr.*\n\nPhotography – Victoria Pearson\n\nProducer – Bernard Edwards\n\nRemix, Producer [Additional Production Assistant] – Dennis Mitchell\n\nRemix, Producer [Additional Production] – Francois Kevorkian*, Michael Hutchinson\n\nWritten-By – D.P.
