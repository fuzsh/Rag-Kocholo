        "text": "Jam and Lewis (Jimmy ‘Jam’ Harris and Terry Lewis) emerged as a song writing and production team in the 1980s, and have gone on to become of the most successful in chart history. Their biggest hits have been in America, where they are based and where they have producer credits for no fewer than 16 #1 singles, starting in the decade mentioned and continuing in the 1990s and the 2000s. However, while they have had dozens of Top 10 hits in the UK in this period, a chart topper here has eluded them, despite them working with some prominent British artists.\n\nJam and Lewis started their partnership as members of funk/R&B band Flyte Tyme in the 1970s, playing keyboards and bass respectively. They took this name for their production company when they began their careers as writers and producers, as by the time they left the group it had been renamed The Time. Through their manager, they were introduced to the boss of Tabu records who invited them to provide songs for the next album of an established act signed to the label, The S.O.S. Band. Among the songs that Jam and Lewis wrote and produced for this group in 1983 was Just Be Good To Me, which was an R&B hit in the States and a Top 20 single in the UK. The following year, one of The Time’s former lead vocalists, Alexander O’Neal, was signed to Tabu and Jam and Lewis began writing and producing for him, along with another Tabu signing Cherrelle. A duet between these two artists, Saturday Love, was recorded in 1985 and it was this song that enabled Jam and Lewis to properly cross over from R&B hit makers to mainstream chart draws.\n\nTabu enjoyed several hits around the world in 1986 with Jam/Lewis material in the US, with some most notable achievements in the UK: The S.O.S Band had another Top 20 hit here with The Finest, and when Saturday Love made the Top 10, Alexander O’Neal’s debut album re-charted and reached its Top 20 peak and Cherrelle’s High Priority album followed it there. But it was another label, A&M, that had the greatest success with the Jam and Lewis sound, particularly in the US. Janet Jackson’s Control, an absolute tour-de-force and her breakthrough album, yielded several hit singles including When I Think Of You, the first #1 for her and for her producers. The latter wouldn’t have to wait long for another #1 on the Hot 100: five weeks later, The Human League (whose US record company was A&M) were at the top with Human. Human was a Top 10 here too but didn’t go all the way to the top, despite The Human League being based in the UK. Another Brit who had a US #1 with a Jam and Lewis (co-)produced song was George Michael, whose Monkey stalled at #13 here in 1988.\n\nThe last Jam and Lewis #1 in the US for the 1980s was another Janet Jackson single, Miss You Much, from her 1989 album Rhythm Nation 1814. By then, they had had more hits with O’Neal (Criticize was Top 10 in the UK; a second duet with Cherrelle Never Knew Love Like This made the Top 30 in the UK and the US), post-Bobby Brown era New Edition, and even A&M boss Herb Alpert, who invited the duo to produce his 1988 album Keep Your Eye On Me, evidently delighted with the chart placings they had delivered for the artists on his label.\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Aug. 11\n\n1986\n\nThe COMMUNARDS (Jimmy Somerville) Don’t Leave Me This Way (London LON103)\n\nDEPECHE MODE A Question Of Time (Mute 7BONG12)\n\nThe HUMAN LEAGUE Human (Virgin VS880)\n\nIn the middle of the 1980s, the biggest names in British pop of the first half of the decade seemed suddenly to disappear en masse. They would all return (albeit to less success than they had enjoyed earlier), but for much of 1985 their names were missing from the charts.\n\nAdam Ant’s time as a chart act was over. His only single of the year peaked at #50, an album sold poorly, and he focused on acting for the rest of the decade.\n\nCulture Club were having some time away from each other; an exhausted Boy George spent a lot of time in America, struggling with drugs. They missed Live Aid.\n\nDuran Duran were on hiatus and the members working on other projects (see 13 January).\n\nFrankie Goes To Hollywood had enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame and were spending their money.\n\nSpandau Ballet were squabbling with their record company and were unable to record any new material until the matter was sorted.\n\nWham! were abroad touring and their only release was a single a few weeks before the end of the year.\n\nThis meant there was room for some new stars. Two particularly memorable breakthroughs were those of Madonna and A-Ha – no longer could Smash Hits rely on home-grown artists from which to choose its cover stars. The biggest emerging British talent of the year arguably came in the shape not of a new band or solo singer, but a production team that would dominate the charts for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe STOCK AITKEN WATERMAN Story Part 1\n\nOn February 19th 1982, an obscure song by an unknown artist was released by Logo records in the UK. One Nine For A Lady Breaker, its title inspired by the recent craze for CB (Citizen’s Band) radio slang, was performed by “Chris Britton”, and it flopped. An inspection of the label reveals two salient pieces of information: that it was produced by Loose Ends Productions, and that one of its co-writers was one M. Stock. Loose Ends was a production company co-owned by Pete Waterman, and Chris Britton was writer Mike Stock under an assumed name: indirectly, this was the earliest collaboration between the primary writer and the main promoter of the Stock Aitken Waterman production team. Indirectly, because Waterman had little to do with the Chris Britton single: his Loose Ends partner Peter Collins took credit as producer for that. But when Stock needed a producer for another project in early 1984, he remembered the by-then defunct Loose Ends Productions involvement with his previous work and looked up Waterman to discuss it.\n\nStock had paid his musical dues in pub band Mirage since the 1970s. In the evenings, Mirage became Nightwork and worked the club circuit; they made a modest but satisfactory living. Various changes in personnel occurred over the year, but a key addition to the band was the 1981 arrival of Matt Aitken, a guitarist whom Mirage’s then singer had worked with on a cruise ship. In 1982, Stock had installed a recording desk and equipment in the basement of his home and started renting the facilities to clients. On New Year’s Eve 1983, he quit Mirage/Nightwork to concentrate on studio work and Aitken went with him. In addition to supporting other artists who used Stock’s studio services, they had an idea of their own for a female version of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, whose Relax was a huge hit at the time. They had a song (The Upstroke) and knew how the concept would work, but needed the backing of a record or production company to make it happen.\n\nTurned down by their initial contacts, Stock and Aitken were in luck with Waterman: he met them in office space he was renting from Stiff records just days after his return to London following a period living and working in America. He had parted company with Collins, set up Pete Waterman Limited (PWL) and a publishing company, All Boys Music, and he was looking for a new project. He understood at once Stock and Aitken’s proposition: they were the band (called Agents Aren’t Aeroplanes, a quote from a John Le Carre spy novel – after all, the band name ‘Frankie Goes To Hollywood’ was originally a newspaper headline) and they would use two girls (sisters Diana and Julie Seabrook) to front it. The track was recorded on 14 February 1984 and a release was organized via RCA records “in association with The Proto Record Company”, the label owned by British-Greek Cypriot businessman Barry Evangeli. Billed as A Pete Waterman Production, Aitken and Stock received credits as co-writers and “directors”.\n\nTheir next projects also involved Evangeli. The previous year, singer Andy Paul had been a client using Stock’s recording studio. Paul had asked Stock to write him a song he could use at Eurovision in his bid to represent Cyprus. Stock obliged; Paul performed Anna Mari-Elena (the composer credit was to ‘Andy’, to imply Paul wrote it himself, due to rules at Eurovision) and came 15th of 19 on the night. Evangeli decided there was a market for the song with the UK’s Greek Cypriot community and put out a recording of the song, this time on Proto itself. He also engaged Waterman, Stock and Aitken to supervise recordings for two of his other clients: two singles for American drag queen Divine and an album for British singer Hazell Dean. Proto’s acts were popular in British gay clubs: “This was good news because by this time the gay clubs and discos were where new acts and records were being discovered. The gay community had become a powerful force,” Stock noted 1. The was particularly true for Dean: after a decade of trying, her breakthrough hit the previous year had crossed over from gay clubs and Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go), originally written by Stock for another artist, went to #4 and cemented her appeal.\n\nIt was this song that brought Waterman, Aitken and Stock to the attention of Pete Burns. He loved Whatever I Do and wanted a similar sound for the second album by his group Dead Or Alive. Unlike the other artists they’d worked with, Burns came to them with songs already written and Waterman knew at once which one would be the hit: You Spin Me Round (Like A Record): “It was fantastic. Easily their best song. I knew it was the one, but I was trying to act cool; I knew that the song was a smash, but I also knew that I didn’t have the budget to produce it.” 2\n\nIt was a good job that Waterman had come up via the ‘business’ side of music industry – A&R, budget control – as these were the skills needed with the Dead Or Alive project. The deal they had with CBS, Dead Or Alive’s record company, was to produce other, named tracks and the money CBS had provided only covered those recordings. Waterman had to create the appearance that those songs were being worked on while the priority track, You Spin Me Round (Like A Record), used up most of the budget. Furthermore, the other members of Dead Or Alive were unhappy with Aitken and Stock, almost coming to blows over their apparent exclusion of everyone except Burns (as vocalist) during the recording: “I was back at the office when Pete rang me up,” Waterman recalls. “He told me in no uncertain terms to get down to the studio before Steve [McCoy, Dead Or Alive’s drummer] chinned Matt and Mike. I went down and told the two of them to go off and have a break. Immediately. They did so… I sent Dead Or Alive home too. It was all too fraught. I told them that [PWL engineer] Phil Harding and I would finish off the record ourselves.” 2\n\nThis story indicates the type of relationship Waterman had at that time with Aitken and Stock: he seemed to believe he had assumed the role of manager to a pair of jobbing musicians with an interest in studio work. “The creative input from each of us would vary from song to song over the years, but if we were to have badges pinned to our lapels, then Mike’s would read ‘The Songwriter’, Matt’s would read ‘The Musician’, and mine would read ‘The Producer’,” Waterman wrote in 2000 2. Stock wrote in 2004 that a more accurate description of the division of labour was: “I wrote the songs, Matt and I produced them, and Pete promoted and sold them… there was no real role for Pete in the studio. He was out and about doing the business side of things… Pete’s role was to keep supplying us with work and putting us in touch with artists.” 1\n\nThis he did. As well as the Proto acts and Dead Or Alive, two other clients in 1984 were Lulu’s sister Edwina Lawrie and teenagers Girl Talk. The former (credited simply as ‘Edwina’ on the sleeve of her single and ‘Edwina Laurie’ on the label) recorded a cover of the Nik Kershaw track Dark Glasses; it flopped. (Kershaw had been a client of Waterman’s Loose Ends Productions.) Teenagers Girl Talk were signed to Inner Vision, the company who had just lost Wham! to their artist roster; Can The Rhythm just scraped inside the Top 100.\n\nHowever, the team had had some success. As well as Hazell Dean’s Top 10 single, You Think You’re A Man by Divine had also made the Top 40 and they were about to score their first #1: their last single of 1984 You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) topped the singles chart early the following year, after a slow start. Despite various iterations of the order and nature of the credits on their recordings though, all declared Waterman as producer; Aitken and Stock were always named, but remained ‘arrangers’ rather than producers. “I didn’t like the idea. There was no tradition in the music industry for a director,” said Stock 1. Waterman had positioned himself as a kind of studio head, whereas Stock believed there should be greater equality in the partnership. The matter was becoming urgent given they now had a silver disc for sales of You Spin Me Round. So, shortly after the release of Lover Come Back To Me, the trio’s second single with Dead Or Alive, Stock proposed a more formal structuring of their business relationship.\n\n1 Stock, Mike.

After the standalone single A Celebration was issued on was deleted the track was hard to obtain for many years: it was recorded after sessions for 1981’s October were completed, but long before sessions for the follow-up album War began, so was featured on neither of these LPs. Only comparatively recently has it been included on CD compilations and as a bonus track on the remastered reissue of October. The producer for both albums mentioned, and for A Celebration itself, was Steve Lillywhite, a hugely prolific contributor to 80s pop.\n\nLillywhite grew up in a musical family. Both his parents played instruments and encouraged him to do so too, and while he did have a general enjoyment of music and musicianship his chief interest initially was to emerge as engineering. As a result, on leaving school he took a job as a tape operator at a Phonogram studio in London’s Marble Arch. Although a lowly position, the exposure to different genres was invaluable experience for his future career as a producer: on the same day’s recording he might observe an orchestra with a full string section, followed by an experimental rock band, followed by an operatic vocalist. Another benefit was that when the studios weren’t being used for commercial recordings, the team could experiment with their own projects and it was during these periods of downtime that Lillywhite started to practise his craft.\n\nBut it was via Island records that he got his ‘break’. He was invited to assist on some demos for their new signing Ultravox, which led to his first credit as a (co-) producer on the debut Ultravox album and an offer of a job as a staff producer for the label. But Lillywhite’s interest in the burgeoning London punk scene meant that this deal was limiting: artists he was interested in weren’t signed with Island, so there was no opportunity to work with them. He managed to get himself released from the contract and has been freelance ever since. This allowed him to work with Siouxsie Sioux and her Banshees (producing their debut single and first album The Scream) and his brother’s band, The Members. The latter group was signed to Virgin and that label then offered him a chance to produce a record for a ‘name’ act, in this case, XTC.\n\nThereafter, he was in demand to produce records for established artists and newcomers alike. The first album released in the 1980s to credit Lillywhite as producer was Peter Gabriel’s third LP; by the end of the year, U2 had made their long-playing debut with the first of three Lillywhite-helmed albums, Boy. His long association with an act was rare though; in general, he believed it better for him and better for the artist if he worked with an act on just one album. That way his sound, and theirs, was kept fresh. An example of an artist who shared that view was Joan Aramtrading, whose Walk Under Ladders Lillywhite produced in 1981. Having worked with Glyn Johns for several album in the 70s, Armatrading selected a different producer for almost every one of her 80s LPs until she decided to produce herself. The exception was Lillywhite, who also produced 1983’s The Key, although significantly Val Garay was chosen to produce that album’s big hit single, Drop The Pilot. And when Armatrading completed her first self-produced album Sleight Of Hand in 1986, Lillywhite was brought back to mix the completed product.\n\nLillywhite’s production suited all the artists mentioned for two keys reasons. Firstly, although working with analogue equipment, the digital age was coming. His clean, crisp recordings sounded good on vinyl and just as good when they were transferred to compact disc, and as these acts had loyal fans this meant that the albums could still be enjoyed when reissued later in the decade on the new format. Secondly, they all gave ‘big’ live shows, filling large venues with powerful sound, and something of this was captured in Lillywhite’s studio sessions.\n\nThe diversity of artists he has worked with throughout his career has also helped the objective of having him fresh. Other big names he worked with in the 80s included Talking Heads and The Rolling Stones, and other Smash Hits cover stars he produced albums for were Thompson Twins (1982’s Set, he also contributed to their 1989 album Big Trash); Toyah’s band Toyah (1982’s The Changeling); Stuart Adamson’s Big Country (The Crossing, 1983, and Steeltown, 1984); Jim Kerr’s Simple Minds (1984’s Sparkle In The Rain); and Kirsty MacColl’s 1989 album Kite. He also produced the first two singles for Climie Fisher which were included on their debut album in 1988.\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Mar. 22\n\n1982\n\nU2 A Celebration (Island WIP6770)\n\n1985\n\nTEARS FOR FEARS Everybody Wants To Rule The World (Mercury IDEA9)\n\nSteve Jolley played guitar for a couple of bands in the late 60s and early 70s before teaming up with Tony Swain in 1975 as members of the group Chaser; they released the single Red Rum (a tribute to the racehorse) which they co-wrote with band mate Richard Palmer. The same writing team were behind a single released in 1979 by The English Boys, this time with Swain producing. It was recorded at Red Bus Studios, where Jolley and Swain were to become in-house producers. In the first half of the 80s, they were involved with numerous hits for a variety of major and minor artists on a number of different labels.\n\nMany of their productions were issued on two labels closely related to Red Bus Studios: Red Bus (launched in 1980 with a Jolley and Swain-produced cover of Cat Stevens’ Wild World), and R&B Records, founded in 1981. The first release on the latter label was the debut single by Imagination, arguably the group the duo were most associated with. Body Talk was the first of nine Top 40 hits for the group over the next three years or so. Jolley and Swain were involved in the writing, the producing and performed as session musicians on most of these singles; they also found time to record the largely instrumental Backtrackin’ album, released under their own names, showing their versatility.\n\nTheir popularity peaked in 1984, the year in which they helmed albums for Bananarama (Bananarama), Spandau Ballet (Parade) and Alison Moyet (her debut, Alf). Between them, these three albums alone yielded seven Top 20 hit singles during the year and the result was a nomination at the following year’s BRIT awards for Best British Producers.\n\nThey had been working with the former for a couple of years, starting with their single Shy Boy. “They had a song called ‘Big Red Motorbike’ and we didn’t like the lyrics so we changed it to Shy Boy. For some reason we found those lyrics more acceptable,” the ‘Rams recounted in the sleeve notes to their The Greatest Hits Collection album in 1988. Of the recording sessions themselves, they had this to say: “It was a really good laugh recording with Jolley and Swain except sometimes we got too much and they’d send us home like naughty schoolgirls. We’d take out cards into the studio and sit on the floor laughing and they’d send us home.”\n\nParade was their second collaboration with Spandau; they had produced 1983’s True, the title track of which provided the producers with their biggest international hit single: as well as making #1 in the UK and Ireland, it made the Top 10 in America, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Holland, Spain and Switzerland, among others. But it was Moyet’s Alf that gave them their biggest long-playing success in the UK: less than three years from its release, it had moved more than a million units.\n\nThey were unable to sustain this success after 1984. Some of this was beyond their control: Spandau, involved in a dispute with Chrysalis records, went on hiatus while they sorted out a new distribution deal with CBS and when they returned it was with a new producer. Imagination were also in flux: their singles of the mid-80s performed poorly in the charts and their relationship with their primary producers ended when they left R&B Records and signed to RCA. They were still having hits with Bananarama, but the girls too were looking for new collaborators by 1986. By then, though, Jolley and Swain were bringing an end to their own partnership. The last single jointly credited to the pair, from British gospel singer Paul Johnson’s second album, was released in 1989.\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Feb. 12\n\n1982\n\nThe ASSOCIATES Party Fears Two (Associates ASC1)\n\nIMAGINATION (Leee John) Just An Illusion (R&B Records RBS208)\n\nOf all the productions teams working in the 1980s, none worked with more Smash Hits cover acts than Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. They also worked with Elvis Costello, who appeared on the cover in the 1970s. Recalling their work together, he said: “I first met Clive as a fellow producer for 2-Tone records. By the time I had finished The Specials’ debut album, Clive and Alan had moved with Madness to Stiff records where they cut some of the best pop singles since the finest days of The Kinks. Despite making the most ‘English’ music on the planet, ‘Clanger and Winstanley’ even managed to get Madness to #1 in America with Our House. By 1983 they were pretty irresistible and unstoppable.” 1\n\nIndeed they were: in the previous year, there was barely a week when the production team didn’t have a single in the UK chart due largely to their collaborations with Kevin Rowland’s Dexy’s Midnight Runners (two Top 10 hits from the platinum album Too-Rye-Ay) and the previously mentioned Madness, with whom they had placed an 11th single in the Top 10 by the end of the year. Accordingly, Elvis chose them to produce Punch The Clock, his 1983 album where he intended to reacquaint himself and The Attractions with pop. Of the duo’s working practices, Costello had this to say: “They favoured the ‘building block’ method of recording: retaining very little from the original ‘live’ take (often only the drums) and tailoring each instrumental overdub to best serve the arrangement. This system … yielded startling results when the last piece was in place.” 1\n\nWinstanley, as a teenager, had “always wondered why some records sounded better than others, I figured that it must be down to the production and felt that was the direction I wanted to go in”. 2 He broke into the profession by persuading the owners of a record shop he frequented to build a demo studio on their premises and learnt his craft by engineering and producing for local unsigned bands. Langer had always wanted to perform, and early recordings by his group Deaf School (for which he played guitar) were engineered by Winstanley. When Langer decided to go solo, he asked Winstanley to produce for him. Langer himself had got into production too, helming Madness’s first single on 2-Tone (as noted by Elvis Costello above), but when Madness moved to Stiff to make an album he felt he didn’t have the right experience to produce a long-player, so brought Winstanley in to co-produce. This partnership would serve on all Madness’s albums until the group’s split in 1986.\n\nOther pre-Punch The Clock work that had made them “pretty irresistible” to Costello included producing records for Smash Hits cover alumni Jennie McKeown (two singles for her group The Belle Stars), Pete Wylie (his Shambeko! Say Wah! phase) and Julian Cope (The Teardrop Explodes’ highest-charting hits). They also made notable singles with Langer’s former Deaf School band mate Bette Bright (who retired after marrying Suggs whom she had met through Madness’s association with Langer), comedian Alexei Sayle (whose 1982 single ’Ullo John! Gotta New Motor? was a hit on its reissue a couple of years later) and flash-in-the-pan pop duo Haysi Fantayzee. It was following these rather ad-hoc associations, and their work on the Punch The Clock and Too-Rye-Aye albums, that Langer and Winstanley began to promote themselves to interested record labels as a package deal. Between them, they believed they had the full skill-set any act needing a producer could want. In 1998, Langer admitted that they “disagree quite often but usually one of us backs off. It depends on how strongly the other feels. Sometimes I’m a bit off the wall and maybe not as sensible or commercial as I should be, and Alan’s good at pulling me back into line. I quite often disagree with the band as well. I don’t mind if things are ragged or out of tune, whereas Alan is much neater.” Of the organization of their working arrangements, he said “I concentrate more on the arrangements and rehearsals at the beginning of each project, but when we get into the studio it becomes much more equal … Alan spends more time at the desk than I do because he handles things like comping vocals and mixing. He’s definitely more of an engineer than me, because he has a very strong engineering background, so it makes sense for him to have that hands-on role. Having two sets of skills means we can do the whole package without anyone else – or we used to be able to, before remixing! We don’t get involved with remixing because it’s not where our interest lies.” 2\n\nPost-Punch The Clock production credits in the 1980s included work with Lloyd Cole and the Commotions (the album Easy Pieces), Sandie Shaw (a superb version of Cole’s Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken?) and Northern Ireland’s The Adventures. There were collaborations with more Smash Hits cover stars too: various tracks for Marilyn (1983-1984), David Bowie & Mick Jagger’s Live Aid tie-in Dancing in the Street (1985), the China Crisis album What Price Paradise (1986, from which the single shown at the top of this article was taken) and standalone singles for Morrissey (1989). They also produced the soundtrack album to hyped 1986 movie Absolute Beginners which saw them work with Bowie again on the title cut, Patsy Kensit’s group Eighth Wonder (Having It All, which later appeared on the b-side to their single Will You Remember) and The Style Council (Have You Ever Had It Blue?, Paul Weller’s finest single since The Jam). Appropriately enough, also featured on this collection was the single Quiet Life they produced for Ray Davies: to quote Costello once again, having “cut some of the best pop singles since the finest days of The Kinks”, Langer and Winstanley finally got to work with one of them.\n\n1 Costello, Elvis. “Liner notes”, Punch The Clock, Demon Records, 28 February 1995.\n\n2 Sillitoe, Sue. “Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley”, Sound On Sound, SOS Publications, July 1998.\n\nNEW SINGLES on sale from Jan. 12\n\n1987\n\nCHINA CRISIS Best Kept Secret (Virgin VS926)"
