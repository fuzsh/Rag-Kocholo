        "text": "Album Description & Collectors information:\n\nBob Marley is an iconic figure in the world of music, and his contributions to the reggae genre are unparalleled. In 1979, Bob Marley & The Wailers released their twelfth studio album, Survival, which is considered one of the most politically charged and socially conscious albums of all time. T\n\nSurvival features nine tracks, each with a strong political message. The album cover features a striking image of Bob Marley superimposed on a map of Africa, with the words \"Bob Marley & The Wailers, Survival\" emblazoned across the top. The album was produced by Bob Marley & The Wailers, and recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. It was released on Island Records, and remains one of the most important and enduring albums in the reggae genre.\n\nThe original 1st pressing of the Survival album was released in 1979 on 12\" vinyl LP format. The vinyl was pressed on high-quality vinyl and featured a glossy, full-color album cover. The album was produced using analog recording techniques, which gives the music a warm, rich sound.\n\nMatrix/Stamper Codes:\n\nSide A: 200911 A-1 /79 II\n\nSide B: 200911 B-1 /79 III"
