        "text": "LOU GRAMM – founding member of Foreigner – one of the greatest singers in Rock music, LOU GRAMM’S unique vocals and hit songs have placed FOREIGNER™, among Billboard’s Top Artists of all time. Their 16 Billboard Top 40 Hit Songs defined an era.\n\nSONGS\n\n“I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS”\n\n“DOUBLE VISION”\n\n“COLD AS ICE”\n\n“HEAD GAMES”\n\n“JUKE BOX HERO”\n\n“BLUE MORNING”\n\n“HOT BLOODED”\n\n“FEELS LIKE THE FIRST TIME”\n\n“URGENT”\n\n“SAY YOU WILL”\n\n“I DON’T WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU”\n\n“WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU”\n\n“MIDNIGHT BLUE”\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nPre-Foreigner Era\n\nGramm was born in Rochester, New York, and began his musical career in his\n\nmid-teens, playing in local Rochester bands, including St. James Infirmary (later\n\nThe Infirmary), and PHFFT. He later sang harmony vocals in another local band,\n\nPoor Heart. Gramm then went on to sing and play drums, and to eventually\n\nbecome front man for the band Black Sheep. Black Sheep had the distinction of\n\nbeing the first American band signed to the Chrysalis label, which released their\n\nfirst single, “Stick Around” (1973). Black Sheep played in niteclubs in Rochester\n\nand Buffalo, NY including McVan’s, formerly at Niagara Street and Hertel\n\nAvenue. Soon after this initial bit of success, Black Sheep signed with Capitol\n\nRecords, releasing two albums in succession [Black Sheep (1974) and\n\nEncouraging Words (1975)]. They were the opening act for KISS when an icy\n\naccident with their equipment truck on the New York State Thruway suddenly\n\nended the band’s tour on Christmas Eve, 1975. Unable to support its albums with\n\nlive performances, Black Sheep came prematurely to a screeching halt.\n\nA year earlier, Lou Gramm had the opportunity to meet his future bandmate Mick\n\nJones. Jones was in Rochester performing with the band Spooky Tooth, and\n\nGramm had given Jones a copy of Black Sheep’s first album (S/T). It was early in\n\n1976, not long after Black Sheep’s truck accident, when Jones, in search of a\n\nlead vocalist for a new band he was assembling, expressed his interest in\n\nGramm and invited him in a phone call to audition for the job of lead singer.\n\nForeigner Formation and Heyday\n\nWith the blessings of his Black Sheep bandmates, Gramm flew down to New\n\nYork to audition for the still-unnamed band. With his powerful vocals, he got the\n\njob. Lou Grammatico then became Lou Gramm, and, with the band initially\n\nknown as “Trigger,” and later renamed Foreigner, became one of the most\n\nsuccessful rock vocalists of the late 1970s and 1980s. Circus magazine in 1978\n\nupon release of “Hot Blooded” commented that Lou Gramm had a voice that\n\nRobert Plant might envy. His unique vocals have made Foreigner one of\n\nBillboard’s Top 100 Artists of All Time in hit songs history.\n\nGramm was the lead vocalist on all of Foreigner’s hit songs, including “Feels Like\n\nthe First Time”, “Cold as Ice”, “Long, Long Way from Home”, “Hot Blooded”,\n\n“Double Vision”, “Blue Morning, Blue Day”, “Head Games”, “Dirty White Boy”,\n\n“Urgent”, “Juke Box Hero”, “Break It Up” and “Say You Will”. He co-wrote most of\n\nthe songs for the band, which achieved two of its biggest hits with the ballads\n\n“Waiting for a Girl Like You”, which spent ten weeks at #2 on the 1981-82\n\nAmerican Hot 100, and “I Want to Know What Love Is”, which was a #1 hit\n\ninternationally (US & UK) in 1985. Their first 8 singles cracked the Billboard Top\n\n20,(4 went Top 10) making them the first group since the Beatles to achieve this\n\nin 1980.\n\nFollowing the band’s second album, the wildly successful Double Vision, shifts in\n\npersonnel began to take place. Following their next album, Head Games, Gramm\n\nand Jones jointly decided to reduce the band’s lineup from six to four members.\n\nThe next album, which Gramm has called the high point of his work with\n\nForeigner, was aptly titled 4. Gramm wanted the band to remain true to its purer\n\nrock origins, favoring music with a solid drum and guitar structure, whereas\n\nJones embraced the 1980s style of synthesizer ballads — a more lucrative\n\napproach at the time. Indeed, the next album, Agent Provocateur, would find\n\nJones moving creatively in the opposite direction from Gramm, seeking out\n\npotential co-producers such as Trevor Horn, and then Alex Sadkin, which ended\n\nup giving Foreigner’s sound a somewhat new-wavish, keyboard-dominant quality.\n\nLate 1980s and 1990s\n\nBy 1987, Foreigner continued to struggle with ongoing internal conflicts. During\n\nthis period, Gramm released his first solo album, Ready or Not, which received\n\ncritical acclaim and contained a top five hit single with “Midnight Blue”. This was\n\nfollowed by the late-1987 Foreigner album Inside Information, which reached\n\nnumber 15 on Billboard’s album chart. The extracted “Say You Will” was released\n\nlate that year, reaching number 6 on the Hot 100 early in 1988, and “I Don’t Want\n\nto Live Without You” followed, reaching number 5 on the Hot 100 and number\n\none on the adult contemporary chart in the spring. A third single, “Heart Turns to\n\nStone” reached number 56 in the summer. Eventually a second solo effort, Long\n\nHard Look, that included the top ten hit, “Just Between You and Me”, and “True\n\nBlue Love”, reached the Top 40. Gramm also contributed a song to the\n\nsoundtrack for the 1987 movie The Lost Boys, titled “Lost in the Shadows.”\n\nEncouraged by his solo success, Gramm left the group in 1990 to form Shadow\n\nKing with close friend and former Black Sheep bassist Bruce Turgon. The new\n\ngroup’s 1991 self-titled album was released by Atlantic Records. Despite positive\n\nreviews, the group lacked cohesiveness. It also did not enjoy the level of\n\nmarketing and promotional support necessary to sustain a new project. Shadow\n\nKing soon disbanded. The same year, Foreigner released the album Unusual\n\nHeat, a relatively unsuccessful effort fronted by vocalist Johnny Edwards.\n\nGramm returned to the group in 1992 to record three new songs for the\n\ncompilation, The Very Best of … and Beyond, bringing a new energy back into\n\nthe mix. Gramm also brought Bruce Turgon with him to join the Foreigner lineup\n\nat this point.\n\nIn 1992, Gramm became a Born Again Christian “after being tired of the rock ‘n’\n\nroll life and not feeling very fulfilled…I was falling prey to some of the bad habits\n\nthat can go along with that, and I just decided that my own willpower and\n\nstrength was not enough, and [being raised a Catholic Christian], I knew\n\nthe answer was something deeper for a long time.”\n\nIn 1995, Foreigner released the album Mr. Moonlight on the Rhythm Safari\n\nlabel which, although relatively successful in Europe, was not as widely marketed\n\nor distributed in the U.S. Still, “Until the End of Time” made inroads at adult\n\ncontemporary radio. With the changing trends in popular music, this now-classic\n\nrock band came to suffer the inevitable slowing of their genre’s momentum.\n\nIn 1996, Mick Jones invited Gramm to perform backing vocals on a cover version\n\nof “I Want to Know What Love Is” he was producing for the Australian singer Tina\n\nArena. The song went on to become a major hit again throughout Europe.\n\nIn April 1997, two months after providing vocals for Christian rock band Petra’s\n\nPetra Praise 2: We Need Jesus, and on the eve the band was to leave for a\n\nJapan tour, Gramm was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called a\n\ncraniopharyngioma. Although the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery\n\ndamaged his pituitary gland. In addition, the recovery program had caused\n\nGramm to gain weight, and likewise affected his stamina and voice. He continued\n\nto work with Jones throughout his illness and in 1999, Gramm was back touring\n\nwith Foreigner playing summer festivals and smaller markets.\n\n2000s to present"
