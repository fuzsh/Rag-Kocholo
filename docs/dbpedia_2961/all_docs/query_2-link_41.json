That is some brilliant video-makin' right there!!!\n\n(I'm looking for) Cracks in the Pavement - 4/5\n\nFits the theme of the album perfectly, from the synths,\n\nto they lyrics, and is there a callback to the keyboards from new moon on monday in it.\n\nanyways, i like the chorus, and the tempo of the song,\n\nit's not too long, and i wondered if it would have been single material,\n\nor if they would have done a remix of it.\n\ni like the way the song changes tempo and pace 2 or 3 times throughout,\n\nincluding the instrumental break before the last chorus.\n\na good song, and just strengthens the first side of the album.\n\nlater\n\n-1\n\nSeven and the Ragged Tiger - 3/5. They should have taken more time, but they were under pressure as they were \"hot\". The production is muddled. To me, Alex was the wrong producer for them. All the space that was enjoyable on the first two was condensed to where it is like creamed corn, too mushy. There are some good hints of songs there: Shadows on Your Side, Of Crime and Passion, and the Seventh Stranger, along with the New Moon on Monday, and Union of the Snake. That is five songs that could have been better with time. During that time, they could have written at least 4 better songs than what is on there. Tiger Tiger is a b-side at best. The other two songs are complete and poor filler to me. On the other side, they were faced with the incredible task of following up one of the best albums of the decade..."
