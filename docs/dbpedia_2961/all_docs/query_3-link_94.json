        "text": "By 1982, due to the perfect storm of their photogenic appearance and their top of the form music videos at exactly the right moment in time, this would-be cult band [with a lower case “c”] who wanted nothing more than to be like their heroes, JAPAN, were catapulted to the forefront of top 40 charts the world over. The first album was a non-starter in America, but thanks to MTV saturation [it was invented for heavy rotation clips like “Hungry Like The Wolf,” I swear…] their second album eventually ignited even in the notoriously backward looking US charts, and I was treated to the uncanny spectacle of Duran Duran becoming stars in America with material I was fully behind. A novelty!\n\n“Rio” sold like hotcakes, and eventually, even America bought the reissued first album with the new hit single, “Is There Something I Should Know,” appended to it…in heaping bucketloads. As the summer of 1983 turned to fall, EMI/Capitol Records were probably gnawing their nails to the quick awaiting the moment that their first single from album number three would drop. The band had all eyes on them as they recorded in a furious cloud of activity with Alex Sadkin, late of Grace Jones’ “Nightclubbing” opus, producing. Would they connect with the ball?\n\nDuran Duran: Union Of The Snake – US – 12″ [1983]\n\nUnion Of The Snake [The Monkey Mix] 6:22\n\nUnion Of the Snake [7″ ver.] 4:20\n\nSecret Oktober 2:44\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I heard the single. One of my friends was in the throes of Duran Duran obsession and she made sure to buy the single on import as soon as it was in the record store where she worked. Getting the déclassé US edition would not be happening. That store had the absolute best import selection in Central Florida so she actually managed to get one. I can’t say I’ve ever seen the UK 12″ since the US version was beyond ubiquitous and I can’t imagine many were exported.\n\nWhen I heard it for the first time on a tape in her car, I was… non-plussed. The group had obviously been listening hard to that year’s top selling David Bowie album as the swing horn hooks of “Let’s Dance” [albeit from a synthesizer] were crudely grafted on to the overegged, multi-layer cake of the song. One that threatened to topple over from the excessive fondant icing slathered over the proceedings.\n\nThe “Monkey Mix” was closer to the dub mix ethos that had held over from “Is There Something I Should Know,” with the vocals minimized to the point of a single verse making its appearance at the 4:30 mark in the 6:27 song. This song takes the cake for the most percussive Duran Duran song ever, as it’s full to the brim with all manner of clicks, trills, and plenty of temple block abuse. Less impressive was the song’s nearly formless middle eight which was a wordless stew of skyrocketing guitar riffs and synths wooshing into the stratosphere in an empty spectacle as saxophonist Andy Hamilton tried in vain to hold it together with some semblance of melody weaving through the chaos [with cowbell] of it all.\n\nI’d say that I preferred the “Monkey Mix” but it also featured the excesive repetition of the strident chorus that lasted for almost a minute on the fade. Both the 7″ and 12″ could have been at least 45 seconds shorter if anyone had asked me. The crunch chords of Andy Taylor’s guitar held court with LeBon’s isolated BVs in the more sparse “Monkey Mix” which allowed us to hear the bass guitar more readily. It’s always a good thing when one can actually hear John Taylor’s rather spirited bass work in this band! But even Andy Taylor got the benefit of a mix with more spaciousness to it. I’m almost enjoying the 12″ version after 40 years of indifference at the time of this writing!\n\nOne could almost smell the patchouli wafting off of “Secret Oktober” with its demure finger cymbals and drum machine groove shot through with synths on delay. Simon LeBon’s doubled vocals added the right touch of mystery to the practically Persian delights of this delicate confection. I can’t say that Duran Duran ever topped the sheer , alien beauty that emanated from this song in thick waves, but at least they came close with songs like “Breath After Breath.”\n\nI’ve heard that this one was thrown together in the last 24 hours after completing the album mix for “Seven + The Ragged Tiger” as alchemists Nick and Simon turned the lead of the turgid “Ragged Tiger” sessions into the gold of this song. It doesn’t sound as if anyone else from the band were in the studio when it was committed to tape and I’d be paying good money for a lot more where this came from if only Nick Rhodes would deign to gift us with more of its kind. I get the impression that all of his extracurricular activities from Double Duran tend to be bloodlessly cold chunks of conceptual art when he obviously has a facility to craft something far more beautiful. If I’m wrong in my assumption, someone please set me straight in the comments.\n\nThis single and album were where I got off of the Duran Duran train for a few years. Rejoining with the high water mark of “Notorious” at the behest of my [wise] friend Mr. Ware for what has amounted to a wild and woolly ride through highs and lows like few I’ve seen before from a single band. Not unlike the offerings of this surprisingly representational single.\n\n-30-"
