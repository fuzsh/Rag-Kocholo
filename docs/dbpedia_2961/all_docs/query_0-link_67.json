        "text": "78 Bob M arley edition Bob Marley Les Paul special guitar. The Les Paul series guitar was Bob’s favorite electric guitar for use on stage and in the studio. As a me- mento of the label’s appreciation of Bob’s long association with the Gib- son brand, the legendary guitar maker joined forces with the legendary reggae musician. The Marley Gibson Special was built to the exact speci- fications of Bob’s Les Paul on display at the Bob Marley Museum. Bob had modified his Les Paul in a few important ways, and Gibson duplicated these characteristics in the signature series guitar. The initial run of the Bob Marley Les Paul Special was limited to 200 guitars. Posthumous Releases Bob’s life after death has had almost as much activity and interest as- sociated with it as did his mortal life. When Bob died, he left behind a prodigious library of recordings; however, there was also a large number of unreleased songs that have continued to surface. Some of the more important posthumous releases included Legend, Confrontation, Chances Are, Africa Unite: The Single Collection, Talkin’ Blues, Songs of Freedom, Natural Mystic, the Legend Lives On: Bob Marley and the Wailers, and the Deluxe Edition re-releases. Chances Are and Confrontation In 1981, Danny Simms released the nine-song album Chances Are. This record contained previously unreleased material and new versions of previously released material. In 1983, Tuff Gong International and Is- land Records released Confrontation. This album was conceived of by Bob toward the end of his life. He recorded the tracks during the Uprising ses- sions and had his hand in all parts of making this release, except choosing the specific songs included and the order they appeared in. Rita stepped in to make these decisions. The album was a testament to Bob’s career. The album cover depicts the reggae superstar riding a white horse slaying a dragon with a lance in the traditional mold of St. George. The back of the jacket included a painting of the first battle between the Ethiopians and the Italians. Called the Bat- tle of Adowa, this 1896 battle foreshadowed the fighting that eventually drove Haile Selassie into exile. The album contained the songs “Chant Down Babylon,” “Buffalo Soldier,” “Jump Nyabinghi,” “Mix Up, Mix Up,” “Give Thanks and Praises,” Blackman Redemption,” “Trench Town,” “Stiff Necked Fools,” “I Know,” and “Rastaman Live Up.” The songs represent an excellent cross section of Bob’s writing at the apex of his abilities.\n\nThe Legacy and the Legend 79 Legend The next major title released under Bob’s name was titled Legend. Re- leased in 1984, the album was subtitled The Best of Bob Marley. However, due to the sheer quantity of Bob’s song output, 14 songs could not complete the proposed purpose. However, the album did an admirable job of presenting a picture of Bob’s output over the course of his career. In typical Wailers fashion, the remaining members of the group prepared a tour in support of the album. Downie and Marvin shared the singing duties and Ziggy joined the tour to lead the group for the Los Angeles show. Legend spent over two years on the American Top 200 Albums charts and it was on the UK charts for 129 weeks. Incredibly, the album spent just over 11 years on Billboard’s Top Pop Catalogue Album chart. This album went on to become the best- selling reggae release of all time and has been certified platinum 10 times. As of 2006, Legend had sold in excess of 12 million copies and continues to sell at a brisk pace. Songs of Freedom Another important release was the 1992 four-CD boxed set Bob Marley: Songs of Freedom. An officially licensed product of Tuff Gong and Island Records, the original pressing of this set was limited to one million copies. In 1999 there was a second pressing in a slightly different format, which did not change the fact that this was the definitive collection of Bob’s songs, spanning his entire career. The release began with several of Bob’s earliest singles and came forward in time to the acoustic version of “Re- demption Song.” The Singles Collection Africa Unite: The Singles Collection was released in November 2005. Unlike many of the other posthumous releases, this album had a defined pur- pose and deliberate design. Released for Bob’s 60th birthday celebration, the collection revels in much of Bob’s most outstanding material. The album was unique in that it contained material that spanned Bob’s career in addition to including two hip-hop remixes and a previously unreleased track. The final three tracks were the most significant on the release, as they were not available elsewhere. Will.i.am, a member of the American hip-hop group the Black Eyed Peas, was responsible for the remixing of “Africa Unite.” Completed in De- cember 2004, the song took on a new life in the hands of a contemporary\n\n80 Bob M arley producer/songwriter. The Black Eyed Peas added a stronger beat presence, additional instrumental textures, echoes on some vocals, and new words sung by Will himself. Overall, the remix clocked in at twice the original song’s length and received a hip-hop generation upgrade that brought in into the new millennium. The other remix was really a contemporary mashup. The idea of a mashup song is taking two existing songs and combining them in a manner that creates a third song that is a hybrid of the first two. Here the English DJ Ashley Beedle mashed together Bob’s fire-and-brimstone classic “Get Up, Stand Up” and Bob’s son Damian’s hot 2005 single “Welcome to Jamrock.” The combined version of the song began with the DJ reversing a record and then the beat from “Jamrock” dropped. However, instead of staying with Damian’s words, the DJ superimposed Bob’s words. An especially interesting twist was the insertion of the word “Jamrock” at the end of each phrase of Bob’s lyrics. An additional treat was the pres- ence of Peter Tosh. Tosh sang the second verse in the original song and that performance was repeated here (although only in recording: Tosh has been dead since 1987). With this song, Bob’s message was again updated for the hip-hop generation, but this time passed through the lens of his own son’s song. The only truly previously unreleased song on the album was titled “Slo- gans.” The song was originally recorded in 1979 while Bob was in Miami. The original tape of the song was found in Cedella’s house, and consisted of little more than vocals and a drum machine beat. Bob’s sons Ziggy and Stephen took the raw tape material and built the rest of the song. They added instrumental lines that complete the texture and the final product sounds much like other material completed by their father. The two Mar- ley sons enlisted the assistance of the rock guitar legend Eric Clapton to supply the lead guitar lines. The message of the song was still as impor- tant in 2005 as it was in 1979. Bob sang of his contempt for the constant propagandizing of the Catholic Church and the Jamaican government. The slogans that he referred to were those empty promises made from the pulpit of the church and the grandstand of the political rally. The Deluxe Editions Another series of releases that have come out after Bob’s death and are exemplary in quality and detail are the Deluxe Editions. Island and Tuff Gong records began re-releasing the classic Wailers’ material in 2001 and, thus far, have issued Catch a Fire, Exodus, Legend, Rastaman Vibra- tion, and Burnin’. These re-releases are unique in that they all contain the\n\nThe Legacy and the Legend 81 original album material in remastered clarity by producer Dill Levenson. The second CD of each set differs from one release to the next. For Catch a Fire, released in 2001, the second CD contained the previously unre- leased Jamaican versions of the songs that appeared on the original album. Additional songs on the first CD included versions of “High Tide or Low Tide” and “All Day, All Night.” The Exodus Deluxe Edition was also released in 2001. Again, the first disc contained the remastered versions of the original songs. However, in this case, Levenson added five alternate songs and versions of “Roots,” “Waiting in Vain,” “Jamming,” “Jamming (long version),” and “Exodus.” The second disc contained a combination of studio and live cuts. The studio offerings were recorded and produced by Lee “Scratch” Perry. Stu- dio songs on disc two included two versions of “Punky Reggae Party,” two cover versions of the Curtis Mayfield song “Keep On Moving,” and “Exodus.” The live songs were recorded at the Rainbow Theater show of the Exodus tour on June 4, 1977. Included were “The Heathen,” “Crazy Baldhead,” “War/No More Trouble,” “Jamming,” and “Exodus.” The next Deluxe Edition came out in 2002 with the re-release of Ras- taman Vibration. Again the first disc of the two-CD set contained the remastered versions of the songs on the original album. To this Levenson added eight additional songs recorded in Kingston or London at the same time as the original material was recorded. The second disc contained live performances from the Wailers May 26, 1976, show at the Roxy Theatre. Recorded during the Rastaman Vibration tour, the live material was an excellent testament to the quality and potency that Bob had achieved with this band. Additional tracks on the second disc of this set were two versions of the song “Smile Jamaica,” one labeled part one and the other labeled part two. The Deluxe Edition of Legend was also released in 2002. The first disc of digitally remastered tracks was accompanied by a second disc containing alternate versions of the original 16 songs. These versions were collected from remixing sessions dating from 1980 to 1984. The producers that re- mixed the material on the second disc include Paul “Graucho” Smykle, Errol Brown, Alex Sadkin, and Eric “E.T.” Thorngren. In keeping with the original release of this album, the Legend Deluxe Edition has been a consumer favorite. The most recent Deluxe Edition was released in 2004. The Burnin’ installment in this series contained the remastered tracks on the first disc with the addition of five songs produced at the time of the original ses- sions, but omitted at the time. Because Burnin’ was such an early album, two of the additional songs were written by other members of the original\n\n82 Bob M arley Wailers trio. “No Sympathy” was written by Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer wrote “Reincarnated Souls.” The second disc included a 12-song live set. The live tracks were recorded via the Island mobile studio at the Leeds show on November 23, 1973. All of the versions on this disc were previ- ously unreleased and represent the Wailers during their transitional phase after Peter and Bunny left the group. Although Bob has been dead for over 25 years, posthumous releases from the artist continue. The reggae superstar’s catalog is now several times the size it was at his passing and shows few signs of slowing down. Im- ports, bootlegs, live shows, and various types of compilations surface pro- gressively. In 2006 alone there were more than 12 full-length releases in Marley’s name. The market is completely flooded with Bob’s material and the commodification of the reggae legend is completely staggering. Bob’s Estate The topic of money turns to the handling of Bob’s business affairs after his death. As mentioned above, Bob died intestate (without a will). This left control of the largest third world music legacy and a multimillion-dollar estate in the hands of his wife Rita. There followed years of nasty legal battles for the proper distribution of royalties, property, and ownership. In the wake of Bob’s death, Rita moved the Tuff Gong Recording studios and production offices to 220 Marcus Garvey Drive, Kingston 11. The home offices of the Tuff Gong International are still at this location. Rita’s next step was the conversion of the house at 56 Hope Road into a museum and library where international guests are welcome to take guided tours of the property and house. Bob’s former dwelling now hosts thousands of tourists each year. The structure of the house remains un- changed since Bob’s passing, but several rooms have been altered to suit their specific purposes. The upstairs bedrooms have been converted into gallery space that contains a world map with all of Bob’s concert tour per- formance locations marked with colored thumb tacks. The second-story room that was once Ziggy’s bedroom has been converted into a makeshift business office and library. Here, books and newspaper articles about Bob and the Wailers are preserved and made available to investigators. Bob’s upstairs master bedroom remains in the same condition as it was when he last slept there. Although Bob was a very public person, this space gives tour participants a glimpse into the more private side of the man. The main floor of the house contains part of the original Tuff Gong recording studios. The studios remain in working order and are still in occasional use. Of particular interest is the kitchen. Preserved since the mid-1970s,\n\nThe Legacy and the Legend 83 the kitchen at the back of the house still exhibits the holes in the walls created by the bullets sprayed into the room during the 1976 assassination attempt. The grounds around the house at 56 Hope Road are now quite crowded. During Bob’s life, these grounds were used for parking spaces and as a soc- cer field. Now the grounds are covered with a variety of tourist attractions. At the edge of the yard is Rita’s Queen of Sheba Restaurant, where tradi- tional Ital food and fruit drinks are served. Behind the house, where there used to be rehearsal space, there is now a newer building used to house the Bob Marley Theatre. Along the side of the property is another relatively new building that houses the Things from Africa Boutique. Beyond the management of the property at 56 Hope Road, Rita suf- fered from lack of experience when handling Bob’s estate. Trouble arose with virtually every facet of the management of Bob’s vast empire. Money was misappropriated, relationships with members of the Wailers band were tarnished, and a great deal of time and money was spent trying to figure everything out. One serious misstep was taken in 1986, when the remaining members of the Wailers band were essentially forced into signing away their rights to future royalties for a flat fee. The amounts of money ended up being pennies on the dollars of the future, but were immediate payoffs. In 1987, Rita’s handling of the Marley estate again took a turn for the worse. Rita, her accountant Martin Zolt, and her lawyer David Stein- berg were collectively accused of fraud. Rumors had been swirling around Jamaica that Rita was hiding money in the Caymans and thus separat- ing Bob’s estate into taxable and untaxed income. At this point, Rita was taken out of the management role and replaced by a court-appointed bank administrator. This led to many problems in the Marley family, as their collective assets were frozen and even Cedella’s house in Miami was temporarily seized. The Legal Battle The details of much of the early proceedings from Rita, Zolt, and Steinberg’s trial are murky. However, it was found that the trio was guilty of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of the Racketeer Influ- enced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Because Bob died intes- tate, Jamaican law ruled that Rita was responsible for 10 percent of his estate outright, plus 45 percent held as a life interest. Bob’s 11 children were each entitled to equal shares of the remaining 45 percent outright, plus a remainder interest in Rita’s 45 percent life estate.\n\n84 Bob M arley Also discovered during these initial proceedings was the fact that from 1981 to 1986, those controlling Bob’s estate implemented several schemes that allegedly diverted foreign music assets and royalty income away from Bob’s estate and into accounts held outside the estate. Rita, Zolt, and Steinberg protested, saying that these diverted funds were used to establish new corporations for the purposes of minimizing tax liability and leaving more money for Bob’s beneficiaries. Lawyers for the State named at least four schemes and produced signed documents proving the collusion of the three implicated in the suit. In short, Rita and her representatives were not reporting the majority of the royalties that Bob’s music was earning. For a time, lawsuits, deceit, and chaos overshadowed Bob’s musical leg- acy. The end result of these legal machinations was that the Bob Marley estate was put up for sale as a unit by the Jamaican government. Chris Blackwell, Bob’s longtime friend and record company boss, purchased the ownership of the estate for the minuscule sum of 8.6 million dollars. Blackwell’s company, Island Logic Inc., was successful in the auction for Bob’s estate against the opposition of members of Bob’s own family. For 8.6 million dollars, Blackwell gained the rights to all of Bob’s songs, his re- cordings, and his future royalties. Subsequently, Blackwell sold the rights to Bob’s catalogue to the German record company Polygram in 1989. Poly- gram was absorbed by Seagrams in 1998, and the new music collective was named the Universal Music Group. Thus, Bob’s music changed hands yet again. Even through all of the legal difficulties and troubles with defining ownership, Bob’s legacy persisted. Although the initial licensing was lost, Bob’s family has remained well off financially, as they control all other aspects of his output. Also, unreleased material was not covered by the original court arrangement and through the surfacing of many additional versions and studio outtakes; much of Bob’s music is again controlled by his family. Regardless of where the ownership of Bob’s music lies, in his own words, his truest legacy was in his children.\n\nChapter 7 the marley family The two remaining matriarchs of the Marley family are the principal keepers of the family legacy. Bob’s mother Cedella and wife Rita continue to carry on Bob’s work even more than 25 years after his death. Although Cedella was not always active in Bob’s career during his life, she has be- come quite active after his death. As the oldest member of the Marley family, she is the protector of his legacy. Cedella Marley Booker Cedella Marley Booker (born July 23, 1926) still lives in the house that Bob bought her in Miami, Florida. She acts as the official matriarch of the family and is still involved in much of the business of the family. She has taken equal care of the children that Bob bore to Rita and his children born outside the marriage. As part of her nurturing of her son’s legacy, his mother has released two albums of her own music. In 1991, she issued Awake Zion on the RIOR label with the assistance of Bob’s old bass player, Aston “Family Man” Barrett. In the following year, she issued her second album, called Smilin’ Island Song. Cedella has also written several books on her son’s life. She authored the book Bob Marley: An Intimate Portrait by His Mother and another book, Bob Marley My Son. In addition, mother “Ciddy” has also toured widely, speak- ing on the importance of her famous son and singing her own songs. Her tours have taken her across the United States, through much of Western Europe, into Africa, around Mexico, and throughout the Caribbean. More 85\n\n86 Bob M arley recently, she has taken to producing hand-crafted dolls, which are sold though several Web sites. Rita Marley Rita Marley, born Alpharita Anderson in Cuba in on July 25, 1946, was the other principal leader of the Marley family. After Bob’s death, Rita’s legal problems mounted and she lost control of the Marley family fortune. However, in the aftermath of this initial loss, Rita was able to support herself and the family and to build a new fortune. One aspect of Rita’s furthering of Bob’s legacy was the release of her own music. In 1981 she released the album Who Feels It Knows It, in 1988 she released Harambe, and in 1988 she issued We Must Carry On. Rita began her musical career as the leader of her own band, and she returned to front woman form after her years singing backup to Bob. In the 1990s, Rita again issued a series of albums. These records were on the Shanachie imprint. Among these were Beauty of God, Good Girls Cult, and One Draw. These were followed by Sings Bob Marley . . . and Friends, Play Play, Sunshine After Rain, and Gifted Fourteen Carnation, all issued in the new millennium. Rita also released a book on her life with Bob that has the unique perspective of a woman interacting in a very male-dominated scene. The book, called No Woman, No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley, was co-authored with Hettie Jones. Recently, Rita has remained active in the music business largely through the activities of her many children. She is engaged in the fur- thering and protection of her husband’s legacy and attends annual worldwide birthday celebrations concerts in his honor. Rita has also es- tablished the Rita Marley Foundation to provide much needed supplies and infrastructural improvements to underdeveloped parts of Africa. The main goal of the group is to provide safe drinking water to the thousands of African people struggling for subsistence. In January 2005, Rita announced her intention to have Bob’s body removed from the mausoleum in Nine Mile and reburied in his spiritual home in Ethiopia. This news came as part of the month-long celebration of Bob’s 60th birthday. The move was backed by Ethiopian church and government officials. At the time, Rita asserted that it was part of Bob’s mission to return to Africa and the movement of his casket would fulfill the fallen reggae superstar’s intentions. Rita proposed to have Bob’s body reburied in Shashamani, about 155 miles south of Addis Ababa. Bob had visited this Rastafarian enclave on his first trip to Africa.\n\nThe Marley Family 87 Rita’s announcement was met with strong disagreement from many Jamaicans. Representatives of the Bob Marley Foundation immediately refuted Rita’s claims, saying there were no plans to move Bob. In fact, the news of a possible reburial created such a widespread outcry in opposition that Rita was forced to retract her earlier statement. First Rita said that no decision was yet made, and she eventually moved to the position that Bob’s remains would stay in Nine Mile. The uprising about the possible move did create a renewed interest in all things Marley leading up to his 60th birth- day celebration, but the concern was that this interest was more negative than positive. Regardless of possible missteps, Rita remains the focal point of the Marley family. She remains quite hands on with the management of the Marley legacy and has taken over the role of mother of all of Bob’s children without concern for Bob’s extramarital affairs. During his life, Bob continuously professed his love for children. He included in this not just his own children but the children of the world. With this in mind, one could see Bob’s most lasting legacy as his 11 chil- dren. Bob’s own thoughts on this were captured in his statement that he wanted to have as many children as there were shells on the beach. Regardless of moral codes, Bob fathered three children with Rita and ac- cepted two other children of hers as his own. Bob adopted Rita’s daughter Sharon, whose birth father was an unnamed man with whom Rita con- ceived her daughter prior to her meeting Bob. Rita’s daughter Stephanie was also unlikely to have been fathered by Bob. It has been generally ac- cepted that Stephanie’s father was a Rasta called Ital. Regardless of who their fathers were, Bob cared for these children as his own. During their marriage, Bob had several often highly publicized affairs. Many of these affairs yielded children who were eventually accepted, by Rita, into the extended Marley family unit. Other children that Bob fath­ ered were Damian, Rohan, Robbie, Karen, Julian, Ky-Mani, and Makeda Jahnesta. Each child had a unique position in Bob’s life and several of his children, both from his marriage to Rita and outside it, continue Bob’s musical legacy. Sharon Marley Although Bob was not the genetic father of Sharon (known as Sharon Marley Prendergrass), he treated her as a daughter throughout his life. He adopted her when he and Rita got married and doted on her constantly. Often described as Bob’s “favorite,” Sharon has spent her life forwarding many aspects of Bob’s vision. From 18 months of age onward, Bob was Sharon’s father, and as any good father would do, he attempted to guide\n\n88 Bob M arley her in her life’s pursuits. As she was growing up, the Marley household was always filled with music. As Bob’s fame grew, Sharon was increas­ ingly aware of life in the music world. However, her father cautioned her against going into music as a profession as he knew first hand how dif- ficult a business it is. Even with her father’s advice ringing in her ears, as an adult Sharon has had several jobs related to the music industry. She has helped to pre- serve Bob’s musical legacy as a member of the Marley children’s band, the Melody Makers. She is currently the director of the Bob Marley Mu- seum in Kingston, Jamaica, and she has pursued an acting career as part of the cast of the Denzel Washington/Robert Townshend movie The Mighty Quinn. Other aspects of Sharon’s professional life include her work with the Caribbean business Ghetto Youths International and her work in at- tempting to open a day care training center in Jamaica. The center would be the first of its kind on the island and reflects Bob’s interest in caring for children. Cedella The first child born of Bob and Rita’s marriage was named Cedella, after Bob’s mother. Cedella was born in August 1967 in Kingston and her birth corresponded with the release of the Wailers single. “Nice Time.” As a result, she was given the title of the song as a nickname. She grew up in a fairly traditional manner, attending attended public schools. Just as with Sharon, Bob wanted Cedella to become a doctor or a lawyer, but she followed her father’s footsteps into music. Musically, Cedella took a lead role in forming the Marley children’s group, the Melody Makers. She is known for her beautiful singing voice and is also a talented dancer. In addition to the Melody Makers, Cedella formed a splinter group called the Marley Girls. Her professional involve- ment with Bob’s legacy centers on her role as the CEO of Tuff Gong Inter- national. In addition to her recording, singing, and management of Bob’s record label, Cedella finds time to be active in raising her own group of Marley children. Known for her tenacity, Cedella aggressively works to safeguard and develop her father’s legacy. David (Ziggy) Sharon and Cedella’s next younger sibling is a brother, David, born on October 17, 1968. Although David was his given name, he was almost immediately nicknamed Ziggy and has been known by this name ever\n\nThe Marley Family 89 since. Again warned against following in his father’s musical footsteps, Ziggy was bitten by the musical bug as a youth. He grew up listening to his father’s music along with the material of legendary American artists such as Stevie Wonder. Music industry insiders consider Ziggy the natural heir to his father’s musical throne. He shares many of his father’s facial features and his voice is similar to Bob’s. Also, due to his age, he was able to witness and par- ticipate in parts of Bob’s musical odyssey. Ziggy was in Zimbabwe with his father for the concert celebrating the freedom of that country. Further, he became the de facto head of the family on his father’s passing. As such, he received Bob’s Order of Merit on behalf of his father. As a musician, Ziggy was the musical head of the Melody Makers. This point was made clear when the band began to be known as Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. Since his father’s death, Ziggy has been on an extended musical odyssey of his own. He worked with the Melody Makers through the release of seven studio albums (and several greatest hits col- lections) and has pursued a solo career, unlike many of the other Marley children. The premier Marley children’s musical group is the Melody Makers. The group consists of Sharon, Cedella, Ziggy, and Stephen. The group got its formal beginning when the members recorded a song that Bob had written for and about them in 1979, called “Children Playing in the Streets.” However, the group had unofficially been formed in 1981 to sing at Bob’s funeral. Since its inception, the Melody Makers have consistently put out salable reggae music that preserves their father’s legacy. Although the musical product of the group swerves from pop offerings to more seri- ous roots-sounding works, collectively the group’s output has been a testa- ment to its members’ musical heritage. Over the course of several decades, the Melody Makers have released several albums. Additionally, they have toured internationally and been part of the Reggae Sunsplash concert series that their father helped start. Their releases began in the mid-1980s with the album Play the Game Right. Their second release was 1986’s Hey World! This was followed by One Bright Day in 1988 and Conscious Party in 1989. The style of reggae music that the Melody Makers were putting out at this time was inspired by their father’s material, but did not sound much like it. However, the Melody Makers’ products were commercially viable and of high enough quality that they were in demand as singers and songwriters. Albums from the group continued to come out in the 1990s. Jahmekya was released in 1991 and was followed by Fallen Is Babylon in 1997. The 1999 album, Spirit of Music, was heralded as a return to conscious reggae\n\n90 Bob M arley roots for the group. Throughout these many releases, the Melody Makers have continued to forward their father’s, and by extension reggae music’s, cause of bringing conscious music to the masses. Interestingly, after Bob’s death, the prevalent type of Jamaican popular music turned way from roots reggae and toward the dancehall style. Dancehall has much more in common with American hip-hop than it does with the social or political themes in conscious reggae. With their music, the Melody Makers contin- ued to blaze the trail started by their father instead of falling in with the new style of the time. Within this context, Ziggy matured as a singer and songwriter. Taking a page from his father’s book of ambition, Ziggy set about the task of writing music that could reach a global audience. As a testament to his success, he has reached that audience and achieved an American Top 40 single. To say that Ziggy got an early start is to state the obvious. He was the natural front person for the Melody Makers with his father’s good looks and at- tractive voice, but he ended up fronting an internationally viable group at the tender age of 17. One might think that following in Bob’s footsteps made Ziggy’s movement into the music world easy. On the contrary, his father had established astonishingly large shoes to fill and Ziggy’s youthful songwriting skills were held up in comparison to Bob’s mature work. Early on, in order to carve out his own niche, Ziggy allowed his music to move more into popular mainstream circles. This resulted in harsh criticism from the roots reggae core; however, it was speculated that the young Marley was simply finding his own voice and separating himself from the enormous pressure of his father’s songwriting legacy. Another problem in Ziggy’s life at the time was the marked desire of EMI (the Melody Makers’ record label) to push Ziggy as a solo artist, instead of the leader of a group of his siblings. This conflict caused the group to switch to the Virgin Records label. The move to Virgin resulted in their most popular material to date. The songs on Conscious Party were a great success for the group. Produced with the assistance of Talking Heads band members Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, this release was both commercially and critically acclaimed. The album climbed to number 39 on the American popular music charts and affirmed that the Melody Makers were not just riding on their famous father’s coattails. The 1989 follow-up to Conscious Party, titled One Bright Day, was an- other big success for Ziggy and the Melody Makers. The album climbed into the American Top 20 and showed that the previous album had not been a fluke. Both of these late 1980s offerings won the group Grammy Awards for Best Reggae Album of the Year. The early 1990s brought\n\nThe Marley Family 91 continued success with the release of the Jahmekya album. The release sold well and made it into the Top 20; however, it did not have radio- friendly singles, unlike the previous two albums. The follow-up album, Joy and Blues of 1993, contained some dancehall style material that featured Stephen. The album did not sell well and marked the group’s departure from Virgin Records and their move to Elektra Records. For Elektra, the group released 1995’s Free Like We Want 2 B. With this, it seemed that Ziggy and the Melody Makers had regained some of their previous form. In 1997, Fallen Is Babylon won the group another Grammy Award and showed that Ziggy’s songwriting skills were still in top form. Through the course of these later releases, Ziggy emerged from the group as a soloist. The Melody Makers are still a group in name, but Ziggy had begun to work on individual recording projects. In addition to his solo work, Ziggy was becoming a leading political voice. He was named a Goodwill Youth Ambassador for the United Na- tions and spoke publicly on topics of injustice, poverty, and the third world. Additionally, he launched his own record label, called Ghetto Youths United (Ghetto Youth Crew), which he is using to foster the talent of the next generation of reggae artists. His charity work is well known and he has been involved in United Resources Giving Enlightenment (URGE), which performs community service in Jamaica. In the new millennium, Ziggy continued to emerge as a solo artist and leader of the next generation of Jamaican music. On April 15, 2003, he released his first official solo album, titled Dragonfly. The album cover de- picts Ziggy with dreadlocks to his waist and a dragonfly on a yellow back- ground. He was credited as the writer and singer for all 11 songs included on the release, which was met with a degree of success. Ziggy followed this up with a second solo release in 2006, called Love Is My Religion. In addition to music, Ziggy has pursued a varied career in the entertain- ment industry. In 2004, he voiced a Rasta jellyfish in the movie Shark Tale and together with Sean Paul created a new version of his father’s song “Three Little Birds” for the movie’s soundtrack. Ziggy also sang the theme song for the PBS show Arthur and continues to come into his own as a soloist. As he ages, his voice becomes more and more like his father’s as he grows into a leadership role in the international reggae community. Like Bob, Ziggy has fathered a significant group of children. With long- time companion Lorraine Bogle, Ziggy has three children, Daniel (a son), Justice (a daughter) and Zouri (a daughter). Ziggy is now married to Orly Agai, with whom he has had several other children. Judah Victoria is their daughter, born on April 7, 2005, and their son Gideon Robert Nesta Marley was born on January 5, 2007. While continuing to pursue his own\n\n92 Bob M arley career, charitable and philanthropic endeavors, and family interests, Ziggy remembers the words of his father: “every man has to stand up for his rights.” Stephen The next Marley child, and Bob’s second son, was Stephen, born April 20, 1972. Stephen was born in Wilmington, Delaware, while Rita was living there with Cedella. The youngest member of the Melody Mak- ers, Stephen has become an accomplished singer, DJ, writer, and pro- ducer. His earliest recordings were made at age six when he helped lay down the vocal tracks for “Children Playing in the Streets.” The song was recorded as a charity endeavor and the proceeds from the single were donated to the United Nations in support of the International Year of the Child. Additionally, Stephen danced and participated in Bob’s live shows, spending time on stage. In addition to an early life spent on stage with his father, at age seven Stephen began learning the acoustic guitar. Because of this early exposure to music, Stephen has been immersed in the art form and has been a professional musician for the majority of his years. In addition to his performing, he has been an integral part of the record label Ghetto Youths United. As a producer, Stephen has made several well-known remixes of his father’s work and coupled these with famous living singers such as Lauryn Hill (one of the three members of the Fugees). His work with Hill led to the Melody Makers performance with the Fugees at the 1997 Grammy Awards Show in New York City. Stephen’s production work began in 1996 when he filled the producer role for tracks on albums by his brothers Damian and Julian. His produc- tion work has also allowed Stephen to cross styles of music extensively. He has mixed reggae, hip-hop, and rhythm and blues. Work with hip-hop artists such as Krayzie Bones (from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony), Eve (of the hip-hop set the Ruff Ryders), and Erykah Badu has increased his creden- tials and connected his father’s legacy to current styles of music. As a producer, he worked on his brother Damian’s album Halfway Tree, released in 2001. The album was a huge success and scored a Grammy for the Best Reggae Album of the Year. His version of Stevie Wonder’s Bob Marley tribute song “Master Blaster” was of such quality that it was placed on the 2005 Wonder tribute album, Conception. As a songwriter, Stephen has not been as productive as some of his siblings. He began work on an album in 2002, but this was delayed by his work with the Ghetto Youths International production house. The album was meant to come out in 2006 under the title Got Music? Although the tracks\n\nThe Marley Family 93 were complete, Stephen opted not to release the album. Some speculation circulated that the album was put on hold to avoid conflicting with other Marley family records. Stephen is making 2007’s Mind Control his first official album-length release. He is currently streaming the album’s title track on his Myspace page and hopes are high for a successful, long- anticipated release. Although in his mid-thirties, Stephen already boasts a nearly three- decade-long career in music. As such, the release of his album has cre- ated significant interest. The album blends reggae, rock, rhythm and blues, nyabinghi, flamenco, and hip-hop into a unique and unnamed hybrid. As is customary in contemporary American hip-hop, the Mind Control album features various cameo appearances including those of Ben Harper, Mos Def, Damian Marley, Maya Azucena and Illestr8, Spragga Benz, and Mr. Cheeks. Through the course of his career, Stephen has done wonders to en- hance Bob’s musical legacy in the area of introducing his father’s music to a whole new audience. Stephen is a five-time Grammy winner in his own right and is still at the beginning of what promises to be a long and fruitful career. Stephen’s defiant attitude and distaste for underhanded political dealings are present in his lyrics and he puts forward his father’s message throughout. To help preserve the legacy, Stephen was part of two Ameri- can tours in 2006. Most notable was the critically acclaimed Bob Marley Roots, Rock Reggae Festival, which also included his brother Ziggy. This tour placed Stephen on stage with one of his father’s oldest friends and one-third of the original Wailers singing trio, Bunny Wailer. As is true of most of the Marley children, Stephen has children of his own. For a time he was married to Kertie DaCosta and together they had a son, Jeremiah, and a daughter, Sasha. Additionally, he had four other children from various relationships. His other children are sons Joseph, Stephan, and Yohan, and a daughter called Summer. Stephen’s current relationship is with fashion designer and singer Kristina Marawski, with whom he recently had a daughter called Zipporah. Stephanie Another Marley daughter was Stephanie, born in 1974. There are sev- eral conflicting reports concerning her lineage. Some say that Bob was her father, and others report that her father was a local Rasta called Ital. Rita reported, in her book No Woman No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley, that Stephanie’s father was probably Bob. However, at this time, Rita and Bob were not getting along and Rita had entered into a relationship with\n\n94 Bob M arley a local Rasta called Tacky. This local Rasta called Tacky was, in fact, the Jamaican soccer star Owen Stewart. In the account in her book, Rita was very careful never to say that she and Tacky had had a sexual relationship; however, it was implied. Regardless of who her biological father was, Stephanie was born on August 17, 1974, and Bob was her father to all intents and purposes. She grew up in Kingston and was educated in Jamaican primary and secondary schools. She moved to England and completed her A-level studies in psy- chology and social studies in London. Next, Stephanie studied psychology at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. She earned her bachelor’s degree with honors and during her studies she was active with local chil- dren’s groups. She paid extra attention to children with special needs. After university, Stephanie returned to Jamaica and became part of the family business. She became the managing director of the Bob Mar- ley Foundation, Bob Marley Museum, Tuff Gong International, Tuff Gong Recordings, URGE,. and the Rita Marley Foundation. With this work Stephanie also fostered her father’s legacy. Now living in Nassau in the Bahamas, Stephanie is directing the construction of the first Marley Resort and Spa. Although more attuned to the business end of things, Stephanie promoted concerts through Tuff Gong Productions and she stages the an- nual Reggae All-Star Concert in Nassau. In addition, Stephanie has four children, all boys. The rest of the Marley children were fathered by Bob, but in relation- ships outside his marriage. Each child had a different mother; however, since Bob’s death, Rita has become the mother figure to most of Bob’s offspring. Bob had extramarital affairs with seven women who produced children. Some of his relationships were highly publicized, such as the “Beauty and the Beast” union with Cindy Breakspeare. Other child- producing encounters were fleeting and poorly documented, such as those with Evette Morris (Crichton) and Janet Hunt (Dunn). The children that were produced by these unions have been equally responsible for fostering their father’s legacy and many of them have made their own deep impact on the music world. Rohan Bob met Janet Hunt (or possibly Dunn) in the early 1970s. Janet was a dancer in a club and caught Bob’s eye. Little was documented about their encounter; however, Janet gave birth to Bob’s son Rohan as a result. Rohan Anthony Marley was born in May 1972, and his mother turned the boy over to Bob and Rita to raise when he was four. From this time,\n\nThe Marley Family 95 Rohan officially became a Marley. He went to the same school as Ziggy and Stephen. Unlike his brothers, however, Rohan was more into sports than music. The Marley family had trouble keeping track of this active youth and he was sent to live with Bob’s mother in Miami. Cedella adopted Rohan and he flourished under her care. He graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in 1991 and he enrolled at the University of Miami where he played linebacker for the Hurricanes foot- ball team. Rohan then had a short stint with the Ottowa Rough Riders professional football team in the Canadian Football League. After his time playing football, Rohan decided to settle down and refocus his energy. More recently, Rohan married Lauryn Hill and began working in the Marley family businesses. For his part, Rohan preserves Bob’s memory through his work with the Tuff Gong Clothing Company. Rohan styles clothes that are meant to have universal appeal, just like his father’s music. In addition to his work with the clothing line, Rohan spends time with his own group of Bob’s grandchildren. He has four children with Lauryn, sons Zion David, Joshua, and John, and a daughter named Selah Louise. Robert (Robbie) Bob’s next child was born of his affair with a woman named Pat Wil- liams. Williams was a woman from Trench Town and little is known of her. In fact, there are conflicting reports on her first name: some say Pat, some say Lucille. However, the story of her short time together with Bob was documented in his song “Midnight Ravers.” The reports of the eve- ning and the song itself described the scene. Bob had apparently been standing naked in the moonlit night at the house at 56 Hope Road. He was approached by Williams at that time and she seduced him. The next day, Bob woke up and wrote the lyrics to “Midnight Ravers” on a Kingston phone book. Robert Nesta Marley II, known as Robbie, was the product of this rendezvous. Robbie, like many of the other children produced by Bob’s affairs, came under the care of Rita. With Rita’s and the Marley family’s support, Rob- bie attended the University College of the West Indies, where he studied computer graphics. Since then, Robbie has been involved in several ac- tivities. He runs a clothing store in Miami, Florida, called Vintage Marley. He took up motorcycle riding and has subsequently become an accom- plished stunt rider. This led him to a bit role in the 2003 movie, 2 Fast 2 Furious. Additionally, he has a motorcycle riding club called the Miami Warriors. The Marley family tree continues to grow with Robbie’s four children: Kaya, Ekitai, and twins Regal and Robert.\n\n96 Bob M arley Karen Bob’s tryst with a woman named Janet Bowen led to another Marley family child. Again, details on Janet are sketchy, but she is referred to as “Janet in England” in several sources. Janet gave birth to a daugh- ter named Karen in 1973. Janet and Karen both remain shrouded in mystery, as neither has sought out the spotlight. Janet lived in Jamaica with her great-grandmother in Harbor View, St. Andrews. This is where she grew up and went to school. Her involvement with the Marley fam- ily has been slight. She was a reportedly a regular visitor to the Marley home in Kingston, but Karen did not fall in with the other children. When Bob’s health failed, he asked Rita to look after Karen and she sent Karen to school with Stephanie. Because Karen has pursued a life outside the glare and scrutiny of the public eye, little else is known about her present life. Julian Lucy Pounder was a resident of Barbados and, while little is known of her time with Bob, it did produce Julian Marley on June 4, 1975. Julian was born and raised in London, but often spent time with Rita and the other Marley children in Jamaica and Miami. Following in this musical family’s footsteps, Julian studied bass, drums, and keyboard from an early age. He also became an accomplished songwriter as a youth. His first sin- gle, at age five, was a version of his father’s song “Slave Driver,” recorded at the Marley family’s Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston. This was just the first step in a busy and fruitful career. In the 1990s, Julian asserted his musical strength at full potential. He formed his own band, called the Uprising band, and released the 1996 album Lion in the Morning. Julian was credited with writing or co-writing all of the songs on the album, which received critical acclaim. In his fa- ther’s mold, Julian toured in support of the release and played internation- ally as a soloist backed by the Uprising band and as a member of Ghetto Youths International. As a member of Ghetto Youths, he interacted with his brothers Stephen and Damian and learned a great deal. With Damian, Julian opened for Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers on the 1995 tour and was a featured artist on the 1999 Lollapalooza Festival Tour (which was quite a coup as this was a rock-oriented tour). The new millennium found Julian ready for the next challenge. Julian worked with his Marley brothers to produce the platinum-selling Chant Down Babylon album, which paired modern artists with Bob from beyond\n\nThe Marley Family 97 the grave. He was also a part of the “Master Blaster” Stevie Wonder trib- ute song with his brothers Stephen, Damian, and Ky-Mani. Julian’s more recent project was the 2003 album Time and Place. The sound of the album was a mixture of roots reggae and light jazz. According to Julian himself, the album was another step in his songwriting progression begun with Lion in the Morning. With the conscious and politically charged lyrics of his father and brothers ringing in his ears, Julian forwarded his Rastafar- ian and often militant messages. Also in keeping with the Marley family mold, the songs on this release are a varied blend of reggae, funk, hip-hop, and rhythm and blues. The Time and Place album was produced by Julian, Stephen, and Da- mian. Ziggy and Rohan both appeared on the album, supplying percus- sion lines. Bob’s old Wailers band compatriot, Bunny Wailer, also supplied some percussion material. The Uprising band also appeared on the album. In the wake of the release, Julian toured to support the album and the Uprising band backed him up. Julian is outstanding among the Marley children for his personality, presence, and musical talent. He applies his energy tirelessly to the furthering of his father’s musical legacy. Ky-Mani Ky-Mani Marley was a product of the affair that Bob had with Anita Belnavis. Belnavis was a well-known Caribbean table tennis champion. Ky-Mani means “adventurous traveler” and so far that is exactly what he has been. Belnavis’s life went largely undocumented, but much is known about her famous son. Ky-Mani Marley was born in Falmouth, Jamaica, where he lived until age nine. At that time he moved to the inner city of Miami, where he spent time engaged in sports. As a youth, he began studying music, taking piano and guitar lessons, and he played trumpet in his high school band. Although he studied music, his first love was sports and he played high school football and soccer. Growing up, Ky-Mani spent summers with his father, Rita, and the other Marley children. In fact, in 1992, Ky-Mani moved to Jamaica to be closer to the Marley family. His first excursion into music came while he was still in Miami. He began rapping and DJ-ing and actually recorded a single called “Unnecessary Badness.” On his move back to Jamaica, Ky-Mani dedicated himself to music. He worked with Stephen, Julian, and Damian to produce his own musical product. Early in his musical growth, Ky-Mani released several singles on the Shang Records imprint. He did a version of “Judge Not” with dancehall queen Patra, which was followed by the song “Dear Dad.” This second\n\n98 Bob M arley single was an open letter to his fallen father. Sentimental and thought provoking, “Dear Dad” was an early testament to Ky-Mani’s songwriting ability. Picking up momentum, Ky-Mani teamed up with a third of the American band the Fugees when he worked with Praswell on a cover of the Eddy Grant hit “Electric Avenue.” Major international exposure came when Ky-Mani performed at the Midem (short for Marché international de l’édition musicale), the world’s largest music industry trade fair. His Midem performance was aired live by the Caribbean News Agency and Ky-Mani was instantly exposed to audience members in 36 countries. Ky-Mani’s international television appearance created unprecedented interest in the young singer. A label bidding war ensued, and Ky-Mani signed with Gee Street/V2 Records. For Gee Street, he teamed with P.M. Dawn on the single “Gotta Be Movin On Up,” which only increased Ky- Mani’s already rising stock. He further increased the interest in his music with the release of his 1999 solo debut album, Ky-Mani Marley: Like Fa- ther Like Son. This was followed the next year with The Journey, which illustrated beautifully Ky-Mani’s versatile style. Moving between Spanish guitar, rock steady, and lovers rock, the songs on the album are as eclectic as Ky-Mani’s taste. The next album released by Ky-Mani was Many More Roads in 2001 Here the talented singer/songwriter presented material dipped in the roots reggae, dancehall, and rhythm and blues styles. Throughout this album, Ky-Mani delivered a message of consciousness and stayed true to his Rastafarian faith. More recent projects found Ky-Mani trying his hand in show business. He played the lead role in the hit underground Jamaican movie Shottas, in which he worked opposite Wyclef Jean (of Fugees fame) and dancehall mainstay Spragga Benz. He also starred in the movie One Love, a roman- tic comedy that paired him with Cherine Anderson. In 2004, Ky-Mani landed another movie role, playing John the Baptist in the Frank E. Flow- ers movie Haven. Here the young Rasta played alongside Bill Paxton and Orlando Bloom. Ky-Mani remains enthusiastic about his role in main- taining Bob’s musical fame. He has already done much to preserve the family name and further work is anticipated. Damian Cindy Breakspeare was the woman most often associated with Bob apart from Rita. Breakspeare was from a white, upper-class background and was working in Kingston in the mid-1970s when she met Bob. As a teenager, she worked at the Kingston Sheraton and met Bob as they\n\nThe Marley Family 99 were both tenants in Blackwell’s house at 56 Hope Road. At first, Bob and Break­speare did not interact much. It was rumored that Bob made many attempts at gaining Breakspeare’s affection, but she rebuked him. Bob’s song “Waiting in Vain” was said to be about these rejected ad- vances. However, as Bob’s success increased, Cindy gradually warmed to his attention. Breakspeare’s rise to fame paralleled Bob’s. A classic beauty, through the mid-1970s Breakspeare went from Miss Jamaican Bikini to Miss Uni- verse Bikini to Miss World. She was also accused of being a home wrecker due to her association with Bob. However, history is clear that Bob pur- sued Breakspeare and early on she did not know that he was married. The period during which the two spent the most time was Bob’s self-imposed exile from Jamaica after the assassination attempt. Bob’s interest in Breakspeare was somewhat contradictory to the phi­ losophy of the rest of his life. Breakspeare was all things representing Bab- ylon, in that she came from a wealthy white family and she surrounded herself with issues of vanity. As such, she was more concerned with winning beauty contests, such as Miss Jamaica Body Beautiful and Miss Universe Bikini, than with the plight of the black Jamaican underclass. However, Bob was not attracted to her only physically, but also because of her honesty. Because of this, Bob lavished attention on her that he did not on lavish any other woman. He bought her a house in the Cherry Gardens section of Kingston and gave her money to start her own busi- ness. Unlike his relationship with anyone other than Rita, when Bob and Breakspeare’s sexual relationship ended they remained friends for the rest of Bob’s life. Breakespeare went on to marry jazz guitarist and pilot Rupert Bent. They live in the Stony Hill area of Jamaica and she remains busy. In ad- dition to a singing career, through which she met her current husband, she maintains the Ital craft shop that Bob gave her the capital to start. Additionally, Cindy is the mother of Bob’s son Damian “Junior Gong” Marley. Damian was born in 1978 in Jamaica and has carved out quite a niche in the Jamaican music industry. The Junior Gong is the youngest Marley child by any mother. Like his brothers and sisters, Damian got an early start in music. He began performing at age 13 when he formed the Shepherds band. The group had local success and even performed at Reggae Bash in 1992 and at the 1992 installment of Reggae Sunsplash. Damian often performed around his older brothers and sisters as he frequently served as the open- ing act for Melody Makers concerts. By 1994, Damian was already working to establish a solo reputation. In 1996, he released his solo debut album,\n\n100 Bob Marley Mr. Marley. Although it was a solo album, Damian’s brother Stephen appeared on several songs and served as the producer. The release came out as an offering from the Ghetto Youths International label. In 2001, Damian came into his own with his second solo record, Half- way Tree. The album earned the young singer a Grammy Award for the Best Reggae Album of the Year and saw Damian flexing his now powerful songwriting muscles. The biggest difficulty with the release was that it was largely ignored by the record-buying public. That all changed when Damian released Welcome to Jamrock in 2005. This release was afforded significant pre-release buzz and was immediately popular when it hit the streets. The title track came out in remixes and alternate versions right away, and the album made it into the Top 10. The album mixed hard- hitting lyrics about the realities of life with eclectic music that blended reggae, hip-hop, rhythm and blues, and dancehall. Again it was a solo release, but Damian credited Stephen as the co- producer of the album. The production style is reminiscent of roots reggae stalwarts Sly and Robbie. The album was again released on the family’s Tuff Gong/Ghetto Youths International label and revealed another of the Marley children coming into their own. In the light of his father’s legacy, Damian’s latest release mixed songs of protest with songs of love and again forwarded Bob’s music and message. Damian’s most popular (and as yet most commercially viable) material echoed the sentiments of his father at his most militant. “Welcome to Jamrock” was a fiery and outraged description of the underprivileged held in bondage by the political system in Jamaica. This has not escaped the youngest Marley’s attention. Damian has worked long and hard to make his music resonate on the streets and he has achieved that goal with his most recent offerings. Makeda Jahnesta The last of the recognized Marley children was born in 1981. Makeda Jahnesta Marley was the product of an encounter between the reggae superstar and a woman named Yvette Crichton. Nothing was documented about this union beyond the notable product. The first name of the young- est of Bob’s children was taken from the Bible and was also the Ethiopian name for the Queen of Sheba. Her middle name combines the Rastafar- ian word for God and her father’s middle name. Makeda does not seem to have made a life in the limelight and little is known about her other than the fact that by 1992 she became an official beneficiary of the Marley estate and from that time forward was a regular at Rita’s house.\n\nThe Marley Family 101 Recent Developments A particularly strange twist in Bob’s life after death was announced in late 2006. Rita has planned a new Bob Marley biopic that will cover his life prior to his becoming famous. Oscar Award–nominated director Ra- chid Bauchareb (Dust of Life) has been tapped as the director. However, the biggest point of contention has been Rita’s choice of Jamie Foxx to play the young Bob. While Foxx received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ray Charles, it is unlikely that he can carry off a 16-year-old Marley. Due to this dubious choice, the film is already being heavily criticized and has only just gone into pre-production in early 2007. And still the legend lives on. Beyond his fame, his legacy, his children, and his music, Bob’s name itself continues to be praised and celebrated. The memory of the man continues to draw interest around the world. In fact, each year there are international concerts commemorating his birthday. Contrary to conventional wisdom (that eventually Bob will be forgotten), the concerts grow large and swell with more and more attendees annually. One particularly interesting example was the celebration of Bob’s 60th birthday in 2005. The official, and largest, celebration took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and was accompanied by a three-day conference about all things associated with Bob. Luminaries who were active in the confer- ence included American actor Danny Glover, members of the Ethiopian government, Madame Winnie Mandela, Cedella Marley, Maya Angelou, India Irie, Ziggy Marley, and Angelique Kidjo. Performers who graced the stage during the celebration included Baaba Maal, Youssou N’Dour, An- gelique Kidjo, Tagass King, and Rita and Ziggy Marley. The event centered on the conference in Ethiopia, but there were simultaneous celebrations around the world. The Bob Marley Foundation promoted 60th birthday events in the United States, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and South Africa. The 2007 Bob Marley 62nd birthday celebration was another major event. For this, Stephen, Julian, Damian, and Ky-Mani staged a concert on February 10 called “Smile Jamaica.” The concert was staged at the Marley ancestral home in Nine Mile, St. Ann Parish, Jamaica. The Mar- ley sons took the concert’s name from a like performance that their father gave in 1976. At that original concert, Bob was spreading the message of peace and now his sons have taken up that mission. The concert was pur- posely set to coincide with Bob Marley week, when the largest number of tourists visit Jamaica. With this, the joy and the message of Bob’s life and music continue. His legacy is in the capable hands of his children and he is not forgotten. Robert Nesta Marley’s music lives on in a variety of forms from Nine Mile to Kingston, from Miami to New York, from Jamaica to the rest of the world.\n\n102\n\nSelected Discography The Best of the Wailers 1970/ Kong / Beverley’s/BLP 001 Soul Shakedown Party, Stop That Train, Caution, Soul Captives, Go Tell It on the Mountain, Can’t You See, Soon Come, Cheer Up, Back Out, Do It Twice Catch a Fire 1972 (April)/Marley and Blackwell/Island/ILPS 9241 Concrete Jungle, Slave Driver, 400 Years, Stop That Train, Baby We’ve Got a Date, Stir It Up, Kinky Reggae, No More Trouble, Midnight Ravers Burnin’ 1973 (November)/Wailers and Blackwell/Island/ILPS 9256 Get Up, Stand Up, Hallelujah Time, I Shot the Sheriff, Burnin’ and Lootin’, Put It On, Small Axe, Pass It On, Duppy Conqueror, One Foundation, Rasta Man Chant African Herbsman 1973/Perry/Trojan/TRLS 62 Lively Up Yourself, Small Axe, Duppy Conqueror, Trench Town Rock, Af- rican Herbsman, Keep On Moving, Fussing and Fighting, Stand Alone, All in One, Don’t Rock My Boat, Put It On, Sun Is Shining, Kaya, Riding High, Brain Washing, 400 Years Natty Dread 1974 (October)/Blackwell and the Wailers/Island/ILPS 9281 Lively Up Yourself, No Woman, No Cry, Them Belly Full (But We Hungry), Rebel Music (Three O’Clock Road Block), So Jah Seh, Natty Dread, Bend Down Low, Talkin’ Blues, Revolution Live!
