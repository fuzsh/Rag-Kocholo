(Note: some websites insist the single was released July 28. \"Tell Her About It\" debuted on the chart July 30.

(Note: some websites naively report the single was re-released August 20. \"Red Red Wine\" debuted on the Singles chart on August 13. It is physically impossible for a song to be included on the Singles chart if it has not been released as a single.)\n\n1992: Neil Diamond's Greatest Hits 1966-1992 set the pace on the U.K. Album chart.\n\n1992: Boyz II Men moved from #53 to 32 on this date with \"End Of The Road\".\n\n1992: Tom Cochrane, former lead singer of Red Rider (\"White Hot\" and \"Lunatic Fringe\") cracked the Top 10 as a solo artist with \"Life Is A Highway\".\n\n1992: \"The One\" by Elton John was the new #1 song on the Adult Contemporary chart, Elton's 12th #1 for the genre.\n\n1995: Charlie Rich died of a blood clot in his lung at a motel in Hammond, Louisiana at the age of 62. (Note: some websites insist he died July 24, but according to the newspaper 'The New York Times' and other reputable sources, Charlie died July 25.)\n\n1999: They tried to copy the original but failed miserably.

When they got into Carey's hotel suite, they found that she had broken down into hysterics and had intentionally broken scores of dishes and glasses in the kitchenette. Carey suffered several cuts on her body and was checked into a hospital shortly after midnight on July 26 for \"extreme exhaustion\". (Note: several websites report the outburst occurred on July 27, but it was on July 25, according to ABC News, CBS News, and numerous other credible sources.)\n\n2003: Nelly performed at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\n\n2003: Erik Brann, guitarist for Iron Butterfly, died of heart failure in Los Angeles at the age of 52.\n\n2003: Mariah Carey opened a tour of North America at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Paradise, Nevada.\n\n2003: A poll by long-time radio station heavyweight KIIS in Los Angeles found that Americans believed Eminem was \"more truthful\" than U.S. President George W.

(Note: several websites report that Bennie Benjamin was born this date and played drums for Motown. Bennie Benjamin, who was born on November 4, 1907, was a songwriter who began writing songs in 1941 and later became a music publisher--he never played drums. The only person born on this date who played drums for Motown was Benny Benjamin.)\n\n1941: Manny Charlton, founder and guitarist of Nazareth, was born in La Línea de la Concepción, Spain.\n\n1942: Bruce Woodley, founding member of the Seekers, was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\n\n1943: Jim McCarty, drummer of the Yardbirds, was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England.\n\n1944: Tom Dawes of Cyrkle (\"Red Rubber Ball\" from 1966), who also composed some of the best-known advertising jingles (\"Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz” for Alka-Seltzer and “7Up, the Uncola,”), was born in Albany, New York; died of a stroke October 13, 2007 after carotid artery surgery in Manhattan, New York.\n\n1946: Jose \"Chepito\" Areas, percussionist of Santana, was born in León, Nicaragua.\n\n1948: Steve Goodman, who wrote \"The City Of New Orleans\" for Arlo Guthrie, was born in Chicago, Illinois; died of leukemia September 20, 1984 in Seattle, Washington.\n\n1950: Mark Clarke, bass guitarist of Uriah Heap and Mountain, was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England\n\n1951: Verdine White, bassist of Earth, Wind & Fire, was born in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n1958: Thurston Moore, singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth, was born in Coral Gables, Florida.\n\n1960: Paul Geary, co-founder and drummer of Extreme (\"More Than Words\"), was born in Medford, Massachusetts."
