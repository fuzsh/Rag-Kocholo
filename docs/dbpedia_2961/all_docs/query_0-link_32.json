        "text": "WHEN Mick Hucknall, the soulful lead singer and chief songwriter of the British pop group Simply Red, flew to Los Angeles last month to appear on the Grammy telecast, he set about getting autographs feeling, he said, ''like a little kid in a candy store.''\n\n''I went up to Al Green and told him, 'I think you're the greatest living singer,' '' the 26-year-old Manchester-born musician recalled the other day in a telephone interview. ''He is at the top of a very long list of idols, many of whom were there.''\n\nWith the hit singles ''Money's Too Tight (to Mention)'' and ''Holding Back the Years,'' Mr. Hucknall last year became the newest sensation in the continuing procession of young English pop performers for whom American soul music has been a primary inspiration. Mr. Hucknall's voice is especially distinctive because it is so high: a craggy, husky countertenor that communicates a keening pathos.\n\nThis week Elektra Records is releasing Simply Red's ''Men and Women,'' the followup to its debut album, ''Picture Book,'' which sold 800,000 copies. Produced by Alex Sadkin, who oversaw many of Duran Duran's hits, the record is an engaging collection of commercial pop-funk songs augmented by two poignant ballads.\n\nAmong the the high points of ''Men and Women'' are intriguing cover versions of vintage funk and pop fare. Mr. Hucknall and his sextet have revamped Sly and the Family Stone's funk anthem ''Let Me Have It All'' from the group's 1973 album, ''Fresh.'' Even more striking is Mr. Hucknall's morose rendition of Cole Porter's 1944 standard, ''Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,'' arranged for voice, piano, and cello.\n\n''I discovered the song on 'Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook' at around the same time I was listening to an instrumental version of the same song by John Coltrane,'' Mr. Hucknall said. ''Though I don't think most pop singers do well with jazz songs, it became such an obession that I had to record it.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
