Trevor Thompson is proud to join the KOB 4 news team where viewers can watch him as an evening co-anchor with Tessa Mentus. He will also be reporting weekly on a variety of topics.

Trevor spent the past several years in El Paso; first anchoring the sports desk and finally becoming a news anchor. Then he decided to take the short four-hour drive up to Albuquerque – and make a career move.

Trevor and his wife Natassia are excited to introduce their two children, Nathan and Natalia, to everything New Mexico has to offer.

His family has always enjoyed taking trips to see the sights of New Mexico from Santa Fe and Albuquerque to Ruidoso and Cloudcroft, and now he’s honored to be able to share the stories, culture, and history found in these enchanting places.

Whether it’s taking in a game at The Pit or taking a moment to explore the incredible art on Canyon Road, there’s no shortage of things to see and do.

Trevor is originally from Santa Clarita, California, and he attended the University of Southern California, graduating with a degree in broadcast journalism. His early days in broadcasting after college were spent in places such as Bakersfield, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.

Trevor’s free time is centered around his family, but he also enjoys hiking and exploring different types of food.

He welcomes any story suggestions — or any tips on the best places to eat or hike. He can always be reached at trevor.thompson@kob.com.
