        "text": "Trevor Thompson:\n\nI spent my life always looking for what was next, what I could attempt and excel at, through my lust for life and energetic pursuit of knowledge I became a student at the prestigious School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006. While pursuing my aspirations in Fine Art I became dissatisfied with a life lived without commitment to and service for the Country I was living in a reaping the great benefits of.\n\nIn the fall of 2007 I enlisted in the US Navy with the ultimate goal of becoming a Navy SEAL, the elite counter terrorism and amphibious \"Frogmen\" of the US Military. Graduating with BUD/s class 272 and continuing on into and through SQT, graduating as a SEAL in the spring of 2009 and immediately was thrust into a life of action and service with SDVT-1 (SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 1) in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. While at the SEAL Team in Hawaii I gained interest in skydiving and B.A.S.E. jumping, driving a passion for exploration and adventure further in my time between completing 3 deployments overseas.\n\nThe last few years, until my decision to drive forward into civilian life, I was a member of the nationally acclaimed US Navy Parachute Team, the \"Leap Frogs\". Completing hundreds of intense demonstrations. Through my time on the team being front of and speaking to large public group became a deep passion.\n\nI intend to pass along my knowledge, skills, and experience to those willing to listen and to those who wish to be students, I am ALWAYS a student."
