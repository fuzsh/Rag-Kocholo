In addition to accomplishing a multitude of athletic feats, many of the exploits of African American athletes have helped to spur societal changes. The integration of baseball in 1947 by Jackie Robinson and the legacy of heavyweight champion Joe Louis helped to launch the Civil Rights movement. Additionally, the rise in black nationalism of the 1960s and 1970s was projected by the words and deeds of African American athletes, such as Muhammad Ali, Wilt Chamberlain, and Curt Flood.\n\nProfessional and some amateur sports have also given African Americans the opportunity for instant fame and wealth afforded by few other venues. For some, success on the athletic field carries over into the private sector, as many African American athletes have used their wealth and clout to start businesses and give back to the community. As the twenty-first century begins, however, a major obstacle exists—few African Americans have been given employment in front office positions or been granted ownership of professional sports teams.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nProfessional baseball began in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1846. The game was dominated by amateurs and roving semi-professionals until the National League was formed in 1876. Initially, there was no prohibition against African Americans playing in the National League or its rivals—the American Association, the Union League, and the Players League. Moses Fleetwood Walker was the first prominent African American professional baseball player during the 1880s for the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. However, in an exhibition game with a National League team, the Chicago White Stockings, the “color line” was drawn in baseball for the first time. White Stockings player/manager Cap Anson refused to play on the same field with Walker. Later, when Anson heard an African American was about to be signed in the National League, he used his influence to initiate a “gentlemen’s agreement” among the teams not to sign any African American players. This agreement became the standard in organized baseball.\n\nEfforts to sneak African Americans into the major leagues under the guise of being Cuban or American Indians failed. Until the 1920s, the only way for African Americans to play baseball was as semi-professionals touring and playing wherever they got the chance. As the 1920s dawned, an organized, professional Negro League was established by Rube Foster and others to give African Americans the chance to play big league baseball. The Negro League featured teams such as the Detroit Stars, Homestead Grays, New York Elite Giants, and others that played wherever they could find a stadium and funding. They frequently filled Major League Baseball stadiums when given the chance and the quality of their product was evidenced by such Hall of Fame players as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Ray Dandridge, “Cool Papa” Bell, Oscar Charleston, Buck Leonard, and Judy Johnson.\n\nThe Negro League was never financially stable, however, and teams frequently folded. Many chose to—or felt their best option was to—play for pay in Cuba or the Dominican Republic. Despite efforts by Major League Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis to stop them, many exhibition games were arranged between Negro League and Major League All-Star teams. The exhibitions were competitive and the Negro League players demonstrated their skill by winning many of the contests. As long as Landis was commissioner of Major League Baseball, however, integration was impossible.\n\nIn 1945, following the death of Landis and the appointment of Happy Chandler as commissioner, Brooklyn Dodger general manager and part-owner Branch Rickey began a search for an African American to integrate Major League Baseball. He settled on UCLA alumnus Jackie Robinson. In 1946, Robinson played for the Dodgers top minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, he integrated baseball despite virulent opposition from players, teammates, and all of the other Major League Baseball owners. Robinson was named the National League’s Rookie of the Year in 1947 and won the Most Valuable Player award in 1949. The Cleveland Indians integrated the American League in 1947 with Larry Doby.\n\nBy 1958, all Major League Baseball teams had integrated their rosters and African American players became stars in both leagues. In 1975, Frank Robinson became the first African American manager of a Major League Baseball team with the Cleveland Indians. However, baseball’s front office positions remained closed to African Americans as the game features few African American managers or general managers. The power structure changed slightly in the 1988 when former player Bill White became the first African American to be president of the National League. White was succeeded in 1994 by another African American, Leonard Coleman.\n\nIn addition, many of baseball’s top stars have been African American. Hank Aaron became baseball’s all-time home run leader and drove in more runs than anyone in history. Rickey Henderson holds the record for most steals, and Lee Smith has more saves than any other player. Additionally, African American players have been the recipients of the Most Valuable Player Award in the American or National League over 35 percent of the time during the last half century.\n\nCurt Flood also changed the face of baseball. In 1969, Flood decided to challenge his trade from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Philadelphia Phillies on the grounds that baseball’s reserve clause—binding players to their existing teams—was in violation of federal antitrust laws. A lawsuit brought by Flood was eventually heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against Flood and decided that baseball could retain its posture as the only professional sport exempted from federal antitrust legislation. Shortly after the decision, an agreement between the players and management ended the reserve system and established free agency.\n\nThe percentage of African American players in Major League Baseball has declined since its peak in the 1970s. One factor responsible for this change is the streamlining of inner city baseball programs and urban little leagues due to financial problems. The economic situation has become so bad in some American cities that even scholastic athletic programs are threatened with cutbacks or dissolution. Nevertheless, many of the game’s top players are African American, including Barry Bonds, Mike Cameron, Cliff Floyd, Ken Griffey Jr., Derek Jeter, and Gary Sheffield.\n\nIn 1997—the 50th anniversary of the the game being racially integrated—Major League Baseball took action to honor Jackie Robinson’s feat. Commissioner Bud Selig retired his number 42 from use by any baseball team. President Bill Clinton offered remarks on Robinson’s legacy at a ceremony in New York’s Shea Stadium. Also that summer, Robinson’s widow, Rachel, took part in a ceremony at the Baseball Hall of Fame dedicating a wing to African Americans.\n\nNATIONAL BASEBALL HALL OF FAME\n\n1962: Jackie Robinson\n\n1969: Roy Campanella\n\n1971: Leroy R. “Satchel” Paige\n\n1972: Josh Gibson; Walter “Buck” Leonard\n\n1973: Roberto W.

Wilkinson (white owner); Pre Negro League Executive: Sol White.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nUnlike the other major American sports, professional football was integrated from its inception. Beginning in 1919 with Fritz Pollard of the Akron Indians of the American Professional Football League, African Americans participated in professional football. At the peak of hard times brought on by the Great Depression, however, white players complained that African Americans reduced the number of jobs available to them. Team owners then joined into an unwritten pact that African Americans would no longer be allowed to play professionally.\n\nThe NFL was bereft of African American players until the Los Angeles Rams signed Kenny Washington and Woody Strode in 1946. Later that same year Cleveland Browns fullback Marion Motley not only became the first black player in the All-American Football League, but he also was the earliest African American pro football star. Motley led the AAFL in rushing, was instrumental in the Browns’ multiple AAFL championships, and continued to do the same when the team was absorbed by the NFL. Syracuse University’s Jim Brown began his career with the Browns shortly after the retirement of Motley and became the top running back in the league. Brown led the league in rushing for eight of his nine years and held the career yardage mark for 19 years after his retirement.\n\nBy the end of Brown’s career in the mid-1960s, other African American stars had emerged. New York Giants safety Emlen Tunnel—the first black player for the Giants since re-integration—retired in 1961 with 79 career interceptions, a record that was not eclipsed until 1979. With 14 touchdowns in 1965, rookie Chicago Bears running back Gale Sayers immediately gained notoriety as one of the most exciting running backs of the era. Sayers went on to lead the league in rushing in\n\n1966 and 1969 and became the youngest man ever elected to the NFL Hall of Fame in 1977. Blacks excelled at every position except quarterback, which remained unofficially reserved for white players.\n\nAfrican American stars continued to proliferate in the 1960s and 1970s. Charley Taylor was the first African American to lead the league in receptions twice. Willie Wood was the first to lead the NFL in interceptions. In 1973, the Buffalo Bills’ O. J. Simpson became the first player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a single season. Only three players have managed that feat since, all of them African American, but all of them in 16 games as opposed to the 14 played by Simpson: Eric Dickerson’s 2,105 yards in 1984; Barry Sanders’s 2,053 in 1997; and Terrell Davis’s 2,008 in 1998. The visibility of African Americans in the NFL was demonstrated with the popularity of certain teams’ defensive lines and their familiar nicknames. The Minnesota Vikings offered the “Purple People Eaters,” including Carl Eller, future state supreme court justice Alan Page, and Jim Marshall. David “Deacon” Jones and Rosey Grier were mainstays on the Los Angeles Rams’ “Fearsome Foursome.” The great Pittsburgh Steelers defenses of the 1970s were known as the “Steel Curtain” and included “Mean” Joe Greene.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the New York Giants’ Lawrence Taylor revolutionized the position of outside linebacker. In 1984, Walter Payton of the Bears eclipsed Jim Brown’s\n\nrecord for career rushing yards and concluded his brilliant career in 1987 with 16,726 yards, more than 1,000 yards ahead of the second most as of the end of the 2002 season. In 1988, the Washington Redskins’ Doug Williams became the first African American to quarterback his team to a Super Bowl victory. The 1990s have been dominated by three running backs who have won Most Valuable Player Awards: the now-retired Detroit Lions’ Barry Sanders, the Dallas Cowboys’ Emmitt Smith, and the Denver Broncos’ Terrell Davis. The San Francisco 49ers’ wide receiver Jerry Rice holds the record of most touchdowns scored in league history. The Cowboys’ now-retired but still flamboyant cornerback Deion Sanders became one of the game’s most visible and dominant defensive players, also notably dangerous as a kick and punt returner.\n\nIn the late 1990s, African Americans represented approximately 70 percent of those playing in the NFL. The proportion of African Americans in the coaching ranks and team front offices, however, has not grown at the same pace. African Americans made up less than 20 percent of the head coaches in the league and held none of the upper-level management positions.\n\nThis is a similar problem in college football, as most coaching jobs are still held by whites. The major avenue for African Americans in coaching—and at one time in playing—was through historically African American colleges. Grambling’s former head coach Eddie Robinson produced several NFL stars as did other predominantly African American colleges. The integration of major Southern universities, however, has weakened the influence of African American colleges.\n\nPROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME\n\n1967: Emlen Tunnell\n\n1968: Marion Motley\n\n1969: Fletcher “Joe” Perry\n\n1971: Jim Brown\n\n1972: Ollie Matson\n\n1973: Jim Parker\n\n1974: Richard “Night Train” Lane\n\n1975: Roosevelt Brown; Leonard “Lenny” Moore\n\n1976: Leonard “Len” Ford\n\n1977: Gale Sayers; Bill Willis\n\n1980: Herb Adderley; David “Deacon” Jones\n\n1981: Willie Davis\n\n1983: Bobby Bell; Bobby Mitchell; Paul Warfield\n\n1984: Willie Brown; Charley Taylor\n\n1985: O.

In 1886 George “Little Chocolate” Dixon became the first African American to win a world boxing title. In 1908, Jack Johnson became the first to win the heavyweight title. Joe Walcott—not to be confused with “Jersey” Joe Walcott, a heavyweight contemporary of Joe Louis—lost his only shot at the world lightweight championship in 1897, lost his first bout for the world welterweight championship the next year, but captured the welterweight title in 1901. Throughout Walcott’s tumultuous career, he fought in handicap events where he was required to weigh much less than his opponent—and much less than his normal body weight. Walcott also fought light-heavyweights and heavyweights with unbelievable success. Because of this, he was called the greatest welterweight and greatest “pound for pound” fighter of all time by many boxing experts. Middleweight champion “Sugar” Ray Robinson and light-heavyweight Roy Jones Jr. are also mentioned in such discussions. Joe Louis held the world heavyweight title for a record 11 years and 8 months in the 1930s and 1940s. Henry Armstrong held three world titles at once—featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight—during the Great Depression.\n\nLouis, Robinson, and Armstrong were stars in what is considered the first golden age of African Americans in boxing. A new golden age was ushered in on March 8, 1971, when Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier drew the sport’s first multimillion-dollar gate. Ali, a national figure since winning an Olympic gold medal in 1960, was also one of the first athletes to comment on American political and social events despite the danger such a stance could pose to his career.\n\nOther divisions have featured African American stars. During the 1970s and 1980s attention shifted to talented fighters in the middle and welterweight divisions including “Sugar” Ray Leonard, “Marvelous” Marvin Hagler, and Thomas “Hit Man” Hearns. When Ali was no longer able to defend his heavyweight crown, new challengers such as his former sparring partner Larry Holmes and Michael Spinks ascended to the championship ranks.\n\nAs purses for major boxing events reached the $100 million mark in the mid-1980s, a new generation of fighters arose. “Iron” Mike Tyson became the best known heavyweight champion since Ali and the wealthiest boxer of all time. His tumultuous reign was ended in Japan with a knockout by James “Buster” Douglas, who in turn lost the title to Evander Holyfield. Even without a title to his name, Tyson continued to be the most visible figure in boxing. In 1992, he was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to jail. While incarcerated he made headlines for his conversion to Islam and his admissions of youthful indiscressions. After his release, he quickly regained his title until Holyfield won it from him in 1996. In a 1997 rematch, Tyson bit Holyfield twice during the early rounds, prompting Tyson’s disqualification and suspension from boxing. Despite the lifting of that suspension, legal troubles and prison time have clouded the career of boxing’s most famous figure.\n\nOther stars, including Pernell Whitaker and Roy Jones Jr., have shone brightly in recent years, but none have held the attention of the public like Mike Tyson. Many experts see the lack of a popular heavyweight champion as a sign of the death of the sport of boxing.\n\nTop boxers can conceivably earn as much as $100 million for less than a dozen major ring events. The advent of pay-per-view television and cable network sponsorship has lead to soaring profits for the sport and its practitioners, although declining ratings and public interest threaten this trend. Colorful entrepreneur Don King is the most famous, wealthy, and controversial boxing promoter of the modern era. His powerful position in boxing’s ranks and his hold on Tyson have allowed him to control championship boxing, despite frequent troubles with the Internal Revenue Service and complaints from former fighters who worked under King.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nAfrican American presence in basketball dates to the early days of the sport. College basketball dominated the first half of the twentieth century as no major professional league existed until the late 1940s. In 1916, educators, coaches, and faculty members from Hampton Institute, Shaw, Lincoln, Virginia Union, and Howard University formed the Central Interscholastic Athletic Association, the first African American collegiate conference. Others soon followed, including the Southeastern Athletic Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, and Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.\n\nMuch of the legacy of African American basketball history lies in its pioneers. Bob Douglas, who founded the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, is considered the “Godfather of black basketball.” His innovations included monthly player contracts, a custom designed team bus, and tours in the South. John McLendon, a coach during the 1950s and 1960s, is recognized as the strategic architect of the fast break and was the first African American to publish a book detailing his coaching philosophy. He was also the first to coach a professional team. Additionally, McLendon was a prominent advocate of the desegregation of intercollegiate athletics.\n\nFor years most top college African American players signed with the Harlem Globetrotters, an internationally known barnstorming team. From their inception in 1926, the Globetrotters have delighted basketball fans worldwide with their unique combination of skill and humor. Famous Globetrotters include “Meadowlark” Lemon, “Curly” Neal, “Goose” Tatum, and Marques Haynes.\n\nProfessional basketball organized in the late 1940s as the National Basketball Association and was integrated in 1950. In the same year Chuck Cooper of Duquesne University was the first African American to be drafted in the league. Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton was the first signed to a professional contract. However, on October 31, 1950, when Earl Lloyd of the then Washington Capitols took the court, he became the first African American to actually participate in an NBA game.\n\nBasketball grew in the 1950s and 1960s as African American players such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, and Oscar Robertson enjoyed success in both college and then as professionals. In 1966, Texas Western University became the first college team to win the NCAA National Championship with an all-African American starting five. They beat the favored and all-white University of Kentucky, a milestone that began the end of segregated basketball teams.\n\nThe late 1960s and 1970s featured the rise of two of the great stars of the game—Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving. Abdul-Jabbar starred at UCLA and led the Bruins to three straight NCAA crowns. He then became a professional star with the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers. Along with Earl Monroe, Willis Reed, Elvin Hayes, and others, African American players began to dominate the league. The rival American Basketball Association began the slam dunk competitions which dominate the NBA All-Star Weekend. Julius Erving became the most popular player in the ABA due to his dunks and acrobatics.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s featured the growth of basketball into one of the most popular sports in the United States and around the world. The huge success of the NCAA Final Four has led to large financial revenues for colleges. In 1982, John Thompson of Georgetown University became the first African American to coach in the Final Four. Two years later his team won the tournament. The talents of Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Alonzo Mourning, and others led to large growth of the college game and the NBA. These players became celebrities as well as athletes.\n\nThe most famous player of both decades is Michael Jordan. Considered the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan’s success and personality have made him one of the most famous people in the world. He led the University of North Carolina to an NCAA title in\n\n1982 and led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles. His endorsements established Nike athletic shoes as one of the largest apparel companies in the world.\n\nAfrican Americans now occupy more than 80 percent of the spots on NBA rosters including such stars as Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, and Tim Duncan. Other areas, especially coaching and management positions, have less representation. The Atlanta Hawks’ Lenny Wilkens has won more games than any other coach in history, with more than 1,260 victories. Approximately 15 percent of top management and administrative positions are held by African Americans. In 1990, Bertram Lee and Peter C. B. Bynoe became the first African American owners of a professional sports franchise with the purchase of the Denver Nuggets.\n\nRecent incidents involving high-profile players have dented the popularity and rapid growth of professional basketball. In 1997, Latrell Sprewell, an All-Star player, attempted to strangle his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, at a practice. Following a league suspension, Sprewell returned to the NBA as a player for the New York Knicks. Sprewell’s return was delayed along with the NBA season by a labor dispute which resulted in a lock out by NBA owners that did not end until early January 1999, resulting in a shortened season. In February 2002, retired NBA star Jayson Williams was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of a limousine driver. Months later, Allen Iverson, a league MVP, as well as one of its most visible and talented players, was arraigned on charges that he had threatened two men while armed with a gun.\n\nNATIONAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME\n\n1971: Robert L.

This tradition began at the 1908 London Olympics, when John Baxtor Taylor became the first African American to capture a gold medal as part of the 4x400-meter relay team.\n\nJesse Owens was the star of the first half of the twentieth century. Owens is best known for his four gold medal performance at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany. However, it was on May 25, 1935, at Ann Arbor, Michigan, that Jesse Owens provided the greatest performance in track and field history at the Big Ten Championships as a member of Ohio State University. Owens began this day by equalling the world record in the 100-yard dash. He then proceeded to set the world records in the broad jump, 220-yard dash, and 220-yard low hurdles.\n\nOwens began a string of medal-winning performances by African Americans in track and field. At the 1960 Olympics, Ralph Boston broke Owens’s long jump record to win the gold medal. In so doing, he also became one of only two track stars to break a world record on six separate occasions. Rafer Johnson won the decathlon in the same Olympics. Bob Beamon, at the 1968 Mexico City Games, leaped 29′ 2 1/2″ in the long jump competition to win the gold medal and extend the world record by almost two feet. Beamon’s record sat unbeaten and presumed out of reach for a quarter of a century, until Mike Powell bested it by 2″ at the 1991 World Track & Field Championships in Tokyo. In 1984, in Los Angeles, Carl Lewis became the first athlete since Owens in 1936 to win four gold medals. Edwin Moses became the greatest 400-meter hurdler in history, winning gold medals in 1976 and 1984 as well as winning 122 straight races. At the 1992 Olympic Games, Michael Johnson became the next African American star, winning the 400-meter dash. At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Johnson became the first man to win the 200-meter and 400-meter races in the same games.\n\nOne of the most controversial events in Olympic history occurred in 1968 during an awards ceremony. After finishing first and third respectively, in the 200-meter dash, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, while on the victory stand, raised their arms in unison with black gloves on their clenched fists. This became known as the “Black power salute.” Their protest caused them to lose their medals.\n\nHistorically, African American Olympic athletes have not fared well at the Winter Games. Debi Thomas was the first to win a medal of any kind—bronze—in 1988 in figure skating. Not until the 2002 Olympiad did another black American ascend the podium for a medal. Jarome Iginla won a gold medal with the Canadian men’s ice hockey team. More notably, however, Vonetta Flowers won gold with her white teammate for their 2-woman bobsled performance. Similarly, half of the U.S. 4-man bobsled team was African American: Garrett Hines and Randy Jones captured silver medals to become the first African American men to place at a Winter Olympiad.\n\nThe professional tennis community was largely devoid of African Americans through World War II, as they were not welcome by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA). In a sport primarily associated with the upper class, the only avenues of competition open for African Americans were universities and colleges, clubs and various minor tournaments. Shortly after the war, the USLTA loosened its discrimination policy and, in 1948, Oscar Johnson became the first African American player to win a USLTA-sanctioned event.\n\nArthur Ashe, a classy and congenial champion, won the Australian Open in 1970 and the Wimbledon title in 1975, along with several less celebrated tournaments during his career. He represented the United States as a member of the Davis Cup team ten times and was its captain from 1981 to 1984. Ashe also made contributions off the court. He made significant contributions as a human rights activist and retained a dignity and grace during his battle with AIDS. In 1996 MaliVai Washington became the first African American since Ashe to reach the Wimbledon finals.\n\nAfrican Americans’ attempts to break into golf prior to World War II paralleled those of their tennis counterparts. However, the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) did not rescind its white-only policy until 1959, when Charlie Sifford became the first African American to be issued a PGA card as an “approved player.” In 1967 Renee Powell became the first African American female to be issued a LPGA card. Sifford was the best known of the initial participants on the tour. He was the first to win a predominantly white event with his victory at the 1957 Long Beach Open. In 1975 Lee Elder became the first African American to compete at the Masters tournament. In the 1980s Calvin Peete enjoyed success on the tour and competed in the 1983 Ryder Cup.\n\nHowever, not until the arrival of Tiger Woods in the mid-1990s did an African American golfer become a superstar. Woods was a child prodigy, winning several junior tournaments before he was a teenager. In 1994 Woods became the first African American to win the U.S. Amateur title. He repeated this feat the next two years, becoming the first man to win the amateur title three years in a row. In 1997, after becoming a professional, Woods won the Masters tournament with a record score. He also rose to the ranking of the world’s top player. These accomplishments indicate the level of fame Woods has achieved. He has become the preeminent African American athlete with the retirement of Michael Jordan and has several endorsement deals.\n\nAfrican American luminaries exist in other sports. By winning the Brunswick Memorial World Open, George Branham III became the first African American bowler to win a Professional Bowling Association (PBA) title. Bran-ham has won four other titles, including the prestigious Firestone Tournament of Champions in 1993, which was the first time an African American had won one of bowling’s Triple Crown events. The weightlifter John Davis was the first athlete of any race to win eight consecutive World and Olympic Championships, during a career spanning three decades. Superlative bodybuilder Lee Haney reached the top of his field by winning eight consecutive Mr. Olympia titles from 1984 to 1991. Picking up where Haney left off, Lenda Murray captured every Ms. Olympia title from 1990 through 1995. Following in their footsteps, Ronnie Coleman won the Mr. Olympia title in 1998 and retained it through the 2002 competition. At the turn of the nineteenth century, cyclist Marshall Taylor was among the three most celebrated African American athletes in the world. During the same era, jockey Isaac Murphy, viewed as the greatest in the world at his craft, was part of a triumphant half century of African American jockeys. Oliver Lewis won the inaugural Kentucky Derby aboard Aristedes, in 1875. However, until Marlon St. Julien rode to a seventh-place finish in the 2000 Derby, no African American had ridden in the Derby since 1911.\n\nOne sport on which African Americans have had a negligible influence is auto racing. Willie T. Ribbs is the only African American to drive at the Indianapolis 500 and has failed in his efforts to put together a successful NASCAR team. Julius Erving and former football star Joe Washington are the first African American owners of a NASCAR team but race with a white driver. Wendell Scott is the only African American to win a NASCAR race, with that win coming in the 1960s.\n\nWOMEN IN SPORTS\n\nAlthough not provided with the same opportunities that have been traditionally afforded to men, African American women have made a significant contribution to the sports world. African American women are on the vanguard of the new opportunities, achieving success in sports as varied as tennis to basketball.\n\nIn 1948, Alice Coachman became the first African American woman to capture an Olympic gold medal in the high jump. Wilma Rudolph overcame debilitating childhood illnesses to win three golds at the 1960 Olympiad in Rome. Her teammate, 15-year-old Barbara Jones, became the youngest female to win a gold medal in track and field. In the 1968 games, Wyomia Tyus became the second African American to win more than one gold medal in one Olympiad as well as the first to set world records in two different events. In 1988, Debi Thomas became the first African American woman to win an Olympic medal in figure skating. Florence Griffith Joyner won four medals during the 1988 Olympiad, including three gold medals. Jackie Joyner-Kersee, owner of two Olympic gold medals, and Gail Devers, who overcame the effects of Graves’ disease to win a gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games, are recent stars.\n\nThe first female African American athlete to dominate her sport was tennis’s Althea Gibson. A superb athlete, Gibson was named 1957’s female athlete of the year during which she captured the prestigious Wimbledon singles title and U.S. Lawn Tennis Association championship. She won both titles again in 1958 and was the undisputed number one women’s player in the world during those years. She became the first African American woman to capture a Grand Slam event in 1956 with her singles and doubles championships at the French Open. Zina Garrison-Jackson was the next prominent female African American tennis player, eventually reaching a top-ten ranking, and becoming a 1990 Wimbledon finalist.\n\nIn the late 1990s the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, entered the international tennis scene, bringing new attention to the sport among African Americans. Serena, the youngest, became the first of the sisters to win a Grand Slam title, taking the U.S. Open in 1999. Venus followed with back-to-back victories at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001. The sisters have gone on to dominate the sport. In 2002, they became the two highest ranked players on the tour.\n\nBasketball has been a major outlet for African American female athletes. Cheryl Miller is one of the most famous female basketball players. She was named All-American at the conclusion of each of her four years at the University of Southern California, was national player of the year three times, and was inducted in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1994. The decade of the 1970s featured the great center Lusia Harris, the first woman to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Others who have left their marks in basketball annals include University of Kansas star Lynette Woodard, perhaps best known as the first female member of the Harlem Globetrotters in 1985.\n\nIn 1997 two professional basketball leagues for women were established. The WNBA, supported by the men’s NBA, and the ABL. Both leagues allowed stars such as Cynthia Cooper, Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, and Chamique Holdsclaw the chance to exhibit their skills beyond the college level. The ABL folded before it could launch its third season, but the WNBA continued on with much success. The league, which was originally comprised of eight teams, had expanded to 16 by 2000.\n\nOther notables in sports include the late volleyball player Flo Hyman; bodybuilder Lenda Murray, who won the Ms. Olympia title six times; Lyle (Toni) Stone who was the first African American woman to play professional baseball with the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro\n\nAmerican League in 1953; and Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes. In 1978, Wendy Hilliard became the first African American member of the U.S. National Rhythmic Gymnastics Team.\n\nUnfortunately, very few of the above mentioned women ever had the opportunity to display their talents on a professional level. Women’s athletics has long been hamstrung by the lack of non-amateur forums in which African American female athletes could participate. For many, the Olympic Games or intercollegiate athletics have been the final step of their careers.\n\nWomen’s athletics received a boost with the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendment Act of 1972, which stipulated that any university receiving federal funds was obligated to provide an equal or proportionate number of scholarships for women. While the law provides opportunities to women, it has been criticized in its implementation as many universities have cut men’s programs to fund scholarships for women.\n\nATHLETES, COACHES, AND SPORTS EXECUTIVES\n\n(To locate biographical profiles more readily, please consult the index at the back of the book.)\n\nHANK AARON (1934– ) Baseball Player, Sports Executive\n\nHenry Louis Aaron was born in Mobile, Alabama, on February 5, 1934. He played sandlot ball as a teenager and later played for a local team named the Black Bears. He first played professional baseball with the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League.\n\nIn June of 1952, Aaron’s contract was purchased by the Boston Braves. The following season, playing for their minor league team in Jacksonville, his .362 average led the South Atlantic League. In 1954 he was promoted to the Braves, then based in Milwaukee.\n\nAaron enjoyed perhaps his finest season in 1957, when he was named Most Valuable Player and led his team to a world championship. He batted .322, with 44 homers, 132 RBIs, and 118 runs scored.\n\nIn 1974 Aaron became the all-time home run leader when he hit his 715th, breaking Babe Ruth’s mark of 714 home runs. He played his final two seasons in the American League with the Milwaukee Brewers, completing his career with a total of 755 home runs.\n\nDuring his career, Aaron won a pair of batting titles and hit over .300 in 12 seasons. He won the home run and RBI crowns four times apiece, hit 40 or more homers eight times, and hit at least 20 home runs for 20 consecutive years, a National League record. In addition, he was named to 20 consecutive All-Star teams.\n\nIn January of 1982, Aaron was elected by the Baseball Writers Association to the Baseball Hall of Fame. His autobiography I Had a Hammer was published in 1990 and statues of Aaron grace the entrances of both Turner Field and Miller Park where the Braves and Brewers play. The Braves have also honoreed Aaron by changing the address of the stadium to Hank Aaron Drive. In 2002 Aaron was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\nOne of the first blacks to play in Major League Baseball, Aaron also served as vice president of player development for the Braves, and since 1989 he has served as vice president/assistant to the president for the Braves.\n\nKAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR (1947– ) Basketball Player\n\nAbdul-Jabbar was born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. on April 16, 1947, in New York City. In high school, at 7′1/2″ tall, he established a New York City career record of 2,067 points and 2,002 rebounds, leading Power Memorial High School to three straight championships. Power won 95 and lost only six games during his years with the team.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar combined great height with catlike moves and a deft shooting touch to lead UCLA to three consecutive NCAA Championships. Twice, as a sophomore and a senior, he was chosen as the top collegiate player in the country. He finished his career at UCLA as the ninth all-time collegiate scorer, accumulating 2,325 points in 88 games. After leading UCLA to its third consecutive NCAA title, Abdul-Jabbar signed a contract with the Milwaukee Bucks for $1.4 million.\n\nIn his rookie season, 1969–1970, he led the Bucks, a recently established expansion club, to a second place finish in the Eastern Division. After being voted Rookie of the Year, he went on to win the scoring championships in 1971 and 1972. He won a world championship in 1971. In 1973, he finished second in scoring with a 30.2 point average, but became dissatisfied with life in Milwaukee. At the end of the 1974–1975 season he was traded to the L.A. Lakers. Abdul-Jabbar enjoyed a very successful career with the Lakers, leading the team to NBA championships in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar converted to the Hanafi sect of Islam while in college, though he did not change his name until 1971. Greatly influenced by the life and struggles of Malcolm X, he believes that the Islamic religion is distinct from the nationalistic Black Muslims.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar announced his retirement after the 1988–1989 season, one year after the Lakers had won back-to-back World Championships. He was elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar has applied his experience and knowledge of the game to the areas of coaching and scouting. In 2000, he served as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers, and in 2001 took a position as scout, consultant, and assistant coach for the Indianapolis Pacers. In 2005 Jabbar returned to the Lakers as special assistant to Phil Jackson.\n\nMUHAMMAD ALI (1942– ) Boxer\n\nBorn Cassius Clay, in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 17, 1942, Ali started boxing as a youth. After winning the 1960 Olympic gold medal as light-heavyweight, Clay turned pro. In 1963 he converted to Islam, and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. A year later, Ali won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out Sonny Liston.\n\nAfter nine successful title defenses, Ali refused to serve in the armed forces during the Vietnam War. He maintained that it was contrary to his Muslim beliefs. Stripped of his title and banned from boxing in the United States, Ali was jailed, but he refused to back down and was finally cleared on a technicality by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1970.\n\nComing back to the ring after a three and one-half year layoff, he was defeated by heavyweight champion Joe Frazier. In 1974 when neither held a title, Ali defeated Frazier to earn a shot at regaining the title.\n\nFew fans gave Ali a chance against heavyweight champion George Foreman when they met in Zaire on October 30, 1974. A 4–1 underdog at ring time, Ali amazed the boxing world and knocked out his stronger, younger opponent. After regaining the crown, Ali defeated Frazier in their third fight in Manilla. Ali then lost his title to Leon Spinks in 1978, briefly regained it, and then retired.\n\nIn 1980 Ali came out of retirement to fight his former sparring partner, heavyweight champion Larry Holmes. He was defeated. After a 1981 loss to Trevor Berbick, he retired again.\n\nForced to fight when he was past his prime, Ali took tremendous beatings late in his career. In the 1980s, the former champion was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Despite the disease, Ali has maintained a public presence. This was most notably demonstrated in his being chosen to light the Olympic torch at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nAli continues to work for various causes including international hunger and poverty relief. In 2001, the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation awarded Ali with a Service to America Leadership Award, in part for his founding of the nonprofit Muhammad Ali Center. That year a biographical film of Ali’s life was released. Titled Ali, the film starred Will Smith, and both he and supporting actor Jon Voight (portraying Howard Cosell) earned Academy Award nominations for their performances.\n\nAli who is a devout Muslim continues to travel the world promoting humanitarian endeavors. On November 19,\n\n2005, the $60 million non–profit Muhammad Ali Center officially opened in Louisville, Kentucky, which centers on issues of peace, social responsibility, respect and personal growth, as well as displaying Ali’s boxing memorabilia. Because of his work in the Civil Rights Movement and work with the United Nations, Ali was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the prestigious Otto Hahn peace medal in Gold from the United Nations.\n\nHENRY ARMSTRONG (1912–1988) Boxer\n\nThe only boxer ever to hold three titles at the same time is Henry Armstrong, who accomplished this feat on August 17, 1938, when he added the lightweight championship to his featherweight and welterweight titles.\n\nArmstrong was born on December 12, 1912, in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1929, while fighting under the name of Melody Jackson, he was knocked out in his professional debut in Pittsburgh. Two weeks later he won his first fight. For the next eight years he traveled from coast to coast, fighting until he was finally given a shot at the featherweight title on October 20, 1937. He won the title when he defeated Petey Sarron.\n\nLess than a year later, on May 31, 1938, Armstrong picked up his second title with a decision over welterweight champion Barney Ross. Within three months he added the lightweight crown, winning a decision over Lou Ambers.\n\nArmstrong was inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame in 1975 and died in 1988.\n\nARTHUR ASHE (1943–1993) Tennis Player, Television Commentator\n\nBorn in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe learned the game of tennis at the Richmond Racket Club, which had been\n\nformed by local African American enthusiasts. Dr. R. W. Johnson, who had also served as an advisor and benefactor to Althea Gibson, sponsored Ashe’s tennis.\n\nBy 1958, Ashe reached the semifinals in the under-15 division of the National Junior Championships. In 1960 and 1961, he won the Junior Indoors Singles title. In 1961, Ashe entered UCLA on a tennis scholarship.\n\nWhile still an amateur, Ashe won the United States Amateur Tennis Championship and the U.S. Open Tennis Championship and became the first African American ever named to a Davis Cup Team.\n\nIn 1975, Ashe defeated Jimmy Connors to win Wimbledon and won the World Championship Tennis singles title over Bjorn Borg.\n\nIn 1979, at the age of 35, Ashe suffered a heart attack. Following quadruple bypass heart surgery, Ashe retired from active tennis. He began writing a nationally syndicated column and contributed monthly articles to Tennis Magazine. He wrote a tennis diary Portrait in Motion, his autobiography Off the Court, and the book Advantage Ashe.\n\nIn addition, he compiled the historical work A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete.\n\nAshe was named captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team in 1981. He was a former president and active member of the board of directors of the Association of Tennis Professionals, and a co-founder of the National Junior Tennis League. Late in his career, he also served as a television sports commentator.\n\nIn April of 1992, Ashe announced that he had contracted AIDS as the result of a tainted blood transfusion received during heart bypass surgery. He died on February 6, 1993.\n\nERNIE BANKS (1931– ) Baseball Player\n\nBorn in Dallas, Banks was slightly built at 6′1″, 180 pounds, but his powerful wrists help him produce a career total of 512 home runs. His 44 homers and five grand slams in 1955 were single season records for shortstops. His best season was 1958, during which he led the National League in at-bats (617), home runs (47), runs batted in (129), and slugging percentage (.614). He was named the league’s Most Valuable Player after the 1958 and 1959 seasons.\n\nBanks, who was moved to first base during the 1961 season and played in 717 consecutive games, may have the somewhat dubious distinction of being the greatest player to never play in a World Series, as his Chicago Cubs rarely produced winning ballclubs during his tenure.\n\nBanks, along with second baseman Gene Baker, formed the majors’ first all-African American double play combination. He was the second African American to play for the Cubs, after Baker. Banks was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977 and is also a member of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter his playing career, Banks became a bank executive with Seaway National Bank. He remained visible in the community, becoming a board member of the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Metropolitan YMCA, and the Los Angeles Urban League.\n\nELGIN BAYLOR (1934– ) Basketball Player, Basketball Coach, Sports Executive\n\nBorn on September 16, 1934, in Washington, DC, Elgin Baylor first attracted attention while attending Spingarn High School. He became an All-American at Seattle University, leading the Chieftains to the Final Four in 1958. In 1959, Baylor made his professional debut with the Minneapolis Lakers, becoming the first rookie to be named Most Valuable Player in the All-Star Game. He also was named to the All-League team and set a scoring record of 64 points in a single game.\n\nAfter five years as a superstar, Baylor injured his knee during a 1965 playoff game against the Bullets and never played at the same level again. He totaled 23,149 points in his career, and his scoring average of 27.4 is the fourth highest in NBA history. His best year was 1961–1962, when he averaged 38.2 points a game. When he retired in 1968, Baylor had been an All-Pro nine times and had played in eight consecutive All-Star games.\n\nBaylor was inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame in 1975 and the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1976. He was head coach of the New Orleans Jazz in 1978–1979. Since 1986, Baylor has been executive vice president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Clippers. In 2006 Baylor was selected as the NBA executive of the Year.\n\nDAVE BING. SEEENTREPRENEURSHIP CHAPTER.\n\nBARRY BONDS (1964– ) Baseball Player\n\nBarry Bonds was born on July 24, 1964, in Riverside, California. He was exposed to baseball heavily during childhood. Bonds’s father, Bobby, and his godfather, Hall of Famer Willie Mays, were Major League outfielders. Bonds played three sports in high school—baseball, basketball, and football. Although he was offered a contract to play with the San Francisco Giants upon graduation, he opted to attend college at Arizona State University.\n\nAfter success at the collegiate level, Bonds was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates as the sixth selection in the 1985 baseball draft. He spent a brief time in the minor leagues before being called up by the National League club at the age of 21. During his rookie season, he led all first-year players in home runs, runs batted in, stolen bases, and walks.\n\nIn 1990 Bonds earned Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. He hit 32 home runs, stole 52 bases, batted in 114 runs, scored 104 runs, and earned his first of four consecutive Gold Gloves for defensive play during the year. With Bonds’s support the Pirates won the Eastern Division of the National League but ended up losing to the Cincinnati Reds in a postseason series.\n\nThe Pirates entered the playoffs during the next two seasons, but met with postseason frustration both years. The 1992 campaign was notable because Bonds earned his second MVP award. Regardless of his success during the regular season, however, Bonds was unable to contribute in the same fashion during the playoffs.\n\nAfter the completion of the 1992 season, Bonds signed a lucrative deal with the San Francisco Giants. The contract provided him with $43.75 million over the course of six years, making him the highest paid player at the time. Although some critics doubted that any player was worth such a salary, Bonds quieted them by earning another MVP award on the strength of a season that featured 46 home runs and 123 RBIs. The Giants failed to make the playoffs, though, losing the honor to the Atlanta Braves on the last day of the season.\n\nAlthough Bonds has continued to post strong numbers through the remainder of the 1990s, his team has made the playoffs only twice, in 1997 and 2000. Bonds’s continued success during the regular season is remarkable in light of the fact that opposing pitchers do not often offer him decent pitches. They would rather walk Bonds than risk giving up an extra base hit against him.\n\nIn 1998 Bonds became the first player with more than 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases in a career; at the beginning of the 2002 season, he needed only 16 stolen bases to gain lone membership in the “500/500 Club.” In the 2001 season Bonds amassed an amazing 73 home runs, three more than the previous record. Not only did many consider the record of 70 homers in a season unmatchable, but Bonds hit his 73 with limited at bats as most managers instructed their pitchers to intentionally walk him rather than face the prospect of giving up an extra-base hit. Also at the end of the 2001 season, he won his fourth MVP award, becoming the first player in MLB history to win the award more than three times. On August 12, 2002, he hit his 600th home run, making him only the fourth player in Major League Baseball history to do so.\n\nBonds broke two home run records in 2004. On April 12th Bonds hit his 660th home run, tying Willie Mays, and on September 17th he hit his 700th home run, becoming only the third person to achieve this level. In 2006 Bonds hit his 733 home run to tie the record, and on September 23rd he hit his 734th home run, capturing the League record previously held by Hank Aaron.\n\nLOU BROCK (1939– ) Baseball Player, Baseball Coach, Business Executive\n\nBorn in El Dorado, Arkansas, Lou Brock is the second-highest base stealer in baseball history. He stole 938 bases during his 19-year career with the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. In 1977, Brock collected his 893rd steal, eclipsing the mark that had been held by Ty Cobb for 49 years. In 1974, at the age of 35, Brock’s 114 steals broke Maury Wills’s single season record. Brock registered at least 50 steals in 12 consecutive seasons and at the time of his retirement was the only player to hold both the Major League single season and career record in any major statistical category.\n\nIn 1967, Brock led the league in at-bats, runs scored, and steals. The following season he set the pace in triples and steals, leading the Cardinals to pennants both seasons. With Brock, St. Louis also won World Championships in 1964 and 1967.\n\nBrock went on to become a coach and business executive and was presented with the Jackie Robinson Award by Ebony magazine. He won the Roberto Clemente Award in 1975. He was also the recipient of the B’nai B’rith Brotherhood Award and was voted Man of the Year by the St. Louis Jaycees. Brock was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nJIM BROWN (1936– ) Football Player, Actor, Community Activist\n\nJames Nathaniel Brown was born February 17, 1936, on St. Simon Island, Georgia, but moved to Manhasset, Long Island, New York, when he was seven. While at Manhasset High School he became an outstanding competitor in baseball, football, track and field, basketball, and lacrosse and following graduation had a choice of 42 college scholarships, as well as professional offers from both the New York Yankees and the Boston Braves. Brown chose to attend Syracuse University. An All-American performer in both football and lacrosse, he turned down the opportunity to compete in the decathlon at the 1956 Olympic games because it would have conflicted with his football schedule. He also spurned a three-year $150,000 offer to become a professional fighter.\n\nIn 1957 Brown began his professional football career with the Cleveland Browns. In his rookie season, he led\n\nthe league in rushing, helped Cleveland to a division championship, and was unanimously named Rookie of the Year. Brown broke the single season and lifetime rushing and scoring records and was an All-League fullback. His records included most yards gained, lifetime (12,312), and most touchdowns, lifetime (106). He was voted Football Back of the Decade for 1950–1960.\n\nBrown announced his retirement in the summer of 1966, deciding to devote his attention to his movie and business careers. He has made several films including Rio Conchos, The Dirty Dozen, and 100 Rifles. In addition to his film activities, he is president and founder of Amer-Ican and an outspoken activist in issues relating to African Americans and sports.\n\nIn 2002 film director Spike Lee produced the film Jim Brown: All American, which was a retrospective on Brown’s professional and personal lives.\n\nROY CAMPANELLA (1921–1993) Baseball Player\n\nRoy Campanella was born on November 19, 1921, in Philadelphia, and began playing semi-professional baseball\n\nat the age of 15 with the Bacharach Giants. In 1946, Campanella was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. Over the next eight years, the Dodger catcher played with five National League pennant winners and one world championship team. He played on seven consecutive National League All-Star teams (1949 to 1955) and won three Most Valuable Player Awards (1951, 1953, and 1955).\n\nIn January 1958, Campanella’s career was ended by an automobile accident which left him paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. In 1969, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame in 1975. Campanella died on June 26, 1993.\n\nWILT CHAMBERLAIN (1936–1999) Basketball Player\n\nWilt Chamberlain was born in Philadelphia on August 21, 1936. By the time he entered high school, he was already 6′11″. When he graduated from high school, he had his choice of 77 major colleges, and 125 smaller schools. He chose Kansas University, but left after his junior year after being a two-time All-American and playing in the 1957 Final Four.\n\nBefore entering the NBA in 1959, Chamberlain played with the Harlem Globetrotters. Although dominating the sport statistically from his rookie season, Chamberlain was a member of only two championship teams, the 1967 Philadelphia 76ers and the 1972 Los Angeles Lakers. For his efforts in defeating the Knicks in the 1972 series, including playing the final game with both hands painfully injured, he was voted MVP. At the start of the 1974 season, he left the Lakers to become player-coach of the San Diego Conquistadors (ABA) for a reported $500,000 contract.\n\nWilt Chamberlain still holds most major records for a single game including most points (100); field goals made (36); free throws (28); and rebounds (55). His season records include: highest scoring average (50.4); highest field goal percentage (.727); and most rebounds per game (27.2).\n\nChamberlain was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978 and owned various businesses after leaving professional basketball. He was involved with various charitable groups and appeared in several motion pictures. In 1991, Chamberlain published his autobiography, View from Above. The book caused quite a controversy due to revelations about his sexual relations. Chamberlain died of a heart attack on October 12, 1999 in Los Angeles.\n\nALICE COACHMAN (1923– ) Track and Field Athlete\n\nBorn in Albany, Georgia, on November 9, 1923, Coachman made a name for herself when, as a seventh grader, she high jumped 5′4 1/2″, less than an inch from the world record. On August 7, 1948, Alice Coachman became the first African American woman to win an Olympic gold medal. She did it by setting a world record in the high jump. In college, she attended both the Tuskegee Institute (now University) and Albany State University where she won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Outdoor 50-meters title four times; 100-meters three times; and the high jump ten times. Coachman won the 50-meters twice and the high jump three times during AAU indoor meets. She was also an outstanding basketball player, earning All-American honors as a guard at Tuskegee.\n\nCoachman’s ten consecutive victories, between 1939 and 1948, remains an AAU record. She is a member of eight different halls of fame including the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Black Athletes Hall of Fame, the Tuskegee Hall of Fame, and the Georgia State Hall of Fame. A 2002 edition of Ebony magazine, named her as one of the ten greatest women athletes of all time and received recognition as one of America’s 100 greatest Olympic athletes at the 1996 Summer Games held in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nLEONARD S. COLEMAN JR.

At Montclair High School, Coleman played baseball and football. He was named allstate and all-American during his senior year. He continued playing baseball and football as an undergraduate at Princeton University, becoming the first African American to score a touchdown for that prestigious Ivy League school. As a sophomore, he joined two other African American players in a protest, charging the Princeton football program with violations of the university’s policy of equal opportunity for minorities. When the complaints drew national attention, Coleman and his two friends were dismissed from the team, but a panel charged with investigating the incident urged greater sensitivity toward minority students in the athletic program. Coleman attributes that experience to helping him develop a keen social consciousness.\n\nAfter earning his bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1971, Coleman moved on to Harvard University, where he pursued dual master’s degrees in public administration and education. In 1976, he accepted a position as a missionary to Africa for the Protestant Episcopal Church.

In 1996, Coleman was named chairman of the Jackie Robinson Foundation.\n\nColeman resigned from the position of National League president in 1999.

After turning pro, he quickly became a top contender, recording 42 knockouts in his first 47 bouts.\n\nForeman captured the heavyweight title with his victory over Joe Frazier, in Kingston, Jamaica, on January 22, 1973. Having twice defended his belt successfully, he prepared to face Muhammad Ali on October 30, 1974, in Kinshasa, Zaire.

He ran track, played halfback in football, and was a star hitter on the school baseball team. An outstanding football and baseball player at Arizona State University, he left after his sophomore year to join the Athletics (then located in Kansas City).\n\nIn 1968, his first full season with the Athletics, Jackson hit 29 homers and batted in 74 runs, but made 18 errors and struck out 171 times, the worst seasonal total by a left-handed hitter in baseball history. After playing a season of winter ball under Frank Robinson’s direction, his performance continued to improve, and, in 1973, he batted .293, led the league in home runs (32), RBIs (117), and slugging percentage (.531), and was selected Most Valuable Player.\n\nWhile with Oakland, Jackson helped the Athletics to three straight World Series championships, from 1972 to 1974. Later, with the New York Yankees, Jackson won the World Series in 1977 and 1978. The Yankees also won the American League pennant in 1981.

While playing for Everett he picked up the nickname “Magic” because of his ball-handling abilities. While in high school, Johnson made the All-State Team and for three years was named the United Press International Prep-Player of the Year in Michigan.\n\nIn 1977, Johnson enrolled at Michigan State University and led the Spartans to the national championship in 1979. He then turned professional and was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association draft. He led the Lakers to five NBA titles in the 1980s. Johnson played with the Lakers until his retirement in 1991 when he tested positive for the HIV/AIDS virus.\n\nJohnson was the recipient of many awards and was chosen to play on many postseason all-star teams. In college, he was named to the All-Big Ten Team in 1977 and chosen as the NCAA Tournament-Most Valuable Player. He was also a consensus All-American selection (1979).

He was so tiny as a boy that he was nicknamed “Li’l Arthur,” a name that stuck with him throughout his career. As a young man, he drifted around the country, making his way through Chicago, Boston, and New York. He learned to box by working out with veteran professionals whenever he could. When he finally got his chance at the title, he had already been fighting for nine years and had lost only 3 of 100 bouts.\n\nWith his victory over Burns, Johnson became the center of a bitter racial controversy, as his flamboyant lifestyle and outspokenness aroused white resentment. Public pressure forced former champion Jim Jeffries to come out of retirement and challenge Johnson for the title. When the two fought on July 4, 1910, in Reno, Nevada, Johnson knocked out Jeffries in the 14th round.\n\nIn 1913, Johnson left the United States due to legal difficulties. Two years later he defended his title against Jess Willard in Havana, Cuba, and was knocked out in the 26th round.

As a child living in Thousand Oaks, California, Jones participated in many sports, but she was first attracted to running and jumping while watching track superstars Evelyn Ashford, Carl Lewis, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee on television as they competed in the 1984 Olympics. By the time she had finished high school she had received two High School Athlete of the Year awards for her performance in the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes as well as being named California Division I Player of the Year for basketball during her senior year.\n\nJones went on to play basketball for the University of North Carolina and took the team to three Atlantic Coast Conference championships and a national title. Her love, however, was still track and field: she had dreams of running in the Olympics. She decided to forgo playing basketball during her junior year of college to focus purely on her running in preparation for the 1996 Summer Olympics. A broken foot bone ended her aspirations in late 1995, though. After the 1996 Olympics, Jones rededicated herself to her goal of running in the Olympics by training with Jamaican track star Trevor Graham.\n\nJones trained during 1996 and in 1997 she won both the 100-meter title and the long jump title at the USA Outdoor Championships becoming the first woman in nine years to win both events. She won a gold medal in the 100-meter sprint and was on the gold winning 4x100-meter relay team at the Outdoor World Championships later that same year. Jones continued to dominate the world of women’s track by setting an American record in the 60-meter sprint in the Gunma International competition in Japan in 1998. She also anchored the Nike International team to a new American record in the 4x200-meter relay at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia that same year. Shortly after, she became the second fastest woman in the world behind Florence Griffith Joyner when she ran 10.71 seconds in the 100-meter sprint at a meet in Chengdu, China. By the end of 1999, Jones had won 37 consecutive races at international and national track and field competitions, including the World Cup and the USA Outdoor Championships. She was also named Track and Field News Top Woman Athlete of the year for three consecutive years.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, host to the 2000 Summer Games, Jones took home three gold medals and two bronze medals fulfilling her dream of not only running in but winning at the Olympics. Her victories were momentarily overshadowed by the publicity surrounding her husband’s use of steriods in the shot put event. Still, Jones was honored with numerous awards after her Olympic victories, including being named Athlete of the Year by the International Amateur Athletic Federation. Jones continued to compete in track and field, winning a gold medal in the 100-meter race in the 2001 Goodwill Games.\n\nIn December 2004 Jones was openly accused of using performance-enhancing drugs during her career as a runner. The charges could not be substantiated because Jones had never failed a drug test. In June 2006 at the USA Track and Field Championship in Indianapolis, Jones failed the drug test. She was later cleared of these charges as a second sample showed negative.\n\nAfter missing the 2003 Olympics due to the birth of her son, Tim Jr., Jones has set her sights on the 2008 Olympic Games. Her preparation includes winning the 100 meter race at Gaz de France with her fastest time in the previous four years.\n\nMICHAEL JORDAN (1963– ) Basketball Player\n\nMichael Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 17, 1963, and attended the University of North Carolina.

Under Jordan’s leadership, the Bulls repeated as champions in 1992 and 1993. In 1992 Jordan played for the U.S. Olympic basketball “Dream Team,” which captured the gold medal in Barcelona.\n\nIn October of 1993, Jordan announced his retirement from basketball to pursue another lifelong dream—to become a professional baseball player. Jordan began his professional baseball career in 1994 with the Chicago White Sox’s Class A team, the Birmingham Barons. Despite having only a .202 batting average for the year, Jordan was voted the most popular man in baseball in a national poll and remained at the top of Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s top-paid athletes for the third consecutive year, mostly due to endorsements.\n\nIn March of 1995, Jordan returned to the NBA with the Bulls. He was named the 1996 All-Star game MVP. Jordan led the Bulls to three straight titles from 1996 to 1998. The 1996 team set a NBA record for most wins (72) in a season. After hitting the shot that won the 1998 NBA Championship, Jordan retired again.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Jordan took on yet another role, as it was announced that he would serve as part owner and president of basketball operations for the NBA’s Washington Wizards. It was a position that Jordan would only hold for so long, as he decided in September 2001 to come out of retirement once again, this time as a player for the Wizards. Jordan’s return was met with much enthusiasm by fans and media. On January 4, 2002, facing his former team, the Chicago Bulls, Jordan became only the fourth NBA player to reach 30,000 career points. Just a few months later, Jordan was placed on the injured list with a painful knee injury that shortened his first season. Despite the setback, Jordon played successfully through the 2003 season. He played his 13th and final All-Star game, becoming the all-time leading scorer. During Jordan’s final season, tributes to him were presented in arenas all over the country. Michael Jordan retired from the game of basketball, having scored 32,292 points, the third highest all-time scorer in the game, behind only Kareem Adbul Jabbar and Karl Malone.\n\nFLORENCE GRIFFITH JOYNER (1959–1998) Track and Field Athlete\n\nBorn in Los Angeles on December 21, 1959, Florence Griffith started in track at an early age. She first attended California State University-Northridge, but later transferred\n\nwith her coach Bob Kersee when he moved to UCLA. In 1987 she married 1984 Olympic gold medalist Al Joyner.\n\nAt the 1984 Olympic games she won a silver medal. She returned to the Olympic games in 1988, winning a gold medal in the 100-meter, 200-meter, 400-meter relay, and 1600-meter relay races. She set the world record for the 100-meter and 200-meter races that year.\n\nNicknamed “Flo-Jo,” she was inducted into the Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1995. In 1998, she died suddenly in her sleep of an apparent heart seizure.\n\nJACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE (1962– ) Track and Field Athlete, Community Activist, Sports Agent\n\nOften touted as the world’s greatest female athlete, Jackie Joyner-Kersee won two gold medals at the 1988 Olympic games and a gold and a bronze medal at the 1992 games.\n\nJoyner-Kersee was born on March 3, 1962, in East St. Louis, Illinois. Prior to winning the 1988 gold medal, she participated in the 1984 Olympics and won the silver medal for the heptathlon despite a torn hamstring muscle.\n\nThe only woman to gain more than 7,000 points in the heptathlon four times, she set a world record with 7,215 points at the 1988 Olympic trials. Joyner-Kersee also earned another gold medal in the heptathlon and a bronze medal in the long jump at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. In 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics she won a bronze medal in the long jump, her sixth medal, the most in the history of U.S. women’s track and field.\n\nJoyner-Kersee briefly played professional basketball in the ABL, before retiring from sports to devote time to charitable causes. In addition, Joyner-Kersee is one of the few female sports agents in the United States.\n\n“SUGAR” RAY LEONARD (1956– ) Boxer, Television Analyst\n\nOne of the flashiest and most popular fighters of the modern era, Sugar Ray Leonard brought fame to the lighter divisions of boxing which traditionally have not garnered the same amount of attention as the heavyweight division. Leonard was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, and won the gold medal in the light welterweight division at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.\n\nLeonard rose through the professional ranks, winning the welterweight title from Wilfred Benitez in 1979. His fights with Roberto Duran and Tommy Hearns established his fame. After losing his first fight and his title to Duran, Leonard used a taunting style and flamboyant ring persona to force Duran to quit in the middle of their second fight. In 1981 he defeated Hearns in the 14th round by technical knockout, rallying from a point deficit. He retired shortly thereafter due to a detached retina.\n\nIn 1987, Leonard made a comeback by upsetting middleweight champion “Marvelous” Marvin Hagler. The upset prolonged his career, but he was unable to fight at his former level and retired shortly thereafter.\n\nLeonard’s public persona has led to many sponsorship deals. In addition, he serves as a boxing analyst for HBO and ESPN Classic Sports.\n\nCARL LEWIS (1961– ) Track and Field Athlete\n\nCarl Lewis was born on July 1, 1961, in Birmingham, Alabama. In the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Lewis became the first athlete since Jesse Owens in 1936 to win four gold medals in the same Olympic competition.\n\nAn often controversial track and field performer, the New Jersey native went into the 1984 competition with the burden of tremendous expectations as the result of intense pre-Olympic publicity. He did not set any Olympic records, and despite his four gold medals, found himself criticized in the media.\n\nLewis went to the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, hoping to duplicate his four gold medal wins. He was the focus of interest as he faced off against his Canadian archrival Ben Johnson. Lewis won gold medals in the long jump and the 100-meter dash (after Johnson was disqualified for steroid use) and a silver medal in the 200-meter dash. At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Lewis won a gold medal for the long jump and in the 4x100-meter relay. He won his final gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympiad in the long jump.\n\nLewis was inducted into the USA Track & Field Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nJOE LOUIS (1914–1981) Boxer\n\nJoe Louis held the heavyweight championship for the longest stretch in history—more than 11 years, and defended the title more often than any other heavyweight champion. His 25 title fights were more than the combined total of the eight champions who preceded him.\n\nBorn on May 13, 1914, in a sharecropper’s shack in Lexington, Alabama, Louis moved to Detroit as a small boy. Taking up boxing as an amateur, he won 50 out of 59 bouts (43 by knockout), before turning professional in 1934.\n\nIn 1935 Lewis fought Primo Carnera, a former boxing champion. Louis knocked out Carnera in six rounds, earning his nickname, “The Brown Bomber.” After knocking out ex-champion Max Baer, Louis suffered his lone pre-championship defeat at the hands of Max Schmeling, who knocked him out in the twelfth round. Less than a month later, Louis knocked out another former champion, Jack Sharkey, in three rounds. He later won a rematch with Schmeling in a racially charged fight that earned him national attention. After defeating a number of other challengers, he was given a title fight with Jim Braddock on June 22, 1937. He stopped Brad-dock in the eighth round to gain the title.\n\nAfter winning a disputed decision over Joe Walcott in 1947, Loui"
