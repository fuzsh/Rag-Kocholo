        "text": "While the Socceroos are well known for wearing Green & Gold on the global stage, this was not always the case.\n\nMissed out on the first drop of our limited edition Centenary Jersey? CLICK HERE to register your interest so we can notify you when we are back in stock!\n\nEarlier this year, we celebrated a century since the Australia Mens National Team's first 'A International' which took place against New Zealand on 17 June, 1922.\n\nOn that day, a squad of 16 Australians, 8 from NSW and 8 from Queensland, took to the pitch in Dunedin wearing a predominately sky blue jersey, with a logo featuring a fern.\n\nIt was part of a tour where fourteen games were played, including three friendly internationals or “Tests”.\n\nTrevor Thompson, co-author of Burning Ambition – The Centenary of Australia-New Zealand Football Ashes, shed some light on the people and environment that helped shape the beginnings of football international for Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\"17th June 1922 is the beginning of our story; this is where Australian International Football life begins,\" he explained to Socceroos.com.au.\n\n\"Every player and every team that gets selected today is a descendant of these pioneers who did this incredible feat of getting themselves together without any kind of outside assistance and made it happen. And from there, we've got the Socceroos and that's where it all comes from. That is our foundation date.\n\n\"Our first match was played at Dunedin and there was 14,000 people there, which go if you go back and have a look at the census statistics is something like one in every three people who live in the city.\n\n\"The Australian squad was a squad of 16 players, eight from Queensland, eight from New South Wales and nobody from any other state. This is because the money that was stumped up to make the tour happen came from those two states only.\"\n\nThe composition of the first Australian touring part was reflected in its apparel.\n\n\"While we identify the Socceroos with green and gold, this wasn't the case at the beginning,\" Thompson explains.\n\n\"Australia played in sky blue and maroon. And that reflected the composition of the team that went to New Zealand, which was the Queensland and New South Wales combination. So we found a way of incorporating those state colours to represent Australia.\n\n\"Of course, it changed over time and within a couple of years, we are playing in green and gold. And that's something which is evolved over time, but it was not how we started.\n\nOne thing that unites all of us is that we all get behind the national team, and this is where the national team was born.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT OUR NEW ONLINE STORE AND STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER RELEASES - RETRO RANGE COMING SOON!\n\nFast forward to 2022, and our recently-released replica jersey honours all those who have donned the national uniform, showcasing a progression from this first national team who wore a light blue jersey on this tour, known since the 1970s as the Socceroos.\n\nClick here to head to our online store, or watch below & read on to find out more about the jersey's inspiration!\n\nKeep an eye on the Socceroos' social channels as more content will drop on the store in the coming weeks and months."
