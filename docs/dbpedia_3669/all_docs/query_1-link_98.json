        "text": "LAYTON -- Ray Stowers knows the drill. Football season arrives as quickly as summer break ends and there's certainly no exception for Layton Christian Academy as its season opener at East High sits just one week away.\n\nThe Eagles (6-5, 4-1 2A North) proved how unimportant some timetables are last season after turning around a sluggish 1-3 start into a thrilling second half. LCA won five of its last six meetings, falling to South Summit 17-14 in the semifinal round of the state playoffs.\n\nLCA returns a loaded senior class that includes four team captains in the leadership circle: Brayden Bott (WR/FS), Iverson Report (G/DE), Emili Pauni (G/T) and Jobe Tuafale (T/G). Report holds multiple D-I offers (Utah State, Washington State) and Tuafale is offered by Texas Tech.\n\nStowers, now with a career record of 25-13 in three seasons, including a 1A title in 2022, has been impressed with his incoming group since the start of the new year.\n\n\"We had a great winter and were able to build upon that,\" Stowers said. \"As far as preparation, we're right where we need to be. We're not there yet, we still got a lot of work to do, a lot of cleaning up to do. But we're on our way.\"\n\nThe Eagles are expected to address two key losses on the roster following the graduation of starting defensive tackle/tight end Elijah Elliss (Utah) and quarterback Marcus Miles (Ottawa Univ., Arizona). Last season, Elliss and Miles led an LCA offense that averaged 357.3 yards per game.\n\nBott, one of Stowers' go-to leaders during practice, said the incoming senior class is thriving in their newfound roles and setting the example left by their former teammates.\n\n\"We've been getting a lot of conditioning done and that's helped us work on bonding together,\" Bott said.\n\nJunior Trevor Halalilo returns the bulk of the Eagles' production as a 1,000-plus-yard rusher during his sophomore campaign.\n\nHalalilo's presence in the backfield certainly eases tensions on the final quarterback decision, which is coming down to sophomore Chris Monroe and freshman Utulei Simaumea. Both are young arms Stowers praises, but enter the season unproven at the varsity level.\n\nSenior Kaya Madhlazi (RB/CB), junior Hayden Tuinei (LB/TE) and sophomore Memphis Hunkin (TE/DE) are three more versatile playmakers LCA can look to for answers, Stowers said.\n\n\"We've always been known for our guys in the trenches,\" Stowers said. \"Therefore, we gotta play to our strengths and right now that's where our strength lies. We're depending on those guys up front to lead the way and, hopefully, the rest will fall into place with the pass game.\"\n\nThe majority of the Eagles' returning linemen have been inside Stowers' system since the Honolulu native arrived at LCA. A running back at Utah from 2004-08, Stowers' knowledge has seemingly gotten through to his senior class.\n\nReport and his teammates humorously refer to Stowers' coaching style as \"old school.\"\n\n\"He's very straightforward with everything,\" Report said. \"(Stowers) is honest about how you played, how you're doing in the classroom, what you're doing wrong. Even when you're doing wrong, he wants you to (learn) and get better.\"\n\nLCA travels to East High on Fri, Aug. 16. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.\n\nLCA NOTES\n\nLast season: 6-5 (4-1 2A North)\n\nHead coach: Ray Stowers (Fourth season at LCA)\n\nPlayers to watch:\n\n• Trevor Halalilo, RB, Senior; 167 carries, 1,227 yards, 10 TDs\n\n• Brayden Bott, WR/FS/RB, Senior; 39 receptions, 621 yards, 6 TDs\n\n• Kaya Madhlazi, RB/CB, Senior; 4 carries, 21 yards\n\n• Hayden Tuinei, LB/TE, Junior; 55 tackles\n\n• Emili Pauni, G/T, Senior; 44 tackles\n\n• Jobe Tuafale, T/G, Senior; 36 tackles\n\n• Iverson Report, G/DE, Senior; 28 tackles\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nAug. 16 - @ East\n\nAug. 23 - @ Juab\n\nAug. 30 - @ Beaver\n\nSept. 6 - Morgan\n\nSept. 20 - South Summit*\n\nSept. 27 - @ Judge Memorial*\n\nOct. 4 - Providence Hall*\n\nOct. 11 - American Leadership*\n\nOct. 18 - @ Summit Academy*\n\n*Denotes 2A North region game.\n\nConnect with prep sports reporter Conner Becker via email at cbecker@standard.net and X @ctbecker.\n\nNewsletter"
