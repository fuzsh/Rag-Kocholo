        "text": "Professional Experience:\n\nTrevor A. Thompson’s litigation philosophy is that legal proceedings involve not just economics but also principles. He believes that helping clients manage both of these factors requires frank assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of a case, which allows clients to better assess their ongoing risk. He practices commercial litigation including bankruptcy and provides appellate and trial support for the full range of litigation.\n\nBefore joining Clark Partington, Thompson was the judicial law clerk to the Honorable Robert L. Hinkle, district Judge for the Northern District of Florida. He also served as judicial extern to the Honorable R. Fred Lewis of the Florida Supreme Court. He was a two-volume board member of the Florida State University Law Review.\n\nHe hopes that the future of law continues the trend of modern legal writing, which makes decisions less formalistic and more accessible and practical. Outside of the office, Thompson enjoys board games and strategy games, disc golf, fantasy baseball and running.\n\nProfessional Experience:\n\nTrevor A.
