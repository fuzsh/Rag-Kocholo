        "text": "In the eighth installment of the list, 30 new homeowners make their debuts. We offer them our heartiest of congratulations. And for a little context, when we first did this, in 2003, Shirley and Windle Turley occupied the No. 100 spot with a home valuation of $4,690,970. Today that spot belongs to Candace and Tony Romo, at $13,311,220. How times change! (One of the top spots on this list is occupied by a man whose property is nothing but a patch of dirt.)\n\nHere’s a peek over the fence at the other 99 super fancy cribs in town.\n\n1. Harlan Crow\n\n$49,766,240\n\nThe real estate developer maintains his top spot on the list, probably because no one else has a two-story library and a subterranean garage that accommodates 77 vehicles.\n\n2. Lyn and John Muse\n\n$49,400,000\n\nThe financier co-founded Hicks Muse with Tom Hicks. He’s into polo, and somewhere in his 24,932-sf Preston Road house there must be a closet filled with Lucchese boots because he sits on that company’s board (among others).\n\n3. Andy Beal\n\n$47,851,640\n\nForbes puts the banker’s net worth at $8.7 billion, some of which owes to his 7-acre estate on Turtle Creek that previously belonged to oilman Edwin L. Cox Sr., who died in 2020. Beal borrowed $41 million to buy the property, which makes us wonder.\n\n4. FGH Trust\n\n$43,300,490\n\nWith the 2019 passing of the colorful Gene Phillips, this 16-acre Preston Hollow estate briefly belonged solely to his widow, Roxanne, younger than her beloved by two decades. Today it is owned by an opaque trust administered by Dallas lawyer Raymond J. Kane.\n\n5. Gerald Ford\n\n$41,150,000\n\nYou know how the 79-year-old Ford, who grew up in the tiny Panhandle city of Pampa, got rich enough to own this University Park home? He figured out how to fix bad banks. You know what the country has too many of today? Bad banks. Hey, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell: if you’re reading this, we have Ford’s phone number.\n\n6. Christy Thompson\n\n$40,000,000\n\nVampires. Maybe that’s why no one wants to buy oil heiress Christy Thompson’s brand-new, 24,127-sf University Park palace. Ground was broken for the six-bedroom, eight-bath home in 2018. It includes a theater and a library. But Thompson has listed and de-listed it twice since 2021, perhaps because it is finished in Bulgarian stone. And everyone knows that in Bulgaria, stone palaces are homes for the undead. Also, she owns No. 79.\n\n7. Jan and Trevor Rees-Jones\n\n$36,879,460\n\nOn one side of the couple’s 14,464-sf house runs Turtle Creek. On the other sits Dallas Country Club’s par-3 sixth hole. When you’re teeing off, shout at the billionaire oilman, “Hey, Trevor, next time Bon Jovi plays at your 27,600-acre Cook Canyon Ranch, how about an invite?! Or let’s go hunt turkey at your other ranch, the 64,000-acre Clear Fork, the one with the Brazos River running through it!”\n\n8. Ann and John McReynolds\n\n$35,843,690\n\nKudos to the director of Energy Transfer Partners for besting his buddy Kelcy Warren (No. 13) by assembling nearly 15 acres on Strait Lane with a lake and a driveway that winds between three houses, two of which are assessed at more than $10 million. That, friends, is a compound (created by flattening a home that modernist master architect Bud Oglesby had built in 1971 for Nancy Dedman). Also, congratulations to his wife, Ann.\n\n9. Les Ware\n\n$33,145,200\n\nLes Ware is an IP lawyer who founded Outlander Capital in 2020. This spot on the list actually represents just the land previously owned by Margaret and Trammell Crow. Billionaire banker Andy Beal (No. 3) bought the estate for a rumored $50 million and scraped the 10,000-sf house in 2017. The kicker? Ware sits on the board of Crow Holdings. Even better? He also occupies the No. 27 spot on this list.\n\n10. Cox Family\n\n$30,604,120\n\nThis historic estate, which has changed hands several times (Tom Hicks, Andy Beal, Mehrdad Moayedi) and been parceled up a bit in recent years, is for sale again for around $60 million. You know who could afford that price? Pio Crespi, the guy who built the estate in the first place. In 1938, family-owned Crespi & Co. brought in revenues of $15 million, or about $323 million in today’s money. Bravissimo!\n\n11. Mary Clare Finney\n\n$29,900,970\n\nThe widow of investor Stan Finney runs Rainbow Trading Co., a Western-themed decor wholesaler. She has been a perennial “best dressed” honoree in Dallas. As styles became more casual during the pandemic, Finney, who has a tennis court in her backyard, said she went to Neiman’s and stocked up on several pairs of “tennis shoes” from designers such as Gucci, Chanel, and Fendi.\n\n12. Margot Perot\n\n$29,871,070\n\nMaybe someone could rummage around on the late H. Ross Perot’s 16-acre homestead, where his widow still lives, and see if ol’ Ross left behind a chart showing how to lower the nation’s debt. Such a thing might be in the attic of his 8,264-sf main house. Or maybe in the even bigger 8,446-sf outbuilding.\n\n13. Kelcy Warren\n\n$28,889,970\n\nBack in 2010, the natural gas pipeline billionaire called his 9-acre palatial residence in Preston Hollow “a kid’s Disney World” and said he’d bought it in part so his 7-year-old son Klyde could enjoy features such as a baseball diamond, bowling alley, racquetball court, and indoor swimming pool. But Klyde’s no kid anymore. So can we expect “for sale” signs to go up any day now? Stay tuned.\n\n14. Gene and Jerry Jones\n\n$28,122,780\n\nSince they last won a Super Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys have lost almost twice as many playoff games—11—as the Joneses have bedrooms in this Highland Park home—six. With just one more playoff loss, Jerry will have been able to cry himself to sleep twice in each of those bedrooms.\n\n15. Debbie and John Tolleson\n\n$26,374,680\n\nDCAD says the home of the wealth manager and former SMU trustee is worth just more than $26 million, but the Tollesons say their 3-acre estate is worth a lot more. They listed their place in 2016 and in 2021, asking $39 million each time. Either no buyer would pony up that much or the Tollesons just can’t quit the joint.\n\n16. Suzanne and Patrick McGee\n\n$23,356,670\n\nPatrick could have changed his last name when he wed. Patrick Perot has a ring, no? Instead, as a prank on his father-in-law, he once gave Ross a camel for Christmas. The couple’s 18,653-sf Volk Estates house comes with a tennis court, which is no joke.\n\n17. Vaughn Vennerberg\n\n$23,031,780\n\nWhile calling a football game last year, Robert Griffin III said this when a quarterback named Alex Orji scored a touchdown: “It’s an orgy in the end zone!” What does that have to do with Vaughn Vennerberg and the 18,661-sf Highland Park home that the former XTO Energy executive built in 2011 just after ExxonMobil paid $31 billion for XTO? Nothing. But Vennerberg and RGIII are now co-owners of oil and gas company MorningStar Partners.\n\n18. Terry and Robert Rowling\n\n$22,573,450\n\nIn 1996, Rowling used $500 million from selling his family’s oilfields to buy Omni Hotels, whose daily operations he recently offloaded to his youngest son, Blake. Forbes says the elder Rowling (rhymes with “bowling”) is worth $5.5 billion. Only $2.8 million of this listing is the house; the rest is all sweet, sweet Highland Park land.\n\n19. Lisa and Kenny Troutt\n\n$22,427,150\n\nThe son of a bartending single mom, Troutt grew up in public housing. Now, after selling Excel Communications, he breeds thoroughbreds (his Justify won the Triple Crown), and his housing sits on 6.4 acres on Strait Lane and features an indoor basketball court.\n\n20. Scott Ginsburg\n\n$22,205,140\n\nHumble he ain’t. The Highland Park homeowner founded a giant radio broadcaster named Chancellor Media with Tom Hicks in 1997, a luxury auto dealership named Boardwalk Auto Group in 1998, and a flashy, short-lived restaurant named Voltaire in 1999. This is the opening line of his official bio: “Scott Ginsburg is known as one of the most esteemed businessmen in Dallas.” If he says so.\n\n21. Joshua Pack\n\n$21,860,260\n\nThis joint changed hands in 2021 when Thomas Hartland-Mackie, CEO of City Electric Supply, sold it to Pack, a managing partner of Fortress Investment Group. The listing described the estate as “a 1.802-acre masterpiece of privacy, elegance, and luxury living” and said “the interior has been meticulously crafted with exquisite detail.” One of those details is 10 wood-burning fireplaces.\n\n22. L&B REIG Trust\n\n$21,815,960\n\nThe famed Water Park House earned its nickname because the backyard does indeed contain what looks like a Preston Hollow version of Hurricane Harbor. It was built by Richard Malouf, a dentist, and sold to developer Mehrdad Moayedi, who told the Morning News in 2020 that he’d sold the 37,000-sf house to a trust. And so in Moayedi we must trust.\n\n23. James Dondero\n\n$21,705,860\n\nHighland Capital was such a successful investment firm that its former CEO, James Dondero, once told the Morning News that he liked to eat giraffe jerky. Then the firm entered bankruptcy in 2019, and things got messy, with a judge twice ruling him in contempt of court. By then, though, Dondero had bought Lisa Blue Baron’s 9-acre Robert A.M. Stern-designed estate next door to Mark Cuban (No. 26). Dondero also owns an $8.7 million house on Miramar Ave.\n\n24. H. Doug Barnes\n\n$21,699,940\n\nThe 20,649-sf Preston Hollow home of the founder of Eyemart Express is surrounded by dozens of tall palm trees, making it look like something out of Hollywood. That might be bad news for Barnes. In 2019, he unloaded his Beverly Hills mansion for just $35 million—$10 million less than what he’d originally asked. Barnes probably didn’t see that coming.\n\n25. Amanda and G. Brint Ryan\n\n$21,577,080\n\nAs of last year, his eponymous company, Ryan, was the largest indirect tax and property tax practice in North America, but his first job was a newspaper carrier for the Big Spring Herald, so we’ll go easy on him. DCAD rates the desirability of his property, which sits next to the paterfamilias Perot estate on Strait Lane, as “good.”\n\n26. Mark Cuban\n\n$21,187,400\n\nFun fact: Cuban is the only member of this list who has appeared as a guest on the D Magazine podcast. We didn’t ask him about his 24,000-sf French chateau-style house, for which he reportedly paid $13 million in 1999. Also, we didn’t ask him about his annual tax bill on the pad, which is approximately $450,139.12. But we did ask him about his $19 million vacation house in Laguna Beach.\n\n27. Les Ware\n\n$21,129,140\n\nSam Wyly bought this historic Highland Park home in 1965 for $160,000 and in 2017 sold it to patent attorney Ware for around $12.5 million. That tidy profit would have barely dented the $500 million settlement Wyly reached in 2019 with the IRS and SEC, which successfully sued Sam and his late brother Charles for tax evasion. And, yes, Ware also occupies the No. 9 spot on this list.\n\n28. Amy and Malone Mitchell\n\n$20,951,560\n\nThe oilman controls the 350,000-acre Longfellow Ranches, which one publication described as “legendary but ailing.” Perhaps he can comfort himself at one of the six wet bars (one more than he has bedrooms) in his 24,552-sf Highland Park house.\n\n29. Meadowbrook Trust\n\n$19,918,180\n\nWidower Richard Barrett is a noted art collector and, with his late wife, Nona, donated generously to the Dallas Museum of Art. Then, in 2021, their 26,063-sf Preston Hollow house on 4.3 acres wound up in a trust registered in Athens, Texas, a city less known for art and more for its museum dedicated to freshwater fishing.\n\n30. Myrna and Robert Schlegel\n\n$19,742,760\n\nThe estate constructed from 1989 to 1993 by the Ontario-born founder of Pavestone is no longer on the market, but in 2021 his daughter Kari Schlegel Kloewer was the agent on the $24 million listing. Forbes reported that “the master bedroom closet for the mistress of the house is four stories tall” and that when daughter Krystal married Luke Davis on the property, 525 guests attended. “Our kids once told me the formula for Pavestone’s success was simple,” Robert told Forbes. “You just put sand and dirt in on one side, and money comes out on the other.”\n\n31. Michael Herd\n\n$19,670,210\n\nWhen Dr. Wade Barker came home to his 16,098-sf Highland Park mansion, he could either tap in a few putts on the backyard green or recline under one of two cabanas. Then the doc pleaded guilty in a bribery and kickback scheme and was sentenced to five years in federal prison. Now the HP pad belongs to the grandson of oilionaire Bob Herd (the eponym of Texas Tech’s petroleum school) and his wife, Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of dating app Bumble.\n\n32. Terri and Bobby Brittingham\n\n$19,597,100\n\nBobby’s father, Robert M. Brittingham, founded Dal-Tile Corp., which was sold for $650 million in 1990 to an investment group that included Henry Kissinger. The Brittinghams’ 13,722-sf house on Beverly Drive is appraised at just $3,187,850. They landed on the list because that house sits on a double lot, which accounts for the other $16,409,250. Landed? Get it?\n\n33. Joyce and Larry Lacerte\n\n$19,456,230\n\nWe are here to help the founder of Lacerte Software. The appraisal district says his 17,038-sf house has a pool, but after looking from every angle on Google Earth, we disagree. The pool is across the street, and it belongs to the town of Highland Park. We’ll take half the property tax savings, thanks.\n\n34. Mahmood Khimji\n\n$19,312,120\n\nKnown as the Beck House, this midcentury modern marvel—built in 1964 by famed architect Philip Johnson—was bought in 2021 by a co-founder of Highgate Hotels. Khimji’s company was recently dubbed “the quiet hotel powerhouse.” But there’s nothing quiet about his home. Dallas architecture critic Mark Lamster has said of the house, “It is the effigy of opulence. It’s so Dallas, and it’s perfect.”\n\n35. Michelle and Meade Monger\n\n$18,871,100\n\nHis name suggests he sells an alcoholic drink made with fermented honey, but Meade Monger works in healthcare. Last year he founded Century Goal, which, according to his LinkedIn, is “dedicated to helping healthcare providers and payers understand operating/financial challenges along with solutions to these challenges so providers can focus on care.” The couple’s 16,600-sf Volk Estates house has two wet bars.\n\n36. Mary and Albert Huddleston\n\n$18,795,110\n\nBack in 1976, the New York Times reported on a birthday party for Bunker Hunt, son of oilionaire H.L. Hunt. The Times said that Bunker’s daughter, Mary, made a custard pie for dessert and that her date, Albert, “didn’t say anything at all.” Mary and Albert now share a 14,551-sf home near the Dallas Country Club. Silence is golden.\n\n37. Brad Heppner\n\n$18,761,910\n\nA group of investors is suing Brad Heppner’s Beneficient Company, alleging it fraudulently took more than $1 billion out of their pockets. Beneficient says the investors are being hornswoggled by their own attorneys and that their payout may still come. Heppner may not be getting any relief from the court case at home because an extensive renovation project has been going on at the eight-bedroom, 12-bath Turtle Creek estate he shares with his wife, Aurelia.\n\n38. Charlotte Jones\n\n$18,693,470\n\nShe used to have three names. Now, with the rather public divorce, it’s just the two. Except in DCAD’s records, where the “Anderson” still hangs around, to everyone’s great annoyance, kind of like Rowdy, another man that the Cowboys executive should ditch.\n\n39. Nancy and Richard Rogers\n\n$18,539,240\n\nIf your name is Nancy and you’re married to a man who reportedly owns half of Mary Kay Cosmetics and you live in a six-bedroom, seven-bath, 17,194-sf home that contains a gilded media room that has its own concession stand, would you refer to yourself as “Fancy Nancy”? Nancy Rogers’ IG handle—@fancyncr—suggests the answer is yes.\n\n40. Ashley Nadeau\n\n$18,500,000\n\nFor years, Ashley and Michael Nadeau owned this house on Turtle Creek and another house 6 miles north, in Preston Hollow, valued at just $3.2 million. Michael, a motorsports enthusiast, owns Eleven Wellness + IV in Preston Center. And according to public records, he now owns only the smaller of the two houses, where he lives with a social media entrepreneur named Suzi Nadeau.\n\n41. Carol and Steve Aaron\n\n$18,444,790\n\nPsst. Want some reefer? The Aarons have plenty. More than anyone else in Texas, probably. But neighbors to their six-bed, nine-bath home near Ursuline Academy aren’t complaining. Because “reefer” is the industry term for “refrigerated trucks.” Steve is CEO of Stevens Transport, one of the largest privately owned refrigerated trucking companies in the country.\n\n42. Elaine and Trevor Pearlman\n\n$18,382,610\n\nTrevor is an attorney from South Africa who founded Tregan Partners. Elaine is an entrepreneur who started making her own vegan granola after a breast cancer diagnosis. Her Park Lane Pantry granola was a finalist in H-E-B’s 2021 Quest for the Best Competition (which was won by Dallas’ Kelli Watts, of Savor Pâtisserie, for her macarons). The couple’s 17,824-sf Park Lane house sits on nearly 6 acres.\n\n43. Trudy and Bob Ladd\n\n$18,177,830\n\nThe Ladds’ 19,252-sf Highland Park manse was once named one of Dallas’ most beautiful homes. But, man, the most beautiful things in that whole place are the kitchen cabinets. Such craftsmanship! Or at least that’s what we imagine Bob, who founded Duncanville’s Quality Cabinets in 1969, might say.\n\n44. Patrick Sands\n\n$18,080,560\n\nWhen Caroline Rose Hunt, daughter of H.L. Hunt, gave birth to Patrick, his brother, Stephen, was 17 years old. They ended up in business together at Hunt’s Rosewood Corp., where Stephen was the boss. If that engendered any sibling rivalry, Patrick now has the upper hand. His 11,594-sf Highland Park home is both larger and appraised higher than his big brother’s nearby house.\n\n45. Cheryl and Billy Don Henry\n\n$18,000,000\n\nHe founded MHBT, one of the nation’s largest independent insurance brokers, which was acquired in 2015 by Marsh & McLennan Agency, aka MMA. When Texas Tech’s Rawls College of Business recognized him in 2021 as a distinguished alumnus, the school said, “Bill is focused on maintaining a unique culture that practices being ‘Pied Pipers’ for ‘P.L.U.’s’ (People Like Us) … .” His 16,277-sf house sits right across the street from Nancy Marcus’ (No. 63).\n\n46. Rachael and Robert H. Dedman Jr.\n\n$17,669,620\n\nDedman père founded ClubCorp after acquiring the land for Brookhaven Country Club in 1957. The son eventually took over and was once called one of the most powerful men in golf (even with a 12 handicap). Now ClubCorp is called Invited, which is about as crazy as Rachael’s conspiracy theory that then DA Craig Watkins was in league with Lisa Blue Baron to soak Al Hill III for $50 million in legal fees. But Rachael was right. Let that be remembered. Which is maybe why her last post to Facebook is from 2013, about those shenanigans. The Dedmans’ house was built in 2014.\n\n47. Toni and Dan Hunt\n\n$17,543,780\n\nBefore the end of this year, when FIFA is set to announce where the 2026 World Cup finals will be held, it seems possible that Dan, brother of Clark, son of Lamar, and chairman of Dallas’ host city bid for the World Cup, will try to convince FIFA president Gianni Infantino to bring the finals to Dallas by inviting Infantino to his six-bedroom, six-bath Highland Park house and perhaps offering the Swiss football chief a chilled glass of Franciacorta under the home’s 360-sf porte cochère. Because that would not be bribery.\n\n48. Shanin and Bryan Wilburn\n\n$17,443,620\n\nBryan founded Southwest Risk in 2004 and then, in 2010, became the CEO of ClearView Risk Holdings after that company acquired Southwest Risk. He left ClearView Risk to found Risk Theory in 2012. The guy is into risk, is what we’re saying. The Wilburns listed their house in 2015 for $29,995,000. Then they took it off the market. Too risky.\n\n49. Jayesha and Atif Hussain\n\n$17,413,810\n\nJayesha is a dentist, and Atif is a cardiologist. So we can only assume that in the 19,624-sf Armstrong Avenue pad that the couple bought from Bob Kaminski they’re looping the song “My Heart Has Teeth,” by deadmau5, in all eight bedrooms and in the 1,044-sf outdoor living area by the pool. But probably not in their 3,229-sf garage.\n\n50. Nancy and Clint Carlson\n\n$17,372,500\n\nIf you google “Carlson Capital,” the third result in the news tab concerns a former Fox News employee’s relation to events on January 6, 2021. Such is the world we live in, a world where Clint Carlson’s Carlson Capital’s Double Black Diamond returned 13.3 percent in 2021, according to Business Insider, yet the AUM of its flagship fund decreased to $595 million from $3 billion just a few years earlier. It’s OK. The estimated annual property tax on this house is only $239,827.23.\n\n51. Gayle and Paul Stoffel\n\n$17,321,840\n\nAnticipating a ban on incandescent lighting, art collector Gayle Stoffel stocked up on the old-style bulbs to keep lit a work she and her late husband Paul bought from artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres. The artist was known for stringing together lights and calling them “sculptures.” Presumably the extra bulbs are stashed in Sterilite bins, which, if styled well, could probably also fetch a fat stack of cabbage at auction.\n\n52. Shannon and Sam Gilliland\n\n$17,258,700\n\nSam, a former Sabre executive, took a new job last year as CEO of Accelya Group, “a leading global technology and service provider to the air transport industry.” Around the same time, Shannon gave a four-star review to a $962 fireplace screen, writing: “Fine—just not as beautiful as other option I had. It went back.” The couple’s Highland Park home has eight fireplaces, so presumably she knows a thing or two about fireplace screens.\n\n53. Lydia and Bill Addy\n\n$17,235,780\n\nIf the names sound familiar, chances are that you listen to KERA 90.1. They donate generously through their Addy Foundation. Bill is the executive chairman of ISN Software. Their University Park property once belonged to Dick Bass’ widow, Alice. Last year, they completed construction on a new 17,530-sf house, which stands next door to Gerald Ford’s (No. 5).\n\n54. Lana and Barry Andrews\n\n$17,023,750\n\nThe couple started Andrews Distributing Company in Corpus Christi in 1976 with 11 employees; now it has 1,600. Public records don’t indicate whether the two wet bars at their Beverly Drive house, built in 2009, are stocked with Colt 45. Ditto Schlitz.\n\n55. Carolyn and Karl Rathjen\n\n$16,936,410\n\nKarl is an assistant chief of staff and an orthopedic surgeon at Scottish Rite for Children. He coauthored a paper titled “Complications Associated With Epiphysiodesis for Management of Leg Length Discrepancy.” Total gas! Carolyn—the Perot daughter whose 1992 wedding temporarily stopped H. Ross Perot’s presidential campaign—is a VP at both the Perot Foundation and the Bette Rathjen Foundation for Emotional Health.\n\n56. Elisa Summers\n\n$16,720,100\n\nThe Summerses’ home near Highland Park Village matches the Mediterranean architectural style of the shopping center, where high-end cow cuts and habiliments are sold. The house was built in 2010, just after Elisa and husband Stephen teamed with Ray Washburne and Heather Hill Washburne to buy HP Village. Elisa and Heather, daughters of Al Hill Jr., are Hunts.\n\n57. Jerry Freeman Jr.\n\n$16,706,180\n\nHis father, who died in 2021, started Freeman Oldsmobile in Garland in 1951, eventually growing it into the sprawling Freeman Automobile Group, where the younger Freeman cut his teeth in the car business. The architect Wilson Fuqua doubled the size of this Volk Estates house, which has two attached garages. That’s where the cars go.\n\n58. Veruschka and Thomas Dundon\n\n$16,666,660\n\nHe owns Pickleball.com and has two pickleball courts outside his 13,556-sf, eight-bed, eight-bath home overlooking Northwest Highway. Dundon also owns the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes. So is there a hockey rink hiding inside his 7,500-sf cabana? If you get an invitation to play at the billionaire’s digs, let us know.\n\n59. Kanika and Vinay Jain\n\n$16,659,020\n\nWhen last we checked in on the couple, their foundation had plans to build a South Asian museum and cultural center on a 4.7-acre site at Woodall Rodgers and Field Street. Instead they sold the dirt to developers; in the five years that they held it, the property’s appraisal jumped from $15.3 million to $22.6 million. The Jains’ estate, complete with its own lake, occupies 7.5 acres on Inwood Road.\n\n60. Helen and John Carona\n\n$16,655,440\n\nIn 2017, just before the Caronas bought it, this 3.2-acre Preston Hollow estate was featured on CNBC’s Secret Lives of the Super Rich. But surely a former state senator wouldn’t be hiding any secrets inside a 16,984-sf home, especially not one that has 13 fireplaces.\n\n61. John Harkey\n\n$16,488,330\n\nHarkey, a serial entrepreneur who founded multiple biotech companies and now heads Consolidated Restaurant Companies, which owns Cantina Laredo and Good Eats, was once described as being “Johnny Depp thin, with Ronald Reagan hair.” When he bought his home, adjacent to the Dallas Country Club, in 2017, it was described as “the perfect private oasis.” Only one of those descriptions is a compliment.\n\n62. Laura and Spencer Siino\n\n$16,388,450\n\nThe Highland Park home of the CEO of surety bond company Jet Insurance has four beds, four baths, two garages, a cabana, and a library that must lack books. When he ran a losing campaign for Highland Park ISD, Siino said Thomas Jefferson’s first draft of the Declaration of Independence “outlawed slavery” (it did not and could not) and that all the Founding Fathers “were classically educated.” Nope. Not George Washington.\n\n63. Nancy Marcus\n\n$16,303,000\n\nThis might get confusing. Nancy is not related to the Neiman Marcus Marcuses. She’s a former literature professor at the UD and SMU and the ex-wife of Jeff Marcus, founder of Marcus Cable. Nancy’s historic 1929 home was once owned by Lucy Ball. Not Lucille Ball, whose show once aired on Marcus Cable TV, but Lucy Ball Owsley, a late heiress of the glass-jar Ball Corp.\n\n64. Leslie and Bill Cornog\n\n$16,222,450\n\nThe Cornogs might not have the top spot on our list, but Bill does have the biggest flex. On his LinkedIn, there is one entry above “Global Lead Partner, KKR Capstone, Sep 2002–Jun 2022.” That entry is “Husband and Soccer Dad, Self-employed, Jul 2022–Present.” He and Leslie bought this Frank Welch-designed Volk Estates house in 2014 from Diane Buchanan and Richard Andrew.\n\n65. Ryan Rogers\n\n$16,147,980\n\nMary Kay Ash once lived in a classical Preston Hollow home that was painted in a soft pink. But the home of her grandson, Ryan Rogers, and his wife, Maleiah, is a modernist white and gold. Ryan does have something in common with Grandma: he now runs the company she founded, after taking over as CEO earlier this year.\n\n66. Kay Moran\n\n$16,125,060\n\nRemember Sound Warehouse? In 1972, Kay Moran founded the record store chain with her late first husband, Dan, and sold it in 1989 for $132.5 million. She is also the widow of William McCord, once the president, chairman, and CEO of Enserch Corp., who died in 1998. Moran owned People Newspapers, which she sold in 2003 to Wick Allison, D Magazine’s late co-founder. According to DCAD, her Highland Park home has zero bedrooms.\n\n67. Megha and Nirav Tolia\n\n$15,998,220\n\nNirav, the co-founder of Nextdoor and a “recurring shark” on Shark Tank, must have looked at the 1910 Highland Park home built for Dallas doctor Edward Henry Cary and later acquired by the Hill-Hunt family and said, “I’m out.” He and Megha, the COO of Shondaland, decided to raze the Cary estate and have been building new alongside Turtle Creek Park since 2021.\n\n68. Teresa and John Amend\n\n$15,904,140\n\nIn 1999, the real estate tycoon and his wife bought the one-time White Rock Lake home of H.L. Hunt. Hunt was reportedly the inspiration for the Dallas character J.R. Ewing. So here’s one of J.R.’s best quotes: “A marriage is like a salad. The man has to know how to keep his tomatoes on the top!”\n\n69. Marcellene and Stephen Sands\n\n$15,651,780\n\nBefore he bought his own Highland Park mansion, the eldest son of the late Caroline Rose Hunt bought The Mansion on Turtle Creek. The place had been a private home that was slated for demolition. Hunt wanted to save it, so Steve converted it to a swanky bar, restaurant, and hotel. That’s why, today, you can go there and get a Japanese wagyu strip loin for $35 per ounce—4-ounce minimum.\n\n70. Lori and Jerry Jones Jr.\n\n$15,593,620\n\nOn The Ticket, Dallas’ most popular sports station, Jerry Jr. is frequently portrayed as a petulant schoolboy who wants another juice box. If the running joke bothers the chief sales and marketing officer of the Dallas Cowboys, he can mellow out in front of one of his eight fireplaces in his Bordeaux Avenue house. Or he can chill on his mom’s yacht.\n\n71. Sharon and Terry Worrell\n\n$15,521,530\n\nThere were morality police in Texas long before our current crazy times, which Terry could tell you all about if you visited the 2.3-acre University Park estate that he and Sharon bought from T. Boone Pickens in 1996. Six years before that, a Dallas district attorney charged record store chain Sound Warehouse (see No. 66), where Worrell was CEO, with distributing obscene materials—specifically 2 Live Crew’s As Nasty as They Wanna Be.\n\n72. Kyle Miller\n\n$15,494,070\n\nKyle Miller, an energy executive whose home is new to the top 100 list this year, is an SMU graduate and booster who is paying SMU football players—legally, as part of the NCAA’s NIL rules. One imagines, then, that Miller and his wife Katy might use the 840-sf cabana in the back of their Highland Park home to hold totally ethical recruitment events that are totally unlike SMU’s scandalous 1980s goings-on.\n\n73. Jean and Mack Pogue\n\n$15,356,090\n\nMack got rich renting party pads to recent grads. In 1965, he founded Lincoln Property Co., the developer and owner of The Village apartment complex. Pogue handed off his CEO title earlier this year, but he’s still an owner of the company and, with his wife, of a Highland Park home that’s as big as 18 one-bedroom apartments in The Village Chase. IYKYK.\n\n74. Betsy and Guinn Crousen\n\n$15,253,630\n\nAt the Crousen’s 17,865-sf Highland Park home, which was built in 2010, two bighorn rams peer out of a flowerbed. They’re not alive, of course. They’re sculptures. Another not-alive ram is somewhere inside the octagon-shaped home. Guinn, the president of Progressive Inc., which makes aluminum parts for the aerospace industry, shot that formerly living ram dead (legally) back in 2000.\n\n75. Kim and Bill Shaddock\n\n$15,095,840\n\nIn 2019, the couple bought a five-bedroom, six-and-a-half bath Mediterranean/Spanish home in University Park that had been built in 1936 and looked like old Hollywood, with its brick archways, stone fireplaces, and rough-hewn lumber on the ceilings. That old house is gone. Bill, who owns a collection of title, mortgage, and development companies, began building a new, bigger, English-style home on the site in 2020.\n\n76. Betty Lou Phillips and John Roach\n\n$15,082,170\n\nWith degrees from MIT and Stanford, Roach has done well for himself in business, holding positions at VeriSign, Stonegate International, and Unidare. But he’s best known for having founded Builders FirstSource, a distributor of building products. Phillips is an interior designer and author. Not only has she written books about design, but she also wrote the children’s book Emily Goes Wild. In describing the couple’s place in Beaver Creek, Colorado, to Traditional Home, Phillips said, “We take long walks and sit on the deck and talk about our latest globe-hopping, our passion for the arts, whatever.”\n\n77. Guillermo Perales\n\n$14,939,850\n\nSure, there’s an 838-sf cabana in the backyard of Perales’ contemporary 14,737-sf home near Ursuline. But the owner need not be out there flipping burgers. The CEO of Sun Holdings is a big franchisor whose 800 locations include Popeyes, Cici’s, Burger King, and Arby’s. So you know he has the beef.\n\n78. Catherine Fancher\n\n$14,739,430\n\nIn 2012, the attorney—who has repped oil and gas companies, real estate concerns, and Blockbuster—sold her house and spent the next five years traveling to 33 countries. If she sells this five-bed, five-bath home along Turtle Creek, she’ll either have enough scratch to visit the world’s other 162 countries or to buy about a third of Tuvalu.\n\n79. Christy Thompson\n\n$14,673,670\n\nIn 2021, oil heiress and real estate investor Christy Thompson bought this five-bed, six-bath Highland Park home, which was listed as among “the most distinguished architectural homes in Dallas.” The home is one of two Thompson owns on this list; the other is No. 6. It can hold more than 100 people for a sit-down dinner. But then, so can VFW Post 6796. And they serve beer can chicken.\n\n80. Joshua Friedman\n\n$14,622,490\n\nJosh co-founded Canyon Partners. He has three degrees from Harvard but only one from Oxford. The house on Bordeaux Avenue was built on spec and was once owned by James Dondero (No. 23).\n\n81. Bryce Williams\n\n$14,590,750\n\nThe St. Mark’s graduate is the CEO of Dallas-based HealthMine, which promises to “evaluate and prioritize gap closure to achieve higher Star Ratings through predictive analytics, omnichannel engagement, and dynamic intervention planning.” If you know what any of that means, then you, too, could probably afford to buy a newly built, 12,073-sf home on Beverly Drive.\n\n82. Alinda Hill Wikert\n\n$14,487,920\n\nAlinda, one of Margaret Hunt Hill’s three children, got a helicopter pilot’s license in 1983 and has owned several small aviation companies since. So you have to figure that she has sat in the large courtyard at the center of her 14,469-sf Highland Park home and wondered, Could I land a chopper up in here?\n\n83. Jeremy Ford\n\n$14,393,710\n\nDCAD gave his home a “very poor” desirability rating in 2023, likely because of an ongoing construction project. Props to Ford, who is the son of SMU megadonor and trustee Gerald J. Ford and CEO of a family-held investment firm, for gussying up rather than tearing down his historic, midcentury property. Other Highland Parkers should follow his lead.\n\n84. Kathy Levy\n\n$14,257,010\n\nShe is the granddaughter of Milton P. Levy, who in 1919 founded what is now NCH Corp. The company remains under family control, selling commercial cleaning products and other chemicals, including a probiotic that launched in 2023 and promises to help cannabis plants grow. Business must be good. In 2020, Levy sold another Highland Park home for $2.1 million and moved to her current spot, which was built in 2015.\n\n85. J. Baxter Brinkmann\n\n$14,249,310\n\nIn 1979, Texas Monthly called him a “second level social climber.” Since then, the owner of The Brinkmann Corp., whose subsidiaries make everything from pet beds to outdoor lighting, has climbed himself up to Preston Hollow, where he’s neighbors with Howard Rachofsky and owner of what has been called “one of the finest estate homes in Dallas.” Take that, TxMo.\n\n86. Cam Chalmers\n\n$14,246,480\n\nHe created Study Island (now Archipelago Learning), an online tool for students, with his business partner and Vanderbilt fraternity brother David Muzzo. The company had an IPO in 2010. In 2011, when the property was listed for $7.8 million, D Magazine called the Highland Park house a “fixer-upper.” Apparently Chalmers did just that.\n\n87. Sharon and Don Tomnitz\n\n$14,044,120\n\nDon, the executive chairman of Forestar, a subsidiary of homebuilding giant D.R. Horton, lives by this motto: “You need to get up and act like you are broke every day.” So surely he doesn’t sleep in any of the four bedrooms at his 8,838-sf Highland Park home, but rather bunks on a cot in the 713-sf garage.\n\n88. Amy and Bruce Williams\n\n$14,001,100\n\nHe is one of the late Mary Anne Sammons Cree’s sons. It was her money that, in 2009, begat the Elaine D. and Charles A. Sammons Park outside of the AT&T Center, a performance park with a reflecting pool and a giant slatted roof. So when he built his 6,809-sf home alongside Turtle Creek, you better believe he included a slatted roof in his outdoor entertaining area.\n\n89. Karen and Stephen Jones\n\n$13,968,470\n\nYou wonder. How does Stephen feel living in the cheapest of the Jones family houses on this list? And then the answer comes to you in a flash: just fine.\n\n90. Jane and Ron Beneke\n\n$13,944,560\n\nThe co-founder of B/K Multifamily—where he has built a $1.5 billion tax-exempt, bond-financed apartment portfolio—and his wife listed their house in 2021 for $15.75 million before apparently changing their minds. The 14,407-sf Spanish Colonial on Armstrong Parkway was designed by John Allen Boyle, the original architect of the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek.\n\n91. Lacy and John Clayton Sands\n\n$13,927,710\n\nHe is a director at The Rosewood Corporation and is the son of David Keith Sands. That makes him a grandson to Caroline Rose Hunt. In 2019, he and wife Lacy bought the Preston Hollow home of golfer Lee Trevino, then converted it into a sand trap before building a 13,536-sf home on the 4.9-acre lot.\n\n92. Rachel and Randal Polka\n\n$13,920,930\n\nRachel is the daughter of Steven Ross, a giant in the plastics industry who founded Grand Prairie-based Poly-America in 1976. Ross died in 2009, but the company has carried on. It’s a safe bet that the trash bags in the kitchen at the Polkas’ 20,132-sf northwest Dallas home are Poly-America’s Husky brand.\n\n93. Ann and Lee Hobson\n\n$13,823,000\n\nHis Highside Capital Management was one of the first tenants at the invitation-only Old Parkland, a former hospital complex converted into an elegant, colonnaded investing campus. The couple’s Highland Park home is plenty elegant, too. It was built in 1935 and designed by architect Hal Thomson.\n\n94. Richard Gussoni\n\n$13,796,930\n\nIf you’re the owner of a long-established catering company, you need a lot of wet bars. The founder of Culinaire International, whose grandfather was once head chef at the Vatican under Pope Pius XII, has four such bars in his 18,461-sf home that looks straight out of Renaissance Italy.\n\n95. Rosemary and Jim Strode\n\n$13,755,560\n\nThe developer has been stirring up controversy while moving dirt in University Park’s quirky Snider Plaza since 2016. First, he tore down a long-vacant bank building and put up a bigger, shinier tower. Then, after beloved Peggy Sue BBQ closed, he tore down the low-slung building that housed it and began building bigger again.\n\n96. Michael Scott Anderson\n\n$13,677,600\n\nDo not wager if you play golf with this attorney, because the guy must get a lot of practice at his Preston Hollow home. His backyard putting green is actually two greens, both linked by a fairway. They’re surrounded by five bunkers and a private pond that serves as a water hazard.\n\n97. Tavia and Clark Hunt\n\n$13,619,130\n\nHere’s one thing the couple could not have seen coming when they bought their tasteful limestone sided, six-bed, seven-bath Highland Park home in 2000: that 5-year-old Patrick Mahomes from Tyler would lead the Hunt-owned Kansas City Chiefs to two Super Bowl wins.\n\n98. Nancy and Randy Best\n\n$13,562,720\n\nIn 2020, the Bests donated $10 million to build a wild LED-lit fountain in Klyde Warren Park. At home they like running water, too. Their northwest Dallas compound includes nine bathrooms and five half baths. Also, Randy, a private education entrepreneur, has a thing for natural stuff. He owns a small collection of saber-toothed tiger skulls.\n\n99. Beverly Parkhurst\n\n$13,378,670\n\nThe Strait Lane home that Beverly and her late husband, Arlis, moved into is historic. Not just because it was built in 1939 in a whimsical, storybook architectural style known as French Eclectic (which would also make a great band name) but because, at Beverly’s insistence, it received a “historical overlay” designation from the city of Dallas in 2023, making it difficult to someday demolish.\n\n100. Candace Crawford and Tony Romo\n\n$13,311,220\n\nIn the backyard of Tony Romo’s home, which is perched above White Rock Creek in Glen Abbey, there’s a football field that has goalposts on each end. Does the former Dallas Cowboy, who now makes $18 million per year predicting NFL plays on CBS, go out on that field and pretend to hold that 2006 field goal snap cleanly? Probably.\n\nThe small print: Home values come from the Dallas Central Appraisal District. We used 2022 certified values, as protests on 2023 proposed values were still ongoing as D Magazine began its research, in April. If a spouse’s name doesn’t appear on the list, that’s because the spouse’s name wasn’t in DCAD’s ownership records. If an owner didn’t appear on the list in 2018 but had appeared on one of the previous seven iterations, going back to 2003, then we made every effort to label that owner as a “return.”"
