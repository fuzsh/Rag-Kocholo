        "text": "These are the top five-star recruits since 2000\n\nWho are the best high-school football players to emerge on the college recruiting scene this century? And where do the likes of Arch Manning and Trevor Lawrence rank? Here's a rundown of the top five-star-rated recruits since 2000; 54 players in all are ranked. Our updated list is based on247Sports’ All-Time Football Players recruiting rankings, as well as the247Sports Composite ratings for the recruiting classes of2022 and2023.\n\nOur rundown here is so packed with elites that you’ll find a tie at the No. 1 spot, with the seven players rated as perfect 1.0000s by the 247 Composite formula. (Where there were ties, we’ve listed players alphabetically.) The “lowest” score you’ll find here is 0.9988.\n\nOur list runs from old school to new school. Three players hail from the recruiting Class of 2000; three hail from theClass of 2023. Overall, the player scores are current as of publication date.\n\nSome of the standouts on this list went on to star for colleges such as Alabama,Clemson,USC andTexas. Some saw their skills translate to success in the NFL. And some saw their careers top out at high school. But once upon a time, they wereall greats.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9988\n\nThis 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker from Miami Carol City Senior High School in Miami Gardens, Florida, drew comparisons to Lawrence Taylor. But \"college football's first celebrity recruit,\" as Bleacher Report labeled this standout from the 2004 recruiting class, was not to be a gridiron legend for long. He bounced from Miami, to junior college, to Louisville (where he was dismissed from the team) to a prison stint in Kentucky.\n\nOf late, Williams was back in South Florida, working as a coach and trainer -- and sharing lessons learned along the way. \"...[I]t was so crazy where I felt like I made it before I made it,” Williams told Miami's WSVN in 2021. \"...[But] this my calling because I felt so good giving back.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9988\n\nThis standout defensive end from Florida's IMG Academy was the overall No. 3-rated player in the 2018 recruiting class. He took his college game to Clemson.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9988\n\nBefore his eight-season-long NFL career, and before his Rose Bowl-winning run with USC, Mark Sanchez was the pride of Mission Viejo, California. He was the top-rated QB and the No. 3-rated talent overall in the 2005 recruiting class.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9988\n\nCharles Rogers had it all. At Michigan's Saginaw High, he was the top-rated receiver in the 2000 recruiting class. At Michigan State, he was a unanimous All-American. At the 2003 NFL Draft, he was the No. 2 overall pick of the Detroit Lions. But then the music stopped. Injuries and personal troubles doomed him to just 15 pro games over three seasons. Rogers died in 2019 at the age of 38. \"Everyone around Saginaw loved Charles Rogers … everyone,” a former Saginaw High teammate told MLive.com.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9988\n\nSeantrel Henderson was an offensive tackle out of Cretin-Derham Hall in Minnesota. USA Today's one-time high-school Offensive Player of the Year was the No. 2-rated talent of the 2010 recruiting class. He starred in college for Miami, and was a seventh-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9988\n\nCam Newton and Tyrod Taylor were both quarterbacks in the 2007 recruiting class, but they weren't Jimmy Clausen. Per scouts, Clausen, out of Oaks Christian School in Westlake Village, California, was the QB. In 2006, Clausen rolled up in a white Hummer limo to announce he was going to take his talents to Notre Dame. A second-round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft, Clausen's pro career consisted of 22 games over four seasons.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9989\n\nThis defensive end from Eastside Catholic in Sammamish, Washington, was the No. 3 talent in the 2021 recruiting class. 247Sports' Brandon Huffman called J.T. Tuimoloau \"[p]owerful, athletic and nimble.\" Tuimoloau committed to Ohio State, and appeared in all 13 games for the Buckeyes in 2021.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9989\n\nThe 2017 247Sports Composite National Player of the Year, Jaelen Phillips impressed at Redlands East Valley in Redlands, California. The defensive end set off for UCLA, but transferred to Miami after two seasons.\n\nIn the 2021 NFL Draft, Phillips was a first-round pick for the Miami Dolphins.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9989\n\nThis five-star offensive tackle out of Florida's IMG Academy was part of Alabama's historically great 2021 recruiting class. 247Sports ranked JC Latham as Alabama's 12th-most important player heading into the 2022 college football season.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9990\n\nIn 2002, St. Bonaventure High's Whitney Lewis bested the likes of Helix High's Reggie Bush to win the Los Angeles Times' Glenn Davis Award, presented annually to the top high-school football player in Southern California. The wide receiver headed off to USC, but only played sparingly for the Trojans before transferring to Northern Iowa.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9990\n\nThis speedster and track star quite nearly ran to the top of 2006's recruiting class via Landstown High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Championships with the Florida Gators and Seattle Seahawks ensued.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9991\n\nThe son of former South Carolina linebacker Derrick Little, the 6-foot-6 Greg Little opted for Ole Miss after a run as the 2016 recruiting class' best offensive lineman. The Carolina Panthers selected the younger Little in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9991\n\nA high-school All-American out of Apopka High in Apopka, Florida, this powerful run-blocker was the overall No. 2-rated talent in the 2015 recruiting class. He went on to play at Florida, and in the XFL.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nIn the 2005 recruiting class, DeSean Jackson was a Top 25-rated talent, but Patrick Turner out of Goodpasture Christian School, in Madison, Tennessee was the top-rated receiver and the overall No. 2-ranked player. Turner went on to USC, and a 24-game career in the NFL.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nThis explosive defensive tackle from Westover Comprehensive High in Albany, Georgia, was the top-rated player in the 2015 recruiting class. He went on to a college career with Georgia. Undrafted by the NFL, Thompson caught on with the Canadian Football League.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nIn the star-packed recruiting class of 2014, this future first-round NFL draft pick and Heisman Trophy finalist from New Jersey's Paramus Catholic High was the overall No. 3-rated player. Peppers joined the New York Giants in 2019.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nThis offensive tackle from Plainfield High in New Jersey was the top-rated player of the 2005 recruiting class. Monroe went on to play for Virginia, and log seven seasons in the NFL for the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens. Monroe was the eighth overall pick of the 2009 NFL Draft.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nCormani McClain is a nearly 6-foot-2 cornerback out of Florida's Lakeland High. He's the first member of the 2023 recruiting class on this list -- that pool's No. 3-ranked overall talent, and the top-rated defensive player. As of publication, McClain had not committed to a college. The 247Sports scouting report by Andrew Ivins called McClain a \"new-age cornerback prospect that almost looks like he was made in some type of create-a-player mode.\"\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nThis 6-foot-5, defensive tackle drew attention at Wake Forest High in Wake Forest, North Carolina, for his size and strength. He was the overall No. 2-rated player of the 2016 recruiting class. After a standout career with the Clemson Tigers, Lawrence was selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nKevin Jones was an elite running back from Cardinal O'Hara in Springfield, Pennsylvania, who was judged the top talent of the 2001 recruiting class. Jones went on to play at Virginia Tech, and enjoy a career in the NFL with the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions.\n\n247Sports Composite Rating: 0.9992\n\nThe Pro Bowl wide receiver first turned heads at Foley High in Foley, Alabama. The standout was the overall No. 3-rated player from the 2008 recruiting class. Jones enjoyed a three-year college career with Alabama before becoming the sixth overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft.
