        "text": "As our club embarks on a new, exciting era it was very happy before Saturday’s match against Larne, to welcome back onto the Oval pitch and to recognise some of the greatest players ever to represent Glentoran.

Serious Glentoran pedigree there!\n\nWhile 25 Glentoran Greats made it on the day, several equally famous and well-loved legends were sadly unable to attend.
