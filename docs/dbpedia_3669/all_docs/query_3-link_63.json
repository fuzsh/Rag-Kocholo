        "text": "Authors of the Adriatic Pilot\n\nDinah and Trevor Thompson have been keen sailors since childhood, sailing both dinghies and yachts for some 50 years. They began writing in 1974 with articles appearing in Practical Boatowner, Classic Boat, Sailing Today and even Cat World to name but a few. They’re authors of Adriatic Pilot, first published by Imray in 1986 and now in its eighth edition. Trevor began his time at sea studying at Reardon Smith Nautical College in Cardiff, followed by a brief stint in the Merchant Navy. Dinah began sailing with her family and had a half share in an Enterprise dinghy, which was mainly sailed in Poole harbour. Later Trevor and she sailed Lark dinghies in South Wales.\n\nAfter meeting at Cardiff University in 1973, Dinah and Trevor pooled their resources to buy a sailing cruiser, a 17' Lysander. In that boat they sailed long distances around the Bristol Channel, and getting as far as St Ives. It was with that boat that their writing career started, when they researched and wrote a series of pilotage articles for Practical Boatowner.\n\nThe next boat was another wooden sailing cruiser, which was sailed extensively in Welsh waters and then on the east coast of Scotland. That boat was replaced by Joleta of Pettycur, a 26' junk rigged boat that Trevor fitted out himself. It was in Joleta that they set off to sail to the Mediterranean, and the boat which was their floating home in the Adriatic.\n\nToday they own an historic Fairey Marine Titania which they sail from Milford Haven. Over the years they have sailed extensively in UK and European waters and the Mediterranean.\n\nKeen to pass on their knowledge to the next generation, Trevor has worked as a sailing instructor for local sailing centres and as relief engineer and skipper on various Sea Cadet Corps vessels. Dinah has also been involved with the Sea Cadets, as relief coxswain and cook on the Sea Cadets offshore fleet.\n\nIn addition to their sailing and writing Trevor worked as a lecturer in the further education sector for over 20 years, whilst Dinah dedicated her time to raising their two sons. Trevor has now retired, whilst Dinah is following her passion for history by working as a guide at a local castle. They’re still keen sailors which they supplement by looking after their elderly collie and demanding cat! Both of their sons are now grown up, but have inherited their parents love for the sea, with the elder son continuing the nautical tradition by serving in the Royal Navy. Dinah and Trevor intend to continue sailing, exploring and writing well into their retirement."
