        "text": "Thomas John “Tommy” Thompson Jr.\n\nAge 62, of Cottage Grove\n\nPassed away peacefully at Woodwinds Hospital Woodbury, Minnesota on April 25, 2022. Preceded in death by parents, Thomas Sr. and Joan (nee Starkey); sister, Norma Kirchner; brother-in law, Neil Ganther; nephew, Matty Ganther; and former spouse, Sue Watt. Survived by son, Trevor; sisters, Linda Skinaway, Laura Thompson, and Wendy Ganther; many nieces, nephews, cousins, and lifelong friends.\n\nTommy was born on November 23,1959, in Minneapolis, Minnesota to parents, Thomas Sr. and Joan Thompson. This brought an end to the family’s summer touring acrobatic act titled Tommy and His Girls. As the only boy and much loved youngest of five children Tommy Jr. endured endless teasing from his older sisters. He grew up in Woodbury and graduated from Woodbury High class of 1977, having made many friends along the way. After graduation he worked in several different trades, but his true love was always sports; in this he excelled. An outstanding softball player he played on several different leagues in the 1980s and had a promising future ahead of him. His friends recall his loyalty, boundless energy and determination to always do his best. Tommy was the one you always hoped would show up at your event because of his fun presence.\n\nIn 1991, at age 31, Tommy’s life was changed forever when he and his fiancée, Brenda Carlson and their 9-month-old son, Trevor were broadsided by another driver who failed to stop at an intersection. Tommy and Brenda both sustained severe head injuries and spent years in rehabilitation.\n\nWhile Tommy never regained the ability to walk or talk, he never gave up hope, never quit trying, and never lost his ability to smile. Those were traits which, despite his brain injury he continued to carry with him all his life. His courage and perseverance served as an inspiration to many and he will always remain in our hearts.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held from 1-4 PM, Sunday, June 5, 2022 at Prestwick Golf Club, 9555 Wedgewood Dr., Woodbury, Minnesota 55125. All are invited. Drinks and appetizers will be served. There will be short presentation at 2 PM.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations are preferred to his son, Trevor Thompson, The Minnesota Brain Injury Alliance, or Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute.\n\nThe family would like to thank his caregivers at REM St. Croix, the many therapists who cared for him over the years, and the many friends who held benefits for Tommy, Brenda, and Trevor."
