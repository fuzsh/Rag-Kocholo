        "text": "This page does not require a rating on Wikipedia's content assessment scale.\n\nIt is of interest to the following WikiProjects:\n\nArchive 1 Archive 2 Archive 3 Archive 4 Archive 5\n\nAlright - I've noticed as I've been editing team articles that there are a gigantic amount of different infoboxes for each article.\n\nI've seen a total of seven (so far) different types of team infoboxes, and I think it's about time we began to standardize a bit. Some of them can be broken down into categories of similarity, others stand alone, but I'm linking to the team pages which have which.\n\nThe Loose Styles:\n\nLoose Icon-Only Style\n\nPenn State Nittany Lions football\n\nLoose Icon and Title Style\n\nSan Diego State Aztecs football\n\nLoose Icon and Title with Helmet Style\n\nLSU Tigers football\n\nLoose Icon and Title with Helmet Style with Labels\n\nHawaii Warriors football\n\nThe Block Styles:\n\nBlock Style without Title\n\nMichigan Wolverines football\n\nBlock Style including financial info without Title\n\nOhio State Buckeyes football\n\nThe Stand-Alone Block:\n\nDifferent Block Style with Title\n\nIowa Hawkeyes football\n\nSome of these are radically different than others - from looking around, the majority seem to be with the 'block style', though many football articles still lack one. I ask that we reach a consensus before we add more infoboxes for us to change in the near future. Which should it be? --NomaderTalk\n\nThanks for bringing this up, this is exactly what the project is for. I like the Michigan one the best. I think financial info shouldn't be on there, or if it is, at the bottom. Ohio State's was WAY too long too. I think Michigan's should be the base and we can add a bunch of info/fields from there. --MECU≈talk\n\nI havent had a chance to go through all of them closely yet but I must say I do like the Michigan one but I really dislike the grid lines inside of the template. Thats my personal preference.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI agree with you in that Michigan's is the bestat the current moment in time and with the fact that the grid is ugly. Perhaps we should make a fusion of Michigan's good information and Penn State's rather classy looking infobox? I like Penn State's, but the lack of a title and some information is a big downside. --NomaderTalk\n\nI agree with Nomader that the Michigan and Penn State's should be combined. Just my two cents. If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nAgree with the above that we should combine the two. We need a standard order of presenting the information as well, i.e. do rivals go before or after stadium in the infobox? It would be nice if we could transform this into a template where we can just do something like rivals=Oregon Ducks|Stadium=Reser Stadium etc. etc. VegaDark\n\n(reset) I fully plan to make a template, once we get some agreement on what needs to be in it. I'll probably do it next week sometime unless someone beats me to it. --MECU≈talk\n\nI really don't care for the Michigan box, but I think it's mostly the lines that cause that. I really like the look of the Penn State one, though. I figure we'll need team logo, name, coach, home stadium (seating capacity), colors, mascot, nickname, fight song name, conference championships, national championships, number of all-americans (maybe), over-all record (with maybe breakdowns by era too), maybe athletic director. I'll keep thinking, but I bet that would cover most of the info we want.z4ns4tsu\\talk\n\nPersonally, I don't like the 'look' of the Michigan one either, but it has most of the information we'd need in the infobox - yet, the Penn State one just looks classy. One big thing I do like though about the Penn State infobox is that it lists the championship years on it, instead of having large annoying lists in the pages. If we could somehow incorporate that into what Michigan has now, I think we'd have a good infobox. --NomaderTalk\n\nSo I think we've agreed we want the content of the Michigan box with the appearance and layout of the Penn State box.--NMajdan•talk\n\nWith a title thrown in there as well - the one main problem other than info on the Penn State box. Other than that, I think that's the consensus. --NomaderTalk\n\nHope you haven't started on one Mecu cause I threw one together today. Was a slow day at work. I'm currently debugging an issue with the school colors but other than that, I think I got it. Let me know what you think and if there's anything that should be added/subtracted. {{NCAAFootballSchool}}--NMajdan•talk\n\nNo I haven't. Looks good. Some suggestions: Center the Italicized headers? Or push them out a little more? Also, maybe add a Conference Record under Team Records? Perhaps Conference Titles shouldn't just be a number, since then you could specify what conference(s) it was? ie, 2 Big 12, 5 Big 8, etc? Also, maybe a field for starting year of football? Or number of years (less useful). But really, it does look good. I've see the same color problem on other templates too. --MECU≈talk\n\nThanks for the comments Mecu. I moved the italicized headers over a little more. I can still move it more or just center it. I think conference titles should be a number because win I visit more athletic sites, thats how they list it. But technically, anything can go there. Its not like that field invalidates any number or has some isnumber() function attached to it. I will add the starting year for football as well. Also, I moved your comment to the template talk page as well so we can switch this conversation to the proper place.--NMajdan•talk\n\nIs the Texas Bowl in any way, shape or form connected to the EV1.net Houston Bowl? If they aren't, I assume we should split the Texas Bowl article. Or, do we keep Houston Bowl results in the Texas Bowl article. Your responses will help resolve a dispute on if previous results from the Houston Bowl should or should not be kept in the article. Thanks If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nWhile going through some of the yearly team pages, I noticed the 2007 Oregon State Beavers football team article has already been created when there is still over a month left in this football season. I worry that if we start creating these articles too early, we may have more people questioning the need for these articles than we already do. Even the 2006 Texas Longhorn football team article was questioned for being created in early June 2006 and they were defending national champs. Personally, I think at the very earliest, the creation of these articles should wait until at least National Signing Day when a mostly full roster for that year's team has been determined.--NMajdan•talk\n\nAgreed. If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nPersonally, I see no reason to have most team pages, unless the team is stellar, was ranked in the top twenty-five for more than a few weeks, or has another reason to be there (see the 2006 Miami RedHawks team). Obviously, the Miami team I cited is none of these, and doesn't even have a winning record, yet already has an article. Change is needed... bad. --NomaderTalk\n\nLike I mentioned above, this WikiProject needs to have a manual of style to have a clear-cut set of guidelines for notability in relation to teams, bowls, players, etc. If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nPerhaps we should say it is discouraged to create the next season prior to the spring practice game, or at least national signing day. But, since the 2007 Oregon page is already created, then we should allow it. It contains stuff that we would have to re-create anyways... it's just that we wouldn't want it already. But, per discussion before, any DI-A team season page is acceptable, as long as it's well sourced and written, regardless of how they perform. --MECU≈talk\n\nI agree it's a bit early to be making the 2007 season articles. But, since it's already made, along with 2007 Washington State Cougars football team (which was made back in October) no point to try and get them deleted since the information is accurate and will just end up being recreated in a few months. We should, however, discourage making these until at least national signing day as said above, or there won't be much to say other than the game schedule. VegaDark\n\nI support the creation of any well written team article as soon as the old season has ended.\n\nImmediately after the season, there is already information to report, such as the upcoming schedule. Some things can already be written ahead of time, such as how many times the two teams have faced, and what the series record is. Recruiting information follows soon after that. Sometimes there are coaching changes to report, or new contract extensions to keep coaches from leaving, or stadium expansions, or new video systems installed, etc. etc.\n\nI feel we have been over this ground already and decided that well-written articles should stay. I see no reason to revist that decision so soon.\n\nReaders will be interested in information about next year as soon as this year is over, maybe sooner. For that reason, informative articles about next year should be allowed to stay even if they are created this year. I think it would be wrong to say that Wikipedia should wait until later to be a resource for this informaiton. Johntex\\talk\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, considering that Category:Future sporting events has some way out there events like the 2032 Summer Olympics and 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament, ok ... but I really think we should worry more about some of the important 2006 teams that don't have pages ... like Wake Forest, for example. BigDT\n\nI'm trying to start using the pages of the form Name Nickname football. But because they're fairly new, most links for all kinds of stuff -- college teams' opponents, NFL players' alma maters, etc. -- have links to the school instead of the football program. I change these manually here and there, but I think it would be good to have a bot to do this systematically. If I get a chance I might write something but if someone else wants to do it, more power to them. - PhilipR\n\nHow will you differentiate between the two? For instance, if I said \"NFL Pro John Doe graduated from the University of XYZ,\" I believe it should go to the school's wiki article. If I said \"NFL Pro John Doe played for the University of XYZ,\" then it should go to the football page. But a bot wouldn't be able to make that decision. Also, what if there is no 'Name Nickname football' article? By guidelines set by the CFB WikiProject, you first try to link to the year-team page, if available and applicable (2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team), then the 'Name Nickname football' article (Oklahoma Sooners football), then school athletics article (Oklahoma Sooners), then school article (University of Oklahoma). --NMajdan•talk\n\nYep. Before this would work we would need to make an article about the football teams for each school. There are many schools that still don't even have articles about their athletics, let alone their football team. But I agree that it would be nice, in the long run, to link to either the football season or the football team articles in many cases. VegaDark\n\nSee above section \"Bowl Games\" for more opinions on this subject (my opinion is listed there also). If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nThere is a straw poll being conducted here to come to a consensus on what the format of the season schedule chart should look like, please add your input. VegaDark\n\nAn unregister user keeps changing Tennessee's national championships to 6, which is in correct. Is there anything that can be done about this? Dlong\n\nI'll block unregistered users from editting it temporarily. Hopefully they will quickly lose interest. Johntex\\talk\n\nHaha, just gotta be aware and keep track of the article's history. College football articles (especially schools) are prime targets for vandalism.--NMajdan•talk\n\nIt's not clear-cut vandalism, as the user is claiming that some extremely minor polls, which voted Tennessee #1 in these years, count as national championships. See http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/ia_football_past_champs.html. However, the additions are pretty stupid; anyone want to claim Florida State won the national championship in 1994? (not PSU or Nebraska). So, if I could do a favor and ask some of you guys to watchlist it, as the guy will likely return after the sprotect is expired. -Patstuart(talk)(contribs)\n\nI agree it is not clear-cut vandalism. So I did not block the user or warn the user about vandalism. My intention would be to leave the sprotect in place for about a week. In that amount of time, the editor will hopefully either (a) lose interest completely (b) realize they have to discuss and gain conensus instead of just reverting (c) at least register a user account which will make enforcement of WP:3RR somewhat easier. Johntex\\talk\n\nThis probably isn't or won't be the only instance this will occur. Schools probably claim a different number than the NCAA recognizes plenty of times. Perhaps the best way to deal with it is to include both ideas (aka, NPOV). Something like: \"The NCAA officially recognizes Tennessee with 4 national championships in 19xx, 19xx, 19xx and 19xx. However, Tennessee claims 6 with the additional years of 19xx and 19xx. In 19xx, the yyyyyyy poll and in 19xx the zzzzzzz poll voted Tennessee the national champion. These polls are not commonly referred or claimed and the general consensus is that Tennessee has just 4 national championships.\" I know, literary works of art. (copied to Talk:Tennessee Volunteers football) --MECU≈talk\n\nI like this general idea, but I have two concerns: (1) I don't think the NCAA officially recognizes ANY football championships. They may list them, and refer to them, but I don't think they really recognize or sanction them. (2) for the purposes of team infoboxes and tables listing multiple teams, I think the WikiProject College Football should adopt and stick with a standard of which polls we will use. Beyond that, I think it is fine to include prose in each team article that explains discrepencies and counter-claims (with sources of course). (copied to Talk:Tennessee Volunteers football) Johntex\\talk\n\nAs much as I like the idea that the WP:CFB determine what is valid, it's not our job: that would be original. We can just reference the NCAA and then the University and put it all out there. For us to decide that we'll only go along with the NCAA I think is to ignore a side to the story. We could certainly say that in the infobox, only the generally recognized (aka common, NCAA published) NCs should be listed and others claimed by the school should be talked about in the article. But to say we will only put out what the NCAA publishes isn't being very NPOV, I think. (text not copied) --MECU≈talk\n\nI think that you may have misunderstood me and I think that we may actually be in agreement. I am saying that for the purposes of infoboxes and combined tables where lots of teams are listing, that we can stick with one or more of the most generally recognized polls. We have to make some sort of determination about what to include there. That is not NPOV, it is a reflection of the reality of the situation that some polls enjoy more wide-spread acceptance than others. In the text of an article on an individual team, we should be able to go into any amount of detail and discuss any polls that some author feels is relevant to discuss. Johntex\\talk\n\nIt does sound like we agree. I'm on board with that then. --MECU≈talk\n\nCool. I'm sure, if we have to, we can find sources that stipulate that some poll are more recognized than others. It shouldn't be too hard. -Patstuarttalk|edits\n\nI requested semi-protection of the Bowl Championship Series page and it was granted. I think it should stay until at least a week after the National Championship game on January 8, 2007. If the vandals find their way to other pages and it becomes too much, you can request semi-protection as well at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection. There should be several IPs and have occurred frequently over the recent period. --MECU≈talk\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Wilhoit they are going after this article. Some people still don't get it.CJC47\n\nWill you guys just take a look at this? Let me know if you disagree with my opinion. CJC47\n\nJust stumbled across an article that appears to have been created about a month ago: List of Current NCAA Division 1-A Coaches. Could use a little help filling in the gaps. It is also an orphaned article so could face deletion in the future.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI moved it to List of current NCAA Division I-A coaches. I think this is a good time to plug the Master Team Table. --MECU≈talk\n\nMoved to List of current NCAA Division I-A football coaches for accuracy before any more links get created. AUTiger ʃ talk/work\n\nDoes anyone think it might be a good idea to have a by year version of this article? Taking it a step further, we could even have something like List of NCAA Division I-A teams, 2006 could have team/coach/bowl/record/conference. That's probably something useful to have for each year, if for nothing else, than as a central point of reference for articles. BigDT\n\nI can pretty much buy that; sounds like a useful reference. But I think it's almost a subsection (except for the size issue) of 2006 NCAA Division I-A football season so perhaps it's 2006 NCAA Division I-A football season results? Section it by conference with each table containing team/coach/record/notes(includes championship games, bowl, anything notable to highlight.) AUTiger ʃ talk/work\n\nShould we do awards for the best 2006 team page? Best additions by posters and the like? CJC47\n\nHonestly, I'm not big on that stuff. If you think someone has done a good job, give them a barnstar, but beyond that, I really think we've done a good job of keeping the team rivalries out of here and it would be nice to see it stay that way. BigDT\n\nFollowing the naming convention used for 2006 Rose Bowl I have created stubs for two of the upcoming bowl games: 2006 Alamo Bowl and 2007 Rose Bowl. I would love to see us have an informative article for every single bowl game, but that may not happen. Therefore, I am not going to systematically create a stub for every game. I created these two because I personally plan to contribute to them.\n\nWe already have a page for BCS National Championship Game 2006. (Note that the naming convention we used there is different from other bowl games, where we have previously put the year after the title.)\n\nOur project is active enough and has enough members that I think we should certainly create 2007 Fiesta Bowl, 2007 Sugar Bowl, and 2007 Orange Bowl so I will go ahead and create stubs for these. Beyond that, I think the creation of bowl game articles should be dependent upon whether someone is willing to take the initiative and make a good article. Johntex\\talk\n\nWell you know z4ns4tsu and I will be on the Fiesta Bowl article.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI just created the above-mentioned BCS bowl articles. Someone please double-check me. In the copy-and-pasting, I don't want to have Louisville playing in more than one bowl! Also, I'm not sure which team is home and which is away for all these. So, I added an invisible comment that we need to check on that for each one. Johntex\\talk\n\nI think we might want to create a template for head-to-head games. I notice that in addition to a couple of past bowl games, there are a few individual college football games in Category:notable college football games. A head-to-head template could be used for games like these, as well as bowl games. Some things it might include:\n\n|Name=(name or nickname if any - E.g. 2007 Rose Bowl or \"The Play\" |Date= |Visiting Team= |Visiting Record= |Visiting Team AP rank= |Visiting Team Coaches rank= |Visiting Team BCS rank= |Visiting Coach= |Home Team= |Home Record= |Home Team AP rank= |Home Team Coaches rank= |Home Team BCS rank= |Home Coach= |Type=(conference, non-conference, conference championship, bowl game, national championship...) |Stadium= |Result=\n\nWhat do you think? Johntex\\talk\n\nI like it, but am not totally sure how it should look. I don't think it should look like the standard infoboxes, something more prominent centered at the top. I also think it should use\n\n{{Linescore Amfootball| |Home= |R1= ||R2= ||R3= ||R4= ||RT= |Road= |H1= ||H2= ||H3= ||H4= ||HT= }}\n\nand maybe even some stat columns? See [1] for an example (oh to use logos! but no, won't use them here, sigh) Perhaps there should be a box-score summary template as well? --MECU≈talk\n\n(Sigh) someday hopefully we will be cleared to use logos in the way that other major media sources use them. I do kind of like the idea of having the linescore immediately at the top. The box score might be better further down the page? Other info I've thought of to consider for the info box is Attendance and Weather. Johntex\\talk\n\nYah, I didn't mean to imply the box score at the top as well. Just thought there might be a need for it and standardizing it would be good for Wikipedia. Though it would have to involve start and end templates which I'm not yet good at, but all the more reason to go for it and learn. --MECU≈talk\n\nPlease take a look and provide some feedback: Template:NCAAFootballSingleGameHeader. My thoughts are to eliminate the white background so it's more transparent looking. I'm not so sure about the blue outline (maybe a different color? maybe involve school colors somehow?) I use a 1600x1200 monitor, and I tried reducing the size and seeing how it looks, but I'd like some input from others that use smaller sizes. Is it too big? Should I take the \"nowrap\" off of the middle column? Are the fonts just too big? Should I go smaller overall? Any comments are appreciated. Thank you. --MECU≈talk\n\nI have moved the template so it can begin being used on pages: {{NCAAFootballSingleGameHeader}}. --MECU≈talk\n\nSoccer pages have a nifty little template Template:Nft that lets you easily specify the name of the country and produce a link to such-and-such national football team. It requires a redir for countries like the US and Australia that don't have that as the name of the article, and I think transcluding it is highly deprecated, but other than that it seems to work great. I created similar at Template:Cfb. Sadly everything will require a redir because there's no way to intuit the school nickname which is in each article's title. If there are any nuances of MediaWiki template markup that I'm missing, please advise me. Cheers, PhilipR\n\nI decided we were better off with {{cfb2}}, which lets you specify the team nickname to avoid redirs. And be sure to use them with subst: so that we don't create a mess of transclusion. - PhilipR\n\nCan someone knowledgable about it give Heisman Trophy a once over? It has been vandalized quite a bit with partial reverts mixed in. I just want to make sure that I haven't missed anything and that there aren't any little pieces of mis-information vandalism. BigDT\n\nIt looks good to me. I do take a slight issue with the third paragraph. I don't know if the trophy serves as a representation of a player's chances in the NFL. Look at some of the more recent winners: Jason White, Eric Crouch, Chris Weinke, Danny Weurffel. Granted there are some big names but the number of big NFL players and NFL busts are about equal. Just my opinion. But overall the article looks good.--NMajdan•talk\n\nFrom here on, if anyone comes across an AFD regarding a college football project related item, please list it here on the Project talk page so that the members of the project can assist in assessment of the article. Thank you. --MECU≈talk\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Wilhoit they are going after this article. Some people still don't get it.CJC47\n\nWill you guys just take a look at this? Let me know if you disagree with my opinion. CJC47\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kory Sheets of Kory Sheets. Borderline IMHO, but still keep as starting RB for Division I team. --MECU≈talk\n\nI'm not sure about this one: John Fitzgerald (Offensive Guard, NCAA All-American). Is it worth keeping or should we AFD it? --MECU≈talk\n\nIffy ... leaning delete. If it is kept, it needs to be renamed and cleaned up. I take a dim view of autobiographical articles. Also, the article says that he was on the all-centry team for the entire state of Oklahoma (meaning, including OU and OSU). But the link says it was UCO's all-century team, not for the whole state. BigDT\n\nJust came across this new community on Wikipedia. May be worth checking out in case we need something in the future. Graphic Lab.--NMajdan•talk\n\nThanks for the addition. I had a photo that I have wanted fixed for quite a while. CJC47\n\nI need advice from the more experienced editors: I think everyone, outside of a few seemingly tireless, fringe (not normal) LSU fans, have moved past the 2003 split-title fiasco, but the edits keep on coming. For the past year they've been the occasional anon IPs, now I have two new users abusing this over and over for the past few days on University of Southern California Trojans football, 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season, NCAA Division I-A national football championship, and USC Trojans (thank heavens for the \"user contribution\" button!). What should I do? With these new accounts it's seems to have become a little different than when it was merely anons, but I feel a little uncomfortable handing out warnings since I'm self-professed USC alum and \"Watchlist Guardian\" for many of its articles. --Bobak\n\nTalking is usually the best thing. Try to get all involved people to talk in one location. Try to make a compromise that everyone (or most) can agree on. Is their viewpoint that LSU isn't a co-NC? I couldn't really tell what the problem was easily. Involving some of the dispute resolution processes may be needed if you can't talk it out. --MECU≈talk\n\nI wouldn't call myself an \"experienced\" editor (I generally just fix typos, bad links, and revert vandalism), but I'm intending to treat this as vandalism and give the standard warnings. I've already notified one user about this. Dlong\n\nSeeing some of the AFDs for college players, I'd like to get some discussion going about Notability for College football People, and eventually get this as a guideline or policy under the Notability. Thus, here are my thoughts:\n\nCoaches\n\nHead coach\n\nOf a Division I-A team for any length of time (1 game, 1 day) (must be officially recognized by school as head coach. For example, .\n\nOf a lower division, if they win the national championship.\n\nAny division, won a major national award (Coach of the Year), or in the College Football Hall of Fame\n\nAssistant coach\n\nOf a Division I-A team, an offensive or defensive coordinator (or similar title that means they are a \"head\" assistant, not simply \"running backs coach\") for a minimum of 5 years at one school/team\n\nOf any division, won a major national award (Top Assistant Coach)\n\nPlayers\n\nDivision I-A\n\nWon a major national award (See {{College Football Awards}}), or in the College Football Hall of Fame\n\nHolds a current NCAA record\n\nA team leader (ie, quarterback, defensive leader) (aka, Standout player)\n\nAll-Americans by at least two sources\n\nFinalists for major awards (Heisman watch list)\n\nConsidered a NFL draft prospect for the next draft cycle\n\nLower divisions\n\nNational news item about player (non criminal)\n\nRecruits\n\nTop 5 ranked Nationally overall (Not top 5 in position) by at least one source\n\nSpecifically not\n\nHigh school players\n\nNo national sources discussing player\n\nPlayers not likely to need an article (most linemen fit in this category, except award winners per above) because information is lacking to fully support more than the basic information that is possible to be obtains on season/team articles. Need more than date of birth, name, height, weight, high school and a basic stats (\"In 2006 he had 7 sacks\"). An article should contain enough content that including it into a team/season article (or anywhere else) would not be appropriate.\n\nI by no means imply that my listing above is perfect. Your help is appreciated. --MECU≈talk\n\nHead coaches: Any coach, any team, any conference, in college sports. This includes NCAA Division I-A, I-AA, II, II, and NAIA. I feel being a college coach, regardless of the college, is worthy enough of an article.\n\nAssistant coaches: You say minimum of 5 years. Does that mean they've served in the capacity of OC/DC for five years or that they've been a coach for five years and are now OC/DC? For instance, let me use Oklahoma since that is what I know best. Brent Venables has been DC for 8 years...worthy of an article. Kevin Wilson is in his first year as OC but has been an assistant coach for nearly 10 years...worthy? And of course, an assistant coach may have an article if they are significant for another reason. Once again using Oklahoma as an example. Josh Heupel was the qb for the national championship team and is now a quarterback coach but he has an article. I say he is notable. Same for Major Applewhite.\n\nPlayers: I agree with all your criteria except for Recruits. I do not feel these high school players are deserving yet. Especially considering they will probably be redshirted their first year and won't even play in their first season thereby leaving an article without any updates for a year. Lets wait for these recruits to meet the other criteria first (All American, team leader, etc).--NMajdan•talk\n\nI think some recruits merit articles if there is a lot of hub-bub over their recruitment. Jimmy Clausen is one that I can think of. There have been articles in USA Today and Sports Illustrated CJC47\n\nYeah, I know of him. Still, I think an article should wait until, say, he is actually playing and making an impact. There's not point in creating an article for someone like Clausen if they sit on the bench the first year. If they come out their true freshman year and make a significant impact on the team (like Adrian Peterson did his true freshman year, then the article should be created. If he's a big-name recruit then he should make an impact immediately and then they'd be notable enough for an article.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI don't think Division II, II or NAIA head coaches are noteworthy. But if enough disagree with me I would be fine with it. I just don't see them as having enough possible information for an article and they are mostly local. Even I-AA is questionable, but I'd be more fine with including them.\n\n5 years at one school, where they were also the OC/DC at one point. For your Kevin Wilson example: Yes, if he has been at Oklahoma for 5+ years (you said he was a asst coach for nearly 10 years, but if those weren't at OK, then no). I should perhaps have the disclaimer that if someone is currently an assist coach (for example), but they qualify for notability under being a former player (or former head coach, for example) then their current status does not affect it. They have achieved notability.\n\nI think guys like Willie Martinez at Georgia could merit an article if they are in the news a lot and replacing a high profile guy like Brian VanGorder. Thoughts? CJC47\n\nRecruits, I originally had top 10 at position and then top 10 overall and now put top 5 overall. This is for the Jimmy Clausen types. These guys may redshirt, but typically they will be a top standout at their school eventually so having an article stagnant for a few years I'm fine with. Plus, I believe it is especially notable to be one of the top 5 ranked players out of all the thousands and thousands of high school football players each year. --MECU≈talk\n\nI believe lower division coach if they are fine. I don’t think there should be an article for everyone but if they won a national title, member of the Hall of Fame or President of the American Football Coaches Association they should have an article. They could also have an article if they do some exceptional like a very high number of victories. 09er\n\nEveryone here may want to read something I wrote about this a while ago, located here. That being said, I have to agree with much of the originally proposed list so far. For All-Americans I would change \"by more than one source\" to simply school-recognized All-Americans. That eliminates people who are only AA's on lower tiered lists. For \"Holds a current NCAA record\", what happens when someone breaks it? Do we put it to AfD since they no longer hold it? I don't think this should be an automatic criteria for inclusion because of that reason. I would guess most people who hold NCAA records were All-Americans, so they would fall into that inclusion criteria. For those who weren't AA's, perhaps allow articles on them on a case-by-case basis. I disagree with allowing articles on a \"Team leader\". Who is the team leader for Duke or Temple? Odds are they are not notable enough for an article. Perhaps allow team leader articles for teams that reached the top 25 during the season. Not sure about finalists for major awards. Once again, someone here will probably be an AA. If they weren't and didn't win the award, I'm not so sure they deserve an article. I would limit \"considered a prospect for the next NFL draft\" to a first round prospect. There are tons of players who get drafted and end up never playing in a game in the later rounds. I also think All-Conference should not be enough for an article to be made. VegaDark\n\nMy thoughts: if the person is the subject of multiple non-trivial works (per WP:BIO), I say make an article on them. If there is enough information out there for an article, I don't really think we need too much rule creep. That said, I don't really like having recruits at all unless they are notable purely on the basis of what they did in HS (ie, setting a national record, committing multiple felonies during a recruiting trip to UF, etc). Too many all-everything kids out of HS never play a down in college and four years later, they are at a local community college and nobody remembers who they were. I draw the line at being the subject of non-trivial published works. If all you have is his stat sheet and school bio, we probably don't need an article ... but if there's enough information out there with which to create an article, I say go for it. BigDT\n\nI've got to go with BigDT here. WP:BIO has pretty good standards already. Maybe, in stead of considering this a list of criteria for notability, consider it a list of people who may need articles created. If you know that XX player from YY school was a standout this year and is really being hyped in the draft or won a national award but doesn't have an article, they need one. Also, I'm not sure that having set rules for notability is really helpful. A lot of people that fit the literal definition of notability don't pass what I call the \"gut test\" for notability. That is, if you are thinking about creating an article for a person and you feel in your gut that they might not be notable enough, even if they fit the minimum requirements, maybe we don't really need that article and your time would be spent better somewhere else. That said, I can't think of a lot of lower-division coaches that need articles and I would probably have voted delete on an article for AD before his freshman season (had I been involved with WP then), even though he was the number one recruit nationally in 2004. z4ns4tsu\\talk\n\nI tend to agree with DT and Z4 here. Although it changes all the time, the WP:BIO policy currently seems pretty good. I don't see any need to try to define more specific criteria at this time. I might feel differently later if WP:BIO changes. Currently, as I read it, it allows creation of articles on college players if there is enough stuff written about them to make an article, and precludes an article if there isn't enough stuff written about them. I don't think we need added rules about their stats or what conference they played in, or anything else. Johntex\\talk\n\nWas there ever any criteria set for someone/thing to be part of the WP:CFB? I find article where the guy is a NFL player, which 99% of the time means he was a CFB player. But should he be in the WP:CFB? Same for some coaches that were assistant coaches somewhere in CFB but are now NFL coaches. If someone is in the NFL project, should they probably not be in the CFB project? There will be exceptions, like if JoePa went to the NFL, but generally. Any advice please. --MECU≈talk\n\nMy view is almost the exact opposite. If they played football in college, and we have an article about them, then they should be part of WP:CFB. Part of their article needs to be about their college career and we should step up to trying to improve at least that section of those articles. The fact that they moved on to other things (be it the NFL, or a careeer in real estate) does not change the fact that college football was a part of their lives and they were a part of college football. Johntex\\talk\n\nTemplate:USFBullsCoach is up for deletion. I do see their point since there has only been one coach, but one of the stated goals of the project page was to have a coaches template for every team. Someone even made a chart. I believe there are three templates that only have one coach South Florida, FIU and FAU. FIU will be getting a new coach soon. Since I did a lot of work to get one for every 1A team (I made 40 to 50 of them), I would like to keep it so please go to the Deletion page and comment one way or another so we can get this resolved.

Jones is an article that I created in accordance with the discussion at above. It seems to me that presentations of the historical records of teams is important in light of the state goal: To make Wikipedia one of the premier online resources on college football. I have followed the format of combining all seasons under a coach into one article - unfortunately, this particular coach only coached one season.

Would anyone object to making this season specific, such that it would be named \"2006 NCAA bowl games\" or something similar, where then, for each season we would have another template that would link only to the year-specific bowl games (2007 Rose Bowl, not just Rose Bowl). Then, this template could be used just to link to the generic bowl game articles (Rose Bowl). Any thoughts? --MECU≈talk\n\nAre you saying then that each of these articles would have two seemingly identical templates, one that links to the generic bowl game article and one that links to the year-specific bowl game?--NMajdan•talk\n\nI've created an infobox for college bowl games. It can be found at {{collegebowl}}. Feel free to edit and make better! I'd put all the templates into the various bowl articles, but I'm too lazy right now. I'll do them within the week if no one else does, though it'd be nice to get some help. If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nOops\n\nI made this infobox: {{Infobox CollegeFB Bowl}}, before I saw yours. An example of it can be seen at BCS National Championship Game 1998. I suggest yours for upcoming bowl and this one for past bowls. What does everyone think? CJC47\n\nSee also\n\n{{NCAAFootballSingleGameHeader}} by Mecu.\n\nIt is designed for a specific occurance of any single football game. Ie, the 2006 Alamo Bowl or 2006 Rose Bowl or any regular season game, if it has its own article. Johntex\\talk\n\nTake a look at the combo of mine and his at BCS National Championship Game 2007. There is some info overlap, but the quarter by quarter scores and rankings of his, combined with the TV info, and logo of mine make a nice combination. Thoughts?CJC47\n\nI do like them working together generally, perhaps just remove the name and stadium from the infobox would reduce the overlap of info, but each then has a unique purpose (whereas the game header shows game info, the infobox shows game detailed info (MVP)). But I do like them both and I think combining may cause either to bloat too much. Maybe make them look a little more alike? --MECU≈talk\n\nI put them in combination at 2006 Alamo Bowl and the result is not bad. The stadium and city is in both. Leaving it blank in the infobox does not look good at all, so I left it blank in the game header. I think it would be nice if the infobox could treat these as optional. Then we could put these in the header and the two would look nicer together. Johntex\\talk\n\nIan's has some extra information that I like. Specifically, I like the place to add the pay-out. However, this does need to be discussed in the text as well since a portion will go to their temas and a portion will be split among their conferences (excluding independents of course). Johntex\\talk\n\nEh, I don't know about having both of them together. They don't exactly mesh well on a 1024x768 monitor. Would it be possible to move the infobox on the right down to the Game Summary section?--NMajdan•talk\n\nYou are right - that didn't look good. I don't really like it much down the page, so I just took it out for now. Johntex\\talk\n\nYou could just add a section clear after the game header: {{-}}. --MECU≈talk\n\nCJC47's looks more appropriate for specific year bowl games (such as 2003 Fiesta Bowl), while my template is appropriate for the top-leve page (in this example, Fiesta Bowl). Would everyone agree to this and start adding {{collegebowl}} to the top-level pages? I'd like to get all of these templates on the page before the first bowl is played. If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nI'd like to see more of the parameters be made optional. It would be nice to be able to add the template without knowing all the information it requires, such as the payout or sponsors. Also, what will happen to this template as soon as the year is over? At some point at the 2006-07 season gives way to the 2007-08 season, the field called \"this year's matchup\" will become confusing. Perhaps these should become \"most recent played matchup\" and \"upcoming matchup - once confirmed\". Johntex\\talk\n\nI've got a sandbox version at User:Mecu/Collegebowl if anyone wants to try. I've got most of it optional now, but some things aren't showing up (I guess I made it too optional). And there's an extra - or so popping up. Any help is appreciated. --MECU≈talk\n\nI took Mecu's sandbox template and modified it in my userspace. I think I've got all the fields showing up now. Although I still need to test it with multiple variations of the criteria. I'm gonna take a closer look at it today and see if there are any other fields that should be added. Please look at my version of the template at: User:Nmajdan/Collegebowl.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI modified mine further. I've added fields for the previous season's matchup and the next matchup. I'd love to hear some comments as I may copy the code into the actual template soon and update any pages that are already using the template.--NMajdan•talk\n\nThe template is looking good, but I do have a suggestion. When I looked at your Rose Bowl example, I got a bit confused as I was reading through the box. You may want to order it a bit differently. Perhaps,\n\nStadium\n\nLocation\n\nPrevious Stadiums\n\nPrevious Locations\n\nYou may also want to look at how the field \"Operated\" on two points. First, the way its populated in the example makes it unclear whether the 1902 refers to the field above. Second, if it will fit, Years Played might be a better heading.\n\nFinally, as an afterthought, another possible organization scheme would be to move the Previous Stadiums/Locations to its own section toward the bottom, like Former names. If you do that, you could move the 2007 matchup to the top so that the box presents the current information first, then drops down to the historical information.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nOk, I'll take a look into some of those issues. I didn't really mess with the ordering of anything but I liked your first suggestion better about having Stadium and Location first and then Prev Stadiums and Prev Locations. As far as the 'Operated' field goes, maybe I'll remove the middle alignment on it and have it align with the top of the cell and thus the 1902; that should clarify that issue. I like the ordering because I want the more relevant information to the top level article (such as Fiesta Bowl) to be at the top of the infobox and the least relevant at the bottom. The matchups would be more relevant to the 2007 Fiesta Bowl article and thus should stay at the bottom. I'm also thinking about having the score wikilink to the bottom level article (such as 2007 Fiesta Bowl) so there is an easy link to the most recent occurrence of that bowl game.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI've made said changes and added links to the previous and next bowl year article. Let me know what you think.--NMajdan•talk\n\nLooks good to me - as far as I'm concerned, roll with it!--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nDone and done. Now time to update the pages that use the templates.--NMajdan•talk\n\nLooks great, thanks for your help! If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nSomebody brought up an issue with . I'd love some input on how to resolve. I'm worried that it would be a lot of extra coding and complicating of the infobox to satisfy a very tiny percentage of the overall numbers of articles that would use it.--NMajdan•talk\n\nMy initial thought is the same as yours - a lot of trouble for what may be a small number of cases. Plus, I suppose the argument could be made that playing careers and coaching careers, if both are noteworthy, deserve separate infoboxes.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nThe offseason is fast approaching, and with it comes the termination of the weekly updates that many of our pages require. With this \"extra time,\" I believe its time for us to stop focusing on updating pages and start focusing on improving the quality of existing articles. I propose that we establish a peer review section similar to WP:MHPR. Its time for the project to start concentrating improving its WP:GA and WP:FA numbers. If we do this, I can try to add a peer-review and old-peer-review field to the Talk page banner. This, of course, is just a first step. Feel free to discuss further improvements to the WikiProject.--NMajdan•talk\n\nAs someone quite new to the Project and fairly new to Wikipedia overall, I am wondering how this relates to the already existing Wikipedia:WikiProject College football/Assessment. In other words, if the group is actively assessing and reassessing articles as part of its mission, is a separate peer review section also needed?--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nYes. The Assessment department assessing the quality and importance of existing articles. The peer review department would review articles before nominating for GA or FA. Since you're new to Wikipedia, go view the Military History Wikiproject. It is much larger than ours and has a broader scope so implementing a lot of their features into our WP would be extreme but you can see how things are done.--NMajdan•talk\n\nThanks, now I see the relationship and agree that it probably is needed. By the way, I have very cautiously been assessing a few articles. If you run into any where I seem to be off-base, please let me know.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nDone and done.--NMajdan•talk\n\nSo I'm thinking about taking the jump and nominating Oklahoma Sooners football for WP:FA. I'd like whoever can to read the article and give me advice on what can be done to improve the article. Mostly, I'm looking for advice on how to lengthen the lead and strengthen the wording and content.--NMajdan•talk\n\nImage:OU-Logo.PNG needs a fair use rationale in order to be used on that page. There are also a decent amount of redlinks in the first few paragraphs that might hold it back from being featured. All of the All-Americans with articles should be wikilinked. VegaDark\n\nOk, easy stuff. I don't understand the issue with the image, although there's a lot about Wikipedia and fair use images I don't understand. That is the logo of the school and the sports teams. Its the logo that is on the helmet of the university. Its not like there is a separate logo for the school and the athletic teams. I may just remove those red links in the first few paragraphs until I can get around write an article for them. I'll go through and find what All Americans can be wikilinked that haven't already been in the article. Thanks for the fast input.--NMajdan•talk\n\nFor the image, the general tagging of a specific type of fair use claimed is not enough for Wikipedia. All images that are claimed as fair use must have an additional written explanation as to why they should be allowed as fair use for each individual article they are used in. See for instance every image on a featured \"list of TV episodes\" list, like Image:208 cartman flailing.gif. That's actually probably a little less detailed than some of the better fair use claims I have seen, you might be able to find a better example going through the featured articles and seeing if you can find a fair use image. Images uploaded after May 4th, 2006 are actually speedy deletable if tagged with {{nrd}} and fair use rationales haven't been added for 7 days. It is an aspect of Wikipedia that a lot of people don't know very clearly, but is imperative if you want to get an article to featured status. VegaDark\n\nI was going through the fair use images and, of course, most of them don't state their FUC. However, I went to University of Michigan (an FA) and the logo on that page (:Image:Umichigan color seal.gif and :Image:Michigan BlockM.jpg) does not have any criteria either. Same thing for Michigan State University.--NMajdan•talk\n\nHmm, I'm assuming those became featured a while ago before this became a standard. You are free to not add one until/unless someone comments about it on your FA nomination. VegaDark\n\nI think there should be more pictures. It gets a little too wordy in the bulk of the article, and there should be plenty (cough) of free images, or at least fair use images you can use in the middle sections. Perhaps make the references two columns? Also, for the intro, are they a squad or team? there are \"many\" hall of fame players and coaches... it would be better to give an exact number as it seems wishy washy. And what does being an \"elite\" program mean? Who says that (I mean that literally, what reference?) and why are they elite? Existing for 110 years is commendable, but have they played football all those years (my guess is no) and would be more interesting to say \"The program began 110 years (or \".. in 1896\") ago and has played football for 108 seasons.\" It does get a little listy and long at the end, so perhaps using two columns would make it better and shorter too. Maybe some navigational templates or \"see alsos\" would help at the end too. Good luck. --MECU≈talk\n\nAll great advice Mecu. I'll make some changes. As far as images go...no, I don't know where to get free images that pertain to those eras. I don't want to just throw in random images of the university in a football article and I don't know where to get free images of Switzer or Wilkinson or anybody else. I've got a couple images from before 1923 and I've got images that people have taken and given permission. That is it. And yes, the program started in 1895 and has played at least one game every season since. I'm using all the navigational templates that I know of that are relevant. I removed several 'See Also's earlier because they were now wikilinked in the new infobox. I do need to get rid of the 'squad' word but I don't like 'team' either. Those words convey a single instance of the team and I'm trying to convey the whole history of the program. I'm already using program at the end of the sentence. I may have to reword that whole sentence.--NMajdan•talk\n\nOk, I took step one and altered the lead. I still need to work on lengthening it. I'm using New England Patriots as sort of a guide as its the only football team specific article that is Featured.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI like the intro much better. I think you should give the number in the HOF. You could go count the number on the lists that Wikipedia has. But I like it overall much better. --MECU≈talk\n\nSince the intro will get the first bit of focus, I just made a few minor edits to it that I hope you think are OK. However, with respect to the sentence The program began in 1895 and is considered the best program of the modern era (post World War II), you may want to say something like The program began in 1895 and is perceived to be one of the best programs of the modern era (post World War II). The reason for my proposed change is that your current sentence is likely to draw negative attention from fans of other programs and perhaps viewed as violating NPOV (even if the statement is 100% accurate). Plus, I'm not sure the source cited is either NPOV or unequivocal. Another suggestion I have is to add dates to the era's to help the non-Sooner reader, i.e., Pre-Owen era (1895-1905) and so on.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nOk, made some more changes to the lead. I removed the sentence you mentioned and instead mentioned verifiable numbers. Also added the years to the section headers as you suggested.--NMajdan•talk\n\nArticle is now up for a broader peer review here.--NMajdan•talk\n\nHmmm.... no comments yet. If I don't get any comments by noon, I'll probably remove it from peer review and go ahead and nominate it for FA. I feel I'll have more time to edit it today and tomorrow and maybe next week than if I waited a few weeks.--NMajdan•talk\n\nI contacted OU's Western History Collection about using photos and they charge a $50 use fee. HA! Don't need images that bad.--NMajdan•talk\n\nOn the theory that the fewer red links you have in your article, the better, I went after the first one I saw. I have just started a stub article on Lewie Hardage. You may want to clean it up a bit. --Tlmclain | Talk\n\nI'm only hitting Wikipedia lightly today, but I have 3 small comments on your article. 1. Note #2 is broken. 2. Somewhere in the text is a contraction - I think its couldn't which should be could not. 3. In the section where you talk about the beginning of Bedlam you may want to add a little more text so that the reader unfamiliar with OU football will not have to click the link to figure out that Bedlam is a reference to the Bedlam Series between OU and OSU. --Tlmclain | Talk\n\nThank you. I made fixed those issues.--NMajdan•talk\n\nArticle nominated for FA\n\nI got impatient at the lack of responses on the peer review. I feel I'd have more time today and tomorrow to make whatever changes the FA reviewers will request so I have nominated this article for FA. Please follow the progress here.--NMajdan•talk\n\nNot looking good.--NMajdan•talk\n\nNo, but we are learning a lot. Thanks for trying.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nI agree that we are learning a lot. I have to admit that some of the comments and objections on there really don't make sense to me, especially the one about the mother in Africa, but I think that most of them are going to lead us to a lot better of an article. My main concern is that we won't be able to satisfy some of their concerns about NPOV and POV because the article must have a positive slant when the history is mostly positive. Anywho, I added my two cents to the discussion without voting since I'm not really a neutral editor. z4ns4tsu\\talk\n\n...add our templates/infoboxes to the list at Wikipedia:Infobox templates#Sports. I've already added {{collegebowl}}, and I'm sure the rest of our templates should or could be added to the list. Merry Christmas! If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka\n\nThat's a good idea. Didn't know about that page. I added {{College coach infobox}} and I'll try to add more later if somebody doesn't beat me.--NMajdan•talk\n\nWould anyone object to my setting up auto-archiving of this talk page? What would be an appropriate time? 30 days? --MECU≈talk\n\nCan you explain to me how the auto-archiving works? Yes, this talk page needs to be archived but how does the bot determine what to archive? Will it archive everything every 30 days, including ongoing discussions or can the bot see which sections haven't had an active post in x number of days? I don't think that sections that have had a comment within the past 14 days should be archived.--NMajdan•talk\n\nGood questions. I was planning on using Werdnabot and you can learn more about it at User:Werdnabot/Archiver/Howto. If it was set for \"30\" days (for example) only sections that hadn't had a comment in the past 30 days would be archived. The bot would come through once a day and check. It gets the \"unused\"-ness by reading the dates that people sign with using the auto-sig feature. I would put to archive into YearMonth form so everything archived in December 2006 would go into /archive/December2006archive, for example. I'd be fine with 14 days too. --MECU≈talk\n\nHmm, ok. I think I'd be ok with a bot archiving discussions without a comment for the past 14-21 days.--NMajdan•talk\n\nThe timeframe may need to be at least 30 days. In what has been a very active discussion (Proposed new minimum guideline for individual team seasons), there was a break in the from 25 October 2006 to 8 December 2006.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nMaybe we could add a \"highlights\" section that is self-maintained (the bot wouldn't do this) at the top of this talk page. If an items gets archived and someone thinks it should be \"highlighted\" then they put a link in there to it. Someone with more questions (as was the case there) could ask the new question here and refer to the archived discussion, unless they believed the archived disuccsion needed revival, but then they should post here they are starting it up again on the archive page, or is that even appropriate? The proposed new minimum... should definately go on the highlights box; items like that. --MECU≈talk\n\nI've set the page up to auto archive and set it to 30 days. Once an item is archived, probably tomorrow, we can setup the \"highlights\" section. If anyone knows a template or table setup I can use/copy, I'd appreciate a link. --MECU≈talk\n\nHello, all. It was initially my hope to try to have this done as part of Esperanza's proposal for an appreciation week to end on Wikipedia Day, January 15. However, several people have once again proposed the entirety of Esperanza for deletion, so that might not work. It was the intention of the Appreciation Week proposal to set aside a given time when the various individuals who have made significant, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia would be recognized and honored. I believe that, with some effort, this could still be done. My proposal is to, with luck, try to organize the various WikiProjects and other entities of wikipedia to take part in a larger celebration of its contributors to take place in January, probably beginning January 15, 2007. I have created yet another new subpage for myself (a weakness of mine, I'm afraid) at User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week where I would greatly appreciate any indications from the members of this project as to whether and how they might be willing and/or able to assist in recognizing the contributions of our editors. Thank you for your attention. Badbilltucker\n\nI discovered this cool trick that making linking easier: If a link has a ( ) in it for disambig (or whatever) reasons, you can link like this: [[Blah (darn brackets)|]] and it will show up as \"Blah\" (no \"(darn brackets)\"!). For example: [[Dan Hawkins (coach)|]] looks like: Dan Hawkins. Awesome, huh? --MECU≈talk\n\nAnother thing I just discovered about this, is that when Wiki saves, it will change the link internally from [[Dan Hawkins (coach)|]] to [[Dan Hawkins (coach)|Dan Hawkins]]. So, when you edit it again, it will look like normal. So, changing them from the displayed way to the | formatted way is useless since it will just put it all back anyways. --MECU≈talk\n\nVery neat. Thanks for the tip! Johntex\\talk\n\nHmmm.....thats interesting. That may make templates easier to create, correct? Now, instead of having, say, a coach's display name and a coach's link, we would only need to ask for the link and then have all coach's links fed into that format. Since [[Dan Hawkins (coach)|]] and [[Bob Stoops|]] will both link to the correct article.--NMajdan•talk\n\nIt would seem that way NMajdan, but until I see it work, I won't put it in. And, it may be less clear for non-advanced editors like us. The extra coding for that is minimal. --MECU≈talk\n\nRelated to this is another cool trick I just discovered. Instead of linking to templates like this: {{tl|NAME}}, you link like this: {{[[Template:NAME|]]}}, and the Pipe trick will know that just NAME should be the displayed link, so when it saves it will look like {{[[Template:NAME|NAME]]}}. Why is this way better? Because it doesn't force wikipedia to make a inclusion of the {{tl}} template, so for pages like Wikipedia:WikiProject College football/MasterTeamTable where that's hundreds of times, it starts to drag on the server. While this way is better, there's nothing wrong with using the other way once in awhile, on a page that doesn't get used a lot or talk pages like this. Seems like there should be a template that does this, subst: the tl template doesn't work. --MECU≈talk\n\nIs there any sort of template to be used for display a yearly record log for coaches? I'm working on one for Joe Paterno to tidy up the one already in that article and want to make sure I'm not duplicating efforts already completed elsewhere. PSUMark2006\n\nI have seen many. Some are broken up into time at one school. Others are for entire career. Some have conference record and others don’t. It would be nice to have a standard that included the following: School, Year, Record, Conference, Conf record and place, Post season (bowl or playoffs) and Remarks 09er\n\nReally? Where?--NMajdan•talk\n\nI went ahead and created a more streamlined table format for season-by-season records at the Joe Paterno article. Anyone with more template expertise than me is more than welcome to mess around with this in the hopes of making a template out of it. PSUMark2006\n\nI like that one. The only thing I can think to add would be conference record? In a template, would have to make Ties optional since newer/new coaches you could then omit it since they will never have a tie. Would have to do it like the succession box I believe. --MECU≈talk\n\nI think it's a bit too compact. That makes sense for someone like Paterno, who's been around forever, but I prefer tables as part of the article, as in the Jim Tressel article. I think it gets more information across more clearly.\n\nI proposed at Talk:Mark Richt using that table as more of a standard, with some modifications. I got some good feedback from User:Autiger, who suggested looking at Tommy Tuberville, which I also like. With that in mind, I would like to propose using the Tuberville-style table as standard, with the following modifications:\n\nList final conference or division ranking (as in Tressel)\n\nPossibly list final poll ranking -- and if so, which ones?\n\nPossibly give bowl game column (outcome, opponent) (also in Tressel)\n\nAny thoughts? --SuperNova |T|C|\n\nI do like the Tressel version of the table - my biggest complaint about how we had it on the Paterno article was that it was too tall considering how narrow the table was. But, if we're able to populate it with more information, like conference/divisional rankings/standings, national polls, etc., then it'll be much more useful to have it within the article. I'm still a bit concerned about having it in-text for someone who's coached for decades, but as far as establishing a standard for the majority of coaches to whom this won't apply, this is a great start. I'm going to be bold and take the initiative in developing a template for this over the next couple days and report back when I have something somewhat workable. -- PSUMark2006 talk | contribs\n\nHello, I am getting ready to propose 2005 Texas Longhorn football team for consideration as a featured article. The article has had one reveiw already and I believe all issues raised there have been addressed. I have also used the semi-automated review script to look for small things that need to be changed. The article is meticulously referenced with 121 in-line sources. It contains both free-use images and appropriate fair-use images. It attempts to follow the standards set out by the relevant wiki projects.\n\nIn watching the nomintaion of the OU football program, I see that the OU article has received some objections on the grounds of supposedly being overly positive and for listing too-many awards. I have reviewed the 2006 UT article in light of those objections and I am prepared to argue that every positive thing said is relevant and attributed to a specific source. As for the awards and accomplishments, I think all the ones listed in the UT article are notable and justifiable, but I'd like to get more feedback from other editors so I invite you to review the article if you please. Johntex\\talk\n\nI have requested peer review here. Good luck to everyone still playing college football as I head into the off-season. Have a Happy New Year! Johntex\\talk\n\nMy request for a Peer Review has generated a few comments. I would welcome a lot more. Some of the comments made so far I have agreed with and already acted upon. In regard to certain other comments, I disagree with the suggestion given and I have attempted to explain my reasoning. I am hoping other people will chime in on these to help me know if my view is unique or if it is supported by others. Thanks again, Johntex\\talk\n\nI'm ready to try and put Fifth Down up for GA. I had a peer review on it a month ago and believe I covered everything quite well. I'd like some looks from some more CFB oriented folks before I try. Any comments are appreciated. Thank you. --MECU≈talk\n\nLooks good. It might be better to wiki Colorado to Colorado Buffaloes football--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nFifth Down has made it to GA as of today! Who hoo! --MECU≈talk\n\nCongrats!--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nAn issue I've encountered time-and-again with respect to infoboxes in program pages is what number to include in the national championship section. A number of pages have ludicrus national championship counts because users have used a number reflecting every single year that at least one usually obscure selector chose the program in question as \"national champion.\" Michigan's page, which claims 11 national championships when most credit the Wolverines with just 7 (and certainly no more than 9), immediately comes to mind. We need to settle on some kind of uniform standard for purposes of the infobox. Otherwise, if we allow a number to be used just because it's what the university claims, when it is a number that is not given credence in the college football world, we risk turning these pages into nothing more than pulpits for propaganda. Seeing as how Wiki has an article on Division I-A national championships that has a table of recognized national champions, I suggest we bring the program pages into conformity with the numbers in that table. Clearly some solution is needed because right now many readers coming to Wikipedia for information about a particular program are instead encountering hype from its public relations department.-PassionoftheDamon\n\nThere was some discussion about this here, above, at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football#Tennessee Volunteer Football but in there is also a link to the page where a little more discussion occured. I believe that should satisfy your questions. --MECU≈talk\n\nThanks, but I'm not sure that discussion really settles the issue, as the NCAA does not officially recognize any national champion and its listings merely list every poll or ranking that selects a national champion, including the very obscure sources we are all hoping to filter out of the infobox equation. [2] For example, if we allowed schools to claim national championships for every year they are listed in the NCAA listings, Oklahoma could claim a national championship in 2003, Florida State in 1996, Miami in 1988 and 1986, etc., even though each of those teams lost in their bowl games to the accepted national champion and no one in their right mind would consider them national champions. My point is that we need to settle on some reliable source for purposes of listing recognized national championships in the infobox. Perhaps cfbdatawarehouse.com?-PassionoftheDamon\n\nI like the idea, and looking at [this page makes it clear that LSU and USC should only be the \"recognized\" champs while Oklahoma received some \"also-rans\" votes. But we should remain impartial on this and merely selecting CFBdatawarehouse.com isn't valid. I guess it's time to find some sources as to what \"selectors\" are the major and what should be considered \"respectable\" sources for NC declarations. This page might cover it, but it's also like saying we should trust CFBdatawarehouse.com because they say to trust them (even though I do anyways). --MECU≈talk\n\n1936-present is easy. The AP poll should be for 1936-present and the Coaches from 1950-present. The question is what is a valid source for declaring national championships before 1936. Personally, I have no problem using the same sources that CFBdatawarehouse.com uses (National Championship Foundation, Helms Athletic Foundation, and College Football Researchers Association [3]).--NMajdan•talk\n\nI like the idea of using NCF, Helms, and CFRA as the sources for pre-1936 championships listed in the infobox and tables in program articles. References to other claimed/non-widely recognized \"championships\" could still be made in the body of the article, but the problem of misleading/using the infobox and tables as advertising tools would be solved. If the number listed is simply allowed to be the number claimed by the school, we are effectively allowing the schools to violate WP:COI policies.-PassionoftheDamon\n\nI think it would be good to come to a consensus for the project on how to handle this situation. If we can reference a consensus decision for the project it should hopefully resolve content disputes similar to the one occurring on the Michigan Wolverines football page. I believe User talk:PassionoftheDamon has started this discussion as the next step in resolving a content dispute.\n\nI will contribute to the discussion that I also believe that the school info boxes should conform to the criteria cited on the NCAA Division I-A national football championship page to avoid breaking the WP:COI guideline. Terryfoster\n\nHere's another thought: we could modify the infobox to specify wire national championships, so only AP and Coaches national championships would count for purposes of the infobox and article tables. Then, within the body of the article, references could be made to claimed pre-1936 national championships. I think this would promote uniformity and reliability across infoboxes, mostly resolve WP:COI concerns, and allow us to remain impartial as to weighing the sources. The way I see it, the current proposals are to (1) use the sources CFDB uses to count national championships, or (2) count only AP and Coaches national championships in the infobox. Thoughts, guys?-PassionoftheDamon\n\nI have no problem with that.--NMajdan•talk\n\nAs no one has voiced any opposition, I've gone ahead and altered the template to specify wire national championships in the national championship field. If anyone objects, please do let it be known.-PassionoftheDamon\n\nI just noticed this interesting (and commendable) idea was being put into force (first time I've paid attention). As you all know, this is semi-problematic because the wires didn't start awarding championships until 1936. As soon as I saw the adjustment to the USC football page, I tried to make a happy medium by writing \"7 wire<br>(11 claimed)\"; do you all think that would be a problem? I think it will certainly help find middle ground with programs that get extra-defensive about this sort of thing. (doesn't Bama claim something like 16 championships?) --Bobak\n\nAlso: if this is considered a good idea (and it may not), it would also be a good idea to removed the \"Wire\" in front of the \"Wire National Champsionships\" --Bobak\n\nI don't think that's necessary because the school can still make reference to its claimed national championships within the body of the article. The goal is to increase reliability and eliminate WP:COI concerns in the infobox national championship field, since it has unique prominence. We can't say USC is in fact an 11-time national champion, but we can say unequivocally that USC has won 7 wire national championships.-PassionoftheDamon\n\n(the Elis are going to be crushed by this) but onto the current big boys: how is it a COI to clearly demarkate \"Claimed\" vs. \"Wire\"? The over 60 years of college football played before 1936 get a bit of a shaft here. In the alternative: There should at least, the very least, be a wikilink on \"Wire\" to something that explains exactly what a \"Wire National Championship\" is --since I think it's safe to assume that many non-cfb fans may not know what that refers to. The other suggestion would be to place \"(post-1936)\" but that would get crowded. --Bobak\n\nThe pre-1936 era doesn't get a shaft because pre-1936 national championships are still represented within the body of the article. Putting \"claimed\" national championships in the infobox raises serious WP:COI because it allows the individual schools to be the arbiter of how they are perceived; a school is held out as an X-time national champion simply because the school says it is an X-time national champion. It's also important to remember that most of the pre-1936 national championships are retroactive, i.e. claimed well after the season in question. Thus, we're not ignoring anything that the players actually earned on the field during that season. By making the field specify \"wire national championships\" we give a number that is concrete and verifiable, instead of allowing these infoboxes to essentially become the product of a school's public relations propaganda. We can say definitively that school Y is an X-time wire national champion. I do agree, however, that it would be a good idea to define \"wire national titles\" within the infobox. Perhaps somebody with the syntax know-how could put a symbol next to the phrase, followed by small text at the bottom of the infobox explaining what wire national championships are. Alternatively, I could just rephrase the template to read, \"AP/Coaches National Titles,\" rather than \"Wire National Titles.\"-PassionoftheDamon\n\nHang on\n\nI’ve been out of town, so I am just catching up on this discussion and have several concerns. First, a limitation to “Wire National Titles” is too esoteric for the non-college football fan. One of the things that we learned from the comments in the recent FA nomination for the Oklahoma Sooners article is that we have to write the articles for people who are not college football fans. We cannot expect the non-college football fan to know that “Wire National Titles” excludes anything before 1936, is limited to one poll from 1936 to 1950 and limited to two polls after 1949.\n\nSecond, the idea that, from 1936 to 1949, the only “national champions” that will be recognized in the info box are those who were selected in the AP poll will lead to a conflict between the College Football Data Warehouse (if not other sources) and Wikipedia.\n\n1936 CFDW recognizes Michigan and Pittburgh, but Wikipedia would only recognize Minnesota.[4]\n\n1938 CFDW recognizes Tennessee and TCU, but Wikipedia would only recognize TCU. [5]\n\n1942 CFDW recognizes Georgia and Ohio State, but Wikipedia would only recognize Ohio State.[6]\n\n1946 CFDW recognizes Army and Notre Dame, but Wikipedia would recognize only Notre Dame.[7]\n\n1947 CFDW recognizes Michigan and Notre Dame, but Wikipedia would recognize only Notre Dame.[8]\n\nIn each of these years, I think that the CFDW approach to joint national champions is pretty well accepted.\n\nEven after 1949, the planned approach would leave Wikipedia at odds with CFDW. For example, the planned approach would allow only one school to list itself as national champion in 1950 (Oklahoma), when CFDW lists two (Oklahoma and Tennessee).[9]\n\nThird, notwithstanding the fact that a school can explain these discrepancies in the body of the article, the limitations in what can be included in the info box does have an effect on the article and the perception of the school. The purpose of the info box is to provide a summary of information at a glance. Using these new criteria, Tennessee will no longer be able to list 4 national championships in its info box, which conforms with CFDW, but will only be able to list two (1951 and 1998). This seems to create unecessary confusion – why would/should Wikipedia diasgree with other sources? The problem is even more pronounced when a school like Notre Dame is considered. CFDW lists them with 12 recognozed national championships, [10] but, under the new criteria, Notre Dame can only claim 8 in the infobox. 1924, 1929 and 1930 are all ruled out because of the pre-1936 rule, which means that none of the three national championships under Knute Rockne can be included in the info box summary. In 1953, even the CFDW recognizes Notre Dame and Maryland as co-champs, Wikiepedia would disallow the listing in the infobox (Notre Dame was named #1 in over 20 polls, but not AP and UPI).[11]\n\nIn short, I think it is more misleading to limit the National Titles in the info box to “Wire National Titles.” There is no easy solution (after all, that's why we went to the BCS), but I have two proposals. #1 Agree that the CFDW data (or some other objective source) is as good a solution to the problem as any, have the info box match the number of national titles listed by the CFDW and provide a link to the CFDW page for the school. OR #2 Discontinue the practice of listing the number of national titles in the info box altogether – I’d rather have people be required to read the article to figure out the national title question that to give partial or misleading information in the infobox.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nI'm not sure why we should be concerned about a difference between CFDB's listing and the infobox. Is CFDB some kind of official authority? I think not. If we use CFDB's number in the infobox, it would essentially be taking sides and saying that CFDB is THE national championship authority. That's pretty darn arbitrary, especially when you consider your 1953 Notre Dame example: Notre Dame doesn't even claim that national championship because it only counts wire national championships post-1936. Using \"wire national championships\" as the infobox criteria provides a reliable standardized number without \"invalidating\" pre-wire national championships. I much prefer listing so-called wire national championships in the infobox to arbitrarily filtering out pre-1936 sources based on what CFBD says. And simply not listing national championships would be the worst idea of all considering everyone agrees on the legitimacy of AP and UPI national championships. Of all the ways the problem of counting national championships could be attacked, I think the wire idea is by far the fairest.-JDD18\n\nI am not suggesting that CFDB is THE national championship authority. However, CFDB seems to be a well-regarded source of information for college football data and I do think that it is relevant to discuss why our Project should elect to take a different approach than that taken by CFDB. Perhaps it is correct to conclude that \"wire national championships\" is the way to go in the post-1936 era because schools such as Notre Dame only \"count\" \"wire national championships\" in their self-tally of national championships. Unfortunately, I do not think that all schools are in agreement on that particular point. For example, Tennessee claims 6 championships in its media guide, not just the two \"wire national championships\" and Michigan's website asserts 11 national championships, including 1947, when Michigan was listed #1 by 28 selectors and Notre Dame was listed #1 by 10 selectors (including the AP). (By the way, I am NOT advocating that a school's media guide should be the determining factor). The point that I am trying to make is that the limitation in the infobox to \"wire national championships\" seems to create some inconsistent results as well. Additionally, this still leaves a gap in the infobox as to pre-1936 national championships. --Tlmclain | Talk\n\nI don't see the internal inconsistencies that you speak of. The national championship article has explicit sections on most AP and most UPI national championships. I also think you misunderstand the rationalé behind using wire national championships: they're being used not because schools like Notre Dame and Oklahoma only count wire national championships, but because they are the most widely accepted national championship selectors. Nobody disputes the legitimacy of an AP or UPI national championship the way they do with those other claimed sources. For better worse, the AP and UPI polls are the accepted determinants of Division I-A national championships. Nothing equivalent existed pre-1936, but that's not our fault. If non-wire championships are listed, we're confronted with 2 problems: (1) allow the schools to dictate how many national championships they've \"won\" by going with the claimed number, which allows for counting fictitious retroactive national championships and conflict of interest problems, or (2) start listing \"recognized\" titles, which involves making a subjective determination of who the championships need to be \"recognized\" by. I also know that if we were to list pre-1936 national championships, even based on CFW's numbers, we're going to have a ton of edit warring. Fans of the school in question will revert again and again to their claimed national championships if it's a larger number, while fans of rival schools will probably revert to a different number, creating a sort-of arms race. I find the wire approach by far the most appealing proposal.JDD18\n\nI must have been writing my new comments when you posted this, so I missed it. Some of the inconsistencies are outlined in my comments below under the new heading. Clearly AP and the Coaches Poll are widely recognized, but I don't think the inquiry ends there. Its interesting that the NCAA has chosen to resolve this issue by not resolving it at all - they do not list national champions and provide all information regarding who was voted #1 by which poll in each year. My point is that if we are going to move beyond what the NCAA is willing to do we should be uncomfortable in saying that the only national champions that we are going to recognize are the ones reflected in the AP poll since 1936 and the AP and Coaches poll since 1950.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nI disagree entirely. We are not only \"recognizing\" wire national championships right now; we're only listing wire national championships in the infobox. The current infobox takes a completely neutral stance to non-wire national championships. If we do as you suggest and adopt the CFW number, we will, in fact, be invalidating certain pre-1936 national championships. As such, that's the more troubling approach. I also strongly contest the claim that listing wire national championships is somehow misleading. It's not. It would be misleading to keep the field \"national championships\" and then proceed to list only wire national championships (or CFW recognized national championships); it's not when the field claims to represent only wire national championships.JDD18\n\nI think it may all come down to what information is supposed to be conveyed by the info box: If it is supposed to be a summary of the contents of the article, then limiting the national champ info to \"wire\" championships is potentially misleading. If the info box has a different purpose, then perhaps \"wire\" championships is not potentially misleading. My overall concern relates to the perspective of the reader - i.e., what does the casual college football fan think/expect is included in the infobox regarding national championships? When it says \"Wire National Titles,\" you and I know what that means and I'm not worried about us. But do people who are not members of this Project know what it means? It seems pretty clear that you and I will not resolve this issue by ourselves - we really need to hear from others. If the final solution is to leave \"Wire National Titles\" in the info box, then there has to be an explanation of what that means. A decision will also have to be made with respect what to do about non-compliance with whatever standard is adopted in the end.--Tlmclain | Talk\n\nI'm for using wire national championships, as well, and I think the lack of edit warring on articles like Alabama, Notre Dame, Michigan, and USC football since the change was instituted is testament to its utility, fairness, and acceptance.-PassionoftheDamon\n\nI certainly understand the appeal of setting a simple standard on what goes into an infobox and agree that \"wire national championships\" provides such a standard - Either a team is listed #1 in a wire poll or it isn't. However, I am concerned that picking \"wire national championships\" as the standard is itself a bit arbitrary. By definition, it means that no national championship prior to 1936 can be listed in the infobox only becuase there were no wire service polls prior to 1936. If the goal of college football infoboxes is to provide a summary of a football program, isn't a limitation to \"wire national championships\" misleading? While \"wire national championships\" might mean something to those of us who are involved in this Project, does it have any meaning to a casual college football fan who is looking to Wikipedia for quick information? Would a non-football fan know that they need to read the entire article to understand that Notre Dame has 11 national championships, not just the 8 shown in the infobox? Even though it may be difficult, shouldn't the Project be trying to create a infobox that reflects \"consensus\" national champions? 1947 provides an example of what I am talking about: Michigan was listed #1 by 28 selectors, while Notre Dame was listed #1 by 10 selectors. However, since Notre Dame's selectors included including the AP and the AP was the only wire service in operation in 1947, the proposed policy would only allow Notre Dame to include 1947 in its inbox tally of national championships.\n\nThere are also internal inconsistencies within Wikipedia on this point. NCAA Division I-A national football championships lists both Michigan and Notre Dame in 1947 and does not follow the \"wire championships only rule.\" --Tlmclain | Talk\n\nEhh, I wouldn't go as far as saying the lack of a edit war over a change instituted over a holiday weekend is a testament to its utility, fairness and acceptance. If it makes it through maybe this week you could say that, but i'm sure i'm not alone in coming into work today and finding this change put in place without a consensus. Watch out for edit wars and try to direct any opposition to this discus"
