The eye is fine now, thanks to my two surgeons, but I’m still a stickler for taking good care of your eyes.\n\nIt drives me nutty when I see people wearing sunglasses indoors; take care of your damn eyes!!! Why were several guys at the draft wearing sunglasses inside? It is nonsensical.\n\n— Chicago Bears had the first pick in this draft, the first time since 1947 they had the first pick; they took USC QB Caleb Williams, then later took Washington WR Rome Odunze with the 9th pick. Bears have never had a QB throw 30+ TD’s in a season, or for 4,000+ yards in a season; they seem determine to break those trends.\n\nIn two years at USC, Williams took only seven snaps under center (as opposed to the shotgun) but lot of college QB’s have gone thru that recently, so no big deal there.\n\n— Commanders/Patriots followed by doing the expected, taking QB’s Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye; this was the 4th time since 1971 that the first three picks in a draft were QB’s.\n\n— Before the draft, Eagles signed WR AJ Brown to a 3-year extension worth $96M, with $84M of that guaranteed.\n\n— NFL commish Roger Goodell had back surgery 3-4 weeks ago, so his greetings on stage with guys who got drafted were a little more subdued this year.\n\nBy the way, they estimated that there were 275,000 people at the draft in Detroit. Must have been a solid night for the pickpockets in the crowd.\n\n— Atlanta Falcons stunned lot of people (including newly acquired QB Kirk Cousins) by drafting Washington QB Michael Penix with the #8 pick. Penix has already torn his right ACL twice, and separated both shoulders; he wasn’t even at the draft, but went with the 8th pick.\n\n— Vikings traded up one spot and drafted Michigan QB JJ McCarthy; they later traded up again and took Alabama LB Dallas Turner.\n\nTo get Turner with the 17th pick, Vikings gave Jacksonville a 5th round pick this year, plus 3rd and 4th round picks next year- they must really like him.\n\nThis was the earliest the Vikings have ever drafted a QB; in 1999, they took Daunte Culpepper with the 11th pick in the draft.\n\n— Denver drafted Oregon QB Bo Nix with the 12th pick; Mel Kiper said Nix reminds him a little bit of Drew Brees. Nix started 61 games at Auburn/Oregon, the all-time record for college starts; he gets to learn from Sean Payton, one of the better QB gurus.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 26th:\n\nCarol Burnett, 91\n\nGary Cuozzo, 83\n\nDoug France, 71\n\nPhil Olsen, 66\n\nKevin James, 59\n\nCole Beasley, 35\n\nJoey Wendle, 34\n\nAaron Judge, 32\n\n— One of the surprising things about the Falcons drafting a QB is that they need defense; over the last three years, Atlanta has a total of only 81 sacks, least in the NFL.\n\n— Apparently, Vikings/Patriots both called the Chargers and tried to trade for QB Justin Herbert; both were told to take a hike.\n\n— Cardinals drafted WR Marvin Harrison Jr; he is the 5th first round pick ever whose dad was an NFL Hall of Famer.\n\n— Two LSU receivers went in the first round:\n\nGiants took Malik Cabers, Jaguars took Brian Thomas.\n\nLast three LSU receivers drafted in the first round:\n\n2021- Ja’Maar Chase\n\n2020- Justin Jefferson\n\n2014- Odell Beckham\n\n— First 14 players drafted play offense, which is an all-time record.\n\n— Lot of media people are obsessed with “Who won the trade?” but it is possible for both teams to win (or lose) a trade.\n\n— Rams had their first 1st round pick since 2016 (Jared Goff); they took DE Jared Verse of Florida State, who played his first two college years at I-AA Albany, where I went to school. With Aaron Donald retiring, Rams need to bolster their defense.\n\n— Last month, Steelers traded a 6th round pick for QB Justin Fields; word comes out that they’re not going to pick up his 5th-year $25M option next winter, since they also acquired Russell Wilson.\n\n— Six of the first 12 picks were quarterbacks, tying 1983 for the most QB’s taken in the first round; for what its worth, four of those six players transferred during their college careers.\n\n— Draft continues Friday, with the 2nd/3rd round picks happening then.\n\nThese are 15 of my favorite non-sports movies. Make your own list.\n\nRemember, these are my favorite movies, not the movies that are necessarily the best. Of the 50 movies USA Today listed as the best ever, I’ve seen three of them. Seriously.\n\n15) Runaway Jury— I’m a big fan of the John Grisham books; this was my favorite of the ones that were turned into movies. Gene Hackman plays a jury consultant whose client is a gun manufacturer; John Cusack is on the jury to manipulate the verdict.\n\n14) Moon Over Parador— Richard Dreyfuss is an actor who is hired to stand in for the dictator of a Latin American country who suddenly dies. Jonathan Winters is a weird CIA agent whose wife is Polly Holliday, who played Flo in the old TV series Alice.\n\n13) Dave— Made five years after Moon Over Parador, this is basically the same movie, just set in Washington, DC.\n\nGuy who looks just the President runs a temp service in Washington; when the real president has a stroke while screwing around with his mistress, the guy (Kevin Kline) is hired as the stand-in president. Sigourney Weaver is the First Lady.\n\n12) A Few Good Men— The last scene, with Jack Nicholson on the witness stand, is tremendous. Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Pollak, JT Walsh as supporting actors is pretty strong.\n\n11) The Verdict— Paul Newman is a struggling lawyer who is handed a winning case, but winning it is easier said than done. His friend is played by Jack Warden, one of my all-time favorites.\n\n10) The Gambler— Remake of a James Caan movie from the mid-70’s. College professor (Mark Wahlberg) seems to have an excellent life, but he has a huge gambling problem which drags him down. John Goodman plays one of the people he owes money to; he is very good in this.\n\n9) The Bodyguard— Whitney Houston is a famous singer with a contract on her head; Kevin Costner is the ex-Secret Service hired to protect her.\n\n8) Prince of Tides— A football coach from the south comes to New York City to talk to his sister’s psychiatrist about his sister’s suicide attempt, and their family history- then they in love. Nick Nolte is the coach, Barbra Streisand is the psychiatrist.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 19th:\n\nKeith Erickson, 80\n\nMark van Eeghen, 72\n\nFrank Viola, 64\n\nSpike Owen, 63\n\nAshley Judd, 56\n\nJeff Wilkins, 52\n\nKate Hudson, 45\n\nTroy Polamalu, 43\n\nJoe Mauer, 41\n\n7) Leap of Faith— Steve Martin plays a traveling preacher whose bus breaks down, stranding his crew in a drought-stricken Kansas town. Miracles ensue. Liam Neeson, Debra Winger, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meat Loaf all have supporting roles.\n\n6) Lost In Translation— Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who is in Tokyo getting paid $2M to do a whiskey commercial. He meets Scarlett Johansson in the hotel bar and they become friends.\n\n5) Begin Again— Down-and-out music executive stumbles into a Manhattan bar and discovers a young singer who can resurrect his career, while starting the singer on her own career.\n\n4) Good Will Hunting— Janitor at MIT can do complicated math problems better than the professors can, but he also has a criminal record, and has to get counseling for that. Robin Williams is great as the counselor.\n\n3) Molly’s Game— Young woman runs high stakes poker games for celebrities/rich guys, but when members of the Russian mob enter the game, things get complicated. This is a true story, and as we’re learning nowadays, real life is often stranger than fiction.\n\n2) Last Vegas— Four old friends get together in Las Vegas for the bachelor party of the one bachelor in group (Michael Douglas) who is marrying a woman 40 years younger than him. It is Douglas, Robert DeNiro, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Kline.\n\n1) Rounders— Law student decides he’d rather play high stakes poker than go to law school. The scenes with Matt Damon and his law professor (Martin Landau) are excellent. Same guys who wrote this wrote the great Showtime series Billions.\n\n— OJ Simpson has passed away at age 76.\n\nHe was a Pro Football Hall of Famer, a great running back.\n\nHe was acquitted of double murder in 1995; his ex-wife and a male friend of hers, after he was arrested following a slow-paced car chase on national TV.\n\nHe was convicted of armed robbery in 2008.\n\nThe trial in 1994-95 was a huge deal on TV; prosecutor Marcia Clark wound up as a celebrity guest on the Hollywood Squares, and she lost the trial.\n\nWhile the trial was going on, a friend of mine who is a lawyer told me that OJ would never get convicted; he was correct.\n\nIn any event, my dad and I bet $3 on the verdict; I had guilty, my dad had not guilty. When they announced when the verdict would be announced, I drove over to his house, and we each threw $3 on the floor. When they said “not guilty” my dad jumped off the couch, scooped the $6 off the floor and jogged out to the kitchen to tell my mother he won $3 from me.\n\nOne bet I didn’t mind losing; just hearing his laugh was worth it.\n\n— NFL schedule gets released next month; obviously the Chiefs play at home on Thursday night in Week 1, but this year, Packers-Eagles are playing on Friday in Week 1, with the game taking place in San Paolo, Brazil, the NFL’s first-ever game in South America.\n\n— Chiefs’ WR Rashee Rice faces eight criminal charges, including aggravated assault, after he and another driver caused a chain-reaction accident in Dallas on March 31. Rice was driving a Lamborghini, the other driver a Corvette.\n\n— Tuesday night in the NBA, Golden State Warriors made 26-41 3-point shots in their 134-120 win over the Lakers in Los Angeles. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were a combined 16-23 behind the arc.\n\n— Jrue Holiday agreed to a 4-year, $135M contract extension with the Boston Celtics; Holiday is shooting 43% on the arc this season, 62% on corner 3’s, which makes his more valuable.\n\n— HBO’s great comedy program Curb Your Enthusiasm ended Sunday night; 120 episodes over 12 seasons. Great comedy is hard to do; they did it for 12 seasons, stretched out over 20 years.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 12th:\n\nMike Garrett, 80\n\nEd O’Neill, 78\n\nDavid Letterman, 77\n\nAndy Garcia, 68\n\nJerry Goff, 60\n\nPaul LoDuca, 52\n\nBrad Miller, 48\n\nClaire Danes, 45\n\n— As I type this, they’re talking on the Orioles’ TV broadcast about the possibility of MLB eventually going to a slightly smaller baseball, like the ones they use in Asia. The recent rash of injuries to pitchers has MLB looking for an answer to the problem.\n\n— Royals 13, Astros 3\n\nRoyals sweep Houston, have now won seven games in a row.\n\nIn the first inning, Kansas City scored 9 runs on 11 hits.\n\n— Mets 16, Braves 4\n\nMets led 7-0 in the third inning.\n\n— A’s 1, Rangers 0\n\nJP Sears got 19 outs, allowed only four baserunners.\n\nSeth Brown’s 2nd inning homer was the game’s only run.\n\nA’s won four of their last five games, after a 1-7 start.\n\n— White Sox 3B Yoan Moncada is out 3 months or so with an adductor strain.\n\n— Field for the Maui Classic basketball tournament in November:\n\nGonzaga, Kansas, Marquette, Purdue\n\nSyracuse, Tennessee, UCLA and the host school, Chaminade.\n\n— DePaul has hired former Butler coach LaVell Jordan to be its general manager, a new term in college basketball. Acquiring players is a real thing in college sports; it is now a miniature version of pro sports, for better or worse.\n\n— There have been 61 head coaching changes in D-I college basketball, with Kentucky figuring to be #62, if/when they find someone they want who also wants them.\n\nKentucky is now negotiating a 5-year deal with BYU coach Mark Pope, a 1996 Kentucky alum who played two years for the Wildcats. Pope was 77-56 coaching Utah Valley, 34-24 in WAC games, then he went 110-52 in five years at BYU, 49-29 in conference games.\n\n— Diamondbacks have scored in the first inning in 9 of their 13 games (6-7).\n\n— Over is 7-2-1 in Atlanta Braves’ games.\n\n— Cubs are 5-1 in Chicago, 2-4 on the road.\n\n— I have two guys on the Reds on my fantasy team:\n\nChristian Encarnacion-Strand is hitting .154\n\nJeimer Candelario is hitting .152.\n\nFreakin’ awesome.\n\n— Colorado Rockies are 2-4 at home, 1-6 on road; over is 5-2 in their home games.\n\n— LA Dodgers are 6-1 at home, 4-4 away from home.\n\n— Miami Marlins are 2-11, 0-7 at home, where the over is 5-2.\n\n— Over is 5-1-1 in the Milwaukee Brewers’ last seven games.\n\n— Mets’ pitching staff is 22nd in WHIP, but #8 in earned run average.\n\n— Phillies’ last seven games stayed under the total.\n\n— Pittsburgh Pirates are 9-3, have best record in the National League.\n\n— Under is 6-2 in the Cardinals’ last eight games.\n\n— San Diego Padres are 2-7 when they score less than six runs.\n\n— Over is 7-0 in Giants’ road games, under is 5-1 in their home tilts.\n\n— Washington has scored in first inning in only one of its 12 games.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 11th:\n\nPeter Riegert, 77\n\nMicheal Ray Richardson, 69\n\nJim Breech, 68\n\nBret Saberhagen, 60\n\nJason Varitek, 52\n\nMark Teixeira, 44\n\n— Orioles’ opponents have a .205 on-base %age, tied with Boston for best in MLB.\n\n— Tyler O’Neill is hitting .343 with six home runs, but has only 7 RBI.\n\n— White Sox are 1-6 in games where winning run scored from 7th inning on.\n\n— Cleveland Guardians won six of their last seven games.\n\n— Detroit is 6-1 in games where winning run scored from 7th inning on.\n\n— Astros haven’t had a losing year in a full season since 2014; they’re off to a 4-9 start this year, 0-5 in games where winning run scored from 7th inning on.\n\n— Kansas City Royals haven’t had a winning season since they won the World Series in 2015; they’re off to a 8-4 start this year, 7-2 at home. Royals got a quality start in nine of their 12 games so far.\n\n— 3B Anthony Rendon makes $38M a year, more than Mike Trout; Rendon is hitting .150 so far this season. Trout is off to a .318 start, with six homers, 8 RBI\n\n— Minnesota Twins lost six of their last eight games; under is 4-1 in their home games.\n\n— Aaron Judge is off to an 8-45 start, but he’s walked 14 times; his on-base %age is .367.\n\n— Oakland A’s are 1-6 at home, 3-2 on the road; they’re 4-3 when they score 4+ runs, 0-5 when they don’t.\n\n— Mariners lost six of their last eight games; under is 9-3 in their last 12 games.\n\n— Tampa Bay 1B Yandy Diaz hit .296/.330 the last two years; he’s off to a .208 start this year, with a .561 OPS. His career OPS is .813.\n\n— Under is 6-2 in the Texas Rangers’ last eight games.\n\n— Toronto scored in first inning in two of its three home games, only one of its 10 road tilts.\n\n— Two weeks in Las Vegas is always fun; hung out with friends, watched lot of games, even made a few bucks gambling, but after two weeks, it is good to be home.\n\nTook me 13 hours Tuesday to get from my hotel room in Las Vegas to my living room in upstate New York; I’m not at my best being around a lot of people. Will be fun to chill here at home by myself the next couple of days.\n\n— I’ll repeat myself: DuPar’s in the SunCoast casino has the best pancakes I’ve ever had.\n\n— There are murmurs on the Interweb that a part of the reason that John Calipari left Kentucky for Arkansas is that he wanted to hire his son Brad as an assistant coach, and the powers-that-be weren’t real receptive to that.\n\nBrad Calipari was director of on-court player development at Vanderbilt this past season; the Commodores went 9-23, and head coach Jerry Stackhouse and his staff was fired.\n\nWill be interesting to see if Brad Calipari surfaces at Arkansas with his father.\n\n— A’s 4, Rangers 3- Oakland C Shea Langeliers knocked in all four A’s runs with three homers, as the spunky A’s won their third consecutive game- they’re 3-1 on the road, 1-7 at home.\n\n— White Sox 7, Guardians 5- Teams had been 0 for their last 41 with runners in scoring position against Cleveland, but they scored five runs in the first inning here, against Logan Allen, who I added to my fantasy team this week (then cut him when Chicago scored their 5th run in this game).\n\nIt is only April 10th and I’ve already cut two pitchers off my fantasy team, while they were still pitching in a game; I could never be a doctor, because I have no patience. (its a joke, kind of)\n\nCleveland tied the game, but Dominic Fletcher won it with a 2-run double in the top of the 8th inning for the Pale Hose.\n\n— Tigers 5, Pirates 3- Pittsburgh was three outs from a 10-2 start, but Detroit scored four runs in the 9th inning, to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\n— Rays 6, Angels 4- José Caballero went 3-4, with two runs scored, two RBI, as Tampa Bay evened its record at 6-6.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 10th:\n\nMel Blount, 76\n\nKen Griffey Sr., 74\n\nSteve Tasker, 62\n\nScott Bentley, 50\n\nKenny Satterfield, 43\n\nRobert Woods, 32\n\nJake Burger, 28\n\nThe late actor Chuck Connors was born on April 10, 1921; he was The Rifleman on TV, and also played in both pro basketball (53 games for Boston) and major league baseball (67 games from 1949-51, mostly for the Cubs)\n\nThe late actor Harry Morgan (Colonel Potter on M*A*S*H) was born on April 10, 1915\n\n— Baseball injuries:\n\nHouston P Framber Valdez (elbow)\n\nAngels’ P Chase Silseth (elbow)\n\nWhite Sox 3B Yoan Moncada (adductor)\n\nRed Sox 2B Trevor Story (shoulder) is out for the year.\n\n— In December 2019, Washington Nationals signed star P Stephen Strasburg to a 7-year, $245M contract that didn’t turn out so well. Having just won the World Series, Washington spent some cash on one of its stars, but Strasburg was 1-4, 6.89 in 31 innings after the contract was signed.\n\nStrasburg retired this week; since he signed the contract, Washington is 221-335- they won 90+ games in three of his last four healthy seasons.\n\n— Braves 6, Mets 5\n\nAtlanta led 5-0 in 4th inning, hung on for dear life.\n\nRonald Acuna was 2-3, stole three bases, scored three runs.\n\nReynaldo López tossed six shutout IP, before the bullpen’s rough night.\n\n— Royals 4, Astros 3 (10)\n\nRoyals are 7-4, Houston is 4-8.\n\nAstros led 3-0 in 5th inning; throwing error by Bregman tied the game 3-3.\n\nSalvador Perez had a walk-off single in the 10th inning,\n\n— Dodgers 6, Twins 3\n\nTyler Glasnow had 14 strikeouts while throwing seven shutout innings; he threw only 88 pitches. Since 1988, that is the fewest number of pitches thrown by a hurler with 14+ strikeouts in a game.\n\n— Blue Jays 5, Mariners 3\n\nChris Bassitt needed 115 pitches to get 20 outs, the most pitches thrown in a game this season.\n\nSeattle is off to a disappointing 4-8 start.\n\n— Baltimore Orioles are calling #1 prospect Jackson Holliday up from the minor leagues; the son of former big leaguer Matt Holliday, the 20-year old infielder hit .333 in ten AAA games this month.\n\n— Favorites did unusually well in the NCAA Tournament:\n\nFavorites went 39-28 ATS in all the games, best favorites have done since 2008.\n\nIn the seven games from the Elite 8 on, favorites were 6-1 ATS, best they’ve done since 1981.\n\nTournament favorites of 8+ points went 20-5 ATS, the best they’ve ever d0ne.\n\nTop-3 seeds went 21-10 ATS against #4 or lower seeds, their best record since 2009.\n\n— UConn 75, Purdue 60\n\nUConn wins the national title for second year in a row.\n\nZach Edey scored 37 points, the other Boilermakers 23.\n\nLast two years, Huskies are 12-0 SU/ATS in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n— Purdue led 23-21 with 7:24 left in the first half, but trailed 36-30 at the half.\n\n— UConn lost five of its top eight scorers from last year, and still won another national title. Really, a tremendous accomplishment.\n\n— Saturday’s Final Four games were first time since 2018, and only 4th time since 2002 that both favorites covered in the national semi-finals.\n\n— Last week’s Sweet 16 had five upsets in eight games, the most of any Sweet 16 since 2011.\n\n— Big 14 still hasn’t won a national title in college basketball since Michigan State in 2000.\n\n— I’m sitting in the Rampart Casino sportsbook yesterday for the first time; nice place. Friend of mine is talking to this older guy while we’re sitting there watching baseball. Eventually we get up to leave, I say good night to the older guy and he says to me, “You need a hair cut!!!”\n\nThanks, buddy.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 9th:\n\nRob Scribner, 73\n\nDennis Quaid, 70\n\nKyle Macy, 67\n\nKirk McCaskill, 63\n\nBo Kimble, 58\n\nZac Stacy, 33\n\nLuis Arraez, 27\n\n— Padres 9, Cubs 8\n\nChicago led this game 8-0 in the sixth inning,\n\nFernando Tatis had the game-winner, a 2-run homer in 8th inning,\n\n— Nationals 8, Giants 1\n\nBlake Snell had a rough debut with SF: 3 IP, 3 runs; 33 balls. 39 strikes.\n\nLane Thomas was 3-5 with three RBI for Washington.\n\n— Marlins’ OF Bryan De La Cruz is off to a 14-48 (.292) start this season, but he hasn’t walked at all in his 48 at-bats. No walks, 11 strikeouts, one home run, one RBI.\n\n— Pirates 7, Tigers 4\n\nBryan Reynolds hit his 100th career home run.\n\nPittsburgh is off to a 9-2 start.\n\nMitch Keller allowed two runs in 6 IP, with 9 strikeouts.\n\n— Mets 8, Braves 7\n\nAtlanta led 4-0 after three innings.\n\nDJ Stewart hit the game-winning home in the 8th inning.\n\n— Astros 10, Rangers 5\n\nTexas scored five runs in bottom of 1st inning, but no more after that.\n\nYordan Alvarez was 3-5, with three runs scored, three RBI.\n\n— Phillies 5, Cardinals 3 (10)\n\nSt Louis tied game with two runs in ninth inning.\n\nAlec Bohm had the game-winning double in top of the 10th.\n\n— Fifty years ago this week, Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run, breaking Babe Ruth’s record.\n\n— OK, so this came out of nowhere; John Calipari is bolting from Kentucky to Arkansas; if this had happened last Monday, would’ve assumed it was a (bad) April Fools Day joke.\n\nKentucky was 23-10 this year, 13-5 in a tough SEC, with the #317 continuity team in America, but in the three years since the pandemic, Kentucky is 1-3 in NCAA tournament games, which doesn’t fly with a very spoiled fanbase.\n\nCalipari spent 15 years at Kentucky; he made the Elite 8 five of his first six years there, but lately, not so much. Overall, Kentucky was 32-11 overall in NCAA Tournament games under Calipari.\n\nCalipari is a great coach; he got freakin’ UMass to the Final Four. Will he change his approach at Arkansas? Will he use the transfer portal more and recruit fewer freshmen? Will he bring his son Brad along with him? Brad Calipari was an assistant at Vanderbilt the last couple years.\n\nWhere Kentucky turns from here (Mick Cronin?) is a very interesting question. .\n\n— One thing for sure; college sports if off its rocker; crazy stuff going on.\n\n— Pirates 3, Orioles 2- Pittsburgh is 8-2 for first time since 2018; they’re already 5-0 in games where the winning run scored from the 7th inning on.\n\n— Marlins 10, Cardinals 3- Miami gets its first win this year in its 10th game; Luis Arraez went 4-5 with three runs scored. Marlins scored six runs in the first inning.\n\n— Cubs 8, Dodgers 1- Early part of this game was played in cruddy weather; there was nearly a 3-hour rain delay after the Cubs led 6-0.\n\n— Rays 3, Rockies 2- Ryan Pepiot tossed six shutout innings, struck out 11 while allowing only three hits.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 8th:\n\nRicky Bell, 69\n\nTerry Porter, 61\n\nRobin Wright, 58\n\nCarlos Santana, 38 (first baseman, not the singer)\n\nJeff McNeil, 32\n\nZach Eflin, 30\n\nCeeDee Lamb, 25\n\nToday would’ve been Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter’s 78th birthday.\n\n— Astros 3, Rangers 1- Houston pitcher Ronel Blanco is the first pitcher in the last 50 years (50 years!!!) to start a season by throwing 13 no-hit innings.\n\n— A’s 7, Tigers 1- A’s are 3-0 when they score in the first inning, 0-7 when they do not.\n\n— Giants 3, Padres 2- San Francisco scored a total of six runs in this 3-game series, somehow won two of the three games.\n\n— Red Sox 12, Angels 2- Boston starts the season with a 7-3 road trip; their home opener is Tuesday against the Orioles.\n\n— Royals 5, White Sox 3- Chicago is off to a 1-8 start, 0-5 in games where the winning run scored from the 7th inning on.\n\n— Birmingham 20, Michigan 13\n\nStallions outgained Michigan 302-205, held Panthers to 47 rushing yards.\n\nBirmingham backup QB Martinez threw for 88 yards, ran for 65 more.\n\n— DC Defenders 23, Houston 18\n\nDefenders outscored Houston 11-0 in fourth quarter.\n\nHouston converted 3-13 on third down against Gregg Williams’ defense.\n\nJordan Ta’amu threw a 17-yard TD pass with 6:04 left for the winning score.\n\n— Purdue 63, NC State 50\n\nPurdue never trailed, held NC State to 36.8% from the floor.\n\nPurdue out-rebounded the Wolfpack, 41-28.\n\n64 possessions; slow pace. Three Boilers played 38:00+.\n\n— If I had a vote, I’d vote for Purdue coach Matt Painter as Coach of the Year in college basketball; his team lost in the first round as a #1-seed last year, only the second time that has ever happened, had to be a tough summer for him, but now they’re one win away from doing the same thing Virginia did, winning a national title the year after they got beat by a #16-seed.\n\n— UConn 86, Alabama 72\n\nHuskies outscored Alabama 42-32 in second half.\n\n63-possession game, slowest-paced game Alabama played all season.\n\nLast two years, UConn is 11-0 SU/ATS in NCAA Tourney games.\n\n— Early line on Monday’s championship game:\n\nUConn, -6.5 vs Purdue\n\n— San Antonio 20, Memphis 19\n\nMemphis led 16-0 after three quarters.\n\nBrahmas scored two TD’s in the last 0:48 of game.\n\nSan Antonio QB Garbers threw for 287 yards, three TD’s.\n\n— St Louis 27, Arlington 24\n\nBattlehawks kicked a 22-yard FG at the gun for their first win.\n\nSt Louis led 14-11 at halftime.\n\nArlington was 6-11 on third down, St Louis 3-10.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 7th:\n\nJanis Ian, 73\n\nTony Dorsett, 70\n\nJackie Chan, 70\n\nThurl Bailey, 63\n\nRonde/Tiki Barber, 49\n\nAdrian Beltre, 45\n\nJosh Hader, 30\n\n— A’s 4, Detroit 0\n\nPaul Blackburn is 2-0, 0.00 in 13 IP this season.\n\nRest of the A’s are 0-7, outscored 46-15.\n\n— Dodgers 4, Cubs 1\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto’s last two starts:\n\n10 IP, seven baserunners, no runs allowed, with 13 strikeouts.\n\n— Cardinals 3, Marlins 1\n\nMarlins are first MLB team since 2016 to start a season 0-9.\n\nSteven Matz threw five shutout IP.\n\n— Pirates 5, Orioles 4 (11)\n\nDon’t look now, but Pittsburgh is off to a 7-2 start.\n\nJoey Bart had a HR/double in his first two AB’s for the Pirates.\n\n— Braves 9, Diamondbacks 8\n\nArizona led 6-0 after the top of the first.\n\nAustin Riley had the game-winning single in the 8th inning,\n\n— Rays 8, Rockies 6\n\nColorado led 6-1 after six innings.\n\nYandy Diaz had the game-winning single for Tampa Bay.\n\nSometimes here in Las Vegas, the unpleasant aspects of gambling pop up; while I was watching the Tampa Bay-Colorado game, there was a guy sitting in front of me who bet on the Rays, and for the 2:45 of this 3:03 game, he did nothing but bitch and moan about every aspect of his bet, which was Tampa Bay and over.\n\nIf you bet the over on f-bombs this guy used, it probably went over the total in the third inning; Colorado led this game 6-1 after six innings. Dressed like an undercover cop, with long hair, a ski cap and sunglasses, his response when the Rays rallied late to take the lead was “It’s about time” When the Rays won, he got to the cashier, got his money and quietly bolted.\n\n— Baseball injuries:\n\nCleveland P Shane Bieber (elbow) is out for the year.\n\nAtlanta P Spencer Strider (UCL) is going on the IL.\n\n— One of the best parts of casinos here are the good conversations you have with total strangers; had a few this week with a guy who is an options trader, but also has done some acting work in movies. He showed me a picture Saturday of himself with the late James Caan in a movie they were both in— that had to be pretty cool.\n\n— Was watching the A’s play Friday morning here; there were only two other people watching the game in the sportsbook, and one of those guys was on the phone with his brother somewhere in the eastern time zone. Apparently the brother is having some personal problems.\n\nThe guy was loud; he said, at least five times to his brother:”This is just between the two of us” forgetting that I was five feet behind him, and the people selling betting tickets 30 feet away could hear him, too.\n\nThe brothers are in business together; the eastern brother’s marriage is falling apart, and there are rumors his personal assistant could be a reason why. Hopefully everything will turn out OK, but I wouldn’t count on the Las Vegas brother to keep things quiet.\n\n— Modern college basketball: 11 of the 20 players who started in the Final Four Saturday transferred to their current team.\n\n— Bronny James put his name in the transfer portal, but might also declare for the NBA Draft. Interesting situation.\n\nLebron James’ son had a cardiac arrest at a July workout, then sat out four months; he averaged 4.8 ppg in 25 games for USC, starting six times (USC went 1-5 in those games).\n\nWhats next?\n\nUSC coach Andy Enfield bolted to SMU; Eric Musselman, a former NBA head coach, is USC’s new head coach. Seems kind of doubtful that Bronny would transfer, if he stays in college.\n\nIf Bronny goes pro, he is likely to wind up wherever his dad is, and then they can play on the same team for a while, but Bronny isn’t an NBA player yet— he would likely wind up playing in the G-League for 2-3 years after he played some with his dad.\n\n— It snowed a few times during the Oriole-Pirate game Friday; seems like every time it snowed, Pittsburgh was batting.\n\n— Kid playing third base for the A’s Friday was dressed like he was playing for the Packers at Lambeau Field in January.\n\n— Earlier this week, it snowed in upstate New York; Friday morning, there was an earthquake in New Jersey that measured 4.8 on the Richter scale. Good thing I’m out here in the desert, away from all the fun.\n\nOh yeah, there’s an eclipse coming Monday afternoon, too. Glad I won’t be flying home during that.\n\n— Every night I’ve been in the sportsbook here, a young guy comes in, runs over and says hi to one of the ticket sellers, then starts yelling “Lets go Buffalo!!!” even though no teams from Buffalo are playing. Then he yells some stuff about Josh Allen, then roots for whatever teams he bet on. It has happened every night.\n\n— They don’t have Apple TV in the sportsbook; couldn’t watch Mets-Reds or Astros-Rangers Friday night. MLB is so greedy that they forget to market their sport the right way.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 6th\n\nBilly Dee Williams, 86\n\nJohn Ratzenberger, 77\n\nBert Blyleven, 73\n\nMarilu Henner, 72\n\nSterling Sharpe, 59\n\nBret Boone, 55\n\nPaul Rudd, 55\n\nOliver Miller, 54\n\nTim Hasselbeck, 46\n\n— Dodgers lost 9-7 to the Cubs Friday; LA is 7-3- they’ve scored a total of 23 runs in the three games they lost. Once their pitching gets healthier, they’ll be very hard to beat.\n\nShohei Ohtani hit his 2nd homer of the year; he is 12-42 (.286) so far this season.\n\n— There was a kerfuffle involving the baseball Ohtani hit for his first Dodger home run; a fan got the ball, and then a Dodger employee bargained to get the ball back. The woman got a signed bat, two signed hats and an autographed baseball, I’m guessing around $400 worth of stuff, not a bad haul, but the woman complained, because she wanted to meet Ohtani.\n\nI’m guessing when the Dodgers go back home, the meeting will be arranged, public relations being what they are.\n\n— Dodgers have scored 5+ runs in their first ten games this year, which a graphic on TV said was their longest streak ever to start a season.\n\n— Rockies 10, Rays 7\n\nColorado led 6-2 after eight innings.\n\nRays scored five runs in the top of the 9th\n\nRyan McMahon hit a walk-off grand slam in the bottom of the 9th.\n\n— Mets 3, Reds 2\n\nEdwin Diaz got his first save since September, 2022\n\nJeff McNeil was off to a 1-18 start before he homered in 7th inning.\n\n— Brewers 6, Mariners 5\n\nSeattle tied game with two runs in top of the 9th\n\nMariner reliever walked four guys in bottom of 9th, including a walk-off walk.\n\n— Giants 3, Padres 2\n\nThairo Estrada had a walk-off double as Giants won their home opener.\n\n— Seton Hall 79, Indiana State 77\n\nPirates ended game on a 9-0 run to win the NIT\n\nGame was 39-39 at halftime.\n\nSeton Hall was +7 in turnovers (15-8)\n\n— Going to be a tough few days for the Sycamores; ISU coach Josh Schertz is expected to leave Terre Haute this weekend, to take the vacant coaching job at Saint Louis.\n\n— Voters in Kansas City rejected extending a sales tax this week, that would’ve paid for major renovations at Arrowhead Stadium along with a new downtown stadium for the Kansas City Royals. The sales tax is currently in place through 2031; Tuesday’s vote was asking the people of Jackson County to extend the tax through 2064.\n\nChiefs and Royals will now have to figure out what their next step is going to be; re-location is an option, especially for the Chiefs.\n\n— Oakland A’s are going to play the 2025-27 seasons in Sacramento, before they move to a new stadium in Las Vegas in 2028. This is their last season in Oakland, where they started playing in 1968, after moving from, ironically, Kansas City.\n\n— NBA’s Toronto Raptors have lost 15 games in a row, going 3-12 ATS in those games.\n\n— Golden State Warriors are 26-12 ATS on the road, best road record in NBA this season.\n\n— Detroit’s Malachi Flynn scored 50 points off the bench in Atlanta Wednesday, in the Pistons’ 121-113 loss to the Hawks. Flynn is just the third guy ever to score 50+ points coming off the bench, joining Nick Anderson (1993) and Jamal Crawford (2014).\n\nComing into the game, Flynn was averaging 5.2 points/game.\n\n— Guy sat next to me in the sportsbook and lit up a cigarette, blowing smoke in my direction. I’d forgotten that you can smoke in casinos here; smoking indoors in public isn’t allowed in New York State.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 5th\n\nMichael Moriarity, 83\n\nOliver Luck, 64\n\nDale Hatcher, 61\n\nTony Banks, 51\n\nDane Looker, 48\n\nMarc Bulger, 47\n\nStephen Jackson, 46\n\n— USC hired Eric Musselman as its new basketball coach; Musselman went 111-59 coaching at Arkansas the last five years. Before that, he was 110-34 in four years coaching Nevada. He has also been a head coach in the NBA, for Golden State/Sacramento.\n\n— Purdue big man Zach Edey has taken 424 foul shots this year, the most in one season by a college player since Pete Maravich, way back in 1970.\n\n— UConn’s trip to the Final Four Wednesday night was delayed eight hours due to mechanical issues with the airplane; they finally landed in Arizona at 3:12am local time.\n\n— If you like the NBA, you should be here in Las Vegas July 12-22, when they have the NBA’s Summer League at UNLV. It is fun to watch, it isn’t real expensive, lot of famous people in the arenas, and it is air conditioned— it’ll be over 100 degrees outside.\n\n— On Opening Day of baseball season, there were 166 players on the Injured List, 5.5 players per team.\n\n— Miami Marlins’ pitching prospect Eury Perez is going to have Tommy John surgery, is out for the season.\n\n— Odd Fact of the Day: New York Mets have won two World Series, in 1969/1986.\n\nIn 1969, last out of the World Series was made by Baltimore 2B Davey Johnson.\n\nIn 1986, the Mets were managed by former Baltimore 2B Davey Johnson.\n\n— Big trade in the NFL Wednesday; Buffalo Bills traded star WR Stefon Diggs to Houston, for three draft picks: 2nd/6th round picks later this month, then a 5th round pick in 2025.\n\nDiggs put up 100+ yard receiving games in five of his first six games last year, then averaged only 51.2 yards/game the rest of the season. Buffalo takes a $31M dead cap hit this year, while the Texans are positioning themselves to be favored in the AFC South this fall.\n\n— People here in Las Vegas have been looking at NFL totals bets every day, but how can you do that before the draft in three weeks? Rosters can/will change a lot between now and then.\n\nTeams like Vikings, Broncos don’t know who their QB will be this season; I’m told that QB is kind of an important position in football.\n\n— Sun Coast hotel/casino here in Las Vegas has a 24-hour coffee shop, Du-Par’s, which has the best pancakes I’ve ever had, seriously, they’re excellent.\n\n— Tigers-Mets got rained out the last two days in Queens, will try and play a doubleheader on Thursday, which means I’ll be waking up way earlier than I wanted to.\n\n— In his last three games against New Orleans, Phoenix Suns’ star Devin Booker scored 52-52-58 points, making him only the second player ever to score 50+ points three games in a row against the same team.\n\nWilt Chamberlain is the other player, but he did it against nine different teams, not just one.\n\n— Milwaukee Bucks were 30-13 when they fired coach Adrian Griffin earlier this season; they’re 15-15 since they hired Doc Rivers to replace him.\n\n— Famous birthdays for April 4th:\n\nMike Epstein, 81\n\nCraig T Nelson, 80\n\nChristine Lahti, 74\n\nTommy Herr, 68\n\nJack Del Rio, 61\n\nScott Rolen, 49\n\nBen Gordon, 41\n\nJP France, 29\n\n— RIP to Joe Flaherty, the great comic actor who passed away at age 81; Flaherty was in Second City TV, where he played anchorman Floyd Robertson next to Eugene Levy’s Earl Camembert in the news skits on that excellent comedy show. RIP, sir.\n\nRIP to Barbara Rush, who passed way at age 97; she is one of six actors to appear in both the TV series Batman and the original Magnum PI, where she played Magnum’s Aunt Phoebe. She played Nora Clavicle on Batman. RIP, ma’am.\n\n— College basketball’s Final Four is this weekend; there are already 1,360 names in the college basketball transfer portal, because that is how the sport works now. With 362 Division I teams, that works out to an average of 3.76 players per team in the portal.\n\n— Forgot to mention this earlier in the week, but lefty pitcher Shota Imanaga threw six shutout innings in his MLB debut Monday, not giving up any hits until the 6th inning. Imanaga didn’t get much hype when he signed; that was reserved for Yomamoto with the Dodgers, but so far, so good, although the wind was blowing in Monday and Imanaga is a fly ball pitcher.\n\n— Dodgers 5, Giants 4- Shohei Ohtani hit his first home run for the Dodgers.\n\n— Back in 1948 a guy named Fred Gehrke got paid a dollar a helmet to paint the LA Rams logo on all the Rams’ helmets— they were the first team to have their logo on a helmet, and for that, he is the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as an innovator.\n\nFred Gehrke has a well-known great-grandson; Christian Yelich, outfielder for the Brewers.\n\n— This week marks the 48th anniversary of a cruddy day in A’s history, when they traded Reggie Jackson and Ken Holtzman to the Orioles, as they slowly dismantled what had been a great team, winning the World Series three years in a row (1972-74). By 1977, they were truly terrible, as free agency had started in the major leagues and the A’s couldn’t match up $$$-wise.\n\nNow this year, the A’s are 1-6, and have been shut out three times already. It would be nice if a really, really rich person bought the team and they actually tried to win again.\n\n— For second day in a row, a team lost its DH during a game, but this time, it came back to bite them, in an embarrassing way.\n\nArizona trailed 6-5 at home in the 11th inning- they had runners on 1st/3rd with two outs, but Bronx walked their next batter intentionally, because Arizona’s DH Ketel Marte went in to play shortstop after they pinch-ran for Geraldo Perdomo, which left the Snakes without a hitter when Perdomo’s spot in the order came around in the 11th inning.\n\nPitcher Scott McGough took a called third strike to end the game. Managing in the DH era is supposed to be easier, but two teams losing their DH in the first week of the season, both in close games, seems like managerial malpractice.\n\nI’m going to start posting daily baseball knowledge on the MLB page next Friday (April 12), but in the meantime, here are some trends to get you thru this week:\n\n— Miami Marlins are 0-6; over is 5-1 in those games, their bullpen is 0-3.
