        "text": "Injuries and the Toronto Maple Leafs are pretty much one and the same this season.\n\nAfter a heavy hit from Boston Bruins forward Chris Wagner, forward Trevor Moore left the game and did not return due to a shoulder injury.\n\nThe hit in question looked fairly normal at first, but the shoulder was clearly the main point of contact.\n\nEven if the collision led to the picturesque unleashing of Moore’s “buckets off” look, it was a hard hit to the Maple Leafs’ forward depth.\n\nToronto currently has Mitch Marner and Alexander Kerfoot out with an injury — the former projecting to have the longer absence out of the two. With this hit, the Leafs are going to have to rely heavily on their top-tier talent that’s still relatively healthy.\n\nJohn Tavares and Zach Hyman recently returned from injury, so at least the depth is not completely decimated.\n\nAfter the game, Toronto head coach Mike Babcock provided an update on Moore.\n\nThe 24-year-old winger will not be travelling to Pittsburgh to face the Penguins on Saturday night — the first match of a six-game road trip that has the potential to make or break the Leafs’ season.\n\nPrior to Friday’s game against the Bruins, Moore had scored three goals and five points through 20 games played."
