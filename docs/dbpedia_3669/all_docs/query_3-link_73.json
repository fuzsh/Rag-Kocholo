        "text": "ABOUT THE EXPERT:\n\nTrevor Thompson’s focus areas include climate change and health, environmental and climate justice, values-aligned investing, and strategic foresight. At the NorthLight Foundation, Trevor wrote a report that inspired a medical school to incorporate climate change and health into its curriculum. Trevor also led successful efforts to align NorthLight’s endowment and retirement plans with its mission through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk management.\n\nTrevor previously worked as a strategic foresight professional (professional futurist) at the Institute for Alternative Futures, where he focused on sustainability, climate, health, and emerging technologies. He conducted horizon scans, forecasts, and scenario planning for foundation, nonprofit, and government clients, helping them create long-term (e.g., 20-year) strategies.\n\nTrevor earned his Master of Environmental Management and Master of Business Administration (MEM/MBA) at Yale University and his bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science and Public Policy from Harvard University. At Yale, Trevor worked on sustainability (via the “planetary boundaries” framework), climate, climate justice, and climate and health adaptation projects for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the NAACP, the United Nations Development Programme, U.S. and international localities, and a global transport refrigeration firm.\n\nTrevor has served on boards/steering committees focusing on grassroots environmental justice support, early childhood and climate, and philanthropy. He has been invited to speak on climate, investing, philanthropy, and racial justice.\n\nCONTACT:"
