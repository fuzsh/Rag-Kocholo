        "text": "Late last week, The Ohio State University hired Chip Kelly as their Offensive Coordinator for the Buckeyes football team (Go Bucks!!). Chip Kelly isn't your average football coach who is trying to move up the ladder. He resigned his position as the Head Coach for the UCLA Bruins to take on this role. This leads us to ask, can an Assistant Head Coach be a preferable role to the Head Coach of a major university? In local government, we are seeing a major uptick in interest in the Assistant City/County Manager roles. In fact, City Managers are applying for these \"lesser\" roles. So, what has changed to start driving this trend? How do we work to have our best leaders want to be City Managers and keep those jobs? Is it pay? Is it severance packages? Is it better working relationships with their elected officials and the public? It's important to ask ourselves these questions and understand why someone would voluntarily take a step down in their career, make less money, have less authority, and sometimes do so with glee.\n\nI had a lot of fun making this video and improving my skills! If you are new around here, I also have a lot of fun with my content in drawing parallels to college football and working in the senior living industry. Here is why: üèà In senior living the stakes are high üèà We get beat up a lot if we are not strategic in how we operate our communities üèà There is a lot of pressure to be successful. üèà The arena/stadium is filled with the families, residents, associates, corporate people, state regulators and our own internal dialogue that are rooting for us or yelling at us. üèà When we get it right, it is amazing and it feels like a huge win. üèà When we get it wrong it is as agonizing as the defeat of a close game. I have used college football as my main source of inspiration and \"you can do this\" for as long as I have worked in senior living. Tonight is the BIG Game üèà I am not emotionally invested in either team. But I will still watch it, and if you watch the video, you will see who I choose to root for and how I chose them!! lol One more aspect of the story of Washington that I believe parallels to senior living: The quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and Head Coach Kalen DeBoer were on a different team at the same time before Coach DeBoer got his shot as the Head Coach of the Washington team. Coach DeBoer wanted Michael Penix Jr. on his team. They only had 1 year together, but that is all it takes to know there is a connection. It is important to always give your best effort, to stay connected to people you value and look up too. You never know when the opportunity will come to partner again and create magic! (especially in senior living and healthcare) Give it everything you have 100% of the time. ALL IN! #leadership #seniorliving #assistedliving #memorycare #sportsandbusiness #leadershipdevelopment\n\nüåÜ Attended an enriching event today exploring the dynamic relationship between sports, diversity, and commercial real estate. Huge shoutout to speakers Marcus Thornton, David Yankey, and Steve Dils, all brilliantly moderated by Lamar Wakefield. Steve Dils shared valuable leadership lessons from his time on the field, emphasizing that everyone‚Äôs role is critical to the organization‚Äôs success. This resonated strongly with me and will undoubtedly inform my approach going forward. Marcus Thornton's background in sports and lease administration highlighted the transferable skills that athletes can bring into the real estate industry, a notion that has me thinking deeply thinking how do we take these lesions and apply them. David Yankey‚Äôs expertise in ground-up development is particularly relevant to the initiatives we have in the pipeline, reinforcing the importance of teamwork and strategy in our endeavors. The panel was collectively optimistic about the future of Atlanta, particularly bullish on the industrial space in the Southeast. Despite current headwinds like fluctuating interest rates and increased employee bargaining power, the general sentiment is positive about the long-term resurgence in commercial real estate. These insights will surely influence the digital products we're developing in indoor air quality and occupancy monitoring at Carrier. Thank you all for your wisdom and inspiration! #CommercialRealEstate #Sports #DigitalProducts #IndoorAirQuality #OccupancyMonitoring #Leadership #Atlanta\n\nI'm no math expert - but what employee deserves this type of contractual promise? What possible value could this football coach have offered on the front end that could cause the school think this is a good contractual deal for the University? From the article, Texas A&M announced massive cuts in the athletic department while, according to the article, \"With respect to Fisher‚Äôs buyout, he was owed $76.8 million from Texas A&M, with $19 million paid out within 60 days of his firing. Another $7 million paid out within 120 days of his ouster and the remaining $50.8 million gets paid out in annual installments through 2031 ‚Äî a bit shy of $6.5 million annually.\" I'm sure they could have found someone they didn't have to fire for what - $2 million? Texas A&M fired him after doing very poorly/average in his job last November. While the article claims that there is no cause and effect to the buyout versus the layoff - money has to come from somewhere. And sometimes there isn't enough of it. I guess good for him. But employers - set metrics. Assume on the front end this might not work out and then work from there. Things look great at the engagement but sometimes you don't really know who are you committing to. #Employmentlaw #emplaw #HR #employmentcontracts #ReductionsInForce\n\nDear Friends and Colleagues, Today, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to Sarah Pierman the CEO of Dynamic Boards, and her incredible team for their tireless dedication to reshaping the landscape of board opportunities. Their unwavering commitment to accessibility and inclusivity has left an indelible mark on the world of executive leadership, and it's time we celebrate their remarkable work. For years, I embarked on a quest to find meaningful board opportunities that aligned with my aspirations and values. It was a journey filled with countless hours of research, endless networking, and fruitless endeavours. I knew I had the skills and passion to contribute effectively at the board level, but the barriers seemed insurmountable. That's when Dynamic Boards entered my life, and everything changed. Dynamic Boards isn't just a platform; it's a beacon of hope for those seeking board positions. Sarah and her team have created an environment where everyone can access invaluable resources and opportunities regardless of their background. Their dedication to breaking down the barriers that previously hindered aspiring board members like myself is truly commendable. One of the most astonishing aspects of Dynamic Boards is the wealth of advice and information they provide on their website. The step-by-step guidance they offer on the journey to becoming a board member is unparalleled. It's like having a trusted mentor by your side, helping you navigate the intricate path to the boardroom. What truly sets Dynamic Boards apart is their commitment to making board opportunities accessible without excessive costs, it's free! Before discovering this platform, I encountered opportunities that would have demanded a staggering ¬£4000 to ¬£6000 merely for access. Such financial barriers perpetuate an environment of exclusivity, shutting the door on diverse and talented individuals who could bring fresh perspectives to the board. #DynamicBoards #DiversityInLeadership #InclusiveBoardOpportunities #platformhousinggroup #thegneissway\n\nEven one of the greatest Managers that has ever lived lets top talent slip away. Insert Cole Palmer. With 20 goals this season so far‚Äîjust 10 shy of the entire Sheffield United team‚Äîand on par with Manchester City Football Club own Erling Haaland, Palmer‚Äôs prowess on the field is undeniable. Palmer's departure from Manchester City Football Club to Chelsea Football Club, despite displaying immense potential under Pep Guardiola, highlights a recurring challenge faced by Chief Product Officers: The delicate balance between retaining top talent and meeting immediate performance demands. In football, as in business, managers often gravitate towards established performers, sometimes side-lining emerging talents. Driven by the imperative of innovation, CPOs may prioritise short-term gains over nurturing internal talent. However, Guardiola's own commitment to youth development demonstrates that investing in the growth and retention of promising team members can yield long-term success in product innovation. Yet, Palmer's exit serves as a poignant reminder that even the best advocates of in-house talent, don't get it right 100% of the time. So, it begs the question: are CPOs providing ample opportunities for growth and development, or inadvertently side-lining their best players in pursuit of short-term wins? I'm eager to hear your thoughts. How can CPOs cultivate an environment where promising talents like Palmer can truly flourish? #productmanagement #CPO #Talent\n\n‚öΩÔ∏è England vs. Denmark: How to *Not* Bring it Home & fumble with the Best Talent.. What does it teach us about hiring? ‚öΩÔ∏è So, last night‚Äôs England game against Denmark was a bit like watching a bunch of highly skilled professionals forget how to do their jobs or like a Sunday league team after a night out.. We‚Äôve got some of the best players in the world, yet somehow, we managed to play like a group of strangers having an off day. Here‚Äôs what we can take away from that painfully average display: (besides a headache): 1. Talent Alone Isn‚Äôt Enough: We‚Äôve got brilliant players, but without the right environment, even the best can underperform. Companies, listen up: you can hire all the superstars you want, but if they‚Äôre not set up to succeed, it‚Äôs just wasted potential. If your office feels like a chaotic free-for-all, it might be time for a serious strategy overhaul. 2. Leadership... or Lack Thereof: Watching our manager‚Äôs expression was like seeing someone try to assemble IKEA furniture without the instructions. Great leadership is more than just having a fancy title‚Äîit‚Äôs about making the right decisions under pressure. If your company‚Äôs strategy seems to change with the wind, no wonder your team is struggling to keep up. 3. Teamwork Makes the Dream Work: Our boys looked like they‚Äôd met five minutes before kickoff. Just having talented individuals isn‚Äôt enough; they need to work together seamlessly. If your workplace feels more like a collection of lone wolves than a united pack, it‚Äôs time to invest in some serious team-building or new strategic leadership that can bring your A-listers and the squad players together as a well-oiled machine. So, for those thinking of a new job hunt, feeling like a superstar stuck in a team that just can‚Äôt get it together, remember‚Äîit won't just be you, it‚Äôs them too. The right environment and leadership can turn even the most talented individuals into champions or unrecognisable. And for those companies out there, if you‚Äôre struggling despite hiring the best, maybe it‚Äôs time to look in the mirror (or at your management playbook), don't be afraid to invest more in your strategic leadership to get more from less. As a recruiter, I‚Äôm here to help you find not just the best players, but the right team dynamics to finally start winning. Unfortunately, I can't help Gareth bring it home this Euros but I can assist with your market domination.. #Euro2024 #Recruitment #LeadershipFails #Teamwork #JobHunting #ComedyOfErrors #England\n\nYou absolutely can not get this wrong... üëá Our daily reminder in sports: ...and the WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) absolutely nailed it. Hiring decisions at the executive level are crucial to any organization's success. Cathy Engelbert became the league‚Äôs first commissioner in 2019 and, since that appointment, tremendous progress has been made. From corporate infrastructure to player support, major upgrades have been made on behalf of all W stakeholders. Some highlights: üèÄ 2020 Collective Bargaining Agreement - Improved player compensation by >50%; Improved player benefits and player care üèÄ WNBA Changemakers - A business collective designed to elevate player experience and enable the league‚Äôs business transformation (Nike, AT&T, Deloitte, Google, CarMax, U.S. Bank) üèÄ Chartered Flights - Teams will now travel private ‚Äì anxiety over commercial travel and the risks that came with it are now in the past Cathy Engelbert was the right choice at the right time. üìö First female CEO of a big four accounting firm (>300,000 employees) üë©üè´ First female Chair of the Catalyst Inc. Board (global non-profit promoting an inclusive workplace) üèÄ Basketball pedigree ‚Äì she played at Lehigh University for Hall of fame coach Muffet McGraw; her father played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Detroit Pistons under Hall of face coach Jack Ramsay There should be no uncertainty about her ability to lead the league through important upcoming inflection points to capitalize on the current momentum (media rights negotiations, new collective bargaining, potentially four new expansion teams). üìà In markets, companies are scrutinized over their leadership succession plans (i.e. ‚Äì Apple and Tim Cook or J.P. Morgan and Jamie Dimon). It‚Äôs obvious why. #WNBA #Leadership #SuccessionPlanning #SportsAdvisors\n\nSometimes, you will have to let people go, and it won't be their fault, but yours. And that's okay. I write this in the wake of something that Manchester United's newest manager, Erik Ten Haag did - he took 3 major decisions in less than a year. Something that two of his predecessors couldn't make. Even if you don't watch football regularly, you'll find that these are some pretty big changes: - convincing the club to sell the world's most popular player - replacing the existing goalkeeper with another who has vastly different style - replacing the captain What's surprising here is that most people: fans, journalists and analysts alike have been clamouring for these changes for months. It was public knowledge, yet none of the prior managers wished to take it due to fear of them proving to be wrong decisions. They were so concerned with their status and reputation that they neglected their duties as managers. Erik did nothing special. He was bold enough to act on 'obvious' matters and executed them in rapid succession. This not only allowed the club to shed it's baggage, but also enables it to reinvent itself for the new season. In addition to increasing morale within the club, this move has reinvigorated the fanbase, who've felt let down for a while now. It remains to be seen how these decisions will pan out, but what Erik did was a demonstration of that hallowed trait: 'bias for action'. As managers, especially those who are first-time managers, you will need to stop managing optics and start taking calls. You are most likely to make a few mistakes in the beginning, but over time, the pressures (and your intuition) will refine your decision-making to the point where you won't make major blunders. It's funny how it works: you need to make mistakes, so that you won't make mistakes in the future."
