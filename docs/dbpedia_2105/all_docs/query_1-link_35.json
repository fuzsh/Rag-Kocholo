        "text": "The rocky tidal flats are located in the west and north of the island. The hike begins at the point where the elevator or stairs from the lowlands meet. You stand on the street Am Falm and walk around to the left. On your left side you look over the houses of the lowlands and to the dune. About 40 m after you have passed the last house on the right side you will see the harbour facilities. On your right you will see the Berliner Bär, and a small staircase leads up to the Klippenweg. Here you go on, always a little bit uphill. On the right side a pyramid makes us think about Werner Karl Heisenberg, a German Nobel Prize winner. At the end you follow the path that leads from the Unterland to the Oberland via the connecting road. Leave the signal station on the right side and continue straight ahead towards the cliff. Follow the cliff edge path and you will see the rock tidal flat on the left side.\n\nYou leave the lighthouse on the right side. Now you only walk along the cliff edge path towards the north. Look out for the wild cliff cabbage on the rocky slopes.\n\nFrom the Lummenfelsen you have a good view over the rocky mudflats on the right and left along the coast. If you continue to follow the path, you will pass the very special rock formation - the Tall Anna on the northwest tip of the island.\n\nIf you continue to follow the cliff edge path - always along the coast, which is on your left - you can reach the lower land after about 220 m on a staircase to the left. If you continue walking, you will automatically pass the largest crater on Helgoland. One of the visible memories of the Second World War, caused by a 5,000 kg bomb. If you have turned off just after the Tall Anna and come across the Oberland in the middle, then follow the path straight on, leaving the spur road to a house on the left 60 m after the 90 degree bend and after another 20 m you will come to a crossroads. There you turn left. After 150 m the crater is on your left.\n\nContinue along the path in the direction of the settlement. After 150 m you come to a fork in the road. Continue walking along An der Sapskuhle along the catching garden, which was established in 1911 and has been developed further since then, until you reach the ornithological station after another 200 m (on the left side). At the crossing there is a public toilet opposite.\n\nAt the public toilet, go straight ahead towards the village. At the end of the street you will come to the cemetery wall. Turn right and you will see the building of the James Krüss School with the schoolyard on your right.\n\nIf you now go back about 20 m, you can go directly to the Nicolai Church and the cemetery. You are welcome to visit the church and leave the cemetery on the other side. If you cannot walk the steps, walk around the church without steps.\n\nWhen you have left the cemetery property you will see the entrance to the bunkers. From the bunker you continue along the church road. At the next crossing you cannot miss the mulberry tree. If you follow the street to the end, you will come across the Falmmauer again. Turn right until you reach the elevator or stairs again."
