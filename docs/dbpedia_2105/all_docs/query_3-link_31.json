        "text": "Study places\n\nWe evaluated vertical and horizontal patterns in rocky intertidal community structure in July–August 2008 on 3 shores on Helgoland Island, which is located off the coast of mainland Germany, NE Atlantic ( ): Bunker (54° 11′ 32″ N, 7° 52′ 35″ E), Kringel (54°10′ 60″ N, 7° 53′ 15″ E), and Nord-Ost-Hafen (54° 11′ 00″ N, 7° 53′ 34″ E). Our research adheres to the legal requirements of the Schleswig-Holstein state act of 24 April 1981 (classification number 791-4-37) that declared Helgoland Island a nature reserve and allows ecologists to access sites to accomplish field research.\n\nA nested sampling design was employed. On each of the 3 study shores, we randomly established 3 sites that were spaced 5–10 m from one another following the shoreline. Within each site, we randomly established 2 patches that were spaced a few m from one another. At each patch, we randomly deployed three 25 cm×25 cm quadrats that were spaced a few 10s of cm from one another at each of 3 intertidal elevations (low, middle, and high intertidal zones).\n\nOn each shore, we surveyed the full vertical range of elevation between 0 m and an upper intertidal boundary determined using ecological indicators. On marine shores, waves during high tides wash the substrate at higher elevations than the high-water level indicated by tide tables (which provide predictions for still-water conditions). Thus, the regular occurrence of wave action expands the vertical range where sessile organisms can live, so different elevation zones (high, middle, and low) are wider and higher as wave exposure increases [30]. Because of that, to compare community structure from areas with a given degree of emersion-related stresses occurring on shores differing in wave exposure, community measurements must be done on each shore at elevations that account for the local effects of waves as described above. The sessile, perennial species occurring highest on the shore under all wave exposures in a given region are excellent indicators of the upper intertidal boundary, because their upper distribution limit on different shores represents a summary of the local wave regime. As the upper intertidal boundary for our study shores, we used the upper distribution limit of the brown seaweed Fucus spiralis, because this is the sessile, perennial species occurring highest on the 3 shores. Once the upper boundary was determined on each shore, we divided the intertidal range in three zones of equal vertical extent (high, middle, and low zones). We took all elevation measurements to the nearest cm using a theodolite and a tide pole. All boundaries were permanently marked with screws bolted to the rocky substrate. The upper intertidal boundary was 2.3 m at Bunker, 1.8 m at Kringel, and 2.0 m at Nord-Ost-Hafen.\n\nData analysis\n\nTo reveal spatial patterns in community structure on the studied shores, we used canonical analysis on principal coordinates (CAP), [38]. Constrained multivariate methods such as CAP use an a priori hypothesis to produce an ordination plot, so they allow one to detect patterns that could be masked by overall dispersion in unconstrained methods such as multidimensional scaling. We generated CAP ordination plots for each shore on the basis of a matrix of factors (elevation, patch, and site) fitted to a matrix of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. We assessed the significance of fits with 1000 permutations.\n\nIn nested designs, sampling effort (and thus statistical power) increases lower in the hierarchy of scales, which prevents a direct comparison of the magnitude of variation among the different scales though hierarchical analysis of variance [28]. Thus, to test our main hypothesis, we used an alternative type of analysis of variance described by Underwood and Chapman [39] and Benedetti-Cecchi [28], for which we obtained independent estimates of vertical and horizontal variation from different subsets of quadrats pooled at the appropriate spatial scales to keep a constant intensity of sampling across scales.\n\nTo measure vertical and horizontal variation in community structure, we used PERMANOVA based on Bray-Curtis distances between pairs of quadrats [40]. This multivariate technique tested for the effects of elevation (3 levels: high, middle, and low) on community structure using the abundance data for all species from a selected set of quadrats depending on the scale of interest. In PERMANOVA, the total multivariate variance (i.e. pseudo-variance) is partitioned into mean squares due to the factor of interest (elevation) and the residual or error mean squares [41]. We estimated the multivariate pseudo-variance component for elevation by equating the observed mean squares of the elevation factor to the expected mean squares derived from the linear model: (MSelevations – MSresidual)/n [42], where n was the number of replicate quadrats within each elevation. The MSresidual thus corresponded to the pseudo-variance component for horizontal variation. We applied PERMANOVA to measure horizontal variation at the different desired scales (different sampling intervals) in the way explained below.\n\nTo measure vertical variation in community structure across the three elevation zones and horizontal variation at the patch scale (variation among quadrats 10s of cm apart within patches), we randomly selected one site from each shore. We used one-way PERMANOVAs separately for each available patch to measure variation. Six patches were available for this analysis (3 shores ×1 site selected per shore ×2 available patches per site), yielding 6 independent estimates of vertical variation and 6 estimates of horizontal variation at the patch scale.\n\nTo measure horizontal variation at the site scale (variation among quadrats a few m apart within sites), we randomly selected another site from each shore. For each elevation zone within each site, we pooled the quadrats from both patches and, then, randomly divided the resulting 6 quadrats into 2 groups of 3 quadrats each. For each site, we then generated 2 data sets, each one including species abundance data from 3 quadrats from each elevation zone. We then applied one-way PERMANOVAs separately to each data set to generate 2 measures of horizontal variability for each site using the residual mean squares. In this case, horizontal variability measured variation within patches plus the variation between patches within sites. Six data sets were available for this analysis (3 shores ×1 site selected per shore ×2 modified sets of quadrats within each site), yielding 6 estimates of horizontal variation at the site scale.\n\nTo measure horizontal variation at the shore scale (variation among quadrats 100s to 1000s of m apart), we used the abundance data from the remaining site within each shore. First, we pooled the quadrats from each elevation zone across the 3 shores. Then, we randomly divided the resulting 18 quadrats into 6 groups of 3 quadrats each. We then randomly generated 6 data sets, each one including abundance data from 3 quadrats from each elevation zone. After applying one-way PERMANOVAs separately to those data sets, we obtained 6 measures of horizontal variation using the residual mean squares. In this case, horizontal variability measured variation within patches plus variation between patches within sites plus variation among shores.\n\nWe also calculated univariate variance components based on the abundance of the taxa contributing most to the spatial variation in community structure, for which we used the quadrat grouping procedure described above for the multivariate approach. For the univariate analyses, we used one-way ANOVAs to obtain estimators of variance. When negative variance components (either multivariate or univariate) were obtained for any scale, we set them to zero under the assumption that they were sample underestimates of small or zero variances [28], [43]. We calculated the contribution of each taxon to the spatial variation in community structure with Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) routines. In this procedure, we calculated Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values among replicate plots, between groups, and within groups in the entire dataset of species percent covers. The average between-group dissimilarities were then broken down into separate contributions from each taxon [44]. Species contributions were calculated separately for the factors elevation, patch, site, and shore.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that vertical variation in community structure is larger than fine-scale horizontal variation but smaller that broad-scale horizontal variation by applying a one-way ANOVA to the multivariate pseudo-variance component data obtained as explained above for each scale. In a similar way, we tested the same hypothesis for the variance component data of the taxa with highest contributions to the spatial variation in community structure. We considered “type of variation” as a fixed factor with 4 levels: vertical variation and patch, site, and shore-scale horizontal variation. We confirmed the homoscedasticity assumption by running Levene's tests after graphical exploration of residuals vs. fitted values and log10(y + 1) or square-root transformation of the data. After significant differences among treatments were detected by the ANOVA, we ran Dunnett's tests to evaluate the significance of pairwise differences. We considered Dunnett's test appropriate for our goals because this test compares each group against a “control” group, which in this case corresponded to the vertical variation. SIMPER routines were conducted with PRIMER v6. We did all other statistical analyses and ordinations with R environment version 2.12.2 [45]. We used the vegan package to compute the CAP ordinations and PERMANOVAs, the stats package to compute the one-way ANOVAs, and the multcomp package to compute Dunnett's tests."
