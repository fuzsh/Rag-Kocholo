        "text": "recruits are constantly arriving at the Heligoland\n\ndÃ©pÃ´t, where a considerable number are\n\nstill being trained and organised, and where\n\nthey are behaving themselves so well\n\nthat the fashionable world of the Hanse\n\ntowns, although a little frightened at first\n\nare again flocking to their favourite dot in\n\nthe ocean for their annual sea-dips in it.\n\nThe history of Heligoland is very simple.\n\nIn the fourteenth century the Danes had\n\nestablished a fort there ; then, its only church\n\npaid a quit-rent to the chapter of Schleswig.\n\nAfterwards Hamburg exercised over it the\n\nsimultaneous rights of lordship and\n\nprotectorate ; and, a desperate quarrel about\n\nherrings, ended in its being bombarded and\n\ntaken by Denmark ; but, in eighteen hundred\n\nand seven, it was taken by the English.\n\nFor many years Major-Geueral Sir Henry\n\nKing reigned over Heligoland as governor.\n\nOn this high functionary devolved the\n\nsurveillance of the island and its lighthouse,\n\nbesides the office of judge and umpire over\n\nthe internal disputes of the inhabitants. The\n\npresent ruler is Sir John Hindmarsh,\n\nnecessarily a captain in the navy, to preside\n\nover this extraordinarily marine bit of\n\nterritory. While the continental blockade lasted,\n\nHeligoland was of inestimable value to\n\nEngland as a convenient warehouse for smuggling.\n\nThis molecule in the midst of the waters\n\nis two thousand two hundred paces long, six\n\nhundred and fifty broad at the widest part,\n\nand some five thousand yards, or thereabouts,\n\nin circumference. It will be supposed that\n\nrailroads are things uncalled for ; nay, even\n\nthat coaches-and-six, tandems, dog-carts, and\n\nhigh-mettled racers, are not in high request.\n\nThe island may contain a sedan-chair, or\n\nvinaigrette, for fashionable ladies ; but the actual\n\nexistence of such a vehicle the deponent had\n\nrather not affirm on oath. A hop-skip-and-jump\n\ntour of her Majesty's tight little island,\n\nis not an impossibility ; and an intellectual\n\nflea, or a literary gnat, may one day give to\n\nthe impatient world a nice little volume,\n\nwith map and woodcuts, entitled, \"Travels\n\nin Heligoland.\"\n\nOn approaching the island from Hamburg,\n\nit looks like a triangular rock surrounded by\n\nthe sea on every side. The colours it presents\n\nhave been transferred to the flag it has\n\nhad the modesty to set up; which is red,\n\nwhite, and green; and Heligoland has not\n\nonly a national flag, but a national minstrelsy.\n\nHere is a refrain apropos to both:\n\nRoth ist der Strand,\n\nWeiss ist der Sand,\n\nGrÃ¼n ist die Kant;\n\nDas sind die Farben von Helgoland.\n\nwhich, translated, may be rendered:\n\nRed is the strand,\n\nWhite is the sand,\n\nGreen is the band;\n\nThose are the colours of Heligoland.\n\nTo the south-east, only a little morsel\n\nof level ground ia perceptible — a tiny\n\ntongue of land, which is dignified by the\n\ntitle of The Unterland or Lowlands, and\n\nwhich rises gradually to the foot of the\n\nrock to about five-and- twenty feet above the\n\nlevel of the sea. On this stands the lower\n\ntown, composed of something like eighty\n\nhouses. In a gorge of the rock is a new\n\nstaircase, which connects it with the Oberland\n\nor Highlands. This staircase, decorated\n\nwith a smart iron railing, is ten feet\n\nwide, is composed of one hundred and seventy-\n\nthree wooden steps divided into three revolutions,\n\nat the bottom of each of which are\n\nseats to rest upon, and oil lamps to show\n\nlight on winter nights. After this, do not\n\nboast of the luxury of London and Paris!\n\nOn the summit of the rock, towards the\n\nnorth-east, stands the Upper Town, with\n\nabout three hundred and twenty houses, and\n\na church dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the\n\npatron of fishermen and babies (whether\n\npickled or fresh). From this point the rock\n\nstill rises, till it attains the Alpine elevation\n\nof a hundred and ninety feet above the\n\nlevel of the sea. Not far off (nothing is\n\nfar off here) stands the light-house, erected\n\nby the English with no other materials\n\nthan stone, iron, and copper. Its rays\n\ncommand an extensive horizon, notifying dis-\n\ntinctly to the wave-tossed traveller, \" This\n\nis I!—Heligoland, who shine so bright.\n\nPursue your way, by the help of my luminous\n\nfinger-post.\" But a beacon is an old\n\nestablishment in Heligoland. In sixteen hundred\n\nand seventy-three, the Hamburgians built a\n\npharos on the eminence called the Backeberg,\n\nwherein they kept up a cheerful coal-fire,\n\nsometimes burning, daring winter nights, as\n\nmuch as four hundred pounds of coal.\n\nDo not suppose that the continent of\n\nHeligoland is so poor as to be without its\n\ndependent islet, — a faithful satellite who never\n\ndeserts it. Rather better than half-a-mile\n\nfrom Heligoland, on the south-east side, is\n\nSandy Island, which is of the greatest\n\nconsequence to the tight little mother country,\n\nbecause on that are taken the sea-baths,\n\nwhich put a considerable revenue into\n\nHeligoland's pockets."
