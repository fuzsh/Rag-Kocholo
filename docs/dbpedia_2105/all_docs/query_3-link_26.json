        "text": "\"Eighteen thousand years ago, the seas around northern Europe were some 400 feet lower than today. Britain was not an island but the uninhabited northwest corner of Europe, and between it and the rest of the continent stretched frozen tundra. As the world warmed and the ice receded, deer, aurochs, and wild boar headed northward and westward. The hunters followed. Coming off the uplands of what is now continental Europe, they found themselves in a vast, low-lying plain.\"[1]\n\n\"Doggerland is now believed to have been settled by Mesolithic people, probably in large numbers, until they were forced out of it thousands of years later by the relentlessly rising sea. A period of climatic and social upheaval ensued until, by the end of the Mesolithic, Europe had lost a substantial portion of its landmass and looked much as it does today.\"[1]\n\n\"Based on seismic survey data gathered mostly by oil companies prospecting under the North Sea, [...] the contours [...] translate into gently rolling hills, wooded valleys, lush marshes, and lagoons.\"[1]\n\n\"In addition to the human jawbone, [there are] accumulated more than a hundred other artifacts —animal bones showing signs of butchery and tools made from bone and antler, among them an ax decorated with a zigzag pattern. Because [there are] coordinates of these finds, and because objects on the seabed tend not to move far from where erosion liberates them, [...] many come from a specific area of the southern North Sea that the Dutch call De Stekels (the Spines), characterized by steep seabed ridges.\"[1]\n\n\"The most rapid rises of sea level were on the order of three to six feet a century, but because of the variable topography of the land, the flooding would not have been even. In areas as flat as modern-day East Anglia, a six-foot rise could have shifted the coast inland by miles; in hillier places, less. Down in low-lying Doggerland, the rising sea turned inland lakes into estuaries.\"[1]\n\n“There would have been huge population shifts. People who were living out in what is now the North Sea would have been displaced very quickly.”[2]\n\nNorthwest Britain\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"Local Bathymetry and ocean currents [include in the image on the right] LSW:Labrador Sea Water; NADW:North Atlantic Deep Water; NSOW:Norwegian Sea Overflow Water).\"[3]\n\n\"Sediments near the top of the Ling Bank Formation at its type locality have been correlated with ‘type’ Holsteinian sections in Denmark and Germany (Knudsen and Sejrup, 1993). However, it is still widely believed that marine Holsteinian deposits, in general, directly overlie the major erosion surface at the top of the Aberdeen Ground Formation (P915281). There was, therefore, a widespread glaciation during the Elsterian stage, which involved ice flowing from Scandinavia into the southern North Sea (Cameron et al., 1992) and extending to the continental shelf edge north-west of Scotland (Stoker et al., 1994).\"[4]\n\n\"In the northern North Sea and on the West Shetland Shelf a widespread surface of marine erosion has been correlated with the OIS 4/3 boundary. It is overlain by the mainly arctic marine Cape Shore Formation, which is securely placed in the Middle Weichselian on several lines of evidence (Johnson et al., 1993; Skinner et al., 1986; Sejrup et al., 1994; Holmes, 1997). Thus the seas to the north and west of Scotland were also free of glacier ice during this stage and perhaps much of the Scottish mainland.\"[4]\n\n\"At Clava, near Inverness, rafts of highboreal to low-arctic shallow marine mud originally deposited in Loch Ness, then a fjord, are probably early to middle Devensian in age (Merritt, 1992). The deposits correlate with those of the Bø Interstadial in Norway on amino-acid dating evidence (P915290). Rafts of broadly similar age have been located at the Boyne Limestone Quarry, King Edward and Gardenstown sites.\"[4]\n\nAn \"ice sheet [may have] extended to the continental shelf break, and beyond, to the north and west of Scotland (Holmes, 1991; Stoker and Holmes, 1991; Stoker et al., 1993; P915288). The resultant sediments are correlated on the basis of regional seismostratigraphy with Late Weichselian (OIS 2) deposits in the northern North Sea (Johnson et al., 1993). A radiocarbon date of about 22.5 ka BP from glaciomarine deposits within the limit of glaciation on the outer shelf to the west of St Kilda (Selby, 1989) appears to be consistent with the Late Devensian glacial maximum predating 18 ka BP (P915288).\"[4]\n\n\"Warm North Atlantic waters did not reach the north-east Atlantic and western Scotland until about 13 ka BP, when conditions changed from high arctic to boreal possibly in less than 50 years (Kroon et al., 1987; Peacock and Harkness, 1990).\"[4]\n\n\"The return of warm North Atlantic Drift waters to the Scottish seas occurred within a few decades just prior to 10,100 BP (Peacock and Harkness, 1990). At first sea temperatures were 2 to 3° lower than those of the present day, but a warming occurred at about 9600 BP.\"[4]\n\nMain articles: Geochronology/Stratigraphy and Stratigraphy\n\nMost \"of the southern North Sea was low-lying land like the Netherlands until the first major glaciation. Moraines are preserved at the shelf-edge north-west of mainland Scotland, more than 60 km west of the nearest coastline (Holmes et al., 1993; Stoker et al., 1993). Conversely, marine deposits are preserved more than 10 km inland from the modern coastline at the head of the Moray Firth and at least 6 km inland near Elgin.\"[4]\n\n\"At least five major glacial episodes have been recognised in the North Sea basin, within a sequence that is dominanted by deltaic, low salinity cold-water marine and glaciomarine conditions (Sutherland, 1984a). The thickest and most complete sequence (more than 500 m) is preserved in the Central Graben of the North Sea, which has subsided tectonically throughout the Quaternary. At least ten till units are present within the Norwegian Channel with six or seven extending to the distal shelf break (Sejrup et al., 2000).\"[4]\n\nScottish Highlands\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"To the north and west of 58°N 01°E, the unconformity is interpreted from 3-D seismic evidence to take the form of fluvial channels. These features merge downslope into furrowed surfaces like those known to have been produced by grounded icebergs or sea-ice keels (Holmes, 1997). This evidence for ice scour within the Aberdeen Ground Formation is reinforced by the occurrence of periodic ice-rafted debris in sequences of equivalent age on the Atlantic margins off north-west Scotland (Stoker et al., 1994). Hence, the Scottish Highlands were probably glaciated to some extent during the colder stages of the Early Quaternary before 1.2 Ma.\"[4]\n\n\"The oldest known glacial deposits laid down offshore by ice flowing from the Scottish Highlands have been found in boreholes in the Forth Approaches and the Moray Firth (Stoker and Bent, 1985; Bent, 1986). There, towards the top of the Aberdeen Ground Formation, glaciomarine sediments laid down by a grounded ice sheet occur in the west, with the facies becoming increasingly more distal to the east. The deposits lie immediately above the Brunhes–Matuyama palaeomagnetic boundary (P915280; P915341) suggesting that the glaciation occurred in OIS 18, within the Cromerian Complex.\"[4]\n\nNorthern North Sea\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"In the northern North Sea, the Shackleton Formation (Johnson et al., 1993) [Early Quaternary glaciations (1.2 to 0.78 Ma)] includes an erosion surface that separates sand-rich sediments below from mud-rich sediments above. The incoming of mud-rich sediments is reflected by a change of acoustic facies that is tentatively attributed by Johnson et al. (1993) to the first impact of regional glaciation [Menapian/Bavelian, see image in Stratigraphy] on the depositional environment of the northern North Sea.\"[4]\n\nOn \"the basis of seismostratigraphical correlation, it predates the 1.07 to 0.99 Ma Jaramillo Subchron (P915280), which has been reported from the overlying Mariner Formation (Stoker et al., 1983; compare with Skinner et al., 1986).\"[4]\n\nEvidence occurs \"in the Troll region of the Norwegian Channel for the ‘Fedje Glaciation’, which postdates the 1.19 Ma Cobb Mountain Event within the Matuyama Reversed Polarity Chron (Funnell, 1995; P915341). On the basis of the micropalaeontology, Sr-isotopes, palaeomagnetism and amino-acid geochronology, this glaciation has been assigned an age close to 1.1 Myr (Sejrup et al., 1995).\"[4]\n\n\"The presence of the diamicton, the geometry of the reflector and other evidence have been put forward as evidence of shelf glaciation extending from Norway across the northern North Sea to areas west of Shetland (Holmes, 1997).\"[4]\n\n\"The earliest evidence for glaciation of the sea bed offshore from north-east Scotland occurs in the Fladen area of the central North Sea where a 10 m-thick unit of diamicton lies just above the Jaramillo Subchron within the Aberdeen Ground Formation. As the diamicton is overlain by sediment containing microfossils with an interglacial aspect provisionally correlated with the Leerdam Netherlands Pollen Stage, Sejrup et al. (1987) place the glacial event within the Bavelian Complex, between 800 and 900 ka.\"[4]\n\n\"Evidence for Saalian glaciations off north-east Scotland occurs in the Fisher and Coal Pit formations. The predominantly arctic glaciomarine Fisher Formation rests on a major, gently undulating unconformity that cuts across (onlaps) the Ling Bank and Aberdeen Ground formations (P915280, P915281). The unconformity results from a marine transgression and the overlying Fisher Formation is thought to be no older than OIS 7 (Jensen and Knudsen, 1988; Holmes, 1997). A till has been identified within the Fisher Formation (Sejrup et al., 1987) and contemporaneous subglacial erosion is thought to have occurred to the north of 58.6°N in the Moray Firth (Bent, 1986). The top of the Fisher Formation is defined by another regional unconformity, but unlike the one at its base, this one is typically crenulate (P915281) and is believed to be the result of the Saalian glaciation (Gatliff et al., 1994). The channels are mainly infilled with glaciomarine deposits belonging to the overlying Coal Pit Formation (Sejrup et al., 1987), although some fragmentary beds deposited in warmer waters have been identified within the formation in the northern and central North Sea (Gatliff et al., 1994).\"[4]\n\n\"The glaciomarine basal deposits of the Coal Pit Formation are succeeded by marine sediments containing foraminiferal assemblages typical of the Eemian–Ipswichian Interglacial (Cameron et al., 1987). These in turn underlie a horizon that has been correlated with the palaeomagnetic Blake Event at the OIS 5e/5d boundary (Stoker et al., 1985).\"[4]\n\nIce \"flowing from the mainland affected the northern North Sea at least as far south as 56°N (Sutherland and Gordon, 1993) and it reached the shelf break to the north-west of Scotland (Skinner et al., 1986; Stevenson, 1991; Holmes, 1997).\"[4]\n\n\"The Wee Bankie Formation (Stoker et al., 1985) lies directly off the east coast of Scotland. It has a sheet-like geometry with an uneven, ridged top and comprises up to 40 m of stiff, matrix-dominated diamicton with some interbeds of sand, pebbly sand and silty clay.\"[4]\n\n\"The Wee Bankie Formation is replaced eastwards by the Marr Bank Formation, commonly at a low, eastward-facing scarp interpreted as a former ice-contact slope, but the two formations probably interdigitate locally (Stoker et al., 1985). The Marr Bank Formation consists mostly of sands and muddy sands of Scottish provenance with a sparse microfauna indicative of shallow, high boreal to arctic waters. It forms a sheet-like deposit up to 25 m thick resting on an extensive surface of marine planation dipping north-eastwards (Holmes, 1977). As it is traced eastwards, the basal reflector of the Marr Bank Formation becomes acoustically indistinguishable from the upper part of the adjacent Coal Pit Formation, and the two formations probably pass laterally into one another locally (Gatliff et al., 1994).\"[4]\n\n\"Much of the northern North Sea north of 58°N had been deglaciated by 16 to 14 ka BP, and was either subaerially exposed or inundated by a very shallow sea (Peacock, 1995). This is compatible with a maximum age of about 14.1 ka BP for the onset of glaciomarine sedimentation following retreat of ice from the Witch Ground area (P915291; Sejrup et al., 1994) and at about 15 ka BP in the Norwegian Channel (Sejrup et al., 1995). The onset of deglaciation on the Hebridean Shelf has been dated to about 15.2 ka BP, predating the onset of warming in the North Atlantic (Peacock et al., 1992; Austin and Kroon, 1996). Shells within glaciomarine sediments occurring onshore near Peterhead have yielded ages of about 14.3 and 14.9 ka BP (St Fergus).\"[4]\n\n\"Radiocarbon dates from Portlandia arctica Gray, a high arctic marine bivalve, indicate that polar water, and probably seasonal sea-ice, remained in the northern North Sea until at least 13.2 to 13.1 ka BP when warmer waters arrived. Glaciomarine and estuarine silts and clays of the Errol Formation accumulated along the coasts (Peacock, 1999), while the muddy St Abbs Formation was laid down in this polar sea off the eastern coast of Scotland (Stoker et al., 1985; P915281).\"[4]\n\n\"A record of the Windermere Interstadial is probably contained within the Swatchway Formation, which occurs to the north-east of Buchan (P915281). It comprises shelly muds and sands with a mixed northern temperate to arctic microfauna (Stoker et al., 1985; Harland, 1988). It occurs more certainly in the Largo Bay Member of the Forth Formation, which is more widespread off north-east Scotland (Stoker et al., 1985; P915281). It includes up to 30 m of silty muds that become coarser grained and pebbly upwards with concomitant decreasing faunal diversity. The trends probably reflect lowering sea level and cooling seas towards the onset of the Loch Lomond Stadial. The overlying St Andrews Member was laid down as coastal sand bars in a very shallow sea during the subsequent Loch Lomond Stadial. High arctic marine fauna returned during the stadial, during which nearshore marine summer temperatures were approaching 10° below present levels (Graham et al., 1990; Peacock, 1996).\"[4]\n\nCentral North Sea\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"A record of the Eemian (Ipswichian) is contained within the central part of the Coal Pit Formation, which fills channels that were probably eroded during, or immediately after, the Saalian glaciation in the Moray Firth and central North Sea (Andrews et al., 1990; Gatliff et al., 1994; P915281).\"[4]\n\n\"In southern Norway, the Eemian is now thought to have been succeeded by a prolonged period of interstadial conditions with restricted mountain glaciation (Sejrup et al., 2000).\"[4]\n\nAn \"ice stream occupied the Norwegian Channel after 80 ka, suggesting that a regional glaciation occurred equivalent to the Karmoy Glaciation established in south-west Fennoscandia (P915290). Micromorphological studies of sediments from several boreholes in the central North Sea also suggest regional glaciation at that time involving coalescing Scottish and Scandinavian ice sheets (Carr, 1998).\"[4]\n\n\"The Coal Pit Formation in the central North Sea includes a sequence of shelly glaciomarine clays that have been placed tentatively in OIS 3 on palaeomagnetic evidence (Stoker et al., 1985) indicating that this area was free of glacier ice during this stage.\"[4]\n\n\"In the central North Sea, the lower part of the Swatchway Formation, at Borehole 77/2 (P915291), is formed mainly of glaciomarine sediments from which AMS radiocarbon dates of 22.7, 20.9 and 19.7 ka BP have been obtained on in situ mollusc and benthic foraminiferids (Sejrup et al., 1994). This evidence suggests that the area was free of grounded ice during that period. However, a diamicton underlying the glaciomarine deposits in that borehole is interpreted as a till (Sejrup et al., 1994). It contains reworked arctic benthic foraminiferids that have provided a maximum AMS radiocarbon age of 42.3 ka BP. The diamicton rests on cold marine deposits assigned to the Ålesund Interstadial of north-west Fennoscandia and it is concluded by Sejrup et al. (1994) that the till was laid down between 28 ka BP and 22 ka BP during an initial, maximal stage of the Late Devensian glaciation.\"[4]\n\nThe \"central North Sea was also glaciated in the previous Skjonghelleren Glaciation of Fennoscandia, between about 50 and 40 ka BP (P915290).\"[4]\n\nThe \"Scottish and Scandinavian ice sheets reached their maximum extent in the Late Devensian prior to about 22 ka BP and that they very probably coalesced (P915288). At least the uppermost part of the Wee Bankie Formation postdates this early phase. Following retreat to an unknown position at about 20 ka BP, during the Hamnsund Interstadial of Norway (Valen et al., 1996), the Scottish ice sheet probably then re-advanced to the eastern boundaries of the ‘Bosies Bank Moraine’ (Bent, 1986; P915291). This event probably equates with the Tampen Glaciation of Norway, when ice re-advanced onto the shelf and an ice stream reoccupied the Norwegian Channel (Sejrup et al., 2000; P915290).\"[4]\n\nSouthern North Sea\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"The top of the Aberdeen Ground Formation is cut by a succession of isolated, anastomosing and locally stacked channels, some of which may have been formed as sub-glacial or ice-marginal ‘tunnel’ valleys. The channels, together with the oldest units of sediment contained within them (Ling Bank Formation), have been correlated on the basis of regional seismostratigraphy with the widespread Elsterian glaciation of the north-west European mainland (Stoker et al., 1985; Cameron et al., 1987).\"[4]\n\n\"The channelled surfaces at the top of the Aberdeen Ground Formation may well have formed in more than one glacial cycle, including the severe Cromerian glaciation of OIS 16 (Holmes, 1997). It follows that the first major interruption of the growth of deltas across the southern North Sea may have occurred in the Cromerian and not the Elsterian as commonly believed (P915341).\"[4]\n\nWadden Sea\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"The area presents the world’s largest coherent intertidal flats: 4700 km2 emerge during low tide.\"[5]\n\n\"The Wadden Sea extends roughly 500 km along the southeast coast of the North Sea from Den Helder in The Netherlands to Blåvands Huk in Denmark [see the image on the right]. A large part of the intertidal area is sheltered by barrier islands and sand bars against the surf of the North Sea.\"[5]\n\n\"The total area of the islands is about 2000 km2 and the Wadden Sea itself covers about 8000 km2.\"[5]\n\n\"Some 18,000 years ago, at the last glacial maximum, the sea-level in the region was about 125 m lower than it is today (Streif, 2004). In contrast with the previous Saale glaciation, the region was not covered with ice during this Weichselian glaciation. The Pleistocene landscape of the Wadden Sea Region has been formed both by glacial processes e.g. in the form of terminal moraines and by glaciofluvial processes e.g. in the form of outwash plains formed by the melting water from the Weichselian ice sheet. Some of the 16 present barrier islands have developed attached to local heights in the Pleistocene landscape. The islands Texel (The Netherlands), Amrum, Föhr and Sylt (Germany) have outcrops of Pleistocene sediments.\"[5]\n\n\"After the last Ice Age, melting of the Fennoscandian and Canadian ice shields caused the sea-level to rise rapidly. Initially, the rate of sea-level rise was too high to allow the formation of a barrier island system. Although there are some indications that the first barrier islands formed approximately 8000 years BP it was primarily when the rate of sea-level rise decreased to well below 10 mm/y that the present-day landscape started to form (Streif, 2004). From 5000 BP the sea-level rise slowed to 1e2 mm per annum, and crustal adjustments in response to the unloading of the ice pressure in Scandinavia caused the land in the Wadden Sea Region to sink gradually by about 1 mm per year (Vink et al., 2007). At the start of the formation of the Wadden Sea system much of the sediment forming the Wadden Islands originated from the bottom of the newly inundated North Sea. In the later development of the barrier islands the longshore sediment transport also played an important role.\"[5]\n\nThe Dollart Bay was created by a catastrophic storm surge in 1277,[6] covering the district of Reiderland and large parts of the Oldambt district. The flood inundated 43 parishes, and is estimated to have caused 80,000 deaths.[7] Another storm surge in 1509 further extended the Dollart, flooding 30 more villages,[8] and by 1520 the Dollart had its largest extension.\n\nThe recent history period dates from around 1,000 b2k to present.\n\nHeligoland is a small archipelago in the North Sea.[9] A part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein since 1890, the islands were historically possessions of Denmark, then became the possessions of the United Kingdom from 1807 to 1890, and briefly managed as a war prize from 1945 to 1952.\n\nThe islands are located in the Heligoland Bight (part of the German Bight) in the southeastern corner of the North Sea. They are the only German islands not in the vicinity of the mainland. They lie approximately 69 kilometres (43 miles) by sea from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe.\n\nThe German Bight and the area around the island are known to have been inhabited since prehistoric times. Flint tools have been recovered from the bottom of the sea surrounding Heligoland. On the Oberland, prehistoric burial mounds were visible until the late 19th century, and excavations showed skeletons and artifacts. Moreover, prehistoric copper plates have been found under water near the island; those plates were almost certainly made on the Oberland.[10]\n\nThe island of Heligoland is a geological oddity; the presence of the main island's characteristic red sedimentary rock in the middle of the German Bight is unusual. It is the only such formation of cliffs along the continental coast of the North Sea. The formation itself, called the Bunter sandstone or Buntsandstein, is from the early Triassic geologic age. It is older than the white chalk that underlies the island Düne, the same rock that forms the white cliffs of Dover in England and cliffs of Danish and German islands in the Baltic Sea. In fact, a small chalk rock close to Heligoland, called witt Kliff[11] (white cliff), is known to have existed within sight of the island to the west until the early 18th century, when storm floods finally eroded it to below sea level.\n\nHeligoland's rock is significantly harder than the postglacial sediments and sands forming the islands and coastlines to the east of the island. This is why the core of the island, which a thousand years ago was still surrounded by a large, low-lying marshland and sand dunes separated from coast in the east only by narrow channels, has remained to this day, although the onset of the North Sea has long eroded away all of its surroundings. A small piece of Heligoland's sand dunes remains—the sand isle just across the harbour called Düne (Dune). A referendum in June 2011 dismissed a proposal to reconnect the main island to the Düne islet with a landfill.[12]\n\n\"Today [14 August 2008], Helgoland is a small rocky island with an exposed rocky shore located in the German Bight (SE North Sea).\"[13]\n\n\"Old maps show that only 1200 years ago [808 AD, 1192 b2k] Helgoland was much larger and muddy tidal flats surrounded the island.\"[13]\n\n\"This study is based on 1 cm-resolution granulometric data of 5 sediment cores (5 m core length, covering the past millennium) taken from the west, the center, and the east of the HMA, data of a parametric subbottom profiler, a RoxAnn seafloor-classification system, and AMS radiocarbon data.\"[13]\n\n\"In order to detect the source of the fine sediments in a likewise classical sandy North-Sea environment, morphologic features such as the adjacent \"Helgoland Hole\" west of the HMA that exceeds the ambient water depth by 100%, and the sediment geometries as revealed by shallow seismics were studied. In many transects shot with the SES2000 parametric echosounder, vertically interrupted layers suggest gas in the sediment that locally extends up to the surface. Transects from the SW of the working area reveal north-inclined layers suggesting sediment discharge from the south, which would also explain why the \"Helgoland Hole\" is still an open depression. Transects from the southern part of the HMA show large sandwaves that likely were buried and fossilized during a dramatic discharge of sediment. All evidence including the general water-mass circulation in this part of the North Sea thus points to a southern rather than a northern (i.e. former mud flats of Helgoland) source for the muddy sediments. It is concluded that the sediment that fills the HMA originated mostly from rivers such as the Elbe, and the Wadden Sea. Variations in grain size are due to fluctuations in the predominant wind direction and speed, and due to anthropogenic action such as dike-construction measures during the past centuries.\"[13]\n\nGerman Bight\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe German Bight, sometimes called the German Bay, is the southeastern bight of the North Sea bounded by the Netherlands and Germany to the south, and Denmark and Germany to the east (the Jutland peninsula). To the north and west is the Dogger Bank.\n\nThe Bight contains the Frisian and Danish Wadden Sea Islands. The Wadden Sea is approximately ten to twelve kilometres wide at the location of the German Bight.[14] The Frisian islands and the nearby coastal areas are collectively known as Frisia. The southern portion of the bight is also known as the Heligoland Bight. Between 1949 and 1956 the BBC Sea Area Forecast (Shipping Forecast) used \"Heligoland\" as the designation for the area now referred to as German Bight.\n\nRoskilde Fjords\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe \"Blytt-Sernander climatic zones [Boreal (dry), Atlantic (humid), Subboreal (dry and warm) and Subatlantic (humid and cool), with the Atlantic period divided in two zones the Early Atlantic Period and the Full Atlantic Period (Jessen 1937, Jørgensen 1963)] show up clearly in the lithology (chemical analysis) of the marine core (RF6). Furthermore, the lithological changes are synchronous with the shift in pollen zones. [...] the inner part of Roskilde Fjord is configured as an evaporation pan, in the middle of Sjælland, with fluctuating inflows of seawater and freshwater. [...] the Blytt-Sernander climatic zones have been established using the traditional pollen indicators namely the distinct elm-fall at the Full Atlantic/Subboreal transition, and the rise of Beech at the Subboreal/Subatlantic transition. In dating the zones, we follow the investigations in Store Bælt (Christensen et al. 1997). However, 14C datings in RF6 of both the top of Boreal (AAR-3347) and the bottom of Early Atlantic (AAR-3346) confirmed the date of 7000 BC. Similarly, dating the elm-fall in both RF6 (AAR-3345) and Lake Kornerup (AAR- 6263) confirmed the date of 3800 BC.\"[15]\n\nLate Middle Ages\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Late Middle Ages extends from about 700 b2k to 500 b2k.\n\n\"During the late Middle Ages (a.d. 1000–1500), increased storm surges and tidal incursions allowed for extensive progressive erosion of inhabited peatlands, transforming the central Netherlands into the Zuyder Zee tidal lagoon. In the north-eastern quadrant of the expanding water body, medieval terrestrial geological and archaeological records fell prey to erosion, re-working and uptake into lagoon-floor deposits. These deposits have been intensively surveyed since the 1940s when the quadrant was reclaimed and made into arable land, and are revealed to contain spatially clustered late medieval archaeological objects.\"[16]\n\nLittle Ice Age\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Little Ice Age (LIA) appears to have lasted from about 1218 (782 b2k) to about 1878 (122 b2k).\n\n\"The populated 1.0 km² main island (Hauptinsel) to the west and the Düne to the east, which is somewhat smaller at 0.7 km², as well as lower, and surrounded by sand beaches. They were connected until 1720, when the natural connection was destroyed by a storm flood.\"[17]\n\nA \"climate interpretation was supported by very low δ’s in the 1690’es, a period described as extremely cold in the Icelandic annals. In 1695 Iceland was completely surrounded by sea ice, and according to other sources the sea ice reached half way to the Faeroe Islands.\"[18]\n\nIn the image at the top, \"before present\" is used in the context of radiocarbon dating, where the \"present\" has been fixed at 1950. The apparent decreases in solar activity are called the \"Maunder Minimum\", \"Spörer Minimum\", \"Wolf Minimum\", and \"Oort Minimum\".\n\n\"Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures over the past 8000 years have been paced by the slow decrease in summer insolation resulting from the precession of the equinoxes.\"[19]\n\nPrecisely \"dated records of ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland [show] that LIA summer cold and ice growth began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a substantial intensification 1430-1455 AD. Intervals of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past millennium. [Explosive] volcanism produces abrupt summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed. [The] onset of the LIA can be linked to an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global sulfate loading >60 Tg. The persistence of cold summers is best explained by consequent sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer insolation minimum; large changes in solar irradiance are not required.\"[19]\n\n\"At the same time the sortable-silt mean grain size increased suggesting a higher energetic level with regard to currents and waves. At the end of the LIA the sediments show a fining trend again. The changes in grain size likely mirror the frequency and strength of severe storms during the LIA including a calmer period during the Maunder Sun-Spot Minimum (around AD 1700) that was most likely characterized by an increased number of calmer negative NAO situations.\"[13]\n\nHigh Middle Ages\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe High Middle Ages date from around 1,000 b2k to 700 b2k.\n\n\"The first large-scale dike building activities commenced during the High Middle Ages, from the 11th to the 13th century. This marked a significant change in the relationship between man and nature. Whereas previously the sea flowed freely over the whole region during storm tides, it was now shut out. This provided an enormous boost to habitation and agriculture but when storm surges broke through dykes, people and cattle drowned in high numbers. These disasters were perceived as God’s aversion towards human wealth and corruption of moral standards, and had a lasting imprint on the mentality of the coastal population (Jakubowski-Tiessen, 2011).\"[5]\n\n\"Next to the building of dykes, the large-scale exploitation of the extensive peat lands between the clay areas and the sandy areas in the High Middle Ages also had a major impact on the coastal environment. In terms of water management, the construction of dykes and the exploitation of the peatlands cannot be considered separately (De Jonge, 2009). The exploitation together with the oxidising of the peat caused lowering of the level of the mainland behind the dykes which became a permanent challenge for drainage. Salt and peat mining also substantially contributed to the lowering of the marsh surface below the level of the sea.\"[5]\n\nMedieval Warm Period\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Medieval Warm Period (MWP) dates from around 1150 to 750 b2k.\n\n\"A proof-of-concept self-calibrating chronology [based upon the Irish Oak chronology] clearly demonstrates that third order polynomials provide a series of statistical calibration curves that highlight lacunae in the samples.\"[20]\n\nAs indicated in the figures, the data used in the plots comes from radiocarbon dating of Irish Oaks.[21]\n\nGaps occur near the 1070s and 1470s b2k during the rising Δ14C values.\n\n\"The number of suitable samples of wood, which connect Antiquity and the Middle Ages is very small [shown in the first figure on the left]. But only a great number of samples would give certainty against error. For the period about 380 AD we have only 3, for the period about 720 AD only 4 suitable samples of wood (Hollstein 1980,11); usually 50 samples serve for dating.\"[22]\n\n\"The center of the graph [in the second image on the left] shows the time axis of conventionally dated historical events. Upper and lower coordinates show reconstructed time tables. The black triangles mark the phantom years.\"[22]\n\n\"In Frankfurt am Main archaeological excavations did not find any layer for the period between 650 and 910 AD.\"[22]\n\n\"According to earlier studies this land mass [Helgoland] disintegrated before AD 1250 [750 b2k] and the muddy sediments appear to have filled a depression in the southeast of the island. This area, the \"Helgoland Mud Area\" (HMA, 20-30 m of water depth), covers about 500 km2 forming one of the few muddy sediment spots in the North Sea. It can be anticipated that these sediments carry a record that is instrumental in paleoenvironment reconstructions of the past millennium.\"[13]\n\n\"The sediment cores reveal high sedimentation rates (11 mm/a) during the Medieval Warm Period that decrease by 50% at the beginning of the Little Ice Age (LIA, AD 1350-1900 [650 b2k - 100 b2k]).\"[13]\n\nAfter this relatively short cool interlude the climate ameliorated again and reached between 800 and 1200 almost the values of the Roman Warm Period (used temperature proxies are sediments in the North Atlantic).[23] This warming happened during the High Middle Ages wherefore this event is known as Medieval Global Warming or the Medieval Warm Period. This warmer climate peaked around 850 AD and 1050 AD, and raised the tree line in Scandinavia and in Russia by 100 to 140 meters;[24] it enabled the Vikings to settle in Iceland and Greenland.\n\nEarly Middle Ages\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Early Middle Ages date from around 1,700 to 1,000 b2k.\n\n\"During the Early Middle Ages, the Dollard area was a relatively high area consisting of salt-marshes and raised coastal peat bogs [...]. The salt-marshes were occupied in those days; the inhabitants lived on dwelling mounds.\"[25]\n\n\"After 2000 BP the sea broke into the salt-marsh and peat areas and new tidal systems such as the Dollard (800–400 BP) were formed.\"[25]\n\nIn the 19th century the Early Middle Ages were often labelled the Dark Ages, a characterization based on the relative scarcity of literary and cultural output from this time.[26]\n\nDark Ages Cold Period\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nEstimates of the population of the Roman Empire during the period from 150 to 400 [1850 to 1600 b2k] suggest a fall from 65 million to 50 million, a decline of more than 20 percent, connected to the decrease in global temperatures that impaired agricultural yields.[27][28]\n\nImperial Antiquity\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nImperial Antiquity lasts from 2,000 to 1,700 b2k.\n\n\"Many [British] building sequences appear to terminate in the 2nd and 3rd centuries [1900-1700 b2k]. [...] The latest Roman levels are sealed by deposits of dark coloured loam, commonly called the 'dark earth' (formerly 'black earth'). In the London area the 'dark earth' generally appears as a dark grey, rather silty loam with various inclusions, especially building material. The deposit is usually without stratification and homogeneous in appearance, It can be one meter or more in thickness. [...] The evidence suggests that truncation of late Roman stratification is linked to the process of 'dark earth' formation.\"[29]\n\n“Parts [of Londinium] / were already covered by a horizon of dark silts (often described as 'dark earth') / Land was converted to arable and pastoral use or abandoned entirely. The dark earth may have started forming in the 3rd century.\"[30]\n\nRoman Warm Period\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Roman Warm Period, or Roman Climatic Optimum, was a period of unusually warm weather in Europe and the North Atlantic that ran from approximately 250 BC to AD 400 [2250 to 1600 b2k].[31]\n\nThe start of the subatlantic is 2,500 radiocarbon years BP which represents roughly 625 BC.[32]\n\n\"This relatively high position of the [Mean High Water] palaeo-MHW is in accordance with the late Subatlantic Pollen date of the stratified sandy muds (pollen zone Vb2).\"[25]\n\nThe \"calibration of radiocarbon dates at approximately 2500-2450 BP [2500-2450 b2k] is problematic due to a \"plateau\" (known as the \"Hallstatt-plateau\") in the calibration curve [...] A decrease in solar activity caused an increase in production of 14C, and thus a sharp rise in Δ 14C, beginning at approximately 850 cal (calendar years) BC [...] Between approximately 760 and 420 cal BC (corresponding to 2500-2425 BP [2500-2425 b2k]), the concentration of 14C returned to \"normal\" values.\"[33]\n\nIn eastern Germany Dietrich Franke subdivides the subatlantic into four stages (from young to old):[34]\n\nyoungest subatlantic: 1800 until present: modern history\n\nyounger subatlantic: 1250 until 1800: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Early Modern Period\n\nmiddle subatlantic: 500 until 1250: migration period and Slavic migrations\n\nolder subatlantic: 500 BC until 500 AD: pre-Roman Iron Age, ancient Rome and start of migration period.\n\nThe lower limit of the glaciers in Scandinavia descended during the subatlantic by 100 to 200 meters.[35]\n\nThe beginning of the subatlantic opened at the middle of the first millennium BC with the so-called Roman Warm Period which lasted to the beginning of the 4th century, corresponding broadly to classical antiquity, with the optimum marked by a temperature spike centered around 2,500 BP.[36] As a consequence in Europe the winter temperatures were raised by 0.6 °C during this period,[37] yet on average were still by 0.3 °C lower than during the subboreal.\n\nClassical antiquity\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nClassical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is the period of cultural history between the 8th century BC and the 6th century AD centered on the Mediterranean Sea [2800 to 1400 b2k], comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome known as the Greco-Roman world.\n\nIn the British Isles, the British Iron Age lasted from about 800 BC [2800 b2k][38] until the Roman Conquest and until the 5th century in non-Romanised parts.\n\nIron Age\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe iron age history period began between 3,200 and 2,100 b2k.\n\nA semi-circular stone wall at left hints at the existence of a large and ancient building and to the right are the ruins of various other stone structures. In the background a low cliff divides a body of water from grassy fields.\n\nHumans first made a Neolithic settlement at Rinyo. Other remnants include Bronze Age burnt mounds, Iron Age crannogs and brochs (the highest density anywhere in Scotland: three within 500 metres (547 yd) of coastline), Viking boat burials, remains of a medieval church and a stately home at Trumland.\n\nOver 100 archaeological sites have been identified. Only a small fraction have been excavated and characterized. The most spectacular of the sites is the complex of Midhowe Broch and Midhowe Chambered Cairn. Blackhammer Chambered Cairn, Taversoe Tuick and Yarso are important tombs.\n\nRousay placenames reflect its Norse heritage. 'Hrólfs-øy' or 'Hrolfsey' was based on the male name 'Hrolf' (Rolf). Hugh Marwick's work showed the name developing from 'Rollesay' in the 14th century, through 'Rolsay' in the 15th, and 'Rowsay' in the early 16th, with the spelling 'Rousay' first recorded in 1549.[39]\n\nSubboreal history\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe \"period around 850-760 BC [2850-2760 b2k], characterised by a decrease in solar activity and a sharp increase of Δ 14C [...] the local vegetation succession, in relation to the changes in atmospheric radiocarbon content, shows additional evidence for solar forcing of climate change at the Subboreal - Subatlantic transition.\"[33]\n\nThe \"Holocene climatic optimum in this interior part of Asia [Lake Baikal] corresponds to the Subboreal period 2.5–4.5 ka\".[40]\n\n\"The sea only breached the narrow landbridge at the Brig o' Waithe in Stenness, filling the loch was salt water, around 1500BC - 500 to 1,000 years after the ring was built.\"[41]\n\nThe Subboreal is 3800-500 BC, 5800-2500 b2k.[15]\n\n\"The boundary between the Atlantic and Subboreal periods is defined by the marked fall in the elm (Ulmus) curve.\"[15]\n\n\"At the same time, a catastrophic fall in the ivy (Hedera) pollen curves is seen in Danish pollen diagrams. This fall is especially striking in coastal areas. It seems that the fjords in Subboreal times (due to lack of tides?) started to freeze in the winters, thereby reversing the climatic effect of the sea (Iversen 1973).\"[15]\n\nSubboreal-3 is 4200-3600 BP.[42]\n\n\"During the subsequent fluctuations in the lake levels the settlements shifted to higher levels. Radiocarbon dates for this stage: 4000-3700 (lake-level rise) and 3700-3600 (lake-level fall) BP. These settlements are considered as belonging to different cultural traditions: Zhizhitsian and North-Byelorussian, the latter being viewed as a local variant of the Corded Ware. The deposits of this stage contain limited amount of bones of domesticates (sheep, goat, cattle, pig), yet their overall rate is less that 14 %. Following the catastrophic transgression the tradition of lake dwellings ceased and was never resumed again. Early Iron Age sites (starting with Uzmenian culture) emerged on higher levels at greater distance from the lakes.\"[42]\n\nBronze Age\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe bronze age history period began between 5,300 and 2,600 b2k.\n\nSkara Brae on the Bay of Skaill, west coast of Mainland, Orkney, consists of a number of small houses without roofs.[43][44]\n\nSubboreal-2 is 5500-4200 BP.[42]\n\n\"During the subsequent rise of the lake level, the settlement was repeatedly relocated onto higher levels and nearer to the shore and eventually destroyed by the fire at about 4200 BP; its remains were sealed with sand. Judging from the pollen evidence, at that time, mixed coniferous forests were restricted to morainic hills, with pine forests on sandy plains and rich aquatic flora in the immediate vicinity of the sites. The deposits contain 40 species of animals and fishes including large mammals: elk, brown bear and boar being the most common, and also fur animals: marten, otter and squirrel. Judging by the age groups, the elk was huntered throughout the year. Pike and perch were the most common among the fish. At least 30 edible plants were identified in the deposits of pile-dwellings; hazel-nut and water chestnut (Trapa natans) were allegedly the main source of plant protein. Rich cultural assemblage found in these levels is referred to as Usvyatian. A short-lived regression marked the end of this stage.\"[42]\n\n\"Part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, the Ring of Brodgar is found in the West Mainland parish of Stenness. It stands on an eastward-sloping plateau on the Ness of Brodgar - a thin strip of land separating the Harray and Stenness lochs.\"[41]\n\n\"Because the interior of the Ring of Brodgar has never been fully excavated, or scientifically dated, the monument's actual age remains uncertain. However, it is generally assumed to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC, and was, therefore, the last of the great Neolithic monuments built on the Ness.\"[41]\n\n\"With a diameter of 103.6 metres (340 ft), the Brodgar ring is the third largest stone circle in the British Isles. Covering an area of 8,435 square metres (90,790 square feet), it is beaten only by the outer ring of stones at Avebury and the Greater Ring at Stanton Drew in England. Incidentally, the Brodgar ring is exactly the same size as Avebury's two inner rings.\"[41]\n\n\"In fact, when the ring was erected, between 2500BC and 2000BC, the Stenness loch didn't exist. Instead the area was wet, marshy bog, surrounding pools of water or lochans.\"[41]\n\nSubboreal-1 is 5700-5500 BP.[42]\n\n\"This stage started with an abrupt fall of the lake levels during which the lake at Rudnya-Serteya turned into mire with accumulation of detritus gyttja, rich in plant remains, mostly reed, sedge and scirpus, dark brown gyttja rich in decomposed plant remains and peat.

The initial stage of pile dwellings is particularly well repre- sented at the site of Usvyaty 4, in the levels dated: 5570±40, 5530±40, 5490±65, 5480±60 BP etc.\"[42]\n\nAtlantic history\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe \"Atlantic period [is] 4.6–6 ka [4,600-6,000 b2k].\"[40]\n\n\"Starting with the Atlantic period (8-5 ka BP), in conditions of general temperature increase (by 1.5 °C annually) and rainfall (by 80-100 mm annually), one notes a substantial rise in the lake-level throughout Northern and North-Eastern Europe.\"[42]\n\n\"In the 1970s and 1980s a site called Tybrind Vig, a few hundred yards off the coast of a Danish island in the Baltic Sea, yielded evidence of a surprisingly advanced late Mesolithic fishing culture, including finely decorated canoe paddles and several long, thin canoes, one of them over 30 feet long. More recently, [others] have excavated a series of underwater settlements in Wismar Bay, on the German Baltic coast, dating between 8,800 and 5,500 years ago. The sites vividly document the people’s shift in diet from freshwater fish to marine species, as the sea rise transformed their land over centuries from inland lakes surrounded by forests, to reedy marshes, to fjords, and eventually to the open bay there now.\"[1]\n\nThe Late-Atlantic-2 period is 6000-5700 BP.[42]\n\n\"Following the rise of the lake-level, the previous settlement was abandoned and covered with yellow medium-grained sand. A new site was found in the level of olive-coloured gyttya. This level includes the pottery of the previous type combined with new varieties which have analogies in the Narvian (eastern Peribaltic) as well as in the Upper Volga and Upper Dniper cultures. Remains of a wishweir lie directly above this level; they were radiocarbon dated to 5780±50 (LE-2577) and 5770±50 (LE-2570) BP. The pollen spectra show the highest content in thermophylous broad-leaved species reaching 34 % and suggesting a significant rise in temperature. The level includes numerous seeds and macrofossil remains of aquatic plants, including Nymphaea sp. and Ceratiophyllum sp.\"[42]\n\n\"Then, around 6,000 years ago, a new people from the south arrived on the thickly forested shores of the British Isles.

The pottery shows a continuity in relation to the Serteyan with the appearance of new elements: the pointed “thorn-bottomed” vessels with S-like profiles, made of clay tempered with crushed shells, organic matter and a small admixture of sand. The stone inventory was dominated by scrapers manufactured from flakes, and includes the arrowheads and the fragments of axes and adzes. The rich bone and antler industry has analogies in the early Neolithic of eastern Peribaltic. A large series of radiocarbon dates falls within a time-span of 6200-6000 BP.\"[42]\n\nMiddle Atlantic\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Middle Atlantic period is 7000-6500 BP.[42]\n\n\"The period of low level during which the calcareous gyttja with shells was deposited on top of the silt at the site of Rudnya Serteyskaya. These deposits for which no radiocarbon dates are available include the materials of the oldest pottery-bearing tradition in that area referred by Miklyaev to the Serteyan. The conic pottery vessels ornamented with rows of triangular impressions were made of clay tampered with coarse sand and organic matter. The stone industry consisted of fragmented implements made on blades and flakes. The pollen spectra reflect a relatively cool episode within the Atlantic climatic optimum, with the total amount of broad-leaved species (oak, elm and lime) being less than 7 %; among the macrofossils were identified: alder, birch, willow and horsetail.\"[42]\n\nFull Atlantic\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Full Atlantic period is 6000-3800 BC, 8000-5800 b2k.[15]\n\n\"In Roskilde Fjord the Full Atlantic period is characterised by the formation of oyster banks in the narrows of the fjord. 14C datings of oysters range from 5700 BC for the lowermost and oldest to 3700 BC for oysters from the top of the oyster banks (Bondesen 2002).\"[15]\n\n\"In the beginning of the Full Atlantic, the sea reached its present level and by the end of the period it was three meters above the present sea level.\"[15]\n\n\"In this period, the salinity of the fjord must have been above 2.2%, the lowest salinity at which the oyster can breed. Moreover, the summer temperature is critical for the oysters’ ability to breed, thus it must have been warmer than today (Spärck 1936).\"[15]\n\n\"The high salinity is also indicated by the Mg/Ca ratio in the gyttja of RF6 [...].\"[15]\n\n\"The high productivity of the oyster in the narrows of the fjord (thickness of oyster banks often more than 10 meters) also indicates the presence of tides in the Atlantic times.\"[15]\n\n\"The strand lines from the Full Atlantic are characterised by a high abundance of iron concretions (local name: “dværgkrukker” = gnome pots).\"[15]\n\n\"During the Full Atlantic, humans expanded their dwellings on the coast (the Ertebølle culture) [...].

The pollen show gradual spread of pine dominated forest with hazel in underwood, and an increasing admixture of broad-leaf species starting with the beginning of the Atlantic. No authentic Mesolithic sites attributable to this period have ever been found in the area. There are unconfirmed reports about the finds of Kunda-like implements in deep layers of a peat bog near the Lake of Zhizhitsa.\"[42]\n\nThe Early Atlantic is 7000-6000 BC, 9000-8000 b2k.[15]\n\n\"Around 7000 BC the sea invaded the lowland, flooding lakes and bogs, creating the Roskilde Fjord. As shown by 14C datings (Bondesen 2002), the transgression was almost simultaneous over the entire fjord, and the Boreal bog in RF6 (10.20 m below present sea level) is covered by 20 cm of littoral shell deposits, which were later followed by five meters of marine gyttja.\"[15]\n\n\"Also in the Early Atlantic period considerable erosion took place in the narrow parts. The configuration of the Early Atlantic fjord [...] was extreme, with very narrow passages. The configuration of the former coastlines is based partly on drill hole information (Bondesen 1988), but the details mainly come from the geoelectrical mapping [...] of Roskilde Fjord and Isefjord, where more than 500 km of profiling has been measured in the map area (seismic profiles are unable to establish the thickness of the Holocene deposits due to the high gas content (Bondesen et al. 1979)).\"[15]\n\n\"The pollen curves shown [below] illustrate how the climax trees oak (Quercus) and lime (Tilia) oust the pioneer trees birch (Betula) and pine (Pinus). Also the grass-pollen decreases due to the increasing shade of the climax trees (this could however also be due to varying size of the swamp).\"[15]\n\n\"During the Early Atlantic, humans (the Kongemose culture) moved their dwellings to the coast [...].\"[15]\n\n\"In many places, archaeologists found traces of the catastrophe: in the East of Scotland, near Inverness, the wave surprised people by a camp fire, as shown by a 25cm layer of sand and gravel ten meters above sea level. Remains of urchins, sea mussels and seaweed testify to the rush of water which carried everything along. In Norway, on the Shetland Islands, and the Faroe Islands, traces of devastation lay even higher above the sea level of that time, waves above 20m crashed onto the land. The age of the desposits yielded a consistant value of 8,150 years.\"[45]\n\n\"The decisive clues for the mesolithic mass death are mosses, especially Hylocomium splendens, known today as glittering wood-moss, or mountain fern moss. After the tsunamis of 8,150 years ago, they were buried under sea mud so that they remained sealed up and preserved. The state of growth they have been found in reveals at what season the monster waves hit.\"[45]\n\n\"Every Spring fresh new green shoots of Hylocomium splendens appear, which branch out every subsequent month. The mosses in the destroyed Mesolithic settlements betray the fact that they were buried in late fall.\"[45]\n\nThe \"stone age hunters must have all returned to the coasts by then. Therefore the tsunamis must have caught most of the people off-guard, it must have been terrible. The loss of their reserves, tools and dwellings must have been a grave problem for them. Many probably didn’t make it through the winter.\"[46]\n\nBoreal transition\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"During the Boreal (9-8 ka BP) the lake-level rose and intense accu- mulation of organic matter took place in many lakes of central and North-Western Russia as well as in the Peribaltic area and Byelorussia (Davydova, 1992).\"[42]\n\n\"Some 8,200 years ago, after millennia of incrementally rising seas, a massive release of meltwater from a giant glacial lake in North America, called Lake Agassiz, caused sea levels to jump by more than two feet. By slowing the circulation of warm water in the North Atlantic, this influx of frigid water triggered a sudden plunge in temperature, causing Doggerland’s coasts—if any remained—to be battered by frigid winds. If that were not enough, around the same time, a landslide on the seafloor off the coast of Norway, called the Storegga slide, [ca 8,150 years ago], triggered a tsunami that flooded the coastlines of northern Europe.\"[1]\n\n\"On a diving expedition off the village of Cley-next-the-Sea in Norfolk, [...] the remains of a mighty Doggerland oak forest [have been discovered], most probably flattened by the tsunami, lying on the ocean floor, in shallow waters, less than half a mile off the coast.

It is likely that the remains of a small Mesolithic hunting camp were destroyed by the mound builders.\"[50]\n\n\"A charred hazelnut shell recovered during the excavations at Longhowe in Tankerness (Orkney, Scotland), earlier this year, has been dated to 6820-6660 BCE. Although Orkney has plenty of indications of early (pre-farming or Mesolithic) settlement in the form of stone tools, this is the first date to relate to this activity. It pushes back the dated settlement of Orkney by 3,000 years.\"[50]\n\n\"This date relates to the earliest known period of settlement of Scotland when bands of nomadic hunters lived here. Remains from this time are scarce and few sites have been recognised by archaeologists, especially in the north. Longhowe is therefore important both for the light it can shed on this elusive period of Orkney's past as well as for our understanding of the early settlement of Scotland as a whole.\"[51]\n\nThe Boreal period is 8000-7000 BC, or 10,000 to 9,000 b2k.[15]\n\n\"The filling up of the Preboreal lake and the results of the sinking Preboreal groundwater level are seen in [the pollen diagram on the right].

Even the flints we picked up at Longhowe, near Minehowe, last summer were quite different.”[53]\n\n“I think that it is quite early Mesolithic, dating from between 9000BC-7000BC, but we’ll need to wait for dates before we can know for sure. There’s an awful lot more work to do.”[53]\n\n\"About 9000 years ago the temperature in Greenland culminated at 4°C warmer than today. Since then it has become slowly cooler with only one dramatic change of climate. This happened 8250 years ago [...]. In an otherwise warm period the temperature fell 7°C within a decade, and it took 300 years to re-establish the warm climate. This event has also been demonstrated in European wooden ring series and in European bogs.\"[18]\n\nThe last glaciation appears to have a gradual decline ending about 12,000 b2k. This may have been the end of the Pre-Boreal transition.\n\nFrom \"sea-level studies in Kattegat (Mörner 1969) [...] the Holocene sea level in the southern part of Kattegat was at it’s lowest just before the Boreal period.\"[15]\n\nThis in the image on the right \"is how the north-west of Europe presented itself in 7,000 BC.\"[54]\n\n\"You see that the sea, in grey, 5m below its present level, licked the slopes of the Dogger Bank which dominated it by some 15m. [We might point out that it was probably more, on account of the erosion having occurred since.] Men, who had been moving back for a thousand years on a hopelessly flat terrain, found refuge on this mountain \"of a mediocre altitude\" but the sea began to encircle it by the north-east, where an outcropping was already almost isolated.\"[54]\n\n\"To the south-west, the sea infiltrated more deeply, penetrating in deep ravines which had been dug by the rivers forced to circumvent the Bank.

These deposits may originate from the surface erosion and the subsequent inwash of coastal forms of numerous interconnected post-glacial lakes which existed in that area. The coastal forms were subjected to wind erosion, resulting in formation of wind blown dunes. This period corresponded to the initial human settlement of the area, with several sites consisting of large concentrations of flint tools found on the elevated terraces and dunes (Ivantsov Bor, Lukashenki 1-3, Serteya and others). Lithic assemblages include the tanged points of Ahrensburg, Lyngby and Svidry types, suggesting repeated yet ephemeral settlements of hunting groups.\"[42]\n\n\"The Younger Dryas interval during the Last Glacial Termination was an abrupt return to glacial-like conditions punctuating the transition to a warmer, interglacial climate.\"[55]\n\n\"From former cirque glaciers in western Norway, it is calculated that the summer (1.May to 30.September) temperature dropped 5-6°C during less than two centuries, probably within decades, at the Alleröd/Younger Dryas transition, some 11,000 years ago.\"[56]\n\n\"From the same data the Younger Dryas summer temperature is estimated to have been 8-10°C lower than at present, and from fossil ice wedges the mean annual temperatures 13°C lower than at present in the same area.\"[56]\n\n\"At the time of the Alleröd/Younger Dryas transition, the Scandinavian ice-sheet was still a major element in the climate system. The record from the Younger Dryas is distinct, consisting of ice-marginal deposits that are mapped nearly continuously around Scandinavia [...], showing that the climate turned to a more glacial regime in both the continental climate area of USSR/Finland and the oceanic climate area of Western Norway. This suggests that lower summer temperatures, and not increased winter precipitation, was the climatic factor that determined the major pattern of glacial response.\"[56]\n\nAn \"amplification of the re-advance in Western Norway compared to the easterly areas, due to higher winter precipitation along the western flank of the ice-sheet, and topographical and glaciological factors [...] The re-advance also caused a relative rise in sea level in Western Norway through the combination of increased gravitational attraction and a halt in glacio-isostatic uplift (Anundsen, 1985).\"[56]\n\nThe diagrams on the right show percentages of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma from two cores: \"a\" Troll 3.1 (60° 46.7' N, 3° 42.8' E, 332 m water depth) in the Norwegian Trench and \"b\" V23-81 located off Ireland.[57]\n\n\"Annual layer counting through the most recent of these [sudden changes in the temperature of precipitation] indicates that a warming of ~7 °C occurred within a 50-yr period during the transition from the Younger Dryas cold phase (~11-10 kyr BP) to the present interglacial2.\"[57]\n\nLate Weichselian\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"Recent stratigraphical achievements and long time established chronologies exist for the Late Weichselian, i.e. 10-25 ka BP.

At 12.94 ka (2), this site was a large late Glacial sand ridge covered by open forest at the northern edge of a marsh. More than 50 archaeological sites in this area indicate frequent visits by the late Magdalenians, hunter-gatherers who were contemporaries of the Clovis culture in North America. Throughout the Bölling-Allerod, eolian sediments known as the Coversands blanketed the Lommel area. Then, just before the Younger Dryas began, a thin layer of bleached sand was deposited and, in turn, was covered by the dark layer marked \"YDB\" above. That stratum is called the Usselo Horizon and is composed of fine to medium quartz sands rich in charcoal. The dark Usselo Horizon is stratigraphically equivalent to the YDB layer and contains a similar assemblage of impact markers (magnetic grains, magnetic microspherules, iridium, charcoal, and glass-like carbon). The magnetic grains have a high concentration of Ir (117 ppb), which is the highest value measured for all sites yet analyzed. On the other hand, YDB bulk sediment analyses reveal Ir values below the detection limit of 0.5 ppb, suggesting that the Ir carrier is in the magnetic grain fraction. The abundant charcoal in this black layer suggests widespread biomass burning. A similar layer of charcoal, found at many other sites in Europe, including the Netherlands (3), Great Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, and Poland (4), also dates to the onset of the Younger Dryas (12.9 ka) and, hence, correlates with the YDB layer in North America.\"[59]\n\nUsselo is the type site for the 'Usselo Soil', the 'Usselo horizon' or 'Usselo layer', a distinctive and widespread Weichselian (Lateglacial) buried soil, paleosol, found within Lateglacial eolian sediments known as 'cover sands' in the Netherlands, western Germany, and western Denmark; classified as either a weakly podzolized Arenosol or as a weakly podzolized Regosol, where numerous radiocarbon dates, optically stimulated luminescence dates, pollen analyses, and archaeological evidence from a number of locations have been interpreted to show that the Usselo Soil formed as the result of pedogenesis during a period of landscape stability during the Allerød oscillation that locally continued into the Younger Dryas stadial as a marker bed.[60][61][62]\n\nThe abundant charcoal, which is found in the Usselo Soil, and contemporaneous Lateglacial paleosols and organic sediments across Europe, may have been created by wildfires caused by a large bolide impact, based upon the reported occurrence of alleged extraterrestrial impact indicators and hypothetical correlations with Clovis-age organic beds in North America.[63] However, the contemporaneous nature of the Usselo Soil with Clovis-age organic beds in North America, the presence of impact indicators within it, and the impact origin of the charcoal may only be apparent.[64][65][66]\n\nThe mesolithic period dates from around 13,000 to 8,500 b2k.\n\n\"Bruine Bank, an area in the North Sea, is known to fishermen for mainly two things: the excellent catch rates when the weather is cold – and the bones, mammoth teeth, and even artefacts which frequently get caught in the nets [...] The bones, teeth and artefacts stem from a long lost land, Doggerland. Until the end of the last Ice Age, about 8000 years ago, the North Sea was still a part of the continent, even beyond the British Isles.

Ever since this pulse was identified from coral records in 1989, the origins of the meltwater have been the subject of debate. Some researchers have hypothesized that Antarctica was the major source of the meltwater, whereas other scientists have suggested that it came from the Northern Hemisphere.\"[75]\n\nMelting \"ice sheets in North America, followed by Scandinavia, were the dominant drivers of MWP-1A and that the world’s mean sea level rise was 17.9 meters over 500 years.\"[75]\n\nSeas \"rose significantly more in the Southern Hemisphere, indicating that 65%–80% of MWP-1A’s meltwater came from the Northern Hemisphere.\"[75]\n\n\"In this case, the observed low sea level rise in the Northern Hemisphere supports a major northern contribution with a relatively minor Antarctic contribution. Also, during the past 10 years, more and more Antarctic field-based glaciological evidence suggests the Antarctic Ice Sheet was relatively stable during MWP-1A.\"[76]\n\n\"The new research is a possible answer to the question of meltwater sources for MWP-1A, but that the debate is far from over.\"[77]\n\n\"Previous studies that analyzed data from Tahiti, Barbados, and the Sunda Shelf are reliable, because they are based on uranium series dating. Data in the new study that came from the Great Barrier Reef and Scotland are based on a radiocarbon dating method, which requires caution in interpreting the timing, particularly during the deglaciation.\"[77]\n\nThe updated method of calibrating the radiocarbon timescale \"will produce some complicated uncertainties regarding the dating results, and we have used some statistical techniques to fully capture those uncertainties. In this case, our results considered those uncertainties carefully.\"[76]\n\n\"In the future, the researchers want to study more sea level sites to better understand MWP-1A. They also want to see how they can use their results to replicate climate changes during the event.\"[78]\n\n\"A better understanding of MWP-1A could yield insights into global ocean circulation behavior under rapid freshwater discharge and could provide better predictions of future climate change.\"[75]\n\n\"We hope that our study will help climate modelers and paleoscientists piece together the impact of this event, with clear parallels for understanding the impact of increasing melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet today.\"[78]\n\nMarine Isotope Stage 2\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nSpynie Clay Formation, NE Scotland formations (Merritt et al., 2003)[72]\n\nSt Fergus Silt Formation\n\nLetham Silt Formation, MIS 1 - MIS 2 (Windermere Interstadial (Bølling/Allerød)), Units established by Browne et al.

The sea level was 121 ± 5 metres below present level during the last glacial maximum. The deglacial sea level rise was not monotonic; rather, it was marked by two intervals of rapid rise. Varying rates of melt-water discharge to the North Atlantic surface ocean dramatically affected North Atlantic deep-water production and oceanic oxygen isotope chemistry. A global oxygen isotope record for ocean water has been calculated from the Barbados sea level curve, allowing separation of the ice volume component common to all oxygen isotope records measured in deep-sea cores.\"[79]\n\n\"During the Late Weichselian glacial maximum (20-15 ka BP) the overriding of ice streams eventually lead to strong glaciotectonic displacement of Late Pleistocene and pre-Quaternary deposits and to deposition of till.\"[58]\n\n\"Here [in the image on the right] is what north-western Europe looked like in 18,000 BC, at the end of an ice age which had lasted 70,000 years.

The formation of ice at the expense of the oceans brought down the sea level by 120m.\"[54]\n\n\"The polar ice sheet was crushing Scandinavia, reaching Denmark and part of the North Sea, which had dried up all the way to the Orkney Islands, because of the 120 meter drop in sea level. The Scottish glacier covered the west of the North Sea. The retreating of the water pushed the Atlantic back 150 km from the present shores of Brittany.\"[54]\n\n\"We can see that the sea is 100 km to 150 km away from the present coastline of Brittany and Ireland. The English Channel and the Irish Sea were dry, but space is lacking there for our Great Plain.

An enormous glacier two to three thousand meters thick covered the mountains of Norway and advanced on the North Sea. It's moraine formed the backbone of Denmark. Another glacier, less huge, crowned the mountains of Scotland and occupied the West of this area. It's only when the climate warmed up considerably in 10,000 BC that the area became inhabitable.\"[54]\n\n\"At the time of the last glacial maximum, 18,000 years ago, sea levels were 340ft (120 metres) lower than they are today.\"[80]\n\n\"They have also found parts of sabre-toothed tigers [the lower jawbone bone is 20,000 years old], the skull of a woolly rhino and the cranium of a reindeer.\"[80]\n\nJylland stade\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"After c. 22 ka BP during the Jylland stade (Houmark-Nielsen 1989), Late Weichselian glaciers of the Main Weichselain advance overrode Southeast Denmark from the northeast and later the Young Baltic ice invaded from southeasterly directions. Traces of the Northeast-ice are apparently absent in the Klintholm sections, although large scale glaciotectonic structures and till deposits from this advance are found in Hjelm Bugt and Møns Klint (Aber 1979; Berthelsen 1981, 1986). At Klintholm, the younger phase of glaciotectonic deformation from the southeast and south and deposition of the discordant till (unit 9) were most probably associated with recessional phases of the Young Baltic glaciation. In several cliff sections, well preserved Late Glacial (c. 14-10 ka BP) lacustrine sequences are present (Kolstrup 1982, Heiberg 1991).\"[58]\n\nThe \"Allarp Till (Berglund & Lagerlund 1981), was deposited in connection with the first Late Weichselian ice advance in southern Sweden. Petrographic studies (Bose 1990) indicate that the first Late Weichselian ice advance which overrode northern Germany and reached the Brandenburg stage has a composition comparable to the Allarp till and the bedded diamictons from Klintholm.\"[58]\n\nHuneborg interstadial\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Huneborg interstadial is a Greenland interstadial dating 36.5-38.5 kyr B.P.

The handaxes are bifacially-worked and in the shape of a rounded triangle. They are only found in Britain in the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) interglacial between 59,000 and 41,000 years BP, and are therefore considered a unique diagnostic variant.[89][90]\n\nLynford Quarry is the location of a well-preserved in-situ Middle Palaeolithic open-air site near Mundford, Norfolk.[91]\n\nThe site, which dates to approximately 60,000 years ago, is believed to show evidence of hunting by Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). The finds include the in-situ remains of at least nine woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), associated with Mousterian stone tools and debitage. The artefactual, faunal and environmental evidence were sealed within a Middle Devensian palaeochannel with a dark organic fill. Well preserved in-situ sites of the time are exceedingly rare in Europe and very unusual within a British context.[92]\n\nThe site also produced rhinoceros teeth, antlers, as well as other faunal evidence. The stone tools on the site numbered 600, made up of individual artefacts or waste flakes. Particularly interesting were the 44 hand axes of sub-triangular or ovate form.[93]\n\nThe site was dated to Marine Isotope Stage 3 using Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating of the sand from the two layers of deposits within the channel.[93]\n\nThe Last Glacial Maximum is referred to in Britain as the Dimlington Stadial, dated to between 31,000 and 16,000 years.[94][95] In the archaeology of Paleolithic Europe, the LGM spans the Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean, Magdalenian and Périgordian cultures.\n\nOdderade interstadial\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Odderade interstadial has a 14C date of 61-72 kyr B.P. and corresponds to GIS 21.[81]\n\n\"During the Odderade interstadial, the limit of the south-boreal and the mixed forest may be situated at Watten, while the transition from the north-boreal to the middle-boreal forest is found in the Netherlands and northern Germany.\"[96]\n\nEarly Middle Weichselian\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"The early Middle Weichselian is assumed to correspond to the period 80-􏰀62kyr BP and to MIS-4. During this interval, average sea levels reached lower values than during the Early Weichselian and ice extent can be expected to have been substantial. But, as the global sea-level oscillations in this interval are also large, substantial ice-volume fluctuations can be anticipated across northern Eurasia within this stage.\"[97]\n\nMarine Isotope Stage 4\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"Using stone tool residue analysis with supporting information from zooarchaeology, we provide evidence that at the Abri du Maras, Ardèche, France, Neanderthals [a skull is imaged on the left from Abri du Maras] were behaviorally flexible at the beginning of MIS 4. Here, Neanderthals exploited a wide range of resources including large mammals, fish, ducks, raptors, rabbits, mushrooms, plants, and wood. Twisted fibers on stone tools provide evidence of making string or cordage.\"[98]\n\nMIS Boundary 4/5 is at 71 ka.[99]\n\nMarine Isotope Stage 5\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nMarine Isotope Stage 5 or MIS 5 is a Marine Isotope Stage in the geologic temperature record, between 130,000 and 80,000 years ago.[100]\n\n\"The Neanderthal fossils [from Denisova cave] examined dated from 80,000 to 140,000 years ago.

The axe has been broken and originally would have tapered to a point opposite the cutting edge. But at some point in antiquity, the point broke off and someone reworked the flint to its present straight edge.\"[102]\n\n“The problem with the Palaeolithic axes found in Scotland, to date, is that because they were not found ‘in context’ — that is, associated with other finds of the same era — there is some debate as to their authenticity. But we’re not going to find much contextual evidence, as we’re not likely to find sites of that date in Scotland that still have hearths and postholes still in situ.”[103]\n\n“We have to remember that this was an incredibly long time ago — pre-Ice Age, in fact. Britain wasn’t an island but was still connected to mainland Europe, and across this landscape the people of the Palaeolithic, nomadic hunter-gatherers, wandered from season to season.”[103]\n\n“What we can say is that it is definitely older than 100,000 years — so old it’s become geology. Palaeolithic people must have passed through what was later to become Scotland, so we’ve not discounted the possibility that the axe is evidence of people of that era in this area. But, because it’s so early, we need further information first.\"[103]\n\n“A site visit, to check for the presence of other flint nodules, will be first on the agenda to see whether there is any more evidence of ballast in the area the axe was found, and we’re hoping to take first steps soon.”[103]\n\n“This exciting and intriguing find raises more questions than it answers. It would be useful to know more about ballast deposition practice around Kirkwall Harbour, and we would be very interested in hearing from anyone who has information on local traditions.\"[104]\n\n\"The only other suspected Palaeolithic axe found in Orkney came from Upperborough, in Harray. This axe was discovered in the early years of the 20th century and presented to the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland in 1913.\"[102]\n\nIt was “picked up . . . on the surface of the ground, in gravel, on the common to the west of the township of Upperborough, Harray, at about half a mile distant from the Loch of Harray, and some five miles from the sea”.[104]\n\nThe \"Harray artefact was not from the Palaeolithic\".[103]\n\n\"The Palaeolithic – or Old Stone Age – was a long period of hunter-gatherers, extending from the time when humans first evolved up to about 10,000 BC. In Britain, the earliest evidence of human activity dates from about 700,000 years ago, although there are long periods, of 100,000 years or more, when there appears to have been no human presence. The period is divided up by historians into the Lower (the oldest), Middle and Upper Palaeolithic to indicate when social and technological developments – mainly increasingly sophisticated flint tools – occurred.\"[102]\n\n\"The vegetation observed at Watten during the Brørup interstadial is a mixed forest of conifers and deciduous trees, while at the same time northwestern Europe is covered by a middle- and south-boreal forest.\"[96]\n\nMIS Boundary 5.4 (peak) is at 109 ka.[99]\n\nHerning Stadial\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nMIS Boundary 5.5 (peak) is at 123 ka.[99]\n\n\"By comparison with the profiles described from northern Germany by Menke and Tynni (1984) and Behre (1989), it is now possible, on stratigraphical grounds, to correlate the stadial phases observed at Watten with the Herning (pollen zone 2)\".[96]\n\nEemian interglacial\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe \"controversially split Eemian period, the predecessor of our own warm period about 125,000 years ago.\"[18]\n\nRelative chronology and duration of pollen zones[97] Pollen zone Species Duration (kyr) Initial chronology\n\nStart (kyr BP)\n\nEnd\n\nModified chronology\n\nStart\n\nEnd\n\nE6b Pinus 2.5 122.0 119.5 122.0 119.54 E6a Picea 2 124.5 122.0 124.0 122.0 E5 Carpinus 3.5 129.5 124.5 128.0 124.5 E4b Taxus/Tilia 1.1 130.6 129.5 129.1 128.0 E4a Corylus 0.7 131.3 130.6 129.8 129.1 E3b Quercus, Corylus 0.45 131.75 131.3 130.25 129.8 E3a Quercus 0.25 132.0 131.75 130.50 130.25 E2b Pinus, Quercus 0.2 132.2 132.0 130.70 130.5 E2a Pinus, Ulmus 0.2 132.4 132.2 130.90 130.7 E1 Betula, Pinus 0.1 132.5 132.4 131.0 130.9\n\nMarine Isotope Stage 5e\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n\"In the deep sea record the onset of the Last Interglacial and MIS-5e is usually defined as the time when global sea level was midway between its lowest value at the end of the glacial maximum at c. 140 kyr BP and the time at which present sea level was first reached at c. 130􏰀-129 kyr BP (Stirling et al. 1998), or at c. 135 kyr BP. This is not a precise definition, because the time at which the sea-level rise started is not well constrained and the rise may not have been uniform as is indicated by the oscillation that may have occurred during this rise (Esat et al. 1999). In northern Europe the definition of the Eemian period is based on the fossil pollen record, and the relative chronology defined by Müller (1974) and Zagwijn (1996) is adopted here ([above table]). The Eemian is characterized by a uniform vegetation development and similar pollen zones can be identified across the entire region from the Atlantic coast and North Sea to the Arkhangelsk region. In particular, for the early Eemian (the pollen zones E1-E4 of Zagwijn 1983, 1996), differences in arrival time of species across the region appear to have been small and the relative chronology is assumed to be the same across the region (Zagwijn 1996; Grichuk 1984; Eriksson 1993).
