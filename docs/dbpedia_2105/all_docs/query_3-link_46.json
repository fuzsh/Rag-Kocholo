        "text": "Description\n\nThis coffee is sourced from a family-owned estate located in the Karatu district, Tanzania. The lowest and highest elevations in all of Africa, the floor of Lake Tanganyika (352 meters below sea level) and Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895 meters above sea level) are both located in Tanzania. The Finagro estate is located between these commanding landmarks, with 250 acres of coffee cultivated on the rim of the Ngorongoro crater, which is the largest unbroken caldera in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. More than 25,000 wild animals, including the largest population of lions, make their home within the crater walls. The Vohora family has owned and managed the Finagro Estate for three generations. Finagro has 450 acres of coffee split between two coffee farms (Ascona and Helgoland), a newly renovated wet-mill, and a dry mill facility, which ensures quality control and traceability throughout the entire process. The farms are also well diversified with more than 120 bee hives for honey production, Macadamia tree nursery producing more than 10,000 seedlings per year and an agroforestry program. Finagro has 50 full-time employees and nearly 500 people employed during the peak of the harvest.\n\nAdditional information\n\nWeight 0.75 lbs Type of Grind\n\nWhole Bean, Coarse, Drip, Fine"
