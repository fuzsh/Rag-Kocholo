        "text": "For most of prehistory, global sea level was lower than today. Important events in human development, such as hominin dispersals during the Pleistocene Ice Age, the recolonization of formerly glaciated terrain, and the spread of agriculture took place on landscapes that are now, at least partially, underwater. Submerged sites can offer preservation conditions rarely encountered on land. With advances in underwater exploration technology, many submerged landscapes have become accessible to archaeologists, and there is growing awareness of the potential for underwater archaeology to transform our knowledge of the human past. This volume highlights the widespread occurrence of submerged prehistoric sites and demonstrates the exceptional diversity of well-preserved material to be found underwater around the world. The 25 peer-reviewed contributions from leading authors cover the results of recent research on three continents and the approaches and techniques applied to site discovery, i...\n\nIn this paper we assess the potential for the survival and investigation of submerged prehistoric sites and cultural landscapes in the eastern Adriatic. We review previous underwater prehistoric finds from the region and evaluate their significance. Most of these finds were made in shallow water close inshore and likely date to the Neolithic–Early Bronze Age. We discuss the reasons for this pattern and for the concentration of finds along the Istrian and Dalmatian coasts. The prospects for finding submerged sites belonging to earlier periods of prehistory are discussed, with emphasis on the crucial period between 7000 and 5500 cal BC during which farming and herding supplanted hunting, fishing, and gathering as the dominant modes of subsistence. Against this background, we present a research design for a multidisciplinary study of submerged landscapes around one of the larger islands of the Zadar archipelago. It is suggested that some important questions of the processes and timing of the transition to farming around the Adriatic Basin may only be answered through the investigation of the continental shelf, and that such research can also contribute to a better understanding of Holocene sea-level and coastal change. Keywords: eastern Adriatic, sea-level rise, submerged cultural landscapes, Mesolithic–Neolithic transition\n\nResearch Infrastructure for Systematic Study of the Prehistoric Archaeology of the European Submerged Continental Shelf. The slow but accelerating accumulation of data defining the sea-level changes, palaeoclimate, subaerial terrestrial soils, river drainage patterns, coastal marshes and peats, combined with properly controlled mapping and excavation of submerged archaeological strata in several locations, has encouraged the view that it is now possible to attempt a systematic analysis of the prehistory of the whole continental shelf, which can be integrated with prehistory on land. Such an endeavour will take many years to produce substantial results, and the foundations and preparations must be sufficiently robust to support a consistent accumulation of new data over this timescale. The present chapter reviews briefly the infrastructural conditions needed, and focuses on the exploitation of existing data already archived and the derivation of practical information for planning and...\n\nIn spite of Spain’s long coastline (nearly 8000 km) and its well-established tradition in underwater archaeology, the prehistoric settlement of the continental shelf is practically unknown with very few finds. Underwater research has focused on naval archaeology and, until very recently, no attempt had been made to look for prehistoric sites. In the past decade, new research projects have been launched to explore selected areas on the Cantabrian shelf and offshore of Gibraltar . This chapter summarizes the currently available evidence of submerged prehistoric archaeology and the preliminary results of these new projects.\n\nThe European continental shelf which was exposed subaerially for most of the last one million years was occupied by a fauna and flora which included, at different dates, hominins and anatomically modern humans. Over 2500 submerged prehistoric sites are known. This report considers the value that archaeological study of these sites and the associated landscape would provide, and shows the positive interaction between study of climate change, glacial research, palaeo-oceanography, and archaeology."
