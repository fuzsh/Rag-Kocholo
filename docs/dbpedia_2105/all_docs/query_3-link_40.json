        "text": "It is one of the largest energy transition projects in Europe: Our âHe Dreihtâ wind farm is being built around 85 kilometers northwest of Borkum and around 110 kilometers west of Helgoland. It is scheduled to go into commercial operation in 2025. With an output of up to 960 megawatts, it will supply 1.1 million households with green energy in purely mathematical terms.\n\nLearn more\n\nBetween upswing and downturn\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, wind energy experienced its first upswing, supported by state subsidies. However, a lack of public acceptance and planning and supply security make it difficult for the industry. The first Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) comes into force in 2000 - an important step for the energy transition. More and more wind farms are being built in Germany - such as our plants in Westerheim, Schnittlingen, Eppenrod and DÃ¼sedau in 2001 and 2002.\n\nOnshore wind farm of superlatives\n\nToday, numerous EnBW wind farms are located in the north of Germany â where the most wind can be harvested. Our Buchholz wind farm in the Heidekreis district of Lower Saxony has been in operation since 2009. It originally consisted of 18 turbines, but was expanded to a total of 24 wind turbines in two further construction phases in 2012 and 2017. This makes it one of the largest EnBW wind farms.\n\nNuclear phase-out and energy transition\n\n22,200 wind turbines were in operation in Germany in 2011, contributing 8 percent to the energy mix. Following the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Germany decided to accelerate its nuclear phase-out â and with it a comprehensive change in generation. One thing is certain: Wind power will play an important role in our energy mix in the future.\n\nExpansion is under way\n\nAalen-Waldhausen, BÃ¼hlertann, DÃ¼nsbach, Goldboden-Winterbach, Rosenberg: These are just a few of our numerous wind farms that are being built over the next few years. This is often the case after long project planning and construction phases, as the requirements from environmental protection to monument protection are high. In Langenburg, we are testing innovative safety lighting with radar technology that only activates when aircraft are approaching: this reduces light smog.\n\nWind farm at an altitude of 1,000 meters\n\nA wind farm with two wind turbines is being built north of the municipality of HÃ¤usern in the district of Waldshut. The location is the GieÃbacher Kopf, a forested mountain ridge which, due to its elevation of more than 1,000 meters, has a high wind potential. The wind farm is currently EnBWâs turbine at the highest altitude.\n\nFirst repowering project\n\nIn the area of the Hanseatic town of Osterburg in Saxony-Anhalt, we are carrying out our first repowering at the DÃ¼sedau wind farm, which has been in existence since 2003. We are completely dismantling the five old wind turbines with a hub height of 70 meters and a total installed capacity of 7.5 megawatts and replacing them with four 169-meter-high turbines with a total installed capacity of 22.4 megawatts.\n\nCast off for Baltic 1\n\nWe are writing offshore history and starting construction of the first commercial wind farm in Germany in the Baltic Sea, Baltic 1. On April 3 at around 10:00 a.m., the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel takes the almost 50-megawatt wind farm into operation. With 21 turbines, located around 16 kilometers north of the DarÃ/Zingst peninsula, we can cover the electricity needs of 50,000 households in one year. This allows us to save 167,000 tons of COâ. And yet, who would have thought back then that we would continuously surpass every other one of our wind farm projects in terms of output and area from now on?\n\nSecond Baltic Sea wind farm: Baltic 2\n\nJust two years after the commissioning of Baltic 1, the foundations for a second wind farm in the Baltic Sea can already be seen: EnBW Baltic 2. In 2015, the former CEO Frank Mastiaux opens the wind farm - from the museum ship Gorch Fock 1. Baltic 2 generates five times more power than its predecessor and can produce electricity for around 340,000 households in purely mathematical terms.\n\nAt the same time, we turn our attention to the North Sea and secure another offshore project in 2014: EnBW Albatros, 105 kilometers north of Borkum and northwest of Helgoland.\n\nWe show that things are turning around\n\nIn the first German tender for an offshore wind farm project, EnBW secures the contract for the EnBW He Dreiht (Low German: âIt is turningâ) wind farm in the North Sea. And it really is bringing more movement into the industry: The offshore wind farm is one of the first projects without feed-in subsidies â in other words, it will operate without state support, will not receive any feed-in tariffs under the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) and can be refinanced thanks to long-term purchase agreements.\n\nFloating technology for deep waters\n\nTogether with the US company Trident Winds, EnBW establishes a joint venture to realize the 650-1,000-megawatts Morro Bay offshore wind project on the Californian coast. It explores so-called floating technology: Floating offshore wind turbines will soon make foundations in the seabed obsolete. In this way, wind power can also be produced in the deeper waters of the US West Coast.\n\nBenefiting from the North Sea breeze: Hohe See and Albatros\n\nIn order to increase the share of renewable energies in our generation capacity to 40 percent by 2020 â more than twice as much as in 2012 â EnBW is becoming active with two further offshore parks in the North Sea. Built at a cost of 2.2 billion euros, the total of 87 turbines covering an area of 53 square kilometers with a total output of more than 600 megawatts were connected to the grid at the beginning of 2020. That is enough for 710,000 households. EnBW Hohe See and EnBW Albatros are located close to each other and share a common infrastructure for maintenance and supply. EnBW opens offices in Taipei, New Jersey and Boston for international offshore projects.\n\n\"NezzyÂ²\": A wind turbine learns how to swim\n\nWith our NezzyÂ² project, we are continuing to investigate how wind turbines can be used in coastal regions with greater water depths. Together with partners, we are developing the prototype of a floating wind turbine. After an approximately 20-meter-high 1:10 scale model has been tested in the Baltic Sea, the full-size plant is finally to go into test operation off the coast of China.\n\nOffshore commitment across borders\n\nEnBW is continuously expanding its offshore expertise and is also establishing its international reputation. Together with bp, we are awarded the contract for three wind farms with a total capacity of 5.9 gigawatts at land auctions in the UK. Project names: Mona, Morgan and Morven - in the Irish Sea and on the east coast of Scotland.\n\nWe are handing over our offshore activities in the USA to TotalEnergies, a French multi-energy company, in order to focus more strongly on the European market.\n\nA new era in sight\n\nApril 15, 2023 at 11:59 p.m.: Block II of the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant (GKN II) is taken off the grid as planned, bringing the era of German nuclear power to an end. In the same year, we reaffirm our commitment to wind power with the final investment decision for EnBW He Dreiht. This means its construction phase can begin.\n\nHe Dreiht is connected to the grid\n\nOur largest offshore project to date is scheduled to go into operation in 2025 with 64 wind turbines and a total output of 960 megawatts, which is expected to supply over one million households. This makes He Dreiht one of the leading energy transition projects in Europe; it will be able to produce more megawatts in itself than our four existing wind farms combined.\n\nScotland, ahoy!\n\nOnly a short time after the wind farms in the Irish Sea, EnBW is planning to develop the Scottish Sea in 2030. We expect the Morven wind farm to be taken into operation there in 2030, with construction scheduled for 2026/2027. Together, the three wind farms Morven, Mona and Morgan can supply around 6 million households with green electricity over a total area of 1,660 square kilometers.\n\nAiming for more than 50 percent wind power\n\nAccording to the Frauenhofer Institute's forecast, Germany will obtain more than half (51.8 percent) of its electricity mix from wind power in 2050. We want to make a significant contribution to this with our offshore projects: Our wind energy capacities are set to increase to 4,000 megawatts by 2025 - this would not be possible without the EnBW offshore wind farms.\n\nWe have our roots in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and are continuing to expand our market-leading position here. We are also active with various subsidiaries and partnerships throughout Germany and in selected foreign markets, including France, Sweden, the UK and Turkey. Our extensive project pipeline shows this: We continue to focus on growth â onshore and offshore."
