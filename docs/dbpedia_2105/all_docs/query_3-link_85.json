At first the work was funded by the Department of Education and Science through the Natural Environment Research Council. Since the mid 1970s the Department of Energy has provided the greater part of the funds. Two principal programmes have been undertaken, namely hydrocarbon studies and regional mapping. This report is a product of the latter programme. In the regional mapping programme systematic surveys of the UK Continental Shelf were carried out by BGS, leading to the preparation and publication of a major series of geological and geophysical maps at 1 :250 000 scale and a series of UK Offshore Regional Reports. This report describes the geology of that part of the north-west European continental shelf which comprises the UK sector of the Southern North Sea Basin. It is an area where, since the early 1960s, there has been considerable exploration for hydrocarbons. The report has been compiled from information derived from published scientific literature, released hydrocarbon wells, and data collected during the BGS regional mapping programme.\n\nThe report will be of interest to all geologists and students of the subject who are seeking a general account of the geology of this economically important area.\n\nPeter J Cook, DSc.

The northern limit lies at latitude 55°N, and the southern limit is marked by a line drawn from near South Foreland on the coast of England to meet the median line in the direction of Calais on the French coast (Figure 1). The report area therefore extends from the Dogger Bank in the north to the Dover Strait in the south, an area of considerable importance to the UK economy. Up to 13 million tonnes per annum of sand and gravel are being dredged from the sea floor (Ardus and Harrison, 1990), and the many gasfields are currently producing about 29 billion cubic metres of gas per annum (Department of Energy, 1990). Proven gas reserves ensure that the southern North Sea will be a major gas-producing area well into the 21st century.\n\nMuch of the report area lies within the shallow-water, southern embayment of the North Sea (Figure 1). To the south of 53°N, water depths are generally less than 50 m, and the sea bed shows a range of features including sand waves up to 16 m high. Between about 53° and 54°N, a wide area of shallow water extends north-eastwards from the Norfolk coast to the median line. Numerous tidal sand ridges up to 40 m in amplitude and between 20 and 60 km in length occur in this shallow area, where the crests of the largest ridges rise to less than 10 m below sea level. Elsewhere in this shallow-water area, a gently undulating sea floor is locally incised by narrow deeps such as Sole Pit, Markham's Hole and the Silver Pit. The latter is the deepest in the report area, with water up to 98 m deep, that is, almost 80 m below the surrounding sea bed.\n\nThe Dogger Bank consists of a variable thickness of Holocene sands reworked from glacial deposits, and its highest point is less than 15 m below sea level. To the south of the Dogger Bank is the east–west-trending Outer Silver Pit, that was created shortly after the last glaciation. Between the Dogger Bank and the English coast, the sea floor undulates gently, and is mostly 40 to 80 m below sea level. Two systems of moribund tidal sand ridges up to 25 m in height occur to the south-west of the Dogger Bank.\n\nAlong the east coast of England, strata of Permian to Cretaceous age occur in the north, whereas in the south, Cretaceous to Tertiary sediments crop out or are buried beneath less than 100 m of Quaternary deposits (Figure 2). To the north of Flamborough Head, coastal erosion of resistant Permian limestones, Jurassic sandstones and limestones, and Upper Cretaceous chalk has created a mainly rocky coastline with many high sea cliffs (see front cover). South of Flamborough Head, the south Yorkshire coastline is formed by lower cliffs cut into late Pleistocene glacial deposits. By contrast, the coastline between the Humber Estuary and The Wash is generally low lying and sandy, with sea walls to protect many parts from inundation and erosion during severe storms. Much of the East Anglian coast is formed of stretches of cliffs cut into Pleistocene marine, fluvial and glacial deposits, separated by low-lying areas with marshes. Tertiary deposits crop out in places on the topographically subdued coasts of the Thames Estuary, and in the extreme south of the area, the sea cliffs of North Foreland and South Foreland are composed of chalk.\n\nOffshore research\n\nBefore the search for hydrocarbons began in the 1960s, there was comparatively little information on the pre-Holocene geology of the southern North Sea. Early reconnaissance surveys (Donovan, 1963; Donovan and Dingle, 1965; Donovan, 1968; Dingle, 1971) established that many of the Mesozoic formations exposed in the sea cliffs of north-east England continue at the sea bed, or are buried beneath only a thin cover of Quaternary sediments, for up to 100 km offshore. These early surveys enabled the near-surface expression of some of the more deep-seated geological structures to be mapped. Elsewhere, the Mesozoic formations are mantled by an eastward-thickening wedge of Tertiary and Quaternary sediments (Figure 3), so that early attempts at determining the regional structure relied on gravity and aeromagnetic surveys (Collette, 1960; Donovan, 1963; Fleischer, 1963; Cook, 1965). These geophysical methods established the configuration of the principal sedimentary basins, and revealed the presence of halokinetic structures.\n\nSince 1964, more than a thousand wells have been drilled to a maximum depth of 5000 m, and many hundred thousand kilometres of digitally recorded seismic-reflection data have been acquired by companies exploring for hydrocarbons beneath the southern North Sea. Following the pioneering work of Kent (1967), the information collected during these surveys has resulted in the publication of many hundreds of papers describing various aspects of the geology. Consequently, the structural setting and stratigraphy of the Late Carboniferous to Tertiary succession has been well established for the area north of 52°30′N. Only three wells have penetrated pre-Carboniferous strata, but the interpretation of deep-seismic reflection surveys shot and processed for the British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) has provided some information on the deeper geological structure of the area (Blundell et al.. 1991).\n\nMuch of the exploration database remains unpublished, but some is available for scientific research because Acts of Parliament require those companies licensed to explore for hydrocarbons on the UK Continental Shelf to provide the Secretary of State for Energy with copies of all geophysical and well data acquired during their exploration programmes (Brooks, 1983; Walmsley, 1983). Under the terms of the Acts, all well data are released by the Department of Energy five years after receipt by the Secretary of State (Fannin, 1989).\n\nThe search for hydrocarbons has yielded only limited information on the near-surface Tertiary and Quaternary geology of the offshore area. BGS (British Geological Survey, previously the Institute of Geological Sciences, IGS) carried out shallow geological surveys of the Humber Estuary (McQuillin et al., 1969) and The Wash (Wingfield et al., 1978) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1979, IGS was commissioned by the Department of Energy to complete a reconnaissance geological survey of the whole of the UK Continental Shelf using geophysical techniques, sea-bed sampling, and drilling (Fannin, 1989). The survey of the southern North Sea was carried out between 1979 and 1984, and has resulted in the production of maps of the solid and Quaternary geology, sea-bed sediments, Bouguer gravity anomaly and aeromagnetic anomaly at a scale of 1:250 000 (see inside back cover). In the report area, those maps which straddle the median line have been published jointly with the Rijks Geologische Dienst (Geological Survey of The Netherlands) and the Belgische Geologische Dienst (Geological Survey of Belgium). The BGS traps are based on the interpretation of more than 23 000 km of shallow-seismic data, calibrated using released commercial well data and the results of 29 rotary-cored shallow boreholes drilled by BGS to a maximum depth of 206 m below sea bed. The surface geology has been sampled by 6 m vibrocorer at 1232 sites, by gravity corer at a further 2284 locations, and by grab at 5814 sites.\n\nGeological summary\n\nMore than 200 years of research into the stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Upper Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic formations of eastern England have provided a valuable basis for interpretation of the offshore deposits. Hydrocarbon exploration and BGS surveys have revealed that the post-Carboniferous sequences in the centre of the Southern North Sea Basin are generally thicker and more complete than those to the west (Figure 3). This is because eastern England and its adjacent offshore area have, since the Carboniferous, been situated largely on the periphery of the basin (Rhys, 1974). Despite this, the geology of the onshore and offshore areas have many features in common; the inverted Cleveland Basin and the East Midlands Shelf continue offshore from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire respectively (Figure 4). The London-Brabant Massif, extending from East Anglia across the Southern Bight of the North Sea into Belgium, was a basin-marginal upland area from Early Carboniferous to early Cretaceous times.\n\nRelatively little is known about the Devonian and older rocks in the area, but the Carboniferous fluviodeltaic, coal-measure and redbed sequences offshore are very similar to those of central and eastern England. They are buried beneath more than 4000 m of Permian, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments in the deepest parts of the Southern North Sea Basin. As in England, these Carboniferous rocks were gently folded and faulted during the Variscan orogeny.\n\nThroughout Permian and Triassic times, most of the southern North Sea lay within a gently subsiding Variscan foreland basin which extended from eastern England through northern Germany into Poland (Ziegler, 1982). Aeolian, fluvial and desert-lake sediments accumulated between the London-Brabant Massif and the Mid North Sea High during the Early Permian. There were five, short-lived, marine transgressions across the basin during the Late Permian, producing a complex sequence of marine and evaporite deposits which are locally more than 1000 m thick. The evaporites have been deforming by halokinesis intermittently since Middle Triassic times, leading to the widespread growth of salt pillows and diapirs across the central offshore area. Triassic sediments are up to 1650 m thick, and dominated by reddish brown mudstones with subsidiary sandstones and evaporites; these were deposited in a range of playa-lake, floodplain, fluvial and quasi-marine environments (Fisher, 1986).\n\nThe fully marine conditions which extended across the southern North Sea late in the Triassic Period have continued intermittently until the present day. The Sole Pit Trough and the Cleveland Basin were the principal depocentres during the Jurassic, accumulating up to 1000 m of marine mudstones with subsidiary sandstones and limestones before undergoing erosion at the end of the Jurassic Period, followed by post-Jurassic inversion (Glennie and Boegner, 1981; Van Hoorn, 1987). The Lower Cretaceous sediments are dominantly argillaceous, and are more than 800 m thick adjacent to contemporary growth faults in the Dowsing Fault Zone.\n\nUpper Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary sediments are all thickest near the UK–Netherlands median line. Upper Cretaceous pelagic carbonates of the Chalk Sea are locally more than 1000 m thick, and following their deposition then: was widespread uplift and regression prior to the deposition of up to 800 m of mainly argillaceous marine sediments during the Palaeogene. Neogene sediments are generally absent due to nondeposition and/or erosion. The early Quaternary was dominated by the north-westward expansion across the southern North Sea of peripheral delta systems from continental Europe, and is now represented by some 600 m of sediment where best developed. Later Pleistocene history has been dominated by glacial erosion and deposition prior to the establishment of the present-day, strongly tidal, marine environment between 7000 and 10 000 years ago.\n\nChapter 2 Crustal structure\n\nCrustal thickness\n\nThe boundary between the Earth's crust and mantle is marked by a major change in seismic velocity from about 7 to 8 km/s; this boundary has become known as the MohoroviÄiÄ Discontinuity, or Moho. It is commonly observed in seismic refraction experiments, and in certain circumstances on deep-seismic reflection sections. Both refraction and reflection data indicate that the base of the crust is at an average depth of 30 ± 5 km beneath the British Isles (Meissner et al., 1986).\n\nThere is only limited seismic information concerning the thickness of the Earth's crust beneath the southern North Sea. On a deep-seismic reflection line shot for BIRPS off Yorkshire (Figure 5) there are numerous, discontinuous, high-amplitude seismic reflectors below 7 s two-way travel time (TWTT). Close to the coast these have a well-defined flat base at between 9.5 and 10 s TWTT (Freeman et al., 1988), deepening to 11 s farther offshore ((Figure 5) and (Figure 6)). Elsewhere in the North Sea, the base of similar lower-crustal reflections has been found to correlate with the Moho as deduced from gravity and refraction data (Donato and Tully, 1981; Barton et al., 1984; Holliger and Klemperer, 1989).\n\nBlundell et al. (1991) have demonstrated that beneath the Mid North Sea High, the reflection Moho coincides with that identified by seismic-refraction methods. Using an average crustal velocity of 6 km/s (Freeman et al., 1988), the reflection-seismic data suggest that the Moho is between 28.5 and 33 km deep east of the Yorkshire coast.\n\nThe lower-crustal reflectors are rather indistinct in the centre of the southern North Sea (Figure 6), but a conspicuous high-amplitude event between 11 and 12 s TWTT may correspond to the reflection Moho. This event appears to be at depths of more than 30 km, perhaps as much as 35 km, and is deepest where the strongly layered and relatively low-velocity sediments are thickest. Gravity modelling (Holliger and Klemperer, 1990) predicts that the base of the crust occurs at 32 ± 2 km in the central offshore area.\n\nOn the southern margin of the North Sea Basin there is a broad zone of lower-crustal reflectors parallel to the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif (Blundell et al., 1991). These reflectors have a well-defined base at almost 11 s TWTT (Figure 7), again recording the reflection Moho at a depth of about 33 km. The reflection Moho is lost southwards beneath the London–Brabant Massif, but to the south of the massif in northern France, it reappears at a depth of about 38 km (Bois et al., 1987).\n\nCrustal structure: the seismic evidence\n\nDeep-seismic reflection sections around the British Isles have produced images of the continental crust which have a number of features in common. The idealised British profile has been referred to by Matthews and Cheadle (1986) as the 'typical BIRP'; in the southern North Sea the reflection sequences off the Yorkshire coast conform most closely to it (Figure 5). Strong reflections from post-Carboniferous sediments occur on this profile down to 1.8 s TWTT, 3 km below sea level. The middle crust, represented by a relatively featureless seismic zone extending down to a depth of about 7 s TWTT, is essentially nonreflective because it includes few significant velocity contrasts, and may contain a structure that is too complex to be imaged. On BIRPS data there are discontinuous, weak, seismic reflectors towards the top of the middle crust above 3 s TWTT. These may image layering within Carboniferous sediments, and are more clearly resolved on commercial deep-seismic profiles across the area. The lower crust is represented by discontinuous, high-amplitude reflectors between 7 and 11 s TWTT. Current hypotheses on the origin of this type of lower-crustal seismic layering suggest that it may represent mafic sills and layered igneous intrusions; extensional and compressional strain-banding and mylonite zones; laminae of hydrated rocks; or fluid-filled cracks (Klemperer, 1989).\n\nThe post-Carboniferous sediments are up to 4 km thick in the centre of the southern North Sea. (Figure 6) illustrates Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments gently folded over northwest-trending Upper Permian salt pillows. Although the reflection Moho is locally clearly defined on the section, there are relatively few seismic events within the lower crust, and there is no clear boundary between the middle and lower crust. It seems that seismic resolution of the lower-crustal structure in this central area is adversely affected by distortion of the seismic wavefront as it passes through the strongly anisotropic, folded sediments of the upper crust.\n\nSedimentary cover upon the London–Brabant Massif is relatively thin. On the deep-seismic section in (Figure 7), the top of the Lower Carboniferous limestones can be traced southwards from 2 s TWTT at its deepest to its subcrop limit beneath Permian and thin Westphalian sediments on the flank of the massif. Stratigraphical relationships demonstrate that this area was already established as a high by Carboniferous times. The lower-crustal structure beneath the massif is mostly masked by high-amplitude, mid-crustal, dipping reflections which can be traced from about 3.5 s to more than 7 s TWTT. Reston and Blundell (1987) have used a network of commercial seismic-reflection profiles to determine that these reflecting surfaces are stacked in an imbricate manner, and dip at 20° towards the south-west. They can be mapped for about 30 km along the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif. Reston and Blundell (1987) have interpreted these reflections as mid-crustal shears which developed to accommodate differential Mesozoic extension along a transitional zone between the stable crust of the massif and the relatively mobile crust beneath the North Sea Basin. Alternatively, they may be relicts of earlier imbricate thrusting initiated during Caledonian compression (Blundell et al., 1991). The reflections themselves may represent litho-logical contrasts or syndeformational magmatism within the shear zones (Blundell et al.. 1991).\n\nShallower, high-amplitude, mid-crustal reflections have been observed dipping at about 30° north-eastwards from 1.9 to 3.8 s TWTT on commercial seismic-reflection profiles adjacent to the north coast of East Anglia. These appear to terminate at depth against the south-westerly dipping imbricate events (Figure 8). Nearby boreholes onshore have proved that the shallow, dipping reflections originate from within folded Lower Palaeozoic turbidites and shales (Pharaoh et al., 1987). Thus they most likely image a thrust zone within a Caledonian fold belt that has been inferred to occur along the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif (Pharaoh et al., 1987).\n\nSeismic and borehole evidence suggests that beneath the sedimentary cover of the London–Brabant Massif lie volcanic and intrusive rocks; these are interbedded with, and intruded into, Lower Palaeozoic basinal sediments, and were deformed within Caledonian shear zones. The deep structure of the massif has affinities with many of the ancient Precambrian cratonic areas of the world (Chadwick et al., 1989). A reflection Moho is absent beneath the North American and Baltic cratons (Brown et al., 1987; Lund and Heikkinen, 1987), and Hirn et al. (1987) have deduced that there is a Precambrian cratonic basement beneath the London–Brabant Massif in northern France, where there are also no lower-crustal reflectors. Basement xenocrysts within Ordovician volcanic rocks in Belgium have been dated as pre-Cadomian in age, at least 870 Ma old (Andre and Deutsch, 1984), and were probably derived from the lower crust.\n\nCrustal structure: the gravity and magnetic evidence\n\nMany of the features on Bouguer gravity-anomaly and the smoothed pseudorelief aeromagnetic anomaly maps of the southern North Sea ((Figure 9) and (Figure 10)) have been produced by post-Carboniferous structures. Despite this, all gravity anomalies are elongated in a north-westerly direction, which is the Precambrian Charnoid structural trend in southern Britain. The sedimentary cover has its greatest thickness in the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin, coinciding with a regional negative gravity anomaly (Figure 9), and with low-amplitude magnetic anomalies which straddle the median line between UK and Dutch waters. The relatively thin sedimentary cover above the London–Brabant Massif is represented by a large positive gravity anomaly extending south-eastwards from East Anglia; the negative gravity anomaly to the south of the massif may indicate a concealed Devonian–Carboniferous sedimentary basin. Two large positive gravity anomalies adjacent to north-east England and north-east of East Anglia (Figure 9) correspond to the mid-Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary basins of the Sole Pit Trough and the Cleveland Basin, which have been inverted. Residual high Bouguer gravity-anomaly values indicate that these sediments are now overcompacted, having been uplifted by between 2 and 2.5 km since Jurassic times (Bulat and Stoker, 1987).\n\nMost of the remaining anomalies have probably been generated by features within the middle crust. One of the most conspicuous is the negative Bouguer gravity anomaly extending offshore from Yorkshire. Donato and Megson (1990) have deduced from gravity modelling that this represents a late Caledonian granite batholith about 140 km long and 40 km wide buried beneath 3 to 4 km of mainly post-Devonian sediments. There may be a smaller, deeply buried granite 130 km to the north; this is one of three separate batholiths postulated by Donato et al. (1983) beneath and adjacent to the Mid North Sea High (Figure 9). The crest of another likely Caledonian batholith which extends offshore from East Anglia beneath The Wash may be less than 1.5 km below sea level (Allsop, 1987).\n\nThe most conspicuous features on the pseudorelief aeromagnetic anomaly map (Figure 10) are the west-north-west trending, discontinuous but markedly linear anomalies that contrast with the magnetically subdued zones associated with the thick sedimentary basins. Two of these anomalies extend up to 150 km off north-east England; the southern anomaly has been correlated by Kirton and Donato (1985) with the Blyth swarm of Tertiary basaltic dykes. Though individual dykes are up to 21 m wide onshore (Land, 1974), they are presumed to be larger or more numerous offshore, as they do not generate a large magnetic anomaly in north-east England (Kirton and Donato, 1985). Along strike to the east-southeast from the Blyth swarm, a group of anomalies passes along the trace of a linear basement fault close to the Murdoch Gasfield. The anomalies could indicate an injection of Tertiary dykes along this line of weakness, but they are relatively low-amplitude features, and intrusions have not been observed on the seismic sections. Another group of magnetic anomalies trends north-north-westwards along the trace of the Dowsing Fault Zone; these are higher-amplitude features, but it is unclear as to whether they represent another swarm of dykes, large-scale mineralisation, or were generated by crustal magnetic anisotropy along this line of basement weakness.\n\nThere is a very large aeromagnetic anomaly extending offshore from Belgium into the south-eastern North Sea (Figure 9). Similar anomalies occur onshore in Belgium where Cambrian or Precambrian, mildly metamorphosed sediments are in the shallow subsurface (Service Geologique de Belgique, 1964; 1968). The amplitude of the magnetic anomaly diminishes north-westwards, suggesting that its source is either absent or more deeply buried beneath the UK sector of the North Sea.\n\nChapter 3 Pre-Carboniferous basement\n\nLower Palaeozoic and Devonian rocks are buried beneath many kilometres of Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments in most of the southern North Sea and eastern England (Figure 11). Geophysical evidence suggests that there may be Precambrian cratonic rocks beneath the London–Brabant Massif (Chapter 2), underlying the Early Palaeozoic basinal-marine sediments that have been penetrated by boreholes on the southern margin of the North Sea Basin. A patchy cover of Devonian alluvial and marine beds exists beneath south-east England, and Upper Devonian fluvial sediments approach to less than 2.5 km below sea level on the southern flank of the Mid North Sea High in the extreme north of the report area, where they have been sampled in one well.\n\nLower Palaeozoic\n\nIn Early Palaeozoic times, the southern North Sea area, Wales, England and Belgium formed part of a late Proterozoic terrane, termed Eastern Avalonia by Soper et al. (1987). By the Early Ordovician, Eastern Avalonia lay 40° to 60° south of the equator (Cocks and Fortey, 1982). The Scottish Highlands formed part of the Laurentian Precambrian shield in equatorial latitudes, that was separated from Eastern Avalonia by many thousands of kilometres of Iapetus Ocean (Harland and Gayer, 1972). Scandinavia lay within the Baltic shield, separated from Eastern Avalonia by the Tornquist Sea, an arm of the Iapetus Ocean until it closed late in Ordovician times (Cocks and Fortey, 1982; Ziegler, 1982).\n\nThe southern North Sea now lies to the south-east of the Iapetus suture, the line of eventual closure of the Iapetus Ocean. Its Lower Palaeozoic basement may comprise mainly basinal-marine and volcaniclastic sediments similar to those in the Lake District and North Wales, and was likewise deformed during the Caledonian orogeny. To the south-west, the Lower Palaeozoic rocks overlying the wedge-shaped Midlands Microcraton (Figure 11) are comparatively unaffected by folding and metamorphism (Pharaoh et al., 1987), and are relatively thin (Smith, 1987). The Midlands Microcraton acted as a foreland to the southern North Sea deformation (Turner, 1949; Smith, 1987).\n\nLower Palaeozoic basinal-marine sediments have been penetrated by two offshore wells on the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif (Figure 11). Well 47/29a-1 terminated in a sequence of 115 m of grey Ordovician turbidites composed of alternating siltstones, silty shales and silica-cemented, very fine-grained, micaceous sandstones. Well 53/16-1 penetrated 229 m of lithologically similar, unfossiliferous, reddened rocks beneath the base of the Carboniferous; these were ascribed to the Lower Devonian by the well-site geologist, but further work has shown that they have closer affinity with the Early Palaeozoic turbidite facies of the London–Brabant Massif.\n\nEarly Palaeozoic, possibly Silurian, turbidite lithologies have been encountered by boreholes in East Anglia at Saxthorpe, Somerton and South Creake (Figure 11). The shales at South Creake have a penetrative slaty cleavage defined by parallel microfractures and calcite veins. The nearby North Creake borehole recorded 60 m of weakly metamorphosed tuffs and agglomerates directly beneath the Triassic. Phemister, in Kent (1947), interpreted these as Precambrian in age, based on their supposed petrographical affinity with the Charnian felsic volcanic suites exposed at Charnwood Forest in the English Midlands (Figure 11). However, Pharaoh et al. (1987) have reported Ordovician Rb-Sr whole-rock ages for comparable volcanic rocks lying between Charnwood Forest and East Anglia, and geochemical evidence supports their inference that the North Creake rocks are Ordovician (Pharaoh et al., 1991). Precambrian rocks in the shallow subsurface are therefore likely to be confined to the Midlands Microcraton. Le Bas (1972) has speculated that calcalkaline suites of Ordovician volcanic rocks are abundant in the subsurface of the London–Brabant Massif from Wales through central England and East Anglia to Belgium.\n\nLower. Palaeozoic sediments may be many kilometres thick beneath the southern North Sea, and their base is not defined on deep-seismic sections. Shallow-marine and basinal Cambrian to Lower Ordovician sediments are more than 3000 m thick on the southern flank of the London–Brabant Massif in Belgium (Walter, 1980), and may be similarly thick at the base of the Lower Palaeozoic sequence beneath the Dover Strait. Pharaoh et al. (1987) have shown that the metamorphic glade of the Lower Palaeozoic basement increases from diagenetic conditions in the English Midlands, to lower greenschist facies in the vicinity of The Wash. Higher metamorphic grades are likely to be represented in the centre of the southern North Sea. Lower Palaeozoic rocks have a north-westerly trending structural grain in East Anglia (Turner, 1949; Smith, 1987; Pharaoh et al., 1987). If the trends of the Variscan faults in the offshore area have been influenced by the structural grain of the basement, Caledonian deformation will have mainly west-north-west and north-west trends beneath the southern North Sea.\n\nDevonian\n\nBy the Devonian, the closure of the Iapetus Ocean had welded together northern and southern lithospheric plates to form a Laurasian 'Old Red Sandstone' continent (Anderton et al., 1979). Within this continent, interior drainage basins such as the Midland Valley of Scotland accumulated thick, post-orogenic, molasse sequences, mainly by denudation of adjacent Caledonian mountain chains. Coastal plains around the southern margin of the continent in southern Ireland, South Wales and southern England accumulated relatively thin sequences of alluvial sediments (Anderton et al., 1979).\n\nLower Devonian sediments have not been recorded from the Northumberland Trough in northern England (House et al., 1977), and are unlikely to be extensive in the northern part of the report area. Seismic-reflection evidence suggests that younger Devonian sediments may be more than 1000 km thick adjacent to the Mid North Sea High. Farther south, those wells which have penetrated through the base of the Carboniferous on the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif have not recorded Devonian sediments overlying the Early Palaeozoic basement (Figure 12). It seems likely that the Devonian sediments have a thin and patchy distribution over most of the central and southern offshore area.\n\nOn seismic sections running through the site of well 44/2-1, a strong and continuous reflector occurs about 900 m beneath the top of the Devonian. A similarly continuous, high-amplitude reflector at the Argyll Oilfield of the central North Sea images marine, Middle Devonian dolomites with shales and a thick, fossiliferous limestone (Pennington, 1975). Ziegler (1982) suggested that these sediments were deposited in a temporary embayment of the Proto-Tethys Ocean of northern Europe, along a line adopted later by the Central Graben of the North Sea. If the southern North Sea seismic reflector is imaging an equivalent sequence of marine carbonate deposits, then the Middle Devonian seas may have extended around the south-eastern flank of the Mid North Sea High (Figure 12).\n\nFluvial sediments were deposited extensively over the crest and southern flank of the Mid North Sea High, at least during Late Devonian times; these may be continuous with Upper Devonian sediments in the Northumberland Trough, which were deposited in a palaeodrainage system directed eastwards towards the North Sea (Simon and Bluck, 1982).\n\nUpper Devonian rocks have been penetrated by only one off-shore well in the report area, well 44/2-1 (Figure 12) which terminated in a 58 m-thick sequence of Famennian alluvial sandstones and shales. Nearby well 38/29-1 proved a minimum of 352 m of Late Devonian, fine-grained, red, fluvial sandstones with bands of medium- and coarse-grained, pebbly sandstone and red or brown, micaceous shales. Three other wells which penetrated through the base of the Carboniferous on the crest of the Mid North Sea High (Figure 12) have recorded similar facies of probable Late Devonian age.\n\nAllsop (1985) has used borehole and geophysical data to map the extent of two Middle to Late Devonian basins overlying the crest and southern flank of the London–Brabant Massif in East Anglia and south-east England (Figure 12). There may be up to 1400 m of Devonian sediments in the larger southern basin, which Bouguer gravity-anomaly values suggest may extend beneath the Dover Strait. The Devonian sediments in this southern province are dominantly alluvial, but spores obtained from some boreholes indicate that there may have been marine incursions into south-east England during the Middle Devonian (House et al., 1977).\n\nChapter 4 Post-Devonian basin development\n\nThe geology of the southern North Sea is the result of a long and complex history of basinal subsidence, punctuated by discrete episodes of uplift and widespread erosion during end-Silurian, Late Carboniferous, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and mid-Tertiary times. These crustal movements can he identified across much of north-west Europe, and structural contours on the top of the Carboniferous (Figure 13) illustrate their net effect. The main area of subsidence has been the Anglo-Dutch Basin.\n\nLower Palaeozoic sediments are likely to be many kilometres thick beneath most or all of the southern North Sea. They were mildly deformed and intruded by granite batholiths during the Caledonian orogeny of Late Silurian to Early Devonian times, but the effects of this deformation offshore are deeply buried beneath thick sequences of Late Palaeozoic and younger sediments. Nevertheless, the dominant west-north-westerly and north-westerly trends of the faults displacing these sediments may he inherited from the structural grain of the Early Palaeozoic basement.\n\nCarboniferous\n\nFollowing Caledonian uplift, most of the southern North Sea remained an upland area of net erosion in Devonian times. It lay on the southern margin of the supercontinent formed by the collision of the Laurentian and Fennoscandian landmasses. Crustal extension initiated the break-up of this part of the supercontinent early in the Carboniferous by forming zones of rapidly subsiding grabens and half-grabens; these are separated by horsts on which condensed sequences of sediments accumulated (Leeder, 1982; Grayson and Oldham, 1987). The London–Brabant Massif became established as a stable upland area early in the Dinantian, and formed the southern boundary of the Southern North Sea Basin until mid-Cretaceous times. Up to 4000 m of deep-water or deltaic sediments were deposited in the Dinantian grabens, whereas some of the horsts remained as positive features until late in the Dinantian. The positions of the horsts and subsiding basins in northern England have been relatively well established, and it appears that some of the most persistent highs there were kept buoyant by their Caledonian granite cores (Bott, 1967). The Dinantian palaeogeography of the southern North Sea is less well known, but some or all of the granite batholiths inferred from their Bouguer gravity anomalies (Figure 9) may lie beneath Early Carboniferous horsts. Bott (1987) has calculated that the grabens and horsts of northern England were formed by between 5 and 10 per cent extension of the uppermost crust during the Early Carboniferous, although there may have been as much as 19 per cent extension across the Northumberland Trough (Kimbell et al., 1989). The ductile lower crust may have stretched by around 20 per cent to accommodate the regional Dinantian subsidence (Bott, 1987).\n\nLeeder (1982, 1987) has invoked a transition from lithospheric extension to thermal subsidence to account for the establishment of relatively uniform, deltaic sedimentary facies across northern and central England by mid-Namurian times. These deltaic facies also extend across the southern North Sea, where Upper Carboniferous sediments are locally more than 3000 m thick. Bott (1987) pointed our that thermal subsidence alone cannot account For the much greater thickness of Upper Carboniferous than underlying Dinantian sediments in parts of northern England. Instead, he suggested that crustal extension continued spasmodically until at least Duckmantian (Westphalian B) times. Stratigraphical evidence contradicts this, and suggests that if there was continuing crustal extension, it was largely confined to the lower crust.\n\nFrom mid-Westphalian times, sedimentation in the southern North Sea was increasingly affected by the approach of the Variscan deformation front from the south (Besly, 1988). Regional uplift caused the poorly drained, deltaic facies to be superseded by better-drained, alluvial-plain sediments. Contemporary uplift of the London–Brabant Massif is indicated by mid-Westphalian unconformities on both its southern and northern flanks (Ramsbottom et al., 1978; Tubb et al., 1986).\n\nDuring the Variscan orogeny, the southern North Sea formed a foreland area close to the Variscan mountains that stretched from south-west England through France into eastern Europe. Differential Late Carboniferous and Early Permian uplift accompanied by peneplanation of the Foreland led to the erosion of more than 1500 m of Upper Carboniferous sediments from those areas of the southern North Sea where Namurian or Dinantian rocks underlie the base-Permian unconformity. On a regional scale, the pre-Permian subcrop map (see Figure 18) demonstrates that transgression associated with north–south compression imposed mainly west-north-westerly trending Variscan structures in the south and west of the offshore area. In the east-central part of the report area, Bolsovian (Westphalian C) and Westphalian D sediments are preserved in north-northwest-trending Variscan synclines, whereas Variscan structures are mainly aligned east–west along the southern flank of the Mid North Sea High and in northern England.\n\nPermian to Jurassic\n\nFollowing cessation of Variscan compression, the southern North Sea began to subside once more during the Early Permian. Most of the area lies within a Variscan foreland, postorogenic-collapse basin which, until Late Triassic times, extended from eastern England through northern Germany into Poland (Ziegler, 1982). The Pennine High (Figure 4) became a positive feature for the first time during the Early Permian, separating this north European basin from a contemporary Irish Sea basin. The London–Brabant Massif continued to form the southern boundary of the Southern North Sea Basin. The Mid North Sea High formed its northern boundary and accumulated condensed sequences of Permian and Triassic sediments.\n\nMore than 2700 m and perhaps as much as 3000 m of sediments were deposited in the centre of the southern North Sea during the Permian and Triassic. Isopachs of these sediments (see Chapters 6 to 8) demonstrate that the Sole Pit Trough temporarily became an important depocentre within the Variscan foreland basin during the Early Permian, and then more continuously from mid-Triassic times. Increased Early Permian subsidence in the trough was initiated by late Variscan wrench reactivation of its basement faults in an east–west-oriented, transtensional stress regime (Glennie and Boegner, 1981). The Cleaver Bank High and the northern part of the East Midlands Shelf (Figure 13) formed contemporary intrabasinal highs, but the isopachs of the Lower Permian sediments may to some extent be imaging a relict post-Variscan topography.\n\nThere are no indications of differential intrabasinal subsidence in the isopachs of the Upper Permian or basal Triassic formations (Chapters 7 and 8). In mid-Triassic times, the Sole Pit Trough was reactivated as a depocentre and extended temporarily around the northern flank of the East Midlands Shelf. Contemporary uplift of peripheral source areas caused the coarse-grained, elastic deposits of the Bunter Sandstone Formation to spread rapidly across the offshore area (Fisher, 1986). These source areas were quickly peneplaned, and the Upper Triassic sequence is dominated by argillaceous sediments.\n\nOutside the report area, Late Triassic and Early Jurassic crustal extension led to the development of the Viking and Central grabens along the central axis of the North Sea (Ziegler, 1982) in response to regional east–west transtensional stress. There is a rise in the Moho beneath both of these graben systems, but the reflection Moho beneath the southern North Sea has a generally flat disposition, indicating that there was only limited contemporary crustal extension here. Glennie and Boegner (1981) have instead related the enhanced subsidence of the Sole Pit Trough to renewed wrench reactivation of its Variscan basement faults in this east–west transtensional stress regime. These tectonic movements triggered the earliest, mid-Triassic halokinesis of the Upper Permian salts in the centre of the offshore area (Brunstrom and Walmsley, 1969).\n\nFully marine conditions were established in the southern North Sea and in most of northern Europe at the end of the Triassic Period, as crustal extension along the central axis of the North Sea allowed the Tethys Ocean to link to the Boreal Ocean for the first time (Ziegler, 1982). In the southern North Sea, differential subsidence of the Sole Pit Trough was accentuated by the development of growth faults along its western margin. These remained active until Middle Jurassic times, and account for the major thickness and facies changes of the Lower and Middle Jurassic sediments between the Sole Pit Trough and the East Midlands Shelf. Simultaneously, the Cleveland Basin became established as a new depocentre in east Yorkshire (Kent, I980a), linking offshore to the Sole Pit Trough around the north of the East Midlands Shelf. The London–Brabant Massif had retained positive relief throughout the Permo-Triassic, but by Early Jurassic times had reduced in size sufficiently for sedimentation to resume on its southern flank.\n\nAlong the central axis of the North Sea, subsidence related to crustal extension beneath the major graben systems was superseded in Middle Jurassic times by domal uplift and widespread erosion. In the southern North Sea, this resulted in an erosional surface commonly referred to as the late-Cimmerian Unconformity. More than 1000 m, and perhaps as much as 2000 m of Jurassic and Triassic strata were eroded from the Cleaver Bank High at this rime (Glennie, 1986a). Several hundred metres of sediments were eroded from the southern part of the Sole Pit Trough towards the end of the Jurassic (Glennie and Boegner, 1981), whereas sedimentation was continuous on the nearby East Midlands Shelf (Kent, 1980a). The increased tectonic activity and destabilising of the overburden triggered a widespread pulse of diapirism in the southern and western parts of the Permian halite basin (Glennie, 1986b).\n\nIsopachs of Upper Jurassic sediments (see (Figure 72)) demonstrate that the East Midlands Shelf replaced the Sole Pit Trough as the principal depocentre before the end of the Jurassic; up to 350 m of marine sediments were deposited there during the Late Jurassic.\n\nCretaceous to Quaternary\n\nBy Late Jurassic times, regional doming along the central axis of the North Sea had been superseded by renewed rifting and rapid subsidence within its major graben systems. More widespread, but gentle subsidence allowed marine sedimentation to resume across most of the southern North Sea early in Cretaceous times. The Lower Cretaceous sediments are typically less than 200 m thick, but growth faulting (Kirby and Swallow, 1987) enabled accumulation of up to 1000 m of mainly argillaceous sediments in parts of the Vale of Pickering–Flamborough Head Fault Zone (Figure 13). Similarly, about 1000 m of Lower Cretaceous sediments are present locally within the Dowsing Fault Zone. Conversely, contemporary uplift caused erosion of up to 200 m of basal Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic sediments in the adjacent northern part of the East Midlands Shelf (Kent, 1980a). These observations demonstrate that sinistral transcurrent crustal movements occurred within and beneath the fault zones during Early Cretaceous times (Kirby and Swallow, 1987). South of the London–Brabant Massif, the Weald Basin was subsiding rapidly, and there may be more than 800 m of Early Cretaceous alluvial, lagoonal and lacustrine sediments beneath Kent and the Dover Strait.\n\nLithospheric extension and localised rifting along the central axis of the North Sea finally ceased around the middle of the Cretaceous Period, to be replaced by thermal subsidence and gentle, regional, crustal downwarping (Barton and Wood, 1984).\n\nA contemporary global rise in sea level allowed pelagic carbonate sedimentation to extend across most of the southern North Sea in the Late Cretaceous. The London–Brabant Massif was submerged for the first time since the early Palaeozoic, though the Upper Cretaceous sediments of the Chalk Group are markedly condensed over its crest. Local transpression caused some areas at the southern end of the Dowsing Fault Zone to retain positive relief until near the end of the Cretaceous (Glennie and Boegner, 1981), although local transtension farther north along the same fault zone allowed more than 800 m of chalky limestones to accumulate close to active growth faults. Hancock and Scholle (1975) have demonstrated that the Sole Pit Trough was a zone of relatively slow subsidence. The Cleaver Bank High, which had been subsiding since the Early Cretaceous, was established as the main depocentre in the offshore area, and accumulated more than 1000 m of Upper Cretaceous sediments. The Chalk Group is similarly thick in rim synclines between contemporaneously active salt swells, and is strongly condensed over the crests of these swells.\n\nA major phase of basin inversion during, or at the end of, the Late Cretaceous affected many basins in north-west Europe (Ziegler, 1987), including the Sole Pit Trough and Cleveland Basin (Glennie and Boegner, 1981; Kent, 1980a ; Van Hoorn, 1987). In the southern North Sea, erosion was less widespread than during the Late Jurassic regional uplift, although there is uncertainty as to the amount and precise timing of uplift of the inverted basins, for the original thickness of Cretaceous sediments is unknown. Kent (1980a) used stratigraphical evidence to demonstrate that the Cleveland Basin was inverted by between 0.5 and 1.3 km at this time. The Sole Pit Trough has been inverted by between 1.2 and 1.8 km since the Early Cretaceous (Marie, 1975), but some of this may have taken place during mid-Tertiary regional uplift of the south-western North Sea (Bulat and Stoker. 1987). Whatever its amount, the Late Cretaceous inversion in the southern North Sea can be interpreted as resulting from a phase of regional compression that reactivated basement faults by sinistral strike-slip. The displacements along individual faults were very small, and have been likened by Glennie and Boegner (1981, p. 119) to 'deformation of a rectangle into a parallelogram by movement along closely spaced parallel lines'.\n\nAn unconformity separates the Chalk Group from overlying Palaeogene sediments across almost all of the southern North Sea. This unconformity was caused by widespread uplift and marine regression from the British Isles and much of the surrounding continental shelf around the end of the Cretaceous Period. Jenyon (1984) has demonstrated that karstic topography became established at the top of the Chalk Group over large areas off East Anglia.\n\nTertiary and Quaternary subsidence in the North Sea has been dominated by broad, synclinal downwarping towards a depositional axis that extends from the Viking Graben through the Central Graben towards The Netherlands (Parker, 1975; Caston, 1977). Because of this, the depocentres for the major Cenozoic sedimentary units in the southern North Sea lie in Dutch waters. The Palaeogene sequence comprises up to 800 m of dominantly argillaceous, marine sediments.\n\nA second phase of tectonic activity affected the southern North Sea in Oligocene to Miocene times. Many of the basement faults were reactivated by dextral strike-slip (Glennie and Boegner, 1981), which triggered another major phase of halokinetic activity (Van Hoorn, 1987). Most of the salt swells and pillows north of 54°N were initiated in mid-Tertiary times. Seismic interpretation suggests that contemporary regional uplift of the western half of the offshore area caused erosion of between 200 and 400 m of Palaeogene sediments from the inverted Sole Pit Trough. Glennie (1986a) has related this deformation to regional north–south compression caused by continental convergence and collision during the Alpine orogeny. South of the London–Brabant Massif, the Weald Basin was also inverted by Alpine compression during the Oligocene and Miocene (Lake and Karner, 1987).\n\nThere are very few Miocene deposits, and only local outliers of Pliocene sediments, in the UK sector of the southern North Sea. Subsidence and sedimentation became more widespread early in the Quaternary; up to 600 m of lower and middle Pleistocene sediments record the progressive north-westward expansion of peripheral delta systems across the southern North Sea (Cameron et al., 1987). Sedimentation in the last 400 000 years has been dominated by glacial erosional and depositional processes.\n\nStructural styles\n\nPost-Devonian basinal subsidence in the southern North Sea has been punctuated by regional episodes of deformation during Late Carboniferous, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and mid-Tertiary times. The earliest of these established a complex system of basement-cutting faults in the Carboniferous and older Palaeozoic rocks. Subsequent episodes of deformation reactivated many of these faults, markedly influencing the Permian and overlying sediments. In the Anglo-Dutch Basin, the style of post-Carboniferous deformation is dominated by halokinetic activity within the Upper Permian salts. Where the halites of the second Upper Permian evaporite cycle are more than 130 m thick (Taylor, 1986), their deformation has effectively decoupled reactivation of the basement faults from deformation of the overlying post-Permian sediments. The Anglo-Dutch Basin is separated from the relatively undeformed basin-marginal areas of the East Midlands Shelf and London–Brabant Massif by the Vale of Pickering–Flamborough Head, Dowsing, and South Hewett fault zones (Figure 13). Stratigraphical relationships adjacent to these and other Mesozoic fault zones indicate that they have had a long and very complex movement history in response to alternating transtensional and transpressional regional stresses.\n\nCarboniferous section\n\nThe Carboniferous sediments of the southern North Sea are displaced by numerous west-north-westerly or north-westerly trending faults, almost all of which continue through the top of the Carboniferous into the overlying Permian strata. Detailed mapping from seismic-reflection surveys has revealed that many of the faults developed with wrench or normal components during and soon after the end-Carboniferous Variscan orogeny (Glennie and Boegner, 1981); these may have been reactivated to displace the Permian and younger sediments during subsequent episodes of deformation. Glennie (1986a) and Walker and Cooper (1987) have observed that swarms of faults are separated by strike-parallel zones in which relatively few faults have developed; the fault traces describe an en-echelon pattern in some parts, but elsewhere form complex, anastomosing patterns which can be traced for up to 100 km along the direction of strike (Walker and Cooper, 1987). Both of these observations suggest that the fault swarms link to deep-seated crustal fractures, and may have formed in response to wrench reactivation of the Early Carboniferous growth faults during Variscan compression. Many of these faults have a reverse component in the north of the area, which suffered the greatest Variscan uplift and erosion. Some faults change their sense of throw from normal to reverse along strike, confirming that they include a wrench component in their history. The East Midlands Shelf and London–Brabant Massif are cut by relatively few faults, and were stable areas during most of the Carboniferous.\n\nDowsing Fault Zone and Swarte Bank Hinge Zone\n\nThe Dowsing Fault Zone and Swarte Bank Hinge Zone form complementary areas of structural complexity on the south-western and north-eastern margins of the Sole Pit Trough (Figure 13); they have many features in common.\n\nIn the north, upward-branching fault patterns (Harding and Lowell, 1979) dominate at structural levels above the Permian; these appear to describe a mainly synclinal, extensional geometry (Glennie and Boegner, 1981; Walker and Cooper, 1987). The Mesozoic sediments are dissected by systems of en-echelon asymmetric grabens that trend north-west to south-east; these started to develop during the Late Triassic in the Dowsing Fault Zone, and during the Late Jurassic in the Swarte Bank Hinge Zone. Each graben is bounded by listric normal faults which sole out in the Upper Permian halites (Figure 14); halokinetic deformation of these, effectively decoupled the faulting in the Mesozoic cover from contemporary deformation of the pre-Permian basement. In the Swarte Bank Hinge Zone, the master faults for each graben dip away from the Sole Pit Inversion axis (Walker and Cooper, 1987). Antithetic faults and subsidiary listric faults occur outside the main grabens, and link to the master faults via decollements on the Triassic halite members of the Haisborough Group. The Upper Permian halites are strongly attenuated beneath some of the listric, fault-bounded grabens. Jenyon and Cresswell (1987) suggested that withdrawal of the salt was directly responsible for the formation of extensional grabens, but identical Mesozoic structures have formed farther south where the salt is thin or absent. It seems more likely that the salt took a passive role in the deformation (Gibbs, 1986).\n\nSouthward stratigraphical thinning of Upper Permian halites causes a change in structural style within both fault zones towards the London–Brabant Massif. Beyond the limit of halite deposition, upward-branching anticlinal ‘flower’ geometry is common within the Mesozoic section, but synclinal grabens are also present and there are many more subsidiary faults between the Dowsing and Swarte Bank fault zones. All faults within the Mesozoic section here can be traced downwards through the Permian strata into their root zones in the Carboniferous. Many faults display components of apparent dip-slip and reverse-slip movement, which Badley et al. (1989) have related to extension followed by inversion (Figure 15). Tubb et al. (1986) have demonstrated that there are significant changes in the thickness of Lower Carboniferous limestones across some of the deep-seated faults on the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif; the faulting within the Mesozoic section was caused mainly by Cretaceous reactivation of these Early Carboniferous growth faults.\n\nGlennie and Boegner (1981) deduced from fault geometry that there have been strike-slip movements along the Dowsing Fault Zone over a very long time, in response to both transtensional and transpressional local crustal stresses. By contrast, Walker and Cooper (1987) have invoked no significant post-Variscan strike-slip or compression along the northern part of the Swarte Bank Hinge Zone. Instead, they interpreted the deformation as resulting from extensional, gravitational creep of the post-Permian sediments off the rising, north-eastern flank of the Sole Pit Trough, mainly during Early Cretaceous times. The en-echelon arrangement of the Mesozoic grabens may indicate a component of oblique slip in their underlying basement faults.\n\nOther Mesozoic fault zones\n\nAway from the Sole Pit Trough, faulting in the Mesozoic sediments of the Anglo-Dutch Basin is localised to a few discrete zones trending approximately east–west or north–south, oblique to the regional basement structure (Figure 13). Three of these fault systems meet the Dowsing Fault Zone along the north-eastern margin of the East Midlands Shelf these are the Vale of Pickering–Flamborough Head Fault Zone, the Outer Silver Pit Fault and the Central Fracture Zone. Where these fault zones intersect, steeply dipping faults extend from the basement through the Upper Permian halites to displace the overlying Mesozoic strata. Otherwise, the halites have effectively decoupled the post-Variscan deformation of the basement from faulting of the Mesozoic sediments across the whole of this region.\n\nThe east–west-trending graben which dominates the Vale of Pickering–Flamborough Head Fault Zone was initiated during the Late Jurassic (Kirby and Swallow, 1987) by failure along the hinge zone between the East Midlands Shelf and the Cleveland Basin. Continuing movement on its listric, southward-dipping master fault and associated antithetic faults caused an upper crustal extension of about 25 percent across the graben by mid-Cretaceous times; the listric fault soles out in Upper Permian evaporites. Kirby and Swallow (1987) have speculated that the north–south extension was caused by sinistral transcurrent movements along deep-seated faults in the basement.\n\nThe Outer Silver Pit Fault was invoked by Glennie and Boegner (1981) to account for a diapiric salt wall extending 30 km east from the Dowsing Fault Zone (Figure 13). There is undoubtedly a large, steeply dipping fault running into the diapir from its western end; this fault extends from the basement through Upper Permian halites to effect an apparent southerly downthrow of more than 300 m in the Triassic sediments. Its displacement of the Mesozoic section dies out quickly to the east. The continuation of the fault beneath the diapir is poorly resolved on seismic-reflection sections, and there is no east–west fault displacing the top of the Carboniferous to the east of the diapir. If the Outer Silver Pit Fault continues to meet the Swarte Bank Hinge Zone, as suggested by Glennie and Boegner (1981), then the dislocation is confined to deeper levels in the basement.\n\nA southerly dipping listric normal fault trends east–west for 75 km along the southern flank of the Mid North Sea High. The fault has developed along a line of anisotropy within Upper Permian sediments, marking the northern limit of halokinetic deformation of the thick, basinal salts. More than 600 m of Upper Triassic and perhaps Jurassic sediments that are preserved in its hanging-wall prism, which is about 6 km wide (Figure 16), had been completely eroded from its footwall by Early Cretaceous times (Jenyon, 1985). Attenuation of Lower Triassic sediments above the Fault zone indicates Jurassic upper-crustal extension of about 1.5 km; this was accompanied by migration of Upper Permian salt to form diapirs in the hanging wall. Later anticlinal folding in many parts of the fault zone (Jenyon, 1985) was caused by post-Cretaceous reverse reactivation of the listric normal fault in a compressive, probably mid-Tertiary, stress regime. By analogy with the Vale of Pickering–Flamborough Head Fault Zone, the structure may have developed above sinistral transcurrent movement on a deep basement lineament, and then was reactivated by dextral transpression during the Tertiary.\n\nStratigraphical and structural relationships are more complex within the north–south-trending Mesozoic fault systems (Figure 13). The Central Fracture Zone (Kirby and Swallow, 1987) is a northward continuation of the Dowsing Fault Zone, but is strongly oblique to its underlying west-northwesterly trending basement faults. The Dogger Fault Zone (S J Stoker, written communication, 1988) comprises a train of asymmetric grabens above a linear Upper Permian salt swell. It is oblique to the dominant north-north-west trend of basement faults in this region, and the grabens face alternately east and west along the length of the fault tone. There are major thickness changes in the Middle and Upper Triassic, Jurassic, Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments across individual faults, indicating a strike-slip component in the movement history. There is a 1 km sinistral offset of a crosscutting minor graben in the Chalk near the southern end of the fault zone. There are indications that the fault zone developed by Late Triassic and Jurassic growth faulting, and then reactivated by strike-slip in response to Late Cretaceous or mid-Tertiary transpression.\n\nHalokinesis in the Anglo-Dutch Basin\n\nMesozoic and early Tertiary sediments have been gently folded over Upper Permian salt swells and pillows across most of the offshore area north of 53°20′N. Many of the halokinetic structures are several hundred metres in amplitude, but there are fewer large salt walls and diapirs in the southern North Sea than in the equivalent evaporite sequence of northern Germany (Brunstrom and Walmsley. 1969).\n\nSannemann (1968) and Jenyon and Cresswell (1987) have suggested that after deposition, the Upper Permian salt remained in a metastable, potentially mobile state because of its low density compared with the overlying sediments. Halokinetic motion was then triggered by changes in the regional stress regime. The earliest salt movements in the southern North Sea occurred during the Middle Triassic along the Mesozoic fault zones bordering the Sole Pit Trough (Brunstrom and Walmsley, 1969; Walker and Cooper, 1987). Salt structures then developed more widely in this trough throughout the Jurassic in response to the differential stresses generated as it subsided. This led to the formation of primary peripheral sinks containing anomalously thick Jurassic sediments between the active salt swells.\n\nAlmost all the salt swells are aligned parallel to the structural grain of the pre-Permian basement. This led Jenyon (1986a) to speculate that the salt structures of the southern North Sea were most active during regional orogenic episodes, when halokinesis was initiated by movements along the many faults which continue upwards from the basement to terminate within the Upper Permian section. Glennie (1986b) inferred that the timing of the salt movements could be used to date the principal movements on the faults.\n\nMany seismic-reflection sections give the impression that brittle deformation of the basement was translated into folding of the overlying sediment by ductile deformation of the relatively mobile salt layer. Brunstrom and Walmsley (1969) observed that most of the largest salt walls and diapirs in the North Sea occur to the south of 54°N, where the majority were active intermittently between Jurassic and mid-Tertiary times. However, the depocentre of the Permian salt basin lay to the north of 54°N, outside the major Mesozoic fault zones, where deformation was delayed until mid-Tertiary times. This implies that in the north either the salt was less mobile, or the shear stresses generated in the salt layer by deformation of the basement were less pervasive until the mid-Tertiary.\n\nOnce set into motion, the salt structures of the southern North Sea have adopted a very wide variety of shapes and sizes (Jenyon, 1986b); examples of some are illustrated in (Figure 17). The geometry of most of the salt structures demonstrates that differential loading became an increasingly important factor as they continued to develop, causing lateral migration of halite into the growing salt swells. Areas of salt depletion have been preserved as salt withdrawal synclines. Migration may have been particularly rapid at the end of the Jurassic and around the middle of the Tertiary, when the uppermost crust was destabilised by widespread uplift and planation (Jenyon, 1986a).\n\nSuites of uplift-induced normal faults and fractures developed over the crests of many of the largest salt pillows (Jenyon, 1988). As some of these pillows continued to grow, salt was injected along their crestal fractures causing piercement of the overburden, and forming salt walls and diapirs. Where the injected salt encountered a circulatory system of undersaturated water, halite in the piercement was dissolved. Eventually the upper parts of these salt swells were dissolved, leading to collapse grabens in the overburden (Jenyon, 1986b), which remained active for as long as the salt continued to dissolve. Some collapse grabens have displaced the base of the Quaternary by up to 100 m, and late Pleistocene sediments have subsided by up to 10 m (Balson and Cameron, 1985). Many of these grabens may still be active.\n\nChapter 5 Carboniferous\n\nBy the end of the Devonian, the relief of the Old Red Sandstone continent had been severely reduced by erosion. Early in the Carboniferous, crustal extension caused regional subsidence and allowed the sea to transgress northwards across the substantially peneplaned surface of England; it reached as far as the Northumberland Trough by early Dinantian times. Marine shales, sandstones and limestones then continued to be deposited across most of eastern England and the offshore area between the London–Brabant Massif and the Mid North Sea High during the remainder of the Dinantian. By the middle of the Dinantian, periodic southward advances of a delta system to the north caused a regression to dominantly fluviodeltaic conditions in the Northumberland Trough and its eastward offshore continuation. More widespread delta advances during the Namurian then extended fluvial sandstone deposition and fluviodeltaic conditions southward across the remainder of eastern England and the southern North Sea. Most of the overlying early Westphalian sequence is composed of shale-dominated coal measures deposited in an upper delta-plain environment. Contemporaneously, relatively sandy, redbed-facies sediments were being deposited locally on the flanks of the London–Brabant Massif, and with improved drainage and increasing aridity, these extended across the remainder of the area during the late Westphalian. Stephanian sediments have not been proven in the UK sector.\n\nBoth sedimentary facies and palaeomagnetic data demonstrate that the slow drift of the Laurasian continent during the Carboniferous Period carried the southern North Sea from southern, subtropical, arid climes through humid, equatorial conditions into relatively arid, equatorial latitudes (Glennie, 1986b; Besly, 1990). Variscan deformation and uplift in the Late Carboniferous, accompanied by erosion, has caused a variety of Dinantian, Namurian and Westphalian rocks to subcrop beneath the regional unconformity at the base of the Permian in the southern North Sea (Figure 18).\n\nCarboniferous strata have been penetrated by more than 95 per cent of the released exploration wells offshore; their present-day depth of burial beneath Permian, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments increases from 800 m on the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif to more than 4000 m beneath the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin (Figure 13). The Carboniferous sediments achieve their maximum thickness, perhaps more than 5000 m in central parts of the offshore area, and they are absent only over the crest of the London–Brabant Massif.\n\nRelatively few early wells penetrated more than 100 m of the Carboniferous strata. In many wells drilled before 1980, the beds are described as 'Carboniferous Undifferentiated' on company records, but since the discovery of significant volumes of gas in Westphalian sandstones beneath the Anglo-Dutch Basin, many wells have been drilled more than 500 m into the Carboniferous section. This has provided valuable new data on Westphalian and Namurian stratigraphy (Figure 18); late Westphalian strata are now known to be less extensive beneath the Anglo-Dutch Basin than in the earlier assessments of Eames (1975), Glennie and Boegner (1981), and Smith (1985).\n\nDinantian\n\nBoth the thickness and facies of Dinantian (Tournaisian and Visean) sediments in eastern England vary dramatically across syndepositional faults (Grayson and Oldham, 1987; Smith and Smith, 1989). These faults bound highs which were either persistent land throughout most of the Early Carboniferous or are overlain by condensed or incomplete marine sequences. Basins and half-grabens accumulated thick successions of marine or fluviodeltaic sequences between the highs (Grayson and Oldham, 1987). The London–Brabant Massif was one such high; during late Visean times, extensive carbonate platforms became established on the East Midlands Shelf and beneath the Kent Coalfield, on its northern and southern flank respectively. Two other highs, the Alston and Askrigg blocks (Figure 19), were not finally submerged by the Carboniferous sea until late in the Dinantian, and are capped by shallow-water carbonates. The basins included the Gainsborough Trough and the Edale and Widmerpool gulfs of central England, where thick sequences of turbidites and deep-water shales accumulated. The Northumberland Trough was a much larger basin, comprising an asymmetrical, southward-deepening half-graben; it contains more than 4000 m of Dinantian sediments (Kimbell et al., 1989).\n\nDelta-related Yoredale sedimentation cycles encroached into the Northumberland Trough at various intervals throughout the Dinantian, and extended farther south across the highs and lows of northern England before the end of the Dinantian (Taylor et al., 1971). Each Yoredale cycle records a major phase of delta progradation followed by re-establishment of marine conditions. A typical cycle comprises a basal marine limestone overlain by a variety of delta-related sedimentary facies, including thick sandstones deposited in distributary channels, and thin but widespread coals representing abandonment of delta lobes (Elliott, 1975). Many cycles are completed by post-abandonment shoreline deposits.\n\nMost models now invoked to explain the wide range of Dinantian sedimentary environments in northern and central England involve the formation of the small, fault-bounded basins and half-grabens by north–south crustal extension (Leeder, 1982), perhaps accompanied by transtensional shear (Grayson and Oldham, 1987). Locally, thickness and facies were also influenced by Early Carboniferous eustatic changes in sea level, as well as by differential rates of subsidence (Grayson and Oldham, 1987). Bott (1967; 1987) suggested that two of the most persistent highs, the Alston and Askrigg blocks, were kept particularly buoyant by their Caledonian granite cores. Similarly, the offshore continuation of the East Midlands Shelf was a zone of relatively slow Dinantian subsidence (Leeder and Hardman, 1990) above a large subsurface granite pluton (Donato and Megson, 1990).\n\nOffshore, Dinantian sediments have been sampled in only a small number of wells around the periphery of the Anglo-Dutch Basin (Figure 19). These have confirmed that late Visean platform carbonates extend from East Anglia along the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif, and that the marine and fluviodeltaic deposits of the Northumberland Trough continue offshore along the southern margin of the Mid North Sea High. Between these areas, it seems likely that the complex pattern of highs and lows with syndepositional faults continues from eastern England across the centre of the southern North Sea, but there are insufficient data to locate these in most of the offshore area. It does seem possible, however, that the northern limit of carbonate shelf deposition on the flank of the London–Brabant Massif was determined by one or more such faults, perhaps located at the Dowsing Fault Zone and its south-eastwards continuation across the Flemish Bight. (Figure 19) offers a schematic profile through the Dinantian sediments of the southern North Sea.\n\nDinantian sediments in the north\n\nThere is a striking lithological similarity between the lower Dinantian sequence penetrated in well 44/2-1 (Figure 20) and that of the Northumberland Trough, 260 km to the west. The Dinantian sediments are 660 m thick in the well, and are overlain unconformably by Permian strata; perhaps as much as 1000 m of uppermost Dinantian sediments have been removed by pre-Permian erosion. The Devonian–Carboniferous boundary was penetrated near the base of well 44/2-1, and the lowermost Tournaisian fluvial sandstones and shales rest conformably on Devonian fluvial sediments (Belly, 1990). A dolomite bed about 60 m above the base of the Carboniferous heralds a transition to a more complex sequence of dolomitic limestones, sandstones and shales. There are comparable dolomites containing a restricted fauna of ostracods, bivalves and gastropods within the equivalent Cementstone Group of Northumberland, which Leeder (1974) has interpreted as indicating deposition in a periodically hypersaline, probably lagoonal, environment. Onshore, the dolomites become more fully marine westwards along the axis of the Northumberland Trough.\n\nAn influx of increasingly thick sandstone beds occurs near the top of the Tournaisian in well 44/2-1 (Figure 20), slightly earlier than in Northumberland. These and the overlying lower Visean sediments are similar in lithology to the Fell Sandstone Group of northern Northumberland, which Hodgson (1978) interpreted as the sheet-sand deposits of braided-river courses that flowed south or south-eastwards across a fluviodeltaic alluvial plain. Interbedded sandstones and shales with thin coal seams occur at the top of the Dinantian section in well 44/2-1, and in nearby well 44/7-1. These were deposited contemporaneously with the Scremerston Coal Group of Northumberland during a major regression of the braided-river facies that allowed fluviodeltaic sedimentation to become established during mid-Dinantian times.\n\nIn northern England, the remainder of the Dinantian sequence is dominated by Yoredale cycles. Delta-related or marine sandstones and shales predominate, but there are also thin seams of coal and beds of commonly shelly, marine, limestone. The Seal Sands borehole (Figure 19) has proved 1200 m of uppermost Dinantian sediments composed of the Yoredale cycles on the east coast of England (Dunham and Wilson, 1985). Carbonates and coal seams are intercalated with sandstones and shales in the Dinantian sequences penetrated by wells 41/20-1, 41/24a-2 and 42/10a-1 ((Figure 19) and (Figure 21)), suggesting that shallow-marine and deltaic facies had extended over most of the northern offshore area by the end of the Dinantian.\n\nThere is a broad zone beneath the Anglo-Dutch Basin in which the Dinantian sediments are deeply buried and have not been penetrated by exploration wells. Onshore, the Yoredale facies in the Seal Sands borehole (which terminated above the base of the Dinantian in sediments of early Visean age) is underlain by 2249 m of mudstones, siltstones and sandstones with a few thin limestones (Dunham and Wilson, 1985). Similar sequences of marine sediments may underlie beds of the Yoredale facies beneath the northern part of the Anglo-Dutch Basin, but only adjacent to Dinantian syndepositional faults are they likely to achieve such remarkable thick nesses. It seems more likely that the total Dinantian sequence is generally between 1000 and 2500 m thick in the central offshore area (Figure 19), perhaps thinning to less than 1000 m over structural highs.\n\nDinantian sediments along the flanks of the London–Brabant Massif\n\nAdjacent to the London–Brabant Massif, well 53/12-2 penetrated the uppermost 450 m of Dinantian limestones in an area where seismic-reflection sections indicate that these may be locally more than 1 km thick. Dinantian syndepositional faults can be observed dipping towards the north-east on the seismic sections, and Tubb et al. (1986) have speculated that reef limestones may have accumulated on the footwalls of such faults.\n\nIn well 53/12-2, the Dinantian comprises a lower dolomitic limestone, in places argillaceous, overlain by about 300 m of limestone containing oolite beds. Fossiliferous beds containing abundant corals, brachiopods, bivalves, bryozoans and crinoids occur within equivalent sediments at Somerton and East Ruston in East Anglia (Figure 19); these are likely to be intercalated locally within the Lower Carboniferous limestones offshore.\n\nTo the south-east, Dinantian carbonates are up to 750 m thick in The Netherlands, where they were deposited in an open-marine to restricted, sublagoonal environment with practically no siliciclastic input (van Staalduinen et al., 1979). There are widespread gaps in the sedimentary sequence, with locally condensed sequences, and reworked Tournaisian fossils within the upper Visean limestones. This suggests that there was contemporary, intermittent uplift and erosion along the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif (van Staalduinen et al., 1979). The limestones are notably absent in wells 47/29a-1 and 53/16-1 (Figure 19), where Upper Carboniferous rocks rest directly on Lower Palaeozoic basement; it seems that the limestones had already been eroded to their present southern limit by mid-Carboniferous times, and that they may never have extended over the crest of the London–Brabant Massif.\n\nSouth of the London–Brabant Massif, up to 300 m of Dinantian, bituminous, pyritic, oolitic or finely crystalline limestones and calcite mudstones have been proved beneath Langsettian (Westphalian A) coal measures in the Kent Coalfield (George et al., 1976). Mid-Visean rocks underlie the Westphalian throughout the coalfield, and Tournaisian faunas have been described from near the base of the limestones in two boreholes (Mitchell, 1981). If later Visean carbonates were deposited in this area, they have been completely removed by pre-Westphalian erosion. Seismic sections offshore confirm that the Dinantian limestones of Kent continue beneath the Dover Strait (Figure 19), and south-east of Dover they may be as much as 900 m thick. Their erosional limit along the southern flank of the London–Brabant Massif is uncertain.\n\nNamurian\n\nThe differential bathymetry inherited from the Dinantian continued to play a major role in controlling depositional patterns in central England during Namurian times (Collinson, 1988). Basinal mudstones, turbidites and turbidite-fronted delta sequences infilled most lows during the early Namurian, before a succession of stacked, sheet-delta sequences extended diachronously across the whole of northern and central England during the remainder of the Namurian. These sediments display an overall cyclic pattern; they are mainly nonmarine, but Ramsbottom (1977) interpreted six major, and several minor, eustatic rises in sea level on the basis of widespread goniatite-bearing marine shales.\n\nNamurian rocks have been penetrated by more than 20 wells in the southern North Sea (Figure 22); most were terminated before reaching Dinantian sediments, and the Namurian sequence has been truncated beneath the base-Permian unconformity in many of the remainder. Despite this, the sediments encountered are likely to be representative of much of the offshore Namurian, and a schematic profile has been constructed to illustrate the lateral relationships of the principal Namurian sedimentary facies (Figure 22). The Namurian sequence appears to be attenuated in well 41/20-1 (Figure 23) relative to wells in the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin. As in central England (Collinson, 1988), basinal tectonics and local subsidence patterns are likely to have affected bathymetry and the style of sedimentation offshore until at least mid-Namurian times.\n\nNamurian sediments in the northern wells\n\nWell 43/25-1 (Figure 22) has proved that Namurian sediments are locally more than 1250 m thick in the north-central part of the Anglo-Dutch Basin. Its basal sediments were assigned a possible very early Namurian age by the well operators, suggesting that the well terminated close to the Dinantian–Namurian boundary. Leeder and Hardman (1990) have observed that there may be locally more than 2000 m of Namurian sediments above the Dinantian depocentres. For comparison, Smith and Smith (1989) have noted that the Namurian attains a maximum thickness of 1400 m in north-eastern England.\n\nLeeder and Hardman (1990) have used Collinson's (1988) observations in northern England to deduce that the Namurian sediments of the southern North Sea bear the imprint of repeated progradation of major fluviodeltaic systems across both areas. Successive advances of these fluviodeltaic systems caused the area covered by delta-plain sedimentation to expand gradually southwards across the North Sea. As a result, the Namurian sediments penetrated by wells in the cen tre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin display a large-scale upwardshallowing sequence of sedimentary facies.\n\nThe middle and upper Namurian (Marsdenian to Yeadonian) in well 48/3-3 (Figure 23) provides a good illustration of the progressive infill of a deep basin as the fluviodeltaic systems encroached (Leeder et al., 1990). The 140 m-thick unit at the base of the well is dominated by black mudstones that were deposited when the basin was still remote from coarse-grained, clastic, sediment supply. Beds of turbidite siltstone are increasingly intercalated within the mudstones in the overlying 75 m, and the thin sandstones which occur within the 90 m section above are prodelta turbidites deposited during the progradation of a turbidite fan lobe into the basin. Two further turbidite fan lobes are represented within the overlying 140 m sequence of sandstones, siltstones and mudstones, and each of these culminates in a 20 m-thick, multistorey, coarse-grained, fan-channel, sandstone bed. The remainder of the Namurian section is probably Yeadonian in age (Leeder et al., 1990). The rapidly alternating sandstones and mudstones at the base of the Yeadonian comprise a lower delta-slope facies, and are succeeded by an upper delta-slope sequence of mudstones and thin sandstones. The fluviodeltaic deposits at the top of the Namurian include thin coal seams and a 28 m-thick, medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone bed that was deposited in a distributary channel. Leeder et al. (1990) have suggested that the thickest sandstone intervals in well 48/3-3 may correlate with the sandy sheet-delta sediments of the youngest of the 'Millstone Grit' cycles of northern England.\n\nNearer to the English coast, 704 m of basal Namurian sediments were penetrated by well 41/24a-2 ((Figure 22) and (Figure 23)). This section and the basal 300 m of the Namurian in nearby well 41/20-1 are mudstone dominated, but siltstones and thin beds of fine-, medium- and coarse-grained sandstone occur throughout, and are locally abundant. There are carbonates intercalated with deltaic deposits in the underlying Dinantian section in well 41/24a-2, suggesting that the Namurian sediments were deposited in shallow-water, prodelta and delta-plain, fluviodeltaic environments. Deep-water, basinal facies may have become restricted mainly to the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin by early Namurian times.\n\nWell 41/18b-2 records an upward transition from mudstone-dominated to relatively sandy deltaic facies within its 353 m-thick Namurian section (Figure 23). The sediments near the base of the well have been dated as late Namurian, perhaps Marsdenian, on the basis of goniatites and foraminifera (N J Riley, written communication, 1989). The fluviodeltaic sandstone beds are up to 23 m thick; their gamma-ray profiles are interpreted as displaying deposits from a wide range of major and minor distributary channels, prograding crevasse splays, and minor mouth-bars (cf Steele, 1988). Coal seams are unusually abundant within the upper Namurian in well 41/18b-2, and also occur within the uppermost 475 m of the Namurian in well 41/20-1 (Figure 23). Thick, interbedded, distributary-channel sandstones are notably absent in the latter well, suggesting that a shallow-water delta or lower-delta, floodplain environment prevailed here through the late Namurian. Only the fluviodeltaic facies occurs in all wells which penetrated upper Namurian strata in the south-central part of the Anglo-Dutch Basin.\n\nNamurian sediments adjacent to the London–Brabant Massif\n\nThree wells appear to provide conflicting evidence on the basal relationships of the southernmost Namurian deposits in the North Sea. In well 52/5-11 (Figure 24), approximately 130 m of Yeadonian (late Namurian) sandstones and mudstones rest unconformably on Dinantian limestones. This led Ramsbottom et al. (1978) to speculate that progressively younger Namurian beds onlap southwards on to Dinantian or older rocks along the northern flank of the London–Brabant Massif, as around other upland areas of Britain and Ireland. Some 90 km along strike to the west, well 47/29a-1 proved 169 m of lower Namurian sandstones and shales resting on Ordovician basement; later Namurian and Westphalian deposits are notably absent, and may have been eroded beneath the base-Permian unconformity. Farther along strike, Namurian rocks are completely absent in south Lincolnshire, where Langsettian (Westphalian A) coal measures rest on Dinantian limestones, as they do to the south of well 52/5-11.\n\nIf the dating by the well operators is correct, the evidence from well 47/29a-1 suggests that a transgression soon after the end of the Dinantian extended sedimentation locally beyond the Dinantian limestones on to the London–Brabant Massif (Figure 24). Regional mid-Namurian uplift of the massif then caused regression and erosion of lower Namurian deposits over most of this southern area. A second transgression subsequently extended late Namurian and Westphalian sedimentation progressively southwards across the flank of the London–Brabant Massif. The stratigraphic onlap envisaged by Ramsbottom et al. (1978) was therefore delayed until the late Namurian, and where both lower and upper Namurian deposits are preserved to the south of the Anglo-Dutch Basin, they are likely to be separated by an unconformiry. Namurian rocks have not been recorded from the Kent Coalfield (Ramsbottom et al., 1978), and are unlikely to occur beneath the Dover Strait.\n\nWestphalian\n\nThree comparable and widespread marine bands divide the Westphalian deposits of central England into four chronostratigraphical units. Deltaic sedimentation from Langsettian (Westphalian A) through Duckmantian (Westphalian B) to early Bolsovian (Westphalian C) times deposited the coal-bearing facies of the Coal Measures. Primary redbedfacies sediments were deposited in northern and central England during later Bolsovian and Westphalian D times.\n\nGuion and Fielding (1988) deduced that most of the deltaic sedimentation took place on a low-lying, paralic plain that was occupied by swamps with brackish and freshwater lagoons in which muds, silts and layers of plant debris accumulated. Major river distributaries brought channel sands on to the plains, and breaching of these channels allowed crevasse-channel sands and crevasse-splay sands to be deposited in the interdistributary lagoonal areas. Irregular subsidence resulted in cyclic sequences of deposition; these show much variation in thickness, with lateral splitting and coalescing of beds. The coal-bearing facies was superseded by a primary redbed facies composed mainly of mud-dominated alluvial and lacustrine sediments, but there are many intercalations of minor meandering channel deposits and widespread pedogenic textures (Besly, 1990).\n\nIn England, both the coal-bearing and primary redbed facies of the Westphalian have been traditionally referred to the Coal Measures (Ramsbottom et al., 1978), although there are no coals within most of the redbed sequence. There is no formal stratigraphical nomenclature for the offshore deposits, although the redbeds have been variously described as 'Barren Red Beds' (Rhys, 1974), 'Barren Measures' (Tubb et al., 1986), or the 'Barren Red Group' (Besly, 1990). In this report, the informal terms coal measures and redbeds will be used, and these are described separately.\n\nMore than 250 exploration wells have penetrated Westphalian strata in the southern North Sea, and almost all have encountered the Langsettian and Duckmantian coal measures (Figure 25). The redbeds are preserved only in the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin and along the flanks of the London–Brabant Massif (Figure 25). Where the Langsettian and Duckmantian coal measures subcrop at the base-Permian unconformity, they have been reddened by secondary oxidation, locally for more than 50 m beneath their top. This oxidation has altered thin coal seams directly beneath the unconformity to dolomite in at least one well off the north-east coast of East Anglia.\n\nIn northern England, there are 1525 m of coal-bearing Langsettian and Duckmantian sediments in the centre of the Pennine Basin (Calver, 1969). The overlying redbed deposits are also 1525 m thick in the Lancashire and North Staffordshire coalfields, where they may range up to Stephanian in age. The maximum combined thickness of Westphalian and Stephanian deposits onshore is about 3050 m (Calver, 1969). The offshore wells indicate that up to 1600 m of Westphalian sediments are preserved in the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin, of which about 1030 m are coal bearing. Elsewhere, relatively few of the wells have penetrated to depths sufficient to deduce Westphalian thickness. Glennie (1986b) has estimated that the coal-bearing sequence preserved beneath the base-Permian unconformity is about 1200 m thick along a Sole Pit axis of late Westphalian inversion. There are indications that the Langsettian sequence may be appreciably thicker here than beneath the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin.\n\nCoal-measure facies in the Anglo-Dutch Basin\n\nAs in northern England, the coal measures of the Anglo-Dutch Basin are dominated by grey mudstones and silty mudstones, with varying proportions of sandstone, coal and seat earth. Calver (1969) counted about 80 coal seams in the Pennine Basin, and Glennie (1986a) has estimated that coals form between 3 and 4 per cent of the total thickness of Westphalian deposits offshore. Fine- to coarse-grained sandstone beds, generally less than 10 m thick, make up less than 20 per cent of the coal-bearing sequence in the centre of the Anglo-Dutch Basin. To the south, the coal measures appear to become more argillaceous, and contain about 10 per cent sandstone in wells adjacent to the London–Brabant Massif. Most of the thickest and coarsest-grained sandstones were deposited in fluvial distributary channels, and although these account for less than 5 per cent of the total sequence, one forms the main reservoir for the Murdoch Gasfield and is 40 m thick in nearby well 44/23-4 (Figure 25). Similar coarse-grained sandstones are up to 30 m thick onshore in the Durham Coalfield, where they occur in belts between 15 and 20 km wide that can be traced for tens of kilometres in the direction of channel flow (Fielding, 1986).\n\nThe stratigraphy of the coal measures is best established offshore in the north-central part of the Anglo-Dutch Basin, where several wells have each penetrated more than 500 m of Westphalian section. The Subcrenatum Marine Band, which defines the Namurian–Westphalian boundary in England and Wales (Ramsbottom et al., 1978), occurs within thick shale sequences in wells 44/22-1 and 44/23-4 (Figure 26). The well operators placed the Namurian–Westphalian boundary at the base of a distributary channel sandstone in both wells, but the marine band is more likely to coincide with the highest natural gamma-ray peaks within the underlying shales, as in Figure 26. High gamma-ray peaks followed by a gradual upward decrease in natural radioactivity have been correlated with marine bands in the Yorkshire and Derbyshire coalfields (Knowles, 1964).\n\nThe Vanderbeckei Marine Band defines the base of the Duckmantian in England (Ramsbottom et al., 1978), and has been positively identified within shale horizons between 460 and 515 m above the Subcrenatum Marine Band in three offshore wells (Figure 26). The Aegiranum Marine Band, defining the Duckmantian–Bolsovian boundary in England, occurs close above the highest coal seam in well 44/28-1. The sequence penetrated by well 49/9-1 (Figure 26) suggests that the Duckmantian and early Bolsovian coal measures have a combined thickness of about 550 m in the central offshore area.\n\nGuion and Fielding (1988) envisaged that a lower delta-plain or shallow-water environment persisted from the late Namurian into early Langsettian times in the Pennine Basin. The offshore data confirm that this environment was continuous across most or all of the southern North Sea. As in the Pennine Basin, there are relatively few thin coals for about 200 m above the base of the Westphalian in wells 44/22-1 and 44/23-4 (Figure 26). In northern England, there are many thin marine bands within this part of the Langsettian sequence, and sandstone beds are particularly extensive (Calver, 1969). The wells drilled so far, suggest that the equivalent sandstones are thinner and finer-grained offshore, implying a less extensive network of fluvial distributary channels than in northern and central England.\n\nCoal seams within the remainder of the Langsettian and most of the Duckmantian coal measures of northern England are many and thick; sandstones are less abundant, there are few marine bands, and freshwater mussel beds are common. Guion and Fielding (1988) have interpreted these deposits as an upper delta-plain facies, perhaps reflecting major delta progradation southwards across the Pennine Basin during early Langsettian times. The coal seams are also thickest and most numerous within the upper Langsettian and Duckmantian deposits of the southern North Sea, yet in some offshore wells there are thicker distributary channel sandstone beds intercalated within these than within the underlying lower delta-plain facies. Sandstones are most abundant in the middle part of the Langsettian in well 41/20-1 off Yorkshire, and become more numerous and coarser-grained upwards through the Langsettian in wells 49/5-2 and 49/19-1 near the median line (Figure 25). They are thickest and coarsest close above the base of the Duckmantian adjacent to the Murdoch Gasfield (Figure 25). None of the other wells which have penetrated thick Westphalian sections display significant variations in the proportion of sandstone in the coal measures.\n\nPerhaps the most easily identified marker bed offshore is an unusually thick coal seam between 90 and 150 m above the base of the Duckmantian (Figure 26), which forms a conspicuous seismic marker in the north-central part of the Anglo-Dutch Basin. A freshwater mussel band 18 m below this coal seam in well 44/22-1 has yielded a fauna typical of the 'Thrygiana' faunal belt onshore (N J Riley, written commmunication, 1989). In Durham, the 'Thrygiana' faunal belt is overlain by the Main Coal (Ramsbottom et al., 1978), which is about 130 m above the base of the Duckmantian. A thick coal seam occurs at a similar stratigraphical level in most of the coalfields of England and Wales (Ramsbottom et al., 1978), and the thick offshore seam is believed to be a close time equivalent of the Main Coal.\n\nMarine bands are relatively numerous within the uppermost Duckmantian and basal Bolsovian of northern England (Calver, 1969); Guion and Fielding (1988) have speculated that the deltas may have receded to allow a return to lower delta-plain conditions late in Duckmantian times. There are insufficient wells penetrating this part of the sequence to determine whether a comparable facies change occurred offshore.\n\nCoal-measure facies around the London–Brabant Massif\n\nWells off the coast of East Anglia provide good evidence that Langsettian and Duckmantian coal measures here overstep Namurian and Dinantian on to Lower Palaeozoic basement. In well 52/5-11 (Figure 27), these coal measures have a combined thickness of 464 m, and rest conformably on Namurian sediments. Some 40 km to the south-east, the Namurian is absent in well 53/12-3, and there are only 26 m of uppermost Langsettian and 200 m of Duckmantian beds lying unconformably on Dinantian limestones (Figure 24). In both wells, the Duckmantian sediments may have been partially eroded beneath a mid-Westphalian unconformity (Tubb et al., 1986). The Main C"
