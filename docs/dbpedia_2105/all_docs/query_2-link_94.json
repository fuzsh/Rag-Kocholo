        "text": "Eventful weeks are behind the installation team of the Nordsee Ost offshore wind farm. The last rotor blade of the 24th wind turbine was successfully installed some 30 kilometres north of the island of Heligoland on the weekend. This completes the installation of half of all 48 turbines some three months after the first installation.\n\n“In a football match we would now have reached halftime. At the Nordsee Ost wind farm, however, the second half is already in full swing without interruption because, apart from the 24 completely installed turbines, all towers with the associated nacelles already stand in the water”, explained Marcel Sunier, Project Director for the Nordsee Ost wind farm at RWE Innogy. “Thanks to the good cooperation especially on our installation vessel ‘Victoria Mathias’ we successfully concluded the installation of the tower segments and nacelles early in October.”"
