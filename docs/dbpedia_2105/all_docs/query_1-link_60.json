        "text": "Princess Alexandra's Revenge...\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Denmark was married to Crown Prince Albert Edward, Queen Victoria's eldest son, in 1851. Theirs was a comfortable marriage, but he did heed her advice and interests, as he showed in the way he supported Denmark in the Second Schleswig-Holstein War. Queen Victoria and her other Saxe-Coburg children preferred Germany's interests and on the First of August 1865, Germany forced Denmark to give up Holstein, Schleswig and Lauenburg. Princess Alexandra was furious, but privately - and quietly - resolved to find a way to put a spoke in Germany's wheels.\n\nHer opportunity came in 1890; Bismarck wanted Heligoland to guard the entrances to the ports of Hamburg and Bremen and the Kiel Canal. British Heligoland had been taken in 1807 from Denmark, was awarded to Britain in 1814 and in 1890 was coming up to its seventy-third year in British hands. From 1826, the sleepy fishing (and smuggling) haven, had become a fashionable spa, but all was to change. Alexandra had learnt from Albert Edward that Bismarck had proposed giving up a largely-spurious claim to Zanzibar and parts of the Kenya Territory, in return for Heligoland. At her suggestion he went to see the First Naval Lord, to ask a single question.\n\n\"In the event of our giving Heligoland to Germany, what will happen to the Royal Navy if we are at war in the future?\"\n\nAdmiral Sir Richard Vesey-Hamilton made a simple reply. \"In that case, Your Royal Highness, we lose control of the Heligoland Bight, for the Kaiserliche Marine could deploy battleships in the North Sea.\"\n\n\"I thought so... Maybe the Admiralty would like to make that clear? By the way - myself and Princess Alexandra will be happy if you and your wife can visit us.\"\n\nThe Vesey-Hamilton Memorandum lead to the Admiralty making strong representations to the Prime Minister about the risks of concentrating on Africa, whilst raising the risks in the North Sea. The result was that the 1890 Anglo-German Treaty defined the boundaries of German possessions in Africa and the line from Mombasa to Lake Victoria had to be re-aligned. Zanzibar and Pemba - independent in any case - were to fall to the Royal Navy in 1896, rather than to Germany; the Sultan felt British protection was preferable to German domination.\n\nHeligoland's North and South Anchorages were to be a posting for a small naval squadron, thenceforewards; the dockyard at Chatham carried out maintenance, Captains and Rear-Admirals complaining at the lack of defences until Sir Anthony Fredericks became First Naval Lord in 1893 and built massive defences from 1895 under the Naval Works Act. That would mean that the battleships and cruisers of the 1889 Naval Defence Act had at least some defence against torpedo and gunnery raids from ships in Hamburg, Bremen and Wilhelmshaven. It was becoming increasingly clear that Heligoland was an obstacle to the Kaiser's plans for a High Seas Fleet, so the Royal Navy were to turn it into the 'Gibraltar of the North Sea' over some twenty years.\n\nHMS Heligoland - and the Heligolanders\n\nThe establishment of a small dockyard at Heligoland Town in 1896 is the real start of modern Heligoland. Although there was a brief proposal to name it 'HMS Alexandra', the existence of the still-useful ironclad battleship (launched 1875) meant that 'HMS Heligoland' became the obvious choice. Because of the small size of Heligoland, most materials had to be shipped in by sea from Norway, Sweden and England. This is why the beaches and moles so often confuse visiting geologists - there is so much foreign material that the island has been claimed to be made of glacial moraine. The native sandstone and chalk were tunnelled extensively over nearly eighty years, so much so that maybe 15% of the island is voids or collapsed quarries.\n\n'HMS Heligoland' began with muzzle-loading rifles on shore batteries, but by 1902 it became obvious that what Frederick called 'The Concrete Battleship' was inevitable. The first phase was eight 12-inch ex-battleship guns in coastal gun mounts and open surface emplacements, but Fort Drum in Manila Bay is a lesser example of what was planned in Heligoland - turreted and cupola'd battleship breech loader rifles that by 1914 had been intended to be sixteen 15-inch guns. The Oberland was turned into four deeply-buried battery systems that were linked by a light railway underground and provided with storage for thousands of rounds of ammunition. The water supply reservoirs resembled those of ancient Constantinople, holding up to two year's supply at normal use by the garrison. Rainwater was to be harvested, as at Gibraltar, but the delivery of water by the 'Aquarian Squadron' was sometimes essential.\n\nThere was an inevitable clash of interests with those of the native islanders, who on the one hand had jobs building, maintaining and garrisoning the fortress, but who grieved for the passing of agriculture and the wildlife of the Oberland. For a time, there was concern that the islands of Heligoland and Dune might be washed away, but storm-defences added to over decades saw that vanish. But those defences were also fortified against landings; blockhouses and pillboxes were fitted with searchlights, Maxims and Vickers guns, Hotchkiss and Elswick quickfirers. A full regiment of Royal Marines was brought in for coastal defence. The Old Harbour of stone and fishing-boats was an isolated relic amongst thousands of tons of imported granite, concrete and steel.\n\nBut Heligoland fell out of favour in 1904 when Sir John Arbuthnot Fisher became First Sea Lord, despite continuing Royal interest. Fisher cut the Naval budget by Â£3.6 million, which saw Heligoland reduced to eight 13.5-inch guns with a range of barely 36,000 yards at full elevation and the old eight 12-inchers in old turrets as a secondary battery armament. The savings paid for the 'Queen Elizabeth' class of battleships, but seriously weakened 'HMS Heligoland''s offensive capability. Whilst her guns could fight off a squadron of battleships, the 'Concrete Battleship' could not command all the channels to the Kiel Canal and Hamburg as Frederick had intended. The harbour - which would have spanned the whole area between the Island and Dune - was also reduced to three smaller mole-protected harbours for cruisers, destroyers, torpedo boats and submarines. Gone were the dreams of a forward assembly-area and anchorage for the Grand Fleet, Heligoland was filled with 'disposables' - turtle-back destroyers like 'Ardent', torpedo boats, three light cruisers and the once-respected 'HMS Alexandra', last of the broadside ironclad battleships, as guardship. But, in a gesture to the future, the submarines 'E-1', 'E-2' and 'E-3', the first of their class, were to be assigned to the Heligoland Squadron. Heligoland was to deny the enemy its strength and rely upon the small vessels for offensive work during a war. It was a sad come-down from the offensive role 'HMS Heligoland' had been intended to play.\n\n\"In the event of war, we'll have to evacuate all dependents to Britain.\" The Governor - always a Rear-Admiral - told the locals at a Town Hall meeting. \"But the flag of British Heligoland remains - the White Ensign will not be the only flag on Heligoland.\" But the locals were not convinced; some were re-settled at Navy expense in Norfolk and in Denmark. A very few others were to try their luck in the Kaiser's Germany, with sad results in the future.\n\nThe influence of Heligoland was not in fact to be very great; the guns had a known maximum range of 36,000 yards and whilst they were a nuisance to the Kaiserliche Marine, they did not halt German naval deployments or coastal commerce. The problem for Germany was that the heavy guns sterilised the sea for naval movements in a circle 66 kilometers in diameter during daylight hours. The solution would be night movements, but the Royal Navy would then be able to use searchlights (range up to 18,000 yards) to cover a lesser diameter. Germany's solution was to look into the use of high-speed diesel or steam turbine torpedo boats and the building of Unterseeboot to pass under the sea near Heligoland. But, even in 1910, there was serious concern in the Royal Navy that minelayers could isolate the whole place in barely three days.\n\nAfrica had been the main expense of Heligoland; the Kenya Protectorate or Colony was a smaller one than the 1890 settlement would have allowed and the Zanzibar Protectorate nearly triggered a war. Britain had to agree not to turn Zanzibar into yet another fortified naval base, which made Aden the most viable alternative. At the same time (1898) there were squabbles over Fachoda, but Britain forced France to back down and leave this part of what became the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. German East Africa remained as a powerful block to the 'Cape to Cairo' ambitions of such as Cecil Rhodes. There was no effect, however, on the Boer War, except that the High Seas Fleet exercised off Heligoland and almost dared the Marine and Royal Navy gunners to open fire."
