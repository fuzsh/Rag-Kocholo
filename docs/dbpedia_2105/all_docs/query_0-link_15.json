The principal towns in the district are Kingston upon Hull, a port since the 12th century, and Scunthorpe, which developed in the 19th century in response to the exploitation of the Frodingham Ironstone. Iron ore had been mined in this district since Roman times, but between 1859 and 1988, when working ceased, around 300 million tonnes of ore were extracted. Although the ore is now regarded as being sub-economic, there is an estimated resource of over 1000 million tonnes left in the ground. Other valuable resources still exploited in the area are chalk and clay for cement-making, chalk for whiting, sand for glass-making, and oil.\n\nThe survey of the district was accompanied by the drilling of several fully cored boreholes, enabling a more comprehensive stratigraphical appraisal of the Triassic to Cretaceous succession than was previously possible. In addition, a number of hydrocarbon and coal trial boreholes have helped to elucidate the stratigraphy of the basement Carboniferous rocks. Interpretation of the complex Quaternary succession has been enhanced by a greater understanding of glacial and periglacial processes and by the application of improved dating techniques.\n\nThe lithological uniformity of the late Jurassic, mainly mudstone sequence has led to the introduction of a modified lithostratigraphical nomenclature; however, a biostratigraphical appraisal of the sequence in the key borehole at Nettleton Bottom enables correlation with the standard succession in southern Lincolnshire. The type areas of the formations comprising the Chalk Group of the Northern Province occur within the district; the stratigraphy has been refined and additional marker horizons have been named and defined. Geophysical investigations have revealed anomalies suggesting a buried granite on the northern margin of the district and a Carboniferous trough in the south-west.\n\nThis new knowledge enables us to better assess the existing resources of the district and will facilitate land-use planning. Additionally, a better understanding of the Quaternary succession provides us with a more complete picture of climatic and relative sea-level change over the past 2 million years; this will help us to forecast the likely impact on Britain of future global change.\n\nPeter J Cook DSc, Director, British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottingham.

The older rocks are known only from deep boreholes, but the youngest Triassic rocks, a full and varied succession of Jurassic strata and more than 300 metres of Cretaceous rocks occur at outcrop, together with a wide range of Quaternary deposits.\n\nThe Upper Carboniferous sandstones, mudstones and coals are a continuation of those seen at the surface farther west, as are the Permian rocks, though the latter are much thicker than at outcrop and contain substantial beds of salt and anhydrite. The arid conditions under which the Permian rocks were formed persisted during Triassic times, when largely red sandstones and mudstones were deposited.\n\nThe Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks were laid down in seas of varying depth, the former consisting predominantly of mudstones and limestones, but including sandstones and ironstones, one of which, the Frodingham Ironstone, was worked for more than a hundred years. Contemporaneous uplift in the north of the district associated with the Market Weighton Structure was responsible for the thinning in that direction of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks, the latter being virtually confined to the area south of Brigg.\n\nThe Chalk, which forms the major topographical features of the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds, is of particular interest because the type areas of its three lowest formations in northern England are found in the district.\n\nThe Quaternary deposits provide evidence of two interglacial and at least two glacial episodes as well as a record of dramatic changes of sea level in relatively recent times.\n\nChapters of the memoir deal with the tectonic history, economic products and hydrogeology of the district.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThis memoir describes the geology of the district covered by the Kingston upon Hull (80) and Brigg (89) 1:50 000 geological sheets of England and Wales (Figure 1).\n\nThe district was originally surveyed on the one-inch scale to the south of the Humber and on the six-inch scale to the north by A C G Cameron, J R Dakyns, C Fox-Strangways, A J Jukes-Browne, C Reid and W A E Ussher, and the results were published on Old Series one-inch sheets 83 and 86 in 1886 and 1887 respectively. Memoirs for these sheets were published in 1888 and 1890. During the 1939–45 war a six-inch reconnaissance survey of the Frodingham Ironstone and Claxby Ironstone outcrops and adjacent areas was carried out by Dr V Wilson, but the maps were not published. The resurvey north of the Humber and primary six-inch survey south of the Humber were carried out between 1960 and 1977. Separate Solid and Drift editions at the 1:50 000 scale were published for Sheet 89 in 1982 and for Sheet 80 in 1983\n\nTopographically the district comprises three northward-converging ridges with westward-facing scarps rising above low-lying gently undulating or flat terrain, some of it only 1 to 2 m above OD, and cut across by the Humber Estuary (Figure 2). To the south of the Humber the western ridge, on which Scunthorpe stands, rises to 67 m above OD north of Burton upon Stather; the central ridge, which as the Lincoln Edge runs from the Humber to beyond Grantham, reaches 77 m above OD north-east of Scunthorpe and 73 m north of Kirton in Lindsey; the eastern ridge is part of the Lincolnshire Wolds, which rise to 100 m near Horkstow and 168 m above OD south of Caistor. North of the Humber, the western and central ridges almost coalesce and form only minor features on the scarp of the eastern ridge, here part of the Yorkshire Wolds which reach nearly 150 m above OD east of South Cave. The low-lying area west of the Yorkshire Wolds forms part of the Vale of York; that to the east, on which Kingston upon Hull is situated, is part of the floodplain of the River Hull. South of the Humber the floodplain of the River Trent lies in the west, the floodplain of the River Ancholme separates the Lincoln Edge from the Lincolnshire Wolds, and the low ground east of the latter continues south-eastwards as the coastal Lincoln Marsh.\n\nThe entire district lies within the Humber catchment, and the drainage of one-fifth of England is into the estuary. Spring tides in the Humber rise to 3.6 m above OD and, within the district, the rivers Ouse and Trent are tidal and variably saline, as also were the lower reaches of the Ancholme and Hull before sluices and flood-barriers were built.\n\nHistorical\n\nThe earliest traces of man in the district are presumed Lower Palaeolithic flakes discovered at Kirmington. Remains from the later part of the Stone Age and from the Bronze and Iron ages have also been found, the Bronze Age boats from North Ferriby and Brigg deserving special mention. Brough (Petuaria) and Caistor were Roman settlements and the line of Ermine Street can still be seen along the Lincoln Edge. The Humber Estuary gave ready access to Anglian and Danish invaders, who founded most of the towns and villages in the district.\n\nKingston upon Hull, which originated during the 12th century, served as an important port for the mediaeval wool trade and for the later whaling and fishing industries. Scunthorpe, the only other large town in the district, developed rapidly in the mid-19th century in response to the exploitation of the Frodingham Ironstone. Communications within the district improved considerably with the linking of the Humber Estuary to the canal systems of northern England and, via the River Trent, with the Midlands, and later with the coming of the railways. More recently, motorway links have arrived and the Humber Bridge has been built.\n\nThere is archaeological or documentary evidence of exploitation from mediaeval times of most of the mineral resources available at the surface, notably clay, mudstone, limestone and chalk, and there are even traces of old workings in some of the ironstones. In more recent times the principal minerals worked have been ironstone, which reached an annual output of 5.6 million tonnes in the early 1960s, and chalk, clay and mudstone for cement manufacture. Coal has been proved at considerable depth, but has not been mined, and there has been some exploration for deep hydrocarbon sources, with modest success in the Corringham area in the south-west.\n\nOutline of geological history\n\nThe only evidence of pre-Carboniferous history is provided by geophysical investigations, which suggest the possible presence of a concealed granite near Market Weighton to the north-west, and of a deep-seated belt of magnetic rocks crossing the district from north-west to south-east. Boreholes have penetrated only as deep as the Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) rocks. When these rocks were laid down most of the district was covered by a shallow tropical sea, in which the deposition of calcareous sediments generally kept pace with slow subsidence. However, the Gainsborough Trough crossed the extreme south-west of the district, and within it both deposition and subsidence were more rapid. Most of the trough deposits are probably limestone, though geophysical evidence suggests that there could be sandstones at depth and mudstones in the upper parts of the sequence.\n\nIn succeeding Namurian times, increasing amounts of mud, silt and sand reached the district, firstly as deltaic and eventually as fluvial sediments, to form the Millstone Grit. Marine deposition was reduced to periodic inundations which produced thin mudstone 'marine bands' within the otherwise brackish and freshwater mudstones, siltstones and sandstones.\n\nDuring the deposition of the higher Millstone Grit strata and the overlying Coal Measures, cyclic sedimentation predominated, producing innumerable repetitions of a sequence beginning with marine mudstone and overlain in turn by fluvial and lacustrine mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, seatearth and coal, the two last indicating terrestrial vegetated conditions. Overall thickness variations suggest that the rate of subsidence, although nowhere rapid, was slightly greater in the north-west.\n\nThe Carboniferous rocks were uplifted, faulted and gently folded by the ensuing Hercynian earth movements, and then subjected to prolonged erosion. For much of the succeeding Permian and Triassic periods the district lay in the southwestern part of a vast intracontinental basin which stretched eastwards into central Europe and which experienced a hot, dry, low-latitude climate. Initial deposition, probably late in early Permian times, was of wind-blown sands which form a thin veneer unconformably mantling the denuded Carboniferous rocks. In the late Permian the basin was occupied by the shallow inland 'Zechstein Sea', which underwent five major, and many minor cycles of transgression and regression, and which at times during regressions became hyper-saline. In the district these cycles produced repeated sequences of dolomitic limestones, dolomites, evaporites (mainly anhydrite but including halite) and clastics (mainly red desert-derived mudstones). By early Triassic times the Zechstein Sea had disappeared, and thick red fluvial sands, the Sherwood Sandstone, spread across the district. Later in the Triassic another hypersaline sea developed to the east and, within the district, the reddish dolomitic and anhydritic fluvial, lagoonal and littoral muds of the Mercia Mudstone were deposited. As the Triassic Period came to a close the basin was invaded by the sea, and the fully marine shallow-water muddy sediments of the Penarth Group were laid down across the district, although there was one temporary partial reversion to more restricted basinal conditions.\n\nOpen-sea sedimentation continued in the district through most of the succeeding Jurassic Period, interrupted only by temporary incursions of brackish and freshwater sediments and by transient phases of emergence that were more pronounced towards the north because of differential uplift along the Market Weighton Structure. Deposition during the early Jurassic was mainly of mud and silt in generally quiescent, warm, shallow, marine water, forming the dark mudstones and thin silty limestones of the Lias. At times, phases of extreme shallowing led to the formation, probably to the north and west, of iron-precipitating lagoons, the sediments from which were later redeposited in the district as ironstones. Following extensive uplift towards the end of the early Jurassic, considerable erosion was experienced before the unconformably overlying Redbourne Group was laid down. These sediments are more varied in lithology. The initial marine transgression led to the deposition of the thin ferruginous Northampton Sand. This was subsequently overlain during a temporary regression by the thin brackish-water sands and muds of the Grantham Formation. The succeeding marine calcareous muds with ooliths and silts of the Lincolnshire Limestone accumulated as coastal shoals with some adjacent coral knolls. Following another regression, freshwater and brackish sands and muds spread across the district to form the Glentham Formation. Thin coals and limestones within this sequence reflect intervals of emergence and marine transgression respectively. The succeeding Cornbrash Formation was deposited during another marine transgression, but this thin limestone formation contains evidence of emergence and erosion. The overlying Ancholme Clay Group contains at its base the littoral and sublittoral sands and muds of the Kellaways Beds. Deeper water, more quiescent, open-sea, muddy conditions like those in the early Jurassic were re-established, but there were short-lived periods of shallowing, which gave rise to sandier sequences like the Brantingham and Elsham Sandstone formations.\n\nTowards the end of the Jurassic, intermittent minor earth-movements were renewed. Some of the Ancholme Clay was denuded prior to deposition of the sublittoral Lower Spilsby Sandstone and, following another break in sequence at the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary, the Upper Spilsby Sandstone was laid down. After a further depositional break, the products of iron-precipitating lagoons were redeposited as the Claxby Ironstone. The succeeding Lower Tealby Clay represents a temporary return to quiescent, open-sea, muddy conditions, before further shallowing and clearing of the water induced the formation of the Tealby Limestone. Renewed deepening led to the deposition of the ferruginous sandy oolitic muds of the Roach Formation. Towards the middle of Cretaceous times there was substantial uplift and erosion. Erosion was more vigorous towards the north, and Lower Cretaceous deposits survive only in the south-east of the district. In the north, erosion removed not only the Lower Cretaceous rocks, but also much of the Ancholme Clay and, still farther north, just beyond the district, the only Jurassic rocks remaining are the lower part of the Lias. When the sea slowly spread over the district again just before the onset of late Cretaceous time, sublittoral reworking produced the thin sandy and locally pebbly Carstone. As the inundation progressed the supply of clastic sediment diminished and deposition became dominantly calcareous. An initial thin layer of reddish calcareous mud, the Hunstanton or Red Chalk, was succeeded by deposition of white Chalk, mainly consisting of minute coccoliths, which continued throughout late Cretaceous time.\n\nFrom the late Cretaceous onwards until a few hundred thousand years ago, a time span of some 65 million years encompassing the Tertiary Era and more than half of the Quaternary Era, there is no evidence of sedimentary deposition in the district. During this time uplift to the west initiated erosion which eventually exposed Jurassic rocks over much of the district and Triassic rocks in the west. Most theories of preglacial drainage evolution include the premise that the regional river pattern was initiated on a surface that sloped down to the east. On this surface the precursors of the present eastern Pennine rivers established courses that once probably continued eastwards across eastern Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire. Attempts have been made to correlate both the Humber Gap and various dry gaps across the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds with the courses of the original rivers. Ultimately, however, the Ouse and the Trent developed as subsequent streams along softer outcrops, diverting much of the original drainage.\n\nThis long period of uplift and erosion was terminated late in the Quaternary by the onset of glacial conditions. Ice invaded the district at least twice. On the first occasion it covered the entire district, cutting and filling a major sub-glacial drainage channel between Kirmington and Immingham, and possibly another in the Humber Gap, which it may even have initiated, and leaving other glacial deposits elsewhere. In one of the subsequent interglacial phases the sea rose to about 22 m above OD, depositing estuarine sediments at Kirmington, and in a later interglacial episode it cut a cliff into the Chalk along the eastern side of the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds, its base at about 1 to 3 m above OD. During the last glaciation ice invaded only the north-eastern part of the district, but the resulting glacial blockage of the Humber Gap produced the extensive Lake Humber in the Vale of York and the Trent and Ancholme valleys. Thick laminated clays and silts were deposited in the lake, together with beds of sand and gravel around the margin. The accompanying cold and vegetation-poor conditions allowed wind-blown sand to accumulate in several areas. With the amelioration of climate and the postglacial rise of sea level, thick and extensive fluvial and estuarine deposits and peat formed in low-lying areas. The constantly changing course of the Humber channels and the periodic growth and destruction of intertidal banks and islands show that deposition and erosion are still active within the estuary.\n\nChapter 2 Carboniferous\n\nThe oldest known rocks in the district, entirely concealed, are of Carboniferous age. All the 14 available boreholes which prove these rocks are situated near the western margin of the district; indeed six of them (Corringham Nos. 3, 5, 7–10) are grouped at one locality in the south-west. Spital Borehole, just south of the district, and North Ewster Borehole, just to the west, have also been considered in this account. Crosby Borehole, drilled between 1907 and 1912, was cored throughout, as were most of the Coal Measures strata in the British Coal's North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes. Details from the other boreholes, all drilled by British Petroleum or its predecessors, are derived largely from chipping samples and (except for Spital Borehole) from geophysical logs, but limited lengths of core from these boreholes have yielded valuable fossil evidence. Particulars of Burton on Stather Borehole in this chapter refer to the hydrocarbon borehole, not the water borehole of the same name. Unverified macrofossil identifications, derived mainly from the two British Coal boreholes, are given here in quotes.\n\nThe Carboniferous Period lasted approximately from 365 to 290 million years ago (Forster and Warrington, 1985), and the British sequence was deposited in equatorial latitudes (Smith et al., 1981). The chronostratigraphical range proved in the district is summarised in (Table 1). In northern England there are several different depositional facies in the lower part of the succession, reflecting the presence of slowly subsiding 'blocks' and more rapidly subsiding 'basins', 'troughs' and 'gulfs'. One of these troughs, the NW–SE orientated Gainsborough Trough, extends across the south-western extremity of the district.\n\nDinantian (Carboniferous Limestone)\n\nBy analogy with the surrounding region (e.g. Edwards, 1967, pp.14- 23) several hundred metres of limestone and associated rocks probably underlie the district, but only the topmost beds have been proved (Figure 3). The fossils recovered from these suggest a late Dinantian age.\n\nIn Butterwick Borehole [SE 8421 0563] the lowest cores comprise 11.27 m of pale brownish grey massive limestone, medium-grained but with some finer grained layers. A few brachiopods, including Gigantoproductus sp. and a fragment of the coral Lithostrotion junceum, imply a late Asbian or Brigantian age. Chippings from the overlying beds are of cream to white limestone, coarsely crystalline in parts, with traces of grey to black mudstone. A 3.36 m core near the top of the limestones consists of interbedded pale greyish brown, medium-grained limestone and dark grey, thin-bedded, partly argillaceous limestone, with layers of dark grey chert up to 13 mm thick. The paler limestone yielded a few brachiopods, including Brachythyris sp. and a smooth-shelled spiriferoid. Dr A R E Strank reports (personal communication) that foraminifera and algae from these beds are 'of Brigantian aspect'.\n\nThe limestone at the bottom of Corringham No. 7 Borehole [SK 8963 9300] is pale brown, buff and white, and some chippings suggest the presence of calcite veins. The highest 7 m are probably thinly bedded.\n\nThe cored limestone from the bottom of Spital Borehole [SK 9656 9115] is pale fawn to white, compact and porcellanous. According to Dr Strank (personal communication) foraminifera and algae from about 1 m below the top of the limestone suggest a Holkerian or Asbian age; the apparent absence of Brigantian fossils possibly indicates a depositional break or an erosive episode at the top of the limestone.\n\nNamurian (Millstone Grit)\n\nThe Namurian sequences known in the district are shown on (Figure 3). Of the Corringham boreholes only No. 7 proved a complete succession, but No. 1 [SK 8940 9276], being mainly cored, is also included. Fossil evidence is confined to the upper strata within the Gainsborough Trough, and even here only the three younger Namurian stages are recognisable. The differences in thickness between sequences within the trough and on the block testify to differential subsidence. With the evidence available, correlation within the trough is difficult, and between trough and block it is virtually impossible except in the uppermost strata.\n\nBeds below the Gracilis Marine Band (pre-Marsdenian)\n\nThese beds largely consist of mudstones and siltstones with sandstones of varying thickness. There are a few thin limestones, which occur mainly near the base, and a few thin coals and/or seatearths are recorded at higher levels. In Corringham No. 7 Borehole the lowest 19 m comprise dark grey to black siltstones with thin black and white-mottled sandy limestones. Similar beds from boreholes on the block southwest of the Gainsborough Trough may be partly of late Dinantian age on the basis of gamma-ray correlation with beds in the Ashover area (Smith et al., 1973, pp.12, 15, 17, pl.II). Unfortunately, no gamma-ray log is available for this part of Corringham No. 7.\n\nThe succeeding 60 m of strata are dark grey to black pyritic silty mudstones, siltstones and thick fine-grained variably calcareous sandstones, with a few thin grey and white-mottled silty and sandy limestones. Brachiopod spines and crinoid debris were recorded from a limestone at about 1755 m in this borehole. Some of the sandstones are noticeably angular-grained, and in places they contain large green biotite flakes. The lowest 40 m or so of strata in Blyton Borehole [SK 8435 9555] are similar, but more argillaceous, and there is a pebbly layer at the top, similar to that at 1720 m in Corringham No. 7 Borehole. Most of the succeeding 120 to 150 m in Blyton and Corringham No. 7 boreholes, and also the lowest 85 m of strata preserved in Corringham No. 1, are paler and less pyritic than the lower beds. The sandstones are generally coarser; some are calcareous, others have siliceous and silty matrices. Subrounded and rounded grains have been noted in them, as also have feldspar and biotite. A few 'ironstone' layers, apparently nodular, occur in the mudstones and siltstones.\n\nThe lowest marine band, at 1641.88 m in Corringham No. 1 Borehole spans at least 0.15 m of dark grey pyritic silty mudstone containing Lingula sp., Orbiculoidea sp., hindeodellid bars and Elonichthys sp. Similar and possibly equivalent mudstone in Corringham No. 7 Borehole yielded only a possible fish fragment. These fossils are at a comparable stratigraphical level to a Lingula-bearing layer occurring 3.63 m above a bed containing Reticuloceras cf. reticulatum, indicative of the Kinderscoutian Stage, in South Leverton No. 1 Borehole [SK 7945 8103] to the south-west (Smith et al., 1973, p.17, plate II). In Burton upon Stather Borehole (oil) [SE 8787 1883], mudstone at 1846 m containing spores and Curvirimula sp. denoting a Kinderscoutian or Marsdenian age may be at the same level.\n\nIn Corringham Nos. 1 and 7 boreholes there are thick, locally coarse-grained and pebbly feldspathic sandstones containing tourmaline and chlorite in the lower part of the succeeding beds. They are lithologically comparable to the Kinderscout Grit farther west. Plant debris occurs throughout these beds, and there are scattered rootlets and distinct seatearths in the upper part, and thin 'ironstones' near the top. In Corringham No. 1 Borehole a marine band in the middle of the beds comprises at least 1.55 m of dark grey silty mudstone with Lingula mytilloides and Orbiculoidea cf. nitida.\n\nGracilis Marine Band (Marsdenian)\n\nThe base of the Marsdenian Stage is marked by the Gracilis Marine Band, which has been proved in several of the Corringham boreholes. In No. 3 the lowest part of the band comprises at least 0.45 m of calcareous medium to coarse-grained sandstone containing phosphatic debris, Schizophoria sp. and fish debris. Elsewhere the main part of the band, up to 3.70 m thick, consists of dark grey micaceous silty mudstone, locally carbonaceous and pyritic, and containing sand laminae, scattered sand grains and clasts of sandstone. Its fauna comprises Serpuloides sp., L. mytilloides, productoid protegulum, Caneyella sp., Sanguinolites sp., turreted gastropod, Anthracoceratites sp. (abundant), Bilinguites gracilis, hindeodellids indet., Idiognathoides sinuatus, Elonichthys sp. and Rhadinichthys sp.\n\nBeds between the Gracilis and Cancellatum marine bands (Marsdenian)\n\nAt Corringham these beds are similar to those below the Gracilis Marine Band, being largely arenaceous in the lower part and containing seatearths and thin 'ironstones' near the top. The sandstones are, however, finer grained and more micaceous. One of the seatearths locally carries a thin coal. Three marine bands have been proved in the upper beds. The lowest band (in micaceous siltstone at 1539.39 m in No. 1 Borehole) yielded Hyalostelia sp., L. mytilloides and fish debris: the middle band (in grey mudstone at 1528.12 m in No. 1 Borehole) yielded L. mytilloides, a ribbed shell fragment, and a scolecodont fragment; the highest band (in dark micaceous silty mudstone at 1523.70 m in No. 1 Borehole) yielded Hyalostelia sp., Serpuloides stubblefieldi, L. mytilloides and a fish fragment. In the absence of goniatites none of these marine bands is positively identifiable, but it seems likely that one of them is the Superbilinguis Marine Band. If so, the thick underlying sandstones presumably represent the Ashover Grit; the Chatsworth Grit, if present, is thin.\n\nThe Cancellatum Marine Band (Yeadonian)\n\nThe base of the Yeadonian Stage, marked by the Cancellatum Marine Band, cannot be distinguished with certainty amongst several indeterminate marine bands in the district. However, in view of its wide regional occurrence and the common presence of productids and crinoids within it, it is thought to be represented in Corringham No. 1 Borehole by part of 2.44 m of dark grey silty mudstone at 1514.25 m which yielded Hyalostelia sp., Paraconularia sp., L. mytilloides, ?productoid, malacostracan remains (cf. Pseudogalathea?),crinoid debris and Rhabdoderma sp., and in Corringham No. 2 Borehole by part of 5.65 m of 'dark' micaceous siltstone and mudstone at 1529.64 m containing a productoid fragment, L. mytilloides, O. nitida, crinoid debris and fish fragments. Identification of the Cancellatum Marine Band elsewhere is more tenuous. It may be represented in Blyton Borehole by part at least of 4.70 m of dark grey micaceous silty mudstone at 1458.62 m, containing Serpuloides stubblefieldi, L. mytilloides, Euphemites sp., Elonichthys sp. and Planolites ophthalmoides, in Butterwick Borehole by 'dark' micaceous sandy siltstone containing L. mytilloides at 1419.72 m, and in Spital Borehole by 'Lingula'-bearing beds at about 1623 m.\n\nBeds between the Cancellatum and Subcrenatum marine bands (Yeadonian)\n\nThese beds cannot be delineated precisely because of uncertainty in the identification of both marine bands, but they are clearly thin. In Corringham No. 1 Borehole they lie within the following sequence:\n\nDepth m Undoubted Coal Measures to 1492.61 Mudstone, dark grey, micaceous, silty; Hyalostelia sp. at 1493.06 to 1493.35 Sandstone, grey, micaceous, with mudstone partings to 1494.10 Mudstone, dark grey, micaceous, silty, with interbedded thin sandstones to 1495.65 Core not recovered (thought to be mudstone) to 1498.09 Mudstone, dark grey, silty; L. mytilloides, O. cf. nitida from 1498.40 to 1498.91 to 1499.28 Mudstone, brown, micaceous, silty to 1499.58 Sandstone, pale grey, fine-grained, with mudstone partings; rootlets near top to 1507.91 Siltstone, grey, micaceous, with interbedded thin sandstones to 1510.82 Presumed Cancellatum Marine Band (see above)\n\nThe Cumbriense Marine Band may be the fossiliferous mudstone at 1498.91 m, in which case the overlying sandstone is the Rough Rock, only 0.75 m thick, and the Subcrenatum Marine Band is represented only by specimens of Hyalostelia sp. Alternatively, the Subcrenatum Marine Band may be at 1498.91 m, in which case the Rough Rock is the substantial sandstone close below, and the Cumbriense Marine Band may rest immediately on, and be indistinguishable from, the Cancellatum Marine Band. The second interpretation is the one preferred here, for it gives the best 'fit' with sequences farther west. Its application to the other boreholes in the district is shown in (Figure 3), where the conjectural correlation of Burton upon Stather Borehole is based largely on its lithological similarity to boreholes farther west, notably Crowle No. 1 [SE 7734 1193].\n\nWestphalian (Coal Measures)\n\nThe Coal Measures proved in the district are shown on (Figure 4), (Figure 5) and (Figure 6), which cover respectively the Westphalian A, B and C stages. Fossil bands, coals and seatearths allow a fair degree of identification and correlation even though the district lies well east of detailed provings in the Yorkshire Coalfield. Most of the faunas quoted can be matched with those at comparable stratigraphical levels farther west. For the main coal-bearing strata above the Vanderbeckei (Clay Cross) Marine Band only two comprehensively described cored sequences are available, namely those from the British Coal North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes. Coal thicknesses are quoted only from the cored sequences. The correlations show that, as Westphalian time progressed, generalised regional subsidence to the north or north-west replaced differential subsidence in the Gainsborough Trough as the dominant cause of thickness variations. Marine band nomenclature is that of Ramsbottom et al. (1978); other lithostratigraphical names are informal.\n\nWestphalian A (Lower Coal Measures)\n\nSubcrenatum Marine Band\n\nThe Subcrenatum (Pot Clay) Marine Band is thought to be represented in Corringham No. 1 Borehole by dark grey silty mudstone containing L. mytilloides and O. cf. nitida at 1498.91 m. In the other Corringham boreholes the equivalent mudstone has yielded Hyalostelia sp., possibly Serpuloides stubblefieldi, and fish debris. The conjectured correlatives in Blyton and Butterwick boreholes (Figure 4) yielded only L. mytilloides.\n\nSubcrenatum Marine Band to Kilburn Coal\n\nThese strata contain four marine bands in their lower part. In Corringham No. 1 Borehole all four consist of dark grey silty mudstone. The lowest, at 1493.06 m, contains Hyalostelia sp. spicules and equates with one of the marine bands within the 'Soft Bed' sequence of Yorkshire. The marine band, 1.24 m thick at 1487.22 m, contains S. stubblefieldi, L. mytilloides and fish debris and was tentatively correlated with the Listeri (Alton) Marine Band by Smith et al. (1973, pl.III). It is here thought more likely to be the Honley (or First Smalley) Marine Band, in which case the 1.83 m-thick band with L. mytilloides and Rhadinichthys sp. at 1481.43 m, correlated by Smith et al. (ibid.) with the Forty-Yards Marine Band, must be the Listeri. This latter band is responsible for a distinctive peak on the gamma-log, a feature of the Listeri Marine Band elsewhere. The highest of the four marine bands contains L. mytilloides at 1475.59 m. Rhadinichthys sp. was found in the succeeding 1.09 m, and pyritised Carbonicola aff. proxima in 0.81 m of mudstone at 1471.90 m. This 'mussel' indicates the C. proxima Fauna characteristic of the beds above the Norton Mussel Band, and so identifies the underlying marine layer as the Amaliae (Norton) Marine Band (Smith et al., 1973, pl.III), resting on a seatearth at the horizon of the Norton Coal. The 'trace' of coal at 1449.63 m in Corringham No. 7 Borehole could therefore well be the Upper Band Coal of the Chesterfield district (Smith et al., 1967, pp.84, 115).\n\nNone of the marine bands proved elsewhere in the district in these strata (2.73 m of dark grey silty mudstone at 1493.41 m with sponge spicules, Serpuloides sp., L. mytilloides, turreted gastropod, Platysomus sp. and Rhadinichthys sp. in Corringham No. 6 Borehole; 3.83 m of dark grey silty mudstone containing L. mytilloides at 1440.18 m in Blyton Borehole; 0.31 m of dark mudstone originally reported to contain Lingula'at 1408.18 m in Butterwick Borehole) can be identified with any certainty. In Burton upon Stather Borehole the medium- to coarse-grained sandstone around 1650 m resembles the Crawshaw Sandstone, but it is more likely to be the Loxley Edge Rock of the Sheffield area (Eden et al., 1957, pp.34–45).\n\nThe silty mudstones, siltstones and silty sandstones between the Norton Mussel Band and the Kilburn Coal are appreciably micaceous, and are broad equivalents of the Elland Flags of western Yorkshire and the Wingfield Flags of Derbyshire. In Corringham No. 1 Borehole, a cochliodont tooth, Rhadinichthys sp. scales and Planolites ophthalmoides were found in the 10 m interval above 1468.65 m. Sandstones are concentrated at two levels, which correspond approximately to the Greenmoor (or Brincliffe Edge) Rock and the overlying Grenoside Sandstone of south Yorkshire. The lower sandstones are locally calcareous and contain coarse-grained layers; a seatearth and/or thin coal is widely present within them. The upper sandstones are characterised by large flakes of brown and green mica. No trace has been found of the 'Kilburn Marker' (Strong in Falcon and Kent, 1960, p.52), a black chamositic siltstone occurring elsewhere between the two sandstones. Corringham No. 1 Borehole yielded fish debris just below the higher sandstones and a fragment of Orbiculoidea cf. cincta has been found at the same level in Corringham No. 6. This marine indicator has no known correlative elsewhere. The Kilburn Coal (the Better Bed of west Yorkshire) is possibly up to 0.30 m thick locally; it was not recorded in Corringham No. 1 and Butterwick boreholes.\n\nKilburn Coal to Low 'Estheria' Band\n\nThese beds are largely argillaceous, with several seatearths and/or thin coals. A mussel band above the Kilburn Coal in Corringham Nos. 1 and 5 boreholes yielded Curvirimula sp., Naiadites sp., cf. Carbonita and fish debris. Another mussel band, above a thin coal at 1400.56 m in Corringham No. 1 Borehole (which is presumably either the Black Bed Coal or the Crow Coal of western Yorkshire), contains Carbonicola aff. bipennis, and so indicates the C. bipennis Fauna. In this same borehole the 15 m of strata above 1394.54 m yielded Spirorbis sp., Carbonicola sp., Curvirimula spp. including C. subovata and C. trapeziforma, cf. Naiadites, Carbonita humilis, Geisina arcuata, Rhadinichthys sp. and Rhabdoderma sp. In Butterwick Borehole, Elonichthys sp. is recorded at 1302.26 m, and indeterminate 'mussel' fragments occur both below and above. The higher coals and seatearths in these beds may equate with the Beeston coals of west Yorkshire, but the Low Silkstone Coal, elsewhere lying immediately below the Low 'Estheria' Band, is represented only by a seatearth.\n\nThe Low 'Estheria' Band\n\nThis band, proved in most of the Corringham boreholes and in Butterwick Borehole, is up to 0.56 m thick. It consists largely of dark grey to black carbonaceous and locally canneloid mudstone, passing up in places into paler silty mudstone. Its fauna comprises Euestheria sp., G. arcuata, Elonichthys sp., Rhabdoderma sp. and Rhizodopsis spp. including R. sauroides; coprolites are also present.\n\nLow 'Estheria' Band to Vanderbeckei (Clay Cross) Marine Band\n\nThese strata contain some thick coals and substantial sandstones, but correlations are speculative. In Butterwick Borehole C. trapeziforma occurs just above the Low 'Estheria' Band, and fish debris, including Rhadinichthys sp., was found some 5 m higher, just above a thin sandstone. In Blyton Borehole the same thin sandstone carries a thin coal which may be the Blocking (or Top Silkstone) Coal in view of the fish debris above it. In both these boreholes the succeeding seatearth/thin coal is possibly the Middleton Eleven Yards Coal (the Threequarters Coal of Derbyshire). All these strata are cut out at Corringham by a thick sandstone lying at about the level of the Slack Bank (or Silkstone) Rock of western Yorkshire.\n\nThe Thorncliffe Coal complex is identifiable by the prominent C. cristagalli Fauna above it. In Butterwick Borehole the fauna, ranging through 12.95 m of mudstone, comprises Spirorbis sp., Anthracosphaerium aff. dawsoni, Anthraconaia fisheri/williamsoni, Carbonicola spp. including C. cristagalli and C. rhomboidalis, Naiadites spp. including N. flexuosus, and Geisina arcuata. North Ewster Borehole yielded 'Carbonicola', 'Naiadites'and 'Geisina' in the corresponding strata, and in Corringham Nos. 2 and 6 boreholes the fauna comprises Spirorbis sp., Carbonicola spp. including C. cristagalli, C. aff. obtusa and C. oslancis, N. aff. flexuosus, Carbonita salteriana, G. arcuata and Rhabdoderma sp. The thick overlying coal (1.22 m in Butterwick Borehole and 1.96 m with 'dirt' layers in North Ewster Borehole) is the Parkgate Coal. This seam is cut out in Corringham No. 7 Borehole by the Parkgate Rock, which is well developed in Blyton Borehole but absent farther north. In Butterwick Borehole, Naiadites sp. and fish debris including Platysomus sp. occur in mudstones above the Parkgate Coal, and the overlying seatearth and its correlative in North Ewster Borehole probably indicate the Low Fenton Coal horizon.\n\nThe occurrences in Butterwick Borehole (at and above 1209.04 m) of C. cf. bipennis, C. oslancis, Naiadites aff. subtruncatus and Curvirimula sp. or Naiadites sp., and in Burton upon Stather Borehole (above 1416.71 m) of C. cf. oslancis, C. cf. rhomboidalis, N. cf. flexuosus and G. arcuata are similar to faunas found between the Deep Hard and Deep Soft coals in the East Retford district (Smith et al., 1973, p.65). In Blyton Borehole the thick seams at about 1185 m may represent the Flockton Thin/Deep Soft coals, but they are not recorded elsewhere in the district.\n\nWestphalian B (Middle Coal Measures, in part)\n\nVanderbeckei (Clay Cross) Marine Band\n\nThis band has been identified with certainty only in North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes, where it comprises up to 0.62 m of dark grey laminated and slightly silty mudstone containing Lingula sp., ?ostracods and fish debris. Specimens of L. mytilloides and Rhadinichthys sp. were formerly erroneously believed to have come from 0.88 m of strata at 1280.13 m in Corringham No. 7 Borehole, but no core was taken at this depth; they are now thought to have come from Corringham No. 9 Borehole. There are old and inconsistent records of 'Lingula' at two depths between 1488.95 and 1455.42 m in Spital Borehole, where the presence of Lingula sp. and fish debris has recently been confirmed in chipping samples from 1492 to 1484.38 m and at 1456.94 m; the lower occurrence is believed to be due to contamination, but the upper occurrence is thought to be approximately in situ.\n\nVanderbeckei (Clay Cross) Marine Band to Swallow Wood Coal\n\nThese beds are fairly consistent in lithology and thickness, allowing reasonably firm correlation. In Rock Abbey Borehole pyritised mussels, including 'Naiadites'were found immediately above the Vanderbeckei Marine Band, and other mussels, including 'Anthracosia', occur in several layers in the succeeding 25 m of strata. The overlying seam, presumed to be the Second Ell Coal of the East Retford district, is 0.30 m thick in Rock Abbey Borehole and 0.40 m in North Ewster Borehole. At the latter, the overlying mudstone yielded 'Spirorbis', 'Anthracosia', 'Naiadites'and fish scales. The Lidget Coal of the East Retford and Goole–Doncaster districts lies between two thin sandstones which expand locally in the Rock Abbey–Corringham area. In the two cored boreholes, it is split into two thin leaves. A thin buff limestone was reported in Blyton and Corringham No. 7 boreholes in the mudstones below the Haigh Moor Coal. As in many places farther west, the latter is split into two or more seams. In Rock Abbey and North Ewster boreholes three seams range through 2.26 and 3.79 m of strata respectively, their thicknesses in the latter borehole being, in upward order, 0.68 m, 0.44 m (including thin 'dirt' layers), and 0.32 m. The overlying mudstones in these boreholes contain 'Spirorbis', 'Anthracosia', 'Naiadites' ostracods and fish debris. Except in the extreme south-east they are succeeded by sandstone at the level of the Haigh Moor Rock. Unidentified mussels are present locally in the mudstones between this sandstone and the Swallow Wood Coal. This latter seam is 0.28 m thick in Rock Abbey Borehole and 0.12 m in North Ewster Borehole.\n\nSwallow Wood Coal to Barnsley Coal\n\nThese beds show considerable lateral variation, and their correlation is speculative. In North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes the mudstones above the Swallow Wood Coal yielded 'Spirorbis', 'Anthracosia', '?Naiadites'and ostracods (including 'Geisina').The mudstones above the succeeding seatearth or thin coal, probably the Waterloo Marker, contain 'Spirorbis', '?Anthraconaia', 'Anthracosia', 'Naiadites' and fish teeth, scales and spines. In the overlying strata, up to the base of the Barnsley Coal, there are at least three seams and/or seatearths. In North Ewster Borehole the thicknesses of these, in ascending order, are 0.42 m (with a thin 'dirt' layer), 0.22 m (cannel), and 0.02 m. Each has a 'mussel' band above it, and these contain 'Anthracosia' and 'Naiadites'in the lowest, 'Anthracosia' in the middle one, and 'Spirorbis' and 'Naiadites' in the highest. The coals presumably include the First Waterloo and Dunsil coals, but exact correlation is impossible.\n\nThe Barnsley Coal has been identified in Burton upon Stather and North Ewster boreholes by comparison with sequences farther west. It is 2.01 m thick (including thin 'dirt' layers) in North Ewster Borehole but thins markedly to the south-east, being represented in Rock Abbey Borehole by only 0.19 m of coal within a sequence of closely spaced seatearths containing coaly streaks.\n\nBarnsley Coal to Winter Coal\n\nThese strata are subject to appreciable lateral variation, and only broad correlations are possible. The strata between the Barnsley and Kent's Thick coals halve in thickness from Burton upon Stather to North Ewster boreholes, the latter seam being identified in both boreholes by comparison with other holes farther west. In North Ewster Borehole the Kent's Thick Coal comprises four leaves totalling 1.48 m of coal within 2.40 m of strata. Wider splitting is suspected farther south-east, where the Kent's Thick may split into two thin seams in Blyton Borehole and three in Rock Abbey Borehole. In North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes 'Spirorbis', 'Anthracosia' and fish debris have been found above the Kent's Thick Coal.\n\nTwo apparently persistent coals or seatearths in the succeeding 20 to 30 m of strata lie within the Kent's Thin/Hatfield High Hazel interval and vary between 0.39 and 0.47 m thick in North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes. 'Spirorbis' and 'Anthracosia' occur above the lower of these at North Ewster. Two higher seams are separated by a fault breccia at Rock Abbey. These have been identified by British Coal as leaves of the Brinsley Coal of Derbyshire and are, in ascending order, 1.02 m (with a 0.65 m dirt layer) and 0.60 m thick. Only vague traces of the higher of these seams occur farther north. Although no 'mussels' were found in these strata in North Ewster or Rock Abbey boreholes, pyritised 'Anthracosia' from the bottom of Crosby Borehole presumably come from the beds above the Hatfield High Hazel. The Winter (or Abdy) Coal is locally split into two leaves, which comprise 0.74 m of coal and 0.26 m of 'dirt' in North Ewster Borehole.\n\nWinter Coal to Aegiranum (Mansfield) Marine Band\n\nThese strata are fairly consistent laterally, allowing reasonably firm correlation. In North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes 'Spirorbis' and pyritised 'Anthracosia' and 'Naiadites' have been found above the Winter Coal. The thin, and locally split, Two-Foot Coal, with leaves up to 0.29 m thick at Rock Abbey, and fish debris between them at North Ewster, is identifiable by comparison with boreholes farther west, where the overlying Maltby (Two-Foot) Marine Band is widely present. This marine band has not been found in the district, but the overlying mussel band is represented by 'Spirorbis', 'Anthracosia' and 'Naiadites' in North Ewster Borehole. Northward thickening of the overlying sandstone may have cut out the Two-Foot Coal in Burton upon Stather Borehole. In North Ewster Borehole the Meltonfield Coal comprises six leaves totalling 0.63 m of coal (the thickest leaf being 0.41 m) in 1.57 m of carbonaceous mudstones and seatearths; 'Anthracosia' is recorded above it. In this borehole, the Newhill Coal (the Clowne Coal of Derbyshire) is 0.09 m thick, but it is not traceable across the district, and neither the Manton 'Estheria' Band nor the Clowne Marine Band, which farther west occur respectively below and above the Newhill Coal, have been found. The Swinton Pottery Coal, 0.10 and 0.13 m thick in North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes respectively, is overlain by mudstone containing 'Anthracosia', 'Naiadites', 'Carbonita' and fish scales. The overlying Haughton Marine Band comprises up to 1.70 m of dark grey to black, variably silty and partly canneloid mudstone containing foraminifera, 'Serpuloides', 'Lingula', fish debris and 'Planolites'. The Sutton Marine Band has not been found, but the Wheatworth Coal is widely traceable, being 0.80 and 0.40 m thick in North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes respectively. The tentative identification of the Wheatworth Coal in Burton upon Stather Borehole implies that the underlying thick sandstone there is the Oaks Rock of west Yorkshire, which has cut out most of the strata above the Meltonfield Coal.\n\nWestphalian C and D (Middle Coal Measures, in part, and Upper Coal Measures)\n\nAegiranum (Mansfield) Marine Band\n\nThis marine band marks the base of the Westphalian C Stage, and is 7.68 and 6.89 m thick in North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes respectively. In the latter, a 0.25 m calcareous siltstone containing cone-in-cone structures may be the 'Mansfield Cank' (Dunham in Edwards and Stubblefield, 1948, pp.251–253). The recorded fauna of the band comprises foraminifera, 'Lingula', '?Dunbarella', '?Edmondia', mussels, gastropods, fish debris and 'Planolites ophthalmoidies'. In Crosby Borehole 'blue shale and ironstone' containing 'Lingula mytilloides', '?Productus' and goniatites at 1075.94 m is presumed to be this marine band, and its conjectured position in Butterwick, Blyton and Corringham No. 7 boreholes coincides with a gamma-ray peak.\n\nAegiranum (Mansfield) Marine Band to Shafton Marine Band\n\nIn North Ewster Borehole, bivalves including 'Naiadites' occur close above the Aegiranum Marine Band. The succeeding thin sandstone is at the level of the Acton Rock farther west; it appears, from the log of Burton upon Stather Borehole, to thicken greatly towards the north-western part of the district. In North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes, the Houghton Thin (or Second Wales) Coal is 0.60 and 0.48 m thick respectively. The Sharlston Yard Coal at Rock Abbey comprises three thin leaves totalling 0.22 m of coal within 0.65 m of mudstone, and 'Spirorbis', mussels (including 'Naiadites') and '?Strepsodus' and other fish debris occur above. This coal was not proved at North Ewster, but the overlying faunal layer is represented by mussels including 'Anthracosia'.\n\nThe Glasshoughton Rock varies considerably in thickness and lithology (Figure 6). Locally it unites with the underlying thin sandstone, and also in places with the Mexborough Rock above. In Rock Abbey Borehole it is represented by an extremely thin, fine- to coarse-grained conglomeratic sandstone. The presumed Sharlston Low Coal in North Ewster and Rock Abbey boreholes is 0.24 and 0.23 m thick respectively. If this identification is correct, a pronounced gamma-ray peak above the coal at Rock Abbey may indicate the tonstein found at this level in the East Retford district and elsewhere (Smith et al., 1973, p.89), and the thin coal capping the overlying sandstone would be the Sharlston Top, presumably cut out elsewhere by the Mexborough Rock. In Crosby Borehole a 3.96 m band of 'Blue Bind (Marine)' at 1013.31 m, containing 'Lingula' in the lower part and 'Carbonicola' above, may be the Edmondia Marine Band.\n\nExcept in the north, the Mexborough Rock is thick, locally coarse grained, pebbly and conglomeratic. In Butter- wick Borehole it cuts down to rest on the Glasshoughton Rock. The presence of 'Estheria' above the Mexborough Rock in North Ewster Borehole accords with similar records at this level elsewhere in the region; it also identifies the 0.32 m coal in this borehole as the Shafton Coal. In Rock Abbey Borehole the presumed Shafton Coal is 0.73 m thick, including 'dirt' layers.\n\nShafton Marine Band to Cambriense (Top) Marine Band\n\nIn North Ewster Borehole the Shafton Marine Band comprises 2.30 m of grey, variably silty mudstone containing foraminifera, 'Lingula', 'Orbiculoidea', 'Myalina', pyritised 'Carbonita', fish debris, Planolites' and, in the upper part, cf. 'Anthracosia pruvosti' and 'Estheria'. Slightly higher in the same borehole there is a mussel band containing 'Naidites' and 'Geisina', with 'Estheria' immediately above. These faunas compare well with those from the equivalent strata farther west and south-west. The 18 m or so above the presumed Shafton Coal in Rock Abbey Borehole, within which the Shafton Marine Band would be expected to lie, are almost all siltstones with thin sandstones. Somewhat higher, however, a solitary ?Tomaculum at 1013.29 m indicates the position of a marine band, presumably the Cambriense Marine Band. The records of marine fossils from two beds of 'Rotten blue shale' in Crosby Borehole (3.96 m thick at 987.55 m and 3.65 m thick at 993.34 m) are suspect. The higher band, which is said to have yielded 'Lingula mytilus', 'Myalina compressa', 'Beyrichia' and, at the top, 'Carbonicola' and 'Naiadites' with 'Anthraconaia modiolaris' some 8 m higher, is likely to be the Shafton Marine Band; the lower band probably represents cavings from it. In Burton upon Stather Borehole a gamma-ray peak close below the base of the Ackworth Rock at 1043 m may be produced by the Cambriense Marine Band. This band has probably been cut out by the Ackworth Rock in North Ewster and Butterwick boreholes.\n\nCambriense (Top) Marine Band to Brierley Coal\n\nThese beds are the Ackworth Division of Goossens and Smith (1973). They can be delineated only in North Ewster and the more northerly boreholes, where the two dominant components, the Ackworth Rock and the Newstead Rock, are well developed. In Crosby Borehole the lowest bed of the presumed Ackworth Rock is a thin feldspathic sandstone at 959.51 m containing fragments of cannel coal, 'Anthracomya phillipsii' and 'Beyrichia'. Anthraconauta phillipsii is the most characteristic mussel above the Cambriense Marine Band, although it is rarely found within or below the Ackworth Rock. Both the Ackworth and Newstead rocks consist largely of medium-grained sandstones with, in places and mainly in the upper part, interbedded siltstones and ironstone lenses. Coarse-grained sandstones and some conglomeratic layers containing rolled fragments of discoloured ironstone and of siltstone are locally present, and parts of both sandstones are patchily coloured red and purple. The thin coal at 864.11 m in Butterwick Borehole and a thin carbonaceous mudstone containing coaly streaks and resting on a seatearth at 854.08 m in North Ewster Borehole are the Scofton Coal or a subjacent unnamed seam. In the latter borehole they separate the Ackworth Rock from the Newstead Rock.\n\nThe Brierley Coal and the beds above\n\nThese strata are recognisable only in North Ewster and Butterwick boreholes and, except possibly for the highest few metres in the former, are referable to the Brierley Division of Goossens and Smith (1973).\n\nIn North Ewster Borehole the Brierley Coal is presumed to be the 0.10 m seam at 811.17 m because the dark grey coal-free mudstone-seatearth immediately above it is a characteristic feature of this coal elsewhere. Although the overlying Brierley Rock is well developed in this borehole, the equivalent strata in the nearby Butterwick Borehole are described as 'variegated marls' with thin siltstones and fine-to medium-grained sandstones. This suggests a rapid lateral passage, something to which the Brierley Rock is prone. A gamma-ray peak in the overlying mudstones at 764.80 m in North Ewster Borehole may indicate the position of the mussel and Euestheria-bearing Fourth Cherry Tree Marker at the base of the Hemsworth Division of Goossens and Smith (1973).\n\nThe highest Carboniferous strata, lying immediately beneath the sub-Permian unconformity, commonly exhibit staining, the mudstones and siltstones being red, purple, yellow and 'variegated', and the sandstones red, pink, orange and brown. Within the district, only four boreholes provide relevant information. In Burton upon Stather and Butterwick boreholes red colours extend down 18 and 22 m respectively below the Permian, and 'variegated' and partly yellow strata are recorded for another 40 and 70 m respectively. In Burton upon Stather Borehole the 4.27 m of strata immediately beneath the Permian rocks are 'muddy grey siltstones' possibly owing their colour to reduction by the subsequent late Permian Zechstein Sea. In Blyton Borehole the topmost 12 m are stained, as are the highest 46 m in Corringham No. 7 Borehole.\n\nChapter 3 Permian and Triassic\n\nRocks of Permian and Triassic age are described together here because they have some features in common and because the position of their mutual boundary is uncertain. They underlie the entire district, dipping eastwards beneath Jurassic rocks. The youngest Triassic strata crop out in the extreme west but are largely obscured by Quaternary deposits. Most of the information on the Permian and Triassic comes from deep boreholes (Crosby, Risby, South Cliffe and Spital) within and just outside the district, of which only the first was cored. In other boreholes the only information available is that provided by chipping samples and, in some cases, geophysical logs. Interpretation of some of the latter is based on unpublished work by Dr D W Holliday.\n\nThe lithostratigraphical subdivisions of the Permian and Triassic rocks recognised within the district are set out in (Table 2). Permian rocks rest unconformably on the Carboniferous, and the Triassic includes those basal strata of the Lias Group that lie below the lowest occurrence of the ammonite Psiloceras.\n\nOn palynological evidence the lowest marine strata (in the Don Group) are placed in the Upper Permian, miospore assemblages from the same group in the adjoining Goole/Doncaster district being indicative of a late Permian (Kazanian–Tartarian age (Gaunt, in preparation). The exact position of the boundary between the Permian and Triassic is unknown. In eastern England it is thought to lie at the base of, or within the Saliferous Marl (Warrington et al., 1980, pp.9 -10) but, because the junction between the Saliferous Marl and the overlying Sherwood Sandstone Group is markedly diachronous, it is possible that in places it is within the lower part of the latter. Tethyan ammonites are used to define stages within the Triassic, but as these are absent in most of western Europe, including Britain, palynomorphs (principally miospores) are used to recognise the Triassic stages in this district.\n\nThe Permian and Triassic periods, spanning some 40 and 45 million years respectively, together lasted from about 290 to about 205 million years ago (Forster and Warrington, 1985). During this time, that part of the earth's crust on which the British Permian and Triassic rocks were being formed was drifting northwards from a few degrees to just over 30° north of the equator (Smith et al., 1981). By early Permian times the hot humid swampy environment of the late Carboniferous had disappeared. Hercynian uplift, folding and faulting, and differential subsidence associated with the opening up of a seaway in the 'north Atlantic', had produced a substantially denuded upland landscape separating intracontinental basins.\n\nThe three principal components of the Permian and Triassic rocks of the district, namely reddish clastics, dolomitic carbonates and evaporites, clearly reflect deposition around the margin of a fairly arid intracontinental basin situated in hot low latitudes. This, the Southern North Sea Basin, stretched from eastern England across the North Sea into central Europe, and subsidence continued within it for much of Permian and Triassic time. Depending on the rate of subsidence and on the periodic but transient establishment of restricted oceanic connections, this basin was variously the focus of aeolian, fluvial, lacustrine and shallow marine sedimentation. The Don, Aislaby, Teesside, Staintondale and Eskdale groups were formed in and around the basin when it was occupied by the Zechstein Sea, a shallow epeiric sea which persisted for most of late Permian time. This sea was subject to five major (and many minor) cycles of transgression and regression, which produced repeated sequences of carbonates, evaporites and clastics. In eastern England these five cycles are designated EZ1–EZ5 (Smith, 1970). They equate with the Z1–Z5 cycles of Germany (although there are differences of interpretation) and correspond broadly to the lowest five named groups in (Table 2).\n\nThe Kingston upon Hull–Brigg district lies near the south-western margin of the Southern North Sea Basin, which was flanked to the west by uplands in the region of the present Pennines, and to the south by the so-called London–Brabant Massif.\n\nBasal Permian Sands\n\nResting everywhere unconformably on Carboniferous rocks, the Basal Permian Sands extend northwards into County Durham, eastwards under the North Sea, and westwards, impersistently in places, to outcrop. They consist of loose quartz sand or friable, largely incohesive sandstone. Although most of their features, such as rounded sand grains and dune bedding, imply an aeolian origin, some aspects suggest localised subaqueous reworking (Versey, 1925; Pryor, 1971). Farther south they are associated with, or pass laterally into rock-pediment breccias. The Basal Permian Sands are assumed to be a westerly continuation of the basal beds of the German Rotliegendes, and may therefore be of early Permian age. However, some subaqueous reworking probably occurred during the initial transgression of the Zechstein Sea in late Permian times.\n\nWithin the district the sands are dark to pale grey and white, and fine to coarse grained. Individual grains, which in Nettleton Borehole include chert, range from subangular to rounded, some of the latter being of the polished 'millet-seed' variety that indicates an aeolian phase in their history.\n\nHowever, localised clayey matrices and partings or thin beds of white, grey and red silty clay occur in some of the eastern boreholes and suggest that in places the higher beds were subaqueous. In a few borehole logs the sands are described as pyritic. They appear not to be more than 12 m thick (Figure 7), except in the south-east. Here, in Nettleton Borehole, they are 34 m thick, and include 10 m of red to pale yellow-brown sandy and apparently dolomitic 'clay shale' in the middle of the sequence. This record helps to validate the identification by Edwards (1951, p.271) of 32 m of Basal Permian Sands in Spital Borehole, farther west, for 8 m of 'fawn limestone' were recorded there in the middle of sands which, from their pink, purple and hematitic appearance, might otherwise have been regarded as weathered Coal Measures. It is possible, however, that cavings coincidentally contaminated both boreholes at the same stratigraphical level.\n\nDon Group\n\nMarl Slate\n\nThe Marl Slate formed in the initial Zechstein transgression, its marked sapropelic and bituminous nature suggesting reducing conditions and restricted circulation. Although previously thought to be a shallow lagoonal deposit, the presence of thin mantles of Marl Slate over high ridges of Basal Permian Sands suggests depths locally in excess of 60 m and implies a substantial and rapid initial transgression (Smith, 1979). The high metallic concentrations present in County Durham and Germany may be due to phytoplankton activity or to high salinity.\n\nWithin the district (Figure 7) the Marl Slate consists of up to 3 m of darkish grey, grey-brown, bluish and black mudstone and shale. It is commonly fissile, locally silty, pyritic, bituminous and carbonaceous, and in a few places also apparently slightly calcareous or dolomitic. In the south it appears to be impersistent, for it was not detected in Nettleton and Spital boreholes, and if present in Blyton Borehole is difficult to distinguish from the overlying Lower Marl. In the East Retford district, farther south-west, some interbanding of the Marl Slate with the underlying Basal Permian Sands, and with the overlying Lower Magnesian Limestone, was noted by Smith et al. (1973, p.113).\n\nLower Magnesian limestone\n\nThe Lower Magnesian Limestone is highly variable in thickness and lithology, the result of deposition in estuarine, littoral, open-shelf, reef, basin-slope and basin environments (Smith, 1974) during the maximum transgressive phase of EZ1.\n\nAn argillaceous member, the Lower Marl, is recognised at the base of the Lower Magnesian Limestone in the East Retford district (Smith et al., 1973, pp.112–120) and adjacent areas. It continues into the southern part of the present district (Figure 7), where it consists of olive-grey to red, variably calcareous and dolomitic, micaceous mudstone and siltstone with thin interbedded dolomite. Traces of anhydrite and halite were recorded within it in Nettleton Borehole.\n\nAbove the Lower Marl (or, in the north-west, above the Marl Slate) are pale to dark grey and locally reddish brown, silty, finely crystalline, dolomitic limestones, containing laminae and thin layers of red-brown to grey calcareous dolomitic mudstone and siltstone; a few scattered quartz grains have also been noted. These argillaceous carbonates and the subjacent Lower Marl are interpreted as an estuarine facies, formed in a wide embayment, the Nottingham Bight (Smith, 1970), with a source of terrigenous detritus to the south-west.\n\nIn the southern and western parts of the district, the overlying carbonates are mainly pale to medium grey and grey-brown dolomitic limestones which apparently become more dolomitic towards the top. They are largely finely crystalline except near their top in the south-west, where some of the highest beds are oolitic in Blyton Borehole, and coarsely crystalline (suggesting recrystallised oolites) in Corringham No. 10 and Butterwick boreholes. The presence of oolitic limestone at this level invites comparison with similar rocks occurring in the upper division of the Lower Magnesian Limestone at outcrop farther west. Except in the extreme south-west, appreciable traces of anhydrite occur about half way up the crystalline limestones and may possibly represent a sabkha indicative of the Hampole Discontinuity (Smith, 1968). Traces of anhydrite are also recorded at higher levels in these carbonates, which represent an open-shelf facies built out from the south-west above and beyond the estuarine facies; they form a thick platform in the south-west, with a steep sinuous edge facing north-east towards the centre of the basin (Figure 8)a. North-eastwards beyond this shelf edge the entire Lower Magnesian Limestone thins appreciably and consists of pale to dark grey and brown, fine-grained, silty, calcitic dolomite, interbedded with grey to red-brown, calcareous and dolomitic, bituminous, micaceous and locally pyritic mudstone and siltstone; in the extreme north there is also an appreciable amount of anhydrite. These strata represent a basin-slope facies formed in deeper-water euxinic conditions.\n\nHayton Anhydrite\n\nLike its analogues elsewhere, the Hayton Anhydrite is thickest on the basin slope of the underlying carbonates, and thins both towards the shelf and towards the basin centre. At the western end of the horizontal section B′–B″ on the Kingston upon Hull (80) Geological Sheet, the Hayton Anhydrite is shown as being 60–70 m thick. Reinterpretation of boreholes during preparation of this memoir, however, suggests that the Hayton Anhydrite thins markedly westwards along the most westerly 6–10 km of this section and is absent at its western end (Figure 8)b.\n\nTwo subdivisions are discernible, the lower and thicker being mainly anhydrite, and the upper containing considerable amounts of dolomite. The origin of these evaporites is uncertain. In Germany the equivalent thick marginal Werraanhydrit was thought to be an offshore deposit formed in water that was not necessarily shallow, but some English interpretations (Taylor and Colter, 1975; Taylor, 1980; Smith, 1980a) suggest deposition in shallow intertidal to supratidal sabkha conditions around the margins of a hypersaline sea.\n\nBoth subdivisions thin out south-westwards although this trend is reversed in the extreme north-east of the district (Figure 7) and (Figure 8)b. The lower subdivision consists largely of translucent to white, mottled pale grey and grey-brown massive anhydrite, much of which is finely crystalline, although descriptions such as ' saccharoidal' and ' sucrosic' suggest coarser textures in places. Pale brown to grey, finely crystalline, locally bituminous, slightly silty, calcitic dolomites are also present. In the absence of cores, the relationships between anhydrite and dolomite are uncertain. Some logs suggest an intimate mixture but in others, notably that of Brigg Borehole, the dolomite clearly forms discrete beds or masses. Traces of red and grey dolomitic mudstones are also present, probably representing laminae or stylolitic layers.\n\nThe most common lithology in the upper subdivision is pale buff to grey, finely crystalline, variably silty, calcitic dolomite. Anhydrite or gypsum is also abundant, as inclusions, veins and beds. There is, in addition, interbedded red and grey variably silty and dolomitic mudstone, particularly towards the south-west.\n\nThe prevailing view (Taylor and Colter, 1975; Smith, 1980a) is that, in marginal Zechstein areas where it is thickest, the Hayton Anhydrite and its analogues are younger than the Lower Magnesian Limestone and its equivalents (Figure 7), (Figure 8)a and (Figure 8)b. It presumes a major lowering of Zechstein sea level and a marked increase in salinity prior to deposition of the Hayton Anhydrite, followed by considerable sea-level variation consequent upon oceanic recharge but with continuing high salinity, even allowing for the 'permeable barrier' hypothesis put forward by Taylor (1980). The juxtaposition of carbonate and anhydrite within the district (Figure 7), however, suggests that some of the lower part of the Hayton Anhydrite may interdigitate with, and so be coeval with, the middle, locally anhydritic, part of the Lower Magnesian Limestone. It is also possible that some of the slightly anhydritic dolomites in the highest part of the Lower Magnesian Limestone may be the southwesterly continuations of the upper subdivision of the Hayton Anhydrite. If the upper subdivision of the Hayton Anhydrite oversteps the lower, as postulated by Taylor and Colter (1975, fig. 2A) and Taylor (1980, fig. 4), it would be extremely difficult to separate it from the underlying Lower Magnesian Limestone. Farther south-west, as off the Norfolk coast (Taylor, 1980, p.96), the identity of the upper subdivision may be 'lost in red shales and mudstones, probably equivalent to the Middle Marls of north-eastern England'. If these possibilities were to prove correct, there is less need to invoke marked sea-level variations during the EZ1 cycle.\n\nAislaby Group\n\nMiddle Marl\n\nAt outcrop, to the west of the district, the Aislaby Group is represented almost entirely by the Middle Marl. It consists of red-brown and grey-green mudstone and siltstone, locally dolomitic and sandy. Ripple marks and cross-bedding imply that this terrigenous detritus, presumably derived from the west, was deposited in anastomosing streams on intertidal flats and in shallow lagoons or playas on or fringing a wide flat coastal plain (Smith, 1974).\n\nIn the south-west of the district (Figure 7) the Middle Marl is up to 61 m thick and contains thin layers of dolomitic limestone and traces of anhydrite. To the north and east it is split into two leaves by the Kirkham Abbey Formation and Fordon Evaporites. Neither leaf persists to the extreme north-east of the district. The lower leaf is sandy in the west, in Butterwick Borehole; thin white to fawn dolomitic limestones become more prominent farther east and north, as do the anhydrites. The upper leaf is generally sandy and contains thin dolomitic limestones and both layered and nodular anhydrite.\n\nIt is apparent that the EZ2 transgression did not reach the south-western limit of the district, except possibly to form transient fringing lagoons. In contrast, the absence of terrigenous sediments in the extreme north-east suggests either that this area was subject to continuous carbonate-evaporite deposition before and after the EZ2 transgression, or that undetected nonsequences are present there.\n\nKirkham Abbey Formation\n\nThe Kirkham Abbey Formation of Yorkshire and the northeastern Midlands does not extend to outcrop. It forms a thick carbonate shelf in the eastern part of the region, and thins markedly farther east into a widespread basinal facies. This shallow-water shelf facies represents the maximum transgressive phase of the EZ2 cycle. According to Smith (1980a, pp.19- 21) 'it seems likely that salinity in the shelf sea was only slightly higher than in normal sea water', but it was appreciably higher in the nearshore lagoons and in the groundwater.\n\nWithin the district the formation thins from the north-east and is not recognisable in the extreme south-west (Figure 8)c. It is composed predominantly of white to pale buff calcitic dolomite (Figure 7) of open-shelf facies. In the north and east it is appreciably oolitic, and pisoliths are recorded in the upper beds in Risby Borehole [TA 0106 3578]. Abundant algal traces, including oncoliths and stromatolitic banding, have also been noted in the northern boreholes. Where oolitic and algal traces are not distinct, various cellular, granular and, less commonly, platy textures have been recorded. The matrix is mainly finely crystalline dolomite but there are also traces of clear to white anhydrite, particularly in the lower beds, and anhydrite has also been noted in 'shrinkage' vugs, syneresis cracks, and inclusions. Traces of carbonaceous (?sapropelic) laminae were found in Risby Borehole. Farther south-west the formation becomes more finely crystalline and near its south-western limit consists of dolomitic mudstone with some interlaminated red and brown anhydritic mudstone. It is slightly more anhydritic in western boreholes such as Burton upon Stather (oil) and Butterwick, and traces of pseudomorphs after halite were noted in the former. These lithological variations suggest a southwestward passage from subtidal conditions to intertidal mud flats. In Risby Borehole the thickness (which is close to the known maximum), the presence of pisoliths (noted by Taylor and Colter (1975, p.254) as occurring near the outer shelf edge) and traces of carbonaceous laminae all suggest that the transition to a basin-slope facies occurs only a short distance to the north-east.\n\nFordon Evaporites\n\nThe Fordon Evaporites are lithologically the most variable, and volumetrically the largest of the 'Zechstein' formations. Unlike earlier formations they are thickest (in places more than 400 m) in the middle of the basin, though here, mainly under the North Sea, local thicknesses are distorted by halokinesis. Where undisturbed, the thick middle part of the formation consists mainly of halite, with anhydrite dominating the thin lower and upper parts. The origin of these basinal evaporites is uncertain. Smith (1980a, pp.21–22) favoured deposition 'in a range of predominantly shallow-water and peritidal environments during a phase of sea-level recovery following a sharp sea-level decline at the end of carbonate deposition'; but Colter and Reed (1980), who demonstrated an inherent foresetting arrangement, invoked a deep-water origin. Whatever the circumstances, these evaporites eventually filled in most of the Southern North Sea Basin, reducing it to a virtually flat plain around a small relict Zechstein Sea. Along their margins the evaporites are largely contained within the basinal slope of the underlying EZ2 carbonates, but they transgress thinly on to the carbonate shelf surrounding this slope.\n\nThis marginal zone extends into the north-eastern half of the district (Figure 8)d. There, in Risby Borehole (Figure 7), the lowest 8 m of the Fordon Evaporites are greyish white to pink mottled, massive anhydrite containing traces of vaguely pelletal, finely crystalline anhydritic dolomite and thin layers of red silty mudstone. The rest of the sequence, 41 m thick, consists of halite, with layers, up to 3 m thick, of pale grey massive anhydrite, thinner layers or laminae of red and greenish grey dolomitic mudstone, and traces of buff to brown finely crystalline, locally bituminous, dolomitic limestone. There is a marked westward thinning from Risby of the whole formation to a mere 3 m of white to pale grey massive anhydrite with some anhydritic dolomite in South Cliffe Borehole. The thinning is more gradual along the eastern margin of the district, for Brigg Borehole proved 26 m of evaporites. Here the lowest 11 m comprise finely crystalline to 'sucrosic', calcitic, dolomitic anhydrite; the upper part passes gradually, apparently by interdigitation, into interbedded grey to buff 'pellety' silty mudstone (with some siltstone) and halite, which is topped by 7 m of massive halite. The three sequences suggest deposition early in the EZ2 regression from localised sabkhas and evaporating lagoons or playas. There was also an input of terrigenous sediment, heralding the subsequent deposition of the upper leaf of the Middle Marl, and considerable postdepositional mineral changes due to the action of hypersaline groundwater. This interpretation implies that the thin basal and marginal anhydritic sequences within the district equate with the lowest subdivision (unit 1) of Colter and Reed (1980), and also that there is no representation within the district of their highest subdivision (unit 8), the supposedly transgressive anhydritic layer which these authors suggest is represented by a possible solution residue resulting from the EZ3 transgression.\n\nTeesside Group\n\nUpper Magnesian Limestone\n\nThe Upper Magnesian Limestone represents the open-shelf facies of the EZ3 cycle. The transgression reached almost as far as that of EZ1, but its shelf carbonates were built out farther towards the basin centre than those of the two earlier cycles. Conditions across this wide shelf were largely quiescent, producing carbonate muds, but oolites formed locally, probably nearshore, in moderate-energy shoals. During the transgressive phase salinity in the shallow shelf waters may not have been abnormally high.\n\nIn Risby Borehole (Figure 7) there is a thin basal layer of buff to black, finely crystalline, dolomitic limestone containing grey to black mudstone partings and anhydrite inclusions, which produces a high gamma-ray response. These characteristics suggest equivalence with the Grauer Salzton of Germany, a thin illitic shale which occupies a comparable stratigraphical position. The lowest beds of the overlying carbonates in Risby Borehole and the basal carbonates in South Cliffe and Nettleton boreholes are slightly argillaceous and silty, with partings and thin beds of grey and, in the north, red calcareous mudstones, inclusions of anhydrite, and minute amounts of carbonaceous debris, some identifiable as plant remains. The rest of the Upper Magnesian Limestone in the district, which thins gently but irregularly south-westwards (Figure 8)e, consists of white to grey and pale brown carbonate. In places, most of the lower part consists of dolomitic limestone, but dolomite becomes increasingly common upwards. Small amounts of anhydrite are present near the top in the more northern and eastern boreholes.\n\nMuch of the carbonate is finely crystalline but, except in the south-west, the upper part is also variably oolitic or contains textures described as coarse grained, granular, cellular and porous, which may represent recrystallised ooliths. Pisoliths were noted in the higher beds in Brigg Borehole. Algal remains, including oncoliths, are widespread, although not abundant, in the higher beds. Faunal remains include 'skeletal' debris and indeterminate bivalves (in Brigg Borehole) and ostracods (in Burton upon Stather Borehole). The incidence of ooliths, algal traces and anhydrite in the highest beds suggests shallowing at the onset of a regressive phase.\n\nBillingham Main Anydrite\n\nThe Billingham Main Anhydrite reflects a regressive phase in the EZ3 cycle. Within the district it is present only in the north and east (Figure 8)f, thinning out south-westwards from a maximum of 5 m. It comprises transparent to white and pale grey, partly massive and partly fibrous anhydrite containing traces of anhydritic calcitic dolomite. Grey dolomitic silty mudstone partings were noted in Nettleton Borehole. In Brigg Borehole about 5 m of silty mudstone containing at least one thin dolomite layer intervene between the anhydrite and the underlying Upper Magnesian Limestone.\n\nBoulby Halite\n\nThere are no clearly defined shelf or basinal facies of the Boulby Halite, which constitutes the main evaporitic part of the EZ3 cycle. Like the Fordon Evaporites, it thickens appreciably away from marginal areas. Allowing for halokinesis, it is up to 120 m thick offshore (Smith and Crosby, 1979) and about 90 m in the Whitby area.\n\nThe Boulby Halite has not been proved in the district, though it is believed to occur in the extreme north (Figure 8)f because of its presence in Risby and South Cliffe boreholes (Figure 7), where it is 18 and 12 m thick respectively. In Burton upon Stather Borehole 'minor salt' was recorded from mudstones resting on the Upper Magnesian Limestone, and in Crosby Borehole the equivalent strata were logged as 'Marl and Salt', but whether these represent the 'feather edge' of the Boulby Halite or are merely isolated occurrences of halite within the Carnallitic Marl is uncertain.\n\nStaintondale Group\n\nCarnallitic Marl\n\nThe Carnallitic Marl is the lowest leaf of the Upper Marl of peripheral western areas. It consists largely of terrigenous sediment but, unlike the Middle Marl, it continues basin-wards, thickening to 30 m in that direction. Sedimentary structures suggest shallow subaqueous deposition from anastomosing streams and in residual playas on a wide flat plain. There were intervals of desiccation, and the interstitial and nodular evaporitic minerals within the sediment may well have crystallised from hypersaline groundwater.\n\nWithin the district (Figure 7) the Carnallitic Marl largely comprises reddish brown and greenish grey, locally fissile and micaceous, silty mudstone with some siltstone. Green reduction haloes are widely present, as are nodules and inclusions of anhydrite and gypsum and traces of dolomite and calcite. Traces of 'salt' were recorded in the basal beds in Risby Borehole and in comparable strata (see above) in Burton upon Stather and Crosby boreholes. A 15 m red and grey sandstone containing 'marl' bands and gypsum traces is recorded from the middle of the sequence at Burton upon Stather. The Carnallitic Marl here is 28 m thick, and is 22 m thick in Brigg Borehole; elsewhere it is 9 to 15 m. The two thickest sequences lie just beyond the outer limits of the Billingham Main Anhydrite and the Boulby Halite, and may incorporate residues from solution of these evaporites, although in Burton upon Stather Borehole the sandstone, possibly a channel-fill deposit, has contributed appreciably to the expansion. Sandstones increase in thickness and number beyond the district to the south and west and all the components of the Upper Marl at outcrop eventually pass into sandstone (Smith et al., 1973, p.157 et seq.).\n\nUpper Anhydrite\n\nThe thin EZ4 Upper Anhydrite has ripple structures, small-scale cross-bedding and magnesitic laminae, which have led Smith (1974, p.138; 1980a, p.26) to envisage deposition in an extensive but shallow hypersaline sea, followed by considerable post-depositional mineralogical change. It extends across the entire district (Figure 7), with a thickness of 4 to 7 m, and consists largely of clear to white, pale grey and locally pink, finely to coarsely crystalline anhydrite containing some gypsum and, in Risby Borehole, traces of red and green mottled gypsiferous mudstone. In Butterwick Borehole the highest 2 m or so comprise grey to fawn finely crystalline dolomitic limestone. In Spital Borehole no anhydrite was recorded, and the formation is evidently represented there by interbedded fawn and brown limestone, a marginal facies according to Smith (1980a, p.26).\n\nEskdale Group\n\nSleights Siltstone\n\nThe Sleights Siltstone is the middle leaf of the Upper Marl of the peripheral western areas. Like the lower leaf (the Carnallitic Marl), it is a terrigenous, part-fluvial and partlagoonal deposit that becomes finer grained and more evaporitic towards the basin. Within the district (Figure 7) it is 6 to 13 m thick, with a slight north-eastward thickening, and consists mainly of reddish brown to greenish grey, locally calcareous and dolomitic, silty mudstone and siltstone containing reduction haloes and in places some finely divided carbonaceous debris. White and (rarely) pink fibrous gypsum is widespread, occurring in disseminated form and as nodules and veins. A few small pseudomorphs after halite were noted in Nettleton Borehole.\n\nTop Anhydrite\n\nEZ5 carbonates are unknown in the Zechstein basin, where the Top Anhydrite is merely the most extensive of several evaporitic layers within the dominantly terrigenous Eskdale Group. These evaporites are thought to have formed during transient expansions of the shallow residual Zechstein Sea, which by this time was little more than a central playa (Smith. 1980a, p.28).\n\nThe Top Anhydrite appears, largely on the evidence of geophysical logs, to extend into the northern and eastern parts of the district (Figure 7) as about 1 m of anhydrite. In some boreholes, notably Butterwick, only traces of white, pink and pale grey anhydrite or gypsum are recorded at this level.\n\nSaliferous Marl\n\nThe Saliferous Marl is the upper leaf of the Upper Marl of peripheral western areas. Like the other leaves it is a dominantly argillaceous formation, consisting mainly of reddish mudstone and siltstone with thin impersistent evaporites. Small-scale cross bedding, ripple structures and evidence of periodic or localised desiccation imply fluvial and shallow-water deposition (the latter in residual playas) on a vast plain that stretched across the Southern North Sea Basin. Thin sandstones are locally present near the top of the formation so that in places there is a transition into the overlying Sherwood Sandstone Group. These sandstones become thicker, more numerous, and occur at increasingly lower levels south-westwards. In the East Retford district (Smith et al., 1973, pp.157–161) the entire Upper Marl passes by interdigitation into the Sherwood Sandstone Group, the base of which is, therefore, demonstrably diachronous. Towards the north-east the lower sandstones pass laterally into argillaceous beds and, as a consequence, the offshore strata (the Bunter Shale Formation), comparable to the Saliferous Marl (Rhys, 1974), thicken considerably in this direction. The slightly more silty Brockelschiefer Member lies at the base of the Bunter Shale, and in Germany the base of the Triassic System is placed arbitrarily at its base. Correlation across the North Sea suggests, therefore, that the base of the Triassic, as defined in Germany, may lie in eastern England at or close to the base of the Saliferous Marl; where the latter is attenuated or absent the system boundary may be within the lower part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group.\n\nWithin the district the Saliferous Marl (Figure 7) consists mainly of reddish brown, and to a lesser extent greyish green, slightly micaceous, locally slightly calcareous, variably silty mudstone and siltstone. In Brigg Borehole it contains reduction haloes, small angular fragments of lignite and traces of pyrite; elsewhere small anhydrite nodules and layers with veins of white gypsum and/or anhydrite are widespread. Traces of grey to black micaceous shale and pseudomorphs after halite were noted in Risby Borehole. Siltstones, some of which are slightly dolomitic, become more common towards the south-west, and thin sandstones also develop in this direction. The formation is 56 m thick in Risby Borehole and thins irregularly south-westwards.\n\nSherwood Sandstone Group\n\nIn eastern England the Sherwood Sandstone Group includes rocks formerly called Lower Mottled Sandstone and Bunter Pebble Beds in southern areas, and Bunter Sandstone and Keuper Sandstone farther north. In Germany, where the terms originated, 'Bunter' and 'Keuper', although originally lithostratigraphical, have come to have chronostratigraphical implications. Palynomorphs (mainly miospores) have shown, however, that in Britain the lithostratigraphical and chronostratigraphical boundaries do not coincide. In consequence, British names incorporating the terms Bunter and Keuper have been replaced by others defined lithostratigraphically (Warrington et al., 1980). In Nottinghamshire the Sherwood Sandstone Group has been divided into the Lenton Sandstone Formation (formerly Lower Mottled Sandstone) and the succeeding Nottingham Castle Formation (formerly Bunter Pebble Beds), but farther north, where pebbles are virtually absent, the group remains undivided.\n\nThe Sherwood Sandstone Group of eastern England consists of mainly red-brown, fine- to medium-grained sandstone with sporadic thin lenses of red-brown to grey-green mudstone and layers of rolled mudstone fragments; rounded quartzitic pebbles are common in southern areas. Both parallel-bedding and cross-bedding are present. The sandstone is interpreted (Warrington, 1974) as a sequence of fluvial sediments deposited along the western margin of the intracontinental Southern North Sea Basin. Hot and generally arid conditions are implied by the reddish colours and localised occurrence of wind-rounded grains, ventifacts and desiccation cracks. The cross-bedding in the East Retford district dips mainly to the north-east (Smith et al., 1973, p.172, fig. 29), suggesting fan-like spreads derived largely from the south-west.\n\nWithin the district the characteristics of the Sherwood Sandstone Group are intermediate between those of the Nottinghamshire sequence, as represented in the East Retford district (Smith et al., 1973, pp.161–177), and those of the Yorkshire and offshore regions. In the extreme south it is possible to recognise representatives of the Lenton Sandstone and Nottingham Castle formations, but their vertical and lateral limits are indistinct, and no formal subdivision is attempted. An overall thinning is apparent from more than 450 m in the north-east to less than 300 m in the south-west (Figure 9).\n\nThe lowest sandstones, 18 to 44 m thick, are variably coloured red, brown, orange, grey, buff and white, and are micaceous, clayey, silty, well sorted and fine grained. The grains are mainly subangular to subrounded, but some layers are rich in rounded grains. Much of this sequence is cemented by a white slightly calcareous and locally gypsiferous clay matrix. The appreciably argillaceous nature of these sandstones is enhanced by numerous interbedded thin red silty mudstones which are in places gypsiferous and which contain green reduction haloes, minute carbonaceous debris and, in one such bed in Brigg Borehole, a fragment of lignite.\n\nThe succeeding main part of the Sherwood Sandstone thickens northwards from about 230 m to nearly 400 m and is distinguished from the underlying beds by being dominantly red, less argillaceous, generally coarser grained, and locally pebbly. At or just above the base there is a pebble layer in Nettleton and Crosby boreholes, and a distinctly coarse-grained sandstone in Corringham No. 10 and Butter-wick boreholes. In general the sandstones vary from fine- to coarse-grained and from well to poorly sorted, and the grains range from subangular to rounded. A white slightly calcareous clay matrix is locally present but much of the rock has been described as uncemented, unconsolidated, friable, porous and permeable. Pebbles are reported from most of the south-western boreholes, but they are clearly not abundant; some records suggest that they are scattered throughout the middle part of the group, but others imply concentrations at or near the base and at a level about half way up. Some thin red and green-mottled silty mudstone is present, mainly in the higher beds, and some beds are reported to be calcareous, dolomitic or gypsiferous. In South Cliffe Borehole interbedded red-brown and green silty mudstones containing gypsum, possibly in veins, occur about 90 m above the base of the group, but there is little or no trace of equivalent strata in adjacent boreholes. However, scarce traces of gypsum and anhydrite are reported elsewhere in the sandstone at various levels.\n\nIn the uppermost part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group there is an upward passage into paler, finer-grained and more argillaceous sandstones which, although their base is indistinct, appear to be thicker in the north (30 to 45 m) than in the south (5 to 15 m). Comparable strata have been noted farther to the north-east (Geiger and Hopping, 1968). These sandstones are mainly white, grey and buff, fine to medium grained, micaceous and silty, loosely cemented, friable and largely free of pebbles. The grains range from subangular to rounded. Numerous interbedded, thin, red and subsidiary grey silty mudstones and siltstones are also present. In some of the southern and western boreholes there are suggestions that the topmost san"
