        "text": "An Experimental Cruise: H.M.S. Hecate at Sea on her Passage to Heligoland.\n\nIllustrated London News, 26 July 1884\n\nThe engraving above shows Hecate on 15 July 1884, crossing the North Sea on an experimental voyage to the then British posession of Heligoland, near Germany. The flying deck is quite different to those of the Cerberus class ships. Also different is the breastwork deck which was extended out to the sides of the ship and aft in 1883 in order to increase stability and improve accomodation. Note that the fore turret has been turned inward to prevent the entry of water.\n\nHecate before her Superstructure Modifications, 1877 - 1883.\n\nCyclops, Hydra or Gorgon far left.\n\nClick image to enlarge.\n\nDaily News, 19 August 1882\n\nEXPERIMENTS ON HMS HECATE.\n\nSome important experiments were made on Saturday off Plymouth on board the Hecate, 4, double-screw iron armour-plated turret-ship. This vessel, together with Gorgon, Cyclops, and Hydra, her sister ships, was built on the same principle as the Devastation, but on a much smaller scale. It was discovered that they could in no way stand rough weather, and the belief was that powerful as they were, they could only be used for coast defence. About twelve months ago it was proposed to erect a superstructure on one as a test, with a view to secure not only greater stability but better accomodation for officers and crew. The Hecate was selected to be experimented upon, and in January last Messrs H. & R. Green, of Blackwall, who were entrusted by the Admiralty with the work took, the ship in hand.\n\nThe improvement made included the extension of the breastwork to the ship's side and the lengthening aft about 20 feet. The captain's apartments are now within the superstructure, instead of below the upper deck, and are well supplied with light and natural ventilation. The officers generally have the advantage of a commodious reading room. A sick bay has been fitted up, and provision made for carrying a quantity of patent fuel. Additional mess accomodation has been secured on the lower deck by the removal of the sick bay, and better cabins have been alloted to the warrant officers.\n\nThe sea-going qualities of the Hecate under her altered condition were fully tested on her way from the Nore to Devonport. Saturday's experiments were directed to firing the four guns in the turrets, to test the strength of the superstructure, which is composed of ½ inch steel. Another object **** was to discover the best places for fixing the four Nordenfelt guns with which the ship is to be supplied.\n\nThe vessel is armed with four 18 ton guns, two in each turret, both of which revolve. The four guns were first discharged with scaling charges. Then the left gun in the fore turret was loaded with a full charge of 44lb of powder and a common shell weighing 400 lb, and was discharged bearing on the port beam, at a horizontal elevation. The right gun in the same turret was next fired under similar conditions, but bearing on the starboard beam. Upon examining the superstructure it was found that two rivets had been started on the starboard side. The guns of the same turret were then fired with a battering charge of 70lb. of powder each and 400lb shell, but the concussion did no damage. They were then discharged simultaneously. The final experiment was the firing of an electric broadside of all four guns at once, bearing on the port beam. The concussion was considerable, but beyond the two rivets started, after the smallest charge, not the slightest damage was done — not even a pane of glass.\n\nGlasgow Herald, 26 December 1883\n\nGlasgow Herald, 8 January 1884\n\nNewcastle Courant, 20 June 1884\n\nHampshire Telegraph & Sussex Telegraph, page 8, column 1, 5 July 1884\n\nHampshire Telegraph & Sussex Telegraph, page 8, column 3, 5 July 1884\n\nHampshire Telegraph & Sussex Telegraph, 24 April 1886\n\nDetails of HMS Hydra Details of HMS Gorgon Details of HMS Cyclops"
