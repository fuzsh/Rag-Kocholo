        "text": "Heligoland is located 46-kms (29-miles) off the German Coastline and consists of 2 Islands: the populated Triangular 1-km2 (0.4 sq miles) Main Island (Hauptinsel) to the West, and the Düne (“dune”, Heligolandic: de Halem) to the East. “Heligoland” generally refers to the former Island. Düne is somewhat smaller at 0.7 km2 (0.27 sq miles), lower & surrounded by Sand Beaches. It is not permanently inhabited, but is today the location of Heligoland’s Airport.\n\nOn 3rd December 1939, Heligoland was directly Bombed by the Allies for the 1st time. The Attack, by 24 Wellington Bombers of 38, 115 and 149 Squadrons of the RAF failed to destroy the German Warships at Anchor.\n\nBob Gills Operation No.2? 27/28th January 1944 Heligoland\n\n515 Lancasters & 15 Mosquitos Despatched to Berlin. The German Fighters were committed to Action earlier than normal, some being sent out 75-miles over the North Sea from the Dutch Coast. A number of elaborate Feints & Diversions had some effect; Half of the German Fighters were lured North by the ‘Heligoland Mining Diversion‘ & Action in the Main Bomber Stream was less Intense than on recent Nights. The Attack on Heligoland served 2 other purposes apart from the actual Bombing of the Island itself (1) a Diversion for the Main Attack which was on Berlin (2) for Stirlings to lay Mines nearby under cover of the Attack.\n\nThe Berlin Target was Cloud-Covered again & Skymarking had to be used. Bomber Command was not able to make any Assessment of the Raid except to state that the Bombing appeared to have been Spread well Up & Down Wind.\n\n33 Lancasters Lost, 6.4% of the Heavy Force.\n\nExtensive Operations were carried out in support of the Berlin Raid.\n\n80 Stirlings & Wellingtons Flew to the Dutch Coast and laid Mines there, 21 Halifax’s did the same near Heligoland, both hoping to Draw the German Fighters up early.\n\n9 Aircraft flew RCM Sorties & 12 Mosquitos Flew Serrate Patrols.\n\n18 Mosquito-Bomber Aircraft dropped Imitation ‘Fighter Flares‘ away from the Main Bomber Routes to & from the Target.\n\n140 Aircraft were thus engaged in various Operations in support of the Main Berlin Raid. 1 Stirling Minelayer Lost.\n\n9 Mosquitos Bombed a Flying-Bomb Site at Herbouville, 8 Halifaxes flew Resistance Operations Sorties, 10 OTU Aircraft dropped Leaflets over France. No Aircraft lost.\n\nTotal effort for the Night: 697 Sorties, 34 Aircraft (4.9%) Lost.\n\nGardening – Euphemism for Mine Laying\n\nEglantine – Heligoland Approaches\n\nRosemary – Heligoland\n\nYams – Heligoland Approaches\n\nMine-Laying (by Stirlings on this Raid)\n\nAircrews had guidelines to follow when assigned to a “Gardening” Operation, it was not a matter of Flying directly to the intended area at any Altitude or Speed the Pilot desired then releasing your Ordnance and turning around. There were other variables to deal with also; High or Low Tide, Depth of the Water, the Direction of Approach, and then you have the Enemy Defences to deal with. Once the Target was designated there was a Flightpath selected for the Group of Bombers participating in the Nights “Gardening” Operation. There would likely be Bombing Raids taking place on the same Night and an Aircrew with a couple of Mines did not want to get mixed in with a Squadron headed to an Overland Target.\n\nAircraft(s) from the Pathfinder Squadron would assist the Group of Bombers using “Gee” leading their Flight Route then dropping a coloured Marker at a desirable visual pinpoint of Land. Once the Navigator informed the Pilot the intended Target was nearing the Pilot would make alterations to his Altitude & Speed, ideally, the Aircraft speed should be 180-mph, and Altitude at 1500ft. The Aircraft would now have to make a straight 12-mile Timed Run at this Altitude, and Speed any faster than 200-mph and the Parachute could be torn off. The Mines (usually 2 from a Halifax) are released between 3 & 5-sec Intervals (depending on the Type of Aircraft), their trajectory is curved; Gravity, Aircraft Speed, the Resistance of Air, the Nose fairing & Parachute were all factors in planting a Mine that will function. The Aircraft would continue in a straight line for another few mins to confuse the Enemy as to where the Mines were Jettisoned, completing the Drop a Crew would head for home; however, no Mining Mission was ever this straight forward.\n\nThe Minefields were often located in Enemy Channels, Harbours, Ports & Inland Waterways, all along the Atlantic Coast, the North Sea, & Baltic Sea. The Field was often narrow, ranging from 1,000ft to a mile across if the Tide was out and the Mine was dropped out of the Zone there was a chance the Enemy could retrieve it for examination. Furthermore, planting the Mine in an area not covered by a Minesweeper would be considered a waste."
