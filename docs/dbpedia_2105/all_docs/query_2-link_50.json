        "text": "Heligoland Red Rock. Photo by Dionysos1970- Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe 10 Little Known Facts about 34 Island of Heligoland\n\nIn Europe there exist two lands which are in different geographic regions and occupied by different people altogether that most people confuse about. Majority of them when they hear of Heligoland confuse it with Heligoland, which is situated in Germany, while the former is situated 1307 Kilometers away in Norway. The latter, Heligoland has a unique history and story tied to it which sheds more information about European world history and politics.\n\nHere are the 10 little known facts about the 34 islands of Heligoland.\n\n1. The land that keeps changing hands\n\nHeligoland is a small archipelago land that is situated in the North Sea. The North Sea has featured prominently in the history of sea-faring commerce, military affairs and resource extraction for the people and states on its coast. The Heligo islands were historically in possession of Denmark and later through military conquest changed hands to the United Kingdom as from 1807 to 1890.\n\nIt later came to be briefly managed as a war prize after the Second world war from 1945 to 1952 to later change hands to be part of the German State of Schleswig â Holstein.\n\n2. The land of many tongues of the land and Inspiration\n\nThe Heligoland Islands are the only German islands that exist not near mainland Deutschland. They lie approximately 43 miles from the mouth of River Elbe, and these islands inspired the composition of the German national anthem by the great composer August Heinrich Hoffman von Fallersleben who composed the lyrics Deutschlandlied en route to the islands\n\nOut of more than ten million people who speak German, 1037 come from the local population of the island. The local natives Frisians speak Halunder which is the Heligolandic dialect of the Northern Frisian language.\n\n3. The oldest Race in North West Europe Live here\n\nThe island of Heligo Island is not more than a mile long from the North West to the Southeast and is habituated by Frisians who are not Germans it is noteworthy to remember, as far as the records of the 1933 census dictate The Frisians lived as a distinct people for more than 20 centuries and are recognized by the Romans who deliberated them the title socii. .\n\nTheir unique history as principal opponents of the Roman people is recognizable in their valor as effective sea warriors, great navy officers and ship navigators. Their prowess is also recognized by King Albert.\n\n4. The Divided Single Island\n\nThe exposure of island has had its enduring rough times with storms from the sea due to its geographically exposed location which exposes it to endure rough times. A heavy storm in 1721 had the island flooded which almost cut it in half. The result of this is a smaller sandy island known as the Dune that is uninhabited and a square kilometer large rock which is 46 meters high and weighing over 25 tonnes known as the â Lange Annaâ.\n\nThe northern beach and the Dune Isle make up beautiful sandy beaches.\n\n5. The best landmark on the Island\n\nDuring the British occupation, the island then was a popular sport of relaxation because of its white sandy beaches. In 1901, then under the Germans, the first resort that allowed both men and women to bathe together was built. Since the island offers a tranquil place to stay and a natural monument of sandy beach the place offers unique attractive offers for tourists with little money to spend,\n\nNot only can one cater for their dream vacation, but one can get brand-name clothes, spirits, wine, and jewelry at cheaper prizes that you can bargain.\n\n6. Fresh Air and Breathe\n\nHeligoland Islands shows its best lateral weather uniqueness every season every year. The clean and mild air as well as the climate and the crashing waves make it a perfect spot to enjoy the place more than any German island in the whole of the republic. Not only is the weather great for people who suffer from mild to severe cases of breathing allergies or problems.\n\nThe warm air from the sea is therapeutic and its winters are dotted with most hours of sunshine.\n\n7. The Get-Away Place\n\nThinking of having a wedding? The rock in the open sea offers a perfect romantic adventure of a promise of life that the partners can see as they say their vows. The crashing of the waves against the rock slowly is eaten away but still stands solid. It is no surprise that Heligoland is a maritime excursion whose tourists find the place so special to share their nuptial vows to summatively live the legacy of the Islands as well as the valor of its people.\n\n8. Seals sunbathing\n\nTo nature lovers, the Heligoland islands offer safe sunbaked beaches and red rock that offer the grey seals a time to relax, copulate and nurse their young ones. The seals have permanent access to the beach all year long and you would see them sweating and their dreamy black eyes turned against the sun. As tourists enjoy the beach with them at the rock there is a barricade that separates them and the tourists.\n\nDuring the month of November, it is prudent to stay away at a distance of more than 30 meters since it is the time when seals give birth, therefore, being more territorial and can hurt you with their sharp claws and favor the Dune as their nursery.\n\n9. The Oberland Birds\n\nTo observe more natural colonies of gannets one would have to take the elevator or challenge themselves by taking the 184 stairs, and following the cliff train for 2 miles west. The breathtaking view of the north sea as well as the hidden gem of the young guillemots following and responding in turn to the call of the adult bird will leave you happy for the heart-beating exercise.\n\nThe adult birds showcase their diving prowess by jumping from the cliff at a height of more than 40 feet from the cliff in a seamless ripple-less dive that doesnât break into a splash.\n\n10. The ride to paradise\n\nThe best way to get to the Helgo Islands is through the ferry MS Helgoland which is operational between Cuxhaven and Heligoland all year round daily. Just like the seal, the ferry is always available to take you to Heligoland through the river from the port of Hamburg, two hours at a steady easy cruising pace down the river and imagine being a poet, across the north sea to the final destination paradise, Heligoland"
