        "text": "COSYNA (Coastal Observation System for Northern and Arctic Seas) is an operational coastal monitoring, forecasting and information system for the North Sea composed by fixed platforms, FerryBoxes, gliders and HF-radar systems. It is being developed by institutes of the German Marine Research Consortium (KDM) and collaborating institutions and is operated by the Hereon Research Centre. The infrastructure represents an investment of 9 M €. It was build up since 2007 and is fully operational since 2012.\n\nCOSYNA_UNH is a cabled underwater observatory operated by AWI together with Hereon since 2012 and is providing power, network connection and server support for the permanent operation of in situ sensor systems. The node system has 10 underwater pluggable access points (for network (100 Mbit/ 1Gbit) and power (48V / 2.5 Amp) and is equipped with a standard sensor carrier with an ADCP) and a CTD plus Chl-a fluorescence, oxygen and turbidity sensors for basic oceanographic measurements.The 10 access points are fully remotely controlled. The user gets a “virtual computer”on the COSYNA server on which she/he can log in via remote access software and install own programs to control her/his sensor.\n\nWeb site address: http://www.cosyna.de\n\nThe applicant can attach his/her own sensor and has full remote access.\n\nInstallation will be supported by a team of technicians and scientists of AWI/Hereon for preparing the instrumentation; service the instrumented node, support diving for installation and recovering of the sensors at the end and process the data. A “virtual computer” is also provided to the user for full access to the instruments installed underwater."
