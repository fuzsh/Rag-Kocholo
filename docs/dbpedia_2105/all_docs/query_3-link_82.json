        "text": "MED-VIINoneEcological ImpactCompetition In the Venice Lagoon, S. muticum was found to compete with the native red, brown, and green macroalgae by forming a canopy and shutting out light (Curiel et al. 1998). NEA-IINoneEcological ImpactCompetition Sargassum muticum has been reported to displace native algae in the Limfjord, Denmark, (Stæhr et al. 2000, cited by Schaffelke and Hewitt 2007). Its advantage over the native, perennial Halidrys siliqua may be due to its semi-perennial lifestyle, not having to invest in a sturdier structure for winter survival, and so is capable of more rapid growth in spring and summer (Wernberg et al. 2000). On the Isle of Cumbrae, Scotland, S. muticum was found to displace the native Dictyota dichotoma, probably through competition for light and substrate (Harries et al. 2007). In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, competition with the native Saccharina latissima was not seen. Instead, growth of S. muticum was slower in single-species plots, due to intraspecific competition. Disturbance and removal of the native seaweed was considered responsible for the expansion of S. muticum (Strong and Dring 2011). In the German Wadden Sea, competition with the native algae Polysiphonia nigrescens, Antithamnion plumula and Elachista fucicola, and also with settling Pacific Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) was seen. Reduced oyster settlement could affect epibenthic communities by reducing by limiting the expansion of hard substrate (Lang and Buschbaum 2010). NEP-IIIAlaskan panhandle to N. of Puget SoundEcological ImpactCompetition The invasion of Sargassum muticum resulted in displacement of native algae in the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound. A removal experiment resulted in recovery of native kelps (Britton-Simmons 2004). Modeling and experiments indicated that S. muticum invasions required a combination of disturbance and high propagule pressure (Britton-Simmons et al. 2008). In British Columbia, S. muticum rapidly colonized cleared areas, followed by decreased recruitment of native seaweeds (de Wreede 1983, cited by Schaffelke and Hewitt 2007). At low levels of abundance, S. muticum had few impacts, but at high levels, S. muticum excludes natives through competition for light (primarily) and space, resulting in reduced diversity and productivity. The impact increased with S. muticum density in a non-linear fashion (White and Shurin 2011). NEP-IIIAlaskan panhandle to N. of Puget SoundEcological ImpactFood/Prey There were fewer Green Sea Urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) at invaded sites, apparently because they found S. muticum unpalatable (Britton-Simmons 2004). However, the snail Lacuna vincta was 2-9X more abundant on S. muticum than on native algae. This preference seems to have been acquired in the last 30 years (Britton-Simon et al. 2011). P292_CDA_P292 (San Juan Islands)Ecological ImpactCompetition The invasion of Sargassum muticum resulted in displacement of native algae, in the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound. A removal experiment resulted in recovery of native kelps (Britton-Simmons 2004). Modeling and experiments indicated that S. muticum invasions required a combination of disturbance and high propagule pressure (Britton-Simmons et al. 2008). P292_CDA_P292 (San Juan Islands)Ecological ImpactFood/Prey Sargassum muticum was grazed by a high abundance, but low diversity of grazers, compared to native seaweeds. Common grazers were the amphipods Peramphithoe mea, Aoroides columbiae, Caprella laeviscula and Ischyocerus anguipes, and the snail Lacuna variegata. Much of the grazing was on periphytic diatoms, and the tissue consumption mostly occurs during the period of slow growth, before the annual dieback, and does not affect the seasonal abundance or dominance of the plant (Norton and Benson 1983). There were fewer Green Sea Urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) at invaded sites, apparently because they found S. muticum unpalatable (Britton-Simmons 2004). However, the snail Lacuna vincta was 2-9X more abundant on S. muticum than on native algae. This preference seems to have been acquired in the last 30 years (Britton-Simon et al. 2011). NEA-VNoneEcological ImpactCompetition In a lower intertidal region on the Bay of Biscay, northern Spain had negative impacts of the native red alga Gelidium spinosum, probably due to competition for light (Sanchez et al. 2005). Addition of nutrients in tide pools favored rapid growth and dominance of S. muticum, but colonization was resisted in plots with a dense canopy of the native Bifurcaria bifurcata (Sanchez and Fernandez 2005). Experimental removal of S. muticum found only limited impacts on total numbers of algal species, somewhat reducing the abundance of filamentous and foliose algae (Olabarrio et al. 2009b), or having no detectable impact on other algae (Sanchez and Fernandez 2005). High abundance of S. muticum in tide pools, in northern Portugal, was correlated with decreased abundance of native algae (Viejo et al. 1997). Modeling, based on field observations suggested that the most important feature favoring S. muticum over the native Cytoseira humilis was the persistence of non-fertile fronds of S. muticum, after reproduction, denying the space to Cytoseira humilis (Engelen and Santos 2009). Experiments with the effects of nutrient inputs found that S muticum had a complex response, and was favored by high inputs, with low variability, but not by low, highly variable inputs (Incera et al. 2009). In another set of experiments S. muticum became very abundant in tide pools with high nutrient input and mechanical disturbance (scraping with a chisel) (Bertocci et al. 2014). Nutrient fertilization of tidepools promoted the establishment and functional impacts (increased productivity and respiration) by Grateloupia turuturu and Sargassum muticum (Vieira et al. 2017). NEA-IVNoneEcological ImpactCompetition Sargassum muticum became the most abundant species in the intertidal of the French Atlantic coast, and was associated with a decrease in a native kelp (Laminaria digitata) (Belsher and Pommelec 1988; Cosson 1999, cited by Schaffelke and Hewitt 2007; Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015). It was also reported to colonize and displace Eelgrass (Zostera marina), in areas where the Eelgrass has declined, due to disturbance (Den Hartog 1997). NEP-VIPt. Conception to Southern Baja CaliforniaEcological ImpactCompetition Sargassum muticum colonized Giant Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) beds on Bird Rock, off Catalina Island, after a die-off, possibly caused by high water temperatures during El Nino. Shading by Sargassum muticum probably inhibited recolonization by the kelp. After experimental removal, the kelp recolonized the cleared areas (Ambrose and Nelson 1982). Several years later, Giant Kelp did recolonize Bird Rock (Foster & Schiel 1992, cited by Engelen et al. 2015). Removal experiments in tidepools at Little Corona del Mar in Newport Beach in southern California, showed little effect level, pool temperature, seaweed biomass and community composition, or faunal composition. Recovery of S. muticum populations was rapid (Smith 2016). NEA-VNoneEcological ImpactFood/Prey Experiments with a range of grazing animals, the snails Littorina littorea, L. obtusata, Gibbula, spp., and Peringia ulvae, the sea-slug Aplysia punctata, the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis, and the isopod Stenosoma nadejda, generally preferred native algae to S. muticum, while the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus showed no preference. Preferences were variable, but experiments did suggest that S. muticum was not under high pressure from grazers (Monteiro et al. 2009; Cacabelos et al. 2010; Engelen et al. 2011). Sargassum muticum, washed up on beaches, was a major food source for the amphipod Talitrus saltator and, to a less extent, for the isopod Tylos europaeus (Rossi et al. 2009; Olabarria et al. 2010). The S. muticum wrack had higher nutrient content than that of a native alga (S. muticum), but there were not consistent differences in invertebrates using the two types of wracks (Rodil et al. 2008). Overall, the invasion of S. muticum has increased the biomass, light-use efficiency, primary production, and respiration of tide pool systems in Portugal. However, this effect disappears during the seasonal die-off of this seaweed (Vaz-Pinto et al. 2014). NEA-IIINoneEcological ImpactCompetition In experiments using assemblages of native algae and S. muticum reared in containers in the intertidal of Lough Hyne, Ireland, S. muticum had a negative impacts on the biomass of Fucus vesiculosus and, to a lesser extent, on Cladostephus spongiosus. In the Salcombe River estuary, England, S. muticum was able to attach to soft substrate within Eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds, because of the increased stability and decreased water movement (Tweedley et al. 2008). NEA-IIINoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change In experiments in Lough Hyne, Ireland, benthic animal diversity and species richness was higher in assemblages of native algae than those containing S. muticum, probably because S. muticum contains less habitat cover (Salvaterra et al. 2013). On the West Coast of Ireland, S. muticum supports dense growths of the filamentous brown alga Pylaiella littoralis, especially in sheltered sites, where the epiphyte growth, inhibited photosynthesis, growth, and caused mortality. Growth of other epiphytes and survival of S. muticum was better in more exposed sites (Baer and Stengel 2014). In the Salcombe-Knightsbridge Estuary (English Channel), Devon, England, invasion by S. muticum resulted in shorter blade length of Eelgrass (Zostera marina), and altered epibiota communities. Although S. muticum provides a more structurally complex habitat, and supports larger abundances of some taxa, its seasonal die-offs may limit the establishment of populations (DeAmicis et al. 2015). NEA-IVNoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change In turbid waters, Sargassum muticum replaces kelps, but provides habitat for fishes, crustaceans, and cuttlefish (Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015; Roux et al. 2021). Sargassum muticum does not directly compete with Eelgrass (Zostera marina, but when Eelgrass beds near Roscoff, France, are destroyed by natural shifts in the sediment, S.muticum quickly colonizes the empty spaces (den Hartog 1997). NEA-IVNoneEconomic ImpactFisheries Sargassum muticum can interfere with shellfishing and shellfish aquaculture, by covering the bottom, fouling shells, and equipment (Belsher and Pommelec1988); Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015) NEA-VNoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change In turbid waters, Sargassum muticum replaces kelps, but provides habitat for fishes, crustaceans, and cuttlefish (Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015). In a study of epifaunal invertebrates, in intertidal communities in Galicia, northern Spain, results showed that S. muticum supported levels of abundance and diversity comparable to those of two native seaweeds (Gestoso et al. 2012). At several locations on the coast of Portugal, the epifauna of S. muticum differs from that of Cystoseira humilis in composition or abundance, but not in any consistent way (Viejo et al. 1999; Engelen et al. 2013). It is used by fishes, crustaceans, and cuttlefish (Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015). NEA-VNoneEconomic ImpactFisheries Sargassum muticum can interfere with shellfishing and shellfish aquaculture, by covering the bottom, fouling shells, and equipment (Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015). NEA-IVNoneEconomic ImpactShipping/Boating Sargassum muticum entangled propellers and hampered navigation in Saint-Malo, Saint-Guénolé, and the Gulf of Morbihan (1982-1986, Belsher and Pommelec1988) B-INoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change Sargassum muticum supports an epiphyte community of 82 species in the Oslofjord, Norway, more than that of two major native structural plants, Fucus serratus and Zostera marina (Bjærke and Fredriksen 2005). NEA-IINoneEconomic ImpactShipping/Boating Dense beds of Sargassum muticum were reported to interfere with the movement of small boats and to clog their intake pipes (Critchley et al. 1986). NEA-IINoneEconomic ImpactIndustry Sargassum muticum was reported to clog the intakes of power plants in England (Critchley et al. 1986). NEA-IINoneEconomic ImpactFisheries Sargassum muticum is reported to foul fishing lines and nets, and has also interfered with oyster culture and harvesting in England and France (Critchley et al. 1986). NEA-IINoneEconomic ImpactAesthetic Large amounts of Sargassum muticum washing up on beaches, were an unpleasant feature on recreational beaches. Dense beds of Sargassum, were reported to interfere with swimming and recreational sailing. Sargassum muticum was also considered a threat to native marine biota and their habitats. A removal program was studied and organized by a coalition of local, regional, and national environmental agencies, in southern England (Critchley et al. 1986). In 1974-1975, a large campaign of hand-picking by volunteers was conducted, with about ~800 collecting trips and 31 metric tons collected. However, hand-collecting overlooked germlings and small plants. Mechanical removal, herbicides, and release of natural herbivores all proved to be ineffective. Specialized cutting machines, trawls, and suction devices were developed and tested, and found to be more effective, but would require continual annual use (Critchley et al. 1986). NEP-IIIAlaskan panhandle to N. of Puget SoundEcological ImpactHabitat Change In the San Juan Islands, Washington, Sargassum muticum supported a total of 107 epifaunal taxa, and on average supported 20 species per plant, compared to 10 species per plant on the native kelp Laminaria saccharina. Epifaunal diversity increased in area invaded by S. muticum (Giver 1999). P292_CDA_P292 (San Juan Islands)Ecological ImpactHabitat Change In the San Juan Islands, Washington, Sargassum muticum supported a total of 107 epifaunal taxa, and on average supported 20 species per plant, compared to 10 species per plant on the native kelp Laminaria saccharina. Epifaunal diversity increased in area invaded by S. muticum (Giver 1999). NEA-IINoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change On the Isle of Cumbrae, Scotland, canopies of Sargassum muticum support a higher abundance, but lower diversity of epifauna than the native Dictyota dichotoma, probably due to a more complex structure (Harries et al. 2007). In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, S. muticum has colonized large areas of bare substrate by 'stone-walking', attached to stones and shells, and moving by water motion. Invertebrate communities were altered under the canopies, and were dominated by smaller, more opportunistic species than the bare substrate (Strong et al. 2011). Sargassum muticum in this estuary was more heavily colonized by epiphytes and herbivorous amphipods than the natives, and appeared not to benefit from 'invader release' (Strong et al. 2009). In the Limfjorden, Denmark, S. muticum supports a similar epifaunal community in species composition to the native Halidrys siliqua, but supports a much higher density of fauna, especially amphipods, because of the greater size and complexity of S. muticum's thallus (Wernberg et al. 2005). B-IINoneEconomic ImpactIndustry Sargassum muticum clogged intakes of the Ringhals nuclear power plant in the province of Halland (Josefsson and Jansson 2009). B-IINoneEconomic ImpactFisheries In Sweden, catches of eel (Anguilla anguilla) may have been negatively influenced in some areas (Koster archipelago) through interference with fishing gear (Karlsson et al. 1995). NEA-IINoneEcological ImpactFood/Prey Sargassum muticum had faster rates of growth and decomposition than the native brown seaweed Halidrys siliquosa in the Limfjord, Denmark, resulting in higher productivity, and faster turnover of organic matter. Sargassum muticum was preferred to H. siliquosa by the major grazer, urchin Psammechinus miliaris, but grazing losses of S. muticum were small, compared to those due to decomposition (Pedersen et al. 2005; Pedersen et al. 2016). In feeding experiments in Germany, using the snail Littorina littorea, the urchin Psammechinus miliaris, and the isopod Idotea baltica, the native Fucus vesiculosus was preferred to S. muticum from Germany, but S. muticum and S. horneri, collected in Japan, were both more strongly avoided, suggesting that European populations have reduced chemical defenses (Schwartz et al. 2016). Flat Periwinkles (Littorina obtusata and L. fabalis) from English Channel sites first colonized 6-40 years ago (1970s), fed as readily on S. muticum as on native Ascophyllum nodusum, in comparison to snails from later invaded areas. This difference is suggestive of behavioral or evulutionary adaptation (Kurr and Davies 2018). In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, S. muticum was more densely inhabited by the amphipod Dexamine spinosa than native algae (Saccharina latissima, H. siliquosa, Fucus serratus) and more heavily grazed by the amphipod (Strong et al. 2009). In the Wadden Sea, Germany, increased abundance of the native Snake Pipefish (Entelurus aequoreus) was promoted by dense growths of S. muticum, which also supported high densities of harpacticoid copepods, food for the pipefish (Polte and Buschbaum 2008). P058_CDA_P058 (San Pedro Channel Islands)Ecological ImpactCompetition Sargassum muticum colonized Giant Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) beds on Bird Rock, off Catalina Island, after a die-off, possibly caused by high water temperatures during El Nino.

Several years later, Giant Kelp did recolonize Bird Rock (Foster & Schiel 1992, cited by Engelen et al. 2015). B-INoneEcological ImpactCompetition In single-species experiments with Sargassum muticum and 5 native seaweed species, S. muticum grew fastest at the high temperature, 17ºC compared to the natives, but had much slower growth at 7°C. Growth of S. muticum did not differ greatly between high and low nutrient levels (Steen and Rueness 2004). P040Newport BayEcological ImpactCompetition Removal experiments in tidepools at Little Corona del Mar in Newport Beach in southern California, showed little effect level, pool temperature, seaweed biomass and community composition, or faunal composition. Recovery of S. muticum populations was rapid (Smith 2016).

This could represent behavoral or evoultionary adaptation (Kurr and Davies 2018). P090San Francisco BayEcological ImpactHabitat Change In field cage experiments, juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawystcha) were reared in several habitats, bare sand, Eelgrass (Zostera marina, Sargassum muticum and mixed Eelgrass-Sargassum. Growth was best in the mixed habitat, suggesting that habitat variety is important (Hughes et al. 2020).

WAWashingtonEcological ImpactCompetition The invasion of Sargassum muticum resulted in displacement of native algae, in the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound. A removal experiment resulted in recovery of native kelps (Britton-Simmons 2004).
