        "text": "Opt for a Room with a View\n\nSeveral guests mentioned that the views from the rooms were spectacular. Opting for a room with a balcony facing the harbor or lighthouse comes highly recommended.\n\nConsider Low Season Visits\n\nIf you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting in November, which is the low season. This could result in fewer crowds and a more peaceful stay.\n\nTake Advantage of Nearby Attractions\n\nThe hotel's proximity to the Heligoland lighthouse, Bird Observatory, and Harbour makes it convenient for guests to explore these attractions on foot.\n\nCheck Room Amenities\n\nSome guests found the rooms to be small, so it's advisable to check the room size and amenities before booking, especially if space is a priority for you.\n\nBe Mindful of Noise\n\nWhile some guests appreciated the quiet side street, others mentioned that the curtains in the bathroom did not fully close, leading to potential privacy and light issues. It's worth considering this when selecting a room.\n\nInquire About Breakfast\n\nA few guests mentioned that the breakfast could use some improvement, so if breakfast is an important part of your stay, it might be worth inquiring about the options available.\n\nPet-Friendly Accommodation\n\nThe hotel allows pets on request, but charges may apply. If you're traveling with a pet, it's advisable to check the pet policy and associated charges beforehand.\n\nContactless Check-in/Check-out\n\nThe hotel offers contactless check-in/check-out, which can provide a convenient and efficient experience for guests, especially those prioritizing safety measures.\n\nConsider High Season Visits\n\nIf you prefer a livelier atmosphere and more activities, consider visiting in April, which is the high season. This could offer a bustling and vibrant experience with more to see and do."
