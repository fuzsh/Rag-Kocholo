The islands, approximately population 1,650, are located in the Helgoland Bight, part of the German Bight, in the south-eastern corner of the North Sea. Heligoland is the only German offshore island 70 km away from the mainland, approximately two hours' sailing time from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe, three hours from Hamburg with a high-speed catamaran ferry.\n\t\n\tHeligoland is particularly well known among bird lovers, the enormous background noise of the birds is impressive from spring to late summer.\n\tIn addition, due to its isolated location, the island is very convenient as a resting place for many migratory birds and becomes a real hotspot for biodiversity in spring & autumn. Ocean birds can also be observed regularly. In recent years black-browed albatross, which is actually native to the southern hemisphere, has even visited the island. Migratory birds uses Helgoland as resting place in fall & spring.\n\t\n\tOn Germany's only bird rock, the Heligoland \"Lummenfelsen\", the nesting, behaviour & breeding space of a sea bird colony with around 10,000 pairs of birds can be observed every year from March to September. Five bird species breed exclusively on Heligoland.\n\tIn addition to the guillemot that gives the rock its name, these are gannets, fulmar, kittiwakes & razorbills.\n\tThe northern gannet is the most conspicuous of the species mentioned. With its cream-colored head, black wing tips and otherwise white plumage, it is unmistakable. It first settled on Heligoland as a breeding bird in 1991, now over 1000 pairs are breeding in Lummenfelsen & on the Lange Anna, from March to September, the last young birds leave the cliffs in early to mid-October\n\t\n\tThe largest colonies forming; \n\t‚àö - Trottellummen, common guillemot have fast direct flight but are not very agile. They are more manoeuvrable underwater, typically diving to depths of 30‚Äì60 mtr depths of up to 180 mtr have been recorded. \n\t\n\tThey breed in colonies at high densities & make no nest; their single egg is incubated on a bare rock ledge on a cliff face. Eggs hatch after 30 days incubation. The chick is born downy & can regulate its body temperature after 10 days. Some 20 days after hatching the chick leaves its nesting ledge & heads for the sea, unable to fly, but gliding for some distance with fluttering wings, accompanied by its male parent, chicks are capable of diving as soon as they hit the water. The female stays at the nest site for some 14 days after the chick has left. \n\t\n\t‚àö - Eissturmv√∂gel, northern fulmar or Arctic fulmar is a highly abundant seabird found primarily in subarctic regions of the North Atlantic & North Pacific oceans. Fulmars come in one of two colours, a light one with white head & body, grey wings & tail: a dark one which is uniformly grey. \n\t\n\t‚àö - Dreizehenm√∂we\n\tA \"Dreizehenm√∂wen\", literally meaning \"three toes gulls\", the genus name the specific tridactyla is from Ancient Greek tridaktulos, \"three-toed\", from tri-, \"three\" & daktulos, \"toe\".\n\tThe English name is derived from its call, a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake'. \n\tIn North America, this species is known as the black-legged kittiwake to differentiate it from the red-legged kittiwake, but in Europe, where it is the only member of the genus, it is often known just as kittiwake.\n\tThe kittiwakes are the loudest of all, in flight they are particularly easy to recognize by their black wing tips.\n\tThey emerge from the North Atlantic as early as March, until April the colony is finally fully occupied with over 9,000.\n\tThey build their nests of seaweed, algae & grass on small rock ledges, usually they lay only two eggs.\n\tIn July / August the young birds spontaneously rise into the air & at the beginning of September the rock is finally completely cleared again, until the coming year, when everything the spectacular start all over again.\n\t\n\t‚àö - Basst√∂lpel\n\tGannets, the Name Basst√∂lpel originated from the Gannets Colonies on the Bass Rocks on the East Coast of Scotland, Heligoland is the only breeding place in Germany for this Birds.\n\t\n\t‚àö - Tordalk, \n\trazorbill, razor-billed auk, is a colonial seabird in the monotypic genus Alca of the family Alcidae, the auks. & closest living relative of the extinct great auk, even if it looks like the penguins, it is not related to them. even if it looks like the penguins, it is not related to them.\n\tRazorbills are primarily black with a white underside. The male and female are identical in plumage; however, males are generally larger than females. This agile bird, which is capable of both flight & diving, has a predominantly aquatic lifestyle, they only comes to land in order to breed & is monogamous, choosing one partner for life.
