        "text": "Pounding the Rock is a map set over the German archipelago of Heligoland. It is fought between United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThere are no control points in this map. The British spawn in either fighters or bombers from a very high altitude, and must destroy the five targets before their tickets run out.\n\nThe five targets are:\n\nAir control tower by the German airfield in Düne\n\nFactory\n\nMinensuchboot Typ 40\n\nTender Ammerland\n\nTender Donau\n\nThe air control tower, factory, and the Minensuchboot also serve as spawn points for the Germans. The Minensuchboot and the two tenders can be controlled and moved.\n\nThe British aircraft can be found circling at very high altitude over the German islands. As there is no airfield for them to replenish supply, the bombers have unlimited ammunition for their bombs.\n\nIn order to face the bomber threat, the German force has a large number of anti-aircraft guns scattered on the east side of the Heligoland island, as well as a smaller number of fighters in Düne and a Schnellboot in the naval base. The Schnellboots also serve as mobile spawn points, and are the only spawn points not dependent on the objective targets."
