        "text": "These guns were fitted to many battleships and battlecruisers completed just before and after the start of World War I. When compared to contemporary British guns in terms of penetrating power, they were superior to the 12\"/45 (30.5 cm) and 12\"/50 (30.5 cm) guns, and only slightly less powerful than the 13.5\" (34.3 cm) guns. They were, of course, completely outclassed by the 15\"/42 (38.1 cm) guns used on the Queen Elizabeth class.\n\nThe battlecruisers Derfflinger and Lützow used these weapons at the Battle of Jutland (Skagerrak) to sink the British battlecruisers HMS Queen Mary and HMS Invincible.\n\nThe World War I Coastal Defense Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II located near Knocke in Belgium was equipped with four of these guns.\n\nThe mountings for these guns used electric pumps to drive hydraulic elevation gear while the training was all electric. These guns also had hydraulically worked rammers and breeches, the first fitted to German large-caliber guns. These changes increased the rate of fire, with most ships having a ROF of 20 seconds while the Kaiser class were reported to have had an overall ammunition supply speed of three rounds in 48 seconds, including all transfers.\n\nIn World War II these guns were used only as coastal artillery. They were then supplied with a more streamlined shell and used a larger propellant charge, giving them increased range. The best known battery was the six-gun Friedrich August at Wangerooge. Later, three of these guns on BSG mountings were moved to near Wimille on the Channel Coast.\n\nConstructed from shrunk on tubes and hoops and used the Krupp horizontal sliding wedge breech block.\n\nActual bore diameter was 30.50 cm (12.008\").\n\nGun Characteristics\n\nDesignation 30.5 cm/50 (12\") SK L/50 Ship Class Used On Helgoland, Kaiser, König and Derfflinger Classes Date Of Design 1908 Date In Service 1911 Gun Weight 114,309 lbs.

I have chosen to use the weight given in both M.Dv. Nr. 170,54 and in M.Dv. Nr. 234,6 and as stenciled on the projectiles shown in these documents which are all given as 405.0 kg (892.9 lbs.).\n\n^A Note on Sources: Many English language references show the designation for the Psgr. (APC) projectile with a \"(m.Hb)\" suffix (projectile with ballistic cap). However, this suffix is not used in any German documentation for this projectile that I have found.\n\n^A Note on Sources: In \"Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting\" by John Campbell the length of the World War I 30,5 cm Psgr. (APC) is given as 97.4 cm (38.3 inches) or about L/3,1. However, the sketch used to illustrate this projectile is identical to the one in the World War II German document M.Dv. Nr. 170,54 where it is identified as the 30,5 cm Psgr. L/3,4. While no overall projectile length is given in the German documents, scaling it using a dimension that is on the sketch shown below has found that this projectile was about 3.4 calibers in overall length. More recent publications such as \"German Battlecruisers of World War One\" by Staff only note the Psgr. L/3,4 and not a L/3,1. From this analysis, I believe that the World War I and the World War II Psgr. projectiles were most likely the same shell and that Campbell is likely incorrect.\n\n^The HE L/3,8 base fuze projectiles were stated to be capable of penetrating 6 to 20 feet (2 to 6 m) through unarmored structures before detonating.\n\n^The HE L/5,3 projectile was the HE L/3,8 base fuze projectile modified with a ballistic cap.\n\n^A Note on Sources: \"Service Major Caliber Projectiles of the German Navy: Technical Report No. 393-45\" lists a 30.5 cm Psgr. L/4,9 (m.Hb) projectile, a 30.5 cm Spgr. L/5 Bdz. (m.Hb) projectile and a 30.5 cm Spgr. L/4,8 Kz. (m.Hb) projectile, all of 915 lbs. (415 kg), and states that all of these were for the 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns. This is apparently the source used for \"Naval Weapons of World War Two\" which lists projectiles of this weight for both the 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns and for the prototype 30.5 cm SK C/39 gun. However, these projectiles are not listed in two Kriegsmarine documents for the 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns, M.Dv. Nr. 170,54, which was issued in 1940, nor in M.Dv. Nr. 234,6, which was issued in 1941. While it is possible that these projectiles may have been developed sometime after 1941, another alternative is that they may have been developed and used only for the prototype 30.5 cm SK C/39 gun. This alternative seems reasonable, and so I list these projectiles only for that gun.\n\n^German HE Base and Nose Fuzed projectiles with ballistic caps had a rod between the nose of the shell and the fuze to improve performance when striking obliquely. See details on 12.7 cm SK C/34 datapage.\n\n^Burster weights for World War I projectiles from \"Diagrams of Great War\" and \"Naval Weapons of World War One.\"\n\n^The World War I APC burster consisted of two parts, both consisting of FP 1. There was a wooden block in the nose of the burster cavity which acted as a shock absorber.\n\n^12.112.2As noted above, the Coastal HE L/5,3 base fuze projectile was the HE L/3,8 base fuze projectile modified with a long ballistic cap. The burster was the same in both projectiles and consisted of two parts, both of FP 1. There was a wooden block in the nose of the burster cavity which acted as a shock absorber.\n\n^Burster weights (reiner Sprengstoff) for World War II projectiles from M.Dv. Nr. 170,54.\n\n^The APC burster of World War II consisted of two parts, the forward one made with FP 15 and the rear one made with FP 1.\n\n^The HE L/3,8 base fuze burster of World War II consisted of four parts, the forward one made with FP 15 and the following ones made with FP 10, FP 5 and FP 1.\n\n^The Coastal HE L/3,6 base and nose fuze burster of World War II was made entirely with FP 1.\n\n^These guns, like most large caliber German guns of this era, used a \"fore charge\" which was propellant in a double bag silk case and a \"rear charge\" which was propellant in a brass case. The brass case helped to seal the breech of the gun.\n\n^Propellant weights differ in many references and even in official documents such as the M.Dv. Nr. 170 and M.Dv. Nr. 190 series. This seems to be the result of most charges being listed as \"zu etwa\" which means \"to about.\" This was probably because the different propellant formulations used - such as C/32 or C/38 - varied in weight. In addition, different loading weights were used depending upon the powder grain size utilized to make up the charge. The weights in the table above are for the powder grain specified.\n\n^Firing with reduced charges usually did not use a forward charge. Reduced charges were made with RP C/06, apparently to use up existing stocks of the older propellant.\n\n^The silk bag for fore charge weighed 5.3 lbs. (2.4 kg).\n\n^I lack the break down between fore and rear charges for the 1942 propellant charges.\n\n^Using the \"Small Battle Load\" of just the rear charge gave a muzzle velocity of about 2,034 fps (620 mps).\n\n^Outfits were typically 70% APC and 30% HE.\n\n^British post-war documents state that the Kaiser class carried 98 to 103 rounds per gun.\n\n^British post-war documents state that the König class carried 96 to 100 rounds per gun.\n\n^Outfit for Derfflinger class was 65 APC and 25 HE per gun.\n\nDiagrams of some of these projectiles and their fuzes and propellant charges may be found below.\n\nWorld War I\n\nRange of APC L/3,4 1c Elevation Distance 13.5 degrees 17,717 yards (16,200 m) 16.0 degrees 22,310 yards (20,400 m)\n\nRange of HE L/3,8 base fuze for coastal artillery batteries Charge Type Distance Full Charge N/A Reduced Charge 26,530 yards (24,260 m)\n\nRange of HE L/5,3 base fuze for coastal artillery batteries Charge Type Distance Full Charge 41,010 yards (37,500 m) Reduced Charge 31,715 yards (29,000 m)\n\nWorld War II\n\nAPC L/3,4 for coastal artillery batteries Elevation Distance 45.0 degrees 35,000 yards (32,000 m)\n\nRange HE L/3,6 for coastal artillery batteries Elevation Distance 49.1 degrees 56,200 yards (51,400 m)\n\n^See elevation note in the \"Mounting / Turret\" section below.\n\nArmor Penetration\n\nArmor Penetration with APC L/3,4 Range Side Armor Deck Armor 14,000 yards (12,800 m) 10.0\" (254 mm) --- 16,000 yards (15,000 m) 9.0\" (229 mm) ---\n\nData from \"Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting.\"\n\nArmor Penetration with APC L/3,4 Range Side Armor Deck Armor 10,940 yards (10,000 m) 13.6\" (345 mm) --- 13,120 yards (12,000 m) 12.0\" (305 mm) ---\n\nData from \"German Battlecruisers of World War One.\"\n\nMount / Turret Data\n\nDesignation Two-gun Turrets\n\nHelgoland class (6): Drh LC/1908\n\nKaiser class (5) 1d: Drh LC/1909\n\nKönig class (5) 2d: Drh LC/1911\n\nDerfflinger class (4) 3d: Drh LC/1912\n\nHindenburg (4): Drh LC/1913\n\nSingle Coastal Artillery Turrets\n\n30.5 cm L/50 Kst.Drh.L.C/37\n\nWeight Ships: Between 534 to 549 tons (543 to 558 mt) 4d 5d\n\nCoastal Artillery: 271.9 tons (276.26 mt)\n\nElevation All ships as built: -8 / +13.5 degrees\n\nAfter 1915: -5.5 to +16.0 degrees 6d\n\nCoastal artillery: -5 / +50 degrees\n\nElevation Rate Ships: 4 degrees per second\n\nCoastal Artillery: 10 degrees per second with shell loaded\n\nTrain End Turrets: About +150 / -150 degrees\n\nBeam Turrets: About +80 / -80 degrees\n\nCoastal Artillery: -220 / +220 degrees\n\nTrain Rate Ships: 3 degrees per second\n\nCoastal Artillery: 4 degrees per second\n\nGun recoil 36.0 in (91.5 cm) 7d\n\n^The Kaiser class were the first German battleships to have superfiring turrets. This allowed them to have one less turret than previous classes (5 vs. 6) yet still be able to fire the same number of guns on the broadside.\n\n^The König class had all main guns on the centerline, giving them a heavier broadside than earlier ships.\n\n^Derfflinger had a crew of 70 men in C mounting and probably in A and B as well while D mounting had 80 crewmen.\n\n^The mounting weight differences were mainly the result of thicker armor used on the battleships.\n\n^\n\nArmor thickness given in \"Naval Weapons of World War One\" by Norman Friedman Battleships Battlecruisers Face 11.8 in (30 cm) 10.6 in (27 cm) Sides 9.8 (25 cm) 8.7 in (22 cm) Rear 11.4 in (29 cm) except Kaiser class: 10.6 in (27 cm) 10.6 in (27 cm) Roof 3.1 to 4.3 in (8 to 11 cm) except Helgoland class: 2.8 3.9 in (7 to 10 cm) 3.1 to 4.3 in (8 to 11 cm) except Hindenburg: 3.1 to 5.9 in (8 to 15 cm)\n\n^Prinzregent Luitpold was modified just before and the other ships shortly after Jutland (Skagerrak) to increase the maximum elevation from +13.5 to +16.0 degrees. A few sources claim that the maximum elevation was increased on all ships to 16.5 degrees rather than to 16.0 degrees. Norman Friedman in \"Naval Weapons of World War One\" gives conflicting data for maximum elevations and ranges with no explanation. For that reason, I do not believe this source to be a reliable reference in this matter.\n\n^The recoil distance given above is the nominal figure. The absolute, metal-to-metal recoil distance was 38.6 inches (98.0 cm).\n\nRun out was by compressed air. Magazines were below shell rooms on the battleships.\n\nOn the Derfflinger class except for Hindenburg, A, B and C turrets had the magazines below the shell rooms, but D turret had the magazine above the shell room for reasons of space. D turret also did not have the shell hoists broken at the working chamber as did all other 30.5 cm (12\") mountings. Instead, the projectile hoist ran directly from the shell room up to the gunhouse. Hindenburg had all shell rooms below the magazines as in the battleships. Hindenburg also differed from her half-sisters by having LC/1913 mountings with half the number of hoists as the the LC/1912, but these hoists ran faster and were still capable of supplying the equivalent of three complete rounds per gun per minute. The LC/1913 turrets had 7.7 m (25.5 foot) rangefinders on each turret rather than 3 m (10 foot) rangefinders on earlier designs. The Helgoland, Kaiser and König classes had a machinery level directly below the gunhouse with a handling room below it. Lower shell and projectile hoists came up to this room and the ammunition was then transferred over to upper hoists which ran up to the gunhouse. Battlecruisers were similar except for Hindenburg in which the projectile hoists ran directly up to the gunhouse although the propellant hoists were still two-stage.\n\nTraining of the gun turrets was electric and gun elevation was hydraulic. Hydraulic power was provided by two electrically-driven triple pumps. Rammers were hydraulically powered with fluid being supplied directly from the elevation pump. Wedge breech mechanisms were hydraulically powered but could be manually operated.\n\nPropellant smoke was removed with two independent suction systems, each with its own motor. Should one motor fail, the other motor could be coupled to run both systems at a reduced rate.\n\nFor at least the Drh LC/1912 turrets, the guns were separated by a 25 mm (1.0\") splinter bulkhead. Following the Dogger Bank action, German mountings were modified to improve flash precautions. Double flap doors were installed at the beginning and end of the cartridge hoist and ready ammunition was removed from the gun houses.\n\nThe gun axes were 106.3 in (270 cm) apart.\n\nAdditional Pictures\n\nSpecial thanks to Peter Lienau for all of the following photographs and illustrations.\n\n\"The Battle of Jutland\" by Geoffrey Bennett\n\n\"Warship Special 1: Battle Cruisers,\" \"Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting\" and \"Naval Weapons of World War Two\" all by John Campbell\n\n\"Battleship Design and Development 1905-1945\" and \"Naval Weapons of World War One\" both by Norman Friedman\n\n\"Große Kreuzer der Kaiserlichen Marine 1906 - 1918\" by Axel Grießmer\n\n\"German Warships 1815-1945\" by Erich Gröner\n\n\"The Big Gun: Battleship Main Armament 1860-1945\" by Peter Hodges\n\n\"German Artillery of World War Two\" by Ian Hogg\n\n\"The German Defenses on the Coast of Belgium\" by Lt.
