        "text": "The British Isles separated from the European continent approximately 8,000 years ago. For this Brexit there was no referendum or bus, no Leavers or Remainers, nor was it hard or soft. This was a watery Brexit as rising sea levels filled the Channel and created the North Sea. Maritime archaeology is revealing this submerged landscape that once connected the continent to Britain.\n\nEarth is a dynamic planet that is constantly changing. Going back far enough in time, Britain has been separated from the continent several times as sea levels changed. However, for the study of Homo sapiens it is the change at end of the Pleistocene and the start of the Holocene epoch 11,700 years ago that is most interesting.\n\nThroughout the Pleistocene, sea levels rose and fell in response to climate fluctuations. During cold periods, often known as Ice Ages, glaciers contained a great deal of water, lowering global sea levels. You might not have recognised Europe during these periods with its far larger surface area. It would have been possible to walk from Copenhagen to London on dry land. The North Sea and the English Channel contained a fertile landscape with several large European rivers where the humans lived and hunted. In fact, humans were not the only hominins to reach what became the Isles, but also Homo antecessor, Homo heidelbergensis, and the Neanderthals. At Happisburgh in Norfolk, Homo antecessor footprints dating to 800,000 years ago were found exposed on a beach after a storm.\n\nAfter the last Ice Age, the Earth began to warm approximately 18,000 years ago and sea levels rose over a hundred meters as the melting glaciers released water into the oceans. This global effect is called eustatic sea level change and the process more or less ended 5,000 years ago. While there is some sea level change due to isostatic movement, tectonic activity, and compression of sediments, it is beginning in this period that the Earth broadly looks as it does today.\n\nMaritime archaeology has sought evidence of these drowned “paleolandscapes” around the world. Perhaps the most incredible example in Europe is Cosquer Cave near Marseille, France. Divers found the cave entrance at 37 meters, but as they explored the passages they discovered an air pocket at sea level. Preserved on the walls were paintings from 27,000-19,000 years ago from the time when the entire cave system was above the Pleistocene sea level and ancient people used the cave for religious rituals.\n\nArchaeologists are now looking toward the English Channel and North Sea for evidence of drowned landscapes. “Many people may not realise that much of the North Sea was once dry land,” says Dr Rachel Bynoe. “These now-drowned landscapes contain important information about the lives of our ancestors from the Palaeolithic all the way through until the Neolithic period.” Finding sites in the North Sea is like finding a needle in a haystack, but Bynoe and her colleagues use a novel approach combining old and new methods. The seafloor is being mapped using the latest ocean survey equipment to find ancient riverbeds and other landscape features. Since the 19th century fishermen have found bones of Pleistocene animals such as mammoths in their nets. As she recently published in Antiquity, Bynoe combines the data from the fishing fleets with the seafloor maps to try to identify intact Pleistocene layers on the seafloor.\n\nOne site that is changing our understanding of the past is Bouldnor Cliff off the Isle of Wight. Discovered in 1999 when a lobster was seen pushing stone tools out of its burrow, the Maritime Archaeology Trust has conducted annual excavations on the site that dates to 8,000 years ago. At a depth of 11 metres below sea level, the archaeologists have found tools, wooden artefacts, and even the oldest piece of string. The biggest discovery was made in 2015 and published in Science. DNA from the sediments on site contained wheat DNA, suggesting that wheat products were imported to Britain before wheat was cultivated in the country approximately 2,000 years later. The research is helping to understand the transition from Mesolithic hunter-gathers to the farmers of the Neolithic.\n\nIt is the area known as Doggerland which perhaps hold the greatest potential. This submerged region of 17,000 km2 around Dogger Bank is located in the middle of the North Sea and it once connected Britain to Scandinavia. Professor Vince Gaffney and a team from the University of Bradford have undertaken an ambitious project to explore the area using the latest technology. “Although archaeologists have known for a long time that ancient climatic change and sea level rise must mean that Doggerland holds unique and important information about early human life in Europe, until now we have lacked the tools to investigate this area properly,” he said in a statement. The multi-year project was awarded €2.5 million to conduct seafloor mapping and modelling to predict where sites may be located, as well as analyse DNA from sediments, similar to Bouldnor Cliff.\n\nSeveral sites hints at what might lie hidden in Doggerland. “Seahenge” and a second wooden henge have been found on the Norfolk foreshore facing the submerged landscape of Doggerland. Constructed of wood and dating to over 4,000 years ago, the sites tell of past cultures confronted with a changing world.\n\nThe first Brexit separated the British Isles from the continent and set the nations of the islands on a separate trajectory from their European counterparts. Now archaeology is uncovering the land that allowed the earliest inhabitants to reach what would one day become Britain."
