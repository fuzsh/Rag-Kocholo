        "text": "Heligoland (German: Helgoland; Heligolandic Frisian de√§t Lun [\"the Land\"]) is a small German archipelago in the North Sea.\n\nFormerly a Danish and then a British possession, the islands are located in the Heligoland Bight (part of the German Bight) in the southeastern corner of the North Sea. These islands are the only German islands not in the immediate vicinity of the mainland and are approximately three hours' sailing time from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe. In addition to German, the local population, who are ethnic Frisians, speak the Heligolandic dialect of the North Frisian language called Halunder. Heligoland was formerly called Heyligeland, or \"holy land\", possibly due to the island's long association with the god Forseti.\n\nThe German Bight and the area around the island is known to have been inhabited since prehistoric times. Flint tools have been recovered from the bottom of the sea surrounding Heligoland. On the Oberland, prehistoric burial mounds were visible until the late 19th century and excavations showed skeletons and artefacts. Moreover, prehistoric copper plates have been found under water near the island; those plates were almost certainly made on the Oberland.\n\nCards and covers\n\nMeter cancels"
