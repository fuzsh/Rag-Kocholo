According to information from YouTube, these serve, among other things, to collect video statistics, improve user-friendliness and prevent abusive practices.\n\nIndependent of a playback of the embedded videos, a connection to the Google network \"DoubleClick\" is established each time this website is accessed, which can trigger further data processing procedures without our influence.\n\nFurther information on data protection at YouTube can be found in the provider's data protection declaration at: www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/\n\nWe use the online advertising program \"Google Ads\" from Google LLC on our website.
