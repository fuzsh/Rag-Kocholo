        "text": "Research of the stones selected for megalith construction in the Funnelbeaker period in the northern Netherlands indicates a preference for pink granites above the more abundantly present white ones. Similarly, the pink granites are also preferentially chosen for the manufacture of grinding stones and for tempering pottery. The red Heligoland flint likewise seems to be a favourite stone, imbued with special signifi cance as evidenced by the presence of one axe prefab in a hoard, as well as being used in domestic activities. It is argued that during the Funnelbeaker period there seems to have been a focus on the colour red. Key words: Northern Netherlands, Neolithic, Funnel Beaker Culture, Colour, Stone, Megalith, Red Heligoland flint, Microwear.\n\nThe stone cist was a chance find resulting from the excavation of the dwelling mound (wierde) of Heveskesklooster. Owing to its location beneath this younger site and a layer of natural sediment, also the Neolithic surface surrounding the stone cist was excavated. This provided a rare opportunity to study the use of space surrounding the monument. The stone cist was probably built between 3200 and 2950 cal. BC. The flint assemblage testifies to the activities that took place in the area surrounding the stone cist. Although the particular date of these activities is difficult to correlate to the stone cist, it seems that these took place during both TRB and later Neolithic periods. The flint assemblage cannot easily be fit into a bipartite division between ritual and everyday activities. Compared to other TRB stone cists, the Heveskesklooster stone cist yielded few chamber finds. This is the first indication that later inhabitants of the site may have disturbed the content of the burial. Another can be found in the absence of some of the orthostats. Both arguments suggest that in their behaviour the Late Neolithic habitants at Heveskesklooster did not revere the stone cist burial as an ancestral place, but instead seem to have desecrated it. It is concluded that local Corded Ware communities may have had widely differing notions about the relevance of TRB monuments to their sense of ancestry and identity.\n\n(By H.K. Kamstra, J.H.M.

The corings made clear that the archaeological site spans over 1.5 ha and is located on the waterfront of a submerged Pleistocene ridge. The test excavation yielded ceramics, flints and other stone amterial, and archaeozoological remains On the basis of its cultural remains it is concluded that Wetsingermaar constitutes an early site of the Funnel Beaker Culture (Trichterbecherkultur, TRB), predating the Horizon 1 of Drouwen TRB as defined by Brindley (1988b). This early phase is termed pre-Drouwen TRB (cf. Bakker, 1979: 115). The flint industry is similar to younger TRB assemblages, while the ceramic and archaeozoological evidence is difficult to interpret as a result of the fragmentary condition of the finds and the near absence of contemporaneous sites.\n\nA summary of the most important conclusions: ● In most parts of the Ice Marginal Landscapes (IMLs) in Europe, the Weichselian ice advance overprinted and eroded Saalian features almost completely.The megaflute of the Hondsrug is a Late Saalian feature and not deformed by the last glaciation. This makes the Hondsrug a unique (Saalian) glacial feature. 112 ● With respect to the forming processes the Hondsrug is formed by an ice stream triggered by pushing in the onset zone and the breach of Lake Weser in the northern part of the Münster Embayment (Winsemann et al. (2010) acted as a pulling force. These kinds of pull-induced ice streams have also been described by Stokes and Clark (2005) in relation to the Dubawnt Lake ice stream in Northern Keewatin, Canada. We suggest a new name for such ice streams that occur due to these phenomena: push-pull ice streams. ● The Hondsrug- Hümmling ice stream and the Dubawnt ice stream are so far we know the only in the world known two inland terrestrial ice streams induced by calving of the terminal zone in a lake(e.g. Clark and Stokes, 2005). ● The unique Saalian glacial feature of Hondsrug is a as well as the described forming processes of interest for fundamental further scientific research to understand impact of glaciations on landscape forming processes, inclusive impact of loading (and postglacial unloading) on stability of deep and shallow geological structures like salt diapirs and the earth crust. ● Further research with focus on geo-hydrological and geo-physical modelling of the presented newly developed concepts related to the origin of the Hondsrug contributes to better palaeoreconstructions of terrestrial ice streams and glacial features, and to better understanding of geoheritage values. ● Our study generated practice focussed knowledge related to glacial impact on sub- and postglacial groundwater flow and for example to stability of salt diapirs in the IML of northwestern Europe which are used or will probably be used for storage of nucleair waste disposal with half-life time longer then the reiteration time of a new glaciation.\n\nNortheastern Germany was repeatedly covered by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the last glaciation and a succession of distinct ice marginal belts is present in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. We used surface exposure dating to develop a time frame for the retreat of the ice margin. Two samples from the Saalian ice marginal belt give Weichselian ages, a problem that has also been encountered further south when attempting to date the same ice marginal belt (the Hoher Fläming) in Brandenburg. One sample from the Frankfurt moraine is too young to be associated with this glacial feature. Another single sample from the Velgast extent gives also an exposure age that is too young to be associated with this glacial feature. These two examples highlight the necessity to sample multiple boulders on the same feature to obtain a reliable exposure age. Fourteen samples were collected on the Pomeranian moraine and 12 were used to calculate an average deposition time of 15.6 0.6 10 Be kyr. Two samples were removed from the age distribution based on statistical grounds. This result is in good agreement with results obtained in Brandenburg where the Pomeranian moraine was dated at 16.4 0.7 10 Be kyr. Five samples from the Mecklenburgian moraine give an average age of 13.7 0.6 10 Be kyr in good chronological order with the Pomeranian moraine age. One sample (MVP-21) from the Mecklenburgian moraine was corrected for burial effect based on historical documents demonstrating that if known, the recent past history of exposure of a surface can be appropriately used to calculate an exposure age. Together, this new data set highlights: 1. the difﬁculty to date surfaces older than the Weichselian glaciation when using only one cosmogenic radionuclide, 2. the consistency of the results obtained for the Pomeranian moraine across northeastern Germany using cosmogenic Be-10."
