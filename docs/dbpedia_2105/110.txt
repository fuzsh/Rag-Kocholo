The Pinneberg is the 61.3 m above sea level. NHN highest elevation of the North Sea island of Helgoland and the Schleswig-Holstein district of Pinneberg.

The summit is an elevation of a crater rim protruding a few meters above the level of the Oberland, which was created in 1947 when bunkers were blown up. It can be reached via a short beaten path from the cliff edge path. About 400 m further north-west is the Lange Anna rock needle at the north-west end of the island.

The elevation remained nameless for a long time and was only marked by a survey point. The name Pinneberg has been used since 1998. This year a summit cross was erected there by mountain hikers from Itzehoe, which with this name alludes in its humor to the fact that Heligoland belongs to the district of the same name.
