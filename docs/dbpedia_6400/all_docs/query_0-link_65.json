        "text": "Due to warming temperatures, disease-carrying species of mosquito are spreading across Europe from Southeast Asia and Africa. It’s the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) that’s making the most headway, bringing with it dengue fever and more. From where they’re found to how to prevent bites, here’s the latest.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nThe tiger mosquito is normally found in Southeast Asia, where moisture and heat create the perfect breeding grounds. But they’re now spreading across Europe thanks to climate change. Black with white stripes, the mosquito bites during the day — unlike other types of mosquito, which typically do so around dawn and dusk — and is most often found in urban areas and near water sources. They don’t just leave an itchy bump, either — these mosquitos have the potential to spread diseases such as dengue fever, eastern equine encephalitis, chikungunya and zika.\n\nWhere is the tiger mosquito found in Europe?\n\nThe first sighting of tiger mosquitos in Europe was in Albania in 1979, where they remained for over a decade. Now, they’re found in more than a dozen European countries, including Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Croatia and Portugal, and are expected to become a problem on UK soil within the next 15 years — they’ve already been detected here in small numbers. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC), it’s the most invasive mosquito species in the world.\n\nBut it’s not the only mosquito to watch. Another report from the ECDPC suggests the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti), capable of spreading dengue fever and more, has been found in Cyprus, while the common house mosquito (Culex pipiens), known to spread West Nile virus, is found in every European country bar Iceland and the Faroe Islands. According to the ECDPC, there were 130 dengue cases across Europe in 2023, compared to just over 70 for the 10-year period before.\n\nWhy’s this happening?\n\nThe main driver is climate change, with both heatwaves and heavy downpours providing hospitable environments for mosquitos. A contingency report on invasive mosquitos, commissioned in 2020 by Public Health England, wrote: ‘The unprecedented change in status of vector-borne diseases in Europe in recent decades is mainly due to a change in vector distribution underpinned by […] changes in climate and the environment.’ Mosquitos rely on external heat to raise their body temperature, making warmer climes across the continent as appealing as their home turf. And, in the recent European State of the Climate report, Europe was found to be the fastest-warming continent.\n\nWhat symptoms should you look out for if bitten?\n\nA fever, rash and joint pain are common, but not exhaustive, symptoms of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and zika. Dengue, a disviral infection normally found in subtropical regions, can take weeks to develop, with severe cases causing sufferers to vomit and experience headaches, eye pain and muscle aches. Zika tends not to have symptoms, but is dangerous to pregnant women, as an infection can impact the baby. Chikungunya causes headaches and muscle pain, while yellow fever can result in organ failure in extreme cases. Dr Dipti Patel, director at the National Travel Health Network and Centre, says: “If you develop a fever of 38C or more or other symptoms, seek prompt medical advice. Symptoms may occur up to a year after travel.”\n\nHow can you prevent bites?\n\nAccording to Rachel Lowe, a research professor at the Global Health Resilience Group, “personal protective measures […] are essential for those visiting areas in Europe.” Loose clothing treated with repellent offers some of the best protection from bites. A DEET-based repellent with a concentration of 50% or more applied topically can also help keep mosquitos at bay; similarly, there’s growing evidence that picaridin can be just as effective. Ensuring you’re fully vaccinated is also important: check the Travel Health Pro website to see what’s recommended.\n\nWhile numbers of the tiger mosquito are still low, and the species is not yet fully established in the UK, according to Adam Hart, professor of science communication from the University of Gloucestershire, “the spread [...] is certainly a situation to watch.”"
