        "text": "ANTH 10100. Introduction to Anthropology. 100 Units.\n\nClassically defined as the 'science of humankind' or the 'study of human diversity', anthropology examines how people organize themselves into groups and relate to the environment through their cultural beliefs and practices. Students will be introduced to the types of arguments, questions, and problems that have driven anthropological thinking, and to the discipline's unique focus on intensive fieldwork methodologies that span ethnography, archaeology, linguistics, and even biology. We will examine how anthropologists have historically studied topics like belief, kinship, ritual, politics, exchange, and material culture in the non-western world in order to unsettle western norms and assumptions. And we will explore how post-colonial critiques and indigenous perspectives have redefined the discipline in the twenty-first century. Students will learn how anthropologists are today contributing to solving complex global problems, from climate change to economic inequality, racism, violence, immigration, health disparities, political technologies, and the effects of social media. This course serves as a sampler for those curious about the field and it fulfills a basic requirement for those pursing the Anthropology major or minor. Offered at least once yearly by rotating faculty who will provide their unique take on the discipline.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff\n\nPrerequisite(s): Designed as a first course in Anthropology\n\nANTH 10107. Nature and Technology in the Capitalist Mode of Production. 100 Units.\n\nThe crisis of nature and technology is at the heart of the 21st century mode of production as unprecedented planetary scale ecological destruction, climate change, and exhaustion of fossil fuels undercut the dynamics of capitalist accumulation. At the same time, novel techno-natural fixes are being designed to contain the crises immanent to the life process of capital. However, these movements are far from seamless; new tensions, contradictions, and horizons of struggles emerge making a critical inquiry of these concepts urgent to Anthropological thinking. In this course, the students will be introduced to foundational approaches to these problems. The first half of the course will intensively engage with dialectical materialist frameworks to understand the interrelationship between nature, technology, and consciousness in the capitalist mode of production. From this engagement, we will derive critical concepts that will be used to engage with the pertinent questions of planetary scale appropriation of human, non-human and more-than-human life in emergent anthropological theory and ethnographic literature. In doing so, our goal is to reflect on a series of questions: What is the place of nature and technology in the capitalist mode of production? How and if they embody limits to the workings of capital? How does anthropology allow us to develop new political and theoretical horizons that emerge in the wake of these developments?\n\nInstructor(s): Ashima Mittal\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIPS 20107, CEGU 20107\n\nANTH 12800. Formations of Indigeneity. 100 Units.\n\nWhose land are we on? What does it mean to be Indigenous, for generations past and in the twenty-first century? From debates over claims of Indigenous ancestry by political actors to the struggles of sacred lands protection against natural resource extraction, understanding the stakes of these concerns for Indigenous peoples and nations is more relevant than ever. This seminar-part of the sequence for majors in the Department of Race, Diaspora, and Indigeneity-introduces students to core texts and concepts in the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS). Topics will include sovereignty and governance, settler colonialism, citizenship and nationhood, blood quantum and racialization, diasporas and urban indigeneity, and relationships to land and environment. Course activities may include engagement with Indigenous films, dialogues with visiting Indigenous scholars, and field trips to Chicago-area cultural institutions.\n\nInstructor(s): Teresa Montoya and Matthew Kruer Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 17800, RDIN 12300, CRES 12800, CHST 12300\n\nANTH 20006. Embodiment and the Senses. 100 Units.\n\nThis course approaches bodies as points of insight into governance, the varied experiences of being governed, and efforts to evade and reconfigure institutional expressions of authority. First, we will examine bodies as targets of governance, objects to be reformed, regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and \"cared\" for. Next, we will consider how bodies accrue power as sites of resistance, refusal, and critique. Certain bodies in certain places elicit discomfort, unsettling familiar divisions such as of private and public space, of developed and backward, of religious and secular, of reason and madness, of citizenship and (often racialized) non-citizenship. Finally, we will ask how bodies and sensory practices figure in ethical projects of crafting exemplary kinds of subjectivity or collectivity. In this way, the course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to embodiment as well as related questions of bio-politics, gender and race, political subjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, sensory politics and the aesthetic. Along the way, students will gain a new appreciation of the political potency of bodies and bodily practices near and far-from Lenin's preserved body to Trump's \"small\" hands, reproductive labor to sex work, dirty protest to women's marches, indigenous eco-rituals to queer intimacies.\n\nInstructor(s): Mareike Winchell\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 26006, GNSE 24006\n\nANTH 20012. Archaeology of Gender and Sexuality. 100 Units.\n\nHow have archaeologists approached the study of gendered practices, and can their work contribute to theoretical and methodological discussions of gender across the social sciences and humanities? How can we use material objects and things to examine or explain gendered identities, especially in the deep past? In this course, students will engage with a range of research, from different disciplinary perspectives, to explore how gender is situated in archaeological theory and praxis and its political implications. Through multiple case studies, the course will interrogate how archaeologists study, analyze, and interpret material remains to examine gendered ideologies and material practices and their intersections with other social constructs: class, sex, race, ethnicity. Coverage is cross-cultural and aims to expose students to the diversity and variability of gendered and sexual experiences of different people across time and space. Topics include but are not limited to: embodiment and expression, gender roles, sexuality, parenthood and childhood, masculinity, biopolitics, and feminist theory.\n\nInstructor(s): Alice Yao and Katie Kearns\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 30012, GNSE 30147, GNSE 20147\n\nANTH 20100. The Inca And Aztec States. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an intensive examination of the origins, structure, and meaning of two native states of the ancient Americas: the Inca and the Aztec. Lectures and discussions are framed around an examination of theories of state genesis, function, and transformation, with special reference to the economic, institutional, symbolic, and religious bases of indigenous state development. This course is broadly comparative in perspective and considers the structural significance of institutional features that are either common to or unique expressions of these two Native American states. Finally, we consider the causes and consequences of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and the continuing impact of the European colonial order that was imposed on and to which the Native populations adapted with different degrees of success over the course of the 16th century.\n\nInstructor(s): Alan Kolata\n\nNote(s): This course qualifies as a Discovering Anthropology selection for Anthropology Majors\n\nEquivalent Course(s): LACS 20100, LACS 40305, ANTH 40100\n\nANTH 20122. Mesopotamian Archaeology II: States to Empires. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the archaeology of the states and empires of Mesopotamia during the early 2nd through mid-1st millennia BC. We begin with the Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian territorial states and end with the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian empire and the takeover of the Neo-Babylonian empire by the Persians in the mid 1st millennium BC, which marks the end of \"Mesopotamian\" culture. During these centuries, the region saw many political changes, developing from a network of expansive territorial states to massive hegemonic empires. But political developments also included retraction of states and two large-scale political collapses, in part driven by climate change. These millennia in Mesopotamia are also marked by internationalism in both archaeology and politics; trade, elite communication and conquest all affected the material culture of the sub-regions of the ancient Near East. Additional topics include the archaeological evidence (or lack of it) for ethnic groups known from textual sources, symbolism and hybridization in artworks, organic versus artificial settlements and landscapes, and the archaeological signatures of empire. The geographic focus encompasses northern and southern Mesopotamia (approximately the modern countries of Iraq and Syria); reference will also be made to southeast Anatolia (Türkiye) and the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nInstructor(s): McMahon, Augusta Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): NEAA 20001\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEAA 30122, ANTH 30122, NEAA 20122\n\nANTH 20511. The Archaeology of Egypt I. 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides an overview of the archaeology of Egypt, focusing on data from the Paleolithic Period to the Second Intermediate Period, around 1,600 BCE. It introduces fundamental methods and approaches to the archaeological record, surveying significant sites, objects, art, and architecture to understand various aspects of culture, society, and history. While Egypt is well-known for its pyramids, temples and tombs, we will not only examine such constructions, but also explore how material culture can offer us insights on such themes as power and inequality, human-environment relations, urbanism, identity, cross-cultural interactions, collapse, and transformation. We will also consider the origins and legacies of Egyptology while engaging with diverse perspectives on the past, and how Egypt's rich cultural heritage continues to be valued, used, and contested.\n\nInstructor(s): Anna-Latifa Mourad-Cizek Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEAA 20511, NEAA 30511, ANTH 30511\n\nANTH 20537. The Global Black Panther Party. 100 Units.\n\nIn America, the Black Panther Party and its leaders, like Fred Hampton in Chicago, are famous for their revolutionary fight against white supremacy and their violent suppression by US government forces. But what does a Global Studies approach teach us about the Black Panthers? This seminar explores how the Black Panther Party's worldwide networks impacted global understandings of politics, race, and religion. Our readings examine a series of comparative case studies, including the Dalit Panther Party in India, the Mizrahi Black Panther Party in Israel, and the Polynesian Panthers in New Zealand. We analyze primary sources, such as the various Panther Parties' publications, their mainstream press coverage, and their pop cultural representations, like Ta-Nehisi Coates' Black Panther graphic novel and the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. In this course, students learn the global Black Panther Parties' roles in reshaping worldwide conceptions of race, caste, and religion through their encounters with the Nation of Islam, Hindu Nationalism, Zionism, and Indigenous rights. No prior knowledge or coursework is required.\n\nInstructor(s): Andrew Kunze Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 26674, GLST 26674, RDIN 26674\n\nANTH 20700. Global Health, Environment, and Indigenous Futures. 100 Units.\n\nThe global coronavirus pandemic has made evident the significance of ecological (im)balances for the well-being of societies. The relationship between structural inequalities, changing environments and health, especially for historically and socio-economically marginalized communities, is now well established. At the same time, a growing body of literature links the material conditions of marginalized communities-for instance, spaces of dwelling and conditions of labor-to health status, globally. Based on a set of interdisciplinary literature arranged through anthropological theories, this course will critically engage with notions of health and well-being for indigenous communities, tracing injustices that stem histories of racial, caste- and ethnicity-based, and environmental exclusions. The readings are organized around one central question: What does it mean to be indigenous in a changing planet where social, political, and economic systems are marked by enduring legacies of systemic violence? This graduate and undergraduate level course will introduce contexts within which structural exclusions lead to ill-health and loss of well-being among indigenous communities across the globe. The aim is to develop critical thinking on the political economy and political ecologies of indigenous health as imbricated with issues of social, economic, and environmental justice.\n\nInstructor(s): Sanghamitra Das\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SALC 26501, CHDV 30750, CEGU 20700, SALC 32704, CHDV 20700, RDIN 30700, ANTH 30700, CEGU 30700, RDIN 20700\n\nANTH 20701-20702-20703.

This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. African Civilization introduces students to African history and cultures in a three-quarter sequence.\n\nANTH 20701. Introduction to African Civilization I. 100 Units.\n\nPart one considers literary, oral, linguistic, and material sources to investigate African societies and states from the early Iron Age through the emergence of the Atlantic World. Case studies include: the empires of Ghana and Mali, the Swahili Coast, Great Zimbabwe, Nok of Nigeria, and medieval Ethiopia. We also consider religious and spiritual transformation, including Islam in Africa, as well as the origins and effects of European contact, and the emergence of the transatlantic trade in enslaved human beings. Students examine these times and places through primary sources (such as cultural artifacts, visual representations, myths, and memoirs) which illuminate African perspectives on these different places and times. Assignments: oral presentations, document analyses, essays, and team projects.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 10101, SOSC 20101, CRES 20701, MDVL 10101\n\nANTH 20702. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the transformations of African societies in the long nineteenth century. At the beginning of the era, European economic and political presence was mainly coastal, but by the end, nearly the entire continent was colonized. This course examines how and why this process occurred, highlighting the struggles of African societies to manage internal reforms and external political, military, and economic pressures. Students examine these processes through various primary sources (such as visual and material sources, cultural artifacts, and personal accounts) that highlight African perspectives on these processes.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 20802, HIST 10102, SOSC 20202\n\nANTH 20703.

Topics may include the end of colonialism and decolonization, the legacies of slavery and its racial logics, identity and cultural expression, theories of personhood, gender and sexuality, migration, governance, and language. Readings vary widely, including primary sources by African and diasporic authors, social theory, and works of art and literature - written, spoken, and performed.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

Anthropological Theory. 100 Units.\n\nSince its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed the relation between a self-consciously modernizing \"West\" and its various and changing \"others.\" Yet it has not always done so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories - a fact that has led, since at least the 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemological foundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over the course of the discipline's \"long\" twentieth century, from the 1880s to the present. Although it centers on the North American and British traditions, we will review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German social theory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of \"modern\" anthropology as an empirically based, but theoretically informed practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.\n\nInstructor(s): Stephan Palmie\n\nPrerequisite(s): Preference for Anthropology majors\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 30000, RLST 27707\n\nANTH 21201.

Humans have \"made\" the natural world both materially, through millennia of direct action in and on the landscape, and conceptually, through the creation of various ideas about nature, ecosystem, organism, and ecology. In this course we will consider how the conceptual underpinnings of contemporary Western notions of nature, environment, balance, power and race are intertwined. We will trace this trajectory using the lens of the historical development of the field of ecology, then broaden our view to consider worldviews and ontologies about the environment from non-Western cultures. How then do these worldviews influence attitudes and policies towards land, environment, and its stewardship? Taking examples from current environmental topics (e.g. land rights, environmental justice, park access, conservation, extinction) we will evaluate the extent and character of human entanglement with the environment. Throughout the course student voices will be prominent in the many discussion-based class sessions.\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Kindell Terms Offered: Winter.

Explorations in Oral Narrative. 100 Units.\n\nA study of storytelling in non-literate and folk societies, antecedent to the complexities of modern narrativity, itself anchored in and energized by literacy. The main objects of our study will be the vast body of folktales and collateral folklore collected by anthropologists and folklorists in traditional societies. Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters and motifs.. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society …an argument, in short, that humans are, by nature, story-telling creatures whose sapience lies primarily in the capacity to create, be entertained by, and even live by, fictions The central place of storytelling is shown in the humanistic and social sciences: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis. Student story-telling and even performance, of brief stories is encouraged and reflected upon in light of the main arguments of the course.\n\nInstructor(s): James Fernandez\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 45301\n\nANTH 21405. Neoliberalism, Self and Society. 100 Units.\n\nDrawing on ethnography and cultural theory, this course examines the profound impact of neoliberal ideology on the everyday lives of individuals and communities across the globe. We will explore the ways neoliberalism, the idea that the mechanisms of free markets naturally precipitate economic growth and thus societal progress, shapes institutions, social norms, and, most importantly, individuals' understandings of themselves and others. Students will analyze the penetration of market logics into spheres of social life far beyond what used to be understood as \"the marketplace,\" such as education, politics and governance, healthcare, and the family. They will reflect on the effects of market logics on lived realities, both in material and ideological terms. As unfettered global markets produce growing inequality and insecurity, neoliberal tenets valorizing competition and productivity tell those who suffer from and witness such negative effects that they are unavoidable; the result of some people working harder and being better than others. This course will question neoliberalism's normative assumptions, drawing on ethnographic accounts of contemporary life in various regions and contexts across the globe. Students will end the course with an understanding of neoliberalism as an ideology and the ability to engage in discussions on neoliberalism that have emerged recently in the qualitative social sciences.\n\nInstructor(s): Gross, Tori Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 31405, MAPS 31405\n\nANTH 21420. Ethnographic Methods. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces students to the theory and practice of ethnographic methods. In the class, we will consider the ways ethnography works as both a mode of inquiry and a form of knowledge production. We will examine the kinds of questions anthropologists ask, as well as the relationship between research questions, methodological approaches, data analysis, and knowledge. We will examine the ways scholars marshal evidence to address their questions, and practically, how they arrive at that evidence. We will study different components of ethnographic fieldwork, such as participant observation, interviewing, photography, object analysis, archival work, digital methods, and qualitative surveys. In so doing, we will engage with the complexities surrounding ethnographic research, including how one negotiates access during fieldwork, the racialized and gendered subjectivities that inhere in fieldwork, the ethics of knowledge production, and the politics of representation. The class entails both critical engagement with scholarship, and practical exercises. The goal is to give students practical, theoretically grounded insights into fieldwork in order to help them understand how to develop and carry out a research project.\n\nInstructor(s): Kathryn Takabvirwa\n\nPrerequisite(s): Priority to Anthro Majors, Priority to Junior/Senior Standing\n\nANTH 21424. Reading and Writing Ethnographically. 100 Units.\n\nEthnographic renderings of spaces, surroundings, place, setting, and location have clearly always functioned as more than narrative set dressing. Critical perspectives on ethnographic research and writing have pointed out the authorization, exotification, and material conditions of mobility that undergird the 'where' in 'being there'. However, contemporary anthropologists are writing space and place in ways that push ethnographic methods and writing past prior problematics and paradigms of comparison, localization, and totalizing description. How does space become an ethnographic doorway into questions of history, power, infrastructure, and affect?\n\nInstructor(s): Kamala Russell\n\nANTH 21426. More than Human Ethnography. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course we explore the fields of more-than-human and 'multispecies' ethnography. We examine theoretical antecedents promoting the inclusion of non-human actors in ethnographic analysis and read examples of such work, including foundational texts on more-than-human engagements, exploitations, and dependencies by Deborah Bird Rose, Kim Tallbear, Eduardo Kohn, and Anna Tsing among others. We consider the role other species, 'actants' and assemblages played in early social science work and contemplate recent studies of \"becoming with\" animals, plants, fungi, bacteria-encountering complex symbioses, examining naturalcultural borders, and querying the role of decolonial thought and queer ecologies in the 'more-than' turn. Multispecies and posthumanist approaches encourage a decentering of traditional method; we couple ethnographic examples with literature by biologists, physicists, and philosophers. The is a discussion-based seminar with significant time devoted to logistical elements of 'more than' work-to querying how such studies are conducted in practice. The final paper takes the form of an exploratory essay based on observations collected during previous weeks.\n\nInstructor(s): Wilhoit, Mary Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 33807, MAPS 31404, GNSE 21404, GNSE 31404\n\nANTH 21740. Ecology and Governance in Israel. 100 Units.\n\nEcological governance has emerged as an aspirational concept in recent years in political science, philosophy, and anthropology in response to concerns over the increasing likelihood of an unprecedented global ecological crisis as a result of human driven climate change. This course will trace the conceptual genealogy of ecological governance in Western and Eastern political theory and environmental history as it explores the political ecologies of Israel and the Middle East. In so doing, the course embarks from the assertion that environmental justice and the struggle for justice overall are inseparable challenges. Of central concern will be to understand how Israel's politics, culture, and history technological development together with its particular environmental conditions provide conceptual and methodological interventions into current and historical articulations of ecological governance.

Mass Media in Semiotic Perspective. 100 Units.\n\nMass media are commonly understood as channels for public information, expression, and debate. Yet, mass media technologies also serve governmental and corporate actors as instruments for shaping public opinion and behavior. In this undergraduate course, we will explore this and related problems from a semiotic perspective, with special attention to the dynamic relations between state, market, culture, and language at work in projects of mass communication. We will study several theories and empirical cases (both historical and contemporary) of mass mediation. Topics will include the role of mass media in nation-state formation and control; the role of mass media in cultural and linguistic assimilation; and group subjectivity and solidarity within media publics.\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Bloechl\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MADD 12079, LING 22079\n\nANTH 22111. Black Death. 100 Units.\n\nKarla FC Holloway proposes the concept of \"black death,\" arguing that \"African Americans' particular vulnerability to an untimely death in the United States intimately affects how black culture both represents itself and is represented.\" Whether attributable to Holloway or not, the term 'Black death' circulates in scholarship, popular media, and political discourses arguably because it apprehends a commonsensical, albeit unfortunate, understanding of the relationship between death and Black people. This seminar-style course surveys death as an object of inquiry, metaphor, political occasion, and inspiration for aesthetic creation. The course is primarily Black Studies in its frameworks and subject matter- reading texts and other materials across disciplines, genres, and media. The course recognizes that the threads of race and death are inherently global and connected to European colonial imperial expansion, racism, capitalism, and modernity. Throughout the course we ask: What is the relationship between Black people or blackness and death? Is \"Black death\" unique? How do we take seriously ubiquitous legacies of violence while also accounting for socio-historical specificity? What are the attendant practices, creations, and modes of thinking and being associated with Black death? At the end of the course, students will have honed skills in close reading, critical thinking, and thoughtful discussion through the study of race and death.\n\nInstructor(s): LaShaya Howie Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): This is an advanced level course; students should have taken at least one course introductory critical race theories course prior to enrolling.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 22111\n\nANTH 22165. Politics of Technoscience in Africa. 100 Units.\n\nEuro-American discourse has often portrayed Africa as either a place without science and technology or as the home of deep and ancient wisdom. European imperialists used the alleged absence of science and technology as a justification for colonialism while pharmaceutical companies sought out African knowledge about healing plants. In addition to their practical applications, science and technology carry significant symbolic weight in discussions about Africa. In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation? How have independent African governments dealt with the imperial legacies of science? From the interpretation of archaeological ruins to the design of new medical technologies, this class will examine science and technology as political practice in Africa.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): KNOW 21410, CRES 21410, HIPS 21410\n\nANTH 22202. Anthropology of Caste. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar course explores anthropological approaches to caste.

Technology and the Human. 100 Units.\n\nTechnology is ubiquitous in contemporary life. Yet technological developments continue to infatuate and inspire in us feelings of excitement, hope and fear. How are we to understand the uncanny relationship between the human and technology? What does this relationship disclose about human agency and creativity? If human life is unimaginable without tools, artifacts, memory supports, and machines, how might we gain the critical distance necessary to properly assess the human-technical relation? In this course we will open up an inquiry into the question of technology by considering the ways in which technical objects, processes, and systems interrupt, challenge, and constitute human subjectivity. Readings will include texts by Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Kittler, Bernard Stiegler, Gilbert Simondon, Katherine Hayles and others.\n\nInstructor(s): Sara-Jo Swiatek Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 27802\n\nANTH 22450. Language, Gender, and Sexuality. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on the relationship, in theory and in practice, between language, gender, and sexuality. We begin with a brief overview of the field and some of its major theoretical developments. Then we expand on themes of desire and identity; binaries and normativities; embodiment; \"interstices\"; and performativity. The practical component of the course includes critical analysis of language used to construct gender and sexuality (e.g. in drag shows, communities you belong to personally, social media, and current events). We also consider binary language reform, abolition of linguistic gender systems, and emergence of identity categories as practices of everyday relationality that contest hegemonic systems. Readings are interdisciplinary and draw from fields including Linguistics, Anthropology, Performance Studies, Literary Studies, and Queer Studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Tulio Bermúdez Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): LING 22450, GNSE 20119\n\nANTH 22531. Visual Anthropology: An Introduction to Ethnography as Film. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar introduces students to Visual Anthropology through a survey of film as an instrument and object of ethnographic practice. Specifically, it explores ethnographic film as a genre for representing \"reality,\" anthropological knowledge and distinct cultural lives. We will examine how ethnographic film and its proto-cinematic precedents (e.g., the panorama, the magic lantern) emerged in particular intellectual and political economic contexts as well as how subsequent conceptual and formal innovations in audiovisual production, including recent digital transformations, have shaped the genre. We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of 1) the contexts for producing and circulating these works, 2) the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation and 3) the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film. Throughout the course, we will situate Visual Anthropology within the larger anthropological project for representing \"culture,\" addressing the status of ethnographic film in relation to other documentary practices including written ethnography, museum exhibitions, photography, documentary film, graphic illustrations (\"manga\" ethnography), and new digital forms of engagement (Web 2.0, interactive gaming, augmented & virtual reality). Besides film screenings and writing exercises, students will have an opportunity to develop and \"pitch\" their own original Visual Anthro project.\n\nInstructor(s): Julie Y.

Violence: Vigilantism, Community Defense, and Armed Resistance. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores extralegal violence primarily in the US, from decolonial struggles to white mobs to self and community defense by marginalized peoples. How do we understand different forms of violence, defense, and resistance in relation to the violence of the state? What role does violence play in struggles for justice and freedom? This seminar surveys a range of social science approaches to these questions. In addition to reading the work of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers, we will also take up these themes as they appear in popular media and current events.\n\nInstructor(s): Maya Singhal Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 22900, RDIN 30900, HIST 27907, RDIN 20900, ANTH 32547\n\nANTH 22625.

Signs and the State. 100 Units.\n\nRelations of communication, as well as coercion, are central though less visible in Weber's famous definition of the state as monopoly of legitimate violence. This course reconsiders the history of the state in connection to the history of signs. Thematic topics (and specific things and sites discussed) include changing semiotic technologies; means; forces and relations of communication (writing, archives, monasteries, books, \"the\" internet); and specific states (in early historic India and China, early colonial/revolutionary Europe, especially France, Britain, and Atlantic colonies, and selected postcolonial \"new nations\").\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Socialisms in Asia. 100 Units.\n\nWestern ideas about \"actually existing\" socialism are dominated by the failures and tyranny of the Soviet bloc. But decolonizing Asia may have a different story to tell. Tracking revolutionary information technology, new statistical and social sciences, and cybernetic techniques for governance entering into Asia in the era of decolonization, partitions and the Bandung Conference, this course reconsiders plural possible socialisms, not based on earlier European histories in which the ends exceeded the means, but on later Asian histories. These are not so much histories of self-determination and worldmaking, as scientific and social, self and world refashioning. This course is intended to be of interest to any student interested in the applying techniques of science and technology studies to the history of social science, interested in the history of applied science outside the west, and/or in Asian decolonization, and/or in the past, present, and future of socialism.\n\nInstructor(s): John D.

Captivity. 100 Units.\n\nThe premise for this course is that anthropology, as well as other domains of social inquiry, have unacknowledged and unredeemed debts to captivity as structure, experience, and event, from the penal colony to the slave plantation. This course is an attempt to begin to think about those debts through readings in anthropology, history, and philosophy.\n\nInstructor(s): Darryl Li\n\nPrerequisite(s): Open only to 3rd and 4th year students in the College, with some preference for majors in Anthropology & LLSO.\n\nNote(s): Advanced undergraduate seminar.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): LLSO 29703\n\nANTH 22733. Marxism, Anarchism, and the Black Radical Tradition. 100 Units.\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to Black Radical Tradition as an insurgent political formation and intellectual practice. While many genealogies of Black Studies depart from the formal institutionalization of Black Studies departments and programs in the latter half of the 20th Century, this course is differently attuned to the dialectic of Black thought and Black insurgency in which the latter-what C.L.R. James describes as a history of Pan-African revolt against the plantation and its afterlives-is always a precondition of the former. As a critical survey of said histories and the ideas derived from them, this course will examine the relationship between knowledge production (theory) and material struggle (praxis) in the Black Radical Tradition alongside adjacent but distinct political traditions such as Marxism and anarchism. Born out of a protracted \"state of emergency,\" the Black Radical Tradition permits us to appraise, critique, and confront the alarms raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and global climate collapse alongside settler colonialism and plantation slavery in the longue duree. To this end, students will consult non-fiction, literature, art, and film from authors and creators such as James, Audre Lorde, Lizzie Borden, W.E.B. Du Bois, Josina Machel, Kimathi Mohammed, and Lorenzo Ervin.\n\nInstructor(s): Ryan Jobson\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 21733\n\nANTH 22750. Theoretical Approaches to Political Anthropology: Sovereignty, Authority, and Refusal. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore understandings of power and its production articulated by ethnographers and political theorists whose work has been influential in anthropology. We will focus on competing claims to sovereignty and authority that reveal the tentative, emergent, and contingent nature of power. Spanning various regions, the course content will elucidate the tensions between nation-states, informal/illegal networks, and the actions and aspirations of individual subjects. Some of the questions we will raise include: What are the roles of performances, narratives, and acts of exclusion and violence in the making of sovereignty and authority? How are competing de facto and de jure forms of power negotiated in various spaces ranging from the institutional to the intimate? The centrality of both physical violence and the complacency born of naturalized political institutions and economic rationality will arise in our examinations of political mobilization and possibility. This course will give students opportunities to develop conceptual understandings of various modes of power that offer insights into the forces of colonialism, global interconnectivity, and politics that shape the 21st century world. As this is a methodology course (fulfilling the MAPSS requirement), students will spend substantial class time reflecting upon the theoretical approaches of contemporary ethnographers and developing their own theoretical approaches to their thesis projects.\n\nInstructor(s): Gross, Victoria\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPS 34513, ANTH 34725\n\nANTH 22755. The Idea of Africa. 100 Units.\n\nThe Idea of Africa, a new interdisciplinary course, offers undergraduates students an opportunity to engage critically with key philosophical and political debates about contemporary Africa on the continent and globally. The course takes its title from V.Y. Mudimbe's 1994 book which builds on his earlier work The Invention of Africa. It asks three questions: (1) How and to what purposes has Africa been conceived as metaphor and concept. (2) How might we locate Africa as a geographic site and conceptual space to think through contemporary debates about citizenship, migration and new structures of political economy? (3) What futures and modes of futurity are articulated from the space and metaphor of Africa? This lecture course co-thought in an interdisciplinary mode will include public guest lectures, field trips, and engagement with visual arts, and film related to the themes of the course. The course will be divided into the following four sections: 1) Inventing Africa; 2) Political Trajectories; 3) Afro-Mobilities; 4) Afro-Futures.\n\nInstructor(s): Natacha Nsabimana & Adom Getachew\n\nNote(s): Cap 50\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 23755, PLSC 22755\n\nANTH 22765. Ethnographic Approaches to Power and Resistance. 100 Units.\n\nThis introductory graduate course will examine understandings of power articulated by influential political theorists and ethnographers. We will explore key theoretical concepts, including discipline, governmentality, sovereignty, hegemony, agency, and resistance, as well as their application within textured, intersubjective, and affectively oriented ethnographic texts. Seeing power grounded in tentative and unstable practices, we will focus on the tensions between nation-states, informal networks, and the actions and aspirations of individual subjects. How are attempts to consolidate power articulated in performances, narrative histories, and acts of exclusion and violence? How are competing de facto and de jure powers negotiated in various spaces ranging from the institutional to the intimate? The centrality of both physical violence and the complacency born of the naturalized hegemony of political institutions and economic rationality will arise in our examinations of political mobilization and possibility. This course will give students opportunities to develop conceptual understandings of various modes of power that offer insights into the forces of colonialism, global interconnectivity, and violence that shape the 21st century world.\n\nInstructor(s): Victoria Gross Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPS 31504, ANTH 34730\n\nANTH 22770. Anthropology of Power, Status, and Performance. 100 Units.\n\nThis introductory graduate course examines the nature of power and status through the theoretical lens of performativity. We will engage with notions of performativity, articulated by influential theorists of linguistics, gender, and religion, that demonstrate the abilities of performances to effect change in the world. Thinking with performativity, we will interrogate practices of negotiating power and status in a broad range of social, political, and geographical contexts. How is the power made and unmade through particular acts? How is status, a particular type of power differentiation, created collectively and individually through acts of saying and doing? Such questions will animate our explorations of power and status in recent ethnographies focused on Asia, the Americas, and Europe.\n\nInstructor(s): Victoria Gross Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 22770, ANTH 34735, MAPS 33508\n\nANTH 22826. The Anthropology of Commodities and Consumption. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is a commodity, and what does it mean to consume one? In this discussion-based, reading- and writing-intensive seminar, we will explore \"consumption\" and the \"commodity\" as objects of anthropological analysis. Drawing from a range of global ethnographic examples, as well as from popular culture, literature, and other academic fields, we will think critically about everyday practices that are so often taken for granted. We will investigate the complex relationships that people make with everyday things and the roles they play in social life; how commodities can produce and reproduce social relationships and materialize claims about identity or status; fashion and its relationships to capitalism, gender, and appropriation; political and ecological aspects of consumption; and more. In doing so, we will attend to and practice some key approaches to doing anthropology, including ethnographic interviewing, observing, media ethnography, writing field notes, and turning them into a text. Students will write three short papers, describing the \"biography\" of an object, analyzing consumption in a popular culture \"text,\" and writing up original ethnographic data. The final project, developed through these exercises, instructor feedback, and peer workshops, will be a creative analysis of a contemporary consumption phenomenon of students' choice.\n\nInstructor(s): Hanna Pickwell\n\nANTH 22830. Indigenous Media and the Politics of Representation. 100 Units.\n\nThis undergraduate seminar explores popular representations of Indigenous nations and issues across various modes of media such as film, photography, digital platforms, and museum installations. With a particular focus on media forms produced by Indigenous artists, filmmakers, and curators we will analyze these narratives through frameworks of self-determination, resistance, visual sovereignty, and relational futures. Throughout the course, we will consider Indigenous media production(s) in relation to the broader social, historical, and cultural contexts in which they circulate in North America and beyond. The material covered in this course will acquaint students with an introduction to the contemporary debates surrounding Indigenous media and representation as they intersect with the larger fields of visual anthropology and Indigenous Studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Teresa Montoya\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 23830, MADD 12830\n\nANTH 22845. Xenophobia and the Politics of Belonging. 100 Units.\n\nWhat work does xenophobia do in the making and marking of nation-states? What does it mean to belong, in a world structured by migration? In this course, we will examine the practices and politics of exclusion, of othering and of unbelonging. Drawing on cases from North America and Sub-Saharan Africa, we will study xenophobia at different points along its spectrum of intensity - from mass atrocities to the seemingly banal ways in which othering and exclusion are baked into everyday life. We will study each case in depth in its own right, as well as how it sits within broader experiences of exclusion and violence around the world and across time. In the course, we will explore theoretical debates surrounding nativism, autochthony, and different forms of nationalism, and the ways they relate to xenophobia. Scholars of migration and belonging have long shown that collective identities are constructed in large part in relation to an external other. Does (one person's) belonging necessitate (another's) unbelonging? In this course we ask: how does the 'stranger' come to be seen as threatening or destabilizing? How does one come to be seen as a 'stranger'?\n\nInstructor(s): Kathryn Takabvirwa\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 22845\n\nANTH 23003. Greater Latin America. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is \"Latin America,\" who are \"Latin Americans\" and what is the relationship among and between places and people of the region we call Latin America, on the one hand, and the greater Latinx diaspora in the US on the other? This course explores the history of Latin America as an idea, and the cultural, social, political and economic connections among peoples on both sides of the southern and eastern borders of the United States. Students will engage multiple disciplinary perspectives in course readings and assignments and will explore Chicago as a crucial node in the geography of Greater Latin America. Some topics we will consider are: the origin of the concept of \"Latin\" America, Inter-Americanism and Pan-Americanism, transnational social movements and intellectual exchanges, migration, and racial and ethnic politics.\n\nInstructor(s): Diana Schwartz Francisco Terms Offered: Course not offered in 24-25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 26321, RDIN 26386, SPAN 26386, LACS 26386, LACS 36386, CRES 26386, RDIN 36386, SPAN 36386\n\nANTH 23077. Indigenous Politics in Latin America. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the history of Indigenous policies and politics in Latin America from the first encounters with European empires through the 21st Century. Course readings and discussions will consider several key historical moments across the region: European encounters/colonization; the rise of liberalism and capitalist expansion in the 19th century; 20th-century integration policies; and pan-Indigenous and transnational social movements in recent decades. Students will engage with primary and secondary texts that offer interpretations and perspectives both within and across imperial and national boundaries.\n\nInstructor(s): Diana Schwartz Francisco Terms Offered: Course not offered in 24-25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIPS 26380, HIST 26318, LACS 36380, CRES 26380, LACS 26380, RDIN 26380, RDIN 36380, GLST 26380\n\nANTH 23094. Development and Environment in Latin America. 100 Units.\n\nDescription: This course will consider the relationship between development and the environment in Latin America and the Caribbean. We will consider the social, political, and economic effects of natural resource extraction, the quest to improve places and peoples, and attendant ecological transformations, from the onset of European colonialism in the fifteenth century, to state- and private-led improvement policies in the twentieth. Some questions we will consider are: How have policies affected the sustainability of land use in the last five centuries? In what ways has the modern impetus for development, beginning in the nineteenth century and reaching its current intensity in the mid-twentieth, shifted ideas and practices of sustainability in both environmental and social terms? And, more broadly, to what extent does the notion of development help us explain the historical relationship between humans and the environment?\n\nInstructor(s): Diana Schwartz Francisco Terms Offered: Course not offered in 24-25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): LACS 26382, LACS 36382, HIPS 26382, ENST 26382, CEGU 26382, HIST 36317, GEOG 26382, GLST 26382, HIST 26317\n\nANTH 23101-23102-23103.

Religion and Psychiatry. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will investigate the many theoretical and practical problems which emerge where the domains of psychiatry and religion overlap. We will explore questions such as: What are the common realities that religious and psychiatric frameworks seek to explain? Are being \"divinely inspired\" and being \"mad\" mutually exclusive? How do religious and other cultural categories shape the development of what are called \"mental disorders\"? Are cognitive behavioural therapists more effective than witchdoctors at restoring people to health? We will begin with a brief overview of the history of psychiatry, before analyzing a famous case of mass demonic possession in 17th century France. We will take several weeks to explore contemporary psychiatric diagnoses, contrasting how psychiatrists and religious authors describe similar symptoms in different ways. We will compare diverse therapeutic methods, modern and traditional, to ask what makes each of them effective or ineffective. Finally, we will survey proposed alternatives to the prevailing diagnostic frameworks within psychiatry, asking which, if any, our study of the overlapping domains of religion and psychiatry might lend support.\n\nInstructor(s): Owen Joyce-Coughlin Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HLTH 23300, CCTS 23300, RLST 23300\n\nANTH 23335. Racial France. 100 Units.\n\nOver the last two decades, questions of race, racial identity, and racial discrimination have come increasingly to the fore in France, despite (or because of) the country's prevailing rhetoric of colorblind indivisibility. These issues are becoming ever more pressing on a background of intensifying racisms and right-wing populisms in Europe. The purpose of this course is to offer analytical perspectives about these critical tensions and their ripples across the landscape of contemporary French politics. Using readings from a wide variety of fields (among others, anthropology, sociology, literature, philosophy, history, political science, and news media), we will unpack the discourses and lived experiences of race that have shaped the politics of national identity and difference in France since the late 18th century. We will see that the question of 'racial France' has been intimately bound up with the country's history of colonialism and decolonization, with its Republican ideology, with matters of law and government, with questions of citizenship, religion and sexuality, with recent debates on multiculturalism, and with white malaise and resentment stirred by the growth of right-wing extremisms. In the course of our examinations, we will also reflect on the specificity of race and racialization in France, and its differences from racecraft in the United States.\n\nInstructor(s): Francois Richard Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): FREN 33335, ANTH 33335, CRES 23335, FREN 23335\n\nANTH 23405.

New Perspectives on Language Emergence. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course we will investigate anthropological and linguistic perspectives on language emergence, as well the social, demographic, environmental, linguistic, and modality (vision, speech, touch) factors that contribute to the formation of new languages. Emerging languages in communities around the world offer unprecedented scientific opportunities to address important questions previously deemed intractable, such as: Where does language come from? How do our experiences of the world influence the way our languages are structured? At what level of abstraction can language be studied as an autonomous object of analysis? The topic of language emergence has tended to focus on the interaction of linguistic, psychological, and demographic factors. We will bring the important anthropological dimension to the topic of language emergence, which addresses the way that users of emerging languages inhabit the world. The readings, lectures, and discussions will address new implications for our understanding of language creation.\n\nInstructor(s): Diane Brentari & Terra Edwards Terms Offered: Autumn.

Power and Responsibility in the Anthropocene. 100 Units.\n\nHumanity's immense impact on Earth's systems has led some scientists to claim that we have entered a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. Humans' influence on Earth's landscape, climate system, and biodiversity inspires many to ask, in turn, What should be done about humankind's planetary powers? Some scholars and religious leaders claim that people should take responsibility and influence Earth's systems for good ends, while others argue that we should radically scale down such power. Still others suggest that the Anthropocene requires us to entirely revise our ideas of power and responsibility and even develop new religious sensibilities. Through discussions and focused writing assignments, students in this class will explore and evaluate these and additional responses to the Anthropocene, paying specific attention to how Anthropocene ethical thought wrestles with the place of religion on a changing planet. The course culminates in an extended examination of how Anthropocene discourse conceals racial antagonisms and contemporary decolonial struggles.\n\nInstructor(s): Colin Weaver Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 23507, GLST 23507, RLST 23507, RDIN 23507\n\nANTH 23510. Ethics of Ethnographic Encounter. 100 Units.\n\nHow can anthropological perspectives help us rethink issues of current global concern? We will be attending to critiques of ethnographic method: calls to decolonize the discipline, demands to make it more collaborative. At that level, we will be exploring anthropology as a distinctive way of engaging the world, and how the ethos of ethnography sits with the difference between scholarship and activism. At the same time, we will be considering what kind of light anthropology can shed on present-day problems such as the politics of indigeneity, scientific authority, environmental crisis, and interspecies relations.\n\nInstructor(s): William Mazzarella Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 23510\n\nANTH 23616. Central Asia Past and Present/From Alexander the Great to Al Qaeda. 100 Units.\n\nCentral Asia Past and Present serves as a multi-disciplinary course, spanning anthropology, history and political science. This course introduces students to the fluid, political-geographic concept of Central Asia as well as to the historical and cultural dimensions of this particular and oft-redefined world. My understanding of Central Asia comes from studies of ex-Soviet Central Asia, which includes five independent countries (since 1991) within central Eurasia--the former U.S.S.R. Thus the course encompasses Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in addition to parts of northern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and western China (Xinjiang/Sinkiang). Students will familiarize themselves with universal and divergent factors among the Central Asian peoples based on phenomena such as human migrations, cross-cultural influences, historical events, and the economic organization of peoples based on local ecology and natural boundaries. Working together and as individuals, we will study maps and atlases to gain a fuller understanding of historical movements and settlements of the Central Asian peoples.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

We will compare Wakefield's \"scientific colonization\" in New Zealand, Gordon's social experiments and indentured labor in Fiji, and the plantations, American annexation, tourism, and the military in Hawai'i. We will compare the colonial experiences of the Maori, Hawaiians, and indigenous Fijians, and also those of the immigrant laborers and their descendants, especially white New Zealanders, the South Asians in Fiji, and the Japanese in Hawai'i. General pro­positions about nationalism, capitalism \"late\" and otherwise, global cultural flows, and postcolonial subject positions will be juxtaposed with contemporary Pacific conflicts.\n\nInstructor(s): John Kelly\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 23710, ANTH 33700, CRES 33700\n\nANTH 23803. Magical Politics. 100 Units.\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's election to the presidency in 2016, witches all over North America collaborated on spells to resist him and his politics by 'binding' his administration. Alt-right activists had already for some time been engaged in 'meme magic' against Trump's liberal critics. How can we begin to understand these magical interventions in present-day politics? Rather than presuming that 'magical politics' is a fringe or crackpot phenomenon, this class draws on activist, esoteric, and academic materials to suggest that our thinking about everyday life and ordinary politics can be fundamentally enlivened and enhanced by taking 'magic' seriously.\n\nInstructor(s): William Mazzarella Terms Offered: TBD\n\nNote(s): This is a 3CT Capstone Course\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 28803, CCCT 23803\n\nANTH 23809. Visualization and Biology: Science, Culture, and Representation. 100 Units.\n\nHow do scientific images get made? This deceptively simple question lies at the heart of this course. Over three weeks at the MBL, we will examine the techniques, technologies, philosophies and histories of scientific image making, with a particular focus on marine biology. Rather than simply reading theories of visualization and representation, students will immerse themselves in the making of images themselves. Students will perform hands-on work with historical and contemporary theories and techniques of microscopy, taxonomy, anatomy, and specimen collecting. They will also examine the theoretical, philosophical, and ethical underpinnings of those practices. Through a combination of ethnographic (participant observation) and historical (archival) work, students will develop rich accounts of scientific visualization - from matters of objectivity and instrumentation, to problems of vision and the limits of (human) senses, to questions of aesthetics, abstraction, and representation. During the course, students will have the opportunity to work with Marine Biological Laboratory faculty, have access to laboratory and archives, and will develop new data and novel accounts of the social, cultural, and technical creation of scientific images.\n\nInstructor(s): Michael Paul Rossi Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Prerequisite: Consent Only.\n\nNote(s): Prerequisite: Consent Only.

Farms as Factories: Industrial Ideals in 'Modern' Agriculture. 100 Units.\n\nPlants and animals are now produced in capital-intensive, factory-like settings. The industrialization of agriculture has not only transformed what we eat, but also the ecology of the globe and biology of its inhabitants. This course explores the logics, history, and consequences of an agricultural sector that simultaneously generates lagoons of pig manure, proprietary DNA, and monocropped landscapes. How does commoditizing wheat alter its value? How do pigs to change when they live their lives on concrete? What forms of care are needed to keep antibiotic-laden chickens alive? How does the industrial production of life rearrange 'modern' concepts of nature? The course situates these questions within a broader framework of capitalism and commoditization; we begin by studying the rationale of proto-industrial production on slave plantations, consider the results of agricultural 'modernization' in the 19th and 20th centuries, and analyze how social scientists have studied these processes. Then, we examine how agricultural products - plants and animals - have been physically altered to facilitate standardized production, and study how these shifts have changed the role of workers and social milieu of agrarian labor. In addition to contextualizing modern agricultural production, this class is an introduction to animal and plant studies, theories of capitalism and commodification, and environmental studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Sandy Hunter Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 23645\n\nANTH 23825.

Magic, Science, and Religion. 100 Units.\n\nThe relationship between the categories of magic, science, and religion has been a problem for modern social science since its inception in the nineteenth century. In the first half of this course, we will critically examine some of the classical and contemporary approaches to these concepts. In the second half, we will explore a number of detailed historical and ethnographic studies about modern phenomena that call some of the fundamental assumptions behind these categories into question.\n\nInstructor(s): Alireza Doostdar\n\nEquivalent Course(s): AASR 30501, HLTH 28900, KNOW 28900, RLST 28900\n\nANTH 23908. Religion and its \"Other\": Secular and Post-Secular Formations. 100 Units.\n\nHow do we locate religion? What is a secular space? Are we somehow beyond secularism? This course provides an introduction to the relationship between religion and the secular as it has been conceived in the modern West. It is intended to provide students with a basic historical and theoretical framework for thinking about how these categories relate, how they have evolved, and the work they do in our contemporary society. Readings will include works by Hermann Cohen, Louis Dupré, Charles Taylor, Michel Foucault, Bruno Latour, Judith Butler, Talal Asad, and Saba Mahmood.\n\nInstructor(s): Lisa Hedrick Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 29015\n\nANTH 23910. Holocaust Object. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we explore various ontological and representational modes of the Holocaust material object world as it was represented during World War II. Then, we interrogate the post-Holocaust artifacts and material remnants, as they are displayed, curated, controlled, and narrated in the memorial sites and museums of former ghettos and extermination and concentration camps. These sites which-once the locations of genocide-are now places of remembrance, the (post)human, and material remnants also serve educational purposes. Therefore, we study the ways in which this material world, ranging from infrastructure to detritus, has been subjected to two, often conflicting, tasks of representation and preservation, which we view through a prism of authenticity. In order to study representation, we critically engage a textual and visual reading of museum narrations and fiction writings; to tackle the demands of preservation, we apply a neo-materialist approach. Of special interest are survivors' testimonies as appended to the artifacts they donated. The course will also equip you with salient critical tools for future creative research in Holocaust studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): JWSC 29500, REES 37019, HIST 33413, REES 27019, ARCH 27019, HIST 23413, ANTH 35035\n\nANTH 23911. Anthropology of Religion. 100 Units.\n\nHow do anthropologists study religion? This course is an introduction to classic concepts that have defined the social scientific study of religion such as ritual, taboo, transcendence, embodiment, and enchantment. To grasp how fieldwork is paired with theory, we will engage ethnographic writings on Orthodox Christianity in northern Ethiopia, Afro-Caribbean Santería in Chicago, and Islamic jinn veneration in Delhi India. We will further examine various themes in the socio-cultural inquiry of contemporary religion including asceticism, sexuality, sectarianism, and political theology.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

Relativism and Religious Difference. 100 Units.\n\nHow do we evaluate people who are different from us? What grounds our evaluation of human behaviors or beliefs? At the end of the 20th century, comparative analyses of religious beliefs and ethics were heavily criticized for their ethnocentric tendencies; researchers were blamed for importing their own values on the \"other\". More recently, however, the pendulum seems to have swung in the other direction. Comparative religious ethicists often adopt a brand of liberal moral relativism. \"To each their own\" is their preferred mantra. This dramatic swing within the field of comparative religious ethics opens up questions for future study: Under what conditions can we praise or blame those who are different than us? What virtues of scholarship are necessary for quality comparative work? In this course we will learn about the field of comparative religious ethics and the perils and possibilities that accompany its intellectual projects. In addition to several theoretical texts, we will read two ethnographies (Fernando 2014 and Pandian 2009) that weave in and out of comparative religious ethics. These texts focus on themes of nationalism, post-colonialism, immigration, the production and regulation of religious subjects, and the limits of our judgments on the other.\n\nInstructor(s): Caroline Anglim Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 24160\n\nANTH 23915. Religion, Reason, and the State. 100 Units.\n\nThe second quarter of this sequence explores the work of key theorists on the role of religion in modern society, politics, and the state. Central questions include: How has state power transformed religious institutions, knowledge, and practice? How can we account for the persistence of religious commitments in the face of secularization? What role has religion played in revolutionary movements and in resistance against state power?\n\nInstructor(s): Alireza Doostdar Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): No prerequisites.\n\nNote(s): This is the second of a two-quarter sequence.

Race and Religion: Theorizing Blackness and Jewishness. 100 Units.\n\nFounded on ideals of universalism, pluralism and secularism, France and the United States are fraught with contradictions when it comes to race and religion. Which religions are accepted? Which religions are suspect? Is it minority that defines the difference-or only particular kinds of minority, such as race? To untangle the intersections of race and religion, we will examine Blackness and Jewishness as they are represented in political polemic, fiction, memoir and philosophy from the 1960s to the present. This course introduces students to the foundational concepts for the critical study of race and religion through exploring the constructions of Black and Jewish identity. We will examine the contradictions of secular politics and culture in France and the United States, and discuss how religion, race, and intersecting categories such as gender and sexuality, can become tools of critique. Readings include works by thinkers such as Césaire, Fanon, Memmi, Levinas and Foucault, along with literary classics by Nella Larsen and Sarah Kofman, and contemporary critical essays by Judith Butler, Christina Sharpe and Talal Asad. Throughout this course, we will examine how the concepts of race and religion are key components of the political, philosophical and ethical projects of these authors. No prerequisite knowledge of critical theory, or this historical period, is expected.\n\nInstructor(s): Kirsten Collins Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 27721, CMLT 27721, RLST 27721, GLST 27721, FREN 27721, CRES 27721, JWSC 27721\n\nANTH 23920. Gaming Religion. 100 Units.\n\nVideo games commonly feature religious ideas, imagery, emotions, and practices. In this course, we will take a hands-on, experimental approach to the study of religion in video games. We will play various games individually and in groups, and reflect on the design and gameplay in conversation with readings in theory.\n\nInstructor(s): Alireza Doostdar Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 28990\n\nANTH 24001-24002-24003.

Jews, Arabs, and Others: Nations from the Nile to the Jordan. 100 Units.\n\nThis course considers nationbuilding as an ongoing and recurring process in the Middle East, realigning identities and communities according to the political concerns of the time. In particular, we will examine how Arabs and Others have figured in the political imagination of both Egypt and Israel-Palestine. When can Egyptians, Palestinians, and Israelis consider themselves \"Arab\"--and when not? What are the stakes of naming Arab-ness or claiming it for oneself? To answer these questions, this course will include readings and popular films on Arab nationalism and minorities in Egypt, the question of Jewish versus Israeli nationalism, Arab (or Mizrahi) Jews in Israel, and the relationship of Palestinian nationalism to the borders that have been drawn within the historic land of Palestine.\n\nInstructor(s): Callie Maidhof Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 25209, GLST 25209\n\nANTH 24125. Technology and Human Rights. 100 Units.\n\nThe international human rights regime took form in the shadow of the atom bomb and WWII, a historical juncture, which for many marked the limits of techno-scientific rationality and progress. Utopian narratives of inevitable, technologically-driven social and economic progress nonetheless remain a cornerstone of American political and cultural imaginaries. In this course, we will draw on anthropology, law, and allied disciplines to explore the ambiguous intersections of technological innovation and human rights. Through a series of case studies, the course will consider how new technologies and their allied knowledge practices call into question the foundational categories of human rights law, complicating understandings of the individual, person hood, family, and life. The course will further examine how emerging developments in biotechnology, information technology, robotics, and AI variously enhance and undermine the substantive protections of human rights, including the rights to health, privacy, freedom of expression, security, and indigenous knowledge. Finally, we will consider how human rights norms and institutions can be mobilized to inform and constrain the design and application of potentially threatening new technologies.\n\nInstructor(s): Lake Polan, Pozen Center for Human Rights Social Science Teaching Fellow Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HMRT 34125, HMRT 24125\n\nANTH 24304. Talking With Animals. 100 Units.\n\nAll over the world, children have long learned the lessons of what it means to be human from what animals tell them. In addition to ventriloquizing non-human animals to socialize human ones, projects for facilitating cross-species communication abound. These projects reveal not only how people imagine their relations with other animals, but also how we conceive of the possibilities and limits of sign systems. And while many focus on talking with animals, others suggest that animals are effective communicators precisely because they lack language, raising fascinating questions about ideologies of (im)mediation. As we learn how Peruvian kids talk with llamas and American cowboys whisper to wild horses, and explore what spiders say and how apes read the human keepers who teach them to sign, this class explores how distinctions are drawn between human and non-human animals, as well as attempts to cross those divides through communicative forms and technologies.\n\nInstructor(s): E. Summerson Carr Terms Offered: TBD\n\nANTH 24314. Meaning and the Body. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines recent (20th- and 21st-century) retrievals of the body to understand \"meaning.\" We will analyze varying construals of nature, materiality, matter, emotion, and thought. Readings will therefore be multidisciplinary, including selections from philosophy, sociolinguistics, anthropology, and religious studies. More specifically, we will examine the relationship between meaning and embodiment by way of the following: modern philosophies of the subject; analytic philosophies of language; deconstruction and the historicization of the body; feminist theories of discourse; new materialist conceptions of matter; new animist conceptions of the subject.\n\nInstructor(s): Lisa Landoe Hedrick Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 26116, RLST 26116\n\nANTH 24316. Thinking Psychoanalytically: From the Sciences to the Arts. 100 Units.\n\nSince Freud's seminal investigation into the nature of the mind, psychoanalytic thinking has offered a unique approach to unconscious, relational, and meaningful dimensions of human experience. Despite assaults on the field from numerous quarters, psychoanalytic thinking remains central to the work of practitioners across an array of disciplines. After an introduction to key psychoanalytic concepts including the unconscious, repression, and transference, we will investigate some of the ways in which these ideas are mobilized within clinical practice, neuroscience, anthropology, education, philosophy, literary studies, and the visual arts through a series of lectures presented by specialists from these fields. Along the way, we will gain an appreciation for some of the ways in which psychoanalytic perspectives continue to inspire a variety of current scientific and humanistic projects.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

Cultural Psychology. 100 Units.\n\nThere is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of \"normal\" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of \"culture\" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Psychological Anthropology. 100 Units.\n\nThis course traces the development of the field of psychological anthropology and critically reviews the various paradigms adopted by psychological anthropologists. In our discussions, we will draw examples from different cultural contexts to critically examine the relationship between culture and psychological functioning. By the end of the quarter, you will develop an insightful understanding of the cultural sources of the self, mind, behavior, and mental health as well as a substantial knowledge of the field of psychological anthropology.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

Human Rights and Postcolonial Politics. 100 Units.\n\nThis class focuses on the history and theory of human rights by considering it as a quintessentially postcolonial political form. We consider how Euro-American genealogies of rights intersect and interact with trajectories of colonial rule and postcolonial politics. In the process, the question of rights itself comes to be posed afresh. Empirically, the class focuses on the histories and presents of India and South Africa. Both these countries underwent processes of constitutional decolonization. Thus, rights have a foundational place in both postcolonial polities. What does that mean? How does that create openings for the imaginations and instantiations of socially transformative policies? How does it lead to the endurance of traces and aspects of colonial government? What are the promises and limits of rights as we consider them in such historical and political contexts? In what ways are political struggles in these countries marked as being both for and against rights? In the process, how does our thinking and conceptualization of rights itself come to be at stake?\n\nInstructor(s): Kaushik Sunder Rajan\n\nANTH 24501.

Anthropology of Museums. 100 Units.\n\nThis course uses anthropological reflections on \"objects and others\" to discuss questions of collection, classification, and curation in museum spaces. Anthropological engagements with material culture define early moments in the discipline's history and frame debates about typology and the observation of difference, as well as documentation and display. Through a series of readings, museum visits, and object-centered exercises, this undergraduate seminar will foreground questions of heritage and memory, ethical concerns about the ownership of collections and their display, and the publics that museums seek to address and be accountable to.\n\nInstructor(s): Mannat Johal Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHST 24510\n\nANTH 24702. Un/Making Citizenship: The Politics of the Intimate. 100 Units.\n\nThe state is like a gravitational force that holds people in relation to itself, tugging and turning each person to different degrees. Citizenship is the mediation of that relationship. In this course, we examine different dimensions of citizenship across the life course, considering the ways people are formed into certain kinds of subjects. We ask: how and why are intimate life events of interest not only to those involved, but also to governing authorities? From the governance of conception and birth, to the (non)conferral of legal identities, the state manages legitimacy through documents like birth certificates, whose contents or absence can shape a person's entire life trajectory. In childhood, schools work to transform children into certain kinds of future citizens. From legal adulthood's gradual accrual of rights -- to vote, to have sex, to drink, to stand trial -- to old age and long after death, citizenship extends beyond the lifecourse. Over the course of the quarter, we investigate the ways people negotiate attempts to transform them into citizens, examining in particular how citizenship is mediated in relation to religion, sexuality, migration, disability, marriage, pregnancy, old age, and death.\n\nInstructor(s): Kathryn Takabvirwa Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHDV 24702, GNSE 24704\n\nANTH 24711. The Prophet Q. 100 Units.\n\nIn the wake of the January 6, 2021, storming of the United States Capitol, the QAnon phenomenon has received sustained global attention as news and government agencies scramble to understand this online movement's role in the attack, the threat it continues to pose, and why it is that one out of every six Americans believes that former President Trump is secretly battling an elite group of politicians, media moguls, and academics who are deeply involved in child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice. This course will investigate the phenomenon of QAnon through the lens of New Religious Movements (NRMs)--seeking to understand the complex interplay of factors that incites people to become immersed in these groups. Using examples from American New Religious Movements of the 20th century such as Scientology, the Rajneesh movement, and Jonestown, we will delve into the history of these groups in order to examine the motivations that drive individuals into these \"fringe\" religious movements. In the process, we will interrogate the usefulness of such labels as \"religion\" and \"cult,\" and ultimately hope to better understand how power, race, gender, and practices of dissimulation play active roles in both these new religious movements and within QAnon.\n\nInstructor(s): Marielle Harrison Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 28991, AMER 28991, SOCI 20540\n\nANTH 24730. Religious Violence. 100 Units.\n\nAre there \"proper\" or \"improper\" practices of religion? Is it at best a matter of private belief, to be kept separate from or protected by the state? Or is it something that at times requires the state's intervention? Does religion represent the last vestiges of the premodern world, or is it something that is integral to modern life? To answer these questions, we will call on anthropologists and other social scientists and theorists to understand, first, what is \"religion,\" and then what is, can be, or should be its relationship to gender, the nation, and the modern state in various historical and geographical locations, with particular attention to the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nInstructor(s): Callie Maidhof Terms Offered: Not offered 2022-2023\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 26630, GLST 25630\n\nANTH 25208. Bodies, Gifts, and Commodities. 100 Units.\n\nThis course presents a survey of anthropological theories of gifts and commodities and how they have been used to explain exchanges involving the human body. We will consider various forms of labor, including sex work and paid surrogacy, exchanges enabled by modern biotechnologies, such as organ and tissue donation, as well as other contexts where the body is objectified and fragmented, such as in the discovery and marketing of genetic materials and processes.\n\nInstructor(s): Elham Mireshghi Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): AASR 37570, GNSE 27570, RLST 27570\n\nANTH 25211. Feminism and Anthropology. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the fraught yet generative relation between various movements of feminism and the discipline of anthropology. Both feminism(s) and anthropology emerged in the 19th century as fields invested in thinking \"the human\" through questions of alterity or Otherness. As such, feminist and anthropological inquiries often take up shared objects of analysis--including nature/culture, kinship, the body, sexuality, exchange, value and power-even as they differ in their political and scholarly orientations through the last century and a half. Tracking the emergence of feminisms and anthropology as distinct fields of academic discourse on the one hand and political intervention on the Other, we will pursue the following lines of inquiry: 1) a genealogical approach to key concepts and problem-spaces forged at the intersection of these two fields 2) critical analysis of the relation of feminist and postcolonial social movements to the professionalizing fields of knowledge production (including Marxist inspired writing on women and economy, Third World feminism and intersectionality, and feminist critiques of science studies) and 3) a reflexive contemporary examination of the way these two strands of thought have come together in the subfield of feminist anthropology and the continual frictions and resonances of feminist and anthropological approaches in academic settings and in the larger world (e.g., #MeToo, sex positive activism, queer politics, feminist economics).\n\nInstructor(s): Chu, Julie Cole, Jennifer Terms Offered: TBD\n\nPrerequisite(s): 3rd and 4th year undergraduates only.

(Re)Producing Race and Gender through American Material Culture. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces students to the role of the material world in the production and reproduction of ideologies of race, gender, and their intersections. Objects around us are imbued with meaning through their design, construction, use, and disuse. Architecture, art, photography, clothing, quilts, toys, food, and even the body have all been used to define groups of people. Combining secondary literature, theory, documentary evidence, and material culture, this course guides students as they ask questions about how ideologies of race and gender are produced, how they are both historically specific and constantly in flux, and how human interaction with the material world creates, challenges, and changes their construction. The primary course objectives are to (1) provide students with an introduction to material culture as a theory and methodology and (2) teach them how to apply it to research on ideologies of gender and race in history.\n\nTerms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 27530, HIST 27414, CRES 27530, GNSE 27530\n\nANTH 25215. Human Rights: An Anthropological Perspective. 100 Units.\n\nWhile the modern human rights regime developed largely absent input from anthropology, the discipline stakes its scholarly identity on claims to expertise over the nature of human being and the diversity of human experience. Anthropologists have long studied aspects of lived experience of central concern to human rights, including state violence, cultural difference, and structural inequality. In recent decades, they have focused increasing attention on the institutions and practices through which activists adopt and rework human rights concepts in local political and social struggles. Against this backdrop, Human Rights and the Human Experience will deploy anthropology's distinctive knowledge practices and ethical sensitivities to analyze human rights as both global force and as creative resource in local movements for dignity, security, and human flourishing.\n\nInstructor(s): Lake Polan, Pozen Center for Human Rights Social Science Teaching Fellow Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HMRT 26200\n\nANTH 25216. Gender, Sex, and Culture. 100 Units.\n\nThis introductory graduate course examines the social construction of gendered identities in different times and places. We study culturally-specific gendered experiences, 'roles,' rights and rebellions around the world, discussing the individual and social consequences of gender and the interrelationships between gender and other categories for identity including race, class and sexuality. While focusing on the global diversity of gendered experience and expectations, we also examine gender in the US, taking a critical approach to understanding gendered inequality and gender-based and sexual violence both abroad and at home. Finally, we examine the role of gendered expectations in Western science, the relationship between gender and 'globalization,' and the contemporary movements affecting change in gendered norms, especially in the arts and media.
