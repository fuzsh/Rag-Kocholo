        "text": "July 31, 1953 – October 2, 2023\n\nKathy Gibson passed away in her home at dawn on October 2, 2023 with her two loyal sons by her side. She was 70. During her last few months, Kathy was blindsided by a sudden and aggressive battle with cancer.\n\nKathy was born in San Francisco to Chuck and Betty Mangan and raised in Denver. Growing up, she enjoyed working at the horse stables and riding Dinah Jo, the horse that she shared with her brothers Chuck and Phil. Kathy found an outlet for her creativity working as a Property Manager (“props”) in her school theater. After graduating from South High School, she attended Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and then Loretto Heights College in Denver, graduating with a degree in Early Childhood Development.\n\nOn a weekend trip to Aspen in 1977 she met her future husband David Gibson, a local architect and single-father of a young daughter, Eren. Feeling an attraction to the beauty of the mountains and to the handsome man, Kathy soon returned and made Aspen/Snowmass her permanent home for the next 46 years. Kathy and David were married at the Prince of Peace Chapel in September of 1978. Together they had two sons, Jared in 1981 and Colin in 1984. David also introduced Kathy to First Baptist Church of Aspen, where she forged some of her closest lifelong friendships, including her “Elevensies”.\n\nKathy was a teacher at several local schools, including the Aspen Community School, the Little Red Schoolhouse, and Aspen Elementary and Middle School. She also worked at Sport Obermeyer in the 1990’s. While training for a local triathlon, Kathy recognized that the active community needed a safe way for bikers and pedestrians to cross Maroon Creek beside the narrow Highway 82 trestle bridge. She made this her personal mission and campaigned tirelessly until the Maroon Creek Pedestrian bridge was approved and built in 1995.\n\nAfter seeing their sons graduate from Aspen High School, Kathy and David began to explore the world together, making trips to Hawaii, France, Italy, England, Santa Fe, and the Caymans. In July 2006, David was killed in a crash while piloting his single-engine airplane between Aspen and Telluride. In the aftermath of this horrible tragedy, Kathy sought renewed purpose to lift herself back up. She found it in the Aspen Community Theater and the Shining Stars.\n\nKathy joined A.C.T. in the fall of 2006 for her first production, Fiddler on the Roof, where she rediscovered her love of the Props Department. She volunteered for about a dozen productions with A.C.T., and later served on the Board of Directors for a few seasons. Some of her favorite productions were Spamalot, Beauty and the Beast, and Crazy For You. She also volunteered with Theater in the Park and the Hudson Reed Ensemble.\n\nIn March of 2007, Kathy joined the Shining Stars, a local foundation that provides adventures and support for children with cancer or other serious illness. Each winter, the Shining Stars hosts children from around the country for a week of lively activities and fellowship: skiing, dancing, singing, crafting, costumes, cutting loose, laughing and smiling. This is where Kathy’s heart and spirit truly shined through. She would volunteer as a Buddy every winter until 2023. It was the most joyous and meaningful experience of her life.\n\nKathy was forever young at heart. She was always eager to stop and chat with old friends on the sidewalks of town or in the aisles of Clark’s Market. She was a talented watercolor painter, and loved painting landscapes from her deck overlooking Brush Creek. She loved biking the Rio Grande trail, skiing at High Alpine and Elk Camp, hiking with her dogs on the Snowmass ditch trail, cross-country skiing at Northstar Preserve, and sitting on the lawn with friends at the Aspen Music Tent. She loved cheering for the Broncos, the Rockies, and the Tour De France. Even in the face of her unforgiving illness Kathy never gave up fighting, never gave up hope, and never gave up her big youthful smile.\n\nKathy and her sons wanted to thank all of those who provided her compassionate care and support through her most difficult time: Dr. Peter Rossi and the staff at Calaway Cancer Center at Valley View Hospital; her nurse Oanh and the staff at HomeCare and Hospice of the Valley; Darnell Langley; Allison Daily, Debbie Kreutzer and the wonderful volunteers of Pathfinders; and all of her friends and family who showed their love and support.\n\nKathy is survived by her sons Jared and Colin, step-daughter Eren, twin-brother Chuck, and brother Phil."
