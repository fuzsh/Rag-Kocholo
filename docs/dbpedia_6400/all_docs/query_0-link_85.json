        "text": "Scuba diving in Lembeh Strait, Indonesia\n\nLembeh Strait diving highlights\n\nLembeh Strait is the muck diving capital of the world and, is definitely one of the best macro photography destinations in the world. Underwater photographers flock here from all over the world to see a myriad of critters, frogfish, pipefish, nudibranchs, seahorses, juvenile fish, and other exotic animals. Don't expect beautiful coral reefs in Lembeh itself, but very scenic reefs exist at nearby islands.\n\nScuba diving in Lembeh is usually done via a dive resort, although you'll find liveaboard trips here and there then include Lembeh as one of the featured stops. The dive guides in Lembeh are renowned their ability to spot the tiniest little critters for macro photography enthusiasts.\n\nJump to:\n\nMarine Life & Critters - Best Dive Sites - Diving Conditions\n\nHow to Get There - Dive Resorts in Lembeh - Best Time to Dive\n\nPractical Information - Book a Trip\n\nIntro to Lembeh Strait\n\nLembeh Strait in North Sulawesi near Manado, Indonesia, is a dive area rich with life. You can see more macro subjects here than you ever dreamed possible. The area of Lembeh is rich in dark volcanic sand, which is partially responsible for the rich marine life.\n\nLarry Smith pioneered diving in Lembeh Strait in the early to mid-1990s. KBR Lembeh Dive Resort was the first resort in Lembeh, followed by many more. Some people now think Lembeh is getting a little crowded but there are a lot of dive sites to visit, and it's really a matter of choosing a great dive operation.\n\nLembeh's low surge and mild currents make it ideal for macro and super-macro photography - don't forget your underwater camera. Visibility is usually never great but is always good enough for macro. While most famous for macro, Lembeh also has a decent number of wrecks and a couple of wide-angle spots to the north.\n\nView Location on Google Map\n\nBack to Menu\n\nDiving Information\n\nMarine Life & Critters in Lembeh Strait\n\nLembeh Strait has a great assortment of strange fish, macro critters and nudibranchs. You can view photos and a list of all the Lembeh marine life in the muck diving critter guide.\n\nSome of the species that you can see include hairy frogfish, flamboyant cuttlefish, juvenile barramundi cods, juvenile pinnate batfish, rhinopias, harlequin shrimps, mandarin fish, snakeblennies in the open, and large beautiful stinging anemones.\n\nHere’s a list of some of the marine life and critters that you can see and photograph while diving Lembeh Strait:\n\nMany different seahorses including several species of pygmies\n\nVarious squid species,\n\nBroadclub, pygmy and flamboyant cuttlefish\n\nMany different octopuses including blue-ring, mimic and wonderpus\n\nOrnate, robust and Halimeda ghost pipefish, pipehorses\n\nMany different filefish, boxfish and puffers\n\nCrinoid shrimp, Harlequin shrimp\n\nBubble-coral shrimp\n\nMantis shrimp and many other shrimps\n\nOrangutan crabs, decorator crabs, and other crabs\n\nBanggai cardinalfish\n\nAssorted anemonefish\n\nGobies and blennies\n\nSnake eels, garden eels, ribbon eels and various morays\n\nRazorfish\n\nSchooling striped catfish\n\nFrogfish in every size and color\n\nFlying gurnards, spiny devilfish and other scorpionfish\n\nBobbit worms\n\nTremendous variety of nudibranchs\n\nand the list goes on…\n\nLembeh Strait Diving Conditions\n\nWater Temperature: Lembeh gets colder around July and August with water temperatures averaging at 25°C (77°F). Bundle up! Some people think the most critters are out during the cold months. Water temps get up to 28° C (82°F) in Jan-Feb. Wear a full wetsuit year-round to protect against cuts, jellies, and getting cold during long dives.\n\nVisibility: Around 30ft (10m) year-round\n\nDepth Range: 5 - 30m\n\nTypical dive in lembeh Strait\n\nYour dive boat will usually go out for 1 or 2 dives at a time. Generally, you will be in a small boat with 1 guide and 1-3 other divers. Depending on the dive site, you'll start your dive in 50 - 80ft of water and then start to work your way shallower on a sandy slope.\n\nAs you are photographing one amazing subject, your dive guide will be busy finding your next subject. A super-macro lens will often come in handy. Other divers swimming by may silt up your area, causing you to curse underwater. You take so many shots that your memory card fills up, or your battery dies, causing you to curse underwater.\n\nTo learn more, read about our latest trip to Lembeh here.\n\nLembeh Strait's Dive Sites\n\nThe dive sites in Lembeh are generally sand, rock, muck, or rubble, but there are a couple of sites with nice corals and walls. Marine life is generally prolific from 3-4 meters depth down to 25 meters depth. Police Pier, Nudie Falls, Nudie Retreat and TK3 are definitely target-rich environments that you want to dive early and often. California dreaming and Angel's falls offer good wide-angle opportunities.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nlembeh travel information\n\nHow to Get to Lembeh\n\nMost people fly to Manado (MDN) through Singapore (SIN) on a 3.5-hour flight.
