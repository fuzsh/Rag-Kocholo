        "text": "In the midst of the American civil rights movement, Mexican American activists recognized the need for an institution around which Mexican Americans could rally and organize.\n\nWith the aim of bringing Mexican American groups together into a single unified front, Herman Gallegos, Dr. Julian Samora, and Dr. Ernesto Galarza established the Southwest\n\nCouncil of La Raza in 1968 in Phoenix, Arizona. The founders remained integral to the organization’s success for decades after. Seven local groups formed the original network of Affiliates, beginning the organization’s legacy as a champion for Latino-serving community organizations.\n\nIn 1972, the Southwest Council was renamed the National Council of La Raza, or NCLR, and moved operations to Washington, DC, to establish its national influence. That same year, bylaws were amended to require equal representation of genders on the Board of Directors. In 1974, the Board chose Raul Yzaguirre to lead the organization, a position he held for 30 years.\n\nBy 1980, NCLR was the nation’s largest provider of technical assistance to Latino community-based organizations.\n\nThis grassroots perspective offered a real-world view of the major issues of the time, giving Hispanics a credible voice in Washington. The Policy Analysis Center was established to conduct research, testify on Capitol Hill, and provide expert advice in drafting legislation.\n\nCongress sought NCLR’s expertise when drafting the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted legal status to nearly three million undocumented immigrants.\n\nNCLR’s third decade emphasized the American Dream of a healthy home.\n\nAdvocacy led to expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and later creating the Child Tax Credit in 2002. Approximately 10 million Latino children have been lifted out of poverty because of these credits.\n\nThe NCLR Homeownership Network launched in 1997, providing counseling services to families dreaming of owning a home. Since then, 600,000 households have received counseling. NCLR also began a journey to improve Latino representation and opportunities in entertainment.\n\nThe NCLR Bravo Awards, later renamed the ALMA Awards®, first aired in 1995 during primetime on Fox.\n\nThe dawn of new millennium affirmed NCLR as a powerful DC institution.\n\nAfter three decades of leadership, Raul Yzaguirre retired in 2004. The Board of Directors unanimously chose Janet Murguía as NCLR’s next President and CEO. Murguía’s tenure began with a nationwide listening tour, seeking advice from Affiliates on how to strengthen the NCLR-Affiliate\n\nbond.\n\nTo cement its role as a major influence in Washington, in 2005 NCLR established a national headquarters building just four blocks from the White House."
