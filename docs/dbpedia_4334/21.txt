Performing All The Hits And More

Linda Ronstadt was the rare artist who could comfortably cover a wide variety of musical bases; including folk, rock, country, jazz standards, opera and Latin. Her vocal gift had few limitations and she showcased it with every recording and performance. Her incredible vocal instrument along with her classic song interpretations have earned her countless devoted fans across the world. Sadly, Linda has been stricken with Parkinson’s Disease and can no longer sing or perform. The Linda Ronstadt Experience is excited to help keep her legacy alive by continuing to share the joy and beauty of her repertoire to a wide audience.“Music is meant to lighten your load. By singing it, you release the sadness and release yourself.” – Linda Ronstadt

How The Linda Ronstadt Experience Came To Be

In June of 2017 bassist Junior Cain ran a local ad in the Northeast seeking a Linda Ronstadt style singer. He proceeded to assemble a band of players that echoed his love for the artist, who had been stricken with Parkinson disease and left her unable to sing or perform. After a few early personnel changes Junior decided to place ads in the musical hot spots of Nashville and Austin. After a few weeks Tristan McIntosh’s Nashville Management replied to the ad. It was decided that Tristan’s closest musical collaborator Bronson Bush, would fill out the role as one of the bands guitarist. In March 2018 thirty songs were sent out to the potential band members to learn. In June of 2018, Tristan and Bronson flew into Boston to rehearse the material for three days, then shoot video on day four. It took a tremendous “Leap of Faith” on everyone’s part but when all the members met the chemistry and good vibes were undeniable. Then Tristan began to sing and everyone knew that this was going to be something very special.

Brilliant musicianship all around – and a truly spellbinding performance by Tristan McIntosh as well.

“We decided to see your show last minute Friday at the Aracada and I was expecting some nice Linda Ronstadt songs and have a couple drinks. We were completely blown away by you and the band. We are still talking about it, and we saw Hamilton Saturday! Even though we were in a small space, you sang your heart out as if you were at the Allstate Arena. You are all passionate about her music. The last thing that made the night so special was the humility you and the band had. That you were so grateful to be able to play, even a tiny little place in suburbia. Made us feel special. Don’t forget this. See you next time you come in town.”

– Terri, Fan, Wheaton, IL,

“I’ve always loved Linda’s signature look of a flower in her hair. Usually a red Hibiscus. She is my favorite female singers of all time and you sound so much like her. What an amazing tribute to her! I hope you’ve met her & she knows about your band!”

“Great performance!”

– Eileen, Fan

“I knew this was going to be a good show when, in sound check, Tristan sang for the first time and an older gentleman who had arrived early exclaimed “Holy S#*%!!!”. I looked at him and laughed because I was thinking the same thing.”

– Music on Main Street, Woodbridge, NJ

“Many years ago my wife and I went to see Linda at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. At first my wife was downed by the news that the show was sold out. I said let’s go and meet the scalpers outside the theatre. We wound up in the 1st row, 1st balcony. This past Sunday we had the privilege to see your group in Woodbrige NJ. I had all the same chills and found myself saying ‘Oh my goodness’. It was truly an experience beyond belief.”

– Uncredited Fan, Woodbridge, NJ

“Just go see them in your neighborhood. What a talent, what a voice and what a band.”

– Joe, fan
