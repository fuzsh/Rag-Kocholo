Most, if not all of these songs were produced and written... well... off the top. There's no better way of putting it, and no better way it could've been done.\n\nJustine Blazer\n\ninternational producer, vocalist, songwriter, sync/TV composer, and recording artist.

He remembers listening to artists like George Strait, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, Joe Diffie, and a lot of others with his grandfather and uncles. But it wasn’t until he was 18 that he truly leaned into music in a more personal way. He was signing up for classes to study marine biology in college, but before he hit submit, he hesitated. He realized he didn’t want to go down that route at all, he wanted to be a singer. In an instant, he changed the course of his life from the classic pipeline of going to college, getting a degree and then a job, and became the dreamer. This must have been scary for his parents to hear, but they made him a deal. He was to get some kind of degree to have a backup plan in case music didn’t work, and once he did that, they’d help him get to Nashville. He’s now been in Nashville for almost five years."
