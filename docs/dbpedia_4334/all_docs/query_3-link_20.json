        "text": "Rosabella Gregory is an award-winning songwriter, arranger and composer. She has released three solo albums and performed her work throughout the UK and internationally, at venues such as The Royal Festival Hall, Live at Zédel and in support of the legendary Jools Holland on his Country House tour.\n\nHer musicianship has led to collaborations with such luminaries as Bob James, Soumik Datta and Árstíðir. Rosabella composes for theatre, television and opera, and her work has been performed at such venues as Hoxton Hall, The Arcola and 59E59 NYC.\n\nCollaborating with her twin Dina has given Rosabella her most rewarding writing experiences, from writing a rock opera for the ENO Lilian Baylis programme at 16 to winning the Vivian Ellis prize at 21, right up to the present day and their collaboration on a new adaptation of The Wind in the Willows for Audible starring Jennifer Saunders and Harriet Walter.\n\nIn 2021 Broadway Records released a World Premiere Recording of their musical “My Marcello” with an all-star cast including Santino Fontana, Laura Osnes, Terrence Mann and Derek Klena. In June 2023, Rosabella was both the Composer and Musical Director of “T- room…The Musical” commissioned by Endstation Theatre Company, which premiered at Thoresen Theatre, Randolph College, Lynchburg, VA. Recent opera commissions include “Tutankhamun’s Shoes” for English Touring Opera and “Sammy And The Beanstalk” for OperaUpClose.\n\nRosabella Gregory and Dina have collaborated on a brand new opera “The Haberdasher Prince”, commissioned by the Lyric Opera of Kansas City that will tour the Kansas City metropolitan area from April 2024 until June 2025."
