        "text": "I love reading around a subject while writing, and work on my book about The Jam has me not only returning to or finally delving into various other publications about the band, but also reliving the years around which they were together (1972 to 1982) and immersing myself in extra background concerning a Surrey patch barely half a dozen miles from my own Guildford roots.\n\nAnd among the best biographies, appreciations, and invaluable first-hand accounts, I’ve devoured two books that until now sat on the shelf unread, finally thinking the moment was right.\n\nMy better half and I became foster carers in 2022, another key reason why I felt the time had come to tackle Paolo Hewitt’s memoir of his Woking children’s home days, The Looked After Kid and its follow-up, We All Shine On. And it’s fair to say both publications truly nail the subject – providing an extra layer of understanding to something I felt I already knew plenty about, a few key points on our own recent bumpy journey making more sense.\n\nIt’s not the right place to go into detail, but we’ve been on numerous county council-run courses regarding children in care and how to learn from all that and add your own positive life experiences to the mix, so as to best pass on some of that learning and understanding to less fortunate young people who miss out on basic building blocks along the rocky way.\n\nWe’ve spent valuable time getting to grips with the realities of all that, enriched by it all, and – for all the low points – gaining so much from the experience. Yet I felt I learned a little more from a skilled writer who’s been there and knows the subject so well, a Looked After Kid who somehow found his way out of the wild, wild wood, as an old friend might have put it.\n\nIn many ways, I reckon I’ve been the lucky one. Brought up in a solid working-class family with very little money to spare but always lots of love to go around, with plenty of friends and family I could count on. Paolo’s own background was much harder, personal circumstances and the bigger system letting him down time and again. However, he ultimately beat the odds, I feel, making his own positive impact, proving his own sense of worth and finding that love for himself.\n\nFor all our disparate beginnings, we have much in common, from shared geography to the cultural and sporting influences that inspired us going forward. Music and football clearly had a pull on us, and alongside Paolo’s enduring passion for all things Tottenham Hotspur and SSC Napoli, there’s a nostalgic appreciation of Woking FC too, his grounding there long before I became a late-Eighties Kingfield regular. As for the music, he first properly got to know The Jam just as they were making their first successful forays on the London scene and pretty soon followed suit, getting to know the chief songwriter along the way, a friendship developing. It seems it was rarely a cosy relationship. Complicated might be a better word. But there was plenty of love too, and he saw in the Weller family dynamic something missing from his own upbringing.\n\nIn a sense, Paolo – who turned 66 this week, just under seven weeks after a certain Paul Weller – got the writer’s life I felt I craved in my teens. I finally went down the regional journalism line in my late 20s after several years of office jobs and working for weekends, travel and holidays, until then making do with penning my own fanzines and scribbling away on the novels and scripts while going large on life experiences. Paolo’s own path took in the halcyon late Seventies, Eighties and Nineties days of the Melody Maker, the NME and further afield, writing on many subjects dear to my own heart. But there was always something else there driving him, and it would take him a long time to get to grips with his past and his beginnings.\n\nAnd despite the picture I paint of my own relatively safe and certainly contented upbringing, I often wonder if Paolo’s early fate could have been mine. I revisit key parts of my mum’s life story, going back to Reading, Berkshire (notably losing her mum to TB when she was barely five, her dad soon marrying again, ultimately keeping the family together) and see a girl who could so easily have ended up in care and in an orphanage, maybe even shipped across the Commonwealth, possibly landing with non-deserving foster or adoptive parents. I also revisit key parts of my dad’s early years in Woking, and there are further elements there. From his days as a steam loco fireman through to 30-plus years as a postman and beyond, I think he was acutely aware that the break-up of his parents’ marriage might well have seen his destiny change for the worse. But here were a couple who stayed together long enough for him to find his own way. In fact, love overcame in both cases, my folks taking that on with their own family, the fate of us five Wyatt children (and the nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren that followed) testament to that.\n\nOther parts of Paolo’s Burbank books similarly resonate, such as the tale of his good friend Des, who has a close link to a long-time friend of mine (and fellow Woking FC fan). I’ve since learned that Des had some of his happier later years in the village I grew up in. Then there are Paolo’s words about the first children’s home he knew, in the next village to my own, where I was meeting schoolmates around the Jam breakthrough years, not so long after his days there. Small world, and all that.\n\nBack on the Woking front, so much of what I equate the town with today (my family links go back to the 1890s, my dad and Wyatt grandparents born and brought up there, my nan still on Arnold Road a century later) is encapsulated in Paul Weller’s songwriting. For me, songs like ‘Saturday’s Kids’, ‘That’s Entertainment’, ‘Town Called Malice’, ‘Liza Radley’, ‘Tales From The Riverbank’ and ‘Wasteland’ (without even delving beyond 1982) couldn’t be about anywhere else. Yet they clearly resonate with so many more outside our bubble (and I get that, in the way so many songs resonate with me that were written in – off the top of my head – Birmingham, Coventry, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Wolverhampton, Belfast, Derry, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, New York, Toronto, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Te Awamutu…). Maybe it’s what Paolo called in our recent conversation (not without affection), ‘that small town mentality’. And while there’s very little about the rise of The Jam in The Looked After Kid and We All Shine On, those books are also integral in revealing more about a Place I Love – for all its negatives – and have got to know fairly well.\n\nAs for Paolo’s autobiographical forays into writing about the care system, they’ve served to make more sense of my own recent involvement on the edge of all that, giving added understanding as to what we’re occasionally dealing with, and that alone proves those publications invaluable for anyone wanting to grasp what it was like to grow up in care in the Sixties and Seventies. In fact, in any era.\n\nIt was only recently that we spoke for the first time, and for two blokes who’d never met there was a lot of reminiscing about old times and new, mostly drawn around similar influences, inspirations and mutual friends and acquaintances. Paolo is more geared towards scriptwriting these days, partly in recognition of realisation that so few authors make a living from their craft today. But we talked openly about all manner of things, not least on football, including recollections of Ken Oram and the Woking FC link (Paolo has his own blighted past with Woking FC, as readers of The Looked After Kid may recall) to Chelsea player turned trainer Harry Medhurst, Paolo’s championing of Spurs striker Martin Chivers in a brief audience with Peter Osgood as a kid, Alan Mullery and Jimmy Greaves’ fear of Millwall fans, and legendary cult hero Robin Friday (who he reckons he saw play at Woking in Hayes days… or hazy days, maybe), who had many of his best sporting moments at Elm Park, Reading, less than a five-minute walk from my mum’s childhood home.\n\nMany of you will know Paolo co-wrote The Greatest Footballer You Never Saw: The Robin Friday Story with Oasis bass player Paul McGuigan (Mainstream Publishing, 1998), and later helped Martin Chivers with his autobiography, Big Chiv: My Goals In Life (Vision Sports, 2009). In fact, he mentions the latter in But We All Shine On, a side-story I feel neatly sums up that ‘living the dream’ mentality he has for his craft, recalling a first return to his children’s home in Woking, and the bedroom where he spent so much of his teen years.\n\nHe writes, ‘I looked at the wall on the right and remembered a picture I had hung on it of David Bowie. I recalled lying on the bed for hours looking at that pic of him as Ziggy Stardust, trying to work out what song he was playing at that exact moment in time, where he was, what he was thinking. I did the exact same thing with my poster of the Spurs centre forward, Martin Chivers.\n\n‘In the picture, Martin was either receiving the ball or passing it. I spent hours wondering what game he was playing in and where the ball was going next, and was he about to score, and who was the opposition? I never did get the answer, but two years ago I met Chivers. My agent called me and said he wanted to write a biography and they were looking for a writer.\n\n‘We met him at a hotel in London. I could hardly look at him. When my agent told him that he was a hero of mine, I actually blushed and looked away. I got to write the biography with him and throughout the whole time I spent with him in his car, I could never tell him about my past and what he meant to me.\n\n‘Chivers once played for Southampton FC. In April 2009 we went there together to interview some of his old team-mates, get information. We caught the train from Waterloo. And it stopped at Woking. Burbank stood half a mile away. I could not believe it. For two minutes as Martin spoke, oblivious to my position I sat there thinking to myself, My God, if you had told me back in Burbank that at some point in my life I would be sat on a train in Woking with Martin Chivers, I would have thought you were mad.\n\n‘As the train slowly slid out of the station I said a little prayer, one of thanks, one of gratitude, that life could be as wondrous as this. That book, his biography, started here in this bedroom.’\n\nThe day we spoke, Paolo’s young lad was at home, our conversation briefly curtailed as he made him a wrap for his lunch.\n\n‘Jam or Brie?’ he asked.\n\n‘Jam, please’ came a muffled voice in the background.\n\n‘Well, there you go, Malcolm!’\n\nThere’s no getting away from it, is there.\n\n‘There’s not, is there!’\n\nSpeaking of which, some subjects we steered clear of, other than conversational mentions of moments like him nipping upstairs to at Michael’s to see the band in the early days ‘with a disco underneath and a gambling club upstairs.’ Or Rick Buckler giving out Jam badges at the Nashville when they started making their big move on London. Or a brief mention of the ‘doddery old colonel’ who ran the Cotteridge Hotel in Woking, one of the band’s old drinking holes.\n\nIn response to mentions of the parts of town I knew best, he mentioned his own ’15-minute walk straight down the hill to Kingfield.’ But somewhere along the line there was a visit to the Civic Hall on my Guildford patch to see Dr Feelgood, Wilko Johnson’s guitar playing the inspiration needed for Paul to make that next step up (at a gig Paolo also attended).\n\nIn my 2002 edition of The Looked After Kid, a certain ‘PW’ – the musician who’s just released his latest solo album, 66, in a summer which will also mark that birthday milestone for Paolo – gets a dedication (referred to as ‘mio fratello’), but within a few years their friendship was behind them, something Paolo respectfully has no wish to air in public, despite this Cappuccino Kid being right up close and personal towards the end of the Jam years and into the Style Council era.\n\nI stood little chance of getting Paolo to reveal much new there, on the record (so to speak), although not really for any other reason than he’s written so much in detail about the band already, starting in book form with authorised biography The Jam: A Beat Concerto (Omnibus Press / Riot Stories, 1983), before taking the story on in Paul Weller: The Changing Man (Bantam Press, 2007).\n\nBoth books I found indispensable. A Beat Concerto was the one I lapped up as a teen. In retrospect, it’s way too raw and came far too soon, the wounds still open. It certainly went down poorly with Bruce Foxton, judging by my correspondence with him in those years (part of which ended up in my first real interview for my Captains Log fanzine). Rick Buckler clearly felt the same way, and a decade later The Jam: Our Story (Castle Communications, 1993) saw a published response from the other two-thirds of The Jam that arguably re-opened those wounds, the Saxa to the fore.\n\nAs for The Changing Man, I do wonder if it’s healthy to write about someone you know so well. I’m sure Paolo has pondered on that. But for me, that biog and John Reed’s Paul Weller: My Ever Changing Moods (Omnibus Press, 1996) are so important in understanding the bigger picture. And there’s real insight on and love for the subject from Paolo, some of which was possibly overlooked by those seeking more salacious detail. As I said, complicated is the word, but I like to think Paolo and John’s books – written by insiders and outsiders, arguably – ultimately celebrate a unique talent and neatly examine where he came from and what makes him tick.\n\nAs for his Burbank books, I won’t go into too much detail (I am 22 and nine years, respectively, late with my reviews, after all), but in The Looked After Kid, Paolo re-examines his life from his 1958 arrival to his move to London and a writing career. It’s inspirational and heartening, and while it was probably lined up on bookshop shelves alongside more harrowing ‘Daddy, don’t’ books, it’s often funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s thought-provoking. As all good biographies should be, right? As Irvine Welsh put it, it’s ‘an uplifting story about refusing to give up on your dreams’.\n\nIt was certainly a brave book to write, no doubt emotionally exhausting for its author, but with time to dwell on it and plenty of praise following, a follow-up was somehow inevitable. And But We All Shine On did that wonderfully, Paolo providing not only great writing but also sensitivity, tracking down a few fellow children’s home friends then asking them about their lives, with often revealing, extremely open responses. Again, words like inspirational, powerful and moving don’t quite do it justice. In the wrong hands, it could have seriously misfired, but once more, there’s humour and colour, and there are fully formed characters you feel real affinity with. As poet and writer Lemn Sissay put it, ‘With his pen Paolo projects light on the darkest path as he seeks the family that never was and unravels a tragic, comical, magical and moving story.’\n\nIt turns out that plans are afoot (fairly advanced) to bring The Looked After Kid to the stage next. Meanwhile, Paolo is busy with his own writing and research, three scripts currently in circulation (‘two film scripts and a TV pilot… one about a tailor, one about Little Italy, one about a ten-year-old boy living with an alcoholic mother.’). Then there’s a project he first previewed on social media a while back, one which on his 66th birthday yesterday, he revealed a few more details about. As the man himself put it, he’s ‘going live’. I’ll let him explain…\n\n‘Using seven of my books (on Oasis, Steve Marriott, Robin Friday, and others) plus stories from my music press past, I am going to put together a reading and take it out to the people. I’m currently talking to venues in Buckinghamshire, London, Glasgow and Birmingham, sorting out ticket prices and sales as we speak. Very much looking forward to it as well. Going to put a lot into this.’\n\nSounds like another winner to me. Regarding the music press days, we’re talking a ‘collection of stories about my work on the music press, 1979-90,’ Lot of big names there – Prince, Springsteen, Strummer, The Specials, to name a few.’ He initially looked to crowdfunding and was ‘very moved by the response I got’, but reckons he was ‘too lazy, should have pushed it more.’ This time he’s determined to get there though.\n\nThat timeline stretches from November ’79, to be precise, and that will ring a bell for Jam fans, his review on the (almost) secret ‘John’s Boys gig at the Marquee early that month carried in the following edition of Melody Maker and leading to a commission for a feature-interview with the band themselves soon after around their Manchester Apollo double dates. And that’s what’s been keeping him busy in the British Library lately, seeking out his music press features, reacquainting himself with his past works. It will certainly include some impressive copy, judging by my own memory of the many impressive interviews carrying his byline in the years that followed.\n\nWe did touch a little more on his Burbank days in conversation, how it was ‘probably 20 kids and three staff’ then, but now ‘three kids and 20 staff,’ a change he heartily commends. And then there were the nuggets of advice on understanding the ‘looked after child’, or in current parlance, ‘the child looked after’ (the child always comes first, you see). Above all else, when he recalls those days in Woking, he reckons it mostly involves happy memories and laughter now, and voyages of discovery, not least about being turned on to new avenues in music and recalling the enduring friendships that were carved out back then.\n\nWhich somehow reminds me of Only Fools and Horses, the regulars reminiscing after a drink-fuelled reunion night out, back at the Trotters’ flat, self-proclaimed midfield dynamo Del Boy recalling the school football team they had in The Class of ‘62.\n\n‘We had Denzil in goal, we had Monkey Harris left-back… we had camaraderie…’\n\nAnd Trigger cuts in, ‘Was that the Italian boy?’\n\nHere’s to the next chapter, Paolo. Looking forward to our next catch-up.\n\nFor the latest from Paolo Hewitt, head to his website here. Meanwhile, if you have a story to share about seeing The Jam back in the day, or would like to pen an appreciation of the band and the impact they made on your life, and you’d like to be included in Solid Bond In Your Heart: A People’s History of The Jam (introduced on these pages in this feature), please drop me a line via thedayiwasthere@gmail.com\n\nDo You Believe in the Power of Rock ‘n’ Roll? John Robb does, and I’ve got to realise in recent years that you don’t have to do quite so much preparation for a chat with this ever-entertaining Manchester-based, Fylde coast-born alternative music aficionado.\n\nThrow in a few choice observations about glam, punk, post-punk and indie, for example, and you’re away, as audiences across the UK will soon experience for themselves.\n\nThe author, bass player/vocalist, journalist, presenter, pundit and all-round man about town is set for a 22-date tour celebrating his life in music, running from late March to early May, where he’s sure to discuss everything from recently released bestseller The Art Of Darkness – The History of Goth to being the first person to interview Nirvana, coining of the term ‘Britpop’, and no end of adventures on the post-punk frontline.\n\nHis latest press release throws in ‘many-faceted creature’ too, as well as ‘music website boss, publisher, festival boss, eco-warrior, vegan behemoth and talking head singer from post-punk mainstays The Membranes’. And regular readers here will recall we’ve chewed the fat on many of those fronts before, but this time we’re concentrating on that talking tour.\n\nGrowing up in Fleetwood and Blackpool before punk rock ‘saved him’, John formed The Membranes, the highly influential, forward thinking post-punk band whose more recent albums have attracted no lack of critical acclaim. But he’s never one to put all his Lovely Eggs in one basket, so to speak, and that always ran alongside his writing, formative days on the Rox fanzine leading to a breakthrough ’80s stint with the established rock press, thrashing out copy for Sounds, his CV including becoming somewhat instrumental in kick-starting and documenting the Madchester scene.\n\nThese days, his Louder Than War website is apparently the fifth most-read UK music and culture site, and like its founder it remains at the forefront of diverse modern culture. Also a talking head on Channel 5 music documentaries and regular TV and radio face and voice, and having also dabbled with his other band project, Goldblade, John’s always happy (and richly qualified) to pitch in on music, culture and politics, having become one of our leading in-conversation hosts, with his own successful YouTube channel and a rightly adored book and music festival, Louder Than Words, annually run on his Manchester patch.\n\nThen there are the best-selling books, also including Punk Rock – an Oral History and The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop, plus 2021’s publication on leading eco-energy boss Dale Vince, Manifesto, my interviewee now working on his autobiography and collected journalism works, part of the process of that neatly entwined with his Do You Believe in the Power of Rock ‘n’ Roll? tour.\n\nBut don’t go thinking he has his own plush office space among the swank of modern Manchester, Nuevo Cottonopolis’ own JR clearly one not to get too anchored down in his work, laughing when I ask him if the seemingly ever-falling rain has confined him to his desk.\n\n“My office is usually just a little posh café in town where I sit and type away, but I’ve been away a few days so I’m just catching up.”\n\nHe was in Guernsey the previous week, his first trip to the Channel Islands, but now he’s back, back spinning plates (borrowed from the café, maybe) while looking forward to those live dates, following the success of his last jaunt around the British isles, promoting The Art Of Darkness – The History of Goth.\n\n“Because that book tour went really, a promoter got in touch and said I should go out and do a spoken word thing. I’ll still talk about that book as part of it, but also other stuff I’ve done, for instance that first Nirvana interview, growing up in punk rock in Blackpool, post-punk, and the very DIY nature of it.\n\n“You know, the first gig we played, we’d never been plugged into an amp before, didn’t know what chords were, or anything, it was so fumbling, and lots of people can go, ‘Yeah, I remember doing that as well.’ It’s not just about me. There will be stories that people should recognise, because we’ve all been through that kind of phase, the way punk could just turn people into creatives, who had never previously been creative.\n\n“It was so inspiring, and it will be good to tell that kind of story. The story of bands like the Pistols are really important, but it’s been told a million times, and one of the great things about punk is that it was people in small towns getting it all wrong that actually created something really interesting.”\n\nI was thinking about this recently, be that getting it wrong or just going off at major tangents. For instance, Haircut One Hundred, with Nick Heyward heavily into The Jam and guitarist Graham Jones well into The Clash, but then they went somewhere completely different, helped create an iconic pop outfit. That’s just one example telling a different story, with punk the spark for that DIY approach, inspired kids getting out there and doing their own thing.\n\n“Yeah, the DIY thing was brilliant. Before that, the stage was something locked away from you. I was really into glam rock before punk, including all those bands like Sweet and Mud that you’re meant to pretend you didn’t like now, but were all really ace. And of course, Bowie and T-Rex, but to have any idea of making music seemed to be so remote. Bowie seemed like he was from outer space and everyone else was from London, and in Blackpool both scenes seemed so far away.”\n\nAnd the consensus seems to be that the prog scene was also out of reach, unless you were some kind of virtuoso guitar or keyboard wizard.\n\n“I think that prog thing’s been over-played. For a lot of us, 12 or 13 growing up watching Top of the Pops, you didn’t really know those people even existed. It wasn’t something you couldn’t attain so much as something you were totally unaware of. The music we really knew about was glam rock, then when I started buying music newspapers in about ’74, we’d read about all these other bands, interviews with bands like Man or Budgie, thinking, ‘How do these people even survive if they’re not on Top of the Pops?’ Not knowing you can spend your whole life being in bands and still not get to that level.”\n\nAre you working on your autobiography alongside this latest tour?\n\n“Yeah, somebody’s asked me to do it, so I’ve started collecting stories. And I’ve got loads of stories.”\n\nI don’t doubt it. Are you thinking the live dates are going to prick your memory on a few more tales?\n\n“Oh yeah, I think so, and we’ll see which ones people will be interested in, and the way to make it all work, so maybe I’ll partially be trying that out as I go along. But there are loads and loads of good stories, being part of that Manchester scene and all those years writing for the music papers, later life adventures like being at the Berlin Wall when that came down, when the pickaxes came out, smashing it down… there’s tons of stuff to put in there.\n\n“But people could go to one of these events and not have any idea who I was – which is totally cool – and still understand the stories, because they grew up in those times and have stories themselves, or if they’re younger it could be like watching an archaeological dig into a pop cultural past! Ha ha!”\n\nIt’s a fair point, that archaeological Time Team led by a lad from the Fylde coast who was there for a key part of our cultural history, overseeing Britpop. Madchester, the grunge scene and more, not least what was going on at the edge of Eastern Europe. You never had pretensions of being there in the first place, I’m thinking. How did that happen?\n\n“Yeah, you can’t really say that yourself, can you. You just do your thing. And I guess, in a way coming from a place like Blackpool, you could never be cool. You weren’t hanging around with Vivienne Westwood. You’re too far away. It doesn’t really matter what you get into, you just follow your instinct, and often I’ve got into things on that basis… like Nirvana, before the first single.”\n\nThat debut release being a 1988 cover of Dutch rockers Shocking Blue’s 1969 track ‘Love Buzz’, on Seattle indie label Sub Pop, made record of the week by Sounds, who’d already carried that first interview with John.\n\n“The few people that heard them were saying, ‘These are very good,’ and I’m going, ‘These are amazing!’ But I didn’t have any idea they were going to sell millions of records. They were just really great. It was more an instinctive thing.”\n\nHow do you look back on those Sounds days, and how long a spell was that?\n\n“About five years, and the great thing about Sounds was… if you were writing about a new band in the NME, you’d have to check their midweek chart position first, whereas in Sounds, you’d just write about them. They’d say, ‘We’re not always into what you write about, musically, but we’ll just let you write about it.’ For us freelancers, that’s what made it a really brilliant paper. And what’s the point of having a freelancer on your paper if you don’t trust what they write about?”\n\nRemind me how you got involved? I was – a few years later – this lad from the Surrey suburbs hoping to be spotted writing about indie bands for my Captains Log fanzine, London and South-East based. But in retrospect I wasn’t pushy enough to break into that world. I’m guessing there were mentors for you though that truly believed and pushed you, ultimately giving you that springboard.\n\n“I had the fanzine, but also wrote for ZigZag. The weird thing is that I had a bit of a fallout with James Brown, who I’d known since he was 14, this kid writing a fanzine. But to sort of make up, he got me into Sounds. But it’s not like being a proper journalist, being a music journalist. It’s not like you go for a job interview. You kind of stumble into it. And in the end, if you’re a massive music-head and can write a bit, you’ll be a music journalist. It was never a career option… that’s why it’s funny now – although a lot harder as there’s a lot less money – that people say it’s not a career option. It never was a career option! Ha ha! It was always a very chaotic existence.”\n\nDid you go straight from living in Blackpool to London, before settling in Manchester?\n\n“I never lived in London. I went to Manchester… and stayed. But I’ve always moved around, couch surfing and so on.”\n\nDo you think that, pre-punk days, the music papers would have entertained the idea of a writer living away from the capital?\n\n“Well, I write about music from all over the world. I don’t have geographical boundaries. Being based in Manchester, it’s an obvious thing to say now that it’s a huge music scene. But even then, it was a cool music scene, and I felt close to that because I already knew people there, and there was always lots to write about.”\n\nThe Art Of Darkness – The History of Goth has done really well. And not only have you written a mammoth book there, but you also put in the legwork to sell it, with lots of public events and so on.\n\n“You have to, really. Initially, it was self-released, because I fell out with about three publishers, as their idea of what the book should be about was different from mine. So I bought the book back off one of them, put it out itself. I had no idea how it was going to do. I thought, ‘If this flops, I’m going to lose quite a bit of money. But… then it went crazy, selling hand over foot, and I couldn’t keep up with it while I was on tour. Manchester University has a printing arm, though, and they took it over for me, because you don’t want to be on a train trying to get to the ferry for the Isle of Wight and trying to order 20 books for events. It’s so difficult. So they kind of took over, and it’s been a lot easier since, and just carried on selling. It’s way over 20,000 now. That’s a relief. Ha ha!\n\n“And I like touring, so that’s a plus. I know how to do it, being in a band for years. I can arrange my own tours. I don’t have to wait for a book company to get me three Waterstones events. I can go out there, get in touch with record shops, venues, anyone who’s got a space, up and down the country. If they can cover certain costs, we can do it, and loads of people are up for it.”\n\nIt’s great sharing those stories at public events too, isn’t it, as I’ve found out with my Clash and Slade events. And you really have very little idea of what tales will come your way in those situations.\n\n“Oh, I love that, and when I tour – all kinds of tours – I sit in with the merch. it’s nice when people buy stuff, because that keeps you going. But, you know what, it doesn’t really matter if they do – I just like to talk to people about music and stuff. My ideal gig – as well as sold out! – will be one where you get to chat to everybody who’s there, and hang out.”\n\nAt that point John mentions, by way of example, the second date of the tour, on March 23rd at Chorley Theatre, close to my patch.\n\n“I haven’t been to Chorley since 1983, when I played a gig there. A pub, by the town square. I’ve got photographs of the gig that someone sent me, and I remember it very clearly. Luckily for a writer, I’ve got a photographic memory.”\n\nChorley has never really been seen as on the circuit, despite the odd memorable show, such as The Fall at Tatton Community Centre, just across town, where the audience included members of James, something Jim Glennie told me all about in a past interview.\n\n“Well, the gig circuit was really ad hoc then. The venue campaign going on now is brilliant, and it’s really important. But I remember how ‘untogether’ gigs were in the ’80s, the person putting on the gig often younger than we were… probably not even allowed in the venue! Then they’d run out of money, collecting all the money, putting it in a plastic bag. It was super-DIY, wasn’t it. Ha ha!”\n\nThat grass roots image reminds me of you telling me about The Membranes playing upstairs at the Enterprise in Chalk Farm, London, on the evening of Live Aid in the Summer of ‘85, five weeks after my own visit to Dan Treacy’s Room at the Top happening there, catching That Petrol Emotion.\n\n“Yeah, the only gig in town on the night of Live Aid, about 200 people crammed into a room that should have held about 130! There was a bar downstairs, and a massive crack appeared in the roof, so the landlady came and told us off! Somebody sent me pictures of it.”\n\nI seem to recall from my own visit that the stage was no more than a step up from the crowd, the audience on the front row – the one in front of me – more or less linking arms to protect the band from stage invasions.\n\n“Yeah, it must have been about three inches high. I’ll have to look back at the photos! And I never actually saw Live Aid, because I was playing that night. It’s like opposite ends of pop culture, musically – there were the bands that played Live Aid, and they were the diagrammatic opposite of our world, really.\n\n“I’m not knocking it. I know Bob Geldof, he’s a good guy, and what he was doing was good. But as a piece of captivating entertainment, that’s different, isn’t it. Ha ha!”\n\nAnd I’m guessing no one offered to transport The Membranes on Concorde to the next gig.\n\n“Ha ha! No!”\n\nYou mentioned Chorley Theatre, a lovely venue that I know well, and there are lots on this tour that must jump out at you, such as the Music Room at Liverpool Philharmonic.\n\n“That’s a really nice space, and it’s a slightly different circuit than what I’d normally do, so a lot of these are new venues to me. There’s towns on this tour I’ve never been to, although I’ve been to nearly every town in Britain. I’m looking forward to going to places like Pocklington and Selby, which I’ve passed but never been in.\n\n“And when I go to any town on tour, we always look around, so there will be things about that town threaded into the talk. Like when we play in Norwich with the band, we go to this lookout tower, by the mediaeval walls, the Cow Tower. Every gig, I ask, ‘Anybody ever been to the Cow Tower?’ and people get really confused!”\n\nThat’s a late 14th century artillery blockhouse, pop kids. And talk of Norwich got me on to one of my favourite subjects, discussing various bands based there in the first half of the ’80s, chiefly The Farmer’s Boys, The Higsons, and Serious Drinking, and how there was supposedly no such scene until John Peel’s on-air patronage for those outfits created one.\n\n“Yeah, a made-up scene, but the bands were good enough to make it worth that label. They all had cool, really catchy songs, and if those bands were going now, they’d be going really well. It’s funny now, looking back at that post-punk period – all the bands were kind of pioneers, treated as outsiders. Now you hear bands doing really well in the indie mainstream, like Yard Act from Leeds – they’d have been the sort of band that supported us in 1984 – quite quirky, really good, about 100 people liking them; but on today’s scene, they’ve had a No.2 album!”\n\nWill you properly prepare for these live shows? Is there a framework you try to stick to? I can’t imagine you being too rigid on that. You’re more off the cuff, surely. I can’t imagine you getting lost in the headlights, but there must be moments when the mind goes blank.\n\n“It never goes blank. I’ve been told to have some kind of structure though! I’ll probably have a setlist and just move around that. But I can’t learn it. I know Henry Rollins quite well, and seen him do his thing loads of times, and thought he was quite off the cuff, but he learns the whole thing, one end to the other. That to me is really impressive – how do you learn two hours of stuff? Stewart Lee is the same. He’s brilliant, and I asked him the same and he said he kind of learns most of it, although he goes off on those tangents. I’m impressed with that. I’d rather stand there two hours, off the cuff. Nearly everyone goes, ‘Oh my God, how can you do that?’ But I find it much easier to do that than learn it! And I like to change it every night.\n\n“In Chorley, it’ll definitely have a Blackpool, Preston, Chorley and Lancashire line to it, but in Southampton I’d have a different version, alongside the main stories. It’ll be about the place I’m in, such as the music scene that came out of those towns and how those things connected with me. “And there will be two halves some nights, the first half my talk and the second half me in conversation with somebody then a Q&A with the audience, which is great – people could be asking me completely random stuff!”\n\nAt this point I suggest he gets local lad John Foxx along for an ‘in conversation’ at Chorley, letting on about Phil Cool getting in touch with me after I interviewed John, giving his side of a story that connected them in their school days.\n\n“There are some weird crossovers, aren’t there! Like with Blackpool’s music scene. Jethro Tull went to my school, way before me, and when I interviewed Lemmy once, who also lived in Blackpool at one stage, I asked, ‘Did you ever meet Ian Anderson?’ And he said, ‘I didn’t know him that well, but yeah, I sold him my guitar… I wished I’d kept it!’ So when I interviewed Ian, I asked, ‘Did you buy a guitar off Lemmy?’ And he said yeah, remembering what he paid for it and everything. They both knew Roy Harper as well. He used to shout poetry at seagulls, and everyone was a bit scared of him! You wouldn’t think of those three being on the same time zone, but sometimes, in a very small town…\n\n“And yet David Ball from Soft Cell and Chris Lowe from the Pet Shop Boys went to the same Blackpool school, and were one year apart, but never met each other.”\n\nAnd what’s next for you, writing-wise, beyond the autobiography?\n\n“I’m collating it now, putting little stories down, but I’m also writing a children’s book… kind of not for children! I wrote it in the pandemic, and about a month ago went back to it, thinking ‘This is actually pretty good!’ It’s about England… mythical England, it’s about nature, it’s pretty trippy, but kind of works as a book. It’s got Pan in there, running around Lancashire. It’s not going to be a bestseller, but someone who read it said it’s really evocative about nature. And because I still own my little book company, I thought I might put out a limited edition.\n\n“I’m also still working on this green education project with Dale Vince, helping create green jobs. We’ve got the courses together now, so that’s closer to a launch point. There are so many projects going on, including a zero carbon project in Blackpool.\n\n“I’ve said for some time that one thing Blackpool really needs is a university. Now they’re actually going to open a branch of Lancaster University in Blackpool, which is great. But I still think Blackpool needs it own university. Coming from around there you notice how snobby people really are about that. The university in Preston {UCLan} has done wonders for that area, it’s got a whole other vibe in the city centre, which you wouldn’t normally have.\n\n“I went to Stafford Poly, which became Staffordshire University, in Stoke now. I went back a couple of years ago, and they gave me a doctorate. I only ever went to one lecture and got thrown out, but now I’ve finally got my degree, after 41 years!\n\n“The weird thing is that Dale Vince went there at the same time. When I helped write his book for him, he told me he went to this ‘really boring polytechnic in the Midlands.’ Turns out it was the same one… and the same year! He obviously went to as few lectures as I did. We never met each other.\n\n“Meanwhile, Blackpool wants me to be one of five representatives for a project in the House of Lords next month. That will be really cool. I’ve loads of ideas for all that. I don’t know how it’s supposed to work, how they choose where universities should be. But maybe we just need to cut the crap and make this all happen.\n\n“I mean, why’s Blackpool not a city? I was in Brighton over the weekend, and it’s great, but it isn’t massively bigger than Blackpool. It’s going for city status too, but they won’t have it. Again, it’s snobbery. Living in Manchester now, I find every normal person loves Blackpool. And people like Ian Brown say, ‘You were so lucky growing up in Blackpool.’ They still go for day-trips.”\n\nAnd while I’m on, I’ll mention how much I enjoyed my first visit to Louder Than Words last November. It was great to see Slade legend Don Powell, and there was a real buzz about the place. I just wished I had the time to fit in a few more events. Maybe next time.\n\n“Ah, you should. And maybe we need Don back again too. We’d love that. Everyone loves him, and he loves going.”\n\nFor past feature-interviews with John Robb on this website, follow these links:\n\nJourney to the Art of Darkness – talking The History of Goth with John Robb (Feb 25, 2023)\n\nOn the frontline, embracing the future – putting the world to rights with John Robb (Jul 9, 2021)\n\nFylde under nature – talking The Membranes’ new record and much more with John Robb (Jun 5, 2019)\n\nTripping the dark fantastic with The Membranes – in conversation with John Robb (Dec 1, 2016)\n\nJohn Robb’s Do You Believe in the Power of Rock ‘n’ Roll UK tour 2024 dates: March – 22 Selby Town Hall; 23 Chorley Theatre; 27 Kendal Brewery Arts; 28 Sale Waterside; 29 Halifax Square Chapel.

Donegal.’\n\n“Yeah, most of the album is very introspective, looking back, and the music suits the mood, I think, especially on that – that’s one of the standout tracks. It builds and builds and has this lovely feel about it, this nostalgic look back to when we were kids, staying in this little green hut. Lovely memories.”\n\nLegendary Jam drummer Rick Buckler, following the publication of The Jam 1982, co-written with Zoe Howe, regarding the affinity the Woking three-piece had with their devoted fanbase\n\n‘A lot of that came from the very early days when we were playing the clubs. A lot of people twigged that if they got there in the afternoon, especially London shows and pubs, we’d be doing soundchecks at about three or four o’clock. They’d come along, get stuff signed, and just talk to us.\n\n‘This was prior to us getting signed. And the first thing we did with the record company was sort a tour, which involved only London – the Red Cow, the Nashville, the Marquee, those sorts of places. John {Weller} wasn’t particularly keen on it. But it was something we did and carried on through to playing the larger shows.’\n\nSinger-songwriter Sam Brown on how 2023 album Number 8 required a little thinking outside the (voice) box, mid-lockdown, alongside long-time friend/co-writer Danny Schogger\n\n‘When I began experiencing difficulties with my voice, I started on a rigorous pursuit of answers. I worked with top voice trainers, here and in America. I saw reputed voice doctors, did speech therapy, hypnotherapy, therapy, therapy! Yoga, acupuncture, nutrition, crystal healing …\n\n‘Nothing changed my inability to achieve pitch and closure simultaneously. A fundamental problem. Along with my voice, my creative impetus also disappeared. I didn’t play anything or write anything. I didn’t want to. It was upsetting, to say the least.\n\n‘Long story short, we tried, and we did. It wasn’t an easy thing to do, and there were tears. Danny was amazingly patient, and we ended up with an album’s worth of tracks, the recording a wonderful revelation, all done on Skype and Zoom. Danny did most of the instrumental side of things in his home, I worked at home with my Melodyne programme, allowing me to sing something in any pitch then move it to where I wanted it … and tune it – essential!\n\n‘It also meant I could add harmonies, double-tracking, etc. My brother Pete came on board at the mixing stage, fine-tuning what I’d done already. The end-result? Like nothing I’ve ever done before. In short, it’s all fake!’\n\nFebruary\n\nFormer Roachford frontman turned long-established solo artist Andrew Roachford, who also features with Mike + the Mechanics, on whether he still gets nervous before live engagements, and if he reckons such nerves are essential\n\n‘Ah, always. Especially the first date. Even if you haven’t done it for a month or something, you still feel there’s a bit of rust and wonder, ‘How’s this gonna go down?’ It’s a weird thing that you get into this head trip, but I can’t remember many bad gigs, so I don’t know where that’s all coming from, because it always works out. But I think some artists say it’s because you care, and you want it to be the best.\n\n‘I grew up listening to really great live performers and really appreciate a good live gig. I don’t want, you know, lukewarm – people going, ‘Oh, it was okay.’ It doesn’t work that way for me. I’m looking to have people leave there completely blown away and lifted. It’s quite a pressure I put on my own shoulders.’\n\nGraham Gouldman, touring with his Heart Full of Songs show in 2023, on Jeff Beck, the songwriting legend and former 10cc star having first met the guitar hero – who died in January 2023 – and The Yardbirds, just after they recorded his song, ‘Heart Full of Soul’, in 1965. Jeff went on to record another of his songs, ‘Tallyman’, in 1967\n\n‘I never really hung out with them. I was introduced to them by their manager, Giorgio Gomelsky. They were very nice and everything, but it was never like, ‘Let’s have a drink together.’ I’m not being detrimental to them. I was quite a shy boy anyway. They were very nice, and I’m eternally grateful to them, because they recorded my songs. And also because Jeff recorded ‘Tallyman’, so I’m really proud to have had an association with them and with him in particular. Like many others who have said it because of his untimely passing, he was quite simply the greatest guitarist in the world.\n\n‘There’s no one that plays like him. I’ve worked with some of the greatest guitarists in the world. Most recently, Brian May, doing a record with him. He is a phenomenal guitar player but he himself acknowledges the fact that Beck is the greatest.’\n\nKent-based solo artist Marlody, discussing some of the darker subject matter on her stunning 2023 debut LP, I’m Not Sure At All\n\n‘I wrote most of it when I was in the process of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a very tumultuous time for me, when going to sing and play piano was kind of like my therapy, really.\n\n‘I never wrote the songs with the idea of sharing them, they were just for me. This was other people’s suggestions that I thought, okay, put them into the world. The only one I wrote with other people in mind was ‘Friends in Low Places’. I was doing a spark therapy group as part of my trying to get through my depression. And there were these people that I met there, some really struggling with loneliness and stuff. I wrote that song kind of thinking I would share it with them, but then I was too shy. But now I’ve put it out into the world, more people are going to hear it than the eight people that are in the group!’\n\nLouder Than War supremo and Membranes/Goldblade frontman John Robb, on the subject of 650-page epic read, The Art of Darkness: The History of Goth, in which he concludes ‘goth is in rude health’\n\n‘The art of darkness is all around us, reacting to the dystopian like it always has. Every generation is still dealing with its blues.\n\n‘Culture blur continues – where it was once easy to stand out in the crowd, provocative clothing has become normalised, and those without tattooed skin are the exception. Piercings fall in and out of fashion and are no longer the signifiers of alternative culture. Black clothes are just another Friday night option, and skulls adorn everything from school bags to cereal packets. The dark side has become cartoon fun instead of a badge of the underground.\n\n‘Yet beyond the mainstream’s meddling and cynical appropriation of the surface of a darkly attractive form, the post-punk alternative’s dark matter and energy are everywhere. Thankfully, the new dark ages still require a fitting soundtrack and the art of darkness is the only modern art that truly defines these dystopian end times.’\n\nMarch\n\nSteve Brookes, co-founder of The Jam, who saw plenty of praise for 2021 LP Tread Gently, on how – despite 45-plus years as a solo singer-songwriter – he’s still remembered for that early role, despite leaving the band in 1975, before they properly took off\n\n‘I still get that, especially if I do a gig around Woking, these people that come out of the woodwork. People you’ve never met in your life come up to you and have these recollections of things {they feel} you were at that they were. They talk to you about it, and you think, ‘You know what, mate, I wasn’t there. You’ve got it all wrong. That was two years after I left the band, and you’re telling me you remember me doing something.’ But I don’t bother correcting them. It’s just too complicated. I’ll just say, ‘Yeah, you’re probably right,’ or ‘I don’t remember that, but you’re probably right,’ let them carry on!’\n\nEighties synth-pop icon Nik Kershaw, who now has nine solo albums behind him and continues to tour frequently, describing himself as a late developer, having first picked up a guitar when he was 15, inspired by a small screen feature on David Bowie just after the Ziggy Stardust era\n\n‘I was just getting into music when I saw a documentary on Nationwide, which was like The One Show in the ’70s. It was literally a 20-minute documentary piece about Bowie on tour. He must have already released the Aladdin Sane album because he was doing songs from that. That would have been my first {Bowie} album, then I went back to Ziggy and Hunky Dory and all that.\n\n‘I always wanted to be the centre of attention, and thought, ‘I want to be a famous racing driver’, ‘I want to be a famous footballer’, ‘I want to be a famous actor’ … Then Bowie came along, and it was, ‘I want to be a famous performer, singer-songwriter, whatever.’ Then a mate got an electric guitar and I used to go around his and every Sunday afternoon and he’d pretend he was Marc Bolan and I’d pretend I was Bowie, and we just sort of made a lot of noise together.\n\n‘Then I got my first guitar and locked myself in my room, slowing down Ritchie Blackmore solos.’\n\nNigel Clark, busy as a solo artist and with Dodgy in 2023, on joining forces with bandmate and Dodgy co-founder Mathew Priest back in the late ‘80s\n\n‘I answered an advert in a local paper, looking for a singer. I was just starting out, musically. I’d been doing it quite a few years, recording demos, and thought it was about time I got a band. I met Mathew that way, he was the drummer in the band, and we decided after about a year that we were really serious about it.\n\n‘I went to America, travelling, came back and decided I was either going to live in New York or London. And he said, ‘I’ll come.’ So we did it together, which was brilliant. It would have been difficult on my own. I tried to always be Mr Overconfident, saying, ‘I’m going’ but it was a lot better and easier that I had someone with me.\n\n‘When we first moved down in 1988, we lived in Battersea, and as someone into punk, the soundtrack to our first year in London was The Story of The Clash. Mathew knew The Jam more, so I kind of influenced him there. Then his mum and dad went travelling and we sort of inherited their records, which is when I got into Sly and the Family Stone, in a big way. I still think they’re probably the greatest band ever.\n\n‘We were DJs as well. We bought a set-up and would go around colleges and places like that. So we knew what we liked, were vivacious in the music we wanted to listen to, and took on everything. There were things going on – techno, baggy, all that, but we were consuming Simon and Garfunkel, The Beach Boys, then The Beastie Boys, Neil Young. And when we first heard Crosby, Stills Nash and Young, that was it. I love harmony. I don’t think anything’s complete if you can’t sing a harmony. I listen to a lot of Townes Van Zandt these days, always sing harmony to him, thinking, ‘If I knew him …’\n\nStranglers frontman turned solo artist Hugh Cornwell, out and about with his band in 2023, on his current winning three-piece formula, alongside bass player Pat Hughes and drummer Windsor McGilvray, both lecturers at the ACM, Guildford, a stone’s throw from where The Stranglers formed\n\n‘They’re very gifted, and between us we’ve managed to cover the keyboards option, because I don’t want to take keyboards with me on the road. What I’ve discovered is that because they’ve got such great voices, you can actually summon up a lot of the extra instruments from that, which is really nice. And on some of the old Stranglers songs – we can recreate them using the voices to supplement the guitars and bass, so there’s not so much missing as people would imagine.’\n\nApril\n\nGo-to session brass player Terry Edwards on how important John Peel was to the cause with his breakthrough funk-punk outfit, The Higsons – who released Run Me Down – The Complete 2 Tone Recordings on limited-edition black vinyl in 2023 – fronted by The Fast Show co-creator turned author Charlie Higson, the legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ suggesting a Norwich scene that wasn’t really there until he mentioned it on air\n\n‘Colin {Williams} heard him on the radio saying he lived in East Anglia and there didn’t seem to be any bands around there doing anything. So he wrote in and said, ‘We’re The Higsons, we’re supporting The Fall next week, if you want to come.’ We’d just done our very first demo. He said he couldn’t come to that, but he’d come to whatever the next one was, and we gave him a cassette of five tracks we’d done to eight-track, one of which was ‘I Don’t Want to Live with Monkeys’. He gave us a session on the back of that, out just before two of its tracks came out on a local compilation album {Norwich: A Fine City}.’\n\nIan Lynch on the Mercury Prize-shortlist nominated False Lankum, which won Lankum huge critical acclaim in 2023 and ended up on many end-of-year favourites’ lists, this scribe suggesting the exquisite ‘Clear Away in the Morning’ has elements of Richard and Linda Thompson style folk\n\n‘The way we understand it, or the way we see it, is that we wouldn’t really call the music we make folk. The term isn’t used as much in Ireland anyway, but even traditional … we all know what traditional music is, and all know that what we make is not traditional music.\n\n‘It’s obviously one strong element of what we do, but amongst many other things. But maybe it’s easier to let other people define and analyse to what degree those things are there. We just like making the music, we don’t try and pass all that down, you know.’\n\nIan’s bandmate Radie Peat, in the same interview, asked what she heard on Jean Ritchie’s 1963 take on ‘Go Dig My Grave’ that made her think it could work for Lankum\n\n‘I just loved that song. I didn’t think it was going to work as a Lankum song for years, but I was tinkering with it, thought it would probably go on a solo album, then it just kind of floated up into my memory or my head or whatever, when we were getting together the material for this album.\n\n‘Hearing the kind of stuff we were writing, I thought it would bring another element to it. It was very obvious it would fit, and it was really easy that day, trying to figure out what to do with it. It came together really fast. Sometimes that happens. Sometimes it’s fast, sometimes it’s really obvious which songs are the right ones, and sometimes it’s not. You just have to work them all, see what jumps out.’\n\nThe iconic Pauline Black, of The Selecter, who brought us the splendid Human Algebra in 2023, on her long-time friendship with fellow 2 Tone star and sometime tour mate Rhoda Dakar, who won acclaim with her solo LP\n\n‘We are good friends, and she’s an artist in her own right. It doesn’t serve either of us any good just to be lumped together as the women of 2 Tone, and yet people want to do that to us, so we rail against that. I can’t wait for her new album, Version Girl, to be out, because she’s really got the bit between her teeth at the moment.\n\n‘We’ve learned from each other over the years, we’ve learned the pitfalls and we’ve learned how you negotiate everything, because everything was still skewed to a white male kind of musical fraternity. But you make your way in it. And we of course, have the music, which, if you’re dealing with more political or more social things, then we are in the firing line, if you know what I mean. It would be easier to pick us off than it would be, say, the late Terry Hall, or Suggsy, for instance.\n\n‘When you have consistently been there, and really upholding, I think, those twin desires of what 2 Tone was supposed to be about – an anti-racist and an anti-sexist stance … So all power to her, and I think it’s absolutely wonderful that ladies, you know – ha ha! – of a certain age can be doing this.’\n\nMay\n\nMusical archaeologist/vintage audio collector and Deeply Vale Festival creator Chris Hewitt explaining the premise behind his The Development of Large Rock Sound Systems book trilogy\n\n‘When I first wrote, collated and published Volume 1 in 2020 it was to try and record the history of the PA industry and the companies that grew up as the demand for larger sound systems for larger festivals and larger indoor gigs increased.\n\n‘Volume 2 was released to celebrate 50 years since the Pink Floyd at Pompeii film, which must have inspired many musicians and sound engineers to want to build a large sound system. By then I was researching chapters on particular companies in the pro audio industry and on particular vintage PA systems like the Led Zeppelin and the Pink Floyd Pompeii WEM systems.\n\n‘Working on the Pistols’ Disney TV series recreations of classic Sex Pistols gigs in 2021 with various PAs brought me into researching Bowie/Ziggy and Ground Control at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1973, as that system had to be recreated for the film, so that led to the Bowie/Ground Control/Turner chapters.\n\n‘When PA systems first started being toured as hire systems and used for festivals, it was an industry of mavericks, often described by people who were doing it as pirates setting sail on a ship and not really knowing where they were going. Hire companies and manufacturers came and went or got taken over, bought out and reinvented. Sometimes the hire companies were set up by bands wanting to get their equipment used when not on the road, like Colac Hire (Colosseum) and Britannia Row (Pink Floyd).\n\n‘It usually started with someone building some bass bins and horns in their garage or building a mixer in their garden shed, and developed from there.”\n\nJune\n\nDave Wakeling, touring again with The Beat in 2023, on how he and sorely missed co-frontman Ranking Roger supported Queen on The Works tour in 1984 with their other major band project, General Public, whose first two LPs were reissued on vinyl this year\n\n‘Oh, my heavens! We were thinking it was the Queen that had just done the song with David Bowie, kind of hip and dancy, so thought, ‘It’s a stretch but should be alright.’ But for the live show it was very much the heavy metal fans’ ‘let’s pretend he’s not gay’ show, which always stunned me. So we didn’t really go down that well. I think we went down a bit better in Dublin than other places, but even Birmingham was tough work.\n\n‘At the end of the English run, I said, ‘We really can’t do any more, we’re going down terrible, they’re shouting at us, we’re not even doing our job warming the crowd up, because we’re not their flavour. I said I didn’t want to do the European part of the tour… and we didn’t – we got fired by the agency instead, U2’s agents too. I think it had been done as a favour, some bloke at Virgin was the brother-in-law of the drummer of Queen, although it didn’t really fit together and everybody knew that. But when the obvious became obvious and people were waving ‘fuck off’ fingers at us, I did what I thought was the decent thing, and I’m afraid we got punished for the favour.’\n\nSteve Harley, who ended the year revealing his ongoing battle with cancer, talking about 2020 LP, Uncovered, and his fresh take on 1976’s ‘(Love) Compared To You’, complete with poignant third verse\n\n‘Yes, the third verse at last! Ha! We went to Rockfield {Studios, South Wales} to record that, and it’s just strings – guitars, violin, viola, double bass, and a string quartet. No keyboards at all, no electric notes. And that’s how I’m touring, plugging this album, playing four or five songs from it. And the songs evolve, they develop, it’s really thrilling, and the band are such great players.\n\n‘It’s funny how the muse comes and sits on your shoulder for inspiration. You can wait years. And with that third verse, I’d been trying to write it for many, many years, and then I was down at Rockfield in the sunshine at the beginning of July 2019, and I went out into the meadow. My dad died two weeks earlier, and he was being cremated at 8.30 in Bury St Edmunds, about 250 miles from where I was. I was in the meadow while someone was cooking breakfast, looking at the horses and the trees and just enjoying nature, thinking about my dad.\n\n‘And when I walked back in at nine o’clock I said to my engineer and friend Matt Butler, who had been hassling me to write it, ‘I’ve got it. I’ve done it. What do you think of this?’ And he just said, ‘Spot on, well done.’ Very weird. My dad was passing through, yeah.\n\n‘It needed a third verse. It was a bit of a cheap shot, just two verses and repeating one of them. What happened there?’\n\nStyle Council co-founder Mick Talbot, who has also featured with Dexys Midnight Runners and more recently guested with Stone Foundation, reminiscing about his music roots\n\n‘We lived with my Nan and she played the piano. It was always essential to her. I remember, when we moved, she was a bit upset we couldn’t take the piano with us. We’d only been in this new place for a matter of days and a piano arrived, hired. She just felt every house should have one – more essential than hot water or central heating! I guess in her childhood that may have been, pre-telly and radio, the most compelling form of entertainment in the room.\n\n‘She’d play by ear and I asked her to show me some things. She tried to, but said that because that was just from instinct, ‘I don’t know how much more I can show you.’ So she got me piano lessons. I didn’t really like the idea of that. I just went ‘no, I like it when it’s just magic.’\n\n‘I could play a little bit by ear, but I did go to lessons for two or three years. It always felt like an interference to me. I was more focused on playing football than going to lessons, but most of it went in… so I’m a bit of a mixture, really.\n\n‘We were in Tooting when we left the old piano behind, about three stops up the Northern Line. My mum listened to the pirate stations in the ‘60s, because they were playing the most soul, I suppose. She liked Tamla and all that.’\n\nFormer Carter USM frontman Jim Bob, an established solo artist for a quarter of a century now, on ‘The Prince of Wales’, the closing track of winning 2023 LP, Thanks for Reaching Out, after I suggested it carries elements of The Clash’s ‘Stay Free’\n\n‘Yeah, and ‘Stay Free’ is another good example of that kind of song. But I was thinking of ‘Kooks’ and that idea that, ‘It doesn’t matter what happens, we’ve got each other.’ I always liked that, Bowie telling his kid, ‘If it comes to, we’ll just leave, we’ll walk. If you don’t like school, you can just leave. We’ll just set fire to the books,’ that sort of thing. In an adult way, if you’re having a bad day, it’s, ‘Let’s just go for a drink, forget about it for a bit.’\n\nDo you see this as part three of an album trilogy that opened with 2020’s Pop Up Jim Bob?\n\n“I think so. Because I’ve said that a few times, I’ve started to believe that’s the case. I don’t know how I’ll follow it. I can’t just do another exactly the same. I said this to someone the other day and said it more as a tongue-in-cheek thing, but it sounds sort of arrogant – if Pop Up Jim Bob was Ziggy Stardust and the second one was Aladdin Sane, this one’s Diamond Dogs… and then it’s Young Americans.’\n\nJuly\n\nThe Nightingales drummer, co-writer, co-vocalist and tour manager Fliss Kitson, on how she first met Robert Lloyd, while performing alongside Cheri Amour in Norwich indie outfit Violet Violet\n\n‘That was amazing, some of the best times ever. We were at sixth form and there was a battle of the bands’ competition. There were some boys that started a band to take part in it and we wanted to just beat the boys, so we started a band.\n\n‘I was already having drum lessons, and a couple of my friends started to play the bass and guitar and stuff. We didn’t really know what we were doing. We were just having lots of fun. We didn’t win, but we did beat the boys! And we decided to carry on.\n\n‘Some of the girls weren’t as passionate about it or didn’t want to spend that much time making music. They had other stuff they wanted to do. They went off and it was kind of me and Cheri, and we carried on. We had an amazing time… and that’s how I met The Nightingales. We got to support them and travelled around Europe and America and the UK with the ‘Gales. It was so much fun. We just loved it.’\n\nAugust\n\nVeteran singer-songwriter Wreckless Eric, making great music 46 years after debut single, ‘Whole Wide World’, on the release of 2023’s Leisureland, which I suggested captures a seaside feel and sense of Englishness, not just with a Beatles, Kinks and Who vibe, but also incorporating a little David Essex in That’ll Be the Day spirit\n\n‘Oh, that’s a very underrated film, an incredible document from that time. You know, you can’t find it anywhere anymore. I thought that was a great film. That was the generation just before mine, but there are so many overlaps. I could relate to it – that post-war austerity was still lingering when I was growing up. But I didn’t want {this album} to be nostalgic. It is contemporary, I think.\n\n‘My viewpoint is contemporary. I mean, the seaside is a fantastic thing. You have these places, and they have a grimy, darker side which is like, what you see is people enjoying themselves, middle-aged men taking their shirts off, their wives thinking, ‘You can carry this off, Mick!’ and they’re going, ‘Yeah, I can. I’ve taken my shirt off. Deal with it!’ I miss that kind of belligerence of the British holidaymaker.\n\n‘But most people are really nice, and there’s something really sweet about people being on holiday and having a great time. You see all that, but behind there’s a whole world of everyday life. There’s seasonal employment, there’s minimum wage employment, there’s a lack of decent places for people to live because everywhere’s rented out for holiday accommodation and the odious AirBnB. And what you get with that is drug problems, and you get a town like Great Yarmouth.\n\n‘Y’know, when everyone was going abroad for their holidays, those towns got incredibly run down, so you get asylum seekers there. ‘We’ll put them where nobody else wants to go.’ And it builds this hell on earth sometimes. It’s a strange dichotomy – on one hand you’ve got this jollity and joyful seaside experience, then you’ve got this awful, dark, other side to it. And to me, the thing that would really sum it up is the stagnant boating lake. They’ve actually filled in the stagnant boating lake in Cromer, made it into a crazy golf {course}.’\n\nSeptember\n\nSlade drumming legend Don Powell, in an interview for the final chapter of Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade, on the band’s ‘wilderness years’ – returning from a long spell in America in ’77 and finding themselves at rock bottom, most of their audience having moved on, the loyalty of those who stuck by them seeing them through to a triumphant 1980 Reading Festival rebirth\n\n‘I tell you what, Malc, it never deterred us. We were still giving them the same show. We were down in the dumps, and it was hard to get gigs, so we started doing those particular kinds of clubs. But we wanted to work, and still wanted to play shows. That was it, really. And it wasn’t until the Reading Festival {1980} came up that…\n\n‘I remember Nod calling me. We hadn’t worked together for a couple of months, I think, but he told me we’d been offered Reading Festival, and we were killing ourselves laughing over the phone! But we felt we’d got nothing to lose. We got our gear together, with our equipment in the school room where we used to rehearse in Wolverhampton – just a classroom in a disused school. It was the local vicar who ran it, loaning the classrooms out for bands to rehearse in. I think it was about £4 or £5. We called him Holy Joe. He’d get his fiver, then he’d be up the pub on the corner, about 50 yards away. If you needed him to lock up, you’d find him in the pub!\n\n‘That’s what we did when we were offered Reading. We just had a couple of rehearsals. And we’didn’t really have any passes. We were walking through with the punters, everyone saying, ‘What are you lot doing here?’ And we said, ‘Well, we’re playing tonight!’”\n\nOctober\n\nUndertones drummer Billy Doherty on how the band’s homesickness for Derry back in the day may have cost them in the long term\n\n‘Well, I was bad, but John {O’Neill} was even worse – he was on another planet, really extreme. But I would say there was – particularly with me, John, and maybe to some point Mickey – always a reluctance to do it. But unfortunately, I left it too late to realise – and this is going back to 1981 – it is a business.\n\n‘When the band got a {new} record deal and we signed to EMI, I decided I was leaving the band. I went over to England but didn’t go to the signing of the record deal with EMI – which was a really, really good deal. Then I realised I’d made a dreadful mistake, phoned the hotel where the signing was being done to try to speak to my manager, and said to Andy {Ferguson}, ‘I want back in the band.’ He was livid. He said, ‘Billy, do you realise we’re signing a contract here? You’ve left the band, now you want to get back in?’ It got really silly. Anyway, thankfully they allowed me back in again, and the rest is history.\n\n‘Unfortunately, I found the whole kind of rock ‘n’ roll thing… I don’t sit well with it. I find it very uncomfortable. I realised you’ve got to tour and all that, and thankfully – now we’ve got bus passes and some of us are drawing down on the pension – we are exceptionally lucky that we get great support at shows. And I’m really humbled by it. It’s terrific.’\n\nDanie Cox and Wendy Solomon, aka Gobby Holder and Jem Lea of treasured all-female tribute Slady on their raison d’etre, from another interview for Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade\n\nDanie: ‘We do this entirely for the fans. That and the fun of it all. It’s really a truly special feeling being onstage in front of hundreds of people who have all come together in one room to celebrate their love of Slade. Seeing men and women of all ages, screaming out those songs, some even crying. Knowing that I’ve brought a special memory to people’s lives, as a vessel of the Slade experience. We don’t get critics at all really. We get the odd sexist comment or envious swipes, but that’s expected. We can’t make everyone as happy as we are.’\n\nWendy: ‘I agree it’s really special. It’s often about nostalgia for the fans, just capturing an essence of their youth through the songs, the atmosphere, the friends in the crowd. It’s pretty emotional at times and there is a real sense of poignancy underneath the joyous craziness of it all. The doubters are few and far between… and very lonely and sad…’\n\nPerformance poet and Slade’s own poet laureate, Paul Cookson, again for Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade, on his Lancashire village roots and how that impeded bids to see his favourite band for a few years\n\n‘Being in Walmer Bridge, growing up … when you’re 12 or 13 and from a Methodist church family, none of us took the bus into town to gigs until we were 16 or 17. We’d be playing football and stuff like that. So the only time we were aware of them was on Top of the Pops, or Crackerjack, or Runaround, or Supersonic, or Lift Off with Ayshea. Or as guests on The Bay City Rollers’ show, with the Arrows, or whatever. Because there was nothing on telly, you’d watch every music programme.\n\n‘The thing is, people today think we all dressed like them on Top of the Pops, but we were in browns and yellows. You couldn’t afford the clothing. I had a brown tank top with four stripes, which I thought was very glam, but I looked more like a liquorice allsort… and the fat one that you don’t like eating!\n\n‘I saw them at a big disco place at Liverpool. Oscar’s, 1979. The stage wasn’t even 3ft high. A glitterball disco. They hadn’t yet come back into fashion. ‘We’ll Bring the House Down’ hadn’t come out, and they hadn’t done Reading {Festival}, but some of those songs they played at Reading [August 1980} they played that night, and there were loads of skinheads there, because they always had that following. The girl I was with had this handbag and they were sat around it, so I was a bit nervous, but then they were real gentlemen and said, ‘Here y’are, love!’ and handed it back.\n\n‘I remember them playing ‘Wheels Ain’t Coming Down’. There was loads of dry ice, then they suddenly stopped, as there were two skinheads knocking seven bells out of each other. Noddy said, ‘Will you effin’ stop your effin’ fighting! We’re have to have effin’ fun, for eff’s sake!’ So these two guys stopped, and he said, ‘Right, we’ll effin’ carry on! One-two-three …’ Ha!\n\n‘That was my first time. I was at college at Edge Hill in Ormskirk, and they played Liverpool once or twice over the next couple of years. And I once missed Noddy going into a record shop in Ormskirk, when that EP, ‘Six of the Best’ came out {1980}.\n\n‘I remember walking into Ormskirk, and on the way back I looked in the record shop, having gone a different way into town, and it said, ‘Noddy Holder,’ written on cardboard, ‘appearing at 10 o’clock today.’ And it was 12 o’clock, and he’d gone! I thought that might be my last chance, but I’ve met him several times since…’\n\nNovember\n\nVeteran guitarist Andy Scott, who joined Sweet in 1970, at the beginning of their hitmaking run, the sole survivor from the classic four-piece, on his continued passion for songwriting and performing\n\n‘The older you get, as a record producer… Well, I’m such a bad editor. When I say bad, I mean… if I don’t think an idea is anywhere near where it should be, it gets ditched straight away. So you have these moments where you spring up in the middle of the night and you write down some lyrics or you patter down to the studio area – which is on a gallery, because I live in a barn – and I pick up an acoustic guitar and hopefully record it on the phone before it goes completely.\n\n‘In your dreams, the song’s magnificent. ‘Fox on the Run’ was one of those. It was my friend Kevin who found the original demo. He goes through my cassettes and stuff, where I’m almost whispering and just chunking the acoustic guitar. I wrote that one when living in a house near Heathrow Airport. I woke up in the middle of the night and didn’t want to wake my fairly new-born son and first wife, so I’m going {Andy whispers}, ‘I – I – I don’t want to know your name…’’\n\nLegendary music photographer Gered Mankowitz on Christmas parties at his West London studio, with Slade frequent flyers, in another interview for Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade\n\n‘When we had the studio in Great Windmill Street {Soho, pretty much throughout the ’70s, they’d come several times a year. We’d have a big Christmas party there. I’d cook a turkey and a ton of sausages, and we’d make a huge punch, famous for being an absolute killer punch. You had absolutely great sounds, and we invited people from all walks of life, and we’d invite Slade and their roadies, particularly Swinn {Graham Swinnerton}.\n\n‘They arrived, one year, were almost the first there, and I’m at the door welcoming people, saying, ‘Great to see you, go right through, there’s food over there.’ After about 20 minutes, I managed to escape the door, went inside, and the turkey had gone, the sausages had gone, and Slade and the roadies were just sitting around. ‘Great grub!’ They cleaned us out in 20 minutes!’\n\nNeil Sheasby, co-founder and bass player of Stone Foundation, whose tour diary, Bass Notes, was published to acclaim in 2023, on how – amid the 100% effort, drive and determination needed to break the band – an element of luck or fate was needed, in their case a chance meeting at a gig in Camden with Specials drummer John Bradbury, who invited the band on tour.\n\n‘Good luck, fortune, yeah, and that night particularly. These were the early days of the internet and he was just searching, under the pretence it was going to be a Northern Soul night he was starting in London. And he probably did have that in mind. But he walked in, and it was just fortune that the night he had off – and he lived up the road from the Fiddler’s Elbow – we were playing and were the first thing that came up on his search. And in his mind what he really wanted was one of the choices for the support for the tour. He wanted a soul band rather than a ska band. And there we were.\n\n‘My default setting was JB’s Allstars, rather than The Specials, so I was asking how Bill Hurley and Drew Barfield were and what they were up to. He was like, ‘Fucking hell, you remember all that?’ We just kind of bonded, y’know. Common ground, and thankfully we did our thing and he got it. It all unfolded and transpired that this was what he wanted to do, take us out, and that changed everything. For example, we’d never really played Scotland before, yet there we were at the SECC, and then could go back to Glasgow and sell something like King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut.\n\n‘All of a sudden, 10% to 20% of that crowd is going to get what you do. We’re forever thankful for that. Everyone focuses on the {Paul} Weller thing now, but that was a big full circle for me as well, from being a kid. Lynval {Golding} came into the dressing room, and I told him I was at the Rock against Racism gig they played with The Bureau at the Butts. He said, ‘God, man, we done it for the kids like you!’ It steers your path, really – your consciousness of racism or political stance. It influences you. That was 2011, but even at the time was, ‘Bloody hell, that’s mad!”\n\nDaryl Easlea on the lesser-known stories he was keen to explore in Whatever Happened to Slade? When the Whole World Went Crazee, not least the Black Country four-piece’s late ‘60s emergence on the London scene, with the Gunnell brothers then Chas Chandler managing\n\n‘As you know, they were sort of removed from the scene, but there was an association, you know – all the people Chas brought with him were the cream of the London scene. And if I hadn’t made contact with these people over the years… Chris O’Donnell is incredible, a sort of secret weapon. He went on to become Thin Lizzy’s manager, but started with the Gunnells and is still working now, at Live Nation. Such knowledge, and a lovely bloke.\n\n‘When you join all that up, it’s like, ‘So that’s why the Gonzalez horn section was used!’ {on Slade in Flame} – because of the connection Chas had to know them and get them in. For me, finding out Steve Gregory played the flute on ‘How Does It Feel’…!\n\n‘I looked at all the other books and referenced the work, making sure the crediting was there – the work Chris Selby’s done, that Dave Kemp did, and that amazing detail out there. But then {it’s about} bringing the bits to life around it, the context, and why they were there that night or what happened at that time.\n\n‘Like seeing the horn section listed on the back of that record. To me, the thing that makes that record is the flute. When that flute’s doing the semaphore, who played that? I got Chris Thomas and various people to find Steve Gregory. We had this quick interview on the phone, just to say, ‘Yes, it was me.’ That’s what I wanted to do – treat {Slade} like another person would treat The Beatles or treat The Pink Floyd…’\n\nThat’s it for this year, with 731,000-plus reads to date at http://www.writewyattuk.com, half a million of those coming in the last half-dozen years and 85,000-plus of those coming this year… so thanks for your ongoing support, folks. The year 2023 also saw the publication of my second book (five years after my Clash biography), Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade, and the 12 months ahead also promise to be busy. Another gear change is expected, but expect several more feature/interviews and reviews here. Watch this space.\n\nAnd until then, Happy New Year, one and all. Stay safe, keep the faith, and cheers again for checking out the WriteWyattUK website and my online social media links.\n\nYou can order Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Sladedirect via Spenwood Books or online via Amazon or try before you buy at your local library or order through your favourite bookseller. You can also track down copies in my old Surrey hometown at Ben’s Collectors’ Records, Tunsgate, Guildford, or closer to my current Lancashire base at Action Records, Church Street, Preston.\n\nThere’s a rather wonderful website out there listing more than 20 years of live performances for Noddy Holder, Jim Lea, Dave Hill and Don Powell, marking Slade’s evolution from their time with the bands that preceded the Black Country’s finest through to the final dates for the classic four-piece line-up.\n\nI’ve lost myself in its pages many times, not least while writing, researching and editing Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade. Kudos there, as with so much detailed online information and history concerning this legendary outfit, to Chris Selby, who happens to remain on close terms with members of the group to this day and almost dismissively suggests he was just around ‘right time, right place’ to witness the band’s emergence and chart their progress. From newspaper cuttings to numerous hours scrolling through library archives, Slade fans have much to be thankful for regarding his painstaking research; with Don’s diaries also a great help along the way.\n\nAnd this week is as good a time as any to skim through those archives in search of festive fixtures from the days of Dave and Don’s old band, The Vendors onwards, celebrating two decades of Christmas shows for an iconic West Midlands outfit forever associated with this magical time of the year.\n\nI’ll start on Friday 20th and Saturday 21st December 1963, with The Vendors at Etheridge Youth Club, Bilston, then Claregate Boys Club, Tettenhall, Wolverhampton, while Noddy’s fledgling outfit The Rockin’ Phantoms were doing their own thing the following lunchtime and the night after at regular haunt, the Three Men in a Boat in Bloxwich, before a Christmas Eve engagement at North Walsall Working Men’s Club.\n\nThe following December, 1964, The Vendors were getting bookings as The ’N Betweens, including a Sunday 20th show at the Ship and Rainbow, Wolverhampton, supporting Alexis Korner, and a Boxing Day bill with The Moody Blues at the Casino Club in Walsall, By then, Noddy was with Steve Brett and the Mavericks, also playing Walsall’s Casino Club (23rd), Nottingham’s Bridgford Beat Club (24th), and supporting Tony Dangerfield & the Thrills at the Ship and Rainbow (26th), both bands managing two more shows before the year out, each in Wolverhampton.\n\nBy Christmas Eve ’65, The ‘N Betweens were apparently managing appearances at both Harold Clowes Hall in Bentilee, Stoke-on-Trent and the Civic Hall, Brierley Hill, Dudley, ending the year with a New Year’s Eve show at Sneyd Lane Youth Club, Bloxwich. And the following Christmas Eve, 1966, both Nod and Jim now also on board – the classic four-piece in place – they were at Le Metro, Livery Street, Birmingham, finishing the year there a week later at the Silver Blades ice rink. And in December ’67 – when I was barely eight weeks old – they were between dates at the Bolero Club in Wednesbury (24th) and the Woolpack in Salop Street, Wolverhampton (26th), just a few days after a Dudley Zoo date with Jimmy Cliff. Oh, to have witnessed that.\n\nAccording to the records, they returned to the Woolpack the following Christmas Eve, 1968, also squeezing in a visit across town at Club Lafayette, appearing with the Montanas, before a Boxing Day Bolero Club return, then playing Wolverhampton Civic Hall on Friday 27th with The Idle Race (Jeff Lynne now featuring prominently in Roy Wood’s old band) and The Evolution.\n\nBut while there were a pre-Christmas trip to the Bolero Club in 1969, the year they became Ambrose Slade, released their debut album, then with Chas Chandler taking over the reins shortened the name, they were regularly venturing further afield, playing Fisher’s Melody Rooms in Norwich with Eyes of Blond on Christmas Eve, before a Boxing Day return to the Ship & Rainbow (although they were also down for Annabel’s nightclub in Sunderland, that day, a third visit that year, the first two as Ambrose Slade), with Wolverhampton’s Park Hall Hotel and Dudley Zoo’s Queen Mary Ballroom that weekend.\n\nThings had clearly moved on come the first Christmas of the ‘70s, two nights at Glasgow’s Electric Gardens the weekend before the festive break – by which time Play it Loud was in the shops – followed by a George Hotel date in Walsall on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day’s trip down to the Temple Club on Wardour Street, central London… albeit keeping it real with a Sunday 27th Connaught Hotel show in Wolverhampton.\n\nBy Christmas ‘71 we’re talking bona fide pop stars, on the back of first UK No.1, ‘Coz I Luv You’, Slade‘s engagements that festive season including Preston Public Hall (21st), Up the Junction in Crewe (23rd), and back on Wardour Street, this time at the Marquee (24th), finishing the year with a Friday date at The Boathouse, Kew Bridge (29th), the audience for the latter including Andy Scott and Mick Tucker of The Sweet.\n\nIn fact, Andy told me recently, “I remember dragging Mick, when I first joined The Sweet, down to the Boathouse at Kew. We walked in, went into the dressing room, and you could see they were getting ready to go on. I said, ‘Nice to see you,’ they went on, and we stood at the back somewhere. And it was like being in a war zone, the sound. They had that huge WEM PA system, which was like, I suppose, a good quality transistor radio turned up very loud. There wasn’t a hell of a lot of frequency differences. But the band themselves… I remember Mick and I both going, ‘Well, you know, that is full on energy!’”\n\nDecember 1972 involved three London dates between the Sundown Centre, Brixton (a short-lived disco in a venue now better known as the Academy) and linked Sundown Theatre, Edmonton (better known as The Regal), up to the 18th, the final date added to cope with demand. But there were no festive dates listed in 1973, while ‘Merry Xmas Everybody’ was at No.1, their third single to enter the charts at the top in that momentous year, a gap showing between November 20th’s European tour finale at Zirkus Krone in Munich and a January 9th US tour opener along with Jo Jo Gunne and Brownsville Station at the Spectrum, Philadelphia.\n\nAs for Christmas ’74, the schedule just shows Paris Olympia on December 16th – where French super-fan Gerard Goyer missed out, two days after his 19th birthday, as he was doing compulsory military service – and a TopPop performance in the Netherlands on the 29th, appearing with Mud, The Rubettes, George McCrae, ABBA and Carl Douglas… which all sounds a little bit frightening.\n\nDuring their US exile, they appeared on Friday 19th December 1975 at The Centrum / Cherry Hill Arena, New Jersey, with Kiss and Steppenwolf, the first band majorly inspired by Slade, the other a key influence on the band at the tail end of the ’60s. And to see Slade ‘Bak ’Ome’ at Christmas you had to wait until December 1979, a private do at St Bart’s Hospital followed by a Goldsmiths College date then Camden’s Music Machine (13th), the latter venue becoming familiar to the Slade faithful (this being their fourth of eight dates at a venue at other times in its distinguished history known as Camden Palace and now Koko), before a Beau Sejour Leisure Centre engagement in Guernsey (22nd), a mixed bill also including West London punks The Lurkers. Times had certainly changed.\n\nDaryl Easlea mentions the St Bart’s function in fellow 2023 arrival Whatever Happened to Slade? He writes, ‘Cutting engineer Phil Kinrade, a lifelong fan, was in hospital in December 1979 at St Barts in London’s Smithfield. Recovering from an operation, lying in bed, he kept thinking he could hear Slade playing in the distance. Worried, perhaps, that he may be hallucinating, Kinrade asked a nurse if he could hear Slade. It transpired the band were playing the hospital’s Christmas party.’\n\nMeanwhile, Dave Hemingway, the former Housemartins drummer/vocalist who went on to feature with The Beautiful South and these days Sunbirds, told me that Goldsmith’s date was his second Slade show, while he was a student there in New Cross. ‘They played the students’ Christmas party when they were assumed to be past it – has-beens. Not a chance. The students’ hall they played had a really low roof, and was long and narrow, with Slade at one end, and I was lucky enough to be around ten yards from the front. I say lucky, but my ears were ringing for two days afterwards. They got a girl up on the stage and Noddy, Jim and Dave just rocked out at her while she danced.’\n\nThe following year saw them play Grimsby’s Central Hall on December 22nd, eight days before a Rotters Club engagement in Doncaster, that landing four months after their Reading Festival triumph, fortunes changing again.\n\nThat’s where it really came together, those next three Christmases all about celebrating with Slade and finishing the year in style, December ’81’s schedule climaxing at Newcastle’s City Hall (18th), Birmingham Odeon (19th) and Hammersmith Odeon (20th), while the following year also ended at those venues, two nights back in the capital (17th/18th) followed by a Birmingham return (19th).\n\nAnd then came December 1983, Friday 16th’s Queen Margaret University date in Glasgow and Saturday 17th at Durham University followed by what proved to be Slade’s full UK live finale as the classic four-piece, at Liverpool’s Royal Court Theatre on Sunday 18th, 40 years ago this week and a year to the day after my sole live sighting of the legendary Nod, Jim, Dave and Don line-up at Hammersmith, when I was barely 15.\n\nThere were set to be more, the Black Country’s finest returning to America three months later, supporting their friend Ozzy Osbourne. But they managed just four warm-up dates – one in Texas, two in Colorado, then finally at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, on Wednesday, March 28th. That was it, Jim collapsing in the dressing room after a performance, later diagnosed with hepatitis C. They returned home and never toured again, Noddy proving resistant to another bash, despite them finally making waves on the US charts, concentrating on sorting out his divorce, Slade’s final decade together confined to the studio and promo appearances.\n\nIn early December ’84, a 1985 tour was announced, but while they appeared on BBC children’s TV show Crackerjack! on Friday 14th, within a fortnight that tour was cancelled… and never rearranged.\n\nI’ll head back here to Hammersmith Odeon on Saturday 18th December 1982. Backpacking around the world in 1990/91, I grew to understand how well known the support act, Cold Chisel, were in their native Australia, frontman Jimmy Barnes big news over there at the time. However, while reports suggest there was an impressive turnout from a fair dinkum expat/travelling fraternity, we were across the road soaking up the festive spirit in the Britannia instead.\n\nAs I put it in my introduction to Wild! Wild! Wild! heading up by train – Hammersmith bound – that night was ‘sketchy and vivid in equal measures.’ I shouldn’t have touched the ale, but the occasion commanded it, the clientele in the Fulham Palace Road boozer – lost to London by the end of the ’80s – that night ‘a motley mix of hippies, rockers, skins, punks and new wavers’, providing a cracking pre-gig vibe.\n\nI wrote, ‘The first series of The Young Ones had just aired, and it seemed I was living it. A ginger-haired guy led the choir, his voice strong enough to secure the gig if Noddy rung in sick; a biker on the balcony poured beer on a stranger’s head below (getting little more aggro than a few swear-words); and a Vyvyan-like skinhead commanded, ‘Oi, hippie, buy me a pint!’ and his brazen request was granted.’ And I’d still love to know if anyone can name that red-haired ringmaster in the pub.\n\nAt the Odeon, the absolute power certainly registered, as did the sight of Santa-suited Nod and his scantily clad elves for the inevitable ‘MXE’ encore. And while my evening caught up with me on a packed Tube jolting back towards Waterloo, what a night that was… and thankfully there are more in-depth recollections of that show in Wild! Wild! Wild! A People’s History of Slade.\n\nIt wasn’t Slade’s first visit to the Odeon. In fact, there’s a testimony from Style Council/Dexys keyboard maestro Mick Talbot in the book about being there when they played there in mid-May 1974 (doing three nights on that occasion), when he was 15. A five-minute walk away – under the Hammersmith Flyover and beyond – there was also the Palais, where they filmed a scene for Slade in Flame in early September ’74, fan club member Steve Edwards among those recalling that appearance in the book, turning up both there and at the Rainbow Theatre (up on the Seven Sisters Road in North London) the previous night. Then there’s Trevor Brum, who mentions seeing them twice at the Odeon, something he managed at the Marquee too, as well as seeing them back at the Rainbow in ’77.\n\nLincoln lad Martin Brooks – nowadays with the Pouk Hill Prophetz tribute act – was also there, having first seen the band on home ground in late April ’78 at the Theatre Royal. As was Leeds-based regular attendee/commandeered roadcrew legend Nomis Baurley, on the scene since a March ’77 date at Sheffield City Hall, eventually amassing more than 100 Slade shows. And the same goes for fellow contributor Paul A. Smyth.\n\nDylan White, the London-based radio plugger and promo man responsible for getting Noel Gallagher on board for that ’96 Oasis cover of ‘Cum on Feel the Noize’ (and more recently getting plenty of acclaim for his own debut LP, Unfinished Business), has an association with Slade live dating back to the Palladium in January ’73… and he was also at the Hammy Odeon in ’74.\n\nAs for the aforementioned Gerard Goyer, he was there both nights in December ’82 for his fourth and fifth Slade shows (having also managed two Music Machine shows in 1980), taking a few photos too, his trip over from Paris by train and boat taking him three and a half hours, probably far less than those who came straight from a show in Glasgow that Thursday night.\n\nI mentioned in my ‘Merry Xmas Everybody feature how that was Gavin Fletcher’s last Slade concert and author Bruce Pegg also enjoyed his night in the capital, in his case getting backstage with his US fiancée plus old friend Glenn Williams, later clambering out with Iron Maiden legend Bruce Dickinson and Girlschool drummer Denise Dufort, all five sharing a phone booth in a bid to keep warm while waiting on taxis. It was also Roy Capewell’s only chance to catch the classic Slade line-up.\n\nAs for Tony Roach, his recollections chime with mine. It was his last Slade show, and he recounted, ‘They were flaunting their heavy rock sound from Till Deaf Do Us Part, but it was regularly punctuated with Glam stompers like ‘Gudbuy T’ Jane’, ‘Mama Weer All Crazee Now’ and ‘Far Far Away’. Two immediate memories from that occasion: first, they were loud! You really did Feel the Noize. It vibrated through your ribcage like an earthquake. Second, the cross-section of the audience impressed me. There were kids and pensioners, hippy chick girls, black dudes, Japanese fans, middle-aged couples rubbing shoulders with Mohican-haired punks, Hell’s Angel types in studded biker leathers, dancing and joking with bovver-booted skinheads in denim and braces. Really, the most cosmopolitan crowd you could imagine, every one of them having a ball!\n\n‘There wasn’t an ounce of trouble, just a groundswell of bonhomie which seemed contagious. The atmosphere in the audience itself was brilliant, let alone what was booming out from the stage… I’ve never seen anybody work an audience better than Noddy Holder. He teased us, he jested with us, he thrilled us. My God, that voice – like a pitch-perfect, melodic concrete mixer. If he stood next to the runway at Heathrow, he’d drown out the jet planes! Don Powell behind on the drums: immense, relentless. He had those trademark stick-of-rock stripey drumsticks and he was like a runaway juggernaut. Finally, twin imps springing in, out, up and down either side of Circus Ringmaster Noddy. Jim Lea gave a good impression of Spring-heeled Jack, playing his violin like a man possessed. And he was matched in energy by whirling dervish Dave Hill – resplendent in giant brimmed hat, bandolier and stack-heeled snakeskin boots. I remember him bouncing all over the stage that night, like Tigger on speed, his guitar breaks breath-taking.\n\n‘All in all, it was the most exhilarating concert I ever attended. We were visited by a musical cyclone that evening, and I didn’t see a single person leaving who wasn’t smiling and dripping with sweat. A fantastic night.’\n\nFast forward a year and they were clearly still on top form, not least judging by a piece online this week from another Wild! Wild! Wild! Contributor, Ian Edmundson, co-author with Chris Selby of the six-book The Noize series. Marking four decades since that final full UK show, he said, “I have to feel really sorry for anyone who didn’t see the original line-up totally destroy an audience in 70 minutes and a dozen songs. You missed out.”\n\nSimon Harvey was among those who made it to Liverpool. He was 11 when he first heard ‘Get Down and Get With It’ and fell in love with Slade, three years later seeing them live for the first time at London’s New Victoria Theatre in late April ’75, travelling in from home town Slough w"
