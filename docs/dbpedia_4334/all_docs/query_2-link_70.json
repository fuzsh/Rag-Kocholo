        "text": "Well, it seems like forever, but I am finally back up and running!\n\nOr should I say Turning...... :happy-cheerleaderkid:\n\nThe Fall -- LP\n\nNorah Jones\n\n2009 Blue Note Records\n\nProduct Description\n\nVinyl LP pressing. 2009 release from the best-selling singer/songwriter. Norah has taken a new direction on the The Fall, experimenting with different sounds and a new set of collaborators, including Jacquire King, a noted producer and engineer who has worked with Kings of Leon, Tom Waits and Modest Mouse. Jones enlisted several songwriting collaborators, including Ryan Adams and Okkervil River's Will Sheff, as well as her frequent partners Jesse Harris and Richard Julian. Musicians include drummers Joey Waronker and James Gadson, keyboardist James Poyser and guitarists Marc Ribot and Smokey Hormel. The first single lifted from the album is 'Chasing Pirates'.\n\n1. \"Chasing Pirates\" Norah Jones 2:40\n\n2. \"Even Though\" Jones, Jesse Harris 3:52\n\n3. \"Light As a Feather\" Jones, Ryan Adams 3:52\n\n4. \"Young Blood\" Jones, Mike Martin[disambiguation needed] 3:38\n\n5. \"I Wouldn't Need You\" Jones 3:30\n\n6. \"Waiting\" Jones 3:31\n\n7. \"It's Gonna Be\" Jones 3:11\n\n8. \"You've Ruined Me\" Jones 2:45\n\n9. \"Back to Manhattan\" Jones 4:09\n\n10. \"Stuck\" Jones, Will Sheff 5:15\n\n11. \"December\" Jones 3:05\n\n12. \"Tell Yer Mama\" Jones, Harris, Richard Julian 3:25\n\n13. \"Man of the Hour\" Jones 2:56\n\nAbandoned Luncheonette -- LP\n\nDaryl Hall & John Oates\n\n1973 Atlantic Records\n\n1973 was an amazing year for Hall & Oates as they ushered their superstardom further with the incredible masterpiece Abandoned Luncheonette. Produced by the great Arif Mardin, this nine song album fused with classic Philly soul, rock and acoustic pop anthems delivered in a big way for the history making duo. Including the huge hit single She's Gone, as well as the celebrated title track, Abandoned Lunchonette was a watershed album which has rewarded them with non-stop success for the past 4 decades. Comes with LTD.ED.GATEFOLD Album cover & 5 Star Mastering from the original Atlantic Tapes!\n\n1. \"When The Morning Comes\" (Daryl Hall) - 3:12\n\n2. \"Had I Known You Better Then\" (John Oates) - 3:22\n\n3. \"Las Vegas Turnaround (The Stewardess Song)\" (Oates) - 2:57\n\n4. \"She's Gone\" (Hall, Oates) - 5:15\n\n5. \"I'm Just A Kid (Don't Make Me Feel Like A Man)\" (Oates) - 3:20\n\n6. \"Abandoned Luncheonette\" (Hall) - 3:55\n\n7. \"Lady Rain\" (Hall, Oates) - 4:26\n\n8. \"Laughing Boy\" (Hall) - 3:20\n\n9. \"Everytime I Look At You\" (Hall) - 7:04\n\nLittle Feat -- LP\n\nLittle Feat\n\n1971 Warner Bros. Records\n\nLittle Feat was the eponymous debut by the American rock band Little Feat, released in January 1971. Cobbled together from a variety of recording sessions mostly between August and September 1970, its sound can be best described as the antithesis to any of the group's classic recordings (such as 1973's Dixie Chicken and 1978's Waiting For Columbus). Featuring the Mk. 1 line-up of the group, with Roy Estrada on bass, it was the first of eight albums by the group before their initial 1979 break-up.\n\nThe blues that accented the group's later recordings were in full force on Little Feat. Utilizing slide guitar legend Ry Cooder, the group knocked off a medley of two Howlin' Wolf songs, \"Forty Four Blues\" and \"How Many More Years.\" The coming together of bizarre lyrics and superb instrumentation that dominated all Little Feat albums through Lowell George's tenure as leader were debuted with the dark \"Hamburger Midnight.\" The brilliant slices of American life that were present on each album were debuted with \"Strawberry Flats\" and \"Willin'\" (the latter destined for a reworking on Sailin' Shoes). The tender side of the group was exemplified with tracks like \"Truck Stop Girl\" and \"I've Been The One.\"\n\nThe cover shows a mural in Venice, California, painted by the L. A. Fine Arts Squad in 1970 - \"Venice in the Snow\".\n\n\"Snakes on Everything\" (Payne) – 3:04\n\n\"Strawberry Flats\" (Payne, George) – 2:20\n\n\"Truck Stop Girl\" (Payne, George) – 2:32\n\n\"Brides of Jesus\" (Payne, George) – 3:20\n\n\"Willin'\" (George) – 2:24\n\n\"Hamburger Midnight\" (George, Estrada) – 2:30\n\n\"Forty-Four Blues / How Many More Years\" (Roosevelt Sykes, Chester Burnett) – 6:25\n\n\"Crack in Your Door\" (George) – 2:16\n\n\"I've Been the One\" (George) – 2:20\n\n\"Takin' My Time\" (Payne) – 3:45\n\n\"Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie\" (Payne, George) – 1:55\n\nSomeone told me that there are Pigs on the cover, but I don't see them.... :romance-inlove:\n\nSilk Purse :text-bravo: :text-bravo:\n\nLinda Ronstadt\n\n1970 Capitol Records\n\nThe album featured songs in a more traditional country setting. Ronstadt later remarked that Nashville Country is very different than California Country. This album was also different in style and sound from Ronstadt's previous Folk Rock work with the Stone Poneys. Silk Purse includes interpretations of Hank Williams' rendition of \"Lovesick Blues\" and Mel Tillis' \"Mental Revenge\" and a version of the bluegrass traditional song \"Life Is Like A Mountain Railway.\" Ronstadt also included a strange remake of the Gerry Goffin and Carole King \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\" that had been recorded by The Shirelles in 1962, and a harmony duet with Gary White on the Paul Siebel ballad \"Louise,\" later covered by Bonnie Raitt. Included as well was a recording of a song White himself wrote, and Linda had to persuade her record company to get the ballad \"Long, Long Time\" on the album, which in due course, proved to be Linda Ronstadt's first chart single. After its recording, Capitol Records executives attempted to dissuade Ronstadt's from picking songs, like Long Long Time, which they considered too Country, even though Ronstadt had been attracted to ballads such as this and Heart Like A Wheel, which she later recorded.\n\n\"Lovesick Blues\" (Cliff Friend, Irving Mills) – 2:00\n\n\"Are My Thoughts With You?\" (Mickey Newbury) – 2:47\n\n\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" (Gerry Goffin, Carole King) – 2:27\n\n\"Nobody's\" (Gary White) – 2:56\n\n\"Louise\" (Paul Siebel) – 3:22\n\n\"Long, Long Time\" (Gary White) – 4:18\n\n\"Mental Revenge\" (Mel Tillis) – 2:40\n\n\"I'm Leaving It All Up to You\" (Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris, Dewey Terry) – 2:21\n\n\"He Darked the Sun\" (Gene Clark, Bernie Leadon) – 2:40\n\n\"Life Is Like a Mountain Railway\" (Traditional) – 3:23\n\nMy favorite \"Barbra\" album cover...... (and a really good album!)\n\nSuperman\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\n1977 Columbia Records\n\nWhile SUPERMAN will not go down as Babs' greatest release, it is a straight-ahead delivery of material done the Streisand way, with little deviation from her signature style. It is, in a word, consistent, which still puts it above many of her contemporaries. The record contains ballads, mid-tempo tunes and rockers, with first-rate production all around. \"Superman\" is a ready-for-airplay lead-off track, with a big arrangement. \"Don't Believe What You Read\" is a faster song with a country twang, showing that Barbra can explore other territories.\n\n\"Baby Me Baby\" is a slow, bluesy number with those golden vocal chords expressing heartfelt emotion. \"My Heart Belongs To Me\" was a number four smash and one of Barbra's greatest singles. \"Love Comes From Unexpected Places\" is a beautiful acoustic track. She even adds a jazz touch to Billy Joel's \"New York State Of Mind.\" SUPERMAN will leave Streisand fans satisfied and make neophytes aware of her enormous talent.\n\n\"Superman\" (Richie Snyder) - 2:47\n\n\"Don't Believe What You Read (Barbra Streisand, Ron Nagle, Scott Mathews) - 3:37\n\n\"Baby Me Baby (Roger Miller) - 4:26\n\n\"I Found You Love (Alan Gordon) - 3:50\n\n\"Answer Me\" (Streisand, Paul Williams, Kenny Ascher) - 3:16\n\n\"My Heart Belongs to Me\" (Alan Gordon) - 3:21\n\n\"Cabin Fever\" (Ron Nagle) - 3:14\n\n\"Love Comes from Unexpected Places\" (Kim Carnes, Dave Ellingson) - 4:10\n\n\"New York State of Mind\" (Billy Joel) - 4:44\n\nHere's a favorite....\n\nRed Headed Stranger\n\nWillie Nelson\n\n1975 Columbia Records\n\nRed Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. A concept album, Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife. Sparse and jumbled, with brief, poetic lyrics, no one involved in the creation of the album thought it would sell well. In spite of its inaccessibility, Red Headed Stranger was a blockbuster among both country music and mainstream audiences, going multi-platinum and making Nelson one of the biggest stars in country. The album's title would become a lasting nickname for Nelson. The album was ranked #184 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[1] It was ranked #1 on CMT's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music in 2006. In 2010, the album was preserved into the National Recording Registry because the album was \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States.\"\n\n\"Time of the Preacher\" (Willie Nelson) – 2:26\n\n\"I Couldn't Believe It Was True\" (Eddy Arnold, Wally Fowler) – 1:32\n\n\"Time of the Preacher Theme\" (Nelson) – 1:13\n\n\"Medley: Blue Rock Montana/Red Headed Stranger\" (Nelson, Carl Stutz, Edith Lindeman) – 1:36\n\n\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" (Fred Rose) – 2:21\n\n\"Red Headed Stranger\" (Carl Stutz, Edith Lindeman) – 4:00\n\n\"Time of the Preacher Theme\" (Nelson) – 0:26\n\n\"Just as I Am\" (Nelson) – 1:46\n\n\"Denver\" (Nelson) – 0:53\n\n\"O'er the Waves\" (Juventino Rosas, arranged Nelson) – 0:47\n\n\"Down Yonder\" (L. Wolfe Gilbert) – 1:56\n\n\"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" (Hank Cochran) – 5:24\n\n\"Remember Me\" (Scotty Wiseman) – 2:52\n\n\"Hands on the Wheel\" (Bill Callery) – 4:22\n\n\"Bandera\" (Nelson) – 2:19\n\n8277\n\nGreen House\n\nLeo Kottke\n\n1972 Capitol Records\n\nAmazon.com essential recording\n\nFingerstyle guitar legend Leo Kottke has released his share of duds over the years (virtually all of his albums with the exception of his seminal 6 & 12 String Guitar have a few throwaway tracks), but this disc is one of his most consistent efforts. Originally released in 1972, it features Kottke's trademark blend of playing--an infectious mix of New Age (still not invented at the time of this recording) and bluegrass sounds--as well as a few surprises. \"Bean Time\" has classic Kottke wizardry; it's a tune many proficient guitarists are still trying to figure out. \"In Christ There Is No East or West\" features Kottke on the 12-string, paying homage to his mentor, John Fahey. Sure, many of us could do without Kottke warbling through \"Tiny Island\" or \"From the Cradle to the Grave,\" but this is still a great recording, loaded with some of the greatest playing to ever happen on acoustic guitar. --Jason Verlinde --This text refers to an alternate Audio CD edition.\n\nSide one\n\n\"Bean Time\" – 2:32\n\n\"Tiny Island\" (Al Gaylor) – 3:46\n\n\"The Song of the Swamp\" – 3:00\n\n\"In Christ There is No East or West\" (Traditional) – 2:12\n\n\"Last Steam Engine Train\" (Sam McGee, John Fahey) – 3:00\n\nSide two\n\n\"From the Cradle to the Grave\" (Leo Kottke, Ron Nagle) – 3:23\n\n\"Louise\" (Paul Siebel) – 4:02\n\n\"The Spanish Entomologist\" (Traditional) – 2:24\n\n\"Owls\" – 5:00\n\n\"You Don't Have to Need Me\" – 4:37\n\n\"Lost John\" (Traditional) – 2:15\n\nMy last one for the evening....\n\nTwo Men With The Blues -- 2 LP Set\n\nWillie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis\n\n2008 Blue Note Records\n\nTwo Men with the Blues is no more a jazz album than a blues album. It's neither jazz returning home, nor blues wandering out. What Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis have created is a compilation of jump-blues standards with arrangements that compliment both genres. While most of the album is careful not to take itself too seriously, there are a few tracks that seem to plod on for ages. The live set kicks off with the upbeat \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" on which Marsalis' horn is crisp and full. \"Ain't Nobody's Business\" and \"Basin Street Blues\" are arranged slower than better known versions but still fit the album's context. Nelson and Marsalis's take on \"Stardust\" comes off as a bit too \"Sinatra\" for Nelson's thin vocal, while \"Georgia on My Mind\" just doesn't work at all. Still, the things that work, work well. \"Night Life\" and \"Rainy Day Blues\" are particular stand-outs, and \"Caldonia\" is a faithful homage to the Louis Jordan original--minus Jordan's screaming punch line, of course. The album ends riding high on the last song, \"That's All,\" with its straight-out-of-a-New-Orleans-Baptist-church feel. Both Nelson and Marsalis are notorious for collaborating with other artists. Therefore, it seems only natural that they've found themselves on a project together. Overall, this set is well worth the wait. --Eric C.P. Martin\n\n1. \"Bright Lights Big City\" – 5:20\n\n2. \"Night Life\" – 5:44\n\n3. \"Caldonia\" – 3:25\n\n4. \"Stardust\" – 5:08\n\n5. \"Basin Street Blues\" – 4:56\n\n6. \"Georgia On My Mind\" – 4:40\n\n7. \"Rainy Day Blues\" – 5:43\n\n8. \"My Bucket's Got a Hole In It\" (Williams) – 4:56\n\n9. \"Ain't Nobody's Business\" – 7:27\n\n10. \"That's All\" (Merle Travis) – 6:08\n\n* Willie Nelson – vocals and guitar\n\n* Wynton Marsalis – trumpet and vocals\n\n* Mickey Raphael – harmonica\n\n* Walter Blanding – saxophone\n\n* Dan Nimmer – piano\n\n* Carlos Henriquez – bass\n\n* Ali Jackson – drums\n\nCannonball Adderley Quintet In Chicago\n\nCannonball Adderley Quintet\n\n1959 Mercury Records\n\nCannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago (also released as Cannonball & Coltrane) is an album by jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, his final release on the Mercury label, featuring performances by Adderley with John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb.[1] The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars and states \"Altoist Cannonball Adderley and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane really push each other on these six selections... Coltrane's very serious sound is a striking contrast to the jubilant Adderley alto... With pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb playing up to their usual level, this gem is highly recommended\".This band would record the classic album Kind of Blue (1959) with Miles Davis one month following this session.\n\nAll compositions by Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley except as indicated\n\n\"Limehouse Blues\" (Philip Braham, Douglas Furber) - 4:39\n\n\"Stars Fell on Alabama\" (Mitchell Parish, Frank Perkins) - 6:15\n\n\"Wabash\" - 5:44\n\n\"Grand Central\" (John Coltrane) - 4:33\n\n\"You're a Weaver of Dreams\" (Jack Elliott, Victor Young) - 5:31\n\n\"The Sleeper\" (Coltrane) - 7:15\n\nRecorded at Universal Recorders Studio B, Chicago, IL on February 3, 1959\n\nCannonball Adderley - alto saxophone\n\nJohn Coltrane - tenor saxophone\n\nWynton Kelly - piano\n\nPaul Chambers - bass\n\nJimmy Cobb - drums\n\nPorgy and Bess\n\nLena Horne / Harry Belafonte\n\n1959 RCA Records\n\nPorgy and Bess is an album by Harry Belafonte and Lena Horne, released by RCA Victor in 1959. It includes songs from George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess. Belafonte and Horne sing two songs together: \"There's a Boat That's Leavin' Soon for New York\" and \"Bess, You is My Woman.\"\n\nAll music composed by George Gershwin, lyricists indicated.\n\n\"A Woman is a Sometime Thing\" (DuBose Heyward) – 2:40\n\n\"Summertime\" (Heyward) – 3:11\n\n\"Oh I Got Plenty of Nothing\" (Ira Gershwin, Heyward) – 3:00\n\n\"I Wants You to Stay Here\" (I.

Records\n\nRoses in the Snow was a 1980 album by Emmylou Harris. While Harris' previous release, 1979's Blue Kentucky Girl featured traditional, straight-ahead country (as opposed to the country-rock of her prior efforts), Roses in the Snow found Harris performing Bluegrass-inspired music, with material by Flatt and Scruggs, Paul Simon, The Carter Family, and Johnny Cash. Cash, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Ricky Skaggs and Tony Rice made guest appearances. \"Wayfaring Stranger\" was released as the first single in 1980 and went to #7 on the Billboard Country charts. The second single, a remake of a Simon & Garfunkel song, \"The Boxer\" reached #13. Backing musicians included Albert Lee and Jerry Douglas.\n\n1. \"Roses in the Snow\" (Ruth Franks) – 2:32\n\n2. \"Wayfaring Stranger\" (Traditional/arr.

It was released in 1968 by Bang Records after Diamond left Bang for Uni Records. Bang would eventually release four Neil Diamond compilation albums on top of the two original Diamond albums which Bang issued in 1966 and 1967.[2] Ten of the twelve songs on this album are original Diamond compositions with the remaining two cover versions of oldies. After Columbia Records absorbed Bang Records, this album was replaced by a new compilation titled Classics: The Early Years which replaced the cover songs with additional Diamond originals: \"I'm A Believer\" (which became a hit for The Monkees) and \"Shilo\" which Bang initially rejected as a single but was later released as a single and became a hit in 1970 after this album was released.\n\nSide one \"Cherry, Cherry\" \"Oh No No\" \"New Orleans\" (Frank Guida, Joseph Royster) \"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\" \"Do It\" \"You Got to Me\"\n\nSide Two \"Solitary Man\" \"Kentucky Woman\" \"Thank the Lord for the Night Time\" \"Red, Red Wine\" \"Hanky Panky\" (Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich) \"The Boat That I Row\"\n\nEvangeline\n\nEmmylou Harris\n\n1981 Warner Bros. Records\n\nEvangeline was a 1981 album by Emmylou Harris that was composed mostly of leftover material from past recording sessions and which did not fit into any of her other albums. Songs included a remake of \"Mister Sandman\" (from the ill-fated Trio sessions with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt), \"Evangeline\", which she had previously performed with The Band, Rodney Crowell's \"Ashes By Now\", and a cover of John Fogerty's \"Bad Moon Rising\". Though it received mixed reviews upon its release, the album was yet another commercial success for Harris. It was certified Gold in less than a year after its release. A single release of \"Mister Sandman\" (Top 10 country/Top 40 pop) did well on the charts, though neither Ronstadt's nor Parton's record companies would allow their artists' vocals to be used on the single, so Harris rerecorded the song, singing all three parts for the single release.\n\n1. \"I Don't Have to Crawl\" (Rodney Crowell) – 3:46\n\n2. \"How High the Moon\" (Morgan Lewis, Nancy Hamilton) – 3:21\n\n3. \"Spanish Johnny\" [with Waylon Jennings] (Paul Siebel) – 3:50\n\n4. \"Bad Moon Rising\" (John Fogerty) – 2:40\n\n5. \"Evangeline\" (Robbie Robertson) – 3:09\n\n6. \"Hot Burrito #2\" (Gram Parsons, Chris Ethridge) – 3:04\n\n7. \"Millworker\" (James Taylor) – 4:03\n\n8. \"Oh Atlanta\" (Bill Payne) – 2:58\n\n9. \"Mr. Sandman\" [harmony by Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt] (Pat Ballard) – 2:20\n\n10. \"Ashes by Now\" (Rodney Crowell) – 4:24\n\nOk I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I'm only now getting around to listening to this (in SACD/5.1), despite Zing posting about this some number of months ago...\n\nAnyway, I'm not normally all that into the funk side of jazz, but this - this is good stuff! The first track that really grabbed me is #4 - The Left Bank - because of the interesting, intricate rhythmic stuff going on (some of it subtly in the background), and also because I think this is the first recording where I've noticed that they place some sounds in the center rear; most often stuff in the surrounds seems to be mostly left or right, rarely directly in the back. Maybe there are some... but this is the first time it's been obvious to me that someone's doing it purposefully in center rear.\n\nSo I'm enjoying this one a lot! Haven't even finished listening to the whole disc yet, and had to post this."
