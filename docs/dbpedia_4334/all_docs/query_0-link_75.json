        "text": "Mike doesn't sing or play on the Wichita album though. It seems as much a Nesmith record as Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color is a Sinatra album. And it seems particularly inconsistent to say that Wichita is a Nesmith album but that the First and Second National Band albums are not, when all were credited to bands rather than Nesmith as an individual, but the latter ones actually feature singing and playing by Nesmith. Besides which, we don't know that your theory is even what the author of the article intended. He may have had some other convoluted rationale for saying Stash is the third Nesmith album. Or it might be a mistake... when an ostensibly professional piece of writing is sloppily written (typos and multiple unnecessary commas) then it makes me wonder how much thought and care the writer gave to the piece.\n\nAt any rate, whatever his rationale he is seemingly splitting hairs over a distinction that is trivial and illogical. The result being that he's creating unneeded confusion, which is the opposite of what a person writing an informative historical review typically wants to do.\n\nI have been wanting to add to this Michael Nesmith Appreciation thread with some song rankings for quite sometime. It has been hard to find the time but I was motivated recently by the Monkees Rate and Review thread where some relatively unknown artists covered rare (originally unreleased) Nesmith penned tunes. That and a Nesmith tune was just up for a Grammy this year. With all that in mind I created a list of Top Nesmith songs in three categories - written and sung by Nez, written by Nez and sung by another vocalist and sung by Nez but written by someone else. I will put my top ten and would love to see other fans lists!!\n\nI will start with songs sung by Nez but written by someone else. This was the smallest group of tunes to choose but the quality is there, both when he was with the Monkees and solo.\n\n1. What Am I Doin Hangin Round - as a Monkee, off the Pisces LP written by Michael Martin Murphey and Owen Castleman\n\n2. I Looked Away - written by Clapton off Nevada Fighter\n\n3. Wax Minute - off Tantamount to Treason written by Richard Stekol\n\n4. Love is Only Sleeping - another Pisces cut by great writing duo Mann/Weil\n\n5. If I Ever Get to Saginaw Again - Missing Links 2 track a Russell/Keller song\n\n6. Salesman - more Pisces written by Craig Smith\n\n7. Door into Summer - Nez got a lot of leads on Pisces and all but one from other songwriters. This credited to Chip Douglas and Bill Martin\n\n8. Of You - off Missing Links by Bill and John Chadwick\n\n9. Rainmaker - more Nevada Fighter, penned by Harry Nilsson\n\n10. Talking to the Wall - more Bill Chadwick from Tantamount to Treason - Vol. 1\n\nHere are songs sung by Nez and written by him as well.\n\n1. Papa Gene's Blues - early Monkees track\n\n2. Nevada Fighter - great song, great LP\n\n3. Marie's Theme - from the Prison LP\n\n4. Crippled Lion - Magnetic South\n\n5. Rio - a hit in England\n\n6. Listen to the Band - Monkees take is my favorite\n\n7. Dance Between the Raindrops - more from the Prison\n\n8. How Can You Kiss Me - can't believe how good this early single is\n\n9. St. Matthew - more Missing Links 2\n\n10 - Casablanca Moonlight - From, From A Radio Engine to a Photo Wing\n\nSo many more but I am sticking with 10.\n\nLast category and my favorite. I love Nesmith as a singer but these artists have made these Nesmith tunes so great the first several are my favorite songs by anybody, ever.\n\n1. The Girl I Knew Somewhere - my favorite tune with Micky Dolenz doing the lead vocals\n\n2. Different Drum - The Stone Poneys, sung by the incredible Linda Ronstadt\n\n3. Some of Shelly's Blues - The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\n\n4. Propinquity - from Dolenz Sings Nesmith sung by Micky, of course\n\n5. Silver Moon - Eric Alexandrakis official title is Silver Moon (a tribute to Michael Nesmith) and the latest entry on this list and Grammy nominated\n\n6. Mary, Mary - more Micky singing with the Monkees\n\n7. Carlisle Wheeling - Micky off DSN\n\n8. Daily Nightly - Micky singing this Pisces LP tune, a great psychedelic track\n\n9. I've Never Loved Anyone More - co written with Linda Hargrove sung by Lynn Anderson\n\n10. Soul-Writers Birthday - the EP extra's from DSN and a really cool tune.\n\nThere are very good, and unique versions of several of the above from Different Drum, Propinquity, Shelly's Blues, etc. There are also covers of those tunes on this thread by SHF members, which is really cool as well. A cover of the unreleased My Share of the Sidewalk, I just heard. It is pretty good but it would be tough to crack this list but Silver Moon just did so who knows."
