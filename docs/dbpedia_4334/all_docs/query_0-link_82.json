        "text": "THE MONKEES PRESENT: THE MIKE & MICKY SHOW\n\nConcert Review -- June 6, Mountain Winery, Saratoga, Ca.\n\nBy Paul Freeman\n\nOn a cold June evening, in a lofty locale -- Saratoga, California's Mountain Winery --the audience's temperature rose dramatically, thanks to hot Monkee music.\n\nThe Monkees sprang to life in 1965 as a foursome. The current lineup features a titanic twosome -- Michael Nesmith and Micky Dolenz. On their first tour together as a duo, they display the real depth and breadth of the Monkee catalog.\n\nThis was a different kind of Monkees concert -- light on patter and shtick. No giant video screens. On this tour, it's all about the music. And the music is terrific. Even in a spacious outdoor venue like this one, the show achieved a warmth and intimacy.\n\nNo horns this time around, but extra stringed instrumentation builds an incredibly full sound with an Americana feel. Banjo, fiddle and pedal steel add exquisite ornamentation to many of the songs. And it's a killer band that's been assembled for this tour.\n\nYes, many of the smash hits are performed. But the emphasis is on eclectic rarities, including many tracks that were never released during the band's original incarnation. There are deep album cuts and tracks recorded in Monkee versions only as demos. Hidden gems galore -- many never previously performed live.\n\nIt's a show filled with unexpected delights, including many numbers with country, folk or psychedelic sensibilities. It allows Micky to display different sides of his talents and it's a great showcase for Nez's extraordinary songwriting gift.\n\nBoth men were in great voice at the Saratoga show and they demonstrated a pleasing vocal blend, when harmonizing. They appeared fit and ready to rock.\n\nAs the concert began, Micky and Mike strode to the stage from opposite wings. Nez in his sparkly shoes and Mr. Dolenz looking Johnny Cash-cool in a black long jacket and western hat. Nez played, among other guitars, his 12-string blonde, hollow-bodied Gretsch electric. Micky played a lot of acoustic guitar during the evening, as well as tambourine and maracas.\n\nThis tour is titled \"The Monkees Present: The Mike & Micky Show,\" so it was appropriate that the concert got off to a buoyant beginning with the surprise-filled, textured tune \"Good Clean Fun,\" a Nez composition from the 1969 album \"The Monkees Present.\"\n\nThey segued right into Hitsville for the next number, a rousing rendition of Boyce & Hart's \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" The Monkees' 1966 smash debut single. The addition of banjo actually enhanced this electrifying classic.\n\nNext up was Nez's tantalizingly twangy \"Sunny Girlfriend,\" with its clever, biting lyrics, from the \"Headquarters\" album. His \"Mary, Mary,\" with a sizzling Dolenz lead vocal, proved that Nesmith could write as commercially potent a tune as any coming out of Don Kirshner's hit factory. Featured on 1967's \"More of the Monkees,\" the song had already been recorded by the Butterfield Blues Band and would later be covered by Run-D.M.C.\n\n\"You Told Me,\" from \"Headquarters,\" was another irresistible Nesmith number with a great Nez vocal. It's the kind of spellbinding song that grips you instantly and makes you want to hear it again immediately.\n\nThey delivered a compelling version of the rocking flower power number \"For Pete's Sake,\" another top track from the chart-topping \"Headquarters,\" the third Monkees album and the first to more fully feature the band members' songwriting and instrumental skills. Micky served up another scintillating lead vocal on this one, which was written by Peter Tork and Joey Richards.\n\nThe rendition of \"The Door into Summer,\" with chimey guitars, a winning Nesmith lead vocal and Dolenz's spirited harmony, sounded even better than on the original from 1967's \"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\" The song was written by Chip Dougas and Bill Martin. Nez paid tribute to Martin, who passed two years ago. Martin co-starred with Nesmith in 1981's acclaimed, ground-breaking music and comedy video release \"Elephant Parts.\" The title \"The Door into Summer\" was inspired by the Robert A. Heinlein science-fiction novel.\n\nAs the band launched into a smoking intro to the next number, Nez interrupted to shout to Micky that he'd just had a message from the late Bob Heinlein, who said he didn't want to be Micky's stepping stone. They then powered back into one of the greatest garage rock numbers of all time, Boyce & Hart's \"(I'm Not Your} Steppin' Stone,\" a song that was covered not only by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, but by tons of punk groups, including Sex Pistols. From \"More of the Monkees,\" the track became their first B-side to reach the Top 20 (with \"I'm a Believer\" as the A-side).\n\nAt that point, our two Monkee men seemed to have divergent notions of what came next on the set list. Nez amiably quipped, \"You start off anything you want, Micky. I will follow you anywhere!\"\n\nWhat followed was one of the prettiest Nesmith tunes, \"Some of Shelly's Blues.\" The Monkees' version eventually showed up on Rhino's \"Missing Links, Volume Two.\" It was featured on Nez's 1973 solo album \"Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash.\"\n\nThe duo gave a fond shout out to the departed David Jones and the missing-in-action Peter Tork, who's currently promoting his new album with his Shoe Suede Blues group.\n\n\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" is another of Nesmith's remarkably infectious, mainstream pop tunes. It hit the Top 40 as a B-side, with \"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\" on the flip. The crowd cheered the crisp live version.\n\nMike and Micky served up an epic, swirling, trippy \"Birth of an Accidental Hipster,\" a song penned by Noel Gallagher and Paul Weller for The Monkees' amazing, 2016 hit album \"Good Times!\" This performance really soared.\n\nAnother concert highlight immediately followed -- \"St. Matthew.\" This is an outstanding Nez tune that hardcore Monkee fans will know from the Rhino \"Missing Links, Volume Two\" and \"Listen to the Band\" box set collections, as well as the label's 1995 expanded CD reissue of 1969's \"Instant Replay\" album, a trio album with Nesmith, Dolenz and Jones, after the TV show's cancellation and Tork's split from the band. Hearing it live was a real treat.\n\nNez joked that next up on his set list was \"The Wall.\" No, there wasn't a detour into the realm of Pink Floyd, but it was time for Nesmith to momentarily leave the stage as Micky took the spotlight to offer a mind-blowing \"Porpoise Song,\" a Gerry Goffin-Carole King bit of psychedelia featured in the 1968 Monkees cult film \"Head,\" which was co-written by Jack Nicholson and directed by Bob Rafelson (\"Five Easy Pieces\").\n\nNez returned for another high point from \"Head,\" his own righteously rocking \"Circle Sky.\" It was another crowd favorite. A third number from the film, the lilting \"As We Go Along,\" which Micky mentioned was penned by Carole King and Toni Stern, gave him the opportunity for one of his finest vocals of the night, sincere, disarming and memorable.\n\nDolenz and Nesmith then paid homage to Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard, who wrote the glorious \"Me & Magdalena\" for \"Good Times!\" It was a beautiful vocal duet for the two Monkees, with lush guitar backing.\n\nAfter intermission, an acoustic segment charmed the audience. Included was an engagingly jaunty \"Papa Gene's Blues.\" The Nesmith number was the first song The Monkees learned, as the TV series was going into production. Many in the audience were singing along to this one.\n\nMicky's energy and exuberant scatting made \"Randy Scouse Git\" a pleaser. He wrote that one, which was a big hit in the U.K.\n\n\"Different Drum\" was given an alluringly laid-back tone that worked beautifully. That Nesmith tune was rejected by the TV series' music brain trust, so he peddled it to the Stone Poneys, whose soon-to-be-superstar lead singer Linda Ronstadt turned it into a huge record.\n\n\"Nine Times Blues\" proved to be another Nesmith beauty. It's available on \"Missing Links, Volume One.\" The three Monkees performed it on a post-TV series appearance on \"The Johnny Cash Show.\" Nez also recorded it on his brilliant, pioneering, country rock album \"Magnetic South\" with his First National Band. On this night, a wistful, heart-melting melody, eloquent lyrics and a perfect performance lifted this love song to great heights.\n\nOn the Boyce & Hart tune \"I'll Spend My Life with You,\" (from \"Headquarters\"), lovely harmonies made this gentle selection immensely appealing.\n\n\"Take a Giant Step\" was an enchanter, an indelible Goffin-King song, this one from the band's debut album. \"Auntie's Municipal Court\" (written by Nesmith and Keith Allison, from 1968's \"The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees\") was another evocative winner, with a strong Dolenz lead vocal.\n\nHeads bopped, feet tapped and the crowd sang out as Nez churned out a potent, hypnotic \"Sweet Young Thing,\" one of the band's rock 'n' roll classics.\n\nMicky's performance of \"Goin' Down,\" as is always the case, brought elation, as he sang a soulful, swingin' jazzy, scatty, rhythmic version.\n\nNext, Micky very capably took over Davy's lead singing chores on \"Daydream Believer,\" before turning it over to the crowd for a mass vocal love fest.\n\nMike's country tune \"What Am I Doing Hangin' Round?\" put the crowd back into toe-tapping mode. Then a whole new level was reached with an exhilarating performance of \"Pleasant Valley Sunday,\" a Goffin-King song that's one of the era's best rock singles.\n\nThe entire crowd was on its feet by the time the band hit the opening notes of The Monkees' iconic \"I'm a Believer.\" This place was packed with believers. At the song's conclusion, the crowd roared its approval.\n\nThe band left the stage, with Nesmith out there alone. He softly began strumming, playing the beginning of \"Listen to the Band.\" The rest of the group marched back, joined him, creating a mounting crescendo through the rest of the song, a fitting climax to an unforgettable evening of Monkee music.\n\nThe night was a testament to Nesmith's Monkee-related songwriting. Lyrically, he could be playful, poignant, deep or quirky, depending on the needs of the song's theme. He has always demonstrated a gift for unique turns of phrase. His melodies can grab you instantly, as well as haunt you forever. And keep in mind, his Monkee material represents merely a very small percentage of his recorded work. If you want a further glimpse into the man's profundity, read his new memoir, \"Infinite Tuesday.\" It offers insights, not only into his life, but into life in general.\n\nNez may be the main musical magnet, but charismatic Micky is a driving force. He clearly seems revitalized by this fresh format and exciting, previously untapped material. He has long kept the Monkee banner flying and has a new album, \"Out of Nowhere,\" that features his new vocals on classic tunes, accompanied by an orchestra.\n\nBacking The Monkees on this tour is an exceptional group of musicians, including Nez's son Christian Nesmith on guitar and backing vocals and Micky's sister Coco on background vocals and percussion. Both are strong contributors.\n\nEvery member of the band is truly impressive -- Circe Link, backing vocals; Wayne Avers, guitar, backing vocals; Rich Dart, drums, backing vocals, John Billings, bass; Alex Jules, keyboards, backing vocals; Pete Finney, pedal steel, guitar; Paul Kramer, fiddle, guitar, banjo.\n\nIt's clear they were all having a good time making diverse and dynamic music during the Saratoga concert. And the multi-generational audience shared their enthusiasm and sense of fun. A little girl, around seven years old, was singing along to even some of the more obscure tunes. For all those attending, it was a night to remember.\n\nWe're grateful that Nez reconsidered his decision to say goodbye to his live Monkee performances after a sentimental appearance with Micky and Peter at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre in 2016. This tour is a triumph.\n\nThe Monkees themselves deserve reconsideration. Weigh the entire body of work. They were too often facilely dismissed as a bubble gum act in the past. Yes, they made some of the best bubblegum records ever. But The Monkees' oeuvre is manifold, cutting across genre lines, sometimes cutting edge, even trailblazing. They introduced songs by some of the greatest songwriters of the time period. Hell, one of those songwriters was actually a member of the group.\n\nIt's time to admit it -- The Monkees stand among the most important and influential bands to emerge from the 60s (Hello, are you listening, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?) And they're still making top-notch music, 50 years after their creation.\n\nLet's hope there's a Monkees Present Mike & Micky tour 2019. There are still tons of great songs to unearth, such as \"Propinquity,\" \"Salesman,\" \"Tapioca Tundra,\" \"While I Cry,\" \"Don't Call on Me\" and the anti-war song \"Zor and Zam,\" to name but a few.\n\nMeanwhile, in the very near future, these two Monkees may be comin' to your town... if you're extremely fortunate.\n\nFor those who don't have an opportunity to experience this show in person, let's hope that Nez and Micky have the good sense to record some of these historic performances for future release in broadcast, CD and/or DVD formats. These concerts are treasures!\n\nRemaining 2018 dates for The Monkees Present: The Mike & Micky Show include:\n\n12 Paramount Denver, CO 14 Copernicus Center Chicago, IL 15 Rose Music Center Huber Heights, OH 16 Cain Park Cleveland, OH 18 Sony Center Toronto, ON  Canada 19 Centre In the Square Kitchener, ON  Canada 21 Keswick Theatre Philadelphia, PA 22 Beacon Theatre New York, NY 23 The Paramount, Huntington, NY 25 Count Basie Theatre Red Bank, NJ\n\nBe sure to read our new interview with Micky:\n\nhttp://popcultureclassics.com/micky_dolenz.html"
