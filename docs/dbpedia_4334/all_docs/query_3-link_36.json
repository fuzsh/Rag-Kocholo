        "text": "Welcome to the “Ask Huey” Question of the Week page where Huey will select and answer one fan question per week to answer here on the site. Please submit your question to qow@hueylewisandthenews.com.\n\nAUTOGRAPH REQUESTS: Due to the increased number of autograph inquiries and items being sold on the internet, we are unable to accommodate such requests at this time.\n\nAugust 26, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI read somewhere that you got a perfect score on your Math SAT—very impressive! Did your advanced quantitative skills ever come in handy in your rock and roll career? I would think maybe in negotiating a record deal or tallying up the earnings from a hit single? Please let me know so I can tell our high schooler that even rock stars think it’s important to pay attention in math class.\n\nScott\n\nAnswer:\n\nAll true, but I’m not sure how my math skills aided in my career, except to account for the revenue received, but hey, that’s important right?\n\nAugust 19, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was born in 2002 and have been a huge fan for some years now. Independently, I became a huge Kenny Loggins fan and was blown away when I learned that you worked together on several occasions. Can you tell us a bit about your friendship/cooperation?\n\nGreetings from Germany,\n\nLinus\n\nAnswer:\n\nAs you know, Kenny is a great collaborator, and he suggested a chord progression, that I wrote melody and words to for our Fore album. Since then we’ve seen each other several times, usually at a music biz function of sorts. He’s a very nice guy, and very talented.\n\n(*note: the song was “Forest for the Trees”)\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI loved the song, “is it me.” Why was it not released as a hit?\n\nDon Salice\n\nAnswer:\n\nI don’t know. That was a record company decision.\n\nAugust 5, 2024Question:\n\nHave you (either alone or with the News) ever thought of recording with a female artist?\n\nWhich female artists do you prefer?\n\nWhat made you decide to move out to Montana?\n\nBaci from Italy!Phyllis Cindolo\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe cut I’M NOT IN LOVE YET with Wynona Judd.\n\nBonnie Raitt, Susan Tedesco, and many more.\n\nMore cheese, less rats.\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI just watched the Da Bois Podcast interview with you from last December. The podcaster hit on something that I have noticed for quite some time. Your music is all upbeat, positive, and happy, which is a large part of the reason why I love listening to HLN and watching your videos. Was this a conscious decision by you and the band, or is it just a natural outcome of the types of music that you love?\n\nJanet\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe latter. Interestingly, the happiest music comes from the people who have little. Blues music is meant to help us lose The Blues … to celebrate in the face of adversity. And, that’s just the music I’ve always gravitated to.\n\nJuly 22, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nAll your albums are absolutely great but some have been recognized for their greatness more than others, obviously like Sports and Fore. I happen to think the Plan B is a great album that doesn’t get talked about enough. What album do you feel doesn’t get the love it deserves?\n\nTodd B\n\nAnswer:\n\nOur latest, WEATHER. I really think it’s our best work.\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat are your five favorite records of all time? The ones you would take with you to a desert island.\n\nMarco Galvagni – Rovereto, Italy\n\nAnswer:\n\nLive at the Sands (Frank Sinatra with Count Basie)\n\nSatch plays Fats (Louis Armstrong plays the music of Fats Waller)\n\nElla Fitzgerald, the Early Years (with Chick Web)\n\nThe Best of Little Walter\n\nThe Real Folk Blues Sonny Boy Williamson\n\nBut, if you ask me again, I’d probably change my mind.\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI know former newsman Mario once said in an interview he auditioned for Foreigner before you guys formed. Did you or any other News members audition for other known bands as well?\n\nEric Senise\n\nAnswer:\n\nI auditioned for Manfred Mann, in 1977, and a couple college bands before that. I’m pretty sure the other guys have auditioned for others. Johnny was with Sly Stone for a few years.\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nYou enjoy both flyfishing and reading. I’m wondering if you have read Norman Maclean’s “A River Runs Through It” about fly fishing, along with two short stories in the same volume. All three stories are set in your neck of the woods.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJanet R.\n\nAnswer:\n\nOf course, and I recommend them to everyone. Thanks for mentioning them.\n\nJune 24, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat was the first song that you sang that you heard on the radio, and where were you when it came on? Were you elated and did your heart rate increase?\n\nJohn Melvin Parnell\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe all gathered at my house in Marin for a listening when KFRC added our record and then announce that they were going to play it that afternoon. It was surreal to hear it. I remember it almost sounded like someone else (I attribute that to the compression those powerful top forty stations used), and it sounded like a hit!\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhich song have you felt most emotionally attached to, and the reason behind that particular song?\n\nMaria Campbell – Healesville, Vic, Australia\n\nAnswer:\n\nMaybe “Walkin’ with the Kid” cause I wrote it about my son, but also Power of Love for the same reason.\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nDid you ever think your “Cruising” duet with Gwyneth Paltrow would turn out so good? And who would you have liked to have done a duet with? I’m a DJ on a local radio station in the UK and I play at least one of your tracks every day.\n\nJohn Bailey\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question, and no, I didn’t. But, having said that, the record was produced by Larry Klein, and he’s very talented and gets a lot of the credit for a very modern arrangement.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI recently found an old copy of Videowest featuring a version of “Sooner or Later” that is different than the album mix (btw, this was my first intro to HLN!). Was there something about that mix (and the video) you didn’t like resulting in an audio and video re-recording for the first album?\n\nGreg Argendeli\n\nAnswer:\n\nWow. That’s very interesting. We’d love to see that or maybe get a copy. That would have to be our demo which we rerecorded for our first album. We’d love to hear that. Maybe Michelle can communicate with Nina?\n\n* note: Original demo version of “Sooner or Later” (later titled “Some Of My Lies Are True (Sooner or Later)” was used for the first version of Videowest’s video (filmed at Ocean Beach, San Francisco) and can be seen here.\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nBeing a Marin brat myself, I often wonder whatever came of Uncle Charlie’s and the woman (Jeanie?) who pulled the levers? Shortly after I graduated from college, I was hired to work the front door. You and a smattering of band members would frequent the establishment. I’d be honored for you to share a couple memories of what Uncle Charlie’s meant to you (and the band?)\n\nMark B.\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question. I think I heard Jeannie and her husband moved to Florida, or maybe just southern Cal. Uncle Charlie’s was our workshop, and I remember it fondly even though there wasn’t much there. We wrote a lot of our songs and debuted them there.\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs there a particular song that you loved that didn’t do as well in the charts as you thought it would?\n\nKathy Schwabenlender – Charlotte, NC\n\nAnswer\n\n“But It’s Alright” from our album “4Chords and Several Years Ago” showed great early promise but sputtered when the record company collapsed and everyone got fired.\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI recently revisited your complete discography with The News and not too long after, watched the film “American Psycho” for the first time in several years. When I paid more close attention to Patrick Bateman’s monologue about the band’s career, it appeared to me to be an accurate take on your music. Would you agree with that assessment and what are your feelings on being represented in such an iconic film and book? Thank you ever so much.\n\nNicholas Malfitano – Philadelphia, PA\n\nAnswer:\n\nYeah, he clearly had listened more than a little. But what he couldnt have known is that our best album would be our latest “Weather”!!!\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow was it working with Roger Daltrey and Niko Mastorakis in .com for Murder? And how did you come across that role for the film?\n\nHarry Acton\n\nAnswer:\n\nI never saw them. I did that as a favor.\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI love the video, “If This Is It” and I love how the guys allowed themselves to be buried in the sand, which I’m sure was miserable for them after while. How long were the guys buried in the sand for the shoot of that sequence, and did they beg to get dug up? Is there a funny story behind this?\n\nLiz Landes\n\nJohnny: As I’m sure Sean and Bill will attest, the heat and sand wasn’t so bad (we were actually in a pit, not buried!) but the black flies and sand gnats were intolerable!!!!! The moment we finished a take, a whole crew would charge in with towels and fans, smith the sand, and charge back out for another take. How many takes? I must have blocked that part out!!!\n\nBill: I recall it was pretty toasty. We sat on wooden boxes in a big hole dug in the sand, with plywood covering the hole and cutouts around our necks.\n\nI remember it being hot, and between every take the makeup folks had to come in and blot the sweat away and fix some of the guy’s makeup. Not really any funny stories about it , but the finished video was proof positive that the gag worked!\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI grew up in San Francisco during the 80s. My dad (who lived in Sausalito during the 70s) would often tell me you can be found having drinks at The 2AM Club, Mill Valley. I’ve never been to The 2AM Club and don’t know if he was being funny or being serious. I wanted to ask… were you a regular at The 2AM Club?\n\nTyler\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’ve been there enough over the years to be thought of as a regular, but in truth we also hung out at a bar across the street called The Brothers.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI saw Clover at the Hammersmith Odeon. You were the support band. But for which headliner?\n\nPS. I also saw you there with the News & I sneaked in my camera. I have some great pics of you taken from the balcony.\n\nAlan\n\nAnswer:\n\nASLEEP AT THE WHEEL\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve always wondered. Was Mario’s mister cool and chilled image with the cigarette always hanging out of his mouth the genuine man or was it a caricature?\n\nSurely no one can be that hip!\n\nJeremy\n\nAnswer:\n\nHa ha. You’ll never know, and that’s the beauty of it right? That’s up to Mario. I’m not sure myself.. but, Mario was always very hip.\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a 42 year old lifelong fan and music fanatic in general and I still prefer listening to entire albums/LPs when I consume music much of the time. I’m woefully undereducated when it comes to blues, but recently checked out James Cotton after hearing your drop his name in a podcast and was blown away. Can you recommend some albums in that vein (or any other you think should be mentioned) for me to start down the rabbit hole?\n\nThanks and best wishes, Andrew Jenco\n\nAnswer:\n\nSure. Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Big Walter Horton are the big 3 for me. All harmonica players like James Cotton who was mentored by Sonny Boy.\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m going to see Tower Of Power live this summer! What’s your favorite song or memory with them?\n\nJanelle\n\nAnswer:\n\nSo many great memories … London, Paris, Oakland Coliseum 4 nights etc.\n\nAlso, hard to pick one song. I’ve always loved THIS TIME ITS REAL.\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nDuring one of your concerts you mentioned we would hear from your roommate, Billy Gibson – did you always room with Billy when you were on the road? Or, did you fellows change it up & room with someone different every time you were on tour? Ok, tell the truth, did Billy snore?\n\nKim\n\nAtlanta, Ga\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, Billy and I always roomed together, and he never snored, or at least I never heard him!\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nDid you guys ever cover a Christmas song like some artists do?\n\nTom\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe recorded an accapela version of Winter Wonderland, and sent a Xmas cassette to some of our newsliner fans years ago, but that’s the only Xmas song we ever recorded. Thought about doing a Xmas album, but couldn’t find a way to make it special.\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nAlong the lines of the “They All Come to Suzie” question, what about “Running with the Crowd” also from 1980? The sax solo’s great, and it sounds very much like Huey Lewis and the News. Was that your song? Could it/should it have gone on an album, in hindsight?\n\nCheers from London, Matt\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, it was our song, and perhaps should have been on an album. I’m not sure why we never released it.\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nJust watched the Netfix Documentary you posted on your site “The Greatest Night in Pop”. I have 2 questions on it. Your band was the only full band that was there, did you make that happen, or were The News the only full band to get an invite? And was your line done in only 2 takes as it was shown? That looked like a brutal recording session!\n\nEric Senise\n\nAnswer:\n\nActually the Jacksons were also there (Jackson 5), but our manager Bob Brown convinced them to do that.\n\nFebruary 19, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have been a huge fan for many years and saw you in concert in Grand Rapids, Mi. I recently purchased an album by Southern Pacific and you play harmonica on a couple of songs. That was during your peak years with the News. How did you find time to do that and how did that come about?\n\nJim Leonardo\n\nAnswer:\n\nJohn McFee, who was a founding member of South Pacific asked me. He was a fellow band member in Clover before that, and was instrumental in helping me get in the business to begin with.\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI just finished watching the Greatest Night in Pop on Netflix. I noticed everybody at one point getting each other’s autographs on the sheet music. Did you get one? Do you still have it? What an incredible experience. Would you say that was one of the best / most thrilling nights of your life?\n\nMichelle\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, I have a script, but only got a couple autographs. Was too intimidated. Definitely one of the most thrilling nights of my life, yes.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho would you say were you most intimidated by?\n\nAnswer:\n\nRay Charles and Stevie Wonder.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nQuestionDo you remember back about or around 1979 in Hawaii (Honolulu) being out on a raft all day and meeting some guy. We talked all day and you invited to meet you in the lobby. We took the bus to the concert. I had a great time. Do you remember this at all.\n\nJeff\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately, no. But, then, I don’t remember much about yesterday. I’m sure it happened.\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nYour music is the soundtrack of my life. My daddy was in the navy and he’d go away on deployment but when he would come back we got to listen to Huey tapes again. We’d sit in our Astro van, in the San Francisco Traffic, and make my dad start Heart of Rock N Roll and we would giggle hysterically when the music finally really hit after the crescendo of the heart beat. I was five years old. My dad is six months older than you, and you both helped raise me in your own ways. Im a singer and public school music teacher now. Thank you for the memories.\n\nMy question: What is a specific song that brings back that special type of memory for you?\n\nSam\n\nAnswer:\n\nCool story. Thanks for your kind words. Early James Taylor songs like “Fire and Rain” bring back big memories for me, as do a couple big band jazz standards my father used to love, like “Alright, Ok, You Win” from Count Basie\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have noticed that Weird Al Yankovic did a parody of “I Want A New Drug” being “I Want A New Duck.” I personally find it funny, but I’m curious if you were ever hesitant to allow it. And what your opinion is on the song?Jacob\n\nAnswer:\n\nI also thought it was funny.\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI saw many of your shows. Amazing fun! One of my favorites was at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park when you guys were touring incognito as “The Sports Section.” Whose idea was this and how did you get everyone to agree to it? Brilliant.\n\nJim Alexander\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe idea was to road test some new songs in a small venue before we recorded them. It was also fun playing such an iconic venue.\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m going to see Tower Of Power live this summer! What’s your favorite song or memory with them?\n\nJanelle Tubbs\n\nAnswer:\n\nTough question. There are so many. I’m going to go with “This Time It’s Real” as my favorite song. There are too many good memories to mention. We worked with the horn section for more than 2 years. Touring Europe was especially great. Enjoy their show … they still sound great.\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nQuestion:\n\nFirst off … huge fan … still have my Sony cassette with Auto Reverse that I repeatedly played Sports on! I wanna know what harmonica you played. I know it was a Dannecker …. But 10 or 12 hole? The 12 hole is for Jazz … so I could see you going that way as well as the 10 hole for blues , rock , country, and folk. Think you did the 10 hole. Trying to get my hands on a Dannecker … not much luck … lol.\n\nGary Carroll\n\nAnswer:\n\n10 hole diatonic Dannecker. I played chromatic harp on a couple things, but the diatonic harp is much more expressive, and the beauty of it is the ability to “bend” notes.\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat did you think when Weird Al asked to do a parody of I Want a New Drug?\n\nMichael Gross\n\nAnswer:\n\nI was flattered.\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nOne of my favourite HLN albums is “Four Chords And Several Years Ago”, as I love your interpretation of those classics (and got introduced to some songs I didn’t know before). I remember there was also a video released, and I was wondering if that might see a re-release on DVD (at least). I missed out on that tape, though I do have all your albums. Kind regards and all the best from Germany.\n\nJuern\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, that was a video of a live performance at the Public Broadcasting Service in Chicago. I believe we own that video, and I will now endeavor to find where you may be able to see it.\n\nDecember 4, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was recently introduced to the music of Little Feat through my husband and became a fan myself. After seeing them live last year, they reminded me so much of your shows. (I’m a sucker for a good horn section.) Other than both bands using the Tower of Power horns in the past, is there any other connection?\n\nMarcie – Las Vegas, NV\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m flattered by the comparison. They are one of my favorite bands. We worked together a few times and got to know them a little … great guys, and great players.\n\nNovember 27, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nAre there any albums you would go back and change or do something different for them?\n\nSarah\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. All of them! Mostly just little things, but when making a record, you never really finish, you just run out of time!\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHello, I’ve been a huge fan of yours since the mid-eighties and never tire of listening to the entire back catalogue of your music. I was wondering if you could explain the reasoning for not including ‘They all come to Suzie’ on any of your albums? I personally think it’s a banger of a song, and it’s one of my long term favourites of yours.\n\nScott Webster\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt was a mistake … should have put it on one of our records.\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy husband and I recently had the pleasure of sharing a Scottish breakfast with Warner E Hodges. I was wearing a Huey Lewis and the News t-shirt, which he complimented. He told us you’d given him the best piece of career advice he’d ever been given……..his band had supported you at a very early stage of their career and he said their set one night ‘truly sucked!’ He was gutted, but you came to see him and told him sometimes you’re shit, but keep going because the next time you won’t be!! So my question for you is this…What’s the best advice you’ve been given in your career, and who gave it to you?\n\nTrish – Northern Ireland\n\nAnswer:\n\nElvis Costello’s manager, Jake Riviera, articulated a strategy for how to deal with record companies; “Infiltrate, and then double cross”. It’s a funny line, but the upshot is, listen to everyone, but trust your own instincts finally.\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a 42 year old lifelong fan and music fanatic in general and I still prefer listening to entire albums/LPs when I consume music much of the time. I’m woefully under-educated when it comes to blues, but recently checked out James Cotton after hearing your drop his name in a podcast and was blown away. Can you recommend some albums in that vein (or any other you think should be mentioned) for me to start down the rabbit hole?\n\nThanks and best wishes, Andrew Jenco\n\nAnswer:\n\nSure. Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson and Big Walter Horton invented blues harmonica (Cotton learned originally from Sonny Boy) and all their records are good. James Cotton, Junior Wells, Paul Butterfield, Charlie Musselwhite are probably the best known 2nd generation harp players, and there are a number of modern guys who are great … and that’s just harmonica players. Enjoy.\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve enjoyed building up my HLN vinyl record collection and now have most of the albums. I only can’t seem to find Plan B though. Was it ever released as a vinyl?\n\nThank you\n\nSuraj Maraj\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have no idea, but I think so … Universal Music?\n\nOctober 16, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nDid you ever consider making a double LP? And if so, do you think it would have been a concept album? “Small World” is slightly something like that, as most of the songs are touching a “living together, at best in harmony” topic.\n\nNiklas Nowak\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot really. Ten original tunes is enough of a challenge.\n\nOctober 9, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen you were in Europe playing your harmonica, how many different countries did you travel to, and were you stuck eating rubbish food?.\n\nScott Fowkes\n\nAnswer:\n\nAll the countries of Western Europe. The food was excellent.\n\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nSome of my favorite tracks were on Time Flies. Will you ever release digital version of 100 Years from Now, Til the Day after and When the Time has Come?\n\nGlen\n\nAnswer:\n\nI agree. And, I love some of that. I wasn’t aware that digital versions weren’t available. I’ll try to check. Thanks.\n\nSeptember 18, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHave you ever been to Graceland? If so, what’d you think? Are you an Elvis fan?\n\nJanis Rudolph – New Milford, NJ\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. I thought it was a little weird, although I am a huge Elvis fan.\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have always loved your music. What song did you do a video that had a scene in a weight room? My brother was in the scene and I would love to show it to his nieces and nephews, my children, but I cannot remember which song/video it was. I would greatly appreciate you answering my question.\n\nAnonymous\n\nHey, Anonymous … I have no ideas.\n\n(note: I believe the video you are referring to is “Couple Days Off.” – Michelle)\n\nSeptember 4, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi there. I’m obsessed – none of us can remember who was the headliner at Oakland Coliseum, late 70s, when Huey & American Express opened. We were blown away. Enough that we’re not sure who you opened for. Bob Seger? Doobies? Boston?\n\nCheerio, and thanks.\n\nAnne\n\nAnswer:\n\nNever played Oakland Coliseum in the 70’s that I can recall. We spend for Kenny Loggins at the Greek Theater in the late 70’s.\n\nAugust 28, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nA question from a Scottish fan.\n\nI saw you & the band at a gig in Glasgow, Scotland many years ago. Fab!\n\nI know you’ve also been to Scotland in your youth/younger days.\n\nHave you ever been called “Shug” or “Shuggie”? This is quite a common derivation of “Hugh” here.\n\nJune\n\nAnswer:\n\nAbsolutely. All the guys in Thin Lizzy called me “wee Shug”, or “wee shuggie.”\n\nAugust 21, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was born in 1974 and I have been a HUGE fan since Sports. Needless to say, when Back to the Future came out, it was instantly my favorite movie and I have held both the movie and the band closely as my favorites of all-time. My question to you is, what is your favorite movie and band? Thanks for being there my whole life when I need a pickup.\n\nDon Warling\n\nSFC, US Army Retired\n\nAnswer:\n\nImpossible question cause I like so many, but I loved “The Last Picture Show”, “Wag the Dog”, and a small independent film called “Into the West”, and so many others. As for bands; Tower of Power, Little Feat, Tedeshci Trucks Band, Neville Brothers and others.\n\nAugust 14, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a huge fan of Reba. Loved the video for “Is there life out there.” What was it like working with her?\n\nDiana Hudson\n\nShe was terrific. During the breaks, we sang, and I played harmonica … had a ball.\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nPerfect World video…Just curious where that video was filmed. Looks like the landfill in Granda Hills area.\n\nAnonymous\n\nAnswer:\n\nLandfill in Novato, California, the owner of which lived across the street from our manager. I love that video.\n\nJuly 24, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nOne of my all time favourite news tracks is “It Hit Me Like A Hammer.” That song was co-written with Mutt Lange and I’ve always been curious, is that an idea/hook you had been working on for a while and you took to him for help finishing or did Mutt Lange bring the idea to you? While the song was a solid hit, hitting Top 25 on the Hot 100 and Top Ten on A/C, I honestly think had it come out in ‘89 instead of ‘91, it would have been another monster hit for you guys. Such a perfect catchy summer tune and is quite possibly the most underrated single from the whole News catalogue.\n\nAlex\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe song was all Mutt. I think I rewrote some of the lyrics.\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have always enjoyed the songs where the 49ers were singing backup vocals. What is the story behind that? Did the 49ers approach you, or did you reach out to them? In addition to “I Know What I Like” and “Hip to be Square” – were any other tracks considered?\n\nBret Ellsworth – Saratoga Springs, Utah\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe met Joe and Dwight at a Bay Area Music award show, and Joe jokingly offered to let me take some “snaps” if I would let them sing on a song. We took him up on it, although I never got the snaps.\n\nJuly 10, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat was the most fun video you guys ever did?\n\nRay Begin\n\nAnswer:\n\nProbably, Stuck with You cause we had 4 days in the Bahamas, but we had a lot of laughs doing “Heart and Soul”.\n\nJuly 3, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI remember the Sports album having the same popularity of a “Frampton Comes Alive” with what seemed like everyone had a copy of it. “If This Is It” is my all-time favorite HLN song.\n\nWhen the album was finished and ready to be released, did you and the band have an inkling of the success it would have?\n\nJohnnie Parnell\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo idea. Although record promoter and soon to be Michael Jackson’s manager, Frank DeLeo told me at a listening party we had in New York; “Don’t worry … you’re gonna be ok”.\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat was your take on 1980s MTV? Did you watch any of it back then? Did the band create your music videos with MTV in mind? Do you think MTV contributed to your band’s success?\n\nPeter Skiera\n\nAnswer:\n\nMTV was huge in the early 80’s. Of course we all had to suddenly make videos for the singles. We tried to have fun, be funny, and avoid a literal translation of the song … to, sort of, stay out of the tune’s way, if you know what I mean. And, yes, MTV was important to our success. I like to think that we’d have done well anyway, but MTV certainly helped break us.\n\nJune 19, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe video of Perfect World is very unique as there very few bands shooting a video in a garbage dump except Kiss’ “Lick it Up” and The Police “Synchronicity II”. Where did the concept come from? It is a shame that Small World was not better received. I think by this point, your fans were with you regardless.\n\nRoger Zeidman\n\nAnswer:\n\nI confess the idea was mine. I still think it’s one of our best videos, and I agree that it’s a shame Small World wasn’t better received. Stan Getz’s solo on Small World still makes my hair stand on end.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nWorking with Thin Lizzy, what was one of your favourite memories of working with Phil and the lads?\n\nRichard\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have so many great memories of Phil. I think my favorite ones are from the studios in Compass Point in Nassau, and the Record Plant in Sausalito where we endeavored to cut new songs with him just before he passed. He was a mentor to me, and I learned everything I know about being a “rock star” from him.\n\nJune 5, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\n“Change of Heart” is a special song to me, as it in my opinion, illustrates what was about to come for you and your band: It’s rocky and powerful, yet it’s also catchy and revolves around the topic of love, which is so essential in the bulk of your songs. Do you remember how the song and the lyrics emerged?\n\nNiklas Nowak\n\nChris and I wrote that song together. I think he had the progression, I wrote the lyric and we collaborated on the melody. I really like that song also. We opened our live show with that tune for a long time.\n\nMay 29, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI love how you were an early advocate for Stevie Ray Vaughan’s enormous talent. Is there any footage (audio or video) of him playing “Bad is Bad” with HLN on that tour that might see the light of day?\n\nShawn Streifel\n\nAnswer:\n\nI don’t know, but I’m thinking there must be somewhere although that was a little before sophisticated cell phones.\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nDid you ever sing “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” by Elvin Bishop? To me, the song has a HL&TN vibe.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn Parnell\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, but I agree that it has an R&B vibe like many of our songs. Micky Thomas sang that song well. He’s a really good guy.\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve heard you say in a few interviews that at some point before you released your first record, the record label wanted you to replace your drummer (Bill Gibson). Why did they want to replace Bill? After all, Bill is a really good drummer and a good guy so I don’t get it.\n\nMike Karwisch\n\nAnswer:\n\nI didn’t get it either. Bill is as good as they come.\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nNick Faldo said on the Dan Patrick show that he would be fly fishing with you. Who are the other celebrities that you have gone fly fishing with?\n\nJohn Stimson, California\n\nAnswer:\n\nJimmy Kimmel, Kevin Costner, Joe Montana\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a 19 year old guy from Chico planning on moving to San Francisco for school and you seem pretty knowledgeable about the city. Are there any good spots you liked to hang out at when you were my age?\n\nRyan Stanley\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, but they‘ve all changed in the last 53 years! You’ll find plenty of good food, music, and entertainment. San Francisco is still a good town.\n\nApril 24, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Huey, here a long time fan from Argentina. In the early 80’s we lived during a military dictatorship. Like any totalitarian regime, they applied censorship and modified some song titles, softening them. When Sports arrived, I want a new drug was printed on LPs and Cassettes as I want a new drug (called love), a line that is neither in the song nor in the title of the American edition. I saw it happen in other countries as well. What did you think of this modification and did you participate in the decision or was it entirely up to the companies?\n\nJorge Drot de Gourville\n\nAnswer:\n\nActually, CBS did the same thing in America on the single. (I Want A New Drug (called love)\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuey, on your famous sunglasses that were in your iconic videos and a multitude of promo shots and posters, what brand were they? They don’t look like Ray Bans. I know you lost a pair on the boat filming I Want A New Drug video!\n\nEric S.\n\nAnswer:\n\nVuarnet\n\nApril 3, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nForest for the Trees is one of my favorite deep cuts from the studio albums of the 80s/90s. I’ve always wanted to know the background on this tune and what the intention was with it. It’s too good to be “filler” but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a single. Can you give some background on the genesis of this tune and what you remember about recording it?\n\nChris Jones\n\nAnswer:\n\n“Forest” was written by Kenny Loggins and myself. The lyric was inspired by a letter I received from a confused young fan who contemplating his demise, but, was dissuaded and helped by our music.\n\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI heard that you were going to do a solo album in the early 90s but the project was scrapped. Any reason why? I know some songs like “100 Years From Now” and the first release of “So Little Kindness” were written for the album but were there any more songs that were never released?\n\nRicky\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe truth is, no one was really knocked out by the results. Most of the songs were written by Chris Hayes and myself, and attempted to show some more serious and sophisticated material, and people don’t expect that from me. That said, we have used 3 or 4 of the ideas from that record and rewritten some.\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a Canadian fan in New Brunswick, over on the east coast. In high school we used to have lip synch “shows” where students would impersonate their favorite (then ‘80s) group in the auditorium, a theatre-style setting. That’s one of my great memories and your group was among those portrayed (Walking on a Thin Line). My question is about your great vocals, I wondered if you ever had lessons or is it natural ability, when you belt out those big powerful notes like in “Sometimes, bad is bad” and “Hip to be square”? Take care Huey.\n\nJeff Kelly\n\nAnswer:\n\nThanks for your kind words, Jeff. It’s all just natural with me. I did go to a vocal coach early in my time with Clover (we all did), but I only attended one session.\n\nMarch 13, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuey, your father encouraged you to take a year off before starting college to do some traveling. You found your way and passion thru your travels playing the harmonica. Do you think you would’ve found your path as a serious musician if you went straight to college?\n\nEllen Lang\n\nAnswer:\n\nI suspect not. Of course we’ll never know, but the year off was a enlightening, and showed me a new path.\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat impact did Bill Schnee have on the band and can you share a behind the scenes story involving Schnee’s work with the News?\n\nDavid Marks\n\nAnswer:\n\nBill produced our first album, and helped produce Hard at Play. He was introduced to us by our manager Bob Brown who had employed him to produce Pablo Cruise. Unfortunately we never enjoyed much success together although we remain good friends.\n\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nOne of my favorite shows was Hot In Cleveland. You were a highlight in the series. How was it playing your character, Johnny Revere, and working with the great ladies, Wendie Malick, Betty White, Valerie Bertinelli and Jane Leeves?\n\nRegards and best wishes, Alba\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt was really fun. They are all great ladies, and the show was very well written. I got to act in the very last episode (a double episode), and had a dressing room next to Bob Newhart. Got to act and hang out with Bob and Betty White for 2 weeks.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHello. I like the production on your albums (for instance, the rhythm guitar sounds on Picture This) and admire that you produced so many of them. Did any of you have specific production influences or favorite producers, whether they were producing themselves or others? And do you have an opinion of the trend in the Eighties of engineers increasingly becoming producers (at least in certain genres)?\n\nJeff Falk\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe were more a fan of certain records, rather than the producers, but certainly recognized great producers. I worked with Mutt Lange in my previous band (Clover), and he might be the most successful producer of the last 30 years. I learned a lot from him, and we’re still friends today.\n\nThe trend of engineers becoming producers makes sense when you consider the technological advances and who is most apt to take advantage of them. Today pro-toolers are the most important and most in demand.\n\nFebruary 13, 2023Question:\n\nI am a longtime fan and have seen you several times in concert. There is nothing better than seeing you and The News perform your music live. I have had the opportunity to meet you once and I cannot begin to tell you the positive impact that you have had in the most difficult times in my life. Thank you for that. How did the advancements in technology change your approach to writing music over the years if at all? Did you approach your debut album differently than you did your latest release Weather?\n\nKeith Tozlian\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. Our debut album was simply “captured” in the studio. Our Sports album was cut with more technology (some drum machine and synthesizers), as was Weather.\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nI read where you describe music as sounding like a “cacaphony” in your head now. My question is: Does that apply only to music where there are several instruments playing at once and, if so, could you still sing those wonderful multi-part harmonies acapella?\n\nDonnita\n\nAnswer:\n\nI can sing by myself, but I can’t hear pitch well enough to sing TO anything. So, no, I couldn’t sing with the boys acapella.\n\nJanuary 30, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuey, do/did you know anyone from Van Halen personally?\n\nGreg – New Fairfield, CT\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, but I opened for them in my previous band (Clover), and of course, I admired them a lot.\n\nJanuary 23, 2023Question:\n\nHey Huey! I’m a 15yo boy that for some odd reason loves your era of music. What music did you enjoy as a youngster?Archie, NSW Australia\n\nAnswer:\n\nI was an R&B snob until I joined my first college band and had to play more commercial stuff. That taught me that although I preferred to listen to certain types of music (R&B), all music was fun to play!\n\nJanuary 16, 2023\n\nQuestion:\n\nIn your song, “Thank You #19,” you make reference to a song by Marvin Gaye. What specific song are you referencing. Oh, and by the way, what a GREAT song! My boyfriend played it for me and, well, I melted!\n\nShanna Smith\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo specific song … I referenced his live album called “Thanks.”\n\nJanuary 9, 2023 Question: Hi! I’m 24 years old, you are one of my favorite artists. I’m finding this age at this time to be so strange. What was being 24 like for you? If you could talk to younger Huey, is there anything you would tell him? Have your priorities changed over time with perspective? Margaux\n\nAnswer:\n\nGreat question. At 24, I was playing music 6 nights a week in clubs. I was laser focused on trying to make a living playing music. If I could have told a young Huey anything, it would be to relax and enjoy the journey because it work out.\n\nJanuary 2, 2023 Question: So I always wondered which music video was your favorite to film. Kristen Helkowski\n\nAnswer:\n\nProbably the 2 we did before we got signed to a record contract. That would be “Some of MyLies are True”, and “Don’t Ever Tell Me That You Love Me”. Also 2 of my favorite songs.\n\nDecember 19, 2022\n\nQuestion: Hi Huey, l saw you played harmonica and backing vocals on Jimmy Barnes’ song ‘l wanna get started with you’. How did you happen to play on that one song?\n\nCharles Coates\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe asked me. I met him in Australia when we toured there. Great guy.\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI understand that you had to change the name of your band from Huey Lewis and the American Express to Huey Lewis and the News. My question though is why the News? What does the News have to do with anything that you’re doing?\n\nAllen Martin\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn order to confuse people as to why we were called The News?\n\nDecember 5, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nDoes anyone in your camp still have access to the recordings of “Heart of Rock and Roll” where you give a shout out to other cities? Specifically I’d love to hear the St. Louis one.\n\nMike Sieli\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe don’t, and never have. The record label (Chrysalis, then) would, but who knows where they’d be, and, since they are analog, even if they would play without being baked or treated someway. I suspect that there’s some 2-tracks of them somewhere in the Universal Music Vault.\n\nNovember 28, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs that you playing an uncredited role in Rock n’ Roll High School (as well as “Who Cares” appearing in the film)? How did you get connected with the Ramones and how was that final scene with the concert/ explosion? Mike S.\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately, I think you have me mixed up with someone else. I would have welcomed the opportunity.\n\nNovember 21, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nYou were my first concert in NJ when I was five at the PNC Arts Center and am still thankful you played before Chicago, otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to stay up so late back then. Is there a genre of music that you like to listen to that most people wouldn’t have guessed? How about any up-and-coming artists that interest you? Brandon Lutz\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t hear music anymore. Since I lost my hearing 4 1/2 years ago, I can’t enjoy music. It’s cacophony. But, I used to love to listen to jazz. Straight ahead jazz. From Old Big Band, to Bop.\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nLove the emotion of the song “Tell Me a Little Lie.” Was it based on a real relationship/break up?\n\nSal Montalbano\n\nAnswer:\n\nUh … no … made it all up, I’m afraid. But, I have felt that way, so I guess there’s that.\n\nNovember 7, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nDuets was such a cool movie, think you might act again? Would love to see you on the big screen. Will never forget seeing you at the mid-state fair in the 80s; small venue, fantastic music!\n\nHelen Bowers\n\nAnswer:\n\nOnly if they ask me! Seriously, I find acting very rewarding if the material is good. Duh.\n\nOctober 31, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nJust read Dave Grohl’s book and he mentioned a time when you hung out with him in Japan and you played a toy harmonica with the Foo Fighters. Can you elaborate on that that night? How fun was that for you?\n\nChris, Nashville, TN\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt was a really fun night. We were already fans, but to get to know them a little was a treat. We all wentout to dinner together after the show. Dave Grohl is a huge talent who wears it exceptionally well.\n\nOctober 24, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve been a fan forever ! It was awesome to catch you fishing on tv. I’ve been a fisherman in Florida for 30 plus years and love to sight fish. What’s your favorite fish to fish for and type of fishing? Jason – Ormond Beach, FL\n\nAnswer:\n\nI love to fly fish for trout, Bonefish, Tarpon, Permit, Snook and Redfish. I grew up fishing for trout, so I suppose that might be my favorite, but I love salt water fishing as well, and am looking forward to doing a lot more.\n\nOctober 17, 2022\n\nQuestion: How did you get into acting? Growing up did you imagine acting in your future?\n\nLisa Hoogervorst – Phoenix, AZ\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo. I met an agent who was a fan and told me he thought I’d be a great actor. He got me my first role in “Shortcuts” the Robert Altman picture. Working with Altman was like acting school.\n\nOctober 10, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuey, Bill, and co.,\n\nI’m a writer and author near Washington, DC, and am working on a major biography about Creedence Clearwater Revival to be published by Hachette Books next year. In my interviews with the band, I was told that they used to play football with Clover in SF in 1972–and that Huey broke his collarbone in one of these games. Can someone confirm this detail? It’d be a good one to include if it’s accurate. Thank you!\n\nJohn Lingan\n\nAnswer:\n\nAll true. I was trying to cover Doug Clifford on a pass play.\n\nOctober 3, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is your favorite leisure activity ie. Golf, Fishing, Hunting, Hiking, Horseback riding, Travel or ?\n\nCurious in Kiawah\n\nAnswer:Fly Fishing, Golf, Horseback riding.\n\nSeptember 26 2022 Question:\n\nWhat’s your favorite acting role or acting moment? Did you ever plan to go into acting, or did it sort of happen unexpectedly because of Back to the Future?\n\nLisa Hoogervorst – Phoenix\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately, my favorite acting moments ended up on the cutting floor. Gwenyth Paltrow and I had 4 or 5 scenes cut from the film “Duets” because it was too long, and 2 of them were my favorite.\n\nSeptember 19, 2022 Question:\n\nHey Huey, I’ll tread lightly here with this question. You said you didn’t want to do music for Ghostbusters and you didn’t. What was it about Back to the Future that you liked enough to provide two songs for?\n\nSam Bennett\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt was all about timing. The Ghostbuster song was proposed right in the middle of our Sports album’s long run. We were busy on the road, and they wanted the song to be called “Ghostbusters” which I wasn’t fond of. BTTF wanted any original song with no parameters, and the timing was perfect for us. It was between albums, and bought us some time to write.\n\nSeptember 12, 2022Question:\n\nJumping off of the drum riser platform at the start and having the Tower Of Power Horns made it even more exciting! You also created a version of the song with Garth Brooks. Is there anyone else you’d like to collaborate with on this song or any other?\n\nMatt Zeugin – Valley Springs, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nWell, it’s a mute point now that I’ve lost my hearing. But I’m a big fan of George Strait, and I have a couple countryish songs that I’d love to hear him sing.\n\nSeptember 5, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nRelatively new fan here aged 24, And I just can’t stop sharing your music with Friends and Family right now, So much so that I have just bought a Harmonica and am about to begin ‘THAT’ journey for myself…Just hoping for a few pointers or suggestions if possible as to how best get a start in playing the Harp – I have gone for the Standard C Diatonic and would love to know a few things from your good-self as to how best approach starting.\n\nCheers, Sam Willis\n\nAnswer:\n\nCongratulations …. You’ll never be a loner now! Honestly, I’d suggest taking a few lessons to get started, and listen to Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Big Walter Horton, and Charlie McCoy.\n\nAugust 29, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nAfter the smash success of Sports, I was mind blown with Fore back in the day. Outside of the rock numbers, “Whole Lotta Lovin’” and “Naturally” remain personal faves. 😉 Will Fore ever be given the deluxe remaster treatment like Sports was, and would there be any unreleased tracks or live material from that period that us fans may not have yet heard?\n\nThanks and cheers from Down Under,\n\nWardy\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt’s possible that Fore will get remastered at some point … I always wished we could remix it … it’s one of our only records not mixed by Bob Clearmountain and I’d love to hear his version.\n\nAugust 8, 2022 Question:\n\nHi Huey. I recently bought a few of your albums on vinyl including the first album. I know it wasn’t a huge hit, but I quite like the album. Especially ‘Don’t Make Me Do It’. I would like to know which song on the album you’re most proud of. Just curious where that video was filmed. Looks like the landfill in Granda Hills area. Thank you. You’re my hero by the way.\n\nUnknown\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m not allowed to play favorites since I produced the record, but I quite like “Some of My Lies”, “Don’t Ever Tell Me That You Love Me”, and “Hearts.” “Some Of My Lies” video was shot at Ocean Beach in San Francisco, and “Don’t Ever Tell Me” was filmed at the Mountain Amphitheater on Mt. Tamalpais.\n\nAugust 1, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi, Huey, i love your songs, your voice, your sense of humor. Lately i found out your Mother was Polish. I would like to ask if you’ ve ever been to Poland and speak a little bit polish. Malgorzata from Poland\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, although my mother was born in Poland, I’ve never been there, and I speak no Polish. But,\n\nI am smart, artistic, funny and loyal, like all Polish people!\n\nJuly 18, 2022Question:\n\nWhat was your favorite song to play live during your tours in the 1980s? I saw you guys multiple times during that amazing decade and it was always obvious that you and the band were having the time of your lives together on stage. But if you had to pick one song that you and the band most enjoyed performing live in those days, what was it?\n\nAnswer:\n\nJon, I’ll bet you’re a nice guy, and, you live in a gorgeous place, but that’s an impossible question.\n\nHonestly, asking the band their favorite song on even one night might elicit 6 different answers.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nYou often say that a big part of the band’s longevity is how much you and the guys enjoy each other’s company. So, who’s the funniest guy in the News? I’m gonna guess Sean after seeing the Doing it all for my baby video.\n\nAnswer:\n\nReally? I say that often? The funniest; Me. No, actually it’s a toss up between Sean and John Pierce.\n\nJuly 5, 2022\n\nWhich album do you feel was your best. Why?\n\nDavid Hooker – DeLand, Florida\n\nAnswer:\n\nOur latest “Weather”. But, I always think of our most recent work as the best. It really is among our bestwork, however. Of that I’m sure.\n\nJune 27, 2022What band or musician do you contribute your inspirations in writing of songs? And have any of your children ever been interested in following some aspects of the industry of music?Anne\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot sure I understand the first question, but neither of my children work in the music industry per say, but they both are keen music lovers, and my son is a pretty good guitar player.\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was thrilled and still flattered that my suggestion for doing “A Little Bit of Soap” a capella was done in your shows. (Thanks Sean!) Did the band ever take any other fan suggestions for a cappella and do it on stage?Vic Dubrow – Indianapolis, IN\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe honest answer is, I don’t know, especially since I never knew that it was your idea to do “A Little Bit of Soap.”\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\nQuestion:Hi Huey, when are you going to be on tv again? I saw you on the Blacklist show. You were very good and funny.\n\nLinda Shaskas\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo telling, but I am in show business, which means I’ll do anything for attention or money! Hahaha.\n\nJune 6, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI know most of the News came from Clover and Sound hole, but how did you guys meet Chris Hayes?\n\nChad Elzy\n\nAnswer:\n\nI was introduced to him by a mutual friend called Donald Maus. Don was a jazz bass player and he had played a lot with Chris.\n\nMay 31, 2022Question:\n\nWhat is your impressions of the mashup of Metallica’s ‘Enter Sandman’ and ‘Hip To Be Square’ ?\n\nMaxwell\n\nAnswer:\n\nI don’t like the fact that anyone can take “content” that has been conceived, accomplished (filmed and paid for), and then use it however they want without even consent, let alone compensation. I have nothing against Metallica, and, in fact, know and like both James and Lars, but I think the whole exercise is ridiculous.\n\nMay 16, 2022\n\nQuestion:I’m a long time fan from Jamaica. I think my chin hit the floor when I heard you guys play give a nod to my little island and played reggae on Bobo Tempo 🙂 I just never understood what the song was about, apparently it’s a California thing. Can you explain and also what got you into reggae?\n\nGreg – Guatemala City, Guatemala\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe movie “The Harder They Come” with Jimmy Cliff was a huge influence, and got me/us into reggae. The song is about a town called Bolinas which all locals refer to as Bobo.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nHello Huey, I’m 13 years old and I was wondering how you or the band members came up with “The News” as your name. Do you know who chose that name?\n\nSears\n\nAnswer:\n\nI did. We were calling ourselves Huey Lewis and American Express, and just before the release of our first album, the record label got worried we’d be sued over the name. We had literally 24 hours to come up with a name, and The News was as good as we could do.o.\n\nMay 2, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nDid you play at the 1973 Tam High Prom on a Ferry Boat that left from Tiburon? If you did, was that Clover? The music grabbed me and I had to dance which I had never done before. If that was you, take credit for getting an introvert to break out and boogie. Haven’t stopped. (I am the guy who was in your brother’s class at Richardson Bay and at Tam. I think he sent you the picture of us on our teacher’s sailboat on SF Bay in 1965-66.)\n\nDavid Healy\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m not sure. I know HLN did a very early gig on the Ferry Boat, and, I do vaguely recall an earlier ferry gig with Clover, but thetruth is, I can’t remember…\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nBesides the News, what group/artist do you like listening to most from the 80s?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI can’t listen to music anymore because of my hearing. I literally can’t tell one song from another. It’s been a bitter pill to swallow. I must remind myself that there are so many others worse off than I, and I’m still a lucky guy.\n\nApril 18, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhere is your good spot to fly fish in the Caribbean?\n\nTracy Pitts\n\nAnswer:\n\nA smart fisherman never gives away his secret spots! There are innumerable good spots in the Caribbean. My advice is always to hire a guide, at least til you learn the lay of the land.\n\nApril 11, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy wife and I have a 24 y/o daughter with Cerebral Palsy. She loves the cartoons on Disney Jr, especially T.O.T.S. and Puppy Dog Pals. We love you as Bullworth, and I’m really curious as to how you became involved with the show. Did they reach out to you, or did your representative contact them.\n\nDennis, Lauren, and of course, K\n\nAnswer:\n\nThey reached out to me, and I love doing it. It’s fun.\n\nApril 4, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nWas the band ever close to performing during halftime at a Super Bowl? What was the biggest sporting event at which the band sang the National Anthem?\n\nDerek Hayden\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe never did a Super Bowl halftime. Did anthems for lots of football and baseball playoff games (NFC Championship,NLCS etc.), and baseball and basketball All Star games.\n\nMarch 28, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve been loving your ‘80’s radio show on Apple Music! I’m also thrilled to know you’re a fellow Stevie Wonder fan. Do you have any favorite Stevie albums? (I know it’s hard to choose…)\n\nMaggie Frantz – Alameda, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt’s too hard to choose. I think Stevie Wonder is far and away the most important musical artist of our generation. And, I’m getting ready to do another season of Huey’s 80’s Radio on Apple Music. I’m going to have some very cool guests.\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI heard you mention that you’ve been reading a lot during the pandemic. Any book recommendations?\n\nMary Wacker\n\nAnswer:\n\nI just finished “Wrecking Crew” about LA session musicians. It’s fabulous, and a page turner. “The Overstory” by Richard Powers is smart and informative.\n\nMarch 14, 2022Question:\n\nI saw your recent post on Facebook regarding your dad’s love for jazz music and was curious who he liked to listen to. My dad played trombone with Woody Herman for several years, among others. Do you have any jazz favorites?\n\nMarcie Collins\n\nAnswer:\n\nI love Chick Webb, and old Count Basie. My Dad loved Woody Herman, and took me to see him a couple times … I wonder if your dad was on the bandstand.\n\nMarch 7, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow involved are you and the band choosing each album’s singles? Would you deliver an album to the label and they’d go “Heart & Soul” is first, “Drug” second, or “Small World” instead of “Old Antone’s,” or whatever, or did you have any (or all) say?\n\nJames Kenney\n\nAnswer:\n\nA little. Usually the label picks the singles, but it’s sometimes fairly obvious. It’s a strategy, of course, and sometimes they get it right (Sports), and sometimes get it wrong (Picture This, where “Workin’” should have been the 2nd single).\n\nFebruary 28, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat I really liked about your concerts many years ago were your support groups.\n\nI can remember Bruce Hornsby and the Range and Melissa Etheridge. Just wonderful.\n\nQuestion: Did you choose these artists or was your management doing it?\n\nCan you give me 2-3 others Singer/Bands names that impressed you?\n\nGreetings from Swiss-Italian region.\n\nMauro Londero\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe did. We also took Stevie Ray Vaughan and the Neville Brothers on national tours. Very proud of that.\n\nFebruary 21, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nYour talent and energy has affected and influenced so many people. I am in a Huey tribute and wondered why you don’t continue to pursue your harp playing during your battle with Meniere’s disease? You are truly one of the best harp players I have ever listened to. Also, been trying for some time to purchase a few harmonicas from Anthony Dannecker and his website just says, “coming soon.” Any advice on an alternative choice to Dannecker harmonicas?\n\nBrian – Temecula, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nMy hearing is so bad, I can’t find pitch … therefore, I can’t bend notes in tune. Harmonica is not like a piano. You need an ear to be in tune. Also, it’s a struggle … definitely no fun. Cacophony.\n\nFebruary 14, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat year did you open for the Doobie Brothers at the Oakland Colosseum Arena?\n\nLee Prevost\n\nAnswer:\n\nHuey: I think it was 1980, but Bill has a much better memory than I.\n\nBill: 1980\n\nJanuary 31, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was listening to a live show from 1988 in Birmingham, England where you mention to the crowd that you were recording the show. My questions are what kind of live archive does HLN have and will we ever be able to hear these complete classic shows? The live cuts on the Sports 30th Anniversary bonus disc sound great and I think a lot of people would love to have access to complete shows from throughout your history available!\n\nChris Burke\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe have some stuff. Most is still in analog form, but Johnny is baking the tapes, and transferring it to the digital domain. Once we get that done, we can begin to assess what we have. I’m sure something will be available sometime. (Sorry if that’s a little vague.)\n\nJanuary 24, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nA few years back, I heard HLN in Raleigh, and that night Huey gave a ‘Tip of The Hat’ to beach music, which is sort of an R&B/Soul sub-genre that’s popular almost exclusively in the southeast. You guys do quite a few covers that would be considered in that genre (But It’s Alright, Never Found A Girl, It’s Alright, Green Grass and others). Being a west coast band, how did you discover Beach Music, and what can you add to the Beach Music story? That flavor of music certainly is a natural fit for the blue-eyed soul HLN is known for!\n\nJohn Hackney – Wilson, NC\n\nAnswer:\n\nI went to Prep School in New Jersey, and had a lot of southern guys as classmates. I always liked soul music, and after all, that’s what Beach music is. I still love the Tams, General Johnson, Clifford Curry, and all those great beach music bands.\n\nJanuary 17, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve heard Billy Joel mention on a few occasions that as a great piano player, he still wishes he could play the ivories…like his hero…Jazz Great…Oscar Peterson. As a great Harmonica Player, is there any harp player that you wish you could play more like?\n\nBen Kent\n\nAnswer:\n\nSeveral. My hero was always James Cotton, but Howard Levy is probably the most accomplished harp (diatonic harmonica) player I’ve ever heard.\n\nJanuary 10, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was in university when “Sports” exploded. Did you know after recording the album how popular many of the songs would become?\n\nRob Christian\n\nAnswer:\n\nI wish I had. I would have relaxed a little bit!\n\nJanuary 3, 2022\n\nQuestion:\n\nPerforming a capella songs and being in amazing polyphonic sync, just like on “Naturally” or “Bad Is Bad”, has always been one of your greatest merits. I especially like your rendition of “So Much In Love” from the early 80s. What’s your favorite a capella song?\n\nNiklas Nowak – Germany\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot sure. I like “So in Love’ a lot, and always thought that “This is dedicated … to the one I love” would’ve been great acapella, but we never got around to working it up.\n\nDecember 27, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHello! I’m in a debate with my mom right now about my first concert (you) and when it was. You guys played a free concert at Camp Pendleton with Sheila E. We conflict on what year that was (89 or 91). Do you happen to remember? You’ll settle a mother/daughter bet and we will forever be grateful (and fans). Thanks!\n\nJulie Suarez\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou have to be kidding me. Julie, I’m much too old to remember that far back. Bill Gibson is the only guy I can think of who might be able to settle your argument. Sorry. – Huey\n\nI couldn’t be certain . Lol Halsey could probably tell you. – Bill\n\nI’d have to look in my basement as my computer only goes back to 1993. – Lol\n\nDecember 20, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy question is, as, unfortunately you currently aren’t singing. Have you consider collating some live releases from over the years to put out, either, preferably as a physical product?\n\nDerek\n\nAnswer:\n\nQuite possibly. We’re only now sorting through all that we have. We’ll see. Thanks for the impetus.\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy daughter loves music and is interested in playing the harmonica. I figured I ask the best harmonica player I know, what harmonica would you recommend for her to start with? Also, I know that your Meniere’s Disease has severely limited your music capabilities, but are you able to still play the harmonica? BTW, love, love Weather!\n\nAnswer:\n\nI play Dannecker harmonicas. I think they are by far the best commercial harmonica, but they are expensive. A Hohner Marine Band or Special 20 is a good harp to start with.\n\nDecember 6, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nFirst I like to tell you I love your music I bought your new album Weather and absolutely love it. My most favorite song on the album is “Her Love Is Killing Me.” I was thinking why did you name the album Weather? Just wondering and sorry about your hearing loss hope your hearing gets better.\n\nAndrew Stahl\n\nAnswer:\n\nHuey Lewis and the NEWS … SPORTS … WEATHER.\n\nNovember 29, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve noticed that starting from 2005 or so, you guys started performing Hip as “(Too) Hip to be Square.” Was there any reason for the name change?\n\nRandy K.\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question. I originally wrote the song in the third person; “He used to be a renegade …etc.”, but thought it would be funnier (or more ironic) if I told it on myself. Some people took it as a kind of anthem for square people, and so I began to fool with the title.\n\nNovember 22, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nIn a few of your recent interviews, you had mentioned how “One of the Boys” is a song that describes your life, but I noticed that “Finally Found a Home” also seems to do the same. Is this the case?\n\nMatt Zeugin – Valley Springs, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nNovember 15, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nAs a child of the 80s, I’ve always been a fan of the live “Trouble In Paradise” that appeared on the USA For Africa album. It’s a great song, a terrific performance, and the message is fantastic. The problem is, I’ve never figured out the final verse. “Five long years since I wrote this song, many people dying, so many gone.” What’s the next line after that? The lyrics I found online don’t make any sense, so I thought I’d go straight to the source.\n\nGeorge\n\nAnswer:\n\nI was never happy with that line, and I would change it when we played it live. I tried a number of phrasing ideas, but, something like “I’ve said it before but it’s still good advice” …\n\nNovember 8, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have heard the live versions of “Free Love” that were kicking around in 89 or so…what led you to bring in Nick Lowe and change up the song a bit? Did he mostly work on lyrics with you? Is the “Do You Love Me, or What?” line his?\n\nJames Kenney\n\nAnswer:\n\nNick had nothing to do with that tune. I can barely remember it! “Do you love me or what?” was my convoluted idea. I now look upon that tune as a good try!\n\nOctober 25, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nAm I imagining this memory, or did baseball great George Brett sit in with the horn section at a show in the 1980s? Also, did you know Darrell Evans when he played for the giants?\n\nGabe – San Rafael, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, George “sat in” with the horn section pretending to play horn. We had a very late night that night (baseball was on strike), and then heard that baseball strike had just been settled about 1:00 AM. George got up earliesh the following day and went 5 for 8 in a double header.\n\n\\October 18, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was watching some clips of you guys singing the National Anthem, and it’s amazing how you all sang a fantastic acapella arrangement (especially your high notes!) in such a different environment from your shows. Was performing the anthem for a huge sporting event in a huge stadium a completely different experience than singing for a regular live show, or would you say it’s around the same?\n\nRandy K – Sunnyvale, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nSimilar, but different in that the song (Anthem) isn’t very “groovy”, and is therefore difficult, and the venue (stadium) is not the easiest to negotiate sound wise. But, it only lasts 2 minutes and we get great seats to the game!\n\nOctober 11, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI recently saw the cover for the 1965 Paul Butterfield Blues Band album and it reminded me of the Fore album cover. Was your photo a subtle reference to that influential album?\n\nJason Tresser\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, it was a complete rip off. Good call.\n\nOctober 4, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’d like to know if Huey and the band remembers appearing at an evening concert in a club in Chappaqua NY, next to the railroad tracks? I was still living in NY, so it had to be in 1980, since that’s when they started using the name Huey Lewis and the News. I had never heard of the band, but I went and stayed for the whole show. Six years later, I was at Camp Lejeune with the Marines, and would walk to the mall along the railroad tracks with Huey and the news on my walk-man cassette player giving me such positive vibes and a beat to walk by. I hear their tunes now, and it takes me right back, THANKS!\n\nPaul Martinello – Somers, CT\n\nAnswer:\n\nI almost remember that club gig. Meaning, I don’t really remember it specifically, but I do remember a small club near the railroad tracks from our Workin’ for a Living Tour in ‘82.\n\nSeptember 27, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho was better to jam with? Umphrey’s, Foo Fighters, or Grateful Dead?\n\nSean – Morton Grove, IL\n\nAnswer:\n\nSilly question. Three great bands, wildly different, and all big fun to sit in with.\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuge fan since ‘Picture This’ came out. Wondering how you feel about tribute band’s performing your music?\n\nRoger Langdon\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m flattered, and love to see the music live on, especially since I can’t hear well enough to sing anymore.\n\nSeptember 13, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI found it interesting you list Newport as one of your favorite courses, mine too. It is interesting that when they were awarded the US Am that Tiger won they were told not to put in irrigation or they would lose the event. Have you ever played Fishers Island or played in Ireland? I was a teacher for 35 years and used “The Heart…” to introduce US Geography. Thanks for making my life happier.\n\nJames Doherty\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have never played Fisher’s Island, although I know all about it. And, I’ve never played in Ireland, I’m embarrassed to admit, although I’ve had some fabulous times there.\n\nSeptember 6, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nIn the summer of 1982, I stood inline behind Huey at JC Penny’s in Corte Madera Shopping Center. I approached Huey after his purchase and said “You’re Huey Lewis.” You were more surprised I knew you than I was at knowing who you were. Had a nice 5 minute conversation after which a lady came up to me and asked “Huey Newton and the who?” I told her Huey Lewis. Picture This had come out and you were just hitting it big. In our short conversation, I thought you mentioned a photo shoot for an album cover in which you and the News were “News Broadcasters”. Standing in front green screen, at the sports desk, etc. Was there ever such a shoot?\n\nJohn Quinn\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt seems like there must have been, right? I mean, it’s an obvious idea. I do remember a shoot at Channel 7 in San Francisco, but it wasn’t for an album cover. I can’t remember what it was for, but it was around that time, so maybe that’s it.\n\n*note: This photo can be found in the photo gallery “Early News” in the Photos section of this website.\n\nAugust 30, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI watched your interview on Jimmy Kimmel and enjoyed your stories so much! What I loved most was how music really served as an international language for you as you hitchhiked across Europe. Wondering, if you would consider writing a memoir?\n\nKaren George\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have, but it’s a lot of work, and I guess I’m lazy. Maybe one day.\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nKudos to your band mate Bill for the recent heartfelt tribute to late drummer Neil Peart of Rush.\n\nRush also has a song titled ‘Jacob’s Ladder’. Have you heard it?\n\nDarren\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have not, unfortunately. And I won’t be able to until my hearing changes.\n\nAugust 16, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nDid the 60’s band The Rascals have an influence on you? I would love to hear you cover “Groovin’” or “It’s A Beautiful Morning.”\n\nRobert Wright\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot really, but I loved them. I love Felix’s voice … great singer.\n\nAugust 9, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI enjoyed the Weather album, one of the real standouts is “Remind Me Why I Love You Again,” which is a real R&B funk jam. I’ve heard you guys touch on funk with “Attitude” and “Do You Love Me or What?” from Hard at Play, and Clover had “Chicken Funk.” Who are your funk influences?\n\nGreg, Guatemala City\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt all started with James Brown and Sly Stone for me.\n\nAugust 2, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe song “Heart and Soul” starts out with the lyric “Two o’clock this morning”, my question is was this line inspired by the 2AM Club where the cover photo for Sports was taken?\n\nRyan Gray\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately no. That tune was written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn.\n\nJuly 26, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI often was the ball boy when my father would umpire at Lawrenceville, and when I played at Notre Dame later would tell them you were the same guy that was the clutch player at L’ville. My father was a birddog for 2 or 3 scouts, SO the question is what happened at Cornell that you stopped playing and went to Europe…. baseball was who you were at Lawrenceville and you were looked at by plenty of teams.\n\nBruce Brown\n\nAnswer:\n\nMy father insisted I take a year off between high school and college and “bum around Europe” (his words). I was already playing harmonica, and after a year was determined to pursue music, so I never even went out for the team at Cornell.\n\nView Page\n\nJuly 19, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow did you get from San Francisco to the Lawrenceville School? And then to Cornell— do feel you missed out on growing up in the Bay Area during the late 1960s by being on the east coast? Which circle house were you in at Lville?\n\nJohn Henderson\n\nAnswer:\n\nMy father convinced me it was a good idea. I was in Hamill House. I didn’t miss much about the Bay Area as I was there all summer and vacations.\n\nJuly 12, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuey, I have been a fan since when I was 7 years old. I’m now 13. My dad constantly had your cassette tapes in the car and we would listen to them. At school, I kept on banging the pencils against the table and they would break… (mainly your songs). I eventually got my first drum set (which was a kid’s set) on Christmas of 2014. I can remember using the drum set to mainly play your songs. Two questions: Why is the single version of NOW HERE’S YOU sound different than the one on the album and did you ever play IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME YOU’LL LET ME in concert?\n\nGregory – New Fairfield, CT\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have no idea why the single sounds different than the album version. I’m guessing Bill Schnee who produced our first record did a remix for the single. And, yes, I believe we played IYRLYL live but only a time or two.\n\nJuly 5, 2021\n\nDo you remember those times when HLN performed at The Bodega Club in Campbell, CA (no longer exists) and another favorite, The Catalyst in Santa Cruz, CA, and when you guys would sing a capella at an after party in Carmel… “Under the Boardwalk”? A lot of years since those days have gone by but those are all good times and memories .\n\nJulie – San Jose, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes. Of course, I don’t remember any of those gigs as much as I once did, hahaha, but they were good times.\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nMy all-time favorite film is “Back To The Future”. How long did it take in wardrobe and makeup to disguise yourself for your role as the band audition judge? It must have been a wonderful experience to work with that cast and crew. From a fan who will never think you’re “too darn loud”, thank you so much.\n\nNicholas Malfitano\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot long. The scene was shot at night because Michael J Fox was working on a network show during the day, and BTTF had to be shot at night. Bob Zemekis, and Bob Gale were so great to work with, and Michael was and is a prince.\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat can you say about the Small World recording sessions? Do you plan to make a deluxe version? It’s one of my favourite LPs from Huey Lewis & The News! And not only because you said some french word on a song on it!\n\nArnaud – Paris, France\n\nAnswer:\n\nSo glad to hear you like that record. I do too. I also think Stan Getz’s solo on “Small World Part 2” is brilliant. It was so great to work with him. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have split the song up into 2 parts. There is a single edit somewhere that we did, which is, I think, the definitive version of the song. BTW, “Small World” was awarded “worst album of the year” by Rolling Stone.\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy question is why was the song “So Little Kindness” included on both “Time Flies” and “Plan B”? Was it re-recorded for “Plan B” and if so, why?\n\nJen Bosley – Philadelphia, PA\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe weren’t real happy with the Time Flies collection, and felt like “So Little Kindness” was lost on that record, and belonged on the Plan B record, so we re-recorded it. We own that master record (Plan B), and wanted SLK to be included.\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Huey, I am a great fan, and also a great fan of Phil Lynott. I know you guys recorded stuff together and have just istened to your version of The Boys are Back in Town (a great version by the way). My question is are there any plans to release the recordings that you and Phil did. Given the resurgence in all thigs Lizzy it would be a shame if they were not released for us all to enjoy?\n\nGeoff Thompson\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think so … the tunes were never finished … Phillip was hoping to return to finish up the vocals.\n\nMay 24, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\n1) How did you get from San Francisco to the Lawrenceville School? 2) And then to Cornell— do feel youmissed out on growing up in the Bay Area during the late 1960s by being on the east coast? 3) Which circle house were you in at Lville?\n\nJohn Henderson\n\nAnswer:\n\n1) By airplane. 2) I was home summers, and I graduated Lawrenceville in 1967, and took a year off before college, so I got to experience plenty of west coast. 3) You mean there isn’t a plaque? Hamill.\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nJust heard “Back In Time” on the radio and I was wondering at what point in the film production process did you write the song. It clearly has direct reference to the story line of the film.\n\nPete West\n\nAnswer:\n\n“Back in Time” was written after I saw a rough cut of the film. “Power of Love” was written before the film was shot.\n\nMay 10, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\n“Give Me the Keys (And I’ll Drive You Crazy)” is one of my favorite songs from you and your band and my pick for most underrated. I adore the frenetic pace!! Was there any sort of inspiration or influence for writing the song? Was a music video ever made for the song\n\nJL\n\nAnswer:\n\nThat phrase was coined by our assistant manager Steve Lewis (no relation), who unfortunately, is no longer with us. We did the rest, and yes, there was a goofy video done for the song.\n\nMay 3, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nOne of my favourite songs released as a single is ‘World to Me’. I know it wasn’t one of the groups best selling releases and I was wondering why a video was never made for this song.\n\nJeremy Keane\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m not sure it was released as a single, but I agree with you, Jeremy. It’s one of my favorite tunes as well. It’s featured beautifully in our new musical “The Heart of Rock and Roll” which we hope to present on Broadway soon.\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have seen numerous concerts of yours, dating back to the 80’s when you toured with Tower of Power. That show was in Weedsport, NY, an outdoor venue at a dirt race track. One of my favorite concerts ever! I think my favorite part of all of the concerts was when you would do an a cappella song. What is your favorite song that you and the band did a cappella?\n\nJennifer in Alaska\n\nAnswer:\n\nI suppose I’d have to say “They Say It’s Alright”, only because it was released on a Curtis Mayfield tribute album, was the single and was an adult contemporary hit.\n\nApril 19, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nWith the announcement of the 7-song WEATHER, I was wondering about lost songs that have either been mentioned or appeared in the past. Whatever happened to the rest of the Back in Blue session songs, as well as songs like “Sell Out” “Just an Hour in Memphis” “You Hurt Me” (am I getting that title correct? From around 2008) “I’m Only In It For The Money” and any other lost songs? A b-sides and rarities release would be ideal for such treasures.\n\nJeff M – Asheville, NC\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question. I suppose most of them aren’t as good as we remember them, or as they should be, or they would have appeared on one of our albums, but it might be interesting to reconsider. I’ll give it a think. Thanks.\n\nApril 12, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI was wondering: Did you give a lot of thought to the cover images of your LPs or was it usually a spontaneous endeavor? I am a big fan of “Picture This” (both the cover image AND the music, haha), maybe you could elaborate on the cover image of this one.\n\nNiklas – Germany\n\nAnswer:\n\nNothing much to elaborate on. The record company wanted a close up of me for the cover, and I thought it would be cool if it was an enlarged shot of me as part of a group shot on the back, and the idea flowed from there.\n\nApril 5, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve been a fan for over 30 years and I’ve been to see you on nearly every UK tour. I briefly met you and the band a couple of times and those are special memories. I look on YouTube now and then to see if there is any footage of you and the band that I have not see before. Last week I found a clip of you and Phil Lynott on the UK TV show ‘The Old Grey Whistle Test’, you were playing harmonica on one of his songs. I know that you were both great friends. What puzzled me though is that you were introduced on that show with a totally different name, not even your real name. I think the clip is from 1979. Were you going incognito, or was it some kind of inside joke?\n\nSally Hickling\n\nAnswer:\n\nProbably trying to dodge the work permit thing. That was all Phillip and his manager’s doing.\n\nMarch 29, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nWith the exception of your bandmates, whom have you performed with that gave you a ‘My life is now complete’ moment?\n\nColleen Young\n\nAnswer:\n\nStevie Wonder, and half of the folks on We Are the World.\n\nMarch 22, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Huey! Who is your all time favorite San Francisco Giant?\n\nMark Sarley\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot even close. Willie Mays.\n\nMarch 15, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI miss the music and the tours and continue to pray for a recovery and comeback. But in the meantime. Have you considered doing more voice work in animation? I know you have done puppy dogs pals. And that’s an Easter egg for parents I hope. No one can mistake that voice and the value attached. But I do hope that, in leiu of recording music, that you will lend your voice to more animated projects or just acting in general.\n\nCory\n\nAnswer:\n\nFrom your lips to Disney/Pixar’s ears.\n\nMarch 8, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m trying to be a singer just like you I know how to sing all your songs and some other bands as well I was wondering if you could tell me what is your favorite song to play live ?\n\nJesse Caceres\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m going to say the new song is always our favorite … that is, whichever songs are the most recently written and performed. I know it kind of dodges the question, but it’s true.\n\nMarch 1, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is your current handicap index?\n\nRussell T. Ries\n\nAnswer:\n\n9.2\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve enjoyed the times I’ve seen you acting. Do you have any upcoming plans to do any acting?\n\nJohn K.\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m open to it if it’s creative. I enjoy acting.\n\n*editors note: Last week, Huey appeared in an episode of NBC’s The Blacklist.\n\nFebruary 15, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nThank you for all the joy you have brought in to the world! I first saw you live at the House of Blues in New Orleans in Feb (it was the first week of Mardi Gras) sometime in the mid 90’s I can’t remember exactly. The show was professionally filmed (big boom cameras, the works). It was a magical evening, one of the greatest shows I have ever seen! I have never been able to find it anywhere. Is it out there somewhere?\n\nTom Outwater\n\nPS- Praying your hearing improves so we can have you back singing!!\n\nAnswer:\n\nI think that may have been an in-house video that they had set up there, but it’s an interesting question. Perhaps they have it somewhere? Not sure.\n\nFebruary 8, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nThanks for helping me grow up in the ‘80s! “Sports” was my fav album in middle school and I still listen to your 80s albums a lot. My question is about “We Are the World”. Were you in awe of anyone in the room? Either by reputation or maybe someone whose voice just knocked your socks off during the recording?\n\nMike Burman – Appleton, WI\n\nAnswer:\n\nRay Charles … I was so nervous, I couldn’t summon the courage to introduce myself to him. I just sort of shadowed him, just to be near the great man.\n\nFebruary 1, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a great fan of yours and I had the chance to enjoy your fantastic concert here in Rome in 1988. Don’t you know that you have lots of fans in Italy? What do you remember from that experience in 1988? How many times did you come to Italy and especially in Rome?\n\nFabrizio Galassi\n\nAnswer:\n\nI remember everything about that show and the days before and after, because I have relatives in Rome who wined and dined me the whole time I was there. It was a wonderful trip only dampened by the sound in that huge stone dome. We’ve played Italy since, but not Rome. Go figure. I love Rome.\n\nJanuary 25, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nCan you talk about how you ended up working with the legendary San Francisco punk band Crime? It’s such an unlikely pairing, and I’d love to know how it came about.\n\nNate K.\n\nAnswer:\n\nPatty Gleason, who managed Different Fur Recording where we had made our demos, suggested me to produce that record. It was fun. They were great guys and way more with the “scene” than I was … I actually learned a lot.\n\nJanuary 18, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi!! Huge fan for more years than I care to admit because that would give away my middle aged status. I know you have a ranch in Montana and wondering what animals you have there? Are there livestock you prefer to raise and what breeds of horses do you like?\n\nJennifer Serling – Tucson AZ\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe fall graze a few black Angus cattle, and we have 4 horses at the moment, 3 quarter horses and a warm blood that we inherited. But mainly we nurture the wildlife. Deer, Elk, ducks, geese, birds etc.\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nWould you ever attend a comic con with fellow BTTF cast members to meet fans and sign autographs?\n\nMatt – Nottingham, P\n\nAnswer:\n\nSure, I mean after all, I am in show business, meaning I’ll do anything for attention or money, (usually in that order). But seriously, I’ve done a few BTTF reunions on TV and in Hollywood theaters, and it’s always fun. Michael J. Fox is a great and a very funny guy.\n\nJanuary 4, 2021\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have been a die hard fan since “Do You Believe in Love” came out back in 1982. You have had some awesome collaborations over the years with Tower of Power and a great duet with Gwyneth Paltrow. Do you have a bucket list of artists that you want to work with and who are they?\n\nAnn Fisher\n\nAnswer:\n\nI lost my hearing almost 3 years ago and haven’t sung with the band since …. I’m hoping I can one day regain enough hearing to sing with the band again.\n\nDecember 28, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve been a fan for pretty much my whole life (and I’m 52). So first of all, thanks for creating such great music that has been the backdrop for some really amazing times in my life. My question is actually about golf. I was watching your shot from the 2019 Pebble Beach Pro-Am where you put it in from the greenside bunker, and I was curious what you consider the strongest part of your game is?\n\nBill Courtney\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnfortunately, the word “strong” or “strongest”, and my game, have no reason to be in the same sentence. The best part of my game is my equipment.\n\nDecember 21, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Huey! Did you ever have a percussionists by the name of Dave Rozelle on one of your tours in the 1980s. He became my drum teacher in 1992 and said he toured with you. Is this true?\n\nNate\n\nAnswer:\n\nHuey: I don’t recall him, but then, nowadays I don’t recall much (!#!#). Bill would know.\n\nBill: We never had a Dave Rozelle play percussion with us but he may have been in a band that opened up for us ? Pete Esovedo is the only percussionist we ever had on tour. Cheers.\n\nDecember 14, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nStarting with the tremendous success of Sports and the next couple releases, did you find that ‘making it’ added pressure to follow up with something just as successful, or did it give you more motivation to explore new creative territory that you might not have previously?\n\nMike Grzybowski – Phoenix, AZ\n\nAnswer:\n\nGreat question, and the answer is; both.\n\nDecember 7, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHuey, I’ve always been a fan of your music in movies. However, one in particular has always stood out to me; that being the part of “Hip to be Square” in American Psycho. I know how you originally did not like the use of it, but as time has gone on, have your thoughts changed at all? Personally for me it’s one of the things that got me listening to you in the first place!\n\nJack Skrump\n\nAnswer:\n\nI had, and have no problem with the use of HTBS in the film. My outrage was a publicity stunt by the movie studio to get the film attention. The publicity department issued a press release on the eve of the release of the film that stated that I had seen the film, judged it too violent and pulled my song from the soundtrack … all made up. So, I boycotted the film and have still not seen it. I saw the musical (American Psycho) on Broadway, and loved it.\n\nNovember 23, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI read that you like to cook. What are your favorite dishes to make ? What’s your signature dish ??\n\nAnswer:\n\nI do a pretty good jambalaya.\n\nNovember 16, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI am a college student with a major in music education. I love classic rock, and your music is very soulful and relaxing for me. My “Ask Huey” question is meant to address the arc of your career: How did the musical style of The News evolve over the years with the changes to rock/pop music? Were you looking to stand out from others?\n\nRyan Lueschen – Lakeville, MN\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, we were looking to stand out from the others, but also making music based on the music we love … more R&B based. If our style has changed it’s because of creative decisions, not commercial ones.\n\nNovember 9, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI remember seeing you play at the Fresno Fair back in the early 90’s, and right in the middle of your set a bunch of pre-planned fireworks went off for about 3 or 4 minutes (ironically right during “Bad is Bad”). This made me wonder what was the most irritating or distracting thing that ever interrupted or happened during one of your concerts?\n\nBret Ellsworth – Saratoga Springs, UT\n\nAnswer:\n\nOutdoor concerts with festival seating in 110 degree weather where I’m singing to the crowd and the medical people are pulling unconscious people over the fence … and, I’m singing a love song like “Do You Believe” … distracting.\n\nNovember 2, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi my name is Jesse and was wondering if you could say something about the song “Free” on the Soulsville album. I really love that song and can’t find the original singer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe original singer is Johnnie Taylor. He might be my favorite soul singer.\n\nOctober 26, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI just finished watching “The Big Interview with Dan Rather.” Very good interview. But it didn’t cover how and/or why you started playing harmonica. Do tell.\n\nClarice\n\nAnswer:\n\nMy mother rented a room to a folksinger named Billy Roberts (who wrote “Hey Joe” by the way), and he gave me a bunch of his old harps. My mother gave me a Bob Dylan record, and when I discovered Paul Butterfield, I was hooked.\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI have always loved the energy at your shows! Thinking back specifically to seeing you live in the eighties and nineties, you jumped off of a lot of tall speakers and high platforms on the stage, and Chris used to run around like the energizer bunny…were there ever any mid-stage collisions or injuries associated with these antics? You guys always made it look seamless and fun, but I still don’t know how you could drop to your knees so quickly without popping a kneecap!\n\nAnne Scheetz\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes there were some accidents. I broke my wrist when I fell off a stage in Northern California, and we used to bang into things (and one another) now and again. We were adhering to the advice of my mentor Phil Lynott concerning stage direction; “Move!”\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy name is Sarah. I am 15 years old, I love your band, and I am probably your youngest fan. I have a few questions for you: Which music video were you in, that was the most fun to film? Did you travel to different places to film the music videos? If so, where are some places you have traveled to?\n\nSarah\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have a 2 1/2 year old granddaughter who is a fan, so maybe you’re my 2nd youngest. My favorite video to film was probably “If This is It” cause we laughed the whole time. We’ve shot videos mostly in the Bay Area, but we did “Stuck with You” in the Bahamas, and a few in New York and LA.\n\nOctober 5, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nDo you ever regret pulling out of Live Aid?\n\nJason – London, England\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo. I still think it was the right thing to do. Very little of the food or money from “We Are the World” got to the starving people and I think it was irresponsible to raise even more money with that as a back drop. Also, I argued with Bob Geldof who insisted that the concert would be “conscience raising”. I made the point that it would only be such if someone on stage kept the focus on the famine, which I think Bob did fairly well in London, but in Philadelphia, it was just a large rock concert.\n\nSeptember 28, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nWith all your musical experience, knowledge and success in the business have you ever run across a musical talent that couldn’t catch a break but impressed you enough to help them get to the next level? If so, who was it?\n\nRob Harvey\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’ve certainly championed many of the under appreciated artists like Bruce Hornsby, Mike Duke, Alex Call, Paul Thorn, and others. Several of them have gone on to big things, but I must honestly say very little of their success was my doing.\n\nSeptember 21, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nDo you know if it’s possible to find the radio-version of “The Heart of Rock and Roll” where you added Minneapolis and Milwaukee (after Detroit)? The old radio station the used to play it, WKTI, isn’t around anymore.\n\nTom from Tucson\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question, but unfortunately I have no idea … if so, it would probably be a cassette.\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nCan you clear up something for me – did you stay at White Horse Inn, Balmedie, Aberdeenshire in late 1970’s, get friendly (i.e. have a pint or two) with the chefs Keith, Larry, Peter – I recall being introduced to ‘Hughie from America’ one evening in the kitchens and remember saying when you first appeared with ‘The News’ on UK TV, that “I know him” – my friends say I’m batty, but . . . . .This has all come back to me again as just stumbled over and listening to Frankie Miller’s ‘Double Take’ album on Spotify!!\n\nSandra\n\nAnswer:\n\nProbably. It was a long time ago, but my group CLOVER performed there so it’s extremely possible.\n\nSeptember 7, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nOne of your answers to another fan question was, “I’ll tell you in my book.” My question is, are you really writing a book or was that a roundabout way to say, “I’ll tell you later?”\n\nCindy McNeal, Denver\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m not writing a book…yet. I’ve thought about it, but it’s a lot of work, and I’m still making and collecting stories I hope.\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nYour music has always been permeated by a great horn section. Therefore I was wondering: Have you been influenced by the music of Chicago (the band, not the city)? And if so, have you met some of the guys from the band and do you have a favorite Chicago song?\n\nNiklas – Augsburg, Bavaria\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot really, although I very much like them and have worked with them. We were more influenced by Tower of Power who were from the Bay Area as we were. Chicago has so many great tunes, it’s hard to pick one, but I’ll say “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is” because when we toured with them they let me sing it every night.\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nWill there be an album release from the musical ‘The Heart of rock n’ Roll’?\n\nI’ve read some great reviews of this theatre show.\n\nJeremy\n\nAnswer:\n\nI hope so, and expect so, but first we have to get it to Broadway which is very challenging amidst this pandemic.\n\nAugust 17, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI wanted to ask if you still had horses and how many you have? And anything else you would like to share about them.\n\nMargaret Lyons – VA\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, I have three. We lost my favorite quarter horse MOX last year (he was very old), and I will probably get another one this summer. I really enjoy them and they are the best way to travel here in Montana.\n\nAugust 10, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs there a song from any album that you wish had been a single or that you were particularly proud of (for whatever reason) that never made it out as a single and/or was overlooked by fans? If so, what’s the song and why is it so special for you?\n\nErnest Sewell – Latham, NY\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot really any that I wish were a single. There are a few that are kind of personal favorites that never got a lot of attention, like WORLD TO ME, WALKING WITH THE KID, and SMALL WORLD part 2.\n\nAugust 3, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nGood to enjoy your new songs again. I just heard your Seville story back in 1968 when you played together with Nuevos Tiempos (which was the origins of an awesome rock musical movement in Spain called “rock andaluz”.). Did you continue your “North African-Spanish connection” after that or you just went back to USA and forget it?\n\nDiez Guerra\n\nAnswer:\n\nI’m embarrassed to admit that I just went back to USA and forgot it. I went to college and joined my first organized band.\n\nJuly 27, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve noticed that you’ve always liked soul music. Your favorites such us Johnnie Taylor, Otis Redding, etc… also sing Gospel music. Are you also a fan of Gospel music?\n\nAaron Armendariz\n\nAnswer:\n\nI am. Have always loved Gospel music, and yes, many of my favorite singers started out singing the gospel.\n\nJuly 20, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nFirst saw you when you were in Clover and playing harmonica with Thin Lizzy at the Hammersmith Odeon. How did that harmonica contribution that ended up on Live and Dangerous come about?\n\nRaymond Hill\n\nAnswer:\n\nPhillip (Lynott) asked me to jam on that tune for that whole tour (Live and Dangerous), and we recorded it at Hammersmith.\n\nJuly 13, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nOne artist dead or alive that you would want to work with on a song or album who would it be and why?\n\nBrian Pirtle – Atlantic Beach, Florida\n\nAnswer:\n\nRay Charles because he was always my favorite singer.\n\nJune 22, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy did the band decide to leave “Your Love Is Killing Me” off of Plan B?\n\nSal Montalbano, Kansas City\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe rewrote it, and have rerecorded it for our new album, Weather.\n\nJune 15, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m a 28 year old female and I’ve been told that I was singing Huey Lewis & The News in my car seat at age 2. What is your most memorable encounter with a young fan?\n\nLindsay Lee\n\nBirmingham, AL\n\nAnswer:\n\nObviously, you were born with excellent musical taste! I can’t think of a particularly memorable encounter with a young fan, but I can remember meeting many.\n\nJune 8, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow did it come about doing a cover of Bruce Hornsby’s Jacob’s Ladder?\n\nRoger Quehl\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhen I produced tracks for Bruce’s first record, I had our version of Jacob’s ladder in mind … Bruce didn’t like the arrangement for his band but suggested we (The News) do it that way.\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nAs a big Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy fan, Phil made his last recordings with you. They are all out there on the internet. Why have they never been properly released? They are great songs .Who holds the rights? I met Phil many times, he was a great guy to talk to. A TRUE Legend!!\n\nPaul Williams\n\nAnswer:\n\nI have no idea why those things are or aren’t released, or on the internet … I only know we hadn’t finished them when Phil passed, unfortunately … and yes, he was a legend.\n\nMay 18, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHave been a fan since age 12 or 13 when I heard Do You Believe In Love on WLS AM in Chicago when I woke up for school one morning back in the 80s. Have been to 12 or 13 of your shows around the Midwest over the years. The new live version of Jacob’s Ladder with the harmonica at the beginning and the long guitar solo is my all-time favorite. I finally heard it live at the Hammond, Ind., show earlier this year. Any chance of a studio or live version of the current Jacob’s Ladder being released in the near future?\n\nMike Miazga\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo plans for a live recording as yet, but you never know.\n\nMay 11, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Huey. I’m probably your biggest fan, at least under 10. My favorite song is “Back In Time” from Back to the Future. Here’s my question: Were you reluctant in agreeing to be the nerdy music teacher in Back to the Future?\n\nDerek Fricke\n\nAnswer:\n\nActually, I enjoyed it. The idea was for me to be almost unrecognizable, and uncredited as a kind of inside joke.\n\nQuestion:\n\nOn the Showtime special for the Sports tour, you are shown warming up backstage. What was the song? Some of the lyrics were, “Ain’t nothing stopping us now. Oh no. Ain’t nothing gonna stop us no how.” Is there a full version of that song available?\n\nP McCormick\n\nAnswer:\n\n“Ain’t Nothing” is a Tower of Power tune, available on one of their albums.\n\nApril 27, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi Huey. I actually met you at SF Giants Game this past season. I work on the Giants TV Crew. Your car was parked next to the TV trucks. Anyway I can’t believe I did not ask you about the Great Phil Lynott. I know you played on one of my favorite albums of all time. Thin Lizzy Live and Dangerous! Your were credited as the bluesy Huey Lewis. What an honor. How was Phil as a person were you friends with him? I remember when Phil passed in 1986. I was deeply saddened.\n\nSteven Benjamin – Walnut Creek, CA\n\nAnswer:\n\nPhilip was a good friend, a mentor, and one of the best performers I’ve ever seen. I learned more from him than anyone else I’ve ever known. He was a great artist with a huge heart. I loved Philip, and still think of him often.\n\nApril 20, 2020\n\nQuestion:\n\nI am so thankful for having grown up on your music, I’m a life long fan! It not only takes me back but it’s just as relevant today with the exception of all you can eat prices for $1.99, lol. You’ve really inspired me to start playing the harmonica, you are an am"
