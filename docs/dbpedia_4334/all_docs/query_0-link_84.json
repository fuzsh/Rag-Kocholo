        "text": "Pet Sematary. Near Dark. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. The Babadook. What do all of these movies have in common? They're scary. What else? They were all directed by women.\n\nFor a lot of movie goers, even horror freaks, it's hard to name a lot more female-directed fear films than these, but there are actually quite a lot, and I'm not just talking about the explosion of them in the past fifteen years. During the early days of film, there were a number of silent films directed by women such as Lois Weber (Suspense) and Louise Kolm-Fleck (Die Ahnfrau). When the Hollywood sound era bullied to the fore in the thirties, women filmmakers were put out of business in America, but they continued to work elsewhere in the world. From the fifties through the eighties, a number of women directed exploitation films, largely because the guys producing such films, such as Roger Corman, figured that they'd just be happy to get the work and not expect the freedom or pay their male counterparts could count on. And as such injustices were finally addressed in more recent years, and digital technology democratized filmmaking in general, the number of horror movies directed by women positively exploded.\n\nI learned a lot of this from I Spit on Your Celluloid: The History of Women Directing Horror Movies. Of course, I'd already seen Pet Sematary, Near Dark, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, and The Babadook and quite a lot of other horror movies directed by women before reading Heidi Honeycutt's sprawling new book, but I knew nothing of Weber or Kolm-Fleck or a welter of the other films she explores.\n\nThis is a truly exhaustive and eye-opening look at films made by humans who constitute half of the human population but haven't had the opportunities the other half has enjoyed. A book like this cannot help but be political, but Honeycutt refuses to turn her book into some sort of tract that would undercut the artistry of the artists she discusses. I Spit on Your Celluloid mostly reads like any study of a particular segment of film history would. She focuses on a period, introducers the filmmakers of that period, and synopsizes (beware of spoilers) and critiques their genre work. The story only takes on a political slant when politics play a specific role in it (as when women filmmakers could no longer get work for purely sexist reasons or were only allowed to make trashy movies for purely sexist reasons) or when the films, themselves, became explicitly political, which really only started happening with great regularity in the 2010s. Honeycutt refuses to suggest that there is some sort of stock shared point of view among women filmmakers or attempt to force apolitical films into a political drawer. By refusing to do so, she does the women filmmakers she discusses the ultimate service by discussing them as filmmakers, period.\n\nWhen Maryland's Velocity Girl came shimmering out of Sub Pop with their debut album in 1993, Bob Weston's wall-of-noise production couldn't hide the gleeful melodism of the singles \"Crazy Town\" and \"Audrey's Eyes\" (and if this song doesn't automatically force you to picture Sherilyn Fenn in saddle shoes, you and I might have trouble relating to each other), the squalling \"Pretty Sister\" (my personal fave), or \"Pop Loser\", which is totally pop despite a lyric mocking those who sing la-la shit. And no group in that lo-fi scene had a singer like the opera-trained Sarah Shannon. Burying her clarion pipes way down in the mix couldn't hide that either.\n\nUpon learning that Sub Pop would be reissuing Copacetic as an expanded and, more alarmingly, remixed double-LP called UltraCopacetic, I feared guitarist/remixer Archie Moore would re-envision his grungy gust of melody and fuzz box hurly-burly with cleaner lines, that Shannon's voice would rise up in the mix, that the album would end up sounding more like the band's squeaky clean second album, Simpatico! This notion gave me pause. The original mix's rough yet gripping alchemy could get polished away. Simpatico! is really good, but Copacetic is its own thing and should remain as such.\n\nI certainly wasn't expecting the remix to sound quite as it does. Instead of the whole thing skewing cleaner and poppier with more pronounced vocals, as I was hoping it wouldn't, each side of its salty-sweetness is just more more. The layers of noise sound nastier. The sheets of shimmering jangle gleam brighter. Shannon's voice is still fairly low in the mix, which is key because a good deal of Copacetic's appeal is its specific atmosphere, the sound of a strong voice shouting to be heard from the center of a swirling tornado of guitars.\n\nMany previously unheard details gust to the fore in this new mix: subtle shades of echo, shivering tremolo effects, the stuttering piano and hollow-cheeked percussion of \"Pop Loser\", the über-deep guitar growl that blows \"Living Well\" apart, as well as other debris. I must admit that as skeptical as I was, and as much as I'm resistant to hearing old friends with new voices, UltraCopacetic sounds better than Copacetic. A really terrific album becomes a great one... a rare development in a remix-crazy age.\n\nI was hoping that more of the material on Velocity Girl's early singles, collected on an essential eponymous CD EP in 1993, might appear on UltraCopacetic's bonus LP, because it doesn't seem likely that any of that stuff will see some sort of vinyl reissue otherwise. But only \"Always\" appears amongst the bonus tracks. The stuff that is included, though, is very good: an excellent track from a split 7\" with Tsunami, wild B-sides from Copacetic's two singles, one outtake, and a clutch of Peel sessions that Moore's new liner notes insist are closer to the sound his band had envisioned than Copacetic's original mix was in his new liner notes. (The fact that his notes also include a passing reference to Twin Peaks makes me wonder if I'd been right about \"Audrey's Eyes\" all along!)\n\nAs for the red-vinyl pressing, it's mostly fine. The LPs are both flat with well-centered spindle holes. LP-1 is largely free of unintended noise and distortion, but there are some fairly long non-fill passages in \"A Chang\" that cause clicks audible through the music, and this issue also arises at the very end of each side. LP-2 begins with some gritty surface noise, although this basically disappears when \"Warm/Crawl\" kicks in. Noise returns between songs throughout Side C, but generally fails to upset the music. Side D suffers from some non-fill and groove distortion, which can get fairly invasive at times. UltraCopacetic is still a superb package and makes me hope that a Simpatico reissue is also in the works.\n\nLove was the greatest American band of the sixties to never score a national hit. Arising from an LA scene that spat out superstars like The Byrds, The Doors, and Buffalo Springfield, Arthur Lee and company were widely regarded as the godfathers of the Sunset Strip. Jimi Hendrix admired Lee; Jim Morrison worshipped him. Even the Stones borrowed liberally from Love (although the reverse is true, too). Love’s first three albums, particularly 1967’s Forever Changes, are regarded as a triptych masterpiece even though each section is completely unlike the others.\n\nYet Love has not endured as their contemporaries have because Lee refused to play the major label game. He hated flying and being jarred out of LA— where he lived in a castle, was regarded as royalty, and the mixed-race nature of his band wasn’t a major issue— so he refused to tour. His controlling, stubborn, angry, paranoid nature alienated many of the people who most wanted him to succeed. Eventually he became a serious coke addict who chastised his bandmates for their drug use.\n\nOf course, Arthur Lee was also a genius by pop standards, and his complications have earned him a cult similar to those that revel in every eccentricity of Brian Wilson, Roky Erickson, Syd Barrett, and Peter Green. Forever Changes has topped many a “greatest album of all time” poll in the UK, where Love enjoyed far greater success than they did in the U.S., and its timeless beauty has inspired a horde of later-generation artists, including Led Zeppelin, The Damned, Robyn Hitchcock, Belle and Sebastian, and The Soundtrack of Our Lives.\n\nJohn Einarson’s 2010 authorized biography Forever Changes: Arthur Lee and the Book of Love captured all sides of the Love polygon, acknowledging Lee’s brilliance without skimming over his belligerence, self-indulgence, and unpredictability. Although Einarson spends ample time poring over Lee’s less desirable qualities, he remains objective by structuring his book as a near-oral-history with the majority of quotes coming from Lee’s unpublished autobiography.\n\nThe rest of the book largely consists of interview excerpts Einarson collected from sixty subjects, including many surviving members of Love’s various line-ups. Johnny Echols— the vastly underrated guitarist who drove the group’s revered early albums with his fierce, stuttering leads— is particularly enlightening, helping to dispel many of the myths surrounding the band. Although Lee is the chief focus of the book, all supporting players are adequately profiled. Bryan MacLean, who composed “Alone Again, Or”, the most well-known track on Forever Changes, is represented in interviews conducted before his death in 1998, as well as conversations with his mother and his sister, Maria McKee (later of Lone Justice). Einarson’s clean, cohesive prose glues it all together seamlessly.\n\nForever Changes becomes a bit of a heavy read halfway through when Lee’s drug-issues really take over and he becomes an increasingly less sympathetic figure— abusing girlfriends, firing bandmates for failing to kiss his ass adequately, etc. — but it’s all part of the Love story. Lee would experience better times after being released from prison following a weapons charge in late 2001 and taking Forever Changes on the road to massive success. The onset of leukemia, which took his life in 2006, brought a sad end to this resurgence.\n\nForever Changes: Arthur Lee and the Book of Love is now returning as a second edition with a slightly different title, Forever Changes: The Authorized Biography of Arthur Lee and Love, and a new foreword by Echols, who writes briefly but lovingly about his old cohort, a slightly revised introduction from the author, and a trippy new cover design. With any title Forever Changes remains the definitive book of Love.\n\n[*This review is an updated version of one I originally published in 2010]\n\nJim Henson was a restlessly creative guy, and like a lot of restlessly creative guys, he kept track of his endless flood of ideas in a notebook. Henson's little red one was filled with brief journal entries and marvelous sketches. It was in this book that he worked out ideas for Rowlf the dog, one of his earliest Muppets; commercial concepts; and other brainwaves.\n\nHenson's fabled little red book was the backbone of Karen Falk's 2012 book Jim Henson's Imagination Illustrated, although her book offered a lot more than those excerpts. That's probably a good thing since the average journal entry tended to be no more involved than \"Oct 29- Tonight Show, Beautiful Day.\" Henson didn't seem to work out his ideas very elaborately in his little book either. So Falk supplemented the excerpts with more extensive biographical details, to put the artist's wispy jottings into context, and a wealth of additional art material. There are cartoons and book covers and storyboards and character sketches. And not all of this is Henson's work. There's a terrific cartoon by Carroll \"Big Bird\" Spinney and a typically fabulous illustration of Henson's creations by the great cartoonist Jack Davis and several gorgeous works by Brian Froud, the fantasy artist who brought The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth to life.\n\nAs a tie-in with Ron Howard's new documentary Jim Henson: Idea Man, Jim Henson's Imagination Illustrated is now being reprinted with a new foreword by Howard. The foreword is too slight to recommend a rebuy, but if you're a Henson fan who doesn't already have Imagination Illustrated in your library, now would be a good time to snatch one up.\n\nAnyone who's fallen under the spell of Robyn Hitchcock's tombstone surrealism should be more than a little intrigued by his foray into the memoir world. The guy can write. Not that you'll necessarily find as much story in 1967 as you will in, say, \"Underwater Moonlight\".\n\nAs the title trumpets, the narrative stays firmly planted in that year of psychedelic whimsy that would so influence Hitchcock's perspective when he began putting out his own songs a decade later. In '67 he was an unripe 14 year old consigned to boarding school, so do not expect 1967 to be the usual rock and roll bacchanal. Even as far as British schoolboy stories go, there isn't much story here. Young Hitch goes to school, where he encounters a few eccentric instructors, as well as his meathead and groover peers, none of whom we readers ever get to know too well. Clearly much more significantly for the lad, he falls in love with the likes of Syd Barrett, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and The Incredible String Band. Then he learns to play the guitar.\n\nEven though not much happens in 1967, there is still a quiet message in this book: Robyn Hitchcock's experiences during that year shaped the man who would go on to lead The Soft Boys before beating his own singular path as a distinctly English solo artist. As mundane as the doings are, Hitchcock still infuses them with his own peculiarly surreal voice, whether imaging himself being hunted by demons in a rat-poison strewn shed or crafting a coffin for his sister's doll. His adeptness as a writer makes the transition from songwriting to prose-writing intact.\n\nI learned nothing from reading 1967 that I hadn't already learned from listening to \"Old Pervert\" or watching The History Boys, but, as an Anglophile and British-psych-o-phile, I still liked reading it. And the whole thing can be read in the time it takes you to enjoy a back-to-back spin of Blonde on Blonde and Underwater Moonlight.\n\nAfter releasing Band on the Run and finally getting a gold star from venomous critics, including the most venomous critic of all (Lennon), Paul McCartney was hot to keep riding that wave of good will. So he rushed into the studio with Wings to follow up with a live-in-the-studio session of covers and songs he'd already recorded and released with his current band, as a solo artist, and with his old band featuring that most venomous critic of all (Lennon).\n\nThe idea was a hasty one, and McCartney thought better of the whole One Hand Clapping project, which was to also involve a documentary about the record's making, and got to work writing some new songs, which would ultimately become Venus and Mars, an album that was not quite as highly regarded as Band on the Run but definitely didn't get undeservedly slammed the way the wonderful RAM did. It was probably the right move, but McCartney's fans were not done with that hasty yet intriguing abandoned project yet. When the bootleggers got their hands on the One Hand Clapping tapes, they had the proverbial field day. The film made its way out there too.\n\nFifty years later, One Hand Clapping, the album, is finally getting an official release as a double LP plus bonus seven inch vinyl set. It feels a bit like a dry-run for the massively successful Wings Over America concerts that would follow a couple of years later and wow audiences with the first selection of Beatles chestnuts Paul performed since the end of The Beatles. He goofed around with some of those songs on One Hand: \"Lady Madonna\", \"Blackbird\", and \"The Long and Winding Road\". The band did \"Go Now\" in deference to Denny Laine's days with The Moody Blues and the guy's wonderful and underused voice.\n\nOne Hand Clapping diverges from that later set with a few songs Wings would cut from their act over the next couple of years (mostly stuff from the little-loved Wild Life), as well as a handful of simple, demo-like piano/voice numbers, such as a version of \"Let's Love\", which he'd written for Peggy Lee; \"All of You\"; and \"I'll Give You a Ring\", which he would not polish and release for eight more years when it crept out on the B-side of \"Take It Away\". There are also a clutch of rock and roll classics from the closets of Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, and Elvis Presley. Despite their age and the fact that most of them are played in simple guitar/voice arrangements, these songs freshen up One Hand Clapping since performances of them are unique in McCartney's catalog.\n\nNot that the other songs don't sound great. Wings was often a critical punching bag, but they were always a great band, even when they were basically McCartney overdubbing himself, as he did on Band on the Run. Plus McCartney always just sounds happy to play. That joy comes through clearly on One Hand Clapping. Is it as essential as RAM, Band on the Run, or Venus and Mars? Nope, but it's definitely deserving of release, even if it took fifty years to happen.\n\nEven though pretty much everyone loved it, Star Wars became an easy go-to villain for every dreary movie critic who'd come to complain that it ruined cinematic art by making special effects and bottom line far more important than story, complex themes, and characterizations. Nevertheless, it took a few years for the influence of George Lucas's film to really ripen. Aside from a few stray extravaganzas like Superman, Alien, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Star Wars influence was mostly manifest in grade-Z schlockers like Star Crash and Battle Beyond the Stars in the years immediately following the summer of '77.\n\nIn his new book The Future Is Now, Chris Nashawaty essentially sets out to prove that that year of ripening was 1982. The spring/summer season of that year saw the release of no less than eight special-effects laden, major-studio genre movies: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Conan the Barbarian, Blade Runner, Tron, Poltergiest, The Road Warrior, The Thing, and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. Not all of these movies were mad successes. Before its recent nostalgia-based revisionism--which is now afforded to every old movie, even if it's as dire as Clue, The Monster Squad or Hocus Pocus--Tron was lumped in among Disney's embarrassing flops of the early eighties. Despite becoming far more deserving of the cult classic status it now enjoys, The Thing performed more poorly at the box office and critics hated its bleakness. The most ostensibly high-brow of the summer's genre pictures, Blade Runner, was too joyless and tedious for most tastes.\n\nNevertheless, all of these movies brought something fairly long-lasting to genre films. Even the stinker Tron (the only one of these movies I could never bring myself to sit through) can probably be blamed for the unapologetically digital effects work that would come to conquer moviemaking. And some, like E.T., Poltergeist, The Thing, and Wrath of Khan, were genuinely terrific movies.\n\nYou could get a juicy book out of any one of these films, so it must have been something of a challenge for Nashawaty to cover eight of them in one fairly slim volume, but the author remains focused enough that you don't feel as though you're ending up with nothing more than a morsel of a potential meal. Nashawaty is mainly concerned with how this particular year ended up being the one in which the genre bubble finally reached full size and its films completed all that which Star Wars began. Yet we not only get a lot of satisfying information about the eight films on which he focuses but also ones that led to their making, such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Dark Star, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien, and, of course, Star Wars. While The Future Is Now could have easily swelled to three times its published length without losing an iota of zing, or even moved a bit beyond July of '82 (Dark Crystal, where art thou?), what's here deserves to become a must-read for genre movie fans as much as The Thing deserved to become the genre classic it ultimately became."
