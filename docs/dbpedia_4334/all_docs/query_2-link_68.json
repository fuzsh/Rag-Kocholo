        "text": "Records are not for sale - For your viewing pleasure only\n\nThe Human Beinz is an American rock and roll/frat rock band from Youngstown, Ohio. Originally known as The Human Beingz. The Beinz started in 1964 as The Premiers, launching their professional career to build a local fan base. In 1966, they changed their name to The Human Beingz because they felt their old name did not fit with the feel of the late 1960s. They recorded covers of songs by Them, The Yardbirds, The Who and Bob Dylan. The group was also the first to record a cover of \"Gloria\" by Them, which became a hit for The Shadows of Knight, and covered \"The Pied Piper\", which later became a hit for Crispian St. Peters. The group signed to Capitol Records in 1967 and at that time Capitol misspelled their name, leaving out the \"g\". The Beingz were told it would be changed on the next release if the debut single did not have any success. In September 1967 \"Nobody but Me\" was released and became their only Billboard Top 40 hit, which meant that Capitol would not correct the spelling. The Beinz' next single, \"Turn On Your Love Light,\" flopped in the United States, but reached #1 in Japan. Despite their Japanese success, The Human Beinz broke up in March 1969, but due to contract obligations, had to undertake a tour there. Their song \"Dance On Through\" was featured in an episode of The Addams Family. In 2004, Quentin Tarantino used \"Nobody But Me\" in his film, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and the song made yet another appearance in Martin Scorsese's 2006 film The Departed. The Human Beinz are touring again with a new line-up still with their original leader Ting Markulin. Markulin is currently living in Florida.\n\nMEMBERS:\n\nJohn \"Dick\" Belley replaced by Gene Szegedi - Guitar and Vocals\n\nJoe \"Ting\" Markulin - Guitar and Vocals\n\nMel Pachuta replaced by Ed McCarthy - Bass and Vocals\n\nGary Coates replaced by Mike Tatman replaced by Rick White and Mike Cerra - Drums\n\nSal Crisafi (present) - Keyboards, Guitar and Vocals"
