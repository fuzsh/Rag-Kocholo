        "text": "Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies (PRO423 - 1970)​\n\n​\n\nWe have arrived at the final Loss Leader of 1970, and what a Loss Leader it is; three albums, 36 tracks, more than two hours of music (all for $3, keeping with the buck-a-disc price established with the first release); this is a remarkable collection. Good listening too. Many perennial names (Arlo Guthrie, Fleetwood Mac, The Kinks, Frank Zappa, Pearls Before Swine, Jimi Hendrix) are back, but there's also a good number of interesting newcomers, most notably Black Sabbath, Little Feat, Ry Cooder, Little Richard, The Youngbloods, and Beaver and Krause. Joni Mitchell and Neil Young (the latter busy with CSNY on Atlantic) sit this one out. There are a couple of utter obscurities, but most names range from recognizable to superstar. The weirdness side returns again. There's a side dedicated to Jesus (indirectly reflecting the surge of Christian themed songs that charted in 1970-1971), a hard rock side, a \"singers/songwriters whose songs do better for other singers\" side, an established rock acts side, and a California post-psychedelic side. Individual titles for each side have returned. The booklet expands to eight pages.\n\nObviously, the cover was a draw; Warner Brothers' parent company had produced and still owned the Looney Tunes cartoon series that brought Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck to the world. Intrepid wabbit hunter Elmer Fudd poses as a cop with a billyclub, perhaps a wink at the revolution in the streets...\n\nHey, if you were sitting around in your room bored in late 1970 and had three bucks burning a hole in your pocket, wouldn't you want one too?\n\nNotes:\n\nArt Direction – Ed Thrasher\n\nDesign [Cover Art] – Dave Willardson\n\nDesign [Organized & Annotated By] – Hal Halverstadt\n\nEngineer – Bobby Hata\n\nLiner Notes [Insert Booklet] – Martin Gottfried, Stereo Review\n\nMastered By – Bobby Hata (tracks: A1 to E6), Joe Sidore (tracks: F1 to F6)\n\n8-page booklet of liner notes\n\nEach side has its own title\n\nThe only triple-disc set in the series\n\nLast Loss Leader of 1970\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide 1: 5.5 Richter and Above\n\nA1–John Gordon , Larry Lipades Radio Spot: It's The Plastic 0:60\n\nA2–The Faces Real Good Time 3:59\n\nA3–Black Sabbath Paranoid 2:50\n\nA4–Little Feat Strawberry Flats 2:21\n\nA5–Hard Meat Smile As You Go Under 3:04\n\nA6–Fleetwood Mac Tell Me All The Things You Do 4:10\n\nA7–Jimi Hendrix Stepping Stone 4:05\n\nSide 2: Resident Writers and Reapers Of Wry Kudos\n\nB1–John Simon The Elves' Song 4:32\n\nB2–Ry Cooder Alimony 2:11\n\nB3–Randy Newman Let's Burn Down The Cornfield 3:03\n\nB4–Gordon Lightfoot Me And Bobbie McGee 3:38\n\nB5–Jimmy Webb P.F.

They even chose Burbank as their headquarters so they could be situated atop the \"largest and richest deposit of pure vinyl\" The insertion of radio ads on this volume may have been a Barry Hansen (Dr. Demento) idea; as he took more creative control of the compiling there would be more.\n\nA2–The Faces Real Good Time 3:59 This is an advance single from the Faces, now belatedly credited in North America under their new name, and hadn't yet been assigned an album (it would turn up on Long Player in 1971). If there was one band that could truly rival the Rolling Stones in 1970-1971, it had to be the Faces. A hard rocker with honky-tonk elements, it boasts a powerful Stewart vocal, which Wood echoes and riffs off of. Pounding piano, spirited drumming, a real 70's rock swagger. Stewart, of course, would eventually become one of Warner Brothers' cash cows. Ronnie Wood would eventually become a Rolling Stone.\n\nA3–Black Sabbath Paranoid 2:50 Black Sabbath turned out to be an unexpected windfall for Warner Brothers. Unknown at the time of The Big Ball, they were fast becoming a powerhouse. Their 1970 debut Black Sabbath had made the top-10 in the U.K., and managed to peak at #23 in the US without a lot of promotion. The liner notes claim that \"Paranoid\" was a number one single in England (actually it was #4), in the US, it would fare no better than #61. However, Paranoid, a #1 UK album, would just miss the top-10 in the US, at #12. It would also go on to become a 4x Platinum album over the years. Ozzy was still \"John Osbourne\" in the liner notes.\n\nA4–Little Feat Strawberry Flats 2:21 Little Feat was formed by Lowell George, who had been in the Mothers of Invention (founding member Roy Estrada had also been a Mother, and Bill Payne had auditioned for the Mothers but never joined). The pre-Little Feat George had penned the GTO's song on Zapped. Sounding very unlike the Mothers, Little Feat's 1970 debut album is a zonked piece of dusty Western folk rock, somewhat anomalous to the direction they would ultimately take. \"Strawberry Flats\" is typical of the album; an inspired rocker with paranoid lyrics partly set in Waco, Texas, with some serious chops on display and a somewhat detached, druggy, loser feel to it. For the second time in the series (the first was Randy Newman's \"Suzanne\" on Schlagers!) partial lyrics are included in the liner notes. The debut album stiffed, but the band's fortunes would improve during the decade until George's death in 1979. Bill Payne revived the band in 1986, and it exists to this day.\n\nA5–Hard Meat Smile As You Go Under 3:04 Hard Meat were a British hard rock trio with progressive inclinations that signed with Warner for two albums before disbanding. Not a whole lot to say about this minor band except that the liner notes proudly tell us a recent promotional campaign for the band went \"Bust your chops on Hard Meat\", which may have contributed to their problems. \"Smile as You Go Under\" sounds like a lot of British hard rock of the time, somewhere between Free and Traffic. It's a good song, acoustic-based with some good lead guitar and a mellow vibe.\n\nA6–Fleetwood Mac Tell Me All The Things You Do 4:10 Fleetwood Mac make their third appearance, the first from Kiln House (1970). Peter Green had just quit the band, and Christine McVie (nee Perfect) had just joined but wasn't contributing much yet. The liner notes for this song are fairly remarkable in how they kinda dis Green. In a lengthy record-company-as-music-critic write up, they express gratitude that the band \"shifted gears and made a quick high speed turn off the cosmic trail Green had left them on\" What we get is an excellent Danny Kirwan song that almost is enough to make us forget Green for a moment. Rocking, propulsive, and with plenty of guitar fireworks, it is one of the best songs on the album. The album suffered a serious fall in sales in the UK (#39 to #6 for Then Play On), but was a significant improvement in sales in the US (#69 to #109 for Then Play On)\n\nA7–Jimi Hendrix Stepping Stone 4:05 Jimi Hendrix makes his third Loss Leaders appearance (fourth, if the 1968 proto-Loss Leader Some of Our Best Friends Are is included) Regrettably, it is also his very first posthumous appearance, as he died just weeks before the album went on sale. Hendrix had been a serious money maker and publicity generator for Warner/Reprise on both sides of the Atlantic, and he was an act close to the heart of Mo Ostin, the president of Reprise who had given him his contract. The liner notes acknowledge his passing. \"Stepping Stone\" (b/w \"Izabella\") was his last single issued before his death and was recorded with the Band of Gypsys, and appears on the 2001 release Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection. The single didn't chart. The song is a wild and wooly bit of blues-rock/funk hysteria bordering on heavy metal.\n\nSide 2: Resident Writers and Reapers Of Wry Kudos\n\nB1–John Simon The Elves' Song 4:32 Simon was both a producer and session musician who had worked with The Band (of whom he was sometimes dubbed \"the sixth member\"), Electric Flag, Simon and Garfunkel, and Janis Joplin. He released two of his own albums on Warners, and \"The Elves' Song\" is from his debut, The John Simon album. This is a pretty weird song, with a twisted 1950's R&B/doo-wop style instrumental backing with bizarre, psychedelic distorted backing vocals that recall some of the Beach Boys' more outre studio experiments. It's a brilliant song, precisely the kind of left-field gem this series was good at unearthing.\n\nB2–Ry Cooder Alimony 2:11 Ry Cooder makes his first Loss Leader appearance here with \"Alimony\", taken from his self-titled 1970 debut album for Reprise. Cooder had already become one of the most sought-after sessionmen in the business, appearing on albums by The Rolling Stones, Taj Mahal, Captain Beefheart, and Randy Newman, among many others. His famous bottleneck guitar is present here, and he gets some help from some familiar Warner names. Van Dyke Parks (who has become quite a mover and shaker at Warner by now) and Lenny Waronker produce. The album wasn't a big seller, but Cooder's career continues to this day. He remained with Warner Brothers through the 1980's.\n\nB3–Randy Newman Let's Burn Down The Cornfield 3:03 Randy Newman makes his fifth appearance, and becomes the first artist to have an album poached four times for Loss Leaders, leaving 8 songs left to go from 12 Songs. He's also had three songs done by other artists included so far. At this stage, there probably is no other artist getting as hard a push. Once again, the liner notes print some of the lyrics to his song. However, at this point the album is more than a year old, and the sales just weren't there. Ry Cooder plays on this one and Jack Nitsche co-produced. This time out, Newman is an arsonist who gets an erotic charge out of it, delivering the vocal in a deliberately shaky, oily voice while Cooder plays a lonesome bottleneck. It's not hard to see why Warners was frustrated; Newman's songs have been consistently provocative, engaging, and atmospheric.\n\nB4–Gordon Lightfoot Me And Bobbie McGee 3:38 At this point Janis Joplin, who was weeks away from her own death, had not yet recorded this Kris Kristofferson song. Lightfoot's single, the first taken from Sit Down Young Stranger (and the third song from that album on a Loss Leader) reached #13 in Canada, and #1 on the Canadian country charts, but failed to reach the charts at all south of the border. Lightfoot's star would begin to soar in the US in a few short months, when he'd score a top-5 single with \"If You Could Read My Mind\", which would eventually push this album to #12 in the US. His reading is straight and direct; his warm voice is well suited for the song.\n\nB5–Jimmy Webb P.F. Sloan 4:00 \"P.F. Sloan\" is a song about the songwriter, whose career shared some characteristics with Webb's. It is a gentle, soft rock song with fairly bittersweet sounding lyrics seemingly about the hardships of being a songwriter. Webb and Sloan must have had a falling out of sorts, because by 1971 Webb was claiming that P.F. Sloan didn't exist and was a name he had made up. In which case, it is a remarkable coincidence. Webb had made his mark as a songwriter, with many compositions for other artists, especially the 5th Dimension. He wrote \"Wichita Lineman\", \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", and \"MacArthur Park\" \"P.F. Sloan\" was taken from his second album, and first for Reprise, Words and Music (1970).\n\nB6–Jack Nitzsche Harry Flowers 4:00 This is a track from the 1970 soundtrack to Performance, best known as one of Mick Jagger's first starring roles in a movie, but also a pretty good, trippy, disturbing movie itself. The soundtrack, which was a Warner product, included some interesting artists, including Randy Newman, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Merry Clayton, and Ry Cooder, and was produced by Jack Nitzsche. \"Harry Flowers\" is a very pretty muzak-style string orchestra recording that eventually grows increasingly more distorted and corroded sounding, and it accompanied a particularly creepy scene in the film. Writer credit is Nitzsche/Newman.\n\nSide 3: Breadwinners and Other Staples\n\nC1–John Gordon, Larry Lipades Radio Spot: Chip Dip 0:60 Another radio ad, ending with the punchline \"Warner Brothers Records-- the shiny black chips you eat with your ears\" You'll have to listen to it to get the set-up.\n\nC2–Little Richard I Saw Her Standing There 2:37 Little Richard had returned to secular music in 1962, but struggled for most of the decade. His records didn't sell, he was reduced to playing dives, and he received little-to-no support from his record labels. However, by 1969 his fortunes were on the upswing as raucous performances at the Atlantic City Pop Festival and the Toronto Pop Festival outshined those by Janis Joplin and John Lennon respectively, and landed him on the talk-show circuit. \"Freedom Blues\", from his first Reprise album, The Rill Thing, even became his first US top-50 single since 1958. \"I Saw Her Standing There\" (the third Beatles song of the series so far) is an unexceptional cover version, but it is pretty funny to hear him mimic Paul's \"woos\" which were inspired by Richard in the first place.\n\nC3–The Grateful Dead Sugar Magnolia 3:15 When we last met the Dead, on The Big Ball from early 1970, they were kinda on the Warners s-list, at least among the producers and execs who had to deal with them. Two well-regarded top-30 albums later, recorded without the studio excesses that had chafed Warners so much, all is forgiven. Even Joe Smith had nice things to say. The Weir-Hunter \"Sugar Magnolia\" should be known to all; it's one of the band's most famous songs and it was a key track on American Beauty, the band's briskest-selling album to date, peaking at #30. It would take decades, but eventually it was certified 2x Platinum. A live version from Europe '72 was released as a single in 1972 (b/w the once-rare \"Mr. Charlie\"), but it did no better than #91. After that, they departed Warner and started their own label.\n\nC4–Van Morrison Call Me Up In Dreamland 3:52 This song is from His Band and the Street Choir, his fourth solo album, from 1970, and also marks Morrison's third Loss Leader appearance. A lively slice of life song about life on the road, it features a Morrison sax solo, and prominent chorus. It has a vaguely gospel feel it it. Released as the third single from the album, it reached #95 in 1971. The album reached a respectable #32. Morrison would remain with Warner Brothers until the early 1980's.\n\nC5–The Kinks Apeman 4:06 After pumping the Kinks (making their fifth appearance here) in the liner notes of previous Loss Leaders incessantly, Warners finally has something to crow about. \"Lola\" had taken off in the US, reaching #9, and Lola Vs. The Powerman and Moneygoround, Part One had made it to #35, the band's best showing on both fronts in the US since 1965. \"Apeman\" would not fare as well as its predecessor, mustering only #45, and once again the Kinks would be unable to even buy a hit until 1978-1979. In fact, they were destined to make the US top-40 only twice after this single. As for the song, it is one of their familiar ones, bemoaning the modern world and longing for a simpler existence, with a Caribbean feel to the instrumentation and vocals.\n\nC6–Arlo Guthrie Valley To Pray 2:47 Arlo Guthrie, also making his fifth appearance, had also been getting a serious push in this series. This song almost could have made the \"Jesus side\" based on its subject matter. It's a peppy, pleasant song with somewhat offbeat instrumentation. Guthrie had reached his zenith in 1969, however, and was already beginning a long, slow descent back to earth. Washington County, the new 1970 album from which this was taken, peaked at an unexceptional #33, and almost every subsequent release would chart lower than the previous one. Warner never abandoned him though, and kept on promoting his work on Loss Leaders until the end of the series. Guthrie would leave Warners in 1981 and form his own label, Rising Son.\n\nC7–The Beach Boys It's About Time 2:56 This is the Beach Boys' second appearance, and second song from Sunflower. An uncharacteristically tough-sounding rocker about the pitfalls of fame, it sounds contemporary and commercial. The liner notes quote from the good reviews the album had received, but saleswise, it was toast, becoming the worst selling album of the band's career up to this point. The band would soon see a reversal of this commercial decline, but for now execs at Reprise must have been worried.\n\nSide 4: California Antacid Rock\n\nD1–The Youngbloods It's A Lovely Day 2:35 With the exception of their fluke hit \"Get Together\", which hit the top-10 two years after it was released, the Youngbloods were not especially big sellers. The Jesse Colin-Young-penned \"It's a Lovely Day\" was the lead-off single from Rock Festival, which would become the band's highest charting album by reaching #80. The album was the first for the band's own label, Raccoon Records, which was distributed by Warners. A hippie celebration of sunshiney days and a lament for a missing lover, it is a pleasant if inconsequential little acoustic ditty.\n\nD2–Jeffrey Cain Hounddog Turkey 2:56 Jeffrey Cain is a Youngbloods discovery, whose For You album was Raccoon Records' second release. Hounddog Turkey is a comedic folk-blues rocker, with Jesse Colin-Young helping out on bass. It's good, but minor in the same ways the Youngbloods are minor; nothing is wrong with it, but there's not a whole lot interesting about it, either. Cain managed to squeeze a second album out of Raccoon, but hasn't been heard from since. Almost nothing exists on the web about him.\n\nD3–Lovecraft Love Has Come To Me 3:11 Lovecraft is a spinoff group from the defunct folk-psych group HP Lovecraft, featuring George Edwards and Michael Tagza from the original band. \"Love Has Come to Me\" is from the first album credited to Lovecraft, Valley of the Moon, a 1970 Reprise release. It opens with a vaguely raga-rock guitar run with jazzy overtones, before unfolding into a gentle dreamscape of a song, with airy harmonies on the chorus and subtle prog touches. It's really a fairly sweet and pretty song, but I doubt it inspired many album sales.\n\nD4–Sweetwater Just For You 9:20 Sweetwater, making their third appearance, tops Fleetwood Mac and Frank Zappa for the longest song on a Loss Leader so far with \"Just for You\", the title track of their 1970 sophomore album. The band was in some serious trouble at this point, as their lead singer, Nansi Nevins, had suffered brain damage and damaged vocal chords in a severe car accident the previous year. This left her unable to participate in future recordings with the band, although she had a stash of unreleased songs recorded already that sustained them for this and one more album in 1971. After that, the band broke up. They did reunite (with Nevins) for Woodstock '94. This song, sung by Nevins, is something of an epic genre-shifting piece, slightly reminiscent of a cross between Fairport Convention, Santana, and It's a Beautiful Day, if you can imagine that. Ambitious, but a little muddled.\n\nSide 5: Avant and National Guard\n\nE1–Captain Beefheart Lick My Decals Off, Baby 2:38 The traditional \"weird side\" leads off with the title track to Lick My Decals Off, Baby, Beefheart's fourth album, released in 1970 on Straight. Don Van Vliet has been quoted saying this album was his favorite, and there are fans who cite this as a better work than his groundbreaking Trout Mask Replica. It is easily as experimental as the former album, if not more so. This track is a brisk-tempo'd, jagged, angular guitar driven number, with a strong Van Vliet vocal. Art Tripp supplies a pastiche of percussion to it. A music video exists for this song, filmed in 1970. This turned out to be the fourth non-charter for Beefheart in the US, but it was his highest charting ever in the UK, peaking at #20.\n\nE2–Mothers Of Invention Directly From My Heart To You 5:17 \"Directly From My Heart To You\" is a Little Richard song, taken from the new Weasels Ripped My Flesh, the second post-breakup release of Mothers material, after Burnt Weenie Sandwich. This album also featured the contributions of Lowell George, who went on to form Little Feat with Roy Estrada. Done as a heavy blues, with Sugarcane Harris providing electric violin in lieu of a guitar solo. Pretty irresistible, and not especially weird.\n\nE3–Alice Cooper Return Of The Spiders 4:25 This is the second dip into Alice Cooper's sophomore album, Easy Action (the first was \"Refrigerator Heaven\", which I had mistakenly identified as on Pretties for You) This starts of with a lot of rolling forward momentum, and ratchets it up from there. The lyrics are paranoid, the vocals are manic. The band is a lot tighter than on the first album; most (not quite all yet) of the psychedelia is gone, and the playing has a metallic feel to it. John Mendelsohn is quoted in the notes, describing the band's insane stage show at the time (and they were just getting started!) This song was also the B-side of the non-charting \"Shoe Salesman\". The album didn't chart either, but the next one would.\n\nE4–Frank Zappa Would You Go All The Way? 2:30 We switch over to solo Frank Zappa here, the first dip into Chunga's Revenge (1970), his third solo album. In some ways, once could call this a concept album about groupies, which make up the theme of about half of the songs (the other half are about sex). This is the first album with Flo & Eddie (formerly of The Turtles) onboard. \"Would You Go All The Way? borrows from 50's greaser rock, and is played for laughs. Good guitar and funny, stuttering vocals, and trombone by George Duke. The album peaked at #119 in the US and #43 in the UK.\n\nE5–Beaver And Krause Spaced 3:51 Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause, two electronic music pioneers specializing in the Moog, teamed up for four albums, the last three on Warners. This one is a spare and sparse electronic noodle; if \"No Time or Space\" (from Electronic Sound) sounds like flying though an asteroid belt, this sounds like the deep space beyond. From In A Wild Sanctuary (1970) Krause had begun his career as a banjo player in the Weavers. He also taught Micky Dolenz how to play the Moog. He currently is retired from music and has focused on recording wild natural landscapes, for which he has become a founding pioneer in the field of soundscape ecology (yes, it is a real thing)\n\nE6–Pearls Before Swine The Jeweler 2:40 The fourth appearance by Pearls Before Swine, this is a cut from their new album, The Use of Ashes. After a transitional album, These Things Too, this one was something of a comeback, with some Tom Rapp fans proclaiming it the best album of all. I haven't heard the album, but this little piece of it is agreeable. Rapp's strange, sometimes morbid fascinations are still present, and the song has an unusually poppy lilt to it.\n\nSide 6: Electric Jesus\n\nF1–Beaver And Krause Sanctuary 1:43 A second track from In a Wild Sanctuary, this sounds like someone playing synthesizer in a monastery. A few years later, and this would be called \"New Age\" Hearing this, I imagine Brian Eno may have been a fan.\n\nF2–James Taylor Lo And Behold 2:34 James Taylor had gone from sleeping on sofas to one of the biggest stars at Warner Brothers in a matter of months. This is his second Loss Leader appearance, and the second song chosen from Sweet Baby James. This is a spare, gospel-inflected number, and one of the more memorable non-singles on the album. The album peaked at #3, and has since gone 3x Platinum.\n\nF3–Harper's Bizarre If We Ever Needed The Lord Before 2:57 This is a Thomas A. Dorsey gospel song by old-time music revivalists Harper's Bizarre. It is a fairly ambitious arrangement, if not especially soulful, with nice harmonies, and piano and organ supplying the most memorable sonic signatures. As an utterly unrelated side note, I'll mention that Harper's Bizarre is the only group I can think of to have been on a hijacked flight (a TWA flight in 1969, no passengers were harmed)\n\nF4–Van Dyke Parks On The Rolling Sea When Jesus Speak To Me 2:25 Van Dyke Parks makes his fourth appearance, with the b-side to the single \"The Eagle and Me\" (1970) This really should have gone on the weirdness side instead. A Gospel song from Mars, this has a gospel chorus and a gallumping, woozy, multi-instrumental production in which trombones play a sizable role.\n\nF5–The Persuasions It's All Right 3:25 Making their first appearance on a Loss Leader are the Persuasions, an a capella doo wop band signed to Straight. The band was known for inspired a capella versions of contemporary songwriters, even offbeat ones like Frank Zappa and the Grateful Dead. \"It's All Right\" is from their debut album, fittingly titled Acapella (1970), and is an original. This is really a spoken word piece, with some funny yet inspirational stories each with the punchline, \"It's all right\", recited to a gentle backing of a cappella close harmony singing. The band was never a commercial force, but they did manage to put out dozens of albums, right up to the 2000's.\n\nF6–Turley Richards I Heard The Voice Of Jesus 7:05 Turley Richards, another Loss Leaders newcomer, is a blind folk singer/guitarist who had been releasing singles since 1959. \"I Heard the Voice of Jesus\" is from his lone album, Turley Richards, released in 1970. While the album didn't chart, remarkably two singles from it would actually slip into the Hot 100; this one made #99, and a Dylan cover (\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\") would reach #84. Richards possesses a very expressive and soulful voice, and this song is a nice bit of embryonic Christian rock, done mostly on acoustic guitar, but with organ and a weeping electric guitar adding color, and epic-sounding strings entering midway.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n​\n\nAdditional Thoughts:\n\nA long and winding listen, but a good one. This has enough star power to keep it interesting, and the obscuro artists are a fairly interesting bunch. The packaging is great, and this is one of the best sets so far. As with all the albums in this series, even the humdrum songs are at least \"interesting\" on some level, and nothing is a complete dog.\n\nThis ends 1970. We've seen Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and James Taylor begin their ascent, and we've seen the Everly Brothers fail to find an audience. The Fifth Avenue Band made a game effort, but came up empty. We've seen some of Frank Zappa's best work, an unrelenting push to get Randy Newman some sales. Jethro Tull evolves, Arlo Guthrie peaks, and upstarts like Black Sabbath appear out of nowhere. An interesting year for the series, which is still just taking off. We still have 28 albums of Loss Leaders to dig through (for a total of 54 discs) So stay tuned.\n\nNext Up: Non-Dairy Creamer, the third of only four single-disc Loss Leaders, and the first Loss Leader of 1971."
