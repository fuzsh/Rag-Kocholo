        "text": "Did They Or Didn't They? Ever since the Pre-Fab Four made their debut on TV, cries were heard \"they aren't even musicians—all fake.\" Well, that was BS. Mike was a guitarist and songwriter—had several singles prior to joining. Peter was a journeyman folkie in NYC. Davy was a stage singer in England. And Mickey could sing and picked up the drums pretty quickly. They all hung out in Laurel Canyon with Stills, Mitchell, and others. It is true that the powers at Colgems wouldn't let them play on the first album. The Boyce & Hart penned songs were performed by The Candy Store Prophets, whilst the others featured studio cats like Burton, Campbell, Taylor, and Blaine. The second album, released without their knowledge, included recordings left over from the debut. Peter did get to play on the album. Don Kirshner, the \"creative genius\" behind the group was fired. By the third album, they were playing their own instruments (with some studio assistance). On the 4th album, they also relied on studio cats to fill out the sound. By the end—with only two Monkees left—they just sang and let studio musicians do the rest. If you want to know exactly who played what on what and where, click the Wiki link at the bottom. The info comes direct from the remastered CDs. Those CDs contain a lot of previously unreleased tracks featuring the guys playin' and singin' for yer enjoyment."
