        "text": "The biggest obstacle to creating a ranked list of every Elton John song ever is Elton John himself.\n\nThe 76-year-old songwriter hasn’t just set a curve for success against which other artists’ best songs can be judged. He’s destroyed the very idea of a curve. Half a century ago, he released a total of seven LPs (including one double album!) in just shy of four years, all co-written with lyricist Bernie Taupin and often composed and recorded in a matter of hours or, at most, days. And they were good. Very good. Elton John is as bold and excellent a first proper debut for a new artist as has maybe ever been released. Honky Château is the album equivalent of the most perfectly paired French red wine and mellow weed; Tumbleweed Connection is solid Americana on par with anything you’d hear from a Yankee in the 20th century. Madman Across the Water levies a scorched-earth rebuke of critics. And Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the mind-melting double-disc epic that could stand in for an encyclopedia entry on “music of the 1970s.” They’re the kind of albums that other artists would eat a feathered boa to pull off once, let alone back to back to back.\n\nJohn’s trajectory from seeming overnight success in 1970 to dangerous near-overexposure happened at a dizzying pace, though he’d put in the work before that; he was classically trained at London’s Royal Academy of Music and played in blues bar bands since he was a teen. The boisterous, flamboyant front man could often be mistaken for the ringleader of a one-man circus. He created offhand feuds almost faster than new hits, alternately pumping up and then trashing his friends and peers (including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, and even Princess Diana), along with more than a few hotel rooms, along the way. Through it all, he waited anxiously for the other shoe to drop. Asked about any new album, he’d predict it to be both the biggest success ever and quite likely to fall right out of the bottom of the charts. “I never feel as if I’ve really arrived,” he complained in 1975. He frequently mused about how he’d handle the inevitable fall from grace, the coming apocalypse when he would be out of favor and fashion — and when his late pivot to disco (and an untimely trial separation from Taupin) finally broke his Midas touch, he spiraled spectacularly for a good stretch of the 1980s and early ’90s.\n\nNot every one of his best songs was a hit, or even a single. John famously argued on several occasions against releasing some of his most enduring tunes, notably “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” to radio. Luckily the good ear and good sense of his label — or more often rogue radio DJs — prevailed, sending unexpected tracks rocketing up charts. But still, his catalogue is so deep that there are several dozen songs where the line between ubiquity and universality has blurred over time. Take for example the way that a song like “Tiny Dancer” could skip across the surface of a lake when it was released in 1971 only to make a true splash because of an emotional needle drop in Almost Famous almost 30 years later. And then 20 years after that, the same “blue jean baby” was capable of inspiring Britney Spears to return to the recording studio in 2022 to team up for “Hold Me Closer.” All it took was a lyrical fragment and a couple emoji on Instagram to immediately spur a fan frenzy.\n\nWhen things are really trucking along, you don’t know where exactly an Elton John song is going to go — sometimes he’ll change course musically two or three times in one tune, as on the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road opener, “Funeral for a Friend,” or when “Madman Across the Water” skates from eerily beautiful harmonics to crashing drums and dissonance. His lifelong mind meld with Taupin yields songs about both nothing identifiable (“Take Me to the Pilot,” which even Taupin admitted was about “fuck-all”) and, as in the alienating big city of “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,” something deeply specific — and also somehow universal. Taken collectively, his now six-decade career as a working musician encompasses an insouciant rebelliousness against being boxed in to any one genre and a cheeky, often annoying tendency to dash off formulaic soundalike songs (“No Shoestrings on Louise” and “Crocodile Rock,” I’m scowling at both of you) as if to prove he could have been in numerous other famous rock bands if only he’d deigned to bother.\n\nSometimes he’s less inspired — or worse, and for so many years, coked out and drunk seemingly beyond mortal comprehension — and it quickly becomes obvious he’s phoning it in. When Taupin’s words veer from the poetic and bizarre back to bitter (as with “Dirty Little Girl”), especially during the 1980s on tracks like “Poor Cow,” the misogyny is glaring and can drag down otherwise serviceable tunes. And while “Border Song” — which became their breakthrough work as struggling songwriters when it was covered by Aretha Franklin — stands the test of time, there are a handful of tracks where these two white guys from England making songs about racial inequality (sometimes, like “Slave,” written in first person) feels absurdly out of touch, if not offensive.\n\nNevertheless, perhaps miraculously, and despite an unprecedented effort to kill himself and his career in myriad ways, John has survived — physically, mentally, financially, creatively. He has a weekly Apple Music radio show on which he enthusiastically supports emerging artists, he without fail digs up archival material to put out for album rereleases and in support of indies on Record Store Day, and he had a No. 1 dance-chart hit in both of the past two years, with Spears and, in 2021, with Dua Lipa. He’s made more than 35 studio albums and has seemed hellbent on extending his retirement tour seemingly forever.\n\nIn order to attempt the basically impossible task of stack ranking nearly 400 Elton John songs, I considered each song holistically, inclusive of the lyrics even though they are almost never written by John himself. He’s unquestionably an album artist, not a singles man, but when separated out from the LP track listing, the best and worst individual efforts became more and more obvious. A bad Elton song, relatively speaking, is forgotten almost before you finish hearing it even if it’s generically competent. A great Elton song transcends time and sometimes literal space to reach through and clench a fist around your lungs, even if it can be harder to explain why than to just sing along at the top of your lungs. The median point (“Candle in the Wind,” by my math) is commercially dominant, patently emotionally manipulative, and yet somehow still heartfelt. And, despite the blitz of greatest hits from the 1970s, when allowed a moment to breathe, almost every new album of the last decade has at least a couple songs that are as finely crafted as, and often more emotionally honest than, those from a half century ago.\n\nWhat’s not in this ranking: B-sides. Often what doesn’t make the cut of an album release is left behind for a reason or because there are many softballs lobbed in the writing-and-demoing process before zeroing in on a banger. In John’s case, he had such a heavy early output that though he and Taupin wrote copiously and quickly, the complete songs usually ended up somewhere. So while there are technically hundreds of B-sides to be found on Spotify or in the indices of older biographies, most of them released only as the LPs enjoyed at least one if not multiple remastering and reissues, I have not included them. Live versions or demos aren’t separate entries (but they do count toward a song’s overall ranking, and John’s Live in Australia album is itself a master work). Most soundtrack efforts — largely instrumental or voiced by others — were not included, unless they were recorded by John and nominated for an Oscar. I also omitted remix and tribute albums made by other artists and smaller features by Elton John on other artists’ albums.\n\nOn sources: A shout-out to EltonJohn.com, which has added at times significant archival material to its own master discography as each album was lovingly re-issued. John’s memoir, Me, is a great read and the rare autobiography in which the author routinely calls his own work out for being shit when it was (and even sometimes when it wasn’t). It was also helpful for tracking at which point the drugs truly overtook the creative process. Also recommended for detail on the 1970s era: Tom Doyle’s Captain Fantastic.\n\nEnough of all that — let’s start at the bitter end.\n\n368–378. Leather Jackets — all of it (1986)\n\nNothing I can write about John’s 1986 album, Leather Jackets, can beat his own excoriating review in his autobiography: “It was about as unmitigated a disaster as anything I’ve ever released … There was no getting around the fact that Leather Jackets had four legs and a tail and barked if a postman came to the door.” (This seems unfair to dogs, honestly.) He added: “[It] wasn’t an album so much as an exercise in trying to make music while taking so much cocaine you’ve essentially rendered yourself clinically insane.”\n\nWhile Elton squarely accepted blame for breaking his long-standing rule about keeping drugs out of the studio, the melodies do nothing to redeem Taupin’s lyrics. This is the rare album of his that has not one redeeming track, so I’m placing these songs in an 11-way tie for last and will simply quote the worst lyric from each in lieu of further description, which they do not merit:\n\n“Leather Jackets”: “Is Memphis for real or just a song?”\n\n“Hoop of Fire”: “Don’t pretend you wouldn’t spend some time in a hoop of fire.”\n\n“Don’t Trust That Woman”: “A woman half crazy, oh then again lazy.” (This one is not Bernie’s fault — it’s a cowrite with Cher and Elton, who hated it so much he resuscitated an old nom de tune, Lady Choc Ice, to take the rest of the blame.)\n\n“Go It Alone”: “The cards that always cheat the hearts / The spades you play just dug my grave.”\n\n“Gypsy Heart”: “You come and go, just like the rain.”\n\n“Slow Rivers” (with Cliff Richard): “Shallow waters never sank so low.”\n\n“Heartache All Over the World”: “Girls, girls, girls, have pity on me.”\n\n“Angeline”: “Bite me, Angeline, let me use you like a sex machine, Angeline.”\n\n“Memory of Love”: “Why conceal you still feel / the need to push and shove me.”\n\n“Paris”: “Art has its price.” (This is maybe, maybe, the least awful.)\n\n“I Fall Apart”: “This fool’s suffered gladly, each and every day.”\n\n367. “Soul Glove,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nThe lyrics are only compelling if you imagine them being spoken aloud by Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho: “Slip into my soul glove / Pull it on, we got a tight fit / Oh never take it off / And baby if the seam’s rough / And honey if the skin’s soft / You and me we go together.”\n\n366. “Shakey Ground” (with Don Henley), Duets (1993)\n\nJust Googled “Elton John duet Shakey Ground why” and there were no results.\n\n365. “Johnny B. Goode,” Victim of Love (1979)\n\nWhy not open Victim of Love, your 13th studio LP — a disco album written and produced by Peter Bellotte for which you helicoptered in to record a few lead vocals in less than a day — with an eight-minute Chuck Berry cover? Why fucking not?!\n\n364. “If You Were Me” (with Chris Rea), Duets (1993)\n\nChris Rea, a British guitarist who has actually sold some 30 million records worldwide despite being all but unknown in the U.S., does nothing here to really introduce himself, and his buddy Elton doesn’t help.\n\n363. “Japanese Hands,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nThe Orientalism here is so strong it’s tough to dig down to whether it’s actually any good as a song. (It’s not.)\n\n362. “Born Bad,” Victim of Love (1979)\n\n“There ain’t no use denying / It was me / Who put you through this misery.” He said it.\n\n361. “Warm Love in a Cold World,” Victim of Love (1979)\n\nElton said he made Victim of Love in part because he was still furious his American label hadn’t released A Single Man’s “Song for Guy” — a lengthy instrumental with only one lyric — to radio and was eager to finish the overall deal. But he also admitted an album made “in bad faith” wasn’t likely to overcome its ill intent, and this is nothing if not a bad-faith song.\n\n360. “Grow Some Funk of Your Own,” Rock of the Westies\n\nThe lyrics on this one are as cringe as the title: “Along came a señorita / She looked so good that I had to meet her.”\n\n359. “Live Like Horses,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nThere’s a reason Bernie Taupin hates The Big Picture with a fiery passion. To his credit, Elton comes closer to belting here in 1997 than he has in a while (not counting The Lion King, I guess), but it doesn’t make the song good. There’s a duet version with Luciano Pavarotti that’s not much better.\n\n358. “Hymn 2000,” Empty Sky (1969)\n\nLiterally no one needed Elton John to try to be another Bob Dylan, and his warbling here (and whistling courtesy of the studio tape operator) makes less sense than the lyrics.\n\n357. “Candy by the Pound,” Ice on Fire\n\nEven this cloyingly sweet song takes a beat to slander an ex-girlfriend who won’t leave him/Bernie alone. Sure.\n\n356. “Take Me Back,” 21 at 33\n\n“Open up your heart, little girl, and take me back.” This is not a credible plea on any level.\n\n355. “January,” The Big Picture\n\n“January is the month that cares.” Self-care, no matter the time of year, means respecting Bernie Taupin’s dislike of The Big Picture.\n\n354. “They Call Her the Cat,” Peachtree Road\n\nThis is certainly no “Honky Cat.”\n\n353. “Slow Down Georgie (She’s Poison),” Breaking Hearts\n\n“The reputation of the woman you’re dating’s ’bout as nasty as the Berlin Wall.” Come on.\n\n352. “Ball and Chain,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nOne of my least favorite John songs simply because it feels so lazily cliché. It’s still catchy, though, and if you listen very closely, there’s some Pete Townshend on acoustic guitar.\n\n351. “The Scaffold,” Empty Sky (1969)\n\nThere’s a very unexpected lively chorus — with harmony — that stands out amid the rest of the early Empty Sky songs, which are almost demos for future work, but it’s not really unexpected in a good way. The lyrics here — “The buckshee hangman swears for open crypts to silence” — presage decades of fans left puzzling through Taupin’s hodgepodge of classical references and utter nonsense.\n\n350. “Dixie Lily,” Caribou (1974)\n\nOne of their least impressive country crooners.\n\n349. “Solar Prestige a Gammon,” Caribou (1974)\n\nAnytime you’re listening to Caribou and muttering “What the fuck is happening,” just remember, as Taupin said of making this album, “There was more snow inside than outside.”\n\n348. “If the River Can Bend,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nVaguely Paul Simon in his Graceland era, but nowhere near that.\n\n347. “I’ve Seen the Saucers,” Caribou (1974)\n\nIt genuinely hurts my heart that after “Take Me to the Pilot” they even bothered making another track about the possibility of meeting aliens. This is so literal it could be a Doctor Who teleplay. And not a good episode, either.\n\n346. “First Episode at Hienton,” Elton John (1970)\n\nIt’s hard not to hear this as a sort of creepy ode to one of Bernie’s many youthful loves — his own early memoir is a recounting of his various jobs on and off the family farm and the series of young women he desperately hoped might sleep with him — and it’s only weirder for the wobbly use of a theremin throughout.\n\n345. “Stinker,” Caribou (1974)\n\nEven with “The Bitch is Back,” John and Taupin knew Caribou was a mess — so much so that they suggested at one point that this song become the album title. “Tell me what your hound dogs think,” goes one solicitous lyric. (What’s baffling is that by the time this album was released, the Elton John train was moving so fast that it still sold outrageously well.)\n\n344. “Li’l ’Frigerator,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\nWould I be so angry at this (undeniably terrible) song if it didn’t land in the emotional aftermath of the great “Breaking Hearts (Ain’t What It Used to Be)”? I don’t know, but it’s awful no matter where it pops up. Actual lyric: “Why, li’l ’frigerator, you’re so cold.”\n\n343. “Pain,” Made in England (1995)\n\nElton really does what he can here vocally, but with a refrain like “You’re all I ever wanted / I’m pain!” there’s not much hope.\n\n340, 341, 342. “Thunder in the Night,” “Spotlight,” and “Street Boogie,” Victim of Love (1979)\n\nA three-way tie. Burying these tracks in the middle of Victim of Love can’t hide the fact that they are all egregiously awful, almost interchangeably so. “Thunder in the Night” is the least convincing attempt by a narrator to care that he’s been left by a woman for many good reasons. From there we roll right into “Spotlight,” a Saturday Night Fever wannabe so tepid I nearly forgot that I do unironically love a disco clap, and then slide into “Street Boogie,” which tries desperately to evoke a cool cat roller skating with a boom box but instead sounds like a Sesame Street reject. Cocaine is, as they say, a helluva drug, and this trio is caked with it.\n\n339. “I’ve Got 2 Wings,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nA classic Bernie Taupin dilemma: Are these lyrics, from 2016’s Wonderful Crazy Night, about some elusive fleeting observation he’s spun into an operatic tale or simply batshit nonsense? T-Bone Burnett and Taupin showed John YouTube footage of the real-life preacher Elder Utah Smith, who in fact did preach with a pair of paper wings on his back — while playing electric guitar. That backstory doesn’t quite make the song gel, but it explains a little.\n\n338. “Princess,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nThis song positions John as a former “prisoner” who is “set free” by love: “You’re one fine lady / You’re my princess.” This is an example of the division of labor between John and Taupin causing more confusion than harmony. It’s not that it’s impossible to imagine John found some kind of love with one (or more!) women at a time when he publicly identified as bisexual; on the other hand, we know from his own many candid recountings since that he … probably wasn’t doing that. So what the hell is this song — or at least Bernie — trying to tell us?\n\n337. “I Am Your Robot,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nThis song sounds like it was programmed by an AI, and approximately 75 percent of the lyrics are literally just the title words with some crunchy synth. This and “Princess” are both very repetitive, so I’d like to assert now that the only way they could possibly be redeemed is if his next pop-reboot megamix made better use of them.\n\n336. “Recover Your Soul,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nThis sounds like a sign to skip ahead to the next song: “Find your feet and your fortune can be told.”\n\n335. “In Neon,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\n“Candle in the Wind” has never been my favorite; this sounds like its half-hearted outtake.\n\n334. “Love’s Got a Lot to Answer For,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\n“I just can’t sleep with this feeling anymore,” it goes, but at an emotional and musical pace so slow I fell asleep.\n\n333. “Never Gonna Fall in Love Again,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nWould’ve made a good Kenny Rogers song. That should be a compliment, but this isn’t a Kenny Rogers song.\n\n330, 331, 332. “Guilty Pleasure,” “Tambourine,” “The Open Chord,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nAnother three-way tie, this time between paint-by-numbers Elton John album closers. I’m sorry. I love this man’s work so much I’m relistening to every song in his catalogue (again! multiple times!), but I have no way to distinguish these tracks from each other. No one will ask you to turn the music off, but nobody will want you to turn it up. For “Tambourine,” see “Guilty Pleasure,” except this one is from a tambourine’s POV. Literally. For “The Open Chord,” also see “Guilty Pleasure,” except this one goes over a rom-com montage about a couple who met in church.\n\n329. “Blue Wonderful,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nOne of those songs that inexplicably has too many syllables in every single line. “It’s very Californian,” John explained (or tried to), “full of electric guitars, very West Coast–y” — but it floats away just as easily on a breeze of forgettable melodies.\n\n328. “A Good Heart,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nThe second single off 2016’s unremarkable Wonderful Crazy Night did help keep John’s streak going on Billboard’s adult contemporary chart. It starts off with some throwback harpsichord but meanders its way through a middling rise-and-fall chorus and key-changing bridge.\n\n327. “Lady What’s Tomorrow,” Empty Sky (1969)\n\nJohn said he and Taupin “hadn’t even bothered to try to sell” this very early effort off 1969’s Empty Sky, heavily influenced by Leonard Cohen, back when they were largely composing songs for other acts. But the studio manager liked it and urged them to try writing more for themselves. It’s not particularly inspiring in retrospect, just more of Bernie’s weird nostalgic songs about young brothers on a farm and not particularly rescued by John’s subtle and inventive organ work underneath.\n\n326. “Sails,” Empty Sky (1969)\n\nThe problem with Empty Sky is that it’s so hard to see the promise buried underneath what, especially in retrospect, sounds like a bit of a soup of other contemporary artists. This could have been a lesser Frampton song, or mid-catalogue Beatles or Stones, but mostly it’s out of sight out of mind.\n\n325. “Old Friend” (with Nik Kershaw), Duets (1993)\n\nThis is no way to treat an actual old friend who was with you in the dark days of “Nikita,” on which Nik Kershaw also appears. If you listen to Elton John’s Apple Music Rocket Hour weekly show, which leans heavily on curating new artists, you know he actually has outstanding taste and a stellar ear for young talent. Even if he was right that Kershaw was gifted, you can’t tell in this duet.\n\n324. “Dear God,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nA musically beautiful ballad that makes almost no sense in the context of Elton John’s life in 1980.\n\n323. “True Love” (with Kiki Dee), Duets (1993)\n\nIt’s an actual goddamned tragedy that Kiki Dee and Elton John didn’t make a full album with each other considering how much time they spent together and how much fun they actually had. Alas, this song is not fun. How do you cover Cole Porter and turn in a less gay and bouncy track than you might have when you were still in the closet 17 years earlier?\n\n322. “Poor Cow,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nAt a certain point, pinning down who is the subject and who is the object of the misogyny in this song becomes dizzying. On the other hand, you could almost make an argument that with a few lyric tweaks this could be Taupin and John cracking down on how Brits talk about Meghan Markle.\n\n321. “Island Girl,” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nI truly don’t know where to start with this song, which is ostensibly about a Jamaican sex worker in New York City (I’m assuming, based on the reference to her six-foot-three height, that she is a trans woman). “Tell me what you wanting with the white man’s world,” John sings in the midst of a patois-laden chorus. (This was a No. 1 song in the U.S.)\n\n320. “Belfast,” Made in England (1995)\n\nProducer Paul Buckmaster, reunited with John on Made in England for the first time since A Single Man, jumps right back into the deep end of the orchestra — and then adds a surprise dancing jig to the end of this otherwise very schlocky tribute to the brave people of Ireland.\n\n319. “Jamaica Jerk-Off,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nBecause the chateau they’d used for two albums running was booked, the band spent a week or two trying to make Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in Kingston, Jamaica, where the Stones had famously recorded. They were plagued by some unfortunate culture clash of island time, missing equipment, a union strike at the adjacent record-printing factory — all yielding perhaps too much time sitting around getting stoned and writing songs, including many of the eventual standouts on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road but also this clunker-slash-revenge diss track. On the upside, when the band finally retreated back to France they had enough songs for a double album — and they brought the weed with them.\n\n318. “When I Think About Love (I Think About You)” (with P.M. Dawn), Duets (1993)\n\nI have more questions than answers about this song off 1993’s Duets. Did P.M. Dawn’s Attrell Cordes write it for a duet with Elton? Did they just dust it off and go in and see how it went? Did anyone bother asking why at all?\n\n317. “Did He Shoot Her?,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\n“Did he shoot that girl that used to be mine?” Bernie. What.\n\n316. “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nDone with gusto, but not done well.\n\n315. “Blessed,” Made in England (1995)\n\nI want to say something cutting here about how this is a kinda-creepy song about an unborn child, but Elton John’s later-in-life joy in being a father is so pure and now that’s what I’m thinking about instead and I can’t be too snarky. (Still, this song isn’t great.)\n\n314. “The Power” (with Little Richard), Duets (1993)\n\nAfter Elvis Presley, Little Richard might be the artist young Elton John most revered: “Elton John was born [the] night” he saw Little Richard live in 1962, he writes in third person in his own memoir. But this watery pop gospel doesn’t begin to do justice to that influence.\n\n313. “Wicked Dreams,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nThe aggressive lyrics all but challenging someone to a nighttime rendezvous don’t match the soft-rock music.\n\n312. “Tell Me What the Papers Say,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nI’m just going to say it: A lot of Ice on Fire is probably Margaret Thatcher’s fault. By then she’d sucked all the fun out of being British.\n\n311. “In the Name of You,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nJohn called this a “Little Feat-ish” throwback, and it does sound pleasingly out of time, like something that should be played over a scene of someone driving through American farm fields — or maybe a missing track from A Star is Born sung by Bradley Cooper.\n\n310. “Cold,” Made in England (1995)\n\nThere are more key changes than a song this forgettable needs.\n\n309. “Answer in the Sky,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nA little on the nose, boys, even though I don’t think it’s meant to actually be a gospel record.\n\n308. “Claw Hammer,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nThere’s a touch of early 1980s Elton here — “my Peter Gabriel moment, probably,” John calls it, “because he used so many different instruments.” But mostly it makes me want to listen to the criminally underrated The Fox again.\n\n307. “Too Young,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\n“You’re too young to love me / And I’m too old for you / At least that’s what they tell us.” Um? (I’d like to think George Michael heard this and thought, Oh, I can do that, and then busted out “Father Figure,” which does this creepy theme better.)\n\n306. “House,” Made in England (1995)\n\nA confusingly childish song, so simple you keep waiting for it to surprise you, but it never does.\n\n305. “I Stop and I Breathe,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nThis mid-’90s feel-good rocker arrived a decade too late.\n\n304. “Looking Up,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\n“It’s the 2016 version of ‘I’m Still Standing,’” John said in a track-by-track companion piece for Tidal. “It’s about my life. It’s a really joyous song about being happy.” The joy comes through, as does a heavy dose of jukebox classic rock. But there’s none of his earlier reference point’s casual cheer, and maybe that makes sense for a man in his 70s. You’d stand and bop along with this band over barbecue at a street festival, but I doubt you’d be shook, rattled, or rolled.\n\n303. “Turn the Lights Out When You Leave,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nThis song, about a defeated man who won’t bother to keep fighting even if she’s still “pretty in that lacy little dress,” is a serviceable country-western sad-sack tune but not a particularly inspired one.\n\n302. “Indian Sunset,” Madman Across the Water (1971)\n\nSome of Taupin’s first-person storytelling reads a lot more cringe today, and this is a prime example. That said, it’s the only song on this list that Eminem sampled for a posthumously released remix of a Tupac song (“Ghetto Gospel”), so make of that what you will.\n\n301. “Since God Invented Girls,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nThis song is too dirty to blame on Brian Wilson.\n\n300. “High Flying Bird,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nSleepy and sweet but ultimately unremarkable.\n\n299. “I Can’t Steer My Heart Clear of You,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nGiven the full operatic treatment of a 1970s Elton album, this might feel very different.\n\n298. “Please,” Made in England (1995)\n\n“Please, please, let me grow old with you” is a surprisingly sweet refrain, but it doesn’t save this song from sounding like it’s one part happy-hour line-dancing lesson, two parts lounge act.\n\n297. “I’m Your Puppet” (with Paul Young), Duets (1993)\n\nThis is not the worst but nowhere near the best on Duets. That’s all I have to say about it.\n\n296. “Latitude,” Made in England (1995)\n\n“It’s just the weather and me,” John sings on this dour, plodding waltz.\n\n295. “Slave,” Honky Château (1972)\n\nWould a song written from the point of view of an enslaved person by two white British guys make it onto an album today? Of course not. Especially not one where the narrator refers to himself and his brothers as “slave.” This is a slow, sweet-sounding country song full of hate for the colonel overseer and the narrator’s dreams of a time when they might burn down the whore house where he spends his days as they work in the fields. But it’s still Elton John singing it. (The “alternate fast version” that accompanies the album in many places on streaming is even more fever-pitched and confusing.)\n\n294. “Little Jeannie,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nOne of many songs from this era that just seem to drag on.\n\n293. “All That I’m Allowed,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nAn unusually trudging cadence, the kind of lyrics that end up sounding like a middle-school poem, and the early-’80s weak R&B vibe (on 2004’s Peachtree Road!) isn’t helping.\n\n292. “Man,” Made in England (1995)\n\nA relative standout on the very middling Made in England, but it’s still weighed down by borderline incoherent lyrics defending … the worthiness of man. Men. #NotAllMen. “Man stumbles on his own belief,” sings John. “Don’t lose hope if you can.”\n\n291. “Teacher I Need You,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nIf you’re looking for an uncomfortably sexy song about a teacher, there’s always George Michael’s “One More Try.” I don’t know that it was in any way inspired by this one, but it’s actually good.\n\n290. “Dirty Little Girl,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nPresumably from some real creep’s POV, this might be the most blatantly misogynistic song in the Taupin-John catalog. It’s hard to rock out to this relentless series of promises to “grab that bitch by the ears / Rub her down, scrub her back.”\n\n289. “White Lady White Powder,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nWhen this was recorded, Taupin was largely off the hard stuff, though his musical partner singing the deadly obvious lyrics was definitely not. “Sometimes the lyrics he gave me felt quite pointed,” John admitted later. “I had the brass balls to sing it as if it was about someone else.”\n\n288. “You’re So Static,” Caribou (1974)\n\nPeak ladies’ man Bernie Taupin lyrics — “Them women, oh they’re gonna slice your pie” — but the best of the melodies here start to sound borrowed from John’s own catalog. And even after repeated listens I can’t decide if “static” is an insult or a compliment.\n\n287. “Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future),” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nTakes a left turn at the intersection of hard drugs and Frampton and never quite comes back.\n\n286. “Hard Luck Story,” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nAn early rare album track not written by Taupin, which in retrospect should have been more of a warning sign.\n\n285. “Feed Me,” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nIt feels like a different kind of ’70s in this jazzy rock song, and not in a good way. The lyrics are demented — “I feel like a carcass, white like a marrow bone” — but the arrangement is insistently groovin’ along.\n\n284. “Restless,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\nA little too Dire Straits for my taste, even though buried down a layer is some biting social commentary: “We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action.”\n\n283. “Georgia,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nThere’s something acutely missing in this weirdly romanticized idea of southern Georgia: Bernie’s obsession with the messy actual history of the American South. This comes off like a forced tourism tune.\n\n282. “Reverie,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nA minute-long instrumental interlude that largely serves as a prelude to the much more affecting “Song for Guy.”\n\n281. “Sartorial Eloquence,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\n“Your lifestyle shows / In the clothes you chose / Sitting pretty in the masquerade.”\n\n280. “Freaks in Love,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nThe wallflowers at gay prom deserve better than this slow-jam arrangement. Imagine if it were an amped-up crazed rocker like “Take Me to the Pilot.”\n\n279. “Grimsby,” Caribou (1974)\n\nBafflingly not commissioned as a tourism-board ode to a small seaside English town, but probably better for everyone that they could just move on from this.\n\n278. “Your Starter for …,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nThis instrumental opener to 1976’s Blue Moves is fine, but it’s no “Funeral for a Friend” and is basically unnecessary given it’s followed by the exceptional “Tonight.” I’ve never been so mad at an intro track just for existing.\n\n277. “Give Me the Love,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nThe hook is serviceable. That’s about it.\n\n276. “All Quiet on the Western Front,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nA book report, more or less, about all the reasons war — in particular the Great one — is hell. This was actually released as a single, though that version did not include the giant church-organ swell.\n\n275. “One More Arrow,” Too Low for Zero (1983)\n\nThe upper end of John’s register here is a real struggle, but the classic Taupin storytelling almost sells it through.\n\n274. “Who Wears These Shoes?,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\n“I feel like an old jukebox / Playing the same song all the time.”\n\n273. “Passengers,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\nThis one is trying to do a lot. It’s inspired by a South African folk song — the most famous singer of which, Phineas Mkhize, is credited here as a co-writer — apparently in some soft protest of apartheid, and yet it also sounds a bit too much like an imitation of generically African accents.\n\n272. “This Town,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nNow we’re stuck in a cheap ’80s comedy. And Sister Sledge is on backing vocals (really).\n\n271. “Ain’t Nothing Like the Real Thing” (with Marcella Detroit), Duets (1993)\n\nThe track first appeared on Detroit’s Jewel and is a more lively pair-up than much of Duets — but it’s a far cry from the Marvin Gaye–Tammi Terrell original.\n\n270. “Cry to Heaven” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nA Very Sad Song About War and the depressingly low expectations of life in a small English town, but set to a driving ’80s raw synth beat — which is exactly as disconcerting as you’d think. “No birthday songs to sing again / Just brick and stones to give them.”\n\n269. “The Camera Never Lies,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nIt’s a relief to hear piano tinkling in the foreground of this mix even if it’s not exactly a standout.\n\n268. “Whitewash County,” The One (1992)\n\nTaupin likes to check in periodically to see if the American South is as corrupt and racist as he remembers, and at this point — yup.\n\n267. “The North,” The One (1992)\n\nFor every Taupin joint about the American South, there’s a song about the North — the English North. It was rough up there for a lad, and he’s not done reminiscing about it.\n\n266. “Pinky,” Caribou (1974)\n\nA drowsy easy listen you forget almost as soon as it’s gone. Chiffon.\n\n265. “No Shoe Strings on Louise,” Elton John (1970)\n\nMy least favorite Elton genre is “wrote a song that could have appeared on another artist’s album just to prove it wasn’t so hard,” and in this case he admits he had the Rolling Stones squarely in his sights. Well done, I guess. It’s as enjoyable as any generic Stones track from this era.\n\n264. “Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes,” Songs From the West Coast (2001)\n\nVery determined to tell an epic story — “Take my red shoes / I can’t wear them anymore” — but it never quite lands. The song is earnest and well intentioned (John has said it was about Ronald Reagan’s inaction during the AIDS epidemic), but it doesn’t live up to its heavy task.\n\n263. “Midnight Creeper,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nLove a light blues rocker about a stalker. What kills me is there are some damned brilliant throwaway lyrics in here, from “Tina Turner gave me the highway blues” to “second cousin to a son of a gun,” but they’re pretty wasted on the actual song.\n\n262. “Born to Lose” (with Leonard Cohen), Duets (1993)\n\nThis Ted Daffan song — most famously sung by Ray Charles — is an odd vehicle for Cohen’s deep growl, especially when John comes in and transforms the track into something better resembling a … Christmas slow dance.\n\n261. “All the Nasties,” Madman Across the Water (1971)\n\nThe arrangement is upbeat, almost a light gospel. As in “Madman,” Elton is speaking directly to the “nasties” — the critics and their questioning, real or perceived, and also probably an imaginary bogeyman keeping a secret locked up tight. It’s (now) a fairly obvious musing on what would happen were he to come out publicly: “If it came to pass that they should ask / What would I tell them?” “Not a single person seemed to notice what I was singing about,” he said later. It’s not a great song, but it’s arguably the gayest of his early tracks and it’s mostly been forgotten. There aren’t any significant covers to note, but if you go listen to the Killers’s “All These Things That I’ve Done,” you can hear how similar those final refrains are.\n\n260. “I Don’t Care,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nElton’s cocktail for A Single Man was a heavy mix of coke, brandy, and weed. This probably makes sense as a bold defiant statement given enough of all three of those.\n\n259. “Understanding Women” The One (1992)\n\nIt was right around this track when Elton’s queerness became more of an accepted backstory instead of a defiant flamboyance — he told Rolling Stone that year he was “comfortably gay” — and his lyrical collaboration with Taupin was similarly a given. But that introduced its own new dissonance. This song isn’t good — the ocean-wave sound effects here are way too Miami Vice, for one — but the tiresome, almost whiny lyrics about how difficult it is to be a straight dude make even less sense than they ever did.\n\n258. “Saint,” Too Low for Zero (1983)\n\nI do really like the vocal climb John does over the course of this even when it’s a bit of a stretch.\n\n257. “Go On and On” (with Gladys Knight), Duets (1993)\n\nStevie Wonder wrote, produced, arranged, played all the instruments, and sang backup on this one with Gladys Knight, which gives it a serious leg up on most of the awful Duets. And yet it’s just not that great, a generic mishmash and certainly not the kind of banger you’d hope these three could belt out together.\n\n256. “Circle of Life,” The Lion King: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1994)\n\nOne of three songs from The Lion King soundtrack nominated for an Oscar, and we have no information about whether it received more or less votes than “Hakuna Matata,” but it wasn’t the winner. Compared to the cast recording, this studio version is … fine. But the original animated sequence of the 1994 film was genuinely jaw-dropping, and in comparison, John’s feels every inch the AC hit and awards bait it became. Musically the melodramatic vibe is a knock-off of “The One,” released two years before, which is far better.\n\n255. “Beauty in the Bones” (with Jimmie Allen), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nThis track is catchy and melodic and poppy but probably a better calling card for Allen than a memorable musical moment for either artist. “I just wanted to learn from him and do things his way to experience something new,” John wrote of their in-studio time together for Duets.\n\n254. “Gulliver/It’s Hay Chewed” (Reprise Version), Empty Sky (1969)\n\nFor all that Empty Sky wanders after the opening title track, it mostly does so succinctly — until it hits this seven-minute rambling ballad. This is the John we’ll hear later on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Sure he can make a big sound and then do something totally different — now it’s a jazz interlude! Now there’s some Chuck Berry–like solo guitar! — and then back into a groovy reprise of … every other track on the album. It’s almost like a badly edited montage of exciting scenes from his future career.\n\n253. “One of Me” (with Lil Nas X), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nIf any young performer is truly an heir to John, it’s Lil Nas X. The joy, the fuckery, the fashion. (“He has balls of steel,” John says.) This remix of Nas’s track only brings John’s contribution forward a tiny bit — it’s forgivable if only because it’s hard to imagine the two won’t continue to get up to no good in the future.\n\n252. “Nothing Else Matters” (with Miley Cyrus, Watt, Yo-Yo Ma, Robert Trujillo, and Chad Smith), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nThe Lockdown Sessions is an album seemingly because eventually John had recorded enough songs during the pandemic to make up an album. And that’s fine! Good for him. He and Taylor Swift, overachievers to the very end. But — and I can’t believe I’m saying this here either — where folklore and evermore were cohesive COVID-era songwriting efforts, Lockdown is a channel-flipping melange best meant for a random Elton John playlist. For example, Miley Cyrus crushes the vocals here, and just for variety there’s also Watt, Yo-Yo Ma, Robert Trujillo, and Chad Smith woven in. But why? This is like an alternate universe where Gal Gadot produced an MTV tribute performance.\n\n251. “The End Will Come,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nThe production isn’t doing this song any favors. The lyrics and melody aren’t actually awful; it’s just a bit hard to tell through all the effects.\n\n250. “The Greatest Discovery,” Elton John (1970)\n\nIt takes far too long to reveal this song is actually about the narrator receiving the great and apparently very impressionable gift of — wait for it — a baby brother. And unlike the spare perfection of “Sixty Years On,” the dramatic arrangement doesn’t seem warranted. Just a bit weird.\n\n249. “Wonderful Crazy Night,” Wonderful Crazy Night (2016)\n\nThe third collaboration with producer T Bone Burnett sounds like it was ordered from Elton John Central Recordings — it’s almost never bad, but it’s rarely all that great. John says that when recording it in 2015 — with his touring band, for the first time in ten years — he wanted something brighter than the world outside. “The news was just relentless misery: I wanted something light and fun, a sense of escape, lots of bright colors and 12-string guitar.” The album that session produced is damnably, solidly upbeat, and the title track is the strongest of the batch. For any other artist it would be pretty good, but for Elton it feels a bit too much like background noise to be exciting.\n\n248. “Love Letters” (with Bonnie Raitt), Duets (1993)\n\nI can think of dozens of songs I would kill to hear these two sing together. This is not one of them.\n\n247. “Victim of Love,” Victim of Love (1979)\n\n“If the title track had come on at Studio 54,” Elton insisted, “I would have danced to it.” It’s the only real sign of life on his otherwise moribund 1979 album, but that’s truly faint praise.\n\n246. “Street Kids,” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nWhat kills me about 1975’s Rock of the Westies is you can almost hear where a song like this should have a clear throughline to, say, “Saturday Night’s All Right (for Fighting)” and instead the second the track ends you’ve forgotten all about it.\n\n245. “Empty Sky,” Empty Sky (1969)\n\nThe title song for John’s first recorded album (it wouldn’t be released in the U.S. until six years later) comes in like a Jefferson Airplane but fails to inspire any real heights for its eight-and-a-half-minute runtime. John and Taupin have said they were aiming for a Rolling Stones–esque dramatic entrance and were deliriously happy with the results. Luckily for John’s “overnight success” narrative, most people never heard this until he’d made much more of a name for himself.\n\n244. “Medley: Yell Help/Wednesday Night/Ugly,” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\n“I wanted to make the band a little more raucous,” said John of this album, which by all accounts was cut after peak (or nadir) cocaine-fueled weeklong rehearsals. The Elton train continued to move so fast at this point that the album itself almost didn’t matter — it premiered at No. 1, his second in a row to do so, an event he celebrated by trying to kill himself (again), a swan dive into his pool dramatized in the film Rocketman.\n\n243. “Duets For One,” Duets (1993)\n\nWhen you apparently need to close out an exceedingly not-great collaborations album with a solo song … (It’s not great, but it’s better than almost all of the other tracks.)\n\n242. “Mansfield,” Songs From the West Coast (2001)\n\nBucking a lifetime of precedent, Taupin and John wrote this album in the same room at the same time, but all that really proves on this song is they should go back to their corners.\n\n241. “After All” (with Charlie Puth), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nNME said this pop ballad could have been on The Lion King soundtrack, and I really can’t top that except to add it could also have been on a Peter Cetera album.\n\n240. “Teardrops” (with k.d. lang), Duets (1993)\n\nIf you don’t remember 1993, it would be hard to explain why a discofied Womack & Womack song should be covered by Elton John and k.d. lang; to be fair, it only made slightly more sense at the time.\n\n239. “Lies,” Made in England (1995)\n\n“The young lie with their guitars / The old lie for a little respect” is a great lyric, but as with much of 1995’s Made in England, the one-word title here tells the truth about the simplicity of the song.\n\n238. “Dark Diamond,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nA decent rocker with Stevie Wonder on harmonica.\n\n237. “Too Many Tears,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nThere’s a sneakily powerful chorus hiding in this song, which is otherwise like a slow-roll version of history in the style of “We Didn’t Start the Fire.”\n\n236. “Elderberry Wine,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nBernie Taupin really loves women, y’all (except during the 1990s when all his lyrics were about hating them). He loves them when he’s got them and after they’ve gone, and this is a solid upbeat rocker for a song that’s really about being left behind. Elton sounds good and sells it well, but then it’s just gone in the wind.\n\n235. “Learn to Fly” (with Surfaces), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nFeel-good light funk. John’s genuine passion for younger acts comes through on his Apple Music radio show, and that includes a broad assortment of British and American pop-rock styles and singers that you might not think in a million years are qualified to share his rarified air — but you aren’t mad when they do.\n\n234. “Love Her Like Me,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nHonestly pretty creepy, but Bernie Taupin’s imagination is detailed as he describes how his fantasy of a woman is more powerful than reality. But, like, in a rockin’ way: “You may have her in the real world but if you could only see / How we rock this room in the twilight zone.”\n\n233. “Orbit” (with SG Lewis), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nS.G. Lewis’s heavy disco grooves are a suitably swoony backdrop for John’s vocals, which are unfortunately a bit muted here — ultimately making the track feel more like some light thumpa-thumpa you’d yell-talk over at a middling gay bar on a Saturday afternoon.\n\n232. “Long Way From Happiness,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nIt’s only fair to note that this is from The Big Picture, Bernie Taupin’s least favorite album they ever made together (yes, he insists it’s even worse than Leather Jackets). I don’t think it’s terrible or nearly that bad, but it’s a bit of an artifact. By 1997, American rock had long moved on from this soft, breathy big-bass vibe.\n\n231. “The Pink Phantom” (Gorillaz featuring Elton John and 6lack), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nMore a feature than a duet, but John’s emphatic vocals here pair well with the Gorillaz pulsating sound. Compared to the other hodgepodge tracks on The Lockdown Sessions it’s probably the coolest, but maybe a bit too cool for school.\n\n230. “The Cage,” Elton John (1970)\n\nA welcome, seemingly straightforward blues rocker that actually makes little sense — “Have you ever lived in a cage / Where you live to be whipped and be tamed” — but doesn’t take anything away from John’s self-titled first real album. There’s an unnecessary electronic instrumental bridge before the horns come smashing back in for a groovy good time, but soon enough you’re back to bopping around.\n\n229. “Son of Your Father,” Tumbleweed Connection (1970)\n\nA little more wah-wah, harmonica, and gospel backing vocals, yet somehow — compared to the stellar tracks on either side of 1970’s Tumbleweed Connection — it comes off feeling like filler. On this album, though, even John and Taupin’s just-okay song has more grit and wail than anything else in sight.\n\n228. “The Big Picture,” The Big Picture (1997)\n\nIf this had more theremin, it could have been on a very early Elton John album without raising an eyebrow. It just feels a little late for 1997.\n\n227. “Holiday Inn,” Madman Across the Water (1971)\n\nWhen you bring your lyricist on tour with you, you get an album with multiple tracks about the road-weary schedule of a rock band crisscrossing America. This is somewhere between “Piano Man” and “On the Road Again” (that would be a great medley, actually). If nothing else, it’s great to see John’s life captured during slightly simpler times.\n\n226. “Made in England,” Made in England (1995)\n\nA bouncy feel-good chorus belies a few sharp elbows from Taupin in the bridge: “You can still say ‘homo’ / And everybody laughs / But the joke’s on you.”\n\n225. “It’s Getting Dark in Here,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nFine, but on the very same album is a very similar song (“Weight of the World”) that is ten times better.\n\n224. “Look Ma, No Hands,” Songs From the West Coast (2001)\n\nThis song wants to be good, and this album was pretty warmly received at its release exactly because of tracks like this. But it’s a touch too clever — “it takes a silver tongue to have the Midas touch” — to read true.\n\n223. “Rotten Peaches,” Madman Across the Water (1971)\n\nTechnically the first of a two-part song story (picked up in “Have Mercy on the Criminal” on Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player), this track probably has the most egregious examples of John’s twangy Americana accent creeping in, but there is a certain determined doom and gloom to the peach metaphor that just works. Also, I am pretty sure this is the first name-check cocaine receives on an Elton record.\n\n222. “Return to Paradise,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nA little cheesy with its slow-dance island vibes, including Ray Cooper on marimba, but beautifully orchestrated.\n\n221. “Monkey Suit” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nThe story behind The Union is nearly as good as the album itself, which is very, very good. Forty years after a young Elton John looked out at the Troubadour audience to see one of his heroes staring back at him, they reunited — helping lift Russell out of a late-life struggle on the edge of poverty — for a dream collaboration fusing the strengths of both powerhouse musicians. The Union is John’s first legitimately great album of the aughts, and while this is the least great song on it — it’s a bit too on the nose and a little Robert Palmer to boot — at least it gets your foot stomping again.\n\n220. “Hearts Have Turned to Stone” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nOne of two solo writing credits for Russell on The Union (the other, “If It Wasn’t For Bad,” scored a Grammy nom), and this is unquestionably his song, though Elton still turns in some honky-tonk piano solos. Russell deserves to take center stage at least once here, but it’s also not quite as satisfying as the true two-handers.\n\n219. “Susie (Dramas),” Honky Château (1972)\n\nA monster of a bass line (courtesy of Dee Murray and John’s left hand) propels this standard-issue funk rocker into a deep-chested mid-album throb.\n\n218. “Blues for Baby and Me,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nSweet-sounding radio rock, almost like a Carpenters song that got lost.\n\n217. “Goodbye,” Madman Across the Water (1971)\n\nA very melancholy sign off for Madman, an otherwise rocking album.\n\n216. “Sweet Painted Lady,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nSpiritually, this sounds like a sequel to “Honky Cat,” another New Orleans–esque story song about a lady of the night.\n\n215. “The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909–34),” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nAnd here’s the dangerous boyfriend to our “Sweet Painted Lady.”\n\n214. “Part-Time Love,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nThe most overtly poppy single off A Single Man. Don’t worry, it still has a disco backbeat and a gospel choir and a guitar solo — the whole kitchen sink.\n\n213. “Tell Me When the Whistle Blows,” Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\n\nWill I ever get out of this small town?, worries the Brown Dirt Cowboy, “a long lost and lonely boy” who’s “just a black sheep going home.”\n\n212. “I Feel Like a Bullet (in the Gun of Robert Ford),” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nMusically this up-tempo narrative about Jesse James (kinda) feels like a leftover from a few albums back, even if it’s not nearly as strong as its ilk on Madman or Caribou. But compared to the other uneven tone of Rock of the Westies, it’s identifiably an Elton John joint.\n\n211. “Just Like Noah’s Ark,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nAfter the slide guitar, at the very end of the track, one of Elton’s dogs barked along in perfect time with the cowbell, and they left it in (along with the laughter of his indulgent human; the easygoing Ryan Adams Heartbreaker-era influence here is strong).\n\n210. “Billy Bones and the White Bird,” Rock of the Westies (1975)\n\nA more Yellow Brick–like arrangement and lyrics — “take the wheel, I hear the timbers creakin’” — but the ship seems to be struggling under its own weight. The weight of cocaine in the captain’s quarters, that is.\n\n209. “One Horse Town,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA disco backbeat and orchestral runs laid under a rocker with a heart like “Rock and Roll Madonna.”\n\n208. “Texan Love Song,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nThis is a charming little ditty about two long-haired freaks who come through small-town Texas; get called fairies, communists, and hippies; and are threatened with being (at best) run out of town. I cannot believe it hasn’t been on the soundtrack of a big gay movie or even a not-gay art movie.\n\n207. “Never Too Old (to Hold Somebody)” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nA bit of a pep talk set to music.\n\n206. “Out of the Blue,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA six-minute interlude on a double album that sounds like an intermission break with the Who. Okay, sure.\n\n205. “Between Seventeen and Twenty,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nThe backstory of the lyrics here is the most Fleetwood Mac drama, with Taupin openly wondering about whether the band’s bass player is sleeping with his wife (spoiler: He is). In a song like this, with Elton voicing such personal dilemmas, the line between the songwriter and the performer blurs even further.\n\n204. “Ego” (1978)\n\nOriginally written with Taupin for Blue Moves but released only as a single between that and Elton’s A Single Man, “Ego” is a melodic but pointed diss track dedicated to “the Jaggers and Bowies of this world — and especially to Mr. McCartney,” Elton later said bitingly. “I’m not in it for the bread / I’m in it for the gravy, honey.” (I know I said I’m not ranking B-sides, but if I were going to include any, it would be the one for “Ego,” a track called “Flintstone Boy” that is a very forward call for tolerance of your local drama queen. “He got trouble / But he ain’t got joy,” Elton sings.)\n\n203. “Chasing the Crown” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nAfter two albums of a trial separation in which the duo both made music with other people but never quite hit the same highs, Bernie’s back, baby, for three songs on 21 at 33. The LP title is a reference to the total number of albums, studio and otherwise, that John had put out by his Jesus birthday. It’s hardly the best work they’d done together, but it’s somehow reassuring to know how easily they could slip back into their own ways.\n\n202. “Voyeur,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nThe most adult-contemporary-leaning track on The Diving Board, this one features the rare appearance of a vocal cut so clean you can hear the hint of John’s lisp in his evasive (but not creepy) meditations on what you might learn anew from looking back over the years at your love. I think. Bernie’s not quite as senseless than he was in his early days, but sometimes it’s less a narrative and more a vibe, you know?\n\n201. “And the House Fell Down,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nA solid driving melody with lyrics that make an appropriate amount of sort of nonsense — “I put the clock in the drawer ‘cause I’ve canceled out the time” — but you quickly find yourself singing along to.\n\n200. “Two Rooms at the End of the World,” 21 at 33 (1980)\n\nWhat sounds a lot like an epic assertion of Bernie and Elton’s lifelong partnership, break be damned. And like the other reunited tracks on 21 at 33, it crackles at a different frequency than John’s other co-writes.\n\n199. “Social Disease,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nWhat would have been a brilliant B-side to “Teenage Idol,” this is a clever ditty about a broke mess of a man who’s having a real good time getting bombed for breakfast, dinner, and tea.\n\n198. “The Best Part of the Day” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nA rare track from The Union that sounds more like a feature for Russell than a duet — and closer to a Bernie-Elton leftover from The Captain & The Kid. There’s a catchy melody, but it doesn’t fit.\n\n197. “Religion,” Too Low for Zero (1983)\n\n“A working girl who loves the Lord” is the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold story filtered through Taupin — you bet your ass they managed to make that rhyme with a line about a “compact Ford.”\n\n196. “Madness,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nSounds like a sinister missing song from The Who’s Tommy, except for whatever evil force it is that “turns good men bad.” Not as good on that theme as “Ticking” from Caribou is.\n\n195. “Kiss the Bride,” Too Low for Zero (1983)\n\nThis album was where Elton met Renata Blauel. When they got impulse-married while making its follow-up, someone played this out the window of the mansion where the paparazzi waited. (It’s a wedding song like how Panic! at the Disco’s “Sins Not Tragedies” is a wedding song — about a man who is not the groom but who still wants to, well, you get the idea.) You may recognize a bit of this from the Dua Lipa duet, too.\n\n194. “Where Have All the Good Times Gone?,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nIt’s almost too on the nose to say a song with this title presaged the hard turn we took from disco hedonism to the AIDS epidemic. This pays homage to the time of the Four Tops, but it would be very Ryan Murphy to play this over a Halston montage.\n\n193. “Crazy Water,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA little heavy handed on the fishing metaphors over a funky disco guitar riff, but a lively one.\n\n192. “On Dark Street,” The One (1992)\n\nWorking couple’s blues with a little bit of a disco backbeat and some wild key changes.\n\n191. “Crocodile Rock,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nConfession: I hate this song, which was Elton’s first No. 1 single in both the U.K. and U.S. I hate it because it’s a joke — and it’s meant to be, an homage-slash-mockery of “all the rock ’n’ roll records of the 1960s.” But to me, instead of a brilliant send-up, it’s too easy, a cheap derivative. It’s evidence of Elton’s genius that he can toss off a song that precisely mimics a decade of musicology, that he can barely seem to care what he’s lispily singing about, and that he can still walk away with a decades-long hit (at the time I wrote this rant it had 225 million streams on Spotify). Still, to his credit and for all of you who love it so much, there were three times I really enjoyed it: when he played it with Dr. Teeth & the Electric Mayhem on The Muppet Show; in Rocketman when it’s used as a stand-in for his first performance at the Troubadour, leading the whole crowd to levitate and sing along; and in the live broadcast of his 1979 Russian concerts, when he transitions into a few lines of “Back in the USSR,” a song he was explicitly told not to cover during his show. If you’re going to write a joke track this well, you should at least end it with an international incident. If you’d rather enjoy that punk spirit, check out “Screw You (Young Man’s Blues),” a bonus cut from the album that is similarly a genre-mash song, but at least it’s rebel rock.\n\n190. “Candle in the Wind,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nThe story of this song has overtaken the tune itself several times over, but to me it will always be the Medium Place, so we’re putting it right smack in the middle, half the songs above and half below. The original was written quickly. John’s diary entry from that day lists his achievements, in staccato, as: “Got up. Tidied house. Watched football on TV. Wrote ‘Candle in the Wind.’ Went to London. Bought Rolls-Royce. Ringo Starr came to dinner.” It wasn’t released to radio in the U.S. yet still forced Taupin to spend years insisting he wasn’t creepily obsessed with Marilyn Monroe. (“It could have been about James Dean,” he swore, though for his 21st birthday Elton had gifted him a Marilyn dress in a glass case; take that, Kim.) A live version from Australia recharted massively in 1986. And then Princess Diana died, not long after she and Elton had patched up their friendship after a bit of a falling out. Richard Branson rang to say people were leaving lyrics from the song in her memorial books and asked Elton to consider a new version to be sung at the memorial service. It had been a shit summer of 1997 for Elton already — the last time he and Diana had seen each other was when they were sitting at their good friend Gianni Versace’s funeral just a month before — but Bernie obliged with less-ribald words and Elton, though stressed, showed up at Westminster Abbey and then went directly into the recording studio to deliver what became essentially the biggest single record of all time (only Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas,” released before pop charts even existed, has a legit claim of beating it). Even though the single was intended to raise money for Diana’s charities, the longer it stayed on the charts, the more uncomfortable Elton became, seeing it weekly on Top of the Pops “as if people were somehow wallowing in her death,” he later wrote. “It seemed unhealthy to me.” Elton has enjoyed three generations of friendship and connection to the Royal Family — the fun ones, starting with Princess Margaret and continuing through to Harry and Meghan — but he’s fully retired the revised version of the song.\n\n189. “Shoulder Holster,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA tight little murder rocker about a woman who avenges her man’s betrayal but perhaps not without regrets, or so the narrator hopes: “Don’t judge a man by his misdemeanor / You may be sorry when his light goes out.” Marred by some bright sax runs, but if you like it when Haim and T-Swift get revenge, there’s a bit of this in that DNA.\n\n188. “Heart in the Right Place,” The Fox (1981)\n\n“The queen of the sly line / I feed on your fame.” This almost sounds like a Dire Straits song, but this time not in a bad way.\n\n187. “Just Like Belgium,” The Fox (1981)\n\nAgain, you can hear the Taupin right off the bat: “The Brussels museum where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers.” A little nostalgia and some specific memories built into a somewhat sensical but always lyrical story, and the title phrase is sticky sweet and quick to earworm..\n\n186. “Emily,” The One (1992)\n\nSuch a gothic song for a ’90s rocker.\n\n185. “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” (with RuPaul), Duets (1993)\n\nUnlike other tracks on Duets, somehow a club remix with RuPaul of the Kiki Dee classic does make sense even if you don’t remember 1993 — maybe because, unlike the other guest stars on this album, Ru only became more famous after this appearance. (Credit where it’s due: Elton’s great mood in this video is probably at least in part because he and his now-husband David Furnish had recently started dating.)\n\n184. “Spiteful Child,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nOne of five Bernie Taupin tracks on Jump Up!, an album Taupin counts among his least favorite, though it’s hardly the worst outing for Elton and a variety of songwriters. I like to imagine this song is about Elton’s longtime manager and first boyfriend, John Reid (“Watching you tear your hair out is gonna be the best part”), though I have absolutely no evidence that it is.\n\n183. “Runaway Train” (with Eric Clapton), The One (1992)\n\nWhat’s a song in the ’90s without Eric Clapton? He even gets to sing. (This is also on the Lethal Weapon 3 soundtrack, which tells you everything else you need to know.)\n\n182. “Big Dipper,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nTwo years after his big Rolling Stone coming out, Elton seems ready to dispense with all but the loosest of metaphors. This Big Easy slow-funk come-on is short on subtlety — “he’s got his own Big Dipper / And won’t be needing yours.” In other great (?) ideas, he also includes the lads from his newest binge-shopping acquisition — an ownership stake in the Watford Football Club — on backup.\n\n181. “Sweat It Out,” The One (1992)\n\nNot the most pointed (or best) song he ever did about Margaret Thatcher (that would be the excellent B-side, “Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher”), but a bit hard to miss the target of ire in this more political track.\n\n180. “Cold As Christmas (In the Middle of the Year),” Too Low for Zero (1983)\n\nThis album, his first in four releases fully co-written with Bernie Taupin again, feels more like Bernie’s divorced-dad blues, but it’s beautifully written and produced: “I call the kids on the telephone and say there’s something wrong out here / It’s July but it’s cold as Christmas in the middle of the year.”\n\n179. “Goodbye Marlon Brando,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\n“Say goodbye to Jackie Collins” is maybe not the cultural indictment I imagine it was meant to be in 1988, but “I need to put some distance between overkill and me” — plus some screaming guitar solos from o.g. Davey Johnstone — makes the point well enough that the times they were a-changin’.\n\n178. “Heavy Traffic,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nThis is a song written by some men (also including Johnstone) who knew exactly how much fun it would be live. It has a little Paul Simon vibe to it, but years ahead.\n\n177. “I Must Have Lost It on the Wind,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nIt’s ironic that Taupin has been writing wistful, nostalgic lyrics since he was barely out of his teens, but they sound appropriately well earned here many decades later.\n\n176. “Whipping Boy,” Too Low for Zero (1983)\n\nA simplistic stand-your-ground quick jive, but there’s something in it where you can hear the young Elton and Bernie trying like hell to make it through their 30s.\n\n175. “Hold Me Closer” (with Britney Spears) (2022)\n\nFirst listen: WTF am I hearing? Twentieth listen: Can’t stop, won’t stop. If anyone were to lure Britney Spears back into a recording studio thousands of miles away to lay down a wildly varied series of standalone lyrics — from “Tiny Dancer,” “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” and “The One” — and her signature kitty-cat vocalizations, it was apparently Elton John. And we should be glad he did, not just because a world without Britney megamixes is a sad version of our universe no one, especially Sir Elton, should have to suffer through. “She’s been away so long,” he told the Guardian. “There’s a lot of fear there because she’s been betrayed so many times.” The song was a No. 1 Billboard Hot Dance hit, inspiring more twirly Instagram videos and a pledge from John to consider making this new style of collab an annual summer treat and giving him a 51-year span of top-ten Billboard hits across his career. But will it hold up if it turns out to be the only return this blue-jean queen makes to music?\n\n174. “I Can’t Keep This from You,” Peachtree Road (2004)\n\nI wish Elton John had recorded this song 30 years earlier. I want to know what he would have sounded like singing it: Bold? Defiant? Shy? Cocky? He’s not even singing about being queer so much as having a long-time pine for someone. But it would have, as they say, hit different then.\n\n173. “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part Two),” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nA literal sequel to a classic, but it’s now a brassy, sassy time in New York, especially compared to their first scary dark days in the big city.\n\n172. “Wrap Her Up,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nThere are two ways to interpret this song. One is as a straight-up shitty, sexist list of interchangeable ladies that Bernie and/or Elton would like to take home and have their way with. The other is as an absolutely unhinged Wham rap camp romp with a bridge as nonsensical as Madonna’s “Vogue” — Nancy Reagan and Linda Lovelace make appearances — except sung along with George Michael. Get all the way to the end and you win a prize: You’re done.\n\n171. “Town of Plenty,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nSome three years and a voice-altering throat surgery later, John came back from the nadir of Leather Jackets with a strong comeback contender, Reg Strikes Back. His buddy Pete Townshend joins him again for this more typically upbeat if not wholly remarkable John rocker — a homage to a town of plenty “with no media.” (The album cover features a pile of hats and clothes collected to auction off at Sotheby’s post-divorce.) There are a lot of old friends from previous bands who join up for this outing, but it’s the addition of three backup singers throughout that deepens the sound the most.\n\n170. “Burning Buildings,” Breaking Hearts (1984)\n\nMore like “Breaking Hearts (Is Hard to Do)” than anything else on the album. This is Elton at his Billy Joel best.\n\n169. “Satellite,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nIt’s Bernie’s space world; we all just drop in and visit occasionally. It’s getting mellow as fuck up on his ship.\n\n168. “Durban Deep,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nIt took another bit to stick, but John was sober — and essentially stranded in the middle of rural Denmark — when he made Sleeping with the Past, and he was still energized from recapturing his groove with Reg Strikes Back. The sound is very much of the late 1980s but meant to evoke favorites from the 1960s; tracks like “Durban Deep” are as much about a mood as anything else.\n\n167. “Healing Hands,” Sleeping With the Past (1989)\n\nThis was the first of three big singles from Sleeping With the Past and helped push the album to be Elton’s biggest U.K. seller up to that point. It’s the beginning of some legitimately feel-good power-rock efforts and does more than hold its own in that genre.\n\n166. “Step into Christmas” (1973)\n\nWithout this one-off I can’t imagine we’d ever have gotten Love, Actually. The song is deliberately compressed to sound like a Phil Spector track, and a video John made for the Gilbert O’Sullivan Show in 1973 features a rare cameo from Bernie mimicking Ray Cooper on bells.\n\n165. “A Word in Spanish,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nBernie playing dumb about how Spanish works shouldn’t be this charming, but somehow Elton pulls it off.\n\n164. “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” (1975)\n\nHalf of a bet between Elton John and John Lennon, this cover was most memorably performed at Madison Square Garden and features Lennon on guitar and backing vocals. The Elton-ification of the Beatles song is solid but not particularly revelatory; it’s jarring to hear him slide back from a country twang to an almost Liverpudlian accent. One of the best anecdotes in John’s memoir is about getting so high with Lennon that they refused to answer the hotel-room door when Andy Warhol showed up, sure he’d have a camera in hand and presumably ruin whatever lost weekend they were determined to have.\n\n163. “Dear John,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nA very spirited opener to Jump Up!, a lively album full of sparkly pop-rock about breakups and Elton’s second LP with Geffen Records. This track is like if Robert Palmer recorded an even peppier version of Paul Simon’s “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.” It’s fucking catchy, though.\n\n162. “Whispers,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nAbout as adult contemporary as Elton gets, but there’s something sincere here that I always loved. Also, you can hear how quickly he’s moved from playing acoustic pianos to the electronic Roland, and it’s not terrible.\n\n161. “The Captain and the Kid,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nFittingly, this is the first album cover on which Taupin also appears — astride a horse, of course. (The son of a farmer, Bernie spent a couple decades, starting in the 1990s, at his Santa Barbara ranch riding in local shows.) This tune closes out their second joint memoir, rather than opening it, but they’ve lived up to their promise: “No lies at all / just one more tale.”\n\n160. “Stones Throw From Hurtin’,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nThe vocals are heavily processed — almost to the point of being unrecognizable — but the bones of this song are good, which is probably why Wynonna Judd’s version is better.\n\n159. “American Triangle,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\n“It’s a cold, cold wind,” John sings on the excellent chorus with Rufus Wainwright on backup vocals. The full track, about the murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming, isn’t as consistently powerful as its refrain, but at its best it’s deeply emotional.\n\n158. “Breaking Down Barriers,” The Fox (1981)\n\nThe Fox was the first album John made for Geffen Records, which promised him complete artistic creative license, and it is a great step forward from his messy, coked-out quasi-disco period. It’s criminally underrated and not much of a commercial success, but the 1980s version of John finally crystallized here. He’s a little more bitter, but he’s also taking himself seriously again.\n\n157. “I Never Knew Her Name,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nThe Taupin-John wedding band is back.\n\n156. “Birds,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nIf only Ryan Adams hadn’t turned out to be such an asshole, it would be easier to revel in the obvious ways he and Elton influenced each other.\n\n155. “When a Woman Doesn’t Want You,” The One 1992)\n\nThis could have really gone either way, especially given some of the other extreme lowlights of their ball-and-chain songs past, but instead this is a real Bonnie Raitt–ish tribute to respecting a woman’s wishes. The irony, I’m assuming, is deliberate: “You gotta play it straight / When a woman doesn’t want you.”\n\n154. “Sleeping with the Past,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nThis song by Taupin could easily be from a woman’s perspective, or maybe it’s Elton finally and more comfortably singing about loving complicated men.\n\n153. “Old ’67,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nTaupin pulls no punches at their by now old old-man routine — like a Tennessee Williams play, they say. “It’s amazing / That we can get together at all / For in between the saddle and the grand piano / We can read the writing on the wall.”\n\n152. “A Woman’s Needs” (with Tammy Wynette), Duets (1993)\n\nIt’s hard not to think that had Elton John been less controversially queer, we would have heard him duet with every powerhouse female vocalist, including country music’s finest. But maybe, as Tina Turner may have reported, he wasn’t as easy a song partner as one might have hoped. This is a solid duet, but the slide guitar is doing a lot of the work.\n\n151. “Val-Hala,” Empty Sky (1970)\n\nA bit of a Nick Drake vibe carries Taupin’s gentle, almost romantic take on Thor. Plus John plays harpsichord. An early hint of brilliance.\n\n150. “E-Ticket” (with Eddie Vedder), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nEddie Vedder’s contribution to this sometimes jarring juxtaposition of collaborations is solidly Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player. John likened this collection to his days in the 1960s as a studio session player, and while this track is nothing like the others, in a streaming-singles world, it’s just two good dudes excited to jam together.\n\n149. “Club at the End of the Street,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nDo I love this song because videos with animated extras — especially singing or dancing cats! — were a formative part of my MTV age or because even as a youngster it seemed quite obviously queer? Maybe it’s just because it has a nice throwback vibe to it (those “Kokomo” backing vocals!).\n\n148. “Lady Samantha” (1969)\n\nThere’s more momentum on this track than in most of the early songs put together — it “felt like a breakthrough,” John once said — and it was a good choice for John’s first live BBC appearance. It was also a top-ten hit in the U.S. when covered by Three Dog Night.\n\n147. “Always Love You” (with Young Thug and Nicki Minaj), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nJohn said a Minaj collab was a “bucket list” goal, and he saves what is probably the best new hook of the entire Lockdown collection for her. What happens from there feels predictable — everyone gets a rap verse and sometimes a secondary hook layered under it — but each time it circles back to “I will always love you / Even if you let me go,” it amps up like a key change.\n\n146. “Western Ford Gateway,” Empty Sky (1970)\n\nA short and sweet country song, it would have fit well on a later LP like Honky Château or Madman Across the Water. The Band was a major influence on John’s early work, and you can hear that here.\n\n145. “Blue Avenue,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nBeautifully layered with just a few new tricks up its sleeve.\n\n144. “Original Sin,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nClever without being cutesy, this tale of love as old as time is one of the best on the album.\n\n143. “Shoot Down the Moon,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nWould you like to have your heart stomped on? Or consider the regret you have for how you’ve treated the ones you love most? Here you go. “We can build a bridge between us / But the empty space remains.” If I had a time machine, I’d take all the ballads from the mid-’80s records and make one long depressing but beautiful album out of them.\n\n142. “Amazes Me,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nIt’s good to hear John get his gospel back here.\n\n141. “Cold Heart (PNAU remix)” (with Dua Lipa), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nThe idea of this — longtime John remixers PNAU tackle not just “Rocket Man” but three less well-known John tracks, as sung by Dua Lipa — was at first a bit of a baffling pivot for John in 2021, but it quickly proved itself to be an earworm-y, chest-thudding return-to-society dance hit.\n\n140. “I Want Love,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nJohn’s refreshingly unsentimental vocal delivery is persuasively performed in the video by Robert Downey Jr. (as directed by 50 Shades of Grey’s Sam Taylor-Johnson), and the song was eventually nominated for a Grammy.\n\n139. “Tower of Babel,” Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\n\n“Jesus don’t save the guys / In the Tower of Babel,” John sings here as he dodges and weaves through the guitar lines of Davey Johnstone.\n\n138. “Legal Boys,” Jump Up! (1982)\n\nThe first co-write for Elton and Tim Rice, later his longtime and much-lauded movie-musical and Broadway partner. Originally drafted as part of the Thom Bell sessions but revived for Jump Up! the next year, where it thematically fits the divorce themes found elsewhere on the album except with far more dash and verve. It’s exactly the right amount of bitter and biting and melodic. “Oh they’ll let us know the cost,” he sings of the only ones in a divorce who come out ahead: the lawyers.\n\n137. “Carla/Etude - Fanfare - Chloe,” The Fox (1981)\n\nA gorgeous and fully orchestrated etude from The Fox that stretches over 11 minutes and into two other movements, the first a synth fanfare and the second a full-throated rocker featuring a series of heartbroken and heartbreaking questions to a desperate lover. Genuinely and weirdly welcome after Elton interpreted artistic freedom as the right to make truly terrible albums, and then beautifully revived for the massive Australian tour of 1986. It’s not included on that release but can be seen (thank God) on YouTube.\n\n136. “Salvation,” Honky Château (1972)\n\n“When we went to record Honky Château we thought ‘Salvation’ would be the single,” John said, and the song fits squarely in their “Burn Down the Mission” and “Border Song” oeuvre, almost possible to play as a triptych. “What we need are willing hands,” John sings. “You must feel the sweat in your eyes.”\n\n135. “I Need You to Turn To,” Elton John (1970)\n\nThe harpsichord-led accompaniment hearkens back to John’s first album, but there’s a clear leap forward here — sonically it’s edited down to essentials versus the earlier kitchen-sink approach. The waltzing troubadour construction hints at “Streets of Laredo,” a John and Taupin fave. “I had barely touched a harpsichord before we hired one for ‘I Need You To Turn To,’” John said. “It was a really hard instrument to play, but I did it.”\n\n134. “Elton’s Song,” The Fox (1981)\n\nWritten with Tom Robinson and only later included on 1981’s The Fox, Elton would call this his “first gay song that I actually recorded as a homosexual song” — that is to say without any coyness or cover from Taupin. The video even reflected the theme — a boy’s crush on an older guy — though Elton doesn’t actually appear himself.\n\n133. “The Wasteland,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nJohn evokes Robert Johnson’s devilish crossroads dilemma here and channels the sound of it, too.\n\n132. “Country Comfort,” Tumbleweed Connection (1970)\n\nExactly as advertised, including sing-along refrains you’ll feel like you have always known even if you’re hearing it for the first time. If this could be slotted into any jukebox still playing “Sweet Home Alabama,” we’d all be better off.\n\n131. “I’m Not Gonna Miss You” (with Glen Campbell), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nAre you going to begrudge John the chance to go back into Abbey Road and lay down some piano and vocals for his favorite sad song by the late Glen Campbell about having Alzheimer’s? Neither am I.\n\n130. “Bitter Fingers,” Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\n\nOne of many songs on Captain Fantastic that’s just about writing songs, and yet sounds like it’s about something far bigger and more important.\n\n129. “A Town Called Jubilee,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nA gospel chorus weighs in for the third cut on The Diving Board, which is really an album that should be listened to straight through for maximum melodic-layering appreciation. Bernie’s back in a dusty western and John’s singing like he’s right there with him, tickling out a piano flourish with a tilt of his hat. The sound and songs here are so consistent and wholly realized it’s almost as if they made a movie without the picture, something like Crazy Heart but gayer. (Thankfully Elton’s ego doesn’t extend to overestimating his onscreen acting ability.)\n\n128. “A Dream Come True” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nRussell’s in the driver’s seat here and sounds like a real comeback king creating the soundtrack to the montage of his triumphant return. “Somehow I know that you’re a dream come true,” he sings like a man 40 years younger; when he says “life is good,” you believe him. Following The Union, which went to No. 2 on the Billboard rock chart and No. 3 on the 200, Russell not only got to tour “places Leon said he’d never seen the inside of in decades” but also got a new record deal, toured on his own, and played right up until his death in 2016. “If you didn’t see him,” John later wrote, “I’m sorry: you missed out.”\n\n127. “This Song Has No Title,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nAmong the best of the too-clever ditties, in this case in clear tribute to the best of the Sgt. Pepper’s–era Beatles. Elton’s piano work here dances by so quickly and smartly it’s easy to miss how brilliant it is.\n\n126. “Oscar Wilde Gets Out,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nThe second track of The Diving Board — John’s second collab with producer T Bone Burnett and the first solo studio album John had made in seven years — kicks it up a small but serious notch by adding in a bass (Raphael Saadiq) and drums. They accompany John and his piano in this Taupin-penned story of a very specific incident in the gay writer’s difficult life: his release from prison after being imprisoned for sodomy. “It has a sadness to it, which, you know, is the story of Oscar Wilde,” John said. Still, the bridge breaks into a livelier if bitter barroom bounce, evoking Wilde’s flashy comebacks.\n\n125. “Your Sister Can’t Twist (But She Can Rock ‘n Roll),” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nIf you’re gonna talk shit about somebody’s sister, do it this well.\n\n124. “Postcards from Richard Nixon,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nFrom the opening notes of The Captain & the Kid, sequel to the dual-autobiographical Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, there’s a reassuring sonic and storytelling familiarity. Bernie and Elton are back with the story of their own partnership, picking up where they left off, relatively speaking — on a “big red bus” doing promo while Richard Nixon’s saying, “I gotta go, but you can stay.”\n\n123. “When Love Is Dying” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nJust a little torch song in the middle of an Americana album. “Nobody told me how to fight a world of hurt / Somebody help me now” is a bruiser coming from Russell’s mouth, but it still begs to be belted out. Somebody cover this gem!\n\n122. “Where to Now St. Peter?,” Tumbleweed Connection (1970)\n\nIf this song appeared on a Mumford & Sons album today, it wouldn’t sound out of place. You can almost feel John not being able to keep himself from writing a perfect pop hook and then burying it in a concept album about the American West.\n\n121. “Better Off Dead,” Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\n\nA whimsical roundabout melody circling the darkest of themes (again): “You’re better off dead / If you haven’t yet died.”\n\n120. “Gone to Shiloh” (with Leon Russell, featuring Neil Young), The Union (2010)\n\nA dirge-y heartbreaker with guest star Neil Young that reimagines the Civil War through the eyes of a young man off to fight for the titular Union.\n\n119. “Merry Christmas” (with Ed Sheeran), The Lockdown Sessions (2021)\n\nUnexpectedly sincere and sweet. Of all The Lockdown cuts, it’s the most deliberately commercial, designed specifically for the U.K. singles chart (where it of course entered at No. 1). It’s a short, jolly, upbeat, and slightly wistful holiday tune — with a tiny COVID twist of the knife suspended amid snowflakes and jingle bells: “Know there’s been pain this year, but it’s time to let it go,” Sheeran sings, just before John belts back, “My God, you look beautiful.”\n\n118. “Shine on Through,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nThe first track from the pointedly named A Single Man — written not by himself but, for the first time, without Bernie — was actually produced as part of Elton’s shelved sessions with classic Philadelphia soul producer Thom Bell the year before and co-written by Gary Osborne. We can thank Bell for finally saying to Elton’s face what was becoming clear on earlier albums: His falsetto needed work, or at least less time in the foreground; the strength of the ballads this time around, mostly in a lower register, seem to reflect that advice. Unlike with Bernie, Elton and Gary tended to write music and lyrics in the same room at the same time, and the overall result yielded more personal, if less magical, songs. The cover art — Elton in a funereal formal suit, posed on the Long Walk leading to Windsor Castle — was a not particularly subtle sign that unlike in the manic decade before, Elton was now making more of his own choices.\n\n117. “Sacrifice,” Sleeping with the Past (1989)\n\nThis track is a bridge to the 1990s Elton John “Circle of Life” tracks — just a solid and sincere rock ballad. (You may recognize it from Sinead O’Connor’s excellent cover or that hook from the Dua Lipa megamix.)\n\n116. “This Train Don’t Stop There Anymore,” Songs from the West Coast (2001)\n\nThe video for this standout track (starring Justin Timberlake as Elton, basically) kickstarted John’s collaboration with David LaChapelle, whom he also hired to design his Las Vegas show, the Red Piano, and it could have led to Timberlake being cast in Rocketman had it not taken so long to actually get made. It takes the whole album to get Taupin and John sounding like they are completely on the same page, but when they finally hit their stride, it’s as good as ever. “It ended up being a very Californian-sounding record,” John said, “as if the warmth gets into your bones and relaxes you, and the sunlight somehow glows in the music you make.”\n\n115. “Nikita,” Ice on Fire (1985)\n\nJohn later talked about how this song was inspired in part by the KGB agent assigned to him during his 1979 trip to the USSR — with whom he slept with during their long train travel between cities (because why not?!). Nikita is clearly a Russian man’s name, even though the music video treatment allowed a cool blonde woman to stand in as the object of his affection, a border guard on the cold side of the Cold War. (Listen closely and you can hear George Michael, still in his Wham days, singing backup.)\n\n114. “Simple Life,” The One (1992)\n\nFinally totally sober — post-rehab for alcohol, drugs, bulimia, and other addictions, like fame — Elton John came out with this song from The One, which I’d count as the true comeback moment of his career. The big ’90s sound is solid and grounded, and the flourishes seem intentional rather than like a fancy distraction.\n\n113. “Eight Hundred Dollar Shoes” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\n“You came to town in headlines and $800 shoes” is the perfect self-recrimination.\n\n112. “Cage the Songbird,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA beautiful, early Buckingham-Nicks sound that is supposedly about the end of Edith Piaf’s life and the slow twilight of fame. Blue Moves itself is a bit of a lost album, having seemingly suffered from Elton’s big Rolling Stone coming-out moment and the backlash that followed. But it’s musically and lyrically stronger than its predecessor, Rock of the Westies, and was the last true Taupin-John collaboration for many years.\n\n111. “Stolen Car” (with Stevie Nicks), Duets (1993)\n\nIn the liner notes to the Duets album, John writes, “Stevie and I sound like an old married couple having an argument,” and he means it as the compliment it should be. This would have fit in well on any of the sans-Bernie 1980s albums — the lyrics aren’t exactly poetic, but the delivery of both parts is a good old-fashioned barn fire.\n\n110. “Fascist Faces,” The Fox (1981)\n\nA scathing indictment of casual indifference to politics (I think?) from Taupin with a driving rock beat and a properly used gospel choir on the chorus, welcome after the de rigeur application during the disco days.\n\n109. “Talking Old Soldiers,” Tumbleweed Connection (1970)\n\nThe spare piano accompaniment showcases John’s soulful delivery and Taupin’s succinct storytelling, a crisp monologue from the point of view of (what else?) an old soldier sitting at a bar, sorting through his memories of friends and days gone by. It’s timeless — could be any fighter from any war in any country left to his own long survival.\n\n108. “The Ballad of Blind Tom,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nBack in Bernie’s history books — this one’s about Thomas Wiggins, a composer and performer born a slave in the 19th century — but unlike some other efforts in a similar lane, the lyrics and melody rumble through a tight four-minute story that makes you want to learn more. (Start here.)\n\n107. “Roy Rogers,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nA catchy and unexpectedly effective homage to TV westerns, also well covered by Kacey Musgraves on the 2018 Restorations collection.\n\n106. “It Ain’t Gonna Be Easy,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nIt almost sounds five years early, better suited to American rock ballads in the 1980s, with a lonely sharp guitar solo befitting a Hollywood drama (think: Tina Turner’s “Private Dancer”). The lyrics aren’t groundbreaking, but they showcase a more involved-sounding Elton on vocals.\n\n105. “Finish Line” (with Stevie Wonder), Duets (1993)\n\nDespite nearly a half-century of friendship, Wonder and John had never done a proper duet together. “Stevie sounds like he’s 19 again,” John wrote in the liner notes. (If you haven’t read John’s stellar memoir, Me, it might be worth it just for the story he tells about Stevie Wonder … snowmobiling.) Between the two men, they’ve eked out more than a dozen cat’s lives, and earned every second of the soulful heights this song hits.\n\n104. “Chameleon,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nBoth Bernie and Elton were in a breakup-song kind of mood on Blue Moves, with their longest relationships cracked up in the wake of Westies. This smooth rocker has a soft, wounded underbelly, full of confusion over love that’s clearly gone off track.\n\n103. “Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight),” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nTaupin, who was 62 when The Diving Board was released, seems to have been enjoying a certain later-in-life domestic bliss as surely as John was. There’s a foot-stomping grin of a heartbeat to John’s piano riffs, too, content but happy.\n\n102. “I’m Gonna Be a Teenage Idol,” Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player (1973)\n\nA cheeky tribute to his friend Marc Bolan — who John later called “the perfect pop star” and a “great role model” — “Idol” is a self-aware but more serious first-person song seemingly directed at critics than “Going to Kill Myself” (though it would have made a great A-side to it).\n\n101. “In the Hands of Angels” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nThe Union closes with a thank you from Russell to John in the form of this song, because as he told Rolling Stone: “I wanted to give him something for doing this for me: ‘What can I give this guy? He has ten of everything.’ I went in and sang it, two keys too high. Then I did it again, lower. That’s the take on the album.” Cameron Crowe filmed the recording session, because of course he did. It’s hard but not impossible to find the doc online — and worth it.\n\n100. “Take This Dirty Water,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nThis is what it sounds like when absurd natural talent and decades of experience yield a track that seems to be almost effortlessly well executed. It’s not the best or most famous song he’ll ever make, but it’s still better than almost anything else that’s been recorded.\n\n99. “Harmony,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nThis Beatles-esque good-bye to a long double album, also released as the B-side to “Bennie and the Jets,” was never officially a single but did get a lot of play at radio stations, especially those that counted fan requests in their own chart numbers. A briefly available video assembled for the song’s 40th anniversary includes rare Super 8 footage shot on Elton’s mile-high party plane, including Stevie Wonder and many others.\n\n98. “I Should Have Sent Roses” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\n“I didn’t know how to love you, though I loved you so much.” A pretty perfect slice of acute lovelorn regret.\n\n97. “I’ve Seen That Movie Too,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nBegging for a smoke-filled cabaret version or cover, maybe by Sam Smith. At its core, though, it’s a perfect example of the often-forgotten mid-album track — heads above almost anything else out there, emotional and cinematic and crisply orchestrated.\n\n96. “The Fox,” The Fox (1981)\n\nThis title track closes out the album with exactly the right amount of harmonica, of backing vocals, of carefully composed couplets: “It’s an evergreen affair, as tradition taunts the fox / Into the hunter’s waiting lair.”\n\n93, 94, 95. “Dream #1, #2, and #3,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nThe three “Dream” interludes on The Diving Board — all improvised piano-only passages — serve as perfect nocturnal bridges carrying us through this underrated album.\n\n92. “Can’t Stay Alone Tonight,” The Diving Board (2013)\n\nA classic country-western spin around the sawdust-strewn dance floor: “Things have to change / And they might.” There’s a pleasant simplicity here that calls back to “I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues,” but John’s general happiness shines through even the wistful lyrics.\n\n91. “Heels of the Wind,” The Fox (1981)\n\n“How come it gets so disturbing / When two ships pass in the storm?” Maybe because when they finally collide again you get a song like this, one of four from Taupin on this open marriage of an album.\n\n90. “I Don’t Wanna Go on with You Like That,” Reg Strikes Back (1988)\n\nMore than any other track off the struggling Reg Strikes Back, this song feels like he’s remembered how to do it and make it look easy — a bittersweet but not totally twisted breakup tune, maybe best known for its whoa-ohs.\n\n89. “Shooting Star,” A Single Man (1978)\n\nSomehow this sounds both like the Carpenters and a Donna Summer “On the Radio” rip. But it’s a great tragic little song about being in love with someone whose fame takes them away from you.\n\n88. “Idol,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nCould have been the B-side to George Michael’s “Kissing a Fool,” or maybe Michael borrowed more from Elton than even he admitted. Based on Elton’s own recounting of his sad later-career encounter with Elvis, this is almost certainly his love letter to the King That Was. After a brutal critique of his fading looks, the song ends with the ultimate knife-twist: “I have to say, I like the way his music sounded before.”\n\n87. “Crystal,” Too Low For Zero (1983)\n\nI’m not totally sure this song is about coke, but with a title like that why wouldn’t it be? It’s also catchy as hell.\n\n86. “Boogie Pilgrim,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA bluesy state-of-the-times lament, with an organ, deep horn line, and falsetto chorus filled in by a Baptist choir.\n\n85. “Tinderbox,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\n“Lately we’ve been getting more roll than rock,” The Captain & the Kid warn in this pointed couples-therapy self-assessment, presumably of Elton and Bernie’s relationship, though it gets a bit heated at points. “We’ve gotta climb out of the other one’s pocket / Or we’re gonna burn out on this beautiful rocket.”\n\n84. “Where’s the Shoorah?,” Blue Moves (1976)\n\n“Amoreena” all grown up, including a gospel chorus. Evocative, emotional, quietly wrenching\n\n83. “There’s No Tomorrow” (with Leon Russell), The Union (2010)\n\nThe most gospel track of the album also features one of its few pure electric-guitar solos. But it feels a bit repetitive.\n\n82. “The Bridge,” The Captain & the Kid (2006)\n\nAn almost but not quite maudlin contemplation of the inevitability of death. Unlike the jokey dark humor of their youth, this one’s deeply serious: “On a distant beach your song can die / On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide.” John’s voice here sounds raw, almost his age, a vivid plea to be heard or hear himself.\n\n81. “If There’s a God in Heaven (What’s He Waiting For?),” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nThis harks back to earlier, Honky Château–era John rockers, organ, and deep thoughts.\n\n80. “Bite Your Lip (Get Up and Dance!),” Blue Moves (1976)\n\nA real “you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here” end to Blue Moves, which is at heart a moody double album. Back to the blues-rock bars we go with a little disco beat thrown in, but it’s still Saturday night here in this club.\n\n79. “Curtains,” Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\n\nFolksy and simple, almost like a yearning Nick Drake song that returns the young protagonists of Captai"
