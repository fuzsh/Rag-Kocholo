He was called to the Irish bar in 1881, became a King's Counsel in 1899 and was appointed the Regius Professor of Laws in TCD in 1934.

Tipperary, Burgess's Protestant parents farmed in an area so troubled by sectarianism and faction fighting that they preserved strict neutrality for the family by rendering first aid to all the combatants irrespective of their religious beliefs. It was an attitude that characterised much of his own dealings with his fellow countrymen. Leaving school at 14, Burgess worked administratively on the Irish and the UK railways. Commuting regularly between London and Dún Laoghaire, Burgess facilitated contact between the Irish labour leaders and the home secretary to negotiate a peace settlement in 1921 and made his home in Dún Laoghaire available for the meetings.

It was believed by his descendants that his paternal grandfather had been a police constable in Glenavy, Co. Antrim and his humble origins, though seen as socially embarrassing, inspired his later choice of title. Campbell studied at Trinity College Dublin and the King's Inns, qualifying for the bar in 1878. A talented and ambitious advocate, Campbell threw himself into the service of the Unionist Party, campaigning in England and Ireland against home rule. In 1898 he was elected MP for the St Stephen's Green division of Dublin. From 1901 to 1905 Campbell served as solicitor general for Ireland and in 1903 was returned to Westminster as an MP for TCD, a seat he retained until 1916. A unionist spokesperson, Campbell became a hate-figure for many nationalists and was dubbed ‘Jim Crow’ – the image of the crow applied to unionists who dredged up every discreditable story about Irish affairs to relay to British audiences. With the establishment of the Irish Free State, Lord Glenavy accepted a nomination to the Seanad, serving until 1928. He died in 1931.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nVisit the Dictionary of Irish Biography to learn more\n\nCostello, Eileen\n\nIndependent | Elected by Dáil Éireann\n\nAn Irish language enthusiast, folksong collector and political activist, Eileen Costello was born Edith Drury in London.

De Valera returned the key to him many years later in Dáil Éireann. He was the Mayor of Kilkenny from 1919-1925 and was elected to the Seanad in 1922. He lost his seat at the 1925 election.

A Roman Catholic, Esmonde was appointed chamberlain of the Vatican household and held this position under four popes. Esmonde's interest in Sinn Féin was signalled by his role as co-founder and financial backer of the Enniscorthy Echo, the first local paper to unequivocally endorse Sinn Féin. Esmonde's principal contribution to the Sinn Féin movement was the fundraising device of selling postage stamps which Sinn Féin supporters bought and attached to their letters in addition to those required by law.

He became the last owner of The Freeman’s Journal, the newspaper founded in 1763 that was an ally to the Irish party at Westminster.

He played a significant role in the process leading to the 1921 Treaty. Once the government decided to explore settlement possibilities, Fitzgerald was able to use his standing as a newspaper proprietor to act as an intermediary between Sinn Féin and Dublin Castle.
