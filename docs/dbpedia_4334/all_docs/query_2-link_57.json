        "text": "This month’s topic is a continuation of last month’s with 30 more songs of mostly older three-chord rock and roll that only the most crazed music fans (like me) would ever remember. This is the kind of music I grooved to in the ’60s (and later – though my back won’t let me be as groovy today, sadly). They are songs that were either not big hits or were album tracks. These are mostly primitive caveman old school rock tunes for fans of old guy music. I frankly couldn’t stop with just 25 last month and you might want to check out that post as well sometime. I did posts on Random Rare Records January and February of 2022 if you want more rare rock. As always comments are welcome and even encouraged as long as they relate to the topic at hand.\n\n26.John “Juke” Logan – Old Old Man\n\nI had to create the youtube video for this which tells me that it isn’t widely known which is a pity. When I bought the rockin’ blues comp L.A. Ya Ya back in 1990, the lyrics of this song didn’t mean as much to me as now since I have become a (middle-aged?) old man. It was written by Lefty Frizzell and released on a single in Dec. 1952 a few weeks after I was born. As “I’m An Old, Old Man (Tryin’ To Live While I Can)” it hit #3 on the country charts the following year. Logan rocked it up pretty good for his version taking out all the twang. John Logan (born Sept. 11, 1946 in L.A. and passing in Aug. 30, 2013) got his nickname from the old harmonica tune “Juke” (Little Walter) that he loved to play. He was mainly a sideman and is known for playing on the themes to the sitcoms Roseanne and Home Improvements plus records by folks like Richard Marx and Adam Sandler.\n\n27.Mike Smith – High School Confidential\n\nHere’s one of the best voices of rock and roll doing a classic oldie. The late Mike Smith was the singer and keys-man with The Dave Clark Five, the first rock and roll band to grab me back in 1965. In 1990 he put out an outstanding U.K.-only CD on Mooncrest It’s Only Rock N Roll that rocked from beginning to end. There were three originals plus some great oldies including this Jerry Lee Lewis piano pounder. The original written by Ron Hargrave and Jerry Lee Lewis hit #21 in the U.S. back in 1958 and was titled after the movie it was featured in. Smith was such a nice man to meet (thanks for the intro Randy Jay!) and for such a quiet man he sure rocked like mad when we saw him at an oldies concert at Fiddler’s Green only a few months before his horrific accident. He lived from Dec. 6, 1943 till Feb. 28, 2008 having been paralyzed in a 2003 fall outside his home.\n\n28.Dr. Feelgood – She’s The One\n\nThis was a 1982 U.K. non-chart single from my fave Dr. Feelgood LP Fast Women & Slow Horses. They formed in 1971 and were part of a style known as pub-rock that celebrated back to basics rock and roll. Their name was a tribute to the old song by Dr. Feelgood & The Interns (1962). In the U.K. their LPs had some success in the mid-70s when Wilko Johnson was on guitar. A bit later several singles did chart with new guitarist Gypie Mayo (both are now deceased). This song featured Johnny Guitar formerly of The Count Bishops and was produced by the late-great Vic Maile. The band still exists with all new members following the death of frontman Lee Brilleaux in 1994. The original of this song was a 1964 chart single (#33) for the Washington, D.C. band The Chartbusters.\n\n29.Rod Stewart – Blondes Have More Fun\n\nEven during what was a pretty dreary period in his career for a rocker like me, rockin’ Rod could still deliver the goods when he wanted to bring the heat. This was from his LP of the same name that featured a disco song I used to loathe “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy” (1978 #1) and was written by Rod and guitarist Jim Cregan. He was born in London on Jan. 10, 1945 and is still a fantastic performer as Aimee and I saw at Ball Arena on Aug. 1, 2023 (okay, even the aforementioned “…Sexy” sounded great).\n\n30.Dash Rip Rock – Dizzy Miss Lizzy\n\nSince I had to create this video so I could use it here I assume that not too many folks know this hot rockin’ track from the 1993 Tiger Town album. The Baton Rouge, Louisiana band is still going, led by singer/guitarist Bill Davis. Their style has been called cowpunk which is a mix of various American roots styles. “Dizzy Miss Lizzy” is known best to us Baby Boomers as from the Beatles VI LP. The original was by the composer, Larry Williams who took it #69 in 1958. Williams lived from May 10, 1935 till Jan. 7, 1980 when he was found with a gunshot in his head. While ruled a suicide, some believe he was killed due to his involvement in illegal activities.\n\n31.Ian McLagan – La De La\n\nMcLagan was the keysman with The (Small) Faces then later played as a sideman with The Rolling Stones. He certainly didn’t have the voice of his bands former lead singers Steve Marriott or Rod Stewart, but he could still rock. In 1979 he released his first solo album (Troublemaker) which led off with this McLagan original. He was English born on May 12, 1945 and passed away in Austin, Texas Dec. 3 2014.\n\n32.Stevie Wright – Hard Road\n\nThe former lead singer of Australian band The Easybeats put on his best Steve Marriott (Humble Pie) voice for this rocker – the first (non-chart) single from his solo album of the same name. His next single “Evie” hit #1 in Australia, but that one didn’t move your blogger like “Hard Road”. Off and on he had major substance abuse issues that certainly didn’t help his career or his health. He passed away Dec. 27, 2015 a week after his 68th birthday.\n\n33.Mott – Good Times\n\nAfter Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson left Mott The Hoople, the renamed Mott (with two new members) put out a couple of decent albums with this exciting rocker being the highlight by far. It was from their second (and last) record Shouting & Pointing (1976). The song was written by Easybeats members George Young and Harry Vanda and was a #22 hit in Australia (1968). Mott morphed in to British Lions then faded away.\n\n34.The Skeletons – St. Louis\n\nAnother Easybeats single written by Vanda and Young, “St. Louis” charted at #21 in Australia (#100 in the U.S.) in 1969. Before morphing in to The Morells (then back) then The Park Central Squares, this Springfield, MO. band put out several albums including Waiting from 1992. They are all worth owning if obscure.\n\n35.Brownsville – Down The Road Apiece\n\nFor a song that began as a 1940 boogie woogie tune by The Will Bradley Trio, this has become a rock and roll standard recorded by The Rolling Stones and Foghat among others. Aside from the rocked-up tempo and feel, the musicians in the lyrics of the first verse were also changed (such as the drummer ‘Eight Beat Mack’ became Charlie McCoy in the newer versions). It was written by Don Raye, a white guy who wrote (or co-wrote) some pretty nifty songs including “Beat Me Daddy, Eight To the Bar”, “The House Of Blue Lights”, “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy” and “The Ballad Of Thunder Road”. As a non-smoker I was never a fan of Brownsville Station’s hit “Smokin’ In The Boys Room” (#3 in 1973), but when they shortened their name and released Air Special in 1978 I grabbed it up for this song plus other hot rockers. The primary singers and guitarists have passed (Cub Koda in 2000 and Bruce Nazarian in 2015), but there is still a version of the band out there with the old rhythm section Mike Lutz and ‘H Bomb’ Weck.\n\n36.Alvin Stardust – A Wonderful Time Up There\n\nHere is another old song (1947) that received new life when given a rock and roll makeover. The writer Lee Roy Abernathy recorded it as “Gospel Boogie” (Leroy Abernathy Homeland Harmony Quartet). Pat Boone’s early career was built upon covering black music for white teens (starting with him charting in 1955 with “Two Hearts” by Otis Williams & The Charms). He later emerges as a well-known Christian and recorded “Gospel Boogie” under the title “A Wonderful Time Up There” making it a #4 hit in 1958. Another Christian convert, Alvin Stardust (Shane Fenton – real name Bernard Jewry) hit #56 in 1981 over in England with that same track. Here in the U.S. Alvin was unknown except to Glitter-rock fans like your’s truly (“You, You, You”, “Jealous Mind”, etc.). For really hardcore Glitter fans – the first Alvin Stardust hit in the U.K. “My Coo Ca Choo” (#2 – 1973 in England) was recorded by Peter Shelley who didn’t want to tour, so Jewry took over the name and recorded all the rest of the hits. He had previously taken over another stage name in 1961 (Shane Fenton) because the original Fenton (a 17 year old kid named Johnny Theakston) died unexpectedly. Alvin/Shane/Bernard passed Oct. 23, 2014 at the age of 73. He is the middle picture in our intro.\n\n37.Mike Berry – I’m A Rocker\n\nHere is another British rock star that was unknown in the U.S. unless you bought import records like “Tribute To Buddy Holly” (#24 in the U.K. 1961 and produced by the legendary Joe Meek). I grabbed a U.S. comeback LP of his in 1979 on Cleveland International Records – I’m A Rocker which featured this nifty track along with “Hard Times” which is also worth checking out. The original of this was written and performed in 1975 by Chas (Hodges) & Dave (Peacock) but didn’t chart. Michael Bourne was born Sept. 24, 1942 and in addition to singing also had a career in England as an actor.\n\n38.The Inmates – Sweet Nuthin’s\n\nAt the age of 14 1/2 Brenda Lee was already a seasoned music performer when she took Ronnie Self’s “Sweet Nothin’s” to #4 in 1959 as her first big hit. England’s Inmates recorded a new rockin’ version for their import-only album Fast Forward in 1989. I listed singer Bill Hurley as one of my favorite male singers in my July 2023 blog post. The rest of the band rocks pretty good as well as we saw back on Feb. 27, 1980 at the old Rainbow on Evans and Monaco in Denver (now a Walgreens). A good quality bootleg CD of that show exists.\n\n39.Dave Edmunds – Standing At The Crossroads\n\nI almost didn’t include Dave as it seems that he is in so many of my posts but there is a reason for it – dude was one heck of a great rocker in his day and remains my favorite solo artist of all-time. If there is one artist I would have loved to talk to over any others it would have been him. I could have put any number of his songs here but let’s go with a Mickey Jupp composition. It was from Dave’s 1994 album Plugged In on which he played all the instruments just like he likely did on his first hit “I Hear You Knocking” (#4 here in the U.S. back in 1970). Dave was born on April 15, 1944 in Cardiff, Wales. These next few songs on the list relate to him in some way.\n\n40.Nick Lowe – You Got The Look I Like\n\nNick was Edmunds’ bass playing/songwriting partner in Rockpile for years and is another artist that I could have put any number of great rockers on this list from. This grinding monkey-beat rocker is found on his 1990 record Party Of One and was produced by Edmunds (plus he played guitar). I once got to talk to Nick after a show and he was a gracious gentleman signing a couple of CDs – thanks! My rocknroll retired dental hygienist wife and I along with one of the coolest rocknroll Dentists in Denver (Chuck Fischer) caught Nick with Los Straitjackets at the Oriental Theatre and can attest that he can still rock. He was born in Surrey, England March 24, 1949.\n\n41.Moon Martin – Don’t You Double (Cross Me Baby)\n\nThe second track on the 1983 Dave Edmunds album was a cover of this nifty rocker written by John ‘Moon’ Martin. Moon’s take was on his 1982 Capitol records LP Mystery Ticket. While he had his own charter with “Rolene” (#30 in 1979), he is best known for writing “Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)” which Robert Palmer made in to a hit. He was Oklahoma born on Oct. 31, 1945 and stopped rockin’ the planet May 11, 2020. He is the far right picture in the intro.\n\n43.Foghat – Fool’s Hall Of Fame\n\nAs I discussed in part one of this blog last month, the three members of Savoy Brown not named Kim Simmonds abandoned that blues rock band and formed Foghat in 1971. They brought in slide guitarist Rod Price and went on to much bigger success as a boogie rock band here in the U.S. with songs like “Slow Ride” and “Fool for the City”. Their first self-titled LP (1972) was produced by Dave Edmunds and was darn good from beginning to end with songs like “Maybelline” and this Lonesome Dave Peverett composition. While a version of Foghat is still going with drummer Roger Earl as the only original member, Peverett passed in 2000 and Price in 2005.\n\n44.Shakin’ Stevens & The Sunsets – 40 Days\n\nHere is yet another Dave Edmunds production and was found on the 1970 LP A Legend. This was still a decade before Shakin’ Stevens became a U.K. superstar with a string of great rock and roll singles. If you love hot rockin’ 50s-style music you need to own at least his greatest hits on album though pretty much his whole career is worth a listen accept maybe his newer releases. Stevens was born Michael Barratt March 4, 1948 in Cardiff, Wales (Dave Edmunds’ birthplace as well).\n\n45.Nick Curran & The Lowlifes – Baby You Crazy\n\nHoly cow, is this the most out of control a white man has ever sounded on record?! Curran channeled his inner Little Richard on this track from his last album Reform School Girl (2010). It was written by Curran with bassist Billy Horton. Nick had played guitar with the rockabilly artist Ronnie Dawson, The Fabulous Thunderbirds and others. He developed oral cancer and passed way too young having lived from Sept. 30, 1977 till Oct. 6, 2012.\n\n46.Webb Wilder – Down On The Farm\n\nMississippi born (May 19, 1954) John Webb McMurry (Webb Wilder) has always felt like a U.S. Dave Edmunds to me combining elements of country, r&b and monkey-beat rock and roll. This track was from Webb’s third album – Doo Dad 1991 – and was originally done by the composer/pianist “Big” Al Downing with The Poe Cats in 1958. Even though I don’t think Webb was too impressed by my questions when I talked to him after a show years ago (sorry Webb), I still dig his music a lot and hope he gets back to Colorado some day. Webb is the far left picture in the intro.\n\n47.J.D. McPherson – Scandalous\n\nJonathan David McPherson is an Oklahoma born (April 14, 1977) rock & roller. While I hope he made good money backing up Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, I sure pray he keeps recording on his own and finally cuts loose on an all-out rocker. Gotta love “Fire Bug” too. From his debut Signs & Signifiers album in 2010 (2012 on Rounder), this is the most recent track on this list along with one from Nick Curran.\n\n48.McGuinness Flint – Who You Got To Love\n\nIn 1970 when I bought the debut McGuinness Flint LP for the song “When I’m Dead & Gone”, it felt like a British LP akin to the music of The Band. The songs were mainly written by Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle including this uptempo rock track which was unlike anything else on the record. Tom McGuiness had played bass and guitar with Manfred Mann (“Do Wah Diddy Diddy” #1 in 1964) while Hughie Flint had drummed for John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. Singer/keys-man Dennis Coulson was the fifth member.\n\n49.The Blues Band – 29 Ways\n\nIn 1979 McGuinness and Flint teamed with the original Manfred Mann lead singer and harmonica player Paul Jones to form The Blues Band. Guy Fletcher was on bass and Dave Kelly on slide guitar. This Willie Dixon cover was on their second import-only album Ready (1980). Dixon’s 1956 original was pretty primitive blues which did have a nice sax break. The Blues Band rocked it up more than Koko Taylor’s bluesy take had back in 1969.\n\n50.John Entwistle – Do The Dangle\n\nThis track proved what I have said about my musical tastes over the years – that I don’t always pay attention to the lyrics and just like a record if it sounds good. When I bought The Who bassist John Entwistle’s 3rd solo album Rigor Mortis Sets In (1973), this old-timey rocker really grabbed me. The fact that he sings about 2 silly dances (“the wheezey” and “the strike”) and one very disturbing one (“the dangle” about hanging yourself) wasn’t important to me – all I cared about was that it rocked. In general John wrote songs about odd topics such as an arachnid (“Boris The Spider”) and a vindictive spouse (“My Wife”).\n\n51.Sweet – Peppermint Twist\n\nThis is one of my fave rock and roll performances ever. I always have to crank up the old hi-fi when it comes on. Let’s be honest, handclaps always make a rock song better. It was on the 1974 album Sweet Fanny Adams which was criminally not released here in the U.S. (some tracks were included on Desolation Boulevard but not this cut). The song was originally done by Joey Dee & The Starliters and was a #1 in 1961. It was written by Joey Dee (Joseph Di Nicola) with Henry Glover about doing the dance ‘the twist’ at the club his band played at – The Peppermint Lounge.\n\n52.Creedence Clearwater Revival – It Came Out Of The Sky\n\nBack in my late ’60s Broomfield High days, it felt like John Fogerty single-handedly brought American rock and roll to the charts. This hot rocker was from the 4th CCR LP Willy & The Poor Boys (1969). John sings here about a farmer named Jody who presumably sees a UFO and how he then becomes a phenomenon. Fogerty also sang about Jody in “Hey Tonight” and “Almost Saturday Night”. I fear that John misconstrued a comment I made to him backstage at Red Rocks which I still feel badly about (you only get seconds when you meet these folks). We were told not the mention CCR as he was not in a good place with his old music and former bandmates at that time. As I really wanted him to write another song about Jody, I innocently said that I hoped he would tell us more about Jody sometime. I suspect he thought I was, in a round-about way, asking him to play his old songs. Sorry John – but I still wish you would update us on what Jody has been up to all these years!\n\n53.Jimmy & The Mustangs – Lovin’ Machine\n\nIt was important to add this song to highlight the forgotten man who recorded it before rock and roll was the term for the music on every teenager’s radio. Omaha-born Wynonie Harris (Aug. 24, 1915 to June 14, 1969) took this song to #5 on the R&B charts early in the year of my birth (1952). In 1948 he had a #1 with a cover of Roy Brown’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight”, long before we think of rock and roll’s formation. “Lovin’ Machine” has on the label the writing credit O.O. Merritt, Dave Lambert and Lois Mann (curiously, modern listings omit Mann). Weirdly pop singer Teresa Brewer released a big band arrangement of it in 1952 which didn’t chart. Since their formation in 1979, the only constant member of Jimmy & The Mustangs has been Jimmy Haddox (aka Jimmy Silvers). Their debut album (Hey Little Girl) didn’t get much attention back in 1982 so your Dentist had to create a youtube video to go along with this entry.\n\n54.The Beach Boys – All I Want To Do\n\nThe 15th Beach Boys album was 20/20 (Feb. 1969) and had some of their best rockers in years including “Do It Again” and “Bluebirds over the Mountain”. This might be the toughest rocker they ever did. It was written by drummer Dennis Wilson with Stephen Kalinich. Here Dennis plays the piano with Mike Kowalski pounding the skins (Mike Love growled the lead). Don’t confuse this great rocker with the song “All I Wanna Do”, a lethargic song on their next album Sunflower.\n\n55.The Dragsters – Gidget Beach\n\nLet’s end this list with a forgotten record that I had to create a video for in order to include. Released on Great Jones (a division of Island in 1989), Stoked was loaded with surf and car music in the vein of groups like The Rip Chords and The Beach Boys. There have been several different bands with this same name. These guys (Dan Acker-bass, Chris Johns-drums, Pete Linzell-sax + guitar and Todd Novak-guitar + vocals) were from New York. I also created a video for the song “Dragster Beach” if you find you want some more Dragsters.\n\nFor this month’s topic your blogger didn’t have some deep meaning in mind, but rather mostly older three-chord rock and roll that only the most obsessive music fans would likely remember. This is the kind of music I liked as a kid in the ’60s (and later when bands tried to copy it) that were either not big hits or were album tracks. I still slide back to it when I need a jump-start of adrenaline. Don’t expect anything more than primitive lizard-brain music but if you like rock when it still rolled then dig in. I frankly couldn’t stop with just 25 so next month’s post will add 30 more. By the way, I did two posts on Random Rare Records January and February of 2022 if you want more rare rock.\n\n1.Cat Mother & The All Night Newsboys – Good Old Rock ‘N’ Roll\n\nBack between my junior and senior years at Broomfield High in the summer of 1969, this was a #21 U.S. hit. They started out in New York City in 1967. After psychedelia had pushed old-school rock & roll off the charts, this was a return to basics being a medley of songs like “Sweet Little Sixteen” and “Chantilly Lace”. This was from their first album The Street Giveth… and the Street Taketh Away which was produced by Jimi Hendrix of all people – it’s not heavy, bluesy or psychedelic which would be the style you’d expect from Jimi. The young me was shocked after buying their second LP Albion Doo-wah and finding they had changed their sound to a rootsy style (sort of like The Band) eschewing good old rock and roll. In truth that album grew on me, but I still go back to this their first single as what I like the most. By the way, The Dave Clark Five did a cover version that charted at #7 in the U.K. in 1969.\n\n2.Steppenwolf – Berry Rides Again\n\nHere is the song that inspired this post as for some reason I found this going through my brain a few weeks back. Yes I bought the LP for the song “Born To Be Wild”, but this roots-rocker and “Sookie Sookie” were my other faves from their 1968 debut. Singer John Kay (Joachim Krauledat) wrote the song by stringing together the titles of old Chuck Berry classics like “Nadine” and “Maybelline” in to a story about old girlfriends. In 1968 this actually was pretty radical to be doing basic rock and roll as rock had gotten heavier and more complex. Michael Monarch plays some tasty Berry licks while Goldie McJohn really rocks the 88s a la Johnnie Johnson (Berry’s piano player).\n\n3.NRBQ – Mama Get Down Those Rock & Roll Shoes\n\n1969 was the year bands started edging towards basic rock and roll again and this Columbia LP grabbed my entertainment dollars back when I didn’t have much of them to spend. It was actually their cover of the old Eddie Cochran song “C’mon Everybody” that first enthralled the young me. They were originally a southern rock band called The New Rhythm & Blues Quartet which was shortened to NRBQ. The intro pictures show them at the far left. They’re still going today with pianist Terry Adams being the only original member left (he also wrote this rocker).\n\n4.The Electric Flag – Wine\n\nLet’s stay on the Columbia records label with a track from the first album by a band that was sort of a super group of ’60s blues/r&b players. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and drummer Buddy Miles are the best known though singer Nick Gravenites, keys-man Barry Goldberg and bassist Harvey Brooks were big names too. Originally Mitch Ryder was asked to be the singer but he declined. Their debut record A Long Time Coming ended with this rockin’ reworking of the old Sticks McGee song “Drinkin’ Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee” (#2 r&b in 1949). When I bought this album in 1968 I was a bit disappointed as there weren’t enough tracks like this and “Killing Floor”. They are the middle band pictured in our intro.\n\n5.Savoy Brown – Let It Rock (Rock & Roll On The Radio)\n\nThe only constant with the British blues group Savoy Brown was change with only one member lasting through all their albums – the late Kim Simmonds (guitarist). With all their line-up changes, there were two main eras us fans remember starting with their formation in 1965. The main core of that band left to form Foghat in 1970 leaving Simmonds alone to rebuild. This song was from the 1971 LP Street Corner Talking which was the first with Dave Walker on lead vocals along with three members from fellow British blues band Chicken Shack. One of those new members was keys-man Paul Raymond who had replaced Christine Perfect in Chicken Shack when she married John McVie and joined his band Fleetwood Mac. Paul composed and sang this song for Savoy Brown before eventually leaving to join UFO and their various offshoots. The lyric references Sticks McGee and his song about wine, by the way. Simmonds lived from Dec. 5 1947 till Dec. 13 2022.\n\n6.Warren Phillips & The Rockets – Blue Jean Boogie\n\nWhile Savoy Brown was recording the 1969 LP A Step Further, members Lonesome Dave Peverett, Roger Earl, Tony Stevens and Bob Hall knocked out a quick set of oldies. The record was only released overseas as The World Of Rock & Roll by Warren Philllips & The Rockets. Much later when Foghat was successful it was released in the U.S. by London Records under the title Before Foghat Days which is how I found it back in 1979. “Blue Jean Boogie” was one of the band originals on the album and is found at 4:45 in to this video as all I could find was the entire album posted.\n\n7.Fleetwood Mac – Tallahassee Lassie\n\nLet’s return to Fleetwood Mac with this Freddy Cannon stomper that the Peter Green-led act recorded for a March 1969 BBC radio session. I had wanted to feature the 1970 solo album Jeremy Spencer and the song “You Made A Hit” but every time a record is posted on youtube from that album, it gets deleted. This track is a pretty good 2nd choice and seems more typical of the oldies that Spencer liked than the blues Green liked – go figure as Greeny sings lead. The 3rd guitarist at this time was Danny Kirwan who played on their next album Then Play On which was way different than this rocker. The song was written by Bob Crewe, Frank Slay and Frederick Picariello (Cannon’s real name). It got to #6 in the U.S. and #17 in the U.K. back in 1959. By the way, as usual this proves my point that all rock and roll is better with handclaps. A note for all you youngsters – don’t be confused as this is an early version of the totally differerent sounding pop band of the same name from years later that dumped the blues as fronted by Buckingham and Nicks.\n\n8.Ten Years After – Going Back To Birmingham\n\nAnother bigtime British blues band of the late ’60s and early ’70s was Ten Years After with guitar and vocals handled by the late Alvin Lee. Their eighth LP Positive Vibrations came out in 1974 and included this Little Richard cover. It was their last album of new material for fifteen years as Lee moved on to a solo career. Alvin lived from Dec. 19, 1944 till March 6, 2013 when he passed on during routine treatment to correct artial arrhythmia proving there is no such thing as simple surgery.\n\n9.Canned Heat – Big Fat\n\nHere’s another blues group but in this case an American one. This was an amped-up version of the 1949 Fats Domino song “The Fat Man” that frankly doesn’t get the recognition it deserves for being proto-rock and roll long before it existed (at least in name). The lyrics are a bit different (Fats for instance says he weighs 200 pounds while Bob Hite says 300) and the rolling piano and scat vocal break is replaced by Hite’s nasty blues harmonica. When your future Dentist bought the Hallelujah album by Canned Heat in the summer of 1969, it was a big let-down from Living The Blues and the hit “Going Up The Country”. The only redeeming song for me was this rocker. These guys are the far right band pictured in our intro.\n\n10.Chicken Shack – Unlucky Boy\n\nBarrelhouse piano man Champion Jack Dupree waxed the song “Chicken Shack” so it was only fitting that the British blues band of that name should record a song written by him (along with Big Mama Thornton). Thornton’s take on “Unlucky Girl” was far more bluesy and slowed down while Stan Webb’s outfit rocked it up after changing the gender and making it the title of their 1973 Deram label LP. By this point, Webb was the last original member with Christine Perfect (McVie) having left for Fleetwood Mac and the rest of the band for Savoy Brown. As this is being written, Webb (born Feb. 3, 1946 in London) still leads a version of the band.\n\n11.Mungo Jerry – Baby Let’s Play House\n\nIn the U.S. this British group are known strictly for the #3 1970 single “In The Summertime”. When that song came out, I picked up their debut album on the Janus label which included this faithful cover of the old Elvis Presley rockabilly song on the Sun label (1955). His was a reworked cover of an Arthur Gunter original and was paired with “I’m Left, You’re Right, She’s Gone”. Mungo Jerry was far more successful in the U.K. than in the U.S. and was led by Ray Dorset. One of the original members was pianist Colin Earl who was the brother of the Savoy Brown/Foghat drummer Roger Earl.\n\n12.Long John Baldry – Don’t Try To Lay No Boogie Woogie On The King Of Rock & Roll\n\nOn the strength of this rocker your Dentist layed down his hard-earned $2.99 at Budget Tapes & Records back in 1971 and bought the LP It Ain’t Easy. As it turned out that and the title track were the only songs I liked which was your fear prior to the internet which now allows you to sample music before you buy it to see if the whole record is decent. At 6’7 John was tall hence the ‘Long’. He was involved with the early British blues scene and led a band that at one time or another included Rod Stewart and Elton John so each of them produced one side of this LP, his most successful. He had a couple of big ballad hits in the U.K., but this single was his biggest in the U.S. at #73. It was an edit of the 6:46 LP version that took out the 3+ minute rap at the start about John getting arrested for busking on the streets of London. The original hit was by Minnesota band Crow in 1970 (#52) and was written by Jeff Thomas who also recorded it. Both their versions were slower and didn’t have the same drive. Several of the Rolling Stones had also been in an early band with Baldry and if you listen to the intro to their 1966 live LP Got Live If You Want It you can hear John announce them before “Under My Thumb”. He lived from Jan. 12, 1941 till passing away in Canada on July 21, 2005.\n\n13.The Guess Who – Don’t You Want Me\n\nThe 1974 Road Food LP included the big hits “Star Baby” and “Clap For The Wolfman”. The Burton Cummings original “Don’t You Want Me” first appeared as the third song in the comedic music medley “Hi Rockers!” from the 1972 Rockin’ LP. Here it is taken from the medley as a stand-alone ’50s piano-driven throwback. By the time I bought the Road Food album, guitarists Kurt Winter and Donnie McDougall had departed to be replaced by Dom Troiano. It was this version of the band that I raced to the mall (Villa Italia or Westland I think) back in the day to meet and get autographs on my album. While I enjoyed talking to Burton, as I recall it was a real Spinal Tap moment as I think I was about the only person there to meet the band.\n\n14.Flash Cadillac & The Continental Kids – Betty Lou\n\nAfter reading a glowing review of their self-titled debut Epic LP in the short-lived Phonograph Record Magazine, I had to buy this excellent album of covers and band originals. Little did I realize that they were a Colorado band who I would become close to and write an article about many years later (see my blog from Jan. 2016 for an update of that piece). At this point in 1972 they were about to be riding high from appearing in the 1973 movie American Graffiti as Herby & The Heartbeats (and later as Fish & The Fins in a 1975 episode of Happy Days). “Betty Lou” was a Kris Moe original that they redid for their 1997 CD Rock & Roll Rules. Moe, Sam McFadin and Linn Phillips III are sadly gone now with original bassist Warren Knight occasionally still leading a new Flash Cadillac in concert.\n\n15.Johnny Winter – Slippin’ & Slidin’\n\nThe star of this Little Richard cover from the 1969 Second Winter LP is Johnny’s brother Edgar who pounds some mean piano and adds a tasty sax break. I honestly don’t know if there was ever another double album like this that only used three sides of the vinyl while leaving one blank. That was done to make the music loud on the original record by cutting the grooves deeply in to the vinyl. It worked and this was a better record than his self-titled debut Columbia album from the same year. Johnny was a great blues guitarist from Texas (Feb. 23, 1944 till July 16, 2014) while his brother was two years younger. Being albinos made them a rarity in music. Writing credit has been listed as by Richard Penniman, Edwin Bocage, Al Collins and James Smith.\n\n16.Delaney & Bonnie – Soul Shake\n\nHere is an album your blogger bought back in 1970 on the strength of this one song which also charted as a single at #43 – shoulda just grabbed the 45. This was a cover of a record from 1969 by Peggy Scott and Jo Jo Benson that hit #37 on the U.S. charts. The song was written by Margaret Lewis and Myrna Smith (of The Sweet Inspirations). The Scott and Benson version rocked but used a cheesy electric sitar guitar on the breaks whereas the Delaney & Bonnie version had full instrumental backing. Most of these players ended up backing Eric Clapton, Leon Russell and Joe Cocker over time. The Bramletts were married from 1967 till 1972. Delaney passed following gall bladder surgery at age 69 two days after Christmas 2008.\n\n17.Don Nix – Olena\n\nNix was a southern rocker hailing from Tennessee and this was his only chart record – #94 in 1971. I grabbed the LP back then and frankly didn’t like anything other than this piano-driven rocker. He had played sax with The Mar-Keys (“Last Night”) and then become a well-known behind the scenes guy as an arranger and producer. His biggest influence on the young me (as guitarist and singer) and my drummer buddy Mr. D was with Nix’s composition “Going Down” (Jeff Beck Group) that we often tried to play (badly) in his basement till Dan’s neighbor would call to make us turn down the volume (sorry Cheryl Watkins wherever you are).\n\n18.Badfinger – Rock Of All Ages\n\nThis was included in the 1969 movie The Magic Christian (Peter Sellers, Ringo Starr) and so appeared on the soundtrack LP plus the 1970 Badfinger LP Magic Christian Music on Apple records. Writing credit goes to the three band members who played on it – Tom Evans, Pete Ham and Mike Gibbins (before Joey Molland joined). Production was handled by Paul McCartney who also pounded out a rockin’ piano part. Evans’ histrionic vocal is one of his best. Evans and Ham both came to sad ends (which you can look up online) but while in Badfinger they created some outstanding music.\n\n19.John Lennon with Elephant’s Memory – New York City\n\nLet’s stay on the Apple label for the best song from a John Lennon album best forgotten (and most of his fans have) – Some Time in New York City . In 1972 to follow up his successful Imagine album, John and Yoko with Elephants Memory (as the Plastic Ono Band) released a double LP of strident political songs that critics and fans alike hated. Buried at the end of side one, however, was this pretty darn good rock and roll song about the Lennons’ move to New York (sort of a follow-up to “The Ballad of John and Yoko”). John was a rocker after all and his capable backing band here was Elephant’s Memory who were a New York street band that had charted in 1970 with “Mongoose” (#50). Elephant’s Memory also backed up Chuck Berry on his 1973 LP Bio.\n\n20.The Raspberries – I’m A Rocker\n\nSort of an American version of Badfinger, The Raspberries were more than just Eric Carmen (R.I.P.) though admittedly he did write and sing their most-remembered songs. The guys could flat out rock as can be heard on this track from their third LP – Side 3 (1973 on Capitol records). “I’m A Rocker” was released as a single but barely squeaked in to the charts at #94. It was a toss-up whether to include this song or the equally great “All Through The Night” from their last album Starting Over from 1974 (I urge you to look for that video too).\n\n21.Bobby Fuller Drive – Nervous Breakdown\n\nHere is the newest recording on our list but you would never know it since it sounds like a classic oldie. The song is an Eddie Cochran rocker that was found on his posthumous LP Never to Be Forgotten with writing credit going to TV actor Mario Roccuzzo. Texan Bobby Fuller released his version in 1962 on the small Eastwood label. In 2003 Fuller’s brother Randy (who had been a member of The Bobby Fuller Four) and his band Bobby Fuller Drive (two guys who had played with Bobby in the ’60s also) released the CD Breakin’ Rocks which included this more polished take on “Nervous Breakdown”. The CD title was a reference to his brother’s biggest hit “I Fought The Law”. The track-list was mostly covers of his brother’s songs and was really pretty good if little heard at the time by any but the most dedicated fans. For that reason I’ve included it here even thought its not a stomper. By the way, “Never To Be Forgotten” is also the title of a Bobby and Randy Fuller composition that is also one of the best songs on this album.\n\n22.April Wine – Wanna Rock\n\nThis album track from Canadian band April Wine was found on their most successful LP The Nature Of The Beast (1981). It contained their biggest hit, the ballad “Just Between You and Me”. “Wanna Rock” was written by singer/guitarist Myles Goodwyn as was most of the album. While the band is still going with one original member (guitarist Brian Greenway), Goodwyn passed in 2023 at age 75.\n\n23.Russ Ballard – She Said Yeah\n\nRolling Stones fans may recognize this song as the lead track from their 1965 album December’s Children (And Everybody’s). It was originally the b-side to the 1958 single “Bad Boy” by Larry Williams and was listed as written by Jackson and Christy on his record but G. Roderick, S. Christy and R. Jackson on the Stones record. Other places list Sonny Bono and Roddy Jackson. Ballard was mostly successful as a songwriter but is best known as the singer of “Hold Your Head Up” for Argent (though it was written by Rod Argent and Chris White). This was found on his Barnet Dogs LP from 1980 which contained the #58 chart single “On the Rebound”.\n\n24.Bram Tchaikovsky – I’m A Believer\n\nTake a Monkees hit from 1966 and make it in to a monkey-beat rocker in 1979 in the thankfully fading face of disco and you have grabbed your Dentist’s entertainment dollar. The Bee Gees had just had their last #1 with “Love You Inside Out” and America was ready to burn their leisure suits and start rocking again with groups like The Knack and The Romantics (thanks guys!). Peter Bramall had taken the nom-de-classical-music Tchaikovsky while in the U.K. band The Motors (“Airport”). When he went solo his debut was Strange Man, Changed Man which spawned the #37 hit “Girl of My Dreams”.\n\n25.Paul Collins’ Beat – Will You Listen\n\nThe Beat was lead by Paul Collins and was one of the best bands to come out of the New Wave of rock and roll in 1979/80. While their two Columbia albums are essential purchases, they never found chart success but you still need them if you love guitar rock and roll. Their self-titled 1979 debut is power pop from beginning to end while the 1982 followup The Kids Are The Same exhibits more maturity (though this track from it still rocks like mad). Collins grew up in New York and New Jersey and still occasionally records and tours.\n\nLast month we visited part one of songs with the days of the week in the title and you should read that as well. There are a ton of songs with days of the week in the title so feel free to let me know what I missed. This month we will hit part two but with a bit of a twist at the end – the last three bonus songs don’t mention the days of the week in the title (hey, its my blog so I make the rules). That trio do, however, revolve around the days of the week and are actually what inspired this silly venture in the first place.\n\n1.Nilsson – (Thursday) Here’s Why I Did Not Go To Work Today\n\nWhile online the song is often given as “(Thurday) Here’s Why I Did Not Go To Work Today”, my copy of the 1976 LP omits the word Thursday from the title (as does the wikipedia entry) which is why I didn’t include it in last month’s part 1 list – at least that’s my excuse. Just to stop my friend Randy Jay from whining, here ’tis (which rectifies my omission of Thursday songs). When Harry Nilsson blew his voice out while recording Pussy Cats, I stopped for a bit buying his music since his vocal tone became raspy and unpleasant to me. I admit to passing on the 1976 album Sandman for that reason so I didn’t really know this laconic co-write with session guitarist Danny Kortchmar. From what I can tell, the word Thursday was added to the title when it was included in the 1977 expansion of Nilsson’s The Point! making it a stage musical featuring Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz of The Monkees.\n\n2.The Sandpipers – Come Saturday Morning\n\nMan this was 180 degrees from the music I listened to back in 1970 but it was a big hit at #17 after initally stalling at #83 the year before. A&M reissued it with a new flip side after being nominated for an Academy Award for best song – it was from the movie The Sterile Cuckoo. The songwriters were Fred Karlin and Dory Previn. The Sandpipers were a soft-rock trio whose biggest hit was “Guantanamera” (#9 in 1966). Your young Dentist did not know the meaning of the term soft-rock back in my high school daze – it was ear-bleeding rock and roll for me (hence the current need for hearing aids – ah, the folly of youth).\n\n3.Lynyrd Skynyrd – Tuesday’s Gone\n\nThis ballad was the 2nd track on the 1973 debut album by these Southern rockers – Pronounced ‘Lĕh-‘nérd ‘Skin-‘nérd. Producer Al Kooper played the mellotron string parts. Metallica recorded a nice cover of the song for their 1998 Garage Inc. record. Regarding the lyrics, singer Ronnie Van Zant was quoted as saying that his normal life was forever changed when the band signed a new record deal and this was about his realization of that (though it also speaks of losing a romance). Van Zant wrote it with guitarist Allen Collins.\n\n4.The Easybeats – Friday On My Mind\n\nLast month’s blog post included this song but by Gary Moore and I promised to revisit the track so here is the original version by The Easybeats. Back in the spring of 1967 this single managed a #16 U.S. chart placement belatedly after having gotten to #1 late in ’66 in Australia where they were from. Actually, however, it was recorded in London, England plus all five band members were born in Europe then immigrated to Australia with their families. This song was written by the band’s guitarists: Scottish-born George Young and Dutch-born Harry Vanda who became far more successful later producing the records of Young’s younger brothers’ band ACDC. Young and Vanda also had a short chart run as Flash And The Pan (“Hey, St. Peter”).\n\n5.Sam Cooke – Another Saturday Night\n\nAnother song I promised to revisit was this cut as last month I posted Cat Stevens’ version. Born in Clarksdale, Mississippi January 22, 1931, as Sam Cook, he grew up mainly in Chicago. His early musical career saw him singing gospel with The Soul Stirrers before moving to secular music as a solo artist in 1957 starting with the #1 hit “You Send Me” (and with an added ‘e’ in his name). “Another Saturday Night” was a #10 chart record for Cooke in 1963 and was written by him while in Europe staying in a hotel that wouldn’t allow female visitors. Reportedly the swinging drum part was played by Hal Blaine who seemingly played on most of the great ’60s hits. Cooke’s death came Dec. 11, 1964 while staying in a motel and is shrouded in controversy. He was shot by motel manager Bertha Franklin allegedly in self-defense. That account has for years been called to question and some have even wondered if manager Allen Klein was somehow involved (this is however onlly an unproven theory).\n\n6.John Fogerty – Almost Saturday Night\n\nLet’s also revisit this song from last month’s blog post when I included Dave Edmunds’ version. John Fogerty wrote and performed this agreeable easy-rocker for his self-titled solo album from 1975. As a single it was only moderately successful getting to #78 – a far cry from his CCR days. The other single from the album was “Rockin’ All Over the World” (#27). When a big star goes solo you always have to wonder how much more successful their records would have been if released by their former group (in this case Creedence Clearwater Revival). While not a big success, it was covered by a number of artists besides Edmunds including Rick Nelson, The Burrito Brothers and The Searchers. Fogerty (born May 28, 1945 in Berkeley, CA) played all the instruments and handled all the vocals on the album. I love it when an artist becomes self-referential or has a recurring character in their music. This song talks about Jody going to the rodeo while in the CCR song “It Came Out Of The Sky” Jody saw a UFO and fell off the seat of his tractor and in “Hey Tonight” he went to the rodeo. Years ago when G Brown and I got to briefly meet and greet Mr. Fogerty backstage at Red Rocks, I opined that I hoped he would write more songs talking about what Jody was up to. I don’t think he understood what I was saying, but he never has revisited Jody (there is still time John! I really wanna hear about Jody.)\n\n7.Daniel Boone – Beautiful Sunday\n\nWhile this bit of 1972 pop lightness sounds pretty good now, back then your Dentist was having none of this kind of music being more in the thrall of Exile On Main Street (The Rolling Stones), Thick As A Brick (Jethro Tull) and Machine Head (Deep Purple). This 45 peaked in the U.S. at #15 on the Mercury label. Peter Green (changed later to Stirling) was born July 31, 1942 in Birmingham, England. Written by Daniel Boone and Rod McQueen, it was used as the theme-song for the Japanese show Ohayo 720 and became a belated #1 there in 1976. It went on to become the biggest selling song in Japan by an artist that was of Western origin selling over two and a half million copies.\n\n8.Carpenters – Rainy Days & Mondays\n\nBoy if I didn’t dig Daniel Boone while in college, I certainly didn’t get the music of The Carpenters at the time which seemed way too middle-of-the-road for this rocker. Somewhere down the line, I saw the light and today this 1971 #2 hit sounds much better to me showcasing how wonderful Karen Carpenter was as a singer. It was written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols with the drums once again played by Hal Blaine. Karen certainly sounded far more mature and world-weary than having just turned 21. She was born March 2, 1950 in New Haven, Connecticut and passed away far too young Feb. 4, 1983 having collapsed at her parents’ home in Downey, California.\n\n9.Joe Jackson – Sunday Papers\n\nBack in 1979 when the debut Joe Jackson LP Look Sharp! and the single “Is She Really Going Out With Him?” was released, he seemed like another punky new waver. Over the years I have come to appreciate his eclectic talents and have gone back to this record belatedly to take in the quality of the songs. “Sunday Papers” has a reggae feel and mocks the British tabloid press. While the U.K. single didn’t chart, it has been one of his more popular album tracks over the years. David Jackson was born August 11, 1954 in England and grew up in Portsmouth later getting the nickname Joe from a U.K. TV puppet. It was his Night & Day LP in 1982 and the single “Steppin’ Out” that first attracted me to his music.\n\n10.The New Christy Minstrels – Saturday Night\n\nBack in 1961, Randy Sparks put together the initial version of this long-running folk troupe. As a ten-piece, they recorded their first LP of bright sing-along folk music in 1962. While many folk-singers look down on the fairly non-offensive songs as not being classic folk, they (and The Kingston Trio) certainly helped popularize that style of music to a much larger audience. Over the years they had some formidable alumni pass through including Gene Clark (The Byrds), Larry Ramos (The Association), Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes and lead singer Barry McGuire (“Eve Of Destruction”). “Saturday Night” was the non-LP follow-up to the big hit “Green, Green” in 1963 and managed a #29 chart placement here. While the song felt instantly recognizable, it was actually a Randy Sparks composition. Born in Kansas July 29, 1933, Sparks grew up in Oakland and began performing folk music at the Purple Onion in the North Beach section of San Francisco. He passed Feb. 11, 2024.\n\n11.The Drifters – Saturday Night At The Movies\n\nWell let’s stay on Saturday for this entry. Back in 1964 during the British Invasion this #18 single got lost to your Dentist who was a Dave Clark 5 fan as opposed to The Drifters. Frankly it sounds far older than that year. The lead singer was Johnny Moore while the single was written by Brill Building husband and wife composers Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. Belatedly it became a #3 hit in England in 1972. Born in Selma, Alabama, Moore died 15 days after his 64th birthday in 1998 having moved to London, England.\n\n12.The Pogues – Tuesday Morning\n\nBack in the day, this was the only Pogues record I bought as their earlier stuff suffered from god-awful vocals by the late Shane MacGowan who also had horrible teeth as we saw in my February 2023 blog post. When Shane thankfully left, Peter “Spider” Stacy took over singing. This fine piece of Celtic-pop from 1993 was a single drawn from the Waiting for Herb LP.\n\n13.The Click Five – Friday Night\n\nWhen the debut Click Five album Greetings from Imrie House came out in 2005, your blogger embraced their power-pop music plus their retro mop-top Beatle haircuts that recalled the New Wave/skinny-tie bands of 1979/80. Coming out of Boston, they were also popular for a time in Asia. This was an album track written by keyboard player Ben Romans and bassist Ethan Mentzer. By the beginning of 2013 they had broken up.\n\n14.Bowling For Soup – S-S-S-Saturday\n\nWell here is another modern band near and dear to your Dentist as they actually play real instruments and perform catchy guitar-based pop. How can I not love a song that name-checks Ringo Starr? Back in 2011 it was going to be an uphill battle to get a pop-rock record to hit the charts and this single didn’t chart but it was till cool. It was from their eighth studio album Fishin’ for Woos. Formed in Wichita Falls, Texas, you can hear the influence of bands like Green Day and The Ramones. The group’s name comes from a Steve Martin comedy bit.\n\n15.Bay City Rollers – Saturday Night\n\nLet’s move back 35 years from Bowling For Soup for another song about Saturday night. When this became the first #1 in the U.S. bicentennial year of 1976 your blogger didn’t care for these guys at all. Once again it took a few records before their brand of catchy pop earned my music-buying dollars. While they had been having U.K. hits since 1971, this was their first foray in to the U.S. charts (it oddly didn’t chart in England). They first recorded this Bill Martin and Phil Coulter composition in 1973 with a different vocalist before redoing it the following year with new singer Les McKeown for the Rollin’ LP. I remember first seeing this performed in September 1975 on the short-lived disaster that was Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell, not to be confused with the successful Saturday Night Live of the same time. They are the far left picture in the intro.\n\n16.Queen – Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon\n\nThis short trifle was the second album track from the hugely popular Queen LP A Night At The Opera (1975). This campy Freddie Mercury composition and “Seaside Rendezvous” on the same album were in the old-time British Music Hall vein just as “Honey Pie” by The Beatles. Likely folks who bought the album were looking to play the hits “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “You’re My Best Friend” rather than excellent if, however, campy novelties.\n\n17.The Peppermint Rainbow – Will You Be Staying After Sunday\n\nOh my, your Dentist wouldn’t have been caught dead listening to this song back in early 1969. For me it was Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Mothers Of Invention, The Who, etc. – not sunshine pop. Once again, however, this stuff now isn’t so bad and sure sounds a whole lot better to me than hip-hop (boy am I OLD!). This single only managed to hit #32 and sounds like Spanky & Our Gang. It was produced by Paul Leka who earlier had been successful co-writing and producing “Green Tambourine” for The Lemon Pipers (1967). He had even more success later in 1969 with Steam’s “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” – a song that seemingly will never die. The Peppermint Rainbow formed in Baltimore and split up in 1970 after two moderately successful singles.\n\n18.Men Without Hats – On Tuesday\n\nThere is something about the music of this Canadian group that continues to appeal to me. In 2022 they made my year-end best list with their Again, Pt. 2 album just as they first did with “The Safety Dance” back in 1983. Ivan Doroschuk (Oct. 9, 1957 – Champaign, Illinois) writes and sings appealing pop music. This album track was found on the Pop Goes The World album from 1987. The gorgeous flute part was played by Jethro Tull’s Ian Anderson.\n\n19.The Cure – Friday I’m In Love\n\nBack in 1992 this was a #18 U.S. hit (#6 in the U.K.) for Robert Smith’s goth-rock band. It was from their ninth album Wish. Smith, born in Blackpool April 21, 1959, is the only constant in the band that continues to this day. They were inducted in to the Rock Hall of Shame (oops, I mean Fame) back in 2019.\n\n20.Blondie – Sunday Girl\n\nParallel Lines was Blondies’s breakthrough LP back in 1978 due to the huge #1 success of “Heart Of Glass”. In England “Sunday Girl” was the follow-up single and it got to #1 as well. As successful as it was in many parts of the world, for some reason Chrysalis didn’t release it as a 45 here where it was only found on their third studio album. It was written by guitarist Chris Stein ostensibly about lead singer Debbie Harry’s lost cat Sunday Man. This is the original version. For some reason, the version on their Greatest Hits album has a verse sung in French. They are the middle picture in the intro.\n\n21.Elvis Costello & The Attractions – Wednesday Week\n\nWeirdly in 1980 two totally different songs came out from U.K. bands with the title “Wednesday Week”. The Undertones took their song to #11 in the U.K. charts. A far better song was this Elvis Costello penned tune that was one of two b-sides for the single “Accidents Will Happen” in 1979. That song was from his band’s third album Armed Forces. This track wasn’t included on an LP till the compilation album Taking Liberties in 1980. It is a bit of an oddity in that it rocks like mad till a tad over half the song is over when it slows down dramatically. The lyrics seem to be about a fleeting relationship (maybe?). On August 25, 1954 Declan MacManus was born in London. His dad Ross McManus had recorded a version of the Beatles song “The Long & Winding Road” that was released in 1970 as by Day Costello. Declan took that last name and added Elvis for his stage name. By the way, there was also a female-led U.S. pop band in the late 80’s named Wednesday Week (“Why”). They are the far right picture in the intro.\n\n22.U2 – Sunday Bloody Sunday\n\nThe live version of this song (recorded June 5, 1983) is one of the most iconic moments in the history of Colorado’s storied Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Morrison west of Denver. The studio take was originally found on War the 1983 third album by Irish band U2. With the military feel to the drumming it is about the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting of 26 Northern Irish protestors by British troops (14 died). This was the highlight of the 1984 video U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky which almost didn’t happen due to heavy rains yet led to the moody ambience of the shoot with Bono carrying a white flag through the haze with flames illuminating the rocks. The song was written by the band: Bono (vocals), The Edge (guitar), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums).\n\n23.Genesis – Get ‘Em Out By Friday\n\nA protest of a different nature is this song by Genesis when they were a progressive band led by singer Peter Gabriel (and Phil Collins was just the drummer). This band composition (Gabriel, Collins, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks) was on their fourth album Foxtrot (1972). Gabriel’s lyrics are about the forcing out of low rent tenants for redevelopment in order to raise prices. His words take on a satirical bent talking about shortening people via genetic engineering to put in more bodies per area.\n\n24.Chicago – Saturday In The Park\n\nPianist Robert Lamm wrote and sang this song for the album Chicago V (1972). It was a #3 hit when taken from that LP as a single. Lamm was born in Brooklyn Oct. 13, 1944 and said he wrote this song about New York’s Central Park. He plus Lee Loughnane (trumpet) and James Pankow (trombone) are the only remaining original members in Chicago at the time this is being written.\n\n25.Johnny Cash – Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down\n\nWhile it only got to #46 on the U.S. pop charts back in 1970, this was a #1 country hit for Johnny Cash. It was written by Kris Kristofferson and was on his own 1970 LP Kristofferson that also included his compositions “Help Me Make It Through the Night”, “For The Good Times” and “Me and Bobby McGee”. These were all big hits for others. Ray Stevens had a 1969 #81 pop hit (#55 country) with this song before Cash performed it at the Ryman while taping his TV show for ABC which ran from ’69 to ’71. After it was issued as a single, it was awarded the distinction of being Country Music Song Of The Year. Cash lived from Feb. 26, 1932 ( Kingsland, Arkansas) to Sept. 12, 2003 (Nashville, Tennessee).\n\nHere are 3 BONUS SONGS\n\nA.The Beatles – Lady Madonna\n\nYes, I understand that this doesn’t actually fit my criteria since there isn’t a day of the week in the title – that’s why this is a bonus addition. It wouldn’t be a rocknrolldentist blog without The Beatles as you maybe have seen over the years (with a few exceptions). This is what got me thinking about days of the week songs after noticing that Saturday is the only day not mentioned in the lyrics. Gotta figure a three syllable word didn’t fit the rhyme scheme Paul McCartney devised. The words have a couple of clever moments that always tickle me. “Thursday night your stockings needed mending. See how they run.” That always makes me laugh. “Tuesday afternoon is never-ending.” The Moody Blues LP Days Of Future Passed came out in November of 1967 with the song “Forever Afternoon (Tuesday)” so when the Fab Four recorded this song in February 1968 you have to assume Paul had heard it. This non-LP single was a return to rock and roll after the psychedelic records they had been releasing and was meant to tide over the public while the group was in India with the Maharishi. Oddly, this 45 only got to #4 in the U.S. chart while dreck like “Honey” by Bobby Goldsboro topped it – ugh. The piano part recalls an old Humphrey Lyttelton boogie woogie single from 1956 in the U.K. “Bad Penny Blues”. Ronnie Scott played the sax solo. The Rocknroll-daughter Hilary demanded I also mention “Eight Days A Week” – are you happy now?!\n\nB.Dave Edmunds – Here Comes The Weekend\n\nOh no, I’m gonna break the rules yet again with a song that doesn’t mention a day of the week in the title. More often than not, the other artist that turns up in my blog posts is Dave Edmunds. If there is any musician I would have loved to meet it would have been Welsh born DE (April 15, 1944). Dave’s first album for Swan Song (Led Zeppelin’s label) was his third overall as a solo act – Get It (1977). This track was an original by Edmunds and Nick Lowe who played bass and sang with their band Rockpile. As a single this song apparently made #28 in the Dutch charts in 1976. The first verse mentions all five of the weekdays reserving only Friday as anything but misery.\n\nC.Nick Lowe & His Cowboy Outfit – 7 Nights To Rock\n\nHere is our last bonus song that strongly mentions the days of the week but doesn’t have a day in the title. The release date was late summer 1985 for The Rose Of England. This was Lowe’s fourth album after the breakup of Rockpile (his band with Dave Edmunds) plus his second and final with the Cowboy Outfit. Lowe was born March 24, 1959 in Surrey and played bass in Brinsley Schwarz prior to linking up with Edmunds and company. This was a cover of a 1956 recording by Moon Mullican which had backing from Boyd Bennett & His Rockets. Piano player Aubrey Mullican (March 29, 1909 to Jan. 1, 1967) was a country & western artist that helped birth what became rockabilly. The composers were Buck Trail, Henry Glover, and Louis Innis with Glover being one of the few black executives at that time with a record label (King Records which Mullican recorded for). Trail and Innis were white country singers.\n\nBabylon was an ancient city that was a bit south of present day Baghdad. It is said that several thousand years BC the Babylonians decided to organize their days in to a group of seven naming them after the sun, the moon and the five planets they could see. That is from online so it must be right though I have to wonder how they knew they were planets (sadly Carl Sagan isn’t around to help me out). Apparently you move forward to the 12th century BC and the Greeks kept the days named after the sun and moon but decided the other five needed to now be given names from their gods. About the 1st century BC the Romans changed five of the days to their own godly names then the Anglo-Saxons came along about 500 years later blah blah blah. Google it if you care, but this blog for cripes sakes is about rock and roll not astronomy or nomenclature. Your Dentist (ret’d) was thinking the other day about good songs that have a day of the week in the title. A silly idea I know, but there were enough goodies that I decided to break the list up in to two 25 song blog posts so look for part 2 on the 15th of next month. If you are wondering, not one Thursday song made the list. These songs are in some semblance of order starting with:\n\n1.Elton John – Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)\n\nHonestly this guitar-player didn’t care for the piano-centric music of Elton John till this record came out in 1973. It is one of the few songs by Elton that flat out rocks with a nasty guitar riff played by Davey Johnstone. It got to #12 on the U.S. hit parade and was the lead track from his best album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Lyricist Bernie Taupin has said that the words recall bar-fights back in his youth. While I am still not much of a fan of his earlier music, this started me on many years of more often than not buying Elton John’s records which I have grown to love.\n\n2.The Monkees – Pleasant Valley Sunday\n\nFrom 1967 we have this #2 U.S. hit by a nifty band from my youth that has not yet been inducted in to the rock and roll hall of shame in Ohio. The song was written by the husband and wife team of Gerry Goffin and Carole King as a social commentary about suburbia. They had moved from New York City to West Orange, New Jersey and apparently found life in the suburbs lacking. Looking at the personel on the recording, Mike Nesmith plays the great guitar riff sorta reminiscent of “I Want To Tell You” by The Beatles while Peter Tork tickles the keys. They were augmented by Chip Douglas on bass and ‘Fast’ Eddie Hoh on drums (not Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz as in the video) with Bill Chadwick on acoustic guitar. This is a true group song with all four Monkees singing on the record.\n\n3.Cat Stevens – Tuesday’s Dead\n\nLondon born Cat Stevens (Steven Demetre Georgiou at birth on July 21, 1948 and now Yusuf I think) released two of the greatest LPs ever recorded in Tea For The Tillerman (1970) and Teaser & The Firecat (1971). This song which was an album track from the latter could have easily been a single (along with “Bitterblue”). Not only were the songs excellent, but the sound was crisp and pristine (production was by former Yardbirds bassist Paul Samwell-Smith). The song felt powerful even with just acoustic guitars. Showing his many talents, Mr. Stevens also did the cover illustrations to both records. The album which hit #2 on the U.S. and U.K. charts featured the singles “Morning Has Broken”, “Moonshadow” and “Peace Train”.\n\n4.The Bobby Fuller Four – Saturday Night\n\nIn just over one and a half minutes this Bobby Fuller production packs in just about everything your Dentist loves about pop music – chiming guitars, vocal harmonies, powerful percussion and handclaps. Pop records are always better with handclaps. Texan Fuller brought the Buddy Holly sound in to the ’60s notably on “I Fought The Law” (1966 – #9). His Mustang label LP from that year I Fought The Law had some brillliant guitar pop including this Fuller composition. Who knows if he would have created more great music as he either committed suicide swallowing gas (hmmmm) or was murdered. He lived from October 22, 1942 to July 18, 1966.\n\n5.Small Faces – Lazy Sunday\n\nThe album Ogden’s Nut Gone Flake from 1968 was a masterpiece of British psychedelic rock and roll (and it had a cool round fold-open cover too). This Steve Marriott/Ronnie Lane song from it was a #2 U.K. hit though it didn’t chart here. It has a Cockney sing-song vocal approach by Steve Marriott who is one of your Dentist’s favorite singers of all-time – especially with his next band, the hard-rocking Humble Pie (check out my June and July 2023 posts for the full list of fave male singers). The record tells the story of Marriott driving his fellow residents mad playing his music at odd hours and way too loud. While it sounds cheerful and light, apparently he was a rather annoying neighbor. Marriott accidently killed himself allegedly falling in to an alcohol/drug-fueled sleep with a lit cigarette that led to a fire. He lived from January 30, 1947 till April 20, 1991. They are the far right picture in the intro.\n\n6.The Rubettes – Saturday Night\n\nThe only U.S. hit for British band The Rubettes was “Sugar Baby Love” (#37 in 1974), but they had nine chart records in England. That song (a #1 U.K. single) was a studio creation with Paul Da Vinci on vocals. When it became a hit, some of the musicians from that session became the real Rubettes along with new singer Alan Williams. “Saturday Night” was an album track found on their self-titled U.S. LP (Wear It’s ‘At in the U.K.). Like many of their songs, this cut (and “Sugar Baby Love”) was written by the team of Wayne Bickerton and Tony Waddington. They are the far left picture in the intro.\n\n7.Gary Moore – Friday On My Mind\n\nThe Easybeats originated this song, but this is my fave version – by the late great guitarist from Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore. Robert William Gary Moore was born in Belfast on April 4, 1952. His later career was heavily in to the blues (he bought a 1959 Gibson Les Paul from bluesman Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac), but it was his hard rock stuff that got to me at first. The 1987 LP Wild Frontier is my fave by him containing “Over The Hills & Far Away” plus this hard-edged cover. He died from a heart attack while in Spain February 6, 2011. The original was written by George Young and Harry Vanda. I will save more discussion of that version since something tells me we might revisit it in the next blog post. He is the middle picture in the intro.\n\n8.The Moody Blues – Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon)\n\nThe 1967 (1968 in the U.S.) album Days of Future Passed was a radical move for that psychedelic era – record an album with orchestrations plus underpin the sound with a new instrument called a Mellotron – a mini-orchestra in a keyboard. If you want to read about my take on my favorite musical instrument, the Mellotron, check out my June and August 2021 posts. Hitting #24 in 1968, this was the first chart hit for the reconstituted Moody Blues. They had been a blues band with the late Denny Laine in ’65 (“Go Now”) then changed their sound when he left. The Moodies became the face of a new style later called progressive rock with the additions of John Lodge (bass) and Justin Hayward (guitar). This was written and sung by Hayward (born October 14, 1946 in England) about a Tuesday sitting in an English park. Ray Thomas plays the flute solo that fades at the end of the single, but leads to the orchestrated section on the LP. The first single from the album didn’t chart at the time (“Nights In White Satin”), but finally hit #2 in 1972 here which pushed that album to belated success.\n\n9.Cat Stevens – Another Saturday Night\n\nSteven Georgiou would have been a few months shy of his fifteenth birthday when the original Sam Cooke 45 was a hit (#10 in 1963). Once again I won’t go in to detail about Cooke’s version as it will likely show up in part 2 of our theme. This track by Stevens was a non-LP #6 U.S. hit in 1974 and was a rarity for him being a cover song. The 45 was produced by Stevens and had a bit of a ska feel with horns and organ over island percussion.\n\n10.The Mamas & The Papas – Monday Monday\n\nThis John Phillips composition was their only #1 hit. Following the #4 success of their first single “California Dreamin'”, this certainly helped push their 1966 debut LP If You Can Believe Your Eyes & Ears to #1 as well. The lead vocal is by Denny Doherty who was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia on November 29, 1940 and passed January 19, 2007 in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\n11.Spanky & Our Gang – Sunday Will Never Be The Same\n\nTo some extent Spanky & Our Gang had the same sound as The Mamas & The Papas with intricate vocal harmonies over sunshiny folkish pop rock. Lead singer Elaine “Spanky” McFarlane (born June 19, 1942 in Illinois) got her nickname after George McFarland who played Spanky in the old Our Gang comedy movies (also known as The Little Rascals). This single was a #9 U.S. hit in 1967 that was written by Terry Cashman and Gene Pistilli. That duo along with Tommy West formed The Buchanan Brothers who had the hit “Medicine Man” (#22 1969). Cashman and West also produced the Jim Croce records.\n\n12.Melanie C – Suddenly Monday\n\nIn 1999 former Spice Girl Melanie Chisolm released her debut solo LP Northern Star which proved that the lady could sing. It used several different producers which gave it a diverse sound. This album track was handled by Def Jam’s Rick Rubin and certainly sounds nothing like the hip-hop or metal he was producing. Instead it has a jaunty “Penny Lane” Beatles feel that really appealed to your Dentist. The track was written by Chisholm with Matt Rowe, Richard Stannard and Julian Gallagher. It was used in the 2000 British comedy film Maybe Baby which had a really nifty soundtrack that included Paul McCartney performing the old Buddy Holly title tune.\n\n13.The Rolling Stones – Ruby Tuesday\n\nYou wouldn’t expect rocker Keith Richards to write ballads, yet he was responsible for many of them by The Stones including “Angie” and this song about his then girlfriend Linda Keith. Before the drugs took down Brian Jones, he was a wonderful musician that made the music of The Stones more interesting – here using recorder. It was released in early 1967 as the b-side to “Let’s Spend The Night Together” which was too controversial for most U.S. radio stations who flipped the record to make “Ruby Tuesday” a #1 hit. This has some of Charlie Watts’ best drumming I think.\n\n14.The Monkees – Saturday’s Child\n\nYour writer loved the first Monkees album in 1966 which had a plethora of songs that could have been singles (though only “Last Train To Clarksville” was pulled for a 45). Don Kirshner had a number of songwriters and producers submit tunes which The Monkees recorded their lead vocals on. It was written by David Gates who wouldn’t have his own success until 4 years later with Bread. The personnel on the record was listed as Micky Dolenz on lead vocal with backing by Tommy Boyce, Bobby Hart, Wayne Erwin and Ron Hicklin. The guitarists were Wayne Erwin, Gerry McGee and Louis Shelton. Hart played the organ and Billy Lewis the drums (with Gene Estes on tambourine). Future Canned Heat member Larry Taylor handled the bass. The garage-rock guitar riff almost gave the song a Paul Revere & The Raiders sound.\n\n15.Fleetwood Mac – Monday Morning\n\nHere is another album track that easily could have been a single from the 1975 self-titled Fleetwood Mac LP. It was the lead-off track from that record and was written and sung by Lindsey Buckingham. It has an almost Buddy Holly feel and was originally written by Buckingham for a second Buckingham Nicks LP that didn’t happen before they joined Fleetwood Mac.\n\n16.Dave Edmunds – Almost Saturday Night\n\nIt was hard to decide which version of this John Fogerty composition to use, but as Dave Edmunds is your Dentist’s favorite solo act I had to go with this one (but the original may appear next month – stay tuned). The Fogerty recording was on his self-titled 1975 LP and was a #78 charting single. Dave’s 45 got to #54 in 1981 as taken from his LP Twangin… which was his swan song for Swan Song. Welshman Edmunds was born April 15, 1944. Backing here is by his Rockpile mates – Nick Lowe on bass, Billy Bremner on guitar and Terry Williams on drums.\n\n17.Jimmy Buffett – Come Monday\n\nYour Dentist is not a Parrothead being a non-drinker of alcoholic beverages so I have never been a fan of Mr. Buffett’s music. I did however buy this 45 which is a nifty ballad with gorgeous production by former Neon Philharmonic member Don Gant. It might have been the line about wearing Hush Puppies shoes that first appealed to me having worn them on my feet for much of my life (till an old skiing accident required a switch to harder soles – sigh). This was his first U.S. chart hit getting to #30 back in 1974 when taken off the album Living & Dying in 3/4 Time. He was born on Christmas day 1946 in Mississippi and spent much of his early life in Alabama. He passed Sept. 1, 2023.\n\n18.Fats Domino – Blue Monday\n\nAntone ‘Fats’ Domino is never given enough credit for helping to birth what became rock and roll music having waxed “The Fat Man” at the end of 1949. Born in New Orleans February 26, 1928 he passed away in Harvey, Louisiana on October 24, 2017. The man charted 66 singles during the rock era starting in 1955 with his last being a cover of the Beatles song “Lady Madonna”. Paul McCartney has stated that he was trying to sound like Domino on the original. Writing credit here was at first just Dave Bartholomew with the original recording by Smiley Lewis in 1953. His version was a mid-tempo guitar blues with lyrics about how much fun the weekend was compared to the mess that was Monday. Fats made it a piano swinger with his name added to the writing credits on his version. Gotta say that Lewis’ guitar lead break blew away the awful sax solo on Domino’s hit version.\n\n19.Badfinger – Sweet Tuesday Morning\n\nStraight Up was the fourth Badfinger album and was released here just before Christmas 1971 on the Apple label which was owned by The Beatles. It is a toss-up whether this or No Dice was their best record, but if you are a fan of Beatley rock and roll you need both for sure. Badfinger’s tragic story can be found online, but suffice it to say that the stress of poor management and lack of money killed Pete Ham and Tom Evans via suicide. Badfinger are still one of my favorite bands of all-time. This song was an album track written and sung by Joey Molland who at the time of this blog is the last surviving band member. Molland was born June 21, 1947 in Liverpool. His most recent album was back in 2020 when he released Be True To Yourself.\n\n20.The Bangles – Manic Monday\n\nUnder a pseudonym (Christopher) this #2 1986 hit was actually written by Prince and was the first Bangles single to chart here. They included it on their second album Different Light. The lead vocal was sung by guitarist Susanna Hoffs (born in L.A. January 17, 1959).\n\n21.The Hummingbirds – Tuesday\n\nFrom the 1986 U.S. power-pop of The Bangles, let’s transition to the jangle-pop of The Hummingbirds who formed that same year in Australia. The first album by The Hummingbirds loveBuzz (1989) was produced by Mitch Easter from Let’s Active who also handled the first R.E.M. records. It charted in Australia at #31 spawning the Aussie hit single “Blush”. This song was an album track written by singer Alannah Russack and to these ears was better than their hit. The rest of the album was written by the male singer of the band, the late Simon Holmes. By the way their last single (1992) was a non-LP cover of a 1965 song written by Donovan (“You Just Gotta Know My Mind”) for his then girl-friend Dana Gillespie. Her version didn’t come out till 1968 so Karen Verros recorded and released it on Dot first. All 3 versions are great and head-scratchers as to why none ever charted anywhere.\n\n22.David Bowie – Love You Till Tuesday\n\nSpeaking of Dana Gillespie in the last entry, another song was written for her to record – “Andy Warhol” (1971). It was composed by David Bowie who also recorded the track for his Hunky Dory album. David Jones tried to have a hit record from 1964 to 1967 with various singles and an album under his own name or as David Bowie. “Space Oddity” finally broke in to the U.K. charts in 1969 and eventually people noticed his much poppier Deram label records like “The Laughing Gnome”. His final stab at a hit on Deram was this single which was a re-recording of a track from his first album (David Bowie June 1967). The initial version had the riff played on vibraphone and featured his then band. The single version had bassoon, oboe, etc. playing the riff and felt very British music-hall (think Anthony Newley). This video was filmed in ’69 (along with several other songs) to promote Bowie but wasn’t released till 1984. He lived from January 8, 1947 (London) till 10 January 10, 2016 (New York).\n\n23.Mott The Hoople – Saturday Gigs\n\nIn 1972 David Bowie rescued Mott The Hoople from certain dissolution after their album Brain Capers (1971) had failed to chart anywhere. Bowie at first offered Ian Hunter’s band the song “Suffragette City” but they passed so he gave them the better tune “All The Young Dudes” which started their short run of hit singles. This non-LP 45 which started life as “Saturday Kids” was their last studio recording and featured new guitarist Mick Ronson from Bowie’s band. When it could only get to #41 (1974) in the U.K. charts, Ian and Mick split leaving Mott to carry on for a bit with a new singer and guitarist. This song is essentially an autobiographical tune that in retrospect neatly wrapped things up.\n\n24.Def Leppard – High ‘N’ Dry (Saturday Night)\n\nDef Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott is an unabashed Ian Hunter/Mott The Hoople fan even to the point of fronting Down ‘n’ Outz who cover Hunter’s music along with Mott’s other offshoots. His main band Def Leppard (Sheffield, England) came to be in the late ’70s when metal was certainly not a popular genre in the face of disco. It was their third album Pyromania (1983) that led to their breakthrough. This track was from their second LP High ‘N’ Dry – 1981 (the one with the man diving in to a pool) and was produced by Mutt Lange. The late Steve Clark (guitar) plus Rick Savage (bass) wrote the song along with Elliott.\n\n25.The Shirelles – I Met Him On A Sunday (Ronde-Ronde)\n\nIt wasn’t till “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” became a #1 in January 1961 that The Shirelles hit the big-time. This 45 was their first charter here in the U.S. at #49 (1958). Shirley Owens, Doris Kenner, Beverly Lee and Addie (Micki) Harris wrote and sang this song at their Passaic, New Jersey High School talent show as The Poquellos. Luckily for them, one of their fellow students had a mother (Florence Greenberg) who owned a record label (Tiara). Greenberg leased the recording to Decca records. By the way, after a couple of flops, Decca dropped them allowing their hit run on Greenberg’s new label Scepter records. Harris and Coley are deceased.\n\nThere was a time when it seemed like you could count on movies supplying some of the greatest music in any given year. It doesn’t seem that way anymore (with a few notable exceptions). That was the idea behind your aging blogger putting together a list of his fave songs that share the title of the movie they appear in since we just had the Academy Awards. This year’s Oscar winning song from Barbie didn’t move me but I think modern composers aren’t trying to appeal to ancient Caucasian males anyway. Maybe down the road a sequel will follow with movie songs that are titled differently than the movie. One caveat is that the song actually had to appear in the film which unfortunately disqualifies Gene Pitney’s great epic “(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance” which inexplicably didn’t make the cut for that movie. That song, by the way, was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David who appear in the far right photo in our intro. There are some painful omissions which again inspires me to ask for your comments of your personal faves.\n\n1.Theme from Murder At The Gallop – Ron Goodwin\n\nThe MGM 45 uses this title while the Capitol record calls it “Murder She Said” which is another one of these movies that I enjoyed back in the ’60s. Either way this is one of your blogger’s favorite pieces of music as it just makes me smile with its jaunty harpsichord/string olio stirring the senses. It was written and conducted by Brit Ron Goodwin for the four Miss Marple movies that starred Margaret Rutherford in the early ’60s. For my taste there was no better actress who ever played Agatha Christie’s eccentric dowager sleuth. Producer George Martin worked alongside Goodwin on a great many of his records. He scored several British films including Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines and Frenzy. His life spanned Feb. 17, 1925 to Jan. 8, 2003. He is in the middle picture in our intro.\n\n2.Skyfall – Adele\n\nThe James Bond movies have generally had notable theme songs and for my money this is by far the best which I know rocknrollbro-inlaw Matt agrees with me on (sorry, rocknrollsister Cheryl). While being the most modern song on our list, it is still respectful of the genre it represents. It is to Adele’s credit that it isn’t trendy or out of place as it feels of a piece with Monty Norman’s “James Bond Theme” from the first Bond film Dr. No – 1961. This is from the 2012 movie of that name and received the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Brit Adele Adkins remains one of the most popular singers in the world.\n\n3.The Big Country Main Theme – Jerome Moross\n\nHoly cow – when those epic strings fire out the intro to this song you have to get goosebumps. Composer Jerome Moross was nominated for an Academy Award for his score to this 1958 adult-themed Western. Burl Ives won the Oscar for best supporting actor while appearing with Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston. Moross said that he was inspired to write the main theme for the movie by recalling an earlier trek he took on land near Albuquerque, New Mexico. He passed in 1983, a week before his 70th birthday. Prog-rock fans of the band Yes will recognize this as being part of a song from their second record Time & A Word (1970) as mixed with the Richie Havens song “No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed”.\n\n4.Help! – The Beatles\n\nWell if you have read my other posts you had to figure The Beatles would appear eventually. This was from the second Beatles movie (1965) which was more slapstick than ’64’s A Hard Day’s Night (and frankly my favorite of all their films contrary to most reviewers). Mostly written by John Lennon (with some help from Paul McCartney), he claimed years later that he was crying for actual help at that time as he felt depressed. John said it was one of his most honest lyrics. By the way, this concert version shows how good they sounded live and endears John to me even more as once again he managed to forget his own lyrics which he often did.\n\n5.The Theme from “A Summer Place” – Percy Faith & His Orchestra\n\nThis was a sweeping #1 U.S. hit early in 1960 for the conductor from Toronto, Canada. Faith’s instrumental is a classic example of a record that took a while to find its audience. Columbia released the single in September of 1959. It took till January 1960 for it to hit the charts then it began a nine week run at the top near the end of February. The most successful vocal version was by The Lettermen who in 1965 hit #16 in the U.S. with their version. Lyrics were by Mack Discant and music was by Max Steiner who is often referred to as the father of film-music scoring. He won three Academy Awards plus scored such movies as Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and King Kong.\n\n6.Ghostbusters – Ray Parker, Jr.\n\nThis has to be one of the most recognized theme-songs of all-time. Heck, everybody knows the answer to who “you gonna call?” “Ghostbusters” of course (“I can’t hear you”). Parker had been the guiding force behind the hit group Raydio (“Jack and Jill”) till going solo in 1981. This song hit #1 in 1984 and generated controversy when Huey Lewis decided it sounded too much like his 1974 song “I Want A New Drug”. Lewis received compensation one assumes because Parker and/or his lawyers decided to end it, but to me the tune is different with only the riffs being akin. For years courts have ruled that riffs aren’t necessarily subject to copyright, so who you gonna blame? It is still a very catchy song from a fun movie no matter who wrote it.\n\n7.The Magnificent Seven – Al Caiola & His Orchestra\n\nGuitarist Caiola only had two chart hits: “Bonanza” from the TV show (#19 U.S. 1961) and this stirring theme at the tail end of 1960 (#35). He was mainly a studio guy and to have a rock hit was a relatively old 40 when he recorded this instrumental. He passed at age 96 in 2016 having recorded with artists as diverse as Elvis and Tony Bennett. Elmer Bernstein wrote the film score and, no, he wasn’t related to Leonard Bernstein the conductor. He scored a diverse group of movies including The Ten Commandments, True Grit and Animal House. The movie depicts seven men protecting a Mexican town and starred Yul Brenner and Steve McQueen among others. It was a Western remake of Akira Kurosawa’s classic 1954 Japanese film Seven Samurai. He is pictured far left in our intro.\n\n8.Jailhouse Rock – Elvis Presley\n\nElvis movies were generally just excuses to get the kids to the theater, sell more popcorn and soda, throw in some songs and then get those kids to buy the records. A few of his movies were actually pretty good, however with this 1957 film being one of the better ones. Keeping in mind that movie reviewers in the ’50s were never going to be in sync with teenagers or in love with rock and roll music, the reviews were pretty much negative. Presley played an ex-convict which didn’t sit well with those folk to begin with as they saw him as a bad influence on their kids. The movie was a huge success at the box-office. This song was written by legendary tunesmiths Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (“Kansas City”, “Youngblood”) who also added the songs “(You’re So Square) Baby I Don’t Care” (which Elvis is said to have played the bass on) and “Treat Me Nice” for the movie. Together or apart, Leiber and Stoller were responsible for at least 70 U.S. chart hits.\n\n9.Having A Wild Weekend – The Dave Clark Five\n\nWith the huge success of the first Beatles movie A Hard Day’s Night (1964), it was inevitable that other British Invasion groups would be cast in films as well to draw in the teen market. For a time The Dave Clark Five were seen as rivals of The Beatles and indeed they did chart 24 singles here from 1964 till 1968, but they were just a great rock and roll band and not trendsetters like the Fabs. One of the biggest problems with casting musical acts in movies is not every member was necessarily a great actor or even very interesting. That was the biggest strength of The Beatles – they were all four compelling and different individuals. The other problem with most teen movies was trying to find a plot. This movie didn’t get much of an audience as it wasn’t really a teen diversion, but more serious in tone. It marked the screen debut of British director John Boorman who went on to such successes as Deliverance and Excalibur. The soundtrack album on Epic was one of the first records in my collection as mom and dad let me get it from their Columbia Record Club order back in 1965 (thanks folks!). In the U.K. the title of the movie was Catch Us If You Can which was the hit single from the album (#4 U.S.).\n\n10.Let It Be – The Beatles\n\nI decided to restrict it to only two songs by one artist so Let It Be wins out over Magical Mystery Tour, A Hard Day’s Night and Yellow Submarine – but just barely. If “Help!” was mostly a John song, “Let It Be” was mostly Paul. The movie back in 1970 showed a band breaking up though they managed to pull together long enough to record the classic Abbey Road album. While this was recorded earlier than Abbey Road, it became their last album of new material in 1970 spawning this #1 single (plus “The Long & Winding Road” which also hit #1). The single version with production credited to George Martin downplayed the orchestra and used a mellow guitar lead break from George Harrison. The album version (included here) was produced by Phil Spector and for me was far superior punching things up and using a hot lead part from George. To me this is the birth of the power ballad. My late pal Chuck Davis and I used to crank this sucker up in his dorm room on Friday after class at the University Of Colorado while blasting out Chuck’s electric guitar likely to the annoyance of fellow students.\n\n11.The Monkey’s Uncle – Annette Funicello + The Beach Boys\n\nHere is yet another 1965 teen movie and it was a big success though the single didn’t chart. By 1965 Annette was several years removed from charting records which is a pity as this 45 is great. The song was written by Richard and Robert Sherman who had composed nifty tunes for movies such as Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book. The film starred Annette and Tommy Kirk. It was pretty silly beginning with Kirk’s character adopting a chimpanzee named Stanley.\n\n12.Exodus – Ferrante & Teicher\n\nThis stirring song is from the 1960 Paul Newman star vehicle about the founding of the State of Israel. Otto Preminger directed and the film reportedly earned over five times its production budget. Ernest Gold won the Academy Award for Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture while Art Ferrante and Lou Teicher nabbed the hit piano duet version getting to # 2 in the U.S. in 1961. Gold scored a great many films including Judgment at Nuremberg and On The Beach. Ferrante and Teicher made a career out of songs from movies it seemed, including “Tonight” and “Midnight Cowboy”. Teicher passed in 2008 (three weeks before his 84th birthday) and Ferrante succumbed in 2009 (two weeks after his 88th birthday).\n\n13.Xanadu – Olivia Newton-John + The Electric Light Orchestra\n\nJeff Lynne of The Electric Light Orchestra wrote this nifty pop confection for the horrid roller-disco film Xanadu in 1980. It got to #8 in the U.S. for the pairing of ELO backing Olivia Newton-John on lead vocal. One can only speculate how the great dancer Gene Kelly felt acting in this his last screen movie about a silly craze that didn’t have wheels – roller-disco. The much beloved ONJ sadly passed in the summer of 2022 of cancer at the age of 73.\n\n14.The Good, The Bad & The Ugly – Hugo Montenegro His Orchestra & Chorus\n\nClint Eastwood came to success on the big screen with the trio of so-called Spaghetti-Westerns directed by Sergio Leone. This Christmas 1966 film was the third of those Italian Western shows (it was released a year later in the U.S.). Music was by Ennio Morricone though the hit was by Hugo Montenegro who charted at #2 in 1968. Hugo was from New York City and started as a recording artist before he moved to scoring music for films including Lady In Cement and The Wrecking Crew. He passed in February of 1981 at the age of 55. As I commented in my June 2020 Arcane Instruments Of Rock blog post, the main riff was played on an ocarina. Feel free to click on that link (and all the others) at your leisure.\n\n15.That Thing You Do! – The Wonders\n\nIf your Dentist could talk to Tom Hanks it wouldn’t be about his wonderful film career, but rather about our apparent shared love of the music of the ’60s (gimme a shout Tom). This 1996 movie was his lovingly accurate representation of a one-hit-wonder band (hence The Wonders) from what for us Boomers was the golden age of music. The song was composed by Adam Schlesinger the bassist from The Fountains Of Wayne who passed from COVID-19 at the age of 52 in 2020. Lead vocals where by Mike Viola who has worked on other movies such as Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. As a fun homage to The Beatles, the song ends the same way that “I Saw Her Standing There” ends.\n\n16.What’s New Pussycat – Tom Jones\n\nWoody Allen’s debut on the big screen was this screwball comedy in 1965. He had previously been a comedic gag writer and stand-up comic. The song itself was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David (“Walk On By”, “Magic Moments”) and was a #3 hit for Welsh singer Tom Jones – his second U.S. success. Thomas Jones Woodward was born June 7, 1940 and first hit here with “It’s Not Unusual” before settling in to a long run in Las Vegas. It starred the two Peters (Sellers and O’Toole) and reviews were mixed with the title song getting the most acclaim. Allen wasn’t happy with how it turned out and from then on directed his own films.\n\n17.April Love – Pat Boone\n\nThe movie was a hit with the teen dating audience and depicted Boone as a parolee who had been convicted of joyriding in a stolen car. It had the usual boy meets girl on the farm plot twists. Pat successfully dished up sanitized Caucasian versions of Black rock and roll songs and was so clean it is a bit hard to see him as the law-breaker he played in the film (but that’s acting, right?). Reportedly Boone didn’t kiss the actress playing his love interest (Shirley Jones) so as not to cause discord with his wife also named Shirley. Sammy Fain composed the music while the lyrics were by Paul Francis Webster and it became a #1 U.S. hit for Boone in 1957.\n\n18.The Pink Panther Theme – Henry Mancini & His Orchestra\n\nThe first Pink Panther movie was released in 1963 and introduced bumbling French Inspector Jacques Clouseau played by Peter Sellers. Sellers’ character was only secondary in the first movie then became the focus of the next ten films. The animated title panther became popular enough that it spun off a kiddie cartoon as well. The theme was written by one of the most prolific and best-known composers of movie songs Henry Mancini (real name Enrico Mancini). His RCA Victor single peaked at #34 in 1964 with the sax played by Plas Johnson. Mancini is probably best known for songs like “Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet”, “Moon River” and “Love Story”. He started playing the piccolo at a young age then studied piano. Growing up near Pittsburgh, he first attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology then transferred to the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. In 1943 at the age of eighteen he enlisted in the Army and in ’45 was sent to France. When he was discharged he first joined the new version of The Glenn Miller Orchestra (Miller had died during WW II) then went to work in the movie industry. From then on he was involved with scoring countless movies and TV shows till his passing in 1994 at age 70.\n\n19.Town Without Pity – Gene Pitney\n\nYour Dentist loves the music of Gene Pitney, but he would like an explanation from the R&R Hall Of Fame how Gene got inducted (2002) while acts seemingly more deserving such as Neil Sedaka and Jethro Tull still wait for the call. At any rate, this was a #13 U.S. hit in 1961 from the shockingly tragic drama it accompanied. It is about a German teen who is gang-raped by U.S. servicemen and goes through a horrific trial only to drown herself at the movie’s end – yikes. Kirk Douglas and E. G. Marshall starred as the competing attorneys. The song was written by Dimitri Tiomkin with lyrics by Ned Washington – two composing heavyweights. Tiompkin lived from 1894 till 1979 and as he was Jewish, moved to Berlin then the U.S. following the Russian Revolution. He scored many films including High Noon and The Alamo. Washington passed in 1976 at the age of 76. One of the duo’s best remembered songs is the theme from the TV show Rawhide. Ned worked with others as well including Leigh Harline who wrote the song “When You Wish Upon a Star” for which they won and Oscar .\n\n20.Mrs. Brown You’ve Got A Lovely Daughter – Herman’s Hermits\n\nDisclaimer – your Dentist admits this to be a bit of a cheat as the hit song that lent its title to the movie came out three years before the film. Stop complaining – this in my blog after all and while the first Hermits movie Hold On! is better remembered, that song was not as good as “Mrs. Brown…”. The tune was a cover of a ’63 popular U.K ditty by Trevor Peacock and sung by Tom Courtenay in The Lads – a British TV play. Peter Noone’s band recorded the track as filler for an album only to see it become one of their biggest hits at #1 in ’65 when released in the U.S.. The other hit from the January 1968 movie was “There’s A Kind Of Hush”, their last top 10 U.S. single (1967). The plot of the movie is pretty dicey involving Peter/Herman getting a greyhound dog named Mrs. Brown plus falling for a girl named Judy Brown. No Academy Awards were awarded for the film (but the music was good). Herman’s Hermits were a charming pop band that in the wake of The Beatles 1964 invasion became far bigger stars in the U.S. than in their native England. The seemingly ageless Noone continues to put on a fun show at the time of this writing.\n\n21.Ferry Cross The Mersey – Gerry & The Pacemakers\n\nHailing from Liverpool with the same manager as The Beatles (Brian Epstein) and producer (George Martin), for a short time the music of Gerry Marsden’s band was hugely popular. In the wake of the success of the first Beatles movie A Hard Day’s Night, Gerry and company were given their own movie which was titled after the River Mersey that empties into Liverpool Bay. It came out in Dec. of 1964 in the U.K. and Feb. 1965 in the U.S. though The Pacemakers were certainly not the equal of The Beatles personality-wise. The title track proved to be the last big hit for the band in the U.S. at #6. Marden wrote the song which was great as was the other hit he wrote for the movie – “It’s Gonna Be Alright” (only a #23 hit here, but your blogger’s fave track by Gerry). Marsden ferried off our planet in 2021 at the age of 78. By the way, what passed as a plot had the band playing themselves pre-hits trying to win a music competition while losing (and ultimately finding) their musical instruments. It was not Citizen Kane.\n\n22.Ballad Of Easy Rider – The Byrds\n\nIn the summer of 1969 just before my senior year at Broomfield High, this seemed like a most excellently cool film to this teen with great period music and spiffy looking motorcycles. Well folks, in 2023 it seems stupid and mostly self-indulgent (feel free to quibble, but that’s my opinion in my 70s) but it did make a boatload of money on a ridiculously small budget. It feels like mostly an excuse for Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson to take drugs (allegedly), ride motorcycles and canoodle with hippy chicks (one of which was played by Toni Basil who in 1982 had a big hit with “Mickey”). The shocking ending where they have the run-in with the rednecks not-withstanding, it’s ha"
