        "text": "BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD TO REUNITE Buffalo Springfield, one of the most influential country-rock bands in music history, will reunite Oct. 23-24 when they headline both star-studded nights of Neil Young’s 24 th annual Bridge School benefit at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, near San Francisco, according to the Oakland Tribune. The three living Springfield members, Young, Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, will play acoustic sets, which fits the established format for these benefits. The two other original members, bass player Bruce Palmer, died in 2004, and drummer Dewey Martin, passed away last year. Jim Messina, who replaced Palmer for The Springfield’s final album and tours several years before teaming with Kenny Loggins, is unconfirmed for the upcoming concerts. The Springfield last played live in public 42 years ago (they played privately in 1986). The group was together only three years, 1966-68, but they released an LP each year. Stills’ solemn 1967 ballad, “For What It’s Worth,” which concerns the teenage riots on the Sunset Strip in 1966, came to symbolize the turbulence and “Generation Gap” confrontations of the times, especially the Vietnam War. The song was ranked #63 in Rolling Stones’ 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Also of interest at the Bridge School concerts is an all-star contingent, T-Bone Burnette’s Speaking Clock Revue that includes Elton John, Leon Russell, 83-year old bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley, Elvis Costello, Neko Case and Oscar-winning actor-singer Jeff Bridges. Pearl Jam, Modest Mouse, Lucinda Williams, Billy Idol, the surviving Highwaymen duo of Merle Haggard and Kris Kristofferson, and Jackson Browne with David Lindley will also appear.\n\nKENNEDY CENTER HONORS FOR McCARTNEY & HAGGARD The list of the 33 rd Kennedy Center Honors on Dec. 5 in Washington, DC includes Paul McCartney (who just finished producing an EP mini-album for his son James), 68, and country music legend Merle Haggard, 73. Other honorees include Oprah Winfrey, music theatre dancer-choreographer-director Bill T. Jones, and Broadway composer and lyricist Jerry Herman (“Hello Dolly,” “Mame,” “La Cage aux Folles”). The gala will be televised on CBS at a later date. President and Mrs. Obama will host the honorees at the White House prior to attending the event, which features well-known guest performing artists honoring the recipients in performance onstage.\n\nKINKS RAY DAVIES COLLABORATES Ray Davies, 66, has been re-recording a bunch of his Kinks songs for an upcoming album with a number of guests, according to New Musical Express (NME). Bruce Springsteen joined Davies on a new version of the 1981 hit, “Better Things,” while Jon Bon Jovi sings with him on The Kinks’ 1972 classic, “Celluloid Heroes.” Others who have recorded with Davies for this project include Lucinda Williams, The Pixies’ Frank Black, Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan, Spoon, and the late Alex Chilton of The Box Tops and Big Star. The as-yet-untitled CD is expected to be released before the end of they year.\n\nRONSTADT REMEMBERS KENNY EDWARDS Linda Ronstadt remembered fellow Stone Poneys member Kenny Edwards, who died on Aug. 19 at age 64. “He had excellent creative ideas, and didn’t always get the credit the others did,” she told the L.A.\n\nTimes. The Stone Poneys hit the charts for their one and only time in 1967 with “Different Drum,” a song written by Mike Nesmith of The Monkees. They disbanded shortly thereafter. Guitarist-singer Edwards then teamed with singer-songwriters Wendy Waldman, Bonoff and Andrew Gold in group, Bryndle. He then teamed again with Ronstadt in 1974 on her multi-platinum album, “Heart Like a Wheel.” Ronstadt added, “He was always a beacon to me, and his opinion always counted a lot for me. The great thing about watching what he’s been doing in recent years is how much he enjoyed it. He dreamed good dreams and he lived them out.”\n\nMUSIC STARS FIGHT ILLNESSES Pop and rock stars lent their support at two recently televised benefits whose purposes were to fight catastrophic diseases, the Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon and Stand Up For Cancer. Lewis brought out the likes of Barry Manilow, Michael Feinstein, Maureen McGovern (1972′ “The Morning After”), Enrique Iglesias, “American Idol” contestant David Archuleta, Lynyrd Skynyrd, WAR, Beatles tribute band The Fab Four and Charro, while raising almost $59 million. Stand Up For Cancer featured Neil Diamond with Herbie Hancock, Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, Kris Kristofferson, Martina McBride, U2 guitarist The Edge, former Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart, Heart’s Ann and Nancy Wilson, Aaron Neville and Stevie Wonder. That special, which aired on all three major networks, raised in the vicinity of $100 million.\n\nDEBBIE DOES AUCTIONS\n\nSinging and dancing actress Debbie Reynolds found everlasting fame with Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor in the 1951 classic, “Singin’ in the Rain.” As a pop singer, she took the theme song from her film, “Tammy,” to #1 and a gold record in 1957. Reynolds, 78, owns one of Hollywood’s greatest collections of memorabilia, which she’s amassed over her lifetime and that has an estimated value of $50 million. Her son Todd Fisher, told AP that the collection will be auctioned off before next June. Included in the sale are the ruby red slippers and lightly colored checkered dress worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in 1939’s “Wizard of Oz”; the fur coat worn in “Citizen Kane” by Orson Welles as super-wealthy Charles Foster Kane in 1941; and the dress Marilyn Monroe wore in the iconic blast of underground air from the subway scene in the 1955 comedy , “The Seven Year Itch.” Thousands of other costumes and items will also be sold. Reynolds begins an 11-night run at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood on September 23. She’s also booked for a concert at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano next January 11.\n\nDALE BOZZIO NO MISSING PERSON Missing Persons blond bombshell singer Dale Bozzio was among the most popular singers of the ’80 s. Her high-pitched chirpy staccato singing is said to have heavily influenced Gwen Stefani of Orange County’s No Doubt; and her inventive, risqu? clothes and overall style have drawn comparisons to Lady Gaga. Electric Blue Records, a subsidiary of Blue Pie Records announced that it has signed Bozzio to a recording contract. Additional details have not yet been announced.\n\nKING COLEMAN DIES\n\nCarlton “King” Coleman, an R & B pioneer best known for his lead vocal on the 1960 dance hit, “(Do The) Mashed Potatoes” died of heart failure in Miami at ager 78, according to his son, reports AP. The record was actually recorded by James Brown’s band, The Famous Flames, but a legal spat arose that prevented Brown from singing on the record, so Coleman handled it. Brown played piano on the track while shouting the song’s title in the background. Again, because of contractual problems, the record was released under the group name Nat Kendrick and The Swans, after Brown’s drummer. The single hit #8 on Billboard’s R & B chart in 1960. Coleman later worked with B.B King and Jackie Wilson and became a popular DJ in Miami.\n\nANOTHER DOOBIE FOR WILLIE On Sept. 28, The Doobie Brothers will release “World Gone Crazy,” its first CD of new music in more than a decade. For the song, “I Know We Won,” original members Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons got some songwriting and vocal help from Willie Nelson, according to the Boot. “I’d been talking to Willie for ages (about collaborating),” says Simmons, who adds that Nelson “perfectly captured the sentiment” of the song. The new record also features former Doobie Brother’s singer Michael McDonald on “Don’t Say Goodbye.” In other McDonald news, the 58-year-old soul belter will release a new holiday DVD next week, “Michael McDonald – This Christmas Live In Chicago,” that features a dozen holiday classics and not-so familiar Christmas songs, two of his hits as a solo artist, three Doobies hits and a cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.”\n\nHAL KETCHUM ON THE DL\n\nIllness has forced country singer Hal Ketchum, 57, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, to cancel his upcoming tours of the U.S. and the U.K., according to a statement on his website. No further details were given. Ketchum’s 1991 album, “Past the Point of Rescue,” went Top 10 on the country chart and was certified gold. He has a dozen Top 40 country singles beginning with 1991’s “Small Town Saturday Night,” that hit #2.\n\nDREAM THEATER FOUNDER QUITS Drummer Mike Portnoy has amicably left Dream Theater, the progressive metal band he formed in Massachusetts in 1985, to pursue other interests, according to Pollstar. The group has proven far more popular over the years in Europe and Japan than in the U.S. Its most recent CD, last year’s “Black Clouds & Silver Linings,” was the group’s tenth studio record and was far and away its most popular domestic work, peaking at #6 on the Billboard album chart. It is the group’s only stateside Top 10 album.\n\nBIG COUNTRY IS BACK\n\nScottish group Big Country, who hit it big in the 80 s, has reunited. In 1983, the band took the Highland fling-infused single, “In a Big Country,” to #3 in the U.S. The song went platinum in both Canada and the U.K. The band is returning for the first time since group leader Stuart Adamson committed suicide in Hawaii in 2001. Replacing Adamson is Mike Peters, lead singer for the Welch band, The Alarm, which had the late-’80 s KROQ smashes, “68 Guns,” and “Sold Me Down the River.” Big Country is taking its reunion slow at first, beginning its comeback with only four shows in England next January.\n\nWYNTON MARSALIS TO CUBA State Department authorities have approved a brief tour of Cuba by NYC’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and its bandleader, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The orchestra will perform several concerts there between Oct. 5-9.\n\nFunding of the tour was provided by the Mellon, Ford and Rockefeller non-profit foundations.\n\nGEORGE MICHAEL GETS 8 WEEKS A judge at England’s Highbury Corner Magistrates Court sentenced pop singer George Michael to eight weeks in jail after Michael pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and possession of marijuana, according to London’s Daily Mail. This is the latest of several incidents involving Michael driving under the influence. Michael was also fined $1,930 and his driver’s license was suspended for five years.\n\nVINCE NEIL’S NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nMotley Crue singer Vince Neil’s autobiography, “Tattoos & Tequila,” will be released on Sept. 23. Among the numerous juicy bits in the book, Neil waxes unsparingly of his dislike of Ozzy Osbourne’s manager-wife, Sharon, writing, “This is the most evil woman I’ve ever met in my life. She would have you (expletive) killed if it was to her advantage,” according to the New York Post. In other news, Neil was accused of assaulting a woman in an elevator at the Las Vegas Hilton on Sept. 5. However, TMZ says that no charges were filed after Hilton surveillance cameras showed no evidence of an assault. Neil is still scheduled to be arraigned in a Las Vegas court on Sept. 27 th on DUI and speeding charges stemming from a June 27 incident. Neil lives in Vegas and owns several businesses there, including tattoo parlors, a cantina in the Hilton and a private jet charter service.\n\nCOUNTRY HALL OF FAME BENEFIT Keith Urban’s 2 nd “All For The Hall” Country Hall of Fame benefit concert, set for Oct. 5 features a lineup of performers that includes Hall members Dolly Parton, Charley Pride and Vince Gill as well as Alan Jackson, Alison Kraus (fresh off her two-year Grammy-winning collaboration with former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant), Martina McBride and John Mayer. In other Country Hall of Fame news, Booker T & The MG’s guitarist Steve Cropper (whose latest CD is a collaborations with The Rascals’ singer-organist Felix Cavaliere), 19 th-century composer Stephen Foster, songwriter Pat Alger and the late singer Paul Davis (“I Go Crazy”) will be inducted on Oct. 17, according to its website.\n\nSPRINGSTEEN REVISITS THE EDGE OF TOWN Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band’s 1978 album, “Darkness on the Edge of Town” is considered an American rock music classic and is listed at #151 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nThe record contains the fan favorites “Badlands,” “The Promised Land,” and “Prove It All Night.” A new documentary, “The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town,” was premiered this week at the Toronto Film Festival. Next stop is HOB, where the doc will begin airing Oct. 7. Then on Nov. 16, Columbia Records releases a 3-CD, 3-DVD box set of the album containing 21 previously unreleased songs as well as the documentary.\n\nOLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN AT TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL\n\nAussie songstress Olivia Newton-John, still a beauty at 61, attended the premiere of her new independent film, “Score, A Hockey Musical,” at the Toronto Film Festival, according to the Daily Mail. The star of the smash 1978 musical, “Grease,” has continued to act in films and television steadily through the years. In “Score,” she and Canadian songwriter Marc Jordan are the parents of a teenage hockey player who achieves greatness on the ice. She and Jordon also co-wrote and performed a song at the movie’s end over the credits.\n\nMOOGFEST MoogFest is a three-day festival that pays homage to Robert Moog, inventor of the Moog Synthesizer, the keyboard instrument that revolutionized modern music. The event is held Oct. 29-31 in Asheville, NC, and among the two dozen performers will be Devo (who will receive the festival’s Moog Innovation Award) and Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks. Moog’s first musical invention was the theremin that makes a high-pitched warbly, whistly sound. He invented this instrument in 1949 when he was only 14 years old. The Beach Boys used a theremin on the 1966 classic, “Good Vibrations” and Jimmy Page used it during the extended musical break on Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love.” The musical inventor developed his first Moog Synthesizer in 1964. Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake and Palmer was the first musician to use a Moog live in concert in the late ’60 s when he was a member of his pre-ELP group, The Nice. Moog died of brain cancer in Asheville in 2005 at age 71.\n\nAMY & QUINCY RECORD TOGETHER Troubled five-time Grammy winner Amy Winehouse will add her distinctive jazzy R & B vocals to a track on 77-year-old composer-conductor-producer Quincy Jones’ upcoming CD, “Q: Soul Bossa Nostra,” a cover album of Jones’ past hits, reports AP. The 27-year old British singer hasn’t released any new music since her second CD, “Back to Black,” made her an international star in 2006. In England, producer Mark Ronson, who guided “Back to Black,” recorded Winehouse’s take on “It’s My Party,” a Jones-produced smash for a discovery of his, Leslie Gore, in 1963. Of Winehouse, who said her next album will be out in January, Jones said in a statement, “I am astounded not only by her voice but by her tremendous knowledge of and respect for music and its history. I absolutely love what they (Winehouse and Ronson) did to make the song their own.” Other participants on Jones’ new CD include Jamie Foxx, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson and Usher.\n\nJERMAINE JACKSON IN VEGAS Jermaine Jackson says his upcoming Oct. 2 concert at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, “40 Years of Jackson Family Music,” will be loaded with Jackson 5 hits. Backed by an 11-piece group, three backup singers and six dancers, the 55-year-old who hit the Top 10 in 1973 with “Daddy’s Home” and again six years later with “Let’s Get Serious,” will also feature a tribute to his brother Michael that will include his own versions of “Man in the Mirror,” “Beat It,” and other hits.\n\nPERRY AIRS ON AEROSMITH Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry voiced his disdain to the Calgary Herald for “American Idol,” whose newest judge may be his group’s singer, Steven Tyler. “It’s a reality show designed to – sell advertising. It’s one step above (the Teenage) Mutant Ninja Turtles,” he says. The 59-year old axe-man says he’s not going to waste time doing nothing while Tyler does his thing on TV. The rest of the band isn’t “going to sit around for two years waiting for him to come back. You’ve got four guys that are great together, and if you find the right singer, there is no reason you can’t go out and entertain people.”\n\nKANSAS IN KANSAS Classic rockers Kansas, which formed in Topeka, KS, in 1970, are celebrating 40 years together by playing a series of benefit concerts at colleges and universities this month, “The Kansas Collegiate Symphony Tour,” according to a release on its website. For the shows, the band that still counts original singer Steve Walsh, drummer Phil Ehart, and guitarist Rich Williams among its members, the album-oriented rockers will be joined by each school’s orchestras. The concerts will raise money for each school’s music programs. The tour includes stops at colleges in Alabama, Texas, Missouri and of course, Kansas.\n\nNO STONES WHILE THEY’RE HAVING FUN The Rolling Stones 69-year-old drummer Charlie Watts tells Le Parisien that there won’t be any Stones activity, either in the studio or on the road, until “Mick (Jagger) and Keith (Richards) get bored-(and) at the moment they’re having a good time.” Watts, who joined the band in January 1963 after nearly a year of constant coercion from Jagger, Richards, guitarist Brian Jones, piano player Ian Stewart and bassist Dick Taylor, who would soon leave to become guitarist for The Pretty Things. Watts, who also leads a jazz band, and who has been married to wife Shirley for 45 years, says of a Stones farewell tour, “We’re discussing it at the moment. If we do something, it will be next year or the year after. We’ve reached an age where you can’t look too far into the future.” In other Stones news, a digitally remastered version of “Ladies and Gentlemen- The Rolling Stones,” the 1973 rockumentary of its 1972 American “Exile on Main St.” tour premiered in London last week with 73-year-old former bassist Bill Wyman, who retired from the band in 1992, in attendance. For the new version of the film, the 67-year-old Jagger taped a brief interview in London several weeks ago. The movie will be released on Blue-ray and DVD next month."
