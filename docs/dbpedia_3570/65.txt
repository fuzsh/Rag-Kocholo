Air Force & Navy Roundel Insignia

In one of your pictures of the week, you said the aircraft in the photo was in markings of the Portuguese Air Force. How can you tell? Is there any way of knowing what country a military plane belongs to?

- question from TJ Simmons

I believe the photo you are referring to was of an A-7 Corsair II operated by Portugal. The photo appeared as a Picture of the Week during April 2006 and is also shown below.

The country operating a military aircraft can most often be identified by the national insignia painted on its wings or fuselage. This insignia or logo is usually referred to as a roundel since most countries use a circular shape for their symbol. In the A-7 photo shown above, one of these roundels can be seen on the aft fuselage just forward of the horizontal tail. Although the roundel is somewhat difficult to make out in this photo, a second clue to the plane's nation of origin can be seen near the center of the vertical tail. It is common for an additional colorful symbol referred to as a fin flash to be placed in this location. Most countries that employ a fin flash use a miniature version of the nation's flag. The flag of Portugal can be seen on the A-7's vertical tail helping to identify the military for which it serves.

Roundels first appeared during World War I when the new breed of combat pilots flying over European battlefields needed a means of differentiating friendly and enemy aircraft. The French were first to adopt a roundel using a series of blue, white, and red concentric circles reminiscent of the French flag. The British quickly followed suit with a similar design of blue, white, and red circles. This design has since been simplified to two colors with the elimination of the white circle. The Royal Air Force design was also modified for other countries within the British Empire by simply replacing the red circular center of the British roundel with a red shape symbolizing that nation. Examples include Australia with a red kangaroo, Canada with a red maple leaf, and New Zealand with a red kiwi bird.

Since so many modern countries were colonies of France and the United Kingdom during the early years of aviation, it is not surprising that most of these nations also adopted roundel designs for their air forces upon gaining independence. These designs range from the ultimate simplicity of Libya's solid green circle to the five concentric circles of Thailand and Kenya or the complex designs of the Dominican Republic and Mauritania. Some countries also have multiple versions of their roundel for different purposes. Both the United Kingdom and the United States, for example, have traditionally used very bright and colorful insignia with red, white, and blue but currently employ roundels with faded, pale colors or stenciled outlines to reduce visibility on combat aircraft.

To assist in identifying the origins of military aircraft, we have assembled the following list of roundel insignia currently in use. Bear in mind that some countries change their insignia fairly often as political powers shift, so some of those shown below may no longer be accurate.
