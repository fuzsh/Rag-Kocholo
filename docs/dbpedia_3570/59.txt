Handmade steel air force roundel of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) made by Gennaro Mancini. This interpretation of the air force roundel is made up of regular and stainless steel. Each colour of the roundel is an individual laser-cut part (either steel or stainless steel). Each individual part has been given a special treatment to simulate the actual colours. It is a statement piece for every office, room or study.

Unique colours

This artwork is handmade and the colouring and processing of the several areas is the result of the personal choices of the artist. This means that no other BLCKBRD roundel will be the same as this one!
