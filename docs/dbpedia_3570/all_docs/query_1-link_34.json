        "text": "A Brazilian Air Force KC-390 Millennium flying at the Royal International Air Tattoo (pictured) ahead of the Farnborough International Airshow. Austria and the Netherlands have signed for the type in a joint procurement contract. (Janes/Gareth Jennings)\n\nAustria and the Netherlands signed for the joint procurement of nine Embraer C-390 Millennium transport aircraft at a ceremony hosted by the Brazilian manufacturer on 22 July.\n\nThe event at the Farnborough International Airshow 2024 finalised the deal that will see Austria acquire four of the airlifters, and the Netherlands five.\n\n“With this [contract], it is clear that the C-390 will conquer much more of the [international market] space,” Embraer CEO João Bosco da Costa Junior said at the signing event.\n\nWhen deliveries commence from 2027, the Austrian Air Force will replace three former UK Lockheed Martin C-130K Hercules aircraft, with the Royal Netherlands Air Force replacing its four ageing C-130Hs.\n\nDesignated C-390 in its transport guise and as KC-390 in its tanker-transport guise, the Millennium can carry more payload than the C-130 at a higher speed and over a farther distance. The airlifter has a hold volume of 170 m³ (including the ramp) and a maximum payload of 23 tonnes (or a concentrated maximum payload of 26 tonnes over the centre of gravity).\n\nCompany-released performance specifications give the aircraft a maximum cruise speed of 470 kt (870 km/h); a maximum altitude of 36,000 ft; and a range (with 23 tonnes of payload) of 1,380 n miles (2,556 km), or a ferry flight with internal fuel tanks of 4,640 n miles. The range can be extended by in-flight refuelling.\n\nFor more information on the KC/C-390, please see Paris Air Show 2023: Embraer showcases KC-390 in bid to build on European success ."
