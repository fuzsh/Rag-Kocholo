        "text": "This page describes and illustrates the various national insignia used by the Royal Brunei Air Force since its formation:\n\n[To be added]\n\nMain Marking Fin Flash\n\n1965-1975\n\nWhen the Air Service of the Royal Brunei Malay Regiment was established in 1965, its aircraft and helicopters were marked with the coat of arms of the regiment, together with the national flag as a fin flash. The roundel was displayed in the standard six positions on aircraft – above and below each wing and on the fuselage sides, but just on the fuselage sides on helicopters. The H.S.748 carried the service titles ASKAR MELAYU DIRAJA BRUNEI on the fuselage sides.\n\nMain Marking Fin Flash\n\n1975-1991\n\nIn about 1975 a new red/green/white/yellow roundel was introduced to replace the regimental coat of arms. The roundel was displayed in the standard six positions on aircraft – above and below each wing and on the fuselage sides, but just on the fuselage sides on helicopters. A fin flash of red/green/white/yellow vertical stripes was also introduced, but this soon replaced by the national flag. Large aircraft carried the service titles ASKAR MELAYU DIRAJA BRUNEI (or later ANGKATAN BERSENJATA DIRAJA BRUNEI) on the fuselage sides.\n\nMain Marking Fin Flash\n\n1991-present\n\nCurrent Brunei aircraft carry the RBAF Official Insignia, (outlined on a white disc if against a dark colour), on the fuselage sides. The use of the roundel appears to have been discontinued. The fin carries the national flag or a blue/white/yellow fin flash – or quite often both. The service titles TENTERA UDATA DIRAJA BRUNEI are carried on most aircraft and helicopters.\n\nHistory\n\nNarrative Summary\n\nThe present Royal Brunei Air Force was first established in May 1965 with the creation of an Air Service for the Royal Brunei Malay Regiment. Initially equipped with three Whirlwind helicopters flown by foreign pilots under contract, the unit transported army doctors to remote areas. In 1966 the Whirlwinds were replaced by three Wessex 54 helicopters manned by British RAF crews and the unit became known as the Helicopter Platoon. In the following year five Bell 206 JetRanger helicopters were received. In 1971 the first fixed-wing aircraft was delivered, a H.S.748 transport. In late 1972, the Royal Brunei Malay Regiment was reorganised, and the Helicopter Platoon became the Air Wing.\n\nThe First Squadron was formed around the Bell 206 unit and a Piper Cherokee light aircraft was obtained in 1976. In 1980 the Air Technical Training School was established. A Second Squadron was formed in 1981 with the MBB Bo 105 and a Third Squadron in 1982 with SF-260 light attack aircraft. After formal independence from Britain on 1 January 1984 the country became responsible for its own defence. The personnel strength of the Air Wing was expanded considerably and on 1 October 1991 it was renamed the Royal Brunei Air Force.\n\nIn 1997 an influx of new equipment allowed two more squadrons, numbers Four and Five, to be established and the re-equipment of the Third Squadron. In November 2011 the biggest aircraft order to date, for twelve S-70i Black Hawk helicopters, was announced. Delivery from 2013 is enabling a significant growth in the capability of the RBAF.\n\nMay 1965 Air Service of the Royal Brunei Malay Regiment established. March 1984 Air Wing of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. 1 October 1991 Royal Brunei Air Force.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nAll RBAF aircraft and helicopters currently are currently active.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nAcquire one C-130J for transport duties.\n\nMarkings\n\nNational Insignia\n\nCurrent — Historical\n\nAircraft Serial Numbers\n\nAll RBAF aircraft are allocated a three-digit serial number. This is prefixed with a four or five service identifier, which has changed over time:\n\nAMDB (May 1965- March 1984)\n\nABDB (March 1984- September 1991)\n\nATU DB (October 1991- ? 2005)\n\nTUDB (? 2005+)\n\nAircraft\n\nAircraft Designations\n\nNone – Manufacturers designations used.\n\nCurrent Aircraft Inventory\n\nTable of Current Service Aircraft\n\nAll-Time Aircraft Used List\n\nAll-Time Table of Aircraft Used\n\nInstructional Airframes\n\nTo be added.\n\nAircraft NOT Used\n\nFalse reports of aircraft on order or in service\n\nOrganisation\n\nMain Headquarters\n\nHQ RBAF, Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Bolkiah Garrison, Government Building and Capitol Building, BB3510, Brunei Muara. Brunei Darussalam, Brunei.\n\nOrganisational Structure\n\nThe Air Force is divided into 5 Wings: Operation Wing (front-line aircraft), Air Regiment (air defence missiles and base ground defence), Logistics Wing (maintenance and technical support), Training Wing (training and standards evaluation), Administration Wing (back office duties). Only the Operation and Training Wings operate aircraft. There are five flying squadrons.\n\nCurrent Order of Battle\n\nTable of Current Order of Battle\n\nHistorical Orders of Battle\n\nHistorical Order of Battle for 2002\n\nAll-Time Flying Units List\n\nOperation Wing\n\nTraining Wing\n\n1 Squadron\n\n2 Squadron\n\n3 Squadron\n\n4 Squadron\n\n5 Squadron\n\nAir Bases\n\nCurrent Air Bases\n\nThe main air bases currently used is Rimba Air Base, situated within Brunei International Airport.\n\nAll-Time Air Bases Used List\n\nApart from the main base, there is only one other airfield in Brunei. The RBAF also operates helicopters from warships of the Royal Brunei Navy.\n\nMilitary Air Bases Listing\n\nAircraft-Carrying Ships Listing\n\nMore Information\n\nBooks\n\nBrunei Military Aviation Bibliography – to be added.\n\nMagazines\n\nTo be added\n\nWebsites\n\nOfficial Homepage of the Royal Brunei Air Force\n\nwikipedia: Royal Brunei Air Force\n\nScramble: Royal Brunei Air Force\n\nAirliners.net\n\nThis page gives details of some of the aircraft types that were offered or promised to the Royal Brunei Air Force but not delivered, cancelled official orders, and types have been falsely reported as being in service.\n\nBritish Aerospace Hawk Mk.100\n\nDuring the mid 1990s, the RBAF was seriously interested in obtaining a squadron of Hawk 100 advanced jet trainers, but no order was actually signed.\n\nBritish Aerospace Hawk Mk.200\n\nThe RBAF was also interested in a squadron of Hawk 200 light fighters in the mid 1990s but, again, no order was placed.\n\nAgusta-Bell AB212\n\nThree AB212s were reported in service with the RBAF. Probably confusion with the Bell 212 Twin Huey that was actually used.\n\nCASA C.212 Aviocar\n\nEleven C.212s have been reported in service. None were actually delivered.\n\nSIAI Marchetti SF.260TP Warrior\n\nFour of the turbo-prop version of the SF.260 were reported in service. This is most likely a confusion with the SF.260W piston-engined version that was actually used.\n\nSikorsky S-55/H-19\n\nSeveral sources give the first helicopter type operated by the Royal Brunei Malay Regiment as the Sikorsky S-55 – including the official history. These helicopters were actually Westland-built WS-55 Whirlwind Srs 3 examples. The WS-55 was a licence-built development of the S-55.\n\nSikorsky S-62\n\nOne S-62 is reported to have been used by the RBAF 1966-1967. None were actually used."
