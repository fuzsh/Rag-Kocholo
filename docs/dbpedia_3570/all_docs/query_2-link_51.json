        "text": "The most complicated of the ones I've posted so far is the falangist Silesian roundel - but that's deliberate. Those guys don't care for practicality, they only care for intimidation and \"sending a message\" to their potential adversaries. The rest of the roundels mostly try to avoid any hard-to-paint shapes or charges, though I admit that the tree in the latest one might take some time to paint. But it's meant as more of a template for the charge on other specimens of the roundel, it doesn't have to be the exact same shape, outside of a few details. That country uses planes with lighter camo colours and doesn't have that much aircraft anyway, so the roundel's visibility isn't that affected, despite its darker colours. The tree charge doesn't appear in other local air force roundels either.\n\nWell, to give an example, take your roundels for Falangist Silesia and DROK. When seen from a distance, both are dark outer, less dark mid, bright inner, in broadly similar colours when under poor lighting conditions. If they're on the same side, that's less of an issue, but if they aren't, then there's the potential for friendly fire. Consider this by way of analogy - the British and French roundels are virtually identical under poor lighting, but when they were fighting the Germans it didn't matter as the other team used a totally different shape - the cross variations. A few posts back I posted a roundel chart for a Great War in a surviving Confederacy world, where each alliance has picked a shape - you want to be thinking along those lines, if this is around the time air forces are being established. If it isn't then you have two options for countries with similar insignia - the Dutch adopted a temporary scheme of a distinct colour and shape to differentiate themselves from their roundel-bearing neighbors during the Phony War, and Germany's allies in WW2 adopted insignia echoing the German insignia, when their peacetime insignia were quite different. Just something to think about.\n\nA belated cross-post. The first grouping is the Entente, the second the Allies, and the third the neutral powers, iirc.\n\nI like the idea of different shapes for each power block, and you have very sensibly used very simple designs. On the other hand, many of the colors are so similar that I would think they could be easily confused at medium and long range. It's probably no accident that all of the OTL Central powers (even Turkey) used only black and white in their insignia. Also, there's the example of red being completely eliminated from all US and British/Australian/New Zealander roundels in the Pacific War\n\nI like the idea of different shapes for each power block, and you have very sensibly used very simple designs.

I imagine there'd be a few changes if there were a WW2-type conflict.\n\nGuys, I just can't decide what roundel to give to one of my fictional countries. If you can spare some time, please help me decide which of the ones I've made so far could work best as a practical air force roundel.\n\nHere's the country's flag. I want to use the country's colours and, outside of the first roundel design, perhaps with a triangular shape in the middle of the roundel, symbolic of the country's many high and pictoresque mountain ranges.\n\nOK, here are the following three designs I've come up with so far :"
