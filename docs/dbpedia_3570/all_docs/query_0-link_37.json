        "text": "Inspiring Women Entrepreneurs: Andy Blair in Conversation\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nIt just seems that traditional pipelines for success weren't built for us. It's like we're wearing a scratchy sweater that just does not fit. And it's not going to change until we create new models of what successful leadership looks like.\n\nI think we need to break those existing pipelines and build new ones that fit for the diverse range of people we actually need to solve some of these really big challenges ahead of us, least of all the climate crisis.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nWelcome to Sustainability Leaders. I'm Michael Torrance, Chief Sustainability Officer with BMO Financial Group. On this show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate, investor, academic and NGO communities to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment, business practices, and our world.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, its affiliates, or subsidiaries.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nHi, I'm Melissa Fifield, head of the BMO Climate Institute. And today we're joined by Andy Blair, co-founder of Upflow, a geothermal research and innovation company based in New Zealand. Upflow is dedicated to harnessing the vast potential of geothermal energy to provide intelligent solutions to global industries.\n\nAndy was selected as an awardee for the We Empower UN SDG Challenge. The We Empower UN SDG Challenge is the first of its kind global competition for social entrepreneurs who are advancing the UN sustainable development goals, and inspiring entire communities to act, to create the world we want by 2030. Welcome, Andy.\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nKia ora, Melissa. Hi, everybody.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nTo start, can you please give our audience more background about yourself and Upflow?\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nSure. So at Upflow, we want to inspire people to use STEAM to solve the world's most pressing problems. And I mean that in two ways. STEAM, the acronym for science, technology, engineering, arts and math. And steam, the superheated water vapor that we all know.\n\nUpflow is a research and innovation company from the geothermal energy sector. So in English, it means that we take gifts from the earth and use them to build bridges between pure science and the business world. So we are solutioneers. We do the really hard, complex stuff that allows science to solve real world problems. We really like difficult problems.\n\nNow, there's two big problems, climate change and hunger. We are working with a Maori organization that owns geothermal assets. Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, demand more than economic outcomes. So social, cultural and environmental outcomes are as, if not more, important than dollars.\n\nWe've sourced two microorganisms from their geothermal ecosystem. Now these bugs work together symbiotically, eating greenhouse gases and producing single-cell protein. Yes, food. So what starts out as carbon dioxide and methane ends up as food. Now, right now it's for animals, but someday for humans.\n\nNow, I won't say that it's easy. Our scientists and engineers are scratching their heads all day every day. But they love it.\n\nNow me, I have always been the translator in between business, science, and community. I'm curious about people in the world. I feel confident in the gray, that space of uncertainty. I'm okay with being wrong. I'm okay with making mistakes. Because as we all know, you have to be brave to try new things.\n\nAnd also, being wrong doesn't mean the end. And no doesn't mean the end. It just simply means you have to find a different way around it. It's not easy to raise money for R&D, it's a risky endeavor. But the tough problems need the most clever solutions and the most daring to create them. And that's our sweet spot, the hard spot.\n\nAnd with support, we'll keep solutioneering and solving problems with steam. Both kinds.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nI love your story, Andy. I think what you're doing is absolutely incredible, and I love that there's multiple benefits to the work that you've done and the solutions that you've uncovered. As you are looking to pursue the business, what factors influenced you to focus on sustainability in particular?\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nThanks, Melissa. Yeah, I've always been interested in science and the world. And when I joined the geothermal industry 17-odd years ago, I saw how transformational geothermal projects are for the communities that surround them. And when you think about typical geothermal and volcanic environments, they're usually in rural, low socioeconomic locations.\n\nAnd geothermal projects offer access to energy, minerals, and other resources that enable economic development. They provide food security, provides access to water, and a raft of other opportunities that can help people prosper.\n\nA really cool example of this is in El Salvador, in Ahuachapan Geothermal Plant, they use the water from the geothermal cooling tower to water cacao and coffee plants for a commercial operation. And here they hire over 600 local women. And why they focus on women is because they know that if you lift up women, she will take everyone around her, with her.\n\nAnd I don't have children, and I feel like I have a moral obligation to try and make the world a fairer, more equitable place for everybody's children. And so at Upflow, our why is we want to do good stuff with great people for the good of the world. And the core of that means sustainability for humans and the planet.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's incredible. From your experience as a woman business leader, how do you see women navigating the barriers and challenges that they may face when working to participate equally from an economic perspective?\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nYeah, that's a really, really big question. And the institutionalized bias is so hard to see that we live in. And so we're always doubting whether there is bias or not bias. We see a lot of women, when they're hitting brick walls as they climb ladders in the corporate world, we get frustrated about how we don't fit. We feel like our contributions aren't being valued to the extent that our male colleagues are. Our values start to be more challenged by the success equals profits equals success equation. We get caught in that likability versus competency dilemma, where women can be either of those things but men can be both.\n\nAnd also, we really feel really heavily that burden of being the only woman at the table. And oftentimes we just don't see a clear path forward, or people that look like us at the top. It just seems that traditional pipelines for success weren't built for us. It's like we're wearing a scratchy sweater that just does not fit.\n\nAnd it's not going to change until we create new models of what successful leadership looks like. I think we need to break those existing pipelines and build new ones that fit for the diverse range of people we actually need to solve some of these really big challenges ahead of us, least of all the climate crisis.\n\nSo I think my advice is to women out in the world, out there, is push really hard from wherever you are. You have allies that you don't even know about yet. But if you push, they will make themselves known to you.\n\nBe intolerant of unfairness. Call it out, shine a light on it. Because even if you don't get that immediate response you were looking for, people often won't say, you are right, I'm wrong. That was bad. You will feel empowered and good about yourself, and this will also make you braver to call it out the next time you see it, and empower those around you to call it out and do the same.\n\nAnd I think the most important thing is that if you are in a position to climb, do it. Get to the top as fast as you can. Who caress if you filled a quota, or you were promoted because you were a woman or the diversity hire. We need every single one of you at the top to dismantle the infrastructure, and start throwing ladders down to those coming behind us. We need to do it now.\n\nAnd we need all genders to help us get there. This is not a woman's problem, this is a societal problem. And we can't simply wait and hope for fairness because it's not working. So that would be those comments for women out there who are listening in.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThose are some fantastic gems. I love the analogy of a scratchy sweater. But also just the image of throwing ladders down, I think that's so important is to use our physicians to help uplift others. Which you're obviously doing an incredible job at.\n\nShifting gears a little bit, what do you see your business would need, and perhaps other businesses that are also working toward a more sustainable future, what would they need to achieve more widespread impact?\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nYeah, I think we all need oxygen. And by oxygen I mean money. All we need, is just some oxygen to breathe and move. And if I think about MySpace and all that entrepreneurial, tech R&D space, that the current funding models, the pre-seed R&D grants, model funding streams, they just take so long to work through a funding path, that when you're a startup business cashflow, you live and die on your cashflow.\n\nAnd those long, burdensome administrative processes are just so heavy that you see a lot just opt out. Also, these groups of funders, they're really risk-adverse. And these solutions and things that we are coming up with, this new tech, this new climate tech, they just don't fit the norm.\n\nBecause guess what? The norm got us here. So of course they're not going to fill the traditional commercial requirements, the structures, project pathways, timelines, et cetera, that traditional projects will be able to do.\n\nEvery key element of delivery is going to be different. So either we have to fit ourselves into those commercial boxes and reduce our focus on purpose, or we have to spend so much time trying to educate grant managers, funders, investors and banks, and other gatekeepers on why what we're trying to do is the right thing to do, and that the impact will be great and important. I mean, that's an ongoing rhetoric we have to keep spouting.\n\nBut are people important? Is the climate important? Yes. But where are the dollars? So we need more focus on that quadruple bottom line that profit, people, purpose, and planet. And as much as we hear the people from those institutions saying, \"we are focused on that, that's true.\" It's not true.\n\nBasically, what are demanded of us is that not only do we have to have all the financial requirements of a traditional investment, but we all have to add on top the burden of environmental outcomes, social outcomes as well. So it's weighed heavier.\n\nSo research and development, that entrepreneurialism, and that creativity gets suffocated in the administrative burden and the risk-adverse funding pathways. And so we often opt out of the corporate space to do things. But the massive gender bias in the VC space means that if you're a woman capital raising, it's almost defeat before you behind. I think last year it was 2% of VC funds went to women in the Americas, and 0.9% in Europe. So it just feels like defeat before you start.\n\nAnd I think what we really need is for people to realize that this is urgent, that governments and large funds are being cautious, and risk-averse, and saving for a rainy day. Well, guess what? It's raining. Start spending the reserves because we have zero time left.\n\nIf it takes two years to get seed funding, it means that we are five to 10 years away from real, commercially-scaled decarbonization technology and products. We do not have that much time. 2030 is seven years away.\n\nSo in order for myself, my company, and people around me to really get moving and put solutions in play for our climate goals, we need these groups to start spending this money, start supporting founders, and understand they know how to make their projects work and live in the real world. No one more than them wants their business to succeed, so we'll do what it takes. So just believe us, and give us some oxygen.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nWise words. I think sometimes sustainability and climate issues can feel really intimidating, and really big. You've already made the point that we need to start spending those reserves and accessing capital to help advance the research needed to bring some of those solutions online.\n\nFrom your perspective, what do you see ... I think sometimes we think that maybe only the biggest actions have the most effect. But from your perspective, what are the ways that individuals can have the most impact on climate change?\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nYeah, it can sometimes feel really overwhelming how big the challenge is. And the fact that we need to halve our missions by 2030 to achieve net-zero by 2050 just sounds like a lot. Because it is a lot. I think about a quote that actually Theodore Roosevelt says, which is, \"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.\"\n\nThis is not environmental crisis, it's a human crisis. The planet's going to live on without us. It's us that want to live on. And so we have to go together through this, and we have to bring everyone with us. I think we all need to start realizing, this is urgent. And that we need to look at the problem now and act. We need to adopt a disruption mindset. I think everybody does in their everyday life.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you are buying groceries for your household or you're procuring goods and services for your business. If you're organizing an event and saying, well, what sort of cups and plates are you using? How are you going to distribute our goods?\n\nEverywhere where you are can make a difference. There is no silver bullet, there's no one answer, there's no perfect place. There's paralysis if we look for perfection. We must all act imperfectly, and use our ability to influence where we are, and stop seeking perfection. Just get moving. Let's just get on the path.\n\nAnd then we'll be able to move in small increments, and get to the right place. But we can't stand still anymore. We have to move. And we can do it. I have so much optimism about this. If you could meet all of the smart people that I meet in this tech space, you would believe we could do it. But we need everyone to come with us, and not sit back and wait for perfect.\n\nWe just need to break the existing frameworks of the old, and do things differently. And just like when the digital age transformation happened, we just need everything to break and move. We need to be bold, and ambitious, and demand more of each other, and encourage each other.\n\nAnd I think when we saw with Covid, what happened was, people saw an immediate problem. And we all came together and sought solutions. And I think we need that kind of urgency and focus to get to where we need to go, to really achieve our climate goals. And I absolutely believe we can do it.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nAbsolutely. Is there anything else you want to add to our conversation?\n\nAndy Blair:\n\nNo, just that ... No, meaning yes. That's a thing we say in New Zealand. We say, yeah, nah, which is a confusing statement.\n\nI would just like to add that the solutions are out there. And they are not going to suit the traditional ways we've done things. And if you are sitting inside a traditional system of funding, or other kind of support that can help tech, start spending the money. Stop being so risk adverse. It's time to move.\n\nAnd also all of you women, you wahine out there, it's time to stand up and push. We can't wait anymore. So hopefully I get to see more of your faces in the sunlight, and standing in front of some amazing tech. And kiora to BMO and our partners who have supported us in the We Empower awards. We've just had our minds blown from the support. We need more of what you are doing to support women, and help get us where we need to be. So thanks very much, kiora koto.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nFantastic. Andy, thank you so much. You're an inspiration and we're so grateful to have you on our podcast today. And look forward to watching all the incredible things that you're working on, and seeing them come to fruition.

We could recirculate at least 80% of the air, which would mean a 40% decrease in greenhouse gases.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nWelcome to Sustainability Leaders. I'm Michael Torrance, Chief Sustainability Officer with BMO Financial Group. On this show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate, investor, academic and NGO communities to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment business practices and our world.\n\nSpeaker 4:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, its affiliates or subsidiaries.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nHi, I'm Melissa Fifield, head of the BMO Climate Institute. Today we're joined by Susan Blanchet, CEO and founder of Origin Air. Origin Air provides an innovative plant-based indoor air purification solution, and I had the pleasure of meeting Susan during New York Climate Week in September when she was selected as an awardee for the WE Empower United Nations SDG Challenge. The SDGs are the sustainable development goals adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015 that provide a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. The WE Empower Challenge honors innovative women leaders from around the world who are pushing the SDGs forward through sustainable business practices and inspiring others to follow suit. I'm so excited to have you on the podcast today, Susan. Welcome.\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nThank you, Melissa. It's a pleasure to see you again.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nSo to start, can you please give our audience more background about yourself and about Origin Air?\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nYes, definitely. As a teen, I read Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and I was horrified that toxins in our environment accumulate in our bodies. I wanted to do something about it. So at first, I became an environmental lawyer and I was holding operators accountable for contaminated sites. Unfortunately, at only 51, my father was diagnosed with early onset dementia. He was so healthy. He ran every day. He ate right. There were no genetic markers and there was no family history. He'd been a civil engineer working in wastewater treatment plants, notoriously bad air. And because of my experience in contaminated sites, I did research. If his dementia wasn't genetic, it was environmental. But how do you prove that? Air moves, it's difficult to measure.\n\nSo eventually I decided if I couldn't litigate better air, I would learn how to clean it. Origin Air, my company, purifies indoor air. We've combined mechanical air purification with genetically enhanced super plants, a beautiful biofilter that removes volatile organic compounds. These plants metabolize airborne toxins into oxygen and plant growth. And the beauty is if you treat them right, they work continuously and they will never end up in landfills where you find every other filter. But we're just beginning, because something that really bugs me is that we treat indoor air at the expense of our planet.\n\nBefore Covid buildings represented 20% of our greenhouse gas emissions. A building's air is pulled in from outside, but the expense and the carbon footprint come from the cost to heat and cool that air. Facility managers, when Covid happened, started to pull in more and more air exchanges, but instead of recirculating that conditioned air, they just dumped it and pulled in more, like a bathtub without a plug. It's having a faucet run all day every day, and those greenhouse gases doubled.\n\nSo my vision is a building with a huge glass biosphere with air inside the building circulated through our multi barrier filtration, including our genetically enhanced plants, we could recirculate at least 80% of the air, which would mean a 40% decrease in greenhouse gases. At Origin Air we call this our quadruple bottom line, people, planet, profits and plants. So that was actually my pitch from the United Nations SDG challenge that I did in New York at Climate Week. So I thought it would be a great way to share it with the listeners to get inspired as we all were in New York City last month.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nSusan, you have an incredible story and it sounds like a lot of factors influenced you to focus on sustainability in your business model. From a business perspective, how did your focus on sustainability and climate evolve as you were building the business?\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nFrom the outset, sustainability has always been one of our core values. We have grit, sustainability, innovation, and diversity as our core values towards our mission. When I negotiated the rights to the plants, I have global exclusive rights to distribute these genetically modified plants, at first, I didn't have enough plants to do my vision of a biosphere on the roof of buildings. So we started with a commercial unit that has 32 plants in it, and that has been commercialized and is across Canada at this point in a lot of the major centers and included in that with really large customers, Telus, BentallGreenOak, Hudson Pacific Properties. So that's been our initial target, but our goal has always been to grow the plants as quickly as we can to develop this biosphere. Because if I'm cleaning air in a boardroom, I'm not going to make the facility manager turn down the HVAC system, and that really is half of our goal. Half of it is to clean the air, the other half is to make a impact that will assist in us meeting our climate targets.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nFantastic. From your experience as a business owner, how do you see women navigating the barriers and challenges we may face when working to participate equally in the economy?\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nGreat question. Because of my background in law, I was in the first class of 51% females in 1999 when I started my law degree. And because of that, I had this false impression that women were really creating equality in the workplace. When I started my company four years ago, at first raising up other females wasn't something that I thought that I would need to be doing. But it quickly became apparent that women received less than 2% VC funding, but as I got into sales it became more apparent than even worse than that women received less than 0.05% of procurement, and that is just not okay.\n\nSo one of the things that we've done is become part of really large women organizations in Canada. We're part of Women Business Enterprises, which gives us direct access to procurement decision makers, which for a new company, putting you in front of the people that make the decisions without you having to wade through months of introductions to try to get there is a huge step forward. So if I'm speaking to other new woman business organizations and businesses, I would say find these people, find the people interested in supplier diversity, I think it's the time for us to start to make a difference on this.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's great advice. What would your business and perhaps other businesses also working toward a more sustainable future need to achieve more widespread impact? What do you see as being necessary for that?\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nAs a new business there's lots of help with grants and other forms of non-dilutive investment that really help you through your first few years when you're hiring employees and proving your technology. So our technology was proven before I started the company in laboratory, but a lot of people wanted it to be proven in the field. Now we've done that. We've proven through funding from NRCI rep and Innovate BC that our plants removed 37% of volatile organic compounds in the field where these levels are much lower than in laboratory. In laboratory, we were getting results of 82% and higher. So we've also shown that as toxins increase, our plants work harder and metabolize them faster.\n\nAnd the most interesting result we got, which might disappoint a lot of the listeners, is we also showed regular plants do nothing. They don't remove any volatile organic compounds at all. The next step that we need, once you get to that level, and now we're into commercial sales, but we're still developing and there's really a gap that I think needs to be filled by the corporations. Now there's early government funding, but corporations are now the recipients of most of the GDP and have an obligation to fight the climate crisis that we're currently going through. And a good way for them to do that is to fund pilot projects and demonstrations or become partners with innovative companies like mine. Because there's no way I can do this by myself.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nMakes a lot of sense. It may often feel as though the biggest actions have the most effect, but from your perspective, what are the ways individuals can have the most impact on climate change?\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nI think the biggest way for individuals is to just every day use your purchasing power towards supporting diverse and innovative sustainable companies. When we hear 0.05% of procurement, that translates over to the consumer market too. Think about where you're buying. Our company for instance, is coming out with a home unit in summer of 2024, so there's lots of diverse-lead companies that you can choose to purchase from and purchase sustainably. We won't make a virgin plastic unit, for instance. We will be using 100% recycled plastic. So think about where you're buying before you buy.\n\nAnd for my company, sometimes I'm like, we wouldn't even need to be cleaning the air if the air wasn't already dirty. And a lot of consumers don't even know what a volatile organic compound is, but it is in a lot of products you purchase off the shelf. For instance, air fresheners are not good for the air. Perfumes as well, not good for people to be breathing. And just educating yourself on the products that you should or should not buy. Funny story, I have three sons. My youngest comes home a few weeks ago with a Axe body spray. It's a known carcinogen. I don't know why these things are still on the shelf. And if the regulatory agencies aren't protecting us by not allowing them on the shelf in the first place, we really have to do our own education to buy products that are healthy.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nAbsolutely. Education is key. Is there anything else that you'd like to share with our audience today?\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nI think the world is changing quite a bit, and we're really becoming focused more on large corporations taking over most of the ownership of not only properties, but products that are sold. I know in my city, I live in Victoria, BC, every day small businesses are closing. So not only supporting diverse founders, but supporting the small businesses. Because from my history as a provincial lawyer for 14 years working in a really large organization, once organizations have more than even 500 employees, it becomes more of a bureaucracy. I don't want to say that's where innovation goes to die. I'll just say it. It's the small business owners that have this fire in their belly that are up at 3:00 AM trying to figure out how they're going to save the world, and that's really what we need to support. And I'm a big proponent of supporting all small business, but where you can support the ones that are diversely lead because they definitely are fighting the biggest battles.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nWell, you are an inspiration to me, certainly, and I think to a lot of our listeners as well, Susan. Thank you so much for joining me today.\n\nSusan Blanchet:\n\nYou're welcome. Thank you for having me, Melissa.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nThanks for listening to Sustainability Leaders.

I'm Michael Torrance, Chief Sustainability Officer with BMO Financial Group. On this show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate, investor, academic and NGO communities, to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment, business practices and our world.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, its affiliates or subsidiaries.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nHi, I'm Melissa Fifield, head of the BMO Climate Institute. Today we're joined by Menna Farouk, founder and CEO of Dosy, a tech-based scooter and bicycle riding platform for women and girls. Dosy aims to encourage women and girls in Egypt to ride scooters and bicycles by connecting them with riding instructors. Menna was selected as an awardee for the, WE Empower UN SDG Challenge. The WE Empower UN SDG Challenge is the first of its kind global competition for social entrepreneurs who are advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and inspiring entire communities to act, to create the world we want by 2030. Menna, welcome. To start can you please give our audience more background about yourself and Dosy?\n\nMenna Farouk:\n\nSure. Hello. Thank you so much for having me today. So my name is Menna Farouk. I'm a journalist and an entrepreneur. Dosy is an online platform through which women and girls can book their scooter and bicycle classes online. And the company has been operating in Egypt. We started in 2019 and we launched our website later in the same year. So we started in April 2019 and we launched the website in December 2019. And now we're operating in three cities, in Egypt, Cairo, Alexandria, and Giza. And we have over 100 instructors and we have more than 4,000 customers. So we trained them on riding scooters and bicycles in the three locations, Cairo, Alexandria, and Giza. And now we are adding other services for our customers. So we are adding a service to which women can learn skating, women can buy or sell their used scooters and bicycles through our website as well. And we are launching an app for the startup, and the app will include a ride-hailing service and the ride-hailing service we hope that it'll be the Uber Scooter for women in Egypt.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's incredible. As you were building this business, how did sustainability factor into your business plans? How did you think about sustainability in the context of your business?\n\nMenna Farouk:\n\nSo I became interested in sustainability when I realized that the impact that human activity is having on the planet. I wanted to start a business that would help people reduce their reliance on cars and choose more sustainable modes of transportation. I believe that scooters and bicycles are a great way to get around and I want to help more people, especially women, to learn how to ride them safely and confidently and without being affected by any social stereotypes.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nFrom your experience, how can women navigate the barriers and challenges they face when working to participate equally in the economy?\n\nMenna Farouk:\n\nSo let me start first by saying that women, of course, face a number of barriers and challenges when working to participate equally in the economy. And some of these challenges include pay inequality. Women are still paid less than men for doing the same job. Lack of access to childcare, for example. Many women struggle to find affordable and reliable childcare, which can make it difficult to hold down a job, as well as discrimination. So women may face discrimination in the workplace due to their gender, race, or other factors. And in my opinion, to navigate these challenges, women can network with other women in their field. So this can help them find mentors, support and job opportunities, and they can also advocate for themselves. So women should speak about the inequality and discrimination in the workplace. And finally, women can take advantage of government programs and resources as well as private programs and resources. There are a number of government and private programs and resources available to help women succeed in the workplace.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's great. What's needed? Your business or other businesses also working toward a sustainable future need to achieve more widespread impact? How do we scale these things?\n\nMenna Farouk:\n\nYeah, working towards a sustainable future need to be able to scale up. So this means reaching more customers and partners and developing new and innovative products and services. Some ways that the businesses can achieve more widespread impact can be through partnering with other businesses and organizations. This can help businesses reach a wider audience and have a greater impact. Businesses can also invest in research and development, and this can help businesses develop new and innovative products and services that may help people reduce their environmental impact. And businesses can also make their products and services affordable and accessible. Businesses need to make their products affordable and accessible to everyone, not just for those who can afford to pay a premium for sustainability.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's great. Finally, Menna, it may often feel as if only the biggest actions have the most effect, but from your perspective, what are the ways individuals can have the most impact when it comes to climate change?\n\nMenna Farouk:\n\nI think that every individual can make a difference in the fight against climate change. So every person can reduce their carbon footprint, and this can be done through making changes to their lifestyle, such as driving less, eating less meat, and using less energy at home. Every individual also can support businesses that are working towards a sustainable future, by buying their products and services. And every person can get involved in advocacy and activism, to raise awareness of climate change and push for policies that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I believe that even the smallest changes can add up to make a big difference. By making changes to our lifestyles and supporting businesses that are working towards a sustainable future, we can all help to create a better future for our planet.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nWell, you've set an incredible example for our listeners. Thank you for all that you're doing and thanks for joining us today to share your story.\n\nMenna Farouk:\n\nThank you so much for having me, Melissa.

It's essential to have a support system and choose your struggles wisely.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nWelcome to Sustainability Leaders. I'm Michael Torrance, Chief Sustainability Officer with BMO Financial Group. On this show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate, investor, academic, and NGO communities to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment business practices and our world.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, its affiliates or subsidiaries.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nHi. I'm Melissa Fifield, head of the BMO Climate Institute. Today we're joined by Diana Mbogo, founder and managing director of Millennium Engineers Enterprises Limited, a renewable energy social enterprise in Tanzania that focuses on developing customized energy solutions. Diana was selected as an awardee for the WE Empower UN SDG challenge. The WE Empower UN SDG Challenge is the first of its kind global competition for social entrepreneurs who are advancing the UN sustainable development goals and inspiring entire communities to act, to create the world we want by 2030. Welcome, Diana.\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nThank you, Melissa, for having me.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nTo start, can you please give our audience more background about yourself and about Millennium Engineers Enterprises?\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nYes. Just to kickstart with that, I was born prematurely and faced many odds growing up. My childhood experience and my mother's unconditional love led me to believe I could achieve anything I set my mind on. And in her eyes, I kept seeing myself as a princess and a warrior. So it went from going to an engineering college and starting my company during my last academic year to leading Millennium Engineers as a single mother of two beautiful children. And currently, Millennium Engineers Enterprises Limited is proudly a hundred percent female founded and led renewable energy company that specializes in untapped energy poverty markets. We design customized solutions for specific communities, industries, or value chains, and currently Millennium Engineers is focused in addressing some of the critical challenges faced by local communities and local fishing communities of Lake Victoria. What this entails is a transition of these low income communities in Lake Victoria away from using pressurized kerosene lamps or LED lead acid power battery lamps that are usually attached to wooden flotillas towards the use of efficient, solar efficient lamps that now float a top recycled plastic flotillas.\n\nThis conversional methods not only contribute to environmental degradation, but also hindered economic growth of these communities as well. This transition significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the kerosene and keeps harmful batteries out of Lake Victoria's, but furthermore, it allows for the quiet growth of trees along the shores of Lake Victoria promoting ecological sustainability. But we went further considering, which is also a women-led enterprise. For the women in these communities that are usually traditionally accustomed to unhygienic and conventional method of sardine drying, we introduce first of their kind solar drying facilities for fish. These facilities are groundbreaking across Sub-Saharan Africa and can dry substantial amounts in a single day using 70% less land space. This not only increases the yield by 70%, but it also empowers these women to and a premium market price for their produce, improving their economic sustainability and hazing food security in the region. Being considered that sardines are a vital source of protein, making this impact even more significant across the continent.\n\nThe beauty of this project lies in the holistic approach that we entail. It's not just about providing renewable energy solutions, but also understanding that the unique needs culture challenges of these communities. Millennium engineers works closely with these local communities to ensure that the solutions cater the specific requirements addressing cost efficiency, cultural considerations, efficiency and environmental sustainability. So that's just more of a quick wrap of Millennium engineers and my story behind it as well.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nIt's an incredible story. Thank you. Diana. As you were building your business, what factors influenced you to focus on sustainability?\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nThe challenges faced by underserved communities due to the lack of access of energy for socioeconomic activities when a significant influence, just to go about it, again, when I started off the company, I really didn't look at it as a social enterprise or a for-profit. I was more of an NGO mindset, but I delved into the energy sector and realized the needs for different approach that addresses the majority of those most impacted, especially women. Our focus on sustainability is driven by our user-centered approach because we believe that involving the beneficiary brings out the best solutions to be approached or adapted the innovation and the commitment to creating solutions that truly benefit the communities we serve.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nFrom your experience, how can women navigate the barriers and challenges they may face when working to participate equally in the economy?\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nWomen often face unique challenges in male dominated sectors and all other sectors in general, but my advice will be to push forward with the determination and a vision. It's essential to have a support system and choose your struggles wisely, surrounding yourself with people who believe in your potential, and then an entrepreneur. As an entrepreneur myself, your vision, even if blurry at times, should always motivate you. Being a scholar to life and learning from the challenges is crucial for professional and personal growth as well.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's great advice. What would your business and perhaps other businesses also working toward a sustainable future need to achieve more widespread impact?\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nOn my opinion, to achieve more widespread impact, businesses working towards a sustainable future need to focus on collaboration, innovation, and integrity. We hold those as some of our business values and my personal values as well. Identifying niche markets and energy problems across different industry and communities. Then working closely with the target market to design solution that can lead to the development of innovative, impactful, and sustainable projects. Additionally, sharing findings and best practices within the industry can help drive positive change on a large scale because we can never do it all just alone. We need each other's minds. We need each other's findings, and we need each other to keep pushing this, the goals that we have for 2030.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nAbsolutely. Finally, it may often feel as if only the biggest actions have the most effect, but from your perspective, what are the ways individuals can have the most impact on climate change?\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nIt's truly that every small action counts in the fight against climate change. Every small action counts and everyone counts. Individuals can make significant impact by adapting sustainable practices in their daily lives, just using energy consumption, minimizing waste, and supporting eco-friendly products and initiatives because they're all out there in our communities. Education and advocacy also plays a crucial role in raising awareness and driving change, and we need to start from the young children to adults and youth as well. By making more informed choices and encouraging others to do the same, individuals can collectively contribute to a more sustainable future, I believe.\n\nMelissa Fifield:\n\nThat's great. Thank you so much, Diana, for joining us today. You're doing incredible work and we're so grateful to have you.\n\nDiana Mbogo:\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nThanks for listening to Sustainability Leaders.

There's another team that has designed a freestanding electric streetlight powered by the wind of wind turbine, and they're patenting their design and have begun prototyping in Germany. So for us, sustainability is in the core and it is already giving results.\n\nMichael:\n\nWelcome to Sustainability Leaders. I'm Michael Torrance, chief Sustainability Officer with BMO Financial Group. On this show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate, investor, academic and NGO communities to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment, business practices, and our world.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, it's affiliates, or subsidiaries.\n\nMelissa:\n\nHi, I'm Melissa Fifield, Head of the BMO Climate Institute. Today, we're joined by Karin Sempf, CEO and Founder of Innova-Nation, an educational lab focused on motivating and empowering the upcoming generation of entrepreneurs, innovators, and sustainability advocates. Karin was selected as an awardee of the We Empower UN SDG challenge. The We Empower UN SDG Challenge is the first-of-its-kind global competition for social entrepreneurs who are advancing the UN's sustainable development goals and inspiring entire communities to act to create the world we want by 2030. Karin, welcome. To start, can you please give our audience more background about yourself and Innova-Nation?\n\nKarin:\n\nThank you, Melissa. Thank you for inviting me. I'm very happy to be here. And yes, of course. I'm Karin Sempf, the Founder and Director of Innova-Nation, and I am tuning in from Panama. Innova-Nation is an educational lab, as you mentioned, for the 21st century. We accelerate talent by offering learning programs and innovation challenges and events for children and teenagers from eight to 18. And actually, Melissa, I would have to say that 2020, during the pandemic, confirmed what we were doing, confirmed our mission. We need to rethink and we need to reinvent what education is. We exist because schools are not preparing our youth for the challenges of this world. So we have created more than 30 different programs that include leadership and mindset components and, where I think the magic happens, a take action component. We teach our students about entrepreneurship, STEAM, and sustainability, and they get to create their own projects to solve real-life challenges. So that's a bit more of a background of what we do.\n\nMelissa:\n\nThat's fantastic. As you were looking to pursue your business and build your business, what factors influenced you to focus on sustainability?\n\nKarin:\n\nWell, for me, sustainability is a business imperative. We have integrated sustainability in every aspect of our business. It's actually part of our DNA and it's at the core of what Innova-Nation is. So we teach our students about sustainability. We teach them about the sustainable development goals and how businesses can, in fact, not only be created to receive income and create wealth, which of course has to be done, but also to create positive impact in our communities, so sustainable development. And the goals have been introduced in all of our programs, and we have an approach that integrates innovation and transformative learning to really take our main stakeholders, which are our students, from bystanders to active citizens that are taking action.\n\nAnd for me, this was the only right decision. And now we're seeing, also, the amazing results that that has brought when we see that we are impacting both in the education and entrepreneurship ecosystem in Panama and the region. Since our students are creating innovative ideas to tackle challenges such as ... and I would like to mention, very quickly, a few of them. There's a team that has created AI-powered marketplace that connects customers to eco-friendly companies. They've signed partnerships and funding agreements. There's another team that has designed a freestanding electric streetlight powered by the wind of wind turbine, and they're patenting their design and have begun prototyping in Germany. So for us, sustainability is, as I said, in the core, and it is already giving results.\n\nMelissa:\n\nThat's fantastic and so inspiring. Based on your experience, how can women navigate the barriers and the challenges they may face when working to participate equally in the economy?\n\nKarin:\n\nWell, that's a great question. I think that sorority is the answer. So sororities are those values-based social organizations that were, I think, originally founded to provide women a safe space and bring us together to share common interests, and I think that is so valid nowadays. We need to work in communities. We are navigating so many challenges, given so many roles that we have in our communities, in our businesses, in our families. So I think that sorority and being part of communities where women are empowering other women, and women are creating bridges for other women, is actually the best way to go. I think that I am here because of being part of a community. I am a VV GROW Fellow, which is a Vital Voices Fellow since 2016. And when I entered into that community, my life changed. I started receiving different opportunities and forming part of a more open community where I felt that I was supported and that I could support other women as well.\n\nMelissa:\n\nThat's great. I love that. What would your business, and perhaps other businesses also working toward a more sustainable future, need to achieve more widespread impact?\n\nKarin:\n\nI think we need more awareness and more communication, and I would have to say more education. Education for me is the key, and we need to prepare our youth. So I work with the youth, I work with young people, and I see it program after program. They are coming disengaged from the learning process. They're coming disengaged. They're not loving their education, but I think it's a role that we, all businesses, have to pitch in. For instance, in my country, it's not only about the Ministry of Education. I think we have to have a wider concept. We need the companies, we need institutions to understand that we need younger people to be engaged on sustainability issues so that they can understand what's going on, form part of the discussions, and create ideas. And when they're inheriting the planet, they already understand what's going on. So for me, it's about that. More communication, more awareness, and more access to good education that really gives our youth the skills and the information that they will be needing in a very, very near future as well.\n\nMelissa:\n\nMakes sense. It's up to all of us, right? Yes. Finally, it often may feel as if only the biggest actions have the most effect. But from your perspective, what are the ways that individuals can have the most impact, as it relates to climate change?\n\nKarin:\n\nOne of the things that we teach about in our programs is about how all the goals are universal, are integrated between them, and that the fact that we cannot leave anyone behind. So I'll focus on the fact that they are universal, and that means that all of us have a role to play. It's not only about governments. It's not only about corporations. It's not only about local authorities. But it's about us. And I think that we need to understand more about how climate action impacts our everyday lives. There's a lot of work to be done there so that we feel that it is a responsibility that we have. It's not abstract, it's not other people. It's not the country. It's me and how I can impact and maybe not impact all of them at the same time.\n\nWe always talk about how we can choose. There are 17 SDGs, and maybe it will feel overwhelming to start working on them all at the same time. But if I choose to work on quality of education and if I choose to work in stopping hunger, if I choose to work in health, I can choose where to direct my actions. So I think that's very important. Having those conversations and understand how climate change affects our day-to-day, and how our activities can be more sustainable once we understand the process that we can have.\n\nMelissa:\n\nFantastic. Is there anything else you want to add to the conversation?\n\nKarin:\n\nWell, these conversations are very important. And I think that understanding that we are part of a global society, that we are global citizens, and that my actions have and could have repercussions in other countries, and we are all in this together, I think that has a lot of power. So when we come together as a community and we start exchanging ideas and inviting other people, I think that's how we achieve a more sustainable future. So I'm really happy to be part of this. I'm, of course, very honored, also, to be the We Empower UN SDG Challenge awardee for the Latin American and the Caribbean Region, where I think that this type of conversations need to happen more and more every day. So Melissa and the BMO team, again, thank you for inviting me and having this conversation.\n\nMelissa:\n\nThank you so much for joining us, Karin. Appreciate it and appreciate all that you're doing to drive this education forward. It's so needed and what you've been doing has been inspiring, so thank you for joining us.\n\nKarin:\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael:\n\nThanks for listening to Sustainability Leaders.

But the public sector's role is critical in supporting and accelerating those efforts to meet the timeline that we're facing. This is not an artificial deadline. We need all hands on deck in rowing together to get there.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nWelcome to Sustainability Leaders. I'm Michael Torrance, chief sustainability officer at BMO. On this show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate investor, academic, and NGO communities to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment, business practices, and our world.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, its affiliates, or subsidiaries.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nHi, I'm Angela Adduci, senior advisor to BMO Climate Institute. And today, I'm joined by Elizabeth Wolfe, senior advisor at the United States Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, or LPO for short. Elizabeth, welcome and thank you for joining me today.\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nThank you for having me, Angela.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nTo start, I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about the DOE Loan Programs Office broadly and your specific area of focus within the LPO.\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nSure. DOE LPO is a multi-hundred billion dollars lender and loan guarantor within the federal government. LPO provides a bridge to bankability for a wide variety of energy projects, including those deploying innovative technology supported by a state or a tribe or decarbonizing energy infrastructure. Within the LPO, I work within our outreach and business development team where I coordinate our efforts to develop virtual power plants and state supported projects.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nThis is really fascinating. And I imagine many listeners were not previously familiar with the concept of VPPs. So I would be curious to hear what potential do VPPs have in the overall energy transition and what role does the LPO anticipate taking on in supporting this emerging technology?\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nSure. Well, if I had $1 for every definition I've heard for virtual power plants, I would be rich. But virtual power plants are a part of a paradigm shift that's happening right now as part of the energy transition. Instead of relying solely on large, centralized baseload power generation, building more and more of it to meet increasing demand, the grid today is also making better use of distributed energy resources or DERs. Today, we're adjusting and shifting the load dynamically in near real time to meet demand reliably and affordably, even when large scale infrastructure cannot be built quickly enough. Enabled by technological advances in big data computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as market developments such as FERC order 2222, VPPs are already playing a critical role and have been credited with significant contributions to emergency reliability responses in places like California and other early adopters.\n\nLPO identified a number of priority technology areas and VPPs are one of them. We already closed a $3 billion transaction with Sunnova Project Hestia that was recently recognized as the 2023 asset-backed securitization deal of the year by International Financing Review. So we're excited about that. And we're hoping to announce more projects in the coming year.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nWell, congrats. And it's really cool to see all this activity out of the Department of Energy. So now, I want to zoom out for a moment. I know you've worked across both the public sector and the private sector in a variety of energy-related roles. Can you tell us a little bit about your view on the public sector programs and private capital providers working together to finance emerging technologies? Where have you seen notable success and where could the financing ecosystem perhaps be doing better?\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nWell, in my role at the Loan Programs Office and also in my previous work at the New York Green Bank, a state version of the Loan Programs Office, I've seen public funding catalyze and accelerate innovation, both technological and financial needed to achieve our energy transition. Before I arrived here at LPO, the organization had already established itself funding the first utility-scale solar PV installations in the US, Tesla's first EV factory, and so many more. LPO can guarantee third party loans and de-risk critical elements to enable the private sector to develop its own ability to support projects and graduate beyond the need for public support. The public sector has come a long way toward incorporating equity considerations in its underwriting since I began in this field when greenhouse gas emissions was the new consideration beyond the prospect of repayment, which of course we all share as a concern across the private and the public sector. But the financing ecosystem could still do better in underwriting revenue streams related to energy savings and grid services and underwriting projects involving portfolios with unrated or shorter-term offtake in a more scalable way.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nThat's really great insight, Elizabeth, and I really appreciate your perspective on that. So to switch gears for a moment, March is Women's History Month. And though we've made great strides in encouraging equitable participation of women in the energy sector, we do still have a ways to go. So could you please reflect on your time in the industry with respect to gender representation?\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nSure. Well, I mean at LPO and DOE, it's easy. We see women leading at the highest levels in the public sector. I mean, Jennifer Granholm is our fearless secretary of energy is a good example, and she's not even the first female secretary of energy. Bill Clinton had appointed Hazel O'Leary back in the '90s. And closer to home in our own office, our Chief Operating Officer, Sheila Moynihan, and Chief Counsel Becky Limmer are just a few of the women in top leadership roles. And while many women are also leading in the private sector, like you yourself, Angela, of course, my experience has been that there's more work to be done to move beyond outdated linear career trajectories and embrace the more flexible myriad paths to success that our newer cloud-based work style can enable.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nThank you, Elizabeth. Your perspective on this is just so valuable. And I'm sure I speak for many women when I say it's incredible to have leaders like you, Secretary Granholm, as well as the others you mentioned to look up to in the industry. So wrapping up, do you have any final thoughts to share regarding the public sector's role in financing emerging clean technologies?\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nFinancing the energy transition and clean technologies is and has to be led by the private sector. But the public sector's role is critical in supporting and accelerating those efforts to meet the timeline that we're facing. This is not an artificial deadline. We need all hands on deck in rowing together to get there.\n\nAngela Adduci:\n\nA great final message and I couldn't agree more. Thank you so much, Elizabeth, for joining us.\n\nElizabeth Wolfe:\n\nSure thing. Thank you, Angela.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nThanks for listening to Sustainability Leaders.

In conversation with EDC Chief Corporate Sustainability Officer, Justine Hendricks, and Jonathan Hackett, Co-Head of the BMO Energy Transition Group and Head of Sustainable Finance at BMO. Their discussion focuses on how banks, governments and companies in Canada are working to enable the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nI'm Dan Barclay, CEO, and Group Head of BMO Capital Markets. Today I'm joined by Justine Hendricks, Senior Vice President and Chief Corporate Sustainability Officer at Export Development Canada, or at EDC and Jonathan Hackett Co-Head of BMOs Energy Transition Group and Head, Sustainable Finance. We're here to discuss the role of private and public finance in helping companies reach net zero by 2050. Justine and Jonathan, it's great to have you with us today. I'm looking forward to what I'm sure will be a fascinating conversation about the role of our organizations as we face, engage, and help enable a historic global energy transition. Let's dive in. So, we have some very exciting news today, which is the announcement of a collaboration between BMO and EDC to bring sustainable finance solutions to Canadian businesses and carbon-intensive sectors to help them reduce or eliminate emissions. Perhaps we can start with you Justine to describe the agreement and what it means from an EDC perspective.\n\nJustine:\n\nThanks Dan. First, before I get started with that, I just want to thank BMO and yourselves. It's really neat and exciting to be here today to talk about this collaboration between BMO and EDC. So, you asked me a question, what does it mean from EDC's perspective? Well, at EDC, we see ourselves along with other financiers in Canada, as playing an important role to date, and we see ourselves continuing to play a key one from an ecosystem point of view, towards how we can better support the transitioning to a lower carbon future and doing so in a way that's very equitable, right? So, the goals are ambitious. I think Dan, Jonathan, we were all at COP26 and the debate graduated from the billions to the trillions. So, the amounts that we're facing are substantive, the opportunity is as well. And I think this is where collaboration and a partner like BMO comes into play...\n\nJustine:\n\nSo, we know that Canadian companies need to finance these solutions in order to not only help them grow, but also while they do so while they reduce their carbon footprint. And then it can also materialize on their ESG objectives. So, essentially, from the ECD's perspective, this is what this allows us to do. Two organizations coming together, collaborating, risk sharing around some of the risks and the opportunities of this, and really being there for Canadian companies. So, let me maybe tell you, as you ask from an EDC perspective, what does this guarantee structure mean, right? So, for EDC, EDC in this sense will guarantee up to 50% of the term loan. So, it's up to a maximum of US60 million per obligor, for a period of up to seven years. So, that will provide more capacity for BMO to support their [inaudible 00:04:13] clients to low carbon transition...\n\nJustine:\n\nSo, as we were doing this collaboration, we started to take a look at what are some of the sectors of opportunity, and we came up with nine. But maybe for the purpose of the audience, I'll name a few to give them a bit of a teaser, I guess. So, one was sustainable agriculture. We also have carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, which I know is really important as well as microgrid. So, that's, just to name a few that we're trying target with this collaboration. And really in terms of us being able to do this with BMO is an opportunity for EDC as well, to take some concrete steps and how we can help support carbon-intensive sectors. And for us to be leading by example as well as we've done in our history and fostering and doing so with an ESG mindset. And we know then I would say is, Canada's got tons to offer. We see this as a big opportunity and we really want Canada to go and seize that opportunity as we're all trying to transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nWell, thanks Justine. And I think like you, I was at COP26 and was struck with the amount of change that was on the table. And when I think about that fundamental role in EDC, helping Canadian companies export expertise, technology, and building businesses, this is very exciting. Jonathan, why don't I turn it over to you? And we know what EDC is bringing the table, so what are we bringing on the table?\n\nJonathan:\n\nDan, so as we think about what we've been doing over the last few years, as we've built up our approach surrounding energy transition around sustainable finance, really spurred on BMO’s purpose to boldly grow the good in business and life. We've devoted a lot of resources to thinking about how we can work with our clients, how we can understand their needs in this space. And so those capabilities are what we're really bringing first and foremost, our energy transition technical team, the depth that our lenders have built working with these companies. But we're also bringing what I would call just pure energy. We've got bankers across the organization that are focused on this, that are thinking about how they can work with their clients, how they can work with and attract new clients in this space. And we really think by having something like this, having a program that we can point to as a differentiated approach to provide capital, it'll allow us to really drive that forward and accelerate both EDC and BMO's approach in the space and get us the experience we want working with those companies today.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nSo, I think I get most of the thesis as with our audience, but help me take it through Jonathan, why is this important? Why do businesses need financing that's specifically focused on transition and why does this collaboration focus on the carbon-intensive sectors?\n\nJonathan:\n\nSo, I'll answer the latter first and I think it helps get to the former. So, why we focus on carbon-intensive sectors is that, that's where the biggest near term impact really can be made. The reality is that we're trying to finance across the organization, technologies that are going to be low carbon solutions in the future that are really going to help build into the economy, set of solutions that allow others to decarbonize in a large way. But near term, we really need to invest in companies to make the changes that will drive large amounts of carbon out of the way they run their businesses today. That can be things like fuel switching, going from a higher intensity carbon based fuel to a lower intensity carbon based fuel. It can be about demand management, really reducing how much energy they consume. But these are all solutions that can take large amounts of emissions out of the environment over the next 10 years, 20 years. So, that when we get to a net zero economy, we're doing it with less residual impact, less emissions that are going to drive temperature change in the future...\n\nJonathan:\n\nWhy it's important for companies to get financing just for this, though is a bit more subtle. Really when you're working and running a smaller or medium size company, you're focused on your day to day business. And that's what you understand best. And helping companies access a set of solutions. And to finance those alongside their business is a unique opportunity because you can give them advice. You can help them understand what they can do to transform their business, but you can also unlock a cost savings usually, or some change in their operating profile. That could be beneficial to the business and give it resilience in the future if you support it with the right debt. And so because that doesn't look like they have day to day, it really does need solutions and tools to help them see how this can compete in their priorities versus other near term aspects of their business and get the focus on it. That'll allow us to drive that change in their business nearer term.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nAnd how does the collaboration help? What does the collaboration achieve that each of our two organizations can't do on her own?\n\nJonathan:\n\nSo I'll chime in first and then Justine, I'd love your thoughts on it as well. For us, some of this is just about how we take risk. The reality is that we want to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to the material economy. And that's going to involve working with them on nascent or emerging technologies, things like hydrogen or having capture, where you're really investing in something that it exists. We've seen it operate, but we don't have the depth of expertise that we have in some of the more traditional, more carbon-intensive spaces...\n\nJonathan:\n\nAnd so, we're really trying to think about how we can be there and be there in a more significant way for our clients. But that involves taking risk. And banks are notoriously focused on “How do we moderate and make sure that when we take risks, we're getting rewarded and taking outsize risks is something that can be challenging?” And so by sharing that balance sheet, by going with a friend, making sure that we're working on this together, we're we can devote a set of expertise and capabilities and energy that allows us to say yes to more than we could if we were operating on our own.\n\nJustine:\n\nYeah, we are at a historical point in time. And the changes that are required are significant, right? So, Jonathan talked about new sectors, new risks, longer periods of time, and being able to tackle it together. So, this is for me when I think of this question, right? I think of the book of, what got you here may not get you to the next level. And it feels like we're at that moment where we need everybody's expertise in terms of what got them to this point, but recognizing the enormity of the challenge that they're ahead of us, we need to be able to come together in terms of either sharing the risk...\n\nJustine:\n\nI'd also say sharing the knowledge, because there'll be lots of learning along the way. And if we do that together, I think we'll be able to have a lot more impact faster because, as Jonathan mentioned, recognizing the importance of starting early, but starting now and starting to get these wins. I think was also part of the contribution to what sparked this collaboration, because we knew that we needed to be able to give that signal to the market and wanted to get started with those companies as Jonathan says, that in terms of their list of priorities, day to day, the reality is, this may not be part of it, so we can play definitely a role to incorporate it in terms of their thinking for the future.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nSo, Justine let's pivot a little bit and talk about some of the target companies here. EDC has been a trailblazer in Canada's innovation story. It's one of the largest financiers of Queen Tech in Canada. And it was the first [inaudible 00:11:26] institution to issue a green bond. And the first export credit agency to commit to net zero by 2050. How does financing carbon-intensive businesses fit into EDC's mandate as an export credit agency?\n\nJustine:\n\nNow. That's a great question, Dan. So, I guess I start off by saying that being an export credit agency, what comes with that is that our philosophy and our belief is that we need to engage with all industries, right? And that includes industries that are carbon-intensive. So, we're looking at obviously leveraging the efforts that have already begun and also recognizing that as we've stated a bit earlier, I think some of these carbon-intensive industries within the Canadian context of a resource based economy can bring a huge contribution in terms of the momentum that we need towards achieving some of these net zero objectives that we have and respecting the Paris Agreement commitments that we made...\n\nJustine:\n\nSo, our job as an export agency is not only to engage, but to support those individual companies and the philosophy we bring to the table is that we believe that companies invest in this and in enabling ESG within their business model, their thinking will not only spark Canadian innovation, but it'll actually be an accelerator to their growth. So, regardless of a company where it's at or the industry that it's at, or the market that it's targeting for, is very much at the heart of a ECA, as we say, as an export credit agency, to make sure that we can be there for them and in order to be able to support them in this transition.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nSo, Justine, that was very helpful in terms of how you're thinking about this. But more generally, are there other types of companies that you're trying to support on this initiative or certain technologies or certain sub sectors, anything that could help our listeners?\n\nJustine:\n\nIt's a great follow on Dan. And maybe what I can mention is, from an export credit agency where we're looking to support companies be successful internationally, right? So, certainly what I would love to share with the audience today is, if we look at some of the key markets, so we think of North America, we think of Europe and we think of Asia. There's certainly sectors that we can see that we see with high potential, right? So, if you think of the infrastructure sector, I would say clean tech goes across all of these different markets. And there's lots that Canadian capabilities have to offer. Two weeks ago, at Globe we were talking about Canada's ability to help agri-food become more sustainable globally. I would certainly articulate that there's lots that we can offer across North America, Europe and Asia in that regard...\n\nJustine:\n\nAnd it's twofold. I would say there's the technology component, all of these sectors. There's the know-how with some of these sectors are transforming. That will not only help Canada, but we can bring around the world to help others transform. And I think also in some instances in Europe, in particular, I'm thinking of our ability to become part of some of these major supply chains is also a real opportunity for Canada...\n\nJustine:\n\nMaybe in that, what I'd offer is, if you think of short, medium and long term, certainly North America, we can see immediate opportunity there. Europe as well to the medium term. When we think of Asia, we include India, China, and all the Asian nations. Definitely, we see that as a medium to long term investment, but as you can see, there's lots that Canada has to offer. And certainly, as Canadian companies and even partners such as BMO, work with ourselves and the Canadian trade ecosystems, such as the trade commissioners and other services, either in Canada or abroad. It can really help in terms of demystifying. I would say that the export journey of some of these companies and really help connect them to some very tangible opportunities.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nI love all of that. Absolutely all of it. Jonathan, let's put another layer on this. Why do you think these types of collaborations are important for the road to net zero and helping us and our clients mitigate the risk of climate change?\n\nJonathan:\n\nYes. I think I'll go back to a little bit of what I was saying earlier about, just the amount of emissions that we can remove ahead of getting to 2050. I go back to the steepness of those curves is always the thing that people argue about how quickly can we remove carbon. And the focus often is, can we get down towards that zero and how much is going to be left towards the end. But to me, the thing that is most meaningful, is just how do we remove the area under that curve? The area under the curve of carbon versus time really is, how much is out there in our atmosphere. And what is going to drive those risks of climate change. And so, when you see that large imposing challenge, people estimate it in the trillions of dollars a year, every year for the next 30 years, the answer is we need everything...\n\nJonathan:\n\nWe need collaborations that are bringing creativity, that are bringing the full amount of risk that we can take on, that are bringing all the tools that we have in our toolbox. And we use that sometimes when we're trying to think about how do we make money in new space. And sometimes people think that the path to net zero doesn't necessarily bring out the same focus and the same drive on those solutions that we used to drive revenue with our clients. And I think we need all of those same tools. We need the tools that allow solar financing to become extremely risk reduced and extremely attracted to capital...\n\nJonathan:\n\nWe need everything else that we can, for all of these solutions, not just on the green side, but also on those that are going to drive the transition. And so I think if we get that right, it allows us to compete. It allows us to compete for that global, multi-trillion dollar per year financing goal of, how do we as Canada or our clients more broadly across the footprint, think about their role and tools like this. Wherever we can find them, are invaluable for our ability to really drive this forward as fast as possible.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nWell, I think we've done a good job trying to bring this to life. Why don't I change up the pace of it? Let's go for some rapid fire questions. So, some real quick answers to these. Analysis suggested some 120 trillion is required through 2050 to shift the global economy's energy production to a no carbon emission source. Does the scale of that challenge represent a risk or an opportunity or both? Jonathan, you go first.\n\nJonathan:\n\nI'll say both. I really think the real challenge is that if we don't hit the pace on it. The number compounds, you need both reduction and then resilience. You need to solve for, “How are we going to emit less carbon? But also, if we let enough carbon be emitted, we got to solve for, “How are we going to deal with rising sea levels, temperature changes, more adverse weather events, and making all of our infrastructure resilient to those changes?”\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nJustine.\n\nJustine:\n\nSo, Jonathan, I think took the words right out of my mouth Dan, is definitely both. And maybe what I add to that, but I'm used to Jonathan doing that. I would add to that too, is some of the new technologies that we have to test out, there're some lots of learning that we have to do, right? I think back of pre COVID and how quickly we accelerated some of the science, right? To get these vaccines, to immunize us. I see this analogy applying here where we definitely have to accelerate fast. So, what comes with that also is some risks. So, our ability to actually learn along the way and adjust and demonstrate a lot of agility, I think is definitely going to help to manage and have the right balance between the risk and the opportunity that I believe again, is for Canada to go and seize its share.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nOkay, second rapid fire. Justine, you're going to go first. Why is it important for our company BMO as a bank and EDC as a crown corporation focus and experts to work together?\n\nJustine:\n\nIf I think about it, Dan, exporting for me is the equivalent from a country's point of view to economic prosperity. It certainly has a big feeder into it. So, we know the challenges historical, as you said, we also I think, talked about the uniqueness of our own economy. So, we need to solve for our problems and being able to solve it in partnership and through collaboration is what is required. So, I think the combination of being able to bring our know-how to the rest of the world while we solve our own problems is a mark and the ability of us to do that faster and faster, I think will allow us to transition our own economy and do our contribution. And then certainly at the same time contribute to those that could really appreciate the know-how we bring to the table and the approach by often, which we tackle some of these big challenges.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nOkay. Jonathan.\n\nJonathan:\n\nSo, I'll echo that. I think Justine took most of the words in my mouth. So, I'll just try and sum it up though. I think the answer for both why it works for us and why it works for Canada is scale. We, as organizations are approaching what feels like a massive problem and doing this together allows us to operate with a greater scale, be able to take on risks and pursue the opportunity in a different way. And I think that's also why this poses such a great opportunity for Canada and their clients that are exporting, which is, if we try and solve this just inside Canada, there's a target addressable market for each of these companies, it could become limited. It could actually make the economics more challenging. But if we give them access to the ability to take their solutions, bring them up around the world, we really can give them a scale that they can address that allows them to really achieve something much greater and to get to a level of economics, some of these solutions that might bring different outcomes to the market.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nWell, for our listeners benefit, I'm a really simple person. When we collaborate, we get to one plus one equals three and it creates new opportunities and new abilities. And I love the fact, we put this together. Final closing question. What gives you optimism about the energy transition? Justine?\n\nJustine:\n\nI could agree with you more Dan. And I guess for me, I was trying to think of one word, right? And for me, the word is momentum. Your one plus one equals three, I think is fantastic. And you can just see those trios accelerating and becoming more common to the stories we're hearing in the market. So, our ability to be able to play our part in that and do it in collaboration with a partner like BMO is what gives me huge optimism. And also the fact that I think Canada has a longstanding history in terms of innovation and the energy sector and many others. So, it's a real opportunity for us to go and seize and it's really cool to see the different industries coming together on this.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nAnd Jonathan.\n\nJonathan:\n\nFor me, it's really that we are seeing that speed part of the adoption curve. We've seen so many companies looking and saying, this is something I need to address. Not just for myself, but for the economy at large. And that's where I think it really gives me optimism that what could have felt pretty lonely and solitary a couple of years ago, really does feel like we're working with the entire economy to solve a really big problem and able to draw in tools like this with partners that are thinking about it and really drive forward a pace that I think is really encouraging.\n\nDan Barclay:\n\nSo, that's, a wrap. Jonathan and Justin, thank you very much. I think you've brought together something very innovative, very thoughtful, and I'm looking forward to great things from this collaboration. It's great to see us working together as two very strong and powerful institutions in Canada to bring Canadian knowledge and innovation to the world. Thanks for the efforts you put into this. And I can't wait to see the output from this collaboration. That's all for this week's podcast. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate our listeners and we appreciate you tying into what is a very important, innovative moment, as we look forward on energy transition.

But I would say it is also a challenge because it implies a cultural shift in the company that traditionally we've gone to human engineered solutions to our problems or to our challenges, and now it's working with people at all levels of the organization to help them think more broadly as to whether nature can help us in the challenges that we're facing.\n\nMichael Torrance:\n\nWelcome to Sustainability Leaders. I'm Michael Torrance, Chief Sustainability Officer with BMO Financial Group. On the show, we will talk with leading sustainability practitioners from the corporate, investor, academic, and NGO communities to explore how this rapidly evolving field of sustainability is impacting global investment business practices in our world.\n\nSpeaker 3:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the participants and not those of Bank of Montreal, its affiliates, or subsidiaries.\n\nAlice Bao:\n\nToday, we're talking about becoming nature positive in the mining sector. I'm Alice Bao, part of the sustainability office at BMO focused on disclosure and impact. I'm joined by Magali Gable, Director of Sustainable Finance at BMO, and Carleigh Whitman, Head of Nature and Closure at Teck Resources. Carleigh is an environmental lawyer with over 20 years of experience in advisory, corporate, and site-based roles in Canada and Chile. Carleigh is a senior deputy in the World Economic Forums, Champions for Nature, and a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals Nature Enclosure Working Groups. The final task force on nature related financial disclosure recommendations where TNFD were launched in September 2023. And many of us are interested to learn from companies on how they're incorporating nature into their decision making and how they operate, engage with communities, measure and monitor their impacts, and manage risks and opportunities. So we're pleased to have you Carleigh.\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nI'm glad to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nAlice Bao:\n\nFirst off, can you introduce our listeners to Teck Resources?\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nWell to start, for those who aren't familiar with Teck, we're a leading Canadian mining company focused on providing products that are essential for a better quality of life for people around the world.\n\nAlice Bao:\n\nThe mining sector has been managing its biodiversity impacts as part of its operations and permitting process for a long time. Can you start by telling us the intersection between the mining sector and nature? Has the release of the TNFD changed how the mining sector manages its biodiversity impacts?\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nMining is a sector that both directly impacts and depends on land and ecosystem services that provides in our operations and through our value chains. At Teck, our operations are within areas of high biodiversity value and we're committed to responsibly managing biodiversity reclamation and closure and working towards securing a net positive impact on biodiversity and nature positive by 2030. And so when you ask about the TNFD, and that's something that we piloted this year, and we think that this framework will guide ours and other sectors of the economy in better understanding the risks associated with nature.\n\nAlice Bao:\n\nThat's great to hear. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework that was adopted in December 2022 serves as the world's framework for actions to safeguard and restore biodiversity under 23 targets to be achieved by 2030. What does the global biodiversity framework mean for the mining sector or for Teck?\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nWell, there, as you mentioned, a lot of targets and a lot of them do have relevance to the mining sector, but the one in particular I'd like to highlight is called Target 15, which directs governments to take measures to encourage and enable business to monitor, assess and disclose risks and dependencies and impacts on biodiversity. So similar to Teck's own goals, this approach is aiming to progressively reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, increase positive impacts, and reduce biodiversity related risks to businesses and financial institutions. And so we're expecting that as governments begin to regulate the global biodiversity framework into domestic legislation, that we will see some of these targets come into our own requirements and not just being individual companies having aspirational goals to achieve this.\n\nAlice Bao:\n\nIt's very clear that the mining sector has a unique role to play in supporting a nature positive agenda. What are similarities and differences between these requirements and the TNFD'S recommendations and also the requirements from the EU's CSRD?\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nI think for mining, because the sector has such a direct impact on land and water, most of our regulatory frameworks already address this. So from a direct impact perspective, it's similar in both. I think the emerging requirements are going to place more emphasis on landscape level approaches, though some of our permits do cover cumulative effects. That's not in every jurisdiction. So I think we'll see more emphasis placed on that. Also, really on value chain transparency and action and systems level transformation.\n\nAlice Bao:\n\nThank you for setting the broader context Carleigh. I'll now turn it to Magali, the energy and natural resources specialist in the sustainable finance team.\n\nMagali Gable:\n\nThank you Alice. Biodiversity has showed up the agenda in our conversation with market participant and mining and metal's role in delivering another positive future was discussed most recently at Davos. Biodiversity is one of Teck's eight strategic sustainability themes, and recently the company announced its goal of becoming a natural positive company by 2030. Carleigh, could you talk about Teck's approach to nature and the company's biodiversity ambition?\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nThanks Magali. And as you mentioned, we did set a goal to work towards a net positive impact on biodiversity. We did that in 2011, so we've had some experience under our belt of what works and what doesn't and what's more challenging than we might've initially thought. And that net positive impact or NPI goal is something we're working to achieve over the life of each of our minds. So that could be decades in many cases.\n\nAnd so as you mentioned in 2022, we updated this to include a nature positive goal for this decade, which is to contribute to the global goal of halting and reversing nature loss by 2030. And so really for us, we define that as being by 2030, that our conservation, protection and restoration of land and biodiversity will exceed the disturbance caused by our mining activities from a 2020 baseline. And so we're taking action in three focused areas to do this. The first is nature positive decision-making guided by science and indigenous knowledge, rehabilitation excellence and conservation protection and restoration through partnerships. And we're working to achieve this through conserving or rehabilitating at least three hectares for every one hectare affected by our mining activities. And since we made our announcement last June, we've protected and conserved more than 51,000 hectares of land, including the globally rare inland temperate rainforest of the Incomappleux Valley in southeastern British Columbia with the Nature Conservancy of Canada.\n\nMagali Gable:\n\nThis is quite a comprehensive multifaceted strategy toward the road to nature positive. Transitioning to on the ground experience, as you mentioned, Teck has been doing conservation and restoration works for a while. Perhaps, can you provide examples of what Teck is doing to achieve its goal and the challenges you have or may face along the way?\n\nCarleigh Whitman:\n\nSure. So as a mining company, we are legally required to undertake restoration work at our mine sites. And so that's been a lot of our historic experience. But one of the things that we're looking to do more of now is seeking to partner in offsite initiatives that are close to our operations. For example, we've partnered with Trout Unlimited Canada to participate in environment and climate change, Canada's conservation exchange pilot with a project near Hinton, Alberta. And this is a watershed scale restoration project that is addressing stream health degradation at high priority sites, both improving and protecting spawning and rearing habitat for bull trout and Athabasca rainbow trout. It's important to recognize that before we commence restoration work or offsite work like this, that we're following the mitigation hierarchy of avoiding our impacts, minimizing them when possible, then restoring and then offsetting, which is offsite work if necessary.\n\nCertainly it's an ongoing challenge to continue to look at opportunities to minimize impacts, which can be trickier to do than things offsite. So that is the reason that there is a mitigation hierarchy, so we try very hard to follow that hierarchy. Another thing that we've been working on are nature-based solutions. So these are approaches to challenges that harness the power of nature complimentary to human engineered solutions. So for example, restoring wetland habitat can provide natural flood mitigation, which benefits nature and our operations. And as part of our nature positive decision-making mindset, we are seeking to integrate more nature-based solutions into all phases of mine life from exploration through operations and into closure. But I would say it is also a challenge because it implies a cultural shift in the company that traditionally we've gone to human engineered solutions to our problems or to our challenges, and now it's working with people at all levels of the organization to help them think more broadly as to whether nature can help us and the challenges that we're facing.\n\nMagali Gable:\n\nMm-hmm. It's a real paradigm shift in how nations, businesses, and investors view nature. Carleigh, I would like to come back to your po"
