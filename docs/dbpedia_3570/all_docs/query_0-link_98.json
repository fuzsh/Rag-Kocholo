        "text": "ATUALIDADES !!!\n\nNotícias de interesse sobre a Aviação de Caça!\n\nExpanding Commercial Refueling Services Concern Transcom Chief\n\nAviation Week - Steve Trimble April 24, 2024\n\nCLEVELAND—The head of U.S. Transportation Command (Transcom) said April 24 that she has concerns about expanding the use of commercial air refueling services as a nascent industry competition attempts to draw significantly more business from the U.S. Air Force.\n\nIn remarks to the Aerial Refueling Systems Advisory Group, Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost endorsed the U.S. Navy’s current use of commercial air refueling companies, such as Omega and Metrea, for completing carrier qualifications of fighter squadrons ahead of deployments, and for training inexperienced, “baby” Air Force fighter pilots before they need to be refueled over water.\n\nBut the prospect of scaling up the use of contracted refueling services could hinder Air Mobility Command’s ability to complete proficiency and combat training among the command’s boom operators and air refueling pilots amidst limited flight hours, Van Ovost said. Congress mandates that the Air Force keeps a minimum fleet of 466 air refueling aircraft.\n\n“The concern I have is the 466 ‘tails’ that we have and the crew ratio that we have and all of them need to get trained,” Van Ovost said. “And they need to get training out in relevant areas. That means [they need to be] forward against weapon systems that they’re going to be refueling in flight so we can practice.”\n\nAir Mobility Command has fewer flight hours than Van Ovost prefers to maintain proficiency levels.\n\n“So as I push the Air Force to get us more flight hours for training, my concern is that they’re making that trade-off [with more use of contractors]. And that’s what I don’t want to happen,” Van Ovost said.\n\nThe nature of future conflict could also limit how the Air Force relies on commercial air refueling operators in wartime, she added.\n\nContractors would not be deployed into conflict zones, she said. But the homeland itself could be targeted for a modern enemy.\n\n“If we think about that, the homeland is no longer a sanctuary,” Van Ovost said. “Then what does that mean for your ability to even refuel off the West Coast or the East Coast? Think about the cyberattacks, [or] the FAA going down. Remember, we just had a radar outage in the Northwest, everybody was down. Right? That’s just us. That’s not even an adversary that’s trying to get after you.”\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSteve covers military aviation, missiles and space for the Aviation Week Network, based in Washington DC.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/defense-space/multi-mission-aircraft/expanding-commercial-refueling-services-concern-transcom-chief\n\nU.S. Navy Grounds T-45s After Two Engine Malfunctions In Less Than Month\n\nAviation Week - Brian Everstine April 19, 2024\n\nA T-45C Goshawk engine malfunction on April 12 has caused the U.S. Navy to pause flight operations of the type—the second mishap for the trainer in less than a month.\n\nThe incident, which required a precautionary landing at Hesler-Noble Field in Laurel, Mississippi, raises the fiscal 2024 tally of Navy Class A aviation mishaps to nine. This is one more than the total for all of fiscal 2023.\n\nNaval Air Forces said in a statement that the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) is investigating the incident, while Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is spearheading an engineering investigation. Meanwhile, flights have been paused “out of an abundance of caution” while the commands assess the fleet’s ability to resume flying.\n\nThe April 12 incident, first reported by USNI News, follows a March 18 incident in which a T-45C experienced an engine malfunction on takeoff at NAS Meridian, Mississippi, requiring a high-speed abort. Naval Air Forces and NAVAIR have not directly connected the causes of the mishaps, though both are malfunctions of the T-45’s Rolls-Royce Adour engine.\n\nThe T-45 fleet in recent years has seen repeated problems with the Adour. In October 2022, a compressor blade shot through an engine at NAS Kingsville, Texas, prompting the service to ground the fleet for 4 1/2 months.\n\nThe engine problems and grounding sparked a backlog in training, as CNATRA reported a backlog of about 1,000 pilots in 2023.\n\nThe increase in mishaps this year comes after the service had seen a drop in recent years. For example, fiscal 2023’s total was half of the 16 reported aviation mishaps in 2022.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

It currently provides aircrews and personnel to NATO’s Germany-based Boeing E-3 Sentry force, and the Canadian Armed Forces routinely work with U.S. Air Force E-3s in North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) operations. Depending on when the acquisition takes place, Canada could well look at the E-7 to align with NATO and its Five Eyes partners as the platform is already in service with Australia and being purchased by the UK and U.S. But there is also the parStially homegrown GlobalEye option using locally manufactured Bombardier Global business jets modified with Saab’s Erieye ER airborne radar.\n\nThe Our North Strong and Free vision also outlined plans to purchase new tactical helicopters, new satellite communications systems, and long-range strike capabilities for the army.\n\nBut critics said the plans only commit to exploring new capabilities rather than funding them, while the burden of increased spending has been placed on future administrations over the next 20 years.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, insisted that the new policy was merely a starting point and there was more to come in terms of spending plans.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTony Osborne\n\nBased in London, Tony covers European defense programs.

Human ‘Dogfights’ Show Progression Of Autonomy Tests\n\nAviation Week - Brian Everstine April 22, 2024\n\nThe U.S. Air Force’s progression to fielding large numbers of uncrewed autonomous aircraft to fight alongside crewed fighters faces a series of major hurdles including basic technological readiness, industry’s ability to build the systems at scale and figuring out how they can be integrated into military operations.\n\nBut before all of that, the service has to figure out one key problem: How can autonomy software be effectively tested?\n\n“There’s no current pathway for machine learning control of aircraft, whether in military or civil air,” says Col. James Valpiani, commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. “And I think that’s very important when we consider the challenge that we’re facing. We really have a lot of basic science and engineering questions to answer.”\n\nTo answer some of these questions, the service has been relying on the X-62 Variable In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA)—the dramatically orange, blue and white F-16D that has been modified to on board different autonomy software packages to be evaluated in live flight. For the past two years, the F-16 has been regularly flying at Edwards AFB, California, to test the software in increasingly complex scenarios. This includes live “dogfights” between it and another F-16 starting in September 2023.\n\nThe flights are conducted by the Test Pilot School and DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, the latter of which also conducted the 2020 “AlphaDogFight” event that pitted a human pilot against autonomy in a simulated fight. During that event, the artificial intelligence (AI) programs were given full situational awareness while the human relied on visually identifying the enemy aircraft, and AI swept the fights.\n\nFor the VISTA evaluations, both the X-62A and the competing F-16 were outfitted with Secure Live Virtual Constructive Advanced Training Environment (Slate) pods for tracking. The two aircraft were connected with a data link to provide full situational awareness of where each other were in the airspace.\n\nLt. Col. Ryan Hefron, DARPA’s ACE program manager, said the full situational awareness was “really part of doing this in a safe and responsible way, take it one step at a time, to truly understand how each aspect works before moving on to the next problem.”\n\nDuring the flights, the aircraft maneuvered close to each other—to within 2,000 ft. and up to 1,200 mph, including with vertical maneuvers and passes nose to nose.\n\n“The incremental buildup is really the hallmark of tests,” Valpiani says. “We want to isolate variables, understand how the aircraft performs, with an understanding of all of the other contexts, and then slowly open up the envelope of things that we’re testing. And so to have an aircraft that receives perfect Slate data, still there are many things that we learned.”\n\nAs the one-versus-one flights continue, DARPA and the Test Pilot School are looking to build more confidence in the autonomy to get to multiship flights in which crewed and uncrewed aircraft collaborate.\n\nSo far, VISTA has evaluated software from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s AI Accelerator, the Air Force Research Lab and companies involved in ACE—EpiSci, Shield AI, Physics AI and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. To show confidence in the program, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall says he will fly in the VISTA in the coming weeks.\n\nBut VISTA will remain without targeting systems, so its contribution to future Collaborative Combat Aircraft will be limited. Air Force officials have said the first increment of the CCA program will focus on having uncrewed aircraft provide weapons for suppression of enemy air defenses. To pursue this, the Air Force is standing up a unit at Eglin AFB, Florida, called the Viper Experimentation and Next-gen Operations Model-Autonomy Flying Testbed program (Venom-AFT). This will feature three F-16s similarly modified to fly with autonomy software and will have sensors to start training for weapons engagements.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

That incident, involving an Air Force CV-22 off the coast of Japan in which eight airmen died, has been linked to a material failure though no root cause has been identified.\n\nFollowing the clearance, officials from each service said they would follow a deliberate return-to-flight process including refresher training and increased maintenance. At the time, officials said the process could take months.\n\nSince the announcement, the Marine Corps has returned its V-22s to extensive operations, including presidential support. The service announced April 16 that its Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 268 was deploying to Australia. On April 13, the Marines posted photos of Ospreys conducting night operations aboard the USS New York as it was underway in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Navy in early April also returned its CMV-22Bs to its ships, with photographs showing operations aboard the USS Wasp in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHowever, no Air Force CV-22s have returned to flight yet.\n\n“The AFSOC CV-22 fleet is executing the deliberate return to flight process,” Air Force Special Operations Command said in a statement. “This process includes simulator training for our CV-22 aircrew, maintenance inspections of our CV-22 aircraft, and a review of each aircraft’s maintenance records as prescribed by the Joint Program Office. As each aircraft is cleared, our aircrew will immediately commence flight operations.”\n\nThe situation came up in an April 17 House Armed Services Committee hearing, where top Air Force officials told lawmakers that the command has a slower process to return its aircraft to flight compared to the Marines and Navy.\n\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall says there has been a “very thoughtful, thorough process in place.” AFSOC is looking at each aircraft individually before clearing them to fly, while “the other services are moving forward more quickly.”\n\nChief of Staff Gen. David Allvin added that the CV-22 fleet of aircraft are dedicated to special operations, which means they operate in a different way and in harsher conditions than the other services. This means more complex challenges for both the aircraft and the aircrew.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

During a House Armed Services Committee hearing on April 17, Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) asked Kendall if the Air Force is talking with other nations, including NATO partners or other treaty allies, to see if there is interest in receiving the aircraft.\n\nKendall said he currently is not aware of active discussions, though “one country at least has expressed some interest.”\n\nHowever, once it is out of the U.S. inventory, there “won’t be any base of support for it, so any country that picked it up and tried to sustain it would have a very hard time. It’s also a very old aircraft.”\n\nKendall did not disclose the nation, though he identified one that has not expressed much interest: Ukraine. While Kyiv will soon receive American-made F-16s, the nation “rightfully would be concerned about their survivability,” Kendall says.\n\nScott urged the Air Force to meet with like-minded allies to take on some aircraft as it continues divestments.\n\n“We’d be happy to have those conversations. We do transfer excess defense articles,” Kendall says, pointing to recent transfers of C-130s to the Philippines.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

Pilots Disagree On Right Approach, Part 3\n\nAviation Week - Roger Cox April 18, 2024\n\nThe Sierra West Dassault Falcon 20, registered as N283SA, was manufactured in 1967 and last inspected 12 days before the October 2021 crash in Thomson, Georgia. Both engines had recently been removed for maintenance and had only operated for 12 hours before the accident. At its estimated landing weight of 20,280 lb., the appropriate reference speed for landing at Thomson-McDuffie County Airport (HQU) was 113 kts. The minimum field length required was 3,975 ft.\n\nAccording to the Fan Jet Falcon 20 Aircraft Operating Manual, the speed brakes had two positions—retracted (IN) and extended (EXT). An Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) limitation specified that speed brakes cannot be extended when flaps are deployed on approach, except when anti-ice is in use. In that event, they must be retracted no later than 500 ft. above the ground. The temperature at Thompson at 0530 was 20 deg. C, so icing was not a factor on the approach.\n\nThe NTSB performance engineer used ADS-B data from the FAA to plot the jet’s trajectory. Her report showed graphically how the Falcon 20 swung wide left of the localizer, then turned back to intercept it. The airspeed gradually decreased from 168 kts at CEDAR to 137 kts at 400 ft AGL. She calculated the stall speed in the final configuration to be 89 kts at flaps 40, and even with partial flaps and deployed speed brakes, that would not cause the stall warning to sound. Most likely, the warning sounded because the pilots pulled back abruptly on the controls just before collision with the trees.\n\nA performance graphic integrated the captain’s comments with the jet’s final trajectory. In the last two minutes of flight, the captain made eight comments but did not attempt to take control to correct the errant flight path.\n\nThe 73-year-old captain lived in Arizona, 447 highway miles from El Paso. His wife said in an interview that he was accustomed to driving that route, and he had done so on Saturday, Sept. 26. He stayed at a company-provided hotel near the El Paso airport. He told her he did not expect to fly on the night of Oct. 4, due to maintenance issues with the jet. He texted her later during the flight, saying the crew was flying through thunderstorms and icing. She said he had a very good relationship with the first officer (FO) and was glad he was assigned to fly with him.\n\nThe captain had 11,955 hr. and an ATP certificate with type ratings for the Boeing 737, British Aerospace Jetstream 3100, DC-3, DC-8, and Embraer EMB-110 as well as the DA-20. He also had a glider rating. His last first class medical exam was on Jan. 5, 2021. He had worked for Ameristar Jetcharter before working for Sierra West. He had several training deficiencies in recent years, including check ride failures in 2017, 2019 and 2021. He had trouble with steep turns, circling approaches, and landings.\n\nThe FO was 63, had 4,748 hr. and held a commercial certificate with type ratings on the DA-20, Learjet 60, LR-JET series, and Swearingen SA-227. His most recent second-class medical certificate was issued on March 10, 2021. He had trouble with unusual attitudes on a 2019 check ride and was graded “SIC only” on a 2020 check ride. Company officials said he lacked the necessary performance, airmanship, and aeronautical decision making to be promoted to captain.\n\nIn an interview, a long-time friend of the first officer said she had talked and texted with him the night of the accident. She said he was accustomed to asking her, “please pray for me,” and he texted this to her while he was in storms during the accident flight.\n\nWhile the night flight was inherently more fatiguing than a comparable daytime flight, neither pilot said anything about being tired. The flight times and duty day were well within the limitations set by 14 CFR 135.267. That rule requires that each pilot must have had at least 10 consecutive hours of sleep opportunity and less than 14 hr. of on-call duty or 10 hr. of flight time.\n\nConclusions and Comments\n\nAmong the many errors the Falcon 20 crew made during the last 40 minutes of flight, the most egregious was deploying the speed brakes when the gear and flaps were already extended and the power was at idle. This was prohibited by the AFM and created an unrecoverable high drag condition.\n\nThe NTSB said as much. The primary probable cause was “the flight crew’s continuation of an unstable dark night visual approach and the captain’s instruction to use air brakes during the approach contrary to jet’s operating limitations, which resulted in a descent below the glide path and a collision with terrain.”\n\nThe captain was subject to further criticism. “Contributing to the accident was the captain’s poor crew resource management (CRM) and failure to take over pilot flying responsibilities after the first officer repeatedly demonstrated deficiencies in flying the airplane.” The captain’s refusal to take control and either stabilize the approach or divert to a more manageable airport is inexplicable.\n\nFinally, the NTSB put in a word for safety management systems (SMS). “(Contributing) was the operator’s lack of a safety management system and flight data monitoring program to proactively identify procedural non-compliance and unstable approaches.” The Sierra West director of operations said that an SMS program was under development.\n\nThe behavior of this crew brought to mind the guidance in AC120-51E, “Crew Resource Management.” It says “SOPs (standard operating procedures) define the shared mental model upon which good crew performance depends. Too often, well-established SOPs have been unconsciously ignored by pilots and others; in other cases, they have been consciously ignored.” The Sierra West pilots ignored checklists, briefings, callouts, instrument procedures and stabilized approach criteria. To them, SOPs didn’t exist.\n\nThe advisory circular also says: “CRM training should instruct crew members how to behave in ways that foster crew effectiveness.” Sierra West Flight 887 might well become one of the best examples of what happens when CRM training doesn’t work.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nRoger Cox\n\nA former military, corporate and airline pilot, Roger Cox was also a senior investigator at the NTSB.

Tehran made little effort to achieve surprise, lacked or withheld forces to suppress or destroy interception attempts downrange and employed a diverse mix of long-range weapons that fell short of state-of-the-art technology. All of these points appeared to be conceded by Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA).\n\n“This one was a little different, maybe, over the weekend, as far as foreshadowing and difficulty,” Collins said in an April 16 keynote speech at the Missile Defense Conference hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association.\n\nBut the Iranian barrage—involving more than 170 attack drones, over 100 ballistic missiles and at least 30 cruise missiles—was not an isolated event. And the scale and duration of modern campaigns are driving U.S. officials to search for new ideas, with a focus on a less expensive and more integrated architecture.\n\nSince 2022, an improvised Ukrainian air and missile defense complex has struggled with ammunition shortages and interoperability issues between inherited Soviet and donated Western systems. But even that piecemeal defensive complex—including a new low-cost, front-line layer—has frustrated Russia’s military goals in its a two-year blitz on Ukraine that included more than 8,000 missiles and 4,600 attack drones through February.\n\nIn the Middle East, meanwhile, a coalition of Israeli, American and European systems have fought off more than 60 anti-ship ballistic missile and drone attacks by the Houthis since October. The attacks have succeeded in disrupting commercial shipping through the Red Sea, but damage to maritime targets has been limited, with the sinking of a single cargo vessel, the Belize-registered Rubymar container ship, on March 2, according to U.S. Central Command.\n\nMore worrisome is that missile attacks continue to evolve in quantity and diversity with each salvo, combining air and missile threats in ways designed to overload a defender’s capacity for ammunition, sensing and decision-making.\n\n“It is getting worse,” Collins said. “When they really want to make it tough on us, they can make it tough on us. And we have got to be prepared for a level of capability and capacity that we haven’t even seen yet today.”\n\nIsrael defeated Iran’s April 14 mass assault with volume of its own. An international coalition of fighters shot down all of the attack drones before they reached Israeli territory. By eliminating these slow-moving threats, Israel’s command-and-control system could focus on an Iranian volley of medium-range ballistic missiles, with a handful of interceptions contributed by a U.S. Army Patriot battery in Iraq and U.S. Navy ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAn unspoken concern is the volume and sophistication of China’s missile arsenal. The U.S. military estimates the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force alone has fielded more than 3,000 ground-launched missiles as well as additional inventories of air- and sea-launched threats. Such concerns have driven urgent plans to install a multilayer defensive complex on Guam, the island U.S. territory within 1,500 nm of Taiwan. In addition to mass and missile diversity, the challenges for Guam include fending off threats from all directions.\n\nThe scale of such a challenge raises new concerns, especially as U.S. officials review the record of recent air and missile defense efforts in Ukraine and the Middle East—as well as fundamental assumptions about the feasibility of a prolonged defensive campaign.\n\nFor example, U.S. Navy ships have fired more than $1 billion worth of defensive interceptors in the Red Sea since October, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee on April 16. The value of the defended assets—warships and commercial shipping—justifies the use. But the cost-exchange ratio of firing, say, a $7.8 million Raytheon SM-6 at cheap Houthi attack drones and missiles is problematic in the long term.\n\nJohn Plumb, assistant defense secretary for space policy, faulted the current U.S. air and missile defense architecture in his address to the missile defense conference on April 16. The most expensive interceptors are launched at targets first. If any missiles survive, they face shootdown attempts by cheaper alternatives, including machine gun options, such as the Raytheon Phalanx Close-In Weapon System.\n\n“We roughly have that backwards, the way we’re doing it,” Plumb said.\n\nA desperate battlefield innovation by Ukraine’s military showed another path is feasible, he noted. Facing chronic shortages of the most advanced interceptors supplied by Western partners, the country has adapted. Its most expensive surface-to-air missiles are positioned near the most sensitive targets deep behind the front lines, such as Kyiv, Plumb said. In forward areas, Ukraine has constructed a much less expensive alternative. Ground-based acoustic sensors, including cell phones, detect Russian attack drones and low-flying cruise missiles. Those sensors are networked to central command centers, which cue a network of Phalanx-style machine guns to track and shoot down the targets. That preserves the more expensive interceptors to attack only the weapons that leak through.\n\n“You want the first layer as pickets and to let the pickets have the cheapest shots,” Plumb said. “Then you want to see your most exquisite interceptors with the highest cost for leakers.”\n\nSuch an architecture is desirable but not easy. In addition to one-way attack drones and subsonic cruise missiles, China has stockpiles of advanced weapons—including maneuvering, hypersonic glide vehicles and cruise missiles—and nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of deploying fractional orbital bombardment systems. The least expensive defenses often lack the speed, range and firepower necessary to shoot down such weapons.\n\n“This kind of layered defense in depth is hard,” Plumb said. “And it’s even harder . . . if maybe the cheapest stuff doesn’t have the legs.”\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Trimble\n\nSteve covers military aviation, missiles and space for the Aviation Week Network, based in Washington DC.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/defense-space/missile-defense-weapons/irans-attack-israel-foiled-missile-defense-challenge-grows\n\nIs A Third European Next-Generation Fighter Project In The Offing?\n\nAviation Week - Tony Osborne April 04, 2024\n\nHaving awarded Saab and GKN Aerospace contracts for initial future combat aircraft studies, the Swedish government could be firing the starting pistol on yet another such program for Europe.\n\nWith Stockholm eager to preserve its national fighter development capability—and since neither the French, German and Spanish Future Combat Air System (FCAS) nor the Italian, Japanese and UK Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) quite fit its needs—Sweden has launched an effort to work out its next steps.\n\nThe Vagval Stridsflyg project—literally “choice of path for combat aircraft”—aims to help the country’s leaders decide by 2030 whether to pursue future combat aircraft development for the 2040s and beyond. The studies aim to develop and mature technologies and pave the way for ground-based and flying demonstrators.\n\nSweden is modernizing its fleets with the new-generation Saab Gripen E, which will likely operate well into the 2040s, and plans to extend the lives of earlier Gripen C/Ds to keep them in service into the 2030s.\n\nSaab says it will explore both crewed and uncrewed concepts, while GKN Aerospace, which builds the GE Aerospace engines powering both Gripen types, will look at advanced power and propulsion system options for a future platform.\n\nGiven that Sweden’s commanders plan to continue the doctrine of operating from dispersed bases and road runways in wartime—despite the country’s entry into NATO—the future platform will have to meet the demands of operating from shorter strips and be easy to maintain in an austere environment.\n\nOptions could include buying yet more Gripens and spurring development of collaborative combat aircraft to add mass to the existing Gripen fleet. The studies could also drive the need for a more advanced fighter to deal with new regional threats.\n\n“These [studies] are an important step to clarify technology choices and commercial action options before decisions on how the future combat aviation capabilities are to be supplied,” says Lars Helmrich, director of air and space systems at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration, which contracted the studies. “Considering the long development times and the decisions that need to be made, it is good that the work starts now.”\n\nSweden had been linked to the UK-led Tempest FCAS, which has evolved into GCAP. Neither the timelines nor the aircraft expected to emerge from FCAS and GCAP would fit Swedish needs, and they would not meet its aim of preserving national combat aircraft development, either.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTony Osborne\n\nBased in London, Tony covers European defense programs.

The total included more than 100 medium-range ballistic missiles, more than 30 land-attack cruise missiles and more than 170 attack drones. The vast majority of the threats, particularly the ballistic missiles, were defeated by Israeli forces.\n\nThree senior U.S. officials, in an April 14 briefing, outlined the American response. Boeing F-15Es from the 494th and 335th Fighter Squadrons shot down more than 70 of the drones, along with participation by Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nThe guided-missile destroyers USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) and USS Carney (DDG-64) shot down between four and six ballistic missiles. Additionally, a U.S. Army Patriot battery near Erbil, Iraq, shot down one ballistic missile.\n\nU.S. Central Command and U.S. European Command surged forces to the region ahead of the anticipated attack. This included the deployment of an additional guided-missile destroyer which was approved by President Joe Biden on April 10. Senior defense and administration officials said the Iranian attack was in the “higher end” of what was anticipated.\n\nIsraeli officials released few operational details, but showed videos of F-35I, F-15E and F-16 aircraft and crews returning from air defense missions early on April 14. The Israeli fighters shot down all of the remaining attack drones before they entered Israeli airspace, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said.\n\nThe combined defensive efforts allowed only about 1% of the Iranian missile barrage to slip through, resulting in minor damage to infrastructure at Nevatim Air Base in the sparsely populated Negev Desert, the IDF spokesman said.\n\nBritish Defense Secretary Grant Schapps said in a social media statement that the UK surged additional Royal Air Force aircraft to the region ahead of the attack. These aircraft intercepted and destroyed multiple one-way attack drones, he said.\n\nA senior administration official also highlighted involvement by the French military, though no additional details have been released.\n\nThe Jordanian government, in an April 14 statement, said it targeted some of the drones and missiles as they entered the kingdom's airspace in an act of self defense.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Trimble in Washington contributed to this article.\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

The operation, first formed in 2020, focuses on sharing intelligence, planning of military operations and other efforts focused on safe operations in space.\n\nGen. Stephen Whiting, commander of U.S. Space Command, announced the invitations during a keynote speech here in Colorado Springs at the 2024 Space Symposium.\n\nWhiting, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the conference, says the three new nations are already working closely together. This includes in the Space Operations Center at Vandenberg SFB, California, and operations centers in France and Germany.\n\nFrance and Germany in particular have “a lot of their own space capability for national defense purposes, and we have very positive relationships with them,\" Whiting says. \"We’ve done some exercises together—we’ve done wargames.”\n\nNew Zealand is also a part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance, Whiting says.\n\n“They have been very interested in increasing their space capability. They have dedicated some of their personnel to support our joint commercial office where they help produce space domain awareness information that we then all use to tip and cue our military operations and our exquisite sensors that we use for military purposes,” he says.\n\nAlso on April 9, Whiting announced Spacecom has signed a new space situational awareness agreement with Uruguay. The command has more than 185 information sharing agreements with other nations, along with companies, academia and other intergovernmental organizations.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

It has established a task force, approved large-scale increases in retention bonuses and found ways to streamline pilot production to put more personnel into its cockpits.\n\nCome fiscal 2023, the shortage has largely stayed the same, at just under 2,000 pilots. The Air Force is continuing to try to convince pilots to stay in uniform, with renewed outreach that takes a long-term look at career pressures and which retention efforts are actually working. In the meantime, the service is prioritizing its operational and training units while making big reductions in areas such as testing.\n\n• The Air Force is prioritizing operational units, reducing staff roles\n\n• The Navy is spending more on T-45 readiness\n\n“We are listening to aircrews,” Lt. Gen. Adrian Spain, deputy chief of staff for operations and former director of training and readiness, tells Aviation Week. “We want their feedback. We are fighting for it at every opportunity we can, and we are demonstrably trying to meet them in a place that can help incentivize continued service within the confines and constructs they have for support networks, for their culture.”\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2023, the Air Force’s pilot shortage grew by 206 from the prior year to 1,848. The service blames increased post-COVID-19 airline hiring and a continuing underproduction in pilot training. Undergraduate pilot training production was stable at 1,300 for 2023, about 200 below a target rate of 1,500 per year.\n\nIn some ways, the situation has worsened because the Air Force cannot pinpoint the shortage to individual communities. In the early stages of the crisis, the service could produce mobility pilots faster than fighter pilots, giving tanker and airlift fleets more buffer space in staffing levels. It is all-encompassing today.\n\n“Most communities that we’re talking about have some stress that’s being applied to them,” Spain says.\n\nThe Air Force has rolled out various types of bonuses to keep aviators around, yet numbers remain stagnant. Legacy bonus contracts kept 291 pilots in service in fiscal 2023, compared with 285 in fiscal 2019. The service in 2023 launched a bonus demo program for early-career pilots, contracting 230 who had two years until their undergraduate pilot training active-duty service commitment expiration and 143 who had three years.\n\nThe Aircrew Crisis Task Force is reaching out directly in a new survey program targeting individual pilots instead of gathering anonymous responses. The first round of questions went out last year. It aims to focus not just on initial feedback but on years of continued engagement, Spain says. He explains that the goal is to “pinpoint things that are working, . . . not working and . . . not measurably making a difference.\n\n“We have one survey right now, and it’s going through the analysis phase,” he says. “But the method of this survey is different in the way that, over time, we can actually measure the change in the sentiment for individuals.”\n\nFor now, training and operational units are crewed at about 100%, while testing units are staffed at about 75%, and personnel is lower, though an exact percentage is not available. In February, the service took a dramatic step to try to alleviate the staff shortage, announcing a program to entice back retired officers.\n\nBeyond money, pilots have shared with headquarters concerns about their career paths that make leaving the service and taking an airline job more attractive. These largely focus on improved stability, predictability and flexibility in civilian career paths.\n\nOne concern seems basic on the surface but has been complicated to address: Pilots simply want to fly. The Air Force says it budgets flying hours to the maximum executable level, but with many aircraft aging and facing maintenance issues, the hours have been hard to achieve.\n\nConsider the Boeing F-15Es flown by the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The wing has ongoing maintenance issues with its aircraft, which are more than 30 years old. The base’s maintainers are doing great work, considering the circumstances, Wing Commander Col. Michael Alfaro tells Aviation Week. He says his guidance is to try to meet the mission-hour goal without breaking the wing’s jets or breaking the people. Aviation Week recently visited the 366th.\n\nWith older airframes, that can mean pilots expect to fly often but do not. They can repeatedly show up early at the operations desk, only to be told there are not enough working aircraft.\n\nAlfaro says that earlier in his career, it was normal to fly 15-20 times per month, including multiple times per day. Today’s Air Force often must play “shell games,” he notes, prioritizing a group one month to maintain currency, then having them essentially on probation for the next to give others a chance to fly.\n\n“We’re just barely getting the sorties across people,” he says. “The ones that need experience are not getting sorties, so that can be a little bit of a beatdown on morale.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Air Force is starting to chip away at what has become a major limiting factor in pilot production: the health of its Northrop T-38 Talon II trainer. The Talon uses General Electric J85 turbojet engines dating back to the early 1950s, and problems with those engines have decreased its mission-capable rates to the low 50% range, in turn lowering pilot output. Moreover, the powerplant is no longer in production, and StandardAero, the main contractor charged with maintenance, has struggled to source parts.\n\nIn response, the newly renamed Airman Development Command (ADC)—previously Air Education and Training Command—teamed with Air Force Materiel Command to develop a new plan to produce and refurbish parts in-house to feed into depot maintenance.\n\nCommander of the ADC, Lt. Gen. Brian S. Robinson, tells Aviation Week that this process has already yielded results in the past couple of months, helping a “better-quality engine to come out of depot maintenance.”\n\nIn addition, the Air Force has launched the broader Talon Repair Inspection and Maintenance program to inspect and repair critical structure areas. This is expected to replace nearly 200 primary structure components, including longerons, bulkheads and skins, and to inspect more than 150 other components.\n\nThese are all interim steps as the service awaits the delayed Boeing T-7A Red Hawk. The aircraft’s anticipated initial operational capability date has been pushed to 2028. Robinson says concerns over the T-7’s delayed timeline stem from having to put more resources into extending the T-38’s life, as the service prefers the safer, more capable and more advanced Red Hawk.\n\nPer the current T-38 syllabus, much of early training covers simply safe flight of the old aircraft and its unique characteristics, as opposed to military airmanship. The more advanced T-7 will allow the service to provide much improved training, Robinson says.\n\nBefore pilots fly the T-38—and eventually the T-7—they begin training in the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II turboprop. As the Talons have declined, the service has made limited changes to the T-6 initial training syllabus—focused on process, sustainment, manpower and airspace access—to raise the output of trained pilots. Robinson says these tweaks have increased production by 25% at Laughlin AFB, Texas, and will be scaled to other locations starting with Vance AFB, Oklahoma.\n\nThe U.S. Navy faces a similar pilot shortage, both in production and in keeping enough strike pilots in service. As with the Air Force’s T-38 issue, the Navy continues to grapple with engine troubles from its T-45 Goshawk trainer. As of late 2023, the pipeline had produced 80% of its overall goal, with about 1,000 students at a time waiting to begin pilot training—some waiting as long as 14 months.\n\nThe T-45 was grounded for 4.5 months starting in October 2022. That same year, the Navy started the Carrier Qualification Pilot Project. Under this program, pilots would not be required to land on a carrier before going to fleet replacement squadrons. As of August 2023, 32 pilots had completed the program, with positive initial results.\n\nThe Navy’s fiscal 2025 request calls for $158 million for the T-45, including a $38.9 million “engine surge” account to deal with powerplant problems, $64 million to address avionics obsolescence and $28 million for a life extension program. Beyond that, the service plans to proceed with a replacement called the Undergraduate Jet Training System, procurement of which is to start in 2026, although funding has yet to be outlined.\n\nNavy Secretary Carlos Del Toro says the funding and initial steps to address the T-45 have shown some results, sounding an optimistic note on addressing the overall shortfall. “Our pilot pipeline has come down dramatically,” he says. “I’m pretty excited about that.”\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

In an engagement which has now become legendary within the service, according to officials, battery commanders launched an undisclosed number of Patriots to intercept the incoming missiles, with one missile being launched every six seconds.\n\nThe engagement is one of several now being formally acknowledged by Air Defense Forces officials here at the World Defense Show in Riyadh.\n\nIn another incident, the same unit also engaged a ballistic missile that threatened commercial airline flights at Jazan Airport.\n\nThe Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces deployed numerous systems to the Yemeni border during the conflict with the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen to tackle the air defense threats. During the conflict, the Houthis were supplied with numerous ballistic and cruise missile systems as well as uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) that were launched against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Houthi attacks primarily targeted civilian areas and critical infrastructure.\n\nStatements by the Saudi-led coalition at the time, as well as by the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., said that Houthi rebels launched almost 400 ballistic missiles and more than 800 one-way attack UAS into Saudi Arabia between 2015 and 2022.\n\nOther incidents now being acknowledged by the service include the first hard-kill engagement of a one-way attack drone by the Chinese-supplied, truck-mounted Silent Hunter system using its onboard laser. The Air Defense Forces also engaged 31 one-way attack drones using the Rheinmetall Skyguard air defense gun system in a single day.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTony Osborne\n\nBased in London, Tony covers European defense programs.

(GA-ASI) MQ-9 Reaper drone on Nov. 8 as it flew over the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen. Houthis also shot down another MQ-9 and a GA-ASI MQ-1C Gray Eagle over Yemen in 2019.\n\nThe Houthis have previously shown off stocks of Qaher family of missiles. In 2020, the Center for Strategic and International Studies linked the Qaher series to reengineered Soviet V-755 surface-to-air missiles. The same report said Houthis may operate the 358 missile, a loitering munition capable of attacking aerial targets.\n\nFurther, the U.S. displayed a Houthi Sayyad-2C missile in November 2018 that was reportedly seized by Saudi Arabia. The latter is an Iranian missile derived from the U.S. SM-1 surface-to-air missile.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Trimble\n\nSteve covers military aviation, missiles and space for the Aviation Week Network, based in Washington DC.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/defense-space/missile-defense-weapons/us-forces-strike-houthi-surface-air-missile-launch\n\nMission Is Complete For First Powered Aircraft On Mars\n\nAviation Week - Irene Klotz February 01, 2024\n\nMars Perseverance rover scientists had hoped to dispatch NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter early this spring to Bright Angel, an outcrop of rock in the river inlet valley running into Jezero Crater, the site of an ancient lake.\n\n“This could be the first taste of crater rim rocks or sediments deposited within the channel. Either will be interesting to us because . . . these rocks are either the youngest sedimentary rocks we will see on the mission, or they could be the absolutely oldest rocks,”Perseverance Deputy Project Scientist Katie Stack Morgan tells Aviation Week.\n\n• Tech demo planned for 30 days lasted almost three years\n\n• Navigation system foiled by featureless terrain\n\n“I was looking forward to Ingenuity scouting these out in advance for us so that we would have a sense for what are we up against when we get over there, and what kind of approach do we want to take with the rover in terms of how we look at this outcrop?” she adds.\n\nHaving an aerial scout was not part of the plan for the ongoing Mars 2020 Perseverance science mission, which set out to search for signs of ancient microbial life on Mars and prepare rock and regolith samples for return to Earth.\n\nIngenuity flew on Mars for the first time on April 19, 2021. The helicopter climbed to an altitude of 10 ft., hovered and then landed on the planet’s surface. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS\n\nThe car-size rover landed via parachutes, retrorockets and a sky crane inside Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. Attached to its belly was the 4-lb. helicopter, Ingenuity, built by a small team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to demonstrate powered flight on Mars. Their Wright brothers moment occurred on April 19, 2021 (AW&ST April 19-May 2, 2021, p. 20).\n\n“We originally had a single logbook, hoping for one successful flight to be logged in that,” Ingenuity Project Manager Teddy Tzanetos says. “We now have a fully packed logbook—and a second volume. We never planned for such a long mission.”\n\nIngenuity’s last flight—a 32-sec. pop-up intended to get a fix on its location—occurred on Jan. 18, the third in a series over featureless terrain that challenged the helicopter’s navigation system. The terrain is believed to have been a key factor in the vehicle’s demise.\n\n“We didn’t design the [navigation] system to handle this kind of terrain,” Havard Grip, former Ingenuity chief pilot at JPL, told reporters on Jan. 25. “We now know this kind of terrain can be a trap for a system like this.”\n\nEngineers suspect one or more of Ingenuity’s thin blades struck the ground during descent and broke. Detailed flight data was not transmitted due to a communications cutoff during descent and subsequent power brownout.\n\nThe assessment comes from analysis of photographs taken after the helicopter landed and communications were restored the following day. One image shows the shadow of a blade that is missing the outer 25% of its structure.\n\nIngenuity’s blades spin at 2,537 rpm, so “there’s a good chance, given the rotational rate, that multiple sides of the rotor system impacted the surface,” Tzanetos says.\n\n“Whether the blade strike occurred, which led to the communications loss, or there was a communications loss and power brownout that then led to the rotor strike, we will never know,” he adds. “The team is going to try and piece together more data in the days ahead.”\n\nOn its last flight, Ingenuity reached a maximum altitude of 40 ft., hovered for 4.5 sec., then started its descent at a velocity of 3.3 ft./sec. About 3 ft. above the surface, Ingenuity lost contact with the Perseverance rover, which served as its communications relay. The rover is too far away to attempt to image Ingenuity.\n\nJan. 25 marked Ingenuity’s 1,000th sol (Martian day) since deployment from Perseverance. Its first flight proved that powered, controlled flight on Mars is possible. Following four more test runs, the rotorcraft was repurposed to demonstrate operations for science by serving as an aerial scout for the Perseverance team.\n\n“One of the things that made Ingenuity possible was the use of commercial, off-the-shelf parts,” Tzanetos notes. “We have cell phone chips, cell phone cameras, miniaturized electronics and off-the-shelf lithium ion batteries. The advancements over the last two decades of various industries really worked together to make Ingenuity possible and be an example for all of us of what we can do in the future.”\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIrene Klotz is Senior Space Editor for Aviation Week, based in Cape Canaveral.

The overall cost is arguably bigger than the figure suggests.\n\n• Turkey’s push from F-35 program forced it down the F-16 route\n\n• Greece also to receive U.S. surplus airlifters and possibly tankers\n\nAfter all, Ankara’s own choices put it on the F-16 procurement route. It had been ejected from the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program for purchasing Russian S-400 ground-based air defense systems, cozying up to Moscow and straining its relations with the U.S. and NATO allies.\n\nLosing the JSF program membership it had held since 1999 not only prevented the purchase of the F-35, which would have been in Turkish service now, but also barred Ankara from the substantial industrial program accompanying it that would have brought valuable revenue and experience to the country’s growing aerospace industry.\n\nPerhaps most galling for Turkish government ministers is that neighbor and regional competitor Greece was approved to acquire the F-35 first. Athens is expecting 40 of the fighters, at a total of cost $8.6 billion. Turkey’s response has so far been muted. In stark contrast, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the F-35 approvals “highlighted and sealed the strategic depth of Greek-American relations.”\n\nAthens also looks set to benefit from deliveries of surplus U.S. military equipment, including Lockheed C-130 Hercules airlifters and engines for its Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrollers. The country has requested surplus Boeing KC-135 tankers that could finally give it an organic tanker capability as well.\n\nIf the deal goes ahead, Greece will likely become the 19th customer of the F-35, following the Czech Republic as the 18th after Prague signed for a fleet of 24 F-35As on Jan. 29.\n\nTurkey first requested new-build F-16s from the U.S. in 2021, seeking 40 Block 70s as well as kits to modernize 79 aircraft to the F-16V standard. Ankara has also asked for a large cache of weapons, including air-to-air and anti-radiation missiles and dumb bomb guidance kits.\n\nHowever, the sale faced opposition from U.S. senators unhappy with Ankara’s S-400 purchases, alleged human rights abuses and overflights of Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. This opposition ended with the departure of U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez following his indictment on bribery charges.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spurred Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, Ankara used the F-16s as a bargaining chip in negotiating the two nations’ accession. Finland formally joined the alliance on April 4, and Turkish lawmakers finally approved Sweden’s entry on Jan. 23.\n\nThe Turkish Air Force urgently needs new F-16s. Without the F-35, there is nothing to replace its obsolete McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms and early-model F-16s. Although the Turkish Aerospace Industries-led indigenous Kaan fighter aims to replace the F-16 in the 2030s, its development has been slower than planned; the prototype’s first flight was postponed from its intended date in December.\n\nNew F-16s are a critical stopgap, but opposition from Washington pushed Ankara to find a backup, prompting an interest in the UK-supplied Eurofighter Typhoon as an alternative.\n\nU.S. approval by no means guarantees Turkey will sign on the dotted line, notes Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. “These approvals signal how these two NATO countries are viewed by the U.S.,” he says.\n\nBarrie suggests that the financial cost of the F-16s could limit the scale of the acquisition, although he points out that Turkey has a stronger “appetite” for large defense acquisitions than many of its NATO partners.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency states that neither deal will “alter the basic military balance in the region.” For Greece, the F-35 delivery will allow it to finally replace its own F-4 fleet. However, Prague does not expect to receive its first F-35 until 2031; Athens will face similar timelines. Turkey might have a shorter wait for its new-build F-16s, and the modernization program could begin as early as February, U.S. Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told Turkish media, hinting that Turkey could rejoin the F-35 program if the S-400 situation resolves itself.\n\nSweden, meanwhile, remains in limbo as it waits for Hungarian lawmakers to ratify its NATO accession. This could happen as soon as Feb. 5.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTony Osborne\n\nBased in London, Tony covers European defense programs.

The rest is clear: Move to the marked stopping point on taxiway C5, which connects to HND’s Runway 34 Right (34R).\n\n“Taxi to holding point C5 JA722A, number one, thank you,” someone on the JCG Dash 8 said.\n\nBut instead of stopping at the hold-short line on C5, the Dash 8 taxied onto the runway.\n\nTen seconds before the exchange began, ATC cleared JAL Flight 516 (JAL516), the inbound A350-900, to land on 34R.\n\nSurveillance video shows the Dash 8 moved onto 34R and stopped—something a pilot would do if executing a “line up and wait” ATC command that gives an aircraft permission to enter the runway but not depart.\n\nNearly 50 sec. after the Dash 8 stopped, the A350, which touched down seconds before closer to the runway end, struck the national guard aircraft. Five of the six Dash 8 occupants died, while all 379 onboard JAL516 evacuated safely once the widebody came to rest.\n\nAccording to a transcript excerpt released by MLIT, JAL516 contacted Tokyo Tower at 5:43:02 p.m. local time, and was instructed by tower controller to continue its approach to runway 34R. JAL516, first in line to land, read back ATC’s instructions.\n\nJAL516 was then cleared to land at 5:44:56 p.m. and a pilot read back the instructions.\n\nAt 5:45:11 p.m., JA722A called into tower frequency notifying of its position on taxiway C. ATC gave the instructions to proceed to the C5 hold line, which JA722A confirmed eight seconds later.\n\nCommunications from several other aircraft are detailed in the transcript excerpt, including departing Delta Air Lines and JAL flights told to hold short at C1 as well as another arriving JAL flight.\n\nThe transcript ends before the collision. A JAL statement puts JAL516’s arrival time at 5:47 p.m.\n\nThe exchange suggests how ATC instructions were given and followed will be one of the key focus areas for investigators as they work to piece together the accident’s chain of events.\n\nAlso of interest will be the status and condition of airfield lighting and safety aids. A Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) issued Dec. 27, 2023, and effective through late February lists several airfield aids at HND as out of service. Among them: lights that illuminate stop bars along the connections between Taxiway C to the accident runway, including C5. Runway 34L centerline lights were also listed as inoperative. It is not clear if the C5 stop bar lights or centerline lights were working at the time of the accident.\n\nInvestigators will also look closely at how an aircraft could be on an active HND runway for nearly 1 min. without being detected, even in the dark. An ICAO document shows HND is one of many airports that uses surface movement radar—a long-used method of supplementing the visual view of the airfield controllers have. The system’s performance and controllers’ familiarity with it are other likely topics investigators will probe.\n\nThe Japan Safety Transport Board (JTSB) is leading the accident investigation with assistance from several organizations, including Airbus and investigators from France’s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA). JTSB has recovered the Dash 8 cockpit voice recorder.\n\nThe accident caused the cancellation of 137 domestic and four international flights from HND on Jan. 3, MLIT said.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSean Broderick\n\nSenior Air Transport & Safety Editor Sean Broderick covers aviation safety, MRO, and the airline business from Aviation Week Network's Washington, D.C. office.\n\nChen Chuanren\n\nChen Chuanren is the Southeast Asia and China Editor for the Aviation Week Network’s (AWN) Air Transport World (ATW) and the Asia-Pacific Defense Correspondent for AWN, joining the team in 2017.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/air-transport/safety-ops-regulation/dash-8-entered-runway-without-permission-haneda-accident-atc\n\nAll V-22s Grounded, Probe Finds Materiel Failure Possible In USAF Crash\n\nAviation Week - Brian Everstine December 06, 2023\n\nThe entire Bell Boeing V-22 fleet has been grounded after a preliminary U.S. Air Force investigation into the Nov. 29 crash near Japan found that a “potential materiel failure” could have caused the mishap.\n\nAir Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) boss Lt. Gen. Tony Bauernfeind ordered the operational stand down of the command’s fleet on Dec. 6, shortly after Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) instituted a grounding bulletin for all its V-22 variants. It is the second time this year that V-22s from all U.S. military services have been grounded. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force had also grounded its V-22s following the Nov. 29 crash.\n\nThe Air Force CV-22 crashed into waters near Yakushima, Japan, during a training mission, killing all eight on board. Eyewitnesses reported seeing an engine on fire before the aircraft crashed into the sea. The remains of all eight have been recovered, the Air Force said Dec. 6.\n\nAFSOC did not expand on the potential materiel failure that could have caused the crash, saying that causal factors will be determined as part of the accident investigation.\n\n“The stand down will provide time and space for a thorough investigation to determine causal factors and recommendations to ensure the Air Force CV-22 fleet to return to flight operations,” the command says.\n\nIn a statement, NAVAIR added that “the mishap remains under investigation, we are implementing additional risk mitigation controls to ensure the safety of our service members.”\n\nThe Nov. 29 crash was the fourth V-22 hull loss within the past two years, and the first involving a U.S. Air Force CV-22. An MV-22 crash in Australia killed three people in August 2023. An MV-22 crash in California killed five in June 2022, and an MV-22 crash in Norway killed four in March 2022.\n\nAn investigation found the June 2022 crash was caused by a long-known problem with the Osprey’s gearbox, a hard-clutch engagement. The root cause of the issue has not yet been determined. In February 2023, the Joint Program Office announced an effort to attempt to mitigate the issue by replacing the gearbox’s input quill assembly (IQA) every 800 flight hours.\n\nBauernfeind told Aerospace DAILY in September that the replacements will be indefinite until the issue is further understood, with each replacement taking at first about six days. AFSOC said in a statement it does not yet know the status of the IQA replacement on the V-22 that crashed.\n\nThe order is the second V-22 grounding within the past three months after a Marine Corps-wide aviation stand down following the Australia crash. The Air Force first grounded its fleet in August 2022 after an Osprey experienced a hard landing, though the Marine Corps and Navy did not follow suit. The entire fleet was grounded as IQA replacements started beginning in February and aircraft returned to flight as replacements were completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

But the program is significantly behind schedule. Oprea notes that the upgrade project “has been stalled for almost three years.”\n\nRomania’s Ministry of Economy is the main shareholder in Avioane Craiova SA.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce Viper-powered jet trainer was developed by Romanian industry in the 1980s to replace the Aero Vodochody L-29 Delfins and L-39 Albatros aircraft then being used for jet training.\n\nThe type entered service in 1987. But unlike the Czech-built platform, the IAR-99 failed to achieve any export success, and only 20 entered Romanian Air Force service.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTony Osborne\n\nBased in London, Tony covers European defense programs.

JAL said 13 passengers required medical attention. The airline also said the total passenger count included eight infants.\n\nThe accident is the first ever A350 hull-loss and Japan Airlines’ first accident since 1985.\n\nJAL stated “[Flight] JL516 was involved in a collision with a Japan Coast Guard aircraft during its landing at Haneda Airport, resulting in a fire on the runway,” adding, “our thoughts and prayers are with the deceased members of the Japan Coast Guard. We want to assure you that all passengers and crew on our flight were safely evacuated.”\n\nThe carrier said it will “provide our full cooperation in the investigation of this unfortunate event.”\n\nAirbus said, “In line with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 13 recommendations, Airbus will provide technical assistance to the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA) of France and to the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) in charge of the investigation. For this purpose, Airbus is presently dispatching a team of specialists to assist the authorities.”\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer stated that “the exact circumstances of the event are still unknown.”\n\nThe A350 was operating flight JL516 from Sapporo with 367 passengers and 12 crew members and was landing at Haneda’s runway 34R at 5:47 p.m. local time, about 12 min. later than scheduled.\n\n“The aircraft did not experience any issues or irregularities during its departure from New Chitose Airport or throughout the flight,” JAL said in a second statement. The A350’s pilots “acknowledged and repeated the landing permission from air traffic control, and then proceeded with the approach and landing procedures,” the airline added.\n\nAccording to Flightradar24 data, the aircraft was crossing the runway threshold at a normal approach speed of 122 kt. and touched the ground shortly thereafter. Airport video footage shows how the aircraft was travelling down the initial part of the runway, when suddenly it appeared to hit an obstacle with large flames erupting. With its nose gear collapsed, the aircraft continued sliding down the runway and came to rest close to the end and to the right of it, not far from the airport perimeter fence on the edge of Tokyo Bay. A picture taken by one passenger shortly after having evacuated the aircraft, shows substantial impact damage to the nose of the aircraft and the nose gear missing.\n\nThe Coast Guard aircraft had reportedly loaded aid for support victims of Monday’s earthquake on the Noto Peninsula and was understood to be preparing to take off for a flight to Niigata Air Base.\n\nPictures of the A350 also show that escape slides had been deployed at the two front doors and the left rear door. Passengers appeared to not use the right rear door. While emergency services attempted to extinguish the fire, the aircraft ultimately burnt down completely.\n\n“The aircraft’s announcement system malfunctioned during the evacuation, so cabin crew members conducted instructions using a megaphone and their voices,” JAL said. “Cabin crew members determined safe exits for evacuation, and all passengers and crew members evacuated through three emergency exits.”\n\nAccording to the Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database, the aircraft registered JA13XJ (MSN 538) was delivered to JAL on Nov. 10, 2021. It had since accumulated 4,421 flight hrs. in 3,220 cycles. The aircraft was equipped in the high-density 367-seat configuration JAL has installed for domestic and short-haul flights. These include 12 seats in first, 94 in business and 263 in economy. The Coast Guard aircraft was a Dash 8-315Q registered JA722A. It has been delivered on Feb. 26, 2008. The aircraft had 7,573 hrs. and 2,700 cycles.\n\nHaneda, one of Tokyo’s two international airports, stopped all take-offs or landings temporarily. According to Flightradar24, 110 flights scheduled to land at Haneda on the evening of Jan. 2 were either canceled or diverted to other airports including Tokyo-Narita.\n\nComposite Structure Flammability\n\nJL516 is the first A350 completely destroyed in an accident. The investigation could provide valuable insight into the flammability of large composite aircraft structures based on in-service experience that have so far been unavailable. In July 2013, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 suffered substantial, but much smaller, fire damage caused by a thermal runaway of the emergency locator transmitter (ELT) battery when on the ground at London Heathrow.\n\nFlammability experts know composite-skinned airframes burn “inherently differently” than their aluminum counterparts, a 2012 U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory study on the subject noted. Aircraft composite material is a beneficial insulator that can help resist heat from nearby sources, such as an external fire, the study said. But those same properties make it difficult to cool down once it has heated up and present challenges for extinguishing parts of a fire that are hidden from firefighters.\n\nInformal Boeing guidance on fighting composite aircraft fires issued after the 787 was introduced does not recommend “any major changes” from standard protocol.\n\n“Extensive testing has been conducted in regards to combustibility and toxicity related to the composite structure,” the document, last updated in 2022, said. “This design not only adds to the strength of the product, but also makes it a good barrier to fire and heat. The structure does not aid in the spread of fire and acts as a barrier creating greater difficulty for an exterior fire to penetrate an intact fuselage. From a toxicity perspective, the composite structure during fire testing poses no greater hazard than an aluminum fuselage aircraft. Also, note that the burn through time on the composite structure is significantly longer than with the aluminum fuselage which may inherently provide greater safety to both the rescue fire responders and passengers in some scenarios.”\n\nThe accident will add to learnings from recent passenger evacuation and broader cabin safety improvement efforts. While the exact sequence of the evacuation will form part of the accident investigation, it is clear that all 389 people on board a densely configured widebody managed to escape the aircraft with only three of the four main slides being used.\n\nJAL’s last hull-loss occurred on Aug 12, 1985, when a Boeing 747SR crashed into a mountain en route from Haneda to Osaka. The aircraft’s hydraulic systems ruptured after a violent failure of the rear pressure bulkhead. In one of the worst accidents in commercial aviation history, all 520 people on board died.\n\nWith Dan Williams in London, Chen Chuanren in Singapore and Sean Broderick in Washington.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nJens Flottau\n\nBased in Frankfurt, Germany, Jens is executive editor and leads Aviation Week Network’s global team of journalists covering commercial aviation.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/air-transport/safety-ops-regulation/first-airbus-a350-hull-loss-after-haneda-runway-incursion\n\nUSAF Considering Overhaul, Doing Away With Major Commands\n\nAviation Week - Brian Everstine December 13, 2023\n\nORLANDO, Florida—The U.S. Air Force is considering a major overhaul to its structure and doing away with its major command model as part of a review led by service Secretary Frank Kendall focusing on the service’s ability to fight a major conflict after decades of lower-intensity fights.\n\nLt. Gen. Michael Guetlein, commander of Space Systems Command, said during a Dec. 13 speech at the Space Force Association conference here that Kendall will make the change as part of the effort, which began this fall.\n\n“The Air Force is going to get rid of the major commands structure,” Guetlein said. “Think about how fundamental that is to the way we fight today and the way we’ve always thought about the Air Force. And we’re going to step away from what we know as the majcom structure. That’s going to be a huge change.”\n\nFollowing the speech, the Air Force clarified that the major command change is predecisional and only a potential option as part of Kendall’s overall review. In a follow-up briefing, Guetlein clarified his remarks and added that the plan is not “concrete.”\n\n“Right now, nothing is sacred,” he told reporters. “We’re looking at everything. But, I made it sound like decisions have been made. There have been no decisions made.”\n\nKendall, in a September speech at the Air Force Association conference, said the Air and Space Forces need to change or “we’ll fail to prevent, or lose, a war.”\n\nThe Air Staff, Space Force leadership and the secretary’s office are looking at five specific areas for the review: how the Air Force is organized, how equipment is provided to the overall force, how it recruits and retains personnel, how it can create and sustain readiness, and how support organizations function.\n\n“The Air Force and Space Force are incredibly capable, but we need to reoptimize the department for greater power projection and for great power competition,” Kendall says. “The war we need to be most ready for, if we want to optimize our readiness to deter or respond to the pacing challenge, is not the type of conflict we have been focused on for many years.”\n\nIn a Dec. 2 interview with Aerospace DAILY, Kendall said he has set up a four-month “sprint” for this effort to identify major changes to be made. This will include about 10-20 significant changes, which will be rolled out in February and put in place over the next two years, in alignment with service chiefs.\n\n“I, for one reason or another, may not be in this job in another year-plus, but the chiefs are going to be here for quite a while,” Kendall says. “So this is going to be something that they’re 1,000% behind and we’ve talked about it every day basically.”\n\nThe Air Force has nine major commands, though a total of 27 have been designated over the history of the service.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Everstine is the Pentagon Editor for Aviation Week, based in Washington, D.C.

Whether that includes checking fuel levels, testing equipment or visual inspections, small details can sometimes go unnoticed — leaving room for potential harm.\n\nDuring each stage of flight, unsecured items can become dangerous hazards inside the cockpit. When maneuvering or encountering turbulence, small items, such as wrenches or cell phones, can cause damage to equipment and even block control surfaces.\n\nIn order to ensure a safe flight, pilots must include this factor in their preflight inspections, the NTSB urges.\n\nWhat Can Pilots Do?\n\n1. Inspect the aircraft for forgotten or misplaced items before takeoff. When maintenance is performed, make sure to account for all tools used. Both pilots and technicians can make mistakes.\n\n2. Conduct an inventory of all equipment installed on the aircraft. Visually and physically confirm the structural integrity of antennas, GPS units and other avionic devices. Doing so ensures their availability during flight.\n\n3. Account for all personal items. Clothing, cell phones and bags should be properly stored in a compartment or on your person. After a flight, make sure any personal electronic devices (PEDs) are appropriately stored or removed from the aircraft.\n\n4. Prior to takeoff, remind all passengers to secure their PEDs and other personal items. Everything must be accounted for before and after the flight.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nJeremy Kariuki is Associate Editor for Business Aviation, based in Atlanta.

The contract for technology maturation and risk reduction for critical ECU components should be signed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which ends in March. Full engineering and manufacturing development will follow, with the program expected to be complete by the end of December 2031, according to the documents.\n\nPratt will receive a series of sole-source contracts to continue ECU development over the next eight years, the documents show. Meanwhile, the first ECU version of the F135 should become operational in 2029.\n\n“Pratt & Whitney has 600 employees fully dedicated to this effort, and we’re on track to deliver F-35 operators the power needed to enable Block 4 capabilities and beyond starting in 2029,” a company spokesman said.\n\nThe ECU program is moving forward despite objections by GE and some lawmakers who favor replacing the F135 rather than upgrading it. The re-engining proposal would lead to a competition between GE and Pratt, with each offering production versions of the A100 and A101 turbofans, respectively. Both engines feature adaptive systems, such as a variable bypass system enabled by opening or closing a third stream of airflow within the engine case.\n\nU.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall championed the engine replacement option for the F-35A after he was confirmed in August 2021. But the Defense Department decided instead last year to upgrade the existing engine for the F-35, arguing that the lower costs outweighed the increased performance offered by the A100 and A101.\n\nBoth adaptive turbofan options promised to improve thrust, fuel efficiency and power and thermal management capacity compared to the ECU version of the F135. The new acquisition documents omit horizontal thrust and fuel efficiency improvements as goals for the ECU program.\n\nInstead, the goal of the ECU program is to maintain commonality between engines that power F-35s sold to U.S. and foreign operators of all three variants. The ECU should also increase the longevity of the F135, reduce maintenance costs, double power and thermal management capacity and increase horsepower extraction from the engine to power the F-35’s Block 4 electronics, according to the new acquisition document.\n\nFinally, the ECU program is expected to improve the vertical lift capabilities of the F-35B, the documents say. Such an upgrade would deliver more thrust to the lift fan and roll posts of the short takeoff and vertical landing version of the F-35.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Trimble\n\nSteve covers military aviation, missiles and space for the Aviation Week Network, based in Washington DC.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/f-35-engine-upgrade-set-enter-next-development-phase\n\nNorway Begins F-16 Deliveries To Romania\n\nAviation Week - Tony Osborne November 28, 2023\n\nLockheed Martin F-16 fighters have taken off from Norway for delivery to Romania, helping to enable a rapid expansion of the Eastern European country’s frontline fleet.\n\nThree F-16s of the 32 purchased by Romania left the Rygge airbase near Oslo on Nov. 28 following upgrade and maintenance by Kongsberg Aviation Maintenance Services to prepare them for Romanian service.\n\nThe first deliveries come almost two years since Bucharest made a request to purchase the F-16s, which were withdrawn from Royal Norwegian Air Force service in December 2021 with the introduction of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nBucharest had sent out requests for information to several European allies on the availability of secondhand F-16s in 2019, with the Norwegian proposal being deemed the best solution. Arrangements for the transfer included obtaining approval from Washington, which was finally secured in June.\n\n“The sale of the F-16 will strengthen and modernize the defense of Romania, an allied nation along NATO's eastern flank, which is also a neighboring country to Ukraine,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram.\n\nThe deal—Norway’s largest disposal agreement for military hardware—also includes spares, support equipment and technician training.\n\nNorway was one of the four European Participating Air Forces that purchased the F-16 during the 1980s—along with Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands—and was one of five nations to put their aircraft through a mid-life update program, bringing the Block 15-model F-16s up to a similar capability as the later Block 50/52 model.\n\nDelivery of the fighters to Romania will continue through to 2025, giving the country time to build pilot and technician competence, Norwegian officials said.\n\nThe newly established European F-16 Training Center at Romania's Fetesti airbase, which is designed to instruct Ukrainian pilots on the type, will also serve as the training ground for Romanian fliers. Instructors at the center are provided by OEM Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe Romanian Air Force already operates 17 F-16A/B models acquired from Portugal. The additional 32 fighters—equivalent to two squadrons' worth—are set to replace the Mikoyan MiG-21 Lancer fleet, which was withdrawn from use in May.\n\nRomania sees the F-16s as an interim platform and is already eyeing an acquisition of F-35s during the 2030s.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTony Osborne\n\nBased in London, Tony covers European defense programs.

In remarks to the Japanese parliament, Defense Minister Minoru Kihara said on Nov. 30 that the U.S. military should take the same action.\n\nThe body of one of the eight crewmembers aboard the CV-22 that crashed has been recovered, but the other seven are missing.\n\nThe CV-22 belonged to the 353rd Special Operations Wing.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Trimble\n\nSteve covers military aviation, missiles and space for the Aviation Week Network, based in Washington DC.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/defense-space/multi-mission-aircraft/us-continues-v-22-flights-after-fatal-crash\n\nCanada’s Porter Airlines Grows Embraer E2 Orderbook, With 75 Firm\n\nAviation Week - Christine Boynton November 30, 2023\n\nPorter Airlines has exercised half its remaining options for Embraer E195-E2s, increasing its firm orders for the E-Jet variant from 50 to 75.\n\nThe Toronto-based carrier has already taken delivery of 24 E2s and has 25 purchase rights remaining. Porter previously operated a single fleet type of De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400s, and the longer-range jet has enabled the airline to expand across the North\n\nAmerican continent, including to Western Canada and into the U.S.\n\n“At Porter, we entered a new era when we began operating the E195-E2 earlier this year,” Porter President and CEO Michael Deluce said. “These additional 25 orders enable us to continue extending our reach throughout North America, with more new destinations.”\n\nThe exercised purchase rights are valued at $2.1 billion and will be added to Embraer’s fourth quarter backlog, with deliveries of the additional 25 jets set to begin in 2025.\n\nPorter’s move propels the Canadian airline further up Embraer’s E195-E2 top customer list. According to Embraer’s orderbook, last updated in August, the other customers in the top five for E195-E2 firm order commitments are Brazilian carrier Azul, with 51, and lessors AerCap (45), Aircastle (23), and Azorra (22). Azul already counts 16 of the variant among its in-service fleet, according to the Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database, and has previously announced an intent to operate 75 of the type by 2024.\n\nAs Porter expands its fleet it will continue strengthening its network under a recently announced joint venture with Canadian leisure carrier Air Transat, an existing codeshare partner. “This is an incredible opportunity that has the potential to transform the competitive landscape in Canada,” Deluce said of the JV in a LinkedIn post. “There will now be a stronger third option for consumers in the Canadian market by better integrating much of Air Transat’s international and sun destinations with Porter’s quickly expanding North American network.”\n\nPorter flies to over 30 destinations in Canada and the U.S. The carrier’s in-service fleet of 46 aircraft includes 22 E2s, according to Fleet Discovery.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nChristine Boynton covers air transport in the Americas for Aviation Week Network.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nClique no link abaixo para acessar o artigo:\n\nhttps://aviationweek.com/special-topics/crossover-narrowbody-jets/canadas-porter-airlines-grows-embraer-e2-orderbook-75-firm\n\nGeopolitics, Supply Chain Delays Slow Gulf State Fighter Modernization\n\nAviation Week - Tony Osborne October 23, 2023\n\nSome countries in the Middle East may have largely settled their combat aircraft plans, but regional tur"
