        "text": "Hi, everyone!\n\nRelease Date Confirmed\n\nFirst things first:\n\nThe release date is determined and the DLC will launch August 16th, two years after the original release of Regiments.\n\nWar Paths\n\nNo less important is a first proper look at the procedurally-generated operations - the new mode called War Paths.\n\nThe idea of merging the free-form nature of the Skirmish modes with the deeper mechanics of the Operations mode has been floating around since before the release.\n\nAnd the new War Paths mode is exactly: it allows you to fight through a string of generated battles with a Regiment of your choice while keeping all the defining systems of the fixed Operations and adding some more.\n\nAs a side note, the new mode assumes you already have some experience with said systems: free-form nature means the experience is far less curated, and depending on the settings, the difficulty curve can be steeper.\n\nThe setup screen allows you to customize the planned run significantly. You can select the length of the generated Operation, choose the opposing forces, set the starting conditions, and, of course, the familiar advanced rules. Opposing forces also determine which allies will fight on your side so that they fit the selected area of operations.\n\nMost importantly, you decide on the Regiment you will use. All Regiments present in skirmish are available in War Paths. They will be automatically converted to the operations format.\n\nThe Main Body will remain largely the same. The platoon stacks will feature a limited unit count, and two supply platoons will be added to the roster (yes, you can be much more flexible with field resupply now).\n\nTask Forces are adjusted more: platoons may be resized, their experience level changed, or their vehicles switched to older or newer models. The conversion process is randomized, so each playthrough will feature unique Task Forces.\n\nUnlike Operations, which use a predetermined sequence of missions, War Paths stages are generated procedurally. Each Stage is set on a map chosen at random from a pool. The pool contains all the current skirmish maps, at least two completely new maps, and more than half a dozen variants of the existing maps (some playing almost like new ones).\n\nEach Stage will feature a random mission objective:\n\nAttack\n\nDefense\n\nMeeting Engagement\n\nRaid\n\nRecon-in-Force\n\nEscort\n\nInterception\n\nSome mission types also feature sub-variants for extra replayability.\n\nAll in all, we're aiming for a few hundred base combinations.\n\nOn top of that and as usual with the rest of the game modes, enemy force composition and positions, attack waves intervals, obstacle belts placement, patrols, preparation artillery barrages - are all generated on the fly, making each battle unique.\n\nAs a side note, War Paths use separate save slots to avoid competing for real estate with Operations.\n\nThe Regiment Management screen should be very familiar for those who've already played Operations.\n\nThe layout and functions available are largely the same: you spend Operational Authority to upgrade your Regiment, call in new Task Forces, and restore depleted platoons.\n\nTools of Change\n\nWhat's new is the 'Courses of Action' menu to the right.\n\nAfter a Stage is completed, you are presented with a choice of two following Stages and can select which one to proceed with. At this point, you can also spend a phase to rest and refit. Rest will restore some of the lost units and get a small number of supplies, but it will cost some of the Victory Points. You can rest only once at the start of a new Stage.\n\nBetween the phases of an active Stage, you may abandon your objective and retreat. A retreat may save your force from total defeat, but it comes at a steep cost in Victory Points, on top of whatever you didn't secure on the Stage itself.\n\nAnother addition is a new upgradeable parameter: Signal Intelligence. Higher levels allow you to gain progressively more information about enemy forces, starting from simple notifications about arriving enemy groups and progressing to near-real-time updates on the position of enemy groups on the map.\n\nOn the downside, Signal Intelligence capabilities degrade every few phases, requiring constant investment to maintain them—and higher levels are costly.\n\nOn top of the that, several new event cards have been added to mirror some of the unique capabilities in fixed Operations.\n\nEvent Art is work-in-progress\n\nThe Arsenal\n\nThat is the end of the short overview of the new War Paths mode!\n\nTo end on the high note, we present an almost* full summary of the units coming in the DLC!\n\nClick to expand\n\n*UK Paras and DDR LStR-40 didn't fit slightly\n\nSee you soon at the release line!\n\nHi, everyone!\n\nAfter the last two major patches for the main game, 1.0.99 and 1.1.05 , it's time to get back to the DLC business.\n\nWings of Change Release Window\n\nFirst of all, we finally have an approximate release date for the \"Winds of Change\" DLC: the third quarter of 2024. This means sometime between July and September - hopefully sooner rather than later. The exact date will be announced as we get closer.\n\nCzechoslovak BPzV Svatava - a domestic analogue of the BRM-1K - is conducting reconnaissance.\n\nAir Assault\n\nAir Assault and dismounted infantry mechanics are mostly finalized.\n\nYou may have heard how it works already, but I think it's worth recapping:\n\nAn Air Assault platoon is essentially two platoons under one button. Call in transport helicopters, maneuver them into a desired position, and order them to unload - hopefully, far enough away from enemy anti-air weapons. The unloaded platoon is then free to operate as normal, while the helicopters will automatically retreat off-map, trying to avoid known anti-aircraft positions.\n\nRetreat or loss of the dismounted platoon will trigger the usual re-deployment delay, after which the platoon can be re-inserted by helicopter.\n\nCanadian CH-135 - a very close relative of the famous UH-1 Huey\n\nAir assault infantry have a much higher stealth rating, can dig in faster, and can't be targeted by anti-tank weapons. All of this makes them particularly strong in their element, with the added advantage of arriving rapidly right where they are most needed. On the other hand, getting caught out in the open can be much more dangerous - there's no way to mount to the safety of armored carriers.\n\nTroopers of the East German air assault regiment, LStR-40, charge ahead, supported by an Mi-24D\n\nThere's also going to be at least one non-infantry heliborne platoon: West German CH-53G with Wiesel AWCs on board.\n\nCombat Air Patrol\n\nCombat Air Patrol is a new Tactical Aid option. Several aircraft armed with short-range anti-air missiles will keep watch over a designed area for a period of time. They will stay off-map until the moment they detect aerial threats in the patrol zone. After that, fighters will descend and engage enemy air units in several passes - until they run out of missiles or get mauled by anti-air defences.\n\nAn alternative to existing anti-air defenses, CAP is quick to deploy anywhere across the map and allows player to save points for combat platoons. But as always, if you're looking for a solid air defense umbrella, it's crucial to echelon multiple air defense systems, as the single one never guarantees intercepts.\n\nF-4 Phantom swoops down from above: bad day for Soviet Front Aviation\n\nTowed Equipment\n\nDLC also introduces the first type of towed equipment - mortars.\n\nSeveral armies didn't use self-propelled mortars at all: The French had developed a few such vehicles (such as the VPM-81), but they weren't accepted or were intended for export only. The Netherlands had self-propelled mortars in reconnaissance battalions, but otherwise relied on towed versions.\n\nDutch YPR-765 carrier towing an MO-120-RT mortar\n\nThis will also allow to replace the ahistorical self-propelled MTLB-based model, currently used as a stopgap by the Warsaw Pact nations, with the correct towed 2B11 \"Sani\".\n\nFrench mortar battery firing for effect\n\nRadar Vehicles\n\nOne of the new additions that comes with Czechoslovak army is the 2K12 Kub SAM system. Unlike the other anti-air vehicles in the game, Kub transporter erector launcher doesn't have its own targeting system and relies entirely on the guidance from a dedicated 1S91 radar vehicle.\n\nGuided by 1S91 radar, CSLA Kub launchers engage NATO strike aircraft\n\nWhich posed a bit of a problem, as mixed-unit platoons remain technically impossible.\n\nFortunately, we've found a way to get around this and represent a 2K12 battery authentically by making it a special kind of \"company\". One platoon consists of several Kub launchers, and the other platoon, following closely behind, consists of the radar guidance vehicle. Battery is functional as long as both are alive.\n\nFor now, it'll be an experimental addition, don't expect a full-scale electronics warfare simulation yet :)\n\nAmmo System Update\n\nThe highly visible missiles of the Kub complex also highlighted a long-standing issue: even when units ran out of ammo, the missile models remained in place.\n\nTo make the change possible, the abstract platoon-level ammo pool was split into per-unit ammo pools. It's primarily a code change: with a certain amount of cross-loading, the player still doesn't have to get into the micro to check each unit's ammo level.\n\nAnd with separate pools, it is now possible to have a 1-to-1 relation between ammo available and the armament models displayed on the unit.\n\nUS AH-64, carrying just half of standard 8 Hellfires, overflies a rebel BMP-1 with its ATGMs entirely spent\n\nAfter that, it was only natural to add secondary ammo system. This was most useful for helicopters, which usually carry a combination of rockets and anti-tank guided missiles. Both weapon systems are distinct enough and both have limited ammo capacity, so linking them to a single ammo pool always felt a bit wrong.\n\nThe same was done for tank gun-launched ATGMs and may be applied to a few more systems, where appropriate.\n\nVehicle Slogans\n\nSomething you may have already seen on the barrels of M1A1s since the last patch - certain vehicles will now have randomized stenciled slogans. This takes the existing dynamic vehicle decal system a step further and adds more individuality to the vehicles.\n\nFrench AMX-10Ps provide suppressing fire as the mechanized platoon advances across the field\n\nSimilarly, Canadian vehicles will have an authentic tactical numbering system: vehicles within the same platoon will be identified by letters, with numbers used for company/battalion position.\n\nCanadian M113s on the move - vehicles show letters from A to D, while platoon leader comes with purely numerical designation\n\nThat's all for now!\n\nExpect next devlog to dive into the procedural operations details.\n\nAnd if you haven't seen the DLC Teaser yet, check it out here:\n\nHi, all!\n\nFirst of all, a reminder that the DLC release date was and remains \"To Be Announced\" for a reason.\n\nDLC is scheduled to add entirely new game mechanics and significantly expand the Operations mode - big changes, connected to many internal systems in this or that way.\n\nIt would be very optimistic to expect it to arrive in the same timeframe as the FreeLCs, even without considering a whole host of health problems I'm having in the meantime.\n\nI would like to have a more definite timeline myself, but for the time being, it is what it is.\n\nWork on the 'Winds of Change' continues at a regular tempo: some of the new content and features even make it into the public version, with the F-4F and M113-TOW in version 1.0.98 being the most prominent examples.\n\nThe new nations - Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, Canada, and France - are taking shape. Pretty much the entire unit lineup is done and integrated. Now the regiments are being formed and tested in combat. (playing France for a first time was definitely... an Experience)\n\nCanadian Airborne troops and a Grizzly AVGP\n\nIn researching and implementing the new forces, we've come across various interesting facts and challenges:\n\nČeskoslovenská lidová armáda (CSLA) insignia is the first one of the Warsaw Pact decals that need to be oriented in a specific way - \"blue part forward\", simply speaking. Luckily, a few shader tricks saved us from updating all the vehicle models to reorient decal meshes. CSLA vehicles and aircraft will have the roundel facing the correct way now.\n\nSu-25 with the CSLA Air Force livery: rare case of a Warsaw Pact nation airforce with heraldic elements in the squadron emblems\n\nAn OT-65A Vydra, a recon vehicle armed with a recoilless rifle, and the well-known Mi-24D\n\nRoyal Netherlands Army vehicle designations were notably minimalistic. No tactical numbers, no unit emblems. To compensate for that, a set of static decals has been added to all Dutch vehicles, showing the Military Load Class, registration number, and a subtle flag.\n\nLeopard 2NL - very similar to the Leopard 2A4 in all aspects but armor, which remained around the 2A1 levels. Subtler differences include an FN MAG instead of MG3 as an AA machinegun, and different smoke grenade launchers\n\nFrench Armed Forces low-level air defense is a rag-tag bunch. AMX-13 DCA was outdated, slow, and gradually phased out. Mistral MANPADS wasn't man-portable and was just entering service in very limited numbers. That left the ubiquitous 20mm 53T2 and F2 guns as the main AAA component.\n\n20mm 53T2 gun is the first static weapon to appear in Regiments, taking the role of a pre-placed anti-air site for French forces. Its performance isn't exactly spectacular, so massing them together with Truck- and VAB-mounted systems would be a good idea.\n\nConcentrated fire of the TRM2000-mounted and dismounted 53T2 guns. Maybe not the most powerful anti-air gun out there, but the seat looks comfy\n\nCanadian Armed Forces table of equipment wouldn't be complete without this unique chimera. ADATS amalgamates anti-tank and surface-to-air capabilities on a single chassis and inside the same missile.\n\nIn Regiments, it'll be classified as a SAM system first and foremost, but one that can defend itself against armored threats too.\n\nADATS - a very fresh arrival to the Canadian forces stationed in Germany, undoubtedly raising some questions for Soviet intelligence\n\nAnd as said before, the public version isn't forgotten either - the 1.0.99 update is coming very shortly.\n\nInitially envisioned as a simple hotfix for an MG buff introduced in 1.0.98, the patch grew in size and will now add a new skirmish regiment, new units, a pair of long-awaited features that were requested since times immemorial, and much more.\n\nCzechoslovak paratroopers secure the landing zone\n\nThat's all for now! See you again pretty soon, with the 1.0.99 update changelog."
