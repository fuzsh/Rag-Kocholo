        "text": "Leading Dutch soul singer Shirma Rouse and Orchestra of the Royal Netherlands Air Force join forces to pay tribute to the legendary Queen of Soul. With a performance entitled Celebrating Aretha Franklin they will bring her greatest hits to life, including Respect, Chain Of Fools, Think, and Natural Woman. Singer Rouse is certainly no stranger to the repertoire of her biggest idol: she released an album entitled Shirma Rouse Sings Aretha in 2012 and later on toured the country with a theatre show based on Franklinâ€™s life story. She is a regular at the festival as well, shining on the varied stages often and in different projects. The renowned Royal Air Force Orchestra consists of 48 musicians; 41 brass players and a seven-piece rhythm section, who were all educated at conservatories and have backgrounds in classical music, pop, and jazz."
