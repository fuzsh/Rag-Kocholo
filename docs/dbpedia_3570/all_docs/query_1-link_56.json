        "text": "The United States State Department’s approval of a $150m (€140m) Foreign Military Sale to the Netherlands marks a strategic move to enhance the country’s defence capabilities, fostering NATO collaboration and reinforcing regional stability.\n\nThe Defense Security Cooperation Agency has approved a Foreign Military Sale to the Netherlands, greenlighting the acquisition of 386 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, AGM-114R2, and related equipment for an estimated cost of $150m. This move aligns with the United States’ commitment to supporting NATO Allies, as stated by the State Department.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation is set to be the principal contractor.\n\nKnown to be fired from an AH-64A Apache, the US Army has recently delivered two new AH-64E Version 6 Apache Guardian attack helicopters to the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) as part of a total order of 28 scheduled for completion by 2025.\n\nThe proposed sale includes technical assistance from the US Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) Security Assistance Management Directorate (SAMD) and the Tactical Aviation and Ground Munitions (TAGM) Project Office. Additional elements comprise non-standard publications, integration support, and logistics and programme support.\n\nWithin the last four years, the US State Department has approved the sale of 395 AGM-114R2 Hellfire missiles to the UK for $46m. Similarly, the Republic of Korea requested the sale of 288 AGM-114R Hellfire missiles valued at $36m, enhancing its missile capability for AH-64E attack helicopters.\n\nAdditionally, the US approved the sale of AGM-114R2 Hellfire missiles to Australia. Poland secured approval for a potential $150m sale of 800 AGM-114R2 Hellfire missiles. France acquired 1,515 Hellfire missiles for $203m.\n\nImplementation of the sale will involve US Government or contractor representatives travelling to the Netherlands for programme management reviews, further strengthening the collaboration between the two nations."
