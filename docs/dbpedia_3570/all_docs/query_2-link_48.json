        "text": "Camouflage & Markings\n\nPart 1: Aircraft of the Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu) – Royal Air Force\n\nby Bouko de Groot\n\nThis is the first part of the three-part feature covering the finishes and colours used throughout the history of Dutch military aviation. This part covers early and air force aircraft used in the Netherlands. – Ed.\n\nDutch military aviation dates back to 1911.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Netherlands stayed neutral and consequently was unable to obtain a large amount of aircraft. Impressing interned foreign types which landed on Dutch soil resulted in a miscellany of 71 aircraft, all of different types by 1919.\n\nIn the inter-war period, domestic aircraft production started which proved to be successful internationally, with such companies as Fokker, Spijker and Koolhoven.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, the Air Force had a total of 125 combat aircraft in the Netherlands. Most of this force was destroyed during the short but desperate defence in May 1940, in return managing to destroy almost twice as many Luftwaffe planes. Many aircraft personnel and a few training aircraft managed to escape to England, and then moved on to support the air force of the Netherlands East Indies. Those those that did not leave for the colonies eventually formed no. 322 Squadron with Dutch personnel.\n\nAfter the war, the Air Force was rebuilt with the arrival of the jet era. The first jet fighters, Gloster Meteors, were take into service in 1948, soon followed by F-86K Sabres, F-84 Thunderjets and RF-84 Thunderflash. The next generation of aircraft was introduced in the sixties with F-104G Starfighter followed by F-5 in the seventies. Also in this period, all liaison airplanes were replaced by helicopters. Finally, 1980s saw replacement of the Starfighters by F-16s.\n\nThis page is intended as a guide to clarify and interpret photos and other sources about manned aircraft operated by The Netherlands’ military.\n\nThe name Koninklijke Luchtmacht – Royal Netherlands Air Force was firmly established only by the early 1950s. Before that, the Air Force was initially referred to as Luchtvaartafdeling (LVA) and then Luchtstrijdkrachten (LSK).\n\nConventions used\n\nColour reference information in this article is organised by period. If certain aircraft type was operational during one of the periods described, but hasn’t been explicitly mentioned in the corresponding table, it still carried the colours of the previous period.For reasons of space, the Aircraft type column in colour reference uses numbers to refer to particular types of aircraft. These numbers are explained in the Aircraft types legend immediately below the table.To avoid confusion, upper surfaces are called upper, lower surfaces are lower, fuselages also have side(s) and biplanes have a top and a bottom wing. If a number is mentioned more than once for the same surface (e.g. upper), all those colours were used in a camouflage pattern.British equivalentcolours are given in tables where appropriate for colours originating from British specifications. In case the English name of a colour differs from the translation of the Dutch name, the translation is put between parentheses behind the Dutch name.Parentheses around reference to Federal Standard codes mean an approximate match of an actual colour. Where a * is used instead of the first digit in the five-digit FS code, it is either unknown whether the colour was gloss, satin / semi-gloss or matt, or the original sheen could fade to one of the other.The term natural metal is used liberally, also to describe aircraft covered with aluminium coatings for metal and non-metal surfaces.Special schemes of demo team aircraft and all special unit markings are – for now – not mentioned.\n\nEarly Period, All Services\n\nAfter a demonstration in 1911 by Mr. De Brouckere, the Ministry of Colonies decided to order two of his planes plus a Deperdussin: Dutch military aviation had begun.\n\nThe Aviation Department – Luchtvaartafdeling (LVA) was officially established on July 7, 1913 and initially included naval aviation. This was followed on May 30, 1914 by the establishment of Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger (ML-KNIL) – Military Aviation of the Royal Netherlands-Indies Army.\n\nThe Naval Aviation Service – Marine Luchtvaart Dienst (MLD) emerged as an independent organisation on August 18, 1917.\n\nConsidering the variety of types impressed into service during these years and lack of standardisation, very little can be said with certainty about colour schemes of these machines. There was no common or special scheme for the Dutch military, the aircraft carried mostly factory finish. Interned planes were not re-painted, but were given new nationality markings and codes.\n\nAircraft types of the period were:\n\nKLu\n\nAEG C.IV, Caudron C.IV, HF-16, HF-20, HF-22, Fokker D.III, M.VIII, Nieuport 11,21,23, Rumpler C.IV,VIII, Van Meel, Vreeburg\n\nInterned KLu\n\nAlbatross B.I,II,III, C.III,VII,X, D.III, Ansaldo SVA.10, Aviatik C.III, Avro 504-,A,B, Bristol F.2B, DFW C.V, DH-4, HF-40, Friedrichshafen G.III, Gotha C.IV, Halberstadt CL.II,IV, Handley Page 0/400, Hannover CL.II,IIIa, LVG B.I,II, C.VI, Morane Saulnier L, Nieuport 17C1,Pfalz D.IIIa, REP-2, RAF BE-2C, SE-5A, Rumpler C.I,Ia, Camel, Pup, Sopwith-Hanriot 1B1, Spad VII, Voisin LB.IV\n\nMLD\n\nHF-22, Martin R,S, Spijker V.1, Thulin K/KA,LA\n\nInterned MLD\n\nFelixstowe F-2A, Friedrichshafen FF-19,29,33 (not L),49, Hansa-Brandenburg W-12,19, Rumpler 6B-2, Short 184, 11/2 Strutter, Baby, White & Tompson No.3\n\nML-KNIL\n\nDe Broeckere, Deperdussin, HF-20, Martin R,TA,TT\n\nKLu 1919-1940, named LVA (Luchtvaartafdeling = Aviation Department)\n\nUntil the Second World War the Royal Air Force was (too) small. The handful of squadrons used mainly Dutch manufactured aircraft and tried their best against overwhelming odds in 1940. Ironically, the first victim of the LVA was a British airplane violating neutral airspace.\n\nWhereas many other air forces choose various kinds of lively colours for their aircraft, the Dutch used a basic camouflage of green upper and blue lower surfaces. As a nice alternative to all those yellow trainers, the LVA painted its trainers blue overall.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour LVA khaki Olive Drab / Khaki fuselage:3; upper:3,1,4; sides:1,4 (*4064) 6014 – 251 LVA blauw (= LVA Blue) – lower: 1,4; overall: 2 (*5189)-(*5275) 5018 115 214 ”Blanke lak” (= Clear varnish) clear doped linen lower (not fuselage): 3; wing: 4 (*3564) – 121 604 Natural metal – overall: 5 – – 11 –\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nFokker C.I,IV,V,VI,VIII,IX,X, D.VII,XVI,XVII, G.1 prototype, Koolhoven FK-49,51,52, 56\n\nFokker S.II,IIa,IV,IX, FW-58, Jungmann.\n\nSpijker V.2.\n\nF.VIIa/3m.\n\nprototype of T.V, prototype of C.X Hispona (code X-1 and 750).\n\nAdditional colour notes\n\nPlumbing on all aircraft types was colour-coded as follows: water – blue, oil – brown, fuel – yellow and fire extinguisher – red.\n\nMarkings were painted in white on LVA khaki and black on LVA blauw.\n\nThe Fokker C.IV had clear varnished metal parts (engine, cockpit) and clear varnished plywood centre section of the top wing. The C.VI had marbled engine plating, while the C.VIII had this area left in varnished natural metal.\n\nSpijker V.2 had inner part of lower of bottom wing painted in LVA khaki.\n\nFokker F.VIIa/3m’s during the thirties had the top of the wing or only the fuselage segment of it painted aluminium.\n\nFocke-Wulf Fw-58s were grey on delivery – probably RLM 02 Grau, (FS 26165) – with washable German markings covering the Dutch markings applied at the factory.\n\nKLu 1938-1940, named LSK (Luchtstrijdkrachten = Air Combat Forces) from November 1, 1938\n\nIn the rush after Munich, several new and up-to-date aircraft entered service, using fashionable three-tone camouflage with illogical brown undersides.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour Camouflagegroen (=C. Green) Green Grey upper & sides: 1; overall: 2 (*4077) – 172 223 Camouflagebeige (=C. Beige) Light Sand upper & sides: 1 (*6360) – 168 16 Camouflagebruin (=C. Brown) Dark Brown upper, sides & lower: 1 (*0059) – 10* (lightened with about 10%) – Grijs (possibly Anodiseergrijs) Grey overall: 3 (16320) 7001 128 255\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nFokker D.XXI,XXIII prototype, G.1, some later Wasp G-1s, T.V, Douglas DB -8A.\n\nOther Wasp G-1s, prototype T.IX (probably), prototype FK-52 (probably).\n\nCivilian planes with LVA from 1939: DH-85, DH-90, F.VIIIa, FK-43, prototype FK-49A (floats).\n\nAdditional notes\n\nPropeller tips were usually red-white-blue. Back of propeller was black, front according to factory regulations.\n\nIn March 2005, White Ensign Models came out with these three colours for MW Models in the Netherlands. The colours are coded as follows: ACD 01 – Camouflagegroen, ACD 02 – Camouflagebruin, and ACD 03 – Camouflagebeige.\n\nKLu 1942-1945, Dutch Squadrons With the RAF\n\nAfter May 1940, many pilots went across the Channel to fight on during the Battle of Britain. After that many left for the Netherlands East Indies (NEI).\n\nBecause of this, it took another two years to finally establish some Dutch squadrons within the RAF: 322 (Dutch) Squadron on June 12, 1943 (code VL and 3W) and semi-independent 1316 (Dutch) Communication Flight in the autumn of 1944 (code WK, never used). No. 322 Squadron flew Spitfires, while the 1316 flight used a mix of transport aircraft.\n\nEven so, many Dutchmen kept flying with other RAF units, from pathfinder Mosquito’s to train busting Typhoons, sometimes forming Dutch crewed Flights. Not surprisingly, Dutch squadrons in the RAF used British camouflage of the period.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour – Dark Green uppers & sides: 1,2; all: 3 (*4079) – 163 1 – Ocean Grey uppers & sides: 1 (*6187) – 106 6 – Medium Sea Grey lower: 1 *6270 – 126,165 3,133 – Dark Earth upper & sides: 2; all: 3 (*0095) – 29 2 – Light Green upper bottom wing: 2 *4096/(*4172) – 102 24 – Light Earth upper bottom wing: 2 (*0257) – 93 29 – Yellow lower: 2 *3538 – 154 106\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nSpitfire V, (LF)IX, XIV, XVI.\n\nAnson, Dakota, Dominie, Hudson I, L-12A, Mitchell, Navigator D-18S, Oxford, Proctor.\n\nAuster\n\nAdditional notes\n\nProps were factory finish and after maintenance black (’Night’) with a yellow tip.\n\nKLu 1945-1953, Post War, named LSK\n\nAfter the war a rapid buildup saw the LSK grow to a large number of squadrons, the whole country understanding that you can speak softly better when you carry a big stick.\n\nThe natural finish that started to prevail at the end of the war continued to grow in popularity. However, many planes had to be given a coat of aluminium paint to prevent corrosion, as the metal itself could not stand the wet sea climate of the country.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour WW2 colours – 1 Glanzend geel (= Glossy Yellow) Identification Yellow overall: 2,4; fuselage and tail: 3. 13538 – 154 106\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nEarly period, using WW2 colours, see KLu 1942-1945 following these numbers: Auster 3; Anson, Dominie, Harvard, Oxford, Proctor, Tiger Moth 2; Spitfire LF.IX, Meteor 1. Dakota, see below.\n\nAnson, Harvard, Oxford, Proctor, (Super) Cub, Spitfire T.IX, Tiger Moth.\n\nEarly S-11.\n\nLater S-11.\n\nFW-56: see below.\n\nAdditonal notes\n\nFollowing types af aircraft in Dutch service carried natural metal finish: Dakota, Dominie, F-84E,G (see also 1953, Early Nato), L-12A, Meteor, Meteor T, Spitfire LF.IX, wings of early S-11.\n\nWorld War II-vintage aircraft initially retained their original colours and insignia. New aircraft, and all those that had gone through maintenance units received natural metal finish (or yellow for trainers).\n\nEarly Dakotas had RAF camouflage finish of Dark Green, Dark Earth and Sky or US finish of Olive Drab and Neutral Grey. For these schemes, see MLD 1940-1945 6 and 10.\n\nAluminium transport aircraft could have white upper surfaces.\n\nNatural metal and yellow aircraft had black markings.\n\nThe sole Focke Wulf FW-56A-1 Stoesser was given its own scheme, light grey (probably) overall with light blue arrows running along the fuselage sides.\n\nKLu 1947-1950, Netherlands-Indies, named LSK\n\nTo help the marines and the army in their ’Dutch Vietnam’ (not really: there were 200,000 Dutch civilians living in the NEI), the LSK sent a small contingent to support the squadrons of the MLD and the ML-KNIL. Their NEI experience made the Dutch army soldiers ’jungle veterans’, which by the way accounted for their later reputation as tough fighters in the Korean conflict.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour Jungle Green ?: a mix made in the Indies upper & sides: 1 (*4056) – 75 223 Lichtblauw Light Blue lower: 1 *5109 – 190 123, 124\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nSpitfire LF.IX from summer 1948 (aircraft being gradually repainted)\n\nAdditional notes\n\nDutch Austers gradually adopted a silver-dope finish similar to natural metal starting with summer 1947.\n\nPlanes arrived in the NEI in their European colours (see KLu 1945-1953), originally with small black markings. Those were changed to larger white markings. Natural metal and aluminium-painted airframes had black markings. Some Spitfires and Austers had an anti glare panel, probably Olive Drab.\n\nSpitfire H-60 (and possibly H-50) had a pattern of Lichtgrijs (Light Grey) on the Jungle Green. The H-35 had a non-regulation pattern of (probably) Medium Sea Grey and Dark Green. All had white markings. H-64 was painted Lichtblauw overall for a show, with black markings and (probably) black anti glare panel.\n\nKLu 1953 to 1960’s, Early Nato (STANAGs, Standardization Agreements), named KLu from March 27, 1953\n\nThe Cold War buildup continued, growing to 20 squadrons, now with many US aircraft on duty. The Americans supplied the KLu with many relatively cheap and good planes, but also effectively killed the domestic military aircraft industry.\n\nAs the Cold War became hotter, NATO decided to introduce camouflage again.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour Donkergroen Dark Green upper & sides: 1,2,3,4 (*4079) – 163 1 Zeegrijs, donker Dark Sea Grey upper & sides: 1,2,3 *6118 – 125, 164 4, 130 Extra donkergrijs (= Extra Dark Grey) Extra Dark Sea Grey * upper & sides: 4 *6099 – 123 5, 376 Grijsblauw (= Grey Blue) PRU Blue lower: 3,4 (*5109) – 124 8 Donkergroen, mat Brown-green, Dark Green upper: 4; all: 6; overall: 7 (34079) – 116 110 Khaki, mat Dark Earth, matt all: 6 (30095) – 29 2 Olive Drab same overall: 5 34088 – 66 111, 112, 113 Wit White upper: VIP transports *7875 9010, 9016 22, 34, 130 141, 405 Anodiseergrijs (= Anodize Grey) Light Grey lower: 2 (*6320) 7001 128 255 Aluminium (coated) same lower: 1 17178 – 11, 191 216, 252, 501 Lesvliegtuiggeel, mat Trainer Yellow, matt (?) overall: 8; striping: 9 (33637) – 24 11\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nHunter till mid 60s.\n\nHunter from mid 60s.\n\nMeteor, some Dakota.\n\nsome Harvard, late: F-84F, RF-84F and RT-33A.\n\nBeaver and Hiller till late 50s.\n\nSuper Cub, Beaver from late 50s, some Hillers from late 50s.\n\nAlouette II, other Hillers from late 50s .\n\nHarvard, S-11, Tiger Moth.\n\nHunter T, Meteor T, Navigator (except initially), S-14, T-33A.\n\nAdditonal notes\n\nFollowing aircraft retained their natural metal finish during the period: F-84E,G and F-86K, Hunter T, Meteor T, Navigator T-7, S-13,14, T-33A. Up to late fifties, natural metal could still be seen on F-84F, RF-84F and RT-33A. Most of these aircraft had aluminium painted lower surfaces to prevent corrosion.\n\nAnti glare panel on American planes was Olive Drab, matt black on others. On F-84E and G the anti-glare extended also behind the canopy along the fuselage spine. Also Beavers had black anti glare panel, even though they were camouflaged.\n\nContrary to Nato regulations, Extra Dark Sea Grey was used instead of Dark Sea Grey during the late 1950s.\n\nAt least one F-84K (Q-273) had Anti Search Light Glossy Black lower surfaces (Hoogglanzend anti Zoeklicht zwart).\n\nZeegrijs, donkeron Hawker Hunters faded to a lighter shade. One Hunter T was camouflaged.\n\nTarget tug aircraft had yellow striping on natural metal upper surfaces and sides plus black striping on yellow lower surfaces.\n\nThe white markings of the Super Cub were changed to black in the late 1970s.\n\nCamouflaged Dakotas had white markings, but the Koninklijke Luchtmacht inscription above the windows was yellow.\n\nFor test purposes, two F-84F’s (code P-108 and P-124) were coated Anodiseergrijs overall in 1961.\n\nKLu 1960’s and 1970’s, Cold War\n\nLike other air forces, the Dutch also went supersonic. Luckily there were almost no combat operations recorded during that period, apart from Hunters and Dakotas in New Guinea – which similarly to Indonesia was lost due to betrayal by former allies, regular hunting for Soviet Bears over the North Sea and a highly unusual mock air attack of a Starfighter to end the hijack of a commuter train.\n\nThis period sees the start of differentiating between high flyers (grey coloured) and low flyers (green coloured).\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour Camouflagegrijs IR Camouflage Grey / Dark Grey upper & sides: 2, 3, 5 (*6152) 7012 79 254 Camouflagegroen IR Camouflage Green / Olive Drab upper & sides: 2, 3, 5, overall: 7 (*4064) 6014 – 251 Anodiseergrijs* (= Anodize Grey) Light Grey lower: 2, 4, 5; all: 1 (*6320) 7001 128 255 Donkergroen, mat* Brown-green overall: 6 (34079) – 116 110 Wit White upper: 4 *7875 9010, 9016 22, 34, 130 141, 405 Rood-oranje fluoriscerend Fluorescent Red-Orange trainers and tugs, see below (28913) – – – Grijs, mat (Grey, matt) Dark Gull Grey cockpit of F-104G 36231 – 140 131, 403 Mat groen (matt Green) Dark Green anti glare of part of the F-104Gs (*4079) – 163 1 Aluminium (coated) same lower: 3 17178 – 11, 191 216, 252, 501\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nEarly F-104G.\n\nLate F-104G and early NF-5.\n\nNF-5 from late 70’s.\n\nF-27 up to 1971and VIP transports.\n\nF-27 1971-1988.\n\nEarly Alouette III.\n\nAlouette III from early 80’s and all Bo-105c.\n\nAdditonal notes\n\nThe Starfighter was the only type featuring angular camouflage pattern.\n\nSome colours changed their name during the period. Thus, Anodiseergrijs was also called Nevelgrijs (Fog Grey) or Lichtgrijs (Light Grey). Donkergroen, mat was later called Bruingroen(Brown-green).\n\nA few notes on the F-104G:\n\nFrom the mid sixties on, the F-104G’s were camouflaged over a prolonged period.\n\nNevelgrijs (Anodiseergrijs) airframes supplied by Fokker featured black anti glare panels. All other F-104s had this area painted Mat groen.\n\n3 German F-104G in natural-metal finish flew with Dutch markings in June and July 1963: D-8054, KG-114 and KG-125.\n\nThe landing gear and inside of the wheel wells was painted aluminium\n\nCockpits were finished in black and Grijs, mat.\n\nAlouette III had white markings until late 1970s, when these were changed to black.\n\nBo-105c had a white interior.\n\nKLu 1980’s to Today, Low Visibility\n\nWith functional IFF and anti-aircraft weapons apparently getting smarter, the rationale for highly visible nationality markings seems to be gone. Low visibility has been the new trend, as was independent rapid deployment forces, for which tanker aircraft and attack- and big transport helicopters were needed.\n\nWith NATO Dutch F-16s fired in anger over Yugoslavia (downing a Mig-29 head-on), and with the US Dutch Apaches were stationed in Iraq. All just in time before the later budget cuts, downsizing the air force to dangerously low levels, just as before WW2.\n\nApart from some early F-27s and NF-5s, camouflage schemes are based on greens for helicopters and on greys for high flyers.\n\nColour name British equivalent Aircraft type Federal Standard RAL Humbrol Xtracolour Camouflagegrijs IR Camouglage Grey / Dark Grey upper & sides: 2 (*6152) 7012 79 254 Camouflagegroen IR Camouflage Green / Olive Drab upper & sides: 1,2; overall: 4 (*4064) 6014 – 251 Grafietgrijs (= Graphite Grey) Engine Grey / Black Grey upper & sides: 1 (*6008) 7024 67 203 Anodiseergrijs (= Anodize Grey) Light Grey lower: 1 (*6320) 7001 128 255 Donkergrijs, mat Dark Grey / Gunship Grey upper, sides: 3, 8. all: 7 36118 ** – 125, 164 4, 130 Middengrijs, mat Medium (Sea) Grey / Dark Compass Ghost Grey upper & sides: 3; lower: very early 10 36270 – 126, 165 3, 133 Lichtgrijs, mat Light (Compass Ghost) Grey lower: 2,3,8; all: 7, 8 36375 ** – 127 136 Zwart, mat Black, matt overall: 4 37038 9005 21, 33 12 Bronsgroen Bronze Green / US Aircraft Green all: 5; overall: 6a 34094 6031 117 116 US Army Green same overall: 6b 34031 – – 153 Lederbruin Leather Brown all: 5 30051 8027 170 22 Teerzwart Tar Black all: 5 *7030 9021 182 262 Wit White upper: 9, 10; all: 11; overall: 13 *7875 9010, 9016 22, 34, 130 141, 405 Agaatgrijs (= Agate Grey) Light Gull Grey lower: 9 36440 – 129 137 Grijs (= Grey) Dark Gull Grey lower: other 10 36231 – 140 131, 403 Oranje-rood (= Orange Red) ? fuselage band: very early 10 – – – Reflex oranje Reflex orange fuselage band: other 10 – 3024 – – Verkeersrood (= Traffic Red) ? all: 11; striping: 12 – 3020 174 14 Verkeersgeel (= Traffic Yellow) ? all: 11; overall: 12 (*3655) 1023 69 108\n\nAircraft types legend\n\nFokker F-27 from 1988 to mid 90’s.\n\nNF-5 from early 80’s.\n\nF-16 and air defence NF-5’s from mid 80’s.\n\nmid 80’s-mid 90’s: Alouette III and Bo-105c.\n\nmid 90’s-today: Bo-105c, Cougar.\n\na: Chinook, b: Apache, but colours are very similar.\n\nHercules and F-50.\n\nF-27 from mid 90’s & F-60.\n\nKDC-10 and VIP F-27.\n\nF-27 Maritime.\n\nPC-7 trainer.\n\nAB 412 SAR.\n\nVIP- Gulfstream and – F-50.\n\nAdditional notes\n\nCamouflagegroen is also known as Legergroen(Army Green).\n\nThe camouflage finish was delivered semi-gloss rather than matt on Hercules and F-60, although dirt and weathering made it look matt quite rapidly.\n\nWhen used on the F-27 Maritime, Middengrijs is also called Lichtblauwgrijs (Light Blue Grey).
