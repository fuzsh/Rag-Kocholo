By 1950, Jordan began to develop a small air arm which came to be known as the Arab Legion Air Force (ALAF). The Royal Air Force assisted in training this small air arm and provided equipment. The ALAF's primary fighter was the de Havilland Vampire and a Vickers VC.1 Viking was operated as a VIP aircraft for use by the King of Jordan. By 1955 King Hussein realized the need for Jordan to have a more modern Air force, and on 25 September 1955 the RJAF was established. By 1958 the Royal Air Force had left Jordan and the RJAF had taken control of the airfields in the country.\n\n1960s[]\n\nBy the 1960s, the RJAF had a fleet of Hawker Hunters in the fighter role, with C-47 Dakota cargo planes and helicopters used in the transport role. 1964 brought the RJAF's first victory in the air. In the Battle of the Dead Sea, four Hawker Hunters shot down one Israeli Mirage III and damaged three others.[citation needed]\n\nOn the morning of Nov 13, 1966 the siren sounded at Mafraq air base and a flight of two Hawker Hunter aircraft scrambled. This section comprised of [sic] Lt. Salti and Lt. Shurdom. Three minutes later another pair was scrambled led by Lt. Jaser Zayyad and Lt. Abdeen as wingman. The reason was to alleviate the pressure on Jordanian infantry positions under attack by combined Israeli forces. Arriving at the scene I found that Red leader was engaged in combat with an Israeli mirage while number two Lt. Shurdom was closely pursued by a hostile Mirage which was closing in for a kill. According to Lt. Jaser Zayyad:\n\nI warned Shurdom of the attacker and asked him to tighten the turn. At the time I was pulling up taking advantage of my speed to attack a flight of four Mirages capping. As I was zooming up the Israeli aircraft released one missile at close range. I called Lt. Shurdom to break left and watched the missile miss him and explode in the vineyards. Apparently, the four aircraft spotted my section because they split in two pairs. As No 3&4 turned right and down I decided to turn inside and pursue for a kill. As I was closing less than 600 yards the No 4 left his leader to the left and I asked my No2 to watch him who mistook the order to get him. I closed in to 380 yards and released a good burst of my aden guns. At that instant I heard Salti give a call Hunter behind Mirage BREAK. I immediately broke without ensuring the fate of the targeted mirage. Re grouping at low level the situation looked desperate as there was a whole squadron of Mirages in the air. As we were close to the border and far away from base I ordered withdrawal and made sure red section exited a head of my section. I lost radio contact with Salti and found out upon landing that he was lost in action.[citation needed].\n\nDuring the 1967 Six-Day War, the RJAF destroyed an Israeli Nord Noratlas on the grounds of Sirkin air base before an Israeli counterstrike destroyed the RJAF on the ground and in their hangars decisively removing the RJAF from the war. However, in the closing stages of the war, RJAF pilots operating from Iraq (using Iraqi Hawker Hunters) managed to down one Israeli Mirage IIICJ and two Vautours heading to attack H3 for one loss. Israel said it lost three aircraft and downed three Hunters, before the mission was aborted. It is considered by Israel to be one of the failures of the war.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1970s the RJAF was modernised. Lockheed F-104 Starfighters were acquired from the United States following heavy losses in the Six-Day War. However, the Starfighter proved superfluous and several were donated to the Pakistan Air Force with the last unit withdrawn from service in 1977 leaving a fighter gap that would not be filled until the arrival of the Dassault Mirage F1 in 1981. The RJAF also acquired Northrop F-5 Tigers via Iran during the reign of the Shah who procured them from the United States. Cessna T-37 Tweets were also acquired for the training role. In 1975, the RJAF gave its fleet of 31 Hawker Hunters to the Sultan of Oman's Air Force, having failed in their efforts to sell them to Rhodesia or Honduras. The Hunters were delivered to SOAF Thumrait between May and June 1975.\n\n1980s[]\n\nFollowing peace between Egypt and Israel in 1979, the RJAF began to modernize its fleet once again. The first part of this program was the procurement of the Dassault Mirage F1 which became the RJAF's frontline fighter supported by generous aid from wealthy oil-rich Arab states. The Mirage F1 was selected over the General Dynamics F-16/79 (an F-16A powered by the GE J79 turbojet series as opposed to the Pratt & Whitney F100, which had 25% more power in afterburn)[1] while also acquiring the Northrop F-5 to complement the Mirage F1CJ/EJ in the process.\n\nIn the 1980s, the RJAF supported Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime during the Iran-Iraq War, committing their aircraft for combat training alongside Iraqi aircraft squadrons with one joint aircraft squadron. It remains unknown (and seemingly unlikely) that RJAF pilots took part in combat with Iran. During the 1991 Desert Storm conflict, Jordan declared support for the Iraqi regime, but the RJAF was never officially committed to combat in that war. The RJAF provided instruction for Iraqi pilots who also operated the similar Mirage F1.\n\nSome six Lockheed C-130H Hercules entered RJAF service and remain critical in supporting Jordan's peacekeeping efforts. In 1987 the RJAF received CASA C-101s to replace the T-37 in the training role.\n\n1991 Persian Gulf War and the 1990s[]\n\nFollowing economic crisis that plagued the country in 1988 contributed to a general reduction in the size and strength of the armed forces since 1989, the RJAF cancelled ambitious plans to acquire the Mirage 2000EJ aircraft (eight planned but cancelled) and upgrades of the Mirage F1CJ fleet to the multi-role EJ standard. However, by 1990 the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait brought a coalition against the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. Jordan, despite not supporting the occupation of Kuwait, was accused of backing Iraq.\n\nThe fallout meant that the RJAF was impacted upon[Clarification needed] but contrary to reports, did not lose its operational tempo and was not forced to cannibalize aircraft for shortages of spare parts. Despite this, the RJAF had to rationalize its existing resources due to a temporary downfall in spare parts and supplies. However, economic difficulties forced the RJAF to seek upgrades rather than the purchase of new equipment originally planned.\n\nModernization schemes continued with seven F-5Es sold to Singapore and some funding used to upgrade most of the remaining others with the AN/APG-67 radar (found on the aborted Northrop F-20 Tigershark, once an aircraft under evaluation by the RJAF), modern fire control systems, and WVR AAMs, thus putting the F-5 on par with more modern aircraft in terms of electronics. Despite this, the F-5s lack a BVR combat capability.\n\nModern Era[]\n\nU.S. military assistance has been primarily directed toward upgrading Jordan’s air force, as recent purchases include upgrades to U.S.-made F-16 fighters, air-to-air missiles, and radar systems. Following the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty and the lending of Jordanian support to the United States during the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. recommenced full military relations with Jordan starting with the donation of 16 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon(12 F-16A and 4 F-16B)in storage at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis Monthan AFB. Deliveries commenced in 1997 and were completed next year, replacing the Mirage F1CJs in the air-defence role, following extensive exercises with the existing Mirage F1CJ/EJ and F-5E/F in RJAF service and assuming the lead role. Some 17 further ex-AMARC aircraft were also procured along with six ex-Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16BMs for training purposes (Combat Capable)[2] along with 16 ex-Belgian F-16AM/BM in MLU (Mid Life Update, Block 30) standard in 2009,[3] Another 2 ex-Spanish Mirage F1CE/EE aircraft were procured in 2006. In July/Aug 2011 RJAF received another 9 ex-Belgian F-16AM/BM MLU standard,[4] thus boosting the RJAF's own multi-role capabilities.\n\nRJAF pilots have participated in 'Bright Star' in Egypt against regional F-16 Fighting Falcons and have improved their skills considerably, especially in defining critical areas of upgrading. The AIM-120 AMRAAM has been procured by the RJAF and will improve combat capabilities of the basic F-16. Unlike the AIM-7M Sparrow III the AMRAAM is lighter and more versatile with superior ECM/ECCM and capable of engaging high-g targets, along with an active radar homing warhead (unlike the semi-active homing warhead of the 'Sparrow III') with standard datalink for mid-course guidance and correction purposes.\n\nSome 17 Block 15 F-16s were sent to Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) where they were upgraded to MLU (Block 40) standard ,[5] this enabling advanced AGMs and latest PGMs to be carried. It remains unclear what will eventually complement the F-16s as the F-5s and F-1s dwindle in numbers due to economic, stress and fatigue reasons. In 2008 10 Northrop F-5E, 3 F-5EM and 2 F-5F were sold to Kenya. The remaining F-5s should be officially out of service by 2010, while and Mirage F1CJ/EJ are being slowly decommissioned, so the F-16MLU will remain the RJAF's standard fighters. While most sources cite that the RJAF is seeking 80-90 F-16s and RJAF now equip with 62 F-16s (48 MLUs) and main goal seems to be having all F-16s in common upgraded version. The RJAF's F-16s are currently undergoing a new paint scheme to KA2 standard similar to the 'low visibility' fatigues adopted by the Royal Jordanian Land Force.\n\nTwo light CASA C-295s have been procured and procurement is likely to continue of the type. RJAF also received smaller numbers of the Antonov An-32 from Ukraine for STOL operations for Royal Special Forces, although the status of the Jordanian An-32s is uncertain. One C-130H was received in March 1997. In 2006 two Ilyushin Il-76MF freighters were purchased from Russia. In 2011 RJAF announced the intention to turn 2 of the CASA/IPTN CN-235 transport aircraft into small aerial gunships.\n\nThe Jordanian Special Operations Aviation Brigade has been using Sikorsky UH-60L Blackhawk and MD Helicopters MD-530F helicopters for special operations and border security. Two squadrons of ex-US Army AH-1F Cobra gunships were delivered in the late 1990s/early 2000s. Some have been sold to Pakistan and AH-1Fs will be replaced by new AH-6I attack helicopters. After signing the MDAP 18 surplus Bell UH-1H helicopters were delivered in 1994, followed by another 18 in 1996. Two C-130B Hercules transport aircraft and 16 UH-1H helicopters have been delivered to the Iraqi Air Force. Three C-130E will be received from the US in exchange. Currently two squadrons of UH-1Hs and one of AS332 Super Pumas support Army operations.\n\nLocal air defence comes under RJAF command and consists of Three Patriot batteries, fourteen HAWK batteries and the SA-8B an SA-13 surface-to-air-missiles. The RJAF also owns M163 Vulcan and ZSU-23-4 Shilka self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery.\n\nJordan assist Air forces in the Middle East, training Bahraini pilots and assisting Iraq. There is also a close cooperation with the USAF. The current commander of the Royal Jordan Air Force is Major General Malek Al-Habashneh.\n\nMain air bases are:\n\nAs Shaheed Muwaffaq al Salti AB in Azraq\n\nKing Feisal bin Abdul Aziz AB in Jafr\n\nKing Abdullah II AB - Jabal Rabawi\n\nKing Abdullah AB - Amman\n\nPrince Hassan AB - Hotel Five (H5)\n\nKing Hussein Air College - Mafraq\n\nAircraft Inventory[]\n\nRoyal Jordanian Air Force size is about 16,000 officers and non-commissioned officer and a civilian.
