        "text": "World of the Book 2024\n\nBooks are mirrors of many worlds: worlds here and distant, past and present, real and imagined. Through text and image, they are it conduits of ideas, knowledge and stories.\n\nThis exhibition showcases many of the RARE, beautiful and historically significant books held in this library on behalf of the Victorian community. It celebrates the unique place of books in our hearts and minds, taking you on a journey through the history of book production, design and illustration, from the ancient past to the present day.\n\n__\n\nBOOKS AND IDEAS\n\nThe history of ideas is mirrored in the history of the book. Books have altered the course of history itself, disseminating ideas that have changed how we think about the world and ourselves. Across cultures and eras, books have played a highly symbolic and iconic role.\n\nOnce, it was thought that the world’s knowledge could be collected between the covers of a book. The information explosion of recent times makes it impossible to contain the world’s knowledge within one library, let alone in one book. Yet books continue to be a powerful means of informing and inspiring new generations.\n\n__\n\nThe Age of the Manuscript\n\nBefore the Romans developed the codex (folded sheets sewn together, bound between boards) in the first century CE, texts were inscribed onto clay tablets and papyrus scrolls. The Romans began using vellum (prepared animal skin) as a writing surface, and their invention of the codex revolutionised the recording and accessing of information.\n\nUntil the 12th century, most Western books were hand-copied in the scriptoria (writing rooms) of monasteries, for use by those communities. The rise of universities in towns such as Paris and Bologna in the 13th century created wider demand for book ownership, and the commercial book industry was born.\n\nThe 14th and 15th centuries were the high point of manuscript book production in Western Europe. Personal prayer books,in particular, were often lavishly illustrated with miniatures (Latin: miniare, ‘to colour with red’) and gold-leaf illumination. They were prized as much for their beauty as for their spiritual purpose.\n\n__\n\nFour leaves from a book of hours\n\nFrance, c. 1480\n\nRAREP 091 B7581 (item 2)\n\nThis fragment from a book of hours contains the prayers for the feast of St Barbara.\n\nFour leaves from a book of hours\n\nFrance or England, c. 1300\n\nRAREP 091 B7581 (item 3)\n\nA part of the Office for the Dead is recorded in this fragment from a book of hours.\n\n__\n\nBook of hours\n\nParis, c. 1510–20\n\nRARES 096 R66HO\n\nBooks of hours were private devotional works widely used during the medieval period. They detailed a program of prayers to be recited at set intervals throughout the day. Wealthy people usually commissioned these books from secular (as opposed to monastic) workshops, and they were often richly illustrated according to the owner’s preferences. The owner could also specify which saints were included. The special prayers to Mary Magdalene and Catherine of Alexandria in this book suggest its original owner was a woman.\n\n__\n\nBook of hours\n\nParis, printed by Jehan Barbier, 1509\n\nRARES 096 R66HV\n\nThis book of hours was produced very close in time to the small book next to it, but there is a key difference between them: this book is printed, while the other is handwritten. In the early 16th century, printing began to take over from the manuscript as the main method of book production. But the look and feel of manuscripts were maintained; this prayer book is printed on vellum not paper and its decorations are hand-painted metal-cut prints.\n\n__\n\nLiber antiphonarius Romanus (Roman antiphonal)\n\nGermany, copied by scribe Sister Judoca van Malsen, 1566\n\nRARESEF 091 R66L\n\nAn antiphonal contains the text and musical notation of the Christian offices to be sung throughout the liturgical year. This example is handwritten on paper, although the method for printing musical notation was developed a century earlier. The decorated initials are prints that have been pasted in and coloured by hand. Somewhat unusually, scribe and illuminator Sister Judoca van Malsen has signed and dated her work (folio 395v); she would have produced this book for the use of her convent.\n\n__\n\nThe Birth of Print\n\nThe end of one epoch is the beginning of another. An elite society gave way to a mass society.\n\nlucien febvre\n\nChinese scholars pioneered printing from woodblocks around 200 CE and from moveable ceramic and metal type in the 11th century. German metalworker Johann Gutenberg (c. 1400–1486), who, like all Europeans of his age, knew nothing of these inventions, is considered the founder of European printing.\n\nWithin a decade of Gutenberg’s famous 42-line Bible, German printers operated around Europe, including in Rome, Venice and Paris. The earliest printed books reflected the black-letter style of German Gothic script. In the 1470s, Venetian printerssuch as Nicolas Jenson developed typefaces based on Italian humanist scripts (themselves based on Roman scripts), leading to the ‘roman’ typeface still used today.\n\nBooks printed before 1500 are known as incunabula, from the Latin for ‘cradle’, referring to printing’s infancy. Manuscript production continued in Europe into the 16th century, but its high cost ensured printing became the pre-eminent technology of the book.\n\n__\n\nPrinters’ device of William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde\n\nFacsimile produced c. 1863\n\nRARESEF Sticht Coll.

(England) 1\n\nThis leaf comes from a ‘mystery play’ published by England’s first printer, William Caxton. Aside from this fragment, only one other copy of this work exists, held by the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. Mystery plays were dramatic performances of stories drawn from the Bible and other apocryphal sources. This Latin play used non-biblical sources to imagine the childhood of Christ. This was a subject in keeping with the medieval interest in the human aspect of Christ’s dual nature, about which there is little information in the four Gospels.\n\n__\n\nGeoffrey CHAUCER\n\n(Died 1400)\n\nLeaf from The Canterbury Tales\n\n[Westminster, William Caxton], c. 1476\n\nRARESEF Sticht Coll. (England) 2\n\nWilliam Caxton (c. 1422–1492) was England’s first printer. After a career as a merchant in Bruges, he became a diplomat for King Edward IV. Caxton likely learned the printing craft in Cologne, Germany, in the early 1470s. On his first press in Bruges, he published the earliest book in English. He returned to England in 1476 and established his press at Westminster. It was here that he produced the first English-language book printed in England, an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer’s 14th-century poem about pilgrims, The Canterbury Tales. Very few full copies survive, making this leaf a precious fragment.\n\n__\n\nMyrrour of the Worlde\n\nLondon, William Caxton, 1490 (2nd edition)\n\nRARES 093 C902C\n\nPublished by England’s earliest printer, William Caxton, this is one of England’s first illustrated books.

In the medieval Christian European context, pilgrimage initially meant visiting sites in the Middle East associated with the life of Jesus Christ. However, not everyone could afford to make this expensive and dangerous journey. Local saints became increasingly important, and pilgrimages to their shrines were popular. In England, many people visited St Thomas Becket’s shrine at Canterbury Cathedral. Geoffrey Chaucer’s famous work, The Canterbury Tales, comprises the stories that a group of pilgrims tell each other on their journey to Canterbury.\n\n__\n\nBernhard von BREYDENBACH\n\nauthor\n\n(c. 1440–1497)\n\nDie heilige[n] reysen gein Iherusalem … (The Holy Journey to Jerusalem …)\n\nSpeier, Peter Drach, after 1502\n\nRARESF 093 C953D\n\nIn 1486, the Mainz politician Bernhard von Breydenbach published a Latin account of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Peregrinatio in terram sanctam, which had taken place between April 1483 and January 1484. Such was its popularity that it was translated into German to attract an even wider readership. The work is famous for its detailed woodcut illustrations of the cities Breydenbach visited, and for this reason it is regarded by many as the first illustrated travel book. As well as helping hopeful pilgrims to plan their journeys, it enabled a mental pilgrimage to the Holy Land for those who could not travel.\n\n__\n\nHartman SCHEDEL\n\nauthor\n\n(1440–1514)\n\nMichael WOLGEMUT\n\nartist\n\n(1434–1519)\n\nWilhelm PLEYDENWURFF\n\nartist\n\n(c. 1460–1494)\n\nLiber chronicarum … (The Book of the Chronicle ...; known as the Nuremberg Chronicle)\n\nNuremberg, Anton Koberger, 1492\n\nRARESEF 093 C933K\n\nOne of the most popular printed books of the 15th century, the Nuremberg Chronicle recorded the history of the world from its biblical creation to the date of writing, from the perspective of its compiler, Hartman Schedel. Its world map shows us the extent of the globe known to Europeans at the time.\n\n__\n\nCuneiform writing, developed by the ancient culture of Sumer, was one of the world’s first scripts. It was written on clay tablets using a wedged stick. The tablets were then sun-dried or fired in kilns. Since the 18th century, when successful efforts were made to decipher this lost system, scholars have called it cuneiform, from the Latin word cunea, meaning ‘wedge’.\n\nIt began as a pictographic script – using pictures to denote a word or phrase – and evolved to use a mixture of both phonetic and ideographic glyphs that could denote both sounds and words or phrases. Several significant ancient Middle Eastern cultures used adapted forms of cuneiform script to write in their own languages, including the Akkadians and the Assyrians.\n\nThe library thanks Dr George Heath-Whyte, Tyndale House, for his expert advice regarding the graphic above this case.\n\n__\n\nCuneiform tablet c. 2050 BCE\n\nSouthern Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq)\n\nRARES 099 C89\n\nThe earliest examples of cuneiform script date to c. 3400 bce and record economic transactions. This clay tablet, written in Sumerian language in cuneiform script, records taxes paid in sheep and goats in the tenth month of the 46th year of Shulgi, second king of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Cuneiform was also used to record the oldest surviving epic poem in the word, The Epic of Gilgamesh, written c. 2100–1200 bce in Sumerian language.\n\n__\n\nReligions of the Book\n\nIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.\n\nJohn 1:1\n\nMany religions are founded on books. The oldest, Hinduism, draws on the Vedas, texts dating back to 1400–1200 BCE. Judaism, Christianity and Islam are often referred to as the ‘religions of the book’, as each has a religious text at its centre: the Torah, the Bible and the Qur’an, respectively. The word Bible derives from biblia, the Greek word for ‘books’. Torah is translated as ‘teaching’ or ‘word’, while Qur’an means ‘to read’ or ‘to recite’.\n\nThe rise of new religions has coincided with key moments in the history of the book, such as the development of the codex around the time of the birth of Christianity. Its form assisted the early Church to distinguish itself from Judaism, which used the scroll form for its sacred texts.\n\n__\n\nUnknown Mesoamerican\n\nartist\n\n(Active 1500s)\n\nAgostino AGLIO\n\nlithographer\n\n(1777–1857)\n\nExhibition print of plate 2 from The Antiquities of Mexico …, vol. 3\n\nLondon, Robert Havell and Colnaghi, Son and Co., [1831–48]\n\nRARESEF 913.72 AG5\n\n__\n\nUnknown Mesoamerican\n\nartist\n\n(Active 16th century)\n\nAgostino AGLIO\n\nlithographer\n\n(1777–1857)\n\nThe Antiquities of Mexico …, vol. 2, pl. 17\n\nLondon, Robert Havell and Colnaghi, Son and Co., [1831–48]\n\nRARESEF 913.72 AG5\n\nCommissioned by Edward King Viscount Kingsborough (1795–1837), this superbly illustrated book presents facsimiles of pre-Columbian illuminated manuscripts held in major libraries such as the Bodleian, the Vatican and the royal libraries in Paris and Berlin.

Queen Esther, the wife of the Persian King Ahasuerus (understood by scholars to be Xerxes I), and her cousin Mordechai foil a plot by the viceroy Haman to kill all Persian Jews. Esther achieves this by revealing her own Jewish identity to the king and petitioning successfully for his mercy.

As God’s covenant with the Jewish people, it is the basis for Jewish religious, political and social life. When used for public reading in the synagogue, the Torah is always handwritten on parchment made from the skin of a ritually killed animal. This example, however, is printed on paper and was commercially produced, likely for gift-giving at a Bar Mitzvah (the coming-of-age ceremony for Jewish boys).

It may have been used during special celebrations such as Simchat Torah (Rejoicing of the Torah), the religious observance held on the last day of Sukkot (Festival of Booths), when the yearly cycle of Torah reading is completed, and the next cycle commences. Torah scrolls are removed from the ark and carried through the synagogue seven times in a festive procession, sometimes followed by children waving flags.

Radical English philosopher and feminist Mary Astell proposed a new system of female education that facilitated both religious and secular learning for all women, offering them career opportunities beyond those of nun and mother. Though never adopted, her system stirred the desire for equality in women of her generation and beyond.\n\n__\n\nSusan B.

For settler women, this right was extended across Australia after the federation of its colonies in 1902. The passing of the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902, however, disenfranchised Indigenous women and men in South Australia at the national level; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people did not have the right to vote in national elections until 1962. In 1902, leading American suffragette Susan B.

Published in French as En attendant Godot in 1952 and performed in Paris in 1953, it was first staged in English in London in 1955. The play identified Beckett with the ‘Theatre of the Absurd’.\n\n__\n\nSamuel BECKETT\n\nauthor\n\n(1906–1989)\n\nPatrick BOWLES\n\ntranslator\n\n(Unknown dates)\n\nMolloy: A Novel\n\nNew York, Grove Press, 1955\n\nRARES 823.91 B38MLB (NY)\n\nMolloy: A Novel\n\nParis, Olympia Press, 1955\n\nRARES 823.91 B38MLB\n\nBeckett’s trilogy of novels – Molloy Malone Dies, and The Unnamable – is generally considered his prose masterpiece. Written in Paris after World War II, Molloy was the first of Beckett’s novels to be written in French. The novel, which takes the form of a series of monologues narrated by the character of Molloy and the man pursuing him, Moran, was published in French in 1951, and in English in 1955, and exerted a profound influence on postmodernist literature.\n\n__\n\nSamuel BECKETT\n\nauthor\n\n(1906–1989)\n\nWestward Ho\n\nLondon, J.

The first African American woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, her body of work has shaped Black culture in America and beyond. Morrison was born in Ohio in 1931 to parents from America’s South, and her childhood was deeply influenced by the generational trauma experienced by working-class Black families. Morrison published 11 novels during her lifetime, her rich language and transformative writing providing readers with profound insights into the African American experience. In 2012, Morrison received the Medal of Freedom from then-president Barack Obama. Morrison passed away in 2019.\n\n__\n\nKara WALKER\n\nartist\n\n(Born 1969)\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nNew York, Condé Nast Publications, 2019\n\nExhibition print\n\n__\n\nToni MORRISON\n\nauthor\n\n(1931–2019)\n\nNobel Lecture 7 December 1993\n\nOxfordshire, Oak Tree Fine Press, 2010\n\nRARES 813.54 M83N\n\nOn 7 December 1993, Toni Morrison accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, delivering a powerful speech on the human experience, language and literature.

But after their successful collaborations on the verses published in Punch magazine (later to form part of When We Were Very Young), Milne was satisfied that Shepard was the right man for the job.\n\nAlthough the two were reportedly never particularly close, Milne clearly understood how integral Shepard’s illustrations were to his work. He inscribed a copy of Winnie-the-Pooh for Shepard with the verse:\n\nWhen I am gone\n\nLet Shepard decorate my tomb\n\nAnd put (if there is room)\n\nTwo pictures on the stone:\n\nPiglet, from page a hundred and eleven\n\nAnd Pooh and Piglet walking (157) …\n\nAnd Peter, thinking that they are my own\n\nWill welcome me to heaven.\n\n__\n\nE.H.

After unsuccessful applications for the directorship of the Adelaide and the Melbourne botanical gardens, in 1858 he became director of the Geelong Botanical Gardens.\n\n__\n\nARTISTS AND BOOKS\n\nBooks are valued not only for their content but also for their beauty and craft. Since the invention of the codex in the first century CE, artists have been intimately involved in book production, from papermaking and illustration to design and binding.\n\nThe mass production and consequent decline in the quality of books in the 19th century prompted artists such as William Morris to revive traditional bookmaking crafts, laying the foundations for the fine press movement. Contemporary artists continue to challenge the nature of the book, ensuring its future as an ever-changing object to be admired, read, viewed, and desired.\n\n__\n\nThe Art of the Book in Japan\n\nJapan is renowned for its book arts, including calligraphy and the production of fine papers, woodcut illustrations and bindings.\n\nWoodblock prints were first produced in Japan as gifts presented to believers at Buddhist temples. These prints were religious, depicting deities and sacred texts. More celebrated in the West are the secular images, such as street scenes and portraits of courtesans and kabuki actors from the Edo period (1600–1870), known as ukiyo-e, or images of the ‘floating world’.\n\nFor centuries, the scroll was Japan’s primary book form. While the codex replaced the scroll in the West, the concertina book, or orihon, emerged in Japan as an intermediary form. As Japanese books took on the codex structure, many retained pages of double thickness, reflecting the requirements of the woodblock printing process. Japanese papers continue to be among the finest produced, desired worldwide for creating artworks and fine press books.\n\n__\n\nYūsai KUNITERU\n\nartist\n\n(1808–1876)\n\nHaru no yuki yukari no akatsuki (Dawn of Spring Snow)\n\nEdo (Tōkyō), Yamaguchiya Tōbē, Ansei Gannen (1854)\n\nRAREP 769.952 Y928H\n\nThis beautiful colour woodblock triptych (an artwork composed of three panels) likely depicts Lady Murasaki writing her epic novel, The Tale of Genji.\n\n__\n\nLady MURASAKI\n\nauthor\n\n(c. 973 – c. 1014)\n\nUnknown scribe\n\n(Active 1600s)\n\n源氏小鏡 (Genji kokagami; The Tale of Genji), vol. 1\n\nManuscript, early Edo period (17th century), Japan\n\nRARES 895.614 SH619K\n\nAcquired by the Women Writers Fund, with the support of the Helen Macpherson Smith Trust, 2023\n\nThe Tale of Genji is considered by many as the first novel ever written. Like other iconic texts, including Homer’s The Iliad and Dante’s The Divine Comedy, it has resonated through all periods and across cultures. However, The Tale of Genji has an additional significance in that its author was female. Lady Murasaki was raised in an erudite household that encouraged her learning. She became fluent in the Chinese classics that dominated medieval Japanese culture. Murasaki also wrote poetry but remains best known for her epic tale of the life of Genji, the second son of the Japanese emperor.\n\n__\n\nLady MURASAKI\n\nauthor\n\n(c. 973 – c. 1014)\n\nUnknown scribe\n\n(Active 1600s)\n\n源氏小鏡 (Genji kokagami; The Tale of Genji), vol. 2\n\nManuscript, early Edo period (17th century), Japan\n\nRARES 895.614 SH619K\n\nAcquired by the Women Writers Fund, with the support of the Helen Macpherson Smith Trust, 2023\n\nMurasaki’s novel (possibly completed c. 1021 by another woman after Murasaki’s death) tells the life of Genji, the second son of the Japanese emperor. The work comprises some 400 characters, all of whom are referred to by titles and relationships rather than by proper names. In part for this reason, by the beginning of the 17th century, the 54 chapters of The Tale of Genji were not easy to read without a teacher. As a result, a series of digests, or condensed versions such as this example, were published, offering easier access to the text through familiar language.\n\n__"
