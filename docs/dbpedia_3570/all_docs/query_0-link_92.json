        "text": "Guest post by Michael Richter\n\n[Michael Richter, a German reader of this blog living near the Sorpe Dam, has written to me about recent work carried out in Germany. This is at the crash site of the 617 Squadron Dams Raid crew of AJ-M, piloted by Flt Lt John Hopgood, near the RAF’s primary target, the Möhne Dam. I noticed that the work has been done by local people from the town of Soest, and I therefore suggested that Michael write an article himself, from the local perspective of the 1943 events. He suggested that he also write about a second memorial nearby, that at Himmelpforten, which concerns a local pastor who, on the night of the bombing, tried to warn the community of the forthcoming disaster. CF.]\n\nRecently I visited the AJ-M crash site. I was pleased to see that there had been some renovation work and the visual impression was much better than in the photos of the route description shown in this blog. There is now a small, paved pedestal and the slab bears an engraved plaque.\n\nDoing some research, I found out that the significant improvement was carried out by construction workers of the city of Soest, but the initiative came from a nearby school. Unfortunately, the employee of the city of Soest could not tell me which school this was. I will keep up my research, but I am thankful for the information given by a very friendly person at the Soest municipality.\n\nLooking at the crash site you get a good feeling how the situation in that very night was, especially if you visited the Möhne Dam before. The distance airline is only a bit more than 4 miles. Given a speed of 230 mph it takes just a minute to get there. Unbelievable that three persons managed to bail out! In addition, between dam and crash site there is a height ridge that had to be crossed.\n\nIn some publications I have read that Hopgood had flown his Lancaster into a hill. That does not seem true to me, after crossing the ridge he was flying downhill and the area around the crash site is relatively flat.\n\nIf somebody is planning to visit the crash site, some additional information may be helpful. The unpaved road leading to the memorial is named “Frankweg” in 59494 Soest. It should be sufficient for a navigation system to lead you there. Please be aware that there is a “Frankenweg” in Soest as well. Make sure that you choose the correct road!\n\nIf you drive a regular car, you should park it shortly after leaving the tarmac road. I have a 4WD car and drove it directly to the monument, but I would not dare to do this with a sportscar! Besides it is only a walk of about 300 yards. The picture shows the surroundings and the proximity to the motorway and the arrow points to the monument.\n\nDriving from the Möhne Dam to the crash site leads along the Möhne river. After 3 miles on the left side is another monument related to the Dam’s Raid – the Himmelpforten monastery memorial. Himmelpforten means “Heaven’s gate”. The monastery was literally washed away by the flood wave caused by the breach of the dam. If somebody is planning a road trip along the Dams Raid sites, it is worth a stop. Central part of the monument are the foundation walls of the monastery´s church. Except for a small wall, the church was destroyed. It is said that the flood wave at this place was 13 yards high. Pastor Joseph Berkenkopf heard the explosions of the upkeep mines and the roar of the wave. To him it was clear that the dam has been breached. Attempting to warn his little community he rushed up the church tower and rang the bells until the flood reached Himmelpforten and he was washed away together with his church. His gravestone is today part of the monument.\n\nCurrently, several events are planned to commemorate the eightieth anniversary of the raid which in Germany is always called “The Möhne Catastrophe”. Unfortunately, I cannot report on them because I will not be in Germany at that time.\n\nI am planning to visit the other German crash sites this year. If there is anything interesting to report from there, I will write something about it.\n\nDriving from the Möhne Dam to the crash site leads along the Möhne river.

CF.\n\nRevised version September 2022\n\nText and pictures by Malcolm Peel\n\nOn the evening of 16th May 1943, 133 aircrew in 19 Lancasters took off from RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire to attack the German dams east of the Ruhr. Eight aircraft and 53 men did not return. Three men survived their crashes and became Prisoners of War.\n\nThe following guide to these sites was initially compiled in August 2018 and was substantially revised in September 2022. They serve as as an update to the excellent book written by Chris Ward and Andreas Wachtel, Dambuster Crash Sites, published in 2007 by Pen & Sword. Reference to this book is highly recommended for its historical content and descriptions of the discovery of the sites.\n\nHowever, due to the ravages of time over the years, the construction or demolition of buildings, the changes in road layouts and other key landmarks, some of the Tour Guides in the book have become awkward to follow. Also, the book was published before the era of sat nav and Google Maps. For ease of navigation, the co-ordinates for all the sites (or the nearest vehicular access point) are given below, as well as some for key points on some routes.\n\nIf you are travelling from the UK, it is suggested that you travel to the dams first, joining the Corridor at the Möhne. To simplify its compilation, the following guide has been presented in that order as this route can also avoid using the very busy motorway network through the Ruhr around Essen, Duisburg and Dortmund.\n\nMany users of this Guide will have a mobile navigation device of some description and therefore may only be using the co-ordinates given to each location. This might mean that you may be approaching the memorial from a different direction, which renders the detailed routes irrelevant.\n\nHowever, if you are using them, they have been described from either the nearest town/city or from a major location, i.e. road junctions, castle, dam, etc., as one never knows when your sat nav is going to let one down! Also, it’s always good to have some indication that you are on the right road so, sometimes, landmarks are identified along the way.\n\nOf the many books written about the raid, one of the best is James Holland’s Dambusters: The Race To Smash The Dams, Transworld Publishers 2012, which explains in a very readable format the reasons for the raid, the development of the bouncing bomb, the formation of 617 Squadron and the raid itself. There are also some excellent maps, diagrams and a complete Timeline of Operation Chastise.\n\nMention must also be made of Charles Foster’s very informative work, The Complete Dambusters: The 133 Men Who Flew on the Dams Raid, History Press 2018, which gives the story of each of the airmen who took part in the raid. A photo of each man is included as well as much information on the raid itself.\n\nThe Crash Corridor\n\nWard/Watchel describe in great detail how and why each aircraft crashed.\n\nHopgood at Soest was the only one to be shot down while attacking a dam – all the others were the victims of flak or a crash on the flight either to or from the dams. The only two not in the Corridor are shown with a cross on the above map – Byers in the sea off Texel, north of Den Helder and Burpee who crashed on the air base at Gilze-Rijen, between Breda and Tilburg.\n\nThe Dams\n\nThe co-ordinates for the three main dams are as follows:\n\nEder\n\n51.184559\n\n9.060715\n\nSorpe\n\n51.353044\n\n7.964041\n\nMöhne\n\n51.491659\n\n8.061964\n\nThe Cemeteries\n\nThe casualties are buried in five cemeteries in Germany and Holland.\n\nRheinberg War Cemetery:\n\nHopgood and crew\n\nReichswald Forest War Cemetery:\n\nMaudslay and crew\n\nAstell and crew\n\nBarlow and crew\n\nOttley and crew\n\nBergen-op-Zoom War Cemetery:\n\nBurpee and crew\n\nBergen General Cemetery:\n\nYoung and crew\n\nThe grave of James McDowell, Byers’ rear gunner, is in Harlingen General Cemetery (see below) – the bodies of the rest of Byers’ crew were never recovered and they are remembered on the RAF Memorial at Runnymede. There is now a memorial to them in Harlingen General Cemetery.\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission website gives full details of all those killed and includes maps and co-ordinates for the cemeteries.\n\n******\n\nFlt Lt J.V. Hopgood DFC & Bar\n\nED925 AJ-M\n\nNear Soest, NW of Möhnesee\n\nCo-ordinates:\n\n51.535276\n\n7.996486\n\nThe most logical route to this site is from the dam. Turn right out of the car park and proceed towards Möhnesee, passing the Hotel Haus Delecke on your right.\n\nAt the roundabout, turn left onto the 229 and after about 2.0 miles, left onto the 516 towards Ense … it’s one of those weird junctions that takes you under the 516, turns left then right.\n\nAfter 3.5 miles, turn right onto the L745 An Der Lanner towards Volbringen.\n\nAfter passing through the village, you will come to a crossroads with a stone tower on the right … go straight on.\n\nIn less than a mile, look for some low, dark green farm buildings on the left and just before a bridge under the motorway, turn right onto the track on the right (above co-ordinates refer). This track is initially tarmac but that soon becomes stony.\n\nThe track drops down with a wood coming up your left but before the road rises again, look left … about 100 yards across some open ground, you will see a tall yellow pole and just beyond and to the right, the wooden post with a brass plaque adjacent to a wooden bench.\n\nIt is strongly advised that you do NOT attempt to cross the open ground to the memorial by car as the ground is very uneven and probably water-logged in bad weather.\n\nPark on the right and walk up the rise – at the top, a further track on the left will take you down to the memorial.\n\nThis is the closest accessible point to the crash site which is probably in the field off to the right where the motorway runs now.\n\n******\n\nPlt Off W Ottley DFC\n\nED910 AJ-C\n\nNorth of Hamm\n\nCo-ordinates (nearest vehicular access):\n\n51.724373\n\n7.792254\n\nThis is one where you’ll need hiking boots or wellies!\n\nTake the B63 north out of Hamm towards Munster, crossing over the river Lippe, and after about 1.5 miles, look out for the KAUFLAND superstore on your left.\n\nStraight on at the next roundabout … the one with the pink elephant wearing headphones (I kid you not!)\n\nThrough the traffic lights with MANSFELDERSTR and the SENIORENZENTRUM ST JOSEPH on your right.\n\nAfter about one mile, a small signpost for GEINEGGE comes up on your left … which is both a street name and a village … and on your right is a red-brick house.\n\nSLOW DOWN.\n\nOn the right and immediately after the house is a field with an electricity pylon.\n\nThe track to the crash site is at the far end of this field just before a line of trees and runs at right-angles to the main road.\n\nIt is suggested that you reverse into this track but do NOT attempt to drive further unless you have a 4X4 or similar vehicle.\n\nWalk down the track passing the pylon on your right … it has a black and yellow sign carrying the number 1614. If it doesn’t, you are in the wrong field!\n\nCarry on to the corner of the wood in front of you.\n\nThe track bends left and right around the corner of the wood – amongst the trunks of two trees on the left, there are the remains of a wooden structure of some description.\n\nFollow the line of the wood on your right for about 200 yards and the wooden cross is on your right in front of the crater created when the Upkeep exploded on impact.\n\nDepending on the season, the ground leading up to the memorial could be very overgrown so great care should be taken.\n\nThe original memorial was situated in the crater which frequently becomes water-logged and the cross became rotten.\n\nThe bronze plaque (now barely legible) which was attached to the first cross is now fixed to the rear.\n\nIn the Spring of 2022, the area around the memorial was cleared by a local community group and consideration is being given to relocate it to a more accessible site. However, negotiations are still in the early stages and nothing is likely to occur for some time.\n\n******\n\nFlt Lt W Astell DFC\n\nED864 AJ-B\n\nNorth of Raesfeld\n\nCo-ordinates (memorial site):\n\n51.808419\n\n6.868116\n\nFrom the Castle in Raesfeld, turn right at the roundabout and follow the road through the town. Following the B70, turn left at the roundabout north towards Borken with the Ford dealer, Autohaus Jacobs, on the left.\n\nAcross a second roundabout and after about 1.5 miles, straight on at the lights. About 100 yards further on, look for SIEPENWEG, a narrow tarmac road on the right.\n\nAfter 200 yards, fork left – following Siepenweg.\n\nAfter about ½ mile, fork right onto HESSEBREE.\n\nStraight on at a crossroads and over a small bridge with a 9-ton weight limit.\n\n1.8 miles later, turn right onto HUNGERWEG and the memorial is on your left.\n\nIf you stand with your back to the memorial, at 2 o’clock, you will see an electricity pylon – it is conceivable that the 1943 version of this finally brought down the Lancaster which crashed in the field behind the memorial.\n\n******\n\nFlt Lt R N G Barlow DFC RAAF\n\nED927 AJ-E\n\nHaldern, near Rees\n\nCo-ordinates (blue RAF sign):\n\n51.792133\n\n6.440214\n\nCo-ordinates (larger parking area):\n\n51.796722\n\n6.448845\n\nCo-ordinates (memorial site):\n\n51.79662\n\n6.442784\n\nMajor road/rail construction work is taking place near the railway station in Haldern, and it is reported that the work will continue into 2024.\n\nAlthough not the shortest route, but certainly the easiest, is to take the A3 autobahn, leaving at Junction 4 and joining the 67 southbound towards REES.\n\nIn about 1.5 miles, turn left onto L549 HALDERNER STR and then after about one mile, take the narrow tarmac road to your left … an Air Force blue signpost with the RAF roundel is pointing your way! (Co-ordinates above)\n\nAbout 500 yards along this road, you see a cycle path on the left with a barrier blocking vehicular access – this marks the start of the field in which Barlow’s Lancaster crashed.\n\nThe memorial is near the wind turbine to the right of the trees in the photo but for now, carry straight on to another turbine. The area in front of the turbine is/was partially fenced off but parking is still possible.\n\nThe plane crashed somewhere between the base of this turbine and the small, stagnant pond in the little field on the other side of the wire fence.\n\nWalk or drive back to the cycle path – parking is possible – JUST!\n\nGo down the path until you reach a rectangular field with the above turbine at 3 o’clock.\n\nEither walk diagonally across or around the field to the memorial at the foot of a tree in the corner.\n\n******\n\nSqn Ldr H E Maudslay DFC\n\nED937 AJ-Z\n\nNorth east of Emmerich\n\nCo-ordinates (memorial site):\n\n51.8565\n\n6.276442\n\nFrom the A3 motorway, take Exit 3 A220 south towards Emmerich and Kleve.\n\nThe above co-ordinates may now instruct you to turn left at the KUSTER OIL filling station on the left – this route will still take you to the memorial but over some narrow tracks and blind corners/junctions. You are advised to carry on and …\n\n… at traffic lights, with another KUSTER OIL/SPIEL STATION at 2 o’clock, turn left onto L16 WESELER STR\n\nAfter about a mile, look out for the big orange OBI superstore and turn left at the roundabout.\n\nDrive past the INTEROVO Egg Group and just before the CONVENT warehouse, turn left onto BUDBERGER STR\n\nFork left onto FLASSERTWEG and follow this road until you come to a left-and-right bend in the road with a red and white barrier ahead.\n\n******\n\nPlt Off L J Burpee DFM RCAF\n\nED865 AJ-S\n\nOn the former Luftwaffe night fighter station at Gilze-Rijen\n\nCo-ordinates (entrance to airbase):\n\n51.577043\n\n4.926065\n\nThis memorial was dedicated in early 2018 and is situated on an active airbase operated by the Royal Netherlands Air Force.\n\nThere are, as one can imagine, very tight security implications in gaining access to the base and the best way to arrange a tour is to contact Ton Van Den Hoof at the museum, giving at least two months’ notice of an intended visit. Email traditiekamer.gilzerijen@mindef.nl. It is also recommended that you email Sander van der Hall, a local supporter of the project: sandervanderhall@home.nl\n\nHowever, be advised that entry permission may be withdrawn or postponed (perhaps at very short notice) should an emergency situation arise.\n\nA tour will also include a visit to the museum which, although concentrating on the very interesting history of the airbase, has an excellent section containing Dambusters memorabilia.\n\n******\n\nSqn Ldr H M “Dinghy” Young DFC & Bar\n\nED887 AJ-A\n\nIn the sea off Castricum-aan-Zee, Strand\n\nCo-ordinates (nearest vehicular access):\n\n52.5574\n\n4.610735\n\nCastricum-aan-Zee is on the coast approx. 25 miles north west of Amsterdam.\n\nTake the A9 north from Haarlem and at Junction 10, turn left onto N203.\n\nAfter approx. 3.5 miles, turn left onto N513 SEEWEG\n\nThis road only goes to the Strand, a very popular beach with two huge car parks.\n\nThis was taken on a Friday afternoon in June 2018 and the other car park was almost full. GO EARLY OR OFF-SEASON. Parking charges apply but there’s no alternative unless you have a Disabled Badge.\n\nWalk past the cafes; the memorial is on the left at the start of the slope down towards the beach.\n\n******\n\nPlt Off V W Byers RCAF\n\nED934 AJ-K\n\nIn the sea, off Texel/Vlieland\n\nCo-ordinates (nearest vehicular access)\n\n53.177619\n\n5.424722\n\nThe memorial is in Harlingen General Cemetery is located in the north of the town on BEGRAAFPLAATLAAN and parking is possible nearby on MIDLUMERLAAN.\n\nOn entering the cemetery and after approx. 50m, turn left and follow the path to the CWGC graves – the memorial to the whole crew is just beyond, adjacent to the boundary.\n\nOnly one body was recovered, that of JAMES McDOWELL, the rear gunner. He was presumably thrown clear and the strong current took his body north. It was found floating in the Vliestrom Channel on 22 June 1943. It was brought ashore and he is buried in Plot E Row 4 Grave 11. The remaining bodies were never found and they are officially listed as ‘missing, presumed dead’.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the above guides were compiled in July 2018 and updated in September 2022 and while every care has been taken to provide accurate information, responsibility cannot be accepted for changes in buildings or other structures, road layouts and signage, natural and other landmarks, or any other factors used to describe routes."
