        "text": "On the centennial anniversary of Veterans Day, Palo Alto Networks LIVEcommunity would like to say thank you to all the Veterans around the world for their service and to all the active men and women in the military who continue to protect our way of life.\n\nVeterans Day began as Armistice Day on November 11, 1919, marking the first anniversary of the end of World War I. The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918 officially marked the end of World War I. Many countries who were involved in both World War I and II commemorate Veterans near November 11th.\n\nToday, veterans from around the world are honored for their continued commitment to protecting the livelihood of our freedom. As a cybersecurity company that strives to protect our digital way of life, we also want to do our part to help veterans stay educated to fight a war on a different front—cyberspace.\n\nWe understand that choosing the right industry to transition from military life to civilian life can be challenging. At Palo Alto Networks, we believe veterans are well-positioned to pursue a career in cybersecurity based on the intangible qualities and values developed during their military career, and it’s those same qualities and values that can help build a career in cybersecurity.\n\n“Veterans from the military are in general very stress resistant, analytical and can work in teams. These capabilities are also extremely relevant in cybersecurity because things move fast, and an overload of data is always possible for people working in this space. That’s one of the reasons why veterans are so successful in this cyber-world,”\n\n– Fred Streefland, Royal Netherlands Air Force, 1988-2008, Reservist 2019-Present.\n\nAs part of our commitment to our employees and giving back to veterans, Palo Alto Networks offers programs such as the Second Watch that provides free digital learning courses to veterans, so they can learn the basics of malware and how to manage a global infrastructure of next-generation firewalls. We also offer veterans the opportunity to take a free exam to become a Palo Alto Networks Certified Security Administrator (PCNSA).\n\nLearn more about Veterans at Palo Alto Networks, please visit the following links:\n\nSecond Watch on LIVEcommunity\n\nVeteran Skills Learning Path\n\nVeterans at Palo Alto Networks"
