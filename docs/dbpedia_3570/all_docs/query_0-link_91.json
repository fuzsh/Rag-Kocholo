        "text": "The Winds of Change are gaining strength. The DLC release is almost here.\n\nSo, let's go through some of the questions.\n\nRelease time\n\nThe release is planned for 11:00 AM BST / 06:00 EDT / 03:00 AM PDT 16th August.\n\nPrice\n\nThe DLC is priced at $ 12.99 USD, and most regional prices follow standard Steam currency conversion rates.\n\nDLC Update Process\n\nThere are no separate DLC and non-DLC files: everything will be downloaded with the main branch update - you should see version 1.4.0 (or more) in the bottom right corner of the main menu after that.\n\nPurchasing the DLC on Steam will unlock the appropriate content.\n\nDLC Content\n\nAs noted above, some of the new content will be available immediately, and some will require DLC purchase:\n\nMain Game Update:\n\nAir Assault infantry\n\nAir Patrol Tac-Aids\n\nTowed mortars\n\nNew units for existing nations\n\nRevised base-game Regiments and Task Forces to include these additions\n\nNew Maps: 2 completely new - Wasteland and Blumenthal, and 6 alternative versions of the existing maps\n\nRevised Ammo System: now with Primary, Secondary, and Squad pools\n\nDLC-only Content:\n\nWar Paths mode - featuring the highly customizable, procedurally-generated Operations, described in the previous dev log\n\nFour new nations:\n\nCanada - 3 Regiments, 20 Task Forces\n\nNetherlands - 3 Regiments, 17 Task Forces\n\nFrance - 3 Regiments, 19 Task Forces\n\nCzechoslovakia - 4 Regiments, 20 Task Forces\n\nPlus a new Soviet regiment, representing the Central Group of Forces, stationed in Czechoslovakia - with 3 new Task Forces\n\nNote: War Paths' new features, like Courses of Action and Signal Intelligence, won't be added to existing Operations, as they are balanced around not having those. The unit roster in Operations will also remain largely the same, as the save structure makes changes complicated.\n\nLimitations\n\nAs occasionally happens in game development, not everything makes it to the finish line in time.\n\nNo Air Assault platoons for AI: Sadly, the planning and coordination involved in using those are beyond the current AI architecture. It is the same reason there are no AI Supply platoons. It requires a significant AI rewrite, which I'm planning to do anyway, but may take some considerable time.\n\nNew Maps aren't set up for Skirmish yet and are available only in War Paths mode. This will be addressed in one of the patches right after the DLC release.\n\nThanks, and see you on the other side of the release date!\n\nHi, everyone!\n\nRelease Date Confirmed\n\nFirst things first:\n\nThe release date is determined and the DLC will launch August 16th, two years after the original release of Regiments.\n\nWar Paths\n\nNo less important is a first proper look at the procedurally-generated operations - the new mode called War Paths.\n\nThe idea of merging the free-form nature of the Skirmish modes with the deeper mechanics of the Operations mode has been floating around since before the release.\n\nAnd the new War Paths mode is exactly: it allows you to fight through a string of generated battles with a Regiment of your choice while keeping all the defining systems of the fixed Operations and adding some more.\n\nAs a side note, the new mode assumes you already have some experience with said systems: free-form nature means the experience is far less curated, and depending on the settings, the difficulty curve can be steeper.\n\nThe setup screen allows you to customize the planned run significantly. You can select the length of the generated Operation, choose the opposing forces, set the starting conditions, and, of course, the familiar advanced rules. Opposing forces also determine which allies will fight on your side so that they fit the selected area of operations.\n\nMost importantly, you decide on the Regiment you will use. All Regiments present in skirmish are available in War Paths. They will be automatically converted to the operations format.\n\nThe Main Body will remain largely the same. The platoon stacks will feature a limited unit count, and two supply platoons will be added to the roster (yes, you can be much more flexible with field resupply now).\n\nTask Forces are adjusted more: platoons may be resized, their experience level changed, or their vehicles switched to older or newer models. The conversion process is randomized, so each playthrough will feature unique Task Forces.\n\nUnlike Operations, which use a predetermined sequence of missions, War Paths stages are generated procedurally. Each Stage is set on a map chosen at random from a pool. The pool contains all the current skirmish maps, at least two completely new maps, and more than half a dozen variants of the existing maps (some playing almost like new ones).\n\nEach Stage will feature a random mission objective:\n\nAttack\n\nDefense\n\nMeeting Engagement\n\nRaid\n\nRecon-in-Force\n\nEscort\n\nInterception\n\nSome mission types also feature sub-variants for extra replayability.\n\nAll in all, we're aiming for a few hundred base combinations.\n\nOn top of that and as usual with the rest of the game modes, enemy force composition and positions, attack waves intervals, obstacle belts placement, patrols, preparation artillery barrages - are all generated on the fly, making each battle unique.\n\nAs a side note, War Paths use separate save slots to avoid competing for real estate with Operations.\n\nThe Regiment Management screen should be very familiar for those who've already played Operations.\n\nThe layout and functions available are largely the same: you spend Operational Authority to upgrade your Regiment, call in new Task Forces, and restore depleted platoons.\n\nTools of Change\n\nWhat's new is the 'Courses of Action' menu to the right.\n\nAfter a Stage is completed, you are presented with a choice of two following Stages and can select which one to proceed with. At this point, you can also spend a phase to rest and refit. Rest will restore some of the lost units and get a small number of supplies, but it will cost some of the Victory Points. You can rest only once at the start of a new Stage.\n\nBetween the phases of an active Stage, you may abandon your objective and retreat. A retreat may save your force from total defeat, but it comes at a steep cost in Victory Points, on top of whatever you didn't secure on the Stage itself.\n\nAnother addition is a new upgradeable parameter: Signal Intelligence. Higher levels allow you to gain progressively more information about enemy forces, starting from simple notifications about arriving enemy groups and progressing to near-real-time updates on the position of enemy groups on the map.\n\nOn the downside, Signal Intelligence capabilities degrade every few phases, requiring constant investment to maintain them—and higher levels are costly.\n\nOn top of the that, several new event cards have been added to mirror some of the unique capabilities in fixed Operations.\n\nEvent Art is work-in-progress\n\nThe Arsenal\n\nThat is the end of the short overview of the new War Paths mode!\n\nTo end on the high note, we present an almost* full summary of the units coming in the DLC!\n\nClick to expand\n\n*UK Paras and DDR LStR-40 didn't fit slightly\n\nSee you soon at the release line!"
