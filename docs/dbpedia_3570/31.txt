General info

I would like to suggest the addition of the modern Royal Netherlands Air Force roundel. The triangle roundel that is currently ingame was only used in 1939-1940 to avoid misidentification as British aircraft by German pilots. Now that there are two aircraft ingame that also have this roundel in their skins I would believe it would be rather easy to add the roundel to the game.

The same has been done for the Hungarian roundel after the addition of the Hungarian subtree. I would seem only fair for the same thing to be done for the BeNeLux subtree.

I kinda understand them locking it looking from an older point of view. But would it really have that much of an inpact on sim plane recognition? The old dutch triangle is currently available to all nation already. Besides that, historicly it would make more sence to make it available to all allied forces right? Knowing that the RNLAF flew for the brits in ww2?

Edit: let me know when your new suggestion is up, would like to support it.

Or with the current copy-paste we could maybe even get away from unlocking roundels for all nations in general.

For the WW2 era i understand them trying to have a semi historical looking vehicle. But higher tier wise with the missle spam and copy paste (the never ending T series tanks for example) it wouldn’t really matter i think.

I can understand this but at the same time, you can easily confuse others in many others ways. You can cover up existing decals, people can just put the whole flag on of a country on their vehicles in order to mask and confuse, etc. Sure with a insignia it could be more genuine but eh.

Oh boy… do I have news for you…
