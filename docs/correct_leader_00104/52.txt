Potential Conflicts of Interest

AB Inbev stock options

In May 2012, several Belgian media reported that MEP Jean-Luc Dehaene was allowed to exert about 3 million Euros worth of stock options as a former director of AB Inbev that he failed to mention in his register of financial interests as required by the new code of conduct for members of the European Parliament.[11][12] Friends of the Earth Europe, Corporate Europe Observatory, LobbyControl and SpinWatch of ALTER-EU immediately wrote to the new President of the Parliament Martin Schulz to raise the question of why those stock options were not declared in Mr Dehaene’s declaration of interest dated 28 February 2012. No response has yet been received to this letter.[13]

CEO states that there is the very serious question, "if Mr Dehaene does indeed hold these stock options, of whether they create a risk of a conflict of interest for MEPs who should act independently and in the public interest."[14]
