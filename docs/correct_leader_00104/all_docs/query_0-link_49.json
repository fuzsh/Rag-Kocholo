        "text": "Simac Techniek\n\nSimac was founded on October 1, 1971 by Mac van Schagen. After a career at Philips, at the age of forty-four he took the step to start for himself. From a bedroom of his rental house in Veldhoven he starts as an exclusive representative for Europe of the American Singer Instrumentation.\n\nTo clarify where Simac should be placed in the market, Van Schagen added \"Electronics\" to the name soon after its creation. Since then, his one-man business has grown into a large, privately owned company.\n\nMore than 1300 employees work in offices throughout The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Czech Republic.\n\nSimac in Belgium\n\nIn the eyes of the Americans, the Benelux was one country in those early years. But we knew better. The Dutch prefer to buy their equipment from a Dutch company and Belgians prefer to buy it from a Belgian company. So we started a branch in Belgium in 1972.\n\nThe first office was located in the centre of Brussels, at Rue du Progrès, near Gare du Nord, which was a fairly shady neighbourhood at the time. No worries, Simac thought. Because that’s why the rent was so low.\n\nThe office we rented was long and narrow and was therefore called the ‘Rabbit’s Burrow’. In Belgium, that’s also the name for the long, narrow tunnel for traffic under a watercourse, railway or other obstacles. Another similarity is that there was just as much daylight in the office as in the tunnel: almost none!\n\nIn 1985, we moved to Peutie, north of the ring road. It was Jean-Luc Dehaene, who would later become prime minister of Belgium, who opened the building at the time. In 1997, we also start an office in Leuven. The year 2021 is another great milestone in our history in Belgium. This year, we’ll be opening a beautiful new building in Leuven.\n\nThe company merged with Netbuilding in 1997, forming Simac ICT Belgium, active in network and system integration. Over time, the company has expanded its activities with professional services, cabling & infrastructure and business management solutions.\n\nSimac’s head office is located in Kortenberg, with extra offices in Heverlee, Pulderbos and Bastogne. Today, Simac ICT Belgium employs more than 250 ICT professionals."
