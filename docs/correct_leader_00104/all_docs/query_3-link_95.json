        "text": "\"Van Rompuy\" redirects here. For other uses, see Van Rompuy (disambiguation).\n\nIn this article, the family name is Van Rompuy, not Rompuy.\n\nHerman Achille, Count Van Rompuy (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɦɛrmɑɱ vɑn ˈrɔmpœy]; born 31 October 1947) is a Belgian politician who served as prime minister of Belgium from 2008 to 2009, and then as the first permanent president of the European Council from 2009 to 2014.\n\nA politician from Belgium's Christian Democratic and Flemish party, Van Rompuy served as the 49th prime minister of Belgium from 30 December 2008 until Yves Leterme (who was also his predecessor) succeeded him on 25 November 2009. On 19 November 2009, Van Rompuy was selected by the members of the European Council, which is the institution of the European Union (EU) comprising the heads of state or government of the EU member states, as the first full-time President of that Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. He was appointed for the period 1 December 2009 until 31 May 2012, though he only took up his position officially on 1 January 2010. On 1 March 2012, he was re-elected for a second (and last) term, to last from 1 June 2012 until 30 November 2014. He was appointed chairman of the board of the College of Europe in 2019.\n\nEarly life, career and family\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Etterbeek, Brussels, to Dr. Victor Lodewijk Maurits \"Vic\" van Rompuy (Begijnendijk, 27 February 1923 – Begijnendijk, 14 November 2004), later Professor of Economics, and wife Germaine Geens (Begijnendijk, 1 December 1921 – Begijnendijk, 23 November 2004), he attended Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege in Brussels (until 1965), where Ancient Greek and Latin were his main subjects. During his early teens, he was an avid rock and roll fan, especially of US singer Elvis Presley. Later, he studied at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and received a bachelor's degree in Philosophy (1968), and a master's degree in Applied Economics (1971). He worked at the Belgian Central Bank from 1972 to 1975.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1987, he was a Lecturer at the Handelshogeschool Antwerpen (now Lessius University College); from 1982, he was also a lecturer at the Vlaamse Economische Hogeschool Brussel (VLEKHO later Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel; now University of Leuven Brussels campus).\n\nFamily\n\nVan Rompuy is married to Geertrui Windels, with whom he has four children: Peter (born 1980), Laura (born 1981), Elke (born 1983), and Thomas (born 1986). His eldest son, Peter, is active in the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V) party and stood as a candidate in the Belgian regional elections of 2009.\n\nHis younger brother, Eric Van Rompuy, is also a politician in the CD&V and was a minister in the Flemish Government from 1995 to 1999. His sister, Tine Van Rompuy, is a member of the Workers Party of Belgium. He has another sister, Anita Van Rompuy, who is not politically active, married to Arne van der Graesen.\n\nPolitical career\n\nEarly career\n\nVan Rompuy was the chairman of the national Christian People's Party's (CVP) youth council (1973–1977). From 1975 to 1980, he worked in the ministerial cabinets of Leo Tindemans and Gaston Geens. In 1978 he was elected a member of the national CVP's bureau (1978–present). He first was elected to the Belgian Senate in 1988, and served until 1995. In 1988 he briefly served as Secretary of State for Finance and Small and Medium Enterprises before becoming the national chairman of the CVP (1988–1993).\n\nBelgian Minister of Budget (1993–1999)\n\nVan Rompuy was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget from September 1993 to July 1999, in the two governments led by Jean-Luc Dehaene. As budget minister, together with finance minister Philippe Maystadt, he helped drive down Belgium's debt from a peak of 135% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1993. It fell to below 100% of GDP in 2003.\n\nMember of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives (1995–2009)\n\nHe was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in the 1995 general election, but as he remained a minister, he was barred from taking the seat while holding that office. After his party's defeat in the 1999 Belgian general election, he became a member of the Chamber of Representatives. He was re-elected in 2003 and 2007. In 2004, he was designated Minister of State.\n\nPosition on Turkish accession to the European Union\n\nSee also: Accession of Turkey to the European Union\n\nBefore he was President, Van Rompuy expressed reticence about possible Turkish membership of the EU. In 2004, he stated \"An enlargement [of the EU] with Turkey is not in any way comparable with previous enlargement waves. Turkey is not Europe and will never be Europe.\" He continued \"But it's a matter of fact that the universal values which are in force in Europe, and which are also the fundamental values of Christianity, will lose vigour with the entry of a large Islamic country such as Turkey.\"\n\nAs President, Van Rompuy has avoided opposing Turkish membership of the EU. On 23 December 2010, he said \"Turkish reform efforts have delivered impressive results.\" He continued \"Turkey plays an ever more active role in its neighbourhood. Turkey is also a full-standing member of the G-20, just like five EU countries and the EU itself. In my view, even before an outcome of the negotiations, the European Union should develop a close partnership with the Turkish Republic.\"\n\nPresident of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives (2007–2008)\n\nAfter eight years in opposition, CD&V (formerly known as CVP) returned to government. On 12 July 2007, Van Rompuy was elected as the President of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, succeeding Herman De Croo.\n\nPrime Minister of Belgium\n\nMain article: Van Rompuy Government\n\nOn 28 December 2008, following the 2007–2008 Belgian political crisis, Van Rompuy was asked by King Albert II to form a new government after he was reluctant to take up the role of Prime Minister. He was sworn in as Belgian prime minister on 30 December 2008.\n\nTaxes\n\nOn 13 October 2009, Bloomberg reported that the government of Herman Van Rompuy would seek to tax banks and nuclear power to tame the deficit.\n\nQuote on financial recovery\n\n\"We are in the early stages of a recovery and at this time it is important not to weaken burgeoning confidence and to lay the foundations of a sustainable recovery\" Van Rompuy said in a speech to parliament in Brussels. \"Most important is to keep the direction. That will also provide stability and support.\"\n\nPolicy on government debt\n\nOn 13 October, Bloomberg reported the following about Van Rompuy's Government Debt Policy: \"Belgium will trim its budget deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product in 2011 from almost 5.7% both this year and next, according to a slide presentation handed out by State Secretary for the Budget Melchior Wathelet. Van Rompuy told Parliament earlier today that the deficit would widen to 5.4% of GDP this year. Belgium's deficit will be little changed next year as the shortfall at the level of regional governments and municipalities will widen to 1.5% of GDP from 0.7%, offsetting efforts by the federal government to trim its deficit. Government debt will start exceeding one year's worth of national output as of 2010 , according to European Commission forecasts. Belgium had trimmed debt to as little as 84% of GDP in 2007, before bailouts of Fortis, Dexia SA, KBC Group NV and mutual insurer Ethias Group increased the nation's borrowing costs and inflated the debt ratio to 89.6% at the end of last year.\"\n\nNegotiations and dispute with GDF Suez\n\nOn 22 October 2009, Reuters reported that the Van Rompuy government had signed a commitment with GDF Suez for nuclear power fees to Belgium. The outstanding dispute with GDF concerns the €250 million fee that Belgium is attempting to charge GDF for 2009 as part of its \"Renewable Energy Fund\" as stated in the article: \"Belgium has also charged nuclear producers a total of 250 million euros for 2008, and the same for 2009, as well as 250 million euros this year payable to a renewable energy fund. These fees remain in dispute. The producers are challenging the 2008 payment in Belgium's constitutional court. A spokesman for Van Rompuy said the government would pass a law to enforce the 500 million euro charge for this year, adding that this could also be contested by GDF Suez.\"\n\nPresident of the European Council (2009–2014)\n\nOn 19 November 2009, Van Rompuy was chosen unanimously by the European Council, at an informal meeting in Brussels, to be the first full-time President of the European Council; for the period of 1 December 2009 (the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon) until 31 May 2012. He took up his position officially on 1 January 2010.\n\nGordon Brown also praised Van Rompuy as \"a consensus-builder\" who had \"brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty\". This opinion is shared by others; he has been described as the painstaking builder of impossible compromises (l'horloger des compromis impossibles) A statement made by Van Rompuy at a news conference after his selection illustrates his approach:\n\nEvery country should emerge victorious from negotiations. A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation. I will consider everyone's interests and sensitivities. Even if our unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth.\" He has also described his role of chairing a body composed of 27 heads of state or government (and finding consensus among them) as being \"neither a spectator, nor a dictator, but a facilitator\n\nGiven Van Rompuy’s support for Europe and opposition to far right, not all parties and factions had positive words for him when he took office. British MEP and Eurosceptic Nigel Farage attacked the freshly appointed president by stating that he had \"the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk.\" The remarks generated controversy and he was fined €3000 (ten days' pay) by the President (Speaker) of the European Parliament for his unparliamentary comments.\n\nIn a November 2009 press conference, Van Rompuy related to global governance by stating: \"2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of a financial crisis; the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.\" Van Rompuy referred to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009.\n\nOn 28 January 2010, Van Rompuy attended the 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan at Lancaster House in London. It was at this event that the framework for the next decade of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was settled by the Afghan president Hamid Karzai and his successor Ashraf Ghani and their donors. As seen at right, Gordon Brown, Hillary Clinton, Catherine Ashton and Anders Fogh Rasmussen amongst other Western leaders were in attendance.\n\nIn or just before the first months of his presidency Van Rompuy visited all EU member states, he also organised an informal meeting of the heads of state of the EU. The meeting took place on 11 February 2010, in the Solvay Library (Brussels), topics to be discussed were the future direction of the economic policies of the EU, the outcome of the Copenhagen Conference and the then recent earthquake in Haiti.\n\nIn fact, the meeting was in part taken over by the growing sovereign debt crisis (at that time, Greece), which was to become the hall mark of Van Rompuy's first two years as President. With EU member states holding divergent positions on this issue, he had to find compromises, not least between France and Germany, at subsequent European Council meetings and summits of Eurozone heads of state or government leading to the establishment of the three-year European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in May 2010, to provide loans to Greece (and later Ireland and Portugal) to help stabilise their borrowing costs, but subject to strict conditions.\n\nThe European Council also gave him the assignment of chairing a task force on economic governance, composed of personal representatives (mostly ministers of finance) of the heads of government, which reported ahead of schedule to the October 2010 European Council. Its report, which proposed stronger macro-economic co-ordination within the EU in general and the Eurozone in particular and also a tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact was endorsed by the European Council. The latter also charged him with preparing, by December 2010, a proposal for a limited change to the Treaty required to enable a more permanent financial stability mechanism. His draft – for an addition to Article 136 TFEU, pertaining to the Eurozone – was endorsed by the European Council at its October 2010 meeting.\n\nHis second year in office, 2011, was also marked by a deterioration of the Greek debt crisis, leading to Van Rompuy calling an extraordinary meeting of the Eurozone heads of state or government in July to adopt a first package of further measures (notably longer term loans at lower interest rates, private sector debt-writedown, further fiscal consolidation in Greece) and again in October (in conjunction with full European Council meetings) to contain contagion from Greece to other countries (through bank recapitalisation across Europe and by leveraging the firepower of the EFSF to about €1 trillion).\n\nHis first two years were also marked by his role in co-ordinating European positions on the world stage at G8 and G20 summits and bilateral summits, such as the tense 5 October 2010, EU-China summit. He called a special European Council at short notice in early 2011, on the emerging Libya crisis, which, in agreeing conditions for military intervention, made it impossible for Germany to oppose such intervention once the conditions were fulfilled.\n\nOn 1 March 2012, Van Rompuy was re-elected unanimously as President of the European Council by the heads of state or government of the 28 EU member states. President Van Rompuy's second term lasted for two and a half years, from 1 June 2012 to 30 November 2014. After this second mandate he could not have been re-elected because the European Council President's term of office can only be extended once.\n\nVan Rompuy was also appointed as the first President of the Euro Summit, and this for the same term of office as his Presidency of the European Council. The Euro Summit meetings are to take place at least twice a year.\n\nIn 2014, Van Rompuy was awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for his EU role.\n\nPresident's cabinet\n\nAlthough the European Council is, under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, a separate institution of the EU, it does not have its own administration. The administrative support for both the European Council and its president is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe president does have, however, his own private office (cabinet) of close advisers.
