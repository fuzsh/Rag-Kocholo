        "text": "On 4 October 1991, the centre-left coalition Government headed by Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and comprising the French- and Flemish-speaking branches of the Christian Social (PSC and CVP) and Socialist (PS and SP) parties, as well as the Flemish nationalist Volksunie, collapsed over issues with underlying conflict along linguistic and regional lines. Three days later, the election date was set.\n\nAs could be expected, the electoral campaign entailed inter-community quarrelling but also debate on economic questions (budget deficit, public debt) and immigration policy in particular. The outgoing coalition partners were confronted above all by the French and Flemish Liberal parties (PRL and PVV). Due largely to the country’s linguistic divide, a proliferation of groups fielded candidates.\n\nPolling day was marked by a strong protest vote against the traditional parties, as all but PVV lost seats to environmentalist and far-right groups, especially Ecolo and Vlaams Blok. The result was seen as reflecting popular disillusionment with the perennial feuding of the mainstream parties. While the CVP and Socialists retained their respective positions as largest single party and bloc in Parliament, the outgoing coalition (excluding Volksunie) had their overall Representatives total drop by 14 seats to 120.\n\nGiven this outcome, formation of a new Government inevitably took time, during which Mr. Martens - Prime Minister almost continuously since 1979 - stayed in office in a caretaker capacity. Finally, on 6 March 1992, a Flemish Christian Democrat, Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene, agreed to lead a new governing coalition, thus ending more than 100 days of political crisis; he was appointed Prime Minister the next day. As before, the new Cabinet comprised CVP, PS, SP and PSC, members."
