As Prime Minister of Belgium, he pushed through crucial social, constitutional and economic reforms to transform Belgium and improve its peoples’ lives. Mr Dehaene also played a key role in drafting the EU’s constitutional treaty, and served with distinction as a Member of the European Parliament.\n\nMr Dehaene was a friend of Singapore. He was the first Belgian Prime Minister to visit our country, and helped to strengthen our bilateral ties during his time in office.\n\nOur thoughts are with his family and the people of Belgium during this time of mourning.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\n\nHE Mr Elio Di Rupo\n\nPrime Minister\n\nKingdom of Belgium\n\n--\n\n19 May 2014\n\nMrs Celie Dehaene\n\nKingdom of Belgium\n\nDear Mrs Dehaene\n\nI was saddened to learn of the passing of your husband, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene.\n\nI had the privilege of meeting Mr Dehaene on several occasions when I was Prime Minister, in and outside Belgium. I especially appreciated the warm hospitality shown by both of you during my visit to Belgium in 1996.\n\nMr Dehaene contributed tirelessly to Belgium and to Europe. He was a friend of Singapore and helped to enhance relations between our two countries.\n\nI offer my heartfelt condolences to you and your family during this difficult time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGOH CHOK TONG\n\n. . . . ."
