        "text": "By Charlemagne\n\nONE OF the great bull-elephants of European politics announced his retirement this week. Jean-Luc Dehaene, a former prime minister of Belgium and leading light in Euro-federalist circles, would not normally be of much interest outside his own country. But an interview given today to the Belgian newspaper, Le Soir, offers an interesting answer to two questions that nag at every foreigner who lives in Belgium. One: why are there so many petty rules and regulations in this country? Two: for a country with so many petty rules and regulations, why are there quite so many dog turds on the pavements? If you have not been to Brussels, do not sigh and turn away, imagining this is a facetious point. The \"crottes de chiens\" crisis in this capital of Europe is dramatic, and baffling. This is an educated prosperous country, where people let their dogs foul your doorstep, the middle of pavements (sidewalks), the paths in parks and children's playgrounds. His explanation is worth listening to: it neatly traces a line linking society's growing individualism to its litigiousness (Belgium is very litigious), and the modern world's mania for passing endless new laws, that many like to blame on politicians. Forget it, growls Mr Dehaene. The nanny state is the fault of voters."
