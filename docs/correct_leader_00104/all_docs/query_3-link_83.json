        "text": "Clinton praises Mitterand as 'man of vision'\n\n'Great statesman is gone;' simple funeral planned\n\nJanuary 8, 1996\n\nWeb posted at: 6:40 p.m. EST (2340 GMT)\n\nPARIS (CNN) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton joined world leaders Monday in praising the late Francois Mitterrand as a man of historic stature for his vision of a united Europe.\n\n\"Not only France, but the United States and the entire world benefited from his strong and principled leadership,\" Clinton said. \"He stood shoulder to shoulder with his NATO allies during the Soviet challenges of the early 1980s, the Gulf War, and the peaceful revolutions that ended a half century of East-West confrontation.\"\n\nThe president said that he \"greatly valued (Mitterand's) insights, advice and wisdom,\" and said the late French president \"was a man of vision whose strength helped bring Europe and West ... to the undivided Europe we are building today.\"\n\nOpinion polls have shown Mitterand was the most respected president in France since Charles de Gaulle, the wartime resistance leader. Socialist Mitterrand, in office from 1981 until eight months ago, died Monday at age 79 after a long fight with prostate cancer.\n\n\"Europe has lost a great statesman. I mourn for a good friend.\"\n\n-- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl\n\nMitterrand will be buried Thursday in a family tomb at Jarnac, his birthplace in southwestern France, close friend Georges Kiejman said. Kiejman, a former justice minister, said Mitterrand had not wanted a state funeral, but a ceremony would be held in Paris on the same day to enable the public to pay tribute to France's longest-serving president. However, there would be no speeches at the burial itself, Kiejman said.\n\nAlthough the ex-president's wife, Danielle, said in September he had acquired a burial plot on Mont Beuvray in central France, Jarnac Mayor Maurice Voiron said Monday that Mitterrand had told him last March that \"he always planned to be buried in Jarnac.\" The burial would be \"in the strictest intimacy ... just his family and a few close friends,\" Kiejman said.\n\nA leader for European unity\n\n\"Over 14 years, Mr. Mitterrand wrote an important page in the history of our country,\" said Jacques Chirac, Mitterrand's prime minister a decade ago and his successor as president last year. \"A great figure has left us and I salute him with emotion and with respect.\" Chirac's office had no immediate information on state commemorations or possible foreign guests.\n\nGermany -- at war with France earlier in the century -- praised Mitterrand as a leader whose vision of a united Europe would continue to shape the continent's future. \"Europe has lost a great statesman in Francois Mitterrand. I mourn for a good friend,\" Chancellor Helmut Kohl, another champion of European unity, said in a written statement. \"For many years we worked together closely and trustingly to shape Europe and to deepen German-French friendship. ... Francois Mitterrand was a great patriot and European. His political vision of a united Europe will be legacy and stimulus for us in the future as well.\"\n\n\"German-French ties under Mitterrand became a formative factor in the European unification process,\" added German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. And European Commission President Jacques Santer said Mitterrand's presidency proved \"exceptionally fertile for European integration.\" Santer, as prime minister of Luxembourg, worked closely with Mitterrand on European unity.\n\n\"A great statesman is gone,\" said Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson. \"(Mitterrand's) influence in promoting European integration can not be emphasized enough.\" Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said Mitterrand had done the whole of Europe an enormous service. \"It is thanks to the Franco-German cooperation he maintained with Chancellor Kohl that during his 14 years in office such enormous progress has been made in Europe,\" Dehaene said.\n\nReaction from outside Europe\n\nFormer U.S. President George Bush recalled Mitterrand as a man of principle and a dependable ally during the 1991 Gulf War, despite France's former close ties with Iraq. \"When push came to shove, when things got really difficult and I needed to talk to him about a problem that we had and needed his support on something critical -- obviously Desert Storm leads the list -- he would stand with us,\" Bush said.\n\nMargaret Thatcher, a conservative whose 11 years as Britain's prime minister largely coincided with Mitterrand's 14 years as France's Socialist head of state, said that \"by his bearing and his culture, he came to symbolize for the rest of the world something of the essential France.\" Her successor, John Major, said that \"Francois Mitterrand ... made an outstanding contribution to public life.\"\n\nIn Australia, where Chirac caused widespread fury by resuming the South Pacific nuclear tests that Mitterrand had halted, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating called the late president \"a great human being ... France's last wise imperial figure.\". Philippine President Fidel Ramos stressed the nuclear issue: \"Those of us in Asia and the Pacific will always remember him for his decision to stop French testing of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nRelated story\n\nMitterrand dead at 79\n\nRelated sites\n\nFrancois Mitterrand: The paths to power Jean-Luc Dehaene Margaret Thatcher\n\n| CONTENTS | SEARCH | CNN HOME PAGE | MAIN WORLD NEWS PAGE |\n\nCopyright 1996 Cable News Network, Inc.
