        "text": "Wilfried Martens, the former Belgian prime minister, who has died aged 77, presided over a series of centre-right coalition governments in Brussels contemporaneously with Margaret Thatcher in Britain, and lasted in power for 12 years, even longer than she did. A dominant force in Belgian politics, he headed nine administrations between 1979 and 1991 with only one eight-month break out of power. He was appointed prime minister at 42, the youngest in the country's history, and became the longest-serving Belgian prime minister since the second world war.\n\nThatcher and Martens were hardly ideological soulmates and he incurred her wrath, lasting resentment and a slighting reference to \"a certain Mr Martens\" in her autobiography after a junior functionary from one of the coalition minority parties, briefly in charge at a ministry one weekend, refused to sell ammunition to Britain during the Falklands war.\n\nFor his part, Martens expressed himself shocked in his autobiography at her response when, at a summit, he told her how much he enjoyed listening to the BBC's weekend classical music concerts. \"She wondered how a prime minister could find the time for such distractions and anyway did not know that the BBC had this type of music in its programmes. I replied that a man, whatever his work, must be able to be detached.\"\n\nMartens faced problems Thatcher never had, in keeping Belgium's fissiparous coalitions – not only left and right but Flemish and Walloon – even marginally together, a difficulty shown increasingly in recent years when it has proved all but impossible for Belgium's politicians to form a national government at all. After his fall from government in 1992, Martens, an archetypal machine politician, pursued a wily career at the European People's party in the European parliament, leading the centre-right grouping for five years, from 1994 to 1999. A co-founder of the EPP, he served as its president from 1990 until a few days before his death.\n\nMartens regarded his identification with the bourgeois Belgian man in the street – comfortable, complacent, anxious to compromise – as crucial to his political success, writing: \"You can't be prime minister in Belgium, you can't be a political star unless you have in you the profile of the population. I have been reading that I am not a charismatic leader – that's true, I think.\n\n\"But I also think I have the profile of the Belgians. It's a working population. A form of modesty is important ... You can't say, 'I'll try to think like a Belgian.' You have it or you haven't.\"\n\nHe was, however, a cunning political operator, as he needed to be in the quagmire of Belgian coalition politics, and one who made sure he stuck close to the dominant figure of the European centre-right in the 1990s, Germany's Helmut Kohl. The chancellor knew his worth, but appeared to treat him with genial contempt, even in public.\n\nMartens was born on the family farm near Ghent in Flanders and grew up during the German occupation in the second world war and in some poverty following the early death of his father. Ghent remained his powerbase and he made political capital of returning there each evening rather than staying in the prime ministerial residence in the capital. His ability was spotted by the village priest and a local teacher, who encouraged the young man to attend university. He trained as a lawyer and, fired with Flemish nationalism, joined the regional Christian Democratic party, rising rapidly through the ranks.\n\nMartens was catapulted into the premiership in April 1979 (a month before Thatcher's electoral triumph in Britain) after only five years in parliament and without holding any previous ministerial office, as the result of an eight-month political crisis following the resignation of his one-time mentor and later rival Leo Tindemans. More senior colleagues to whom he had recently been a junior political adviser suddenly found him in charge.\n\nThe crisis was the result of fundamental divisions between the coalition government's Socialist and Christian Democrat parties over how to tackle economic problems, a burgeoning welfare deficit and the long-term decline of Belgium's traditional heavy industries. This, together with growing tensions over the country's regional and linguistic divide between Flemish and French speakers, formed long-running threads in his premiership and resulted in the sequence of shifting coalition allegiances over which Martens presided, as he came to be seen as the indispensable leader, the only man capable of holding factional governments together.\n\nHe achieved this balancing act with skill – not least in the face of opposition from some more senior ex-prime ministers – though King Baudouin must have become used to his regular trips to the palace to offer his resignation.\n\nMartens maintained that he managed to bring the economic crisis and high unemployment levels – proportionately even higher than Britain's – under control without resorting to Thatcherite deflation. The language tensions remained more intractable. On one occasion a government crisis was precipitated by the refusal of the francophone mayor of a largely French-speaking village in Flanders to take an examination to prove to the authorities that he could conduct meetings, as required by law, in Flemish. The mayor could, but with true Belgian obduracy refused to do so, bringing down the national government in the resulting row.\n\nAlthough the country eventually moved towards a federal constitutional settlement in 1993, giving each language group its own parliament, by the time Martens left office the far-right, separatist Flemish party Vlaams Blok (later disbanded for violating anti-racist legislation and reforming as Vlaams Belang) was already making electoral headway in the north of the country.\n\nAbroad, Martens was regarded with suspicion as leading a flaky government by others apart from Thatcher. He delayed (though eventually accepted) the deployment of US cruise missiles on Belgian soil and refused to join the coalition gathering for the Gulf war. Martens claimed that Belgium's promised F-16 fighters were not ready, but the exasperated allies suspected it was more a matter of preserving his latest coalition partners in government.\n\nBelgian society suffered several blows during his premiership. The Heysel stadium disaster in Brussels in 1985, in which 39 people were killed in a stampede before the Liverpool-Juventus European Cup final, brought down one of his governments.\n\nAnd there were a series of criminal crises, most notably that of the killers of Brabant, a masked gang that shot up a series of supermarkets, killing a number of shoppers over a period of years. Those responsible were never caught by an incompetent police force, one reason for which may have been that the raids were suspected of being carried out by off-duty police officers, and this contributed to a growing climate of sleaze and corruption. Martens was not personally responsible for this, but could plausibly be seen as the central figure in a too-cosy and complacent establishment which allowed such an atmosphere to flourish, a man lacking political vision but good at private deal-making in smoke-filled rooms.\n\nMartens was married three times, first to Lieve Vershroeven, then to Ilse Schouteden, and then in 2008 to Miet Smet, a former Belgian minister, who survives him, along with five children."
