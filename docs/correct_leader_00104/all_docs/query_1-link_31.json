        "text": "The death of Jean-Luc Dehaene, the former Belgian prime minister who has headed Uefa's financial fair play investigations, may cause a delay to the case surrounding Manchester City's breach of the FFP rules.\n\nDehaene, 73, had been suffering from cancer but died following a fall in France, according to media reports in Belgium. Dehaene was chairman of the Club Football Control Body (CFCB) and it is understood he had been struggling with his illness during recent weeks. He still took an active role in the investigations and had been kept updated with all the documentation.\n\nCity have been made a settlement offer of sanctions including a Â£49m fine payable over three years, reduction in their Champions League squad from 25 to 21 players, eight of which must be home-trained, and a wage freeze on that squad.\n\nCity had argued the sanctions were too harsh and a final decision from the CFCB is still pending.\n\nDehaene was an important politician in Europe.He helped set up the European Union's constitution and led his nation during the 1990s.\n\nBelgium's current Prime Minister, Elio Di Rupo, said the country \"had lost an exceptional statesman. Jean-Luc was a special companion.\""
