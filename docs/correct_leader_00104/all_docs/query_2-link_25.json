But another, relatively less well-known member has, it seems, emerged as the one to watch.\n\nStep forward, Giorgios Katiforis, representative of Greece, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency. According to ‘our man on the inside of the praesidium’, Katiforis is a bit of a dark horse. “He doesn’t say a great deal,” says our mole, “but when he does, everyone sits up and takes notice.”"
