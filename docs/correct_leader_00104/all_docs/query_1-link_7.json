        "text": "BRUSSELS — Former prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who worked as hard to keep his linguistically divided nation together as he did to give Europe more unity, died Thursday at the age of 73.\n\nMr. Dehaene, a Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat, had been diagnosed with cancer this year, but died following a fall in France, his party said.\n\nBelgium has lost ‘‘an exceptional statesman,’’ Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said Thursday. ‘‘Jean-Luc was a special companion.’’\n\nAs Belgian prime minister from 1992 to 1999, Mr. Dehaene pushed through constitutional changes to turn a nation of 6.5 million Dutch-speakers and 4.5 million French-speakers into a federal state with sizable amounts of regional autonomy.\n\nHe also made sure Belgium would become a founding member of the common-currency eurozone despite a massive national debt.\n\nAfter he lost the 1999 elections, he turned his focus on Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had been key in brokering an EU constitution but after referendums in two member states rejected it, many parts of the plan were taken up by the treaty of Lisbon that currently sets policy for the 28-nation EU.\n\n‘‘It made me proud,’’ he said.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
