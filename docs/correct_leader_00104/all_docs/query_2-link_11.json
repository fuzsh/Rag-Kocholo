He returned to Brussels in 1986 to take up several important functions in European Affairs, including within the Permanent Representation of Belgium to the EU. He was also directly involved in several negotiations on revision of the European Treaties (Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice, and Lisbon). He received a second assignment in Rome where he handled political and economic issues (1992-1995). After his stay as Deputy Permanent Representative in New York at the United Nations (1995-2000) and his involvement in the establishment of the International Criminal Court (1998), he was appointed coordinator of the Belgian Presidency of the European Union in 2001 and headed for some years the Department of European Coordination and Integration in the Foreign Ministry in Brussels. He assisted Jean Luc Dehaene as Vice President of the Convention on the future of the European Union. He remained Permanent Representative of Belgium to the Political and Security Committee of the EU (2003-2006), where the EU’s common foreign and security policy was initially shaped under the leadership of J. Solana. In 2009 he was called to the office of Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as his diplomatic advisor and Sherpa. For two years he was an active Chief of Staff to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (2010-2011), being involved in a successful EU-Presidency of his country (2010), as well as in key Foreign Policy decisions on Afghanistan and Libya. He served as Permanent Representative of Belgium to the European Union from 2011 to 2016. Afterwards, he became the Belgian Ambassador to the United States of America (2016-2020). Currently, Wouters is Advisor to the Belgian Royal Family, organizing trade missions abroad.
