        "text": "Swept out of office by voters angry at a succession of scandals, Belgium's veteran prime minister said yesterday he was leaving national politics. Now Jean-Luc Dehaene could be appointed a European Union commissioner.\n\n\"I think it's time to start doing other things. I was not born into politics and I will certainly not die in it,\" said Mr Dehaene, who has been prime minister since 1991 and was blocked from taking the commission presidency four years ago by John Major's veto. He added that he took full responsibility for the defeat of his Socialist party in Sunday's poll.\n\nHis fate was sealed by voters outraged in the last fortnight by the revelation that the government had concealed information about contamination of animal feed by dioxin, which is carcinogenic.\n\nThe food scare was the final blow after previous scandals involving bribery and corruption in the Socialist party and the incompetence of police and judicial investigations into child abductions and murders.\n\nWith Belgian meat and poultry products banned throughout Europe and many parts of the world - at an estimated cost to the country so far of £500m - attempts to cobble together a new coalition could take months.\n\nThe electorate inflicted a shattering defeat on the two parties that have shared power in various combinations for most of the century in Belgium, the Socialists and the Christian Democrats.\n\nNow the business-oriented rightwing Liberal party, which has not governed alone since the 1880s, will have to try to reach agreement with the anti-capitalist Flemish and Francophone Green parties to form an administration.\n\nThe electorate reacted to the scandals by doubling the Greens' share of the vote, switching to the opposition Liberals and, in Flanders, voting heavily for the racist, anti-immigration Vlaams Blok; the Blok gained nearly as many votes as the Socialist party in the Flemish north.\n\nPhilippe Busquin, the Francophone Socialist party boss, said: \"It is clearly a defeat for all the parties in power. The government has malfunctioned. Governing this country is becoming more and more difficult.\"\n\nThe eventual coalition may even have to bring in Mr Dehaene's discredited Christian Democrats to secure a parliamentary majority.\n\nWrangling over who should be prime minister may take even longer in Belgium's multilayered political system than settling which coalitions will run the French- and Dutch-speaking regional parliaments. The ensuing power vacuum could increase the country's separatist tendencies.\n\nThe possible candidates emerging yesterday were Guy Verhofstadt, the Thatcherite Flemish leader of the Liberals; Louis Michel, the Francophone Liberal leader; and the Flemish liberal Marc Verwilghen, who shot to national popularity two years ago chairing a parliamentary inquiry into the paedophile scandal.\n\nObservers believe that whatever coalition emerges is likely to collapse rapidly, particularly if the minority parties press for constitutional change to increase regional autonomy.\n\nThomas Tindemans, a political consultant and son of a former prime minister, said: \"The voters have reacted in an adult way by punishing those who have screwed up the country.\n\n\"We have never seen anything like this before - it is a political earthquake. The clear message is that public health and food safety are at the top of voters' agenda, but the problem is that any government which emerges is likely to be too weak and divided to be able to react effectively.\"\n\n The Christian Socialist coalition government of Luxembourg's prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, also resigned yesterday after a general election, but he is likely to form a new administration without socialist support."
