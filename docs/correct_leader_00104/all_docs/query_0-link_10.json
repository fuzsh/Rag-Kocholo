        "text": "On Tuesday 6 October 2015 the College of Europe honoured Mr Jean-Luc DEHAENE, who was President of the Administrative Council from 2000 until 2009. Mr Jean-Luc DEHAENE actively contributed to the development of the College of Europe. His legacy includes the Verversdijk complex of the Bruges campus. In 2000 he decided to start the renovation of the Verversdijk site and to finance the project mainly by fundraising. To honour the services he rendered to the College of Europe, a scholarship called ‘Jean-Luc Dehaene’ has been created for a period of seven years. This scholarship is kindly supported by the companies AB Inbev, Lotus Bakeries, and Umicore and was awarded for this academic year to Mrs Vitaline COPAY.\n\nThis full scholarship will give the possibility to one Belgian student each year for the next seven years to follow postgraduate studies at the College of Europe. The selection process and the choice of the student benefitting from this scholarship will be conducted entirely by the College of Europe and does not require any individual application process from the potential students. The choice will be made on the basis of merit.\n\nFor further information about all possible scholarships please consult our scholarship pages."
