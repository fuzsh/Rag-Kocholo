        "text": "1998 Scores\n\nStatus: Free\n\nFreedom Rating: 1.5\n\nCivil Liberties: 2\n\nPolitical Rights: 1\n\nOverview\n\nBelgium continued to be plagued by political scandals, ethnic tensions, and decreased confidence in its government, judiciary, and police forces. Two ministers in the government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene resigned over the brief escape of Marc Dutroux, the country's most notorious criminal. Dutroux's escape, however, did prompt the four center-left government coalition parties and four major opposition parties to agree to restructure the criminal justice system. Under their agreement, the federal police will be unified, and a single police force will operate at the district level. Other police units will be abolished.\n\nIn September, 12 politicians and businessmen, including former NATO Secretary General Willy Claes and two other Socialist Party ministers, were put on trial for corruption. Italian and French aircraft companies are alleged to have won lucrative Belgian military contracts by making large cash \"gifts\" to the Socialist Party. Belgium had outlawed corporate contributions to political parties five years earlier.\n\nAt the same time, the country faced increased ethnic and linguistic tensions between its Walloons, who worry that they are losing their identity, and Flemings, who are calling for a confederated or separate state. In September, Standard and Poor's warned that political uncertainty caused by these tensions poses short-term risks to Belgium's economy.\n\nModern Belgium dates from 1830, when the territory broke away from the Netherlands and formed a constitutional monarchy. Today, the largely ceremonial monarchy symbolizes the weakness of Belgian unity. Ethnic and linguistic antagonism during the 1960s prompted a series of constitutional amendments, in 1970-71 and 1993, that devolved power to regional councils at the expense of the central government in Brussels. A 1993 amendment formally transformed the country into a federation of Flanders, Wallonia, and bilingual Brussels, with the German-speaking area accorded cultural autonomy. Also in 1993, parliament adopted an amendment establishing three directly-elected regional assemblies with primary responsibility for housing, transportation, public works, education, culture and the environment. The weak central government continues to oversee foreign policy, defense, justice, monetary policy, taxation, and the management of the budget deficit.\n\nPolitical parties are split along linguistic lines, with both Walloon and Flemish parties ranging across the political spectrum. Numerous small ethnic parties and special interest groups have emerged, leading to a decline in the dominance of the three major groupings of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and Liberals.\n\nPolitical Rights and Civil Liberties\n\nBelgians can change their government democratically. Non-voters are subject to fines. Political parties generally organize along ethnic lines, with different factions of the leading parties subscribing to a common platform for general elections. Each ethnic group has autonomy in its region, but constitutional disputes arise when members of one group elected to office in a different territory refuse to take competency tests in the dominant language of that region.\n\nThe country's judiciary is independent, but has continued to experience criticism due to the country's ongoing political and criminal scandals.\n\nWhile freedom of speech and the press is guaranteed, Belgian law prohibits some forms of pornography as well as incitements to violence. Libel laws have some minor restraining effects on the press, and restrictions on the right of civil servants to criticize the government may constitute a slight reduction of the right of civil speech. Autonomous public boards govern the state television and radio networks and ensure that public broadcasting is linguistically pluralistic. The state has permitted and licensed independent radio stations since 1985.\n\nBelgians enjoy freedom of religion and association. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim institutions are state-subsidized in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, and other faiths are not restricted. Immigrants and linguistic minorities argue that linguistic zoning limits opportunity.\n\nBelgium has enacted measures to promote sexual equality, including the prohibition of sexual harassment. Legislation mandates that, in the next general parliamentary election, 33 percent of the candidates be women. Approximately 60 percent of the work force are members of labor unions, which have the right to strike – one that they frequently exercise – even in \"essential\" services."
