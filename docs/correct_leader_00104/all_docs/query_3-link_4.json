        "text": "Jean-Luc Dehaene, who has died aged 73, was the Flemish Christian Democrat Prime Minister of Belgium whose hopes of succeeding Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission were shot down by John Major in 1994 because he was regarded as too much of a federalist.\n\nMajor’s triumph was short-lived, however, as the man who was eventually appointed, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, soon swept away any idea that he was any less federalist than Dehaene by calling for stronger social legislation and closer integration and criticising the British veto.\n\nAlthough Major’s action boosted Dehaene’s standing in Belgium, he never fully forgave the British. A photograph which had pride of place in his office featured himself and Lady Thatcher at a ceremony to celebrate the Channel Tunnel, with Thatcher perched on the edge of her seat next to the rotund Flemish federalist, slumped beside her, fast asleep. As a consequence of Major’s veto he was left to serve another five years as head of government of an almost ungovernable state riven by bitter language divisions.\n\nKnown to his supporters as “the Plumber” and to his foes as “the Bulldozer”, Dehaene, who became Belgium’s Prime Minister in 1992 and was reelected in 1995, was an archetypal political operator with a remarkable skill for extracting compromise from the most unpromising situations.\n\nIn 1993 he won near-universal praise for the astute manner in which Belgium piloted the EU presidency through the Maastricht Treaty and Gatt world trade crises. On the domestic front, to everyone’s surprise, he constructed a coalition government from the bickering Flemish and Walloon politicians who had fought the 1991 election. But although he largely succeeded in keeping Belgium’s tribes from each other’s throats by a constitutional settlement that aimed to be fair to both sides, in the process he made decision-making virtually impossible. In the latter half of his time in office, Dehaene came under pressure for his handling of a series of scandals which eventually led to his being driven from office.\n\nThese began in 1996 when the discovery of child kidnapping and murder on an almost industrial scale by the Charleroi builder Marc Dutroux (who had already served time in jail for abducting and raping young girls) almost brought down the government. There was a wave of public outrage when it was revealed that even though Dutroux’s house had been under surveillance — and had been searched three times — two eight-year-old girls locked in a cell in his basement were not discovered in time and starved to death.\n\nIn October 1996, amid rumours that Dutroux had been, or was being, protected by members of the establishment, 300,000 Belgians marched in protest through Brussels. Public indignation flared up again in April 1998 when Dutroux briefly escaped from custody while being transferred to a courthouse without handcuffs, leading several ministers, and the country’s head of police, to resign as a consequence.\n\nDehaene survived — just — but faith in the Belgian political establishment was further eroded by corruption scandals involving former government ministers such as Willy Claes, who was convicted in 1998 of taking bribes for helicopter contracts while Nato secretary-general, and by the publication, in 1999, of a report by a think tank which exposed a culture of clientelism and corruption in high places. Among other things the report stated that the region of Wallonia was being run “like a banana republic” in which state employees were “the puppets of politicians and are hired in violation of the principle of equal rights”. In Brussels, it found that supposedly open public examinations had been rigged.\n\nDahaene’s chances of returning to office were dealt a mortal blow when, shortly before the country went to the polls in June 1999, it was revealed that cancer-causing dioxins had been found in Belgian animal feed, leading the European Commission to issue a warning that Belgian eggs, poultry, pork, beef and dairy products might be contaminated. As countries all over the world imposed bans on imports of Belgian food, Dehaene’s Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition government was widely accused of trying to cover up the food scare until after the elections, while members of the 3.3 million-strong French-speaking Walloon community accused Dehaene of sacrificing the national interest to protect the profits of large Flemish farms to the north. Both the health minister and the agriculture minister, who had known about the contamination since April, resigned when the matter became public.\n\nOn the eve of the polls, Dehaene assured voters that the crisis was over, calling for voters to “demonstrate chauvinism” and buy home-produced food as it was reintroduced into the shops. But the dioxin scandal, known as “Chickengate”, proved one crisis too many. Big gains by Greens, Liberals and far-right parties forced Dehaene’s departure. Despite the humiliation, Dehaene put on a brave face. “I was not born in politics and I will certainly not die in it,” he declared as he handed his resignation to King Albert II .“I always slept well, including last night, so don’t worry about me, I will have no problem.”\n\nJean-Luc Dehaene was born on August 7 1940 in Montpellier into a sophisticated and affluent family from the Flemish city of Bruges. At the time of his birth his parents were in the south of France fleeing the German invasion. His family expected him to become a doctor or a priest, as was the family tradition, and this expectation made for a less than happy childhood. Meal times revolved, he said, around discussions of “illness, death and the state of men’s souls”.\n\nHe was educated at a private Jesuit school — a period that triggered his rebellion against his background and launched an interest in politics (while at school he joined the Olivaint Conference, a French student society which aims to prepare its members for public life).\n\nBelgian media often put Dehaene’s casual appearance and colourful language down to a rejection of his privileged upbringing. He was raised speaking both French and Flemish — commentators claimed that he spoke the former with a bad accent to appeal to his Flemish constituency.\n\nHe began his political life through the General Christian Workers’ Union (Algemeen Christelijk Werknemersverbond), a trade union linked to the Christian People’s Party (Christelijke Volkspartij). In 1981 he was made Minister of Social Affairs and Institutional Reform, a post he held until 1988 when he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications and Institutional Reform. In 1992 he began his two terms as Prime Minister.\n\nOn his defeat in 1999, Guy Verhofstadt’s Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) formed the first Belgian government without the Christian Democrats since 1958. Dehaene remained a senator until 2001 — and successfully won seats in the European Parliament in the 2004 and 2009 elections — after which he took on a series of roles in national and regional politics and within the business and sports sectors.\n\nHe became mayor of Vilvoorde, a city near Brussels, and joined the board of directors of Lernout & Hauspie, a speech-recognition technology company. The firm went bankrupt in 2001 due to a fraud engineered by the firm’s management. That year Dehaene became vice-president of the Convention on the Future of Europe.\n\nHe acted as mediator as a new government was being formed after the 2007 Belgian elections and his interest in football — he was often seen cheering enthusiastically at matches and enjoying post-game drinks — led to a role as chief enforcer of financial fair play at Uefa.\n\nIn October 2008 he became chairman of the Belgian-French Dexia Bank, with a brief to lead the company through its difficulties caused by the credit crunch.\n\nDehaene took a relaxed approach to sartorial matters. In July 2013 he was interrupted by a telephone call while enjoying a lunchtime barbecue at his home in Vilvoorde. He was meant to be at a television debate on the forthcoming abdication of King Albert II. Dehaene dashed to the studios and conducted the debate in a “salmon shirt, checked Bermuda shorts, sandals and a healthy glow”. One style guru conceded that at least he avoided socks with sandals.\n\nAt the time of his death he was vice-chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets. He chose not to stand for the 2014 European elections, however. “I did two mandates here, that’s a good period,” he said in January. “I’ll be 74 in June so it’s a good time to stop.”\n\nDehaene married Celie Verbeke, with whom he published a personal selection of recipes, Cooking With Celie (2005). She survives him with their four children."
