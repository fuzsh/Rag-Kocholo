        "text": "European Union leaders failed to break a deadlock early Saturday over who should become the EU's chief executive, despite two attempts to resolve the issue.\n\nBut Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene appeared to be far ahead of his chief rival, Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers.\"There's no decision,\" said Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds after a confusing series of events that saw leaders rushing back and forth between their hotels and the site of a summit dinner.\n\n\"Nothing is clear at all,\" Reynolds told reporters.\n\nHe said efforts would resume later Saturday to settle on a choice to replace French Socialist Jacques Delors, whose term as president of the executive agency, the European Commission, expires next January.\n\n\"It's clear that Dehaene is in the lead,\" said Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen. \"He's clearly the favorite.\"\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans said earlier, however, that his country was ready to block a decision. The choice in the 12-nation EU is by consensus.\n\nGreek officials counted 10 nations in Dehaene's camp, with only one nation backing Lubbers, and another one for Sir Leon Brittan, a former British Cabinet minister who now is a member of the EU executive agency.\n\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer said, though, that only one formal vote was taken, and Dehaene got eight votes and Lubbers, three.\n\nShortly after midnight, the leaders left the posh Achilleion, site of their working dinner. They told reporters they could not agree and would resume their work Saturday morning.\n\nBut moments later, they rushed back to the bargaining table at the request of Greek officials who wanted to resolve the issue. Greece holds the group's rotating presidency.\n\nThey again failed to agree and recessed until later Saturday.\n\nDelors is stepping down after nine years."
