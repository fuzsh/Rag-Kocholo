        "text": "Guy Verhofstadt (born April 11, 1953, Dendermonde, Belg.) is a Belgian politician who served as the prime minister of Belgium (1999–2008).\n\nVerhofstadt received his law degree in 1975 and practiced law in Ghent, Belg. At that time he also became active in the Association of Liberal Flemish Students. In 1979 he was elected president of the youth section of the Flemish Liberal Party (PVV). In 1982 he was elected president of the PVV with 85 percent of the vote. At age 29, he became the youngest president of a political party in Belgian history.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988 he served as vice prime minister and minister of budget in the coalition government of Christian Democrat Wilifried Marten. In 1991 Verhofstadt changed the name of the PVV to the Liberal and Democratic Flemish Party (VLD) in hopes of attracting more centrist voters. In 1997 he was reelected as president of the VLD. In elections in 1999 the VLD defeated Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene’s centre-left coalition, and Verhofstadt became the first liberal prime minister of Belgium in 61 years. Verhofstadt was reelected in 2003. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to replace Romano Prodi as president of the European Commission in 2004. Under Verhofstadt’s government Belgium legalized same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and the private use of marijuana."
