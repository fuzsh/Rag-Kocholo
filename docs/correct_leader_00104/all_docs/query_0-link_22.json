Jean-Luc Dehaene, a former prime minister, will head the list for the Flemish Christian Democrats. Guy Verhofstadt, another former prime minister, will head the list for the Flemish Liberals. Derk-Jan Eppink, a journalist who was for a while a Commission official (first in the private office of Frits Bolkestein, the former commissioner for the single market, then in the private office of Siim Kallas), is said to be in talks over leading for Lijst Dedecker, a splinter party to the right of the Liberals. Eppink has made something of a habit of baiting Verhofstadt, who famously took offence at newspaper columns that Eppink wrote while working for Bolkestein. Eppink later described how Verhofstadt leant on Romano Prodi, then the Commission president, to have Eppink silenced."
