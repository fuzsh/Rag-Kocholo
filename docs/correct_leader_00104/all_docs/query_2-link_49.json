        "text": "No cancer is increasing in numbers as rapidly as skin cancer, which now tops the list of most common cancers in Belgium. In light of this, health specialists have issued a call to check spots regularly.\n\nThe number of new skin cancers registered in Belgium rose from some 11,000 in 2004 to around 50,000 in 2024, Euro Melanoma – the European dermatologists' network – reported on Tuesday.\n\n\"This marks an increase of 500% in 20 years,\" said dermatologist Thomas Maselis. This rise can partly be explained by people getting older and being exposed to harsher UV rays (tanning beds, travel). The use of \"immunosuppressants\" – medications that suppress the immune system – also plays a role (used for transplant organs, autoimmune diseases or arthritis). Today, one in six people in Belgium develops a skin tumour in their lifetime.\n\n\"If all types of skin cancer are counted, skin cancer is the most common cancer. Our skin is the organ most often affected by tumours, responsible for 40 to 50% of all cancers,\" Maselis affirms.\n\nRepeat patients\n\nPeople who have had skin cancer in the past are at greater risk of being diagnosed again: 12% of former patients develop new skin cancer.\n\n\"This means that not only are more and more Belgians getting skin cancer every year, but more Belgians are getting it a second time,\" Maselis stressed.\n\nLooking at the three most common skin cancers, that risk rises 40% within three years for basal cell carcinoma – which accounts for 70% of all skin cancer diagnoses – and 30% within five years for squamous cell carcinoma. Melanoma patients have ten times the risk of developing a new melanoma.\n\nBut one advantage when fighting skin cancer is that the human eye can detect tumours without the need for more specialised analyses. \"Skin cancer is one of the few cancers we can see for ourselves,\" said Professor Véronique del Marmol, European president of Euro Melanoma. Skin cancer is also perfectly treatable if caught in time. \"So it is important for people to know their skin and check for signs of change.\"\n\n\"Especially if you have already had skin cancer, vigilance is key. Protect yourself from further sun damage, get your skin checked regularly and attend follow-up appointments,\" said del Marmol.\n\nPeople seeking a dermatologist appointment sometimes face a months-long waiting list but Maselis emphasised that people can also seel their GP. \"If your concern is justified, the doctor will be able to arrange a more urgent appointment with a specialist.\"\n\nSpotting the warning signs\n\nBelgium is now the first country to see a collaboration between dermatologists and professional associations that encounter a lot of skin, such as physiotherapists, home nurses, hairdressers, tattooists and masseurs, to ensure they can point out suspicious spots.\n\n\"The idea is not that they diagnose but that they pay close attention to potentially suspicious spots and refer the person in question to their doctor,\" Maselis concluded.\n\nThe Euro Melanoma 2024 campaign, launched on Tuesday, is calling for extra attention to the physical and psychological support of patients after diagnosis, as depression and anxiety are common among melanoma patients, even after treatment. Insufficient support and fear of recurrence have the greatest impact on the patient's health and quality of life.\n\nRelated News"
