Exeter: William Pollard (1865), illus, maps, plans, 117 pp.\n\nPrepared by Michael Steer\n\nCLYST ST. GEORGE is the most southerly of the six parishes named after the Clyst. The church (St. George) was rebuilt in 1851-9 and completely spoilt. It was gutted by fire in an air raid in 1940 but has been again rebuilt (1952). In this parish is Marsh Barton, granted by Henry de la Pomerai to the Stokespitches c. 1170-80 and held by them in unbroken male succession until 1803. Rev H T Ellacombe, Rector of Clyst St George, was brother of General Sir Charles Grene Ellicombe, KCB who was distinguished by service in the Peninsula Campaign.
