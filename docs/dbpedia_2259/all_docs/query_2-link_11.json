II. PAGE Knights Bachelors 5-420 Index ,..at end of vol. ii. preface. Preface. IN the compilation of this book the following sources have been used : — (1) For the ORDER OF THE GARTER the earlier portions of the list are based upon Beltz, Ashmole, Anstis, and Nicolas, primarily of course upon Beltz. But as Beltz includes King Edward III. among the original knights founders, and as I exclude him from their number (on the principle that the Sovereign stands outside the fraternity of knights proper), there is a difference between my enumeration and that of Beltz. I have also adopted a different method of expressing the succession. Where these authorities cease, I have relied entirely on the original records of the Order, viz., the Register of the Garter; Young's MS. Register, and the other collections, volumes, and loose papers of Garter King of Arms. For the very freest access to these records and kindest assistance throughout I am indebted to the courtesy of Sir Alfred Scott Scott- Gatty, Garter King of Arms, and of the Very Reverend Philip P. Eliot, D.D., Dean of Windsor. (2) The lists of the ORDER OF THE THISTLE are based entirely on the original records of the Order. These records consist of two volumes of registers and a mass of papers. The registers were carefully kept, and the entries fully recorded in them until the year 1830. From that date no further entry was made in them, and it is quite clear that these volumes dropped out of sight until they were re-discovered in the present year. The loose papers consisted of the usual official papers relating to knighthoods, ceremonial, and the statutes of the Order. To facilitate reference to all this material Sir Duncan A. D. Campbell, Bart., Usher of the Green Rod, and Secretary of the Order of the Thistle, most considerately had it all removed from the Heralds' College to the Record Office, and there we have together gone through the whole, sorted, classified and arranged it chronologically, and prepared the whole mass of it for the binder. As so arranged the knighthood papers extend to ten volumes, the official and ceremonial B ii PREFACE papers to two more volumes, and the statutes fill a final volume. The whole thirteen volumes are now being bound at Sir Duncan's private expense. In giving me access to the papers and his most ungrudging co-operation throughout Sir Duncan has laid me under the greatest obligation. (3) The lists of the ORDER OF ST. PATRICK were taken directly in the first place from those published by G. E. Cockayne, Esq., Clarenceux in the Genealogist in 1888, with MS. additions from that date down to 1902, most kindly furnished to me by Clarenceux himself. This list was then submitted to Sir Arthur E. Vicars, K.C.V.O., Ulster King of Arms, and by him most carefully collated with the original records of the Order, and amended, annotated, and amplified. The kindness of Sir Arthur Yicars in this is enhanced by the fact that he had himself intended to print and prepare for the press just such a list. It is impossible to express sufficient appreciation of such courtesy. (4) For the records of the ORDER OF THE BATH the most diverse and varied sources have been used. For the very earlier periods the ultimate records are the Close Rolls and Wardrobe Accounts, pre- served in the Public Record Office. Early in the eighteenth century Anstis surveyed this untravelled ocean of material with a zeal that would put to the blush any modern scholar. The results he published in the appendix to his \" Essay upon the Knighthood of the Bath \" (1725). This appendix has been the fountain head from which all later writers have drawn their information as to the early Knights of the Bath, and in the main in the present volume I have followed it and the appendix in Vol. III. of Nicolas. Here and there, however, I have gone behind Anstis to the original rolls and wardrobe accounts, with results that convince me that there is a rich harvest awaiting the man who will dare to do over again the work which Anstis did nearly two centuries since. In addition, I have printed from Ashmole the list of Knights of the Bath, made in 34 Edw. I., a list which Anstis, consciously, and Nicolas, unconsciously, omitted to print. After the wardrobe accounts I have used the better known Heraldic MSS. from the date that these latter commence, viz., the early part of the fifteenth century. These comprise the following: — Harl. MS. 2165, fo. 134 (Bath Knights in 1603). Lansdowne MS. 865, fo. 153-7 (Bath Knights temp. James I. and Charles I.). PREFACE iii Lansdowne MS, 261, fo. 140^ (Bath Knights temp. James L). Lansdowne MS. 94, p. 137 (Bath Knights in 1603). Lansdowne MS. 269, fo. 241 (Bath Knights temp. Charles I.). Harl. MS. 1462 (Bath Knights in 1603). Addit, MS. 34217 (Bath Knights in 1625). Addit. MS. 33053 (Newcastle Papers. Bath Knights about 1752). Addit. 6303, fo. 38 (Bath Knights in 1661). Stowe MS. 731 (Bath Knights in 1725). Addit. 34721 c. (Bath Knights from 1725). Harl. MS. 41, fos. i., 18, 25 (roughly Bath Knights temp. Edward IV.). Stowe MS. 1047, fo. 225 (same). Harl. MS. 1386, fos. 16, 18 (Bath Knights temp. Richard III., Henry 'IV.). Lansdowne MS. 255, fo. 450 (Bath Knights temp. Henry VII.). Harl. 1951 (Bath Knights temp. James I. and Charles L). Harl. 6341 and addit. MSS. 6324 to 6328 (Bath Knights from 1725). Harl. MS. 6166, fo. 130-2 (Bath Knights temp. Queen Mary). And in addition the following MSS. which will be found more fully described (infra pp. viii. — ix.). Harl. 5177; Harl. 6063; Cotton Claud C. III.; Harl. 1156; Harl. 293; Harl. 1959; Harl. 6069. The above sources extend from the earliest beginnings of Knight- hood by the Bath to the definitive erection of the Order of the Bath by George I. in 1725. From this latter date I have used several parallel sources, viz.: (1) the Gazette; (2) the records of the Home Office as printed in the Calendar of Home Office papers; (3) the appendix to vol. iii. of Nicolas; (4) the records of the Bath as preserved in 12 folio MS. volumes at the War Office which I have collated from their commencement in 1827 to the present day ; (5) the MS. records of the Order itself. These records were until his death in the keeping of Sir Albert Woods at the College of Arms. After his death they were, on the formation of the Central Chancery of Knighthood, transferred by Sir Albert's literary executors to the custody of the Central Chancery in the Lord Chamberlain's depart- ment at St. James's Palace. I must defer any full statement on them to another occasion. For access to them I am indebted first and foremost to the courtesy of Sir Arthur E. A. Ellis, G.C.V.O., IV PREFACE Comptroller in the Lord Chamberlain's department and Secretary and Registrar of the Central Chancery of Knighthood. For every assistance in handling them and also in connexion with many other parts of my book I am indebted to the officials of the Lord Chamberlain's department. Similarly for access to the records at the War Office, and for assistance in working them I am indebted to Mr. Leland L. Duncan, M.V.O., of the War Office. (5) The Lists of the ORDER OF THE STAR OF INDIA are based almost entirely on the Gazette, collated with the lists which appeared annually in Burke, Dod, and the Imperial Calendar, and collated also with a list of present living knights, which has been compiled in the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood. The India Office in London does not possess the original register of the Order. If that register exists at all (which I cannot ascertain) it is in the keeping of the Secretary of the Order at Calcutta, and is quite inaccessible to me. Accordingly, I view this list of the Knights of the Star of India with dissatisfaction. Exactly the same sources have been used in compiling, and exactly the same remark applies to, the list of the Knights of the Order of the Indian Empire. In the indexing of the Indian names I have received very kind help from Mr. S. Gr. Smith, of the India Office. With regard to the spelling of Indian names it may be explained that there is as yet no normal standard or uniform spelling agreed upon as a convention. Accordingly the spelling followed throughout the text has been that of the Gazette — regardless of the fact that the Gazette is often inconsistent with itself. When a convention has bsen established it will be easy to remedy this blemish. But in the index the spelling of the place names has been made to conform to that fixed in the last edition of the India Office List. (6) The lists of the ORDER OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE are based upon the original records of the Order, in the main upon the Register. This beautifully kept record is preserved at the Colonial Office, and for access to it, as well as for the kindest assistance in handling it, I am indebted to Mr. C. H. NiBlett, of the Colonial Office. Occasionally I have taken a brief statement of ' services' from the periodical lists of knights which the Colonial Office has printed. But otherwise, the statements of services contained in the following lists are drawn from the express words of the warrant of appointment, as contained in the Register, or from the London Gazette. My collation of the register of this Order has destroyed the superstitious reverence which I once felt for the London Gazette. PREFACE v All Englishmen have been bred in the belief that questions of promotion and of precedence are decided entirely by the date of gazetting. It was a rude shock to this belief to find that for more than 50 years of the history of the Order of St. Michael and St. George the dates of the warrants of appointment, as contained in the Register, never agree with the dates of gazetting. In some cases there is a difference even of months. There can surely be no doubt that if the Gazette does not agree with the warrant of appointment, then the Gazette is wrong. The warrant of appointment is the decisive and final authority. So far as 1 have been able to trace this matter the superstition with regard to the London Gazette has originated in the War Office. As army promotions and decorations are so closely connected, it is very convenient to have a single rule applicable to both, and to count both the one and the other from the date of gazetting. But it is illogical and historically very confusing and deplorable that this rule which has been adopted by the War Office as a mere matter of convenience should, by implication, have been extended to other Orders quite differently circumstanced. There are two alternative methods which are possible in gazetting. The first is to gazette only the date of appointment — that is, to give to the Gazette notice the precise date of the warrant of appoint- ment. The objection to this method is that it leaves undefined the status of the individual for the interim period between the time of his appointment and the time of his investiture. If a man is gazetted as a knight bachelor on the 9th November and is actually dubbed by the King on the 21st December what is his status during the period Nov. 9 — Dec. 21 ? He is certainly not a knight bachelor. He is certainly only an esquire until the very moment that he is dubbed. Then how can he possibly rank for precedence as a knight bachelor from a date at which he is still only an esquire ? Or again, take the case of a C. B. who is appointed a K.C.B. on the 24th June and is invested six months later. What is his status during those interim six months. The difficulty may be got over by a royal warrant (bearing even date with the warrant of appointment) containing a grant of the dignity and another royal warrant of same date granting him permission to wear the insignia and to enjoy the precedence of his new rank and the style and title of a knight bachelor of England. But this is a very cumbersome and clumsy way of getting round a perfectly simple difficulty, and it is only excusable if it is vi PREFACE applied indifferently to every individual — a supposition which is not true in fact. The second alternative method is to gazette only the date of investiture (using that term for the moment as inclusive of the ceremony of dubbing) and to reckon all precedence from that date. This would be very precise, and would conform to the common sense conclusion that a man is not a knight till he is dubbed, and that a man cannot be a knight of an order until he has been first dubbed and then invested. There is only one forcible objection to this second method, and that is, that if the mere investiture were gazetted the outside world would miss the historical cause or reason for the conferring of the dignity. But this could be easily overcome by a note of the date of appointment accompanied by a brief description of occasion, or statement of services, to be placed in brackets after the name of each person invested or dubbed. On these lines a Gazette notice of investiture would run thus : — 1910, Jan. 20. At St. James's Palace. A.B. invested K.C.B. (having been appointed by warrant dated 1909, Dec. 11, in recognition of services for so and so, or on the occasion of the King's visit to so and so). In the same classes and on the same day the names would be arranged alphabetically, and there would be no distinction between those who being present were invested or dubbed personally and those who being absent in the colonies or India were invested or knighted by letters patent. This could be secured easily by making the letters patent bear the same date as the particular investiture. I can see no possible objection to making this method a rigorous rule for gazetting all and every species of preferment of honour. It could be open to absolutely no species of question or dispute as regards precedence, and would be an inestimable boon to the historical student. In compiling this book I have been confronted hundreds of times with three conflicting and different dates for one and the same preferment, viz., (1) the date of the warrant of appointment ; (2) the date of the gazetting, being subsequent to No. 1 ; and (3) the date of investiture, being again subsequent to No. 2. This is simply deplorable from the point of view of exact historical science. (7) The lists of the ORDER OF THE INDIAN EMPIRE have been compiled in exactly the same manner as those of the Star of India PREFACE vii (supra, p. iv.), and exactly the same remark applies as to their unsatisfactory nature. (8) The lists of the ROYAL VICTORIAN ORDER are based upon the original records of the Order as preserved in the Privy Purse Office at Buckingham Palace. For access to these records I am indebted to the courtesy of the Rt. Hon. Sir Dighton Macnaghten Probyn, P.O., G.C.B., G.C.V.O. (9) The lists of the ROYAL HANOVERIAN GUELPHIC ORDER are the most unsatisfactory in the whole book, for the simple reason that I have been quite unable to find the whereabouts of the original records of that Order. As the Order was a Hanoverian one the presumption was that on the separation of the kingdoms the records would be removed from the old German Chancery at St. James's to Hanover. But Dr. Doebner, Staatsarchivar at Hanover, has kindly informed me that the records which are at present preserved among the archives of the Hanoverian Ministry for Foreign Affairs concern only the German and not the English Knights of that Order. All my enquiries after the records relating to the English Knights of the Order have been fruitless. It is quite clear that Sir Harris Nicolas never saw the original records, so presumably they had vanished even as early as 1842. As a result the lists contained in the following pages have been drawn entirely from the annual \"Koniglich grossbritannisch-hannoverscher Staatskalendar \" known later as the \" Hof- und Staats Handbuch fur das Konigreich Hannover.\" These lists have been collated with those given by Nicolas, and with the imperfect lists given in John Frost's \"Translation of the Statutes of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order, with a list of Grand Crosses, Commanders and Knights\" London, 1831. None of these authorities give the exact date (year, month, and day) of appointment of the various knights, so that for the present the reader will have to be content with the simple record of the year only and with the general statement that the appointments to the Order were usually made early in the year. (10) Finally, as to the KNIGHTS BACHELORS. The reader will gather from the introduction (infra, p. xlix.), the enormous difficulty attending the compilation of a list of knights bachelors from the earliest times. There has never existed a register of knights bachelors from the earliest times. Reasons are given below p. xlix — li. for the opinion that the register which James I. instituted in 1622 has not been properly kept. In the absence of such a record for the viii PREFACE earlier period I have fallen back upon certain heraldic MSS. For the seventeenth century onwards I have relied upon the register at the Heralds' College, some of the MSS. mentioned below, the London Gazette, and general historical sources. The heraldic MSS. so employed for the earlier period have been as follow : — Harl. MS. 5177. Gives from fo. 102 onwards a note of knights made in the reigns of Henry VI., Edward IV., Richard III., Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, unto the year 1584. This MS. includes both Knights Bachelors, and Knights of the Bath. Harl. MS. 6063. ' List of Knights from Edward III. to 1624.' This MS. also gives both Knights of the Bath and Knights Bachelors. Harl. MS. 6062. Knights made 1603—1636, with an alpha- betical index, by Sir Rich. St. George. Cotton MS. Claudius C. III., the well known MS. which formed the main basis of a great part of Metcalfe's Book of Knights. This MS. begins in 1426 and ends on the 24th July, 1624. It gives both Knights of the Bath and Knights Bachelors. Lansdowne MS. 678. A catalogue of all the Knights dubbed in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I., drawn into an alphabet. Harl. MS. 6141. Containing Knights made in 1536, and from 1592 to 1607, March 29th. Harl. MS. 1156, p. 82. Knights made at the Siege of Calais by Edward III.; p. 71-3. Knights of the Bath and Bachelors temp. Edward VI. ; p. 102, Knights temp. Elizabeth, arranged alphabetically. Harl. MS. 3320. Contains Bath Knights temp. James I., and from pp. 405-56, \" a general catalogue of all Bachelor Knights made by King James, with the place of their knighthood, the day of the month and year . . . from the first year of His Majesty's reign to the 2nd day of March, 1616—7, drawn up alphabetically. Addit. MS. 5482. Dubbings from 36 Henry VIII. onwards. Lansd. MS. 870. Alphabetical catalogue of knights 1625-1646 and a similar but mutilated alphabetical catalogue of knights 1660-1686. Addit.

Knights by King James. Harl. MS. 293. Knights made (roughly) temp. Edward IV. and Richard III., and Knights temp. James I. Addit. MS. 34766. \"Anthony Bering's Alphabet of English Knights, 1550-1660.\" This British Museum MS. is a copy. The original MS. is preserved in the Office of Arms, at Dublin Castle, and has been kindly collated for this book by Mr. GK D. Burtchaell, of that office. From folio 89 of the British Museum copy I have taken the List of Knights made by Oliver Cromwell. Harl. 1959. Bath Knights and Knights Bachelors made temp. James I. Addit. MS. 4784. Knights made in Ireland from 1599 to 1639. Addit. 4763, pp. 12, 13. Knights made in Ireland temp. Elizabeth. Harl. MS. 35. Knights by Essex in Ireland. Addit. 5482.

Names of 58 Knights made in Ireland by the Earl of Essex. No words of mine can convey an adequate idea of the welter, chaos, confusion and contradictions of these manuscripts. The names of Knights are given with every possible variation, the lists x PREFACE disagree perpetually amongst themselves in the order of the names, and the dates assigned to the battles or other occasions on which knighthoods occur, are in the majority of cases totally incorrect. In the attempt to collate these manuscripts and to verify them from extraneous sources, I have spent four painful years, and I regard the outcome as the most distressingly unsatisfactory piece of historical work I have ever set my hand to. I freely invite from everyone who uses the hook, corrections, additions, or the indication of fresh sources. Leaving this region of Cimmerian darkness, the records of dubbings of Knights Bachelors in modern times is almost as dis- tressing in its incompleteness. In the main I have relied on the Register, and the Gazette from the year 1667 onwards, employing alongside that work the printed sources which are described infra, p. xlix, and the Annual Lists of Knights Bachelors, from the middle of the 19th century, when these appear in the Royal Calendar, the Imperial Calendar, and the Annual Peerages, such as Burke and Dod. For access to the Register of Knights Bachelors which is preserved at the Heralds' College, and which I have collated exhaustively from its first page to the present day, I am indebted to the Chapter of the College. I have also received much help from Chas. H. Athill, Esq., Richmond Herald. For Knighthoods conferred by Letters patent three parallel sources exist — (1) Docquet book of the Crown Office preserved at the House of Lords. This record commences with the close of the sixteenth century, and is in perfect state and practically unbroken in continuity. I have collated it up to the time (1833) when it meets the parallel record at the Home Office. For access to it I am indebted to the courtesy of J. W. Lisle, Esq., of the Crown Office. (2) From 1833 onwards the Home Office kept a separate record of all creations conferred by Letters patent. This is styled the Creation Book, and I have carefully collated the record throughout. It is to be understood as representing the initial step in the process of the issue of Letters patent to a grantee. The concluding steps are contained in the Crown Office Docquet Book, so that from the moment that the two series travel together they are to be regarded as duplicate, save for the important fact that the date of entries in the Home Office Creation Book is always that of the Secretary of State's letter setting a grant on foot, whilst the date in the Crown Office record is that of the PREFACE xi Letters patent itself, and is therefore bound to be some days later. For access to the Home Office Creation Book, and for the very kindest help in using it, I am indebted to Mr. A. H. Eggett, of the Home Office. (3) The Gazette. As a rule the Gazette gives the date, not of the Secretary of State's Letter, but of the Letters patent themselves. The main drawback to the Gazette as an authority for dubbings of Knights Bachelors is that until within the last few months it has never noticed casual dubbings; and failing the Gazette I know of no source from which such dubbings can be gathered together except the daily papers — a source which no human being could ever work. The list of Knights dubbed in Ireland whose names are in- corporated seriatim among the Knights Bachelors in this book has been compiled by Mr. Gr. D. Burtchaell, of the Office of Arms, Ireland. The task of compiling this list has covered several years of exacting toil on Mr. Burtchaell's part, such as can only be properly appreciated by those who have any idea of the intricacy of the subject and of the unsatisfactory nature of all previous compilations of Irish Knights. Mr. Burtchaell's list was intended for separate publication, but on hearing of my book he freely offered to me the result of these years' toil, a generosity of which I have made all too insufficient acknowledgement by putting Mr. Burtchaell's name on the title page of the book. His separate introduction dealing with the sources he has used and the several historical problems connected with the subject will be found on page Iv. infra. The two introductions to the Order of the Bath and to Knights Bachelors (infra pp. x and xxxvii.) raise questions which will provoke discussion and probably dissent. The theories advanced are put forward without the slightest wilfulness or desire of contentiousness on my part. They are simply offered to scholars for their examina- tion, as suggestions towards the explanation of a really difficult subject. On this subject I have had the benefit of kindliest criticism and assistance from Mr. C. Johnson, of the Public Record Office. Before concluding, I would fain express my indebtedness to Sir Henry Maxwell-Lyte, Deputy Keeper of the Records, for advice and help in the preparation of this book. I first projected the work as a book of Knights Bachelors merely, and it is entirely due to Sir Henry's advice that I subsequently extended the scope of the Xll PREFACE book, and included the Orders. In addition, Sir Henry has made many valuable suggestions. But neither he nor Mr. Johnson are in any way responsible for anything put forward in this work. As to my indebtedness to my wife that is beyond expression. Without her help I could not have accomplished such a task. She has turned over the Gazette, page by page, from the very earliest issue to the present day, taking out every knighthood, and has further assisted me in the transcription and indexing of the book, as well as in the stupefying work of collating with the annual publications, such as the Imperial Calendar, Burke and Dod. WM. A. SHAW. Jntrobuctton. Introduction. The Knights of the Garter. THE Order of the Garter dates from 1348. The opinion that the '4ft Order was founded in 1344 is demonstrably incorrect. What happened ' in 1344 was that Edward III., stirred to emulation by the formation at Lincoln of a voluntary association of knights, determined to found an Order himself. A* great tournament was held at Windsor, and at its close, after a stately service in Windsor Chapel, Edward swore a solemn oath that he would at the expiry of a certain time found a Round Table like King Arthur's Table of 300 knights. The account of Adam Murimuth (pp. 231-2) of which the above paragraph is a condensation is indubitably that of an eye witness, and completely disposes of all subsequent accounts like that of Froissart, etc. The outbreak of the French war prevented Edward from immediately carrying out his purpose, but in October, 1347, the king returned to England and at once set about fulfilling his oath. In the joustings which took place between October, 1347, and January, 1348, at Bury, Eltham, and Windsor, certain knights (possibly 12 in number) were chosen on the king's side and received garters and robes from the king's wardrobe. Certain other knights received similar gifts from the Black Prince and may therefore be presumed to have been chosen on his side for the jousting. At the same time the king was engaged in extending the ecclesias- tical foundation of Windsor Chapel. By letters patent of August, 1348, it was erected into a College consisting of a Warden, 23 Canons, and 24 Poor Knights. Whether the first feast of the Order had already taken place at the preceding Easter of 1348 or was deferred until the completion of the ecclesiastical foundation we cannot say. The earliest feast of which we have authentic record is that of Easter, 1350, of which the chronicle of Geoffrey Le Baker (p. 109) gives us so circumstancial an account. ii INTRODUCTION Even in Che days of Charles II. the original statutes of the order were no longer extant, and no transcript of them exists of an earlier date than the reign of Henry V. In his appendix to his \" Institution, laws and ceremonies of the most noble order of the Garter\" Ashmole has printed the earliest known form of these statutes. His text probably represents the ordinances observed by the Order with little change from the days of its institution to the time of Henry VIII. According to these ordinances there were to be 25 original knights rtogether with the Sovereign who was to be the King of England for (the time being. The knights were to wear the Garter and the mantle when in the Chapel of St. George, at Chapters, in processions and at leasts of the order. There were to be in addition 26 priests and 26 poor knights. The remaining ordinances concerned the election and installation of the knights, their succession in their stalls, the affixing their escutcheons to their stalls and the ensigns and habits of the Order, viz., thejjarter, mantle, suncoat and hpod.__ To these ensigns was added in the reign of Henry VII. the collar of the order with the image of St. George pendant therefrom. A further addition was made in 1626 when it was ordained at a Chapter at Westminster that the knights should on ordinary occasions wear on the left side of their cloaks, coats and riding cassocks an escutcheon of the cross of St. George within the Garter. This badge was shortly after, in 1629, converted into a star by the addition of a glory or radii issuant from and surrounding the cross. Additional statutes concerning election of knights, ceremonial, dress, etc., etc., were enacted in the reigns of Henry V. (1418), Henry VI. (1423) and Edward IV. (14TT). In the ordinance made at a Chapter held at Windsor during the feast of 1488 it was prescribed that the annals of each Sovereign should be regularly kept and the elections and deaths of the knights duly registered. The reformation of the statutes of the order which was promulgated by Henry VIII. on the 29th May, 1519, was intended for the removal of all ambiguities and doubts touching certain of the ancient statutes. Among other fresh provisions contained in this reformation were one concerning precedence (which was ordered to be according to the companions' seniority in their stalls and not according to their several ranks) and another prescribing the holding of a Chapter for the purpose of filling a vacancy within six weeks of the notification of the death of a knight. The 38th Article of these statutes of Henry VIII. contains a clear prescription as to the weight and fashion of ORDER OF THE GARTER iii the collar, which is to be of 30 oz. troy weight, and composed of pieces of the fashion of Garters with a double rose between alternately, the one red the other within white. A further reforma- tion of the statutes projected and promulgated by Edward VI. in 1553 was not carried into effect owing to the king's death. Under Elizabeth no material change was made in the Order save for the discontinuance of the annual St. George's feast at Windsor. The subsequent reformations under Charles I. (1636) and Charles II. (1669) are of less importance, but the ordinance of November 19, 1682, concerning the wearing of the riband is worthy of note. This ordinance decreed 'that whereas King Charles I. had ordained that every knight companion not wearing the mantle should nevertheless wear upon the left side of his under habit or cassock the cross of St. George encompassed with the Garter; and whereas it had also been customary to wear the George in a blue riband over the habit it was now agreed that the riband with the George should be worn over the upper habit beltways over the left shoulder and under the right arm in such a manner as that it might be best seen.' With the exception of the appointment in 1704, December 20, of a 'formulary of ceremonies to be used at elections of knights' no further change of importance was made in the statutes of the Order until the close of the 18th century. Ever since the year 1567 the annual solemn convention of the knights on the 23rd April, the feast of St. George, had been discontinued. In addition to this Charles II. had obtained in August, 1680, an admission from the Chapter that he will of the Sovereign was the law of the Order — an admission tvhich ran counter to all the past history of the Order. The drastic changes which were made in the Order in 1786 were based upon these revolutionary ideas. George III. wished to accelerate the reception of his four younger sons into the Order and to bestow three other garters which happened not to be vacant. He therefore in a chapter held at St. James's 2nd June, 1786, promulgated a new statute dated 1786, May 31, decreeing that the sons of the Sovereign should be excepted from (and therefore should be additional to) the original number of 25 knights as decreed by the ancient statutes. The creation of these supernumerary knights necessitated an alteration in the arrangement of the stalls in St. George's Chapel. Nineteen years later a further enlargement of the Order took place. By a new statute dated 1805, January 10, and promulgated at a chapter held at St. James's 1805, January 17, it was decreed that the Order should consist of the iv INTRODUCTION Sovereign and 25 knights companions, together with such lineal descendants of George II. as had been elected or thereafter might be elected; the Prince of Wales always excepted as 'a constituent part of the original constitution, he having been included in the extending statute of 1T86, May 31. This precedent was again followed in 1831 when a new statute dated 1831, June 28, and promulgated at a Chapter at Windsor on the 20th of August still further enlarged the Order by including in it as extra or supernumerary to the original 25 knights companions such lineal descendants of George I. as had been or might thereafter be elected into the order. In the following pages the extra knights created under these statutes will be found marked as supernumerary. Where any of the supernumerary knights were subsequently absorbed into the original number of 25 knights com- panions as any of the stalls of these latter fell vacant, the proper succession is stated in the list below. With regard to the marginal dates given in the following list they are to be understood as the date of election up to the middle of the 19th century and, unless otherwise stated, from the middle of the 19th century the dates are those of the letters patent dispensing with all ceremonies of installation. If the date of investiture and installation is identical with that of election it is in some cases not separately mentioned — otherwise the separate dates are given. As there is no record of the precise date of election existing prior to the reign of Henry VI. the dates prior to that reign are mostly based upon deduction and are not to be taken as precise. They represent the date of the ascertained death or the last historic mention of the predecessor in the stall of the elected knight. Theoretically, according to the 20th statute of the order, an election in the room of a deceased knight should take place within six weeks of the notification of such decease. The inference therefore would be that where the marginal date gives the time of decease of a predecessor knight, the actual election should be dated only a few weeks later. But this inference is by no means a safe one to follow as there are many recorded instances of stalls being kept vacant for a much longer period. Such doubtful dates will be found marked in the following list by the use of the word ' after' in the margin. Theoretically the decisive or distinctive date should be, throughout, the date of installation [or of letters patent dispensing with installation] not that of election [nomination] or investiture. The 13th statute of the Order prescribes that stranger [or foreign] knights shall within seven months of the reception of the insignia send a ORDER OF THE GARTER v sufficient deputy to be installed as their proxy. If they send not such proxy and send no sufficient excuse the election then to be void. If they send sufficient excuse then a further four months' time is granted, and if the proxy be not sent within those four months then the election to be wholly void. In the case of knights not foreigners installation was according to the 21st statute to take place ' in all good diligence' after the reception of the Garter, and if it did not take place within 12 months thereafter, then the election was to be void. But as it is not possible in the earlier centuries of the history of the Order to state the dates of installation systematically I have of necessity followed the dates as printed by Beltz. From the point where Beltz's lists cease I have adhered rigorously to the date of * installation [or of the letters patent dispensing with installation]. \\ In another matter I have ventured to vary from Beltz. He includes ! Edward III. among the original number of knights and numbers the original or founder knights 1 — 26 accordingly. I exclude the Sovereign from the number of knights and accordingly number the original or founder knights 1 — 25. There will therefore be found a difference of one unit all the way through between my enumeration and that of Beltz. With this exception I have preserved Beltz's order through- out because of the authority attaching to his book. But for this I should have been strongly tempted to alter the relative precedence or enumeration of two or three of the knights where important corrections of date have been made by later research (See numbers 258-9). The only remaining point to notice (and it is a most important one) is that from the early part of the 19th century all foreign members of the Order are regarded as supernumerary or extra ; whereas previously they had been regarded as ordinary knights or constituent members within the limits of the original number of 25. The recognition of foreign potentates as supernumerary knights seems to have been of gradual growth. In the case of Alexander I. of Russia in 1813 he was elected a supernumerary knight by special statute. This election ' formed a precedent for subsequent similar [supernumerary] nominations of foreign potentates who previously had been elected only when a vacancy occurred. . . . After this period the missions [for conferring investiture on foreign potentates] appear to have been conducted with greater ceremony and the vi INTRODUCTION foreigners thus admitted into the order were for the first time reckoned as supernumerary knights.' \"With regard to regulation of stalls, it is clear that up to the close of the 18th century the knights succeeded to their stalls according to seniority within the Order and without regard to their rank outside the Order. For instance, a knight, a subject of the Sovereign, might succeed to the Prince's stall. But when, from about the commence- ment of the 19th century, foreign royalties began to be looked upon as extra knights outside the original number of 25, it became necessary to revise the old customary regulation of the stalls. Accordingly a statute dealing with this subject and dated 1805, Feb. 2, was read and promulgated in a chapter of the Order on St. George's Day, 1805. This statute provided that the stalls of princes of the blood should be placed according to their rank nearest that of the Sovereign; that [foreign] emperors and kings should have their stalls next to those of the blood royal according to their elections and installations ; [foreign] sovereigns and princes similarly immediately next to emperors and kings, \" and that all other Knights Companions subjects and strangers not of the dignity above- mentioned shall be installed in the lowest stalls so that they may be translated to the higher [as vacated by death] according to their seniority in the Order and the ancient practice of the same.\" This statute had the effect of introducing the arrangement of the stalls which exists at the present day, viz., that of devoting the stalls to the east of the chapel (to the left of the Sovereign's stall) to the royalties, and those to the west of the chapel (the right-hand side of the Sovereign's stall) to the 25 Knights Companions. ORDER OF THE THISTLE vii The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle. THE legendary antiquity generally ascribed by perfervid Scotsmen to the Order of the Thistle is unsupported by any historical evidence. The adoption of the Thistle as a royal badge does not appear to date I much earlier than the, reign of James III. of Scotland, and no collar, either of knighthood or even of the royal livery existed in Scotland before 1539 in the reign of James V. The mere fact that this king himself wore a collar composed partly of thistles and that such a collar with the cross or effigy of St. Andrew attached was placed round his achievement does not prove the existence of an Order composed of knights on whom the ensign had been bestowed by the sovereign. There is no evidence that any person received the ensign from the sovereign until the reign of James VII., or that any person prior to that date was styled a knigKt of th*e~ Order of St. Andrew or of the Thistle. The warrant of James II. oL-date 1687. May 29, though it purports only the revival of the Order, should be regarded as having in reality instituted the Order as such. The patent which was prepared in pursuance of this warrant never passed the Great Seal, and the statutes which were annexed to it have only the authority of the king's signet. According to these statutes the Order was to consist of J.2 knights with the sovereign. The Chapel of the Order was to be the Royal TTh'apftT\" of H ojjrr nnH House. On the 6th June of the same year King James nominated 8 knights, of whom 4 were invested at Windsor Castle on that day. The others being in Scotland, took the oath, were knighted and received the ensigns at Edinburgh shortly after. All the knights received letters of dispensation from instalment. The Order remained in abeyance during the reign of William and Mary, but was revived by queen Anne by letters patent under the great Seal of Scotland viii INTRODUCTION dated 1703, Dec. 31. On the same day she also ordained the statutes pf the Order which, with slight alterations, still obtain. The only fnaterial alteration in these statutes was that of 1827, May 8, when ihe number of knights was permanently increased from 12 to 16. By the statutes of queen Anne it was provided that before any one /• can be admitted into the Order of the Thistle he must be a knight (^ bacjiBlor. Strangely enough there is no provision in the statutes for the precedency of the knights, either collectively or individually. ORDER OF ST. PATRICK ix The Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick. THE Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick was instituted by king George .III. by warrant dated 1783, Feb. 5. The statutes of the order were signed on the 28th Feb. and the first investiture held on the llth March following. As originally constituted the order consisted of the Sovereign, the Grand Master (the Lord Lieutenant for the time being), and fifteen knights. At the Coronation of George IV., 1821, July, six extra knights were nominated with^ the intention that they should be gradually absorbed into the ordinary knights in the ordinary way of succession. Similarly at the Coronation of William IV. in November, 1831, four extra knights were nominated. The ceremonial of installation was abrogated by royal warrant of 1871, July 14. The ceremonial of investiture was formerly performed in the Cathedrat~Church 'af 'But)lili, and the old banners \\ still hang there. Afterwards it was performed in St. Patrick's Hall, Dublin Castle, or in the Council Chamber, Dublin Castle, or at Windsor, or even occasionally dispensed with. On the 24th January, 1833, it was enacted that the number of knights should be fixed at 22, the five extraordinary knights then existing forming part of that number. Since the royal warrant of 1833, Jan. 30, the installation of all knights in ordinary has been dispensed with. In 1839 queen Victoria authorised each successive Grand Master to retain and wear the Star, Riband, and Badge of the order after he had ceased to be Chief Governor of Ireland. INTRODUCTION The Most Honourable Order of the Bath. THE Order of the Bath as a distinct Order — that is, as composed of a certain and particular brotherhood of knights with statutes, insignia and ceremonies peculiar to them, and with a proper succession of knights within tt^iEaternity by means of election — dates only from the reign of^TJetDrge ]). It was erected by that sovereign in 1725. V Between thiV-Qrdep of the Bath as so erected by George I. and tlie \\ \\older ceremony or formality of creating knights by the process of bathing and investing there is no genuine historical connexion whatever. The preamble to the letters patent of George I., dated ^5^ 1725, May 18, which erected the Order recites as follows : \" Whereas our royal predecessors upon divers wise and honourable considerations have on occasion of certain august solemnities conferred with great state upon their royal issue male, the princes of the blood royal, several of their nobility, principal officers and other persons distinguished by their birth, quality and personal merit, that degree of knighthood which hath been denominated the knighthood of the Bath : we being moved by the same considerations do hereby declare four royal intention not only to re-establish and support the said honour of knighthood in its former lustre and dignity, but to erect 7 ? same into a regular military order.\" The terms used in the concluding sentence, which I have italicised, aptly describe the difference existing between the properly constituted order existing from 1725 onward and the mere form of ceremonial knighthood which had been practised or had been in use prior to that date. As to this latter its origin is lost in immemorial obscurity. Some highly elaborate form of knighthood or of knightly investiture, prob- ably at first purely secular but afterwards partly secular, partly religious in its ceremonial, existed among the Franks, and as derived from them was in use among the Anglo Saxons as early at least as the reign of Alfred, if we may trust the testimony of \"William of Malmesbury. This author's description of king Alfred's knighti] ^ of his grandson Athelstan mentions only the bestowal of a scarlel ORDER OF THE BATH xi mantle, a jewelled girdle and a Saxon, sword. There is no word oi any vigils or bathing. The importation, of the idea of these latter ceremonies must be due to the church./ Prior to the Norman conquest ecclesiastics had been accustomed to make knights on their own account and had elaborated a ceremonial purely in the interests of the church. The knight who was made by this religious ceremonial solemnly entered the church, offered his sword on the altar and took it up again from the altar with a vow to devote himself and it to God and the church. There can be no doubt that in such a transaction the motive of the church was a worldly one. It was the commencement of the process of subinfeudation of knightly retainers by the church. And it was this which was forbidden by the 17th of Anselm's Canons at Westminster in 1102 \"That abbots do not make soldiers.\" For the purpose which the church had in . mind in such a transaction the mere ceremonial of knighthood was ( itself simply an added incident. But it is this ceremonial which forms the only conceivable source or origin of the later secular investiture of the Bath. It was doubtless to the interests of the church to increase the solemnity of the ceremonial and it is possible to conjecture the lines on which development would take place. Firstly, there would be added to the ceremony of the devotion of the sword on the altar the further ceremony of fasting and vigils with the object of deepening the religious impression in the mind of the aspirant for knighthood; and^secondly, there would be added the further step or ceremony of waging or purifying the body or person itself as a further preparation for knighthood. Reconstructing conjecturally the routine of the fully-developed ecclesiastical ceremony of knighthood it would commence with the purification of the knight's person by bathing and then would follow the purification of his soul by fasting and vigils and the solemn offering of his sword on the altar. I offer this as pure conjecture, for there is no record of any such complete ecclesiastical ceremonial of knighthood, and it is open to one very damaging objection, viz., that such an ecclesiastical ceremonial must have developed itself very early, at any rate before 1102, when abbots were forbidden to make knights,* and between this date and the first specific mention of bathing in the account of ' secular knightings there is a gap of two centuries or more. But the * The prohibition is contained iir the 17th of Anselm's Canons issued in 1102 at Westminster. It has >een assumed by all editors of these Canons and by Ashmole and other heraldic authorities that the term facere milites ' here employed means to dub soldiers. Might it not refer, as I have suggested in the text to the creation of knightly tenures by eub-infeudation ? -> ' xii INTRODUCTION general drift of the conjecture, viz., that the idea of the ceremonials of vigils and washing was derived from the church is, I think, irresistible. There is no other source from which such an idea could be derived. I take it therefore as possible that such portions of the above ecclesiastical ceremonial as the secular power found suitable to itself it adopted from the church, and these portions are vigils and bathing. In this way, probably before the 12th century the old purely secular Frankish form of knighthood by investiture with spurs, girdle, mantle and sword, had become a partly religious, partly secular form in which the secular investiture with the sword and spurs was preceded by the religious ceremonials of bathing and vigils. Putting aside the often quoted passage from Ingulphus as quite anachronistic and untrustworthy, the first recorded instance of such a ceremonial is the knighthood, in 1127, by king Henry I. of England, of his prospective son-in-law Geoffrey, son of Fulk, count of Anjou. \" Tota dies ilia in gaudio et exultatione expenditur. Illucescente die altera balneorum usus uti tyrocinii suscipiendi consuetudo expostulat paratus est. Post corporis ablutionem ascendens de balneorum lavacro, bysso retorta ad carnem induitur, cyclade auro texta supervestitur (hereupon follows a long description of his clothing and of his investing with spurs, shield, spear and sword). This account, if trustworthy, makes clear that the process of bathing was in use by the beginning of the 12th century. Like the equally specific account in Ingulphus it seems to me suspicious partly \\ because it is, if anything, too specific, and partly because it stands so I entirely alone. Although there are so many references in English official records to the issue of robes and bed furniture for the divers ceremonial knighthoods, the actual use of the bath itself in so many words is not specified until the 1st year of the reign of Edward III. The earliest existing rolls of the pipe and wardrobe accounts contain quite sufficient references to the issue of robes for these ceremonial knighthoods, but it is very noticeable how the type of the entry or reference in these records gradually expands as if the ceremonial itself was gradually expending or developing. For instance, in the earliest existing Pipe Roll that of 2 Henry II., the type of entry is as follows : — et Ade de la Mare £13. 6s. 8d. ad faciendum se militem ; per breve Regis. ORDER OF THE BATH xiii et Will : de Doura £13. 6s. 8d. per breve Eegis ad faciendum se militem. et pro armis et apparatu ad duos milites faciend. In each of these cases the sheriff deducts the money item in , question from his charge as so much paid by him by command of the J king. The royal writs commanding the sheriff to make such provision were entered on the Close Rolls. Johannes Rex, etc. Yicecomiti Southampton salutem. Praecipi- mus tibi quod facias habere Thomae Sturmy valletto nostro unam robam de scarletto cum quadam penula de byssis et aliam robam de viridi vel burnetta, et unam sellam, et unum par loranorum et capam ad pluvium et unam culcitram et unum par lintteorum quando ipse fiet miles. Et quod in his posueris computabitur tibi ad scaccarium. (18 July, 1204.) Anstis in the appendix to his \" Observations Introductory to an Historical Essay upon the Knighthood of the Bath \" gives many in- stances of such briefs extracted from the Close Rolls. By the time of John the entries in the Pipe Roll had similarly become more specific than the brief entries quoted above from the Pipe Roll of Henry II. Et pro tribus robis de scarletto et tribus de viridi et duobus balde- kinis et una culcitra et aliis necessariis ad faciendum unum militem. xxxiiil. Later entries mention the bed (lectum militarem), the bed- coverings (lectum cum matricio co-opertorio et culcitra), the capa mentioned in 6 John as ad pluvium but not definitely stated to be pro mgilia sua until 19 Edward II., and finally the bath itself (tria linthementa pro iisdem balneis, 1 Ed. III.). It is by no means to be inferred that the bath was not in use before the date of this last entry. Nothing is more perilous than the argument from silence in the matter of such details or items. But I conceive it possible that the scattered data given above may furnish in rough outline a sketch of the growth of the ceremonial form of knighthood, viz., from an investiture preceded by vigils (in use say in the time of John) to an investiture preceded by bathing as well as vigils (in full use by the time of Edward HI.)/ It may be some xiv INTRODUCTION slight confirmation of this view that in the account of the creation of knights in 1306 (Flores Historiarum iii. p. 131) mention is only made of the vigils and investiture. The account is so circumstancial that it is hardly credible the chronicler could have omitted so striking an item as the bathing had that been in use. . . . Rex fecit proclamari ut quotquot tenerentur fieri milites . . . adessent apud Westmonasterium . . . admissuri singuli omnem ornatum militarem praeter equitaturam, de regia Garderoba. Confluentibus itaque ccc. juventibus . . . distri- buebantur purpura, byssus, syndones, cyclades auro textae . . . Ipsa quoque nocte in Templo praedicti tyrones . . . suas vigilias faciebant . . . Die autem crastino cinxit Rex filium suum baltheo militari in palatio suo . . . Princeps autem . . . super magnum altare . . . socios suos cinxit. Whatever opinion is formed as to the above conjecture it is clear that if not by the reign of Henry I. or of John, at any rate by that of Edward III. the full ceremonial of knighthood by the bath was in use. The only noticeable change which the institution underwent from this date onwards was that it became gradually confined more and more to great and splendid occasions such as coronations, royal ,-marriages, etc.; whilst the mere knighthood of individual persons /was left to a simpler ceremony which was coming into vogue, viz., * that of dubbing merely. The difference between these two forms or ceremonies of knighthood is so characteristic as to be instantly recognisable in the official records. In the first place no preparation whatever was needed for the knighting by the sword or by dubbing simply, so that where the records state that such and such knights were summoned to prepare themselves for knighthood and to receive from the Great Wardrobe such and such robes in order thereto, it is at once conclusive proof that the form of knighthood here intended was the highly dignified ceremonial of the Bath. Any formal noti- fication by royal brief directing the recipient to prepare himself for knighthood, or any references whatever to the bestowal of robes from the Great Wardrobe are to be taken as signifying this form of cere- monial. In the second place in cases where the king determined to summon any large body of his tenants in chief to assume knight- hood, he caused the summons to be made by proclamation through the sheriffs of the counties. The meaning of this summons will be treated of below in the introduction to the list of knights ORDER OF THE BATH xv bachelors. The point to notice is that it was an entirely different procedure which was adopted when the King determined to call on any person or persons to undergo the ceremony of knighthood by the Bath. In this latter case the King sent his royal brief direct to the person in question, or in case that person was a minor then the writ was addressed to his father or guardian. A good instance of an order for such briefs is given in Rymer x., p. 256. With regard to this particular instance it may be at once premised that it was the custom at coronations to create knights by both ceremonies, viz., knights of the Bath by the elaborate ceremonial of the Bath, and knights bachelors by the mere instantaneous ceremony of dubbing. It sometimes happens that the list of such creations at a particular coronation does not distinguish the two species of knighthood. In such a case the occurrence of any royal brief of summons to a recipient or his guardian is a sufficient guide to enable us to deter- mine that such a knight was made by the Bath. The absence of such a writ would, on the face of it, point to the conclusion that the knight in question was simply dubbed a knight bachelor. The instance referred to in Eymer, above, is a very apt one in point. In 1426 Henry VI. was himself dubbed a knight by his uncle the Regent, John duke of Bedford. On this occasion some 44 persons received the honour of knighthood, but of these only 25 received royal briefs summoning them to prepare themselves for the ceremony. Only these 25, therefore, whose names are given by Rymer are to be considered knights of the Bath, the remaining 19 are knights bachelors (see infra, pp. 130—2). The various high occasions on which knights of the Bath were created will be found stated in the lists infra. From this it will be seen that the last occasion on which the ceremonial was employed was after the Restoration, when Charles II. created 66 knights of the Bath prior to his coronation. No such creation or ceremony has ever since been used in England. From this brief resume it will have been gathered (1) that all through the middle ages the knighthood of the Bath was simply a form of ceremony of knighthood ; (2) that as a consequence there was no Order of the Bath : there was simply a ceremony of bathing which was applicable to any number of individuals and at any time without regard to such rules of election and succession as would have governed the creations if there had been a properly constituted Order of the Bath; (3) that the highly dignified and completed form of xvi INTRODUCTION ceremonial of the Bath was only gradually elahorated and was possibly not complete until the reign of Edward III ; (4) that from the earliest times to the reign of Henry III. the only form of knighthood in use was that ceremonial form which in its fullest development was the ceremony of the Bath, but that from the 13th or 14th century at least a simpler form of creation by dubbing was adopted for less dignified occasions; and (5) that from the moment this new and simpler form of knighthood was evolved the older and more ceremonial form was reserved for occasions and events of great state and dignity, such as coronations, etc. As has been already stated between this form of ceremonial merely and the Order of the Bath as established by George I. in 1725, the only historical connexion existing is that of the conscious or deliberate imitation by George I. of an extinct ceremonial. An objection may be made to the above exposition of the early status of the form of knighthood of the Bath. On the 4th Feb., 1625-6, the earl of Arundel and Surrey, earl marshal of England, issued an order by command of the King requiring all knights of the \\ Bath to \" continually wear the ensign of that Order about their necks las a mark of honour, and that they may not want any due unto \\them I am to publish that knights of the Bath and their wives are of right without question to have precedency before all knights bachelors and their wives.\" (Anstis, \" Essay,\" appendix p. 79). So far as I know this regulation stands alone, and beyond the fact that it instituted the wearing of a badge it affords no proof whatever of the existence of an Order in the proper and sole sense of the term. It simply marks the superior dignity attributed to knighthood by the Bath over mere knighthood by dubbing. The royal letters patent erecting the military Order of the Bath were dated 1725, May 18, and the statutes of the Order were issued from the court of George I., at Hanover, on the 16th November (O.S.) of the same year. Under those statutes the Order was to consist of the Sovereign, a Prince of the royal blood, a Great Master, and 35 other companions, \" and this number shall never be augmented.\" The king's grandson, prince William, was nominated first and principal companion. The seventh statute en joins that the Prince's Chamber in the palace of Westminster should be the chapter room of the order, and that elected knights should spend the evening of their first entry there and observe the full ritual of the Bath, viz., as follows : — ORDER OF THE BATH xvii \" His Esquires shall not permit the elected to be seen abroad [i.e., out of the Prince's Chamber] during the evening of his first j entry, but shall send to the proper barber to make ready a bathing vessel handsomely lined on the inside and outside with V linen, having cross hoops over it, covered with tapestry for defence against the cold air of the night ; and a blanket shall be spread on the floor by the side of the bathing vessel. Then the beard of the elected being shaven and his hair cut, the Esquires shall acquaint the Sovereign or Great Master that it being the time of even-song the elected is prepared for the bath; whereupon some of the most sage and experienced knights shall be sent to inform the elected and to counsel and direct him in the order and feats of chivalry : which knights / being preceded by several Esquires of the king's household making all the usual signs of rejoicing and having the minstrels playing on several instruments before them shall forthwith repair to the door of the Prince's Chamber while the Esquires Governors [i.e., the squires of the knight- elect] upon hearing the music shall undress the elected and put him into the bath : and the musical instruments then ceasing to play these grave knights entering into the chamber without any noise shall severally one after the other kneeling near the bathing vessel with a soft voice instruct the elected in the nature and course of the Bath, and put him in mind that for ever hereafter he ought to keep his body and mind pure and undefiled : and thereupon the knights shall each of them cast some of the water of the bath upon the shoulders of the elected and then retire, while the Esquires Governors shall take the elected out of the bath and conduct him to his pallet bed which is to be plain and without curtains; and as soon as his body is dry they shall clothe him very warm in consideration that he is to watch that whole night : and there- fore they shall then array him in a robe of russet having long sleeves reaching down to the ground and tied about the middle with a cordon of ash-coloured and russet silk, with a russet hood like to an hermit, having a white napkin hanging to the cordon or girdle ; and the barber having removed the bathing vessel the experienced knights shall again enter and from thence conduct the elected to the chapel of king Henry VII. (where it is our pleasure that the religious ceremonies xviii INTRODUCTION relating to the Order shall for the future be constantly per- formed), and they being there entered preceded by all the Esquires making rejoicings and the minstrels playing before them, during which time wine and spices shall be laid ready for these knights, the Elected and Esquires Governors, and the elected having returned thanks to these knights for the great favour of their assistance, the Esquires Governors shall shut the chapel door permitting none to stay therein save the elected, one of the prebendaries of the church of West- minster to officiate, two chandlers to take care of the lights and the verger of the church : where the elected shall perform his vigils during the whole night in orisons and prayers to Almighty God, having a taper burning before him held by one of his Esquires Governors who at the reading of the Gospel shall deliver it into the hands of the elected. Which being read he shall deliver it to one of his Esquires Governors, who shall hold it before him during the residue of divine service; and when the day breaks and the elected hath heard matins or morning prayer the Esquires Governors shall reconduct him to the Prince's Chamber and lay him in bed and cast over him a coverlet of gold lined with corde.\" The remainder of these statutes prescribes in equal detail the ceremony of awakening and clothing the knight-elect and of con- ducting him to the sovereign to be dubbed and invested. The eighth statute prescribed the details of the ceremony of installation at the chapel of Henry VII. at Westminster. The tenth prescribed that an annual convention of the Order should be held on the 20th of October. The twelfth prescribed the badge or ensign (three imperial crowns or, within the ancient motto tria juncta in uno pendant to a red ribbon placed obliquely over the right shoulder to the left side), and article seven prescribed the robes — surcoat of red tartarin lined and edged with white sarsenet, white girdle with- out ornament, coif or bonnet, and mantle of the same silk and colour as the surcoat and so lined, fastened about the neck with a lace of white silk having a pair of white gloves hanging at the end thereof and on the left shoulder the ensign of the Order. By sign manuals of date 1725, June 1, and November 16 George I. prescribed the details of the collar and banner of the Order and by sign manual of 1727, April 20, he further prescribed that in case of ORDER OF THE BATH xix invasion or rebellion the knights should maintain four men at arms for a period not exceeding 42 days. These statutes of George I. remained practically unaltered until the reign of George III. On the 8th May, 1812, a royal warrant was issued providing that the number of knights should remain as fixed by George I., but that extra knights could be created without limitation of number, the said extra knights to succeed the knights companions on decease and by seniority. This measure was taken in order to meet the merits of officers engaged in the Napoleonic war, but at the conclusion of the war this measure was considered insufficient and the alternative step was taken of enlarging the order itself. By royal warrant under the sign manual dated 1815, Jan. 2, the order was reconstituted and made to consist of three classes. (1) Knights Grand Crgss, who were divided into \"military\" and \" civil,\" the whole number never to exceed 72, and of these the \"civil\" class limited to 12. (2) Knights Commanders : confined in number to 180 exclusive of foreign officers holding British Commissions, of whom 10 might be appointed. (3) Companions. Four days later, Jan. 6, it was provided that fifteen knights com- manders chosen from the officers in the service of the East India Company might be appointed in addition to the above specified number of knights commanders. No further alteration of moment was made in the order until the reign of Victoria, when the last great change or remodelling was made. By new statutes dated 1847, May 15, the Order was thrown open as a reward for civil as well as military or naval services. All the three classes of the Order were sub-divided into two divisions, viz., military and civil. These statutes are embodied in letters patent dated 1847, April 14. The letters patent themselves are published in the \"Gazette\" of date 25th May, 1847, and the new statutes (37 in all) are subjoined in detail. Statute No. 5 fixed the membership as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 50 ... civil 25 ... total 75 K.C.B „ 102 ... „ 50 ... „ 152 C.B „ 525 ... „ 200 ... „ 725 Total . 952 xx INTRODUCTION These numbers to be exclusive of the Royal family, distinguished foreigners and foreign officers. In addition the power was reserved of increasing the number on special occasions. Statute No. 16 provided that on the occasion of investiture each individual of the 1st or 2nd class should first be knighted if he were not previously a knight. By a new statute dated 1850, July 11, the membership was in- creased as follows (in order to admit officers of the commissariat and medical branches of the army and navy, and those of the East India Company into the military divisions of the 2nd and 3rd classes) : — viz. : ordinary military members of the 2nd and 3rd classes increased from 627 to 660, thus increasing the total membership to 985. By new general statutes dated Windsor, 1859, Jan. 31 the member- ship was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 50 ... civil 25 ... total 75 2nd „ K.C.B „ 110 ... „ 50 ... „ 160 3rd C.B. 550 200 750 Total 985 Besides honorary members (foreigners), the number of these latter being unlimited. By the 4th of these statutes the Prince Consort was appointed Great Master and 1st or principal G.C.B. By supplementary statutes dated 1861, June 24, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 50 ... civil 25 ... total 75 2nd „ K.C.B „ 123 ... „ 60 ... „ 183 3rd „ C.B 690 200 890 Total 1148 By supplementary statute dated 1877, June 19, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 50 ... civil 25 ... total 75 2nd „ K.C.B „ 123 ... „ 80 ... „ 203 3rd „ C.B 690 250 940 Total 1218 ORDER OF THE BATH xxi By supplementary statute dated 1881, May 10, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 50 ... civil 25 ... total 75 2nd „ K.C.B „ 125 ... „ 80 ... „ 205 3rd „ C.B „ 705 ... 250 955 Total 1235 By supplementary statute dated 1886, May 19, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 55 ... civil 25 ... total 80 2nd „ K.C.B „ 145 ... „ 80 ... „ 225 3rd „ C.B. 705 250 955 Total ... 1260 By supplementary statute dated 1887, June 20, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 55 ... civil 27 ... total 82 2nd „ K.C.B „ 145 ... „ 86 ... ,,231 3rd „ C.B „ 705 ... 264 969 Total 1282 By supplementary statute dated 1890, Nov. 26, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 55 ... civil 27 ... total 82 2nd „ K.C.B „ 145 ... „ 90 ... „ 235 3rd „ C.B „ 705 ... „ 270 ... „ 975 Total 1292 By supplementary statute dated 1892, Mar. 29, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 55 ... civil 27 ... total 82 2nd „ K.C.B „ 145 ... „ 93 ... „ 238 3rd „ C.B „ 705 ... „ 273 ... „ 978 Total . 1298 xxii INTRODUCTION By supplementary statute dated 1895, May 18, the membership was fixed as follows : — 2nd „ K.C.B. 3rd C.B. military 55 ... civil 27 ... total 82 „ 145 ... „ 100 ... „ 245 „ 705 ... „ 283 ... „ 988 1315 Total By supplementary statute dated 1896, Apr. 10, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 55 ... civil 27 ... total 82 2nd,, K.C.B „ 145 ... „ 105 ... „ 250 3rd C.B. „ 705 ... „ 283 ... „ 988 Total 1320 By supplementary statute dated 1897, June 19, it was provided that members admitted into the Order in commemoration of the Jubilee of the 60th year of Queen Victoria's reign should be additional members \"and shall not now or hereafter be included within the number of the ordinary members\" of each respective class, but to have rank and precedence in each respective class according to the dates of their respective appointments. By supplementary statute dated 1897, June 22, it was ordered that a general officer of the Royal Marines should be an additional G.C.B. military. By supplementary statute dated 1897, June 22, H.R.H. the prince of Wales was appointed Great Master of the Order. By supplementary statute dated 1900, July 21, it was ordered that members admitted into the Order in connexion with the war in South Africa shall be additional members within the respective classes with rank and precedence according to the dates of their respective appointments. By supplementary statute dated 1901, Feb. 26, H.R.H. Arthur William Patrick Albert, duke of Connaught, was appointed Great Master of the Order. ORDER OF THE BATH xxiii By supplementary statute dated 1901, July 17, the membership was fixed as follows : — 1st class G.C.B military 55 ... civil 27 ... total 82 2nd „ K.C.B „ 145 ... „ 108 ... „ 253 3rd C.B. 705 298 1003 Total *1338 By supplementary statute dated 1902, Apr. 26, it was ordained that members admitted into the civil division of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd classes of the Order in commemoration of the coronation of king Edward VII. should be additional and should not now or hereafter be included in the number of the ordinary members of each class, but have rank and precedence according to the dates of their respective appointments. The enormous extension in the numbers of the Order, which has been sketched in the above brief resume of the statutes has of necessity gone hand in hand with similar extending changes in the matter of qualification of membership. The qualification for a G.C.B. (military) at the present moment is the actual holding of a commission in the army of, or above, the rank of Major General; or in the navy of, or above, the rank of Rear Admiral. For a G.C.B. (civil) it is the performance of such personal services to the Crown or of such public duties as shall merit the Royal favour. For a K.C.B. (military) the qualification consists in the actual holding of a commission in the army, or marines, or Indian military forces of, or above, the rank of Colonel, and in the navy of, or above, the rank of Captain, or Inspector of Machinery, or Paymaster-in- chief, or a commission of equivalent or higher rank in the medical service of the army or navy, or in the departments of the army or Indian military forces, distinguished service in the presence of the enemy, or efficient service as Flag Officer or General Officer, or meritorious service in actual war in providing for the wants of the army or navy, or in the care of sick and wounded. For a K.C.B. (civil) the qualifications are the same as for a G.C.B. (civil), or the performance of such lengthened service in the command of a regiment of auxiliary forces, or of a brigade of Naval artillery volunteers, or as an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve, or *This statute fixes the total numbers at 1,338. But this is surely an error, as by the Statute of 1897 June 22, the 1st Class G.C.B. had been increased by one, thus making it 83, not 82, and the total member- ship 1,339, not 1,338. xxiv INTRODUCTION such as shall have contributed in a marked degree to the efficiency of sucn regiment, brigade or reserve ; or exceptional service to the Crown in connexion with the Department of the Secretary of State for War otherwise than on active service in the field. The present state of membership of the order is as follows : — 1st class Knights Grand Cross: 55 (?56) military and 27 civil (exclusive of the sovereign and princes of the blood). 2nd class Knights Commanders : 145 military and 108 civil (exclusive of foreign officers who may be admitted as honorary Knights Commanders. 3rd class Companions : military 705 ; civil 298. In accordance with this sub-division of the first two classes the following list of Knights of the Bath is arranged as follows : — (1) Knights of the Bath from the earliest times to Charles II., and Knights Companions of the Bath from 1725 to 1815. (2) Knights Grand Cross (military) from 1815 to the present time. (3) Knights Grand Cross (civil) from 1815 to the present time. (4) Knights Commanders (military) from 1815 to the present time. (5) Knights Commanders (civil) from 1847 (when they were first instituted) to the present time. With regard to installation it may be noted that the arrangement of the 36 stall* m Henry YII.'s Chapel in Westminster Abbey remained as prescribed in the statutes of George I. until 1812, when, under the Regent, they were re-arranged and extended. The drastic re-modelling of the Order in 1815, and the enormous increase in the number of knights rendered installation impossible, and with it all the archaic ceremonies of bathing and vigils. They accordingly disappear from at least the statutes of May, 1847. The process of investiture at the present moment consists only in (1) knighting in case the knight elect is not already a knight; (2) putting on the insignia. ORDER OF THE STAR OF INDIA xxv The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India. THIS Order was instituted by the late Queen Victoria on the 23rd Feb., 1861, by letters patent of that date (gazetted 1861, June 25). The original statutes were issued on the 7th of March following. It was not until 5 years after its original institution that the Order was divided into classes. As originally constituted it was to consist of only one class of knights (25 in number) together with the Sovereign, the Grand Master (who was to be ex officio the Viceroy and Governor General of India), and such extra and honorary knights as the Sovereign should from time to time appoint. In 1866, however, the Order was completely remodelled by letters patent dated March 28 (gazetted May 25), followed by statutes dated April 19 of the same year. In its re-organised form the Order was made to consist of the Sovereign, the Grand Master, 25 Knights Grand Com- manders (G.C.S.I.), 50 Knights Commanders (K.C.S.I.), and 100 Companions (C.S.I.) with power reserved to the Sovereign, as before, to appoint extra and honorary members. By No. 4 of these statutes of 1866, April 19, the Viceroy of India, by virtue of being Grand Master of the Order was to be First and Principal Knight [Grand Cross] thereof and was to remain a G. C.S.I, after his term of office as viceroy had expired, either as an ordinary G.C.S.I. or in case of their being no vacancy as an extra G.C.S.I., to be absorbed into the number of the ordinary knights as a vacancy should arise, and with rank and precedence according to the date of his having been sworn in as viceroy. At the time of the re-organisation of 1866 the existing K. S. I. were made G.C.S.I. Of the 25 Knights Grand Commanders 15 were to be such native princes and chiefs of India as shall have entitled themselves to Royal favour; the remaining 10 to be such British subjects as have merited favour by important and loyal services to the Empire in India. For the second and third classes the qualification was the meriting RoyjiJ favour by conduct or services in the Indian Empire. xxvi INTRODUCTION Finally the members of the Order were to have precedence rank for rank next after those of the Bath and immediately before those of St. Michael and St. George. In 1875 the membership of the Order was again extended. By statute dated Aug. 30 of that year the total number of the members was increased to 205, viz. 25 G.C.S.I., 60 KC.S.I. and 120 C.S.I. By separate statute of 1876, Dec. 20, these numbers were again increased, viz., to 246 in all, i.e., 30 G.C.S.I. (eighteen thereof to be native princes), 72 KC.S.I. and 144 C.S.I. By this statute of 1876 the qualification for the 2nd and 3rd classes of the Order was thus re- stated. \" No person shall be nominated to either of these classes who shall not by their conduct and services in our Indian Empire, or after not less than 30 years service in the department of our Secretary of State for India, have merited our royal favour.\" By the statute of 1897, June 10, the Order was again enlarged to a total membership of 276, viz., 36 G.C.S.I. (18 thereof to be native princes), 80 K.C.S.I., and 160 C.S.I. At the same time the rule regarding the Grand Masters was re-stated as follows : the Viceroy and Governor General of India to be pro temp Grand Master and by virtue thereof First and Principal G.C.S.I. On the termination of his office he is to be an additional G.C.S.I. with rank and precedence among the ordinary G.C.S.I. according to the date of his having been sworn in as viceroy. The last extension of the Order was made by statute of date 1902, Oct. 21 (gazetted 1903, Jan. 1), when the total membership was increased from 276 to 291, viz., 36 G.C.S.I. as before, with ex-viceroys as additional; 85 KC.S.I. and 170 C.S.I. ORDER OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE xxvii The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. AT the peace in 1814 the island of Malta was ceded to England, and the seven Ionian Islands were formed into an independent State under the exclusive protection of the king of England. With the object of recognising and rewarding the loyalty of the natives of these islands the Order of St. Michael and St. George was erected in 1818. The letters patent erecting the Order were dated 1818, Apr. 27, and the statutes on the 12th Aug. following. As at first constituted the Order was confined to natives of the Ionian Islands or of Malta or to subjects of the king of England holding office in those parts. The lord commissioner of the Ionian Islands was to be Grand Master of the Order, and the Commander-in-chief of His Majesty's ships and vessels in the Mediterranean was to be pro tempore, i.e., during the period of his command first and principal Knight Grand Cross. The Order was arranged as follows : — First class or Knights Grand Cross, 8 in number exclusive of the Grand Master. Second class or Knights Commanders - 12 in number. Third class or Knights or Cavalieri - 24 in number. Within the Ionian Islands and Malta all these three classes were to have precedence of knights bachelors, but no definite pronounce- ment was made in the statutes of 1818 as to whether knighthood of a non-knightly person was essential prior to investiture. This led to an anomalous state of the Order, and with the object of remedying the confusion fresh statutes were signed 1832, Aug. 16. These statutes specifically prescribed that persons of the first and second class must be knighted prior to investiture. At the same time the numbers were increased as follows : — Knights Grand Cross increased to 15. Knights Commanders increased to 20. Cavalieri or Companions increased to 25. xxviii INTRODUCTION The most noticeable feature in these changes is the revolution in the status of the members of the third class. From 1818 to 1832 these latter had been styled knights (if of English birth) or cavalieri (if of Ionian or Maltese birth). They had been entitled to be styled Sir and had precedence over knights bachelors. It may be as well to give here the names of these cavalieri who between 1818 and 1832 were entitled to be styled Sir, with the date of their appointment : — 1820, Feb. 2. GIOVANNI MELISSINO, of Zante. 1820, Feb. 2. GIULIO DOMENICHINI, of Zante. 1820, Feb. 2. PIETRO PETRIZZOPULO, sometime E/egent of Santa Maura. 1820, Feb. 2. PAOLO CAPPADOCA, of Corfu. 1820, Feb. 2. DEMETRIO YALSAMACHI, of Cephalonia, sometime secretary to the Legislative Assembly of the Ionian Islands. 1820, Feb. 2. ANDREA MUSTOXIDI, of Corfu, sometime a senator of the Ionian Islands. 1820, Feb. 2. PAOLO PROSSALENDI, of Corfu. 1821, Mar. 22. PANDASIN CARIDI, sometime Regent of Cephalonia. 1821, Mar. 22. MARCO CARAZIA, of Corfu. 1822, Jan. 31. VINCENZO CASOLANI, of Malta. 1822, Jan. 31. GIUSEPPE MARQUIS TESTAFERRATA, of Malta. 1822, June 15. SPIRIDION GIALLINA, of Corfu, sometime member of the Legislative Assembly of the Ionian Islands. 1822, June 15. ANGIOLO CONDARI, of Santa Maura. 1822, June 15. GIOVANNI MORICHI, of Paxo. From the statutes of 1832 onward, however, the members of the third class were relegated to a lower precedence. Instead of being styled \"knights or cavalieri\" they were to be in future styled cavalieri (if of foreign birth) or companions (if of English birth), and the knightly rank was confined to the first two classes. Under letters patent of 1850, Dec. 31, followed by the statutes of 1851, Jan. 31, the constitution of the Order was further modified. The membership of the Order was increased to 65, viz. : — First class G.C.M.G. 20 Second class K.C.M.G. - 20 Third class Cavalieri or Companions C.M.G. - 25 and a prince of the blood royal was to be Grand Master and first and principal Knight Grand Cross. Further, the lord high ORDER OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE xxix commissioner to the United States of the Ionian Islands, the governor of Malta and the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean were to be extra G.C.M.G., to be absorbed into the number of ordinary G.C.M.G. as vacancies fell. But the Order still remained confined, as before, to the Ionian Islands and Malta or to English officials serving there. By the treaty of 1864, Mar. 29, however, the Ionian Islands were ceded to Greece, and it became necessary to entirely re-model the Order. By statutes of 1868, Dec. 4, and 1869, Apr. 3, the Order was extended in its scope to the British Colonies; the persons admissible were to be natural British subjects, who had held office in or performed services in the said colonies. At the same time the numbers were again increased as follows : — Knights Grand Cross - 25 in number. Knights Commanders - 60 „ „ Companions • - - 100 „ „ and power was given to the sovereign to appoint extra numbers of the first and second classes and to increase the numbers of each class. It was at the same time ordained that the Order should have precedence after the Order of the Star of India. These numbers have been since increased on four successive occasions as follows : — By the statutes of 1877, May 30, to Knights Grand Cross 35 Knights Commanders - 120 Companions - - 200 By a statute of 1879, May 6, to Knights Grand Cross 50 Knight Commanders - 150 Companions - 260 By these last-named statutes the Order was made to extend to services rendered to the Crown in relation to foreign affairs. By statute of 1886, June 28, eight knights commanders and nine companions were added as additional members for services in connection with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, and by the statute of Mar. 19 in the succeeding year these members became ordinary members of the Order. At the same time, by this statute of 1887, Mar. 19, the total membership of the Order was increased to 607. xxx INTRODUCTION By statutes of 1891, Nov. 24, the membership was fixed as follows : — First class G.C.M.G. 65 Second class K.C.M.G. - 200 Third class C.M.G. - - 342 with princes of the blood as extra and with foreign princes and persons as honorary. Further provision was made for the temporary increase of the membership by statutes of 1897, May 4, 1901, Apr. 19 and Sept. 27, and 1902, June 26. Finally, by fresh statutes of 1902, Oct. 30 (gazetted 1903, Mar. 13), the greatest extension of all was made. Under these statutes the Order now consists of : — Not more than 100 Knights Grand Cross, exclusive of princes of the blood royal, extra and honorary members. Not more than 300 Knights Commanders. Not more than 600 Companions. Of these numbers the Foreign Office may designate 30 of the first class, 90 of the second, and 180 of the third. The qualification of membership is the holding by natural born or naturalised subjects of high and confidential office or the render- ing of extraordinary and important services to the king and Empire in any of the dominions beyond the seas; or important and loyal services in relation to the foreign affairs of the Empire. ORDER OF THE INDIAN EMPIRE xxxi The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. THE most eminent Order of the Indian Empire was instituted by the late Queen Yictoria on the 1st Jan., 1878 (by royal warrant dated 31st Dec., 1877) to reward services rendered to the said Queen and her Indian Empire, and to commemorate the proclamation of Her Majesty's style and title of Empress of India. As at first constituted the Order was to consist only of the Sovereign, the Grand Master and one class, viz., companions. The Viceroy of India pro temp was to be ex officio Grand Master, and the members of the Council of India were to be ex officio and for life Companions of the Order. The total number of companions (exclusive of ex officio members) was not to exceed 50, and the total number of nominations in any consecutive years was not to exceed 20. Within a few years, however, the composition of the Order was drastically altered. By letters patent of date 1886, August 2 (gazetted on the 15th Feb., 1887), the Order was divided into two classes and was to consist of the Sovereign, the Grand Master, 50 Knights Commanders as the first class, and of Companions as the second class, not limited in number. Power was at the same time given to appoint descendants of George I. as extra knights commanders. The knights commanders who were constituted on the date of the gazetting of these letters patent appear in the following list at the head of the K.C.I. E. Some few months after this alteration a further considerable change was made in the constitution of the Order. By letters patent dated 1887, June 1 (gazetted June 27), it was made to consist of the Sovereign, the Grand Master, 25 Knights Grand Commanders (G.C.I.E.), 50 Knights Commanders (K.C.I.E.), and companions not limited in number, with similar power as before to the Sovereign to appoint any prince of the blood royal, being descendants of George I. as extra Knights Grand Commanders. On the 10th June, 1897, new statutes for the Order were issued by the Sovereign. These provided that the Grand Master of the Order should by virtue thereof be First and Principal Knight Grand Commander during his term of office as Viceroy, and that after the xxxii INTRODUCTION termination of his said office lie should remain an additional Knight Grand Commander with rank among the ordinary Knights Grand Commanders according to the date of his being sworn in as Viceroy. Further, the Governors of Madras and Bombay Presidencies were to be additional Knights Grand Commanders with rank among the Ordinary Knights Grand Commanders according to [the date of] their respective appointments as Knights Grand Commanders of this Order. At the same time the numbers were increased as follows : — 1st class G.C.I.E., 32 in number. 2nd class K.C.I.E. 82 in number. 3rd class C.I.E. nominations not to exceed 20 in each successive year exclusive of promotions. The members of the Order are such persons as have merited the royal favour by their services to the Empire of India, and such distinguished representatives of Eastern potentates as the Sovereign may think fit and such honorary members also as the Sovereign may think fit. The members of the several grades of the Order have place and precedence next to and immediately after the corresponding classes of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, and rank among them- selves according to date of nomination as in the l Gazette.' By a fresh statute of 1901, July 22, temporary provision was made for the admission into all three classes of the Order, of persons to be named in consideration of services rendered during the South African War and in China. Similarly by statute of 1902, Oct. 22 (gazetted 1903, Jan. 1) temporary provision was made for the admission into the 3rd class, and for the year 1903 only, of 40 members as com- panions. At the same time the membership of the 2nd class (K.C.I.E.) was increased from 82 to 92. THE ROYAL VICTORIAN ORDER xxxiii The Royal Victorian Order. THE Royal Victorian Order was instituted by Queen Victoria by letters patent dated Westminster, 1896, Apr. 21. On the 20th Dec., 1898, by further letters patent dated from Westminster, certain alterations were made in the precedency of the several classes of the Order. The statutes of the Order axe dated Windsor, 1899, Dec. 30, and are 23 in number. By Statute II. the Order is to consist of the sovereign and five several classes, viz., Knights Grand Cross, Knights Commanders, Commanders, members of the fourth class and members of the fifth class. J3y Statute IV. the members are to be \" such persons, being subjects of our Crown, as may have rendered or shall hereafter render extraordinary or important or personal services to Us, our heirs and successors, who have merited or may hereafter merit our royal favour, or any persons who may hereafter be appointed officers of tiiis Royal Order.\" By Statute V. the honorary members of the several classes are to consist of such foreign princes and persons as should have the honour of an Order conferred upon them. The mode of appointment is by warrant under the royal sign manual sealed with the seal of the Order. The precedency of the various classes is, in accordance with Statute VII., as follows : — G.C.V.O. next to and immediately after G.C.I.E. K.C.V.O. next to and immediately after K.C.I.E. C.V.O. next to and immediately after Knights Bachelors of England. M.V.O. (fourth class) next to and immediately after C.I.E. M.V.O. (fifth class) next to and immediately after eldest sons of Knights Bachelors of England. Statute XIV. regulates the method of investiture, and prescribes that the sovereign will, prior to the investiture, confer the honour of knighthood upon the person nominated to be a G.C.V.O. or K.C.V.O. if that person \"have not previously received the said honour\" of knighthood. Further, the ceremony of investiture may by warrant under the sign manual be dispensed with, with the proviso that in xxxiv INTRODUCTION the case of Gr.C.V.O. and K.C.V.O. this dispensing with investiture shall not entitle the person in question to the style of a knight bachelor of England \"without having been duly authorised,\" i.e., without [presumably] the said person having been knighted either by dubbing or by letters patent (Statute XVII.). The anniversary of the Order is fixed for the 20th of June, the day of the accession of Queen Victoria to the Throne. Since the decease of Queen Victoria the already wide scope of the Order has been further enlarged. It is frequently conferred when the king is abroad on purely ceremonial occasions, and without any necessary regard to the central idea of personal service rendered to the sovereign. This is entirely in keeping, however, with the fundamental principle of the Order, viz., that it is the sovereign's private order. As to the Royal Victorian Chain, see infra, p. 415. ROYAL HANOVERIAN GUELPHIC ORDER xxxv Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order. THE Order of the Guelphs was instituted by the Prince Regent on the 12th of August, 1815. The preamble to the statutes of the Order, as issued on that date explain that King George III. had long enter- tained an intention of instituting an Order for Hanover, and that this intention was now carried out by the prince Regent to mark the occasion of the erection of Hanover into a kingdom, and at the same time to signalise the bravery of the Hanoverian troops in the battle of Waterloo. By the statutes which, though issued from Carlton House, were only published in German, the Grand-Mastership of the Order was to be for ever annexed to the crown of Hanover. The members were to consist of three classes, Knights Grand Cross (G.C.H.), Knights Commanders (K.C.H.), and Knights (K.H.), none below the rank of Lieutenant General being eligible for the first class, and none below that of Major General for the second. The arms and names of the knights of all three classes were to be affixed in the church of the Palace at Hanover and in the ancient Hall of Knights in the said palace.But this portion of the statutes was not carried into effect. The Order was destined for the civil as well as the military service, the qualification being the performance of some achievement worthy of the Order. The fact that there was no restriction of number, and that it was for civil as well as military merit, at a time when the Order of the Bath had neither of these characteristics, led to an extensive use of it under king William IV. That monarch, regardless of the object for which the Order had been established, bestowed it with profusion on his British subjects, although it had presumably been created as a means of rewarding Hanoverian and not British subjects. On the death of King William IV. on the 20th June, 1837, the Crown of Hanover devolved on his brother and heir male the duke of Cumberland, and so became separate from the British Crown. From this moment the Order became a purely Hanoverian one, and therefore in strictest parlance a foreign one. E xxxvi INTRODUCTION The question as to whether membership of this Order entitled the holder thereof to the title of \" Sir\" and to the rank of a knight bachelor of Great Britain is concisely stated by Nicolas in his general remarks on the Order. Neither George IY. nor William IY. supposed that such title or precedence would attach to the members. Regarding the Order as strictly a foreign one, both those kings always knighted those members of the Order whom they meant to make knights bachelors of Great Britain. Further than this, William IY. expressly intimated his opinion to that effect after having taken the advice of the lord chancellor on the subject. A paper having been laid before the king in Oct. 1831, containing reasons for the contention that all the knights of the Order of the Guelph"
