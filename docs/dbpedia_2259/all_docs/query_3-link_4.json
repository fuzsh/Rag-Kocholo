        "text": "Grene History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nThe Grene name has descended through the generations from the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture. Their name comes from having lived on the Isle of Grain in Kent, or possible from the French, Graine; a personal name. 1 Two other sources note the Kent 2 3 connection, but we need to explore the possible French influence more. The Magni Rotuli Scaccarii Normanniae lists Richard de Grana in Normandy 1180-1195 4 and so this may be the source for some of the family.\n\nEarly Origins of the Grene family\n\nThe surname Grene was first found in Yorkshire where William del Greyn was listed as holding lands in the Subsidy Rolls of 1297. Years later, John atte Grelne was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Sussex in 1327 and William Grayne was found in the Assize Rolls for Yorkshire in 1362. The name literally means \"dweller at the inlet, or at the fork of a river.' 5\n\nThe Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 also include many entries for the name in the Grayneson form: Willelmus de Grayne; Walterus Grayne; Thomas Grayne; Johannes Grayneson; Ricardus Grayneson; Robertus Grayneson; and many more. The Howdenshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 included: Willelmus Grayne, husband; and Alanus Grayne, orewster. 6\n\nEarly History of the Grene family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Grene research. Another 119 words (8 lines of text) covering the years 1296, 1362, 1379, 1455, 1487, 1616, 1629, 1667 and 1697 are included under the topic Early Grene History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nGrene Spelling Variations\n\nOnly recently has spelling become standardized in the English language. As the English language evolved in the Middle Ages, the spelling of names changed also. The name Grene has undergone many spelling variations, including Grain, Grayne, Grayn, Graynson, Grainson, Granson and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Grene family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nMartin Grene (1616-1667), an English Jesuit, son of George Grene, probably a member of one of the Yorkshire families of the name7...\n\nMigration of the Grene family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Grene family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 62 words (4 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Grene family\n\nTo escape the unstable social climate in England of this time, many families boarded ships for the New World with the hope of finding land, opportunity, and greater religious and political freedom. Although the voyages were expensive, crowded, and difficult, those families that arrived often found greater opportunities and freedoms than they could have experienced at home. Many of those families went on to make significant contributions to the rapidly developing colonies in which they settled. Early North American records indicate many people bearing the name Grene were among those contributors: the name represented in many forms and recorded from the mid 17th century in the great migration from Europe. Migrants settled in the eastern seaboard from Newfoundland, to Maine, to Virginia, the Carolinas, and to the islands..\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Grene (post 1700) +\n\nSir Charles Grene Ellicombe (1783-1871), British general, Royal Engineers, son of the Rev.
