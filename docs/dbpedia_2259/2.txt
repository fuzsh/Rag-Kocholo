(Initial Section of the Volume, pp. 1 to 150)

The work was originally published in the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette and again by Oliver and Jones in 1828, then an expanded version in three volumes by Oliver alone in 1840, with a note explaining that several parishes in the 1828 edition had been removed from the later edition because the Rev. Jones had been unable to update them. These parishes were Moreton-Hampstead (sic), Ilsington, Lustleigh, North Bovey, Ashburton, Bickington, Buckland, Widdecombe in the Moor, Hennock, Manaton and Inwardleigh. The present index deals only with the names recorded in Volume II, pp. 1 to 150. The remainder of Volume II, (pp 151- 211) is devoted to An Ecclesiastical Survey of the Diocese of Exeter, and based upon Bishop John Veysey's 1536 returns to the Crown for that year. That latter part of Volume II, because of its extensiveness is to be indexed separately. This copy of the rare and much sought-after book was produced digitally from a copy held in the Harvard University Library collection that can be downloaded from the Internet Archive. Google has sponsored the digitisation of books from several libraries. These books, on which copyright has expired, are available for free educational and research use, both as individual books and as full collections to aid researchers.
