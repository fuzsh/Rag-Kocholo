        "meta_description": "Roger Zelazny:  Speculative Fiction by DBRL_MichaelR - a staff-created list : \"He was a poet, first, last, always. His words sang.\n\nHe was a storyteller without peer. He created worlds as colorful and exotic and memorable as any our genre has ever seen.\n\nBut most of all, I will remember his people. Corwin of Amber and his troublesome siblings. Charles Render, the dream master. The Sleeper, Croyd Crenson, who never learned algebra. Fred Cassidy climbing on his rooftops. Conrad. Dilvish the Damned. Francis Sandow. Billy Blackhorse Singer. Jarry Dark. The Jack of Shadows. Hell Tanner. Snuff.\n\nAnd Sam. Him especially. “His followers called him Mahasamatman and said he was a god. He preferred to drop the Maha- and the atman, however, and called himself Sam. He never claimed to be a god. But then, he never claimed not to be a god.”\n\nLord of Light was the first Zelazny book I ever read. I was in college at the time, a long time reader who dreamed of writing himself one day. I’d been weaned on Andre Norton, cut my teeth on Heinlein juveniles, survived high school with the help of H.P. Lovecraft, Isaac Asimov, “Doc” Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and J.R.R. Tolkien. I read Ace doubles and belonged to the Science Fiction Book Ciub, but I had not yet found the magazines. I’d never heard of this Zelazny guy. But when I read those words for the first time, a chill went through me, and I sensed that SF would never be the same. Nor was it. Like only a few before him, Roger left his mark on the genre.\n\nHe left his mark on my life as well. After Lord of Light, I read every word of his I could get my hands on. “He Who Shapes,” And Call Me Conrad . . ., ”A Rose for Ecclesiastes,” Isle of the Dead, “The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth,” Creatures of Light and Darkness, and all the rest. I knew I had found one hell of a writer in this fellow with the odd, unforgettable name. I never dreamed that, years later, I would also find in Roger one hell of a friend.\"\n\n~ George R. R. Martin",

He never claimed to be a god, but then he never claimed not to be a god. A holy war rages across the heavens and mankind's fate hangs in the balance. Based on Hindu mythology, this is one of Zelazny's most famous books.

He's also expendable - at least in the eyes of the Secretary of Traffic for the Nation of California. Tanner doesn't care much for those eyes. You'd also never mistake Hell Tanner for a humanitarian. Facing life in prison for his various crimes, he's given a choice; rot away his remaining years in a tiny jail cell, or drive cross-country and deliver a case of antiserum to the plague-ridden people of Boston, Massachusetts...if anyone is still alive there to receive it, that is. The chance of a full pardon does wonders for getting his attention. And don't mistake this mission of mercy for any kind of normal road trip - not when there are radioactive storms, hordes of carniverous beasts, and giant, mutated scorpions to be found along every deadly mile between Los Angeles and the East Coast. But then, this is no normal part of America, you see. This is DAMNATION ALLEY. Published in 1969. Show less\n\nThe Chronicles of Amber is a series of fantasy novels by American writer Roger Zelazny.

He soon discovers that he is part of a superhuman royal family who can wander among infinite parallel worlds (called \"shadows\"), and who rule over the one true world, Amber.

He was a tremendously variable writer. The heart-wrenching \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" (written October 1967) was nothing like the passionate \"Graveyard Heart,\" which was completely different from the mind blowing \"The Ides of Octember,\" serialized in Amazing as \"He Who Shapes,\" which was altogether different from the post-nuclear holocaust romp, \"Damnation Alley,\" published in Galaxy and released as a film ten years later.
