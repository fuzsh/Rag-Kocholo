        "text": "Then down once more, that spiraling way, a light here, a light there, into the caverns of Kolvir.... On down. Twisting and winding through the gloom. The torch and lantern-lit guard station was theatrically stark within it. I reached the floor and headed that way. \"Good evening, Lord Corwin,\" said the lean, cadaverous figure who rested against a storage rack, smoking his pipe, grinning around it. \"Good evening, Roger. How are things in the nether world?\" \"A rat, a bat, a spider. Nothing much else astir. Peaceful.\" \"You enjoy this duty?\" He nodded. \"I am writing a philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity. I work on those parts down here.\" \"Fitting, fitting,\" I said. \"I'll be needing a lantern.\" He took one from the rack, brought it to flame from his candle. \"Will it have a happy ending?\" I inquired. He shrugged. \"I'll be happy.\" \"I mean, does good triumph and hero bed heroine? Or do you kill everybody off?\" \"That's hardly fair,\" he said. \"Never mind. Maybe I'll read it one day.\" \"Maybe,\" he said. ~ Chapter 4, The Hand of Oberon"
