He won the Nebula Award three times (out of 14 nominations) and the Hugo Award six times (also out of 14 nominations), including two Hugos for novels: the serialized novel ...And Call Me Conrad (1965), subsequently published under the title This Immortal (1966) and then the novel Lord of Light (1967).[1]\n\nRoger Zelazny made his name with a group of novellas which demonstrated just how intense an emotional charge could be generated by the stock imagery of sf; the most famous of these is 'A Rose for Ecclesiastes' in which a poet struggles to convince dying and sterile Martians that life is worth continuing. Zelazny continued to write excellent short stories throughout his career. Most of his novels deal, one way or another, with tricksters and mythology, often with rogues who become gods, like Sam in Lord of Light, who reinvents Buddhism as a vehicle for political subversion on a colony planet.[2]\n\nSeries[]\n\nThe Chronicles of Amber[]\n\nGenres: Epic Fantasy, Historical Fantasy\n\nTheme:\n\nChangeling Saga[]\n\nGenres: YA, Sorcery and Magic, Historical Fantasy\n\nTheme: A young man on Earth discovers that he is the son of a great dark wizard from another planet.\n\nSeries list:\n\nChangeling (Changeling Saga Book 1) (1980)\n\nMadwand (Changeling Saga Book 2) (1981) aka Madworld\n\nDilvish Stories[]\n\nGenres: Epic Fantasy\n\nTheme: half elf, half human\n\nSeries list:\n\nDilvish the Damned (Dilvish Stories Book 1) (1982, reissued 2021)\n\nThe Changing Land (Dilvish Stories Book 2) (1981, reissued 2021)\n\nMillenial Contest series[]\n\nGenres: Humorous Fantasy, Satire, Historical Fantasy\n\nTheme: Satirical take on Fantasy Tropes\n\nCo-Author: Robert Sheckley\n\nSeries list:\n\nBring Me the Head of Prince Charming (1991)\n\nIf at Faust You Don't Succeed (1993)\n\nA Farce to Be Reckoned With (1995)\n\nCollected Stories of Roger Zelazny[]\n\nGenres: various\n\nTheme: Each book is a collection of short stories from a specific period of time in Zelazny's writing career.\n\nSeries list:\n\nThreshold (Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny) (2009)\n\nPower & Light (Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny) (2009)\n\nThis Mortal Mountain (Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny) (2009)\n\nLast Exit to Babylon (Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny) (2009)\n\nNine Black Doves (Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny) (2009)\n\nThe Road to Amber (Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny) (2009)\n\nOther Works[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nThe Dream Master (1966) aka He Who Shapes\n\nThis Immortal (1966) aka ...And Call Me Conrad\n\nLord of Light (1967)\n\nCreatures of Light and Darkness (1969)\n\nDamnation Alley (1969)\n\nJack of Shadows (1971)\n\nToday We Choose Faces (1973)\n\nDoorways in the Sand (1976)\n\nBridge of Ashes (1976)\n\nDeus Irae (1976) (with Philip K Dick)\n\nRoadmarks (1979)\n\nCoils (1982) (with Fred Saberhagen)\n\nEye of Cat (1982)\n\nTo Spin Is Miracle Cat (1982)\n\nA Dark Travelling (1987)\n\nThe Black Throne (1990) (with Fred Saberhagen)\n\nThe Mask of Loki (1990) (with Thomas T Thomas)\n\nFlare (1992) (with Thomas T Thomas)\n\nA Night in the Lonesome October (1993)\n\nWilderness (1994) (with Gerald Hausman)\n\nDonnerjack (1997) (with Jane Lindskold)\n\nPsychoshop (1998) (with Alfred Bester)\n\nLord Demon (1999) (with Jane Lindskold)\n\nThe Dead Man's Brother (2009)\n\nShort stories[]\n\nPlease see Roger Zelazny bibliography at wikipedia and Roger Zelazny at Fantastic Fiction for lists.\n\nAwards[]\n\nHugo Best Novel winner (1966) - This Immortal\n\nNebula Awards Best Novellette winner (1966) - The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth [short story]\n\nNebula Awards Best Novella winner (1966) - He Who Shapes\n\nHugo Best Novel winner (1968) - Lord of Light\n\nHugo Best Novella winner (1976) - Home is the Hangman [short story]\n\nNebula Awards Best Novella winner (1976) - Home is the Hangman [short story]\n\nHugo Best Novellette winner (1982) - Unicorn Variations [short story]\n\nHugo Best Novella winner (1986) - 24 Views of Mount Fuji, by Hokusai\n\nHugo Best Novellette winner (1987) - Permafrost"
