        "text": "In the far future, on a colony world, some people have developed mutant powers…which they use (along with technology) to impersonate the gods of the Hindu pantheon and rule over the planet of their descendants.\n\nAnd that’s as sci-fi as this story gets. It’s not at all a spaceships-and-lasers story…it’s a fantasy epic, imitating all the conventions of religious myth from symbolic repetition to deliberate ambiguity.\n\nThe story follows Siddhartha, AKA Maitreya (“Lord of Light”), AKA Mahasamatman, AKA the Buddha, AKA just Sam. Some view him as a god, others as the friend of demons. He views himself as a charlatan, using the tools at his disposal in a political crusade. The story suggests they are all right – just as it deftly synthesizes a culture built on veneration of the Hindu pantheon (and depending on their approval for reincarnation in a new body) and advanced technology (including the technology that makes this body-transfer possible).\n\nLord of Light is a story of ideas…a raw, unidealized look at humanity – and the darkness inside of them…a tale of atmosphere, ancient legends, and towering personalities…all set in a rich, layered world drawn from Indian culture and religion – perfect for those fantasy aficionados tired of the “bland European” fantasy setting.\n\nCharacters\n\nMr. Zelazny excels at making characters that are…not exactly “huggable,” but sympathetic. They may not be people you trust, and they sometimes do distasteful things…but you can always understand what’s going on in their heads. They are always intensely human characters.\n\nThis goes for our main character Sam, too. While his peers are strutting around in gorgeous bodies and play-acting gods, he’s living as a simple human prince among the commoners (who must watch their political and religious sympathies, lest they be denied a reincarnation when their current body wears out).\n\nOnce Sam decides to take on the oppressive oligarchy of Heaven, he does it with subtlety, with trying to break the people’s blind reverence for them…with the (uncontrollable) power of local aliens…with human mistakes, partial victories, set-backs and failures. While we might disagree with some of his choices, and question some of his methods, there’s no denying Sam is a realistic, three-dimensional human character.\n\nIdeas\n\nSpeaking of humans…they are pretty dark creatures. And Mr. Zelazny doesn’t shy away from that fact.\n\nThe city of the gods where the “Heavenly” bureaucracy lives is basically a great big “garden of delights”…where they spend their days banging each other (and their interchangeable concubines), getting drunk, eating delicacies…and occasionally, indulging even darker passions like violence.\n\nThere was more sex than in Zelazny’s Chronicles of Amber, but each instance was still tamer than Robert Ludlum’s style. A good author doesn’t need to give medical definitions for the readers’ skin to crawl…perhaps there’s a reason “debauchery” is such a gross-sounding word without even knowing what it means?\n\nAll of which paints the message loud and clear: no matter what humans achieve – even if they invent a technology that lets them side-step death! – they will still be fallen creatures, and sooner or later they will use it to oppress and exploit each other.\n\nBody swapping\n\nSpeaking of the honest exploration of ideas, a central element of Lord of Light is the technology that lets people transfer their “atman” or soul from one body to another.\n\nWhile no one ever brings up the issue of how they created human bodies without a “person” already living in it, they do discuss the complications of family ties where people are constantly renewing their bodies. What does it mean to say this or that person is your “father” – when he’s now in a new body, and so are you, and so the two of you have no genetic material in common at all…yet he (and your mother) still contributed to the birth of your spirit into the world. Complicated, no?\n\nAdd to that the fact that male and female bodies are now interchangeable, and I’m honestly surprised the whole society hasn’t devolved in a fiery collapse because of the total fragmentation of the nuclear family. Perhaps humans are more resilient than I assumed…or rather, perhaps Mr. Zelazny views humans as more resilient than I would.\n\nMyths and legends\n\nPart of the fun of Lord of Light is the depth of the world Mr. Zelazny has created. We really get a sense that exciting, unusual things have happened a lot in the past – that, in fact, the characters’ lives were stuffed full of strange and interesting things – but that we only see through hints and barely mentioned memories. Extending the world beyond the story at hand makes it immensely bigger.\n\nI think the author was trying to do the same thing with some of his ambiguities… Like an old wives’ tale that teaches you about the world by beginning, “Some say…” – while still leaving room for interpretation. This narrative style perfectly captured the ambiance of an oral culture, infused with the rejection of “material reality” that underlies Buddhism. After all, the goal of a Buddhist is to disconnect from physical reality so much that you reach Nirvanna – a state beyond existence.\n\nIt fit the story Mr. Zelazny was telling like a hand in a glove…and yet…\n\nComplaints\n\nAnd yet Jesus said, “I Am the way.” He said, “I am the Truth.”\n\nThe gods of the Celestial City rule by indoctrination…by denying their opponents reincarnation…by insisting on the pre-ordained roster of “Heaven.” When a god or goddess dies, their place must be taken by someone else – another of the mutant oligarchs takes on their name and primary attributes (male, fire-wielding, etc.). They essentially ret-con history to maintain their narrative.\n\nVery clever as a story ploy…but, well, modern America has a bad habit of thinking it can make a thing so just by yelling it louder. Which, now that I think about it, makes Zelazny’s villains all the more believable. But…\n\nBut ideas have consequences. And when we tell ourselves (even in stories) that real historical events don’t matter (“some say this, but others say that…”) it erodes our grip on reality – God’s reality. Which happens to be very insistent.\n\nAm I saying the novel Lord of Light will destroy your psychological grip on cause-and-effect? Only if you are a pathetically weak, ungrounded person. But I am saying we must be aware of the ideas we come into contact with…fore-warned is fore-armed.\n\n(Also, it’s kinda weird that this universe’s master-of-zombies is the one guy who spouts vaguely Biblical references and claims a vague Christian ecclesiastical affiliation. Even weirder than Ultron’s habit of Biblical/apocalyptic literary reference in Avengers: Age of Ultron.)\n\nSpoilers for Authors\n\nMy other complaint is because I watch too much Writer Youtube.\n\nThe entire novel builds up the conflict of Sam versus the fake gods…Every scene somehow ties into their clash of ideas: oppress and exploit the common people, or allow them to (re)discover and enjoy the same tech advances that have given the “gods” their comfortable lives. Every battle, conversation, and set-back is somehow laced with the conflict.\n\nThen, in the last chapter, everything peaks – only Sam doesn’t fight the gods. Instead, he teams up with the gods who are left (the ones he, or various others, haven’t killed yet) to fight some third party who’s barely been mentioned.\n\nThis mysterious “new challenger” popped up in conversation once or twice before, as one of these hinted past conflicts that made the world feel bigger. But he certainly didn’t get enough development to be the end boss of the entire book. It’s not quite an official “Martha Moment“…but it’s also not entirely satisfying.\n\n(In a “Martha Moment,” something causes one of the opposing teams – often the winning side – to abandon their goal so that the two sides can unite in the third act. Instead, Sam joins the gods because he figures he has already won the culture war — once people no longer view the gods as inviolable, their power will be basically broken. It’s still less satisfying though.)\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s fun when authors know what style they’re aiming for, and then go whole-hog in nailing that style in the bull’s-eye.\n\nLord of Light is an evocative, atmospheric fantasy (glossed with scientific explanations)…The manipulation of philosophy for political ends was a clever plot device, and the ideas raised by the technology were honestly explored.\n\nWhat with the “questionable” scenes, and the worldview implications, I would recommend this for mature readers who are ready to intellectually confront the ideas presented to them.\n\nYou’ll also get a part-epic, part-character-piece that melds battles, adventure, and intrigue.\n\nLord of Light is available on Amazon.\n\nI love Twitter for all the cool articles I can find and share there. So I dug back through my feed for the best articles, posts, and videos I found and shared this past year!\n\nWhether you’re an author, a blogger, or just a Christian who likes thinking deeply about things, here are some cool (and/or important) pieces for you to enjoy!\n\nWriting and Story Development\n\nThis year I fell down the deep, dark hole of “writer YouTube”…Here are some of the amazing (and addicting) videos I found:\n\nFormer CIA Chief of Disguise Breaks Down 30 Spy Scenes From Film & TV\n\nvia WIRED\n\nI found this video while researching my spy/suspense/action story Transmutation of Shadow, and it’s so cool!\n\nTrope Talk: Robots\n\nvia Overly Sarcastic Productions\n\nRed does a great job recognizing that humans and computers have totally different ways of thinking…and she also breaks down the good, the evil, the friendly, and the realistic of writing robots in fiction.\n\nRey and the Sad Devolution of the Female Character\n\nvia Thor Skywalker\n\nWe don’t hate female characters…we hate poorly done characters that serve a meta agenda, rather than feeling like genuine people within the story world.\n\nWatch the video to see for yourself!\n\n(Also check out this video – by Literature Devil – about “Mary Sue” characters…what they are, why people dislike them, and how they relate to the issue of “Social Justice Warriors”.)\n\nA Few Words from Roger Zelazny\n\nvia Theodore Krulik on Tor.com\n\nRoger Zelazny wrote the Chronicles of Amber, which inspired my dad as a young writer…and became a surprise favorite with me when I read it. This interview with him gives insight into his writing process, his opinion of fantasy vs. science fiction, and on writing complex characters.\n\nIt’s not a video…so read it at your leisure.\n\nAction Choreography for Novels\n\nvia Felix the Fox Mysteries\n\nAction plays a big role in my White Mesa Chronicles (especially Gladiator…guess why) and in Transmutation of Shadow. Thus it’s important to get the physics right!\n\nThis post (also not a video) will help you think about those pesky problems of what’s actually, physically possible in your story!\n\nAlso check out his post on making pre-modern (and fantasy) battles more realistic in terms of equipment, technique, and strategy. Remember: everything happens in context!\n\nThe Elevator Pitch\n\nvia Christa MacDonald on Christian Shelf-Esteem\n\nIf you’ve been in the “author” circle for long, you’ve heard you need an “elevator pitch”…a short, pithy expression of your book(s) that would fit into the space of an elevator ride, but make whoever’s listening want to hear more.\n\nChrista MacDonald found she was making assumptions about what the people she was talking to would be interested in, and defending her work before anyone had raised any objections.\n\nRead her post to see how she decided to let go of this fear rooted in pride, and share her stories at face value.\n\nWorldview\n\nHow we think about the world is crucial…and our different perspectives form a central part of who we are.\n\nEach of these articles (or videos) explores a different element of our lives and challenges us to think about morality, culture, art, ourselves, and/or God in a different light.\n\nEnriching Lives – What Mass Effect 2 Teaches Us about Morality\n\nvia Extra Credits\n\nExtra Credits create entertaining, thought-provoking videos about video games…how to make them well, how to tell meaningful stories through them, what they can mean for the broader culture, etc.\n\nThis one talks about how video games can force us to examine our own moral beliefs!\n\nArtistic Originality: Is It Dead—or Was it Merely a Fallacy to Begin With?\n\nvia Sean P. Carlin\n\nIn our cultural climate of reboots, sequels, prequels, reboot-sequels…Mr. Carlin has asked the question, “What is artistic originality anyway?”\n\nCan we ever truly be free of our creative influences, and make “original” art?\n\nRead his article to find out!\n\nAlso check out his article about his childhood of urban exploration in New York City, and how our shifting culture of security-consciousness makes that impossible for kids of the modern day. We’ve lost something…is it worth the price of “safety” to give up?\n\nRead his piece and decide for yourself!\n\nHow Virtual Horse Armor Paved the Way for Micro-Transactions\n\nvia Cheddar\n\nMicro-transactions are all over the place in free-to-play games…sort of like YouTube has started shoving ads in my face every time I want to load a video.\n\nThis video (on YouTube…ahem) talks about how it started…and why micro-transactions that affect game-play make players more unhappy than things that affect aesthetics.\n\nHow Our Addiction to FREE is Poisoning the Internet and Killing the Creatives\n\nvia Kristen Lamb\n\nThis post was so interesting, I even wrote my own follow-up piece.\n\nBasically: we all love free stuff. Getting free stuff, that is. But nothing is free…someone has to give it. And as authors give away more free stuff (books, songs, etc.) the more audiences expect free stuff, and the worse the whole problem gets.\n\nJust go read her full post – then read my post about living generously!\n\n(Also read her post about the flood of new books that self-publishing has created, and some strategies that we as an industry could use to find the “good fish” amidst the tsunami. Basically, go check out her blog in general.)\n\nMy Son Was Addicted to a Smartphone\n\nvia Sabrina McDonald on Family Life\n\nYes, smartphone addiction is a thing, and yes, you can confront it. In fact, before drugging your kid up for ADHD, look into culling his screen time! It might be the trick you need.\n\nYouTube: Manufacturing Authenticity (For Fun and Profit!)\n\nvia Lindsey Ellis\n\nHaving become, ahem, slightly addicted to YouTube this year, I naturally found channels/content providers that I liked and looked up all their videos.\n\nHowever, as an author and blogger, I also have a feeling for the other side (people all over the world aren’t watching my face, but they can look up my words at any time).\n\nWhen the wall between “media celebrity” and audience comes down…when your favorite YouTuber or author “gets real” and shares personal things…what does that do to them? What does it do to us? What are the “moral hazards” of this “authentic celebrity” culture?\n\nIf you’re not sure exactly what I mean, just watch the video! It’s thought-provoking! (Language cautions, though.)\n\nChristian Fiction Guidelines\n\nvia Chad Pettit\n\nDid you know that some “Christian” readers have very specific guide-lines for what they consider to be “Christian” fiction? And that they’ll rake authors over the internet coals if they break these rules?\n\nPerhaps we should go back to the BIBLE for a consideration of what we should be reading/writing in our fiction…and maybe we can extend some Christian kindness to our brothers and sisters.\n\nThis post is a plea for just that. Read it yourself!\n\nA Tale of Two Worldviews\n\nvia Scott Allen at WORLD Magazine\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates versus Martin Luther King, Jr. — two African-American thought leaders with very different approaches to the race issue.
