        "text": "Roger Joseph Zelazny (May 13, 1937 – June 14, 1995) was an American writer of fantasy and science fiction short stories and novels, best known for his The Chronicles of Amber series. He won the Nebula award three times (out of 14 nominations) and the Hugo award six times (also out of 14 nominations), including two Hugos for novels: the serialized novel ...And Call Me Conrad (1965; subsequently published under the title This Immortal, 1966) and then the novel Lord of Light (1967).\n\nThe ostracod Sclerocypris zelaznyi was named after him.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nRoger Zelazny was born in Euclid, Ohio, the only child of Polish immigrant Joseph Frank Zelazny and Irish-American Josephine Flora Sweet. In high school, he became the editor of the school newspaper and joined the Creative Writing Club.[2] In the fall of 1955, he began attending Western Reserve University and graduated with a B.A. in English in 1959.[2] He was accepted to Columbia University in New York and specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, graduating with an M.A. in 1962.[2] His M.A. thesis was entitled Two traditions and Cyril Tourneur: an examination of morality and humor comedy conventions in The Revenger's Tragedy. Between 1962 and 1969 he worked for the U.S. Social Security Administration in Cleveland, Ohio and then in Baltimore, Maryland spending his evenings writing science fiction.[2][3] He deliberately progressed from short-shorts to novelettes to novellas and finally to novel-length works by 1965.[2] On May 1, 1969, he quit to become a full-time writer, and thereafter concentrated on writing novels in order to maintain his income.[3] During this period, he was an active and vocal member of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society, whose members included writers Jack Chalker and Joe and Jack Haldeman among others.\n\nZelazny was married twice, first to Sharon Steberl in 1964 (divorced, no children), and then to Judith Alene Callahan in 1966 (he had also been engaged to folk singer Hedy West for six months in 1961/62[2]). Roger and Judy had two sons, Devin and Trent (an author of crime fiction) and a daughter, Shannon. At the time of his death, Roger and Judy were separated and he was living with author Jane Lindskold.[4]\n\nHis first fanzine appearance was part one of the story \"Conditional Benefit\" (Thurban 1 #3, 1953) and his first professional publication and sale was the fantasy short story \"Mr. Fuller's Revolt\" (Literary Calvalcade, 1954).[2] As a professional writer, his debut works were the simultaneous publication of \"Passion Play\" (Amazing, August 1962) and \"Horseman!\" (Fantastic, August 1962).[2] \"Passion Play\" was written and sold first.[2] His first story to attract major attention was \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\", published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, with cover art by Hannes Bok.\n\nRoger Zelazny was also a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of Heroic Fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in Lin Carter's Flashing Swords! anthologies.\n\nRaised as a Catholic by his parents,[2] Zelazny later declared himself a lapsed Catholic and remained that way for the rest of his life.[3] \"I did have a strong Catholic background, but I am not a Catholic. Somewhere in the past, I believe I answered in the affirmative once for strange and complicated reasons. But I am not a member of any organized religion.\"[3]\n\nZelazny died in 1995, aged 58, of kidney failure secondary to colorectal cancer.[4] Other sources have incorrectly indicated lung cancer.[5]\n\nCharacteristic themes[]\n\nIn his stories, Roger Zelazny frequently portrayed familiar-seeming worlds with plausible magic systems and/or casually supernatural beings. His novels and short stories often involve characters from myth, depicted in the modern world. Zelazny was also apt to include numerous anachronistic present-day elements, such as cigarette-smoking (see below) and references to various drama classics into his fantasy and science-fiction works. His crisp, minimalistic dialogue also seems to be somewhat influenced by the style of wisecracking hardboiled crime authors, such as Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. The tension between the ancient and the modern, surreal and familiar was what drove most of his work.\n\nA very frequent motif in Zelazny's work is immortality or people who (have) become gods. The mythological traditions his fiction borrowed from include:\n\nClassical Greek mythology, in ...And Call Me Conrad\n\nHindu mythology, in Lord of Light\n\nNorse mythology, in The Mask of Loki\n\nPsychoanalysis, in The Dream Master\n\nEgyptian mythology in Creatures of Light and Darkness\n\nChristian mythology, in the novelette A Rose for Ecclesiastes\n\nNavajo mythology, in Eye of Cat\n\nLovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos (on a more humorous note) in A Night in the Lonesome October\n\nAdditionally, elements from Norse, Japanese and Irish mythology, Arthurian legend as well as several references to real history appear in his magnum opus, The Chronicles of Amber.\n\nAside from working with mythological themes, the most common recurring motif of Zelazny's is the \"absent father\" (or father-figure). Again, this occurs most notably in the Amber novels: in the first Amber series, the main protagonist Corwin searches for his lost, god-like father Oberon; while in the second series, which focuses on Corwin's son Merlin (not to be confused with the Arthurian Merlin!), it is Corwin himself who is strangely missing. This somewhat Freudian theme runs through almost every Zelazny novel to a smaller or larger degree. Roadmarks, Doorways in the Sand, Changeling, Madwand, A Dark Traveling; the short stories \"Dismal Light\", \"Godson\", \"The Keys to December\"; and the Alien Speedway series all feature main characters who are either searching for or have lost their fathers. Zelazny’s father, Joseph, died unexpectedly in 1962 and never knew his son’s successes as a writer; this event may have triggered Zelazny's unconscious and frequent use of the absent father motif.[6]\n\nTwo other personal characteristics that influenced his fiction were his expertise in martial arts and his addiction to tobacco. Zelazny became expert with the épée in college, and thus began a life-long study of several different martial arts, including Karate, Judo, Aikido (which he later taught as well, having gained a black belt), T'ai Chi, Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, Hsing I, and Pa Kua. In turn, many of his characters ably and knowledgeably use similar skills whilst dispatching their opponents. Zelazny was also a passionate cigarette and pipe smoker (until he quit in the early '80s), so much so, that he made many of his protagonists heavy smokers as well. However, he quit in order to improve his cardiovascular fitness for the martial arts; once he had quit, characters in his later novels and short stories stopped smoking too.[3]\n\nAnother characteristic of Zelazny's writing is that many of his protagonists had sufficient familiarity with other languages to be able to quote French, German, Italian or Latin aphorisms when the occasion seemed appropriate (or even inappropriate), although Zelazny himself did not speak any of those languages.\n\nHe also often experimented with form in his stories. The novel Doorways in the Sand practices a flashback technique in which most chapters open with a scene, typically involving peril, not implied by the end of the previous chapter. Once the scene is established, the narrator backtracks to the events leading up to it, then follows through to the end of the chapter, whereupon the next chapter jumps ahead to another dramatic non-sequitur.\n\nIn Roadmarks, a novel about a road system that links all possible times, places and histories, the chapters that feature the main protagonist are all titled \"One\". Other chapters, titled \"Two\", feature secondary characters, including original characters, pulp heroes, and real historical characters. The \"One\" storyline is fairly linear, whereas the \"Two\" storyline jumps around in time and sequence. After finishing the manuscript, Zelazny shuffled the \"Two\" chapters randomly among the \"One\" chapters in order to emphasize their non-linear nature relative to the storyline.[7]\n\nCreatures of Light and Darkness, featuring characters in the personae of Egyptian gods, uses a narrative voice entirely in the present tense; the final chapter is structured as a play, and several chapters take the form of long poems.\n\nZelazny also tended to write a short fragment, not intended for publication, as a kind of backstory for a major character, as a way of giving that character a life independent of the particular novel being worked on. At least one \"fragment\" was published, the short story Dismal Light, originally a backstory for Isle of the Dead's Francis Sandow. Sandow himself figures little in Dismal Light, the main character being his son, who is delaying his escape from an unstable star system in order to force his distant father to come in and ask him personally. While Isle of the Dead has Sandow living a life of irresponsible luxury as an escape from his personal demons, \"Dismal Light\" anchors his character as one who will face up to his responsibilities, however reluctantly.\n\nAnother common stylistic approach in his novels is the use of mixed genres, whereby elements of each are combined freely and interchangeably. Jack of Shadows and Changeling, for example, revolve around the tensions between the two worlds of magic and technology. Lord of Light, perhaps one of his most famous works, is written in the classic style of a mythic fantasy, while it is established early in the book that the story itself takes place on a colonized planet.[8]\n\nMany of Zelazny's works explore variations upon the idea that if there exists an infinite number of worlds, then every world that can be imagined must exist, somewhere. Powerful beings in many of his stories have the ability to travel to worlds that possess precisely the characteristics which that being wishes to experience. (Zelazny characters with this ability include Thoth in Creatures of Light and Darkness, who teleports to these worlds; those with the royal blood of either Amber or Chaos in The Chronicles of Amber, who \"move through shadows\" to reach these worlds; and Red Dorakeen in Roadmarks, who reaches these worlds by driving along a magical highway.) Many of these same characters wonder whether they are creating these special places anew, or are merely finding places which already exist (very much like \"the problem of universals\" in classical metaphysics). Usually each character who ponders this ultimately decides that the question is purely academic and therefore unanswerable.\n\nPublished works[]\n\nZelazny is probably best known for the The Chronicles of Amber, although his earlier works won greater critical acclaim.\n\nAmber[]\n\nMain article: The Chronicles of Amber\n\nThe Chronicles of Amber comprise two distinct series of five novels and several short stories.\n\nThe first five books describe the adventures of Prince Corwin of Amber:\n\n1970 Nine Princes in Amber\n\n1972 The Guns of Avalon\n\n1975 Sign of the Unicorn\n\n1976 The Hand of Oberon\n\n1978 The Courts of Chaos\n\nThe second series tells the story of Corwin's son Merlin (Merle), a wizard and computer expert. These volumes are:\n\n1985 Trumps of Doom - Locus Fantasy Award winner, 1986[9]\n\n1986 Blood of Amber - Locus Fantasy Award nominee, 1987[10]\n\n1987 Sign of Chaos - Locus Fantasy Award nominee, 1988[11]\n\n1989 Knight of Shadows\n\n1991 Prince of Chaos\n\nZelazny also wrote seven short stories set in the Amber multiverse. Here they are listed in Zelazny's intended order,[4] with first publication dates.\n\n2005 \"A Secret of Amber\" [story fragment co-written with Ed Greenwood between 1977 and 1992,[4] published in Amberzine #12-15]\n\n1985 \"Prolog to Trumps of Doom\"\n\n1994 \"The Salesman's Tale\"\n\n1995 \"Blue Horse, Dancing Mountains\"\n\n1994 \"The Shroudling and The Guisel\"\n\n1995 \"Coming to a Cord\"\n\n1996 \"Hall of Mirrors\"\n\nThe latter five of these stories form one tale set after Prince of Chaos, the last novel, so they are latest in Amber history.\n\nAll 10 novels have been published in a single omnibus form as The Great Book of Amber and six of the seven short stories were collected in Manna from Heaven. A sex scene deleted from The Guns of Avalon has been published in Collected Stories, volume 3,[12] while the seven Amber short tales appear in volumes 6.\n\nZelazny collaborated on a companion book, The Visual Guide to Castle Amber (1988), by Zelazny and Neil Randall, illustrated by Todd Cameron Hamilton and James Clouse.[13] The Guide is a reference work providing biographical detail on the Amber characters and a walk-through guide to Castle Amber itself.\n\nJohn Betancourt has written a series of novels set in the Amber multiverse set several centuries before Nine Princes in Amber. Betancourt's series tells the story of Corwin's father Oberon, a wizard and shapeshifter. That the Zelazny estate authorized the series has caused some controversy; see The Chronicles of Amber for more details.\n\nAn interactive fiction computer game based on Nine Princes in Amber was released by Telarium in 1987. The Amber novels also inspired a unique role-playing game, lacking any random element: Amber Diceless Roleplaying, published by Phage Press.\n\nOther novels and short novels[]\n\nThis Immortal (1966) (initially serialized in abridged form in 1965 as ...And Call Me Conrad, the author's preferred title) - Hugo Award winner, 1966[14]\n\nThe Dream Master (1966) (an expansion of the novella \"He Who Shapes\" (1965) which was reprinted in Science Fiction Origins (1980), ISBN 0-445-04626-0; the film Dreamscape began from Zelazny's outline which he based on \"He Who Shapes\"/The Dream Master, but he was not involved in the film after they bought the outline.)[7]\n\nLord of Light (1967) - Nebula Award nominee, 1967;[15] Hugo Award winner, 1968[16]\n\nCreatures of Light and Darkness (1969)\n\nIsle of the Dead (1969) - Nebula Award nominee, 1969[17]\n\nDamnation Alley (1969) (on which a film of the same name was based)\n\nJack of Shadows (1971) - Hugo and Locus SF Awards nominee, 1972[18]\n\nToday We Choose Faces (1973)\n\nTo Die in Italbar (1973) (cameo appearance by Francis Sandow from Isle of the Dead)\n\nDoorways in the Sand (1976) - Nebula Award nominee, 1975;[19] Hugo Award nominee, 1976[20]\n\nBridge of Ashes (1976)\n\nMy Name is Legion (1976) (considered a fix-up novel in three parts, or a collection of 3 stories)\n\nRoadmarks (1979)\n\nChangeling (1980) - Locus Fantasy Award nominee, 1981[21]\n\nMadwand (1981) (a sequel to Changeling)\n\nThe Changing Land (1981) - Locus Fantasy Award 1982[22]\n\nDilvish, the Damned (1982) (a \"fix-up\" novel or short story collection that precedes events in The Changing Land)\n\nEye of Cat (1982)\n\nA Dark Traveling (1987)\n\nWizard World (1989) (omnibus containing Changeling and Madwand)\n\nHere There Be Dragons (1992) (written 1968/69 and illustrated by Vaughn Bodé; delayed publication until 1992)\n\nWay Up High (1992) (written 1968/69 and illustrated by Vaughn Bodé; delayed publication until 1992)\n\nA Night in the Lonesome October (1993) (illustrated by Gahan Wilson) - Nebula Award nominee, 1994[23]\n\nThe Dead Man's Brother (2009) (mystery/thriller novel completed in 1971, finally published in 2009)\n\nCollaborations[]\n\nDeus Irae (1976) (with Philip K.
