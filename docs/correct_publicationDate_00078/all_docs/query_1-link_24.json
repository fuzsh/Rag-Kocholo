        "text": "Dune\n\nBy Frank Herbert,\n\nFrom my list on Sci-Fi real science that justifies unreal things.\n\nBy Johnny B. Truant Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBefore I was an author, I was a scientist pursuing a PhD in molecular genetics. When I left the lab and started writing, that scientist’s need for real-world sense stuck with me and became a theme in everything I write. The authors I like understand that “suspension of disbelief” is a limited resource, so they’d better only ask readers for it when it counts. Get the baseline facts and logic right, and I’ll believe and enjoy the fantastical stuff spun from it so much more.\n\nJohnny's book list on Sci-Fi real science that justifies unreal things\n\nWhy did Johnny love this book?\n\nThis has been one of my favorite books since I was a kid. I love it for two main reasons: The first is that I’m a fiend for exploring the real limits of ability (which the Bene Gesserit and Fremen do). The second is that as fantastical as the world is, it’s grounded in real science.\n\nThere are no giant sandworts on my own planet, but I completely believe why and how they’d exist on Arrakis. Herbert even includes an appendix to explain how it works, called “The Ecology of Dune.”\n\nFiction requires a leap of faith, but the real-science grounding in Dune makes that leap a whole lot easier because I believe where it’s coming from.\n\nBy Frank Herbert,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n58 authors picked Dune as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBefore The Matrix, before Star Wars, before Ender's Game and Neuromancer, there was Dune: winner of the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards, and widely considered one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written.\n\nMelange, or 'spice', is the most valuable - and rarest - element in the universe; a drug that does everything from increasing a person's lifespan to making interstellar travel possible. And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world of Arrakis.\n\nWhoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. And whoever controls the spice controls the universe.\n\nWhen the Emperor transfers stewardship of…\n\nPreview\n\nAll the Windwracked Stars\n\nBy Elizabeth Bear,\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi incorporating various earth cultures.\n\nBy Bruce Golden Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI've always been interested in Native American culture, while at the same time horrified at the way most European settlers treated them. (My best friend as a child was Native American.) Without consciously planning on it, many of my other books and short stories feature Native American customs and characters—though not as thoroughly as Red Sky, Blue Moon. I've also always been fascinated by Viking history, though I only recently discovered I'm a direct descendant of a fairly famous Viking—Rollo. I had no particular expertise with these cultures when I began this book, but I spent many hours of research to be sure I got everything right.\n\nBruce's book list on sci-fi incorporating various earth cultures\n\nWhy did Bruce love this book?\n\nI loved the use of Norse mythology and culture in this book, which is the first in a series. Once again I was enveloped in marvelous world-building and a society from Earth that both transformed and stayed the same, light years away from where it originated. It's full of beautiful language and astounding images. Many stories are described as \"epic,\" but this one truly is. I also like how it's sometimes difficult to tell the heroes from the villains because the characters are all so well-rounded.\n\nBy Elizabeth Bear,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked All the Windwracked Stars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt all began with Ragnarok, with the Children of the Light and the Tarniished Ones battling to the death in the ice and the dark. At the end of the long battle, one Valkyrie survived, and one valraven - the steeds of the Valkyrie. Because they lived, Valdyrgard was not wholly destroyed. Because the valraven was transformed in the last miracle offered to a Child of the Light, Valdyrgard was changed to a world where magic and technology worked hand in hand. More than two thousand years later, Muire is in the last city on the dying planet, where the…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Stand\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nFrom my list on that were adapted into worse movies.\n\nBy Christopher Calvin Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up a child of the movies, open to watching anything at least once and countlessly rewatching the movies I loved. When not in front of a television, I was instead in front of a book, playing the words of the page out in my imagination. Now I write thrillers of multiple varieties (action, techno, paranormal, etc.), still visualizing words as movies playing out in my mind. Over the years, I’ve seen the quality of novel adaptations grow (e.g., Harry Potter, The Martian, etc.), and yet these staples of my youth have always stuck with me as lost opportunities to deliver a superior work to the general movie-watching audience.\n\nChristopher's book list on that were adapted into worse movies\n\nWhy did Christopher love this book?\n\nAt a whopping 1,152 pages, Stephen King’s The Stand was just too much to capture in a single movie.\n\nThat’s why, in 1994, CBS adapted it across four, ninety-minute episodes of a limited run “mini-series” (a fancy way of saying “a really long movie”). In all fairness, it had a great cast and was better than it had any right to be, and was far more enjoyable than CBS’s 2020 attempt at a do-over.\n\nBut even with a total six-hour runtime, it couldn’t capture all the story, heart, and nuance that made the book so incredible. It’s a feat to read, one I did to pass the time when bored in school, and one I will surely do again in the future.\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n19 authors picked The Stand as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nStephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by virus and tangled in an elemental struggle between good and evil remains as riveting and eerily plausible as when it was first published.\n\nSoon to be a television series.\n\n'THE STAND is a masterpiece' (Guardian). Set in a virus-decimated US, King's thrilling American fantasy epic, is a Classic.\n\nFirst come the days of the virus. Then come the dreams.\n\nDark dreams that warn of the coming of the dark man. The apostate of death, his worn-down boot heels tramping the night roads. The warlord of the charnel house and Prince of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Crystal World\n\nBy J.G. Ballard,\n\nFrom my list on where the forest feels like a character.\n\nBy Darragh McManus Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m an Irish author who lives close to three very different forests: deciduous, planted coniferous, and the planned gardens of a former stately home that once welcomed WB Yeats and several other famous writers. I’ve always loved the woods – it often feels like stepping through a portal into some other, stranger parallel world – and drew huge inspiration from these places for Shiver the Whole Night Through. I wanted the forest to feel like a character, which was sentient and had agency. I incorporated several real-life locations into the fictional Shook Woods…and wrote a lot of the story in the forest, gazing into the dark trees, waiting for them to speak.\n\nDarragh's book list on where the forest feels like a character\n\nWhy did Darragh love this book?\n\nA tropical forest in Africa is the epicentre of a bizarre and very troubling phenomenon. Through a sort of “leak” in space-time, everything is slowly turning to crystal, and this “disease” will eventually seep out into the rest of the world. An English doctor goes on an Apocalypse Now-style journey into the forest to try and understand. Ballard’s sci-fi classic is as weird and thought-provoking as always, and the forest itself is a palpable presence throughout.\n\nBy J.G. Ballard,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Crystal World as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom J. G. Ballard, author of 'Crash' and 'Cocaine Nights' comes his extraordinary vision of an African forest that turns all in its path to crystal.\n\nThrough a 'leaking' of time, the West African jungle starts to crystallize. Trees metamorphose into enormous jewels. Crocodiles encased in second glittering skins lurch down the river. Pythons with huge blind gemstone eyes rear in heraldic poses. Most flee the area in terror, afraid to face a catastrophe they cannot understand.\n\nBut some, dazzled and strangely entranced, remain to drift through this dreamworld forest: a doctor in pursuit of his ex-mistress, an enigmatic Jesuit…\n\nPreview\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz\n\nBy Walter M. Miller, Jr.,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian and sci-fantasy novels.\n\nBy Stephen M. Sanders Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a sci-fi/fantasy fan ever since my dad introduced me to the original Star Trek (in reruns) and The Lord of the Rings in my youth. I’ve always loved thinking about possibilities—large and small—so my work tends to think big when I write. I also write poetry, which allows me to talk about more than just the everyday or at least to find the excitement within the mundane in life. These works talk about those same “possibilities”—for better or worse, and in reading, I walk in awareness of what could be.\n\nStephen's book list on dystopian and sci-fantasy novels\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nI loved this book for its tragic characters and its ultra-meticulous plotting. Walter M. Miller only published one book in his lifetime, and I’m so happy he did. I read it every time I want to see “how it’s done,” and walk away amazed.\n\nBy Walter M. Miller, Jr.,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked A Canticle for Leibowitz as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the depths of the Utah desert, long after the Flame Deluge has scoured the earth clean, a monk of the Order of Saint Leibowitz has made a miraculous discovery: holy relics from the life of the great saint himself, including the blessed blueprint, the sacred shopping list, and the hallowed shrine of the Fallout Shelter.\n\nIn a terrifying age of darkness and decay, these artifacts could be the keys to mankind's salvation. But as the mystery at the core of this groundbreaking novel unfolds, it is the search itself—for meaning, for truth, for love—that offers hope for humanity's rebirth…\n\nPreview\n\nThe End of Eternity\n\nBy Isaac Asimov,\n\nFrom my list on hard science fiction by old masters.\n\nBy Stefan Vučak Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI became hooked into science fiction as a kid the day I read an illustrated book of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. From then on, science fiction became an important part of my reading repertoire. Having wide-ranging interests, I enjoy military techno-thrillers, Anglo-French naval warfare, Greek/Egyptian/Roman mythology, most sciences, history of religions, with an occasional novel that strays from the norm and adds a sparkle to my reading. Mary Stewart’s The Crystal Cave and The Hollow Hills are very close to my heart. Just shows that I’m different. After all, I must do something when I am not writing my own novels! Although I have an extensive library of modern science fiction works, I am fond of many oldies.\n\nStefan's book list on hard science fiction by old masters\n\nWhy did Stefan love this book?\n\nTold by a master storyteller I enjoy reading, this book grabbed me immediately and drew me inexorably into the main character’s life as an eternity technician.\n\nNot a unique theme – man manipulating his future – but I liked the twist when all future is threatened for the love of one woman. I kept turning pages, wanting to know how my hero would reconcile forbidden love at the price of eternity’s end.\n\nThis is a thoughtful book that denied me peace until it ended. I liked the technical concepts revealed in the story and how they were woven into very human reactions. A lesson for our modern time?\n\nBy Isaac Asimov,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked The End of Eternity as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA spellbinding novel set in the universe of Isaac Asimov’s classic Galactic Empire series and Foundation series\n\nDue to circumstances within our control . . . tomorrow will be canceled.\n\nThe Eternals, the ruling class of the Future, had the power of life and death not only over every human being but over the very centuries into which they were born. Past, Present, and Future could be created or destroyed at will.\n\nYou had to be special to become an Eternal. Andrew Harlan was special. Until he committed the one unforgivable sin—falling in love.\n\nEternals weren’t supposed to have feelings.…\n\nPreview\n\nEinstein Intersection\n\nBy Samuel R. Delany,\n\nWhy did A.A. love this book?\n\nWhen I first read this novel at age 15, I knew upon finishing that I wanted to be a science fiction writer. The strangeness of the tale enchanted me. And, by dint of that spell, my mind opened to the author’s philosophical insights about identity, cultural dreaming, and sexuality. Set on a far-future Earth where humanity is a mythical memory, the narrator assumes an identity based on Orpheus – and so, lost love and music play witching roles. Meaning is elusive, and that's part of the book's charm. Meaning in this story is also allusive, and the many legendary and literary references in the telling wander far from their origins and lead us to unexpected associations with our own time and lives.\n\nBy Samuel R. Delany,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Einstein Intersection as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA nonhuman race reimagines human mythology.\n\nThe Einstein Intersection won the Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of 1967. The surface story tells of the problems a member of an alien race, Lo Lobey, has assimilating the mythology of earth, where his kind have settled among the leftover artifacts of humanity. The deeper tale concerns, however, the way those who are \"different\" must deal with the dominant cultural ideology. The tale follows Lobey's mythic quest for his lost love, Friza. In luminous and hallucinated language, it explores what new myths might emerge from the detritus of the human world…\n\nPreview\n\nCosmicomics\n\nBy Italo Calvino, William Weaver (translator),\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nCalvino’s Cosmicomics is perhaps the funniest and most outlandish collections of short stories I’ve ever come across. Think Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time meets Alice in Wonderland. Starting with the Big Bang and charting the entire evolution of the universe and of life on Earth, Calvino’s narrator shape-shifts from a man, to a dinosaur, to a mollusk, a single-cell organism, a subatomic particle, and even a disembodied being. In this linked collection of modern fairy tales, the author displays wild flights of imagination, combining scientific rigor with an uproarious repudiation of logic. Oh, and the narrator’s name is Qfwfq.\n\nBy Italo Calvino, William Weaver (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Cosmicomics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIntroducing Little Clothbound Classics: irresistible, mini editions of short stories, novellas and essays from the world's greatest writers, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith.\n\nCelebrating the range and diversity of Penguin Classics, they take us from snowy Japan to springtime Vienna, from haunted New England to a sun-drenched Mediterranean island, and from a game of chess on the ocean to a love story on the moon. Beautifully designed and printed, these collectible editions are bound in colourful, tactile cloth and stamped with foil.\n\nTwelve enchanting and fantastical stories about the evolution of the universe from the giant of Italian literature,…\n\nPreview\n\nStar Maker\n\nBy Olaf Stapledon,\n\nWhy did Howard love this book?\n\nNo other book has influenced me so deeply. Arthur C. Clarke wrote it is \"probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written.\" As I now reread Star Maker, published in 1937 when I was three years old, I still find passages so profound that they send my mind into orbit. The book takes us through time and space to a future when that entire conscious cosmos yearns to meet its creator. It ends with a prophetic awareness that “the struggle of our age was brewing” and the hope that our species can make it “before the ultimate darkness.”\n\nBy Olaf Stapledon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Star Maker as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis bold exploration of the cosmos ventures into intelligent star clusters and mingles among alien races for a memorable vision of infinity. Cited as a key influence by science-fiction masters such as Doris Lessing, this classic has left its mark not only in modern literature but also in the fields of social anthropology and philosophy.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's 1937 successor to Last and First Men offers another entrancing speculative history of the future. Its narrator, a contemporary Earthman, joins a community of explorers who travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, seeking traces of intelligence. Along the way, they encounter…\n\nPreview"
