        "text": "BLACK ROAD TO ANOTHER REALITY\n\nIs Amber treading the path to destruction? Family blood has been spilled on the magic pattern that created Amber, threatening the whole kingdom with chaos. For Oberon, Amber's magical king, is missing. And this provides an entry for the monstrous evil forces that threaten from the dark alternative world of Shadow.\n\nBetween Amber and Shadow is now a black road that pumps evil.\n\nUpon the shoulders of the magus Lord Corwin falls the lot of finding King Oberon – and foiling the sinister alternative reality that is out to destroy Amber...\n\nTHE HAND OF OBERON is the new novel in the AMBER series – a brilliant creation of a weird alternative reality that bears all the scintillating marks of one of Science Fiction's supreme masters.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1969 Zelazny worked for the Social Security Administration in Cleveland and then in Baltimore, spending his evenings writing science fiction. He deliberately progressed from short-shorts to novelettes to novellas and finally to novel-length works by 1965. On 1969 he quit to become a full-time writer, and thereafter concentrated on writing novels in order to maintain his income.\n\nZelazny was married twice, in 1964 in 1966.\n\nZelazny was considered one of the leading lights of the ”New Wave” movement in science fiction in the 1960s. He incorporated elements from literary novels of the mainstream into his fiction, and experimented with allusion, lyricism, and mythic imagery. His stories often involved characters from myth, depicted in the modern world. Zelazny's fiction was also highly influenced by wisecracking detective fiction. He was also apt to include modern elements, such as cigarettes, in his fantasy worlds.\n\nA frequent theme is gods or people who become gods. Another recurrent theme is the ”absent father” (or father-figure)."
