        "text": "This Immortal is one of Roger Zelazny’s best known books, but some may know it under the title of “… and Call me Conrad”. Under that name it won the Hugo award of 1966, in a tied win with Frank Herbert’s Dune. It may not have gained the popularity of that other winner, and might even be regarded as largely forgotten now, but let’s see what made This Immortal so acclaimed at the time.\n\nThis Immortal starts with a lot of flimflam about a guy named Conrad having languid, teasing conversations with his girlfriend and his colleagues at tiresome cocktail parties. Slowly, though, the shape of the story and the world emerges: in the far future, Earth has been destroyed in war and only a few million humans still live on the planet, many with strange mutations. The surface of the planet is curated as a giant open air museum and Conrad is one of the curators. He has to function as a tourist guide for a visiting alien journalist from the star Vega, and doesn’t like that at all.\n\nAs one of the instigators of the New Wave period of SF writing, Zelazny wrote his stories in unconventional ways, using a slapdash, almost improvisational way to throw scenes together and sketching out the history of his characters and the future in throwaway lines. To me, it comes across as unfocused and his dialogues try too hard to be zany. Although, Conrad does have a funny deadpan humor. There are hints that he is much older than he looks and he’s emotionally detached and ready to be snarky.\n\nZelazny treats his themes in the same chaotic way; so on Conrad’s tour around the world, Conrad battles mutants to protect his alien tourist and also a secret society of revolutionaries who fear that the alien is there to buy Earth real estate. The hedonic Vegans come to Earth as tourists and set up luxury resorts and culturally appropriate the remains of our planet. On top of all of that, Zelazny throws in voodoo magic, telepathy and Greek mythology. The radioactive mutants, including Conrad himself, are all described as creatures from myth, nymphs and so on, and this feels like a dry run for Zelazny for his later novels Lord of Light (Indian religions) and Creatures of Light and Darkness (Egyptian mythology).\n\nThe most successful and enjoyable part of the novel is the rich aliens doing the ethno-tourism part. He really nails it, complete with alien intellectuals writing books about humanity and the casual arrogance of the tourist.\n\nIt is a feisty little novel and an intriguing travelogue, but it is also trying to achieve things that might have been cool in the 1960s, but leave me a bit cold. I didn’t understand the point of the Greek mythology angle and for most of the book the story didn’t seem to be going anywhere. Much of it depends on whether Conrad appeals to you as a character, and Zelazny has a tendency to give his main characters superhuman abilities and cheekiness, which annoys me a bit. In this sense, Conrad is a good prototype for Zelazny’s future characters Corwin and Jack of Shadows.\n\nThe end does tie things up nicely and the story is worth reading for the alien tourist theme.\n\n7.5/10"
