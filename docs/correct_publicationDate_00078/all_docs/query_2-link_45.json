        "text": "What's \"high fantasy\"? When I was a kid, that meant J. R. R. Tolkien. You know, make-believe worlds with monsters, magic, maps, and muttering in made-up languages. Not the pulp fiction stuff, but quality literature accessible to egg-headed 11 year olds.\n\nNow, I hadn't touched Tolkien since childhood, but then the Lord Of The Rings movies came out and I was hooked again - me and a billion other people. Unlike a billion other people, however, I got strangely obsessed with the question, \"Where the heck did Tolkien come up with this stuff?\" Actually, if I'd been paying any attention I would have realized he got his ideas straight from sources like Beowulf and Norse mythology, and probably honestly claimed to be completely uninfluenced by modern high fantasy novels. But being an idiot intent on wasting vast amounts of leisure time, I embarked on a quest to find truly Tolkien-esque novels that predated the master himself, and some of Tolkien's more obscure works like The Silmarillion (see below).\n\nMy quest failed, kind of, except that I discovered E. R. Eddison's strange, parallel development of a Middle Earth-like world, and had some fun with authors like Dunsany and Morris. Maybe I should have stuck with old swords & sorcery hacks like Robert Ervin Howard, or the classic fantasy adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs. But I'm trying to at least pretend I've outgrown my childhood, and this body of high fantasy fiction has a little more depth. So I don't feel too guilty about trying to talk you into checking some of this stuff out.\n\nNow obviously, I'm not done wasting my time yet. First of all, most of the classic pre-Tolkien novels fell into obscurity in the mid-20th century, but were revived in the late 60s and early 70s by the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, edited by Lin Carter. I'm now systematically working through the books in that series that are closest to the high fantasy genre. I'm trying to exclude books that are set in distant futures, imaginary pasts, or altered historical periods of the planet Earth, although I'm making exceptions for some books drawing on traditional mythological sources like the Mabinogion.\n\nSecond, there's the dubious issue of swords & sorcery. There is a fine line between high fantasy and that genre. The former stems from Morris, the latter from Howard; the former often betrays its artistic pretensions with classical scholarship, the latter doesn't, and was produced for pulp fiction magazines and cheap trade paperbacks; the former focuses on conveying a sense of mystery and magic and is often pretty cerebral, the latter is entirely focused on delivering fast-paced adventure plotlines. But both genres are about heroes battling their way through fantasy worlds with medieval milieus, the afore-mentioned monsters and magic, and typically pantheistic mythologies.\n\nSo despite my dig at REH, I am going to break down and review a couple of the classic series. According to Lin Carter, the major authors through the early 70s were Poul Anderson, Carter, L. Sprague de Camp, John Jakes, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock, Andre Norton, and Jack Vance. I'm interested in Moorcock because I found his hero Elric compelling when I was a child, and in Norton because she was the only prominent female writer in the genre back in the old days, so she might have an interesting point of view.\n\nFinally, despite the focus on predecessors to Tolkien, we're including some high fantasy writers from the first wave of the post-Tolkien era (meaning, from the mid-60s on). In particular, Katherine Kurtz, Ursula Le Guin, Evangeline Walton, and Roger Zelazny seem like the highest priority.\n\nHere are the books I have on my shelf...\n\nPoul Anderson, The Broken Sword; The High Crusade; Fantasy\n\nHannes Bok, Beyond The Golden Stair\n\nJames Branch Cabell, four more lousy books\n\nHumphrey Carpenter, Tolkien: A Biography\n\nLin Carter, Thongor Against The Gods; Thongor And The Wizard Of Lemuria; The Enchantress Of World's End\n\nLin Carter (editor), Flashing Swords! #1; Flashing Swords! #2; Flashing Swords! #3 (anthologies of stories by Poul Anderson, Carter, Avram Davidson, John Jakes, Katherine Kurtz, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock, Andre Norton, L.

(JA)\n\nI have to take some of the blame for Alroy's latest obsession; I think I was the one who pointed him toward Eddison when he was first looking for Tolkien antecedents. To those of you who think fantasy is silly and childish I would say, well, yeah, that's what's so great about it. Except for high fantasy, which is equally silly - or more - but not childish. Anyway, here's some stuff I'm either looking for, have lying around somewhere in my apartment, or have read but haven't gotten around to writing up:\n\nE. R. Eddison, A Fish Dinner At Memison; The Mezentian Gate\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, The Farthest Shore; Tehanu\n\nMervyn Peake, Gormenghast; Titus Alone\n\n(DBW)\n\nPage introduction by John Alroy. Dueling reviews by John Alroy (JA) and David Bertrand Wilson (DBW). Yeah, the record review guys. Gotta blame someone."
