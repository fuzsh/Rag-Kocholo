        "text": "I liked the first 5 books very much, but then when the point of view switched from Corwin to Merlin, I didn't like it nearly as much. There was something in that first part of Amber that made it special - all those brothers and sisters intriguing and fighting one another in order to become Oberon's heir.. and I found the rules of the world of Amber very appealing. Merlin was both from Chaos and from Amber - it got too complicated for me. And, above all, I didn't care for that character quite as much as for Corwin with his silver - black clothes and his rose\n\nBTW, what were your fav characters in the series beside the main ones? I liked Deirdre, but that was probably because of Corwin's point of view, and then she was killed... and Julian. The Arden forest was cool!\n\nBesides, I liked Oberon. Afterwards, it was boring without him.\n\nThe first book of the series, Nine Princes in Amber, is my favorite book of all time. I first read it when I was about 14, and when I got to about page 40 where Corwin and Random are driving down the road and suddenly there were \"big yellow windmills\" all over the place, I was a Zelazny fan for life. I've read Nine Princes so many times I've got parts of it memorized. Zelazny was my favorite author and I still miss him. It's a pity he died as young as he did.\n\nOn another note, yes, he did write Damnation Alley. A few of his more well known titles are Lord of Light, Creatures of Light and Darkness, The Changeling, A Night in the Lonesome October, My Name is Legion, A Rose for Ecclesiastes, Roadmarks, The Changing Land, Jack of Shadows, etc. Overall, Zelazny was considered by many fans and writers to be one of the best in the spec-fi field.\n\nTerry\n\nI'll just echo everyone else's comments that the Chronicles Of Amber is a very worthwhile and significant work of fantasy.\n\nFor those who have not yet tackled it and wish to explore a classic of the past I can recommend it to anyone. However I agree with Finvarre that the first chronicles is better than the second, although both are still very good.\n\nJohn Betancourt has written the main Amber prequels and they're not bad but he's no Zelazny. The third book in his first Amber prequel trilogy \"To Rule In Amber\" is probably the best of the bunch. If you're a die hard Zelazny fan then you'll probably want to check them out but for the rest I'd stick to the original Amber series by the master himself.\n\nPerhaps Terry or another Zelazny fan has read these and could pass on their comments?\n\nBTW his SF classic Lord Of Light could and has been argued by many as his greatest work. Of course in the end that comes down to personal taste.\n\nGOLLUM said:\n\nPerhaps Terry or another Zelazny fan has read these and could pass on their comments.\n\nOkay, I'll give my own answer for whatever that's worth...\n\nI tried to read the first Betancourt Amber prequel, and put it down after 5 - 10 pages. It was obvious that Betancourt didn't possess Zelazny's magic with prose or storytelling, so for me, it was like reading a pale imitation of my favorite author.\n\nAlso, according to the storyline of the original series, Amber was created after Oberon and Dworkin fled the Courts of Chaos and established an island of order, Amber, at the other end of existence from chaos. The idea being, that order and chaos then balanced each other out like the opposite poles of a magnet. All of the shadow worlds, the parallel universes of the Amber series, came into existence as a result of the constant ebb and flow between the energies of order and chaos.\n\nIn the opening of Betancourt's book, however, Oberon isn't fleeing primordial chaos to establish a kingdom of order. He's riding in a coach in a Renaissance-type world like some sort of swashbuckling dandy. Question: If Renaissance universes or shadows exist, that implies a high degree of order. Why do Dworkin and Oberon need to escape from chaos to create Amber, if there is already oder in the universe? So Betancourt had about five pages or so to impress me, and he didn't. If you're going to do an Amber prequel, show me Oberon and Dworkin fleeing chaos, real chaos, to create order.\n\nThere's also the point that Zelazny, as I understand it, plainly stated that he didn't want other authors \"playing in his universe.\" Such being the case, why the Betancourt books? That's like saying, \"Because Amber is such a popular series, regardless of what Zelazny wanted, we'll wait until he's dead, and then come out with more Amber books anyway. Think of the money we can make.\"\n\nThe Betancourt books, from what I've seen aren't going to satisfy any true Zelazny fan. The best Betancourt can hope for is to reach new readers not that familiar with original series, or with Zelazny in general, and to build a new fan base for the prequel novels. I'd say that if he's successful, those readers would then become Betancourt's fans, not Zelazny's.\n\nAs to where I come down on this, I'd say leave classic sci-fi authors alone. If they invite other authors to write stories set in their universe, as Andre Norton did with the Witch World, or Asimov did with Foundation, that's one thing. If they say, \"I'd just as soon not have other people writing stories about my characters or my worlds,\" I think those wishes should be respected, especially since no following author is ever going to sound like, or have the unique magic of the original author's voice.\n\nThose are my thoughts at the moment. Best wishes, Terry"
