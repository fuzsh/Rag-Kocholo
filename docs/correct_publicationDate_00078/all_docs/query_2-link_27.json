        "text": "I chuckled with excitement several times during the read. That's always a sign that I'm invested in the plot and the fate of the characters. There were some utterly brilliant scenes here and there, but I'll refrain from going into details and try to keep this review mostly spoiler-free.\n\nThe story is solid and visual. It would be easy to turn this into a movie or streaming series.\n\nThis book is sort of a modern (and more realistic) version of the Independence Day movie,‚Ä¶or at least they share the theme and setting (war and first contact.) Less so in the sense that this is an action blockbuster script‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs action in this book, but it‚Äôs more a story about people‚Ä¶and about the art of war.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a well-written story. Enjoyable and engaging. And unless you specifically do not like sci-fi books about people in the military and/or astronauts, I think you‚Äôll enjoy it.\n\nA broader perspective\n\nSeveral main characters are Americans, and parts of the story occur on US soil. Likely due to the author being an Australian, born in New Zealand, the characters have a broad view of the world. It was refreshing to see important parts of the book take place in Asia and Europe and to get realistic descriptions of life and people in these places, like mentioning the noise level found in the big cities of India. Still, to this day, the sheer power of the street noises combined with especially the multitude of cars constantly honking their horns was a unique experience for me...and sure made it very difficult to sleep at night.\n\nI think the world could use more sci-fi that's not afraid of showing the reader that the world is quite large and that people in other countries have much value, too. Not to mention different perspectives that might one day help us fight a war against a superior enemy...like hostile aliens.\n\nA provocative title\n\nI chose to read this book because I like military sci-fi and aliens. I‚Äôll admit that I was provoked by the title, however.\n\nIt better be good!\n\nI guess some will think it is in poor taste to re-use the title of a famous and ancient book (you‚Äôre allowed to do this legally, though.) At least, I remember thinking something like, ‚ÄúThis book better be really good, or I'll give the author a hard time!‚Äù\n\nI read the ancient work of military philosophy, The Art of War by Sun Tzu long ago (he‚Äôs the ‚Äústatue guy‚Äù on the cover of Peter Cawdron‚Äôs book.) And to this day, the original still has much to offer I'd recommend reading it (don‚Äôt worry, it's quite short and easy to read.)\n\nAfter reading this ‚Äúversion‚Äù of The Art of War, I don't have an issue with the title abuse, and if it sells, it could open the eyes of a new generation to the ancient wisdom of Sun Tzu.\n\nThe stuff I‚Äôd do differently\n\nBeing an author myself, you might wonder if I noticed a lot of mistakes or found the story lacking here and there. Not so much, no.\n\nThe only part that bored me was a section at the back (an appendix about scientific stuff and military tech.) Some might think this is the best part. I could have done without it. Still, it's nice that the author spent time researching stuff.\n\nHad I been the editor, I‚Äôd have asked Peter Cawdron to leave certain meta-plane references out. His story is engaging, so, why not keep me reading and engaged the whole way?\n\nI would not have given one of the astronauts a last name that is known to everyone who knows anything about astronauts. It drew me out of the story. Nor would I have made references to films like Independence Day. I get the meta-plane sort of joke with the characters feeling like they are in a movie. A feeling I‚Äôve experienced in real life, too. But the difference between real life and fiction is that I‚Äôm still in my real life even if I have a meta-plane thought. Whereas in a story, meta-plane references often draw me out of the fun parts. I‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúIs this book inspired by this or that reference? Is that why the author feels a need to mention it? Or, Don‚Äôt they take their own story seriously?‚Äù\n\nWhatever the case, I‚Äôll stop reading. I‚Äôd rather stay immersed.\n\nI‚Äôm not in love with the title either. From a marketing perspective, I do see an argument for some of the coolness of the original work rubbing off. It sure makes it easy to remember the title. But it has downsides. Some will be provoked or get confused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for Sun Tzu‚Äôs book. What is this?‚Äù And if a reader searches for the new version, it‚Äôs difficult to find. A search on Amazon (even including the author‚Äôs name) begins with a great many editions of the ancient book. You‚Äôll have to scroll quite a bit to find the new version.\n\nStill, I've made worse mistakes as an author and the important part is that I had a great time in the company of Peter Cawdron's words.\n\nIf fantasy books don‚Äôt inspire you what does?\n\nThat‚Äôs a gross oversimplification. I still read fantasy, and many series, I read earlier on, inspire me to this day.\n\nI do have this issue that I‚Äôve gotten so used to editing my work, that any text I read I instantly want to change, like removing a sentence, altering a character, or tweaking the worldbuilding.\n\nAlthough this might be just a phase, it does happen all the time and it ruins the experience (especially if the writing is not my cup of tea.)\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ writing has never been about copying the stuff that‚Äôs trending ‚Ä¶\n\nMostly I try to write and live my life üòä\n\nI find myself spending more time on other things, like playing games or watching series (I just watched the first six episodes of the Nevers on HBO. Some good writing there, but too many scenes with nudity that felt forced on the actors because they had little plot relevance.)\n\nMy style\n\nWhen I began writing, I decided two things, I wanted to find my own style (not just steal someone else‚Äôs way of doing things,) and I wanted to learn the ropes from authors that knew more than me.\n\nI was afraid that if I read fantasy while writing my own stuff, I might inadvertently copy ideas or styles of writing. I decided not to read any fantasy while I was writing my first book. I didn‚Äôt quite live up to it, though (couldn‚Äôt quite stay away.) What did I read then? Well, I enjoy science fiction, so a lot of that.\n\nOn the subject of style: for me, writing has never been about copying the stuff that‚Äôs trending or being into what everyone else is into. I‚Äôm also not a fan of authors whose writing is about shoveling their ideological agendas down the reader‚Äôs throat, especially where it makes the story uninspired and simple.\n\nHow did you know how to write fantasy ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù?\n\nSince I was careful not to copy by mistake anyone's writing style, I did at one point try to analyze how to make the best first page and first chapter. I did this by reading and analyzing the beginnings of a few specific fantasy books that I absolutely love.\n\nI wanted to understand how my favorite authors did it. Not to write the same way, but to find the essence of what they mastered (and I didn‚Äôt.) From there, I realized how little I knew, and so I began to read books by other authors about writing, and I watched authors talk about their writing (I still do this, every week, all year long.)\n\n‚ÄúI knew that I wanted to write something that I would love to read.\n\nMy reading habits became more of a ‚Äòhow do you do it, and do it well.‚Äô Using the examples, tips, tutorials, workshops, masterclasses, and whatever I could scrounge up. I still do this sort of thing WAY more than I read books for pleasure.\n\nWhat I learned from my favorite books\n\nYou might wonder what I got out of analyzing the beginnings of books that I love. Well, some of it was that they all started with scenes that have motion/action in them, and not only that but they have stuff that‚Äôs easy to visualize for the reader in a way that really puts the ‚Äòimages of the fantastic‚Äô (or the known) right into your mind and catches your interest right away.\n\nI also knew that I want to sell books (who doesn‚Äôt?) and so I had to figure out how to write something that people would like or even love.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure, but I knew that I wanted to write something that I would love to read. And since I love what for me is the classics (Lord of The Rings and Wheel of Time being my two favorite fantasy series of all time, but there are many other books besides them that I love) I thought about what it was in those stories that enthralled me, and why they work less well today. For instance, the reader‚Äôs attention span is next to nothing these days, and to capture someone you must make stuff interesting right away and keep it so.\n\nI tried to find the core of what I wanted to write, and I began my search by trying to capture what I loved most about fantasy. Now, you must understand that this is a difficult task as it‚Äôs an extremely wide genre. Fantasy encompasses such different things as stories about heroic knights of the round table, tragic mermaids, cool private investigator wizards in an urban modern world, bastard pirates who might fancy a dally romance, fantastic superheroes who defend their city, Jedis in outer space, dragons or elves that outlive and outthink humans, paranormal investigators, little fat boys or young girls who get lost in books, wardrobes, or holes below trees. And so much more üòä\n\nI narrowed what I like, down to a shortlist of the books that I love the most (in the genre that I write in.) Since I discovered the fantasy genre in the 1980‚Äôties (when my mother introduced me to The Hobbit, Lord of The Rings, The Brothers Lionheart, The NeverEnding Story, The Books of The Earthsea, and many other great works of fantasy,) I found that those books and stuff like the DragonLance Chronicles, The Wheel of Time Series, the books by Raymond E. Feist and others were still what inspired me (even though I had read a lot of contemporary stuff.)\n\nOn the other hand computer games like World of Warcraft, roleplaying games like D&D and Warhammer, and the movie version of Lord of The Rings inspire me just as much as any book.\n\n‚ÄúI plan to buy all the six winners of the SPFBO competitions ‚Ä¶\n\nNostalgia does play a part in my love, and I think that each generation has its own ‚Äúclassics.‚Äù The stuff that they first found and loved.\n\nI‚Äôm sure for many of you it might be Harry Potter, and that is just as good as the stuff I love. As long as something is a quality book, I personally don‚Äôt care if it was written yesterday or a hundred years ago. If it was published by the author him- or her-self or by a company. Quality is quality and it‚Äôs my hope that I someday might write a ‚Äúclassic.‚Äù By that, I mean something that is read by a lot of people who draw inspiration from it. If you don‚Äôt try you will never succeed that‚Äôs for sure üòä\n\nWhat books are on my reading list?\n\nI have a ton of unread books (mostly fantasy and sci-fi.)\n\nAnd I plan to buy all the six winners of the SPFBO competitions and read those (for inspiration purposes.)\n\nMy novel, Doomsayer Prince, is currently a part of SPFBO#7, and once you join, you figure out how excruciatingly tough a competition this is!\n\n300 fantasy books compete throughout a whole year. Being pitted against each other by some serious judges with a lot of knowledge. These people read so much it‚Äôs breathtaking. (Note added later: not surprisingly my debut novel was not the one left standing as the winner. The judges write 299 cut-posts during the competition. Only one gets the reward. It was fun while it lasted though, the hope of getting a spot in the top. Also, fun to be a part of the competition and I did get some contacts, sold a bit, and chewed off a lot of nails while waiting for five months for them to give me any kind of verdict. About my debut novel, one of the judges wrote: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great concept! It was also nice to see the main culture of the world not based in the Dark Ages of Europe.‚Äù The judges didn‚Äôt like the prose or the pacing, though, and so they let it go. That was a punch to the gut after 2¬Ω years of work, but at least they did not say it was crap, and I have a bunch of reviews giving it a five-star rating, so perhaps if I had gotten some other judges I would have made it further. Who knows. You can‚Äôt let these things get you down. You just have to continue writing :-))\n\nBeen there, done that üòä\n\nOK, so which fantasy books do I read?\n\nWell, Earlier this year, I finished A Brightness Long Ago by Guy Gavriel Kay. I liked the characters, and the fantasy novel had a ‚Äúsweet sadness‚Äù about it. It was not a page-turner for me, however. Maybe it was just me, but I put it down a few times. Still, I liked the ending, and it was worth the time I put into it.\n\n‚ÄúSo which books couldn't I finish?\n\nI also read Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert (the bestselling author of Eat Pray Love) and much enjoyed this self-help book for writers (and anyone desiring to live a life of creativity.) It‚Äôs easy to read, the text and the arguments flow through you, and it‚Äôs an insightful read. I especially liked the first half of the book. always good fun to read about someone who has the same experiences regarding being creative as oneself (what she writes about the physical bodily sensations and the deep feelings (spiritual if you like) accompanying the idea creation process and the experience of writing, and I can totally understand why she is concluding being inspired by a genius (the Roman version not the renaissance one) or by Uriel, a spirit, muse, angel or whatever we name this inspiration. I do the same thing, in my own way üòä\n\nThe books I don‚Äôt read\n\nI do have some ‚Äúbad habits.‚Äù I often read parts of a book and then stop. Sorry, if that offends you, but sometimes I do go back and finish these books later, then again not always. If I‚Äôm not entertained, then the book has not lived up to the ‚Äúcontract I thought we had‚Äù which for me is ‚Äúyou are supposed to entertain me or teach me something valuable.‚Äù\n\nI always read a few chapters, as most books are hard to get into before you have done that. You must give yourself time to get into the ‚Äúmindset‚Äù of that particular writer and get used to the way she or he writes before you can hope to enjoy yourself. I guess that is one of the reasons we tend to read stuff by the same authors over and over. We understand how they write/portray the world, and we believe they will entertain or educate us.\n\nSo which books couldn't I finish?\n\nI recently began reading The Blood Mirror by Brent Weeks. I loved the beginning of the series but heard the last book, The Burning White, was a disappointment, and as I did not love the beginning of The Blood Mirror, for now, I put it in the drawer.\n\nI also began reading Cibola Burn by James S.A. Corey and put it on hold. I do love the Expanse series. (I previously reviewed Leviathan Burns by James S.A. Corey. It-s one of the prior novels in the series.)\n\nMy TBR list\n\nSo many books I want to read. On Audible I have begun listening to Red Sister by Mark Lawrence's, Book of the Ancestor trilogy. So far, it‚Äôs great. I took Brandon Sanderson‚Äôs amazing YouTube writing course. That man is so smart, and I decided to read (on my Kindle) The Final Empire.\n\nI‚Äôll get to those once I get through some of the books on my shelves, like the sci-fi novels I borrowed: Jack Campbell's Genesis Fleet: Triumphant (I‚Äôve read almost all books written by Jack Campbell and I previously reviewed Daughter of Dragons and I reviewed Blood of Dragons and Destiny of Dragons), Craig Alanson's SpecOps, and Columbus Day, and Ian Douglas, Star Corpsman, Bloodstar. Plus, three hardcovers by Anna Smith Spark, The Court of Broken Knives, The Tower of Living and Dying, and The House of Sacrifice, and Nevernight by Jay Kristoff, and Gary The Gecko‚Äôs Guide to Getting Your Humans to Get Together by Christina ‚ÄúDZA‚Äù Marie. The title alone should make anyone want to read it :-)\n\nLinks\n\nOnce in a while, I review books\n\nHere are Rune S. Nielsen‚Äôs list of top 20 fantasy authors (I admit that a lot of them are ones from back when I discovered the genre. It‚Äôs pure nostalgia)\n\nI understand if you dislike this one, but I actually liked it. Let me tell you why you might dislike it and why I did not:\n\nI got this super cheap on sale in a nice hardcover first edition and could not resist purchasing it. I guess the reason it was cheap was that it is a lot less popular than the previous novels about Harry Potter though.\n\nWhy I liked it\n\nWith all the reservations about this not being a novel (see later) and that if you are really into Harry Potter you will likely be disappointed (see later), I actually loved reading it.\n\nWhy?\n\nI guess I just missed Harry and \"his universe\" more than I thought, so for me the play was both magic and fun.\n\nThe second reason: I got it at a bargain. Nothing wrong with that!\n\nWhy people disliked it - and why I understand\n\nOn SoMe many people dislike this novel, one of the reasons being that it is in fact not a novel at all but a play. The text contains only short intros to each scene and then the actor‚Äôs lines. For this reason, reading the first few pages is not enjoyable, but then I got used to it, and it was fine for me.\n\nSome fans of Harry Potter dislikes this play, and I actually agree with lots of the points they raise, there are things in the plot that does not make sense, and Harry Potter only has a few lines in the play, so it‚Äôs a stretch to put \"Harry Potter\" in the title, and I understand why some people would say that this all about \"making money,\" then again I don't really have a problem with making money, as long as I enjoy the outcome, so...\n\nIt's just a story folks\n\nAn example of one of the things in the play that makes less sense than it should, is how the grownup versions of Ron, Hermione and Harry is acting. Grownup Ron acts more childish than he did as a teenager, Hermione has a fancy position at the ministry but seems to have gotten more stupid over the years too, and I can understand why Harry might not be the best parent after the upbringing he had to endure, but I doubt he would be quite this shitty.\n\nThen again, all three characters are not very important in the play, it‚Äôs all about the next generation and time travel.\n\nThen why are you writing this Rune - you only write about stuff you like!\n\nWell, if you look at it from a writers view, I think that some fans can get stuck on \"if a character acted one way in the books I love, or the world worked a certain way (in the fan‚Äôs subjective optics), then everything damn well stay the same in the next book!!!!‚Äù\n\nIn reality however, sometimes people do change. They get hurt, or sick, or older, or disillusioned, or simply act strangely once in a while (from an outside perspective). Things and people change, even if that change might be scary.\n\nFor all I know Ron is trying to embrace his inner child, so he is acting like one, Hermione might be so stressed at work, that she is missing obvious things and Harry could suffer from PTSD, and that is why he is feeling like crap and end up treating his son badly.\n\nWhether the changes are actually caused by the play being mostly written by John Tiffany and Jack Thorne (and not J.K.Rowling), I have no way of knowing, but it could also be that the grown-up‚Äôs lines is not what they actually say, but what the children think they mean?\n\nThen again I'm just trying to make sense of it, and to be honest I don't lose any sleep over it. Don't get me wrong, I like Harry plenty, but as I read hundreds of fantasy books before I ever heard of him, I have never been \"fanatic\" about the series, and I thought the spin offs with the fantastic creatures were kind of boring, sorry to say. I like this play better.\n\n/Rune S. Nielsen\n\nDaughter of Dragons, Jack Campbell\n\nThe Genesis Fleet, Vanguard, Jack Campbell\n\nI read two books by Jack Campbell, or John G. Hemry, as that is his real name, though he is more known under the pseudonym Jack Campbell.\n\nMr. Hemry is mostly known as a Science Fiction writer but also writes Fantasy - or more accurately Science Fantasy.\n\nI first discovered his books some years back when my brother lend me the first in his \"The Lost Fleet\" series. Like my brother (who is a big fan of Military Science Fiction) I was instantly hooked.\n\nSince then I have read nearly all of his many books as Mr. Hemry writes extremely well. His plots are always fun and full of selfless and heroic characters. To me his books are like candy, you finish them quickly, and then either pick another one up or get annoyed if the next in the series is not yet out!\n\nThough I can‚Äôt fault a man that writes so much faster than I do.\n\nI first read the \"Daughter of Dragons\" and then \"The Genesis Fleet, Vanguard\". Both are good, and both are the first in two new series from 2017/18.\n\nIf you have not read anything by Campbell yet, I instead recommend you start where I did with \"The Lost fleet: Dauntless\". A great SciFi book that‚Äôs definitely worth a read. If you are more into Fantasy, then instead start with \"The Dragons of Dorcastle\" this first in his Pillars of Reality series. I love his two main characters in those books, and I'm sure you will too.\n\nWhich books to read\n\nThough I had decided not to read Fantasy I snug in the \"Daughter of Dragons\", telling myself that its Science Fantasy and therefore ok for me to read. Truth be told, I discovered that nearly all the plot takes place in a Fantasy setting, so at least for me this is a good book.\n\nIf you are 100% strictly into Fantasy then go read something else, there are so many fantastic writers and books out there, stuff that a lot of people have never even heard off (Game of Thrones are not all there is).\n\nTry reading \"The Black Prism\" by Brent Weeks, \"Black Sun Rising\" by C.S. Friedman, \"The Misenchanted Sword\" by Lawrence Watt-Evans or \"The Mirror of her dreams\" by Stephen Donaldson.\n\nThese days fantasy books are often more gritty and hard, than when I grew up. Authors kill some of their main characters, heck the kill all their main characters if they like, and village boys seldom become heroes or kings any more. They get caught up in intrigue, assassinations and abuse of power.\n\nFor my own part I like both the \"old style\" Fantasy with pious heroes and \"where good always win\", at least eventually, and the more realistic modern styles where the \"bad guys\" are often the winners and the \"god guys\" turn out to be just as flawed or \"bad\" as their adversaries.\n\nI mean, you don't eat the same meal every day either, right? At least I don't. Sometimes I like a good old-fashioned steak or dish I grew up with, other times I need to taste something new, preferably something I have never even heard of. What I mean is, don‚Äôt close yourself up to one \"right way\" a fantasy book must be. If a book is fun to read for you, that should be good enough, whether your friends, your peers or reviewers think differently. You are the reader, and you have the power, by supporting those books and writers you like.\n\nIf you want to read something truly beautiful but completely different than most other Fantasy (but still very much Fantasy) I can recommend \"The Slow regard of Silent things\" by Patrick Rothfuss. To this day one of the most beautiful Fantasy works, I have read.\n\n/Rune S. Nielsen\n\nMy friend really loves these books because they are stories of epic proportions (and we are all about epic, let me tell ya', hallelujah!).\n\nI have always had the greatest respect for King's writing skills and his portraits of both characters and society. Like all King's books he excels at peeling off one layer at a time of his main characters. You feel you slowly get inside their head and learn what makes them tick.\n\nI sometimes like the mix of different genres, like pulp or Science Fantasy, so I will likely end up buying the rest of the series, and my friend tells me they are good.\n\nMissing link\n\nI know he became a better writer later in his career, but this early book has a raw charm which must have been groundbreaking when it came out. I have come to think of \"The Gunslinger\" as \"a missing link\" of sorts.\n\nWhat was most fun for me in this first book, was thinking about all the things that unknown to me has been inspired by this series (or at least could have been, what do I know).\n\nWhat came first to mind was the post-nuclear-war universe of Bethesda Softworks Fallout games, with their irradiated \"what-if\" or \"parallel-world\" set in something like the fifties USA but with flying cars and robots. It‚Äôs a place filled with mutants, robots, horrific monsters, wonder, tough heroes and heroines, and the games are all about a journey of discovery and survival through the remnants of a broken country seemingly familiar yet alien and scary at the same time.\n\nI can't say for certain off course, that Fallout were inspired by King, and I admit I have not researched this at all, the idea just came to me while reading, but my guess is that the Fallout would have been a lot different, or not at all, without King's The Dark Tower.\n\nI do not mean this as a criticism though! I love Fallout, and I don't mind if people gets inspired by others if they make what they create their own.\n\nFew of us would be writing Fantasy if it was not for Tolkien and the other early Fantasy writes, who again would not be there without King Arthur and ancient mythology, I'm quite sure of that. Harry Potter is quite unique, then again t was inspired by other things. All stories are inspired by something else. The important thing is to find your own style and take on the genre and write some new compelling stories.\n\nMy friend who gifted me The Dark Tower is thinking about writing a book of his own - and I hope he does, as he has so many GREAT stories within him. He has co-written a musical once, so why stop there? He and I have always shared a passion for stories especially anything we consider Epic in nature.\n\nLike me, he used to be Dungeon Master, back in the day, and our shared background is coming up with stories for small groups of players to enjoy in a armchair Roleplaying game setting.\n\nI must admit that much of what I know about writing Fantasy is from writing adventures (or scenarios if you like) for armchair Roleplaying Games, not so much the \"physical, run around in the forest\" type - though I did that also on occasion - but mostly the \"sit with some friends in the living room and talk\" kind of games. Though I gave this hobby up ears ago, it is still a big influence on my thinking and writing plots.\n\nWhen I was in high school I wrote games reviews for national magazines, and so I played all sorts of armchair Roleplaying and Computer games for review purposes besides the ones I \"only did for fun\" (meaning it was also fun doing the reviews). I was a GM and/or player in countless campaigns and played every week for close to 15 years.\n\nWith my friends I explored the amazing worlds of Fighting fantasy, Warhammer, D&D, AD&D, Shadowrun, Mega Traveler, Palladium, Cthulhu, Vampire, Endless Pain and about thirty other games I would play anything from Marvel Superheroes to homeless losers, from humans to aliens, from men to women, from children to old people or from monsters to saviors.\n\n/Rune S.
