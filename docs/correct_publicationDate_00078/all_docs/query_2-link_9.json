        "text": "So is the song Lord of Light at all based on or inspired by the novel of the same name by Roger Zelazny? Because the lyrics could work that way. I like to think it is based on the novel, it makes the song so much better and powerful in my mind ;p\n\nI know Maiden has a lot of songs based on works of literature, and historical events. Sometimes i think these things are a positive, but sometimes TBH it feels uninspired. Like writing a song based on Falling Down, it was a great movie, but an Iron Maiden song?....\n\nAnd i know BNW was not based on the book. But the book was awesome so it would be a plus in my eyes if i were to find it was.\n\n(i know Falling Down is a movie, but i swear i read somewhere that Steve Harris read the novel and based it off that, not the movie. But i just looked it up and there is no book...)\n\nI'm not sure it's all that possible. We can't travel back to 1975 and look if Steve was actually reading Gaston Leroux' Phantom of the Opera, or if he watched a film based on it. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner by Allan Sillitoe is canon reading in English schools, but was H thinking of the book or the film when he wrote the song? Unless you find an authoritative statement from the writers themselves, I don't think we can make a proper list.\n\nMaturin's book list is a special case anyway. Books like Childhood's End or The Number of the Beast were never adapted. The songs are about completely different things, they only have the titles in common.\n\nThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner by Allan Sillitoe is canon reading in English schools, but was H thinking of the book or the film when he wrote the song?\n\nThat'd be Harris.\n\nBut yes, I see the problem here. I could do some searching attempts. But then we'd first need a list of books (before we know if they were direct sources or not).\n\nMaybe too much work.\n\nEDIT:\n\n@Perun Ha!\n\nhttp://ironmaiden-bg.com/en/interviews-from-1986-1987/interview-with-steve-harris-november-1986.php\n\nNow, let's go through the different tracks of the album.\n\nAs I said, I wrote 4 songs: 'Caugh Somewhere In Time', 'Heaven Can Wait', 'The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner', and 'Alexander The Great'. As usual, it was impossible for me to write cheesy love songs like, \"I love you, you love me, what a wonderful life\". Anyway, I've never been interested in this kind of things. 'The Loneliness...' was inspired by an old British film with the same title. The theme is ead simple: in life, you have to run, move forward, even if it means that you have to run alone. Just move on without a care about what people might say about you. 'Heaven Can Wait', the single, that's the story of someone who's struggling not to go to Heaven quite yet. Eddie himself dictated it to me one night during the last tour. 'Caugh Somewhere In Time' relates a nightmare trip through time due to the misfunction – or misuse! – of a time machine. My most ambitious composition is certainly 'Alexander The Great', a story based on true facts. When we started working on the LP, I was immersed in the story of Alexander The Great, a man who had a fantastic and incredible life. I fell in love with him and, quite naturally, I wrote the song and the lyrics, all this within two weeks. I must say that I'm very proud of this track.\n\nAnother one, @Perun\n\nhttp://ironmaiden-bg.com/en/interviews-from-1981/intерviu-със-steve-harris-may-1981.php\n\nWhy \"Iron Maiden\"?...\n\nI had the idea when I saw a film in which there was a torture instrument called an iron maiden, some kind of coffin with sharp spikes on the inside, that closes on its victim. I thought it fitted well to the music I was writing (Note: Steve Harris write almost all the songs of the band) and, as I love horror films, this is mainly where I get my inspiration from. This is how I wrote 'Murders In The Rue Morgue' or 'Phantom Of The Opera'. We play an aggressive music and I chose this theme, the horror depicted at the cinema or in comics, like others choose hell, for instance. And I think that this is why the kids have a great time with us.\n\nBut yes, I see the problem here. I could do some searching attempts. But then we'd first need a list of books (before we know if they were direct sources or not).\n\nWell I can make you a list of Maiden songs that share titles with books and narratives:\n\nGaston Leroux - Phantom of the Opera\n\nEdgar Allan Poe - Murders in the Rue Morgue\n\nRobert Heinlein - 'The Number of the Beast'\n\nRevelations\n\nJ.-H. Rosny - Quest for Fire\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge - The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\n\nAllan Sillitoe - The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\n\nRobert Heinlein - Stranger in a Strange Land\n\nAleister Crowley - Moonchild\n\nOrson Scott Card - The Seventh Son\n\nArthur C. Clarke - Childhood's End\n\nWilliam Golding - Lord of the Flies\n\nPhillip Wylie/Edwin Balmer - When Worlds Collide\n\nAldous Huxley - Brave New World\n\nC.S. Lewis - Out of the Silent Planet\n\nRoger Zelazny - Lord of Light\n\nRudyard Kipling - The Man Who Would Be King\n\nRaymond Briggs - When the Wind Blows\n\nThen some with obvious and stated inspiration and other tidbits:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare - Julius Caesar (The Ides of March, The Evil That Men Do)\n\nGospel of Luke (Prodigal Son)\n\nThe Lord's Prayer (Hallowed Be Thy Name)\n\nFable of Icarus (as told by Pseudo-Apollodorus) (Flight of Icarus)\n\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson - The Charge of the Light Brigade (The Trooper)\n\nFrank Herbert - Dune (To Tame a Land)\n\nUmberto Eco - The Name of the Rose (Sign of the Cross)\n\nJoseph Conrad - Heart of Darkness (The Edge of Darkness)\n\nMaybe too much work.\n\nSomebody else already did this."
