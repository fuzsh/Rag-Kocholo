        "text": "The story is so good…\n\nThe story is so good that I will give it five stars in spite of the poor choice of narrator. This is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors, it would have been better served by a narrator with an English accent… or no accent at all. Southern drawl just doesn’t suit a story based on Indian mythology.\n\nHow do you break a fan?\n\nBy giving them something that they’ve waited for many, many years but deliver it broken. This has been my favorite novel by my favorite author since I first read it in 1970. I’ve probably read this book at least annually since then.\n\nThe choice of narrator is so wrong - Matt Godfrey, Matt freakin Godfrey?!? Jesus, this a lyrical story about assumption by man of the attributes of the Hindu pantheon and the opposition by one using the teachings of the Buddha. Matt’s narration is what might generously be described as a mid-western twang and is ill suited for a novel of this depth. I forgave his sins with Creatures of Light and Darkness so pleased was I that this lesser novel appeared in Audible. But not this, never this.\n\nI’ll have to live with this but man what a disappointment.\n\nOutstanding!!!!!!!!\n\nThis book is part of my all time favorites\n\nbooks to read. I will read this book over and over again. Roger Zelazny is a masterful writer. Great story combining myth and science. All of it flavored with the human condition. Love this book.\n\nHis followers called Him Mahasamatman\n\nAnd said He was a god. He dropped the Maha- and the -atman and called himself Sam.\n\nThis is one of my favorite sci-fi books and my favorite Zelazny standalone novel. Zelazny’s story moves swiftly and confidently. There’s many memorable scenes, from Sam’s return from his magnetic field exile to the destruction of Hellwell to the battles with the gods. Zelazny’s prose is dramatic and poetic. I particularly like the battle of Keenset and, earlier (or later, the story doesn’t begin at the beginning) Rild’s combat with Lord Yama. It’s a great read.\n\nMy only misgiving is the narrator. He sounds sort of like an American cowboy. He would be perfect for American western gunslinger novels or civil war tales. But Lord of Light is a lyrical and imaginative work set in the distant future on a colony planet where the settlers are, or were, mainly Hindus. Sam is a philosophical world-weary man with an epic mission. He's not an unemotional American private detective solving a case.\n\nAnyhow: great book, miscast narrator. I'll probably eventually listen to the book again - but I'm certain I\"ll read the Kindle text version first. All those memorable scenes, like the aftermath of Agni's first encounter with Taraka, are better read than listening to cowboy Sam.\n\nA True Classic\n\nLoved this when I first read it as a kid and loved it just as much now that I’ve finally had a chance to hear it on Audible. A fantastic story read by an excellent narrator that should be made into either a movie or series straight away. If some great producer has not already purchased the rights to this story they ought to do it immediately!!! As Banyon said on Seinfeld - “It’s GOLD Jerry!!”"
