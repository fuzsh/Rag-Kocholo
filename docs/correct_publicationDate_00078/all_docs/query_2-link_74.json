        "text": "First answer is correct, definitely Darkover series by Marion Zimmer Bradley. First book is \"Darkover Landfall\" Spaceship crash lands on a distant planet after going off course. Local plant pollen and spores have drug like effects and bring out latent psychic powers in certain families who become royalty over generations. The series covers the culture that evolves and the effect when human contact is reestablished centuries later. I remember reading the entire series in the late 70's/early 80's\n\nhttp://darkover.wikia.com/wiki/Darkover_Landfall\n\nIt's possible you're thinking of the Coldfire Trilogy by C. S. Friedman. It's set on a fantasy world with magic where it turns out that current civilization is the result of a failed future society. Things that don't match include that the order is different — it starts in the magic society and we later learn about the futuristic underpinnings — and that the ship didn't crash, but rather, the colonization attempt failed due to the technology failing. I don't remember anything specific about the plants, but the first book involved an evil forest and the latter books were set in other strange environs.\n\nIt could be L.E. Modessit Jr's. Recluce Saga. In Fall of Angels, a modern spacefaring (and -fighting) ship with a small crew is forced into an alternate universe where much technology fails and magic works. Crew members find themselves with new abilities such as \"Order Magic\", healing, night vision, and prophetic visions. They struggle to found a working society that will last despite being mostly women surrounded by excessively chauvinistic nations.\n\nThe other books in the series mostly deal with their descendants in a world where magic works, and technology is largely limited by choice as it strengthens \"Chaos Magic\". The overall theme of the series is the eternal struggle between Order and Chaos, each of which can be manipulated by adepts as Magic.\n\nIt could also, at a stretch, be the Well World series by Jack Chalker, which starts with \"Midnight at the Well of Souls\". In that first book, a spacecraft gets caught up in a gateway to the Well World, and the people on board are sent to a variety of regions and are transformed to different species based on where they go. Following books in the series cover various power struggles both in the outer universe and on the Well World, where some of the geographic regions are coded to stop any technology working but in exchange have a form of magic."
