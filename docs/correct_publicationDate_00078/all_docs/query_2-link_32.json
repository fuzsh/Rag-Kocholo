        "text": "McCaffrey's Pern books aren't fantasy. They just look like fantasy. Ditto Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover, and Frank Herbert's Dune. If you put fantasy into a science fiction story, it's not science fiction but instead fantasy, because science fiction requires everything to be naturally based and nothing to be supernatural. If you insert the actual fantastic supernatural, then you negate the central idea of the genre. (We've had a number of threads on this, here and elsewhere in the forums, so you can look them up.)\n\nBut there are certainly many forms of speculative science theory that can give you SF stories that look very close to fantasy, and this was particularly popular in the 1970's to early 1990's. Quantum and chaos theories have particularly been used in this area, including with quantum based multiple universes, as has the idea of a post-apocalyptic society where technology has gone bye-bye. Steampunk SF often seems more fantastic since it isn't usually set in a future but in an alternate history. Various types of aliens, having natural creatures that are like fantastic magical creatures (the dragons in Pern, vampires who are actually species of aliens, etc.) and so forth, create worlds that are fantastic-like but naturally based. (Colony science fiction was mainly based on this idea.) Zombies, originally a fantasy concept, became a SF variant with Frankenstein and ever since then, while there are fantasy zombie stories (such as recent Warm Bodies,) many of the zombie ones have been SF, with the zombies attributed to a natural cause -- a virus, radiation poisoning, scientific experiments, etc. Psionic abilities, time travel and superpowers -- there are all sorts of things that can be given a natural basis (genetic experimentation, time machine, etc.) instead of a supernatural one (magic crystals, etc.)\n\nFantasy does not at all require everything in the stories to be supernaturally based; it only needs supernatural elements to be included. So you can load a fantasy story with as many science fiction elements as you like. There is an entire sub-category -- futuristic fantasy -- given over to this idea.\n\nRobert Silverberg's Lord Valentine's Castle actually is fantasy but it's futuristic fantasy, and Andre Norton used similar tactics in Witch World, as well as having a multiverse. Steampunk fantasy uses science fiction elements of alternate history often, for instance. Futuristic and post-apocalypse fantasy novels make use of all sorts of science fiction elements, like Emma Bull's Bone Dance. Contemporary fantasy novels frequently use science fiction elements, and in the 1980's it was quite popular to mix elves with computers and science inventions. Multiverse fantasy novels like Dark Tower and Princes of Amber usually involve some science fiction universes in their setting. Piers Anthony, for instance, had a very successful series with the Phaze series, which was a portal/multiverse fantasy series in which two identical worlds -- one in which magic and magical creatures existed and one in which it was a futuristic SF place with robots and such -- were linked unknowingly, and a guy from the SF world crosses over into the fantasy one.\n\nTerry Brooks' bestselling Shannara series is a futuristic post-apocalyptic fantasy series. It's set on Earth many centuries into the future after a nuclear holocaust. After the holocaust, the elves emerged from hiding and they have magic. Various human populations mutated from radiation and where they took shelter, creating new \"races\" of gnomes and dwarves who are actually still human -- science fiction. Some humans can use magic. It allowed Brooks to play with SF details while having an epic fantasy playground. Jack Vance's famous Dying Earth series and Stephen R. Boyett's well known Ariel and sequel Elegy Beach both have a post-apocalyptic future in which science is gone or negated and sorcery or magic works instead. Iain Tregillis' alternate history WWII series uses both cross-dimensional magic and scientific experimentation to provide superpowers.\n\nSo yes, it's a long tradition to cross them to produce various forms of fantasy, or to simulate a fantasy-like situation but give it a natural basis to keep it science fiction. As for other types of fiction, they are all in SF and always have been. Almost every SF story is a thriller story and some are mystery thrillers. Horror can be neither SF or fantasy, but usually is one or the other. There are plenty of romantic sub-plots in SF and there is a whole sub-category of romance fiction, SF romance. There are even western style SF stories.\n\nAnd there are western fantasy stories certainly. Emma Bull's Territory. Lucas Thorn's Nysta series isn't technically a western (not being in the Earth's Old West,) but is made to be western-like in elements and dialogue. There are lots of western historical fantasies and alternate history fantasy novels. The 1800's remains the most popular historical setting. Elizabeth Bear's new Karen Memory series, Stephen King's Dark Tower series again, Gemma Files' Hexslinger series, Lon Williams' Lee Winter series, Cathrynne Valente's Six-Gun Snow White, Felix Gilman's very well known The Half-Made World, etc.\n\nMcCaffrey's Pern books aren't fantasy.

Got any pictures of your library?\n\nSpace fantasy is a pretty thriving sub-genre - any of the Star Wars universe is technically space fantasy - the force is mystical, and the quest is central to the story. So, too, Guardians of the Galaxy. I know these are films (but you've a lot of books mentioned above) but it gives a sense of how wide space fantasy is without, maybe, viewers realising it.\n\nWhen I was first working on Abendau (which is space fantasy-esque) I worried, like you are, that it mightn't work, but it hasn't been a barrier in the end. One thing I do think is important is to think what feel you want to be dominant. In my case, I wanted to have a space opera feel (it sits on the cusp of both SO and space fantasy) so I used a classic SO world. The elements of fantasy, then, are story elements rather than setting elements - the chosen one, the quest, psi powers.\n\nOn the other hand, I know someone writing a very cool fantasy with sci fi elements and their setting is firmly fantasy with story elements of sci fi.\n\nSo, I think what I'm saying is it's okay to blend them but you need a good idea what world it is you want to inhabit because once you bleed genres into each other it can blur that world a little? Or, it would have done for me. So, perhaps, a bit of worldbuilding at the start, just figuring out what elements you want where...?\n\nGenres aren't restrictive. They're simply descriptors. The purpose of genres (the second meaning -- a general category in bookselling of fiction that includes common elements,) is to let readers find very general types of stories they like faster.\n\nIn comic/satirical fiction, you can have pretty much anything. It's simply a description of fiction that contains comic/satirical elements or tone. It might be farcical, it might be dark humor, or both. It can be about anything from unicorns to senior citizen homes. There are no restrictions. It simply means that the author decided to put comic/satirical elements in, making it a focus of the story.\n\nIf an author decides to put superheroes in it and that's the main focus, it's a superhero novel. That's a description. It lets readers know the story is about superheroes. A mystery is a story with a mystery in it, but it can be anything from a farcical mystery to a horror filled mystery thriller about serial killers. Calling it a mystery just lets readers know it's a story about a mystery. There are no restrictions, only descriptions.\n\nSFF likes to invent names for sub-categories. Fans do it, authors do it, sometimes publishers or booksellers do it. Some of them stick, some of them don't. Some of them are used for awhile, fall out of fashion and then come back again, like urban fantasy. Occasionally the term is meant to describe a group of authors doing similar things around the same time -- a literary movement (the first meaning of the word genre) -- and then also becomes the second sort of genre -- a sub-category.\n\nTechno thrillers used to be called war novels. It means a thriller that involves advanced technology, usually military but not always, usually somewhat SF in element but not always. Techno -- technology. Thriller -- thriller. Cyberpunk was both a literary movement (genre,) and a sub-category sub-genre (bookselling.) It means that the story involves cyber tech (cyber) and dystopias and rebellion (punk.) It's a description. A paranormal romance is a romance story (romance) that has fantastic elements (paranormal.) And so on and so on. They're just trying to describe what it is you authors are choosing to do in your stories, not fence you in."
