        "text": "There are two main hypotheses for this thesis. The primary hypothesis is that Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff, Philip José Farmer and Philip K. Dick, in The Meri (Fantasy), Night of Light (SF), and VALIS (SF), respectively, require their protagonists to think mythologically to overcome the limits of their material universes. The secondary hypothesis is that, just as the aforementioned protagonists think mythologically to overcome the limits of their material universes, so is the reader forced to engage in mythological cognition to think beyond the limits of materialism. I give evidence for these hypotheses by showing that the protagonists think mythologically using mythological archetypes to challenge their perceptions regarding the ontological status of matter in their respective worlds. This leads to their deepening discovery that their material worlds are emanations of higher realms of spirit. Due to the fact mythological archetypes become representatives of spirit in these texts, mythological cognition is shown to be constructivist in character, because the authors’ blending of the concepts of ‘spirit’ with ‘matter’, causes mythological archetypes to challenge their protagonists’ perceptions. I therefore explain how this blending takes place using the theory of conceptual blending. Conceptual blending illustrates that it is the authors’ use of metaphor that blends matter and spirit. Using Jean Piaget’s constructivist philosophy, I highlight how this blending allows the protagonists to either assimilate new knowledge into their existing view of the world, or to accommodate new knowledge by updating their view to a new paradigm. Likewise, I argue that the reader is engaged in mythological cognition by being required to go through similar cognitive processes to the protagonists, to properly understand the texts. The reader is encouraged to think beyond the boundaries of materialism, so that the idealisms informing the creation of the primary texts can be properly understood in their real-world philosophical roles.\n\nMyths are folklores, which introduce the ancient people's culture, lifestyle, and rituals along with their strong belief in particular deities. Every civilization has its mythology. India has a treasure of four Vedas, the Upanishads, the two epics, the eighteen main Puranas, plays, poetry, sculptures, dance, music, and folklore in our mythology. The paper focuses on the use of modern technology by Tripathi in The Shiva Trilogy. This research paper focuses on how Amish Tripathi elaborates \"Lord Shiva\" known as \"Lord of the Lords\" worshipped by the Hindus has been narrated as a 'human being' in The Shiva Trilogy. One can find theories of post-modern and post-truth in this Trilogy. Amish Tripathi also narrates the philosophical values in Trilogy. The Paper also tries to elaborate on how Tripathi elaborates a science through the Vedic rituals. The Paper also focuses on the Meluha tribe, how they use medicines and science for long life, using somras proves this example. Shiva Trilogy focuses on Indian history and culture and Amish presents it in a modern way.\n\nEvery myth is made up of a limited series of constitutive elements, also known as invariants or mythemes. These elements do not necessarily coincide with the plotline of the original myth, but rather give shape to its mythic essence. These unvarying elements have a mythic core, that is, they follow the logic of myth: they hold, in some way, a transcendent dimension. No mytheme is exclusive to one single myth: different myths can share a mytheme. Both Pygmalion and Frankenstein combine the vivification and animation of an artifact, but they differ in attributing the authorship of these two mythemes. The specific presence, relationship, and distribution of the unvarying elements constitute a specific myth. The relative modification or inversion of mythemes does not necessarily imply the disappearance of the myth, only its distortion (the fallen angel in the New Age and in contemporary film productions) or its subversion (Pygmalion in Grau’s piece, the Trojan War in Giraudoux’s play, the Grail in Rabelais, Gracq, Pierre Benoit, or Spielberg’s film). Instead, the absolute modification or the suppression of one or more basic mythemes unfailingly causes a mythic crisis of importance: these changes make the myth difficult to recognize (Ariadne in Le Clézio’s novella), transform it (Frankenstein compared to Pygmalion in Shelley’s novel), or eliminate it completely (the Grail in Eliot’s poem).\n\nThe human mind, by its very nature, is a constantly curious, questioning thing – and as such, what is it that leads us to continuously ask ‘what if?’ Why has the concept of alternate realities remained so enduringly popular within the broader oeuvre of science fiction - that tantalising capability to delve into both past and future scenarios in an attempt to analyse the possibilities for something different, something profoundly ‘other’? In his essay on Ursula Le Guin’s The Lathe of Heaven, Ted Gioia argues that ‘the excitement of sci-fi is not derived from its science—which rarely stands up to scrutiny—but rather from its imaginative reconstructions of our perceived reality.’ This essay focuses on this notion of ‘reconstruction’ and the fabrication of the unfamiliar, fantastical and unsettling from the world we know. It is a tradition with roots stretching back through literature of the past two-hundred years to early Greek philosophical debate and classical poetry. As two of the most prolific authors of science-fiction, Ursula Le Guin and Philip K. Dick provide an ideal crux to an examination of alternate realities and how this narrative premise can be employed as a tool to investigate a multitude of themes prevalent to contemporary society. Published in 1962, Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle explores the concept of an alternate reality where Germany and Japan won the Second World War. With Europe completely dominated by Germany, America was forced to surrender to the Axis powers and was promptly colonised by Germany on the East Coast and by Japan on the Western Coast – the two powers separated by a neutral Rocky Mountain buffer zone. In an unstable Cold War environment unfolding between Japan and Germany, many of the remaining Americans eke out an existence selling antiques – both fake and real – to the Japanese, who have an obsession with objects of America’s past. Against this backdrop, a young woman called Julianna Frink seeks out the author of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy; a book that portrays a hopeful alternate world where Germany lost the war. Through this novel-within-a-novel technique, Dick explores the notions of alternate realities, the subjective nature of history and ideas of race within a conflicted society. As Eric Brown explains in his introduction to the novel, ‘[Dick] was obsessed with the idea that the universe was only apparently real, an illusion behind which the truth might dwell. Again and again in his work, we find that reality as perceived by both reader and protagonist is a hoax’. Ursula Le Guin engages with many similar themes within her novel The Lathe Of Heaven (1971). Dealing with protagonist George Orr, who suffers from dreams with the capability to change reality, the novel examines this mechanism and the problems created when it is abused by Orr’s doctor, William Haber. Utilising a brainwave machine that enhances Orr’s dreams, Haber attempts to change the world, with disastrous consequences – directing Orr to dream of an end to racism, everyone’s skin is turned grey. Ordered to dream of world peace, Orr creates an alien invasion, uniting the world’s nations to fight against them. With the world becoming increasingly unstable through repeat usage of the ‘dream-machine’, Orr is forced to fight for control against Haber and ultimately shut his operations down."
