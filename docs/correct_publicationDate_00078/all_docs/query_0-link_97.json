        "text": "His followers called him Mahasamatman and said he was a god. He preferred to drop the Maha- and the -atman, however, and called himself Sam. He never claimed to be a god. But then he never claimed not to be a god. Circumstances being what they were, neither admission could be any benefit. Silence, though, could.\n\nThe opening lines of the Hugo Award-winning Lord of Light are among the most famous in science fiction. And they are a nearly irresistible hook into Zelazny’s best novel. It’s a story that would be on most science fiction critics’ list of the best novels in the genre.\n\nAt one level, it’s a story of one man’s long struggle, across hundreds of years, in a seemingly unwinnable war against the gods themselves. Very real gods, the Hindu pantheon made real, through advanced technology. They have the power of reincarnation and enforce a vicious caste system. The gaze of the god of death, Yama, will indeed kill. The gods, the original crew of the starship Star of India, savagely repress any attempt at technology by the passenger colonists. Sam’s war, his rebellion, with its shifting alliances, betrayals, double-crosses and deep history is a wonderful story.\n\nBut there are three things that elevate the novel above mainstream science fiction. First, it has a non-linear narrative. The middle half of the book is Sam’s meditation on what has gone before, Sam’s efforts through guerilla warfare, a counter-religion, an unholy alliance with the indigenous natives, and finally open warfare, to defeat his former crew mates.\n\nSecond, Sam is himself no angel. He is a reluctant hero, deeply flawed and human, all too human. When he sets himself up as Buddha, he’s a fraud, using a religion that teaches believers not to fear death to defeat the coercion of Heaven. Opportunistic and in some ways a cad, he nonetheless dies, repeatedly, sometimes horribly, in his struggle to defeat those who would be gods.\n\nBut what most sets the novel apart is Zelazny’s wriritng. He achieves an epic narrative style, that fits the story perfectly. Consider the description of one of Sam’s resurrections:\n\nThereafter to be portrayed in murals at the ends of countless corridors, carved upon the walls of Temples and painted onto the ceilings of numerous palaces, came the awakening of he who was variously known as Mahasamatman, Kalkin, Manjusri, Siddhartha, Tathagatha, Binder, Maitreya, the Enlightened One, Buddha and Sam. At this left was the goddess of Night; to his right stood Death; Tak, the ape, was crouched at the foot of the bed, eternal comment upon coexistence of the animal and the divine.\n\nIn addition to vivid imagery, Zelazny weaves Hindu mythology, especially the Upanishads, a few light doses of Buddhism and a few bits of the Christian Bible into a seamless whole. It is beautifully done.\n\nAnd spare. In less than 250 pages, Zelazny tells his entire story. It’s a powerful rebuke to long-winded authors, an anti-Robert Jordan, as it were.\n\nWC can re-read Lord of Light time and again with pleasure and delight. WC believes you will like it, too. And gives it his very highest recommendation."
