        "text": "More stuff from the archive regarding Vernor Vinge though, in this case, he’s just a small part of a big anthology.\n\nRaw Feed (2002): Explorers: SF Adventures to Far Horizons, ed. Gardner Dozois, 2000.\n\n“Preface”, Gardner Dozois — Brief look at the theme of exploration stories in world literature and exploration stories in sf. Dozois notes that the theme wanes and blooms in interest amongst writers. Ironically, when real space exploration, at least of the manned variety, was winding down, space exploration stories in sf were picking up. They used the new scientific findings for romantic and adventure stories set in space like the old planetary romances used uncontradicted speculations.\n\n“The Sentinel”, Arthur C. Clarke — This is at least the second time I’ve read this story which I did not remembered being set in 1996.\n\n“Moonwalk”, H. B. Fyfe — A man against nature tale that reminded me strongly of Jack London, particularly his “Building a Fire”, and the true story of mountain man John Colter. This 1952 story has the sole survivor of a lunar tractor accident walking away from it, trying to find help from his fellow explorers far away before his oxygen gives out. (His wife is one of the members of the lunar base.) Fyfe even throws in some grandiose descriptions of the lunar landscape.\n\n“Grandpa”, James H. Schmitz — The only other time I’ve read this story is about 25 years ago, but I remembered most of it. It’s still a clever story of the unraveling-a-deadly-secret-of-an-alien-ecosystem variety. It does, however, make me want to read more of Schmitz. He strikes me as just as clever at working out alien ecosystems.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis book probably needs to be re-read by me to really appreciate it since I’ve seen a lot more of the relevant movies in the intervening years. Newman knows his movies. He shows up frequently on Blu-Ray commentaries.\n\nIn any event, this is what you get since I’m still working on new stuff, and this is in keeping with the recent spate of science fiction detective stories.\n\nRaw Feed (1992): The Night Mayor, Kim Newman, 1990.\n\nI picked up this book having never heard of it or its author and was very pleasantly surprised. I’m sure if I knew more about movies I’d have liked it even more. As it was, I didn’t get all the allusions to various actors and movies, but I got a lot of them.\n\nNewman, in his Richie Quick section, writes with the snappy funny dialogue of 40’s film noir. The conceit of the city has overtones of Roger Zelazny’s The Dream Master. The business of changing forms in a constantly escalating battle between Turo Daine and the Susan Bishipric is wonderful with its black and white world, theme music for characters, constant appearances by actors and actresses, fade ins, and underimagined venues (not to mention that its always 2:30 AM and raining.\n\nNewman (while making some telling but affectionately critical comments about film noir — particularly women in it) provides a sturdy enough (barely) plot. Daine’s imagined world is taking up more and more memory in the world computer (the few viewpoint sections of the computer are sardonic and well-done). However, it’s all a cover for Daine, a pop culture supercriminal (who has\n\n“8921 counts of first-degree murder alone, excluding his various thermonuclear adventures”\n\nto escape prison by “colonizing” life support belonging to Yggdrasil, the world computer.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOne of life’s little emergencies has cropped up, so, while I have two completed books to post about, no notes or reviews of them have been written. So, you get another . . .\n\nRaw Feed (1998): Distant Stars, Samuel R. Delany, 1981.\n\n“Of Doubts and Dreams: An Introduction” An interesting essay on the process of writing. First, it showed how much doubt and rewriting even a prolific writer like Delany can go through. Thinking about stories, conceiving stories, Delany says, is a process nearly everyone does. What separates the writer from everyone else is the doubts that creep in when you sit down to write the story out. Then doubt creeps in, clichés and clutter and thinness show through. A manuscript, says Delany, should be more than just documentation that verifies an act. It should be the summation of many doubts about the worthiness of the story acknowledged and answered. Writing is answering the doubts of your mind about your expression and then taking your answer and using it to answer other doubts.\n\nDelany mentions three rules of writing he follows which can be expressed in positive and negative terms. Envision as much of a scene as possible but only mention the aspects of it that “impinge on your character’s consciousness” while in it. That will not only describe but detail your characters’ emotional states. (Don’t overwrite.) When a story bogs down ask yourself what’s “really going in it”. You must look deeper into the characters motivations and psychology to interest yourself. (Don’t write thin or superficially.) While preparing a story, think about the traps and shortfalls other authors fell into when doing similar material and how to avoid them. (Avoid clichés.) Writing (and how true this is) an “endless process of doubts”, of things not done”. It’s heartening to know even a pro like Delany suffers the doubts of the process and uses them.\n\n“Prismatica” — A rather charming fantasy (due to its language and not its plot) written in the style, a beginning note says, of James Thurber. The plot features a “grim grey” man who cheats people and cons a man into helping him find a wife fit for a prince. Along the way, we meet a colorful (literally) prince who wants to marry a woman to be found behind the combined shards of a broken mirror. I liked that the strange creature in the grey man’s trunk simply turned out to be one of those entities that befriends difficult people like the grey man and tries to change them.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOver at The Books That Time Forgot, there has been discussion of Roger Zelazny.\n\nWhile I’m working on new posting, I thought I’d post this Raw Feed.\n\nRaw Feed (199): This Immortal, Roger Zelazny, 1965.\n\nI had forgotten how witty Zelazny could be in his prose and dialogue.\n\nConrad Nomikos, like the hero of Zelazny’s My Name Is Legion, is a man of a mysterious past fighting a covert struggle. Here, though, Conrad has wearied of his struggle to assert Earth’s independence from the Vegans and is unsure how to continue that struggle.\n\nLike most Zelazny novels, there are religious and literary references (many of which I don’t recognize) allusions. Here the mythical framework, also found in other Zelazny novels, is Greek in origin. Conrad and his dog Bothan are like some Greek demigod.\n\nI found the first third of this book rather slow, if witty, but things picked up as the grand tour of a near deserted Earth began. The novel moved quickly then.\n\nI loved particularly the mad anthropologist with his Frazer-inspired ability to lend class to a bunch of cannibals. Zelazny briefly, but poignantly, touched on the plight of the long-lived Conrad: his seeing friends and family — especially his son Jason — grow old and die.\n\nThe novel’s end, with Conrad inheriting the Earth, was interesting but I thought Cassandra’s survival a bit contrived.\n\nThis one was read last October. I always try to make time for some Poe in October. I’m not quite that far behind my reviews, but this one got overlooked, so it’s a bit of a backtrack.\n\nReview: The Black Throne, Roger Zelazny and Fred Saberhagen, 1990.\n\nThis novel is a farrago of the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe and involves multiple worlds.\n\nWe open with Annie on the shore of a fog shrouded sea. She meets two identical looking boys: Edgar Perry (Poe’s name when he was a sergeant in the US Army) and Edgar Allan (that would have been Poe’s name if he had been formerly adopted by his step family). They go out into the sea to look at a body. Edgar Allan is near it when he loses contact with this dream world but not before he hears the call of “E-tekeli-li” (from Poe’s The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym). Next, we see Edgar Perry near Fort Moultrie (where Poe served and site of his story “The Gold Bug”). Perry sees Annie riding by in a coach. He has long seen Annie in his dreams. Annie, from the coach, seems to telepathically ask for him to rescue her, that she is being taken away to be done harm, and she is possibly drugged. Annie is, of course, the woman from Poe’s “Annabel Lee”.\n\nAnd so, in the first chapter, we set the tone for what will be a story that works in many of the elements of Poe’s life and his works – some obscure, some obvious. (I’ll admit I recognized most of them, but, for a few, I had to resort to Dawn B. Sova’s Edgar Allan Poe A to Z to refresh my memory.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWell, I’ve reviewed other Zelazny titles, so I’ll take a look at this one. But I was not as fond of this book as many are. (I actually had to scrounge for my paperback copy a few years ago and paid a relatively high price for it.)\n\nLow Res Scan: A Night in the Lonesome October, Roger Zelazny, 1993.\n\nYes, we have a book nicely segmented into 31 chapters so you can read it, as so many people do, a chapter a day in October.\n\nYes, it’s narrated by a dog. Not just any dog — Jack the Ripper’s dog.\n\nYes, Frankenstein and his walking lab project and Dracula show up. Larry Talbot the Wolfman does too.\n\nThere’s a witch, a Russian monk, a bit of Yog-Sothethery. You can throw in Gypsies, grave robbers, and a vicar too.\n\nSherlock Holmes and Watson even show up though here only known as the Great Detective and his sidekick.\n\nMost of those characters, except Holmes and Watson, have animal familiars who often talk to each other — which I found the most amusing part of the book.\n\nAnd most of the characters are jostling for position (figuratively and literally) to make the best of the magical rite on October 31st — at least the Halloweens with a full moon. There are two camps — the openers and the closers. One camp wants to open a dimensional door so the Elder Gods can come through. The others want to keep it closed. Continue reading →\n\nThe review copy for this one was requested mostly because it had a William Meikle story, but I suppose I had a subconscious desire to return to a bit of Arthuriana after not reading any for more than 30 years apart from Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s Idylls of the King.\n\nI’ve watched the movie Excalibur countless times, but I’m not any kind of Arthurian buff. Not so coincidentally, I have been listening to Professor Dorsey Armstrong’s King Arthur: History and Legend lectures from The Teaching Company which actually was a bit helpful in understanding a couple of names I came across in this book. In my English major days, I did read a fair number of the medieval Arthur texts – but there’s a whole lot I didn’t read too.\n\nReview: By the Light of Camelot, eds. J. R. Campbell and Shannon Allen, 2018.\n\nThe stories here roughly divide into two categories. There are the stories where the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur’s reign and the Quest for the Holy Grail are honorable institutions and men engaged in worthwhile pursuits. And there’s the stories where they aren’t, literary acid corroding the legend of Camelot.\n\nGenerally, when it comes to Arthur stories, I want the former though I enjoyed the last bit of Arthuriana I read, Roger Zelazny’s “The Last Defender of Camelot” which portrays Merlin as a dangerous fanatic. (And, after hearing Prof. Armstrong’s summary of the alliterative Morte Arthure, which sounds like a real downer, I’m interested in that too.) [Actually, in thinking about it, the last bit of Arthuriana I read was Charles Harness’ Cybele, with Bluebonnets.]\n\nLet’s start with the fictional gripes about the Camelot’s legend.\n\nSimon Kurt Unsworth’s “The Terrible Knitter” is well-told, a grim tale of Dysig, a Round Table knight, still alive and in the wreckage of England after the Norman Conquest. Tracking down yet another rumor of the Grail, he comes to Dent, a village that’s a “thin” place between worlds, plagued by vampiric locals. Like a lot of these tales, the sting is in the end. Continue reading →\n\nThe Alexander Jablokov series continues.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): Carve the Sky, Alexander Jablokov, 1991.\n\nI was first puzzled by this book’s title. It turns out to be a metaphor and allusion to the central theme of the book: that all of us carve and create — if we are truly to be alive — the reality we want, be it an act of artistic creation or a political creation. We are all, the book seems to say, artists to one extent or another\n\nThis is a very literary — and good — sf novel where a theme is played out in a number of variations in plot and character\n\nThe central theme is expressed in the metaphor of the Dispossessed Brethren of Christ, one of the best and most interesting features of the book. They are warrior-monks reminiscent of the Knights Templar (right down to building a Jerusalem Lost) with a strong gnostic streak. To them the world is evil and God is imprisoned in it, awaiting the art of sculpting to free him from the world as Christ’s divinity was revealed on the cross when his divinity was revealed in death administered by the sculpting tools of hammer, nail, and lance.\n\nI don’t know how much of their fascinating theology is a Jablokov invention, but a look through the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry [yes, I do have a copy] showed that three of the four named elements in their spacedrive — Jochin, Boaz (which are the principle pillars in Solomon’s temple), and Aaron’s Rod — are associated with Royal Arch Masonry. Continue reading →\n\nAnd the PKD series continues with a look at the second volume of his collected short stories.\n\nRaw Feed (2000): The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, Volume 2: We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, 1987.\n\n“Introduction”, Norman Spinrad — A very useful introduction in which Spinrad points out how Dick’s short stories, right from the beginning (these stories are from 1952 through 1955), were different artistically and thematically from other sf writers. While author collections, as Spinrad rightly notes, often have a sameness of style, incident, theme, and character and Dick was no exception, his sameness was unique. Spinrad sees Dick’s overarching theme to be a concern with empathy, the quality that distinguishes man from the mechanical, sometimes thinking, “pseudo-life” (particularly weapon systems) that menace his heroes. And those heroes are usually ordinary people trying to survive worlds of time paradoxes and shifting realities or the menacing security state. Spinrad notes that Dick didn’t do “action-adventure formula” stories or space operas or mad scientists or “fully-developed alien civilizations” or stories with “real good guys versus bad guys”. Dick did not write stories in a consistent universe or future history or feature recurring characters. But the most interesting claim by Spinrad (and I tend to believe he’s studied the matter) is that he invented the multiple viewpoint technique in sf (a technique Spinrad is fond of, indeed he took it to its extreme in “The Big Flash”). Spinrad claims “few if any writers” used it before Dick and that all writers who used it afterwards owe a debt to Dick.\n\n“The Cookie Lady” — Fantasy tale of vampirism by the title character who lures a boy with cookies and steals his life. Continue reading →\n\nI’ve already reviewed later volumes in this series, so I thought I’d go back to look at the first two.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, Volume 1: The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford, 1987.\n\n“Preface” — This is an interesting piece by Dick on what he valued in sf. Dick makes the valid point that all fiction involves dislocation from the reader’s world but that sf involves a major conceptual dislocation. Dick eloquently speaks of the joy in reading sf coming from the “chain reaction of ideas” set off in the mind while reading good sf. What is good sf to Dick? New ideas or new variations of old ideas. He quite clearly says it isn’t just the future or advanced technology. I disagree with this view. To me Dick is guilty of committing a variant on the sin of many other sf critic/author: he insists that sf meet some functional definition (define man’s relation to technology, the effect of change, prepare man for change, the dreams of technological society) and not assign a descriptive definition like it being fantasy with a pseudo-scientific or technological or scientific or pseudo-technological rationale. [I think younger self missed the importance of “good” in Dick’s argument. He may have considered a lot of things sf — just bad sf.] Many sf critics and authors seem quite content to denounce large parts of the sf genre as unfit for the label. I can’t see the need for this.\n\n“Foreword“, Steven Owen Godersky — It occurs to me in reading the Philip K. Dick Society’s Newsletter (and biographies and interviews of Dick) that the quality and character of Dick scholars varies greatly: some examine his mystical visions and religious themes for signs of mental illness, philosophical speculation, or divine revelation; some proudly point to him as one of sf’s best, others — scornful of most sf — point to him as a wasted gem in the garbage of sf; some see him as liberal, others as paranoid. Godersky sees a major theme — which he obviously, in a liberal way, likes — of anti-military, anti-war. That may be true but I suspect this strain in Dick’s work has more to do with living in the tense 1950s and having a strong distrust in authority.) Dick may be one of those rare authors that many a critical theory and observation could apply to. Dick’s contradictory statements, the philosophical/religious speculations, his concern over the small, his characterization and empathy, his distrust of authority and descriptions of reality all mesh to create a multi-faceted and complex man and body of work that can be described in political terms (such as Cold War satires), religious terms (the gnosticism of later books), and philosophy (e.g. Paul Williams description of the I Ching‘s influence on Dick). In some sense, most of these views are right, provide insight, and can be supported (and almost all contradicted) by evidence. Godersky makes the valid observation that Dick’s fiction has cosmic struggles between good and evil, death and life, order and entropy, callousness versus empathy often taking place in out of the way corners in a muted, hidden way between rather small, ordinary figures. The everyday, the mundane in Dick can have cosmic significance. Continue reading →"
