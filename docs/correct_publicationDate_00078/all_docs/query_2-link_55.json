        "text": "[Normally a picture of the cover would go here but a) it’s ugly, b) I can’t find a good source.]\n\nAnyhow, Book 2 of the Cinder Spires (probably heptalogy and no, I didn’t google that word to find out if it was real or not) was released on November 7 of this year. The previous book, The Aeronaut’s Windlass, was released back in 2015, God in Heaven that was a long time ago, and is a generally exemplary adventure novel. In fact, it’s very comparable in overall enjoyment/quality to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie: something with lots of color, setting, motion and emotion, and a not inconsiderable dash of characterization and emotional resonance, and just plain charm. (Arrrr swash swash buckle buckle, etc.) Sidenote: PoTC is actually a damn good movie and the entire trilogy holds up surprisingly well.\n\nOh, and also there are talking cats.\n\nBook 2 is, quite simply, more of the same: it’s the work of an accomplished and expert author who has had twenty-plus years of experience to teach him how to make things work the way they ought to and that the audience will enjoy. There’s a bit more intrigue and skullduggery–but it’s swiftly faded into what we’re really interested in, after all, which is sword duels at sunrise! On a platform suspended off the side of a two-mile-high tower! Talking cats (being dismissive but also affectionately protective of their humans.) There’s a lot more creepy, we-got-dragged-into-a-zombie-movie-without-realizing-it-aaaaaaauuuughhhh, slow-burning horror. There’s quite a bit of romance (and a touch of spice of the diplomatically-fade-to-black type), and only some of it ends in tragedy. There’s some thrilling airship action, complete with all hands standing by to repel boarders (and armed skydiving); some quite heroic hand-to-hand combat with a eight-foot-high and sixteen-foot-long scythe-armed giant preying mantis (and thus Tribesaver earns Rowl’s approval to mate with Littlemouse); and not one but two duels to the a) death, b) I pricked my finger on your sword whilst kneeling on your chest after having cut you systematically to ribbons because you tried to make me a weapon against the man I love, congratulations that counts as first blood for you, are you satisfied now? And also this time, several talking cats instead of just one. I demand and expect more of Chief Saza in the future.\n\nNote: there is a lot of similarity to Butcher’s earlier Codex Alera series, except that this is vastly better-written.\n\nSo: plot. This book occurs about two years after the events of the previous novel, but about thirty seconds after the end of Warriorborn, the midquel novella. Our heroes have matured a bit, moved on in their lives and careers. Significantly, our villains have not, but we’ll get to that later. The main trio of junior leads from the first book–Gwendolyn Lancaster, Bridget Tagwynn, and Benedict Sorellin-Lancaster–are now XO of Predator, Sergeant in the Spirearch’s Guard, and Lieutenant of the Guard and Spirearch’s personal emissary, respectively. Benedict’s mission in Warriorborn saw him retrieve a tribe of cats from the mysterious, gutted ruins of what was once a colony-spire of Albion’s. The cats know what happened, but refuse to tell what they know until they are granted a territory of their own in Spire Albion, a task that requires the diplomatic services of one Sergeant Tagwynn and her….companion…Prince Rowl of the Silent Paws, and which soon takes her to the most dangerous place she has been (yet): outside of the Spire, to the actual surface of the world. And. Yikes. It’s a good thing that Bridget Tagwynn is good at thinking outside of the box, and even better at saving people.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s diplomacy afoot. The Spirearch of Albion is sending an envoy party headed by his own Prime Minister to the currently-neutral Spire Olympia; their counterparts from Spire Aurora (the bad guys) are also sending a delegation. Naturally, the actually plot-relevant part of this is the bit where the Spirearch expects the Auroran delegate to challenge one of his ship captains (Bayard) to a duel. The Spirearch details Captain Grimm of the airship Predator to protect Bayard from….underhanded and perhaps ungentlemanly avenues of attack. The good guys’ team is also aided, though underhandedly, by Dutchess Abigail Hinton, a spymistress in her own right and also Bayard’s actual mistress as it so happens. Abigail Hinton is a new and pretty damn likeable character, especially since she brings with her a team of supporting characters of impeccable competence and loyalty (her serving woman keeps offering to just off the enemy duellist with a long gun from a distance, it’d be no trouble at all, ma’am); but anyway what she also brings to the plot is a great deal of complication, as she’s someone who loves Bayard with her whole heart and who will do absolutely anything necessary to protect him if she sees fit. Absolutely. Anything.\n\nAnyway, while our heroes have developed their talents, our villains have developed (control of) a weapon that is, well, not quite the ultimate weapon since heavy gun emplacements and/or an organized squadron of ships acting and firing in unison can keep it occupied or seriously hurt it. But a terrifyingly destructive weapon nonetheless. It’s under the control of Madame Cavendish, and Madame Cavendish is in control of a group of Auroran Marines and of Captain Calliope Ransom’s ship. Madame Cavendish is in fact working for something else, but it’s unclear whether she’s still–as was implied in the previous book–completely under it’s control as a semi-aware puppet, or–as implied in this book–voluntarily working with it. Either way, Captain Calliope Ransom and Major Renaldo Espira are not particularly happy about this, or about what they’ve actually been doing under the madwoman’s–and their King’s–command. But as the situation goes from bad to worse to backstabbing to oh God crystal eyed zombie puppets aaaaaauuuugh, it turns out that when you work for the bad guys you get what’s coming to you and not necessarily what you want.\n\nAnd so it goes.\n\nSo I have a few thoughts: on strong female characters, and a few notes on the writing.\n\nStrong female characters – one of the main criticisms of the Dresden Files (the book series) is that Jim Butcher (the author) is a horrible, hateful misogynist who can’t write strong female characters. This is an allegation I will not bother to take the time to refute because it’s so self-evidently moronic to anyone who has actually read the Dresden Files books. It’s a criticism in the same vein as “orcs are black, JRR Tolkien was racist.” It’s a malicious and purposely defamatory falsehood designed to harm. Nevertheless, Jim Butcher may or may not have taken these criticisms as a personal challenge, because Cinder Spires–and The Olympian Affair–is prominently female-led and the action is actually quite female-dominated. What’s more, these female characters are well-written. They have distinct personalities and they act in ways that are consistent with them. They have plot relevance and the emotional stability to make that plot-relevance seem worthwhile (i.e., they’re not frigging stupid, hormone-addled teenagers with chips on their shoulders). They have principles, duties, orders that they follow–to the death, if needed. And they are, to a one, physically badass. Including the one who is a five-pound talking cat.\n\nOne thing that did stand out about this novel is that JB may have written it as a soft reboot of the series. (As the story goes, JB started writing about the talking cats after having been introduced to them by his then-wife….and when they divorced, she took the cats with her and the series stagnated until he was convinced to resume it by fans.) If that is the case, I’m left wondering if the introduction of a new character–Captain Grimm’s love interest, a dashing and badass yet sultry and sometimes morally ambiguous airship captain–is there specifically to replace his previous love interest–a dashing and badass yet sultry and morally ambiguous airship captain. Their names are even vaguely similar: Ravenna and Ransom. Captain Ransom herself recycles her previous book’s character arc and ends up more or less stuffing herself into a meatlocker in a way that seems rather odd for someone as prominently featured in the previous novel as she.\n\nThat being said, Captain Ransom is not the only character who seems to repeat the previous book’s arc without having earned or learned: Espira, the loyal but conflicted soldier of Spire Aurora, seconded to serve and protect a vicious monster whose existence is basically a war crime while she commits war crimes…is again a loyal and conflicted soldier of Spire Aurora, working for Madame Cavendish, while she commits war crimes. At least he, unlike Captain Ransom…but never mind.\n\nSo, because this review is long enough: it’s a damn good book by an author who knows his trade and if you a) liked, b) disliked Codex Alera, I highly recommend it.\n\n(But I’d have ended the book about two paragraphs sooner.)\n\nRated: Gwen pulled the trigger.\n\nTLDR: it’s just good stuff.\n\nThere are a lot of writing advice that has reached the point of ignored cliche simply because they are so well-known and commonly cited. Show, don’t tell. Brevity is the soul of wit. When in doubt, nuke it from orbit. Thing is, these things are so commonly cited because it’s so common that everyone ignores them and shouldn’t.\n\nMy paperback copy of this book is a trim 188 pages, and that’s counting the table of contents, author bio, and the publishing data. It’s a lean, swift story that is all one thing: high adventure on a far-off world and a young man coming into his own. There’s no digressions–no romance subplots dragging attention away from the main focus–no authorial indulgences sliding off into metaphysical musings or social commentary. Instead, there’s the formation of friendships, respect, and familial bonding of young men with each other; and there is the explanation of a simple and simply-delineated religion and theme, used in service of the plot and nothing else.\n\nThe art of telling a simple, self-contained story, in a single stand-alone novel that is no longer than it needs to be, is a lost one today. Every damn story has to be stretched out into a trilogy (and if it’s a four-part trilogy, so much the better). Every novel has to come with either its own separate encyclopedia of worldbuilding miscellanea, or has to have the equivalent of it stuffed awkwardly into its pages as the author desperately tries to show off and/or justify the work they’ve put in and are doubtless quite proud of. Now, worldbuilding is a good thing: but if one is not John Ronald Ruel Tolkien, it ought to be kept in the background. It should be used to infuse the main story with a sense of verisimilitude, and to enhance the current plot by offering a solid in-universe explanation for, for instance, why the Dead Men are hanging around waiting for the heir of Gondor. If absolutely necessary, characters can also lean on it to explain their actions, but while it’s cute to know that Aragorn mistook Arwen for Luthien Tinuviel on their first meeting and called her that, it’s also irrelevant to the greater scope of LOTR itself. (Although also kinda funny to imagine that calling your crush “Tinuviel” might be regarded as something as a bad pick-up line in Middle-Earth. One imagines Arwen has heard that one before….)\n\nAaand back to the novel I am actually reviewing: there is a lot of verisimilitude in this book, and it’s based on things like Kincar taking the time to stable, rub down, and feed his tired and sweaty larng before he himself takes food or rest. Other touches come just from the quality of the writing, like the simple but entirely unexplained differences in custom between Garthian and Star customs–and between those of the Earth of that current-day reader. There is no intricate history to be revealed and the mysteries of the Three who guard and oversee their Gorthian worshipper’s fates, remain mysteries even to the one selected as their tool and weapon. There doesn’t need to be a dramatic and detailed history of the past when it’s the present that concerns everyone and things are happening with smooth, logical rapidity now and the plot follows the actions–not reactions–of characters with ambitions, goals, and power.\n\nOkay, so, since it’s important: the plot.\n\nThe novel follows young Kincar s’Rud, Daughter’s Son to Hold Styr and therefore legitimate heir when his grandfather and chieftain dies, a fact which his uncle appears to hold some resentment over. Since this is an adventure novel, Kincar’s world is disrupted immediately. He is sent from the Hold with no more than the clothes and armor on his back, a map that will lead him to join his father’s kin, and–buried in his pack–a sacred talisman of his people. Kincar, who is normal-sized, blue-haired and ivory-skinned like all his people, had no knowledge of his parentage before now. He is, however, half of the blood of the Star Lords, the great ones who centuries before came down to Gorth in shining ships, lived on that world, raised its people from their barbarian wanderings, and united with them in culture and kin. The Star Lords, however, have decided to leave Gorth, fearing that their intervention in its culture and history has been harmful rather than good. Most have returned to the stars, but there are some among them whose love for the world is such that they refuse to leave it, instead seeking among all the worlds that are and have ever been, for the Gorth where they can fairly make their home.\n\nKincar soon finds himself among this group of exiles, and they soon to a new Gorth. But they soon find that this is also a world where the Star Lords landed–and here, the Star Lords are not settlers, neighbors, or kinsmen. Here, they are conquerors who demand to be worshipped as gods. And though it is easy indeed for a free man to stand up against a tyrant, it is harder indeed for a man to face one who wears the face–the form–the name–of his own brother, or his father–or himself.\n\nAnd I’m finding it increasingly difficult to write about this critically, so I’m going to just talk about stuff I liked. So there’s the use of animals. Kincar leaves Styr Hold with his riding larng, Cim, and his mord, Vorken. Cim is a beast unlike a horse but which must be cared for in similar manner, and who behaves in a vaguely similar manner when ridden by a person who can’t control him….which, lest we forget that Andre Norton was a grandmaster of the genre, succinctly and deftly leads right back to the plot. Vorken is a flying beast of known intelligence but alien mind, who saves the day more than once but who is also written, convincingly, as an intelligent yet alien creature with loyalty but also her own mind.\n\nThere’s the description of the Star Lords (and Lady) as slightly strange, slightly distant, very human, and very competent. Kincar, having been raised fully-Gorthian, has no real context for these people who are near-giants to him and his society; and he’s slightly wary and very watchful around them….only for his watchfulness to show their very human, very heroic natures. I like reading about heroes. I like reading about heroes who are heroic, kind, mature, and wise. I really liked the characters. Kincar himself is an excellent hero: competent enough through his own training, outsider enough to need things explained to him at times, and active enough to keep himself in the thick of things. He’s honest, honorable, and strong-willed, but still young and aware that he still has much to learn.\n\nThere’s also the darkness, seen, but lightly-described, of the second Gorth. Unlike, say, George R. R. Martin, an actually competent and talented author doesn’t need to dwell on, highlight out, and lingeringly describe the cruelties, torments, corruption, and excesses of this world that is ruled by evil gods. Andre Norton portrays the situation calmly and bleakly–showing a slave woman so broken she can’t bring herself to eat and who dies despite being freed; showing the despair and hatred of a young warrior who believes himself trapped and determines to go down fighting; and the bestial nature of a guardsman who has fully given himself over to the worship of his evil gods in the only way he can exercise it: through cruelty to those under his own power. And, because Norton isn’t a sick weirdo, she also portrays how this world escapes this fate and can–perhaps, with hard work and guidance–rise above it.\n\nThe difference between wholesomeness and unwholesomeness in literature is redemption. Is there a path that the heroes can take that will lead them to a better life, a better place, a better world? Or is there nothing but sludge, blood, lust, treachery, and despair? Is this a world written by an author that looks no higher than the top of the heap, that sees no meaning to anything more or better, imagines no improvement, sees no future? Or is there a way, no matter how hard, that leads to the stars?\n\nRated: Man still dreams–\n\nSo I didn’t get much reading done on my trip last week. I did read:\n\nMaul: Lockdown (Joe Schreiber) – a book about a Sith Lord going undercover in a space prison where inmates are forced into gladiator fights with each other. These fights are broadcast and are enormously popular with the gambling population of the Galaxy. In fact, they’re so popular, the gambling trade commission has sent an envoy to the station to warn the corrupt warden and her mute savant brother that they need to stop with whatever manipulations they are doing to always come out the winner. (I don’t understand gambling personally, so, w/e.) Darth Maul, meanwhile, alias miscellaneous inmate/murderer Jagannath (here, this is translated as “Tooth,” which I found vaguely irritating but also kind of cute), meanwhile, is trying to find a mysterious arms manufacturer and smuggler Iram Radique. Some shenanigans later, it turns out that Darth Plageius is trying to smuggle a small tactical nuke from Iram Radique to the death cult of the Bando Gora, for the use of assassinating Darth whomever, the dude who starred in a story the Jedi wouldn’t necessarily tell you about, etc. There’s also this gigantic space worm thing that eats people alive and absorbs their souls into a screaming mass of semiaware intelligent hunger, but I guess that’s really par for the course for space gladiator prisons.\n\nThis book isn’t half bad. In fact I’d put it a full star ahead of the last Star Wars “novel” I attemped to read: the Timothy Zahn Thrawn book. The Thrawn book read like bad fanfiction. It was unreadable; it had terrible pacing; it had a stupid plot; and established characters were entirely inconsistent with their canon personalities. This book reads like a contemporary thriller, albeit one where the prison gangs have tentacles instead of tattoos. There are characters with consistent personalities and understandable motivations; they act and react in logical and understandable ways to events as they transpire; and there is a feeling of solidity and thought to the worldbuilding and plot. Yes, granted, this is because the world was already built from them; but Schreiber’s characters and in-story plotting are both solid. So. Not half bad. If the rest of the EU was getting to be written on this level, it’s a pity they deleted it.\n\nAnd this week I read:\n\nThe Unexpected Enlightenment of Rachel Griffin – Guardians of the Twilight Lands (L. Jagi Lamplighter) This is a YA book. It’s described by the author as “Harry Potter for girls, with angsty teen romance.” Thing is, aside from a) every magical academy in described fiction makes an impassioned case for homeschooling, b) I intensely dislike the angsty teen romance, c) I intensely dislike that the angsty teen romance revolves around a thirteen-year-old who is in a committed (yeah) relationship with a seventeen year old and a crush on another in his twenties. (Who is in a committed relationship with her older sister.) Rachel is a girl and girls like romance and gossip and hugging and wearing bows in their hair, or so I am informed by reliable sources; this doesn’t mean that large chunks of the book should focus on it. YA as a genre requires a love triangle. But it does freaking not mean that your THIRTEEN YEAR OLD HEROINE should participate in it.\n\nYeah, but aside from that, these books are actually pretty good. There’s a zany kid who slew a dragon and took its hoard, and who also has another dragon sidekick (he gets to fight a dragon again, albeit that it gets killed by lightning-powered railgun); there’s the secret king of the fairies who gets tricked into leading an exciting hurling game and declaring himself publically to save Rachel and the fate of Roanoke Island; there’s Rachel finally getting to talk to her parents and get acknowledgement for the things she’s done; and also Rachel finally starting to get answers from the Guardians of the world as to what is going on with the world–and every other world that exists. And there’s also Rachel being instrumental into saving Roanoke Island (and the world) (again, for the fourth or fifth time.) Which, given that she’s been at Magical Wizard School for all of six months and knows like five spells, reallllllllllllly makes the case for homeschooling, come on what is with such a stupid curriculum?\n\nAnyhow. ‘s not bad.\n\nWarriorborn – Jim Butcher’s latest was released yesterday. This is a novella in the Cinder Spires universe. It’s set probably a year or two / some unspecified continuing adventures after the previous book, and follows Lt. Benedict Sorellin-Lancaster, aka the newly appointed Left Hand of the Spirearch, on a mission. There are warriorborn; there are dragons; there are talking cats.\n\n(I mean, the Cinder Spires world has DRAGONS now, how much more awesome can you get?! The dragons seem to spit acid instead of fire, but still. Ooooohhh, maybe there’ll be an awesome reveal that they can breathe fire, that’d be cool.)\n\nAnd, for some reason, also acid-oozing worm things, augh. Sidenote: is characters getting their hands burned going to be a recurring motif in this series? Because I distinctly remember it happening to Gwen in the previous book.\n\nAnd Benedict Sorellin-Lancaster earns himself a Name.\n\nSo one half of the The Nemesis From Terra / Battle for the Stars double novel having been reviewed, the other half needs must be also. I also read and reviewed this one several years ago, and on reread it absolutely holds up.\n\nBattle for the Stars was published in 1961, and is the work of a polished, mature, and experienced author. Every part of it is welded together with absolute precision, every scene and character supports the overall plot and theme, there is a thrilling battle and victorious conclusion, a vicious twist, and a hopeful denouement. It’s really good stuff by the World Wrecker himself.\n\nSo, plot:\n\nCommander Jay Birrel of the Fifth Lyran Fleet is used to border skirmishes and hit-and-run raids by the stellar powers (ostensibly there are a handful, but practically, the main power struggle is between Lyra, headed by the cunning but tyranical Ferdias and Orion, lead by the unseen Solleremos). A professional military man, he’s an expert at it, in fact. But when he’s informed of the potential for all-out war, war for control of an innocent and unaligned planet, he’s horrified. The Fifth Lyran Fleet is ordered to this planet in order to protect it from the rapacious Orionids — who planned to strike first themselves in order to prevent Lyra from taking it over.\n\nThe planet, needless to say, is the half-forgotten motherworld, Earth. And though Earth is virtually powerless on a galactic scale, still it holds an undefinable power over its far-strayed children, and still its inhabitants are not without pride and do not take lightly to the thought of outsiders deciding their fate….and though Birrel’s orders are to protect Earth, are those truly his leader’s intentions?\n\nEverything about this book is perfectly balanced and utterly satisfying. The plot runs, twists, flashes into space opera action, and I never once had a bored thought or a worry that it wasn’t going to resolve itself correctly as well as satisfyingly. Speaking of space opera action: there’s quite a lot of it, and although I suppose some of it might be dated…it seemed pretty comparable to the last space opera battle I read, which was one of the Lost Fleet books. But I am easy to please as long as there are missiles, lasers, some frantic maneuvering, and for a cherry on top, radio chatter. Man I love me some radio chatter. Anyway, the space battle scenes are very well done in a simple, more visual than technical way that read just fine to my eye. (Does anyone know how space battles are really going to be fought?)\n\nThe novel tightly follows our main character’s POV. Birrel is an everyman hero, rather than an iconic or charismatic one. He’s only average height. He’s a worrier. His wife isn’t happy about coming to Earth with him. He’s a professional naval officer who has spent practically his entire life aboard ships; not a diplomat. He’s loyal, careful, diligent, and completely lacking in duplicity….which, given that he’s been placed directly into the eye of a diplomatic and political firestorm, means that he’s a permanent half-step behind everyone else in the Great Game and miserably aware of it. And he’s a superbly competent leader of men or ships in battle.\n\nOne of the things that a lot of modern media lacks is competence–especially when it comes to leaders and leadership. This stems from a lot of reasons, from an overreliance on being the “underdog” to gain audience sympathy, to a widespread breakdown of trust in social mechanisms, to simple incompetence on the writers’ parts; and whatever the cause, the result is more constrained and cliched stories. For the most part, writers use this as a way of introducing a conflict which they can at length easily solve without exerting themselves or making their characters step outside of comfortable, well-known behavior patterns. They stick to the tried (trite) and true formula of “hero wants to do heroics! Authority forbids, believing it will be unsuccessful! Hero defiantly does heroics, successfully! Authority accepts because successful and congratulates Hero because Hero Is Cool.” Notice that this is a one-note pattern that only requires each party to act in one single way: the way they always have and always will.\n\nHamilton, being an old Grandmaster, doesn’t do that here. Although he sets his hero up at a distinct disadvantage (aka: underdog), Birrel responds to the unusual challenges presented him by changing his method of approach. This pattern requires an author who can present a character and personality with defined preferences, and then present a scenario in which that character would act in a manner different to their own preferences that is still an intelligent manner, because it is consistent with their personality to be intelligent.–and then, the hero having succeeded despite being actually an underdog, out of his depths and preferred sphere, the hero is able to return to his own preferred ground and lead a triumphant (as if that’s a spoiler) battle.\n\nThis is a very good trick. It’s almost as good as the trick where someone ends up manning the antiaircraft guns whilst scantily clad, which Hamilton was also good at.\n\n[wordpress, blessings be upon it, deleted my two summary paragraphs. I can assure you they were brilliant, though.] Anyhow, besides making Birrel step outside his comfort zone, Hamilton also presents us with a quick–but vivid–view of Ferdias, the man Birrel defers to, who understands power and ambition and psychology, but not…quite…emotions. Grandmaster of Scifi, remember? Also: if thou art a tyrant, thou canst not have friends.\n\nGoddamn it wordpress, those were brilliant paragraphs and now I can’t remember them.\n\nAnyhow. There’s also a kitty, which is another automatic win.\n\nRated: The stars are ours!\n\nSo because I occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a scifi review blog and my muse is the all but forgotten Grandmaster of science fiction, noir, and the classic western, Leigh Brackett, when I spotted this one it was a natural buy. (Even if it was overpriced. The only bookstore in a small town, sigh.)\n\n[Ohh, I wonder if the stupid jumping the cursor around thing is wordpress trying to force people not to use the classic editor. That would make a lot of sense. May they live interesting lives and even more interesting afterlives.]\n\nI’ve read and reviewed this before: The Nemesis from Terra was Leigh Brackett’s first published SF story, published in 1944 as Shadow Over Mars. There’s an experience gap that definitely shows–not in the wordsmithing, or the worldbuilding, but in the gritty mechanics of the A to B to And Then It All Went Woosh plotting.\n\nNemesis from Terra / Shadow Over Mars is a simple and somewhat simplified tale of oppression, rebellion, and attaining heroic stature on a Mars that is old beyond memory–old, and time-worn, ground down to dust and yet alive and willing to live and grow young again, should opportunity come that it may grasp. Opportunity provided, perhaps, by an infusion of young, strong, virile energy from Terra, the world to which all worlds will look. However, this opportunity will definitely not come from the Terran Exploitations Company. The Company is quite transparently evil–if its name didn’t tip you off, they press-gang starfarers for their mining crews, hunting them down through the native quarter with Venusian anthropoids and enforcer thugs. Although there is a political organization of civilized Martians and Terrans trying to expose and defang the Company, their efforts are weak because (frankly) they aren’t our protagonists, which I think is kind of a raw deal for the cool, lawfare-minded Hugh St. John the utterly ruthless Eran Mak. And although there are still many on Mars who swear allegiance to their rightful king, and though they serve him with their strength and their whole loyalty, well, they aren’t the heroes either and thus are doomed to fail.\n\nWhich makes it a dicey proposition for absolutely everyone when a half-crazed old seeress foretells Richard Gunn Urquhart’s shadow over Mars. Rick, though, Rick isn’t really a hero….\n\nAs mentioned, plotting is the weak point of this novel(la). Its short length necessitates a level of time compression that doesn’t really help to strengthen the idea that either the villains or the hero/protagonists are particularly smart or good at planning, and there’s a weakness to the parts that don’t involve headlong action which could have been helped with a critical eye and a rewrite. The majority of Rick’s grand plan (one which, we are assured, no one else could have pulled off) is….rile everybody up with a couple of speeches and throw them at the Company headquarters. (But he keeps this plan secret in case they’re being spied on.)\n\nAnd–as I complained about before–both Rick and the author don’t really take any efforts to provide any clever twists, outwit or surprise their opponent or the audience. Rick’s best effort out outthinking Jaffa Storm is “crash a spaceship into the fort;” and the last-minute, last-gasp twist by Brackett is that Rick (wait for it) left-handed, which allows him to take the mind-reading Storm by surprise even though Storm is currently reading Rick’s mind. (I, having not read the book in several years, was expecting there to be some sort of automatic defense field over the Thinkers’ coffins, which Rick could take advantage of.) Unfortunately for Jaffa Storm, he is not left-handed, and thus falls Storm. Again, I think this is just because the brevity of the story doesn’t allow for any of the cat-and-mouse moves that would make a more satisfying plot.\n\nNevertheless. This one is still well worth reading simply because it’s by a Grandmaster of the field who was just coming into her own. Brackett’s Old Mars is there, and lacking her later elegaic* sensibilities, while it is a place old beyond time and full of dust, sins, and shadows, it is also a place where there is life that is young and eager to live.–if it can only find a clear way out. Her secondary characters absolutely steal the show–from the fighting man Beudach, a wolf to men but a dog to his king, who locks the Iron Collar on Rick and pledges him to the future of Mars, and the cold, cunning Eran Mak, who melts it to get it off Rick again–and then there’s the young king Haral himself, who despite his limited pagetime is a leader of men and his people, worthy of the loyalty he is given, undeserving of the death he gains.\n\nJaffa Storm is an interesting antagonist because of the lengths Brackett goes to show that he in fact outmatches Rick in almost every way. He’s bigger than Rick, stronger than him, a better fighter than him, smarter than him (although not smart enough to not monologue.) He’ll throw a trapped man a pack of cigarettes and give him enough time for a last smoke before lighting up the tunnel with a Banning shocker. And he’ll work for someone else only so long as he knows they’re stronger than him. He and Rick have developed quite strong personal reasons for hating each other by the end of the book, and their initial physical confrontation (which Rick loses) is savagely fought and written.\n\nSo it’s quite disappointing, to me, that Rick wins mostly by luck and the author’s intervention, rather than a) skill, b) intelligence, c) overloading Storm’s mind-reading with raw fury and going berserk, but, ah well.\n\nOverall, highly enjoyable, highly recommended.\n\nRated: The wind is rising–"
