This book shines a new light on how you see the overall world of the Hunger Games. The main protagonist in this book is Coriolanus Snow the ruler over the Capitol in the original Hunger Games. It was an odd spin on the book, but it works out perfectly. The number of characters from the original book that are in this book helps it feel more connected to the original series. It also shows how in this world the richest stay the richest and hardly anyone new climbs up the ranks to become wealthy and powerful. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the Hunger Games are also viewed a different way. It is viewed as a way of power over the districts, so they don't have any of the tributes perform, unlike the 74th Hunger Games. I picked this book because I wanted to know what happened before the original Hunger Games. I enjoyed the world-building the most in this book. This book surprised me quite a bit because I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. This is definitely one of my favorite books I've read this year.\n\nMockingjay is the third book in The Hunger Games series. After the events of the 75th Hunger Games District 12 was destroyed, leading to even more uprisings across the districts. In the book Katniss and her allies try to recruit districts to their cause with the help of the newly rediscovered District 13. After everything is planned out the districts start an all-out war with the capitol. With both sides fighting fiercely, it could go any way. I chose to review this book because it is the 3rd book in The Hunger Games series. I enjoyed the war between the Capitol and the Districts the most in this book. This book is fairly predictable. I could relate to Katniss Everdeen in this book because she stands up for what's right even if it's not the easiest route to take like I do.\n\nThe Hunger Games Catching Fire is a sequel to the first book in the series The Hunger Games. The book takes place after the 74th Hunger Games where Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark from District Twelve unexpectedly won the Hunger Games. Katniss, Peeta, and their loved ones were far from safe even after The Hunger Games due to their defiance against the Capitol. The districts were starting to rebel against the Capitol because of what happened in the 74th Hunger Games. President Snow (the leader of the Capitol) forces Katniss and Peetah to make the districts as well as himself believe that they weren't trying to defy the Capitol. After several failed attempts to calm the districts down President Snow took action when the Third Quarter Quell (75th Hunger Games) took place. I picked this book because it is a prequel to The Hunger Games. I enjoyed getting to know the aftermath of the 74th Hunger Games the most. My least favorite part of the book is how they handled The Hunger Games. I didn't feel like it was nearly as intense or interesting as the 74th Hunger Games. This book is also fairly predictable. I could relate to Katniss Everdeen in this book because she didn't know her allies from her enemies in the book, and I'm not too good at reading people in real life. This isn't one of my favorite books but it's definitely a solid book.\n\nThe Hunger Games is set in a dystopian world where the Capitol controls 12 districts. Every year each district is required to send in 2 tributes to compete in the Hunger Games. One female and one male between the ages of 12-18 are drawn at random to compete in the hunger games. The Hunger Games takes place in an arena where all tributes fight to the death until one tribute is last standing and crowned the winner. Tributes can also earn an advantage over other tributes before the games even begin by becoming liked by the general audience of the Hunger Games. If the audience likes a tribute in the Hunger Games, they are more likely to get a sponsor to send them supplies while they are in the arena. I read this book because of the dystopian genre. I enjoyed reading about the tributes in the arena the most in this book. This book is fairly predictable but that doesn't make it any less good to read. This is probably my favorite book of all time.\n\nThis book is about a young girl named Coraline. When Coraline moves into her new house, she finds a weird door in her house that is supposedly bricked off. Later she revisits the door to find out that the bricks are randomly gone. She goes through the door which leads her to an alternate life where everything seems creepily perfect. Everything seems much better in the other world. One weird detail is that everyone in the other world, except for Coraline has button eyes. Is the other world as good as it seems? I picked this book because of the genre. I enjoyed how creative and creepy the book was the most. This book surprised me when I found out about what the other world was. This is one of the best books I've read this year and recommend it."
