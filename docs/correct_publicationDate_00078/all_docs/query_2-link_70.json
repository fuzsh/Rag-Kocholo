        "text": "The Crystal World\n\nBy J.G. Ballard,\n\nFrom my list on where the forest feels like a character.\n\nBy Darragh McManus Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m an Irish author who lives close to three very different forests: deciduous, planted coniferous, and the planned gardens of a former stately home that once welcomed WB Yeats and several other famous writers. I’ve always loved the woods – it often feels like stepping through a portal into some other, stranger parallel world – and drew huge inspiration from these places for Shiver the Whole Night Through. I wanted the forest to feel like a character, which was sentient and had agency. I incorporated several real-life locations into the fictional Shook Woods…and wrote a lot of the story in the forest, gazing into the dark trees, waiting for them to speak.\n\nDarragh's book list on where the forest feels like a character\n\nWhy did Darragh love this book?\n\nA tropical forest in Africa is the epicentre of a bizarre and very troubling phenomenon. Through a sort of “leak” in space-time, everything is slowly turning to crystal, and this “disease” will eventually seep out into the rest of the world. An English doctor goes on an Apocalypse Now-style journey into the forest to try and understand. Ballard’s sci-fi classic is as weird and thought-provoking as always, and the forest itself is a palpable presence throughout.\n\nBy J.G. Ballard,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Crystal World as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom J. G. Ballard, author of 'Crash' and 'Cocaine Nights' comes his extraordinary vision of an African forest that turns all in its path to crystal.\n\nThrough a 'leaking' of time, the West African jungle starts to crystallize. Trees metamorphose into enormous jewels. Crocodiles encased in second glittering skins lurch down the river. Pythons with huge blind gemstone eyes rear in heraldic poses. Most flee the area in terror, afraid to face a catastrophe they cannot understand.\n\nBut some, dazzled and strangely entranced, remain to drift through this dreamworld forest: a doctor in pursuit of his ex-mistress, an enigmatic Jesuit…\n\nPreview\n\nCosmicomics\n\nBy Italo Calvino, William Weaver (translator),\n\nFrom my list on absurdist humor.\n\nBy Michael Sussman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI craved attention as a child, and often used humor to get it. I also loved to read. As I aged, I was increasingly struck by the absurdity of the human condition and was drawn to stories that dealt with the ridiculous, nonsensical, and incongruous sides of life. Prone to depression and fascinated by Freud, I became a clinical psychologist, only to discover that my colleagues were as emotionally disturbed as I was! I even wrote a book about it, titledA Curious Calling: Unconscious Motivations for Practicing Psychotherapy. So, when I turned to writing fiction—Otto Grows Down, Duckworth: The Difficult Child, and Incognolio—I reveled in the absurd.\n\nMichael's book list on absurdist humor\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nCalvino’s Cosmicomics is perhaps the funniest and most outlandish collections of short stories I’ve ever come across. Think Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time meets Alice in Wonderland. Starting with the Big Bang and charting the entire evolution of the universe and of life on Earth, Calvino’s narrator shape-shifts from a man, to a dinosaur, to a mollusk, a single-cell organism, a subatomic particle, and even a disembodied being. In this linked collection of modern fairy tales, the author displays wild flights of imagination, combining scientific rigor with an uproarious repudiation of logic. Oh, and the narrator’s name is Qfwfq.\n\nBy Italo Calvino, William Weaver (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Cosmicomics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIntroducing Little Clothbound Classics: irresistible, mini editions of short stories, novellas and essays from the world's greatest writers, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith.\n\nCelebrating the range and diversity of Penguin Classics, they take us from snowy Japan to springtime Vienna, from haunted New England to a sun-drenched Mediterranean island, and from a game of chess on the ocean to a love story on the moon. Beautifully designed and printed, these collectible editions are bound in colourful, tactile cloth and stamped with foil.\n\nTwelve enchanting and fantastical stories about the evolution of the universe from the giant of Italian literature,…\n\nPreview\n\nLord of Light\n\nBy Roger Zelazny,\n\nFrom my list on hard science fiction by old masters.\n\nBy Stefan Vučak Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI became hooked into science fiction as a kid the day I read an illustrated book of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. From then on, science fiction became an important part of my reading repertoire. Having wide-ranging interests, I enjoy military techno-thrillers, Anglo-French naval warfare, Greek/Egyptian/Roman mythology, most sciences, history of religions, with an occasional novel that strays from the norm and adds a sparkle to my reading. Mary Stewart’s The Crystal Cave and The Hollow Hills are very close to my heart. Just shows that I’m different. After all, I must do something when I am not writing my own novels! Although I have an extensive library of modern science fiction works, I am fond of many oldies.\n\nStefan's book list on hard science fiction by old masters\n\nWhy did Stefan love this book?\n\nThis book epitomizes all the qualities a hard science fiction story should have, and which many fail to achieve. I found the theme enthralling - men turning themselves into gods, and the scenario frighteningly plausible.\n\nI love this story because it deals with real characters and doesn’t spare their flaws. I sympathized with the main character, a man prepared to battle heaven for freedom, shunning the mantle of godhood. This novel not only entertained but also forced me to think, something I relished.\n\nOnce started, this work is difficult to put down and I nodded with satisfaction when I turned the last page.\n\nBy Roger Zelazny,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked Lord of Light as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nImagine a distant world where gods walk as men, but wield vast and hidden powers. Here they have made the stage on which they build a subtle pattern of alliance, love, and deadly enmity. Are they truly immortal? Who are these gods who rule the destiny of a teeming world?\n\nTheir names include Brahma, Kali, Krishna and also he who was called Buddha, the Lord of Light, but who now prefers to be known simply as Sam. The gradual unfolding of the story - how the colonization of another planet became a re-enactment of Eastern mythology - is one of…\n\nPreview\n\nExchange Student\n\nBy Michael R. Lane,\n\nNew book alert!\n\nSponsored by Michael R. Lane Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an avid reader, I read a wide variety of books. Of the fiction genre mystery and suspense remain my favorite. From the classics to the gritty, a well-told mystery is a literary gem. As my mystery palette has aged—like my taste in wine—so are my demands of what makes a good mystery novel. The best mysteries for me contain more than a serpentine journey toward the hidden truth. They have intriguing characters, crisp dialogue, interesting settings, formidable foes, and of course indispensable heroes or anti-heroes. My writing goal is aimed at achieving the same level of literary penmanship of the mysteries I enjoy reading so much.\n\nMichael's book list on African American mysteries\n\nWhat is my book about?\n\nDaniel “Dan” Bluford is the Director of Polar City Single Organism Research Lab Facilities.

My writing is just part of my six decades as an activist for peace and justice, which made me a major target of the FBI’s operation COINTELPRO and led Stanford to fire me from my tenured professorship. I then taught for 40 years at Rutgers University in Newark as The John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies.\n\nHoward's book list on urgent menaces to the human species\n\nWhy did Howard love this book?\n\nNo other book has influenced me so deeply. Arthur C. Clarke wrote it is \"probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written.\" As I now reread Star Maker, published in 1937 when I was three years old, I still find passages so profound that they send my mind into orbit. The book takes us through time and space to a future when that entire conscious cosmos yearns to meet its creator. It ends with a prophetic awareness that “the struggle of our age was brewing” and the hope that our species can make it “before the ultimate darkness.”\n\nBy Olaf Stapledon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Star Maker as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis bold exploration of the cosmos ventures into intelligent star clusters and mingles among alien races for a memorable vision of infinity. Cited as a key influence by science-fiction masters such as Doris Lessing, this classic has left its mark not only in modern literature but also in the fields of social anthropology and philosophy.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's 1937 successor to Last and First Men offers another entrancing speculative history of the future. Its narrator, a contemporary Earthman, joins a community of explorers who travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, seeking traces of intelligence. Along the way, they encounter…\n\nPreview\n\nChildhood's End\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nFrom my list on how things will change when the aliens show up.\n\nBy Craig A. Falconer Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always had a longstanding interest in space, and particularly in aliens. In researching my breakthrough novel Not Alone, I extensively read as much nonfiction content on the topic as I could find, including governmental-backed scenario analyses of how things might actually play out in a contact or invasion scenario. Naturally, I have also read widely in the sci-fi genre for my own pleasure, with most of my interest in this specific topic.\n\nCraig's book list on how things will change when the aliens show up\n\nWhy did Craig love this book?\n\nThis was the first major alien arrival novel I read. I recall being awestruck by Arthur C. Clarke’s masterful mixing of incisive storytelling and a deep sense of grandeur.\n\nThe Overlords are hugely memorable, but it was the exploration of human identity that had the biggest effect on me. The story endures as a classic for a very good reason.\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Childhood's End as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nArthur C. Clarke's classic in which he ponders humanity's future and possible evolution\n\nWhen the silent spacecraft arrived and took the light from the world, no one knew what to expect. But, although the Overlords kept themselves hidden from man, they had come to unite a warring world and to offer an end to poverty and crime. When they finally showed themselves it was a shock, but one that humankind could now cope with, and an era of peace, prosperity and endless leisure began.\n\nBut the children of this utopia dream strange dreams of distant suns and alien planets, and…\n\nPreview\n\nBeegu\n\nBy Alexis Deacon,\n\nFrom my list on for children who love space and science fiction.\n\nBy Diana Mayo Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI usually enjoy painting pictures for storybooks about nature I know, so it was a treat to depict an imaginary place that I’ve never actually seen! I was so inspired to illustrate Mary’s story about the moon, as I could focus on creating an other-worldly atmosphere, adding to the drama that could have happened anywhere. The story focuses on Molly and her family moving to the moon and includes scientific facts about how gravity would impact their everyday life. I used Mary’s knowledge as reference to underpin the imaginative side of my process. Painting the inside of a moon module enabled me to use textures, colours, and lighting in such a fun, expressive way!\n\nDiana's book list on for children who love space and science fiction\n\nWhy did Diana love this book?\n\nI love the fact that no one actually knows who or what Beegu is, though she is instantly adorable and engaging and the reader feels empathy immediately for her.\n\nIt is a very gentle, quiet story about missing home but which had a big impact on me, nevertheless, and the children I’ve read it with seem to understand her sadness.\n\nI think Alexis Deacon’s beautiful paintings have an ethereal, timeless feeling, perfect for the story which could be set in the past, present, or future.\n\nBy Alexis Deacon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Beegu as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBeegu is not supposed to be on Earth. She is lost. She is a friendly little creature, but the Earth People don't seem very welcoming at all. However, so far she has only met the BIG ones. The little ones are a different matter ...\n\nPreview\n\nArmada\n\nBy Ernest Cline,\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nEvery nerd’s dream is to one day be swept away into adventure, and in this book it actually happens for Zack Lightman. Video game mechanics are used as the basis for interstellar combat, and the main protagonist gets to use his epic skills to save the world. How can any self-respecting gamer hate that?\n\nIt’s written by the author of Ready Player One, but instead of that, I chose this because this is much more singularly inspired by gaming. You learn that video games were specifically created in order to prepare humanity for a potential threat, and the better you are at gaming the better humanity’s chances are at winning. I know I’ve had that fantasy at least dozens of times growing up. It’s epic, funny, and has great music. What’s not to love?\n\nBy Ernest Cline,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Armada as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPRE-ORDER NOW - READY PLAYER TWO: THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED SEQUEL TO READY PLAYER ONE\n\n_____________\n\nIt's just another day of high school for Zack Lightman. He's daydreaming through another boring math class, with just one more month to go until graduation and freedom-if he can make it that long without getting suspended again.\n\nThen he glances out his classroom window and spots the flying saucer.\n\nAt first, Zack thinks he's going crazy.\n\nA minute later, he's sure of it. Because the UFO he's staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight…\n\nPreview\n\nScum of the Earth\n\nBy Cody Goodfellow,\n\nWhy did Mike love this book?\n\nIn this novel, human beings have been nearly wiped out and scattered throughout the galaxy when a drug derived from our unusual binary brains becomes the most sought-after recreational narcotic in the universe.\n\nOne human woman and her ragtag crew might be able to save the human race—so long as she can keep straight which reality is real: the one where she plays the hero, or the one where she’s the victim.\n\nA wild, neo-pulp ride through a world like Star Wars crossed with the underground ZAP! Comix, the ending will punch you in the gut and remind you why we flee to fictional worlds.\n\nBy Cody Goodfellow,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Scum of the Earth as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTHEY CAME TO RAID... THEY STAYED TO GET LAID!\n\nFor centuries, alien drug-runners plundered the Earth, harvesting organs and freebasing fear. Few drugs could match the potency of humanity's dysfunctional two-stroke brains, so the Intergalactic Enforcement Force burned it down.\n\nNow, the last scattered, ragtag pockets of humanity strewn across a hundred backwater worlds are the most sought-after cash crop in the universe, and their only hope lies in the unsteady, oversexed hands of a pirate crew of intergalactic trash under the command of a devious cutthroat nymphomaniac known as Callista Chrome.\n\nBut to save the unworthy human race, Callista…\n\nPreview\n\nIn the Ocean of Night\n\nBy Gregory Benford,\n\nWhy did Allen love this book?\n\nThis novel, about the discovery of an alien probe hidden within an Earth orbit-crossing asteroid and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence it provokes, is the first volume of a long, six-volume epic, the Galactic Center series, that is regarded by most critics as a landmark work. You can read this novel on its own or you can go from there with the rest of the series; in any case, it’s hard SF at its thought-provoking best.\n\nBy Gregory Benford,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked In the Ocean of Night as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSet in a world of lunar colonies, cybernetic miracles, fanatic cults, deadly pollution and famine, the first story in the GALACTIC CENTRE CYCLE. This world of social decay is facing hardship, but not far beyond the shores of space comes a mystery, which one man, astronaut Nigel Walmsley is about to touch. From the author of TIMESCAPE.\n\nPreview\n\nRevelation\n\nBy Drew Karpyshyn,\n\nWhy did Matthew love this book?\n\nMass Effect was a very big sci-fi series for me growing up, the technology of which continues to influence my novels to this day. This novel serves as a prequel to the first game in the Mass Effect series, covering an event that was only briefly mentioned within the game itself, where Captain David Anderson works alongside the Spectre Saren, a Turian who despises humanity and believes them to be growing too quickly. Saren’s behavior and beliefs lead to him committing atrocities and then blaming Anderson to sabotage the whole reason why they were asked to team up in the first place, setting the stage for the first game.\n\nBy Drew Karpyshyn,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Revelation as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe thrilling prequel to the award-winning video game from BioWare\n\nEvery advanced society in the galaxy relies on the technology of the Protheans, an ancient species that vanished fifty thousand years ago. After discovering a cache of Prothean technology on Mars in 2148, humanity is spreading to the stars; the newest interstellar species, struggling to carve out its place in the greater galactic community.\n\nOn the edge of colonized space, ship commander and Alliance war hero David Anderson investigates the remains of a top secret military research station; smoking ruins littered with bodies and unanswered questions.
