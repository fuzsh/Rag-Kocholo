        "text": "Bill Evans\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nThe Book Cafe\n\n·\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n--\n\n“I see myself as a novelist, period. I mean, the material I work with is what is classified as science fiction and fantasy, and I really don’t think about these things when I’m writing. I’m just thinking about telling a story and developing my characters.” Roger Zelazny\n\nNine Princes in Amber — here’s a great story title — and the very first of Roger Zelazny’s novels that I read. And my question is, does this even sound like science fiction? The story opens thusly:\n\n“It was starting to end, after what seemed most of eternity to me.\n\n“I attempted to wriggle my toes, succeeded.\n\n“I was sprawled there in a hospital bed and my legs were done up in plaster casts, but they were still mine.\n\n“I squeezed my eyes shut, and opened them, three times.\n\n“The room grew steady.\n\n“Where the hell was I?\n\n“Then the fogs were slowly broken, and some of that which is called memory returned to me.\n\n“I recalled nights and nurses and needles. Every time things would begin to clear a bit, someone would come in and jab me with something.\n\n“That’s how it had been.\n\n“Yes.\n\n“Now, though, I was feeling halfway decent.\n\n“They’d have to stop.\n\n“Wouldn’t they?\n\n“The thought came to assail me: Maybe not.”\n\nThe opening of Nine Princes in Amber by Roger Zelazny\n\nThe novel lies on the fantasy side of the spectrum, except, despite the title, it’s set in modern day America with Tarot cards and the multiverse for subplots.\n\nIt’s an action story with an ongoing mystery: who is this person and why is he running? Right from the opening. Then, yes, slowly bits and pieces of his memory return. He begins to remember: his family — allies and enemies alike. Like an onion, his story is unpeeled layer at a time.\n\nWhat exactly is Amber, or more to the point, where — which is how the multiverse begins to play a role.\n\nWhat places him in the first rank of science fiction writers, what stands out is Zelazny’s throwaway style, the seeming casualness, and his choice of a structure verging on chaos only slowly cohering.\n\nIn medias res with a damn vengeance.\n\nOthers in the field, Philip K. Dick and Harlin Ellison, were chasing the same song. Where Philip K. Dick went deeper toward nightmare and insanity, Zelazny taught me better.\n\nReading the novel for the first time, what struck me was the heavy irony, the skepticism about his characters’ motivations, again both allies and enemies. New Age — very Post-Modern — in the second flowering of science fiction (the book was published in 1970), contradictions were abounding. If one considers the title, it sounds of medieval knights in armor, preserved like Precambrian insects, when in fact the story line is regarding immortality, a reoccurring theme in Zelazny’s novels. Sadly, Zelazny himself didn’t make it into his sixth decade.\n\nZelazny’s tale was enough of a hit, or he was that much entertained by the paradox of the world he’d created to make it through an entire ten book series. With the same ironic style. He let Corwin, the chief character in the first five books speak for him, like a good crime story writer. So while Ross Macdonald’s imitators were doing their best to capture his lightening, Zelazny was working through morality tale after another, like a dog with a favorite bone. Merlin, Corwin’s son, is the lead in the second five books. Not that Merlin — but could be. Zelazny’s sense of mischief was a large part of the game.\n\nPossibly Zelazny’s best is Lord of Light. Certainly his most sophisticated overlay of one myth on a more familiar one.\n\nHis were both lighter and darker stories than Ross Macdonald’s work. Ross Macdonald’s Early Crime is a take on that near contemporary of Zelazny.\n\nThis was the era of Vietnam and civil rights — moral relativity. Or — as Ian Dury of The Blockheads sang in a Cockney drawl — “sex and drugs and rock and roll.” Honest. The song was a minor hit, which says something about the times. We were all wiseasses in our youth.\n\nSo considering Amber: first the deep glowing hue, but mainly the ‘frozen in time’ reference. Amber had always existed, or was soon to become. What it wasn’t was the shadow world his earthbound readers inhabited. Except that it was. The world as we know it was but a shadow of Amber — of which immeasurable shadows exist. It was possible as Corwin passed through the shadow worlds he was creating them, an amusing possibility.\n\nWhat Zelazny was cheerfully plundering in his work was every conceivable mythology, all playing on the inconsequence of mortals in the face of greater power. If that isn’t a morality tale, it’s certainly reality.\n\nHe played with time, batting it back and forth in a one-person tennis match. These princes existed in a multiverse of his making before the term became popular much outside science fiction — one more way science fiction has prefigured science.\n\nOne might think being freed of the natural world’s restrictions made the plotting easier, but in his hands, it only allowed for more gleefully twisted complications and contradictions."
