        "text": "54 NORTHERN CAMEROONS\n\n2. COUNTER-MEMORIAS LUBMITTEDBY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nOFTHE UNITED KINGDOMOFGREAT BRITAINAND\n\nNORTHERN IRELAND\n\nIntroduction\n\nI.This Counter-Memorial is submitted to the Court in pursuance\n\nof an Order of the Court dated 6 July 1961, the time specified in\n\nthat Order for its delivery having been extended by further Orders\n\nmade by the Court on z November 1961,25 Aprilxg62 and IOJuly\n\n1962.\n\n2. In its application to the Court, deposited on 30 May 1961,\n\nand in its Memorial, the complaints made by the Government\n\nof the Republic of Cameroon fail under two heads, namely com-\n\nplaints as tothe discharge by the United Kingdom of its obligations\n\nunder the Trusteeship Agreement tothe inhabitants of the Northern\n\nCameroons and, secondly, as to the conduct of the second plebiscite\n\nin the Northern Cameroons.\n\n3. The Trusteeship Agreement referred to is the Trusteeship\n\nAgreement for the Cameroons under United Kingdom Trusteeship\n\nas approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations on\n\n13 December 1946, and published in United Nations TreatySeries,\n\nVolume 8,page 119,under Registration No. 119.(Fortheconvenience\n\nof the Court, a copy of the Agreement is annexed to thiscounter-\n\nMemorial as Annex 1.)\n\n4. The first part of the Memorial of the Republic of Cameroon is\n\nentitled \"Legal Character of the Dispute\" and it will, it is thought,\n\nbe convenient if, in Part 1, at the beginning of this Counter-\n\nMemorial, the Government of the United Kingdom state their\n\nsubmissions as to the jurisdiction of theurt.\n\n5. Follouing the order of the Memorial, the allegations of the\n\nRepublic of Cameroon conceming the United Kingdom adminis-\n\ntration ofthe Trust Temtory are answeredin Part II ofthis Counter-\n\nMemorialand those relating to the course of the plebiscite operations\n\nin Part III. The United Kingdom conclusions are stated in Part IV.\n\n6. For the convenience of the Court, there are attached as\n\nAnnexes to this Counter-Memorial an account of the geographic,\n\nethnic and historical background of the Trust Territory (Annex II)\n\nand a summary of the relevant features of British administration\n\nunder the international trusteeship system (Annex III). Also\n\nattached are a copy ofthe Mandate (Annex IV), a number of General\n\nAssembly and Trusteeship Council Resolutions (Annex V), a politi-\n\ncal map of the territory of the Cameroons under British Adminis- COUNTER-MEAIORIAL OF THE UNITED KINGDObl\n\n55\n\ntration (Annex VI) and a physical map of the same territory\n\n(Annex VII).\n\n7. Part 1 of this Counter-Memorial raises, as a preliminary\n\nobjection under Article 62 of the Kules of Court, the contention\n\nthat the Court has no jurisdiction in this case. Nevertheless, the\n\nBritish Government consider that it is undesirable that the serious\n\nallegations made by the Repuhlic of Cameroon should remain on\n\nthe record unanswered and, for this renson, they have included\n\ntheir answers on the merits inthe Counter-Memorial. These answers\n\nare submitted to the Court without prejudice ta the preliminary\n\nobjection. NORTHERKCAUEROOKS\n\nPART I\n\nThe Jurisdictionof the Court\n\nA. PROVISIOKS OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT, THE CHARTER\n\nAKD THE TRUSTEESHIA PGREEMEST\n\n8. Article 36 (1) of the Statute of the International Court of\n\nJustice states that \"The jurisdiction of the Court comprises al1\n\ncases which the parties refer to it and al1matters specialiy provided\n\nfor in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and con-\n\nventions in force\". The complaints of the Republic of Cameroon\n\ndo not come ~vithin the first two parts of the Article, and conse-\n\nquently if the Court has jurisdiction to hear these complaints, that\n\njurisdiction can only arise if jurisdiction as to the matters of\n\ncomplaint is specially provided for in a treaty or convention in\n\nforce.\n\n9. The Government of the United Kingdom do not wish to\n\ndispute that the Tmsteeship Agreement was a treaty or convention\n\nwithin the meaning of this Article. It ceased to be in force onIJune\n\n1961in relation to the Northern Cameroons', the application to the\n\nCourt having been made on 30 May 1961. The Governrnent of\n\nthe United Kingdom submit that the Trusteeship Agreement does\n\nnot, when properly construed, provide for the jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt in relation to the matters, the subject of complaint by the\n\nRepublic of Cameroon.\n\nIO. Article75 of the Charter of the United Xations provides that,\n\n\"The United Xations shall establish under its authority an inter-\n\nnational tmsteeship system for the administration and supenrision\n\nof such temtories as may be placed thereunder by subsequent\n\nindividual agreements\". It foiiolvs that responsibility for the\n\nadministration and supervision of tmst territories rests with the\n\ninternational trusteeship system created by the United Nations,\n\nand ultimately with the United Nations.\n\nII. Article 76 of the Charter states the basic objectives of the\n\ntrusteeship system and Article 77 provides for the placing under\n\nthe trusteeship system of territories \"now held under mandate\".\n\nThe United Kingdom held a mandate under Article 22 of the Cove-\n\nnant of the League of Nations to administer the temtory of the\n\nCameroons which was subsequently placed under United Kingdom\n\ntrusteeship.\n\n' Resolutio1608 (XV) adopted by the GeneralAssernbly on21 April1961\n\n(Annex V (40))By the samresolutiotheAgreemen tusterrninatewithrespect\n\ntothe Southern Carneroons inOctokr ,961. COUNTER-IlEhlORIAL OF THE UNITED KlSGDOhI 57\n\n12. Article 79 of the Charter provides that, \"The terms of tms-\n\nteeship ...shall be agreed upon by the States directly concerned,\n\nincluding the mandatory power in the case of territories held under\n\nmandate by a Member of the United Nations, and shall be approved\n\nas provided for in Articles 83 and 8j\". The Republic of Cameroon\n\ncame into existence on I January 1960. It was not, therefore, a\n\nState whose agreement to the terms of tmsteeship of 13 December\n\n1946 \\vas required by Article 79; nor was it a party to the Tmstee-\n\nship Agreement when that Agreement was made. The position of the\n\nRepublic of Cameroon in relation to the Trusteeship Agreement is\n\nexamined further in paragraphs 2 j to 29 below.\n\n13. Article 85 of the Charter provides that, \"The functions of\n\nthe United Nations witli regard to tiusteesliip agreements for al1\n\nareas not designated as strategic', including the approval of the\n\nterms of the tmsteeship agreements ... shall be exercised by the\n\nGeneral Assembly\". and that \"The Tmsteeship Council, operating\n\nunder the authonty of the General Assembly, shall assist the General\n\nAssembly in carrying out these functions\".\n\n14. Pursuant to these Articles of the Charter, the United King-\n\ndom, as the Alandatory Power, sought to place the Cameroons\n\nunder the international trusteeship system and, on 13 December\n\n1946, the General Assembly approved the terms of trusteeship for\n\nthe Serritory.\n\n15. From 13 December 1946 until I June 1961, when the Trus-\n\nteeship Agreement was terminated in relation to the Northern\n\nCameroons (resolution 1608(SV), adopted by the General Assembly\n\non 21 April 1961 (Annex V (40)), the General Assembly had the\n\nresponsibility of securing that that territory was administered by\n\nthe United Kingdom as the administenng authority in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement and with the basic\n\nobjectives of the tmsteeship system as declared by Article 76 of\n\nthe Charter.\n\n16. By Article 3 of the Trusteeship Agreement, the United\n\nKingdom undertook to administer the territory in such a manner\n\nas to achieve the basic objectives of the international trusteeship\n\nsystem and to coliaborate fully \\\\+th the General Assembly and the\n\nTrusteeship Council in discharging aU their functions as defined\n\nin Article 87.\n\n17. By Article j of the Agreement, it was provided that, ipiter\n\nalia, the United Kingdom-\n\n(a) should have full powers of legislation, administration and\n\njurisdiction in the Terntory and should administer it in accord-\n\nance with its own laws as an integral part of its territory ~4th\n\n' The area inquestionwas not de√ßignatedasstrategic, soArticle 83 does not\n\napply.9 SORTHERN CAMEROOSS\n\nsuch modifications as might be required by local conditions\n\nand subject to the provisions of the United Nations Charter\n\nand of the Trusteeship Agreement; and\n\n(b) should be entitled to constitute the Territory into a customs,\n\nfiscal or administrative union or federation with adjacent\n\nterritories under its sovereignty or control, and to establish\n\ncommon services between such territories and the Territory\n\nwhere such measures are not inconsistent with the basic ob-\n\njectives of the international trusteeship system and with the\n\nterms of the Trusteeship Agreement.\n\n18. By Article 6 of the Agreement, it was provided that the\n\nUnited Kingdom should promote the development of free political\n\ninstitutions suited to the Territory and to this end should assure\n\nto the inhabitants of the Territory a progressively increasing\n\nshare in the administrative and other services of the Temtory;\n\nshodd develop the participation of the inhabitants of the Territory\n\nin advisory and legislative bodies and in the government of the\n\nTerritory, both central and local, as might be appropriate to the\n\nparticular circumstances of the Territory and its people; and should\n\ntake al1 other appropriate measures with a view to the political\n\nadvancement of the inhabitants of the Territory in accordance\n\n~4th Article 76 (b) of the Charter, and that in considering the\n\nmeasures to be taken under this Article the United Kingdom should,\n\nin the interests of the inhabitants, have special regard to the\n\nprovisions of Article5 (a) of the Agreement.\n\n19. By Article 9 of the Agreement, the United Kingdom under-\n\ntook certain obligations to al1 Members of the United Nations\n\nand their nationals, namely to take al1 necessary steps to ensure\n\nequal treatment in social, economic, industrial and commercial\n\nmatters and to this end:\n\n(a) to ensure the same rights to al1 nationals of hlembers of the\n\nUnited Nations as to British nationals in respect of various\n\nmatters,\n\n(b) not to discriminate on grounds of nationality against nationals\n\nof any Member of the United Nations in relation to certain\n\nmatters, and\n\n(c) to ensnre equal treatment in the administration of justice to\n\nthe nationals of al1Members of the United Nations.\n\nzo. ArticleIOof the Agreement provided, interalia, that measures\n\ntaken to give effect to Articlg of the Agreement should be subject\n\nalways to the ovemding duty of the United Kingdom in accordance\n\nwith Article 76 of the Charter to promote the political, economic,\n\nsocial and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the terri-\n\ntory to carry out the other basic objectives of the international\n\ntmsteeship system and to maintain peace, order and good govern-\n\nment. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n59\n\n21. By Article 13 of the Agreement, the United Kingdom\n\nfurther undertook certain obligations in respect of missionanes\n\nwho were nationals of the Members of the United Xations..\n\n22. Article 19 of the Agreement provided that-\n\n\"If any dispute whatever should arise between the Administering\n\nAuthority and another Rlemberof the United Nations relating to\n\nthe interpretation or applicationf the provisions of this Agree-\n\nment, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by negotiation or other\n\nmeans, shall be submitted to the International Court of Jus...\"\n\nB. THE EFFECT OF ARTICLE19 OF THE TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT\n\n23. In the submission of the United Kingdom, this Article was\n\nnot intended to give toany Member of the United Nations the right\n\nto indict before the International Court the United Kingdom as\n\nadministering authority of the Territory for failure to discharge\n\nits obligations in relation to the inhabitants of the Territoryder\n\nthe Trusteeship Agreement made with the United Nations. Under\n\nthe Charter, it was the function of the General Assembly acting\n\nthrough the Trusteeship Council to exercise the authority of the\n\nUnited Nations in respect of the administration of the Territory\n\nbrought ulthin the international trusteeship system by the Trus-\n\nteeship Agreement. In the submission of the United Kingdom,\n\nArticle 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement does not and was not\n\nintended to give any Member of the United Nations the right,\n\nexcept as regards obligations specifically undertaken in relation\n\nto Member Statesand their nationals in the Agreement (seepara. 31\n\nbelow), to question before the International Conrt the adminis-\n\ntration of the territory, administration for which the United\n\nKingdom was directly answerable to the Trusteeship Counciland\n\nto the General Assembly.\n\n24. Further, the United Kingdom will in this C~unter~Memorial\n\nshow that the complaints made by the Republic of Cameroon\n\nin their Application to this Court and in their Memonal have been\n\nconsidered and rejected by the General Assembly.\n\n25. If contrary to the contention of the United Kingdom the\n\nview is held that, under Article 19 of the Trusteeship Agreement,\n\na Member of the United Nations can bnng before the International\n\nCourt complaints as to the conduct of the United Kingdom as\n\nadministering authority for which the United Kingdom is answer-\n\nable to the General Assembly, the United Kingdom further submits\n\nthat the Republic of Cameroon, which only became a member of\n\nthe United Nations on 20 September 1960, is not a Member of the\n\nUnited Nations entitled to do so.\n\n26. The jurisdiction of the Conrtunder -4rticle 19 of the Trustee-\n\nship Agreement exists only in the event of a \"dispute\" arising\n\nbetween the United Kingdom and another Member of the United60 NORTHERK CAMEROONS\n\nNations \"relating to the interpretation or application of the pro-\n\nvisions\" of the Agreement, and only if such dispute cannot be\n\nsettled by negotiation or other means. The Republic of Cameroon\n\nin paragraph 3 of its Memorial States that \"the first three com-\n\nplaints\" enunciated in its Application \"are based upon the breach\n\nof the Trusteeship Agreement\" and that \"the remainder put in\n\nissue the Trusteeship Agreement and resolution 1473 (XIV) of\n\nthe General Assembly dated 12 December 1959\" (Annex V (38)).\n\nIn paragraph 4 of the Memorial, the Republic seeks to rely upon\n\nprotests made in the Tmsteeship Council and elsewhere and upon\n\nits Note of I May 1961 to the United Kingdom. The fact that this\n\nNote referred to \"complaints of a legal character\" and enumerated\n\n\"points of law\" as constituting the subject of the Republic's\n\n\"dispute\" with the United Kingdom cannot, by itself, cause a dis-\n\npute to arise. Xor could the additional fact that the Xote of I May\n\n1961 was answered by a Xote from the United Kingdom of 26 May\n\n1961 give nse to a dispute relating to the interpretation or appli-\n\ncation of the provisions of the Trusteeship Agreement. Nor did\n\nthe making of complaints alleged to be based on breach of that\n\nAgreement constitute such a dispute. Even if there ivere dis-\n\nagreement between the United Kingdom and a Memberof the United\n\nNations relating to the conduct of the tmsteeship and the dis-\n\nagreement were a \"dispute\", Article 19 of the Srusteeship Agree-\n\nment would not entitle a Member of the United Nations to invoke\n\nthe jnrisdiction of the Court in order to \"put in issue the Trusteeship\n\nAgreement and resolution 1473 (XIV) of the General Assembly\".\n\n27. The Republic of Cameroon has not any right either on its\n\nown account or on behalf of the inhabitants of the Northern\n\nCameroons to put in issue the Trusteeship Agreement and the reso-\n\nlution of the General Assembly nor did the Republic acquire any\n\nsuch right as a result of the Southern Cameroons joining the Re-\n\npublic on I October 1961.\n\n28. The Republic of Cameroon seeks to attach importance to the\n\nfact that the word \"whatever\" follows the words \"any dispute\"\n\nin Article 19. They say that the jurisdiction of the Court is very\n\n\\vide. But wide though it may be;it depends upon the existence\n\nof a dispute relating to the interpretation or application of the\n\nprovisions of the Agreement. In the submission of the United\n\nKingdom, there is not and has not been a dispute between the\n\nUnited Kingdom and the Republic of Cameroon of the character\n\nrequired in order to give the Court jurisdiction. The Republic in\n\nparagraph I of its Memorial seeks to rely upon Article 36 (2) (a)\n\nand (c) of the Statute of the Court. In the absence of a declaration\n\nby the Republic of Cameroon accepting the jurisdiction of the Court\n\nas compnlsory ipso facto and without special agreement, as required\n\nby Article 36 (z), the references to Article 36 (2)(a) and (c) are COUNTER-ME31ORIAI. OF THE UNITED KINGD03.1 61\n\nirrelevant and throw no light upon the construction to be placed\n\non Article 19 of the Agreement.\n\n29. The Trusteeship Agreement was made between the United\n\nKingdom on the one hand and the United Nations on the other\n\nhand '.The Republic of Cameroon was never a party to the Trus-\n\nteeship Agreement and only enjoyed the benefits of membership\n\nof the United Nations from zo September 1960.\n\n30. If it be the case that the Republic of Cameroon on and after\n\n20 September 1960 was entitletl to rely on Article 19 of the Agree-\n\nment, it is not in the submission of the United Kingdom entitled\n\nto rely upon matters occurring during the currency of the Agree-\n\nment pnor to zo September 1960 to establis11a dispute before that\n\ndate with the United Kingdom for the purpose of giving the Court\n\njurisdiction. Nor, in the submission of the United Kingdom, in\n\nthe event of a dispute sufficient to comply with the requirement of\n\nArticle 19 arising after 20 September 1960, is the Republic of\n\nCameroon entitled to ask the Court to pronounce upon matters\n\nwhich occurred before that date. By becoming a filember of the\n\nUnited Nations, the Republic of Cameroon cannot avail itself of\n\nArticle 19 so as to give the Court jurisdiction to adjudicatc on\n\nmatters in relation to which it would have had no jurisdiction if the\n\napplication had been made before zo September 1960.\n\n31. Further, in the submission of the United Kingdom, the object\n\nof Article 19 of the Agreement was not to give any Member of the\n\nUnited Xations the right to bring the United Kingdom before\n\nthe Court on account of the way in which it discharged its obliga-\n\ntions in respect of the inhabitants of the territory under the\n\nAgreement made with the United Nations for which the United\n\nKingdom was answerable to the General Assembly but to provide\n\na method for adjudication of disputes relating to the obliga-\n\ntions specifically undertaken in relation to Member States and\n\ntheir nationals in the Agrecment. The United Kingdom rccog-\n\nnizes the width of the language of Article 19 but will contend\n\nthat from a consideration of the Charter and the Agreement it is\n\nclear that Article 19was not intended to provide machinery whereby\n\na Member State coiild ask the Court to adjudicate upon the dis-\n\ncharge by the United Kingdom of its obligations in respect of the\n\n' The Trustecship Agreement was registereex oflcihy the Secretariat ofthe\n\nUnited Xations ani October 1947 under Registration Numbcr 118 (United Nations\n\nTrcnty Series. VoR,p. 119).Article 4 of the Kegulatians adopted hy the General\n\nAssembly to give cffect to Artic~o√Øof the Charter (resolution 97 (1)of Do-\n\ncemher rg46) provides that registratiexoflcisohvll take place in the following\n\ncases:\n\n(a) Where the United Nations is a party to the treaty or agreement\n\n(b) \\\\lierthe United Nations has ken authonzed hy the treaty or agreement\n\ntoeffect registration.\n\nAs the Tru√ßtee√ßhip Agreement makes no referenceto registration, that can only\n\nhave beendone on the √πasis that the United Nations was a party to the Agreement.62 NORTHERN CAMEROONS\n\ninhahitants of the territory under the Agreement made with the\n\nUnited Nations and so to duplicate the responsibilities of the\n\nGeneral Assembly and Trusteeship Council.\n\n32. The United Kingdom submit that to interpret Article 19\n\nin the way contended for by the Republic of Cameroon so that the\n\nCourt can now hold an inquest upon the conduct of the United\n\nKingdom during the currency of the Trnsteeship Agreement u~ould\n\nbe to put an unreasonable interpretation not merely on Article 19\n\nitself but upon the Trusteeship Agreement and Chapter XII of the\n\nCharter. Under the Tmsteeship Agreement and the Charter, the\n\nUnited Kingdom was to be accountable to the General Assembly,\n\nwhose duty it was to supervise the discharge of the obligations of\n\nthe United Kingdom in respect of the inhabitants of the country.\n\nIt was not, in the submission of the United Kingdom, intended\n\nthat individual Members should be entitled to indict the United\n\nKingdom before the Court with regard to the manner in which the\n\nUnited Kingdom discharged its trust. The forumfor such complaints\n\nwas to be the United Nations, either the General Assembly or the\n\nTrusteeship Council. Moreover it was intended, the United Kingdom\n\nsubmits, that the United Nations in collaboration with the adminis-\n\ntering authority should have the right and the duty to settle such\n\nmatters definitively. It was not, the United Kingdom submits, in-\n\ntended that decisions of these organs should be subjected to judicial\n\nreview by the Court at the instance of individual illembers of the\n\nUnited Nations, and particularly of a Member of the United\n\nNations who did not hecome a Member until long after the execution\n\nof the Trusteeship Agreement. To maintain, therefore, that Ar-\n\nticle19 has such an effect as the Republic of Cameroon claims, is\n\nto place an unreasonably wide constrnction upon Article 19 and\n\none that is untenable in the light of the Trusteeship Agreement\n\ntaken as a whole and of the Charter.\n\n33. It was considerations such as these which led the British\n\nGovernment to maintain, as they did in their Note of 26 illay1961\n\n(see Annex 2 to Cameroon Memorial), the following:\n\n(a) \"But the dispute in this case does not appear to be between\n\nthem (the British Govemment) and the Cameroon Government,\n\nbut hetween the Cameroon Government and the United Nations\n\nGeneral Assembly '. In administering the CameroonsHer Malesty s\n\nGovemment have throughout acted under the supervision of the\n\nUnited Nations General Assemblyand in accordance with its direc-\n\ntives. Thepolicies or practices with which the Cameroon Govem-\n\nment find fault have been endorsed by the United Nations and it\n\nwould not be proper for Her Majesty's Government to take,upon\n\nthemselves the submission to the International Court of a dispute\n\nconcerning them. Her hlajesty's Govemment's obligations as ad-\n\n' That the Republic of Cameroon was in dispute with the United Nations was\n\nadmitted by its delegation in the Fourth Cornont13 Aprirg6r (AIC.4IS.R.\n\n1141.p. 11:2nd to 4th lines on the page).64 XORTHERN CAklEROONS\n\n\"..it solely upon the basis oflaw that the GovernmentofCamer-\n\noon proposesto place itself\"\n\nand in paragraph 6 of which it is stated,\n\n\"The Govemment of Cameroonproposessimply to ask the Court\n\nto state the law, and no more.\"\n\nIt appears from these passages in the Application and the Memorial\n\nthat the Republic of Cameroon is not seeking any decision from the\n\nCourt, but solely a statement of the law. It is, in effect, seeking\n\nto obtain from the Court an Advisory Opinion with regard to the\n\nexecution of the Trusteeship Agreement which terminated the day\n\nafter the Republic filedits Application to the Court. In thesubmission\n\nof the United Kingdom, Article 19ofthe Agreement was not intended\n\nto and does nothave the effectof enabling the Republic of Cameroon\n\nto obtain such an Opinion; and the Republic is not entitled to seek\n\nsuch an Opinion under the guise of a declaratory judgment. The\n\nlate Judge Sir Hersch Lauterpacht stated in his book The Denelop\n\nment of International Law by the International Court ((1958)p. 250),\n\nafter referring to the fact that the Court has recognized that \"there\n\nare certain limits ... to the Court's duty to reply\" to requests for\n\nadvisory opinions,\n\n\"The Court has exliibited a similar tendency in relation to the\n\nquestion of its competence to render declaratory judgments-a\n\nmatter in a senseconnectedwith Advisory Opinionsinasmuch,unless\n\nthe rendering of declaratory judgments, i.e. judgments unrelated\n\nto a concrete claim for redress in respect of an alleged particular\n\nact,is kept within limits, the jurisdiction of the Court might be\n\nused as a means for obtaining Advisory Opinions by -States (as\n\ndistinguished from requests by an authorized organ or specialized\n\nagency of the United Nations). The Statute wisely makes no\n\nprovision for requests for Advisory Opinions,which are not binding,\n\nby individual States...\"\n\nThe Republic of Cameroon is not seeking any redress; it is seeking\n\nto secure condemnation of the conduct of the United Kingdom in\n\nrelation to the Trusteeship Agreement over a long period of time,\n\nand a period antecedent to its membership of the United Nations\n\nand a period which terminated the day after the Republic filed\n\nits Application to the Court. In the circumstances, in the submission\n\nof the United Kingdom, the Court should refuse to hear the\n\nRepublic's claim and should reject it.\n\n36. Further examination of the Application and the Memorial,\n\nhowever, shows that, despite the statements to the contras.\n\nquote√π above, no questions of law are involved, except possibly\n\non one point, and the Court is not heing asked to statethe law but\n\nto pronounce almost entirely upon questions of fact. The complaints\n\nof the Repiiblic of Cameroon are listed on page 19of its Application.\n\nThey are as foliows: COUSTER-JIE3IORIAL OF THE UNITED KISGDO3I 65\n\n\"(a) The Xorthern Cameroons have not, in spite of the text of\n\nArticle 5, paragraph (b), of the Trusteeship Agreement, been ad-\n\nministered as a separate temtory nithin an administrative union,\n\nbut as an integral part of Nigeria.\"\n\nAs to this, the manner in which the Northern Cameroons has been\n\nadministered is a question of fact. The effect of Article 5 of the\n\nAgreement is a question of law, but it cannot seriously be argued\n\nthat the Agreement required administration as a separate temtory\n\nwhen the Article expressly provides for its administration \"as an\n\nintegral part\" of the Administering Authority's territory.\n\n\"(b) Article 6 of the Tmsteeship Agreement laid down as ob-\n\njectives the development offreepolitical institutions, a progressively\n\nincreasing share for the inhabitants of the Territory in theninis-\n\ntrative services, their participation in advisory and legislative\n\nbodies and in the govemment of the Territory. These objectives.\n\nin the opinion ofthe KepublicofCameroon,have not been obtained.\"\n\nWhether or not they have heen obtained is a question of fact. Even\n\nif the opinion of the Republic was right, no question of the inter-\n\npretation or application of the Trusteeship Agreement (see Ar-\n\nticle 19 of the Agreement) is involved.\n\n\"(c) The Tmsteeship Agreement did not authorize the Admini-\n\nstering Power to administer the Territory as two separate parts,\n\ncontrary to themle of unity, in accordance with two administrative\n\nsystems and following separate courses of political development.\"\n\nThe Trusteeship Agreement replaced the Mandate under which\n\nthe Northern and Southern Cameroons were two separate parts.\n\nThe Agreement did not, nor did the General Assembly or Tmstee-\n\nship Council after its conclusion, require the two parts to be joined,\n\nto beadministeredtogether and to follow the same course ofpolitical\n\ndevelopment.\n\n\"(d) The provisions of paragraph 7 of resolution 1473 relating\n\nto the separation of the administration of the Northern Cameroons\n\nfrom that of Nigeria have not been followed.\"\n\nWhether or not the provisions of the resolntion have been foiiowed\n\nis a question of fact. No question of the application or interpre-\n\ntation of the Tmsteeship Agreement is involved.\n\n\"(e) The measures provided for in paragraph 6 of the same\n\nmental functions and the effective democratization of the system-\n\nof local govemment have not been implernented.\"\n\nWhether they have or have not heen implemented is a question of\n\nfact, not involving the interpretation or application of the Tmstee-\n\nship Agreement.\n\n\"(f) The conditions laid down by paragraph 4 of the resolution\n\nfor the drawing up of electoral lists were interpreted in a discrimi-66 NORTHERN CAnIEROONS\n\nnatory manner, by giving an improper interpretation to the qualifi-\n\ncation of ordinary residence.\"\n\nThis too is a question of fact, not involving the interpretation or\n\napplication of the Trusteeship Agreement.\n\n\"(g) Practices, acts or omissionsof the local Trusteeship author-\n\nities during the period preceding the plebiscite and during the\n\nelections themselves altered the normal course of the consultation\n\nand involved consequencesin conflict with the Trusteeship Agree-\n\nment.\"\n\nWhether they did so or not is a question of fact, not involving the\n\ninterpretation or application of the Trusteeship Agreement.\n\n37. Article 32 (2)of the Rules of Court requires that the appli-\n\ncation should as far as possible statethe precise nature of the claim\n\nand give a succinct statement of facts and ground on nrhich the\n\nclaim is based, these facts and grounds being developed in the\n\nMemorial to which the evidence will be annexed. In the sub-\n\nmission of the United Kingdom, neither the Application nor the\n\nMemorial of the Republic of Cameroon complies with this Rule.\n\nThe Court is asked to declare in hoth documents that the United\n\nKingdom \"failed in certain obligations directly or indirectly flowing\n\ntherefrom [from the Trusteeship Agreement] on the various points\n\nset out above\". The \"various points set out above\" are presumably\n\nthose stated in the preceding paragraph,but neither the Application\n\nnor the Memonal specify the \"certain obligations\" flowing from the\n\nAgreement which it is alleged that the United Kingdom failed to\n\nfulf√º. For instance, the opinion of the Republic that the objectives\n\nspecified in Article6of the Agreement have not been attained, is no\n\nevidence of the fact if it be the fact, and no ground for aiieging a\n\nbreach by the United Kingdom of the Agreement. Moreover, the\n\ntwo annexes filed by the Republic do not constitute evidence in\n\nsupport of any claim by the Republic.\n\n38. In the submission of the United Kingdom, the Court is for\n\nthe reasons stated without jurisdiction in the present case and\n\nshould refuse to hear it. But rather than that they should remain\n\nunanswered, the United Kingdom will answer as systematically\n\nas possible, despite their vagueness, the allegations made by the\n\nRepublic of Cameroon in its Application and Memorial. COUSTER->lEi\\IORI AFLTHE USITED KISGDO>I 67\n\nPART II\n\nThe Legality of the United Kingdom Administration of the\n\nTrust Territory\n\nIntroduction\n\n39. Part II of the Memorial of the Republic of Cameroon in\n\neffect makes thrce allegations against the United Kingdom in\n\nrespect of its administration of the Trust Territory:\n\n(n)first, that the United Kingdom, in breach of the Trusteeship\n\nAgreement, administered the Northern Cameroonsas an integral\n\npart of Nigeria;\n\n(6)secondly, that the United Kingdom, in breach of the Tmtee-\n\nship Agreement, divided the Trust Territory for administrative\n\npurposes, into the Northern and Southern parts; and\n\n(c) thirdly, although the precise nature of this allegation is not\n\nclear from the Memorial, it is apparently suggested that the\n\nUnited Kingdom failed to fulfil the objectives of the Trustee-\n\nship, as set out in Article 7Gof the Charter and in the Trustee-\n\nship Agreement itself.\n\nA. ALLEGATION CONCERNING THE ADZIINISTRATIO NF THE\n\nNORTHERN CAIIEROOSS AS AS ISTEGRAL PART OF NIGERIA\n\n40. The first ailegation, namely that the admiiiistratioii of the\n\nNorthern Cameroons as an integral part of Nigeria constituted a\n\nhreach of obligations undertaken by the United Kingdom in the\n\nTrusteeship Agreement, ignores the plain words of paragraphs (a)\n\nand (b) of Article5 of the Agreement which expressly require the\n\nadministration of the Trust Territory as anntegral part of United\n\nKingdom territory (such as Nigeria then was) and authorize it to\n\nhe constituted intoan administrative union withadjacent territories\n\nunder United Kingdom sovereignty or control (which in this case\n\ncould only mean the provinces of Nigeria)1.\n\n41.The facts on which the British Govemment rely are fully\n\nset out in Annexes II and III to this Counter-Memorial. From these\n\nfacts the foilowing conclusions about the nature of the territory\n\nadministered can be drawn:\n\n(a) The shape and nature of the Temtory was such as to make\n\nadministration of the British Cameroons as an entity imprac-\n\nticahle.\n\n(b) Administration of the Temtory as an entity would not, if\n\npracticable, have been desirahle, since:\n\nThe full terfnArtic5(a) and (b) seoutin paragruph:~7:ofPart 1hcreof.\n\n668 SORTHERK CAalEROONS\n\n(i) The boundary of the former German protectorate was a\n\nhistorical accident resulting from the trading dominance\n\nacquired by the Germans in various parts of the territory\n\nfrom 1880 onwards.\n\n(ii) The German protectorate consisted of fragments of regions\n\nwhich had once been entities in so far as they remained at\n\nal1 constant in the fluctuating fortunes of tribal wars. In\n\nparticular, it included a small part of Adamawa and a\n\nsmall part of Benue-the rest of these empires being\n\nincluded in Xigeria and French Equatorial Africa.\n\n(iii) Consequently, the boundaries of the Territory placed under\n\nBritish administration cut across tribal areas and there\n\nwere rarely ethnic or religious ties between the various\n\ngroups of inhabitants in different areas nlthin the Terri-\n\ntory. In particular, the peoples of the Northern Cameroons\n\nhad greater ethnic and religious affinities with theireigh-\n\nbours in contiguous Nigeria than with the peoples of the\n\nSouthern Cameroons.\n\n(iv) Economically, there was not the slightest prospect of the\n\nTerritory becoming a viable independent economic unit.\n\n(c) For the reasons stated in subparagrapli (b) above, it was more\n\ndesirable that theXorthern Cameroons should be administered\n\ntogether uith the Northern region of Xigeria.\n\nThe facts on which these concliisions are based show that it was in\n\naccordance with the interests of the inhabitants and with the\n\nobjectives of the Trusteeship Agreement to administer the Northern\n\nCameroons as an integral part of Nigeria.\n\n42. Xot only is it clear that this method of administration wns in\n\naccordancc with the Trusteeship Agreement, but, as shown in\n\nAnnex III to this Counter-Memorial, the facts and circumstances\n\nwere nt al1 material times fnlly known to the Trusteeship Council\n\nand the General Assembly, under whose supervision the Territory\n\n\\vasadministered. The situation \\vaskno\\i.n by the General Assembly\n\nat thc time when the Trusteeship Agreement was approved, and\n\nwas fully investigated both by the Trusteeship Council itself and\n\nby United Xations Visiting JIissions and by the Committee on\n\nAdministrative Unions.\n\n43. At no time did the Trusteeship Council or the General\n\nAssembly adopt any resolution taking the position that the manrier\n\nin which the Northern Cameroons was administered by the United\n\nKingdom was incompatible with Article 5 of the Trusteeship\n\nAgreement. Nor did the Trusteeship Council ever find it necessary\n\nto avail itself of the opportunity given by subparagraph (c) of\n\nGeneral Assembly resolution 224 (III) (Annex V (5))to reqnest an\n\nadvisory opinion of the Court as to whether this form of adminis-\n\ntration was within the scope of and compatible wlth the Charter of COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n69\n\nthe United Nations and the Trusteeship Agreement. On the contrary,\n\nsupervision by the General Assembly and the Trusteeship Council\n\nwas exercised on the basis that the territory \\vas so administered.\n\nIt is completely without foundation to suggest now that the\n\nadministration was in any way a breach of the Trusteeship Agree-\n\nment or of the United Nations Charter.\n\n44. \\trith respect to the second allegation, the Trusteeship Agree-\n\nment contains no express prohibition against the division of the\n\nCameroons into two parts for the purposes of administration. As\n\nin the case of ali internationalagreements, the Trusteeship Agree-\n\nment is to be interpreted in the light of the surrounding circuin-\n\nstances, the history of its conclusion and the subsequent practice\n\nof the parties.\n\n45. The facts set out in Annex II to this Counter-Nemorial\n\nexplain why it \\vas neither practicable nor in the best interests of\n\nthe inhabitants to administer the tivo parts of the Territory as a\n\nsingle entity. Certain of the conclusions to be dra~vn from those\n\nfacts have been set out in paragraph 41 above and these arc also\n\nrelevant to the present issue. In addition, there is thensider t'ion\n\nthat the physical character of the Territory made contact between\n\nthe northern and southern parts of it extremely difficult. The fact\n\nis that the Trust Territory\\\\.as 'hot a country in the ordinary sense\n\nof the term but a geographical expression\" (see the report of the\n\nMandatory Power to the Permanent Mandates Commission for 1929\n\nquoted in paragraph 7 of Annex III). Fnrthermore, it must be\n\nborne in mind that the priiiciple on whicli the Territory was gov-\n\nerned nns that of indirect rule, which sought to bring political and\n\nsocial advancement to the inhabitants by working through existing\n\ntribal institutions. Consequently, the preservation of the existing\n\ntribal and religious affiliations referred to in paragraph41 above\n\nassumed importance and led to considerahle differencesof political\n\norganization as between the Xorthern Cameroons and the Southem\n\nCameroons.\n\n46. Having regard to these facts it is, in the submission of the\n\nBritish Government, clcar that the Trusteeship Agreement was\n\nnot intended to reqiiire the administration of the Territory as a\n\nsingle unit. Once more, they rely on the fact that the division of\n\nthe Territory into the Xorthern Cameroons and the Southern\n\nCameroons was known to the General Assembly at the timc when\n\nthe Trusteeship -4greemcnt was approved and formed the basis\n\non which the Trusteeship Conncil and the General Assembly exer-\n\ncised their supervision throughout the period of the trnsteeship.70 NORTIIERN CAMEROONS\n\n47. It may, moreover, be rioted in particular that both General\n\nAssembly resolution 1350(XIII) (Annex 1' (34))and General Assem-\n\nbly resolution 1473 (XlV) (Annex V (38)).concerning the future of\n\nthe Trust Territory, recognized the division of the Temtory into\n\ntwo parts and recommended separate plebiscites in each part.\n\nIndeed, the General Assembly provided by resolution 1608 (XV)\n\n(Annex V (40)) for the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement\n\nfor each part separately and at different timcs. The complaints of\n\nthe Republic of Cameroon imply that the General Assembly itself\n\napproved of and committed breaches of the Trusteeship Agreement.\n\nC.ALLECATIO SOSCERKISG FAILURE TO FULFIL THE\n\nOBJECTIVE SF THE TRUSTEESHIP\n\n48. The third allegation made in the lfemorial seems to be\n\nthat the United Kingdom, in its administration of the Trust\n\nTerritory, failed to achieve the basic objectives of the trusteeship.\n\nThis allegation is made in the vaguest terms and with virtually no\n\nevidence to substantiate it. In the submission of the British Govern-\n\nment, it is disposed of by the facts set out in Annexes II and III\n\nto this Counter-Alemorial. The method of administration adopted\n\nfrom the beginning of British administration was specifically\n\ndesigned to meet the needs of the Territory. In the geographic,\n\nethnic and historical context described in Annex II the United\n\nKingdom sought to govern on the basic principle of indirect rule.\n\nThe reasons for this are explained in Annex III, and can be summa-\n\nrized by saying that the object \\vas to educate the local inhabitants\n\n\"to manage their own affairs and to evolve from their own insti-\n\ntutions a mode of government which shall conform to civilized\n\nstandards\", rather than to impose alien institutions however\n\npraiseworthy they might be. This form of government was approved\n\nby the Permanent Mandates Commission. \\$Then the Territory\n\nbecame subject to the Trusteeship Agreement in 1946 this method\n\nof government nras continued in the pattern of affairs resulting\n\nfrom Nigeria's gradua1 evolution towards independence, but with\n\na full consciousness, as appears from Annex III, of the ultimately\n\nseparate and severable responsibility of the United Kingdom\n\ntowards the Trust Territory.\n\n49. From I October 1960, when the Federation of Xigeria\n\nbecame independent, until the termination of the trusteeship in\n\nrespect of the Northem Camerobns, that part of the Territory\n\nwas administered as an independent entity, although its existence\n\nas a separate entity after the conclusion of the plebiscite was not\n\nin fact contemplated, the choice before the people being either\n\nunion with the Federation of Nigeria or union with the Republic\n\nof Cameroon. In this interim period, in circumstances radically\n\ndifferent from those envisaged by the Trusteeship Agreement, the COUXTEH-MEAlORIAL OF THE UNITED KINGDO>I 7f\n\nUnited Kingdom sought (in the manner described in Annex III)\n\nto implement General Assembly resolution 1352 (XIV) (Annex V\n\n(35)) and to continue to fulfil its obligations under the Trusteeship\n\nAgreement.\n\n50. The basic objectives of the trusteeship system are contained\n\nin Article76 of the United'iVations Charter. They are:\n\n\"(a) to further international peace and security;\n\n(bj to promote the political,'cconomic, social, and ediicational\n\nadvancement of the inhabitants of the tmst territories, and their\n\nprogressive development towards self-governmentor independence\n\nas may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each\n\nterritory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the\n\npeoples concerned, and as may be provided by the term. of . eacli\n\ntrusteeship agreement;\n\n(c) to encourage respect for human rights'and for fundamental\n\nfreedoms for ail,without distinction as to race, ses, language, or\n\nreligion, and to encourage recogiiition of the interdependence of\n\nthe peoplesof the world: and\n\n(d) to ensure equal treatirient in social, economic,and commer-\n\ncial matters forl1klembersof the United Nationsand their nation-\n\nals. and also equal treatment for the latter in the administration\n\nof justice, without prejudice to the attainment of the foregoing\n\nobjectives and subject to theprovisioiisof Article 80.\"\n\n51. In fulfilment of the aims prescribed in Article 6 of the Trus-\n\nteeship Agreement ',the Trust Territory in soine 44 years of British\n\nadministration, procecded on a course of politic4 and social evo-\n\nlution which, overcoming formidable obstacles of every, kind,\n\nultimately allowed the two parts of the Territory to take their\n\nplace as integral parts of the independent sovereign States of the\n\nFederation of Nigeria and the liederal Republic of Cameroon.\n\n52. The burden of substantiating this general allegation is, there-\n\nfore, a heavy one. It must also overcome the simple and fundamental\n\nfact thnt the General Assembly and the Tmsteeship Council of\n\nthe Unite'd Nations.were at al1times in full possession of the facts\n\nconcerning United.Kingdom administration of the Territory. As\n\nalready indicated in paragraph 42 above, year by year, the British\n\nGovernment as Administenng Authority reported on every aspect\n\nof its administration to the Trusteeship Council. It provided each\n\nyear a detailed description and nnalysis, with abundant statistics,\n\nof the development of the Territory. The Trusteeship Council was,\n\ntherefore, fully able to follow this development in aii its aspects\n\nand to assist the General Assembly, in accordance with paragraph 2\n\nof Article 85 of the Charter, in exercising its supervision over the\n\nadministration of the Trust ter rit or^ ..nce again, it mnst be\n\nobserved that at no time did the General Assembly or the Trustee-\n\nship Council record its opinion that the United Kingdom had failed\n\n' ArticlGis fully surnrnarizedin paragrofhPart 1of ThisCountcr-Mernorial.to meet its obligations as Adrninistering Authonty in promoting the\n\naims and objectives of the trusteeship.\n\nPART III\n\nThe Course of the PlebisciteOperations\n\nIntroduction\n\n53. The allegations made by the Republic of Cameroon in its\n\nMemorial are of a most serious character for one Government to\n\nmake against another Government and the burden of proving them\n\nrests squarely on the Government of the Republic. They are pre-\n\nsented in the Memorial without any attempt to support them with\n\nexidence or even to suggest that evidence is available to support\n\nthem. Further, the Rlemorialdoes not specify what legal obligations\n\nof the United Kingdom are alleged to have been broken in the con-\n\nduct ofthe second Cameroonsplebisciteor howthey have beenbroken.\n\n54. It is, therefore, submitted that the Memorialoes not make\n\nout any case for the British Govemment to answer in so far as\n\nit is based on the \"Course of the Plebiscite Operations\". Never-\n\ntheless, while in no way admitting the Republic's auegations either\n\nin fact or in law, the British Government wish to offer the foilowing\n\ncomments on Part III of the Memorial.\n\n55. The preparation and conduct of the plebiscite held in 1961\n\nin both the Northern and Southem Cameroons were supervised\n\non behalf of the United Nations by the United Nations Plebiscite\n\nCommissioner, Dr. Djalal Abdoh, and his staff. Dr. Abdoh, who\n\nwas appointed as United Nations Plebiscite Commissioner by secret\n\nbaiiot at the 794th meeting of the General Assembly on 13 March\n\n1959,made a comprehensive report on the plebiscite contained in\n\ndocument T/1556 which was placed before the Trusteeship Council\n\nat its Eleventh Special Session in April1961, and was placed before\n\nthe General Assembly at its Fifteenth Session in April 1961, as\n\ndocument Al4727 of IIApril 1961.That report.does not make and\n\ndoes not support any allegation of breach by the United Kingdom\n\nof the Trusteeship Agreement or of the United Nations Charter\n\nin any way in connection with the plebiscite in the Northern Cam-\n\neroons. The British Govemment relies on the conclusions drawn\n\nin that report and denies the auegations made in the Mernorial\n\nof any misconduct or any breach of the Trusteeship Agreement\n\nor of the Charter in connection with the plebiscite.\n\n(a) Conduct of Registration.\n\n56. The distinctions between qualifications for voting in the\n\nNorthern and Southern Cameroons flowedfrom the United Nations COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 73\n\nresolutions 1352 (XIV) (Annex V (35)) and 1473 (XIV) (Annex V\n\n(38))cited in the Memorial. The criterion for voting in the Northern\n\nCameroons was the same in 1961 as for the 1959 plebiscite, but the\n\nMernorial does not seek to impugn the earlier plebiscite. The term\n\n\"ordinarily resident\" was fully discussed in and explained to both\n\nthe Fourth Committee and the General Assembly itself hefore\n\nresolution 1473 (XIV) was adopted unanimously in December 1959.\n\nIn any event, the distinction was not caused by \"inadequacy of\n\naction\" in the Northern Cameroons, as may he inferentiaiiy alleged,\n\nalthough the Memorial provides no evidence in support of any such\n\nallegation.\n\n57. In fact, the distinction can be largely traced to the dis-\n\n~~\n\nngrwriicnr bct\\rt:en Go\\.eriimcnt and olq>osiiion in the Suutlivrii\n\nC;inieruuns on the ~iii;~liricat~orifsor i.otiniiitlic 5uutltt:rn Cnm-\n\neroons, which becaAe apparent at the theenth session of the\n\nGeneral Assembly. Discussion in that territory failed subsequently\n\nto produce agreement hetween the parties. There was no such\n\nbackground of interna1 factional interests in the Northern Camer-\n\noons and consequently some distinction in the form of the quali-\n\nfications was to be expected.\n\n58. As the Memorial correctly States, in the Northern Cameroons\n\npersons were registered who could satisfy the simple conditions set\n\nout in Dr. Abdoh's report at paiagraph 375, but these conditions\n\nin no ivay conflicted with the relevant General Assembly resolution\n\n(No. 1473 (XIV), Annex V (38)).\n\n59. The British Government deny the allegations that the regis-\n\ntration was not carried out under the proper control of the United\n\nNations and that the representatives of the pro-Cameroon parties\n\nwere not permitted to follow its course. On thecontrary,theproper\n\nconduct of registration under United Nations supervision is ex-\n\npressly affirmed by paragraph 379 of Dr. Abdoh's report which\n\nreads as follows:\n\n\"The registration itself was well conducted over the whole of\n\nthe period. With the vigilance of Registration Officersand United\n\nNations Observers, and with the aid of the Registration Super-\n\nvisors, who were normally assigned to oversee the personnel in\n\nthree to five registration arens, most of such minor errors such as\n\nomissionsof names and faulty serialisation of registration numbers\n\nwere corrected.\"\n\n60. The British Government further deny that \"electors likely\n\nto vote for reunification with Cameroon were systematically left\n\noff the registers\" and the innuendo in the statement that this was\n\ndone by \"the Chiefs faithful to Nigeria\". In fact, registration of\n\nvoters in the Northern Cameroons was camed out by Assistant\n\nRegistration Officers recruited in the manner described in para-\n\ngraphs 368 and 369 of Dr. Abdoh's report which read as follows:74 NORTHER'I CAhIEROONS\n\ntion areas of the Northern Cameroons, the Administration requiredtra-\n\na total of430Assistant Registration Officers. These oficials were\n\nrecruited from within the Trust Territory with the exception of\n\ntwenty-five students of the Xuman Teacher Training Collegewhich\n\nis situated in Adamawa Province in the Northern Region, but it\n\nis worthy of note that half their number were indigenous to the\n\nNorthern Cameroons. The Assistant liegistration Officerswere re-\n\ncruited from the various educational establishments inside the\n\nTerritory including the staff and pupils of the Teacher Training\n\nColleges at Baissa and Rluhi, of the senior.primaiy schools, and\n\nteachers from the various Native Authority and voluntary agency\n\nschools.\n\n369. Since it was the first time that women had been given the\n\nrightto vote in the Xorthern Cameroons:the Administration made\n\nevery effort toecmit suitably qualified women to serve as Assistant\n\nRegistration Officersand thus ta lend encouragement to potential\n\nwomen voters to come forward to register. A total of twenty-five\n\nwomen served as registration officiaisin the various districts in the\n\nNorthern Cameroons. and United Nations Observers and Admini-\n\nstrationOfficiaisalike attested to their efficiencyand effectiveness.\"\n\n61. It is not clear precisely what allegation is based on the increase\n\nin the number of registered voters in &luhiand the two districts of\n\nDikwa. There was not, however, anything sinister in this increase\n\nwliich was partly due to theregistration of yomen votcrs for the\n\nfirst tirne, partly to increased interest in the active campaign\n\npursucd by the advocates of bath points of view in the plebiscite\n\nand partly to natural causes.\n\n(b) Distribution of Voting Papers.\n\n62. The impartiality of the operation is doubted by reference\n\nta an aiiegation that agents in the pay of the Government of Nigeria\n\ndistributed voting papers. This is denicd and the inference is conse-\n\nquently unsupportecl. Xo paid agents of the Nigerian Government\n\nhad any opportunity of distributing voters' cards. Tliese were\n\ndistributed by the Assistant Registration Officers, who were almost\n\nentirely inhabitants of the Northern Cameroons (para. 368 of\n\nDr. Abdoh's report, op. cit.). This was in accordance witli para-\n\ngraph 7 of the Northern Cameroons Plebiscite (Registration)\n\nRegulations 1960 (Annex XVII to the report of the United Xations\n\nPlebiscite Commissioner), which laid down in detail how persons\n\nwere to be registered and cards issued. '\n\n63. It is denied that persons wishing to protest to the United\n\nNations Observer at Mnbi urere prevented from doing sa for fear\n\nof reprisals, or that the police interrogatedhose who did so. Neither\n\nthe United Nations Observer at Mubi nor any resident of Mubi\n\nmade any such complaint to the Administrator or his staff. The\n\nUnited Nations Office in Rlubi, together with that of the Adminis-\n\ntrator, the Resident and the District Officer, were on an open site COUNTER-hlEAlORlAL OF THE UNITED KISGDO31 75\n\nand were naturally closetogether in that they had al1been construct-\n\ned specially for the administration of the plebiscite. The police did\n\nnot interfere in any way with access by inhabitants of the Trust\n\nTcrritory to the United Nations Plebiscite Commissioner or the\n\nobservers. It is significant tliat no case in which they did so is cited.\n\n(c)Psychological Climate.\n\n64. The allegations made under this heading, without any\n\nevidence in support, are gener'ally denied.\n\n65. The allegation of an \"unfavoiirable psycliological climate\"\n\ncan best be considered by refcrence to the full comments on the\n\ngeneral political situation in paragraphs 523 to 533 of Dr. Abdoh's\n\nreport. Dr. Abdoh States that in matters to which he drew attention\n\nhe had the co-operation and understanding of the Administrator\n\nand that measures taken as a result of allegations and complaints\n\nwent a long way to\\\\rards removing obstacles to the exercise of\n\npolitical nghts by al1concerned.\n\n66. Similarly, the report, paragraphs 452 to 457, treats in great\n\ndetail of the question of arrest, wliich answers in factual terms\n\nthe somewhat generalized allegations of arrest and imprisonment\n\nwhich are denied.\n\n67. Dr. Abdoh does not refer at al1to the visit of the Secretary-\n\nGeneral of the Cameroon Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the context\n\nin which it is placed in the hfemorial, nor does he refer tothe aUegec1\n\narrest of more than 300 supporters of \"reunification\" returning from\n\nMaroua.\n\n68. The United Nations Observers were from time to time asked\n\nto ascertain the facts in regard to alleged arrests. The results of\n\ninvestigations are fully set out by Dr. Abdoli, and the pattern and\n\nconclusion of one of these enquiries may be mentioned as an cx-\n\nample in rebuttal of the charges. On II November, Mallam Umaru\n\nRficika, President of the KFP (a party favouring union with the\n\nCameroon Republic), made an aUegation that the prison had been\n\nfilled with people because of their political associations.' He nras\n\nasked for the prisoners' names, but was unable to provide any.\n\nHe then asked permission to visit the jail so that he could\n\nfind out \\Vhothey were. He visited the jail and produced a list of\n\nseven cases. Other names were added by another person bringing\n\nthe total to rz. Of these only seven cases of jm~risonnient could\n\npossibly be considered to have arisen from offences having any\n\npolitical connotation. These 'cases are listed in paragraph 455 of\n\nDr. Abdoh's report. Dr. Abdoh shows that the possibility of allowing\n\npersons charged with offences to be represented hy counsel of their\n\nchoice was considered but ded out because no provision existed\n\nfor the appearance of defence -lavers in Native Court procedure.76 NORTHERS CAMEROONS\n\n69. His report shows, further, that steps were taken by the\n\nAdministrator to meet his anxieties about cases arising in particular\n\nurider section 393 of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria.\n\n70. Dr. Abdoh describes (para. 461) an investigation carried out\n\nby the United Nations Liaison Officer at hfubi, together with the\n\nKesident and Mallam Yero, the representative of the Government\n\nof Cameroon, into di prisoners at that time in Mubi jail. Maliam\n\nYero visited the jail to interview these prisoners and on the basis\n\nof these interviews, a list was prepared showing that there were\n\nonly 15 cases of offences in connection with political meetings.\n\nDr. Abdoh adds:\n\n\"According to the report of the SeniorDistrict Officer,upon con-\n\nclusion of the questioning MallarnYero expressed himselfas being\n\nsatisfiedthat the personsconcemed had been irnprisoned on reason-\n\nable and legitimate grounds, and only requested that the four\n\nprisoners awaiting trial should be brought before the Courts as soon\n\nas possible. This, the Senior District Officerassured him,uld be\n\ndone. Mallam Yero also warned three of the prisoners he had seen\n\nthat since permits were required to hold political meetings, they\n\nshould have observed the law. He told thern that similar laws in\n\nrespect of public meetingsexisted in the Republic of Carneroonand\n\nasked the three persons concerned to convey what he had said\n\nto the other prisoners.\"\n\n71. The 43(sic) persons referred to by the Cameroon Government\n\nas being reported to the United Nations Observer at Mubi on\n\n24 January were investigated by the Plebiscite Comrnissioner.\n\nAn analysis of these names and 16 other names suhmitted, making\n\na total of 58, showed that II names were duplicated, eight could\n\nnot be traced, IOwere releascd before the plebiscite, one was released\n\non bail before the plebiscite, seven had no political significance,\n\none appeal was dismissed and one allowed, four were awaiting appeal\n\nand Ij did not appeal; at the time of the plebiscite 20 of these\n\npersons were, in fact, in prison and of these seven were imprisoned\n\non convictions which had no political significance (para. 477).\n\n72. The complaints of arrests came almost entirely from the\n\nMadagali, Michika and Muhi districts of the Mubi Native Authority\n\nwhere the parties favourahle to unification with the Cameroon\n\nRepublic had consistently shown themselves as contesting the\n\nlawful authority of the newly constituted Native Authority and of\n\nthe Native Courts. The 35 persons reported on zg January 1961,\n\nmentioned in the pamphlet as arrested are referred to in detail in\n\nparagraphs 471 and 472 of the Plebiscite Commissioner's report.\n\nOf these persons four were imprisoned and the remainder fined.\n\n73. The Magistrate's judgrnent indicates that the incident arose\n\nfrom persons making their way into a Native Court and interrupting\n\nproceedings. These proceedings had to be suspended. The Magistrate\n\nsaid that \"the defence has produced nothing to weaken the prose- COUNTER-MEhiORIAL OF THE UNITED KINGDObl 77\n\ncution evidence ...It is clear that the intention of this assembly\n\nwas to intimidate the native court by a show of force.\"\n\nB. IRREGULARITIE AND LACK OF SAFEGUARD DURING\n\nTHE PLEBISCITE CAMPAIGN\n\n(a) Alleged Discriminatory Measures.\n\n74. These allegations are denied. In respect of freedom of speech,\n\nDr. Abdoh describes in his report how a directive nas issued by the\n\nAdministrator, requiring Native Authorities to grant a permit for\n\nany public assembly unless they were satisfied that a breach of the\n\npeace \\vas likely to arise. Of the period after this directive was issued,\n\nthe United Nations Plebiscite Commissioner reports:\n\n\"486. Therecontinued to be a fewinstancesin whichpermits were\n\nrefused,sometimesforvalid reasons,e.g.to hold meetingson market\n\ndays in or near the market places. addition, a few permits were\n\nrefusedbecause the applications were either vague or contained\n\nrequests for meetings to be held on morethan one day. In those\n\ncases where the reasons for refusal were different from those set\n\nout in the proclamation, representations were made and, usually.\n\nfollowingan investigation, the permiwere granted.\"\n\n75. There was no discrimination against those favouring \"re-\n\nunification\". Of the few permits refused, more related to applica-\n\ntions by the XiiDP/KFP than to applications by the other parties,\n\nbut in most cases this was hecause, although the prescribed pro-\n\ncedure was well known tothe applicants, they neglected to follow it.\n\n76. No permission was reqnircd for meetings other than those\n\nheld in public places. There was no requirement of permission for\n\nmeetings in private places and no restriction on the number of\n\npersons who could attend these meetings. Very many such meetings\n\ntook place and were attended by anything up to about zoo persons\n\nat a time.\n\n77. The allegations of discrimination in respect of political\n\npublications can be refuted by reference to paragraphs 490 to 498\n\nof Dr. Abdoh's report. In paragraph 491, he describes how, as a\n\nresult of a complaint by the NKDP, he agreed with the Adminis-\n\ntrator that only parties registered in the Northern Cameroons or\n\npersons eligible to vote in the plebiscite would be entitled to dis-\n\ntribute propaganda posters and leaflets. He adds that subsequently\n\nal1 posters favouring union witb Nigeria were properly identified\n\nwith the name of the printers and the sponsors. In the case of some\n\nposters favouring union with the Republic of Cameroon, this was\n\nnot so.\n\n78. It is denied that documents had, under the law or in practice,\n\nto be printed in Nigeria, and that material from the Republic of\n\nCameroon was refused admission. Thc only requirement under the\n\nlaw was that posters should bear the name of the printer and the7S SORTIiERS CAJIEROOSS\n\npubiisher and that persons wishing to publisb matter of a poiitical\n\nnature should notify the Adrninistrator and deposit with him copies\n\nof the test. This law was not intended for purposes of ccnsorship,\n\nand was never so regardecl. Dr. Abdoh says (at para. 497) \"... no\n\ncharges of censorship aere ever made\".\n\n79. The Administrator personally advised officialsof the NI<DP/\n\nKFP how they could comply with the law and in fact large numbers\n\nof posters printed in the Kepublic of Cameroon did circulate in\n\nthe Territory. The ailegation that material from tlie Repuljlic of\n\nCameroon was forbidden may have arisen from the incident referred\n\nto in paragraph 49s of the report of the United Nations Plebiscite\n\nCommissioner. In this case, a poster publishcd by the NKI)P/KFP\n\nand printed in the Republic of Cameroon, but not deposited with\n\nthe Administrator in advance, was withdrawn at the request of\n\nthe Administrator on the grouiids thnt it could be used to mislead\n\nthe population.\n\n(O) Alleged Restrictions on Movement.\n\nSo. It is denied that movemcnt was improperly restricted as\n\nalleged in the Rlemorial.\n\nSI. It is true that under the la\\\\. as it stood at the begiiining of\n\nthe campaign, vehicles from the Kepublic of Cameroon were required\n\nto carry third-party insurance and registration in the Trust Terri-\n\ntory. No vehicle was, howe\\rer, at any time during tlie plebiscite\n\ncampaign prevented from entering the Trust Territory because it\n\nlacked these documents, with the single exception of one car that\n\nhad been involved in an accident.\n\n82. Notwithstanding this, as soon as the Administrator's atten-\n\ntion \\vas drawn to the fact by Dr. Abdoh that the law might impede\n\nthe entry of vehicles, even though it had never been applied for\n\nthis purpose, hetook steps to promiilgate a law (described in para. 500\n\nof the report of the Plebiscite Commissioner) \\\\.hich removed these\n\nrequirements, and to draw it to the attention of the partics.\n\n83. On the general question of complaints made that movement\n\ninto and out of the Territory \\vas restricted, the United Nations\n\nPlebiscite Commissioner States in paragraphs SOI and 502 of his\n\nreport the following:\n\n\"501. ...The United Nations Liaison Officer in Mubi, for his\n\npart, reported that he had passed through tlie frontier between\n\nthe Territory and the Republic along the road from Mubito Garoua\n\non at least six occasions and that he had visited the borderon,at\n\nleast four other occasions, and that he had not noted an? pol?ce\n\nofficers or othei authorities posted for the purpose of stopping\n\n'vehicles. Xeither 1 nor United Nations officials wlio travel!ed\n\nrepeatedly on the road from hlubi to Garoua found a checkpoint\n\non the PITorthemCameroonsside of the border. COUNTER-ME>IORIAL OF THE UNITED KISGDOXI 79\n\n502. With regard to the complaint made ...that persons from the\n\nRepublic of Cameroon were not freely admitted to the Northern\n\nCameroons, it should be iioted that a similar statement had pre-\n\nviously been made by persons from within the Territory as well.\n\nThesecomplairits werebrought tomy attentionand that oftheUnited\n\nXations Liaisoii Officer in hfubi, and iio evidence was found tliat\n\nthe free movement of persons into and out of tlie Territory had\n\nbeen impeded. In fact, during the period when these complaints\n\nwere investigated the Mayor of Garoua was moving freely about the\n\nTerritory, even prior to his accreditation as Liaison and Information\n\nOfficer fromtlie Republic at hfubi.\"\n\n(c) Alleged Activc Participation of Authorities and Officiais in\n\nFavour of Nigeria.\n\n84. Ali allegations of intimidation which are directed in general\n\nagainst British and Nigerian agents and officials, and in particular\n\nat the Resident at Rlubi, are denied. In so far as they derive from\n\nthe position and influence of the Resident at Mubi, they are mis-\n\nconceived in thcir purported factual foundation. The Resident was\n\nnot in charge of the Administration and was seconded to the\n\nNorthern Cameroons from Nigeria and paid from Northern Cam-\n\neroons funds. The allegation as to the future of officials in the\n\nevent of failurc can necessarily be refuted only by comparison\n\nwith treatment of officials who assisted in the south during the\n\nplebiscite. Members of the Nigerian service seconded (in exactly\n\nthe same way as in the Northern Cameroons) to the Southern\n\nCameroons have been free to revert to the Nigerian service in spite\n\nof the result of the plebiscite in that part of the territory.\n\n85. In respect of the employment of officials generally, this is\n\ndealt with in paragraphs 420 and 421 of the report of the Plebiscite\n\nCommissioner as follows:\n\n\"420. As regards expatriate staff, it would, have heen in the\n\nAdministrator's view wholly impracticable to bring to the Territory\n\nand to employ in its administration expatriate officials from tlie\n\nUnited Kingdom or from British territories who were neither\n\nacquainted with the problems of the area nor able to communicate\n\nwith the people in the local languages. It was for these reasons\n\nthat the Administering Authority decided to retain on a second-\n\nment buis from the Xorthem Region Government the services of\n\nsuch numbers of officiais (British as well as Nigerians) as were\n\nrequired for the administration of the Northern Cameroons. Their\n\nnumbers, although limited during the period when the Territory\n\nwas administered as a part of the Northern Region, had to be supple-\n\nmented hy additional staff when the administration of the Northern\n\nCameroons was constituted as a separate unit with its own admin-\n\nistration. Tliese officials, including the newly appointed Resident,\n\nwere also seconded to the Northern Cameroons from the Northem\n\nRegion Government.\n\n421. It was inevitable that the links of the above officials with\n\nthe Northern Region Government, which most of them had served80 NORTHERNCAMEROONS\n\nfor someyears past, as wellas their ownsympathiestowards Nigeria.\n\nwould open the door to suspicion of partiality and become the\n\nsubject of bitter complaints from the parties which favoured union\n\nwith the Republic of Cameroon. However, no specificevidence of\n\nimpropriety was brought to light.\"\n\n86. The allegation in respect of the Arabs of Bama is denied. A\n\nfuU investigation was made into the charges at the time and they\n\nwere without foundation, and the Resident stated that the facts\n\nalleged were incorrect.\n\n87. The allegation in respect of discrimination in the withdrawal\n\nof representatives is denied. An identical letter was addressed to the\n\nrepresentatives in the Territory of both Governments,inviting them\n\nto withdraw on the date in question personalities from ontside the\n\nTerritory who had been advising the parties in the campaign. As\n\nexplained in the two letters, in addition to theficialrepresentatives\n\non each side, one pcrsonality and six press and radio represcntatives\n\nwere permitted to remain. Both Governments were treated equally\n\nand each representativc was informed that an identical letter was\n\nbeing sent to the other. Both sides complied with the letter and\n\nneither made any complaint.\n\n88. The Government of the Republic of Cameroon alleges that\n\nthree days before the plebiscite 700 armed police were brought in\n\nto the Trust Territory from Xigeria to persuade the population that\n\nunless they voted for Xigeria they were liable to be arrested, perse-\n\ncuted and forcibly removed. It is denied that a \"considerable\n\nnumber of Xigerians\" were permitted to enter to \"increase the\n\npsychological action undertaken\" or for any purpose \\vhatsoever.\n\nSg. The allegation as to the entry of 700 police is denied and is\n\ntotally unfounded, as is clcar from paragraph 436 of Dr. Abdoh's\n\nreport. A total of 15 police were brought into the Territory diiring\n\nJanuary 1961 to bring the establishment up to the agreed figure\n\nof 172 for the whole Northem Cameroons. No other police were\n\nbrought in at all.\n\ngo. In view of the reference to \"troops\", it should perhaps be\n\nmentioned that at no time were any army personnel present in the\n\nNorthern Cameroons, with the exception of the detachment of\n\nIOI signals officcrs and men supplied by the Nigerian army at the\n\nexpress reqiiest of the United Nations Plebiscite Commissioncr for\n\npurposes of radio communication during the voting and counting\n\nperiods.These units had been present in a similar capacity during\n\nthe 1959 plebiscite; they performed no other duties than those of\n\ncommunications and carricd no arms. COUSTER-MEhIORIAL OF THE UNITED KISGDODI 81\n\nc. IRREGULAR~TI ENSD LACKOFSAFEGUARDS IN\n\nTHE COSDUCT OF THE PLEBISCITE\n\n(a) Presiding Officers at PoUing Stations.\n\ngr. The allegations in respect of these officials are completely\n\nrefuted by reference to paragraph 574 of Ilr. Abdoh's report, which\n\nreads as follows:\n\n\"A total of 760 Presiding and Pollingficerswere recruited from\n\nwithin the Northern Cameroons, with the exception of twenty-five\n\nstuderits from the Numan Teacher Training College in Adamawa\n\nProvince of the Northern region of Nigeria. Of the latter, some\n\nwere residents of the Northern Cameroons. Althoug1 had requested\n\nthe Administrator in so far as possible to recruit staff fromg\n\nqualified persons in the Northern Cameroons, 1raised no objection\n\nto the employinent oftlies25students because these men's previous\n\nexperience and their knowledge of the difficultMambilla plateau\n\ncould most usefully be employed during the polling period. The\n\nPresiding and Polling Officerswere recmited from among senior ar?d\n\njunior primary-scl~ool teachers, mission-school teachers aiid pupils\n\nwho had completed standard IV or above. Training courses were\n\nheld at eacti of the Returning Officers'headquarters, lasting over\n\nperiods of fromeiglit to nine days. These courses wcre begun 28\n\nJanuary and lasted until 6 February. During the training courses,\n\nthese officialswere instructed in the construction of polling stations.\n\nthe mechanics of polling, and their duties conceming the delivery\n\nof ballot boxes to the counting centres and were issued written\n\ninstmctions.\"\n\n(b) The Secrecy of the Ballot.\n\n92. The auegations as to intimidation by means of defective\n\npolling booths and police influence are denied. The polling stations\n\nwere constmcted to a standard design; their construction made it\n\nimpossible for anyone to see inside the polling booths; no police\n\nwere anywhere permittcd inside the polling stations. At a great\n\nmajority of poUing stations there were no police prescnt nt all; in\n\none or two cases whcre police were uscd nt the polling stations, such\n\npolice were Native Authority Police (i.e. h'orthern Cameroonians)\n\nand not Tmst Territory Police (Le. Nigerian Police on loan to the\n\nTrust Temtory Administration and under the authority of the\n\nAdministrator). It must be recalled that in the entirc Territoryof\n\nthe Northern Cameroons the total number of police at the time of\n\nthe plebiscite was 391 (167 Nigerian Police hired for service in the\n\nNorthern Cameroons, 45 in the Native Authority Police training\n\nunit and 179 other Native Authority Police; the latter224 were\n\nNorthern Cameroonians). It woulcl, therefore, have been qiiite\n\nimpossible for these to have exercised a significant influence on\n\n378 polling stations, even if they had been present to doSO.\n\n93. Furthermore, the \"system of two polling stations\" in no way\n\nprejudiced the fair conduct of the ballot.82 SORTHERN CAblEROOSS\n\n94. Thereasonsfor votingon two days in the Northem Cameroons\n\nare set out in paragraphs 554 to 556 of Dr. Abdoh's report. In\n\nparagraph 556, he wntes:\n\n\"In order to enahle the largest possible number of inhabitants,\n\nparticularly the recently enfranchized women, to participate in the\n\nl'lebiscite, and wishiug to avoid the introduction of polling staff\n\nfrom outside the Tmst Territory, 1agreed to the extension of the\n\npolling period from one to two days, provided that the Plebiscite\n\nAdministrator could assure me concerning the safety of the ballot\n\nboxes during the night separating the two pollingdays. The assur-\n\naPlebiscite Administrator designatedn12rFebmary 1961 to be an the\n\nadditional Pollingay.\"\n\n(c) Lack of Minutes of the Polling.\n\n95. In respect of the allegation that the niles for the plebiscite\n\ndid not provide for minutes of proceedings in which grievances\n\ncould be entered, the Plebiscite Regulations, approved by the\n\nUnited Nations Plebiscite Commissioner, were suhstantially similar\n\nto tliose for the Sonthern Cameroons plebiscite and had been\n\nstudied by him together with the latter, with a view to obtaining\n\nthe largest possible degree of uniformity (para. j39 of his report).\n\nProvision was made in them for complaints about the conduct of\n\nthe voting to he made in the form of voting petitions. Not a single\n\nvoting petition in respect of the North was received under these\n\nRegulations (para. 59s of Dr. Abdoh's report).\n\n96. The allegation that some of the ballot boxes arrived sealed\n\nand that voters were not called upon to note that they were empty\n\nhefore voting began is denied. Under the Regulations al1 polling\n\nboxes had to be shown empty and open to the polling agents ap-\n\npointecl by the two parties before voting hegan. NO complaints\n\nwere received by the Plebiscite Aclministrator that tliis rvas not\n\ndone.\n\n(d) Alleged Intervention by Pro-Nigerians.\n\n97. The allegation that there was an ovenvhelming majority of\n\nNigerians and representatives of pro-Nigerian parties appointed\n\nas staff of the polling stations is denied. The method of selecting\n\nthe Presiding and Polling Officers has been already described\n\nabove. The vast majonty of them were Cameroonians and they\n\nwere chosen by the Plebiscite Administrator's staff mainly from\n\nteachers and pupiIs, on grounds of their competence to do the work.\n\nThe other staff at the polling stations were polling marshals and\n\nfemale searchers, who were al1Cameroonians.\n\n98. The Government of the Re~ublic of Cameroon alleges that\n\npress representatives of the Republic were refused the right to\n\nspeak to anyone, or even to go into the booths to venfy that both\n\nthe ballot boxes were there. COUXTER-AlEhlORIAL OF THE UXITED KIKGDOAI\n\n83\n\n99. In order to maintain the secrecy of the poli, no one except\n\nPlebisciteOfficiaisand United Nations Observers, and the poi√ºng\n\nagentsappointed by the parties, were dowed to go into the booths.\n\nThe press representatives of the Republic of Cameroon were in fact\n\nactive members of the campaign force of the parties who advocated\n\nunion with the Republic and it isunderstood that they were deputies\n\nin the Parliament of the Republic. The United Nations Plebiscite\n\nCommissioner writes in paragraph 512 of his report:\n\n\"However, 1 agreed to the Administrator's suggestion that each\n\nof the two Governments concemed be invited to designate six press\n\nrepresentatives tocorneto the Territory to witness the polling and\n\ncounting of the ballots. Accordingly, invitations were sent by the\n\nAdministrator to both Govemments and, so far as 1 am informed,\n\nthe Republic of Cameroon sent one representative to each of the\n\nareas in which a counting centre was located. The Govemment of\n\nthe Federation of Nigeria, forits part,imited itself to sending a\n\nfew cinecameramenand photographers to the Territory.\"\n\n(e) A√ºeged Incidents and Victimization.\n\nroo. It is denied that the black ballot hoxes were positioned so\n\nas to favour Nigeria. In paragraph 582 of his report, the United\n\nNations Plebiscite Commissioner describes the siting of the ballot\n\nhoxes as foilows:\n\n\"During their course of training. polling staff were instructed in\n\nthe constmction of polling stations and each was provided with a\n\nannaxis between the borders of the Republic of Cameroonand then\n\nFederation of Nigeria and that theballot boxes were placedin the\n\nrespectivedirections.In this way, a total ofpollingstations were\n\nerected in the 246 registration areas of the Northem Cameroons\n\nin locations which had previously been sited by the Returning\n\nOfficers. The polling staff wasalso provided with al1 necessary\n\nequipment called for in Regulation 7, before being sent to their\n\nstations.\"\n\nNo complaints were made about this arrangement.\n\nror. The incident at Za was dealt with in accordance with the\n\nplebiscite regulations and the facts are that a report was received\n\nat Mubi that the Za polling stations had closed down in accordance\n\nwith the regulations owing to a disturbance having occurred.\n\nIt was understood that the I'residing Officer had allowed both\n\npoi√ºng agents to go into the booth unaccompanied and there was\n\nan altercation with regard to some ballot papers which had not\n\nbeen placed in either box and this had led to a disturbance and the\n\npoiiing station had been damaged. A superior Police Officer and\n\nthree Trust Terntory Police proceeded to the station during the\n\nnight which was over 18 miles from the road and he was accompanied\n\nby a Polling Supervisory Officer with instructions to reopen the\n\npoil on 12 Fehruary. In view of the fact that there was a dispute\n\n7S4 SORTHERN CA3IEROOSS\n\nwhether certain ballot papers had or had not been properly placed\n\nin a box, the poll at this station \\vas started afresh and was com-\n\npleted on 13 February in accordance with the Regulations. This\n\nwas the only incident of the kind inal1the poiiing stations.\n\n102. The aiiegation of intimidation and arrests and the throwiiig\n\nof stones is denied. No more than one or two persons were nrrested\n\nas a result of disturbancesduring the days of poiiing. Dr. Abdoh\n\nobserves in paragraph 586 of his report that poiling on both days\n\n\"proceeded in an exemplary manner and without major incidents\".\n\n(fi Allegations that the Cnstody of the Ballot Boxes and their\n\nClosing Did not Offer Guarantees of Safety.\n\n103. The aiiegation that the security arrangements for the ballot\n\nboxes were inadequate is denied. In paragraph 588 of his report,\n\nthe United Nations Plebiscite Commissioner states that he is satis-\n\nfied that the provisions for the security of the ballot boxes were\n\ncompletely adequate. Although there was no provision for the\n\nPolling Agents representing the parties to spend the night on\n\nthe premises where the boxes were kept, they were entitledtoaffix\n\ntheir own scals to the boxes, and, as tlie Plebiscite Commissioner\n\nsays in paragraph 589 of his report, in some cases they did sleep\n\noutside the buildings where the boxes were stored. The account\n\ngiven of the demonstration of the sealing process in the presence\n\nof the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the\n\nRepublic of Cameroon is inaccurate. The box mhirh wa√Æ success-\n\nfdly opened by the Representative of the Cameroon Government\n\nhad not been properly tied and sealed, as he himself pointed out at\n\nthe time.\n\nD. IRREGULARITIE ANSD LACK OF SAFEGUARD IN THE\n\nCOUNTIKG OF VOTES\n\n(a) Transport and Supervision of Ballot Boxes.\n\n104. The couuting of votes was completed in three days, which\n\npenod was shorter than anticipated in al1 the circumstances. In\n\nthe Southern Cameroons, about which no complaint is made,\n\ncounting took four days.\n\n105. The description in the Jlemorial of the manner in which\n\nballot boxes were collected and numbered is inaccurate. The\n\narrangements are described in Dr. Abdoh's report as foilows:\n\n\"..Only the Returning Officersand the United Nations observers\n\nwere in possessionof the codes and knew the number belonging to\n\na particular polling station. The Counting Agents, altliougli able at\n\nal1times to satisfy,themselves of the accuracy of the count, could\n\nnot identify a particular polling station as such. During this proce-\n\ndure the Counting Agents were located at a point close enough to\n\nthem to observe the coding operation by the Returning Officer\n\nand the United Nations Observer, but not closeenough to be able COUSTER-IIEJIORIA OF THE UNITED KISGDO~I 85\n\nto identify the code number with its polling station.

The inferences suggested by reference to the natio~iality\n\nof the poi√ºng officers are not admitted. If, however, the Poiiing\n\nOfficers or any of them had a predilection for union with Nigeria,\n\nthis in no way affectedtheir conduct of the counting operations.\n\nDr. Abdoh describes the choice of counting officersin paragraph 576\n\nof his report as foUows:\n\n\"...those selected for this important function had for obvious\n\nreasons to be selected from amongst non-Carneroonians. Also ex-\n\ncluded by commonconsent were those officialswho were primarily\n\ncharged with the administration of the Territory. In the circum-\n\nstances, the field of choice wasnarrowed to technical or contract\n\nofficersand their wives. In some instances priests and missionary\n\nstaff were selected to serve. At one counting centre, forsample,\n\nthe counting officers included a priest of the Roman Catliolic\n\nChurch, a n~irsingsister, two professional engineersand a doctor of.\n\nmedicine.\"\n\nIt may be noted that the same arrangements were made for the\n\nselection of counting officers in the Southern Cameroons plebiscite.\n\n107. For reasons of secrecy it was considered necessary that the\n\nrepresentatives of the parties should not be able to determine the\n\nnumber of votes cast for their party at each polling station. How-\n\never, the Counting Agents appointed hy the parties were able at\n\nal1 times to satisfy tliemselvcs of the accuracy of the count, and\n\nal1allegations to the contrary are denied.\n\n(c) The Proclamation of the Results.\n\n108. The United Kingdom repeats and relies on the facts set out\n\nabove to controvert the inferences sought to be drawn from the\n\nmethod of publication of the results of the plebiscite.\n\n109. The British Government thus submit that the allegations\n\nin respect of the plebiscite are misconceived.\n\nFirst,they are frequently based on facts which in the United\n\nKingdom submission are untrue.\n\nSecondly, the inferences drawn from those facts which are ad-\n\nmitted are not truly derived thcrefrom, and the inferences and\n\njustifications raised by the United Kingdom present a fair descrip-\n\ntion of the plebiscite.86 XORTHERN CAMEROOSS\n\n110. The United Kingdom subrnits that the conduct of the plebis-\n\ncite is most fairly summarized in Dr. Abdoh's report at para-\n\ngraphs 599 to 605.\n\nIII.
