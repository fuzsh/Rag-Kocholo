        "text": "The legend began\n\nbeneath these dark hills\n\nAnd under this same sky.\n\nIt tells of a sword\n\nof great power,\n\nForged for the conqueror\n\nJulius Caesar.\n\nThis weapon was passed\n\ndown until it reached\n\nThe last of Caesar's noble\n\nline, the emperor Tiberius.\n\nOn his death. It was hidden away to\n\nkeep it from the hands of evil men.\n\nFor generations. It\n\nlay in a secret place.\n\nMarked by the sign of a pentangle.\n\nAnd as it was written. Under\n\nthe very gaze of Caesar.\n\nI, Ambrosinus, born in Britannia...\n\nWas one of many\n\nmen who sought it.\n\nIn a time of injustice,\n\nI made it my life's\n\ntask to find the sword\n\nAnd the one righteous\n\nenough to wield it.\n\nI journeyed far\n\nacross the Continent,\n\nThrough the heart of an empire\n\nthat ruled half the known world.\n\nNow a threatened Rome was\n\ncalling back her bravest and best\n\nTo defend her boundaries.\n\nGUARD:\n\nMake way!\n\nGood to be home, Commander?\n\nIs this what I'm\n\nsupposed to wear?\n\nI can't even remember\n\nhow to put it on.\n\nWhy ask, Vatrenus, hmm?\n\nWhy me?\n\nBecause they trust you.\n\nYou are a true Roman.\n\nBesides, 'tis a glorious thing,\n\nthey say, to guard the new Caesar.\n\nWe held Africa for them for 10 years,\n\nGrew old on their battlefields,\n\nLost good men.\n\nWhat was it all for?\n\nWe're soldiers, Aurelius.\n\nPoliticians make the decisions.\n\nAURELIUS:\n\nTwo breeds of men\n\nto be avoided like the pox-\n\n- (Blade scrapes)\n\n- ... politicians and philosophers.\n\nYou know, in Alexandria they\n\ncut off the hand that steals.\n\nNo, please.\n\nOnce the hand is off, it's for God\n\nto decide whether you live or die.\n\nMost die.\n\nBatiatus!\n\nDo it outside. It'll make\n\na mess. Blood everywhere.\n\n- Who's this?\n\n- Thief. Caught in the act.\n\nI'm not a thief.\n\nNow he's yours, big man.\n\n- One hand or two, Commander?\n\n- Oh, just the one.\n\n(Chuckles)\n\nNo, let me go, please!\n\nI wasn't gonna steal it, I\n\nswear to you! I give you my word.\n\nAURELIUS:\n\nYour word?\n\nYou?\n\nA street boy? A thief?\n\nHow can you be a\n\nman of your word?\n\nI just wanted to look at it.\n\nI am Aurelianus Caius Antonius,\n\ncommander of the Imperial Guard.\n\nI am asking you,\n\ndo you lie to me?\n\nI would not lie to you.\n\nYou come back in ten years, boy.\n\nI'll give you your own sword.\n\nNow get out.\n\nAnother worthy foe\n\nvanquished then, Commander.\n\nIt's heartening to see soldiers\n\nof Rome display such valor.\n\nWho are you?\n\nOne who knows humiliation\n\nto be a poor teacher...\n\nFor both men and boys.\n\nI smell a philosopher.\n\nAre you all right?\n\n- Take the boy and go.\n\n- In our own good time.\n\nHeh. He said go, old man.\n\nMore than a philosopher, then.\n\n(Blowing softly)\n\nHow'd he do that?\n\nEvery time we have goose for\n\ndinner, you do that same old trick.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nHave I done that one before?\n\nAnd I didn't need your help.\n\n(Fountain trickling)\n\nEither way, you missed\n\nyour Greek lesson.\n\nHow come you never told\n\nme you knew how to fight?\n\nGet out of here, both of you. Go, go!\n\nLet them pass.\n\n- Odoacer.\n\n- Orestes.\n\nFor ten years I have supported Rome.\n\nTen years my warriors\n\n- Have fought beside your legions.\n\n- Who is that?\n\n(Whispering) The commander of the Goths.\n\nODOACER:\n\nSo now here I am...\n\nTo claim my dues.\n\nAnd what are your dues, General?\n\nOne-Third of all Italy.\n\n(Scoffs)\n\nYou think I'm joking?\n\nIs this true, Orestes?\n\nDid you make such a pact?\n\nNo... how could I promise\n\nwhat isn't mine to give?\n\nODOACER:\n\nOne-Third of Italy.\n\nThat way the alliance continues\n\nAnd your new Caesar\n\nWill not topple from his throne\n\nlike the others before him.\n\nI promised you nothing beyond\n\nthe reward you were already given.\n\nYou've grown so tall, Orestes...\n\nYou forget whose shoulders you stand on.\n\nRomulus, where have you been?\n\nWe've been looking everywhere.\n\nAmbrosinus, you took him\n\noutside without a guard?!\n\n- You know the\n\ndanger. - No, I-\n\nIt's a fine morning. We went\n\nfor a walk. No harm done.\n\nYou know what tomorrow holds for him?\n\nFor all of us.\n\nI know perfectly well, Orestes.\n\nI have as much care for\n\nyour son as you have.\n\nWhat did you say?\n\nYou go too far, schoolmaster.\n\nLeave us.\n\nOrestes, sometimes I think\n\nyou forget he is just a boy.\n\nHe has your blood in his\n\nveins, bloodline of the Caesars.\n\nHe was never just a boy.\n\nMother, in five years there\n\nhave been five emperors...\n\nAnd they were all murdered.\n\nWhat will happen to me?\n\nYou will be guarded by the best.\n\nYou will live long and rule wisely.\n\n(Cheering)\n\nMy son...\n\nThis day you join the immortals.\n\nCaesar! Caesar! Caesar!\n\n(Clanks)\n\nMother, am I now the most\n\npowerful man in the world?\n\nYou are.\n\nThen why can't I stay out\n\non the day I am crowned?\n\nWhat am I to be, a god or a boy?\n\nYou are Caesar, and my\n\nCaesar must be protected.\n\nBut who would harm me?\n\nThe one you saw, Odoacer the Goth.\n\nHe is our ally.\n\nAnd you, teacher of words and numbers,\n\nWhat is the business\n\nof the state to you?\n\nMy only concern is the\n\nwelfare of your son.\n\nYou make concern yourself no longer.\n\nHe is Caesar now.\n\nHe's still a boy.\n\nPerhaps he still needs me.\n\nWell, your task is over.\n\nLeave us. Don't come back.\n\nORESTES:\n\nRomulus...\n\nHail, Caesar.\n\nThis is Aurelius, of the Nova Invicta.\n\nHe will command your personal guard.\n\nMay I see your sword, Commander?\n\nHe must do everything\n\nto protect me from harm,\n\n- Must he not, Father?\n\n- Indeed, he must.\n\nTo the last breath.\n\nAnd do I have your word on that?\n\nYou have his word.\n\nHe is sworn to serve you.\n\nIs it so, Commander?\n\nThank you.\n\nI only wanted to look at it.\n\n(Blade scrapes)\n\nVATRENUS:\n\nOpen the gate.\n\nAMBROSINUS:\n\nAnd this\n\nis also Caesar's will?\n\nVATRENUS:\n\nYou've been well rewarded.\n\nGo back where you came from.\n\nMy crime is putting new\n\nideas into a young head,\n\nTeaching a lad to think for himself.\n\nThis lad is our emperor.\n\nWhich do you serve:\n\nCaesar or your own ideas?\n\n\"A wise man never asks\n\nwhat another man serves...\n\n...for only his actions\n\nwill speak the true answer. \"\n\nYou've read your Seneca.\n\nI find poets as\n\ndangerous as philosophers.\n\nAnd you...\n\nWhere did you get this?\n\nAMBROSINUS:\n\nA long time ago...\n\nIn another land.\n\n(Screams)\n\n...from a man who loved only power.\n\nSo you're an adventurer, as well.\n\nIf I see you again in Rome,\n\nit'll be on the point of my sword.\n\nTake care in the mist, Commander.\n\nIt may hide what the gods\n\nthemselves dare not look upon.\n\nNESTOR:\n\nbut who will guard\n\nthe guardians themselves?\n\nNestor?\n\nLeave us.\n\nA senator.\n\nWell, these sit better\n\non me than armor ever did.\n\nHow is it with you, Aurelius?\n\nOh, a little older... no wiser.\n\nAfter all these years?\n\nDid you ever marry, have children?\n\nNo.\n\nSo what do you make of Rome?\n\nDifferent.\n\nUneasy.\n\nIf you're to guard our new\n\nCaesar, keep your wits about you.\n\nAnd come see me. Friends are\n\na rare commodity these days.\n\nI will.\n\nGUARD:\n\nThe Goths! They've betrayed us!\n\n(Shouting, swords clashing)\n\n(Catapult rumbling)\n\nGUARD:\n\nYou! To the wall!\n\nCommander!\n\nPrepare to fire!\n\nAurelius!\n\nDown!\n\nDefend the Emperor!\n\nGet back, behind! Go! Go!\n\nForm wall!\n\nMAN:\n\nOver this way!\n\nGet back, boy!\n\nYah!\n\n(Yells)\n\nUgh!\n\nFather!"
