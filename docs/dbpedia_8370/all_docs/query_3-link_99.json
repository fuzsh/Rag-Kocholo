        "text": "It's about 470 A.D., during the final age of Rome, for the tale of The Last Legion (2007). A magic sword passed through the lineage of Caesar has lain hidden for many years.\n\nBen Kingsley plays a Merlinesque figure who wanders into a Roman camp. His name is Ambrosinus, &amp anyone deeply familiar with the Arthur legend knows that one of the names of Merlin is very similar, Ambrosius.\n\nRomulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) is a bold child of Orestes (Iain Glen), a Ceasar, &amp Ambrosinus is his teacher. The boy has gone exploring away from the protection of his father's household, &amp nearly comes to grief, until Ambrosinus steps in &amp proves that being an old man doesn't mean he's weak.\n\nIn five years there have been five Caesars, all murdered one after another, &amp the boy already has cause to worry over his fate. When he is crowned the new Caesar, he wonders, \"What am I to be? A God or a boy?\"\n\nThe Goths are allies, but troubling ones. When Romulus becomes Ceasar, his father sends Ambrosinus away, &amp Aurelius (Colin Firth) is made the boy-emperior's protector.\n\nSoon the Goths betray Rome &amp the young Emperor is at risk. His parents are killed, &amp the boy captured by Odoacer (Peter Mullen), the leader of the Goths.\n\nIt's all quite amazingly staged, &amp rather convincing as filmic tales of sword &amp sorcery go. The boy &amp Ambrosinus are to be imprisoned on Capri. Aurelius &amp his band seek to liberate the boy emperor, assisted by the veiled assassin of Constantinople, Mira (Aishwarya Rai).\n\nMira is a phenomenal woman warrior character, a fine scimitar fighter, given plenty of action. She alone is worth entry into this film.\n\nContinuing the Arthurian parallels, the magic sword is a direct \"Sword in the Stone\" borrowing, &amp the sword he reclaims on Capri is called Caliburnus, a well known name of Excaliber.\n\nLiberated from Capri, it remains to discover the Ninth Legion in Brittania, at Hadrian's Wall, the last outpost of the Roman Empire. Our little band escapes across the channel, but will be pursued relentlessly by the Goth villain.\n\nWhen they arrive on the White Isle, they find the countryside harrassed by the warlord Vortgyn (Harry Van Gorkum). And they can find nothing left of the Legion, but only the Wall.\n\nIt is now that it becomes obvious why the story has been borrowing so heavily from Arthurian lore, as we're to believe all things Arthurian are of Roman origin, the Celts being insignificant to to Celtic history &amp myth.\n\nSome of the Legionaires do survive. They've gone native, &amp live as Celts. It is for the young Emperor to inspire their rising against the local warlord as well as the vicious Goths. They will never return to restore Rome, for Brittania will become a great nation in time, due to these Romans.\n\nThis is a small film, though addressing sweeping epic themes. The love story between the swordswoman &amp Aurelius is trite but acceptible. Ambrosinus as the \"sorcerer\" who only uses tricks is cool enough.\n\nFight choreography is superb if a little bloodless. The boy emperor lends it the feel of a children's movie, but his face is so expressive he's fine in the role. In all, good viewing for the adults of the family too.\n\nThe notion that a native ruler is evil but a ragtag remnant of Roman legionaires are true defenders of freedom is amazing bullshit, however. That Pendragon is the last of the Caesars, whose predestined son will be King Arthur, extends the idea that Romans are good, native Brits are bad. The explanation for this chauvinism in favor of Rome is the fact that the film was produced by Dino de Laurenties, &amp the story itself is Italian in origin.\n\nThe script was been based on La Ultima Legion (2003), a novel by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, available in English editions from Macmillan, Pan, &amp Washington Square books. Manfredi is an Italian historian who for his fiction gloms onto any excuse to make all things throughout the world racially connected to his nation, even the national epics of other countries that kicked Roman ass. It definitely makes The Last Legion feel like it should've been in Italian &amp shown mainly in Italy, &amp occasionally comes off as bizarre to have it actually filmed for English speakers.\n\ncopyright Â© by Paghat the Ratgirl"
