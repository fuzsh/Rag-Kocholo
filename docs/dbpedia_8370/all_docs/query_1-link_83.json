        "text": "Demetrius:\n\nYou kept your armor after all these years?\n\nTertius:\n\nTen years as a farmer gives you something worth fighting for. Twenty as a legionary teaches you to be ready for the day.\n\nDemetrius:\n\nGood man.\n\nAurelius:\n\nMy friends, we've all seen many mornings like this one. Together we've watched the sun rise, and not known if that day would be our last. Some comrades I've seen, scarcely out of boyhood, trembling before their first battle.\n\nDemetrius:\n\nIt was a cold morning, Commander.\n\nAurelius:\n\nThat it was, Demetrius. And you men of the Ninth Legion, all of us, together we have fought all our lives for the Empire our ancestors created, and together we have watched that Empire crumble to dust. And with its fall we have lost two friends. I can tell you that in the darkest moments, I came to believe that there was nothing left to fight for. But I've been shown, through the wisdom of others, that there is one more battle to be waged, against tyranny and the slaughter of innocents. Let us defend to the last breath this island of Brittania, against those who would tear out its heart and soul! And then those who come after us l remember that there was such a thing as a Roman soldier, with a Roman sword, and a Roman heart!\n\n[draws sword]\n\nAurelius:\n\nHail, Caesar!\n\nAll:\n\nHail, Caesar!\n\n[Romulus is brought in chains before Odoacer]\n\nOdoacer:\n\nIs it for you that so many people have died? Such an innocent face.\n\nWulfila:\n\nThe blood of the Caesars runs in his veins.\n\nOdoacer:\n\nLord Wulfila here thinks I should fear you. Is this true?\n\nWulfila:\n\nHe is the last of the bloodline! End it now! Old Rome will die, and we will rule!\n\nOdoacer:\n\n\"We?\" *We* rule? Take care, Wulfila. Sometimes your tongue runs ahead of your brain.\n\nOdoacer:\n\n[draws his sword] What do you say, boy? Should I be afraid of you?\n\nRomulus Augustus:\n\nWhy is Caesar treated so?\n\nOdoacer:\n\n\"Why is Caesar treated so?\"\n\n[Odoacer seizes Romulus by the hair and holds up the sword so that his face is reflected in it]\n\nOdoacer:\n\nPerhaps Wulfila's right. Perhaps I should end this here, right now. Can you see yourself? Can you see your face? What do you see? You see a boy... or do you see a Caesar?\n\nRomulus Augustus:\n\nI see...\n\nOdoacer:\n\nTell me.\n\nRomulus Augustus:\n\nI see a Caesar. I *am* Caesar.\n\n[pause]\n\nOdoacer:\n\nWrong answer.\n\n[as the army leaves the village, Ygraine holds out a suit of armor to Romulus]\n\nYgraine:\n\nIt was made for my brother.\n\nRomulus Augustus:\n\nDoesn't he need it?\n\n[a tall, strapping teenager pats Ygraine as he walks past]\n\nYgraine:\n\n[smiles] He's grown since then."
