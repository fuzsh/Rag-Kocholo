        "text": "We offer you a glimpse of the experiences that your AAF/Air Force veteran had during the war. Using military service records, mission reports, individual flight logs, rosters, special orders, medical records, deceased personnel files, unit histories and other records at the National Archives, we can follow in the footsteps of individual WWII AAF/Air Force veterans to show you where they were and what they did during the war. This process is essential to understanding the experiences of individual WWII AAF/Air Force veterans who participated in aerial operations during WWII. Our unique and innovative research service is especially exciting since the vast majority of WWII AAF/Air force service records were lost in the 1973 National Archives fire. This process enables us to reconstruct the service history of your WWII AAF/Air Force veteran even if his service records were lost in the fire. With nearly a decade of experience in researching military records at the archival research facilities we have the experience that is needed to rebuild your WWII veteran’s service history. Contact us to start researching your WWII A.AF veteran today!\n\nOur expert research specialists are physically present at the archival research facilities which maintain the service records of your WWII AAF/Air Force veteran (as well as the records of his flight unit). We use a wide array of archival historical records to determine your veteran’s flight crew, the missions he flew, and medals he was awarded. We also locate the available unit operations reports for the exact missions your veteran flew, allowing you to see what happened each time your veteran was in the air (the level of combat detail will vary from unit to unit). Our comprehensive research service is a one of a kind process which we have exclusively developed for our clients. No other company, individual researcher, or government agency offers this process. When we have completed your research project we send an invoice to your email address. Once the invoice is paid the records are sent to your email address along with a short summary to help guide you through the records. Please fill out an order form below to begin researching your individual veteran today.\n\nThe total cost will depend on the scope of your research project. Because each WWII Air Force/AAF research project is different we ask that you give us specific details about your research needs so that we can present you with a plan for researching your individual WWII Air Force/AAF veteran and his unit. Once your inquiry is received we will respond promptly with a rough price estimate based on your exact research needs. Please fill out the order form below in order to receive a price quote for your WWII Air Force/AAF research project."
