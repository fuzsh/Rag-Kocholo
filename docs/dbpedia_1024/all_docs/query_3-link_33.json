This list was created using the public content located at B26.com, the content from the B-26 Martin Marauder Historical Society, and data from the United States Air Force Historical Research Agency.\n\nVerification of this list with records supplied by the United States Air Force and Royal Air Force is ongoing.\n\nContents:\n\nU.S. Army Air Corps U.S. Navy U.S. Marine Corps 5th Air Force\n\n8th Air Force\n\n9th Air Force\n\n11th Air Force\n\n12th Air Force\n\n13th Air Force\n\nUSAAF support units\n\nTow target squadrons Utility Squadrons\n\nPhotographic Squadron VMJ-1\n\nVMJ-2\n\nVMJ-3\n\nFrench Air Force â¢ Royal Air Force â¢ South African Air Force\n\nOther units â¢ References\n\n[edit] United States Army Air Corps/Army Air Forces\n\nFrom the date the first B-26 Marauder was shipped to the United States War Department in 1939, the B-26 began operation for the United States Army Air Corps. It would remain in operation for them until 20 June 1941 when it was renamed the Army Air Forces; it would operate for them until the end of World War II. During this period the B-26 Marauder and its many variants were operated by many units on many continents and serving in many different theaters of conflict. Amazingly the B-26 which had a poor reputation among pilots would end the war with the lowest casualty rating of any medium range bomber flown by these forces.\n\n[edit] Fifth Air Force\n\n[edit] 22nd Bomb Group\n\nReference Link: [1]\n\nLocation: US & SW Pacific\n\nBomb Squadrons:\n\n2d (1941-1943)\n\n19th (1941-1944)\n\n33d (1941-1943)\n\n408th (1941-1943)\n\nStations:\n\nMitchel Field, NY - 1 February 1940\n\nLanley Field, VA - 14 November 1940\n\nMuroc, Calif - 9 December 1941-31 January 1942\n\nBrisbane, Australia - 25 February 1942\n\nIpswich, Australia - 7 March 1942\n\nTownsville, Australia - 7 April 1942\n\nWoodstock, Australia - 5 July 1942\n\nIron Range, Australia - 29 September 1942\n\nWoodstock, Australia - 4 February 1943\n\nDobodura, New Guinea - Oct. 1943\n\nNadzab, New Guinea - Jan. 1944\n\nOwi, Schouten Islands - 17 August 1944\n\nLeyte - 15 November 1944\n\nAngaur - 26 November 1944\n\nSamar - 21 January 1945\n\nClark Field, Luzon - March 1945\n\nOkinawa - 15 August 1945\n\nLuzon - Nov. 1945\n\nDecorations:\n\nDistinguished Unit Citations: Papua (23 July 1942 - 23 January 1943) and New Guinea (5 November 1943)\n\nPhilippine Presidential Unit Citation\n\n[edit] Eighth Air Force\n\n[edit] 25th Bomb Group\n\nReference Link: [2][3]\n\nLocation: European Theater (OSS Reconnaissance Unit)\n\nBomb Squadrons:\n\n654th\n\nStations:\n\nStation 376, at RAF Watton, Norfolk, England - Apr '44 - Jul '45\n\nDecorations:\n\n[edit] Ninth Air Force\n\n[edit] First Pathfinder Squadron\n\nReference Link: [4]\n\nLocation: European Theater, England and France.
