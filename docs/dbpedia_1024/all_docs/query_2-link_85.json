        "text": "The USAAF was not destined to receive the B-24 until the Royal Air Force had received the first few production examples, owing to the urgency of the British need. Only one of the seven service-test YB-24s was ever delivered to the USAAC. The remaining six were diverted to Great Britain. The last YB-24 (serial number 40-702) ended up being delivered to the USAAF. It had armor and self-sealing fuel tanks and was accepted by the Army in May of 1941. The USAAC YB-24 was later redesignated simply B-24 and spent its entire career with the Army Air Corps Ferry Command Training School.\n\nThe USAAF took delivery of its first B-24As in June of 1941. Only nine B-24As were actually delivered, all between June 16 and July 10, 1941. The serials were 40-2369/2377. The remainder of the B-24As on the original order were either diverted to Britain or were converted on the assembly line to later variants such as the B-24C and B-24D. The B-24A was generally similar to the RAF's Liberator I, except for its armament of six 0.5-inch machine guns plus twin 0.3-inch guns in the tail.\n\nThese aircraft were used by the USAAC in much the same role as the RAF used the LB-30A--primarily as long-range transports. The Ferry Command B-24s were painted in the early RAF-style camouflage of dark earth and dark green over black undersides. However, during this immediate pre-war era, these planes carried large American flags painted on the sides of their forward fuselages and on the top of the fuselage, hopefully indicative of neutrality should they enter a combat zone. Two B-24As (40-2373 and 40-2374) were used to transport the Harriman Mission to Moscow in September of 1941 via the United Kingdom. The last leg of the flight to Moscow involved a nonstop distance of 3150 miles, and from Moscow one of the USAAC B-24As continued on around the globe via the Middle East, India, Singapore, Darwin, Port Moresby, Wake Island, Hawaii, and back to Washington. The other B-24A returned to the USA via Cairo, Africa, the South Atlantic, and Brazil.\n\nTwo other USAAF B-24As had been earmarked for a secret spy flight over Japanese bases in the South Pacific while enroute to the Philippines. However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor took place before this flight could be carried out. One of the B-24As (ser no 40-2371) earmarked for this flight was, in fact, destroyed on the ground at Hickham Field during the attack.\n\nThe Liberator II was the designation assigned to a version of the Liberator ordered for the RAF in 1941 directly from the Consolidated production line rather than being diverted from USAAC production orders. It was designed specifically for British requirements and had no direct USAAF counterpart. 165 were ordered under RAF serials AL503/AL667, but only 140 were actually built. They served with three Coastal and two Bomber Command squadrons. Immediatedly after Pearl Harbor, the USAAF requisitioned 75 of the Liberator IIs from the RAF order. For some reason, they were carried on USAAF rosters under the designation LB-30 (the original export designation for the Liberator) rather than as B-24, and they retained their RAF serial numbers.\n\nFifteen USAAF LB-30 bombers were deployed in Java in early 1942 to reinforce the B-17-equipped 19th Bombardment Group in a vain attempt to stem the Japanese advance. These USAAF LB-30s were hastily re-equipped with a Martin power turret armed with two 0.50-inch machine guns in the dorsal position behind the wing instead of the four-gun Boulton-Paul turret of the RAF version. The tail position was fitted with a pair of hand-held 0.50-inch machine guns mounted behind sliding doors. Single hand-held 0.50-inch machine guns were installed in the nose, ventral tunnel, and each waist position. The tunnel gun was located on the belly of the rear fuselage, and pointed in the aft direction. It was fired downward through the rear entrance hatch. Small scanning windows for the gun were located along the lower sides of the fuselage. The Dark Earth and Dark Green over Black camouflage scheme of the RAF was retained, but the roundels were painted over with USAAF insignia.\n\nThe Java-based LB-30s would be the first US-flown Liberators to see action. One was lost in a crash in the USA before delivery, another ditched en route, and a third was delayed as a result of damage incurred in an accident in the USA. Those Liberators which did reach the Java front participated in numerous attacks against Japanese targets in the Celebese, in Sumatra, and against shipping during the Japanese invasion of Bali. By late February, the position of Allied forces in Java had become untenable, and the surviving LB-30s were evacuated to Australia. Two LB-30s survived in Australia until 1944 after having been converted to C-87 transport configuration.\n\nAnother 17 LB-30s were equipped with Canadian-built radar and deployed to Latin America with the 6th Bombardment Group to provide defense for the Panama Canal. Three LB-30s were sent to Alaska to join the 28th Composite Group. These saw action against Japanese shipping during the Aleutian campaign.\n\nThose LB-30s that were not used as bombers were converted as transports and were assigned to the 7th Air Force in the Pacific and used to ferry men and supplies. All of their armament was removed, and the transparent nose and tail positions were faired over. Windows were cut into the sides of the fuselage, and a cargo door was installed in the rear fuselage where the waist positions used to be.\n\n46 of the requisitioned LB-30s saw active service with the USAAF, either as bombers or as transports. Of the remaining 29, six were lost in accidents during the first six weeks of their service, and 23 were eventually returned to the RAF.\n\nThe B-24C was the production breakdown aircraft used to finalize the production line for mass production of a fully-combat capable Liberator. The nine B-24Cs were delivered to the USAAF at the end of 1941. No B-24Cs were to see combat, all nine planes being used for crew training and various tests. They were redesignated RB-24C, where the R stood for \"restricted from combat use\". The B-24C was immediately followed off the line by the B-24D, the first fully combat-capable version.\n\nThe first B-24Ds to go abroad were the Liberators of the so-called Halverson Provisional Group (HALPRO), which consisted of 23 planes commanded by Col. Harry A. Halverson. The purpose of this group of picked aircrew was to begin bombing operations against Japan from bases in China in June of 1942. They were to fly to their Chinese bases by way of Africa, the Middle East, Iraq, and India. However, this force was held over in the Middle East to help defend against Rommel's advancing Afrika Korps. While there, the decision was made for the force to carry out a single raid against the Ploesti oil refineries in Rumania. Thirteen planes of the Halverson Detachment carried out the first Ploesti raid on June 11-12, 1942, which was also the first strategic attack of any significance of the war to be carried out by land-based aircraft of the USAAF. The Liberators took off from the RAF base at Fayid in Egypt and flew across the Mediterranean, Greece, and Bulgaria to reach Ploesti. Complete surprise was achieved, and the planes dropped their 4000-pound bombloads through cloud at 10,000 feet. Seven of the planes reached their intended base in Iraq, two landed in Syria, and four landed in Turkey, where they were interned. Unfortunately, the damage to Ploesti was minimal and the raid only succeeded in alerting the German High Command to the vulnerability of one of its primary fuel sources.\n\nThe Halverson Detachment never did reach China. After the first Ploesti raid, it remained in the Middle East to fight against Rommel, eventually being absorbed by the 1st Bomb Group in October of 1942.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable mission flown by the Liberator was the August 1, 1943 raid on the oil refineries at Ploesti in Rumania. For this mission, the 44th, 93rd and 389th Bombardment Groups of the 8th AF were sent to Libya to join two other B-24D-equipped groups of the 9th Air Force, the 98th and 376th. A total of 177 B-24Ds from these five groups were assembled for the mission. The Ploesti target was over a thousand miles from the USAAF bases at Bengazi. Each plane would carry 3100 US gallons of fuel and 5000 pounds of bombs and incendiaries. The mission plan called for the entire flight to be carried out at extremely low level (50-300 feet) in order to avoid detection. An extra nose gun was provided for each lead aircraft, and the dorsal turrets were slightly modified to make it easier to fire the guns at targets on the ground. The radio operator and flight engineers were even given Thompson sub-machine guns to fire out the the waist position windows. The commander of the mission, General Lewis Brereton (who had been General Douglas MacArthur's air chief in the Philippines), warned his airmen to expect losses of 50 percent!\n\nThe force of 179 B-24Ds took off on August 1, 1943. Things began to go bad right from the start. The plane carrying the lead navigator for the mission suddenly spiraled out of control and fell into the sea, and the backup navigator's aircraft had to abort because of mechanical problems. Weather over Greece was worse than expected and forced the Liberators to break up their tight defensive formations. The lead force made a wrong turn over an incorrect Initial Point, sending it toward Bucharest. This threw the entire plan off, and made the second wave late over the target, losing the element of surprise. The flak over Ploesti was heavy and accurate. The Liberators were so low that their gunners often got into duels with antiaircraft crews on the ground. Smoke and fire from the exploding refinery complex blackened and scorched many of the Liberators that flew through it. Luftwaffe Bf 109 and Rumanian IAR-80A fighters were now alerted and made numerous successful attacks.\n\nWhen it was all over, out of the original 179 B-24Ds that that had taken off, 14 had aborted, 43 had been shot down, 15 had been forced down at auxiliary fields, and eight had been forced to land in Turkey where they were interned. Only 99 had returned to base. Of these, 56 of them had some sort of major combat damage. Out of the seven refinery complexes targeted, two were heavily damage, two were put out of action for at least six months, two had only light damage, and one was not hit at all. Five Medals of Honor were awarded for heroism during the mission, three of them awarded posthumously.\n\nIt was to be in the Pacific Theatre where the Liberator was to be most widely used. The early LB-30s were replaced by the first B-24Ds to reach the Pacific in late 1942. By 1943, the Liberator had almost entirely replaced the B-17 Fortress as the primary long-range heavy bomber in the theatre. It reigned supreme in the Pacific until the arrival of the B-29 Superfortress in mid-1944."
