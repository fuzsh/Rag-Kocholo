        "text": "1. Why use this guide?\n\nUse this guide for advice on locating records at The National Archives of Royal Air Force (RAF) operations. These records cover operations that have taken place since the RAF’s formation in 1918. The guide also covers airborne operations that took place prior to 1918, carried out by the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. Our most recent operational records are around 30 years old.\n\nThis is not a guide to personnel records, though some of the records covered do shed light on the service of RAF airmen and officers. If you are looking for the service records of specific individuals, you should consult our guides to Royal Flying Corps airmen or officers, Royal Naval Air Service ratings or officers, Royal Air Force personnel or Women’s Royal Air Force personnel.\n\nFor guidance on records of aircraft production, see our Research and development in the Royal Air Force guide. For advice on searching for photographs of Royal Air Force operations, installations and aircraft consult our Photographs guide and Roy Conyers Nesbit’s The RAF in Camera 1939-1945, which includes advice on records held at the Public Record Office, which became The National Archives.\n\n2. The Royal Air Force, its predecessors, administration and structure\n\nThe Royal Air Force (RAF) was not created until the last year of the First World War. It was formed on 1 April 1918 with the merger of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), which had been the airborne operations branch of the British Army, and the Royal Naval Air Service, the air arm of the Royal Navy. In April 1918 the RFC and RNAS ceased to exist.\n\nThe RAF was administered by the Air Ministry from 1918 to 1964, and then by the Ministry of Defence. Prior to the formation of the RAF and the Air Ministry in 1918, military aviation had been organised haphazardly, falling under the jurisdiction of a series of short-lived bodies:\n\nThe Air Committee, from April 1912\n\nThe Joint War Air Committee, from February 1916\n\nThe Air Board, from May 1916\n\n2.2 Command structure of the RAF\n\nThe command structure of the RAF has varied since its creation, sometimes changing and often becoming more complicated during prolonged conflict. The basic structure is based on the following hierarchy, in ascending order from the smallest unit:\n\nSquadrons\n\nWings\n\nStations\n\nGroups\n\nCommands (Second World War)\n\nHeadquarters\n\nAs with all branches of the military, the chain of command extended up, ultimately, to the Cabinet and, at times of war, War Cabinets.\n\n2.3 Command structure of the RFC\n\nThe RFC, a branch of the British Army, was structured along different lines to the RAF. The hierarchy, in ascending order, was as follows:\n\nSquadrons\n\nWings\n\nBrigades\n\nStations\n\nDivisions\n\n3. An introduction to the records and to locating them\n\nThe records of The National Archives are divided into departments, each known by a letter code. The records of the RAF are held in the AIR department. You can find related records in WO, ADM, DEFE and CAB.\n\nMost of the records covered in this guide are not available online so to see them you will either need to visit us in Kew, where you can look at records for free, or order copies of documents to be sent to you for a fee. There are some records available to download online – details are in section 8.1.\n\n3.1 Determining your search parameters\n\nAlmost all searches for records at The National Archives begin in our catalogue. Using the catalogue, you can search across our entire collection, across a whole department or within a specific record series.\n\nTo search our entire collection use our catalogue homepage from where you can use keywords to search for records, unrestricted by dates or departments. To search all AIR files, or the files of any other department, use the advanced search to specify the department code in the ‘references’ boxes. To search any of the record series listed in this guide, click on the series reference to be directed to the search page for that series – from there you can search by keywords and dates or browse through the whole series.\n\n3.2 Choosing keywords\n\nTo search for records in any of these ways you will need to experiment with keywords. Your goal is to find keywords which appear in the catalogue description of the documents you seek. For RAF operations records, among the most fruitful sets of keywords are unit numbers, especially squadron numbers. When searching with unit numbers, avoid ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on). For example, search for 32 Squadron, not 32nd Squadron; for 4 Brigade, not 4th Brigade and so on.\n\nFor First World War records it may help to specify that you are interested only in squadron or other unit records of either the RAF, the RFC or the RNAS. You can try ‘Royal Air Force’, ‘Royal Flying Corps’ and ‘Royal Naval Air Service’ as search terms but it is more common for their abbreviations to be used. Try the following variations:\n\nRAF or R.A.F\n\nRFC or R.F.C.\n\nRNAS or R.N.A.S.\n\nTo identify some squadron records search only with the number, omitting RAF, RFC and RNAS (and their variations) altogether.\n\nOther keywords worth trying include:\n\n‘operation’\n\nthe name of an operation, such as ‘Operation Neptune’\n\n‘mission’\n\nthe location of operations, such as ‘Greece’, ‘Atlantic’ or ‘North Africa’\n\n4. Tracing the life of a unit: Operations Record Books\n\nFor close-up detail of operations the records to start with are usually the Operations Record Books (ORBs). ORBs were kept at almost every level of the air force pyramid, from squadrons to commands. They are records of daily events kept by the units themselves and, for records of RAF squadrons as well as other units, likely to be the most revealing documents available. However, the accuracy and detail entered within each book depends on the compiler and unit.\n\nThey comprise:\n\n‘summary of events’ forms (Form 540)\n\n‘detail of work carried out’ forms (Form 541)\n\nappendices where applicable (which may include operational orders, miscellaneous reports and telegraphed messages)\n\nClick on the record series references in the table below to search for the ORBs of a unit by name or number:\n\nOperations Record Books of… Record series Commands AIR 24 Groups AIR 25 Wings AIR 26 Squadrons AIR 27 Stations AIR 28 Miscellaneous units AIR 29 Directorate of plans, 1939-1942 AIR 9/445-454\n\nThese series also include the ORBs of allied and dominion air forces serving under British command.\n\nIn the absence of a service record (RAF service records remain in the custody of the Ministry of Defence and are accessible only to the service personnel themselves or their next of kin), or perhaps to supplement one, ORBs can prove very revealing. They sometimes include nominal rolls, lists of officers and details of promotions, transfers or awards.\n\n5. Crashes, casualties and combat reports\n\nSome of the First World War, Second World War and interwar record series listed in subsequent sections of this guide contain details of crashes and casualties.\n\nUse the advanced search of our catalogue to search the entire AIR department using keywords such as ‘crash’, ‘crash report’ or ‘accident report’ and a year or year range. Alternatively, and to target your search to specific record series, try the following:\n\ncombat reports for the Second World War in AIR 50\n\ncombat reports for First World War in AIR 1 – search with the number of the squadron and the keywords ‘combat report’\n\noperations record books in AIR 27 for crashes during operations – details may be very brief, such as ‘the aircraft failed to return’\n\noperations record books in AIR 28 for crashes recorded by RAF stations\n\naccident reports in AVIA 5 which covers some military crashes as well as civil aviation crashes – search by aircraft and/or location of crash\n\nenquiries into casualties suffered during air operations and aircraft accidents, 1939-1945 in AIR 81\n\ncourts of inquiry records in the AIR department (only a few of these survive at The National Archives) – use the advanced search to search AIR using ‘court of inquiry’ as your search term\n\nYou can also consult accident record cards, available in other archives (see section 12)."
