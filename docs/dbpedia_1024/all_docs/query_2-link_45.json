        "text": "It takes about 120 airplanes to keep a group going and we couldn't get any replacements. Only 500 were made in the beginning. There was a training group in Baton Rouge LA, a group in Burma (The only other A-36 user was the 311th Fighter Bomber Group, based in India.) and two groups in Italy. We were losing planes for one reason or another and we and our sister group, the 86th were down to around 60 planes each. It was getting increasingly difficult to operate. So someone came up with a great idea. The two group commanders would flip a coin and the winner would get all the airplanes. We lost.\n\nHaving flown P-40's in the States, I was one of the pilots that were taken to various dumps around Italy picking up war-weary P-40's and bringing them back home!\n\nMy P-40 had a scorpion painted on it, left over we believe from one of the squadrons of the 33rd Fighter Group ( actually was 57th FG USAAF, 64th (Black Scorpions) FS, ). We didn't paint any of our planes because they were temporary. An exception of course was mine with the name Patty B II painted on it. She was the girl I was stuck on in high school, and I believe was the only one that wrote me a couple letters while I was overseas. It was our way of hanging on to things back home.\n\nBegan operations with Twelfth AF in Jun 1943 and served in the Mediterranean theater until the end of the war.\n\nRedesignated 27th Fighter-Bomber Group in Aug 1943, and 17th Fighter Group in May 1944.\n\nMaintenance and support personnel went by sea to North Africa while aircrews and the A-20s flew to South America then across to North Africa, In North Africa, the A-20s were sent to other groups and the 27th Bomb Group was redesignated as the 27th Fighter-Bomber Group and reequipped with the North American A-36 Invader dive bomber. Assigned to Korba, Tunisia, the 27th FBG flew its first combat missions of the war on June 6, 1943.\n\nThe 27th served in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) until the end of the war. It was redesignated the 27th Fighter Group in May 1944 when the group converted first to the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, then to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft.\n\nParticipated in the reduction of Pantelleria and Lampedusa. Supported ground forces during the conquest of Sicily.\n\nCovered the landings at Salerno and received a DUC for preventing three German armored divisions from reaching the Salerno beachhead, 10 Sep 1943.\n\nSupported Fifth Army during the Allied drive toward Rome.\n\nTook part in the invasion Southern France and assisted Seventh Army's advance up the Rhone Valley, receiving a DUC for helping to disrupt the German retreat, 4 Sep 1944.\n\nTook part in the interdiction of the enemy's communications in northern Italy, and assisted in the Allied drive from France into Germany during the last months of the war."
