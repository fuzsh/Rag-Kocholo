        "text": "Abstract\n\nAs constitutional texts are incomplete guides to actual practice, the ‘complete’ constitution will not be captured by a court-centric focus on texts and contested judicial interpretations. This article applies a positivist version of realism to interrogate the phenomena of ‘soft constitutional law’ (SCL), one aspect of the small ‘c’ constitution. SCL may be described as nonbinding, deliberately created constitutionally significant norms which have some legal effect in ordering constitutional relationships. It shapes generic constitutionalism in regulating public power, securing a polity's fundamental values and reinforcing its national identity. ‘SCL’ is not unique to Asian nonliberal democracies, as the role of declaratory conventions in the UK or of soft congressional resolutions in presidential systems attests. Nonetheless, it is argued that SCL plays a distinctive function in these contexts, driven by a strong state with a powerful executive branch and relatively weak constitutional review. Negatively, SCL may subvert liberal constitutionalism as a tool for consolidating state powers and curtailing political freedoms in service of the public interest. Positively, it may serve the good of cultivating social solidarity by promoting values in aid of ‘constitutional patriotism’ to cohere racially and religiously divided societies whose communities lack a shared history. This article examines how the analysis and category of SCL, created and interpreted primarily by nonjudicial actors, illumines the constitutional cultures of Asian nonliberal democracies, while raising questions of legitimacy and desirability that occupy normative constitutionalism.\n\n1. Introduction: Constitutional realism and the expanded province of constitutional law\n\nConstitutions—as fundamental instruments giving “special visibility, legitimacy and stability to the shared framework of political life”1—entrench basic values, structure power, and confer rights; their practical import as living documents turns on how they are “used, interpreted and implemented.”2 Texts alone are “incomplete guides to actual practice”;3 the truly complete constitution will not be captured by a court-centric focus on the constitutional text and contested theories of judicial interpretation, which renders the study of constitutional law nearly synonymous with the law of a supreme court, often accompanied by the rights-oriented predilection characterizing many Western liberal democracies.\n\nWhile generating much comparative constitutional law scholarship, the focus on rights-oriented, judicially enforceable constitutionalism is inapt in jurisdictions where the apex court plays a relatively marginal role in constitutional politics, as reflected in a modest case load and judicial deference to executive assessments of what the public interest requires.4 This is so even if courts are empowered to strike down unconstitutional legislation, after the Marbury v. Madison model.5 Where most constitutional practice resides in the interaction of the political branches, as where justiciable rights are not litigated but canvassed before Parliament,6 courts do not play a primary role in shaping constitutional understandings. Beyond the documentary text7 and its judicial exegesis, the small “c” constitution8 must be examined, which includes the unwritten constitution, encompassing norms lacking the status of formal law which “affect the behaviour of agents,”9 located in constitutionally significant statutes, international law, judicially declared norms and customs.\n\nA constitutionalism-beyond–the-courts approach examines the practices of both judicial and nonjudicial actors in vindicating or undermining generic constitutionalism, that is, regulating public power and securing a polity's fundamental values. In Westminster-based parliamentary democracies, atextual or unwritten constitutional practice includes constitutional conventions, a product of gradual, unconscious evolution. This is distinct from the category of “soft constitutional law” (SCL), which may be described as deliberately created, constitutionally significant norms that are not legally binding but have some legal effect in ordering constitutional relationships. Although not unique to nonliberal democracies (NLD) that mix “elections and authoritarianism,”10 as there is scholarship on SCL in Anglo-American constitutional contexts, it is argued that SCL plays distinctive functions in NLDs, driven by a strong state with a powerful executive branch.\n\nThe idea of SCL flows from a brand of constitutional realism that rejects the binary law/nonlaw structure upon which a purely formalist approach is predicated. Rather than focusing on rules of recognition to ascertain if a norm is part of the canonical text, “[c]onstitutions are best understood through a realist's lens,”11 to avoid the occultation of constitutional realities, as the ‘complete constitution may be located in the “structures, processes, principles, rules, conventions and even culture” constituting “the generic ways in which public power is exercised.”12 Thus, constitutional meaning is derived from “the iterative interaction of theoretical principles with the reality of human beliefs and behaviours.”13\n\nIn investigating both the “political”14 and legal constitution,15 rich legal-realist insights on how countries are actually ruled may be drawn from Karl Llewellyn's study of the U.S. Constitution as an “Institution.”16 His “intelligent reconstruction” of constitutional law theory rejects the idea that “rules decide cases”; it postulates that a living institution is “in first instance a set of ways of living and doing. It is not, in first instance, a matter of words or rules.”17 The “working Constitution” is, thus, “in good part utterly extra-Documentary,”18 flowing from “the actions, understandings and inter-relationships of those who operate it.”19 Without wholly embracing J. A. G. Griffiths's view that “laws are merely statements of a power relationship” such that “the constitution is no more and no less than what happens,”20 his perspective underscores “the realism of the continuing importance of beliefs and behaviour”21 in defining a constitution.\n\nThe use of deliberately created SCL norms is “institutionalized” insofar as human beings are “norm-users” and that “regard for norms leads people into patterns of behaviour.”22 Brian Tamanaha notes that the varied phenomena attracting the label “law” “all lay claim to legitimate authority, to rightful power.”23 Existing in the twilight zone between law and politics, SCL must have some source of authoritativeness distinguishing it from ‘nonlaw.’\n\nThis article applies a “positivist version of realism”24 in order to examine the role SCL plays in nonliberal Asian constitutional democracies in shaping institutional interaction and the social compact between the government and citizens. It shares empirical constitutionalism's concern with the practical operation of the constitutional order, although this implicates conceptual issues, such as the nature, function, and role of constitutions within political orders. Additionally, the function and effects of SCL, created and interpreted primarily by nonjudicial actors, raise questions of legitimacy and desirability that occupy normative constitutionalism.\n\nSection 2 considers the concept of soft law in general and SCL in particular. Conceptualizing a more fluid vision of law along a continuum of bindingness or legal effect inevitably produces doctrinal fuzziness in the attempt to distinguish soft law and nonlaw. What SCL forsakes in terms of conceptual clarity, it gains in terms of capturing constitutional realities accurately. To take SCL seriously, it is important to map the concept so as to identify it when we see it. This section examines the forms SCL takes and their role in Western liberal democracies. Section 3 examines the form and role SCL assumes in Asian nonliberal democracies like Singapore and Malaysia, where constitutional politics is shaped by relatively weak forms of constitutional review in the face of strong executive governments. It examines whether and how SCL plays a distinct role in NLDs and evaluates whether SCL serves the ends of constitutionalism and good governance in nonliberal Asian democracies. Negatively, SCL in its form and deployment may subvert liberal constitutionalism by providing another tool for politically authoritarian governments to consolidate state power and entrench illiberal rule by curtailing political freedoms in the service of social harmony and cultural norms. Positively, SCL may serve the good of cultivating social solidarity by promoting constitutional patriotism and the love of patria in a nonexclusive fashion, to cohere racially and religiously divided societies, whose communities lack a shared history. This is sought through efforts to realize economic equity and sustainable development as social-compact norms, with a putative constitutional basis, or by articulating and nurturing a responsibilities-oriented approach toward securing human welfare. Section 4 concludes with reflections on how the analysis and category of SCL illuminates the nature of nonliberal democracies and their constitutional cultures.\n\n2. Mapping the field: The nature of soft law and of soft constitutional law\n\n2.1. Soft law\n\nAlthough ‘soft law’ is not a new phenomena in international law25 or private law,26 the idea has “taken the legal academy by storm.”27 Soft law differs from hard law, which constitutes legal obligations created by a formal legal process, in not being legally binding. Soft law may be defined as “those regulatory instruments and mechanisms of governance” implicating “some kind of normative commitment” independent of “binding rules or on a regime of formal sanctions.”28\n\nJudicial bodies empowered to order remedies enforce breaches of hard-law norms; soft-law norms function, on the other hand, more as moral-political obligations, where compliance is induced through persuasion, peer pressure, or other incentives rather than legal sanctions. Though not formally enforceable, soft-law norms are legally relevant and may acquire a degree of bindingness by dint of self- or co-regulation or through background legal support, such as where administrative guidelines are subject to judicial review.29 So conceived, soft law promotes “facilitation of expectation,” influencing social behavior through exhortation or excoriation, having some predictive force, distinct from ‘law as command.’30 It carries the virtue of flexible adaptability to novel situations and avoids the political costs associated with formal legislation or of being perceived as a power-accumulating measure, although it raises problems of legitimacy and certainty.\n\nSoft international law is a means of regulating international actors within a decentralized legal system that has no authoritative general arbiter of international norms outside certain regional31 and rules-based regimes. Some consider this a flexible tool to promote harmonization within regional orders, which are faster to negotiate and may be a prelude to hard law if subsequently adopted by treaty or if it solidifies into customary international law. Such expectations may not exist in domestic contexts.\n\nWithin public law, soft law may be understood as “a descriptive umbrella for non-binding instruments” such as circulars, codes of conducts, and white papers containing recommendations or hortatory, programmatic statements.32\n\n2.2. Soft constitutional law\n\nA definition, in marking out a field, both “excludes and includes.” 33 To interrogate the phenomenon of SCL entails delimiting the province of constitutional law beyond the rules enacted in accordance with constitutional formalities. Here, softness does not refer to the precise formulation of obligations34 but to the form or instrument containing the SCL norm. Although SCL may assume many forms, it must have certain unifying features as an analytic tool distinct from transient politics and policy as well as from command-and-control–based hard law. Following Llewellyn, rather than attempting a bounded definition, the focus or “point of reference” 35 is “what goes into the idea of law rather than what is kept out of it.” 36\n\nA working description of SCL norms are non-legally binding standards articulated and ‘written down’ by authoritative government actors, usually the executive branch,37 which exerts some weight in enhancing the credibility of SCL norms in popular perception. SCL norms are distinct from customs and conventions as products of rationalist deliberation rather than organic evolution. Nonetheless, their written quality means SCL norms have undergone some degree of formalisation in their creation and record. To shape the behaviour and expectations of constitutional actors in a constitutionally significant manner, SCL norms must be generally applicable,38 reasonably clear, known and accessible.\n\nLlewellyn prescribed two threshold criteria for identifying constitutional practice: first, the continuing existence of a practice considered to be important; if a norm is known and able to guide behavior, and if the relevant actors abide by it, “then in their perception” the norm exists39 and shapes constitutional behavior. Second, the practice must serve a constitutional function.40 SCL norms are distinct from policy or administrative quasi law, such as ministerial circulars, as they affect the scope of constitutional powers and liberties and are not justiciable.41\n\nA functions-oriented approach toward studying constitutions divides the constitutive from the entrenchment function of written constitutions. SCL norms play various expressive and regulatory functions we correlate with conventional constitutions, in regulating or allocating powers and duties among various government bodies and defining their relationship with the public.42 SCL norms may guide the interpretation of existing legislation and identify and promote the realization of objectives through hortatory instruments expressing (preferred or shared) normative commitments and urging cooperation. There appear to be similar functions SCL can perform across constitutional orders as well as functions apparently unique to Asian illiberal states, which are discussed below.\n\n2.3. Soft constitutional law in comparative perspective\n\nWithin Western liberal democracies, academic inquiry has identified SCL in the form of “declaratory conventions” in the United Kingdom and nonbinding congressional resolutions in the United States. In the U.K., the author of SCL is the parliamentary executive or cabinet, which is fused with and controls Parliament through the party system, as opposed to the strict institutional separation of the U.S. Congress from the presidency; in the U.S., SCL emanates from the political branches. These play various roles, including redistributing powers or attempts to influence legislative agendas.\n\n2.3.1. U.K.: Distinguishing SCL and constitutional conventions\n\nThe ongoing process of constitutional reform in the U.K. has given rise to what has been described as a new kind of declaratory or written convention created by deliberate process; this is distinct from the traditional understanding of conventions as unwritten principles of political morality produced by unconscious organic evolution (“evolved conventions”) and modified by practice. Aileen McHarg argues that declaratory conventions, seeking to shape constitutional behavior rather than generate legally binding rules, are “more helpfully described” as a species of “constitutional ‘soft law’,” unless accompanied by “consistent and reasonably persistent constitutional practice.”43 Traditionally, evolved conventions are rules not formally recognized as such that “develop around most constitutions”44 and are “partly non-legal or extra-legal,”45 forming part of the architecture of political accountability. The gradual process by which these are formed, adapted, and deleted reflect “a continuing process which allows the Executive to determine what the constitution is.”46 While not judicially enforceable,47 these general social rules—as opposed to mere habit—are to be followed, on pain of criticism and pressures to conform.48 They “fill in the interstices”49 of the government framework, representing an “alignment of normative understanding between political and legal systems.”50 The lack of a deliberate legislative moment and of an authoritative tribunal to determine their existence and content renders it difficult to ascertain when a practice becomes a convention.\n\nIn the U.K., the turn towards the legal constitution through increasing juridification has been accompanied by “soft law regulation,”51 which takes the form of new political practices codified in documents such as devolution concordats.52 Unlike evolved conventions, which embody practical wisdom, these declaratory conventions—as a form of SCL— have a ‘legislative moment’ in that they were consciously created. Devolution concordats, as a type of intergovernmental agreements, record settlements on power divisions between the central government and the devolved administrations. These soft law instruments compose part of the “working constitution”53 and “tend to be negotiated, drafted and implemented by civil servants as if they were binding.”54 Thus, for example, after rejecting the option of legislation, the drafters of the green paper on the Governance of Britain55 suggested adopting a parliamentary convention, to be formalized by a resolution;56 this would require the government to obtain parliamentary consent before deploying armed forces into conflict.\n\nAttempts to characterize such novel practices as conventions raise the question whether conventions may derive their authority from the fact of their deliberate creation through declaration,57 regardless of past or future practice. Joseph Jaconelli argues such “anticipatory” conventions are not fully realized, since their obligatory nature is derived from “a system of reciprocal acts and forbearances.”58 By characterizing declaratory conventions as SCL, conventions are placed “on a continuum with other non-legal techniques for regulating government behaviour.”59\n\nMcHarg notes that the failure “adequately to differentiate between formal and functional approaches to the definition of law”60 confuses attempts to distinguish law from convention. Obsessing over “sterile” definitional questions should be eschewed and attention turned to the “functional characteristics” shared by law and convention as methods of “regulating constitutional behaviour,” which beg “legitimacy questions” over “why soft law techniques should be preferred to hard.”61 A more fruitful approach is to apply regulatory analysis to assess the use of hard and soft law in constitutional reform, rather than straitjacketing the discussion between the competing virtues of certainty and flexibility, which law and convention respectively boast.\n\nThe resort by the parliamentary executive to this form of SCL raises concerns that this method of executive norm production evades legislative scrutiny and the formal legislative process, muting transparency and accountability. Thus, SCL may empower rather than constrain government, as efficiency's handmaiden.\n\n2.3.2. Soft constitutional law in the United States\n\nSCL in the U.S. is created by both the president and Congress, ranging from presidential signing statements purporting to interpret the bills they accompany, to hortatory statutes and soft congressional resolutions containing rules issued by a law-making authority, which do “not comply with constitutional and other formalities … necessary for the rule to be legally-binding.”62\n\nThe function of such nonjusticiable soft resolutions, from one or both legislative houses, is to communicate policy views and preferences to the president and the public, thus serving as an indication of a possible future legislative agenda. Soft law may anticipate hard law, which might change how people behave, motivating the adoption of voluntary codes of conduct.63 Congressional views as informative signals might shape people's views of the world or be incorporated as inputs in the executive or judicial decision-making process.64 Jacob Gersen and Eric Posner give the example of a congressional resolution65 expressing the view that U.S. involvement in Iraq should not deepen, indicating, to the President, waning support for U.S. intervention. Further, if Congress is able through a soft statute to intimate to the president its budgetary priorities, this could be factored into the budget-making process so as to avoid a future impasse.66 Such SCL serves as a mode of persuasive conversation between the political branches.\n\nArguably, the creation of SCL by U.S. political agents is a method of circumventing the article V amendment process,67 realigning power from the legislative to executive branch. Further, many contested exercises of executive and legislative power expressed through presidential veto speeches and messages to Congress, as well as opposing congressional resolutions and speeches, are “ultimately determined by non-judicial precedent” as the courts remain aloof. This reveals the “enormous soft law component of the separation of powers.”68\n\n2.4. Conclusion: SCL in Western liberal democracies\n\nThis brief analysis of SCL in the U.K. and U.S. liberal democracies reveals the concern that the executive's resort to SCL may be an attempt to elude restraints on political power; this is accomplished by circumventing parliamentary scrutiny in the U.K. and by avoiding formal legal processes, such as constitution amendment procedures, in the U.S. SCL in these contexts is primarily directed at institutional interactions or influencing the general legislative processes. In NLDs, SCL plays the additional role of regulating state–citizen relationships and promoting a national identity through a form of constitutional patriotism in aid of nonliberal or communitarian democratic values in racially and religiously divided societies.\n\n3. Soft constitutional law in nonliberal Asian democracies\n\n3.1. SCL in nonliberal strong states\n\nInstitutional design, political history, and sociocultural context affect how a constitution works. Similarly, the operation of SCL as a guideline or ordering tool is shaped by its particular context. Within a regional order, soft law emanating from a range of state and nonstate actors provides a site for pluralistic participation and the harmonizing of varied interests, such as promoting market integration and social protection in the European context.\n\nDomestically, the legal culture and political system shapes the role of SCL. In the paradigmatic Western liberal democratic state, based on separated powers and the rule of law, governors are elected through competitive, multiparty elections. In brief, the liberal state aspires to neutrality69 in emphasizing freedom to pursue individualized conceptions of the good life. This is buttressed by the protection of basic civil-political liberties and a focus not on the “accumulation of power” but the “division of power.”70 Thus, liberal constitutionalism “restricts the state to make possible the unrestricted individual,” with the state lacking a thick normative orientation.71\n\nConversely, in nonliberal Asian democracies like Singapore and Malaysia, where cabinet government is dominant and effectively controls both parliament and the legislative agenda, SCL assumes a different complexion; there is no need to adopt SCL as a precursor to hard law nor is there space for parliament to adopt SCL norms to dialogue with cabinet government. SCL does not arise from a plurality of sources but emanates from a vertical power structure flowing down from a parliamentary executive wielding the popular mandate through regular, formally free elections. Both countries imported the Westminster model of parliamentary government and political constitutionalism, where elections rather than legal processes are the principal forms of political accountability. Courts play a marginal role in constitutional politics, despite being empowered to strike down unconstitutional legislation,72 and are reluctant to intervene in matters deemed politically sensitive by a powerful executive, even where fundamental rights are implicated. Infused with statist or communitarian values, judicial review is a weak check on power.\n\nPolitical liberalization has not yet accompanied economic modernization after the Western liberal democratic model such that there is no need for the executive to resort to SCL to bypass amendment formalities or avoid legislative scrutiny in determining what the constitution means. Aside from negotiating interinstitutional rules of engagement through flexible, nonbinding standards, SCL has been used to flesh out the social, political, and economic terms of the social compact arguably founded on open-ended constitutional provisions or implicit principles. SCL regulates aspects of social life placed beyond legal regulation, such as the rules of engagement for religion and politics in the public square, where executive-declared ground rules govern the content of localized understandings of constitutional secularism and shape the scope of individual liberties.\n\nOf particular note are two SCL instruments containing declarations of national philosophy, whose principles continue to frame and justify core national policies.\n\n3.1.1. Malaysia's Rukunegara declaration of 1971\n\nIn 1971, Malaysia's Rukunegara73 (“National Principles”) was adopted by royal proclamation. It was drafted by the government-created National Consultative Committee, which co-opted representatives from various ethnic communities, in response to the traumatic race riots of May 13, 1969, which left “in tatters”74 the social contract for a multiracial Malaysia. Its chief purpose was to promote nation building through programs that would unify a society of “diverse races, religions and cultures,” fragmented along the lines of the dominant indigenous Malay community who were primarily Muslim and the immigrant Chinese and Indian minority groups, affirming that the “task of national consolidation” was “the responsibility of every one.”\n\nThe Rukunegara set out “certain principles” evolving from a “common history” that were “enshrined in our Constitution” and “acceptable” and “applicable” to all; these principles would “serve as the nexus which will bind us together.” The declaration contained five objectives: to secure “a greater unity of all her peoples,” to maintain “a democratic way of life,” to create “a just society in which the wealth of the nation shall be equitably shared,” to ensure a “liberal approach to her rich and diverse cultural traditions,” and to build a “progressive society” based on modern science and technology. The pursuit of these ends were to be guided by five principles: (1) belief in God, (2) loyalty to king and country, (3) upholding the constitution, (4) rule of law, and (5) good behavior and morality.\n\nNotably the idea of distributive economic justice based on a “just society,” where wealth is “equitably shared,” is the rationale and justification for the National Economic Policy (NEP). The NEP is a race-based affirmative action program which arguably exceeds the constitutional recognition of special privileges for Malays and other natives, in the form of reserved public sector jobs, scholarships, and business licenses. The NEP sought to uplift economically disadvantaged Malays and natives to ensure parity with other ethnic communities, particularly, the economically dominant Chinese immigrant community; its subsequent incarnations have received some judicial support75 and defined the practice of certain government agencies; it is discussed below as a manifestation of SCL.\n\n3.1.2. Singapore's shared values\n\nThe government-authored shared-values white paper was debated in parliament and adopted in 1991 as a “national ideology,” an attempt to constitute a “coherent Singaporean identity”76 distinct from Western societies, which manifested a more “individualistic and self-centred outlook on life,” contrary to “[t]raditional Asian ideas of morality, duty and society.”77 While positive “values from European and American civilizations,”78 such as parliamentary democracy and the rule of law, had been adopted, the negative influence of Western individualism was to be countered by inculcating “a few key values” shared by all major religious and cultural groups, since proposals conflicting with “the teachings of Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Taoism or Buddhism”79 were unlikely to gain general acceptance.\n\nThe five shared values are (1) “Nation before community and society above self,” (2) family as the basic unit of society, (3) regard and community support for the individual, (4) consensus instead of contention, and (5) racial and religious harmony. The ideology did not merely reflect but was meant to constitute the culture by reinforcing communitarian or neo-Confucian values in order to arrest excessive individualism. This was to be achieved through prioritizing community concerns over individual rights in the interests of social cohesion. Notably, in rejecting the Madisonian distrust of human nature and the view that governors should “always be treated with suspicion unless proven otherwise,” the white paper heralded the Confucian ideal of the concept of “government by honourable men [junzi] … who have a duty to do right for the people, and who have the trust and respect of the population.”80 It also emphasizes having the “right political values,” including “high standards of personal and public conduct” among political leaders.81\n\nThis view of governors as honorable gentleman with internalized standards of moral integrity appears to have influenced the judiciary in shaping the normative assumptions underlying the law on political defamation. The courts, in defining the scope of free speech, have not accepted the concept of the public figure who is subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than a private individual.82 Instead, one's status as a “prominent public figure” translates into higher damages, as in Goh Chok Tong v. Chee Soon Juan (no. 2),83 where an opposition politician libeled a former prime minister in alleging mismanagement of national funds. The robust judicial protection of high ministerial office resides in the premium given to their good reputation, as false allegations would undermine their personal lives, public reputations, and the extent to which they sustain public trust. Justice Ang in Lee Hsien Loong v. Singapore Democratic Party84 considered that without public vindication, lasting damage would redound “on their political reputation and their moral authority as leaders.”85 She approved the observations of the Greek rhetorician Isocrates that an individual's good reputation—his character—was of utmost importance to his personal and professional life “for human proclivity is such that people are apt to listen to those whom they trust.”86 This accords with the government perspective that Singaporeans expect a government leader to be a “Confucian gentleman,” “a superior man … of ability and integrity who can set things right and ensure good government.”87 Prime Minister Goh noted in court that as junzi, government leaders would defend their integrity when impugned.88\n\nArguably, the white paper has functioned as “a quasi-Constitutional hermeneutical tool”89 insofar as its communitarian orientation has been judicially endorsed and applied.90 The white paper as SCL—framing the interpretive matrix through which the balance between competing rights and public goods are struck—helps make sense of the contemporary adjudicatory approach toward fundamental liberties. Despite the Privy Council's exhortation to give a “generous interpretation” to ensure individuals enjoyed the “full measure” of their fundamental rights in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor,91 a decision from Singapore, one may argue that the parsimony in treating rights as defeasible interests, rather than as trumps, is motivated by communitarian values which prioritize community goods like public order. For example, the blanket ban on the religious publications of the Jehovah's Witnesses, an organization which opposes military service, was unsuccessfully challenged in Colin Chan v. Public Prosecutor.92 Religious freedom was trumped by unwritten statist values where Chief Justice Yong declared that the “sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore” as “the paramount mandate of the Constitution” such that anything, including rights of religious freedom, “which tend to run counter to these objectives must be restrained.”93 The High Court subsequently reiterated this mantra in Nappalli v. Institute of Technical Education94 to justify dismissing a teacher who refused to take the national pledge or salute the flag during school assembly because this violated his faith as a Jehovah's Witness. This was treated as an implied contractual breach, with Justice Tan observing that Singapore's success lay in maintaining the unity of its multiracial and religious population which entitled the government to take reasonable steps to ensure that future generations understood the importance of preserving “the sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore.”95 Thus, the defense of the nation, whether through prohibiting conscientious objections to compulsory military service or dismissing teachers who refused to participate in “idolatrous” flag ceremonies, trumped the individual's religious freedom, reflecting a weak rights culture.\n\nIn addition, potentially justiciable rights may never be litigated owing to government preferences to resolve things by dialogue96 rather than rights claims,97 which breeds adversarialism and individualism, contrary to the shared value of “consensus instead of contention.” Indeed, this spills over into an anti-institutionalism and government reticence regarding the creation of dedicated rights-protective bodies like an ombudsman, insofar as rights are seen to imperil social harmony.98 Instead, the government encourages aggrieved citizens, such as a pregnant woman facing workplace discrimination, to seek redress through petitioning ad hoc channels like their parliamentary representative or government ministries. This piecemeal rather than permanent remedial route positions the citizen as a petitioner seeking his member of parliament's intervention, rather than as a voter to whom the MP must account.\n\nThis reluctance to create dedicated complaint mechanisms to enforce laws, for fear of a litigious culture, is evident in the government's preference to give domestic effect to treaties—such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 100 on Equal Remuneration—through the soft or informal nonbinding standards contained in the Tripartite Declarations between the government, labor, and employers. These norms are not enforced by tribunals or courts but are “promoted”99 by education and encouraging the adoption of equal remuneration clauses in collective agreements.100 Theoretically, workplace discrimination would contravene the constitutional equal protection clause, even though gender-based discrimination is not expressly prohibited. In any case, it is not clear that the Constitution would have a horizontal effect on private parties in Singapore; it does not in Malaysia, which amended its Constitution to prohibit gender discrimination explicitly after becoming party to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.101 Thus, the Singapore Manpower Ministry investigates allegations of discriminatory practices and may counsel, warn, and take administrative measures against errant employers.102 This preference for informal implementation may stem from the Confucian view that “law obstructs the internalization of norms of conduct and deference that are the true sign of virtue and character building.”103 SCL norms that are not legally binding rely more on being internalized for their effectiveness. Thus the legal culture in NLDs is oriented more toward informal persuasion than institutionalized coercion.104\n\n3.2. Factors facilitating resort to SCL in NLDs\n\nReflecting an English drafting sensibility, both the Malaysian and Singapore constitutions were “short on inspiring statements”105 on national objectives and common beliefs.106 In Malaysia, the adoption of the Rukunegara was inspired by the Indonesia Pancasila,107 written by President Sukarno in 1945. Its purpose was to supplement the Constitution and promote reconciliation, embodying “an inter-communal national consensus on principles and objectives” achieved after the 1969 race riots.108 The Rukunegara was to entrench key constitutional provisions on citizenship and pluralism drafted pre-independence after interethnic bargaining, while preserving national unity. After its adoption in 1970, it became the object of ministerial reiteration and daily recitation at school assemblies.\n\nSimilarly, the shared values initiative was also likened to Indonesia's Pancasila109 during parliamentary debates as a statement of responsibilities able to educate the citizenry concerning important values. Suggestions to constitutionalize these shared values to avoid their becoming “pious pontifications”110 were rejected, as the white paper was not meant to be a “constitutional document” but a “credo,” which, while lacking the “force of law,” could be an object of faith.111\n\nIn the absence of constitutional preambles and norms to guide judges and legislators,112 SCL has been the vehicle for promoting an official national ideology, taking the form of nonjusticiable declarations and white papers in Malaysia and Singapore. These proffered rules for engaging in public life sought to elevate certain principles beyond political disputation, according them a quasi-constitutional status. Executive resort to SCL avoids protracted, contentious debate that proposed constitutional amendments to include even these values might attract. Attempts to constitutionally enshrine shared values to build community were alienating, ironically perceived as “shoving something down people's throats.” The values were not legalized so they could be “internalised and not contrived.”113 The values would “trickle down”114 and, not being “writ in stone,” would need to be reappropriated by each generation. They would serve “as guidelines rather than laws, being open-ended;115 to cultivate loyalty and a sense of duty, the values were promoted in schools and on government websites.116 They are still considered “an integral part of National Education,” which aims to nurture “responsible citizenship.”117\n\nTo some extent, these SCL instruments containing statements of national ideology have been given effect by courts and other political actors. The degree of influence SCL norms may exert, in generating obligations and behavioral compliance-pull, will largely depend on the authoritativeness of the promulgating government. In NLDs, this may flow from certain particularities absent from Western liberal democracies.\n\nFirst, the strong, dominant party state wielding centralized authority, which commands overwhelming legislative majorities, where post-Independence political turnover has yet to be experienced.118 Here, what Bagehot called the English Constitution's “efficient” secret, “the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and legislative powers”119 through the cabinet's control of Parliament via the party system, has been honed to a fine art. This has facilitated frequent constitutional amendments, which require the support of a super-parliamentary majority.120 An electoral system producing decisive majorities is maintained, and systems apt to produce weak coalition governments, like proportional representation, are rejected, thus avoiding “a government that is ineffective, indecisive or paralyzed by internal divisions.”121\n\nSCL norms are able to influence the behavior of institutions and citizens in this vertical regulatory setting, where the governors’ authority is founded on their political dominance and performance legitimacy is derived from economic success. Indeed, the latter fuels the Asian values or “trade-off” theory, which posits the necessity of curbing civil-political liberties to maintain the sociopolitical stability integral to attracting foreign investment and trade and, thereby, human development. This argument has been critiqued as justifying authoritarian political structures and stymieing the emergence of a rights culture.\n\nSecond, the efficient operation of informal soft rules is facilitated by the politico-legal culture of public trust in governors in Singapore, extending filial piety notions into the public realm, whose competence and moral integrity effectively “lends more legitimacy to a government than its legal authority.” This is contrasted with situations of a “trust deficit,” which fosters an “adversarial approach” calling for “institutional checks on government.”122 So, too, the so-called feudal culture in Malaysia123 translates into a sense of deferential respect and loyalty toward authority. In nonliberal orders, the law is not viewed, exclusively, as a tool of restraint but as an instrument of power serving the elite-defined priorities of the state's developmentalist agenda. Consequently, the exercise of executive discretion may go unchallenged and executive actors may be in a stronger position to persuade compliance with SCL norms.\n\nThird, the factor of personalism and charismatic authority, which defies the legal-rational state, cannot be discounted. In Singapore, this force emanates from the personal prestige of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, “one founding father” who, forty-five years after Independence, “is still in this House”124 Indeed, foreign journalists have likened encounters with Lee to “interviewing George Washington and Thomas Jefferson rolled up into one.”125 His intervention in Singapore politics is still determinative; for example, his joining the heated debate over whether to allow casinos had a “calming effect” and without which “the religious groups would [have] fought tooth and nail to stop it.”126 The heavy weight accorded ministerial statements in a politically hegemonic state, where policy can easily be converted to law, was demonstrated in Liao Eng Kiat v. Burswood Nominees Ltd.127 Both the chief justice and senior counsel (who was a government MP) referred to the prime minister's 2004 National Day Rally speech, inviting debate on building casinos in Singapore. That the government expressed willingness to consider reversing its antigambling policy fuelled the judicial reversal of precedent disallowing the recovery of debts by foreign casinos through Singapore courts as violating public policy. The controversial decision to allow casinos was made, postjudgment, in 2005.\n\n3.3. The uses of SCL in nonliberal Asian democracies\n\nIn addition to influencing exercises of government power by regulating inter- and intra institutional relations, SCL instruments have been used to control and guide the behavior of citizens by promoting, in the language of civic responsibilities, standards of acceptable behavior based on community expectations in sensitive areas placed beyond the reach of judicial review, such as negotiating the borders between religion and politics.\n\n3.3.1. SCL and flexible interinstitutional rules of engagement\n\nHow novel constitutional institutions will operate and interact with existing agencies cannot be fully predicted at the outset; experience shapes the contours of constitutional roles, which a combination of hard and soft law may clarify or modify. While hard law, as expressed by formal constitutional amendment or statutes may be used to secure certainty, SCL is used when flexible guidance of institutional behavior is the primary consideration.\n\nThese options shaped the evolution of Singapore's presidency, which, in 1991, was transformed from a ceremonial into an elective office vested with discretionary powers to withhold assent from certain primarily financial decisions. The need to have a fiscal guardian to check unnecessary drawdowns on “past reserves”128 by the government in formulating budgets or entering into financial transactions was to remedy the weak political checks, mainly parliamentary scrutiny, over cabinet decision making. A popularly elected president would have the moral legitimacy to challenge the decisions of the prime minister who commanded the confidence of parliamentary majority;129 the arrangement, apparently, envisages a somewhat adversarial relationship. The creators of the elected presidency considered this novel institution of such fundamental importance that a complex entrenchment mechanism was devised to require that proposed amendments command a two-thirds majority in a national referendum. However, this mechanism was suspended so that the normal amendment by two-thirds parliamentary majority would continue to apply, thus allowing institutional amendments in the light of experience. In 2009, after a series of constitutional amendments which cumulatively whittled down presidential review powers in significant matters, such as removing the power to “veto” defense budgets drawing on past reserves, the government remained unwilling to activate the entrenchment mechanism since the institutional amendments were not yet finalized.130\n\nWhere presidential powers are truncated,131 hard law is utilized to realign the checks-and-balances scheme through clear rules, whereas SCL is deployed when open-ended guidelines are thought desirable. This is exemplified in a white paper132 on the principles informing intraexecutive working arrangements and defining disputed financial terms; it was drafted by government officials after consulting presidential advisers and adopted after “careful deliberation by both parties”133 of the “practical problems” encountered. This is reminiscent of the U.K.’s “declaratory” conventions insofar as the white paper did not reflect existing practice but, prospectively, set out norms for future guidance.\n\nThe impetus for articulating these principles was the cabinet's displeasure with the public airing of grievances by outgoing president Ong Teng Cheong at a 1999 press conference; the problems he voiced concerned informational deficits and civil servants who considered presidential interventions a “nuisance.”134 Friction arose from what President Ong called “the absence of clearly enunciated and mutually agreed principles and procedures,”135 creating “constitutional disputes”136 over ambiguous technical constitutional terms and which accounting method to apply, as this implicated when past reserves were utilized, which triggers presidential safeguard powers.\n\nThe government did not opt for an authoritative opinion from an ad hoc tribunal authorized by article 100 to consider constitutional questions. Instead, the president's ‘adversarial’ actions elicited ministerial statements in rebuttal—to preserve the government's “moral authority to govern”—which parliament debated. The aftermath was the adoption of the white paper, a “meticulously written document,”137 containing the “mutual understanding” of both parties on how to “give effect” to constitutional provisions and “how each party will conduct himself within this constitutional framework.” It defined terms like “reserves,”138 identified the correct accounting method, and stated precise standard operating procedures not constitutionally mandated to minimize future clashes. This required the provision of certain information by stipulated dates to the president and rules conditioning presidential discretion by requiring the president first to inform the cabinet of his opinion that certain transactions were likely to draw on past reserves, of which he disapproved,139 before gazetting this, as constitutionally required. This allows the cabinet to avoid a drawdown by transferring an equivalent amount from the current to past reserves.\n\nRigid rules cannot cultivate a working ethos. Hence, SCL was used to exhort the president and cabinet to seek a “harmonious working relationship” to set the trajectory for intrabranch interactions, thus departing from the confrontational quality of President Ong's sharp public criticism that had so “puzzled”140 the prime minister.\n\nThe white paper, as an expression of SCL, contained publicized and accessible guidelines. The president acceded to the prime minister's proposal that the consensus-oriented self-described “convention of agreed rules,”141 safeguarding the past reserves of government agencies, be published as a white paper “to serve as a public record of this Convention.”142 The principles were endorsed by parliamentary resolution, on a motion moved by a nongovernment-nominated MP Shriniwas Rai, who hoped legislative debate would bolster “public confidence” in the principles143 that the government was conscious to ensure would not “override” but “give effect” to the constitutional framework.144 Thus, the constitutional term “net investment income” (NII) was not redefined such that part of it would be counted as “past reserves” to be saved, as opposed to entirely constituting “current reserves,” which were exempted from presidential purview, since this would “go beyond the Constitutional provisions.”145 In 2001, the Constitution was formally amended to require that 50 percent of NII went into past reserves, to increase savings. Economically significant decisions involving intergenerational equity require the legitimacy conferred by parliamentary scrutiny, however minimal, and formal enactment. Additionally, these SCL norms were designed to regulate future behavior by evolving “a set of working norms and arrangements” that would facilitate the “smooth implementation” of constitutional safeguards without binding future successors. The principles could be altered by mutual agreement or unilateral notification.146 Described as embodying “constitutional practice,”147 the principles are non-exhaustive, given the infeasibility of covering every contingency “without fettering the efficient normal workings of Government.”148\n\nTrue to a constitutional pragmatism which rejects that a constitution may be fully codified as it needs to be experientially adapted, utilizing SCL balances the desire for flexibility, in refining a new institution, while ensuring sufficiently clear working definitions and rules for operational purposes. SCL can add flesh to, even alter, the skeletal meaning of constitutional provisions without formal textual amendment. A government MP suggested that using such constitutional conventions “makes the Constitution a living constitution,” allowing the president–cabinet relationship “to evolve.”149 While “open to future evolution,”150 issues not addressed by the principles were to be approached “in accordance with the spirit and intent of the Constitution.”151 Shriniwas Rai drew linkages between this commitment and the shared values, in keeping with “the spirit of conciliation and consensus”152 as the preferred mode of institutional interaction. Today, these principles remain unconstitutionalized153 yet form part of the Constitution as an institution, providing a procedural framework for the discharge of constitutional duties, even if the relevant parties may choose to depart from these norms.\n\n3.3.2. SCL as driver of economic policy and distributive justice\n\nIt is the 1970 Rukunegara154 declaration, which placed certain political principles “outside the realm of political disputation,”155 rather than the Malaysian constitution, that contains distributive-justice norms. The declaration alluded to the need for economic redistribution to correct the marginalization of bumiputeras156 who were thought to have caused the 1969 riots at a point in time when the Malay community then owned only 1.5 percent of the economy.\n\nThe National Economic Policy or NEP (Dasar Ekonomi Baru) was instituted by the Malaysian prime minister and presented to parliament in 1971.157 It remained in force until 1990, to be replaced by similar successor plans158concerned with equitable development. This race-based affirmative action program went “far beyond economics”159 in seeking to terminate the identification of race with wealth by leveling up the economic situation of bumiputeras through enlarging their ownership160 stake in the economy within a certain time frame. The NEP constituted “the essence of a new social contract,”161 which the 1971 Rukunegara amendments162 were designed to constitutionally entrench. This took the form of extending the preexisting special privileges163 of bumiputeras (Malays and other indigenous groups)164 from the land reservations and public sector jobs, mandated by the 1957 Constitution, to matters relating to education, government licenses, and contracts. Although these were to be periodically reviewed, they continue in operation. Questioning sensitive topics (special privileges, national language, the monarchy, and citizenship) was made seditious,165 placing “the laws enshrining the social contract (of 1971) and sedition beyond question and in fact beyond repeal.”166\n\nThe NEP sought to promote unity through social justice, which required both wealth generation and fair redistribution. It was implemented not by law but by SCL or state policies, through exercising extensive executive powers which was “assisted by the bureaucracy and a compliant judiciary,”167 as well as by a ‘feudal’ cultural mentality breeding a passive conception of citizenship. While it may be seen as an expression of the social contract shaped by the Rukunegara’s securing of Malay rights (article 153), the NEP has been criticized as reflecting Malay political supremacy, implemented by a Malay-dominated authoritarian coalition government.168 Its constitutional reference point may be contested insofar as the NEP transcends the8 narrow matters stipulated in article 153. While the NEP may contravene the constitutional equal protection guarantee, this has yet to be litigated. Thus, SCL allows the executive to say what the Constitution is or permits, supported by a legislative framework in implementing an executive-designed program.\n\nThe NEP and its progeny policies were implemented through guidelines adopted by the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC), organized under the prime minister's Economic Planning Unit. To ensure the NEP objectives of promoting Malay ownership of the economy and preventing foreign dominance, two important guidelines were adopted in 1974 pertaining to corporate (“Guidelines for the Acquisition of Assets, Mergers and Take-overs”) and property ownership (“Guidelines for the Acquisition of Property by Local and Foreign Interests”). The goal was 30 percent bumiputera ownership of all commercial and industrial activities by 1990, with the remaining 40 percent and 30 percent in non-Malay and foreign hands, respectively.169\n\nThe prime minister presented the guidelines as serving the national interest, urging the private sector to respond in a “constructive manner.”170 Without statutory mandate, the guidelines provided that certain transactions had to obtain FIC approval,171 although failure to do so would not thwart a contract's legality.172 There were no further indications on how the FIC should act nor were sanctions made available for instances of noncompliance.\n\nThe courts have found that the guidelines which implement the NEP are not juridically binding and lack “the force of law,”173 although they have attributed some legal weight to NEP values by finding that a breach of the guidelines, which are designed to “correct any racial economic imbalance,”174 is contrary to public policy. As this vitiates a contract under the Contracts Act,175 there is strong inducement to comply. The Federal Court in David Hey v. New Kok Ann Realty Sd Bhd176 took “judicial notice” of the NEP, which was more than “mere political policy,” “reflecting as it does a national economic policy.”177 The board of directors refused to register a 37 percent share transfer (exceeding the 15 percent rule set by the guidelines) to one David Hey, asserting absolute discretion to do so on the basis of its articles of association and English case law, provided it acted bona fide. The court accepted this argument, noting, however, that noncompliance with the guidelines could have “adverse consequences” for a private company, without elaborating further.178 Thus, the guidelines had legal effect in being judicially considered a relevant factor for private actors to consider in their decision-making process, which is “a purely administrative act.”179 Beyond that, the guidelines, which lie somewhere on a continuum between political policy and public policy, imposed only a “moral obligation,”180 since noncompliance did not incur a penalty or invalidate arguments.\n\nFurther, the guidelines enjoy state support and some measure of coercive power insofar as they are parasitic on the existing legal framework. State agencies like the National Land Council (NLC) will not register a transaction unless FIC Guidelines are complied with. Article 91(5) of the Constitution empowers the NLC to make legally binding national policy for land usage. By co-opting FIC guidelines and directing state authorities to treat these as if issued by the NLC (NLC-FIC guidelines)181 under article 91, the NLC apparently conferred legal effect on the guidelines since the federal and state governments “shall” follow policy formulated in light of article 91, which has the force of law. Thus, certain industry players, such as companies bidding for privatization projects, treat the NEP not as mere political rhetoric but as “a piece of legislation” to be ignored “at one's peril,” as noncompliance may incur legal consequences.182\n\nThus, the NEP and the guidelines it inspires helps secure the objective of bumiputera equity participation, served by a deferential culture of “followership,”183 which facilitates the exercise of bureaucratic discretion in ensuring guidelines compliance, absent any real threat of judicial control.184 Resort to SCL enables the executive to efficiently elaborate the precise content of the NEP through FIC guidelines, the breach of which has legal effects. Arguably, this opens a backdoor allowing the federal government to usurp the role of state agencies in controlling land acquisition by foreigners. The NEP schemes have bred disquiet among non-Malays who argue that the quota goals have been attained, rendering the scheme redundant, or that affirmative action should be means-oriented rather than race-based.185 Nonetheless, suggestions to terminate the scheme is unpopular with the Malay community. The UMNO-dominated coalition government which has until recently commanded a strong parliamentary majority has utilized the flexibility of SCL to implement its NEP programs; recent electoral losses in 2008 have spurred the current premier to state his readiness to gradually terminate Malay special privileges and to replace these with a needs-based system.186 This may be mere rhetoric, but it suggests that the loss of a strong parliamentary majority in a NLD brings to the fore issues of accountability, rendering it politically costly to utilize SCL to implement unpopular programs, which benefit only one sector of the population.\n\n3.3.3. SCL as tool for promoting social integration and a national identity\n\nIn an accidental multiracial, religiously diverse nation-state like Singapore, SCL has been used in an attempt to generate a sense of solidarity in the absence of a shared history or common culture, which would otherwise feed a love of patria. The attempt to construct a political culture open to all citizens, thereby muting the religious or ethnic chauvinism that have historically threatened social cohesion, is reminiscent of the idea of “constitutional patriotism” associated with Jürgen Habermas.187\n\nThis notion seeks to direct the primary allegiance of citizens not to an exclusive ethnonational culture or vague cosmopolitanism but to the political principles contained in a liberal democratic constitution, to secure political stability through “sharing political space on fair terms.”188 This “strategy of redirection” seeks to “makes affect safe for liberal democracy”189 by directing emotional attachments away from a historical community and toward principles all can share. This sustains a constitutional culture which is “always open and incomplete.”190 Detractors distrust this form of totalizing collective identitarian logic and officially managed top-down integration for fear of “othering.” By advocating loyalty to constitutional values, it threatens individual identity through fostering homogeneity among citizens, which the antiliberal Carl Schmitt thought indispensable for democracy. Negatively, constitutional patriotism in managing group loyalty from above and tending toward political arrangements which promote social integration, has illiberal tendencies. Positively, it may bring together ethnically and religiously divided societies by diverting communal attachment toward “a set of normative commitments centered on a constitution.”191 Forging a national identity based on a shared normative reservoir may produce a “source of civic trust”192 and a reference point to which all citizens may appeal.\n\nToward this end, the utility of SCL becomes apparent, particularly in NLDs, which mix “a substantial degree of democracy with a substantial degree of illiberalism.”193 The normative architecture of a nonliberal polity accords primacy to the community rather than to individual autonomy, which constitutional liberalism prioritizes. In working out a communitarian vision, the state actively promotes a conception of human flourishing based on nonliberal theories of the good, drawing meaning from ethnicity, culture, and religion, because nothing about constitutionalism “requires a dogged moral or metaphysical skepticism.”194 Thus, NLDs may favor a culture of responsibilities and civic virtues rather than a hyperindividualistic culture of rights. Within the notion of plural liberalism, provided basic standards of human dignity and welfare are realized, it is legitimate for a self-determining society to pursue a responsibilities rather than rights-based notion of good society.\n\nFirst, if human good is to be secured by the medium of rights—frequently constitutionally entrenched rights—then SCL may be avoided, as rights must be protected by legal remedies requiring clear rules and processes. While the significance of ‘rights’ is self-evident to the rights holder, because it affirms his value and personal interests, it is necessary to build up the notion of what responsibilities entail and why one should be responsible. While rights may be enforced, responsibilities must be inculcated and internalized to affect behavior. Norms bearing coercive legal force are involuntary, as opposed to SCL norms, which are hortatory in nature but enjoy some measure of authority or bindingness.\n\nSecond, SCL may express the substantive vision of a national community. While constitutional instruments typically contain rules difficult to relate to on an emotional level, SCL norms, which may remain perpetually soft, may be used to stir affective loyalties, allowing citizens to relate to their constitution. The unifying function of SCL is evident in using the Rukunegara to integrate a Malaysian identity,195 in affirming the importance of “maintaining a democratic way of life,” and in creating “a united nation in which all regard themselves as Malaysians irrespective of race or creed.”\n\nThe Singapore Constitution is devoid of the lofty aspirational statements usually found in a preamble or directive principles of state policy. Arguably, the normative orientation of the constitutional order resides in government-authored SCL documents like the white papers on shared values (1991) and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony (MRH, 1989). These texts flesh out the content of Singapore communitarianism.196 Recognizing that diverse cultures and creeds were not reducible to “a single comprehensive doctrine,”197 the government emphasized that the shared values could be treated as universal, did not alienate any group, and could become the cornerstone “for building a common Singaporean identity.”198 The government stated that “religious values” were excluded from the table of shared values because “Singapore is a secular state”;199 neither was it a backdoor expression of Chinese chauvinism through the imposition of Chinese Confucian values on minority communities as the “Confucian concept of family ties,” which could breed nepotism and had to be modified to suit “our ethos.”200 The white paper was cast in both descriptive and prescriptive terms, with a communitarian emphasis on society and a statist valorization of national unity, accompanied by the intent that “all communities will gradually develop more common, distinctively Singaporean characteristics.”201 The political dominance of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) government provides optimal conditions for facilitating social integration, through promoting “Constitutional Patriotism par le haut, where political elites decree constitutional values,”202 in a process immune to judicial review. Echoing Llewellyn's insight that it is inaccurate to treat courts as the “be-all and end-all of legal focus,” since the “center of law” is “not merely what the judge does … but what any state official does, officially,”203 the Constitution means what the executive says it means, through the medium of SCL.\n\n3.3.4. SCL as tool for regulating citizen behavior and the interaction of “religion” and “politics”\n\nTerms in constitutions or primary statutes tend to be couched in a broad and open-textured manner and are usually left to judicial interpretation. However, where judicial review is ousted, this opens the door for nonjudicial constitutional actors to play a primary role in fleshing out their content through SCL.\n\nThis state of affairs is apparent in the way that the spheres of “religion” and “politics” are regulated, both in terms of their interaction and separation; it implicates the scope of the article 15 religious freedom guarantee and the Singapore model of pragmatic “accommodative secularism.”204 While there is case law interpreting the scope of article 15, this does not extend to all manner of relevant social activities. The courts have affirmed that religious profession is based on freedom of conscience and have justified public-order limits on religious practice, such as where Jehovah's Witnesses are not granted conscientious objector status for refusing to perform mandatory military service. However, when it comes to maintaining religious harmony where politically sensitive issues are involved, the courts are excluded from a role and the executive takes center stage in delimiting the boundaries of religion and politics through SCL norms. This is a field where responsiveness and flexibility is prized over strict rules.\n\nSCL norms are found in two key documents: the 1989 Maintenance of Religious Harmony (MRH) white paper and the 2003 Declaration on Religious Harmony (DRH); the norms they contain are reiterated at significant points in time to fuel expectations of compliance, especially after a crisis situation threatening to impair religious and racial harmony. They are broadly accessible through media or government websites, which is necessary if SCL norms are to guide future behavior. For example, the MRH white paper provides some informal if vague guidelines for exercising the constitutional right to religious propagation, stating that this must be “exercised very sensitively,” while affirming the right to have or not to have a religious belief.205 “Sensitivity” cannot be defined by rules but gains content through common sense and the apprehension of real-life religious sensitivities.\n\nThe guidelines differentiate between interested hearers and attempts to convert a person of a different faith “by denigrating his religion,” which can cause offense and social unrest. Thus, the government has consistently discouraged Christian groups from aggressively evangelizing the Malay Muslim community.206 In 2010, the media gave broad coverage when the Internal Security Department called up a Christian pastor to inform him that various sermon remarks, made available online, were inappropriate in casting other faiths in a negative light.207 The home minister, while affirming that propagating religious beliefs was a constitutional liberty, stated, “[I]t must never be by way of insulting or denigrating the religious beliefs of others. This is a fundamental OB [i.e., out-of-bounds or “off-limits”] marker that we must all steer by in Singapore.”208 The reiteration of the principle of nondenigration in propagation is meant to underscore the rules of engagement, though if overstated, can unduly chill religious speech.\n\nThus, SCL norms assume the form of directives “vertically” addressed to citizens on the responsible exercise of their fundamental liberties209 and delimiting the scope of religious liberty. SCL also fills in the content of contested political legal concepts, such as secularism and the appropriate role of religion in a secular democracy whose Constitution does not refer to an official religion, while obliging the government to care for “racial and religious minorities” and to enact legislation regulating Muslim personal law.210\n\nThese SCL norms operate against the backdrop of hard legislation, such as the Sedition Act,211 and laws criminalizing offenses against religion.212 In 1990, the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA)213 was enacted, cordoning off judicial review from the matter of “religious harmony” and leaving the balancing of religious liberty and public order to the colonisation of executive-authored SCL norms. These may be enforced through background hard legal sanctions drawn from criminal or security law, though this is to be a measure of last resort. The MRHA empowers the minister to issue nonjusticiable restraining or gag orders against a religious leader who promotes political causes, undertakes subversive activities under guise of religious belief, or causes hostility between religious groups.214 Violations of such orders may be legally prosecuted, though, to date, no restraining orders have been issued, although formal warnings have been administered.215 Thus, the ground rules regulating religious harmony fall within executive discretion; indeed, the turn away from adversarial third-party adjudication is deliberate in its intent to keep volatile religious conflicts out of court, as the official preference is to mediate conflict through quiet diplomacy.216\n\nThe broad and indeterminate grounds for issuing restraining orders make it unclear, in the absence of a legal bright line, when any of the three stipulated primary threats to religious harmony described in the MRH white paper are present. These are (1) mixing religion and politics, as where religious groups venture into radical social action or act as political pressure groups, sparking fears that other groups will follow suit and precipitate conflict; (2) exploiting religion for subversive purpose, such as establishing a Marxist state; and (3) aggressive proselytizing in a context of heightened sensitivities owing to religious revivalism and the competitive evangelistic pursuit of converts.217 The threats to the political and social order presumably fall under the “public order” exception to religious freedom under article 15(4). To the government, “conscious efforts” are required to maintain religious harmony; these are rooted in the internalized practice of “respect and tolerance for other faiths” as the “ground rules of prudence and good conduct.”218\n\nThe MRH white paper provides some guidance on the range of legitimate religious expression in public life. While advocating that religious believers “exercise moderation and tolerance” and that religion and politics be kept “rigorously separated” to maintain harmony,219 it recognizes that the dividing line between religion and politics is not clear cut. Religious group participation in welfare provision is welcomed and religious individuals are free as citizens to participate in the democratic political process through voting and debating public policy. However, religious leaders are exhorted to be circumspect and not “use their religious authority to sway their followers” or “incite them to oppose the Government”;220 they should mutually abstain from seeking “competitive political influence.”221 In 2009, the government through major ministerial speeches extended SCL norms, exhorting religious groups to “practice tolerance, restraint and mutual respect” toward secular groups as well. This was in response to a new public order threat in the form of culture war clashes between secular activists and social conservatives with religious affiliations. The specter of one religion unduly encroaching on public life in a multireligious setting was mischievously exploited to create a moral panic and to detract from the debate over contested public values.222 This had a polarizing effect, agitating disharmony and moving the government to urge that all parties act with reciprocal restraint and tolerance. The government recognized that social divisiveness could be caused not only by interreligious conflict but also where secular groups wanted to “strongly push their views and change our social norms”;223 both the president and prime minister seized exhortatory moments to urge citizens to live up to accepted ideals of tolerance and respect, in a spirit of solidarity.224 It would be illiberal to legislate tolerance.\n\nThese SCL or ground rules for religious group participation in public life illumine the extant model of constitutional secularism. These guidelines seek to shape future conduct in signposting the limits on religious freedom, and providing indicators for what constitutes a ‘responsible’ exercise of a guaranteed liberty. This turn to informal modalities of regulation, reflective of a relational, rather than rights-based legal culture, points to the limits of legal solutions in managing relational harmony between distinct groups to preserve peace. In what might be unique to NLDs, SCL is thus used to regulate the relationships between citizens.\n\nSCL norms must be internalized to be realized. In the process of drafting the Code of Religious Harmony, the government sought the participation of stakeholders in the form of religious leaders and society at large by seeking their feedback. The code was proposed by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in October 2002, after a thwarted bomb plot by some Muslim terrorists caused ethnic relations to reach their postcolonial nadir, with non-Muslims viewing Muslims and their “increasing radicalism” with suspicion. The code was to provide a framework to “crystallise the consensus” of Singaporeans concerning how to pursue “our respective religious beliefs in multi-racial Singapore.”225\n\nThe legitimacy of a document is more likely to be bolstered where it is a product of consultation, not diktat, even if the drafting process was spearheaded by a junior minister and parliamentary committee. Legislation has costs, including the perception that public officials are being given another layer of power to tell people “how to practice their religion.”226 Legal sanctions are not the optimal method for producing a shared ethos. If a document merely underscored existing principles, it would not be criticized as enlarging state powers to the detriment of fundamental liberties. Hence, the nonbinding Declaration on Religious Harmony (DRH) was submitted to the government in February 2003, with the excision of “code” to downplay any legalistic connotations.227 The DRH may have more stability than general policy statements and was presented as a “people's document,” forming part of the larger strategy against the terrorist threat. It reads:\n\nWe, the people in Singapore, declare that religious harmony is vital for peace, progress and prosperity in our multi-racial and multi-religious Nation. We resolve to strengthen religious harmony through mutual tolerance, confidence, respect, and understanding. We shall always recognise the secular nature of our State, Promote cohesion within our society, respect each other's freedom of religion, Grow our common space while respecting our diversity, Foster inter-religious communications, and thereby ensure that religion will not be abused to create conflict and disharmony in Singapore.\n\nThe declaration is largely hortatory, informal in tone and persuasive in posture, seeking to neutralize religion as a threat to disharmony through communication. Indeed, the drafting process, by diffusing tension through interactive dialogue, helped to build the social capital of relational trust, sensitivity to the concerns of others, consensus and a sense of ownership in the declaration, at a time of heightened religious and ethnic tension, in reminding all citizens of their shared interests in pacific coexistence.\n\nNotably, the DRH's drafters were conscious of adhering to constitutional norms, in rejecting proposals from certain sectors228 to ban or regulate the constitutionally guaranteed right of proselytization.229 DRH principles are too vague to be of any practical use in the adjudicative context; their utility lies as a timely reminder230 to citizens of the social norms necessary for preserving racial-religious harmony. These norms were widely disseminated to schools and grassroots bodies. This helps to promote norm-compliance through social expectations concerning future behaviour, mediated through self-regulation and persuasion in promoting a trust-based way of life. The Declaration as SCL operates within the existing legal framework and where reason and prudence fails, punitive law applies.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe classic purpose of studying constitutions has been to define, by comparative examination, what the term “constitution” means and the role it plays in the political process.231 Constitutional documents “are highly incomplete, if not misleading, guides to actual practice, that is … the ‘working constitution’ or the ‘governance’ of a country.”232 If ‘Law’, which constitutes relationships and delimits acceptable social behavior, is “whatever people recognize and treat as law through their social practices,”233 then, to identify the complete constitution, one must focus on both the “formal constitution and the real constitution,”234 on “constitutional paragraphs” and “constitutional institutions.”235 to gain a fuller picture of constitutional reality.\n\nA definition “both excludes and includes” and, in so doing, “marks out a field.”236 SCL, as part of a working constitutional order, extends the province of constitutional law beyond the text and judicial review-based constitutionalism, by deriving the contents of a constitution functionally, rather than formally. SCL as a mediator between law and politics shares the action-guiding role of law as a normative order and is also of constitutional significance, since it affects the working of constitutional institutions and the scope of rights, thereby shaping legal consciousness. By focusing on law as institution, it directs attention to the social patterns and interactions informing the acceptable areas of government control. This situates constitutional law in its broader social context, shedding light on how constitutions function within a political order and provides room for cultural explanations of behavior and how a sense of obligation may be generated. Thus, it wields a predictive power “about what will happen in certain circumstances.”237\n\nSCL as a mode of constitutional regulation may influence judicial interpretation; however, it is also a channel through which the political branches of government define and develop the constitution. It is not unique to nonliberal democracies; some of the functions it performs take place in both NLDs and Western liberal democracies, such as realigning the division of public powers between constitutional actors, based on norms enjoying some degree of bindingness through persuasive force, informal agreements, or background legal sanctions. Where SCL emanates from the executive branch, it raises concerns about evading both legislative and judicial scrutiny and centralizing executive discretion, with implications for issues of accountability and limited government.\n\nIn nonliberal Asian democracies with strong governments and weak courts, which play a marginal role in constitutional interpretation, SCL is a method of constitutional development. This is the case insofar as it enables the executive to define broad concepts like secularism, treating the constitution not as “a ‘segment of being’ but a ‘process of becoming’,” which is “constantly developing while maintaining some sense of fidelity to the original compact.”238 SCL is also an expression of the efficient government, wielding both sword and purse, able to advance its political and economic agenda. In Malaysia, the race-based affirmative action program, privileging the majority Malay community, is driven by SCL, purporting to implement distributive justice principles found in the social contract, which causes disquiet among the politically weak but economically dominant non-Malay minorities. In Singapore, SCL has been used in efforts to construct a constitutional or national identity based on a communitarian ‘Asian’ culture, to promote social cohesion. It has also been deployed to perform the distinctive function of regulating the behavior of groups of citizens by supplying normative guidance to socialise them into observing the ground rules for interaction within a secular democracy and, thus, to secure racial and religious harmony. SCL may also elevate what it takes to be fundamental values beyond political debate, through the conferral of quasi-constitutional status.\n\nSCL may raise concerns to the extent that it provides another tool to be used by authoritarian, strong states for illiberal purposes, such as effecting a top-down management of group identity, by promoting a form of constitutional patriotism tailored to the imperatives of nonliberal democracies. Furthermore, there is illiberalism in using SCL to sustain or constitute a duty-oriented culture that highly prizes social harmony and eschews adversarial methods of dispute resolution in favor of consensus and conciliation, as this dampens the evolution of an empowering rights culture. By maximizing executive discretion, immunized from judicial review, and by emphasizing communitarian duties over individual rights, a petitionary orientation between citizen and state is cultivated; rather than asserting rights against state wrongs through established procedures, the citizen is placed in a position of supplication before government officials. This redefines the relationship from one of governor as public servant and sovereign individual to a more feudal one, akin to the sovereign-subject relationship. This undermines the egalitarian ethos underlying democratic tenets and reduces the security of citizens in their dealings with public authorities.\n\nSCL, by being more stable than policy and enjoying some degree of formality, may contribute toward the legitimation of exercises of state power and so validate soft authoritarian power structures. Nonliberal regimes, which utilize SCL to consolidate executive discretion and to foster a responsibilities rather than rights-oriented society, may draw legitimacy from sources other than a formally democratic political system, such as performance legitimacy feeding off stellar economic growth. This nurtures a greater degree of trust in governors than one would find in Western liberal democracies. This respect for authority might be sustained by cultural norms flowing from the “greater Asian acknowledgment of the need for, and indeed the desirability of, authority,” in sharp contrast with “the Western enthusiasm for limiting authority, which is unaccompanied by any fear that the result could be the revival of primitive power.”239 However, culture is not static, and the insistence that “the concept of government by honourable men,” possessed of the citizens’ trust and respect, “fits us better”240 than the Western idea of limited government as a shared political ideal smacks of an apology for power.\n\nJames Madison identified the “great difficulty” in “framing a government,” first, as enabling the government “to control the governed” and then obliging it “to control itself.”241 While the language of constraint and limited government dominates Western constitutional discourse, that of empowerment and the strong state is the dominant dialect in nonliberal democracies. In the latter context, the unhindered resort to executive-authored SCL norms to order institutional interaction and to shape and control the behavior of citizens both reflects the efficient power of strong centralized states and entrenches it. In enhancing, rather than limiting government power, SCL may prolong the longevity of nonliberal parliamentary governments, provided the fusion of powers between the executive and legislature, which sustains the leviathan state, remains a feature of the political landscape.\n\n© The Author 2010.
