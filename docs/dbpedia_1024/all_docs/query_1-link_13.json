        "text": "PART II\n\nUnit Awards 1. Presidential Unit Citation 11 2. Navy Unit Commendation 16\n\nPart II. UNIT AWARDS\n\nSection 1. PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION\n\n(No Medal Involved)\n\n1. General Order No. 187 of 3 February 1943, promulgating Executive Order No. 9050 of 6 February 1942 provides:\n\na. Executive Order No. 9050, which authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Navy to issue a citation in the name of the President, to Navy and Marine Corps Units for outstanding performance in action is quoted.\n\nEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 9050\n\n(as amended by the President June 28, 1943)\n\nBy virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is ordered as follows:\n\n1. The Secretary of the Navy is hereby authorized and directed to issue a citation in the name of the President of the United States, as public evidence of deserved honor and distinction, to any ship, aircraft, or other naval unit and to any Marine Corps aircraft, detachment, or higher unit, for outstanding performance in action on or after October 16, 1941.\n\n2. Appropriate insignia of such form and design as may be determined by the Secretary of the Navy may be displayed by any ship, aircraft, naval unit, or any Marine Corps aircraft, detachment, or higher unit, to which such citation is issued.\n\n3. After any Naval or Marine Corps unit is so cited for outstanding performance in action occurring on or after October 16, 1941, such insignia shall become a part of the uniform of such unit, and shall be issued to officers and men who may thereafter become members of such unit; and such insignia may be worn at all times by individuals who were attached to the unit so cited on one of the two or more occasions in connection with which the citation was issued, whether they thereafter serve with such unit or with a different unit.\n\nFRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nFebruary 6, 1942.\n\nb. Commanders of forces afloat will make recommendations to the Secretary of the Navy via official channels for the Presidential Unit Citation for such units of their commands as from time to time they deem worthy of such distinction. Recommendations will be confined to cases wherein the unit performs services in action above and beyond the high standard expected of our forces and is considered outstanding as compared to services of other comparable units engaged in the same or similar actions. Each recommendation will be submitted separately and will be accompanied by sufficient data forming the basis of the recommendation to enable the Navy Department Board of Decorations and Medals adequately to consider the case.\n\nc. The insignia of the Unit Citation authorized by the above Executive Order shall be in the following form and design:\n\n1. A burgee pennant design of blue, gold, and scarlet of 27 units on the hoist by 57 units on the fly, with the gold measuring 13 units on the hoist and 48 units on the fly centered between the blue above and the scarlet below.\n\n2. For ships, aircraft, units, tank units, etc., a bronze plaque is authorized to be displayed; such plaque to be of appropriate size and to have the Unit Citation insignia centered in the upper part and the citation engraved below it. Individual planes, tanks, etc., of a cited unit are authorized to paint the design of appropriate size in a suitable place upon the plane, tank, etc.\n\n3. For companies, battalions, regiments, etc., awarded the Unit Citation, a battle streamer of appropriate size with the citation engraved upon the standard is authorized.\n\n4. Should a unit be cited more than once, for each citation in addition to the first for which the insignia is authorized, there shall be added one bronze three-sixteenths inch star. Stars will be displayed on the gold part of the insignia. The additional citation for each star is authorized to be engraved upon the plaque.\n\n5. In time of peace ships shall carry an additional display of pennant of the insignia design to be displayed at some place on the top hamper to be visible to other units.\n\n6. Should a cited ship be lost, provision will be made for the display of the plaque by the namesake, if appropriate, with a notation of when and where the ship was lost; or in the event that no new ship is named for the one cited and lost, the plaque will be sent to the United States Naval Academy for appropriate display.\n\nd.\n\n1. When a unit has received the Presidential Unit Citation all personnel of the cited unit who were actually present and participated in the action, or one of the actions if more than one is mentioned, upon which the citation is based, shall wear the ribbon with star permanently.\n\n2. Unless otherwise directed, individual eligibility of Navy personnel for the Presidential Unit Citation will be determined and the award issued by the Chief of Naval Personnel.\n\n3. Personnel attached to the cited unit but not present or participating in the basic action or actions and personnel who subsequently join the cited unit shall wear the citation ribbon without star and then only while attached to that unit.\n\n4. Flag officers and members of their staff serving in a unit upon the occasion for which cited, or any part thereof, shall be included in the unit citation.\n\n5. The following is a list of the Ships (Group I), Navy units and squadrons (Group II) and Marine units and squadrons (Group III) which have been awarded the Presidential Unit Citation:\n\n(NOTE: Units within groups listed (task units, Marine divisions, etc.) are shown with group only.)\n\n-- 11 --\n\nPRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION\n\n(GROUP I)\n\nShip Date - Location USS Aaron Ward (DD 483) 3 May 45 - Vicinity of Okinawa.

NAVY UNIT COMMENDATION\n\n(NO MEDAL INVOLVED)\n\n1. The Secretary of the Navy on 18 December 1944, established, with the approval of the President of the United States, a unit citation junior to the Presidential Unit Citation to be known as the Navy Unit Commendation, to be awarded by the Secretary of the Navy to any ship, aircraft, detachment, or other unit in the naval service of the United States which has, subsequent to 6 December 1941, distinguished itself by outstanding heroism in action against the enemy but not sufficiently to justify award of the Presidential Unit Citation; or to be awarded to any similar unit which has distinguished itself by extremely meritorious service not involving combat but in support of military operations and such as to render the unit outstanding compared to similar units rendering similar service. To justify this commendation the unit must have performed service as a unit of a character comparable to that which would merit the award of a Silver Star Medal or a Legion of Merit to an individual. Normal performance of duty under the ordinary hazards of war, participation in extended periods of duty or in a large number of combat missions does not in itself justify the award.\n\n2. No unit, or any part thereof, will be awarded both the Presidential Unit Citation and the Navy Unit Commendation for the same act of service.\n\n3. When a unit has received the Navy Unit Commendation, all personnel attached to the unit and actually present and serving therein during the service or occasion for which commended, or any part thereof, are authorized to wear the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon permanently regardless of where serving. Such personnel are authorized to wear a bronze star upon the ribbon for each additional commendation of the unit in which they serve during the occasion for which the unit is commended, whether it be the same or another unit.\n\n4. Unless otherwise directed, individual eligibility of Navy personnel for the Navy Unit Commendation will be determined and the award issued by the Chief of Naval Personnel.\n\n5. The following is a list of the ships (Group I) Navy units and squadrons (Group II), and Marine Corps units and squadrons (Group III), which have been awarded the Navy Unit Commendation:\n\n-- 16 --\n\nNAVY UNIT COMMENDATION\n\n(GROUP I)\n\nShip Date - Location USS Adams (DM 27): 24 Mar-1 Apr 45-Okinawa.
