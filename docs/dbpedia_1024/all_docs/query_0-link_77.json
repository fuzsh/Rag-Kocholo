        "text": "MISSION NBR. 45\n\nTARGET: Ploesti, Rumania - Marshalling Yard\n\nI. CHRONOLOGY\n\nForty B-24's took off at 1117 hours to bomb Ploesti Marshalling Yard and adjacent industrial area. Six returned early. Twenty-eight dropped 84 tones of 500 lb G.P. bombs on target at 1437 hours from 21,000 - 22,000 feet. One jettisoned 3 tons of bombs due to engine failure. Of the six early returned, three jettisoned 9 tons in the Adriatic and three returned 9 tons to base. Twenty-nine returned to base at 1723 hours. Five lost. None missing. None at friendly fields.\n\nII. ROUTE AND ASSAULT\n\nRendezvoused with the 98th Bomb Group at 1203 hours at 6000 feet over Manduria, and with the remainder of the Group on rendezvous line to San Vito D'Normanni at same altitude. Continued on course until I.P. was reached (Ocnita), then made right turn onto target attacking on an axis of 102 degrees. Rallied right and continued on course to Vidin, to key point and base. No rendezvous was made with fighters on route out but contact was made with 30 to 40 P-38's on route back at 1510 hours over Craiova.\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nJust prior to the target it was observed that there was some obscurity due to smoke from posts but the haze was light and certain identification features could be seen. The target area was well covered with much damage done. Photo coverage showed several direct hits on distillation units which started a large fire and caused a huge explosion. Another fire and explosion was caused by hits on 4 large storage tans. Still another fire was started by 10 direct hits on 4 large buildings believed to be tank car loading station and among tank cares. There were several direct hits on SE end of spur marshalling yard among cars and installation with resultant fires. Forty hits were recorded on installations at SE of marshalling yard. Twenty-four hits on railroad overpass and installations and 7 direct hits in the north choke point of marshalling yard.\n\nIV. ENEMY RESISTANCE\n\nA. Fighters: At 1313 hours or 1 hour 10 minutes before target time 2 FW-190's were seen flying in from the south and they stayed with our formation until the first attack was made acting as observers. And, without doubt, radioing information as to strength and heading to attacking units. Our Group was jumped 25 minutes from the target by 10 to 12 ME-190's who, using cloud cover, made a surprise attack from 12 o'clock high. These aircraft dived through the first attack unit directing their major power at the high right element and came up under the second attack unit. Three of our aircraft were shot out of formation with this first pass. The attack was coordinated and the fighters came through tin two, threes and fours. They would rally to the rear of our formation, make a side pass, gain altitude and they'd use the same tactics again.\n\nSomewhat closer to the target the enemy resistance increased and 50 to 60 ME-109's and FW-190's, 10 ME-110's and 10 to 15 JU-88's were seen. Attacks were made from all angles, singly and by pairs closing to within 50 feet before either pulling up or diving under. Coordinated attacks came from 6 o'clock low by formations of six flying two abreast, closing to 50 to 100 yards and breaking away on either side in a diving turn followed by a split 'S' and then raking the under side of the attacked bomber. No break off in intensity was noted over target and enemy fighters flew through flak to harass our formation. JU-88's stood off at 600 to 800 yards and fired rockets apparently directing the fire oat the lead ships in each attack element. Few closures were made by this type ship. All attacks were broken off 15 minutes past target. The fighter pilots were either very experienced or were driven by desperation. Our claims during this engagement are as follows: Destroyed 10 FW-190's, 14 ME-109's and 3 JU-88's, probable 2 ME-109's and 2 FW-190's. Markings: ME-109 - black cowlings, grey and silver wings and fuselages and yellow and orange spinners; FW-190 - grey fuselage, black wings and yellow and orange noses; JU-88 - black fuselage and wings. One ME-109 had British markings on the underneath side of each wing while on FW-190 painted yellow and green fuselage and wings with yellow nose had American insignia on the top of left wing.\n\nA. Plane #448: 4 ME-109's made 4 passes and then pulled off and sat just out of range. They did not attack until the target was passed. No claims.\n\nB. Plane #752: ME-109's and FW-190's made attacks form rear - 6 o'clock low and 3 o'clock high. 1 FW-190 listed at a probable.\n\nC. Plane #272: 3 ME-109's came in at 3 at a time at the tail. 1 FW-190 listed as a probable.\n\nD. Plane #454: Enemy aircraft came in 3 at a time at the tail. 1 FW-190 destroyed and 1 ME-109 probably destroyed.\n\nE. Plane #164: 3 ME-109's attacked immediately after coming off target. Not aggressive. 1 ME-109 attacked from 6 o'clock. No claims.\n\nF. Plane #338: 5 FW-190's attacked from 5 o'clock high and 9 o'clock. No claims.\n\nG. Plane # 390: Enemy aircraft attacked. Fairly aggressive. 1 FE-190 destroyed.\n\nH. Plane #827: 2 FW-190's 5 ME-109's, attacked level, 5 and 6 o'clock. 1 ME-109 destroyed.\n\nI. Plane #204: 10 single engine fighters came in singly from sides. 1 ME-109 damaged.\n\nJ. Plane #227: 1 FW-109 came in a t10 o'clock; peeled off to rear. 1 ME-109 came in at 6 o'clock going from left to right at our tail dropped off to left.\n\nK. Plane #189: 2 FW-190's made pass from tail level - turned right; dove down and away. No claims.\n\nL. Plane #438: 3 ME-109's and 2 FW-190's attacked from tail and pulled out about 400 to 500 yards. No claims.\n\nB. Flak: Over I.P. (Ocnita) this Group experienced, good, heavy flak while at target it was moderate good, heavy. In both cases it was predictor armed but at target it also seemed to be of the barrage variety particularly around the marshalling yard. On the route out flak was encountered at Nis and it was intense, good heavy. Nineteen of our aircraft were holed.\n\nV. OBSERVATIONS\n\nAt 1425 hours from 21,000 feet, our aircraft #950 was attacked by ME-109's and shot down - no chutes out. At 1442 hours from 20,500 feet, our aircraft #757 was seen with engine smoking and immediately started to spin down - 3 chutes out and opened. At 1432 hours from 21,000 feet, 1 B-24 blew up - no chutes out. At 1450 hours from 21,000 feet, 1 B-24 with engine on fire - 5 chutes out and opened. At 1450 hours from 20,000 feet, 10 miles southwest of target 2 ME-109's destroyed by low left element - 1 ME-109 blew up and the pilot in the other bailed out. A smoke screen, somewhat ineffective was initiated at the target. Smoke pots seemed to ring the entire city and were along every road in the southeast, south and southwest sections. Pots also were seen around the marshalling yard and all around the refinery area. At 1352 hours from 18,000 feet, 10 steam engines, and 300 cars seen in marshalling yard at Vidine. At 1335 hours from 16,000 feet, a 20 car train in steam heading south. At 1525 hours from 19,000 feet, 15 river tows consisting of a tug and 5 to 10 barges were seen in the Danube near Vidine going east. The Danube seemed to be very active and conveying large amounts of traffic. At 1638 hours from 7000 feet, a large freighter was seen. Also at this point were many mine nets off the coast. 15 boats were seen in the harbor. From 6500 feet, a large marshalling yard was seen in the harbor. At 1637 hours from 7000 feet, a medium size freighter was seen. From 6000 feet, the screen in the Pathfinder Ship picked up a radar station which seemed to be directly below\n\nVI. CASUALTIES\n\nFive of our bombers were shot down by enemy fighters, total of 7 chutes seen to open. Nineteen of our aircraft received flak damage, none serious. Five of our aircraft were damaged by fighters, none serious. Four crew members were slightly wounded by flak.\n\nVII.
