        "text": "Hello - my father was a top turret gunner on a B-24 liberator, assigned to the 454th Bombardment Group of the 15th Air Force. His plane was shot down 80 years ago, over Blechammer on August 22nd, 1944. He spent 9 months as a POW. He was a prisoner at Luftstalag iv from August until February of 1945. The Germans evacuated the camp and forced the prisoners to march through the countryside until they were liberated by the British in May. The camp does not exist. There is a small memorial in its place.\n\nAre there any arial photos of this POW camp? Are there any arial photos of the prisoners as they marched? There were some 2000 American and British NCOs in the camp by February of 1945. Even when they were split into 4 \"lagers\" they would still be a sizeable group when seen from the air.\n\nDo we know if the British have records of liberating and assisting these men? (Dad said it was a tank outfit who helped them.) If records exist, does anyone know how I might access the records?\n\nThank you for any and all assistance."
