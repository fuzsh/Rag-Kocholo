        "text": "Arthur B Johnson 323 Bomb Group attached to the 1st Pathfinder Squadron. I flew 6 missions with the 323 rd before being transferred to the Pathfinder Sq., ended up with 48 missions. I became an instructor at Page Field in Ft. Myers Florida. In the fall of 1942. Moved to Avon park then to MacDill then to Lake Charles. Checked out in B 26s then overseas as replacement to the 323rd and finally to the 1st pathfinder sq. The only problem flying Pathfinder lead was the 88s always zeroed in on us. Crew included 1st Lt. Erwin R Paaske, co pilot; 1st Lt. David H Hill, navigator; 2nd Lt. William R Banks, bombardier; T/Sgt Joseph A Raff, engineer; T/ Sgt Paul E Price, radioman; and Sgt Ulyeses Karitis, tail gunner. Raff and Price were on their second tour having flown first tour with the 100th of the 8th Airforce. My name is Owen Cottle. I was an aircraft armorer in the 558th Squadron, 387th Bomb Group, 9th Air Force stationed at Chipping Onger, England and subsequent locations from early 1944 until July 1945. Aircraft that I worked on included Pugnatious Peggy, Screaming Eagle and several others working in tandem with other ground crew armament personnel to load bombs and maintain the 50 cal guns. Best friends were Irvin Boisen from Montana, John Pelos from Washington, Frazier Bailey from Florida, Artie Gill from New Jersey, Dick Mizurka from Illinois. Have you any information on any of these people so that I could contact them?"
