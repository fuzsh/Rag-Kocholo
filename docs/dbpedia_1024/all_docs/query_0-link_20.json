It was last assigned to the 52d Tactical Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, where it was inactivated in January 1973.\n\nThe squadron was first activated in 1943 at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico as the 739th Bombardment Squadron. The 739th was last active in the Air Force Reserve at Spokane Air Force Base, Washington, where it was inactivated in June 1949.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nThe squadron was first activated in June 1943 at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico as the 739th Bombardment Squadron, one of the original four squadrons of the 454th Bombardment Group.[3] The 454th was a Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment group. The unit trained under Second Air Force. It deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, and was stationed in outhern Italy at San Giovanni Airfield under Fifteenth Air Force.\n\nThe squadron engaged in long range strategic bombardment of enemy military, industrial and transportation targets. Operations included attacks against such objectives as marshalling yards, aircraft factories, railroad bridges, and airdromes in Italy, Austria, and Rumania. It helped to prepare the way for and supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France during July and August 1944. At the same time, it expanded its previous operations to include attacks on oil refineries and storage facilities, locomotive works, and viaducts in France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Balkans.\n\nThe 739th returned to the United States after the surrender of Germany in May 1945. It began to be re-equipped as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron. The squadron began training under Second Air Force in August 1945, however it was inactivated in October after the surrender of Japan.[3]\n\nAir Force Reserve[]\n\nThe 739th Bombardment Squadron was reactivated as a reserve unit under Air Defense Command (ADC) at McChord Field, Washington in April 1947 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit, where its training was supervised by the 406th AAF Base Unit (later the 2345th Air Force Reserve Training Center) However, the squadron does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped while a reserve unit.[4] In 1948 Continental Air Command assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC.[5] President Truman’s reduced 1949 defense budget required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force.[6] Continental Air Command also reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system in June 1949. The squadron was inactivated and its personnel and equipment were transferred to elements of the 302d Troop Carrier Wing, which was activated simultaneously.[7][8]\n\nCold War[]\n\nThe 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron was activated in April 1969 at Spangdahlem Air Base Germany in an effort to restore an electronic warfare capability to United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE). It was planned to equip the squadron with Douglas EB-66 Destroyers, but all of USAFE's EB-66s had deployed to Southeast Asia to provide jamming support for the Viet Nam War. As a result, the squadron was initially equipped with the less capable Martin EB-57 Canberra. Shortly after activation, it became possible to equip the unit with sixteen EB-66s.[9] The squadron continued its mission at Spangdahlem until inactivating in 1973 as the EB-66 was withdrawn from the Air Force inventory.[10]\n\nThe 739th Bombardment Squadron and the 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron were consolidated into a single unit in September 1985.[11]\n\nLineage[]\n\n739th Bombardment Squadron\n\nConstituted as the 739th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 14 May 1943\n\nActivated on 1 June 1943\n\nRedesignated 739th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 5 August 1945\n\nInactivated on 17 October 1945\n\nActivated in the reserve on 16 August 1947\n\nInactivated on 27 June 1949[12]\n\nConsolidated on 19 September 1985 with the 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron as the 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron[11]\n\n39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron\n\nConstituted as the 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron on 18 March 1969\n\nActivated on 1 April 1969\n\nInactivated on 1 January 1973\n\nConsolidated on 19 September 1985 with the 739th Bombardment Squadron[11]\n\nAssignments[]\n\n454th Bombardment Group, 1 June 1943 - 17 October 1945\n\n454th Bombardment Group, 16 August 1947 - 27 June 1949[12]\n\n36th Tactical Fighter Wing, 1 April 1969\n\n52d Tactical Fighter Wing, 31 Dec 1971 - 1 January 1973\n\nStations[]\n\nAlamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico 1 June 1943\n\nDavis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 1 July 1943\n\nMcCook Army Air Field, Nebraska c. 31 July 1943\n\nCharleston Army Air Field, South Carolina 3 October 1943 – December 1943\n\nSan Giovanni Airfield, Italy January 1944 – July 1945\n\nSioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 1 August 1945\n\nPyote Army Air Field, Texas 17 August 1945 – 17 October 1945\n\nMcChord Field (later McChord Air Force Base), Washington, 27 April 1947 – 27 June 1949[12]\n\nSpangdahlem Air Base, Germany, 1 April 1969 - 1 January 1973\n\nAircraft[]\n\nConsolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943-1945\n\nB-29 Superfortress, 1945[12]\n\nMartin EB-57 Canberra, 1969[9]\n\nDouglas EB-66 Destroyer, 1969-1973[9]\n\nAwards and campaigns[]\n\nAward streamer Award Dates Notes Distinguished Unit Citation 12 April 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron, Bad Voslau, Austria[3] Distinguished Unit Citation 25 July 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron, Linz, Austria[3]\n\nCampaign Streamer Campaign Dates Notes Air Combat, EAME Theater January 1944-11 May 1945 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Air Offensive, Europe January 1944-5 June 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Rome-Arno 22 January 1944 – 9 September 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Normandy 6 June 1944 – 24 July 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Northern France 25 July 1944 – 14 September 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Southern France 15 August 1944 – 14 September 1944 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] North Apennines 10 September 1944 – 4 April 1945 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Rhineland 15 September 1944 – 21 March 1945 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Central Europe 22 March 1944 – 21 May 1945 739th Bombardment Squadron[3] Po Valley 3 April 1945 – 8 May 1945 739th Bombardment Squadron[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.\n\nKnaack, Marcelle Size (1988).
