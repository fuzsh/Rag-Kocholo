Arthur H. Vandenberg (born March 22, 1884, Grand Rapids, Mich., U.S.—died April 18, 1951, Grand Rapids) was a U.S. Republican senator who was largely responsible for bipartisan congressional support of international cooperation and of President Harry S. Truman’s anticommunist foreign policy after World War II.

Editor of the Grand Rapids Herald from 1906, Vandenberg became active in Republican politics and was appointed U.S. senator in 1928—a post he retained through election until his death. While supporting conservative policies in the domestic field, he grew interested chiefly in foreign relations. During the 1930s, he was a spokesman for isolationist sentiment and a bitter critic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941), however, he began to revise his picture of world relations and by the war’s end had come around to the view that the United States should participate actively in an effective international organization. He expressed this opinion in a notable Senate speech (January 1945) and thus provided valuable Republican support for the United Nations. In the same year, Roosevelt appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Conference on International Organization that met in San Francisco.
