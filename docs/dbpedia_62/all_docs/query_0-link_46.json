        "text": "The current situation with regard to aspects of research on learning and individual differences is briefly outlined, and the almost total absence of studies of hereditary factors in learning is underscored. It is proposed that the latter such studies will be most likely to facilitate communication between learning researchers and differential psychologists. To this end, previously unpublished data are described that bear on hereditary factors in learning task performance. Five learning tasks were administered to 84 pairs of like sexed fraternal and 128 pairs of identical twins of high school age. The significance of the increased within pair variance of the fraternal over the identical within pair variance, indicative of an hereditary component, was tested. This test suggested that for four out of the five learning tasks, there was a significant hereditary component. There also were sex differences in the importance of the hereditary component. Some directions that research into the heritable aspects of learning and acquisition should take are described."
