        "text": "Applied a random effects linear model to personality data (e.g., the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Comrey Personality Scales) gathered from 138 adult Swedish twins and their families. The multiple relationships surrounding the twins allowed for the estimation of variance fractions due to several genetic and environmental factors. A striking pattern of similarity among personality traits emerged. All variables were characterized by having near-zero additive genetic, smallâ€“moderate nonadditive genetic, negligible prenatal, small postnatal familial, and quite large postnatal extrafamilial effects. Personality traits were influenced primarily by the environment, especially those outside the home. Genetic influences were confounded by cultural factors. It is suggested that temporal instability, genetic epistasis, or both could be underlying factors that unify the results for personality variables. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)\n\nTwo samples of married couples, one from the mainland United States and one from Hawaii, show matching for physical attractiveness. The samples include young and recently married, middle-aged, and older couples. When age effects on attractiveness are partialled out, the spouse correlations are .30 and .25 for mainland and Hawaiian couples, respectively. These data suggest that the matching phenomenon is stable within and across generations.\n\nThe factor structure of the Comrey Personality Scales was replicated using a sample of suburban Denver residents ( N = 377). Correlations are reported between the Comrey scales and age, socioeconomic status, sex, body type, a short locus of control scale, the Raven Progressive Matrices Test, and the Neuroticism and Extraversion scales from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Correlations with self-reported leisure time activities and nervous habits provide a partial validation of the Comrey Activity, Stability, and Extraversion scales.\n\nPhenotypic assortment is assumed to be the principal mechanism of spouse similarity in most biometrical studies. Other assortment mechanisms, such as social homogamy, may be plausible. Two models are presented that consider phenotypic assortment and social homogamy simultaneously (i.e., mixed assortment), where selective associations between social background factors (Model I) versus selective associations between total environments (Model II) distinguish the models. A series of illustrative analyses was undertaken for education and fluid ability available on a sample of 116 Swedish twin pairs and their spouses. On the basis of several fit criteria Model I was preferred over Model II. Both social homogamy and phenotypic assortment may contribute to spouse similarity for educational attainment and fluid ability. Furthermore, spouse similarity for fluid ability may arise indirectly from social homogamy and phenotypic assortment for educational attainment. Power analyses indicated greater observed power for Model I than Model II. Additional power analyses indicated that considerably more twin-spouse sets would be needed for Model II than Model I, to resolve social homogamy and phenotypic assortment. Effects of misspecification of mechanisms of spouse similarity are also briefly discussed.\n\nIn a population sample of 1462 middle-aged women socioeconomic data were studied in relation to obesity, assessed by a body weight index. Education, annual income, and social class were negatively correlated with weight index (WI). Husband's social class was a stronger determinant of obesity in the woman than her own class. Age of husband and number of children were significantly correlated with WI. There was also a weak correlation between being single and WI. Sick leave was not correlated to WI. Pension was correlated to WI when adjusted for age, but not when allowance was also made for social class. Age, husband's social class, education, husband's income, and number of children were independent predictors of WI among the married women. In the single women, age and own income were independent predictors of WI but not number of children, education or own social class."
