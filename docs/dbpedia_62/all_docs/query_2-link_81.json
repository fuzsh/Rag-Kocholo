        "text": "Genesis of the project\n\nI have wanted to do this for a long time, having found nothing of the sort extant online. The nearest thing we have was compiled by the now-deceased Tony Salin, author of Baseball’s Forgotten Heroes. This was a series of stories on ballplayers now mostly forgotten, but who were important in their times and had great stories to tell. Salin seems to have been a very persuasive and persistent figure, considering that he even wangled an interview with the reclusive Pete Gray (who played major league baseball with one arm). If you love the old school version of baseball, Salin’s is one of the better books.\n\nAs an afterword, Salin included a lengthy name pronunciation guide. It surely helped that he spoke to the old players in person; their pronunciations would be definitive or very nearly so. Salin is my beginning source for many pronunciations, though not the sole source. His work and research are the property of The Baseball Reliquary, Inc., which gave me kind permission to use and expand upon his material. I have since joined TBR, but nonetheless copyright of all Salin’s work that may appear here is reserved to TBR. If you wish to support their very worthwhile baseball historical preservation work and research, find membership information here.\n\nSpecial thanks, therefore, first of all to Tony Salin for breaking the ground, and to Mr. Terry Cannon of TBR for his enthusiastic and rapid response to my inquiry for permission. Additional thanks to Mr. Bill Francis of the Baseball Hall of Fame, who found a number of answers for me, and had good ideas where I might locate the rest. For some of the more difficult ones, you can do as I do and thank Mr. Albert Kilchesty of TBR, who graciously volunteered his knowledge and extensive contacts, and spent a fair bit of time on behalf of this project digging through old Sporting News Registers–then invited me over to dig through some more, and plied me with great coffee while I did so. Larry Kitner, a faithful reader, has dug up plenty of pronunciations. Some of the most obscure are courtesy of John-William Greenbaum, whose bundle was a welcome bolt from the blue. Now and then I get an email from a fellow we’ll call MJY, always welcome.\n\nIf you decide to bookmark this page, your best method is to bookmark the main page, http//jkkelley.org and navigate from there. You see, I have to alter the URL of this page regularly to slow down the comment spam. However, the main page link is always correct.\n\nTerry passed on a few years back, to near-universal sadness, one of the true forces of baseball cultural preservation. It took me a while to think of it, but as of September 9, 2023, I have renamed the page in the honor of the man whose generous sharing made it possible. When I am gone, I hope someone will pick up the ball and go to the mound in turn.\n\nOne last thing: if you searched for a pronunciation, and didn’t find it here, please check back. I get notification of search strings that found this page. So if I see that someone searched on ‘joe schlabotnik pronunciation,’ and I haven’t found it yet, I’ll go digging. And odds are I’ll find it.\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Methodology A\n\nAase, Don: AH-see\n\nAber, Al: eh-BURR\n\nAbrams, Cal: just like the M1 tank (per BR)\n\nAgee, Tommie: uh-JEE (per BR; a later version insists it’s AY-jee as in rhyming with “lady.” A TV broadcast from his 1969 Series exploits concurs with the latter.

Family pronunciations can shift over time. Sometimes it’s both, as Leo Durocher describes growing up hearing French with his last name pronounced à la française, later Anglicizing it (or deciding to accept same from others). Where I believe that an individual may have pronounced his name differently at home than in the dugout, or just feel like sharing, I offer the correct non-Anglicized option.\n\nThis will always be a work in progress, so if readers have new information and can offer source support (i.e. know the family, heard the announcer, happen to speak the language, etc.), please comment to help improve the guide. I expect to get caught out and corrected a lot, and if the source is authoritative, would love to fix it. Highest credibility would be first the individual himself, then his family, then his descendants and teammates. Notes in red represent where I feel uncertain. In many such cases I’m about 95% sure and just don’t feel that’s sure enough. Often my only question is where the accent is, or whether the G is hard, etc. I try not to leap to assumptions, so if you are wondering “how could he be unsure of that?” it’s because he has learned to wait for confirmation. The most common issue is that people send me an update or correction without two of the most important things: accented syllables, and a description of their source. For example, if you’re the player’s nephew, or a personal friend, that’s perfect. But it is very important to have unambiguous phonetics and accenting. Best method is to include a word with which it rhymes, and please never forget that we need the proper accented syllables. We must take this seriously, in my view, because this project will be taken by many as a key source. I’ve already seen a lot of verbatim on baseball-reference.com. Can’t say it simpler: people will rely on this, and better to say nothing than to say wrong and be taken on faith.\n\nIf I don’t use the precise phonics you send me, it’s because I felt I had a more precise or less ambiguous way to render them. It’s an imperfect science with English phonics and the Latin characters. I understood what sounds you meant; now I have to make sure that every reader also does. Your contribution was just as helpful.\n\nIf you want to scan for red and dig something up to help out, climb into the cage and take some B. I speak passable Spanish and French, so if I’ve made a mistake there that you wish to correct, hopefully you are more fluent than me. I do not speak German or Italian, so I can use all the help I can get there. When you have to eat an elephant, don’t stuff a whole leg in your mouth at once; start with a toe. Thus a wise man once taught me, and for that reason, I have placed some emphasis on players who played more. Not that I’m unwilling to go after guys with one time at bat, or umpires, or coaches, just had to set a priority. If your guy isn’t listed yet, and there’s any question about the pronunciation and you can answer it, I’m ready to list any player, umpire, manager or coach in major league history. I count the Negro Leagues and the All-American Girls’ Professional Baseball League as major leagues, and will include pronunciations from those as readily as I will the AL/NL and predecessors. One nice thing about being the project initiator is that no one gets to veto one’s notions of who belongs.\n\nIf you find the comment process tedious, you can email “tc underbar vitki at yahoo dot com.” If you send your input this way, I will assume that privacy played a role, and will make my best efforts to credit you (hopefully I remember that bit) in some way that preserves your privacy.\n\nOld Baseball Registers can be helpful, but they can’t be taken for gospel. I did some digging in the old ones and found a lot of dubious pronunciations.\n\nAs the project has progressed from its auspicious launch (massive early hits thanks to an ESPN link), I have learned that a few passionate allies go very far. Buddy, Larry, MJY, you’re what love of the game is all about. Don’t credit me; I began with Salin’s work, did some of my own, but I could not have done all that others have.\n\n===\n\nTags: manuscript editor, fiction editor, non-fiction editor, freelance editor."
