        "meta_description": "The Afternoon Train, or 'A-Train', for short, is a constellation of satellites that travel one behind the other, along the same track, as they orbit Earth. Four satellites currently fly in the A-Train - Aqua, CloudSat, CALIPSO, and Aura. GCOM-W1 and OCO-2 are scheduled to join the configuration in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Glory was lost in a launch vehicle failure on March 4, 2011. The 'A-Train' satellites cross the equator within a few minutes of each other at around 1:30 p.m. local time. By combining different sets of nearly simultaneous observations from these satellites, scientists are able to study important parameters related to climate change.",

        "text": "The Afternoon Constellation - A-Train\n\nWhat is the A-Train?\n\nNASA and its international partners operate several Earth-observing satellites that closely follow one another along the same (or very similar) orbital “track.” A particular example of a coordinated group of satellites are in a sun-synchronous polar orbit, crossing the equator in an ascending (northbound) direction at about 1:30 PM local solar time, within seconds to minutes of each other—hence the name Afternoon Constellation. This allows near-simultaneous observations from a wide variety of instruments that are synergistically used to aid the scientific community in advancing our knowledge of Earth-system science and applying this knowledge for the benefit of society.\n\nThe original Afternoon Constellation comprised a single set of coordinated satellites, that began in earnest in 2006 when CloudSat and CALIPSO joined in orbit with the Aqua (launched in 2002), Aura (2004), and PARASOL (2004) satellites. The constellation was nicknamed the “A-Train” because satellite names starting with an “A” led and trailed the constellation at the time. The train was later expanded with the inclusion of GCOM-W1 (2012) and OCO-2 (2014). On November 16, 2011, PARASOL was lowered to 9.5 km under the A-Train and on December 18, 2013 PARASOL ceased operation, fully exiting the A-Train.\n\nIn February 2018, CloudSat lowered its orbit out of the A-Train after technical issues that potentially affected the satellite’s maneuvering capability. In September 2018, CALIPSO executed a series of maneuvers to join CloudSat’s orbit. Therefore, by late September 2018, the international Afternoon Constellation included the A-Train satellites (OCO-2, GCOM-W1, Aqua, and Aura) as well as the C-Train satellites (“C” for CALIPSO and CloudSat). The C-Train flew 16.5 km (˜10 mi) below the A-Train and therefore followed a slightly different ground track, though it intersected the A-Train ground track about every 20 days allowing for regular simultaneity between A-Train and C-Train instrument observations.\n\nCALIPSO and CloudSat ceased operations in 2023, ending the C-Train. CALIPSO ended its scientific mission August 1, 2023, after 17 years of operation. The final CALIPSO spacecraft passivation activities were successfully completed on December 15, 2023. Following the passivation of CALIPSO, CNES confirmed that there was no signal from the spacecraft during two ground contacts in Canada and French Guiana. With no more communication, CALIPSO is now decommissioned. CloudSat radar operations ceased on December 20, 2023, bringing to an end a rich 17 year and 8 month history of science observations.\n\nAs of January 2024, both Aqua and Aura continue to collect science data; however, they have slowly drifted out of the constellation. Due to fuel limitations, Aqua completed the last of its drag makeup maneuvers in December 2021 and is now in a free-drift mode, slowly descending below the A-Train and drifting to later equatorial crossing times, and lower altitudes. Aura completed its final inclination adjustment maneuver in April 2023 to save remaining fuel. Consequently, Aura is slowly drifting over time. The final drag make-up maneuver was performed in January 2023, so Aura will slowly begin losing altitude, but only a few kilometers by the end of the mission. The possible temporal evolution of Aura’s drift is <15 min through late-2024, ˜30 min by mid-2025, and less an hour by mid-2026.\n\nThe instruments on the remaining Afternoon Constellation satellites are used synergistically to improve our knowledge of clouds, aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, and other elements critical for understanding Earth’s environment and changing climate.\n\n> Read More\n\nIndividual A-Train Missions\n\nInfo\n\nAqua\n\nAura\n\nPARASOL\n\nCALIPSO\n\nCloudSat\n\nGCOM-W1\n\nOCO-2\n\nGlory\n\nInformation\n\nPlease use the tabbed menu above to learn more about the individual satellite missions involved with the A-Train Constellation.\n\nInformation that will be displayed includes the satellites:\n\nInstruments\n\nRelevant Science Focus Areas\n\nRelevant Science Questions\n\nScience Goals\n\nRelated Links\n\nReleated Applications\n\nAqua\n\nLaunch Date: May 4, 2002\n\nLaunch Location: Vandenberg Air Force Base, California\n\nAqua is a major international Earth Science satellite mission centered at NASA. Launched on May 4, 2002, the satellite has six differrent Earth-observing instruments on board and is named for the large amount of information it collects about water in the Earth system. Aqua gathers this information from its stream of approximately 89 Gigabytes of data a day! The water variables being measured include almost all elements of the water cycle and involve water in its liquid, solid, and vapor forms. Additional variables being measured include radiative energy fluxes, aerosols, vegetation cover on the land, phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter in the oceans, and air, land, and water temperatures.\n\nTo learn more see Aqua's excerpt from the Earth Science Reference Handbook.\n\nAqua (EOS PM) Project Scientist: Claire L.

Due to fuel limitations, Aqua completed the last of its drag makeup maneuvers in December 2021 and is now in a free-drift mode, slowly descending below the A-Train and drifting to later equatorial crossing times, and lower altitudes.

The possible temporal evolution of Aura’s drift is <15 min through late-2024, ˜30 min by mid-2025, and less an hour by mid-2026.\n\n2023, C-Train Ceased Operations\n\nCALIPSO and CloudSat ceased operations in 2023, ending the C-Train. CALIPSO ended its scientific mission August 1, 2023, after 17 years of operation. The final CALIPSO spacecraft passivation activities were successfully completed on December 15, 2023. Following the passivation of CALIPSO, CNES confirmed that there was no signal from the spacecraft during two ground contacts in Canada and French Guiana. With no more communication, CALIPSO is now decommissioned. CloudSat radar operations ceased on December 20, 2023, bringing to an end a rich 17 year and 8 month history of science observations.\n\n2018, Establishing the C-Train\n\nCloudSat and CALIPSO have taken simultaneous measurements within seconds of each other since they launched together in April 2006. However, on February 22, 2018, CloudSat exited the A-Train following the loss of one of its reaction wheels. CloudSat resumed taking data in the Daytime-Only Operations (DO-Op) mode from a “C-Train” orbit located 16.5 km (~10 mi) below the A-Train on May 7, 2018. Following science recommendation, the decision was made for CALIPSO to join CloudSat in the “C-Train” orbit to resume the joint CALIPSO/CloudSat measurement record. CALIPSO exited the A-Train on September 13, 2018 and joined CloudSat in orbit on September 20, 2018.\n\nSince CALIPSO experiences about twice as much drag as CloudSat, CloudSat will conduct periodic orbit lower maneuvers to maintain a 100s along-track offset with respect to CALIPSO. This positioning will be maintained within about ±8.5 seconds, or about 4km of ground track offset, from CALIPSO.\n\nWhile the orbits of the A-Train and C-Train follow slightly different ground tracks due to differences in altitude, the two constellation tracks intersect each other about every 20 days. This allows simultaneous A-Train/C-Train instrument measurements on a regular basis.\n\nThe Final Member Joins the A-Train\n\nNASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), launched on July 2, 2014, was the final member to join the Afternoon Constellation, or A-Train. The spacecraft is positioned at the front of the A-Train, flying in a sun-synchronous orbit that over flies the ground track of the CloudSat radar and CALIPSO lidar.\n\nGCOM-W1 Successfully Enters the A-Train\n\nThe Afternoon Constellation or “A-Train” welcomed a new member on June 29, 2012 — the Global Change Observation Mission–Water (GCOM-W1) “SHIZUKU” satellite — which was launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on May 18. SHIZUKU successfully executed a series of orbit control maneuvers required to position itself in its control box. It is now positioned in front of Aqua, making it the lead satellite in the constellation. On July 3, 2012, the antenna rotation on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), on SHIZUKU, was increased from a rate of 11 rpm to 40 rpm and it is not acquiring observation data.\n\nHighlight\n\nOur Changing Atmosphere - Discoveries from EOS Aura\n\nAura is NASA’s third large Earth Observing System mission and is dedicated to understanding the changing chemistry of our atmosphere.
