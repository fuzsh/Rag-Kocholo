        "text": "Discusses the usefulness of factor analysis in making cross-cultural comparisons. After noting the limitations of previous efforts to arrive at factors common across cultural groups, a more direct strategy is outlined which involves modifying L. Tucker's (see record 1959-07322-001) interbattery factor technique to yield intergroup factor analysis. Intergroup factor analysis permits the direct solution of \"type\" factors common across cultural groups and those unique within cultural groups. It is argued that the potential value of intergroup factor analysis for cross-cultural research lies in the new questions which this technique may address. (42 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)\n\nOne purpose of communality estimation in factor analysis is to promote factorial invariance, i.e. , to improve the chances of recovering demonstrably related factor structures from diverse sets of variables and samples of subjects. Recognition of this purpose may help to resolve ambiguities that have appeared in efforts to define unique communalities for isolated correlation matrices. The estimation of even approximate values for communality may be well worth the effort as a contribution to factorial invariance. A convenient, programable procedure is described that leads simultaneously to useful estimates of communality and of the number of factors. On the basis of actual data for two samples, properties of the communalities obtained by this procedure are compared with those obtained from a conventional principal axis analysis using diagonal entries of unity. The clinical scales of the MMPI, plus Si, are judged to provide reliable measurement on at least eight orthogonal dimensions, each well‐marked by a different scale. Stable differences exist in the item‐reliabilities of the ten scales studied. Neither of these consistencies in the data for the two samples was available from application of the conventional analysis. Tucker's procedure for examining factor congruence is found to be capable of yielding misleading results in the context of poor communality estimates."
