        "text": "Prior to submission, please carefully read and follow the submission guidelines detailed below. Manuscripts that do not conform to the submission guidelines may be returned without review.\n\nSubmission\n\nThe completion of a submission checklist that signifies that authors have read this material and agree to adhere to the guidelines is required as part of the submission upload process (authors can find this checklist in the \"Additional Information\" section). If you need to include a data transparency appendix, please append this as the last page of your manuscript file. Revisions should also include the data transparency appendix and include any necessary updates based on the revisions.\n\nTo submit to the editorial office of Lillian T. Eby, please submit manuscripts electronically through the Manuscript Submission Portal in Microsoft Word (.docx) or LaTex (.tex) as a zip file with an accompanied Portable Document Format (.pdf) of the manuscript file.\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual and APA’s Brief Guide to Bias-Free and Inclusive Language). APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nLillian T. Eby, editor\n\nDepartment of Psychology\n\nUniversity of Georgia\n\nAthens, GA 30602\n\nGeneral correspondence may be directed to the editor's office.\n\nIn addition to addresses and phone numbers, please supply email addresses and fax numbers, if available, for potential use by the editorial office and later by the production office.\n\nKeep a copy of the manuscript to guard against loss.\n\nManuscripts submitted for publication consideration in the Journal of Applied Psychology are evaluated according to the following criteria:\n\ndegree to which the manuscript fits the mission of the journal as described on the journal website\n\nsignificance of the theoretical, practical and/or methodological contributions\n\nquality of the literature review\n\narticulation and explication of the conceptual rationale, constructs, and psychological processes\n\nrigor of the design and execution of the study\n\nappropriateness of the analysis and interpretation of the results\n\ndiscussion of implications for theory, research, and application\n\nclarity of presentation\n\nManuscripts should be logically organized and clearly written in concise and unambiguous language. The goal of APA primary journals is to publish useful information that is accurate and clear.\n\nThree primary types of articles will be published:\n\nFeature Articles, which are full-length articles that focus on a conceptually or theoretically driven empirical contribution (all research strategies and methods, quantitative and qualitative, are considered) or on a theoretical contribution that can shape future research in applied psychology.\n\nResearch Reports, which are narrower in scope and are limited to no more than 19 manuscript pages (excluding title page, abstract, references, tables, and figures). In determining the length limits of Research Reports, authors should count 25 lines of 12-point text with 1-inch margins as the equivalent of one page.\n\nIntegrative Conceptual Reviews, which are full-length articles that are designed to synthesize relevant literature, extend theoretical development, and propose new directions for future research. Submissions start with a 10-page prospectus that describes the contribution, structure and coverage of the proposed paper and is evaluated by the editorial team. Additional information can be found at the Call for Integrative Conceptual Reviews.\n\nThe review process is the same for Feature Articles and Research Reports. The two types of manuscripts differ only in length, commensurate to different scope of intended contribution. Authors should indicate in the cover letter that they would like the submission considered as a Research Report. However, the action editor (with input from the review team) may suggest that a Feature Article submission be pared down to Research Report length through the review process.\n\nAuthors should refer to recent issues of the journal for approximate length of Feature Articles, Integrative Conceptual Reviews, and Research Reports. (Total manuscript pages divided by three provides an estimate of total printed pages.)\n\nThe journal also has a history of publishing Monographs on occasion. Monographs are substantial and significant contributions (as determined by the editorial team).\n\nIn addition, the journal occasionally publishes Commentaries (see Kozlowski, S.W.J. (2011). Comment policy. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96 (2), 231–232). (PDF, 36KB)\n\nThe Journal of Applied Psychology also publishes replications that add important value and insight to the literature. Submissions should include “A Replication of XX Study” in the subtitle of the manuscript as well as in the abstract.\n\nJournal of Applied Psychology is now using a software system to screen submitted content for similarity with other published content. The system compares the initial version of each submitted manuscript against a database of 40+ million scholarly documents, as well as content appearing on the open web. This allows APA to check submissions for potential overlap with material previously published in scholarly journals (e.g., lifted or republished material).\n\nAuthor contribution statements using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) stipulates that “authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study.” In the spirit of transparency and openness, Behavioral Neuroscience has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors will be asked to identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to this taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an Author Contributions Statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nCRediT includes 14 contributor roles, as described below:\n\nConceptualization: Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\nData curation: Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse.\n\nFormal analysis: Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.\n\nFunding acquisition: Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\nInvestigation: Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\nMethodology: Development or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\nProject administration: Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\nResources: Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\nSoftware: Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\nSupervision: Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\nValidation: Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\nVisualization: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\nWriting—original draft: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\nWriting—review and editing: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision—including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author. Not all roles will be applicable to a particular scholarly work.\n\nMasked review policy\n\nThe journal will accept submissions in masked review format only.\n\nAuthor names and affiliations should appear in the cover letter but not anywhere on the manuscript. Authors should make every reasonable effort to see that the manuscript itself contains no clues to their identities, including grant numbers, names of institutions providing IRB approval, self-citations, and links to online repositories for data, materials, code, or preregistrations (e.g., create a view-only link for a project). Manuscripts not in masked format will be returned to authors for revision prior to being reviewed.\n\nPlease ensure that the final version for production includes a byline and full author note for typesetting.\n\nOriginal use of data\n\nAPA requires that all data in their published articles be an original use. Along with determining the appropriateness of any submission, the editorial team (editor and reviewers) also have a role in determining what constitutes \"original use.\" Key to this determination is the extent to which reported data and results serve to promote cumulative knowledge and insight to the literature.\n\nIn order to preserve masked review, authors should include a data transparency appendix in the manuscript which details how and where the data collected were (or potentially will soon be) used. Any previous, concurrent, or near future use of data (and/or sample) reported in a submitted manuscript must be brought to the editorial team's attention (i.e., any paper(s) previously published, in press, or currently under review at any journals, as well as any paper(s) that foreseeably will be under review before an editorial decision is made on the current submitted manuscript). This includes variables that overlap as well as those that may not overlap with those in the submitted article. Authors may also put in any other clarifying information they wish, as long as it can be done anonymously. Any identifying information, such as authors' names or titles of journal articles that the authors wish to share can be included in the cover letter where only the editorial staff will see it.\n\nWhen providing information in the paper itself and/or in the appendix, authors should ensure there is enough detail for reviewers to assess whether data presented constitute original use and unique knowledge and insights.\n\nFor more information on APA's data policies, please see \"Duplicate and Piecemeal Publication of Data,\" APA Publication Manual (Section 1.16, 7th Edition, p. 17–20).\n\nAccess data transparency appendix examples.\n\nTransparency and openness\n\nAPA endorses the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines by a community working group in conjunction with the Center for Open Science (Nosek et al. 2015). All articles submitted to the Journal of Applied Psychology must, at a minimum, adhere to the TOP levels as noted in the list below, which details the domains of research planning and reporting, the TOP level required, and a brief description of the journal’s policy. Submissions that do not include (1) qualitative, quantitative, or simulated data, (2) a systematic narrative or meta-analytic review of the literature, or (3) re-analysis of existing data must also include a statement that TOP guidelines related to data sharing, code sharing, hypotheses preregistration, analysis preregistration, and materials sharing are not applicable and why. All articles must comply with the TOP guideline of citing any materials not original to the submitted work.\n\nCitation: Level 2, Requirement—All data, program code, and other methods not original to the submitted work (developed by others) must be cited in the text and listed in the References section.\n\nData Transparency: Level 1, Disclosure—Article states whether or not the raw and/or processed data on which study conclusions are based are posted to a trusted repository and, if so, how to access the data.\n\nAnalytic Methods (Code) Transparency: Level 1, Disclosure—Article states whether or not the computer code or syntax needed to reproduce analyses in an article is posted to a trusted repository and if so, how to access it.\n\nResearch Materials Transparency: Level 1, Disclosure—Article states whether materials described in the Method section are posted to a trusted repository and, if so, how to access them. It is strongly encouraged to include online supplements for study materials.\n\nDesign and Analysis Transparency (Reporting Standards): Level 2, Requirement—Article must follow the Journal of Applied Psychology methods checklist and all relevant aspects of the APA Style Journal Reporting Standards (JARS).\n\nStudy Preregistration: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether the study design and (if applicable) hypotheses of any of the work reported was preregistered and, if so, how to access it. Access to a masked version of the preregistered materials must be available at submission via stable link or supplemental material.\n\nAnalysis Plan Preregistration: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether any of the work reported was preregistered with an analysis plan and, if so, how to access it. Access to a masked version of the preregistered analysis plan must be available at submission via stable link or supplemental material.\n\nAuthors must include a brief (one short paragraph) subsection in the method description titled “Transparency and openness” that indicates how they complied with the TOP guidelines adopted at the Journal of Applied Psychology.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe describe our sampling plan, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study, and we adhered to the Journal of Applied Psychology methodological checklist. All data, analysis code, and research materials are available at [stable masked link to repository]. Data were analyzed using R, version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020) and the package ggplot, version 3.2.1 (Wickham, 2016). This study’s design and its analysis were not preregistered.\n\nWe describe our sampling plan, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study, and we adhered to the Journal of Applied Psychology methodological checklist. Analysis code and research materials are available at [stable masked link to repository]. Data are not available due to their proprietary nature. Data were analyzed using R, version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020) and the package ggplot, version 3.2.1 (Wickham, 2016). The study design was not preregistered because the data were collected for an applied selection project. The hypotheses and analysis were preregistered [masked OSF link].\n\nData and materials\n\nAuthors must state whether data and study materials are available and, if so, where to access them. Recommended repositories include APA’s repository on the Open Science Framework (OSF), or authors can access a full list of other recommended repositories. Trusted repositories adhere to policies that make data discoverable, accessible, usable, and preserved for the long term. Trusted repositories also assign unique and persistent identifiers. Original materials that are not in English do not require translation.\n\nIn a subsection at the end of the method subsection titled “Transparency and openness,” specify whether and where the data and material will be available or include a statement noting that they are not available.\n\nFor example:\n\nAll data have been made publicly available at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nData for this study are not available because they are proprietary.\n\nData for this study are not available because they protected under HIPAA.\n\nData for this study are not available because they protected under FERPA.\n\nMaterials for this study can be found [in the Appendix; in the online supplement].\n\nMaterials for this study can be found at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [masked persistent URL or DOI].\n\nMaterials for this study are not available because they are not owned by the authors.\n\nPlease refer to the APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) regarding APA guidelines on data retention and sharing (section 1.14) as well as the APA Ethics Code regarding conditions and exceptions to data sharing (e.g., 2.01 Boundaries of Competence, 8.14 Sharing Research Data for Verification).\n\nInformation regarding reproducing material from previously published works\n\nIf you have reproduced full scales or other material (e.g., tables, figures, experimental materials) from previously published articles, please note that it is your responsibility to ensure that doing so does not constitute a copyright infringement with the original publisher. You can find information on fair use of previously published material and on APA’s permissions policy in the Permissions Alert Form for APA Authors.\n\nAnalytic methods (code)\n\nFor submissions with quantitative or simulation analytic methods, state whether the study analysis code is posted to a trusted repository and if so, how to access them, including their location and any limitations on use. Trusted repositories adhere to policies that make data discoverable, accessible, usable, and preserved for the long term. Trusted repositories also assign unique and persistent identifiers. Recommended repositories include APA’s repository on the Open Science Framework (OSF), or authors can access a full list of other recommended repositories.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe code behind this analysis/simulation has been made publicly available at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nThe code behind this analysis/simulation is not available because it is proprietary.\n\nAnalysis code is available at [stable masked link to trusted repository], except for the predictor scoring algorithm which is proprietary.\n\nPreregistration of studies and analysis plans\n\nPreregistration of studies and specific hypotheses can be a useful tool for making strong theoretical claims. Likewise, preregistration of analysis plans can be useful for distinguishing confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Investigators are encouraged to preregister their studies and analysis plans prior to conducting the research via a publicly accessible registry system (e.g., OSF, ClinicalTrials.gov, or other trial registries in the WHO Registry Network).\n\nThere are many available preregistration forms (e.g., OSF, ClinicalTrials.gov, or other trial registries in the WHO Registry Network). There are many preregistration templates available, including the Preregistration for Quantitative Research in Psychology template (Bosnjak et al., 2022). Completed preregistration forms should be time-stamped.\n\nArticles must state whether or not any work was preregistered and, if so, where to access the preregistration. Preregistrations must be available to reviewers; authors should submit a masked copy via stable link or supplemental material. Links in the method section should be replaced with an identifiable copy on acceptance.\n\nFor example:\n\nThis study’s design was preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study’s design and hypotheses were preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study’s analysis plan was preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study was not preregistered.\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association . Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the 7th edition).\n\nReview APA's Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines before submitting your article.\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nMethodological reporting guidelines and checklists\n\nIn an effort to enhance transparency, reproducibility, and replicability, we have developed methodological reporting guidelines and checklists for the Journal of Applied Psychology (PDF, 166KB) that authors should follow (as appropriate for their submitted work) when preparing manuscripts for submission to the Journal of Applied Psychology. Authors should also consult the APA Style Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research.\n\nAuthors should review the new Journal Article Reporting Standards for Race, Ethnicity, and Culture (JARS–REC). Meant for all authors, regardless of research topic, JARS–REC include standards for all stages of research and manuscript writing.\n\nFor more, see the Guidance for Authors sections of the table (PDF, 184KB).\n\nBelow are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.\n\nDisplay equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn online supplemental material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the text of the article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's insert table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nAcademic writing and English language editing services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting supplemental materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the PsycArticles® database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the references section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal article\n\nMcCauley, S.

Specifically, APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.\n\nAuthors are required to state in writing that they have complied with APA ethical standards in the treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment.\n\nDownload Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles Form (PDF, 26KB)\n\nThe APA Ethics Office provides the full Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct electronically on its website in HTML, PDF, and Word format.
