Haidet Athletics Hall of Fame\n\nBack To Hall of Fame Back To Hall of Fame\n\nChoose a Hall Of Fame Member:\n\nLindsey (Spoden) VandenBerg\n\nClass\n\n2004\n\nInduction\n\n2012\n\nSport(s)\n\nVolleyball\n\nLindsey Vanden Berg is starting her eighth season as the top assistant for the Panther volleyball program after spending two seasons as the program's director of operations.\n\nVanden Berg, formerly Lindsey Spoden, was a standout player for the Panthers from 2000-03, becoming the first-ever UWM player to earn Division I All-America honors. In fact, her play on the court during her time as a Panther has earned her a spot in the Bud K. Haidet UWM Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nA four-time All-Horizon League honoree, Vanden Berg was the American Volleyball Coaches' Association Midwest Region Freshman of the Year in 2000 and an honorable mention AVCA All-American in 2003. She also earned all-region honors twice and was the co-player of the year in the Horizon League in 2003.\n\nVanden Berg is second in school history in assists, fourth in digs and UWM's career leader in aces. She helped the Panthers to three NCAA Tournament berths and a pair of league titles during her stellar four-year career.\n\nIn her assistant coaching role, Vanden Berg has taken on more on-court responsibilities while also working extensively on the Panthers' recruiting efforts. Vanden Berg's spot on the staff also puts an alum of the program in a crucial role on the staff.\n\nVanden Berg started her coaching career by working with the Milwaukee Sting Volleyball Club before returning to UWM in 2005.\n\nA native of Alexandria, Minn., she married former Panther baseball player John Vanden Berg in the summer of 2007. The couple has a three-year-old daughter, Brooke and a son Cole, who was born in December 2013.\n\nBack To Hall of Fame"
