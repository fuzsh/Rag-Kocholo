Medals awarded to a World War II pilot who risked his life to drop the French Tricolour over the Arc de Triomphe in occupied Paris in 1942 are being auctioned.

Wing Commander Ken Gatward, who lived in Essex, first flew his Bristol Beaufighter down the Champs-Elysees in the operation to boost French morale.

He then machine-gunned the Gestapo headquarters.

His eight medals are expected to make Â£8,000 at auction on Friday.

Colchester auctioneer's Reeman Dansie are auctioning the items following the death of Wing Cdr Gatward's widow.

They had lived near Frinton-on-Sea and Wing Cdr Gatward died in 1998, aged 84.

In a Bristol Beaufighter of RAF Coastal Command, Wing Cdr Gatward and his crew flew over the main streets of the capital at the level of third-floor windows.
