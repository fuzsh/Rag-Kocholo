        "text": "The total number of female personnel supporting SOE in the Far East by July 1945 was 723. This page is dedicated to them, for without them, Force 136 would not have been able to do what it did. A great deal of their work was concerned with Burma, as that was where SOE’s largest operational commitment to the war against Japan was focused.\n\nOf the 723 women employed by SOE, 449 belonged to the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, or FANY; 274 remained civilians.\n\nAt 368, just over half of the 723 were employed by the Signals establishment. During 1945, they were responsible for 1,422,356 cipher groups going into and coming out of the field from approximately 183 operational W/T sets across Southeast Asia. There were over 50 W/T sets in Burma alone. Women working as cipherettes often worked 12 hour shifts, ensuring that messages to and from operations were sent and received 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nThe remaining 355 women were distributed on clerical and secretarial roles.\n\nMaiden name will be provided where it is given, and ‘(Mrs)’ inserted after surname if already married but no maiden name given. Where there is no ‘nee’ or ‘(Mrs)’, assume it is Miss.\n\nIn the wrong file! Which of the following ladies is she?\n\nLiving in Calcutta in the 1940s\n\nWant to know more about living in Calutta in the 1940s? I chanced upon this fabulous website: Calcutta1940s\n\nLots of the women below lived, and in some cases died, in Calcutta during their time with the Special Operations Executive. The website gives some precious insight into life in the great city.\n\nAdam (Mrs), I, B/B392\n\nAdams, Audrey Beatrice: born 8 August 1925 n Leamington Spa, Audrey was ‘put through the cards’ (PTC) in November 1944. By December she was working as a book-keeper in SOE, awaiting a ship to India.\n\nAudrey attended Leamington College for Girls from 1935 to 1941. She then worked in a clerical role for Warwickshire County Council from 1941-1944.\n\nThere is nothing in her file to indicate she actually made it to India!\n\nHS 9/7/7\n\nAhern, Margaret Joan: born 2 October 1914 in Montreal, Canada, Margaret was vetted by MI5 in June 1944. From July she was employed by SOE as a FANY coder. In Septmber she left the UK for New Delhi where she worked until she signed off, in India, on New Year’s Day 1946.\n\nHS 9/15/2\n\nAllanson, Evelyn, nee Elliott: born 6 May 1913 in London, Evelyn joined SOE in September 1943 to work as a Registry Clerk. Before SOE, her MI5 trace shows she worked as a confidential secretary for a private detective from 1932-1940; as a secretary for the Air Ministry in Aberdeen 1941-1942; and in censorship for the Postal & Telegraph Office 1942-1943.\n\nIn September 1944, after working for a year at London HQ, she left for India. Evelyn finally signed off on 3 June 1946.\n\nHS 9/22/10\n\nAnderson, Doreen Hibbert: born 30 September 1923 in South Shields, Doreen was vetted for possible employment with SOE in August 1944. Taken on as a FANY to be employed as a secretary, Doreen was attached to London HQ pending overseas posting. She left the UK on 10 October, although her destination is not specified, nor is her return date. On 5 September 1945 she left for India – which is a very late and unusual date. She returned to the UK and signed off from SOE on 24 April 1946.\n\nHS 9/32/8\n\nAndrews, Enid Marya: born 9 March 1918 in Preston Park, Brighton, Enid was checked for possible SOE work in September 1944. She was employed as a shorthand typist at London HQ pending an overseas posting from November 1944. On 7 December, she left for India.\n\nHS 9/36/5\n\nArcher, Margaret Paterson: born 8 August 1916 in Glasgow, Margaret appears to be one of the very few highly educated women to join SOE. She had an MA in law with an LLB, and had been working as a law clerk for three years prior to becoming a FANY in SOE. Among her interests, she listed mountaineering and lecturing, as well as being proficient in both French and German. She joined SOE on 13 October 1944, and was trained as a Control Clerk that month at STS 52. She left the UK for India on 7 December 1944, and signed off from SOE on 27 March 1946.\n\nHS 9/49/5\n\nArmstrong, Iris Fairburn: born 30 December 1916 in Singapore, Iris was ‘put through th cards’ in September 1943. Taken on as a secretary in the same month, Iris left for Cairo on 14 November. Her date of return is not recorded, but her next posting was India from April 1945. She signed off from SOE on the fourth anniversary of the fall of her birth place.\n\nHer employment card reveals that before SOE she worked in the India Office in Whitehall, and that from Jun 1945 she was woking as a ‘cypherette’. Furthermore, in October 1945 she was allowed compassionate leave for six days to see family who had been repatriated from internment in Singapore. Iris had been evacuated from Singapore in January 1942; she had finished her education at the Raffles School for Girls and been working as a hairdresser since 1935. The Kempeitei made the school their HQ in Singapore.\n\nHS 9/52/5\n\nArmstrong, Sylvia Marion Louise: born 11 August 1921 in Singapore, Sylvia was ‘put through the cards’ in September 1943 witha view to being employed as a FANY clerk. By November she was headed for Cairo, with her sister who had also joined SOE. The date for arrival back in the UK is never given for those females who went to the Mediterranean, but on Valentine’s Day 1945 she left the UK for India. She continued to work for SOE until November 1945.\n\nBefore the war, Sylvia had attended the Raffles Girls School, 1927-1937, and then Pitmans College 1937-38. Between 1938 and 1943 she is recorded as employed as a shorthand typist, however she had been a Sergeant in the Medical Auxiliary Service in Singapore during 1941 until evacuated from Singapore on 6 February 1942. Her file also indicates she was in India for 13 months awaiting passage to Britain, leaving in June 193.\n\nUnusually, Sylvia indicated on her SOE form that she could box, along with running, cycling, skiing, swimming, riding, and driving. Iris Armstrong above was her sister.\n\nHS 9/53/1\n\nAshley, Winifred: born 9 April 1921 in Cardiff, Ashley was a FANY employed from February 1943 as a W/T operator. She left for India in October 1944 and was signed off from SOE in January 1946 after returning to the UK. Prior to SOE, Winifred was employed as a dressmaker and cashier. Her brother was Sapper John Thomas Ashley, who was indicated on her MI5 trace as ‘missing Singapore’. It appears that this was correct as he is listed HERE.\n\nHS 9/57/3\n\nBailey, Claire Elizabeth, nee Wilson: born 2 March 1914 in Delamere, Cheshire, Claire was working as a Matron-Housekeeper at the Elmslie School in Maidenhead when approached for SOE employment. Previous to this, she had worked at the National Provincial Bank for five years.\n\nEmployed as a FANY, Claire left for India in September 1944 after a spell at STS 46 where she had done administrative work. She signed of from SOE in September 1945 after coming back to the UK.\n\nHer husband, Alan Curtis Bailey was imprisoned in Stalag Luft 3 according to Claire’s MI5 trace dated June 1944. According to https://allspitfirepilots.org/pilots/2761-alan-bailey he joined the RAF in 1939 and flew Spitfires with 145 Sqn. According to https://www.rafcommands.com/database/hurricanes/details.php?uniq=N2711 his Hurricane was shot down in May 1940 south west of Dunkirk.\n\nHS 9/72/2\n\nBailey, Elizabeth Helen, nee Shirreffs: born 28 January 1907 in Stellenbeech (most likely meant to read Stellenbosch), South Africa, Elizabeth joined the FANY in Cairo. She came to the UK in March 1945 and was earmarked for employment as an office manager in India. She left for India in May 1945 and continued with SOE until May 1946.\n\nBefore SOE, Elizabeth had spent nine years teaching in the Southern Rhodesian Education Department, two years on the Johannesburg stock exchange, and staff manager in ‘various manufacturing concerns’. Her parents were both originally from Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nHS 9/72/7\n\nBailey, Norah: born 16 August 1916 in Ireland, Norah was recruited by SOE in Delhi during November 1944. She went to work in a clerical role in Q Section in Delhi until she resigned on 15 December 1945.\n\nHS 9/73/1\n\nBaker, Elizabeth, nee Bradley: born 29 September 1911 in Chilwall, Nottinghamshire, Elizabeth was ‘put through the cards’ and interviewed in July 1944. Employed by SOE from August, by September she was off to India. Her employment card indicates that he was a stenographer for Malayan Country Section, so she worked in Colombo from December 1944. She ended up in Kuala Lumpur in November 1945.\n\nBefore joining SOE, Elizabeth worked for the American Embassy, and as a personal secretary for a national coal scheme from 1941-44.\n\nHer husband married in 1936, was in the RAF and recorded as being in Canada in 1944.\n\nHS 9/77/9\n\nBampton, Pamela Valpy: born 20 October 1925 in London, Pamela worked for SOE from June 1944 until December 1945.\n\nStll only eighteen when considered for SOE work, her school, Oak Hall in Haslemere, was asked for a reference. Apparently she had been ‘a thoroughly satisfactory pupil, and a nice girl.’ She left the school at sixteen, so they couldn’t say much more than that! From school she went to Mrs Hoster’s Secretarial College, from where her reference described her as ‘a good intelligent student.’ These qualities continued in SOE, for in June 1945 she was recommended for promotion which was supported because she was ‘an excellent secretary’.\n\nHer father was Colonel John Augustus Hamilton Bampton, MBE, who served in the Indian Army at GHQ in Delhi during the war. Lots of hits on the London Gazette for him.\n\nHS 9/83/2\n\nBanks, Elizabeth Amy: born 6 April 1921 in Newcastle-on-Tyne, Elizabeth was employed as a clerk with SOE from 4 June 1945. Her prior employment was with the National Fire Service, where she was ‘trustworthy and conscientious.’ She was registered as a WAAF.\n\nShe left for India on 10 July, and worked in Colombo as a clerk. She left for the UK on 17 November, arriving on 12 December 1945.\n\nHS 9/84/6\n\nBannerman, Eve Mary: born 12 March 1921 in London, Eve was a British Red Cross Nurse when she was approached by SOE in September 1942. To be employed as a FANY, Eve was at STS 54 as a W/T operator from October 1942. In September 1944 she left the UK for India, returning in the new year of 1946.\n\nEve’s father was Lt.Col.

Muriel was employed as a typist in India from 31 August 1943. Prior to this, she had worked for four years as a teacher in Rangoon after attending Rangoon university. She worked in Delhi, Kandy, and Calcutta, as well as in Rangoon from 12 October 1945 until release from service on 15 December 1945.\n\nHS 9/93/7\n\nBarr, Kathleen: born 18 September 1903 in Dublin, Kathleen is recorded as having been recruited locally, ie in India. It looks as though she was a WAC(I) working in a cipher office in Rawalpindi. After joining SOE, she was at Chaklala, near Rawalpindi, home of the RAF parachute school where SOE personnel were trained to jump. From April 1945, she was in Calcutta. Her employment card shows her next of kin as ‘Major T. Barr. (Husband)’\n\nHS 9/94/1\n\nBarraclough, Joan: born 15 June 1923 in Teneriffe, Joan was security checked just after her 20th birthday. From September 1943 she was employed as a FANY W/T operator, and a year later she left for India. She signed off from SOE on her return to the UK in December 1945.\n\nHS 9/94/3\n\nBarritt, Kathleen: born 5 August 1923 in Nelson, Lancashire, Kathleen was only security checked at the end of April 1945. She was employed as FANY and sent out to India to work in ‘codes ‘a week before the atomic bomb was first dropped, ending the war. She returned to the UK in February 1946.\n\nHS 9/95/6\n\nBartlet, Pauline Cecile, B/B734: born 9 August 1917 in Ceylon, Pauline left Ceylon in May 1928 to go to boarding school in Eastbourne. In 1935, her schooling complete, she returned to Ceylon. From October 1940 until December 1943 she worked as a Cipherette in HM Naval Office in Ceylon. She then worked for the Ministry of Economic Warfare in the same role at Meerut in India.\n\nIn March 1944 she went to England ‘for personal reasons’, and while in London she joined SOE. What she did between March 1944 and 29 June 1945 when she left for India remains a mystery. Back out east, she was posted to Trincomalee as a Cipherette. The second half of September was spent ill with fever, finally signing off from SOE on 29 November 1945 at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.\n\nHS 9/97/8\n\nBates (Mrs), Mabel Evelyn: born 23 February 1899 in Dunfermline, Scotland, Mabel was recruited locally inn Calcutta. She was working as a secretary and stenographer for Nestle’s Milk Co. Ltd inn Hare Street, Calcutta. She was ‘Secretary to AQ’ from 10 April 1944, earning Rs500 p/m. On 11 May 1945, just after coming back to work after ten days compassionate leave, she managed to break her ankle and was on sick leave until 27 June. She signed off from SOE employment on 15 March 1946.\n\nHS 9/102/7\n\nBean (Mrs) R.M., B/B161: No personnel file exists for Mrs Bean.\n\nCadet/Ensign Beck, Dorothy, nee Mudd: born on 8 November 1915 in Grimsby, Yorkshire, Dorothy was ‘put through the cards’ in March 1944 and employed as a FANY from 22 May. She left for India on 9 June 1944.\n\nDorothy ended up being at the centre of quite a tricky position for SOE to be in. It appears that she only joined the FANY and SOE in order to get posted to India and be with her husband, Lt.Col. Beck who was employed at GHQ. When she arrived in India, she did just a few days work, went sick, and then refused to go back to her duties. She claimed that her contract had not been kept, and that she had not been properly looked after. There was talk of deporting her, but it is unclear if this happened. There was lots of talk of dropping the case because SOE did not want a public court case on security grounds, but at the same time they did not want to encourage any more of this behaviour.\n\nHS 9/111/6\n\nBeck, Muriel Ellen, B/B766: born 3 November 1911 in Sydenham, London, Muriel was employed as a junior secretary in Meerut from 11 December 1943. She was recruited in India, where her father, Major Frederick George Beck, was a Garrison Engineer in Abbottabad. She remained with SOE until 28 February 1946.\n\nMuriel worked from employment until 24 September 1945 with just one week off in June 1944. She ended up as ‘Secretary to D.A.D.M.S.’ (Deputy Assistant Director, Medical services).\n\nHS 9/112/1\n\nFlight Officer Beggs, Joyce Mary: born 6 June 1918 in Armagh, Northern Ireland, Joyce was a WAAF from June 1940. She had graduated from Queen’s University, Belfast with a degree in Commercial Science. She recorded ‘motor rallying’ as one of her hobbies and interests. She was commissionend in October 1941 and went into intelligence, attending a course at Harrow for two weeks. Joyce was then posted as First Intelligence Officer to 138 Squadron at RAF Tempsford.\n\nShe joined SOE in May 1943 and was placed ‘in charge of the Air Operations Room at S.O.E. Headquarters’ where she remained for the next two years. She was also liaison officer between the SOE country sections and the RAF. She was recommended for the MBE for this work in May 1945. In September 1945 she went out to Ceylon as GSO III Ops, retaining her current rank. In January 1946 she was posted back to the RAF.\n\nHS 9/114/8\n\nBenbow, Frances Elizabeth: born 27 July 1911 in London, Frances was working at the War Office when she was accepted by SOE for employment overseas. The War Office refused to let her go or accept her resignation, but it seems SOE prevailed. Employed as a cipher clerk, Frances went first to the Middle East, and then to India in April 1945. She signed off in March 1946. Before the war, she had been a dress maker.\n\nHS 9/121/4\n\nBenjamin, S.W.A.C., B/B379: There is no personnel file for Miss Benjamin.\n\nBentley, Mary Ann, B/B112: Mary was one of the first women to be employed by SOE in the Far East, commencing as a secretary for the Oriental Mission in Singapore from 23 June 1941. She evidently escaped Singapore and was transferred to the India Mission on 6 April 1942 when her codename changed from 0.157 to B/B112.\n\nThere is no date of birth recorded for Mary, but she was 45 in 1941, and her nationality is noted as Australian. Prior to SOE, Mary had worked for sixteen years as a private secretry to the manager of Strong & Co. in Kobe, Japan. She was employed by SOE in Delhi and then Poona at EWS(I) from November 1944 as a cashier and book-keeper, and paid Rs.700 p/m. She reported to Australia in May 1946.\n\nHS 9/130/1\n\nBett, Pleasance Margaret Archdale, B/B925: born 11 June 1915 in Thornham, Norfolk, Pleasance was a VAD before joining SOE in November 1942. She was taken on as a FANY working as a coder at STS 52. Pleasance left for India on 26 March 1944, returning to the UK in late 1945 where she was signed off in December. On her MI5 trace, it shows her brother, Henry Bourdillon Bett, was a POW at Oflag VI B.\n\nIn 1984, Pleasance published her autobiography, ‘Mouse to aTiger‘. She describes why she left the VADs for SOE, and how she felt that her work at STS 53 at Grendon Underwood ‘was the real thing’ and she felt like she was doing her bit for the war. Going out to India in 1944, the conditions on the boat are described in detail, as are her travels in India. She spent all her time in India with Captain Elizabeth Broad, taking every opportunity to explore and see the world ‘at HM Government’s expense.’\n\nIn India and Ceylon, Pleasance was responsible mostly for setting up camps for the FANYs who followed her. Describing her W/T work: ‘[t]he coding was dull as the sense of urgency was gone’ compared to working for F Section.\n\nObituary\n\nAncestry\n\nHS 9/141/7\n\nBeyts, Ruby (nee Scott-Elliot), B/B921: born 23 July 1911 in Dumfries, Scotland, Ruby was ‘put through the cards’ in November 1943. Her redacted file shows that her aunt and cousin were being watched by the censor, but ‘why’ is covered up. Employed as a secretary from 31 January 1944, Ruby left for India on 26 March 1944. In India, she was employed in Meerut as a Cipherette; her record shows she resigned on 6 March 1945. Her husband (married 1940) was Brigadier Geoffrey Herbert Bruno Beyts, 3/6 Rajputana Rifles. Beyts was also in Force 136, as Chief of Staff for the commander, Colin Mackenzie.\n\nHer father was Lt.Col. Charles Reginald Scott-Elliot (also Indian Army), and her grandfather was General Charles Scott-Elliot.\n\nHS 9/143/5\n\nPam on the left, 1945.

She left for India on 18 July 1944, to be employed as a secretary. She worked in Calcutta in the War Office from August 1944.\n\nHer references describe her as very discreet for her age, based on her employment in the War Office Room 055 from August 1940 until joining SOE. In November 1945, she signed a form breaking her contract and repatriation to the UK in order to go and work in Singapore for CICB. She continued to work for MI5 until at least 1953 as a security liaison officer in Burma and Hong Kong.\n\nHS 9/1614/7\n\nBillings, Sylvia Daisy, nee Evans: born 3 February 1912 in Portslade, Sussex, Sylvia was a FANY.

She had been working as a retail manager in various London shops for the last thirteen years.\n\nShe left the UK for India in September 1944, as a FANY. After returning to the UK and signing off from SOE in August 1945, Maisie went to Germany to work with the Allied Control Commission in Hamburg until April 1947.\n\nHS 9/155/1\n\nBirtwistle, Pamela Helen: born 25 August 1922 in Longho near Blackburn, Pamela was an agricultural worker before joining SOE. Her MI5 trace came back with a possible link to a known Fascist, but the details have been redacted. Once this was ruled out, she was a coder at STS 53C from 4 August 1944 before leaving for India in September. She was signed off after her return to the UK on 17 April 1946.\n\nHS 9/157/2 Note incorrect spelling of ‘Birtwistle’ as ‘Birtwhistle’ on the archive’s catalogue.\n\nBissett, Lilla (Mrs): born 26 December 1903 in Nazirabad, Lilla was recruited locally in April 1944.

She had been educated at the relatively new Providence High School in Wood Green between 1918-1923.\n\nIt appears that unless she could get an overseas posting, Gwendoline did not want to leave the bank. Initially earmarked for a November convoy to the Middle East, she started as a secretary on 6 March 1944. On 5 May she left for India and ended up working as a senior secretary in Colombo from 31 July 1944.

Her PF does not mention going to work for the India Mission as a coder, but her name is on a list of women in a separate file who were due to go. She is recorded as ‘signed off’ in July 1945, which may indicate no service in the Far East.\n\nHS 9/189/6\n\nBoyd-Walker (Mrs), G., B/B156: Mrs Boyd-Walker has no surviving Personnel File.\n\nBox, Irene Mabel: born 18 May 1922 in Cardiff, Irene was ‘put through the cards’ for possible employment as a switchboard operator in September 1944.

She left Ceylon on 31 August 1945, probably to be reunited with her husband, Captain James Howard Burchett, who is recorded as as POW on her employment card. Her UK home was in Mon’s Risborough, Buckinghamshire.

She fractured her ankle in October 1945 while on annual leave.\n\nMary’s MI5 trace shows that she was married to Lieutenant ‘Donald McKay Burn (deceased)’, but he is not listed on the CWGC website for either war.

She was head-hunted by SOE for the specific job of working as an instructor ‘in special method of identification of Agent’s morse.’ Two months after accepting this role, Catherine was granted an honorary commission on 26 July 1944.\n\nIn December 1944, Catherine left for India, where she worked for SOE until resigning her commission in October 1945. She had been ‘selected to go to India and Australia to organise and establish the Fingerprinting Section and to select and train personnel for this purpose.’ The job was considered important enough for the rank of G.S.O.3:\n\n‘This airwoman is personally responsible for developing a device which has been invented by her uncle and which has proved to be of immense value to our Signals Section. She has been made head of the Department, having under her several assistants and it is necessary for her to be of officer’s status.’\n\nCatherine’s father was Lt.Col. Donald Cameron OBE, MC, previously Cameron Highlanders but by 1943 he was serving with the Australian military. The family home wasin Tasmania. Catherine was educated in Australia and at the Unniversity of Melbourne.\n\nShe married Major John Temple Harington, DSO, MBE.\n\nCatherine died in Scotland on 16 July 1997.\n\nHS 9/257/6\n\nCampbell, Kathleen, nee Wilson: born 22 September 1908 in West Hartlepool, Kathleen was recruited by SOE in August 1941. She was educated at St. Leonards School in Fife, and then she took on various secretarial roles until SOE recruited her in Scotland. She went to work for L Section until 1943 when she was posted to Force 133 in Egypt, travelling via West Africa.\n\nThe date of return to the UK is missing, but next was India, signing her contract on 26 March 1945. She went to work as a secretary Grade A in Colombo, Ceylon, for Malayan Country Section. Her pay was Rs400 p/m. By 5 November 1945, she was in Kuala Lumpur, being paid Rs450.\n\nHS 9/261/2\n\nCardon-Noad, P.C., B/B166: No file has so far been located\n\nCarpenter, Gwenda Mary Lant, B/B770: born 3 June 1924 in Calcutta, Gwenda was recruited in Calcutta on 8 November 1943 to be a cipherette. By 1945, she was working in Q Ops Packing at Rs300 p/m. In August 1944 she was sick with Dengue Fever. Between joining SOE and her release in January 1946, Gwenda enjoyed a total of five weeks leave.\n\nHer father worked for Bird & Company, founded in 1864 by Captain Samuel Bird to supply labour for ‘infrastructure projects’ in India.\n\nHS 9/267/3\n\nCarpenter, Letitia Bruce: born 2 April 1921 in Aldershot, Letitia was first ‘put through the cards’ in March 1943, but by May that year was still ‘Not employed.’ She was a typist in the War Office from 1940-43, so perhaps she was finally brough on-board as a FANY late that year, for she sailed for India on 24 March 1944. She was signed off ‘on Compassionate grounds’ on 25 May 1945 after returning to the UK.\n\nHS 9/267/6\n\nCarter (Mrs), Dorothy Joyce., B/B894: born 22 April 1918 in Auckland, New Zealand, Dorothy joined SOE in April 1944. Recruited in India, Dorothy was a secretary in Bombay. She spoke Malay. She left for the UK on 17 June 1945.\n\nDorothy is recorded as a widower when she joined SOE. Her MI5 trace shows her husband was Captain Reginald Carter of the 1st Battalion the Malay Regiment.\n\nDorothy Grenier had sailed for Malaya from Southampton onboard the Royal Dutch Mailship C.Huygens in October 1936. At just nineteen years old, she met and fell in love with Reginald Carter, a man nine years her senior. They were married in Malaya, where Reg worked for the Kedah Rubber Company in Selangor.\n\nWhile Dorothy managed to escape from Malaya to India when war came, it appears that her husband managed to leave Singapore after the surrender onboard the Ban Ho Guan, but the boat was sunk by a Japanese submarine on 28 February or 1 March 1942. Dorothy did not give up trying to find out what happened to her husband:\n\nCARTER – “…If you will refer to your files you will note that I informed you I had reason to believe my husband left Padang bound for Java on the night of the 27th February 1942. I have since ascertained that a ship named the “BHG” left for Java that same night and was sunk by the Japanese on 1st March 1942…. Since the Japanese surrender all my attempts to trace my husband have been in vain. Although there is no positive proof that he was on the “BHG” it seems highly probable that he was…( letter 3 November 1945 from Mrs. Joyce Carter to Casualties Branch, War Office ,London)\n\nThis is somewhat verified by a direct record of ‘Reggie’ Carter reaching Padang and boarding\n\nthe ‘BHG’ from the memoirs of Donald Bruce –Smith (who had been on the “SS.\n\nKuala”) who was a friend and had known him in Malaya, “… Joyce and Reggie\n\nCarter were on a rubber estate in the Krian district where I was posted on my\n\narrival in Malaya. Joyce was the lady’s tennis champion in Malay[a] and Reggie\n\nbecame a regular army officer with the Malayan Regiment shortly before the\n\nJapanese invasion of Malaya…Reggie Carter escaped from Singapore after the\n\nceasefire. We had coffee together in Padang one morning and arranged to\n\nrepeat this the following morning. However, he did not keep his appointment and\n\nas a result of my enquiries, I found out that he had sailed in a small boat for Java\n\nduring the night. There had been no word of him since and we concluded that\n\nhe had lost his life. Joyce was always pleased to see me [this was in India in\n\n1942]…as I was her only friend who had seen him before he set off on that fateful\n\njourney…” (the memoirs of Donald Bruce -Smith supplied by Gerald Bruce –\n\nSmith).

She left SOE in May 1946.\n\nAileen was married to Brigadier Henry Maurice Chambers of 64 Indian Brigade, later Major General Chambers and commander of 26 Indian Infantry Division.

Photo source\n\nFlight Officer Chapman, Faith Mary, nee Townson: born on Christmas Day 1913, in Appleby Magna, Leicestershire. She was educated at Bedford High School 1925-31, and Reading University1931-32.\n\nFaith was a WAAF from 1939 and her commission was for ‘Code & Cipher, Intelligence’. Prior to this she worked as a ‘Cookery Demonstrator for the Esse Cooker Co., 1935-37. She joined SOE as a Section Officer on 7 May 1943 and was in charge of preparing operations to Denmark (it seems, as she put up for a Danish Award) until May 1944 when she went to Massingham (Algiers, North Africa). At Massingham, she was overseeing air ops for the Specal Duties section, helpig to coordinate D-Day.\n\nFaith was posted to India and left on 18 March 1945, arriving Colombo ten days later. She finished with SOE in February 1946.\n\nHer father was Major George Harrison Townson. Family history on this Link. Extract copied and pasted here in case the webite disappears:\n\nGeorge intended to farm on a grander scale than his Westmorland forebears had in the Lyth Valley. By the end of 1904 he had had a good harvest and had 80 beef cattle on the farm, as well as 160 sheep and 10 horses. A new water supply was laid in and other improvements were being made. Sadly all this was to come to nothing as William Townson died on the 2nd January 1906 and George and Violet gave up the farm a short while later. Although George had been left a comfortable inheritance, it perhaps wasn’t enough to finance farming on that sort of scale. William Townson was buried next to his wife Sarah in the Carlton churchyard.\n\nIn 1908, George and Violet were living at Measham House and George had started a garage in Ashby de la Zouch nearby, selling and repairing cars and supplying everything that the pioneer motorist needed. He also had a taxi service and a primitive open topped charabanc which was used for outings. He was obviously a useful man when the First World War broke out and, although nearing forty, he rejoined the army in October 1914 with the rank of Captain. He was in the Army Service Corps and, after a short spell overseas, came back to help run the Mechanical Transport Training Corps at Osterley near London. He was a Major by the time of his demobilisation in 1920. After the war, he continued to work in the London motor trade from time to time, but also had a smallholding at Renhold near Bedford. He seems to have had sufficient income to do as he pleased. George and Violet’s final move was to another smallholding near Romsey in Hampshire where they lived for some years. For some reason, George suddenly decided to go and live in lodgings on the Isle of Wight in 1949 where he died on the 29th November that year. He is buried on the Isle of Wight. Violet went to live with her son and daughter in law at Fareham in Hampshire and died eighteen months later on the 17th June 1951.\n\nGeorge and Violet had two children, Faith Mary Townson born on the 25th December 1913 and John Strover Townson born on the 19th October 1918. They were both educated at Bedford. Faith married Frederick Spencer Chapman (known as Freddy), the explorer, mountaineer and author, just after the Second World War. He had been brought up at Lindale near Cartmel and had a great love of the Lake District, but ironically Faith, who did not realise that her own family originated from that part of the country, did not like ‘the Frozen North’. It was only after Freddy had died in 1971 that she came to know about the Townson family history. Freddy and Faith had three sons, Nicholas, Stephen and Christopher. She died in 2003.\n\nIt appears Faith did a lecture at the Special Forces Club, catalogued here on IWM\n\nFreddy Spencer Chapman is of course the author of The Jungle Is Neutral, an account of his experiences serving behind the lines with SOE in Malaya. Freddy worked at the the University of Reading after the war.\n\nFaith’s brother was Commander ‘Jack’ Townson, OBE, DSC, MiD\n\nHS 9/295/2\n\nEdna Wise, nee Chase.

At just eighteen years old, she was only paid Rs100 p/m at first. By November her wage had doubled.

She had previously worked for Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company Ltd, as secretary to General Sir George Macdonogh.\n\nShe joined SOE on 12 March 1943 and completed spells at STS 54, STS 53A, ISSU 6 and then Force 133 (Sept 1944 – Jan 1945). Returning from North Africa, she worked at STS HQ before leaving for India in March 1945.\n\nShe is recorded as signing her termination forms in Singapore in late November 1945.\n\nHS 9/304/3\n\nChew (Mrs), V.M., B/B377: No file has so far been located\n\nChilley, Cynthia Margaret: born 30 September 1923 in Croyden, Cynthia was vetted for possible SOE employment in May 1944. The next month, she was off to Fawley Court to train at STS 54A as a W/T operator. In January 1945, she left for India, returning in December when she signed off. Her MI5 trace shows that she worked as an accounts clerk for Phoenix Assurance Company Ltd before joining SOE.\n\nHS 9/307/1\n\nCorporal Chisholm, Dorothy May: born 3 May 1923 in Edinburgh, Dorothy was a FANY shorthand typist when SOE checked her background in August 1944.

Her first recorded annual leave was from 17 September 1945. On her MI5 trace her father is listed as Major W.J.P. Martin and her husband was Lawrence George Edward Clarke.\n\nHS 9/321/4\n\nClarke, Eleanor Geraldine, nee de Courcy: born 20 October 1919 in Kashmir, India, Eleanour’s father was Lt.Col. the Lord Kingsale. He served in the Indian Army for 29 years. Eleanor married in 1940 and kept house until she was recruited in a clerical role for SOE in August 1942.\n\nShe was promoted in 1943 to officer status, but there appears to have been a bit of drama as a few pages of the file have been redacted. It seems she was promoted too quickly, and was unable to take charge of the women in her section, so she was demoted and her pay reduced.\n\nEleanor then went out to India in October 1943, expecting to be employed as a cipherette, and serving with the women with whom she travelled east. This did not happen, and she was put in an office where nobody was expecting her and she knew nobody – and not to work as a cipherette. Letters home to her father revealed her displeasure at having been treated so badly – but in any event she stayed in India until September 1945.\n\nOn her return, she wrote to the women’s officer, Miss Furse, to ask for a reference for her time in SOE in Britain, and the correspondence reveals that she did not get the reference she wanted.\n\nHS 9/322/3\n\nClarkson, Kathleen May: born 8 April 1921, in Hackney, East London, Kathleen was employed by SOE on 22 May 1944 as a secretary. She left the UK for India on 22 January 1945, returning to the UK on 10 April 1946. Kathleen was a FANY from 22 December 1944, and after training at STS 46 became a cipher operator which increased her salary from £165.00 to £210.00, presumably per annum.\n\nFrom October 1941 until joining SOE in 1944, she was a shorthand typist with Balfour Beatty & Co.\n\nIn the hobbies section of her documents, she recorded ‘cycling, walking on hostel tours, needlework, canteen, Sunday School, reading and music.’ She is recorded as just 5ft tall and 7 st 6lbs.\n\nHS 9/323/4\n\nFlight Officer Clifford, Margaret Stella Brooke: born 7 September 1912 in Harrogate, Margaret was a beauty specialist in civilian life. She enlisted in the WAAF in November 1940, was commissioned on 2 June 1941, and joined SOE that month. She worked in Signals and Coding until September 1944 when she left the UK for India. Her posting was as G.III Field Ciphers & Cipher Policy Signals, based in Kandy. Margaret’s report for the six months up to 30 June 1945 stated:\n\n‘Fairly good officer – excitable lacking tact through excess zeal.’\n\nShe left SOE to be posted to the RAF from 7 November 1945.\n\nHer father was the famous conductor and composer, Julian Clifford, and her mother a well known soprano. Margaret had studied at The Royal College of Music and was fluent in French. Her uncle on her mother’s side was Lord Henniker.\n\nHS 9/327/5\n\nClinch, Patricia May, nee Raggett: born 23 April 1920 in Ealing, London, Patricia joined SOE in November 1942. A December 1942 reference for SOE places her at No.3 WAAF Depot in Morecambe between December 1941 and November 1942.\n\nHaving joined SOE, she was sent to Calcutta in March 1944 as a FANY where she worked for Siam Country Section as a secretary. She found love in India and married Squadron Leader Denys Clinch in June 1944.\n\n‘Is a very conscientious and capable Secretary.’ (14/10/43 report)\n\nIn August 1945 she left the Far East to come back to the UK and give birth. The Squadron Leader was just about to go to the Cocos Islands but Japan surrendered, so he was rerouted to French Indochina. It was there that he drowned in a sailing accident on 29 October 1945. Patricia was naturally worried about raising a child on her own, and wrote to the women’s officer at SOE HQ in London to make sure she had references to help her gain employment when the child was a year old. The baby was due in February 1946.\n\nHS 9/327/8\n\nSergeant Clinnick, Margaret Ellena: born 20 September 1909 in Truro, Cornwall, Margaret was security checked with a view to becoming a Pay or Registry Clerk. She started as a Pay and Stores Clerk in September 1944, but soon left for India in October. She remained in the Far East until April 1946, signing off in London on 3 May 1946.\n\nPrior to SOE, Margaret worked for Marks & Spencer for seven years as a cashier. After a year as a clerk at the Admiralty in Falmouth, she left on 8 August hoping to join the FANY; this she obviously did, achieving the rank of Sergeant.\n\nSome family tree online, here.\n\nHS 9/328/1\n\nCluff, Nancy Margery: born 22 January 1921 in Hull, East Yorkshire, Nancy was employed as a FANY W/T operator from 15 April 1944.

Before this, Carol had worked at the consulate in Basra from June 1940 to May 1941, and at the Army Intelligence School in Karachi from September 1941. It appears that she had a short stay at GHQ Delhi, as she had ‘been discharged vide New Delhi cable dated 12.5.42. No.385.’ That is all there is in the file…\n\nHS 9/331/2\n\nColdstream, Pamela (nee McGowan), B/B168: born 11 January 1894 in Dehra, India, Pamela joined SOE in December 1942. Previous to SOE, she worked for the officer commanding the Censor Station in Calcutta. For SOE, Pamela worked as a Cipherette in Bombay. She only left SOE on its formal liquidation in May 1946.\n\nHer security check indicates that her husband, Captain William John Anson Coldstream, Indian Medical Service, was deceased. Apparently he was murdered by an Indian woman in July 1932. Bill was in charge of the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar when he was attacked. The family privately published a book about him, called ‘Bill’.\n\nHS 9/333/6\n\nColeridge, Eileen Nora (nee Godber), B/B910: born 13 August 1907 in Rangoon, Eileen was recruited by SOE in London in August 1942. She had experience working in the cipher department of the Royal Indian Navy. Her record indicates that by June 1944, Eileen was workingin Calcutta as operational assistant to the Intelligence Officer in the War Room for Air Operations, A Group.\n\nBy May 1945, she was working in Colombo for Group B air ops, where it was considered important that she wear uniform so she was given an honorary commission as Assistant Section Officer (ASO) in the WAAF. She resigned from Force 136 and her commission on 1 November 1945 in order to stay in the Far East with her husband.\n\nHer husband was Lt/Cmdr Ronald Hamilton Coleridge RINVR, who had been a tea planter before the war.\n\nHS 9/334/5\n\nCollie, Irene, B/B913: born 16 November 1916 in Bandikui, Rajputana, Irene was recruited by SOE in Delhi on 1 April 1944. She was a secretary, and worked in Delhi and Kandy as a ‘Typist (“I”)’. She left SOE on 15 November 1945, just after a month’s annual leave. Her security trace points out that her parents were Anglo-Indian, and that her father was deceased.\n\nHS 9/335/3\n\nColtham, Joyce Maragaret: born 23 November 1922 in Roorkee, India, Joyce was the daughter of Walter Coltham, an Army officer. She lived in India for six years and was schooled in the UK at Stoner House and Simon Langton Girls’, both in Kent.\n\nJoyce took secretarial training at Mrs Hoster’s: ‘A secretarial course at Mrs Hoster’s Secretarial Training College on London’s Cromwell Road, famed for “turning out gels for the establishment”.’ (quote from this LINK).\n\nFrom 1941, Joyce worked in Pembury County Hospital in the Medical Superintendent’s office and then as secretary to the Matron. She wrote to Baker Street asking after any vacancies in May 1944. She secured gleaming references and joined SOE, embarking for India in July 1944.

She must have stayed, however, finally going in April 1944 because:\n\n‘A situation has arisen in this section wherein I find my position absolutely untenable’.\n\nFrom 1925-1930 she worked with an educational publisher, Evan Bros.

She is recorded as leaving for India on 26 September 1944.\n\nShe signed off from SOE in India on 1 January 1946, but a new surname on the form indicates she had found love and got married – but the married name is unclear. It also indicates that she went by the name of Ita, rather then Teresa.\n\nTeresa Mary Ita Gardner\n\nSeptember 2, 2002\n\nOn September 2, 2002 Teresa Mary Ita Gardner (nee Corr) passed away at Royal Inland Hospital, Kamloops at the age of 80.

She will be fondly remembered by her sister Sister Marie Immaculata in Cork, Ireland; her children Malcolm (Cheryl Brackett), Michael (Sylvia Lakes), Judy (Doug May), Wendy (Ian Pirie), Peter (Marilyn); her grandchildren Mandy (Todd), Callum, Cameron, Stephan, Scott, Kyle, Duncan, Robyn, Katrine, Fiona, and Jeremy; and her great grandchildren Sadie, Colby, Jaimi and Connor Hall.\n\nBorn April 4, 1922 in Knock, County Mayo, Ireland she was a woman of great intelligence, courage and fortitude. A top honours student who received national recognition in her day, Ita left Ireland to seek adventure and fortune in London. With the advent of World War II, she found herself in India serving in the Special Operations Executive Commission of the FANY’s (First Aid Nursing Yeomanry). The work was top secret and highly skilled. The women worked coding signals, acted as conductors for agents and provided technical support for the Special Training Schools.\n\nOn March 3, 1945 she married a young Commanding Officer, Hugh MacCallum Gardner, of the Seaforth Highlanders. Once decommissioned after the war they settled in Inverness, Scotland and in the ensuing years raised 5 children, established teaching careers and in 1968 emigrated to Agassiz, BC. In 1970 the family moved to Barriere where Ita taught at the Barriere Elementary School until 1983. She will be fondly remembered by her many students as a demanding but fair minded task mistress.\n\nA service was held on September 10 at St. George’s Catholic Church attended by her family and many friends in the community.\n\nHS 9/357/5\n\nCottrell, Marion Wallace (nee Brown, ‘lately Moyes’): born 22 May 1914 in Edinburgh, Marion was employed by the Air Ministry in the Aeronautical Inspection Department (AID). She was an engineer and was responsible for precision examination as well as ‘lecturing on general engineering subjects’.\n\nMarion lived in New Zealand for 3.5 years where she was educated at Wellington Girl’s College, 1929-1932, and Victoria University College in 1932. Before going to New Zealand, she attended the James Gillespie High School for Girls in Edinburgh, 1919-1928.\n\nThe ‘lately Moyes’ in her name on her file relates to Albert Ernest Moyes, a New Zealander who was serving in the RNVR, whom she divorced during the war years. She joined SOE as Marion Moyes in May 1945, but left the organisation as Marion Cottrell, resigning in India on 31 October 1945.\n\nEager to make use of her technical qualifications, SOE did not want to take her on as a secretary, but she said that if that was the only way she could get in then she would take a lesser position, confident that she would be elevated in due course. By August 1945, therefore, she was employed as a secretary in Colombo, ad then during September in Delhi.\n\nHS 9/361/5\n\nCowan (Mrs), J.I., B/B765: No file has so far been located\n\nCrawford (Mrs), I.A., B/B765: No file has so far been located\n\nCrosbie-Hill, Joan Marjorie (nee Meggy), B/B761: born 1 January 1911 in New Barnet, Joan was employed by SOE from November 1943 as a secretary. Her husband is recorded as being captured and interned at Singapore.\n\nAnthony Crosbie-Hill had been a rubber planter and they had lived on the Hibernia Rubber Estate in Malaya. Joan escaped to Bombay with their daughter, Ann, but Anthony is recorded as having been KIA on the Malay Volunteers website. He was serving with 1 Battalion Malay Volunteers.\n\nJoan seems to have terminated her employment with SOE after just four months on 31 March 1944.\n\nFurther informarion supplied by Jonathan at the Malay Volunteers website: Joan remarried in 1946. Her new husband was Eric Brratt Holte. Eric was born in Manchester but emigrated to Australia. He served with the AIF at Gallipoli and ended up in Malaya after the Great War. He was imprisoned in Changi after the fall of Singapore. Joan and Eric returned to Malaya in December 1946. Eric died in 1957 aged 61; Joan died in Somerset in 1989.\n\nHS 9/709/8\n\nCroucher, Sonia Miriam (formerly Houlston, Nee Rubenstein): born 23 September 1921 in Pontypridd Wales. She was a WAAF from March 1939 until November 1943 when she left ‘as she was below the medical standard required for further service’.\n\nShe joined SOE in April 1945, left for India on 19 May, and was a secretary for Siam Country Section from 19 June. By August, she was working on cyphers, but her record shows a lot of illness between June and November 1945. Letters arranging for her to leave to India also indicate she was ill before she left the UK.\n\nHer husband was Lt. S.C. Croucher, RINVR who was on HMIS ‘Feroze’, the officer training ship based in Bombay. She appears to have got married in India, having travelled as Mrs Houlston. Her first husband, Jack Edward Houlston was in the RAF with the rank of Squadron Leader. He is recorded as deceased 20 December 1942.\n\nHS 9/377/4\n\nCumming, Elsie Ellis (previously Hume, nee Anderson) B/B769: born 24 February 1915 in London, Elsie was recruited in Calcutta in December 1943 with a view to becoming a Cipherette. She ended up being a secretary for the Indian Field Broadcasting Units (IFBUs), which were part of SOE’s Political Warfare Division. By 6 July 1945 she was secretary to Lt.Col. Grieve, who was in charge of PW Division.\n\nElsie married Lieutenant Angus MacDonald Cumming, RNVR, in Calcutta on 28 December 1945. She had been married to Flight Lieutenant Hume. Lt. Cumming died in 1982, and Elsie out-lived him until August 2000. Cumming apparently did some work with Force 136 and the Burmese Navy, but prior to joining India Mission he worked for SOE in Madagascar and South Africa. He therefore has a file.\n\nHS 9/380/7\n\nDargie, Annabella Evelyn: born 20 October 1915 in Edinburgh, Annabella was ‘put through the cards’ in March 1945. She left work at SOE HQ in London for India on 8 June 1945. She was employed as a FANY shorthand typist. Prior to SOE, she had worked for a decade as a secretary in a ‘Mining Engineers Office’ and nine months in an ‘Aircraft Factory.’\n\nShe signed off from SOE on 22 November 1945, in India; her forwarding address was HQ SACSEA in Singapore.\n\nIn February 1947, Annabella married George Russell Lee. George Russell Lee is recorded as being employed as an ‘Agent of Her Majesty’ here.\n\nHS 9/394/8\n\nDark, Hilda Joan: born 11 June 1927 in Rangoon, Hilda was Canadian, and possibly the youngest (caucasian) person to serve with Force 136. She was recruited in Poona, Inndia, in August 1944, just after her 17th birthday. She left Force 136 on 31 May 1945 to go to Canada with her parents.\n\nShe worked at the Eastern Warfare School (India), abbreviated to EWS(I), with a startingn wage of Rs275, as a telephone operator?\n\nHS 9/395/2 the description says she died in 1943, which is a curious archival error.\n\nDavey, B/B845 No file has so far been located\n\nDavidson, Bessie (nee Begg), B/B359: born 24 September 1908 in Aberdeen, Bessie was checked for possible employment by SOE in February 1943. The same month, she began work as a secretary in Madras.\n\nBy October 1944, Bessie had left SOE because of ill health.\n\nShe was married to Lt.Col. John Arthur Davidson.\n\nHS 9/397/4\n\nDavies, (Mrs) G.D., B/B912 No file has so far been located\n\nDavidge, Monica Pearl, nee Christie: born 29 August 1910 in Torquay, Devon, Monica was vetted in May 1944. She was enlisted as a FANY and employed as a coder. She left for India in September 1944, returning to the UK and signing off on 5 June 1945.\n\nLike Marion Cottrell (above), before SOE Monica was employed by the Air Ministry in the Aeronautical Inspection Department (AID) in Bristol. Her MI5 trace has her down as ‘Examiner A.I.D. at M.A.P. (Engines) Bristol’.\n\nHer husband was Robert George Davidge, who is remembered on the IWM ‘Lives of the First World War‘.\n\nHS 9/397/3\n\nDavis, (Mrs) L.O., B/B155 No file has so far been located\n\nDawson, Anne Marie Gonville (nee Bromhead), B/B915: born 13 October 1905 in Aijal, Assam, Anne was approached by SOE inn April 1944 ‘with a view to being employed as an Intelligence Officer – Delhi’. She was taken on and paid Rs.500 p/m, which seems to be a better wage than most of the other women listed here started on.\n\nUnusually, there is a report on Anne. It discloses that she was an Intelligence Officer for China Country Section’s Rear HQ. She was described thus:\n\n‘A most efficient and conscientious officer, easy to work with and of great assistance in maintaining a good espirit de corps.’\n\n‘A thoroughly able and painstaking officer’.\n\nAnne was married to then Colonel Keith Cyril Darlington Dawson.\n\nAnne died on 15 August 1992, 15yrs after her husband, in Victoria, Australia.\n\nFrom The Peerage:\n\nBrigadier Keith Cyril Darlington Dawson is the son of Peter Dawson.1 He married Annie Marie Gonville Bromhead, daughter of Major Edward Gonville Bromhead and Emily May Hosking, on 20 February 1928.1 He was appointed Officer, Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.)1 He gained the rank of Brigadier in the Indian Army.1\n\nHS 9/406/1\n\nDawson, Bridget Elizabeth: born 22 March 1921 in London, Bridget was vetted in December 1943, but only employed by SOE from May 1944 as a FANY. She left the UK for India in July 1944, and signed her termination form in the Far East in November 1945.\n\nHS 9/406/2\n\nDay, Jean Marion, B/B844: born 26 October 1918in Bromley, Kent, Jean was ‘put through the cards’ in February 1944 with a view to employment as a secretary overseas. She commenced employment with SOE in March and left for India in May, only getting signed off after her return to the UK in February 1946.\n\nJean was educated at a small private school for girls, the Girdler’s Collegiate School in Herne Bay, Kent, from 1932-35. She then attended secretarial college in London. Her employment card reveals she wored for Walsall Conduits Ltd in West Kensington immediately before joining SOE. Once she arrived in the East, she worked in Kanday and then in Calcutta for Burma Country Section. While in service, she suffered from both tonsillitis and malaria.\n\nIn a letter to the ‘Women’s Establishment Officer’, Jean’s mother wrote that Jean ‘seems in fine spirits and delighted with her new experiences’.\n\nHS 9/407/7\n\nDe Boarde, Joan Mary: born 11 February 1917 in Peterborough, Joan joined SOE in April 1945. By July, after a few months working as a secretary in the UK, she was off to India after a delay in securing passage.\n\nBefore joining SOE, Joan had worked as a secretary at HQ North East Command Air Training Corps. Apart from schools in the UK, her record indicates that she attended Lorreto Convent School in Darjeeling. On this trip to India for SOE, she ended up working in Colombo, Ceylon, until returning to the UK in November 1945.\n\nA reference for a job with the Control Commission for Germany dated January 1946 is complimentary, describing Joan as ‘trustworthy and reliable.’ There is no confirmation that she took this job.\n\nHS 9/170/1\n\nDe Grey, Lavender Hyacinth: born 14 October 1923 in Putney Heath, Lavender was the daughter of Lord and Lady Walsingham. Her MI5 trace was run in April 1942, and she joined SOE as a FANY from May. On 5 May 1944, she left the UK for Algiers. Her return date is ‘undated’, but she left the UK for India on Valentine’s Day 1945, not returning until early 1946.\n\nThe Walsingham estate, shown in 1942 as Lavender’s home address, was requisitioned by the government during the war for troops to train for DDay. The government never allowed the villagers to return, and the lands remain part of the MOD’s training areas.\n\nThe Peerage\n\nHS 9/621/2\n\nDe Vries, Adeline May (was Davies, nee Patterson) B/B360: born in Northumberland on 12 December 1912, Adeline was employed by SOE from February 1943 as a secretary. Unusually quick, she was vetted on 17 February and employed within the week in Colombo.\n\nHS 9/1540/3\n\nDean, Margaret: born 2 February 1909 in Gloucester, Margaret was recruited in Delhi during July 1944. Initially in Meerut as a ‘Cypherene’, she was soon moved to Calcutta. She resigned from SOE on 26 February 1945. The letter below shows she left under a bit of a cloud, but the reasons for why are not to be found in her three page file:\n\nHS 9/408/6\n\nDenton, (Mrs) Dorothy Alice, B/B755: born 3 August 1920 in Simla, India, Dorothy was employed as a secretary from 19 November 1943. Her husband, identified on the MI5 trace, was ‘S/Conductor Frank Denton’ at GHQ (1).\n\nHS 9/419/5\n\nCaptain Dignam, Mary Esther: the first page of the file states no DOB available, and where other files that have the same do, in actual fact, have a DOB somewhere in the documents, this file doesn’t. Her mother’s address is given as Toronto.\n\nCaptain Dignam belonged to the Canadian Women’s Army Corops (CWAC). Most of her file is taken up with trying to reslve who was responsible for her salary, which is one of the higher ones at RS850 p/m.\n\nCaptain Dignam served in Meerut, Poona, Kandy, and, from 27 March 1945, Kunming. Her job is described as ‘secretary’ beside the entry for Poona, and ‘P.W.’ beside Kandy, perhaps indicatng Political Warfare. She appears to have been working for SOE in India from November 1943.\n\nMay have been related to the renowned Canadian artist Mary Ella Dignam; named after her grandmother?\n\nPainting Credit: Artnet\n\nHS 9/433/1\n\nDillon, Doris Winifred, nee Edwards: born 14 October 1915 in Upton Manor, London, Doris has ‘Nursing’ as her occupation. She was picked up by SOE in July 1944 with a view to being sent to India as a Cipher Clerk. Employed from 8 August as a secretary, she left the UK on 3 November.\n\nNursing appears to be incorrect, however, as on her employment card it records that she had been employed at North Middlesex Hospital on clerical duties, and in India, she went on to be a clerk in Q Section (stores). Remaining in Delhi, Doris resigned her position in SOE in January 1946, renouncing repatriation.\n\nHer husband, James Martin Dillon was a licensed victualler and his address is given as the The Duke of Wellington Pub, 119 Balls Pond Road, N1. Doris resigned from the hospital to look after him from January to June 1944.\n\nHS 9/433/5\n\nDixon, Gladys Lillian, nee Edwards: born 24 May 1914 in South Shields, Gladys signs her documents off as ‘G. Lillian’ so probably went by the the name Lillian. She was a Sergeant in the ATS from 1939 – 1941, leaving because she was pregnant. In the rest of the paperwork, no child’s details are entered, and she was divorced in 1942.\n\nShe sailed for India on 9 July 1945, and returned to the UK after working as a secretary in Colombo in November 1945. Her record shows that she arrived in Ceylon ill, and went to hospital for five days, and had two more spells of illness in August and October, each time requiring hospital.\n\nHS 9/435/5\n\nDivers, E.H.C., B/B914 No file has so far been located\n\nDodds, Hilary Beaufoy: born 28 August 1926 in Edinburgh, Hilary was a student when SOE looked to employ her just after her 18th birthday. She left for India on 23 October 1944 and was signed off on 20 November 1945 after her return to the UK.\n\nHS 9/438/6\n\nDoig, Estelle Mary, nee Wampach B/B684: born 23 May 1906, Estelle joined SOE in 1941 as Miss Wampach, and worked at Station XII from September. She was personal secretary to ‘E.D.’ and he wanted to take his secretary with him when he went ‘into the field’.\n\n‘ED’ appears to be the codename for the officer in charge of Station XII, who at this time was Lt.Col. Leslie John Wood. Wood’s file shows that he left Station XII for India at the same time as Estelle. At Station XII, she had been one of 31 secretaries.\n\nEstelle returned in May 1946, having been taken on the strength of the FANY. Lt.Col. Wood had long since (Dec 1944) been repatriated to the UK on health grounds, suffering from Amoebiasis. He had an ‘absolute bar’ on ever returning to India, ‘even for shortest visit.’\n\nEstelle married David Cuff Doig while in India. She died in 1975. David was born in Pinnar, London, and was four years her senior. He was commissioned in the Royal Engineers, but also in SOE, where he was a construction expert.\n\nHS 9/439/9\n\nDoran, Diana Alison: born 1 July 1923 in Putney, London, Diana’s MI5 trace shows she had been a student at the Royal Academy of Music, and had worked as a clerk in Gas, Light & Coke Co. She was vetted for work with SOE in August 1944 and employed from September as a W/T operator. From September to December she was at STS 54A (Fawley Court, Henley on Thames) until leaving for India in December. She signed her termination of contract in the Far East on or around 20 December 1945 (which could imply she stayed out east as most women seem to have come home and signed off unless staying for further work or with a man).\n\nHS 9/443/4\n\nDouglass, Phoebe Mary, (nee Douglas) B/B375: born 28 March 1917 in Brighton, Phoebe was put throughthe cards and recruited for overseas service in May 1943 as a secretary. Her file consists of just two papers, which includes an unusually sparse background trace.\n\nHS9/445/5\n\nDowson, Dorothy Ann: born 19 October 1925 in Pyrford, Surrey, Dorothy was a FANY. Six days after her 18th birthday she was employed as a W/T operator with SOE at STS 54A (Fawley Court, Henley on Thames). Just over a year later, in December 1944 she left for India, returning in December 1945.\n\nHS 9/447/7\n\nDrew, (Mrs) A.M., B/B363 No file has so far been located\n\nDrury, Dora, nee Ellams-Hope: went to Bari, but nothing in her file indicates India.\n\ndu Vivier, Jean Alexa, nee Macpherson, B/B 743: born 19 August 1919 in Srinagar, India, Jean was recruited in India in September 1943 for employment as a secretary. It seems that in 1945, she went to the UK and was possibly ging to be employed at London HQ, but by April 1945 she was ‘not employed to date.’\n\nHS 9/1538/5\n\nDumper, Hilda May: born 1 May 1907 in Eltham, London, Hilda joined SOE in October 1944 and left for India in December. She remained with SOE until January 1946. She was employed as a shorthand typist.\n\nHer father was Charles Dumper, who died in 1940. Hilda lived until 1988.\n\nHS 9/457/8\n\nDunne, Marie, B/B164: born 10 June 1909 in Belfast, Marie was checked and employed by SOE in October/November 1942 in India. Interestingly, her trace has been redacted.\n\nIt appears that Marie had been working in Hong Kong for the Colonial Secretariat in 1941, but made it out to India where the Colonial Office relinquished her services to SOE. In January 1944, SOE terminated employment on doctor’s orders. She needed ‘rest for at least three months’. SOE fronted her salary for those months in case the Colonial Office didn’t assist, and thanked her for loyal service.\n\nHS 9/459/6\n\nDurlacher, M.I., B/B321 No file has so far been located\n\nEagles, N.A.M., B/B356: No file has so far been located\n\nEardley, Margaret, Mary, B/B305: born 11 April 1913 in Queensland Australia, Margaret was employed by SOE’s Oriental Mission in Singapore from early December 1941. She had been working as a secretary for the firm Jardines from 1935. Her original codename was 0.179, becoming B/B305 when she joined the India Mission in February 1943. It seems she left SOE for a spell from 11 March 1942 until re-employment in China. She worked as a secretary and Cipherette in Kunming, and is recorded as being in Chungking from July 1945.\n\nAfter a spell of sick leave in September 1945, she was sent to Bombay where she resigned from SOE in November.\n\nHS 9/465/6\n\nEast, Joan Elizabeth: born 25 January 1915 in London, Joan was approached by SOE in September 1944 with a view to employment as a senior secretary. She left the UK for India on 10 December 1944.\n\nPrior to SOE, Joan had worked for the firm Jardine Matheson Ltd in Nairobi, from April 1940. While with SOE, she worked in Calcutta, Kandy and Colombo, mostly as a secretary in AG Branch, but latterly as ‘O.C. civ. women.’\n\nShe signed off from SOE in Nairobi on 7 January 1946.\n\nHS 9/465/8\n\nEddy No file has so far been located for Eddy.\n\nElliott, Ursula Mary Hamilton: born 16 August 1917 in Maidstone, Kent, Ursula joined SOE in November 1944. She worked at London HQ before leaving for India on Valentine’s Day 1945. She was signed off on her return to the UK on 20 May 1946.\n\nUrsula was employed as a confidential secretary and as a FANY ‘has been promoted to the highest rank possible whilst so employed’ (Cadet Ensign):\n\nHS 9/477/3\n\nEvans, Doris Joan, nee Vare: born 14 October 1912 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, Doris has the unusual ‘Masseuse’ recorded as her occupation before SOE.\n\nFrom May 1942, Doris was employed as a W/T student FANY at STS 46. Training complete, she was posted to Massingham in North Africa, where she was MiD for her work, gazetted 11 January 1945. After Massingham, she was sent to Australia in May 1945 – it is unclear whether she ended up in India.\n\nHer husband was Lt.

She had been working for the Ludlow Jute Company Ltd as a secretary.\n\nHer employment card reveals that she was a supervisor, and that she left SOE in March 1946. She was married to Captain Leonard Denzil Evison who was part of Military Intelligence.\n\nThe surprise was finding this in her file:\n\nHS 9/491/4\n\nEyre-Higgins, Dorothy: born 19 October 1904 in Worcestershire, Dorothy was recruited in Bombay and worked there as a junior clerk from 7 May 1945.

She worked for Barking Borough Council when SOE found her, earning £184 p/a as a senior typist.\n\nHS 9/519/2\n\nFleury, Patricia, Jean Madeleine (nee Little), B/B796: born 1 January 1919 in St. Leonards On Sea, Patricia was employed by SOE from December 1943. Patricia was educated at convent schools in Britain, Belgium and Spain up to 1936. From 1937-1940 she worked with Cattermoul Film Service, and then she worked in Room 055 of the War Office (MI5).\n\nShe was employed as a Secretary for French Section from December 1943 until she left for India at the end of January 1944, where she continued to work with the French as secretary to the Head of French Mission.\n\nHer husband was Amoret Clear Fleury, born Dublin, but who had British nationality. He was a Captain in the Royal Artillery at HQ 33 Indian Corps. Patricia had not seen her husband for three years due to the war, so she applied for SOE service in India. She appreciated that she would only be able to see him on leave, as he was based in Bombay and she in Meerut, but they evidently met because in November 1944 she wrote asking if she could resign due to ill health and expecting her first child. She therefore signed off from SOE on 8 December 1944:\n\nHS 9/520/3\n\nForest, Marjorie Dorothea (nee Hammond), B/B396: born in London on 3 May 1901, Marjorie worked in the Naval Cipher Office in Rangoon. She was recruited in Delhi in September 1943 for work as an Intelligence Officer. She was employed in Delhi on Rs500 p/m until she left SOE on 18 December 1944. There is no reason given for her early retirement from SOE.\n\nHS 9/523/4\n\nForsyth, Nora: born 30 December 1914 inn Northumberland, Nora was recruite locally, ie in India. She was a secretary at the School of Eastern Interpreters, one of the main training school for the India Mission, from June 1945. She finished with SOE on 31 December 1945.\n\nNora was married to Major J.G. Forsyth, who was also with SOE.\n\nHS 9/529/4\n\nFrancis: no file has been located thus far for Francis.\n\nFraser-Campbell, Hope Baillie, B/B924: born 24 August 1920 in Edinburgh, Hope was a VAD for three years in a military hospital before joining SOE in October 1942 as an SOE W/T FANY. She left for India in March 1944, returning two years later in March 1946. Her parents were American.\n\nHS 9/260/8\n\nSenior Commander Fry, Mary Margaret Elizabeth, nee Cuerden, B/B163: born 25 October 1911 in Calcutta, Mary was on SOE’s books from October 1942. Prior to this, she was employed as PA to the Director of Military Intelligence at GHQ India from July 1941.\n\nFrom April to October 1942, Mary was in command of POW and Internee censorship in India. After her appointment to SOE she became GSOIII Liaison, but just two months later in December she was officer commanding the Liaison Office which led to her being commissioned in the Women’s Auxilliary Corps, and ultimately being awarded an MBE:\n\nIt is rare to find that someone is irreplaceable in their job:\n\nBefore the war, Mary went to Ashford School in Kent, followed by secretarial college in London. Mary was married to Captain Leslie Alfred Charles Fry MBE, Under Secretary External Affairs for the Government of India, with whom she had two children. Their daughter was born in 1937, and a son was born in 1940.\n\nHS 9/547/5\n\nGarland, Elspeth Rae Anderson: born 10 March 1914 in Dundee, Scotland, Elspeth was working as a Telegraphist and Cashier Clerk at the Post Office when SOE vetted her in October 1944.

She left the UK on Valentine’s Day 1945 and signed off after her return, on 9 April 1946.\n\nHS 9/565/1\n\nCaptain Gay, Dorothy Margaret, nee McMath: born 20 September 1916 in Corsorphine, Edinburgh, Dorothy was vetted in January 1943 with a view to becoming a W/T operator. Once taken on as a FANY, in March she was posted to HQ Signals working on teleprinters. It looks like she remained there for 19 months until she was sent out to India in October 1944. She signed off from SOE in the Far East on 20 December 1945.\n\nThe documents in her file indicate that she found her husband while serving in the Far East, which fits the emerging pattern that most women who signed off from SOE in theatre did so because they had got married.\n\nHer file also shows that she was a volunteer on joining (undated), a Corporal by the time she filled in her SOE Personnel History forms, and a Captain by the time she signed off.\n\nBefore joining SOE, Dortothy had worked as a shorthand typist for LNER for seven years, and was with the Ministry of labour as a typist when SOE recruited her.\n\nHS 9/569/1\n\nGeorge, Jean Hilda: born 20 March 1921 in London, Jean was working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production before joining SOE on 3 April 1945.

Prior to this she had been at Oxford University 1940-41, and working in Room 055 of the War Office 1941-1943. In the Far East, she was a secretary for the French Indochina Section, and proved able to help out with her French language skills when there was a bit of a crisis.\n\nHS 9/582/8\n\nGlover, Joan Violet, nee Fitze, B/B398: born 12 April 1922 in Indore, India, Joan was vetted in September 1943 and employed six days later as a secretary. She signed off from SOE on 19 October 1944.\n\nHer father was Sir Kenneth Samuel Fitze, the British Resident for Central India, and author of The Twilight of the Maharajas.\n\nHS 9/591/1\n\nCadet Ensign Goddard, Joan Christine: born 1 July 1922 in Beckenham, Kent, Joan was employed by SOE from May 1944. She is quite unusual in that on her form where it asks ‘political views’, she wrote ‘Not definite, but tendancy towards communism’.\n\nFrom 1936-39, Joan attended the Bromley High School for Girls. She then went to secretarial college and was employed, from May 1941, by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company as a shorthand typist. This job was a reserved occupation so SOE had to push to get her released, eventually joining in May 1944.\n\nIn July 1944, Joan left the UK for Italy and ME38, where she worked until June 1945. She then went out to India in July 1945, returning home in December 1945, and signing off from SOE. She chose to join the FANY, and was promoted to sergeant in June 1944 and Cadet Ensign the following month.\n\nHS 9/592/5\n\nGoldman, Marjorie Marie, B/B124: born 9 October 1911 in Canterbury, Marjorie was vetted in June 1942 and employed by July. She was recruited in Ceylon and became PA to the Commander in Colombo on a more generous salary of Rs600 p/m. In the file for Dorothy Goodwin (below), there is a letter of recommendation for Dorothy signed by Marjorie, which specifies that she was P/A to Commander of B Group, Force 136, Colonel Hudson:\n\nTwo things indicate that Marjorie had managed to escape from Singapore/Malaya. She spoke Malay, and her husband, Major A.F. Goldman is on her MI5 trace as a prisoner in Singapore. A quick search shows Major Alexander Percival Goldman is listed on the FEPOW website. A search of the CWGC website suggests he survived internment. The only other trace immediately findable is her notice of engagement:\n\nFrom the Straits Budget, 29 December 1938\n\nUnusually, Marjorie was flown back to the UK on 29 September 1945. Possibly to be reunited with her husband?\n\nHS 9/596/8\n\nGoodwin, Dorothy Bartrum: born 12 February 1915 in Kidderminster, Dorothy is a late recruit to SOE, joining in June 1945 and going to India that month. On her joining A.4 Form, Dorothy indicated that she was familiar with Ceylon and ‘parts’ of India. She was employed in Ceylon and India from January 1934 to November 1935 as a Nursery Governess.\n\nDorothy attended Oakfield School, an independent school which shut in 2012, and then St. James’s Secretarial College, which was established by one of Churchill’s private secretaries in 1912:\n\nPicture Credit\n\nBefore SOE, Dorothy was working for the Canadian Government Department of Munitions & Supply as a Head of Section covering mail, files and signals. She started work in Colombo as a stenographer on 5 August 1945 on Rs400 p/m and was repatriated to the UK on 17 November 1945.\n\nSignificant family details on Ancestry.\n\nHS 9/600/6\n\nGordon Clark, Alice Jocelyn: born 16 May 1925, Jocelyn was enroled in the FANY on 21 October 1943. She was earmarked for W/T training, so Jocelyn was posted to STS54A on 23 October for wireless training. Prior to overseas posting, Jocelyn worked at STS HQ in London, leaving for India on 17 July 1944. Her destination was Meerut, home of SOE Signals in India.\n\nFrom Meerut, Jocelyn’s next posting was to Colombo from September 1944, where she stayed until March 1945. It was in Colombo at a dance that she met Major John Cox, her future husband (see Men of SOE Burma page).\n\nAfter a spell in 50 Indian General Hospital and some sick leave, Jocelyn was posted to 805 WSS (SP), the ‘SP’ meaning ‘Special Projects’. This was where the signals for the final offensives against the Japanese were handled. After the Japanese surrender, it was transit camp and embarkation for the UK on 24 October 1945.\n\nJocelyn died on 6 March 1980, just short of her 55th birthday:\n\nHS 9/319/1\n\nGosnell, Doreen Alma B/B848: born 21 May 1915 in London, Doreen was vetted in March 1944 and off to India by May. She had been working in a secretarial role for the General Steam Navigation Co. Ltd since June 1931.

She then worked in Q Ops, and from 30 January 1945 it just indicates Burma Country Section on her employment card. She left SOE in June 1945.\n\nHS 9/607/2\n\nGreenham, Mary Viola, nee Sharpe, B/B774: born 18 June 1909 in London, Maary was vetted in December 1943 and employed as a secretary in the New Year of 1944.

She then attended secretarial training and worked in Bartholomew’s Hospital from May 1938 until August 1943, latterly as clerk to the governors.

She returned t the UK two years later after a spell in hospital having contracted Typhus and jaundice.\n\nOperation Remorse was run by Walter Fletcher, an overweight businessman who had been a rubber trader in the Far East before the war.
