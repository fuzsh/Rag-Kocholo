This site contains historical data and images from the squadron’s inception in April, 1941 to the end of the Argus era in 1980.

King George VI, at a victory parade in Wick, Scotland on 5 May, 1943 from Air Vice Marshall A. B. Ellwod, A.O.C. No. 18 Group, Coastal Command.\n\nThe squadron badge is argent a buffalo’s head couped proper. It is after this that the Squadron is known as the “Buffalo Squadron”, the buffalo being known as a “fierce and powerful fighter”. The squadron’s motto is “Ready to Fight”.\n\nSquadron 404 Colors\n\nCoastal Fighter Squadron was formed on 15 April, 1941 at RAF Thorney Island in South-East England, flying Bristol Blenheims, Beaufighters and DeHavilland Mosquitoes until it was disbanded on 25 May, 1945.\n\nReformed at RCAF Station Greenwood on April 30, 1950, the ‘Herd’ has seen a number of different titles, designations and aircraft over the years, most recently being designated a Long-Range Patrol and Training Squadron in 2007 flying the CP140/A Aurora and Arcturus aircraft.\n\n404 Squadron’s Battle Honors

Beginning…\n\nWith Britain at war in the fall of 1939, it was understood that Canada would follow. From all over the country, Canadians from all walks of life flocked to join the rapidly expanding Air force, Navy and Army. Thousands felt the need to hasten directly to the assistance of Britain and enlisted in the British service directly. However, starting from humble beginnings, most people realized that it would take years before Canada could hope to make a sizeable contribution to the war effort on land or sea.in the air it was a different story.\n\nAs early as November 1939, Air Vice Marshal (A/V/M) GM Croil, Chief of the Air Staff, had argued in a memo to the Minister of National Defence that it was not only desirous, but also essential, that the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) play a role in the overseas war.\n\nA subsequent agreement between Canada and Great Britain in January 1941 called for 25 RCAF squadrons to be formed in the United Kingdom over an 18-month period. The second of the RCAF’s so-called Article-15 squadrons to form overseas was 404 Squadron.\n\n404 served its entire wartime life within Coastal Command, taking on the title of Coastal Fighter (CF) Squadron. Tasks included the protection of friendly convoys and conducting reconnaissance missions and attacking of enemy shipping. At all times squadron aircrew were subject to attacks from vastly superior Luftwaffe fighters such as the Me.109 and FW.190 while flying the Bristol Blenheim, an aircraft that was actually designed to be a light bomber. Even after being re-equipped with the able Beaufighter, the crews flew incredibly dangerous missions such as anti-flak escort where the crews purposely drew anti-aircraft fire from dangerous escort vessels to allow torpedo planes to drop their weapons, and shipping strikes where the crews had to fly straight at well defended vessels, often within 300 yards, allowing enemy gunners shots that required no deflection. While flying escort, the crews had the duty of tangling with enemy fighters of all sorts. On top of this, due to lack of fighter cover, most missions required cloud cover to allow escape after attacks.\n\nAs a quick example, a typical mission would be flown in poor weather, with a low cloud deck. The crews would form up, and proceed at 50 feet to the patrol area in order to avoid enemy radar. At the patrol area, they would quickly climb to 1500 feet, and hopefully sight the target convoy. Since convoys sailed so close to shore, coastal flak batteries would immediately open fire, as would the escort vessels with their 20mm and 37mm AA guns. 404 would attack these formidable flak-ships, weaving around the convoy, strafing with machine-gun and cannon. If all went to plan, the torpedo or strike rocket projectile (RP) aircraft would quickly make their attacks, aiming at the valuable merchant vessels. Properly conducted, the attack would be finished in ten minutes, that is unless the enemy fighters showed up…\n\nLife in Coastal Command was not glamorous. In fact, only 20 percent of all Coastal Command patrols through the war led to attacks on shipping. Fighter Command and Bomber Command received regular press coverage, and the aircrew at times felt forgotten for their efforts. To top this off, being subjected to the indignity of having to fly dangerous missions in obsolete aircraft, and being moved 18 times in their four year existence, often to locations that were not suitable to fly operations from, often lowered morale. Still, these gentlemen got the job done, and have left a legacy of pride and accomplishment.\n\nThe Squadron’s service to Canada is approaching its sixth decade. With only six short years of hiatus, 404’s legacy is pride of service, dedication and heroism. From the dark wartime years when many saw their comrades fall or ‘fail to return’ to the years of the new millennium when we see comrades persevere, succeed and return to their units as qualified aircrew; ours is a history that must be preserved.\n\nThe ‘Herd’ is Born…\n\nAt the beginning of the war, 404 Squadron’s future command, Coastal Command, had the principal duty of trade protection, reconnaissance and co-operation with the Royal Navy. At that time, the importance of the German Navy or “Kriegsmarine” and the attacking of enemy shipping were considered but no specific plans were actually put in place. Maritime interdiction was thought to be the duty of the Navy.\n\nFor the first years of the war, the Command flew obsolete aircraft such as Vickers Vildebeest torpedo bombers and Handley-Page Hampdens, a twin-engined bomber. Early missions could only attack vessels that were identified as warships, and were not allowed to attack enemy merchant vessels, even when they fired on the Coastal Command aircraft. As German advances in Holland and Norway continued, this policy was to loosen and enemy mercantile shipping became a fair target. Still, the Command was to be saddled with having to fly obsolete aircraft on dangerous missions, usually in marginal weather conditions.\n\nAs a direct result of employing inappropriate aircraft and poor tactical training was the fact that between April and September of 1940 the Command was directly responsible for the sinking of only two small vessels. Still, mines dropped by Coastal Command dealt a much harsher blow, accounting for 56 enemy vessels.\n\nEven though the response to enemy shipping opportunities seemed weak, military leadership fully understood the need to interdict the shipping into Germany. The highest-grade iron ore available to German foundries was mined in neutral Sweden, and was shipped from the ports on the country’s east coast. German and German-controlled ships carried the ore south, through the Baltic to northern German ports. This, however, was not possible in winter when the Baltic froze over. The ore was then transported by rail to the Norwegian port of Narvick, which, being on the Atlantic coast, remained ice-free all winter. This source of ore, and the importance placed on it, was evidenced throughout the war by the efforts to protect convoys with valuable Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe assets sorely needed to assist the war effort elsewhere.\n\nLooking at a European map, it is readily apparent how difficult it was to interdict convoys amongst the leads, islands and fjords. Once the rail and canal systems of Germany had sustained considerable damage as the war progressed, more raw materials had to be shipped. Narvik, in northern German-controlled Norway, was the launching point of many of these lifeline convoys. Following close to shore, the convoys were relatively safe until they reached the southern coast of Norway. If the vessels safely reached the vicinity of the Skaggerak they were relatively safe until they reached Kiel. It was in these open waters as well as amongst the islands, leads and fjords of Norway that 404 Squadron was to see the bulk of its anti-shipping actions.\n\nLater in the War, the squadron continued its maritime interdiction missions from bases in England, concentrating on the French coastline before returning to Scotland to finish its wartime service.\n\n404 (Coastal Fighter) Squadron Formation\n\nAuthority to form 404 Coastal Fighter (CF) Squadron of the RCAF was granted by Headquarters, Coastal Command on 15 April 1941. It was to be part of No. 16 Group of the Royal Air Force Coastal Command. The new Canadian squadron was to take the Command’s motto, “find the enemy, strike the enemy, protect our ships” to heart.\n\nThis is the first official photo taken of 404 Squadron, in August 1941. Showing a group of officers, it was taken in the Officer’s Mess. (L to R) F/L D MacKenzie of Sarnia, Ont; S/L PH Woodruff of Edmonton, F/L KK Hay-Roe of Toronto, P/O Observer AWC Tustin of Niagara Falls, Ont; F/L EH McHardy (DFC) of Waypawa, NZ (PL 4783)\n\nThrough its four years of wartime existence, the squadron was to face many challenges, such as 18 moves to different bases, exult in breathless victories, such as protecting the west flank of the D-Day invasion by taking on three deadly destroyers, and suffer cruel tragedy, such as the loss of 6 of 11 aircraft during a mission on the infamous Black Friday; 9 February, 1945. The squadron was to inscribe 116 names on the Roll of Honour, commemorating fallen comrades and celebrate the awarding of two Distinguished Service Orders (DSO), one George Medal (GM), sixty Distinguished Flying Crosses (DFC) and ten Distinguished Flying Medals (DFM) by the time the Squadron was disbanded in May, 1945.\n\nApril 1941\n\nEarly 1941 was a cruel time for the Allied cause. Though the Battle of Britain was past, and the skies over Britain were relatively safe, the Battle of the Atlantic was raging, with U-Boat attacks inflicting horrible losses on Allied shipping, and the enemy still holding air superiority over most of Europe. The USA was yet to join the cause, and Russia lay in quietude far to the east. It was during these dark and uncertain times that the nucleus of the newly formed 404 Squadron started to coalesce in southern England. The squadron was formed and commenced training at RAF Station Thorney Island in Southern England.\n\nAs a unit in Coastal Command, it was to serve in the anti-shipping role along with two other RCAF squadrons: 407, flying Hudsons and 415 flying Beauforts. Even though they fought within the same Command, these units would not fly together on operations at any time through the duration of the War. 415 Squadron eventually transferred to Bomber Command in 1944.\n\nThe original plan for the manning of the Squadron called for as many Canadians to be posted in as was possible, with the original squadron strength to be 66 comprised of ten pilots, two observers, six wireless operators/ air gunners, and ground staff. The Canadian identity was hoped to be a result of taking on Canuck aircrew graduating from the Empire Air Training Scheme (later the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan – BCATP). Though other RCAF Squadrons were able to quickly develop this Canadian character, as will be seen in this history, 404 Squadron would take a much longer time to achieve the same goal.\n\n(L to R) P/O DH Inglis of Vancouver; F/O FJ Kelch of Kent, Eng; F/L TE Kirk of Montreal; S/L Ian Watson of Winnipeg, Man; P/O JW Hoadley of Kamloops, BC; P/O JG Dunlop of Gronlid, Sask; F/O C Fletcher of Toronto. (PL 4784)\n\nSquadron records note that the first member of the new unit was F/O Albert Edward ‘Doc’ Ward who arrived on 25 April, ready to begin his duties as Medical Officer. You can imagine his dismay at finding nothing to practice his medical skills on other than 18 Mark IV and one Mark I Blenheim aircraft which had been delivered to the Station in allotment to the unit.\n\nThe Blenheim was a somewhat old, though sturdy, aircraft from which the squadron was to see yeoman service. The twin-engined Blenheims were originally designed to be a light bomber but were modified by adding four fixed, forward-firing .303 caliber machine-guns beneath the fuselage. With a 260 mph top speed, it would be no match for pursuing Luftwaffe fighters, and it was understood at that time that the Blenheim would not be able to provide adequate protection to convoys. The aircraft taken on strength by 404 Squadron were in essence ‘hand-me-downs’ from an RAF Squadron that was being outfitted with Beaufighters. The first entry about the aircraft in the Operational Record Book (ORB) notes “.owing to their condition, Z5693, Z5740, N3542, P4845, N3526 and N3600 had been put up for disposal by the Station CTO (Chief Technical Officer)”, thus, in essence, would not be available for flying training.\n\nSo it was with a slightly reduced fleet of aircraft that F/O Doc Ward met his new Commanding Officer who arrived during the first week of April. Squadron Leader Patrick Henry Woodruff (right) was posted to Thorney Island on April 4 to command the Squadron. A native of Edmonton, Woodruff had originally joined the RAF in 1937 on a short service commission.\n\nAlong with newly arrived Adjutant, P/O Raymond Crump, S/L Woodruff made arrangements for the unit to take up permanent residence in No. 4 Hangar. Three days later, the CO was off to RCAF Headquarters to talk to the Air Officer Commanding (AOC), Air Commodore LF Stevenson, and the Officer in charge of Personnel, Wing Commander Foss. The new squadron now had a home and aircraft, but what were urgently needed at this time was personnel to fly the Blenheims. The AOC suggested ‘that as the Commanding Officer, No. 404 Squadron, is a fully qualified Coastal Command twin-engine Fighter instructor and that as the Squadron is starting from scratch, it might be reasonable in this instance to post aircrew straight from P(ersonnel) R(eception) C(enters) to the squadron ‘ A signal to this effect was sent to the Records Office in Gloucester and slowly but surely the official wheels began to turn and ground crew began to trickle in. It seems that it took a significant amount of time to get crews to fill the billets due to the Coastal Command OTU being full, and Fighter and Bomber Commands were not willing to give up their graduates.\n\nMay & June 1941\n\nMay 1941\n\nAmong the first aircrew to arrive at 404 was a complete crew transferred from 234 Squadron of the RAF: Pilot Sergeant Lacy, Observer Sergeant Shallcross and Wireless Operator Air Gunner (WAG) Sergeant Bell. P/Os Lown, Pearson, McLean, Garbutt and Wood, all from the flight School at RAF Cranwell, soon joined but were only on squadron two days before they were on their way to 2 (C) OTU at Catfoss. In addition, on 8 May, two senior aircraftsmen, F/S Maxon, Equipment Assistant, and Sgt Maidens,\n\nFitter Aero Engine, arrived and commenced taking over squadron stores. P/O JR Matthews joined the squadron on 11 May 1941. A Wireless Operator/ Air Gunner, he is seen entering a Blenheim just forward of the gunner’s cupola.\n\nTraining did not wait until the squadron complement was complete, and almost from the very first day, squadron members embarked on a strenuous program of ground instruction. Lessons in cockpit drill, petrol and hydraulic systems became the norm as the new arrivals came to know the Blenheims that they would be flying. The ground school was followed by endless hours in the air learning the idiosyncrasies of this aircraft and honing their skills for that day when 404 Squadron would become operational.\n\nThis hard work was not without its cost. The first prang by the squadron occurred on May 21 when Blenheim L6393 made a hard landing in the mud at the end of the aerodrome. The aircraft was wrecked, but the pilot, Sgt McLean, escaped with only cuts and bruises while the WAG, Sgt McElman, broke his leg. A Fitter, Cpl Walls , who was flying with the crew escaped with minor injuries and likely a somewhat less than favourable opinion of aircrew.\n\nOn 24 May, 17 Flight Mechanic ‘E’ technicians from Wittering were posted to the unit.\n\nJune 1941\n\nAt the beginning of the month, the influx of new personnel continued from 3 PRC. On 1 June, DH Inglis, GDC Bell, IAM Barber, WE Dale, JG MacKay, RK McKay and RF Leighton arrived, followed two days later by JG Dunlop, TW Coy, EG Allen, J Shaw and Hanson. While this in itself may not seem note worthy, it is an unfortunate historical note that of these aircrew, eight of the twelve were killed within eight months.\n\nTraining continued at a furious pace until the squadron was ordered to move to Castletown, Caithness, Scotland, on 20 June 1941, and would be operating under the control of 18 Group. The entire move, accomplished by air, rail and truck, took a mere three days. This event, however, was not without incident as was recorded in the squadron scrapbook:\n\n“June 22 – Sgt Lacy and crew attempted to return (from Thorney Is) but had to land at Usworth owing to very bad thunderstorm. This was later questioned by the blokes at Castletown as they considered it a wrangle. The aircraft had to be unloaded on account of the size of the ‘drome and transported by road to Oustom.”\n\n“June 23 – Sgt Lacy and crew pulled another fast one and looked up Sgt Shallcross’s WAAF Sergeant at Dyce! Spending a night there and an enjoyable evening in Aberdeen. NOTE: This should not be allowed as the morale of the remainder at Castletown will suffer very badly.\n\n“\n\n“June 24 – Sgt Lacy and crew decided to return to Castletown – probably ran out of money.”\n\nWith the last crew finally on the ground in Castletown, the squadron got back to business and continued to train towards becoming operational.\n\nJuly & August 1941\n\nJuly 1941\n\n(L to R) Sgt RW Harrison of Sheffield, Eng; Sgt LM McLean of Rumichy, Sask; Sgt WD Copland of Belfast, Ireland; Sgt HA Goggin of Elgin, NB (PL 4785)\n\nOn 1 July, the ORB bespoke what the personnel felt of their home at Castletown. Many were looking for a move due to “extremely poor facilities for training and organization at that station”. The Officer in Charge (OIC) for Training in the District, W/C McMurtrie, promised to convey this to the Headquarters of Coastal Command in order to try to get a change of scenery for the Squadron – possibly to RAF Dyce.\n\nOn 2 July, the Squadron Rumble club came into being with approximately 42 offences on the prohibited list. These ‘rumbles’ were fines that were levied for mishaps around the squadron that the CO felt were preventable. There are several occasions in the scrapbook that Rumble! is the outcome of a misadventure. Sgt Schoales, on the 4th, “on landing, burst the port tyre, ran off runway and finished up on nose. None of the crew hurt. Unfortunately he got ‘rumbled’ 2/6″ for minor damage. ” Three days later, on 7 July, the unit lost another aircraft when the pilot, Sgt Barber, forgot to lower his gear upon landing. The only casualty was the aircraft, which was a write-off, but Sgt Barber received a visit to the Commanding Officer and a five-pound ‘rumble’ to help him remember his landing gear in the future. To add insult to injury, the scrapbook has two photos of the pranged Blenheim titled “Barber’s effort!” Sometimes, the tone of the entry into the scrapbook bespoke a quiet disapproval of a decision; on 9 July, Sgt Campbell with WAG Sgt Harris in Z5750 “burst tyre on takeoff, informed by R/T (radio telephone) and made excellent landing in grass. Sgt Harris suffered injury to back. 2/6 Rumble. “\n\nNO PHOTO\n\n(L to R) Sgt AG Walker of Glasgow, Scotland,; Sgt P McCarthy of London, Eng; Sgt FS Lacey of Timmins, Ont; Sgt A Bell of Glasgow, Scot; Sgt CDG Brown of Windsor, Ont.\n\nThroughout July, the unit conducted normal training with only a few special events to break the monotony. The fifth of the month was indeed quite special as it was a day off due to weather. The aircrew celebrated by traveling either to Wick or to Thurso for a bath as there being no bathing facilities in Castletown.\n\nOn 12 July, “the officers of the squadron had plenty of nerve and threw out a challenge for a football match against the ‘crack’ Air Crew side. A certain person couldn’t resist a bet and managed to win a tenner from the Commanding Officer because the officers got duffed-up to the tune of 7-0! The (officers) tried pretty hard but suffered probably from ‘alcoholic wind’ which helped the Air Crew who train on milk. A challenge return match for a crate of beer was refused by the officers.” A handwritten note next to this, “amendment – For AIR CREW read senior NCOs (I should think so!!)”\n\n(l to r) Sgt JH Harris, Sgt DW Campbell, Sgt JH Oliver, Sgt RJ Williams, Sgt A Rogers, Sgt WR Christison, Sgt RA Schoales\n\nThe squadron held its first dance on 18 July and as one squadron member recalls\n\n“.(it) turned out a successful venture. There were bags of local talent and quite a number of WAAFs from Wick turned up in force. A certain A/Obs celebrated his 21st birthday and got quite merry but where he got the figure 21 from is like nobody’s business.”\n\nFinally, on 26 July, the squadron received orders to proceed to RAF Station Skitten, a satellite aerodrome on Wick, where they were to replace 607 Fighter Squadron. On the following day, the unit commenced the move leaving behind two aircraft, which were unserviceable.\n\nAugust 1941\n\nAlthough the location was different at Skitten, the daily routine for the squadron did not change much at all – practice and more practice. 9 August saw the squadron lose another aircraft when Sgt RK McKay crashed in Blenheim L6178 while carrying out single engine circuits and landings. No one was injured, but the aircraft was a wreck. Flying continued, and on 10 August the squadron took part in Exercise Leapfrog, which was a combined exercise with the navy, army and RAF involving an attempted invasion of the Orkney Islands. Throughout the remainder of the month the squadron continued to practice air to air firing, formation flying, fighter attacks and formation flying in clouds.\n\nSilhouette shot of technicians (Erks) working on a Bristol Blenheim (Christison collection)\n\nOn 28 August, the squadron was detailed for its first operational mission. P/O EW ‘Teddy’ Pierce was detailed for the trip to patrol and carry out a square search, two thirds of the way to Norway for a surface vessel that was sending out signals. Perhaps anti-climactically, Pierce had to return owing to engine trouble. Pierce’s pals pulled no punches in the Scrap Book with their comments about what happened to cancel the mission.\n\nJanuary & February 1942\n\nJanuary 1942\n\nAt the start of the year, the squadron was still based out of Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands, with a detachment flying from Dyce. Daily life consisted of training both on the ground and in the air, the occasional Norwegian patrol, but, more often than not, the unit members were stuck on the ground putting up with the severe limitations of Scottish weather.\n\nDuring these early years of the war, the Kreigsmarine was still a potent force with battleships, battle cruisers, cruisers and a pocket battleship still threatening the seas. High-grade iron ore from Sweden was shipped from Narvik to Germany, and freighters along the coast transported other cargo so invaluable to the Reich. These vessels became primary targets for the 404 Blenheims.\n\nSeveral new members of 404 Squadron arrived at this time. Posted in from No. 2 (C) OTU were Sgt Moore (Observer), Sgt Wilson (WAG), Sgt Knowles (WAG), Sgt Bennett (Observer), Sgt Morrow (Pilot) and Sgt Griffith (WAG). It was not long before these gentlemen were hard at work partaking in the never ceasing training flights, learning about their aircraft.\n\nLife on the ground could be dangerous even without the prospect of enemy action. On 8 January, AC2 Stanley Leslie Gregory was killed when he walked into an airscrew. A Board of Inquiry was held the same day and the accident was deemed to be the result of an error in judgment. A moment’s inattention had cost a squadron member his life.\n\nOn 15 January, two squadron crews were involved in air-to-air combats. P/O Inglis was flying Blenheim ‘Q’ Z5736 on a South Stab (the name of a patrol area) patrol off the Norge coast when his observer spotted a He.111 flying at 50 feet. Inglis attacked from astern, seeing strikes from the rear gunner’s position, along the fuselage and into the engine. Inglis quickly banked away to allow his rear-gunner to fire a long burst into the 111. The Heinkel jettisoned its bombs while Inglis returned for another quarter attack, followed by the enemy making ‘S’ turns back towards Norway. A second attack was also seen to pour tracer into the wing root and fuselage. One He.111 was claimed as ‘probable’.\n\nS/L McHardy in ‘X’ 6279 was patrolling at 1000 feet when a He.115 was spotted at sea level three miles to port. McHardy put in three attacks with long bursts, the first being in complete surprise. The Blenheim’s gunner also fired. The He.115 climbed steeply attempting to escape into cloud, with smoke emitting from the port engine and fuselage, McHardy again attacked the struggling aircraft from below until his ammunition was exhausted. The enemy aircraft was starting to lurch and its nose was starting to dip when contact was lost. The 115 was claimed as ‘possible’.\n\nJanuary in Sumburgh was not pleasant, especially if you wanted to fly, let alone get outside for a breath of fresh air. The Squadron War Record summed up its progress:\n\n“Great difficulty has been experienced in making much progress in training during January, owing namely to very inclement weather, and operational requirements. However, during the few finer periods every effort was made to get the new crews into the air on navigational exercises, formation, local reconnaissance, air-firing and night flying practice. In spite of difficulties, the crews are shaping very satisfactorily.”\n\nEvery new day brought increased attempts to get the aircraft in the air. One such attempt, on 30 January, resulted in the loss of aircraft ‘T’ V5735 when S/L McHardy, testing the runways, slid off the icy surface and damaged the aircraft beyond the ability of the unit to repair. “.more spare parts as we are very short of same ” This quickly brought an end to flying duties for the day.\n\nIt was not without reason that Sumburgh was known as that ‘awful place’. Sgt Bobbie Schoales, a veteran pilot of 404, summed up his feelings about the Shetland Islands in the following poem (a copy of which is in the scrapbook dated 18 June, 1942):\n\nThe bloody town’s a bloody mess,\n\nNo bloody trains nor bloody bus,\n\nNo one cares for bloody us,\n\nHo! Bloody Shetlands.\n\nThe bloody roads are bloody bad,\n\nThe bloody folks are bloody mad.\n\nThey make the brightest – bloody sad\n\nHo!

Late in the afternoon, the Ju.88 dropped a 500 and 200 pound bomb on the station, which fell beyond the hangar lines causing little damage. After the bombs had been dropped, the 88 returned to strafe the barracks and hangar areas. As a result of the gunfire, six airmen were injured. Two of the injured succumbed to their wounds; AC1 DM Clark and AC2 N Leitch. Seven squadron aircraft were hit and rendered temporarily unserviceable for seven days. Gowler described the incident in his diary;\n\n“I was out on the dispersal on “C” for the first time when Jerry came over. He first riddled our huts with machine guns killing Leech in our hut Erickson had his life saved by the bullet striking “Speed’s” shaving kit and then a pepper shaker which ricocheted the bullet past his head. One bullet struck about four feet from my bed. He then flew over the hangars and shot Clark who only lived a little while and shot the hangars and planes full of holes with explosive cannon shells and machine gun bullets. The kite I had just finished the major on (“B”) was struck in a half dozen places…Cpl Pooley had a bullet go through all his clothes and greatcoat and roughened his skin at the same time (pretty close).”\n\nAfter this loss, training once again took precedence with the newer members of the unit doing numerous circuits and bumps. For the older members of 404 Squadron, many had to adjust to wearing higher ranks as authority for many promotions was received from Records.\n\nOperationally, things were rather quiet for the next few weeks with only three patrols having any success. On 7 February, F/L Foster and crew tangled with a Ju.88 while on a Norwegian patrol and claimed several hits (‘damaged’). That same day, F/S GDC Bell and crew severely damaged a He.111. On 9 Feb, an He.111 was claimed as ‘damaged’.\n\nOn 10 February, Gowler notes in his diary that Flin Flon Floosie III had been involved in a combat and ‘got shot up’. It was also noted that the ‘Jerry’ was shot up as well.\n\nYet again, Gowler’s comments are an invaluable resource when researching life on the squadron during the early war years. Security was high on people’s minds, and fears of enemy actions, especially after the recent attack on the aerodrome, were always present. He noted the loss of two 235 Squadron Beaus on 11 February and one more on the 12th. “We fear that there has been some saboteurs at work on them” Nothing further of these fears is found in squadron records.\n\nLife on squadron was not always glamorous. Here are two armourers checking the guns of a Blenheim’s rear turret. At left is AC1 JD Ayers of Vancouver and at right is LAC CR Watt of Montreal (PL 7691).\n\nTen days later, Sgt Schoales and his crew in ‘C’ had a bit more luck when they met several Me.109 fighters off the Norge coast. In a running battle, Schoales turned to intercept the enemy aircraft that was closing on his rear, but the German over flew the Blenheim. A second Me.109, also closing from the rear, became the target of a rather excited rear gunner who fired over 400 rounds of ammunition from each gun. The German aircraft fell away into a vertical dive towards the sea with flames pouring from the engine. The Blenheim received only minor damage. On these occasions, none of the 404 aircrew had been hurt.\n\nHowever, the squadron’s good fortunes ran out on 21 February. Blenheim ‘F’ V5433 crashed on Gurnay Island, Outer Skerries, Shetlands, while returning from a Norwegian recce flight. Pilot F/S CDG Brown, observer F/S JH Oliver and WAG Sgt TW Coy died in the crash. The Squadron’s War Record wrote about their final moments as follows:\n\n“An SOS had been received at 0830 hours by Flying Control, No.18 Group, approximately 40 minutes after the aircraft was due to leave the Norwegian coast. At 0840 hours, and SOS was received at Sumburgh and a message that the Wireless Transmitter (W/T) was unserviceable; also a bearing of 045 degrees true was obtained. Further bearings were taken and from 0851 to 0951 hours the aircraft was plotted by fighters as coming in steadily on its course. (When located after crashing) the aircraft was burnt out, but the rear part of the fuselage and tail, which were whole, were found to have a number of bullet holes in them. On interviewing the Coast Guard, it was found that the aircraft had approached the outer Skerries on one engine and apparently in difficulty. It crashed in attempting a landing on a small flat area on an island and had caught fire. It was felt that the aircraft was intercepted some distance off the Norge coast and during the engagement was probably damaged by enemy fire.”\n\nSeven days later, the bodies of F/S Brown and F/S Oliver were interred at Lerwick with full military honours. The body of Sgt Coy was returned to his parents’ home.\n\nF/S Oliver (L) and pilot F/S Brown, shown in a photo taken Aug 1941. This is an actual operational photo taken during a North Sea patrol, likely by Sgt Coy, the WAG. (PL 4789)\n\nMarch and April 1942\n\nMarch 1942\n\nOn 3 March, a ground incident was described. “Had a very close call yesterday morning on “C”. Mackenzie was running her up and the port oleo leg buckled letting the plane settle to the runway and as it settled down the prop started to cut into the runway of the dispersal and gouged out a big hole, then the strain was too great and the whole A(ir)/S(crew) assembly even the epicyclic gearing came away and the whole assembly started to spin through the air towards Doig and myself and just grazed us and then crashed to the ground behind us. As it hit the ground the three blades tore pieces out of the sod before coming to rest on the cylinder end of the V/P assembly .” The aircraft was written off due to the damage. The cause of the incident was that there we no locking devices on the undercarriage.\n\nOn 23 March, the squadron was purged of 19 aircrew to 143 Squadron.\n\nWireless Mechanics of 404 squadron of Coastal Command overseas check the aerial installation of one of the squadron’s aircraft. (L to R) Cpl A Main and Cpl AL Buck. Note that the ‘EE’ below the cupola are the 404 Squadron Code, used early in the War. (PL 7695)\n\nOn 25 March, the squadron completed another move, this time returning from their foray in Sumburgh and returning to RAF Station Dyce in Scotland. The move had been ordered on thy 14th with the aircrew flying out five days later. For the next two months, action was sporadic with no successes to add to the squadron’s score.\n\nThe Squadron’s personnel totals for the end of March, 1942:\n\nRCAF Aircrew Officers 13\n\nRCAF Groundcrew Officers 4\n\nRCAF Airmen 26\n\nRCAF Groundcrew 142\n\nRAF Aircrew Officers 7\n\nRAF Groundcrew Officers 2\n\nRAF Airmen 44\n\nRAF Groundcrew 151\n\nTotal 389\n\nIt is interesting to note that the 541 (Details of Sorties Flown) for March is pretty much missing. This likely happened during the war, as there is a hand-written note in a margin of the ORB for the end of the month which states “The Central Stat Branch (London) gives 54 sorties for a total of 203 operational hours. KAC (initials) 5 Aug 46”\n\nApril 1942\n\nDuring a sortie flown on 22 April, S/L Foster gave chase to an enemy aircraft while on a Navigation Exercise. S/L McHardy attacked and damaged a Ju.88, leaving one of the enemy aircraft’s engines smoking. Five days later, F/L EW Pierce had a crack at a He.115 that was conducting mine-laying operations 150 miles off of the coast. It is not recorded if the attack was successful.\n\nF/O George Burton (far left), Squadron Engineering Officer, observes a group of RAF ‘erks’ working on the port engine of a Blenheim. (PL 7693)\n\nA year into the life of the squadron, the crews still found themselves flying the tired Blenheims. This fact rankled at the crews in that each time they faced air combat with the German fighters, knowing that they were vastly outmatched by the sleek Me.109s and powerful FW.190s. The concerns about flying what was originally designed to be a bomber aircraft in a Coastal Fighter role came to a head when W/C Woodruff wrote directly to Overseas Headquarters,\n\n“Our Blenheims are rather old and, as you will realise, rather out of date. I am told that there are no Beaufighters to spare but have been given to believe that Mosquitoes are coming out fairly quickly now, and I feel the Fighter Mosquito would be considerably better for our job than the Beaufighter because of its superior maneuverability. My boys have done their best with the Blenheims and I feel that they are reaching the stage where they feel they should be supplied with more modern tools, i.e. Mosquitoes. If you could possibly do anything to hurry up our re-equipping I would indeed be grateful.”\n\nThe Mosquito would not even be considered, at that time, as a suitable replacement aircraft for a Coastal Command squadron, even when a Commanding Officer demanded it. W/C Woodruff was not led down the garden path, though, and was told that the squadron was to be given high priority for replacement of the Blenheims by Beaufighters. Still, even with his urgent appeal for better aircraft, the squadron was to continue to fly outdated equipment for another four months.\n\nIn the same letter in which the CO was raising concerns about the Squadron being saddled with obsolete aircraft, the problem of the Canadian character of the unit was also noted. Many RAF personnel were released from the squadron without replacement, even though missions continued. Woodruff politely noted that 404 was seven crews under strength.\n\nSquadron personnel as of April 1942:\n\nRCAF Aircrew Officers 17\n\nRCAF Groundcrew Officers 4\n\nRCAF Airmen 20\n\nRCAF Groundcrew 181\n\nRAF Aircrew Officers 7\n\nRAF Groundcrew Officers 1\n\nRAF Airmen 35 RAF\n\nGroundcrew 170\n\nTotal 435\n\nJanuary & February 1943\n\nOff to Chivenor\n\nIn January, 404 Squadron continued its long established routine of flying from Dyce, Skitten and Sumburgh. On 7 January, “Cancelled detachment slated for Leuchars…Rush call for a detachment to Sumburgh”. Most of the aircrew were quickly gone, but the groundcrew were delayed when a tire burst on their Harrow transport plane. Many of these groundcrew were still waiting to get to their aircraft four days later…\n\nEverything seemed to be quite ordinary until, on 16 January, a squadron security parade was held and addressed by the Commanding Officer, W/C Truscott. The subject of his talk was the necessity for silence about the upcoming move of the squadron to RAF Chivenor. The squadron was to be sent to Chivenor in Devonshire to take part in the great air battles then being fought over the Bay of Biscay by Coastal Command. The unit’s role during the three months it was to remain at Chivenor under the control of 19 Group, and to provide long-range fighter escort for the anti-submarine and reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nThe main party arrived at Chivenor on 22 January followed by the Beaufighters and Blenheims the next day. As a squadron member recalled:\n\n“It was not with a heavy heart that the unit prepared to depart sunny Scotland for the south of England. On January 22 the main party arrived in Chivenor and by January 25, the squadron had settled in. The remainder of the month was taken up with local flying to get used to the new surroundings.”\n\nFebruary 1943\n\nAfter a period of training at Chivenor, the 404 Beaufighters began operations over the Bay of Biscay by mid-February. Duties included interception patrols, trying to catch Luftwaffe meteorological planes gathering weather data, but with no luck for the Buffaloes. Other missions included convoy escorts and fishing-fleet patrols, again with the unit seeing very little enemy activity.\n\nOn 4 February,\n\n“We deeply regret to have to presume one of the pigeons carried on search as ‘missing whilst engaged on ASR operations’. The rear of Tiger Browne’s aircraft blew open during flight and the pigeon – complete in box – went diving down to a watery grave. All Reg Dickey’s efforts to save it were of no avail.” Below this is inscribed “Footnote: This pigeon has since returned to its loft. Method of escape unknown!”\n\nThe Air Officer in Chief of Coastal Command, Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, visited Chivenor on 9 February and discussed the re-equipping of 404 Squadron . These discussions likely involved the squadrons training toward the Mk XI Beaufighter. On 19 February, the squadron was again visited, this time by Air Vice Marshal Curtiss (RCAF HQ Overseas). He left the same day.\n\nMarch & April 1943\n\nBeaufighter Mk XIC\n\nOn 9 March, the first of the new Beaufighter Mk XICs arrived.\n\nOn 23 March, led by S/L de la Haye, six of these new aircraft were on an interception patrol over the Bay of Biscay. They sighted seven Ju.88s two miles dead ahead at 200 feet and immediately gave chase. Four of the enemy aircraft climbed into the clouds and were chased by Beaufighters from the patrol. F/O Schoales attempted a long 1000-yard shot at one of the fleeing aircraft, but was unable to see any strikes. The other three Junkers remained at low level and two Beaus attempted to engage the enemy. R/404, flown by F/S VF McCallan attacked one JU.88 from astern by firing four cannon bursts. Hits were seen on the enemy’s port wing and engine, which emitted heavy black smoke, and pieces, including a foot square chunk, fell from the wing. The JU.88 turned violently to port, and McCallan, in trying to turn within the enemy’s maneuver, stalled before firing two more bursts of cannon at close range. Another attack by F/S HR Browne in “T” followed with two one-second bursts from 500 and 300 yards, with no strikes observed. The enemy managed to evade the Beaufighters and escaped into the cloud. Even though the combats only claimed damaged, two Ju.88s were destroyed; Schoales was credited with one, while McCallan and Browne shared the other.\n\nF/S HR Browne, who shared in the shooting down of a Ju.88 (PL 19441)\n\nAs evidenced by this action, the Luftwaffe had a healthy respect for the ability of the Beaufighters. Ju.88s would not take the chance against these agile coastal fighters unless they had a strong numeric advantage, and if more than one Beaufighter was encountered, the Ju.88s would clear off.\n\nDuring the month, the squadron also took time out to help P/O J Campbell, an original member of the squadron, celebrate his marriage to S/O Edna M Knight in Worthing, Sussex. As always, a marriage offered an opportunity to celebrate and to forget (for the time being) the rigours of war. On 26 March, F/O RC Field (pilot) and Sgt CF Taylor (WAG) were killed in a flying accident. The stricken aircraft “crashed from about a hundred feet in Cornwall and the machine exploded killing both him and his Observer when the machine hit the ground.”\n\nP/O JDW ‘Pat’ Campbell, an original member of 404 Squadron (PL 10876)\n\nOn 27 March, it was again made apparent how dangerous an environment the aircrew had to fly in during each sortie:\n\n“F/O Campbell had a very close call today as he was flying too close to the sea and he hit a wave with one of his propellors and broke about a foot off of two blades. He managed, however, to land at a drome in Cornwall.”\n\nSurely, some wave clipping did not end with the same positive results – how many crews that ‘failed to return’ were claimed in a moment such as this?\n\nApril 1943\n\nThe zone of operations became focused on Norwegian Coastal waters, thus it was not a surprise that the squadron soon found itself on the way back to Scotland on 2 April, this time to Tain, north of Inverness, again under the control of 18 Group.\n\n“This station is about one of the worst yet. The hangars are about a mile from the Mess hall and some of the dispersals about a mile further on again from the hangars. The billets are about a half-mile the other side of the mess hall so there is plenty of walking to be done. Sanitary conditions very poor around billets and no place to wash or have a bath close than the mess hall. All in all, a grim proposition. ” The squadron was only subjected to the inhospitable station for less than three weeks, likely to the great relief of all.\n\nAfter the brief stay at Tain, the unit moved back into its old quarters at Wick on 20 April and was to remain for a little over a year. 404 joined the Wick Strike Wing and was to fly its future missions with 144 (RAF) Squadron torpedo-carrying Beaufighters (Torbeaus), and the torpedo-carrying Hampdens of 489 (RNZAF) Squadron. 404 flew anti-flak support during strikes using machine-gun and cannon, and during the Squadron’s twelve-month stay in Wick it would be equipped with rocket projectiles. Actually 404 aircrew would be responsible for developing tactics to use the new weapon.\n\nDuring the first two weeks there, several incidents took place that that proved that Beaufighters could be very dangerous on the ground – especially to unwary technicians. Cpl Ferrier and LAC Bowden both found out that it is indeed possible to fall off an aircraft that is not moving. The injuries they suffered were minor and served to remind the rest of the ground crew and aircrew of the need to be vigilant around dispersal. On 19 April, 404 Squadron had its first taste of action since returning to Scotland, in cooperation with 144 Squadron. F/S KS Miller, pilot of one of three Buffalo aircraft on a Norwegian patrol, sighted one German merchant vessel and one escort vessel. He immediately turned to attack, commencing the firing run from 600 yards out and closing to within 75 yards of the vessels. The first burst fell well short but the three following bursts produced results. Several cannon strikes were observed on the superstructure just aft of the bridge of the merchant vessel. The aircraft then broke away to the stern, keeping the escort ship between the aircraft and the merchant vessel. Flak and shell bursts were observed by the crewmembers of the Beaufighter as they flew away but there were no casualties.\n\nThis was the first of many engagements involving 404 Beaufighters against enemy convoys with their escorting flak ships and escorting fighter aircraft. On these strikes, the squadron flew escort to torpedo-carrying Beaufighters of an RAF squadron and Hampdens of a RNZAF unit, the role of 404 being to engage and neutralize the defending flak ships and fighters while the torpedo bombers closed in on the high value merchant vessels.\n\nSuccess! Teamwork with 144 Squadron\n\nThe slow evolution of tactics and how to get various squadrons to work together finally showed results later in the month. As stated previously, 404 was tasked at this stage of the war with acting as anti-flak escort. This very high-risk mission required the Buffalo crews to draw the fire of the highly gunned escort vessels, whose sole reason for being was to intercept and shoot down the vulnerable torpedo-carrying aircraft.\n\nOn 27 April, a sighting report off of Lister Fjord prompted the launch of six 404 Squadron Beaufighters and four 144 Squadron Torbeaus. The distance to the strike area necessitated a refueling stop at Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands. After flying to the patrol area at only 50 feet above the sea, a convoy of three vessels was found. The Trondhjemsfjord, a 6,753-ton Norwegian steamship and the 679-ton Amrum, a German Medium Tanker as well as an escort vessel, the UJ-1707 (Nordmeer), a 465-ton auxiliary trawler/ sub chaser were sighted and immediately attacked. The 404 Squadron Beaufighters took on the escort with machine gun and cannon fire, flying low and raking the vessels in passing while the aircraft of 144 Squadron released their torps and scored four hits on the merchant vessel. As a result of the attack, the Trondhjemsfjord, who was in ballast while enroute from Bergen to Kristiansand, sank off of Ryvingen Lighthouse, a victim of two torpedoes and was the squadron’s first credited sinking (along with 144). The Amrum and UJ-1707 were both damaged by shelling.\n\nThis action that lasted five minutes, but some of the squadron’s Beaus were badly damaged by German fire. ‘B’, crewed by F/S KS Miller and Sgt J Young was hit by flak.\n\n“Miller was wounded in the left arm; a 20mm shell had passed between the pilot and observer; a fire extinguisher knocked from its bracket had exploded in the cockpit; the port engine had been damaged, port inner cannon hit, and three cannon doors blown off. ‘G’ (Sgt RL Carter, Sgt JW Adamson) had been hit by flak in the fuselage and elevators”.\n\nThe port engine of the aircraft flown by F/O RA Schoales with navigator P/O AD Powell, ‘Q’, had a cannon shell pass through it. At the same time, F/O Schoales was wounded in the arm by shrapnel but he still managed to bring the aircraft safely back to base despite his wound and the damage to the aircraft. For this feat, along with others, Schoales was eventually awarded the DFC. Though it seems that the squadron took serious damage for their efforts, it is testament to the Buffalo crews’ effectiveness in protecting 144 that none of the torpedo aircraft were fired on. From the ORB, “Crews of 144 Squadron consider success largely due to Beaufighter escort of 404 Squadron drawing fire of escort vessels. None of the merchant vessels or escort vessels fired at 144 Squadron aircraft.”\n\nComment found on the website\n\nThe webpage for the history of 404 Squadron is well presented. I was a member of the squadron from April 1943 to July 1944. The write-up about the events of May 1st, 1943 should include the name of the Pilot and the Nav(W) which were David Andrew as the pilot and André Lauzon as navigator . They were flying the Beaufighter “B”. The aircraft was hit by over 100 machine gun bullets. No 20 mm cannon were fired; the Messerschmitt pilot had evidently not engaged his cannons… This may explain why the Beau was able to make it back with 2 flat tires, the port engine leaking oil, no air pressure, and no hydraulics.\n\nIt would be appreciated if somehow the names of the aircrews were mentioned. Andrew and Lauzon both completed a 38 operations tour, terminating in July, 1944.\n\nI am enclosing a photo of the pilot David Andrew and the navigator Andre Lauzon, together with a photo of B taken by myself before the Beau was towed away in the hangar out of bounds.\n\nNote:\n\nI was contacted by André Lauzon’s daughter who shared some photos of her father’s collection of WWII photos.\n\nFrom the collection of André Lauzon\n\nAndré Lauzon\n\nAttack by Beaufighters\n\nFlak damage on his Beaufighter\n\nAndré Lauzon and David Andrews\n\nAndré Lauzon\n\nAndré Lauzon and David Andrews\n\nJanuary 1944\n\nAt the beginning of the year, 404 and 144 were joined by the Torbeaus of 489 Squadron. Thus, the Wick Wing of No 18 Group was comprised of torpedo, RP and anti-flak squadrons. This particular formation had just been put together for the purpose of striking an ever-increasing amount of enemy shipping. During the month, 18 Group made 65 attacks as compared to 50 in December, and was responsible for sinking 15,659 tons of shipping.\n\nOn 3 January, F/O Symons and F/O Barcham went to Tain to take charge of the RP training that was being conducted there. January was busy with many aircraft proceeding to Tain to conduct training on this weapon.\n\nOn the 9 January, the ORB notes that the aircrew had a ‘day devoted to fireside discussions’.\n\nReconnaissance missions were still playing an important part in the Squadron’s operational taskings. On 12 January two recces were conducted that demonstrated how rich the target environment was early in 1944. Seven crews carried out a Shipping Recce in the afternoon, and sighted a small merchant vessel and two escort vessels. An earlier recce off of the Stadtlandet area conducted by two crews sighted a tanker, a merchant vessel and four escort vessels. A second recce conducted at the same time by two crews sighted a further two merchant vessels and four escorts. No attacks on these vessels were made.\n\nOn 14 January, ten 404 and seven 144 Squadron anti-flak Beaufighters set out as the escort for eight torpedo-carrying Beaufighters (Torbeaus) from 144 on an anti-shipping patrol to the Naze off of southern Norway. The makeup of the force seems confusing, but it should be remembered that the Beaufighter TFX could either be armed to carry a torpedo (Torbeau) or to carry RPs (Flakbeau). The seven anti-flak Beaufighters from 144 Squadron were led by W/C CA Willis while 404 was led by F/O WD Thomsett after S/L Gatward was forced to return to base when a hatch blew open and could not be closed.\n\nThe force were in the air for only an hour and a half when they sighted two convoys, one with three merchant vessels and two escorts, the second convoy some miles astern of the first near Lista. The mechanics of the attacks are not clear, but it is known that both of the convoys were engaged. At 1153 hrs, the 404 anti-flak aircraft and 144 Squadron Torbeaus initiated attacks. O/404 (F/O Fair and Sgt Towns), G/404 (F/S Lorch and Sgt Huxtable) and F/404 (F/O Hodson and F/O Powell) attacked the leading escort vessel and claimed RP and cannon strikes. This vessel was likely the V5307 Felix Scheder, a 390-ton auxiliary whaler which received rocket strikes to the bridge area. M/404 (F/O Thomsett and F/O Webster) along with H/404 (F/O Keefe and W/O Steed) attacked the leading 4000-ton merchant vessel with M scoring two and H four hits. The 144 Squadron torpedo aircraft also attacked this vessel and reported that they saw explosions from the 404 attacks. This merchantman was likely the 5,179-ton German vessel Entrerios which received a torpedo hit on the stern and RP strikes on the bridge, foredeck and amidships. She was later confirmed destroyed, possibly by F/O Thomsett and F/O Keefe. Another steam ship, the 1,569-ton Norwegian vessel Maurita confirmed as damaged in the strike.\n\nF/L RW Webster checks his charts (PL 29815)\n\nF/O Johnny Symons (PL 28066)\n\nUnder the direction of Chuck Willis, the escorting RAF anti-flak Beaufighters attacked the second convoy and managed to put one of the ships out of action. This attack on the second convoy was not an optimal action, as in the anti-flak fitment severe damage could not be expected on the enemy vessels. The ORB notes that this flight ‘losing contact momentarily with the other formation in the cloud’ chose to engage the vessels. U/404 (F/O Symons (right) and F/O Barcham) attacked one of the escort vessels in the second convoy, claiming cannon strikes while the RPs ‘undershot’. The German merchant vessel Wittekind, a 4,029-ton iron ore freighter was sunk during her voyage from Narvik to Germany. A second strike force comprising 489 Squadron also struck this convoy.\n\nFor this mission the ORB noted, “Twenty four aircraft took part in this the largest operation to date of the Wick Beaufighter Wing.” Note that this formation was not called a Strike Wing in the ORB.\n\nUnfortunately, this action was not without cost – two Beaufighters from 404 Squadron did not return. P/O NB Hunt and navigator F/O Joiner were lost, Beaufighter ‘J’ LZ179 was seen to emit smoke while diving to attack and was not seen again, likely a victim to a flak strike. Also lost were F/O W Wilkie and F/O Evans in W/404. The aircraft lost height rapidly when 120 miles from base and ditched. It had been hit by flak while turning in to attack and was unable to launch its RPs. F/O Hodson in ‘F’ circled the site, but no survivors were seen in the dinghy. Along with the two Buffalo aircraft, one of the 144 Squadron aircraft also failed to return.\n\nOn 16 January, five 404 Squadron aircraft and one from 144 Squadron took part as escorts to 144 Torbeaus on a Rover Patrol. Landfall was made at Storholm Light and the patrol turned south along the coast to Stadtlandet. During the transit, two armed trawlers were sighted who opened fire on the patrol. N/404, flown by F/O Decloux and F/O Gilhespy, was hit. “The formation set course for base at 1426 from Gtterone Light and shortly afterward two explosions were seen from the starboard engine of ‘N’. It carried on for three minutes, maintaining level course. The pilot was then heard on VHF to say ‘This is it, chaps,’ the a/c touched down in ditching position, navigator fired a red Very light and the a/c hit the water and broke up. P/144 circled the area but no survivors, wreckage or dinghy seen “. The ORB states that the ditching had to be carried out in a heavy sea.\n\nOn 20 January, six Buffalo aircraft armed with RP, led by W/C Gatward in ‘R’ NE198 and escorted by an equal number of 144 Squadron anti-flak Beaufighters (including one photographic aircraft from 144) set out on patrol. The formation made landfall off Bremanger and turned north. A northbound convoy of one merchant and four escorts was sighted with a second convoy further north. All aircraft attacked the first convoy at 1131 hrs. The anti-flak aircraft took on the escort vessels while 404 concentrated on the merchantman, the 5,179-ton German merchant vessel Emsland. The ORB states that 30 rocket strikes were registered (each aircraft obtained at least two). T/404 (S/L Gatward and F/O Carlin) also attacked one of the escort vessels with RP. All planes also attacked with cannon. After this well executed attack, the Emsland was enveloped in steam and smoke and caught fire, a victim of multiple rocket strikes. She was beached as a result of the attack and was a total loss . The returning crews reported that one of the escort vessels was also damaged, with a large plume of black smoke enveloping the ship after an attack. Post war records indicate that in fact, three of the escorts received shell hits; the UJ-1102 Westfalen of 445 tons and UJ-1104 Oldenburg of 446 tons, both German Auxiliary Trawler/Sub Chasers, were listed as damaged. The third damaged vessel was the 320-ton German Auxiliary Whaler V-5304 Seehund . It is interesting to note that the ORB stated, “an enemy report admitted casualties among the crews. From a tactical point of view this was a most successful attack “.\n\nShulemson earns Distinguished Service Order\n\nOn 26 January, six 404 Squadron Beaufighters in strike configuration led by F/O Shulemson in ‘U’, and six from 144 as anti-flak escort were back in action. R/404 (F/O Fair and Sgt Towns) had to turn back to base due to engine trouble. This time the target was a convoy of three merchant vessels of 2,000 to 3,000-tons including the Finse, Orlanda and the tanker Kloveren along with three escort vessels and a minesweeper off of Stadlandet.\n\nOne of the Buffalo crews, F/O EJ Keefe and WO BG Steed, scored four hits on the minesweeper and left it burning. “F/O Keefe figuring he had been damaged made a suicide attack on one and blew it out of the water with his cannons and rocket projectiles. ” This vessel was likely a 560-ton German Auxiliary Whaler escort V-5908 Penang, listed as having been severely damaged in the attacks. Shulemson also attacked this vessel. WOs HE Hallatt and AD Glasgow registered four hits on an astern escort vessel. W/O French and Sgt Hathway in ‘T’ tried to attack this escort vessel, but the RP sight was unserviceable and forward hatch blew open. F/O Shulemson and his navigator F/O PR Bassett also attacked the merchant with two rockets striking.\n\nAn M-class minesweeper was sunk and two merchant vessels and two escort vessels seriously damaged with unknown identities. The ORB notes that accurate flak and rockets from the convoy and flak from shore was encountered. During the action, F/O JAC Dixon and Sgt E Pearce in ‘G’ NE328 were thought to have made a successful attack on the leading M/V but they almost immediately fell victim to three Me.109s and plunged into the sea. The 109s may have been alerted to the presence of the hostile aircraft when the unserviceable Beau broke radio silence rules by sending a Morse code message. This transmission “probably alerted German listening posts along the Norwegian coast. “\n\nF/O SS ‘Sid’ Shulemson standing in front of his Beaufighter (PL29809)\n\nF/O Shulemson, along with the other aircraft from Wick, was already heading for home with his damaged Beaufighter when he returned to aid a comrade. From Shulemson’s log:\n\n“Jumped by four Me.109Gs. P/O Dixon shot down. I attacked fighter chasing M/144 and had inconclusive combat”\n\nThe ORB states that Shulemson’s fire was ineffective, but this aggressive action caused the lethal enemy fighter to turn its attention from the beleaguered 144 aircraft to its pursuer. For several minutes, Shulemson fought for his life, taking violent evasive action with Bassett firing in defence using the Beaufighter’s machine-gun. He was taking hits from the 109, as well as from shore based flak emplacements. Using Coastal Command defensive tactics, the Beau made tight turns at very low altitude, an environment that the Me.109 was (not) best suited for. Shulemson eventually gained cloud cover and broke contact. Re-emerging from the cloud after four minutes, the enemy fighter was again sighted at 800 yards and immediately attacked. The crew fought off the Me.109 for a further ten minutes until Shulemson again made cloud cover. Due to his efforts, Shulemson eventually broke contact from the enemy fighter. A clearer insight into the life of a wartime pilot may be gleaned from the honest tone used in the final entry for that day in Shulemson’s log, “Many congratulations and drinks to a badly scared crew”. Shulemson won an immediate DSO for his actions being cited as a ‘skillful, courageous and determined leader whose example has inspired all’. From the ORB was the following annotation, “This was considered to be a very courageous and self-sacrificing action on F/O Shulemson’s part and it is quite probable that had he not attacked the ME109 M/144 would have suffered the fate of J/404.”\n\nPersonnel totals for January 1944\n\nRCAF Total Strength Establishment\n\nAIRCREW\n\nOfficer Aircrew\n\nPilots 17 20 13\n\nNavigators 4 13 13\n\nAirmen Aircrew\n\nPilots 5 6 12\n\nNavigators 6 15 12\n\nGROUND CREW\n\nOfficers 4 4 3\n\nAirmen 73 85 90\n\nAirwomen 0 18 15\n\nTOTAL 109 161 158\n\n66 Operational sorties were flown during then month for a total of 272.45 hours.\n\nFebruary & March 1944\n\nFebruary 1944\n\nWhile the Beaufighters were actively employed on escort and recce tasks during February, making many more sorties than in January, only one successful strike was reported.\n\nOn 1 February, a formation of nine 404 Beaufighters were escorted by five 144 Squadron aircraft on a RP Rover. S/L Ken Gatward led this mission. Making landfall at Utvaer, S/L Gatward realized that the visibility and cloud would not allow for a coordinated attack in the patrol area so, taking the initiative he turned his force to the north, searching for better weather and targets. 75 miles to the north, the force found and attacked a merchant vessel and four (three) escort vessels southbound off Stadtlandet. After the RAF aircraft had damaged a large escort ship astern of the M/V causing an explosion and fire, the RCAF crews in sections of three attacked the merchant vessel and two escorts. As a result of these well-coordinated attacks, the 3,096-ton German freighter Valencia was hit with RPs at the water line and on the superstructure, as well as by cannon fire and sank . The 527-ton German escort vessel UJ-1702 (FD62), an Auxiliary Trawler/Sub Chaser was also destroyed likely due to RP strikes from S/L Gatward. The attacks were made in very poor visibility and in the face of intense flak from the ships and shore. Post attack reports by the aircrew state that it was believed that three vessels were left burning, but only the two sinkings are noted in the CCWR. There were no casualties to the attacking force.\n\nOn 4 February, F/O Sydney Shulemson received the awarding of an immediate Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions as recounted on 26 January 1944. He is one of the youngest persons to receive this award during WW2. “This Officer has been working very hard. The Squadron is justly proud of him. “\n\nOn 11 February, the following awards were announced; pilot F/L KS Miller and his navigator P/O J Young were awarded the DFC. S/L AK Gatward (DFC) and Cpl GA Blower (Fitter) were recorded as having been Mentioned in Despatches.\n\nF/L KS Miller, DFC (PL 28063)\n\nThe following was recorded in the ORB for 18 February,\n\n“We received a signal from RCAF o/s (overseas) HQ today stating that a group of Toronto businessmen are anxious to adopt the squadron. The proposition appears to be a beneficial one from the standpoint of all ranks and we are pleased to accept this very kind offer. Leader of the group is Mr. R Pearce of the ‘Northern Miner Press’ of Toronto, and the group will undertake the task of supplying comforts, sports equipment and etc.”\n\nOn 21 February, “The Squadron mascot ‘Pete’, an Irish Setter pup, adopted by the Squadron when his owner, F/L Munro was reported missing (11 Nov 43) is sick with pneumonia. It is rumored the Medical Officer, F/L G ‘Doc’ Beacock, has prescribed Sulpha tablets. The report is that ‘Pete’ is coming along fine.” On 23 February it is reported that the popular pup was out of danger.\n\nAfter taking off to participate on a convoy escort, C/404 (F/O AH Hodson and F/O PA Powell) experienced some problems about halfway through the task.\n\n“The pilot noticed smoke coming from the batteries behind the pilot’s seat. He called the Navigator up to investigate. F/O Powell removed the wires from the terminals and the smoking stopped. When replacing wires, a small fire started but was quickly put out by the Navigator. The terminals were tightened, and all seemed in order, so the pilot decided to complete the patrol and not return to base before dark. After turning for home it was found that with exception of the intercom, all navigation, signals and wireless equipment was unserviceable. With the very low cloud, it was dangerous to fly inland so F/O Hodson flew on the coastline. He actually made landfall within 20 miles of base, but owing to darkness missed the station. The Pilot then decided to turn out to sea with the intention of ditching. However, they flew over a night Naval exercise in progress. One of the searchlights pointed its lights in the general direction of base and satellite lights were on, then the base put on the runway lights and after two attempts, F/O Hodson landed the aircraft safely. It was a very thrilling experience for this crew.”\n\nPersonnel totals for February 1944\n\nRCAF Total Strength Establishment\n\nAIRCREW\n\nOfficer Aircrew\n\nPilots 28 28 13\n\nNavigators 6 15 13\n\nAirmen Aircrew\n\nPilots 5 6 12\n\nNavigators 7 15 12\n\nGROUND CREW\n\nOfficers 4 4 3\n\nAirmen 70 86 90\n\nAirwomen 0 18 15\n\nTOTAL 120 172 158\n\n94 Operational sorties were flown for the month for 400.40 hours.\n\nMarch 1944\n\nMarch entered like a lion and for the Canadians at Wick there arrived something new to occupy their time – snow. From the 1st to the 4th, it seemed as if the snowfall would never stop, and accumulated faster than the Herculean efforts to clear it. As one Buffalo recalled,\n\n“there was not just a little bit of snow, but tons of the stuff. All available aircrew were on the end of a shovel. Creaking, aching and complaining muscles were the order of the day and no sign of the end of it at all”. This was to continue for days and it became obvious that people were not happy as this excerpt from the Squadron War Diary points out: “More snow than ever. What a life! Anyway, we have the honour of being the highest paid snow removers in the British Isles. All our work of yesterday is undone by good old mother nature. And the glory of it all was that SHQ and the ground wallahs had to lend a hand on the job. Snow fell all day but progress was made and by 1700 hours people were dropping in their tracks, but enough was done to finish the runway. Naturally after such strenuous exercise there was a small party in the mess, but nothing serious other than a bit of beer throwing and broken glass”.\n\nFrom the ORB on 5 March, “There was an odd accident today. A/C ‘L’ was being towed to the hangar and due to the slippery conditions of the road, the tractor skidded and swung about face and rode under the tail plane. The driver, LAC CN White (right), R72991 showed presence of mind in staying with the tractor and keeping it in a straight line. The top of the tractor was damaged and the a/c suffered slight damage to the tail plane. The driver was unhurt.” LAC White, from Charlottetown was Mentioned in Despatches for his efforts.\n\nLAC CN White (PL 28090)\n\nDuring a patrol on 6 March, an American USAAF pilot with 404, Lt Guyott struck two seagulls. “The pilot was unaware that he had struck anything until after landing, when it was discovered that one of the birds had penetrated well inside the port wing, while the other bird struck the leading edge. There was slight damage to the wing. The servicing personnel suggest that all pilots that collide with any Sumburgh convoys be detailed to remove the deceased birds from the A/C as the odour is terrific.”\n\nSeveral Americans flew with 404 during the war, some as members of the RAF and RCAF, and some (after Dec 7 1941) with the USAAF. At left is Lt Freddie Guyott in his American flight kit. He originally trained with the RCAF. (PL 28074)\n\nFurther development of RP tactics is noted with a quick entry in the records on the 7th that aircraft “had RP splash practice.” On the same day, S/L Gatward conducted a night flying test using the RPs. “This had the civilian population thinking that there was a raid on, as the test made quite a boom.”\n\nLittle comments noted in the ORB, such as one on the 15th, must have driven the servicing personnel nutty. Many times throughout 404’s history, comments that servicing was excellent are evident, so it must have been the importance of an upcoming mission that prompted the entry, “All A/C are to be kept serviceable for immediate work…”\n\nWO Red McGrath, GM, on leave after being awarded the George Medal (PL 26994)\n\nOn the same day, it is noted that W/O WL McGrath was to be awarded the George Medal for his actions in saving the life of his pilot, Johnny Cummins after the horrific crash of 16 December 1943. A serious accident was narrowly avoided on 15 March “Had a very close call today as the boys had two cannons lying out in front of ‘N’ (144) on a couple of boxes and one went off as an RAF armourer picked it up by the breech end just as I passed the muzzles. Pretty hard on the ears and also could have had both legs blown off just above the ankles. ” For three days, commencing on 16 March, 404 and 144 Squadrons (and later other units) participated in a major ALT (Aerial Light Torpedo) exercise with 404 acting as the anti-flak portion of the formation. This is a very interesting annotation, as it demonstrates that 404 in fact flew an RP profile during such sorties, and did not, in fact, actually drop the torpedoes themselves. There seems to be some confusion in published facts about 404 that the squadron did drop torpedoes operationally. The editor has not been able to find any conclusive evidence that this was the case. In April 2005 a letter was received from Mr Bert Ramsden, a pilot who flew with 404, states that he has no memory of the squadron ever dropping the weapon. All of the ALT training conducted over the two days had the crews buzzing about the possibility of the units participating in a major naval strike in the near future. On 18 March, the largest formation of the exercise took off with 72 aircraft participating, involving “the numerous squadrons that are now on the Station.”\n\nOn 23 March, five 404 Beaufighters in company with four torpedo and two cannon Beaufighters from 144 Squadron conducted a Rover Patrol from Svinoy light to Ytterone light. The formation made landfall at Svinoy light and turned south and found an enemy convoy of two merchant vessels and three escort ships off Krakanes light (Vaagso). Gatward (with navigator F/O J Carlin) in ‘A’, leading the formation, went in with F/L VT Robinson (navigator F/O WD Devine) in ‘J’ to conduct the anti-flak attack on the first M/V with both pilots scoring hits with RP, also using their cannons to good effect. Gatward also made cannon attacks on the leading escort vessel. F/O P Dwornick with F/S RS Porter concentrated on the leading escort ship and saw his shells explode on the target but did not claim any RP strikes. WO AB French and F/S E Hathaway shot the escort vessel astern with cannon fire and did not claim any RP hits. F/S JW Heavner and W/O EE Baker, who had been attacking another M/V in the vicinity that was stationary in a bay north of Vaagso, then joined the fray and raked two of the flak ships with cannon bursts. The aircrew felt that the convoy was left with its larger vessel of 3,000 tons seriously damaged and all three escorts battered. One of the 144 Squadron aircraft failed to return. A Norwegian researcher states that on 23 March, four vessels were damaged near Stadtlandet. The two merchant vessels were the 1,584-ton Norwegian Kaupanger and the 985-ton Norwegian Gol. The escort vessel was the 289-ton German V-5104 Wirbel and a coastal express (ferry), the 898-ton Norwegian Ryfylke was damaged near Jaeren, possibly this was the vessel attacked by Heavner. The Ryfylke was beached after the attack but was raised and returned to service.\n\nF/O WD Armour (PL) was killed in a flying accident while conducting RP training.\n\nF/O WD Armour (left) and Sgt E Stephens were lost on this day in Beaufighter LZ177. Armour was buried in Wick while the family of Sgt Stephens elected to have a private service. “Just as our boys were coming in one of our kites which was practicing with RPs went into a dive to shoot them off and he didn’t level out properly and crashed into the water. On impact the kite disintegrated and the boys were killed. ” The ORB notes, “on practice RP splash target in Sinclair Bay was seen to make attack at a very steep dive. After releasing RP the A/C pulled up into a high speed stall and flipped over on its back then crashed into the water. The A/C broke up and the bodies have been recovered.”\n\nF/L GV Stevens, 404 Adjutant (PL 28091).\n\nF/L Stevens was Adjutant of the Squadron from Mar 43 to Oct 44, but suffered a lengthy illness during his tenure. An interesting story in the ORB involves the Squadron’s Adjutant, F/L Stevens (below left; PL 28091); “The Squadron discip(linarian) decided to clean the Adjutant’s set of sheep horns but some aspiring artists got ahold of them and did a real job of rainbow painting. After this desecration there was much activity and use of paint remover before they were restored to the Adjutant’s office in a much better condition. There are numerous stories as to how he came into possession of the horns, one of them being that he was in the cockpit of an aircraft and pressed the buttons that fired the cannons. The next thing F/L Stevens knew was that there was an irate farmer demanding payment for one sheep.”\n\nMonte Rosa (Monterosa) Troop Ship\n\nAnother attack on shipping, this time against fierce opposition, owed its success to the resolute and skillful leadership of the Squadron Commanding Officer, Chuck Willis. On 30 March, nine 404 Beaufighters armed with RPs in the anti-flak role were out in formation with four Torbeaus and five Flakbeaus of 144 Squadron in search of 13,882-ton troop ship, the Monte Rosa. A destroyer, two other escort vessels and numerous aircraft escorted this large vessel. The troop ship’s movement had been reported by ‘special intelligence’ and was observed off of Haugesund by a 333 (Norwegian) Squadron Mosquito. A day earlier, the Squadron had been involved in an unsuccessful search for this convoy containing “a very large vessel”.\n\nThe formation flew in two parts, the first under the leadership of W/C Willis and navigator F/L FA Kent in ‘A’ LZ297, the second was led by F/L V Robinson and F/O WD Devine in ‘P’ LZ314.\n\nThe formation made landfall Utsire Light and almost immediately sighted the target. Seeing the strength of the enemy’s air protection and realizing that an intense barrage of flak would also be encountered, Willis gave exact instructions to each of the aircraft as to the form of attack that was to be employed. As the Beaufighters approached the target at low altitude, the enemy air escort of approximately nine Me.109s and FW.190s, five Me.110s, two Arados and a BV.138 turned towards the shore “and waited for the formation to attack”. Following the Wing Commanders instructions, the attacking force gained altitude and then, in the face of terrific flak which opened up from all the ships as well as from the shore batteries, dived on the convoy. P/O Mallalieu and W/O J Perry in ‘C’, F/O JE Young and F/S L Webster in ‘Y’ and F/O AR Fair and F/S R Towns in ‘G’ attacked the Monte Rosa with RP and cannon. ‘Y’ and ‘G’ claimed probable underwater hits while defensive flying by ‘C’ caused the RPs to miss. Mallalieu and Perry were new to the Squadron and were on their first strike, yet showed the coolness and determination normally only seen with experienced and confident crews. After their attack, the crew chased off a Me.110 that was attacking Smith and Kessler in ‘L’.\n\nF/O EJ Keefe and W/O BG Steed in ‘E’, along with F/O NF Smith and F/S SA Kessler in ‘L’ and F/O JH Symons and F/O LJ Barcham in ‘M’ concentrated their RP and cannon fire on the destroyer which was immediately astern of the troop ship. The destroyer took evasive action but all attacking aircraft claimed numerous hits with both weapons. Keefe’s aircraft was seriously damaged in the attack by flak, sustaining hits in the tail plane and starboard mainplane with the fuselage being sprayed by machine gun bullets. In the face of this damage, Keefe and Steed pressed the attack and over flew the destroyer before successfully returning to base.\n\nThe enemy aircraft now returned to the scene of combat at low altitude then climbed up behind the attacking Beaufighters and engaged.\n\nAfter making RP and cannon strikes on the rearmost enemy escort vessel, F/O JLF Rancourt and F/S C Evans in ‘K’ went for three Me.110s, one of which he shot down in flames. “F/O Rancourt also had the success and good management to shoot down an Me.110. This is a twin-engined fighter and he blew it to pieces with only about 15 rounds from each cannon. He made such a direct hit on it that it exploded in mid-air when the high explosive and incendiaries hit it. ” He then turned on another 110 but was driven off by an FW.190. P/O Mallalieu also had an inconclusive combat with a Me.110. The determined and effective work of the Beaufighters enabled the torpedo aircraft to get in their attacks on the main target. The large ship was left smoking and the destroyer was enveloped in clouds of steam.\n\n“A large percentage of the success of the strike must go to the Navigators in all aircraft for assisting their pilots in evasive action.”\n\n144 Torbeaus claimed two torpedo strikes for their efforts in the attack. Against these results, however, the squadron lost two crews; their popular and very able Commanding Officer, Chuck Willis with his navigator, F/L FA Kent in ‘A’, along with F/L VT Robinson and his navigator F/O WDM Devine in ‘P’. Willis was later reported to be a prisoner of war, after being plucked from the sea by a Blohm and Voss flying boat (BV.138). A/C ‘K’ (Rancourt and Evans) reported that they heard ‘P’ call out a distress signal and that he was ditching. A dinghy was observed with two men swimming toward it, it is unknown if this was the Willis or Robinson crew. Smith and Kessler reported seeing a twin-engined aircraft crash into the sea, “It is hoped that this was Rancourt’s ME 110 and not A/C ‘A'”.\n\nNavigator F/O WD Devine (left) and his pilot F/L VT Robinson were killed during a daring attack on a heavily defended troopship Monterosa (PL 28069 and 28071)\n\nUpon return from the sortie, some very tricky landings were made by the shot up aircraft. F/O Keefe was able to land his aircraft without flaps or brake, and P/O Mallalieu landed with a flat tire. Gowler noted that Keefe’s aircraft was “badly shot up, in fact, will be written off because it looks more like a sieve than an aeroplane. “\n\nThe ORB is candid with some of the tales told by aircrew and should be included. “F/O Rancourt, who hales from Beauce County, was heard to say ‘That Jerry, he put holes in my perspex. I don’t like those things so I shoot him down’. F/O Norm Smith said, ‘I went in close, let go my load then closed my eyes and beat it like hell for home’. The ardour of the party that followed was dampened by our losses.”\n\nThe Monte Rosa, damaged near Utsire, limped into Aarhus, Denmark on 3 April. “Of the 7 kites that got back only two were intact.\n\nAs a result of the loss of W/C Willis, S/L Gatward, DFC, took the helm of the Buffalo squadron.\n\nW/C Ken Gatward, DSO, DFC, the squadron’s sixth Commanding Officer. In this Buffalo photo, he was just completing his third tour of operations.

Eight 404 Beaufighters, acting as anti-flak escort to 144 Squadron torpedo and cannon Beaus, struck at a convoy of three large M/Vs protected by seven escort vessels near Stadtlandet. Led by Keefe in NE355, the aircraft concentrated their fire on three of the enemy vessels and left all three smoking. This enabled Torbeaus to close in on the main target and make a torpedo hit on the largest ship, which was likely the 3,290-ton German merchant vessel Cornouaille, which actually was listed as having been damaged by shelling. As well, two escort vessels are listed as having been damaged by shelling; 248-ton German Auxiliary Whaler NK-06 Jager, and 487-ton German Auxiliary Trawler/Sub Chaser UJ-1709 Westpreussen.\n\nMuch of the flying for the rest of the month concentrated on training to release airburst bombs, with only two Rover Patrols thrown in. The Beaufighter was not fitted with bombsights and it was frustrating to the crews, who felt they were making significant strides against the enemy, to not participate in operations. Several comments are made in the scrapbook that this operational squadron was starting to feel like an OTU (Operational Training Unit).\n\nTowards the end of April, rumours began to circulate about an upcoming move. Although nobody would say for sure where the Buffaloes were going next, the general feeling was that it would be somewhere to the south. About this time as well, aircrew and ground crew alike were trying to keep away from the squadron’s Medical Officer who was spending his time making sure that the unit was up-to-date with the necessary inoculations. The event was recorded as follows in the Squadron scrapbook; Doc Beacock is in his element these days. Going around with a needle in his hand and a malicious gleam in his eye (the good one) asking ‘have you been vaccinated? Inoculated?’ There’s no evading the man ¬ he’s MAD.\n\nMay 1944\n\nEarly in May, 404 had another run in with the Germans. On the moonlit night of 5 May, Gatward with F/O J Carlin and F/L AA Adams with F/O FE Pickering were on patrol.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Aubrey Abran Adams\n\nFlying Officer Frank Edward Pickering\n\nAfter arriving at the enemy-held coast, Adams became separated from the leader and was posted as missing, failed to return after the mission. Gatward continued his patrol and when over Egero Harbour sighted a stationary motor vessel of 2,500-tons, which he attacked with RP. A fire immediately broke out on the vessel, indicating that some of the RPs had found their mark .\n\nThis was to be the last attack from a base in Scotland by 404 for the next little while. The rumours about an impending move suddenly came true and the long trek south began on 10 May. It was an understatement to say the members of 404, after so many months of the rigorous climate and comparative isolation of the far north of Scotland, looked forward to a move to the Cornish Riviera in the south-west of England. Thus, it was with high spirits that the air party arrived at their new home ¬ RAF Davidstow Moor, under the control of No 19 Group. While flying from their new station, the Squadron was to give up on the familiar unit code ‘EE’ on the side of their Beaufighters, for the numeral ‘2’.\n\nUnfortunately, the Buffaloes were somewhat disappointed in their new digs, about the most grim looking effort we have seen yet .\n\nNissen huts, ablutions outside, and lavatories as well…Some bright person called the site ‘Stalag 404’…at tea, at the mess we saw our first greens (beer) for a long time ¬ but when the bar opened at 1800 hours and closed at 1820 hours because it had run out ¬ brother!\n\nThe Red Cross reported on 18 May; W/C ‘Chuck’ Willis, it is now known, is a prisoner of war ¬ Boy, that sure is swell news ¬ No news of ‘Snappy’ Kent. Jobs I would not like ¬ Being Interrogation Officer at good old Stalag Luft III trying to get something out of Chuck ¬ the aspirins, quick! The Red Cross also reported that W/C Willis was able to swim to shore after being shot down.\n\nOn 19 May, the squadron carried out its first operation from the new base against enemy naval vessels reported to be off Ushant. The attacking force, led by Gatward, had nine 404 Beaufighters with 144 Squadron cannon-equipped aircraft to act as anti-flak escort. It was a new experience for the Buffaloes to be protected against enemy fighters ¬ on this occasion by a strong formation of 28 Spitfires. When the enemy force consisting of one Elbing class destroyer, one torpedo boat and three minesweepers were sighted, the flak suppression aircraft went in first, raking all the ships and setting one of the minesweepers on fire. The Buffaloes followed, concentrating their attention on the destroyer, which received at least six direct hits from rockets. One crew also scored hits on a minesweeper. Intense flak from the target forced the attacking crews to take violent evasive action. Although final results of the attack could not be observed fully, the destroyer was claimed as damaged and one minesweeper as seriously damaged.\n\nJune 1944\n\nEarly in the month, W/C Gatward, who had led 11 strikes, received the DSO while Carlin, his navigator, earned the DFC.\n\nThis is likely one of the most famous photos of a Canadian Beaufighter taken during the War. It is likely the Commanding Officer’s (W/C Gatward) aircraft and was taken well after D-Day, even though the invasion stripes still adorn the plane. The aircraft in the background has the ‘EE’ unit code, while during D-Day, the unit wore a ‘2’ signifying Davidstow Moor. Note the 25-lb AP rockets hanging under the wing. Interestingly, the original write-up stated “terror of Nazi tanks, trains and transports” though 404 never flew against ground targets. (PL 41049)\n\nIn preparation for the coming Operation Overlord, a directive was put forth to the Squadrons as to what ordnance was to be used for future attacks. Northwood originally decreed that the Squadron was to use 60-lb RP as their main offensive weapon, but after being reminded of the success of the 25-lb AP (armour piercing) heads they reneged and allowed 404 and one other Beaufighter Strike Squadron to use the devastating AP projectile. “The remaining Beaufighter strike squadrons were to carry two 250-lb wing bombs and two 500-lb bombs under the fuselage. “\n\nSpecial intelligence sources prior to the invasion placed the number of miscellaneous vessels available to the Germans along the French and Belgian coasts at 460. Of these, the most important were “five ‘Z’ class destroyers, five ‘Mowe’ class and one ‘T’ class torpedo boats, and 34 E-boats “. It was obvious to the planners of Operation Overlord that the destroyers were to be the largest threat to the Allied surface vessels, and accordingly, 404 and 144 Squadrons commenced their training concentrating on tactics against these very dangerous targets and operations at night.\n\nOn 4 June, “Today our aircraft received new camouflage – Black and white stripes. It doesn’t look long for ‘D’ Day.”\n\nD-Day (Z-32, Z-24, and ZH-1) “Second front opened up this morning. We knew through yesterday and the day before that it was a matter of only a few hours. ” 6 June 1944, D-Day, started with all of the Beaufighter crews being on standby for immediate action. A report had been received that three Narvik class destroyers had been sighted steaming up the channel apparently on their way to interfere with the Allied landings in Normandy. The word to launch finally arrived and, by 1820 hours, fourteen 25-pound SAP RP-carrying aircraft from 404 were in the air. 16 Beaus accompanied them from 144 Squadron acting as anti-flak and by eight Mosquitoes from 248 Squadron as fighter escort. F/O S Shulemson, DSO, led the 404 formation. They made landfall at Ushant Island and started to fly southeast from there. Enroute, three targets were sighted and the Strike lead, W/C Lumsden of 144 Squadron prepared the attack, only to be warned off by Shulemson who recognized the vessels as M-class minesweepers. A Ju-188 was also spotted, which was taken care of by a 248 Mosquito, and the same squadron also attacked a surfaced U-Boat spotted enroute. The three destroyers were finally sighted in the vicinity of Belle Isle off St. Nazaire. The strike leader mistakenly recalled the order to attack, but F/O Shulemson recognized the target and shouted ‘It is the target, attack, attack!’\n\nThe strike leader then ordered all of the aircraft to engage the enemy ships. F/O Shulemson deployed his sub-leaders, F/O Hodson on the port side and F/O Dwornick on the starboard side to take the end and front ships respectively. Four 404 Beaufighters attacked the leading destroyer and many underwater hits were claimed. The superstructure was damaged by cannon fire from all aircraft and the ship was left smoking. Nine aircraft from 404 went after the center destroyer with many of the crew holding their fire until they were within point-blank range. Much damage was done to this vessel, which was reported as being on fire. The attacking force then proceeded back to base, their only casualty during the attack being an aircraft from 144 Squadron that was forced to ditch. Fortunately, the crew was picked up safely.\n\nNo sooner had the 404 aircraft arrived back home than they refueled for another strike on the same target. Five 404 Beaus, some being crews who were quite new on the squadron, took part in this second sortie. The targets were again sighted in the early morning hours of 7 June off Penmarch Point south of Brest. The second destroyer was still smoking. For the novice crews, according to the War Diary, “their performance was the work of hardened veterans.” All of the aircraft closed to within 400 yards before releasing their rockets and many hits were claimed. Lt FF Guyott and F/O ST Faithful reported an explosion from one of the destroyers. They claimed that there was a red glow, which finally erupted, sending flames as high as 200 feet. Although the squadron aircrews were rightly happy with their attacks against an incredibly deadly foe, the destroyers escaped critical injury. Post war records show that the action did cause serious damage, and that the Z-32 had just escaped destruction. Z-32 was holed several times above the water line, several offices destroyed, and one RP passed through a forward magazine without exploding! Z-24 had oil bunkers holed and several large fires were started. ZH-1 had avoided attack, it seems, by ‘sailing close in to starboard of Z.24 ‘\n\nAll of the 404 aircraft that took part in the strikes returned safely with only a shattered cupola to repair. F/O RC Ridge and F/S P McCartney were pulling away from their attack when a bullet shattered the navigator’s cupola. McCartney did not know that anything had happened until he felt a slight draft. He sustained a slight cut on the forehead. This was truly one of the proudest days in 404’s history, made possible by the determined efforts of both aircrew and ground crew. “What a day – Poor ground crew. Unsung heroes.”\n\nIn spite of the damage inflicted, the three destroyers managed to reach Brest where, after a stay of two days for repairs and alterations (including more powerful anti-aircraft guns), they set out again during the night, this time accompanied by T.24. They did not get far, however, for they were sighted by a patrolling aircraft as they rounded the Brest peninsula and engaged by the 10th Destroyer Flotilla (which included HMCS Haida and Huron) which sank one ship outright, drove another onto the rocks of Ile de Batz and forced the third back to Br"
