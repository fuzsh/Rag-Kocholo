OnTheMarket.com makes no warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the advertisement or any linked or associated information, and OnTheMarket.com has no control over the content provided by the agent or developer. This property advertisement does not constitute property particulars. The information is provided and maintained by Paveys Estate Agents - Essex.\n\nOnTheMarket may have applied supplementary data to this property listing, including:\n\nBroadband availability and predicted speed: obtained from Ofcom on November 9, 2022\n\nBroadband speed is measured in megabits per second, with the number returned showing how fast the connection is. Each reading is based on the highest predicted speed of any major broadband network for services that deliver the download speeds. The following are the different readings that we may display:\n\nBasic: Up to 30 Mbit/s\n\nSuper-fast: Between 30 Mbit/s and 300 Mbit/s\n\nUltra-fast: Over 300 Mbit/s\n\nThe data is updated three times a year. The checker results are predictions and should not be regarded as guaranteed. For more information, see: https://checker.ofcom.org.uk/en-gb/about-checker#Answer_0_2\n\nMobile phone signal availability and predicted strength: obtained from Ofcom on November 9, 2022\n\nMobile signal predictions are provided by the four UK mobile network operators: EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. Predictions can vary significantly from the coverage you may actually experience as a result of local factors (especially terrain). Ofcom has tested the actual coverage provided in various locations around the UK to help ensure that these predictions are reasonable. The values shown against a property can be broken down as follows:\n\nClear: No bars, no signal predicted\n\nRed: One bar, reliable signal unlikely\n\nAmber: Two bars, may experience problems with connectivity\n\nGreen: Three bars, likely to have good coverage and receive a data rate to support basic web services\n\nEnhanced: Full bars, likely to have good coverage indoors and to receive an enhanced data rate to support multimedia services\n\nEnergy Performance data and Internal floor area: obtained on June 17, 2016 from The Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 or the Home Report if in relation to a residential property in Scotland.\n\nAny supplementary data should not be relied upon as forming part of any property particulars and OnTheMarket cannot be held responsible for any incorrectness in this data. See here for more information.\n\n*Call rate information\n\nCalls to 0843 numbers will be charged at 4p/min from BT landlines. Calls from other networks may vary, and calls from mobiles and outside the UK will be higher. Calls to local numbers beginning with 01, 02 and 03 numbers will incur standard geographic charges from landlines and mobiles."
