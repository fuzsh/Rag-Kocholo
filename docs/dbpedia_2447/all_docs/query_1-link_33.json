        "text": "Background\n\nThe concept of racism corresponds to a set of attitudes, behaviours and practices that maintain an imbalance in the distribution of power across ethnic-racial groups [1]. Racism is the oppression of specific ethnic-racial groups in association with maintaining the privileges of others, fostering and perpetuating social disparities [2]. At an institutional level, racism can be observed through historical and structural inequalities in socioeconomic indicators, and educational and health parameters. In its interpersonal facet, racism permeates daily interactions, with negative discriminatory behaviour targeted at ethnic-racial minority members. Racism can be internalised by the assimilation of negative messages that influence self-concept formation and well-being [1–3]. Interpersonal racism is the focus of the present study, as such experiences are reported by members of different ethnic-racial minority groups at different ages across the life-span, with documented impacts on health and wellbeing [4, 5]. Accordingly, racism will be the term used throughout this paper in reference to racially-based discriminatory encounters experienced at an interpersonal level. The impact racism has on ethnic-racial minorities’ health and wellbeing makes it a public health issue and a central component of the political agenda worldwide [4].\n\nThe World Health Organisation framework to strengthen health equities globally and within countries is based on the social determinants of health [6]. This framework highlights how social stratification influences early life and the social and physical environments in which individuals develop and interact [6, 7]. Among these structural factors, biases and values within society, social position, ethnicity and race, and psychosocial factors are central determinants of the distribution of health and wellbeing in the population [6]. This framework has been suggested as relevant to the understanding of health and wellbeing inequalities in the Aboriginal Australian context [8]. Aboriginal people report being exposed to racism during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, in a range of different settings where they perform their daily activities [9–11]. Accordingly, Aboriginal health and wellbeing cannot be promoted without considering the impact of the social and structural conditions that shape their life trajectories [8]. Due to its link to a history of disposession, marginalisation, disempowerment, and inequalities, racism is a central determinant of the health and socio-emotional wellbeing of Aboriginal Australians from an early age [8, 12].\n\nThe effects of racism among ethnic-racial minorities can be observed from childhood and early adolescence [11]. A systematic review of 121 studies offers a panoramic perspective of the main findings in the field. It indicates that the most consistent effects of racism among children and adolescents are for negative mental health outcomes [13]. Associations between racism and lower self-esteem and higher anxiety, stress, depression, suicide ideation and attempts, aggression, Attention Deficit and Hyperactive Disorder, and behavioural problems have been reported [13]. Similar associations were reported in a systematic review that analysed 47 papers on the health and wellbeing of Indigenous youth (4–20 years) from high income countries (U.S., Canada, and Australia) [14]. More specifically, research with Aboriginal Australian adolescents and young adults indicates associations of racism and poor overall mental health and higher anxiety, depression, and suicide risk [15, 16]. A study focused on 5–10-year olds showed an increased risk for overall emotional and behavioural difficulties amongst Aboriginal children exposed to interpersonal racism [17].\n\nResearch in the Aboriginal Australian context is still limited, generally reporting cross-sectional data and including relatively large age-range groups [15].The present study intends to provide further insight on the impact of racism on the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) of Aboriginal Australian children. Following on from the previous work of Shepherd et al. [17], we used longitudinal data to estimate the effect of racism on specific domains of SEWB including emotional difficulties, hyperactivity, peer and conduct problems, as well as a total score for psychological difficulties. We hypothesised that experiencing racism would be associated with higher risk for clinically significant symptomatology in all domains considered one-to-two years after exposure. Estimating the effects of racism on different mental health domains can contribute to the understanding of symptoms that might be more closely associated with experiences of racism in Aboriginal children, assisting in identifying periods for optimal intervention and in designing appropriate support.\n\nThe analyses were designed to maximize the longitudinal potential of the data. Temporal ordering of exposure and outcome is required to account for the possibility of reverse causation, thus contributing to the investigation of causal associations and the long-term effects of exposure to racism amongst racial minorities [13, 17]. Age-related differences in the onset of symptoms were also investigated. Differences in the onset of symptoms might be relevant for mental health clinicians, health practitioners, and professionals in educational settings who interact with Aboriginal children and might have opportunities to identify symptomatology and recommend early intervention.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe findings support our hypothesis that experiencing racism in childhood is associated with higher risks of clinically significant symptomatology in all SDQ domains. The risk ratios discussed are the effects with highest compatibility with the models tested. Nonetheless, careful interpretation is required as the null values were also compatible, although less likely. The effects observed might reflect an initial understanding of a psychosocial stressor such as racism and the implied oppression based on ethnic-racial membership. Children in both waves are still in the process of assigning meaning to the racially determined distribution of power in society, as they mature biologically, cognitively, and socially [39]. There is evidence that from early childhood individuals possess cognitive representations of social dominance, expecting that socially dominant individuals will be more competent and have more resources [40, 41]. It is possible that, although some children might be less prone to identifying racism prior to adolescence, there might be an increased risk for the mental health and well-being of those who do [17]. Our results suggest that these effects might persist over time, with the temporal association applied in the analysis indicating that racism may impact children one to two years after initial exposure.\n\nPrevious findings using LSIC data demonstrated an associated odds ratio of 2.32 (95% CI 1.52, 3.53) in the total SDQ emotional and behavioural difficulties score for children assessed for racism experiences at ages 5 to 10 [17]. Our results align with these findings. Although the direction of the effect is the same, comparisons regarding its size are limited by the different effect measures presented (risk ratios and odds ratios). We calculated risk ratios rather than odds ratios because the odds ratios are overestimated when the outcome has a close or higher prevalence than 20%, as it is in this case [42]. In that sense, our effect measures are more conservative. Shepherd et al. [17] combined exposure to racism data from four waves of LSIC (between waves 1–6), which ‘averaged’ the effect and potentially obscured age-related effects that we observed in the study reported here. The study follows a research approach focused on the cumulative effects of primary and vicarious racism. No analysis on specific domains of child SEWB –or age-related differences - were reported, not permitting further comparisons [17].\n\nAs children age, affective and cognitive maturation might influence how racism is perceived and how its impact manifests [39]. Our results provide an insight into its effects on specific SEWB domains in different age-groups. The children in the older cohort were at increased risk of presenting hyperactive behaviour. A less precise effect was also observed for increased risk of conduct problems. This might indicate that professionals aiming to reduce externalizing symptoms, especially hyperactive behaviour, among Aboriginal children in later years of childhood need to consider the role of racism in the onset of symptoms. Prevalence data from Australian schools suggests that bullying and discrimination tends to increase during middle primary school up until the transition to secondary school [43], which includes the age-range of children in our sample. Strategies to identify and respond to racist episodes might help to reduce such effects and need to be the focus of future research and intervention [44].\n\nThe younger children in our study were shown to be at higher risk for total emotional and behavioural difficulties. This suggests the effects of racism were not especially pronounced in a given domain but were observed through different emotional and behavioural difficulties for that age group. Both cohorts showed an increased risk, again less precise, for the onset of emotional difficulties. Such effects demonstrate how children in both age-groups might present anxiety, emotional withdrawal, somatic complaints and other internalising symptoms due to racism. Comorbidity between the two symptoms’ typology is reported in the literature and explains the effects observed in different domains, as children who are presenting behavioural difficulties are likely to also be experiencing internalising problems [45].\n\nBoth cohorts exhibited increased risk for the onset of peer problems, although the poor internal consistency of the SDQ Peer problems scale among Aboriginal Australians [26] indicates its results should be interpreted with care. It is argued that its items might not reflect the importance culturally given to different interpersonal relationships (e..g, relationship with elders and the broader community; importance of kinship) for the wellbeing of a child. Thus, in the Aboriginal Australian context, problems with peers might not be conceptualized as a threat to child SEWB, provided the child has positive relationships with family and community members [25, 26]. Removing the peer relationship subscale, however, did not improve the fit of the original SDQ model, showing it is still appropriate for Aboriginal Australian children [26]. It should be noted that poor internal consistency of the peer problems scale was also observed in other populations [46, 47]. Future qualitative studies are needed to inform the direction of further modifications for using the Peer Problem scale among Aboriginal children [26].\n\nIt is important to observe that our sample was assessed for the risk of presenting future clinically significant symptomatology, requiring care for comparisons with clinical diagnoses. Nonetheless, the effects presented here are relevant to primary care practitioners, mental health care providers, and school professionals who work with Aboriginal children. They suggest that Aboriginal children might show emotional and behavioural difficulties as the outcome of experiencing racism. Older children might be especially prone to presenting hyperactive behaviour (e.g., lack of attention, agitated behaviour) and conduct problems (e.g., defiant behaviour, and small infractions).\n\nAboriginal Australian conceptions of resilience in children include the centrality of culture, connection to country, kinship, and community [48, 49]. Accordingly, promotion of a strong ethnic-racial identity has been shown to be an important component in promoting social and emotional wellbeing among Indigenous youth of Australia, U.S., and Canada [50–52]. Future research and interventions that take into consideration the Aboriginal Australian concepts of wellbeing and resilience might assist in fostering connection to culture and sense of pride about one’s ethnic-racial identity [48]. Research on the effectiveness of ethnic-racial identity in reducing the effects of racism from an early age can inform future policy and intervention [53].\n\nOur results were obtained from a large sample of children of a stigmatised racial minority group in Australia. The children participating in the LSIC are diverse culturally and geographically, with more than 80 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander tribal groups (e.g., Wiradjuri, Yorta Yorta, Arrernt, Gamilaroi) being represented [54]. It can thus be argued that LSIC data is one of the best information sources on determinants of the health and development of Aboriginal Australian children, considering the unprecedented number of participating children, the annual follow up, and the sampling covering a range of localities where Aboriginal children live [18, 55].\n\nCompared with the few longitudinal studies on this topic [5, 17], the longitudinal design of LSIC ensured temporal order of the exposure before the outcome. As for other strengths of the study, the SDQ is a valid and reliable instrument for using with different cultural groups, also being the most common tool used in studies involving Aboriginal children [25]. The analysis of effects per domain of SEWB also contributed to understanding which aspects of development might be most sensitive to racism amongst different age groups. For the method’s rigor in estimating the effects of interest, adjustment for confounding was adopted for bias reduction and MICE was performed to reduce non-response bias.\n\nWe also highlight that our models were not adjusted for SDQ scores at baseline. First, information at baseline was only available for the K-cohort. Second, our research question was not related to the effects of racism on changes in SDQ scores between waves. Considering the complex dynamics of racism, we cannot be sure that a child’s exposure started at baseline as to justify adjusting for SDQ score at this point in time. We believe that our measure of racism is an approximation of children’s experiences and might reflect an ongoing process. Finally, adjustment for baseline outcomes might reduce certain bias but can introduce others. In a paper published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, Glymor and collaborators [56] argue that the bias introduced can surpass the bias eliminated. It not only fails to remove confounding but also can induces spurious correlations between exposure and measured change. When adjustment for baseline functions is measured prior to exposure, as would be the case for one of our cohorts, such adjustment could introduce regression-to-the-mean bias if baseline values are measured with error [56].\n\nDespite adjusting for several cofounders, residual and unmeasured confounding may remain. Another limitation is the two-year difference between assessment for exposure and outcomes for children in wave 6 (K-cohort), while it was one year for children in wave 7 (B-cohort). Children in the K-cohort, due to their already higher age and the larger time interval between assessments, had more opportunity to be exposed to new episodes of racism that were not captured. Consequently, there may be more children in the K-cohort who experienced a negative impact on SEWB due to racism but who were counted as unexposed, underestimating the effect sizes presented. It could also be the case that the children were continuously exposed to racism in the intervals between assessments, reflecting a cumulative effect when SDQ scores were captured. It is important to note that the exposure variable was racism in the school environment and not in other settings and, as such, this potentially underestimates children’s exposure to racism. It is possible that only the more severe episodes of racism will be reported by children to their parents, which again, would contribute to underestimating racism exposure. Although caregivers believe their children would tell them about bullying/victimization at school, children who suffer discrimination refer not telling their caregivers about such experiences [57]. Therefore, future research should seek to understand experiences of racism from the child’s perspective and across all contexts [13].\n\nAll the point estimates of the risk ratios indicated that racism was associated with increased risks of poorer SEWB. However, the CIs were wide and ‘non-significant’. We deliberately avoid interpreting ‘statistical significance’ and focus on effect sizes, as recommended by the leading professional organisations in statistics and the health sciences [37, 38, 58, 59]. Larger sample sizes might address the wide CIs [59]. However, this is the largest cohort available in Australia, and one of few in the world [60, 61], with data available to study effects of racism in childhood. Therefore, it is unlikely that larger samples are available. We felt it was inappropriate to combine data from the B and K cohorts due to differences in the ages when racism and SEWB were measured, and differences in the intervening period (the two cohorts had different opportunities to be exposed). Furthermore, the separation of the two cohorts has added a unique insight that age might influence which aspects of SEWB are affected by racism, which would have been masked if the cohorts were combined. Irrespective, our data from two cohorts are presented in such a way that they could be used in future meta-analyses that aim to more precisely estimate the effect of racism on SEWB."
