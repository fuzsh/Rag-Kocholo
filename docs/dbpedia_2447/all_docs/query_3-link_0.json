        "text": "Recognitions for members of the United States Air Force Auxilary\n\nThe awards and decorations of Civil Air Patrol are \"designed to recognize heroism, service, and program achievements\" of members of Civil Air Patrol (CAP) of the United States of America.[1] The CAP is the official auxiliary of the United States Air Force. These awards are made to improve the esprit de corps of members.[1] These awards are all worn in the form of medals or ribbons and all are considered civilian decorations. Civil Air Patrol regulations allow them to only be worn and displayed on appropriate CAP uniforms.[2]\n\nIn order to be considered for one of these awards, an individual must be a Civil Air Patrol member in good standing at the time of the act being recognized. There is a statute of limitations for these awards and all recommendations must be submitted within two years of the act being performed.[1] It is possible for the next of kin of deceased persons to be presented awards to which a member was entitled, but which he or she did not receive.[1] Award review boards are established at the region, wing, group, and squadron levels to consider recommendations for all awards and decorations.[1]\n\nDecorations\n\n[edit]\n\nAny Civil Air Patrol member may initiate a recommendation for the award of a decoration. Members initiating a recommendation must have knowledge of an act or service that merits recognition. Awards concerning commanders must be initiated at a higher command level or by the appointing authority for National Executive Committee (NEC) members. The authority to award decorations is vested in the NEC. The leader of the promotion and awards team of the NEC is authorized to approve all decorations in the name of the Committee. The Silver Medal of Valor, the Bronze Medal of Valor, and the Distinguished Service Medal are exceptions to this and must be approved by the full committee. Announcements of awarded decorations are made in personnel actions published by the CAP National Headquarters.\n\nRibbons\n\n[edit]\n\nAir and Space Organizational Excellence Award\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, the US Air Force presented the then-Air Force Organizational Excellence Award to all members of Civil Air Patrol in good standing who served a minimum of one day from October 1, 2012, to August 31, 2016. The Air Force presented the AFOEA for CAP's successful performance in the execution of its missions. Given the unique nature of CAP as an all-volunteer civilian organization, special instructions were given for wear of the award.[3]\n\nSilver Medal of Valor\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Silver Medal of Valor is the highest decoration a Civil Air Patrol member can receive.[4] It is awarded for \"distinguished and conspicuous heroic action, at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of normal duty.\"\n\nIf the situation does not put a member's life in immediate danger, they may qualify for the Bronze Medal of Valor (see below). The same ribbon is used for both the Silver and Bronze Medals of Valor; with the exception that the Silver Medal of Valor ribbon has three silver star attachments. The basic ribbon (without attachments) represents the Bronze Medal of Valor.\n\nBronze Medal of Valor\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bronze Medal of Valor is awarded to members for \"distinguished and conspicuous heroic action where danger to self is probable and known.\"[4] The Chairman of the National Awards Review Board is authorized to approve this medal for the National Executive Committee. If there arises a case in which a member is credited with saving a human life, but where the act does not meet the criteria for either the Silver Medal of Valor or the Bronze Medal of Valor, the member is generally recommended for a Certificate of Recognition of Lifesaving.[4] The award for both of these medals of valor consists of the medal and ribbon and a certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nDistinguished Service Medal\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Distinguished Service Medal of Civil Air Patrol is awarded for \"conspicuous performance of outstanding service in a duty of great responsibility where the position held and results obtained reflect upon the accomplishments and prestige of CAP on a national scale.\"[4] The duties for which this medal are awarded must be extremely difficult and of importance to the national mission of the CAP. This is the highest award for service given by the CAP. Any member may nominate deserving cadets or officers for the award. All nominations are approved by the CAP National Headquarters. If the act of service is deemed to be important at the region level or wing level, the member is generally recommended for the Exceptional Service Award or the Meritorious Service Award.[4] This award consists of the medal itself along with a ribbon and certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nExceptional Service Award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Exceptional Service Award is presented to Civil Air Patrol members who provide \"exceptionally outstanding service to CAP...while serving in any capacity with CAP.\"[4] The award regulations do make clear that the duty should carry the responsibility for completion of a major project at the region level or wing level. Any CAP member may nominate another cadet or officer for the exceptional service award, but the duty must involve the fulfillment of a duty that greatly benefits the region or wing. All nominations must be approved by the region or wing commander.[4] This award does not come with a full-sized medal. It consists of a ribbon and a certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nMeritorious Service Award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Meritorious Service Award is awarded for \"outstanding achievement or meritorious service rendered specifically on behalf of CAP.\"[4] The regulations are quite clear that simply performing one's normal duties very well will not automatically qualify a member for this award. Instead, the award is meant for \"achievements and services which are clearly outstanding and unmistakably exceptional,\"[4] though not worthy of the Distinguished Service Medal or the Exceptional Service Award. When the award is made to individuals who are part of an exceptionally successful group of CAP members, the regulation states that the Meritorious Service Award should be presented only to those members whose efforts were clearly integral to the success of the program.\n\nAll nominations for this award must be approved by the region commander. Like the Exceptional Service Award, this award does not come with a full-sized medal. It consists of a ribbon and a certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nCommander's Commendation Award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander's Commendation Award is presented to Civil Air Patrol members for \"outstanding duty performance where achievements and services are clearly and unmistakably exceptional when compared to similar achievements and service of members of like rank and responsibility.\"[4] As in the case of the Meritorious Service Award, when an award is made to individuals who are part of an exceptionally successful group of CAP members, the regulation states that the Commander's Commendation Award should be presented only to those members whose efforts were clearly integral to the success of the program. The Commander's Commendation Award differs from the Exceptional Service Award and the Meritorious Service Award in that the former does not require the performance \"achievements and services significantly above and beyond normal duty performance.\"[4] Nominations for this award may be approved by and the award may be presented by either a wing, region, or national commander. In each case, the award is slightly different depending on the authority by whom it is approved:\n\nthe basic ribbon is awarded to members who earn the award as authorized by their wing commander\n\na bronze star is added to the ribbon when the award is authorized by the region commander\n\na silver star is added to the ribbon when the award is authorized by the National Commander[5]\n\nIf a CAP member is presented with multiple awards, a clasp is placed to the left (from the point of view of the wearer) of a silver or bronze star. Only one star of each type will be worn on this award.[4] Like the Exceptional Service Award and Meritorious Service Award, this commendation does not come with a full-sized medal. It consists of a ribbon and a certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nAchievement Award\n\n[edit]\n\nCivil Air Patrol's Achievement Award is given to a member when the circumstances of their performance are above and beyond those of the member’s peers, but are not sufficient enough to warrant a Commander's Commendation Award. The intent of the award is to empower wing and group commanders with the ability to recommend and present achievement awards locally.[citation needed] The official regulations state that the Achievement Award is \"presented for outstanding service to the unit, group, or wing.\"[4] It may be approved by a group commander and, if a group structure does not exist for a given squadron, the wing commander may designate who has the authority to approve this award.[4] Like the other decorations below the level of Distinguished Service Medal, this award does not come with a full-sized medal of its own. It consists of a ribbon and a certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nCertificate of Recognition for Lifesaving\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Certificate of Recognition for Lifesaving is awarded to members of the Civil Air Patrol \"who save a human life, but do not meet the criteria for the Bronze [Medal of Valor] or Silver Medal of Valor.\"[4] A member may be awarded this decoration for participation in a transport mission of either blood or organs, in which case he or she is presented with a basic ribbon and a certificate that accompanies the decoration.[5] A silver star is attached to the ribbon in recognition of lifesaving actions other than blood or organ transport which still do not meet the requirements of the higher awards. Subsequent awards are denoted by the addition of bronze and silver clasps to the ribbon. If more than three devices are authorized for wear on this ribbon, a second ribbon is worn to the left (from the point of view of the wearer) of the initial ribbon. If future awards reduce the total number of devices to three the second ribbon is removed.\n\nAll nominations for this award must be approved by the relevant CAP wing commander. This award does not come with a full-sized medal of its own,[5] though a miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms.\n\nNational Commander’s Unit Citation Award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe National Commander's Unit Citation Award was approved by Civil Air Patrol's National Board at its March 2006 meeting..\"[6] It is awarded to \"units providing services or achievements above and beyond those normally recognized by a Unit Citation Award.\"[4] Awards are made at the sole discretion of the National Commander of Civil Air Patrol. The ribbon of the award is worn by all cadets and officers who were members of the unit during the time period for which the citation is awarded. Once the award has been made, members may continue to wear the ribbon even if they transfer out of the unit at a later date.[4] Units that have been given the National Commander's Unit Citation Award are entitled to attach a streamer to the colors displayed at the unit's headquarters. This award does not come with a full-sized medal of its own,[5] though a miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms that must be purchased through an outside vendor.[7]\n\nAlthough similar in appearance, this award is not to be confused with the Navy Expeditionary Medal\n\nUnit Citation Award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Civil Air Patrol Unit Citation Award is presented for \"exceptionally meritorious service or exceptionally outstanding achievement.\"[4] This service and achievement must be clearly above that which is performed by other similar units. Members are awarded the Unit Citation Award ribbon if they were members of the unit during the time period for which the citation is awarded.[5] Units can be awarded this citation as a result of extended meritorious service over the course of at least one year, or in recognition of outstanding achievements in a single specific act or notable accomplishment that is separate and distinct from the normal mission or regular function of the unit. The periods of outstanding achievement are normally characterized by definite beginning and ending dates. Units that have been given the Unit Citation Award are entitled to attach a streamer to the colors displayed at the unit's headquarters. This award does not come with a full-sized medal of its own,[5] though a miniature medal is available for senior members to wear on their mess dress uniforms that must be purchased through an outside vendor.[8]\n\nSenior awards\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional development awards\n\n[edit]\n\nTo accomplish its mission, the Civil Air Patrol requires an informed and active senior membership trained in leadership, management, and functional tasks. The Senior Member Professional Development Program prepares members to serve their units, their communities, and their nation. The professional development ribbons are awarded by National Headquarters to denote the level of achievement that a senior member has achieved in this program. The professional development program is divided into five levels.[9]\n\nGill Robb Wilson Award\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Gill Robb Wilson Award\n\nThe Gill Robb Wilson Award was first implemented in 1964 to replace the National Commander’s Citation.[10] It is named after Gill Robb Wilson, the first director of the CAP,[11] and is presented to senior members who complete the fifth level of training in the Senior Member Professional Development Program. This award is issued directly from Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters and is the highest award in the professional development program.[12] This level of training is intended for those performing duty as commanders or staff officers, and is a prerequisite for consideration for duty performance promotion to the grade of lieutenant colonel in CAP. The training program concentrates on advanced leadership and management subjects.[9] This award does not come with a full-sized medal.

A distress find involves a downed aircraft or persons in distress. Normally, a definite search objective must have been assigned, located, and positively identified. Other finds are classified as non-distress; such as locating a non-distress emergency locator transmitter. The basic ribbon is awarded for a first find (distress or non-distress). A bronze clasp is awarded for each additional distress find or for each additional 20 non-distress finds. Both aircrew and ground team members may receive credit for finds. The \"Find\" Ribbon may also be painted on the aircraft in which the find was made.\n\nFinds for the United States Coast Guard. Exceptions to the above criteria may be made for finds accomplished during missions conducted in concert with the USCG or USCG Auxiliary. The bulk of this joint effort consists of CAP flying patrol missions commonly referred to as a “sundown patrol.” When a CAP member or crew locates a boat or persons in distress and is instrumental in their discovery, credit for a distress find may be granted and a “find” ribbon awarded, provided the effort is classified as an assist by the USCG.\n\nFinds by Aircrew Members. In case of a search and rescue find by aircraft, a ribbon will be awarded to all crew members. A bronze three-bladed propeller device is also worn on the ribbon for finds as aircrew members. This applies to both “find and rescue” operations and “find and report” operations. For example, when the search objective is sighted, rescue by aircraft may be impossible so the crew reports the find by relaying the information to an official ground station.\n\nFinds by Ground Personnel. If the find is made by search and rescue ground teams, the ribbon will be awarded to all members of the team which locates the objective. Ground personnel are not awarded the propeller clasp.\n\nCombined Participation. Members who earn the ribbon as aircrew are identified by the bronze propeller attached to the ribbon. If the same individual earn a clasp as a ground member who makes a find, they are authorized to attach the clasp to the same ribbon with the bronze propeller. This also applies to the individual who initially earns the Search “Find” Ribbon as a member of a ground search party and at some later date makes a find as an aircrew member. The member is then authorized to attach the bronze propeller to the ribbon.\n\nAir Search and Rescue Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Air Search and Rescue Ribbon is awarded to members who actively participate in at least 10 search and rescue sorties, with a bronze clasp awarded for each additional 10 sorties. All sorties must be in support of an actual search and rescue mission authorized through appropriate authorities.\n\nAircrew Members. A bronze three-bladed propeller device will be worn centered on Air Search and Rescue Ribbons earned as aircrew members.\n\nGround Personnel. Credit given will be computed on the basis of time spent on a mission and the nature of the duties performed.\n\nGround personnel performing hazardous duties, such as ground rescue or ground search, may be credited with one sortie for each 4 hours of actual participation, not to exceed three sorties in any 24-hour period.\n\nGround personnel performing non-hazardous duties, such as base support or staff functions, may be credited with one sortie for each 8 hours of participation, not to exceed two sorties for any 24-hour period.\n\nCombined Participation. Members who earn the Air Search and Rescue Ribbon as an aircrew member are identified by attaching a bronze propeller to the ribbon. If the same individual earn clasps as a ground member of searches or missions, they are authorized to attach the clasps to the same ribbon with the bronze propeller. This also applies to the individual who initially earned the Air Search and Rescue Ribbon as a member of a ground search party and later participates in enough searches as an aircrew member. Additional clasps are placed so that the ribbon will have a balanced appearance, with bronze propeller(s) in the middle of the ribbon. A silver clasp is used in place of five bronze clasps for member who have participated in fifty additional sorties.\n\nCounterdrug Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Counterdrug Ribbon is awarded to Senior Members for participation in 10 counterdrug sorties. A bronze clasp is awarded for each additional 10 sorties, and replaced by a silver clasp after 50 additional sorties. Cadets are prohibited from participating in Counterdrug operations.\n\nAlthough similar in appearance, this award is not to be confused with the Navy/Marine Corps Commendation Medal.\n\nDisaster Relief Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Disaster Relief Ribbon is awarded for participation in five disaster relief missions and completion of two designated disaster relief training courses. The ribbon may also be awarded for completion of one disaster relief course and 40 hours of disaster relief training or operations. Participation must be verified by the on-scene commander.\n\nThe Disaster Relief Ribbon may be awarded with a Silver \"V\" device to any CAP member who participates as a CAP member in a disaster relief effort for a Presidential declared disaster. Participation in any Presidential declared disaster since 1990 qualifies.\n\nHomeland Security Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Homeland Security Ribbon is awarded for participation in ten Homeland Security sorties, as defined by the tasking organization, which are in the interest of the defense and/or security of the United States. All members participating in the mission in any capacity may be eligible for the ribbon. Personnel performing duties, such as base support or staff functions, may be credited with one sortie for each 8 hours of participation, but may not to exceed two sorties for any 24-hour period.\n\nClasps may be added to the ribbon for participation in every ten additional sorties.\n\nService ribbons\n\n[edit]\n\nCommand Service Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nAwarded to Senior Members who have served at least 1 year continuous service as commander — squadron, group, wing, etc. The basic ribbon is awarded for service as a squadron commander. A bronze star is added to denote service as group commander, a silver star for wing commander, and a gold star for region commander service. Two gold stars will be used to denote service as National Commander. Only one level of command may be shown on the ribbon.\n\nCAP Crisis Service Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst awarded to all active CAP members on December 1, 2021, the CAP Crisis Service Ribbon was established to recognize the CAP membership during periods when the entire organization was under significant stress responding to a lengthy, nationwide emergency.[19]\n\nThe National Commander will determine when to grant this award and the period of service involved. This award ranks immediately before the Red Service Ribbon in the order of precedence. Only one award is earned per service period; awards during additional periods are recognized by the wear of the bronze triangle clasp.\n\nAny active member (cadet/senior/50-year or life) who has served at least 1 day in active status during the period is eligible to wear the ribbon. When the National Commander issues the award, individual member records will be automatically updated to reflect the award.\n\nIn a letter attached to the interim change letter authorizing the award, CAP National Commander Major General Edward D. Phelka stated, \"Beginning in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in CAP’s most noteworthy national service since World War II. Regular operations continued while new missions were explored, millions of meals delivered to the needy, thousands of blood donations were made, and distribution of masks and vaccines were completed across the country. At a time when simply holding regular squadron meetings was challenging due to isolation restrictions, CAP members served the Nation and ensured CAP’s continued operation. In recognition of this effort, I have approved the award of the CAP Crisis Service Ribbon to all active members who served at least one day after 1 March 2020 to a future point to be determined by CAP.\"\n\nOn October 25, 2022, Major General Phelka remarked, in a letter to CAP members, that \"since the crisis nature of the pandemic and its impact on CAP appears to be behind us, I am declaring an official end to the awarding of CAP’s Crisis Service Ribbon in response to the pandemic, effective Oct. 31\" in 2022.\n\nRed Service Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Red Service Ribbon is given to any member of Civil Air Patrol who has been a member of the program for two years (as a cadet or Senior Member in good standing.)[20] In addition, the following devices are awarded for additional years of service.\n\nA first Bronze Clasp is awarded at the end of 3 additional years (total of 5 years).[21]\n\nAdditional Bronze Clasps are awarded for each additional 5 years of service.

The longevity device is worn centered on the red service ribbon and the bronze clasps are no longer worn.[23]\n\nCommunity Service Award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Community Service Ribbon is awarded to senior members and cadets who complete 60 hours of community service. The community service is done outside of Civil Air Patrol, and is verified by someone other than the member. Civil Air Patrol headquarters has now authorized the wear of a bronze device for every additional 60 hours of community service.[24]\n\nCadet Advisory Council Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cadet Advisory Council Ribbon is awarded to the members of a CAC after the conclusion of the term.[25][26] A shoulder cord is worn while a cadet is a primary representative,[25][26] while the ribbon continues to be worn even after the cadet is no longer on the CAC and is also awarded to alternate representatives.[25][26] The wear policy for the Cadet Advisory Council Ribbon was changed in 2007 to allow senior members who earned this ribbon as a cadet to continue wearing the ribbon with the appropriate clasp.[25]\n\nA ribbon awarded for service on a group CAC has no attachments, and primary representatives wear a green shoulder cord.[25] At the wing level, the ribbon has a bronze star attachment and primary representatives wear a red shoulder cord.[25] At a region CAC, the ribbon has a silver star and primary representatives wear a blue shoulder cord.[25] A national level ribbon has a gold star attached and primary representatives wear a gold shoulder cord.[25]\n\nPrograms ribbons\n\n[edit]\n\nThese ribbons are awarded to members for participating in or providing leadership for National Cadet Special Activities, encampments, or other cadet activities.\n\nEncampment Ribbon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Encampment Ribbon is awarded to all cadets and seniors who complete a Civil Air Patrol Encampment successfully.
