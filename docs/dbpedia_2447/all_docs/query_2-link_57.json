        "text": "Richard Maddox\n\nA CONSOLIDATED CATALINA IV amphibious aircraft of No.202 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Castle Archdale in Northern Ireland lifted off from the cold waters of Lough Erne just a few days before Christmas during the final minutes of 19 December 1944 at the start of an anti-submarine patrol.\n\nRAF Castle Archdal on the east edge of the Lough – a large in-land body of water on the island of Ireland close to the border between Northern Ireland – which is part of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland whichwas neutral during the Second World War.\n\nOn board the American-made aircraft – which carried RAF serial JX280/TK-F – the nine-man crew made their final preparations as the aircraft flew to its patrol area.\n\nThey would never reach it.\n\nAt around 0200 on 20 December 1944 JX240 flew into the side of Benoskee Mountain, just 2 miles south of the village of Stradbally, County Kerry, Ireland and some 300 kilometres (186 miles) away from their base.\n\nThe aircraft was apparently flying through heavy rain or in other ‘marginal’ conditions. (1)\n\nThe crash occurred at around 1000 feet (305 metres) above sea level. The summit of the mountain is approximately 2710 feet (826 metres) high. (2)\n\nThe aircraft – full of fuel for what could be a sortie of 11 hours or more, dependng on their patrol area – allowed the resulting fire to burn fiercely, destroying much of the aircraft and causing some of the ammunition onboard to explode. All aboard were killed.\n\nAs the aircraft crashed well within Ireland the recovery was initially carried out by the Irish authorities who recovered the bodies of the crew.\n\nIt is difficult to see how the crash happened at the place that it did.\n\nOne reason may be that the aircraft – perhaps blinded by the weather – was attempting to make a visual sighting to check its position.\n\nA report from the Irish military states that the aircraft was ‘fiying south’when the accident occurred and had already overflown Stradbally. A confidential agreement between the British and Irish governments allowed for transit of aircraft from RAF Archdale through the ‘Donegal’ corridor to the Atlantic but this this would not easily account for the location of the crash.(3) (4)\n\n(Left) An aerial view of RAF Archdale in January 1945 with some 30 aircraft crammed on the slipway, aprons and into hangars as the Lough was frozen .

Outwood windmill – the oldest workng mill in Great Britainst- stands proud as a local landmark and the surrounding area is popular with walkers. (5) (6)\n\nAll these things would have been very familiar to Peter.\n\nAfter his body was repatriated, Peter Lowe was buried in the churchyard of St. John the Baptist church.\n\nThe small church – which dates from 1869 – is surrounded on three sides by woodland and fields on the fourth.\n\nA short walk away was his father’s public house.\n\nKilled at just twenty, he had spent half his life singing in the church choir – a fact comemorated in a small plaque at the end of the choir stalls at the east end of the church, near the door to the vestry.\n\nOn the other side of the vestry is a another door leading to the churchyard.\n\nNear this door, in the northeast corner of the cemetery Peter now rests.\n\nTHE MEMORIAL PLAQUE commemorating John Lowe in the church where he sang as a member of the choir for ten years and his grave in the churchyard.\n\nImage Copyright © R.Maddox 2020.\n\nMore information\n\nThe history of RAF Castle Archdale can be found at https://forgottenairfields.com/airfield-castle-archdale-1270.html and https://www.ww2ni.com/cofermanaghairfields.htm.\n\nThe Squadron’s Official Record Book for December 1944 is held by the UK National Archives at Kew under the designation of Air 27 1185/23 and Air 27 1185/24. These provide basic details of the aircraft serial number, the names of the crew and the take-off time for a specific operation.\n\nA comprehensive description of the loss of Consolidated Catalina JX208 can be found at http://www.ww2irishaviation.com/jx208.html\n\nBesides the memorial plaque at the church where he is buried, Peter is also commemorated on the church’s war memorial and the church’s Roll of Honour.

Troops are on the streets of the Occupied Zone. The Résistance and German authorities continue the cycle of assassinations and reprisals.\n\nPower struggles between Guallist and communist factions split the Résistance.\n\nFactories have been taken over to manufacture products for the Germans.\n\nRationing continues for the French population.\n\nMass arrests of communist sympathisers started in 1941 and Jewish citizens are coming under increasing scrutiny – not just from the Germans directly but through the occupying forces using the French authorities and their Vichy allies to enforce the new order.\n\nUnable to lure foreign workers to Germany itself by the promise of better rations, the German controlled Service du Travail Obligatoire (a scheme whereby more than half a million people were forcibly sent to work in Germany) was just starting.\n\nAfter the evacuation at Dunkirk and the destruction of units of the French naval fleet by the Royal Navy in August 1940, many felt in France and elsewhere felt Britain needed to show its support.\n\nThus Operation SQUABBLE was born.\n\nOrganised by the Special Operations Executive and Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert de la Ferté (himself of French descent) the original plan was for a single attacking aircraft to fly along the mile-long Avenue des Champs-Élysées just as the German Army were parading there and – if the opportunity presented itself – attack the nearby former French Ministre de la Marine (now occupied as the Germany Naval headquarters in France).\n\nSir Philip was Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, the branch of the RAF that operated closely with the Royal Navy and – critical in these circumstances – attack small targets at low level.\n\nCoastal Command had both the aircraft and the aircrew to mount an attack such as this.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Alfred Kitchener ‘Ken’ Gatward was a leading anti-shipping attack expert and was offered the chance of carrying out the attack. It was stressed that it would be an ‘unsafe’ mission using a single aircraft without further support.\n\nGatward and his navigator, Flight Sergeant Gilbert ‘George’ Fern immediately started planning the flight and honing their skills by carrying out attacks on an abandoned wreck in the English Channel.\n\nThe day of the attack dawned and improving weather – that is the lack of cloud cover – forced the pair back to England while they were over France.\n\nThis happened not once but three times and without the advantage of surprise the mission was doomed.\n\nSo on 12 June 1942 the aircraft left the Coastal Command airfield at Thorney Island, Hampshire (just outside Portsmouth) for what the crew had decided would be the final attempt. They had decide that there was to be no more practising.\n\nThis was it.\n\nThey would fly the whole mission at low level to give them the best chance.\n\nCrossing the French coast half an hour after take-off, they managed to avoid both fighter aircraft and flak positions.\n\nAt one point some 30 feet (10 metres above the ground) the aircraft scattered a murder of crows. One lodged in the engine air intake, causing the motor to overheat.\n\nStill they flew on.\n\nApproaching Paris from the south they rounded the Eiffel Tower and then headed for the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs-Élysées.\n\nTheir canons primed and ready, they reportedly flew at less than roof top height down the Champs-Élysées. But not until they had sent one of two banners (made from a French naval ensign back in Britain) fluttering down on the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nBut their German army quarry eluded them. The military parade – something that happened every day after midday – was nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead the crew saw groups of French people happily waving to the aircraft.\n\nAt the other end of the Avenue, the Place de la Concorde with its fountains and the Luxor monument grew ever larger.\n\nSwinging around the 75-foot Egyptian obelisk they lining up on their second objective, the Naval Headquarters.\n\nGatward fired a volley of 20mm shells into the building before dropping the second banner and making off north towards Gare Saint Lazare railway station and then coming around westward to return to England – again at low level.\n\nLanding at RAF Northolt not far from central London, he and Fern delivered 60 photographic images of Paris.\n\nIn 2012 Gatward’s Second World War medal group, together with memorabilia about the flight were sold at auction for £51,000.\n\nSources and more information\n\nhttp://www.reemandansie.com/departments/coins-militaria/\n\nhttp://www.vintagewings.ca/VintageNews/Stories/tabid/116/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/450/Ten-Minute-Triumph-Over-Tyranny.aspx\n\nhttp://www.neatorama.com/2012/12/06/June-1942-RAF-Drops-French-Flag-on-Occupied-Paris-Strafes-Gestapo-HQ/"
