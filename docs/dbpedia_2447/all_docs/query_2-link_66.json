        "text": "Early Life.\n\nGeorge Henry Cronin was born on the 14th March 1920 in Camberwell, London. He was baptised on the 4th April 1920 at St. Giles, Camberwell. At this time his family were living at 53 Westmacott Street, Camberwell and his father was employed as a Carman.\n\nHis father, Arthur Joseph Cronin, was born on the 18th October 1890 at Camberwell and married his mother, Florence Harriet Leighton, who was born on the 9th January 1890 also in Camberwell, on the 8th June 1913 at Emanuel Church, Camberwell. They both gave their address as 19 Westmacott Street, Camberwell. Arthur was employed as a Carman.\n\nThey had four sons all born in Camberwell:\n\n1. Arthur John William Cronin born in 1914. 2. William Albert James Cronin born in 1915 died 1918 at Lambeth. 3. George Henry Cronin. 4. John Alexander Cronin born in 1927.\n\nDuring World War 1 George’s father, Arthur Joseph Cronin, was Corporal 76490 and whilst serving with the 140th Siege Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery was awarded a Military Medal. His Military service was to influence George’s choices later in life.\n\nThe 1921 census records that George is living with his parents and surviving elder brother at 53 Westmacott Street, Camberwell and his father is employed as a Horse Carman by Mr. F. Newman a Greengrocer of 6 Southampton Street, Camberwell.\n\nLittle further is known about the next few years of George’s life other than he received an Elementary education. In the 1939 Register his parents and younger brother were living at 83 Edmund Street, Camberwell.\n\nArmy Service – World War 2.\n\nGeorge’s Army Service Record is held by the Ministry of Defence and is not readily available however, from a number of other official sources and his Police Service Record we know the following. In 1938, aged 18 years, George enlisted in the Royal Artillery Territorial Army as Gunner 891123.\n\nOn the 31st August 1939 he was embodied into the regular Army and mobilised on 2nd September 1939 the day after war against Germany was declared.\n\nAs Gunner 891123 he was sent to France as part of the 92nd Field Regiment Royal Artillery of the British Expeditionary Force.\n\nBritish Army Casualty List 230 (Other Ranks) (this list contains all casualties reported to the War Office Casualty Section for the 24 hours ended 9 a.m. 13th June 1940) shows Gunner 891123 G.H. Cronin as being wounded but does not record the actual date he was wounded. His Police Service Record later shows that he had a 2 inch scar on his lower right jaw.\n\nDunkirk Evacuation.\n\nThe Dunkirk evacuation, codenamed Operation Dynamo, was the evacuation of more than 338,000 Allied soldiers during the Second World War from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, in the north of France, between 26 May and 4 June 1940.\n\nA Brief History of the 92nd Field Regiment Royal Artillery [List of regiments of the Royal Artillery (1938–1947) – source Wikipedia, Ed.]\n\nArras and Dunkirk\n\nThe 92nd (5th London) Field Regiment took over the 18 pounder guns of 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and moved to France in November 1939. On 28 December 1939 it joined 5th Division, which was being assembled in the new British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. For the remainder of the war it served in this formation, alongside 91st (4th London) Field Regiment from Lewisham. The two regiments were deployed around Auchy-les-Mines; 92nd (5th London) Field Regiment later moved to Armentières, grouped with the Division’s 13th Brigade. During the Norwegian Campaign 5th Division was pulled out of the line and warned for a transfer to Norway, so that when the Battle of France began on 10 May, the Division was in reserve, with 92nd (5th London) Field Regiment detached at Lihus since 29 April.\n\nThe BEF started its advance north into Belgium to defend the line of the Dyle in accordance with ‘Plan D’, and 5th Division reached as far as Brussels. But the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again to the line of the Escaut.\n\nThe guns of the reserve divisions, 5th and 50th (Northumbrian), assembled in the rear, and on the night of 19 May 92nd Field Regiment fired 2000 rounds. By 20 May the German breakthrough had cut the BEF off from the French armies. On that day 5th and 50th Divisions together with 1st Tank Brigade formed ‘Frankforce’ (under Major General H.E. Franklyn of 5th Division) to hold the south-facing salient around Arras. Next day, Frankforce counter-attacked against the German Panzers moving west past Arras. Two columns were formed, each with a tank battalion, a battalion of the Durham Light Infantry from 50th Division, and some anti-tank guns. Each column was accompanied by a battery of 92nd (5th London) Field Regiment: 365 Battery with the Right Column and 368 Battery with the Left. The armoured thrust made some progress but ran into strong opposition and was bombed by the Luftwaffe. There was no artillery fire plan, and 92nd Field Regiment’s guns were not called upon to fire until late in the day. The attacking columns withdrew at nightfall and at 04.00 on 22 May 92nd Field Regiment was withdrawn to positions round Givenchy. The regiment blamed a French withdrawal and lack of air support for the failure of the operation, but it is now recognised that the Arras counterattack seriously delayed the German advance.\n\nOn 22 May the Germans prepared to cross the River Scarpe from the west. 5th Divisional artillery was concentrated and did ‘much execution’ to the attackers but by late afternoon on 23 May the enemy were across in strength, despite having their bridges destroyed several times by the gunners. At last light, Frankforce was ordered to hold out to the last round, but the situation in Arras was now hopeless and the BEF’s commander, Lord Gort changed the orders at midnight, directing Frankforce to move north out of the salient as quickly as possible. The gunners began a ‘nightmare’ withdrawal down the only road, which was being used by two Divisions. Nevertheless, most of the garrison got away to new defensive positions on the canal between Béthune and La Bassée.\n\nOn 26 May, Frankforce was rushed further north to plug a gap in the line left by the retreating Belgian army. 5th Division only arrived at the last minute; with the positions they were to occupy south of Ypres already under German shellfire. On that day Gort made the decision to evacuate the BEF from Dunkirk. The guns of 5th Division were in action under heavy fire during the Battle of the Ypres–Comines Canal, first at Ploegsteert, then on the Yser, until 29 May. Most of the division then withdrew to the inner perimeter and embarked for England, but guns were required to stay behind to bolster 50th Division’s defences for a further 24 hours, and it was not until early on 1 June that the last of 5th Division’s gunners destroyed their remaining equipment and were evacuated.\n\nWithout his Army Service Record it cannot be proved beyond doubt, but it would seem that George was in the ‘thick’ of it in France until wounded and evacuated at Dunkirk. Once back in England he would have spent time recovering from his wounds.\n\nMarriage.\n\nGeorge Henry Cronin married Elsie Marie Finney on the 8th December 1940 at Camberwell. Elsie was born on the 16th October 1919 in Camberwell. In the 1939 Register she is shown as living with her family at 60 Southampton Way, Camberwell and employed as a general worker for a yeast food manufacturer. They had a daughter and a son and later adopted an eleven year old girl who was blind in one eye and deaf.\n\nAfrica.\n\nGeorge recovered from his wound and later served in Africa with the 152nd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery as Bombardier and Sergeant.\n\nA Brief History of the 152nd Field Regiment Royal Artillery [List of regiments of the Royal Artillery (1938–1947) – source Wikipedia, Ed.]\n\nOriginally the Ayrshire Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry this Territorial Army Unit went through many changes over the years. Between the First and Second World Wars, the regiment returned to its horsed cavalry training in Scotland. However, at the beginning of Second World War, the Ayrshire Yeomanry was not required as a cavalry or as an armoured regiment. In 1940, the regiment was transferred into the Royal Artillery (RA) and duly formed two Regiments of Field Artillery; 151st (Ayrshire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA, formed in February, and 152nd (Ayrshire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA, formed in April as a second-line duplicate.\n\n152nd (Ayrshire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA.\n\nThe 152nd was attached to the 6th Armoured Division in mid-1942 and moved with the Division to North Africa that November. It remained with the division through the remainder of the war, fighting in the Tunisia Campaign, and the Italian Campaign, ending the war in Austria.\n\nGeorge was awarded the Africa Star and 1st Army Clasp for his service in Africa. The 1st Army Clasp was awarded to holders of the Africa Star who served with the 1st Army between 23rd October 1942 and 23rd May 1943. Worn on the ribbon of the Africa Star and represented on the ribbon bar by an Arabic numeral.\n\nItaly.\n\nGeorge then went on to serve in Italy and Palestine with the 2nd and 19th Field Regiments RA and with Headquarters 1st British Infantry Divisional Artillery as Sergeant, Staff Sergeant and Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major).\n\nBritish Empire Medal.\n\nWhilst taking part in the Beachhead landing at Anzio, Italy George was recommended for the award of a British Empire Medal. The recommendation by Brigadier G.R. Mockler D.S.O. was as follows:\n\nFor most meritorious service and devotion to duty in the Anzio and Gothic Line campaigns in Italy. During this period Sjt. Cronin has acted first as ‘G’ Clerk and later Head Clerk in the HQ RA office of the First Divisional Artillery. He has shown an outstanding and untiring devotion to duty and has often carried out his duties with an exceptional ability whilst working under trying conditions and at times when suffering from ill health. For considerable periods in battle, he has remained on duty by day and night in order that fire plans could be produced in time and some rest afforded to his hard pressed staff. His willing help to the Regiments of the Div. Arty. In clerical matters has been most marked and his loyalty and high sense of duty to the HQ RA officers is most worthy of recognition. His work out of battle has remained at an equally high standard providing an example to all with whom he has been in contact and a matter of praise to me as his CRA. [CRA – Commander Royal Artillery Ed.]\n\nGazetted.\n\nIn the supplement to the London Gazette dated 13th December 1945 the award was announced under the heading: Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, St. James Palace S.W.1 13th December 1945. The King has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the British Empire Medal (Military Division), in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Italy, to the undermentioned:\n\nNo. 8911123 Staff Sergeant (Acting) George Henry Cronin, Royal Regiment of Artillery (London S.E.5).\n\nGeorge’s Police Service Records show that he was released from the Army during 1945 as a Regimental Sergeant Major and also, slightly confusingly, that he continued to serve until 21st June 1946, at which point he had served 6 years 293 days, having been mobilised on 2nd September 1939. However, he was awarded the Territorial Army Efficiency Medal and the criteria for its award was twelve years of efficient service on the active list of the Militia or the Territorial Army of the United Kingdom. So, as he joined in 1938, he must have remained in the Territorial Army at least until 1950. When he was demobilised, and the date is unknown, he was placed in Reserve Class Z (T) [The Class Z Reserve was a Reserve contingent of the British Army consisting of soldiers and officers who had served between 3rd September 1939 and 31st December 1948 who were available for recall if under 45 years of age. Ed.]\n\nGeorge received the following medals: British Empire Medal, Africa Star, 1st Army Clasp, Italian Star, 1939/45 Star, Defence Medal, War Medal and the Territorial Army Efficiency Medal.\n\nLife After World War 2.\n\nAfter his War Service George had been working as a clerk with a London Stockbroker Grenfell & Co., 62 London Wall, E.C.2 where he developed a keen interest in investment.\n\nThe voters Registers of 1945 to 1949 list George H. and Elsie Cronin as living at 17 Camberwell Church Street, Camberwell.\n\nHe then decided, at the age of 29, to join the Police and he applied to join the Essex County Constabulary.\n\nPolice Service.\n\nA copy of George’s Essex County Constabulary Record of Service has survived and shows he was Appointed as Probationary Constable 362 on the 2nd February 1950 and approved of and sworn in at Chelmsford on the same day. His starting salary was £300 per annum.\n\nHe gave his place and date of birth as Camberwell, London on he 14th March 1920, his height was 5 feet 11 inches, he had brown eyes and hair with a fresh complexion, and he had a 2 inch scar on his lower right jaw. He said his religion was Church of England.\n\nHe also provided details of his marriage, children, previous occupation, education and Military Service.\n\nTraining School And First Posting.\n\nGeorge attended No. 5 District Police Training College, Eynsham Hall, Oxfordshire from the 5th February 1950 to the 7th May 1950. Whilst here he passed a First Aid course. On his return he attended the Headquarters Training School from the 8th to the 12th May 1950.\n\nOn successfully passing his course he was posted on the 13th May 1950 to Romford Division in Romford itself, where he performed duties as a Town Beat Constable. From the 12th February to the 10th March 1951, he attended the 1st year Probationers Course at Police Headquarters and from the 30th April to the 27th May 1951 he attended an Elementary C.I.D. Course.\n\nPosting.\n\nOn the 4th June 1951 he was posted to Emerson Park, Romford Division where he performed duties on a detached section. From the 31st December 1951 to the 12th January 1952, he attended his Final Probationers Course and on the 2nd February 1952 his Appointment was confirmed.\n\nDuring December 1953 at Romford, he passed his First Aid Voucher. In 1954 at Romford, he passed his First Aid Medallion and April 1961 at Pitsea he passed a First Aid Label exam.\n\nOn the 15th March 1954 at Romford, he passed a Police Duties exam for promotion to Sergeant.\n\nCommendations.\n\nGeorge was commended twice. On the first occasion by the Justices at Romford Magistrates Court on 19th June 1956, for the very precise manner in which he gave evidence and for the skilful way he prepared a sketch plan in connection with charges under Sections 11 and 13 Road Traffic Act 1930.\n\nOn the second occasion again by the Justices at Romford Magistrates Court on 12th December 1956, for the way in which he carried out his enquiries into a case of wilful damage.\n\nPromotion to Sergeant And Posting.\n\nGeorge was promoted to Sergeant on the 21st June 1957 on a salary of £695 per annum. He was posted to Brentwood Division at Pitsea Station where he performed duties as a town Patrol Sergeant. A year later his promotion was confirmed.\n\nBetween the 13th and 25th June 1960, he attended a Sergeants Course at Headquarters.\n\nOn the 3rd August 1961 he was moved within the Brentwood Division to Basildon where he performed duties on a detached section.\n\nBetween the 7th and the 17th November 1961, he attended Headquarters for a lightweight motorcycle training course.\n\nFollowing the creation of the new Division of Basildon on the 2nd December 1963 he was transferred, on paper, remaining at Basildon Police Station.\n\nFollowing three previously failed attempts he successfully passed the Police Duties Exam for Promotion to Inspector on the 6th February 1963 at Romford.\n\nBramshill.\n\nBetween the 5th October 1964 and the 19th March 1965, he attended Junior ‘A’ Course A/64/4 at Bramshill Police College, Hartley Wintney, Hampshire. The Commandant’s final report dated 19th March 1965 was as follows:\n\nSergeant Cronin is a seasoned and capable officer of pleasing personality. His quiet and unassuming manner conceals considerable strength of character, and he has exercised a particularly good influence on his younger colleagues. He has a dry and engaging sense of humour. His attitude to his work at the College has been consistently clear minded and discriminating. He accepts nothing without good evidence and is persistent in seeking the roots of problems. He reacts well to new ideas. He inspires both respect and liking, has sound judgement and satisfactory powers of command and leadership.\n\nIn the department of General Studies, he worked well and made very satisfactory progress. His written work was the product of diligent research and showed marked improvement in expression and presentation, reaching a high standard. He was well to the fore in discussions and displayed good powers of logical thought. Although not a forceful speaker, he was fluent and effective in a quiet way.\n\nHe worked hard and conscientiously in the Department of Professional Studies. His research papers were well prepared and his lectures satisfactory delivered. Although rather quietly spoken he made a determined effort and successfully entered into all the syndicate discussions, to which he made valuable contributions. He drew widely on his military and police experience. His written work was consistently of a high standard and always carefully prepared. He showed ability to think ahead and plan and gave orders satisfactory. He improved his moderate knowledge of the criminal law considerably.\n\nHe took a very full part in both the sporting and social activities of the college and was Hon. Secretary of the Play-Reading Section of the Club. He mixed easily with his colleagues and with visitors.\n\nSergeant Cronin has excellent personal and professional qualities which would enable him to discharge the duties of an Inspector with credit.\n\nA new Posting.\n\nOn the 4th May 1964 George was transferred to Headquarters and the Force Training Department. As a Sergeant Instructor he gained a wide experience of lecturing to Sergeants and Constables, not only from Essex but from other Forces in the No. 5 Police District.\n\nPromotion To Inspector.\n\nGeorge was promoted to Inspector on the 1st May 1965 on a salary of £1375 per annum. He remained in the Headquarters Training Department as a Senior Instructor. He was responsible for the content of courses run at the Force Training School. He was also responsible for preparing ‘Notes and Comments’ which was the Force method of interpreting all new legislation and case law and disseminating it to every member of the Force in simple terms. Also, whilst an Inspector the Essex Force commenced directed study courses for members of the Force studying for promotion examinations and he was responsible for preparing a text for the course which replaced the many textbooks normally required for such study. This text comprehensively covered the syllabus for both the Sergeants and Inspectors examinations. He was also responsible for answering many legal queries which arose in the day-to-day running of the Force. He was also responsible for running a series of courses for Senior Cadets.\n\nBetween the 22nd and 24th May 1967 he attended a man management course.\n\nPromotion To Chief Inspector.\n\nGeorge was promoted to Chief Inspector on the 21st August 1967 on a salary of £1625 per annum. He again remained at the Force Training School where he became second in command of the Department. He assumed some responsibility for recruit selection both for Constables and Cadets. Owing to a number of rapid changes in command he was, for periods, in charge of the Department and sat on selection boards for Constables and Cadets. In addition, whenever Civil Defence Mobile Column exercises took place in Essex he arranged exercises for the column.\n\nOutside Interests.\n\nGeorge had an interest in Youth Services and at one time had been an organiser of a boy’s club under the auspices of the National Association of Boys’ Clubs. He also had an interest in drama and whilst he was a limited performer he was a keen Assistant Stage Manager. He was also a regular contributor to the Force Magazine and Secretary to the Divisional Sports Club.\n\nTransferring To Hertfordshire Constabulary And Promotion To Superintendent.\n\nOn the 31st of July 1967 Hertfordshire Constabulary moved their Training Department from their old Headquarters site at Hatfield to a new purpose built building at the new Headquarters site in Stanborough Road, Welwyn Garden City. With the proposed addition of new accommodation blocks in which to house a vastly increased Cadet Corps a Superintendent was sought to run the Training Department. George applied for the post.\n\nHis Hertfordshire Constabulary Personal Record and other documents have survived.\n\nHe completed a four page Hertfordshire Constabulary questionnaire providing particulars in support of his application for appointment of Superintendent Grade II (Training Officer).\n\nHe gave the following information: His address as 338, Springfield Road, Chelmsford, Essex, age: 48 years, date of birth: 14th March 1920, status and family: married with two girls aged 21 years and one boy aged 19 years, present appointment: Chief Inspector second-in-command of Recruiting and Training Department, pensionable Police Service: from 2nd February 1950 to date – 18 years 5 months all served in Essex County Constabulary.\n\nDetails of his education, promotion examinations, courses attended, previous appointments, details of Police experience, War Service, outside interests and additional information have already been described above.\n\nOn the 25th July 1968 Chief Constable J. Nightingale, Essex County Constabulary wrote to the Deputy Chief Constable of Hertfordshire:\n\nAppointment of Superintendent II (Training Officer).\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd of July, Chief Inspector Cronin joined this Force on the 2nd of February 1950, and after service on ordinary duty he was promoted Sergeant in June 1957, and remained on ordinary duty. In May 1964 he was transferred to the Training Department at this Headquarters and was successfully promoted Inspector in May 1965 and Chief Inspector in August 1967 within the Department.\n\nHe is a most capable officer in the field of training and described by his Superintendent as outstanding in many respects. I am sure that this within this Force, after further experience on ordinary duty, Mr. Cronin will rise to higher rank, and I would be quite happy now to have him as the officer in charge of my Training Department.\n\nMr. Cronin holds the B.E.M. which he was awarded while serving in the Armed Forces before joining the Police.\n\nHe attended Course A.64/4 at the Police College and received a very good report.\n\nI enclose a copy of his Record of Service and his Personnel File and should be glad if you will return the latter when it has served your purpose.\n\nYours faithfully J. Nightingale Chief Constable of Essex.\n\nInterviewed.\n\nHe was invited for an interview on the 2nd August 1968 and was accepted for the role by Chief Constable Albert Wilcox the same day. He subsequently left Essex County Constabulary on the 31st August 1968 and was Appointed as Superintendent Class II, Warrant No. 1002 on the 1st September 1968 and Attested at St. Albans Magistrates Court on the 4th September 1968. He was posted to R Division, Training Department and occupied 4 Nelsons Avenue, St. Albans.\n\nGeorge’s Hertfordshire Constabulary Personal Record mirrors his Essex Record with a few minor differences such as his hair was recorded as now being grey and that he had been awarded his Police Long Service and Good Conduct medal.\n\nCourses.\n\nBetween 21st and 22nd November 1968 George attended a course on Instruction Techniques at Headquarters. Then between the 12th and 13th November 1969 he attended a Community Relations Course. Between thee 14th and 18th December 1970 he attended a Personnel Management Course at The Whitehouse, Chelmwood Gate, East Grinstead,\n\nAnnual Reports.\n\nThree of George’s Annual Reports have survived for 1970, 1971 and 1973.\n\nOn 5th November 1970 Assistant Chief Constable L. Sample completed George’s Annual Report as follows: Superintendent Cronin is one of those rare individuals who is wholly dedicated to his work regardless of rank or financial compensation. Although he has the ability to apply successfully for other posts involving higher rank he will decline to do so, certainly during the next 18 months, because he would like to remain in his present post until the increased Cadet Force and the new training establishment is properly underway. Superintendent Cronin is extremely deceptive in his rather aged appearance which belies the massive amount of energy which he possesses. He’s never submerged by pressure of work and invariably produces results on time. His Service experience, where he rose to the rank of Regimental Sergeant Major, stands him in good stead in the assessment and control of staff and his wide-ranging knowledge of world affairs enables him to be at ease in any company and act as a good ambassador for the Hertfordshire Constabulary. He is an acknowledged authority on all aspects of law and his interpretations and advice are invariably accurate and sound. The two children of his marriage have both obtained scholarships to Oxford and not only have they gained first class honours degrees, but in their respective spheres of study they have gained special prizes and scholarships. He also has a daughter who was adopted 12 years ago at the age of 11 she’s blind in one eye and deaf, in this act of adoption and the subsequent care lavished on this girl gives a good indication of his human and compassionate nature. I would assess Superintendent Cronin as the most loyal of loyal officers and the good of the Force will always come before personal advancement and renumeration. [George’s adopted daughter was Ruth Iris Cronin and in Supplement No.1 of the London Gazette, dated 14th June 2003, there is a Miss Ruth Iris Cronin who is shown as an Administrative Officer, Jobcentre Plus, Department of Work and Pensions who was awarded a MBE. A person of the same name died in St. Albans in 2017. Ed.]\n\nOn 10th November 1971 Assistant Chief Constable L. Sample completed George’s Annual Report as follows: This report must be read in conjunction with the 1970 report and all the remarks therein are equally applicable to an even greater degree.\n\nHe preferred not to be considered in the last rounds of promotion because he was keen to complete the groundwork for the additional training now possible with the extended facilities in the training block and he was anxious to get everything going along the right lines. Extensions both in the training block and in the hostel accommodation have naturally led to a considerable increase in his responsibilities and inevitably a heavier workload has fallen on his shoulders. With characteristic sang-froid he has taken all this in his stride, completely reorganised the Force training and cadet programmes with the minimum of fuss.\n\nHe is served by a loyal and hardworking staff, but this has not been brought about by accident; he always gets the best out of people and has a deep understanding of human nature.\n\nWhen he feels he has fulfilled his purpose in the Training Department, I am certain he will make an equal success of any Divisional post to which he may be appointed.\n\nOn 1st June 1973 Assistant Chief Constable L. Sample completed George’s Annual Report as follows: Superintendent Cronin has completed over four years in charge of the Training Department. Now that the additional training which is made possible by the increased accommodation is well established, the time is opportune for him to be considered for a change of post.\n\nHe has emerged from these four years as a benign father figure, wholly sincere and with the ability to appropriately use the delicate nuances of approach necessary to get full response and cooperation from a wide range of individuals – cadets, parents, instructors, teaching staff, colleagues and supervisory officers.\n\nHis capacity for work has in no way diminished and, by example, he leads a very efficient and fully stretched department. Although he makes no requests which would savour of personal advancement, I feel that Superintendent Cronin would now welcome the opportunity to test his qualities in other branches of police work I think he would be particularly attracted to, and admirably suited for, a Divisional Deputy Command or a Sub-Divisional Command.\n\nOn the 23rd August 1975 George occupied his own accommodation at 40, Stanhope Road, St. Albans.\n\nRetirement.\n\nGeorge stayed in the Training Department for the remainder of his service. On the 18th July 1977 he notified his intention to retire and made an application for his War Service to count towards a full pension. His request was accepted, and he retired on the 30th September 1977 after 27 years and 241 days plus his War Service.\n\nGeorge Henry Cronin died on the 13th November 1993 at St. Albans City Hospital aged 73 years. His funeral was held at 1.30 p.m. Thursday 18th November at Garston Crematorium."
