        "text": "Author, artist, historian and researcher Terry Higgins has been writing, illustrating and assembling a comprehensive historical compendium of the exploits of the famous 404 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force. As part of Black History Month, Higgins has assembled a chronological narrative of 404 ops covering the period when the RCAF's first black combat pilot Flying Officer Allan Selwyn Bundy played a part in their vaunted history.\n\nFlying Officer (F/O) Allan Selwyn Bundy’s name first appears in the 404 Squadron ORB (Operations Record Books) within an un-embellished 8 October, 1944 summary where it is noted that he and his NCO navigator, Flight Sergeant (F/S) Wright, together with another newly arrived crew were “declared fit for ops.” Two days later the two crews were in the air local to their new home in Scotland – the RAF Airfield at Banff – honing up on their formation flying skills. Even this early on, it becomes apparent that the other new crew – F/O Jones and Warrant Officer (W/O) Elliott – were practically bonded to Bundy and Wright for the duration. Casting ahead in the official record one can see that they were, with rare exception, together in the air at the same time on most ops where either one or the other was a participant. If the ORB entry order is any indication this usually had the Bundy crew as lead with the Jones crew on its wing. They would fly with other leaders or wingmen as the case may be from time to time.\n\nMeanwhile the squadron did its best to stay in constant contact with its foe up and down the Norwegian coast. A twilight “Big Do” on the 9th had the commander, Wing Commander (W/C) Pierce, leading very experienced crews against a good-sized convoy. The highly coordinated strike force, which included a Warwick to create a flare path of coloured markers on the water, set itself up, predawn, in the target area. With anti flak specialist Mosquitoes of 235 Squadron going in first followed by the actual strike machines – 404 with rocket projectiles (R/P) and 144 Squadron with Torpedoes – it was an unmitigated success which resulted in widespread damage to nearly all vessels, two confirmed sinkings, and no losses to any of the three squadrons involved. For the next few days the seasonal North Sea weather played its part in keeping enemy shipping safe against the will of 18 Group’s singular (at the time) strike wing; a theme not uncommon throughout the winter of 1944/45. With a scrubbed “best laid plans” and a furtive effort turned back by the weather in between, the veil of winter lifted on the 15th. A good enough day for the Buffaloes to test the mettle of their two newest crews.\n\nThroughout the remainder of October the rookie crews logged four more operational hops. Bundy and Wright crewed NE800 on two of those. The first one, on the 18th, was back to the Naze area where the tanker of the previous action could be seen still aflame. Presumably parts of her superstructure remained above water. Heavy flak was encountered throughout and “considerable shipping was observed in Kristiansand Harbour.” The sighting was likely made on the way home; low on fuel, no attack was made. The next day was similar. Typical of these en masse armed recce trips, give or take four hours lapsed between take off and landing. However S/L Bobby Schoales DFC, led the 404 contingent in “Bundy’s” NE800 while Bundy and Wright remained at Banff.\n\nThe 21st was another Big Do under the very capable leadership of S/L Christison DFC. The twelve (ORB gives twelve but there appears to have been a thirteenth – W/C Pierce’s EE•X – in the Details of Sortie narrative) Beaufighters of 404 were accompanied by nine similar aircraft of 144 Squadron, several Mosquito outriders* of 333 (Norwegian) Squadron and a number of Mosquitoes from both 235 and 248 Squadrons. Bundy and Wright crewed NT991 EE•E on this trip with Jones and Elliott right behind them in the oldest of the Squadron’s veteran warhorses, LX940 EE•Y. NE800 stayed on the ground for reasons unknown; most likely routine maintenance. The force made landfall at Utvaer after which a 333 scout raced up the coast all the way to Askvoll Harbour sniffing for enemy shipping. After he reported in the negative the main group split with 18 aircraft, including half of 404s Beaus, patrolling towards Stadlandet. With no targets in sight they all headed for home. Meanwhile the balance, including Bundy and Jones amoung the seven Buffaloes present, headed south towards Haugesund with P/333 darting along the coastline looking for quarry. Two merchant vessels (M/V) and an armed trawler (TTA) were unlucky enough to be in Haugesund Harbour. The strike aircraft went at them in a fury of cannon fire and R/P salvoes. In the company of three very experienced crews – Wainman / Stoddart in NE669 EE•A, Christison in LZ451 EE•M, and Flynn / Michael in NV177 EE•Z – Bundy attacked the largest M/V. Their combined effort claimed 18 dry and 4 underwater R/P hits; 20 out of the total of 36 armour piercing rounds from the four Beaus found their mark. Their cannon fire struck the bridge and amidships. The smaller M/V received accurate R/P and cannon fire from two of 404s cohort. The escort apparently escaped after putting up intense flak and P.A.C.s (projected or parachute aerial cables – cables shot vertically up from ships via a small rocket to discourage attacking aircraft). Returning crews reported leaving the vessels on fire. Both M/Vs – the German vessel Eckenheim (1923 tons) and the Norwegian Vestra (1422 tons) – sank (the larger one was reportedly raised not long afterwards). No aircraft were lost but Christison brought old “M” back with a large hole in her port tail plane.\n\n• \"Outrider\" was a term coined within the 18 Group Strike Wings for specialist armed recce crews that would perform either single aircraft or two aircraft Rovers ahead of a mission launch, or real time recce as part of a strike group. In the Rover profile, they would either radio back found target details before landing themselves (passing the thus activated outward-bound strike group while they themselves were homeward bound) or report directly in person upon landing. When flying to the target area with a strike group, they would venture out ahead darting in and out of the fjords and harbours looking for verifiable targets and, with the mission commander's okay, direct part or all of the group onto the target. Recommending the best approach (ingress direction and height, etc) was usually part of their job as well. Later in the war, some squadrons used seasoned crews, familiar as they were with the target area, as outriders but more often than not the job went to the specialist 333 (Norwegian) Squadron based at Banff. This squadron's crews had very intimate knowledge of the coastline of their German-occupied homeland.\n\nThis was to be 404s last operational Beaufighter hop out of Banff, for on the 20th they had received the order to move to Dallachy up the coast in Morayshire. After settling into the new airfield’s more austere surroundings, it did not take long before ops were on again. W/C Pierce led 22 Beaus (12 of 404 plus 10 of 144) out of Dallachy in the early afternoon of the 25th and headed towards the Norge coast, picking up an escort of two Mosquitoes out of Banff along the way. Hitting bad weather before they reached the target area, the force turned back with all aircraft landing between 1613 and 1639. Bundy, flying his NE800 again, logged another 3+ hours of operational time. The weather kept everybody on the ground the following day. Another attempt was made on the 27th with “Chris” Christison, the A flight commander, leading the pack. Again the weather was in favour of enemy shipping. All 24 Beaufighters (12 each from 404 and 144) were back on the ground by 1606. Bundy, Wright and NE800 clocked up another 3+ hours. The new guys did not participate in the final outing of October 1944 but both of “their aircraft” went along in the hands of two other crews. The strike group did discover an escort vessel, which opened up on them, but they did not attack since no primary targets – merchant vessels – were discovered.\n\nNovember started with what the squadron had now come to know as typical weather for the season in the region. For the first few days the only flying was a trip to Coastal Command HQ for the Officer Commanding (OC) on the 1st. On 2 November the squadron aircrews, released until midnight, enjoyed a liberty run to Elgin by coach. Next day the weather started to improve. Most of the flying was local while F/L Shulemson DSO flew the Wing Armament Officer S/L Worley to RAF Station Tain to have a look at the ranges there. The 4th started with favourable skies but the met forecast promised that it would get worse. F/L Shulemson left for RAF Station Millfield to take a special course on rockets (the author believes that this was when the switch to new R/P setups – better rails, better AP warheads, and better rocket motors – was coming down the pipes) and a few other crews did some local flying, no doubt completing maintenance air tests. Despite the less than desirable met earlier in the day, by mid morning twelve crews were rallied. A Do was on!\n\nAll twelve, including Bundy and Wright in their trusty steed and their companions Jones and Elliott (their regular mount was NV416 EE•J) from OTU days, were in the air within the 8 minutes between 1218 and 1226 under the leadership of flight commander S/L Schoales. The armed recce made it all the way to the Norwegian coast through intermittent showers. After making landfall at Lista Light the group attempted their planned Rover south along the Skagerrak coast between Egero (a few minutes east of Lista) and Homborsund in worsening weather. It appears the met was right for once! “Adverse weather conditions prevented ideal observations” and all they sighted was three fishing trawlers. To make matters worse three aircraft were plagued with technical troubles; two, R/404 and H/404, with hydraulic pressure issues and one, Bundy’s NE800 EE•N, with a faulty altimeter. Both N/404 and R/404 had to peel off and return individually. R/404 made Dallachy successfully while Bundy landed nearby at Milltown. With nothing detailed in the ORB, it can be assumed that he either got lost on the trip back across the North Sea or may have preferred certain characteristics of this airfield in light of the weather and the fickle altimeter. Meanwhile H/404 stuck with the patrol but had to peel off to land at Banff . The remainder of the group carried on up the coast to Dallachy. The airfield was complete socked in by the time the last engines were shut down. The ORB does not report on how and when the guys made the hop back to Dallachy. Scant entries for 5, 6, and 7 November note variable weather, local formation and low flying practice, the return of the OC from Coastal HQ, and various postings in and out.\n\nPresumably they flew back on one of those days for Bundy’s aircraft was the tail-end charlie, crewed by WOs Ramsden and Rimble, as part of a 24 aircraft (including six Buffaloes) morning Rover while the Bundy/Wright (in Y/404) and Jones/Elliott (in P/404) crews flew wing to two very experienced crews (Flynn/Michael in M/404 and Watlington DFM / Henderson in K/404) on an anti U-boat patrol (A/U) in the afternoon. They were obviously expecting some business on the A/U patrol; with them were 3 Beaus from the new Dallachy Strike Wing’s 455 Squadron and 3 fighter escort Mosquitoes picked up at Banff on the way out over the North Sea. After 12 minutes searching due north from Stavanger, nothing appeared so they returned to base.\n\nMeanwhile, the morning Rover was very successful. The 333 Squadron outrider sniffed out a covey of 3 coasters and 2 M/V huddled in Midtgulenfjord. With high hills on both sides of the narrow fjord, the attackers had to be careful to avoid both ground impact and more concentrated flak. Execution, discipline, and leadership were impeccable. The strike group left two large M/V sinking (the 2755 ton Helga Ferdinand and the 3000 ton Aquila, both later confirmed sunk) and the Norwegian ferry Framnaes so badly damaged that it had to beach. NE800 and crew did their part, unloading its eight R/P rounds and cannon bursts into the larger of the two freighters. F/O LC Boileau and his navigator F/O WH McCamus, who led this strike in the OC Pierce’s usual aircraft NV173 EE•X, both received DFCs for this action.\n\nNext morning, under a sky hemmed in with threatening cloud cover, a high level conference on training was held in the station commander’s office. All squadron commanders, flight commanders, and specialist officers were in attendance. That afternoon a Coastal Command combat film was shown to all aircrew in the crew room and there was no flying other than one single air test.\n\nOn the 20th the weather showed some promise in the morning but deteriorated by the afternoon. Still the old standby exercise of local formation flying was carried out, along with a few air tests. The operational Big Do of the 21st (mentioned above) left Dallachy under an angry sky and returned some 5 hours later under similar weather. The next day was more of the same on the weather front. The squadron managed only one air test before being released on liberty to Elgin. By the 23rd, things were clearing up and training, including formation flying and air-to-air gunnery resumed in earnest. This carried over into the 24th when the programme was expanded to include some R/P splash practice (likely with the new R/P set-ups – TH).\n\nThe first words in the ORB for 25 November 1944 carries a hint of sarcasm: “This is almost a record! Three fine days of flying now!” However, the 42 aircraft strong Wing effort that went out was actually thwarted by weather as it drew near to occupied Norwegian coast, and turned for home. Another fair weather day on the 26th saw a 22 aircraft strike mount up, take off, and return after finishing an uneventful patrol between Stavanger and Kristiansand (S).\n\nThe squadron diarist wrote “The weather was fair all day.” as his entry opener for 27 November 1944. Detailed to attack an M/V reported to be in Sula Fjord, F/L SS Shulemson DSO led a force of 10 Beaufighters (six from 404 and four from 489 Squadron) that made landfall at the Svinoy Light. The target, which was supposed to be in Sula Fjord, was nowhere to be found but they discovered an alternate nearby – a small convoy of two large M/Vs with three escorts. Interestingly, in its account of the ensuing combat, the ORB refers to aircraft “N” (which should have been Bundy’s NE800) being the first in to attack one of the escorts. However, this aircraft is not listed in the appropriate column on the two 27 November pages, while NE339 EE•U is not called out in any of the Details of Sortie or Flight column, which accounts for all other aircraft. Therefore, one is left to assume that the “N” referred to was actually “U” with the diarist perhaps associating the Bundy and Wright crew with “N” at some point in his typing! Whichever aircraft he was in, it seems that F/O Allan Bundy fired the opening shots in this particular battle. His R/P all overshot (perhaps an indication of his using the new, flatter trajectory rounds for the first time in battle?) but his cannon gunnery registered multiple superstructure hits. While the ships company dealt with the consequences, R/P “ace” Shulemson, brought NV177 EE•Z to bear on the same vessel, scoring 4 dry and 4 wet R/P hits. By the time they egressed the target area, the “leading E/V [escort vessel] was well on fire and low in the water, and the larger M/V was smoking to some extent.” Two Buffaloes came home with flak damage while the strike leaders aircraft suffered an engine failure just of the Norwegian coast. Shulemson, ever the cool and collected airman nursed the Beaufighter back to friendly skies to a successful landing at Sumburgh with NT890 EE•F as escort. The main group all landed at Dallachy after an average of just over five hours each in the air.\n\nA few scrubbed missions, an air test that featured a runaway airscrew and subsequent successful crash-landing on the airfield, and some firing practice – both cannon and R/P consumed the remaining days of November 1944. The start to December was not much different. More planned ops cancelled due to local weather or to the met report on the target area, more R/P practice, and the usual business of maintenance air tests, and a funeral for the crew of a Canadian Halifax that crashed nearby.\n\nFinally 5 December dawned with cold but clear skies and just after noon Shulemson (in NE669 EE•A) led twelve Buffaloes to accompany a similar number of 144 Squadron Beaufighters on an A/S patrol of the Norwegian coast. The patrol was completed without enemy contact. Two squadron aircraft separated on the return leg to escort an limping Beaufighter from another force into Sumburg. All others, including Bundy with Elliott as nav aboard NT916 EE•S, and Jones with Wright in “their” NE800, were back at Dallachy by 1725, having spent an average of five hours aloft.\n\nBundy wasn’t along the next day when the OC, W/C Pierce, led a force of 15 Dallachy Strike Wing Beaufighters (six from 404), together with Mustang escorts and Mosquito outriders picked up at Banff on an A/S patrol. After one of the outriders found a target anchored in Sor Vaagsoy, the force tried to set up a coordinated attack from seaward, but intense flak from several directions at once within the particularly narrow fjord foiled the effort. A Mustang and a 489 Beaufighter went missing while all others made it back to base.\n\nAfter this things really started to pick up. Reunited with usual his navigator and kite, F/O Allan Bundy was part of a really Big Do heading out from Dallachy and Banff to strike shipping in Allesund Harbour on 7 December. With S/L WR Christison DFC as leader, the 40 Beaufighter strong Dallachy element was to concentrate on the shipping, following the smaller Banff Strike Wing Mosquito force into the target while their escort of 12 Long Range Mustangs (out of Peterhead) were to tie up the Luftwaffe fighter force expected from nearby Gossen Airfield. Sure enough, some 25 Messerschmitts and Focke Wulfs rose to the occasion but the escort was ready for them. In the ensuing melee, the Mustangs claimed 6 destroyed and 2 probables for the loss of one of their own. And still some of the German fighters made it through to the strike group. Two Mosquitoes and a 489 Squadron Beau were lost to enemy fire. Flynn’s S/404 was hit by Bf109 cannon fire and Michaels, his navigator, received minor wounds when one round exploded in the cupola. He made for Sumburg and landed there with two squadron mates as escort. The rest made for home, deprived of their target by the Gossen fighter force. It was a long haul. Some had as little as 10 gallons of fuel remaining by the time they shut down. Bundy and Wright had their first close encounter with enemy fighter aircraft.\n\nOn 9 December the Wing sent a strike force comprising 23 Beaufighters from 144, 404, and 489 Squadrons to the Utvaer area. The force picked up its Mustang escort from Peterheads’s 315 Squadron on the way out. Amongst the nine 404 aircraft led by F/L HL Wainman, Bundy and Wright were in NE800 once again. Soon an “unescorted M/V in the 1000 ton class” [sic] was located and the attack went in. The vessel was saturated with 8 dry hits, 2 possible dry, and 22 wet R/P hits. Six of the Buffaloes also attacked with cannon and five of those made two passes. Sadly the inexperienced crew of Cooper and Smith, who had been with the squadron less than a month, were lost within the first wave. Reading between the lines of the ORB entry for the day, it would seem that their rockets did not fire. One could speculate that the young pilot may have busied himself momentarily trying to figure out why, and took his eyes off of the outside world for a split second too long. Still considered new, but with the number of combat experience nonetheless, Allan Bundy was one of the more successful attackers. As the marauding Beaus departed, the M/V was left ablaze from bridge to stern and racked with explosions. A half hour later it was found beached and burning fiercely by a recce aircraft. Later intelligence identified the vessel as the 687-ton Havda, a Norwegian coaster.\n\nThis mixture of sadness and success was to be 404s last combat operation of 1944. On the 10th, the Squadron was released for training; formation flying in the morning and fam trips for two new crews as well as an air test on which Z/404s forward bottom hatch came loose and chopped three inches off of a starboard prop blade. Weather turned back an afternoon A/S patrol on the 11th and a morning one on the 12th returned due to a lack of suitable targets. Similarly, after determining that a potential target was a Red Cross vessel a Rover to Svinoy Light area returned without incident on 13 December. Bundy was along for the next “no joy” trip on the 14 th; his first op in nearly a week. They left Dallachy on this “cloudy day with a feeling of snow in the air”. Before the force broke off the patrol, he was detailed to provide navigation escort to a troubled Mustang and landed at Milltown at 1520. Another 3 hours and 35 minutes logged. Meanwhile, crosswinds were so bad at Dallachy that the rest of the force had to land at Banff. The next day, despite ominous cloud and strong winds many Buffalo aircraft were in the air. Everybody who had landed out the day before returned home to Dallachy while another strike went out just after noon, only to be turned back by weather before reaching the target area. December 16 had the airfield socked in by “very windy and wet” weather to the extent that there was no flying. Dances were held in both the NCOs’ and Officers’ messes with full attendance. On the 17th, a number of promotions came through and Bundy’s navigator, Flight Sergeant Wright, became one of three newly commissioned officers on squadron. The “turned back due to bad weather theme” featured in the ORB entries detailing sorties launched on the 18th and 19th. Flying Officer Bundy and Pilot Officer Wright were aloft in trusty old NE800 for the latter. Meanwhile the much respected and talented R/P expert S/L SS Shulemson DSO was posted out to a new job at RAF Station Banff on the 18th. With a cancelled op “due to unfavourable met reports” on 20th, the squadron spent the day formation flying and on air tests. Personnel also sent confections from their personal Christmas parcels to some 75 children at Spey Bay School. The next day no ops were on and the weather was typically duff. Thus released for training the Buffaloes kept busy with formation flying practice, R/P practice, and air tests. This activity continued on the 22nd as the weather improved over Dallachy but remained untenable in the usual target areas.\n\nWith a “cool, clear” sky over the airfield 23 December started out with the promise of activity. S/L RA Schoales DFC in NT991 EE•E led 10 Buffaloes aloft with the first take-off at 0715. The Bundy/Wright crew was present in NE686 EE•T. They were accompanied by nine other Beaus from the Dallachy Wing’s 144 Squadron along with a 333 Squadron Mosquito outrider and an ASR (Airborne Search and Rescue) Warwick out of Banff. Despite an organized search in the Itteroene – Stadlandet area, Drem markers laid out by the Warwick, and an independent Rover by two 404 aircraft, nothing was found and all, except one, returned to base after four and a half hours in the air. The one was Y/404 who became separated in the soup trying to locate the Drem and not finding it, wisely set course for home.\n\nChristmas Day 1944 dawned to a fine morning and the Squadron was released from 1100 to 2359. The officers served two sittings of Christmas dinner at 1200 and 1300 as rain showers developed outside. The festivities, as they were, continued into the afternoon when free issue candy, chocolate bars, and cigarettes at the base’s newly established Canada House and later onwards to the Flights’ crew room where ground and aircrew mingled.\n\nAnother op was on for Boxing Day. F/L HL Wainman led nine Buffaloes in company with 12 other Dallachy Wing Beaus and an ASR Warwick on an early morning patrol. They searched the Norge coast from Feisten Light to Okso. Although shipping was sighted in Kristiansand (S) Harbour, the position was determined to be less than ideal for attacking aircraft so they left it alone and landed back after a five hour trip. Later in the afternoon (1400) three Buffaloes accompanied a larger force from the Wing’s other squadrons on a no joy patrol between Egero and Songvaar. Although the next day was considered “fine… although somewhat cloudy”, flying was limited to training hops and air tests.\n\nAfter an overnight snowfall that rebated to gentle flakes in the morning of 28 December, 404 Squadron contributed 12 aircraft to a 26 aircraft strike force out of Dallachy. Picking up 2 Mosquito outriders and 2 ASR Warwicks out of Banff and 6 of Peterhead’s 315 Squadron Mustangs [the ORB mistakenly identifies them as Mosquitoes) staging from Banff the force set out across the North Sea to make landfall at Holmengraa. Patrolling north they found no enemy shipping and returned to base. Bundy and Wright logged another four and a half hour operational flight in NE800. They were up again the very next day for a Rover of similar duration. They made the coast but weather turned them back sometime into their patrol. There was no operational flying on the 30th. Released for training, two new crews were taken up for local flying familiarization and others did some formation flying. The last day of 1944 was a mild one with ops on the board. 404 Squadron contributed nine (a tenth launched but returned almost immediately with electrical problems) Beaus led by F/L JD Taylor in “The Ancient Mariner” (see LZ451 EE•M above). With a potential target turning out to be four neutral Swedish M/Vs, the force returned without incident.\n\nSquadron Operations – 1945\n\nAlthough he may have participated in some training flights in the interim, Bundy flew his last operational sortie of 1944 on the 28th. He and Wright participated in only two ops through January 1945. A mishap on the first of these may have had something to do with their limited involvement.\n\nAboard NE800 EE•N as (almost) always, they were part of a determined A/S patrol effort 6 January. Taking off into weather described as “mild, cloudy…” six Buffaloes formed up with 20 other aircraft, including an escort of 12 Mustangs from Peterhead’s 315 Squadron and a 279 Squadron ASR Warwick from Wick. Soon after making the Norge coast at Helliso Light in deteriorating weather a self-propelled barge was attacked by a single Buffalo Beau and three from 455 Squadron. T/404 claimed 2 dry and 3 possible wet hits plus numerous cannon strikes. The target was last seen drifting without power towards the shore. The weather continued to worsen as other larger vessels were spotted. “Snow squalls prevented attack” as noted in the diary. After making their way back to Helliso Light, apparently in singles and pairs, the strike force set course for home. B/404 who had returned an hour after take-off due to electrical failure, along with H/404 and L/404 made it back to Dallachy. G/404 landed at Lossiemouth while N/404 – Bundy’s aircraft – accompanied T/404 into Milltown. They had taken off from Dallachy between 1315 and 1327 in the afternoon. By the time they arrived over Milltown darkness was setting in. Rancourt (in T/404) landed at 1740 and Bundy at 1814. Although scattered, everybody had made it back to airfields along the Morayshire and Spey Bay coast. Rancourt returned to Dallachy but “’N’ was found to be have been slightly damaged on landing so did not return.” Beaufighter NE800s Form 78 shows a FB Cat AC for 8 or 9 January 1945 (depending on how you read the this particular aircraft movement card), a repair on site at Milltown commencing 12 January, and a return to 404 Squadron at Dallachy on 16 February. And though she stayed with the squadron until they converted to Mosquitoes, she did not fly as frequently, at least not on operations, as before.\n\nMeanwhile the squadron went on to fly additional successful ops on 8, 9, and 10 January. For the balance of the month, when not pitching in manpower to help clear the massive amount of snow at Dallachy mid-month, they were busy planning and launching strikes only to be confronted with bad weather or, except for some flak thrown at them every now and then, the nonappearance of the enemy. With NE800 still in the hands of the Bristols (the company which originated the Beaufighter) within the civilian repair organization, Flying Officers Bundy and Wright reappear in the ORB for the last op of the month flying Beaufighter NE687 EO•B (Squadron codes had changed from “EE” to “EO” earlier in January). With F/O JR “Roj” Savard heading up the nine aircraft 404 Squadron element, a Wing effort of 26 Dallachy Beaus rendezvoused with their escort of 65 Squadron Mustangs from Peterhead and an ASR Warwick out of Wick headed out across the North Sea to make landfall at Stadlandet. The weather made for very bad visibility and the strike leader called it a day. All of the Buffaloes made it back okay but one of the Mustangs went missing and a 144 Squadron Beaufighter ditched off of Sumburgh.\n\nFebruary also came and went with only a small number of operational sorties recorded for Allan Bundy. He and Wright made three uneventful trips; the first and second were in NV291 EO•H on the 5th and 15th while the third was in NV427 EO•L on the 21st. All were uneventful due to either weather or the lack of suitable targets. Meanwhile, the squadron had suffered its darkest day – known by all Buffaloes as Black Friday – on 9 February when six of its Beaufighters, together with four aircraft from other units, failed to return. All were brought down by either flak or Luftwaffe fighters over the target in Førde Fjord. One of the downed 404 pilots, the ever-jovial “Roj” Savard, survived both the shootdown and POW camp.\n\nWhile starting out highly variable, the weather tried its best to improve daily throughout March 1945. As it improved squadron activity started to pick up. Early in the month it, and presumably others of the Dallachy Strike Wing, made unorthodox (for a Coastal Command Strike unit) night patrols employing lone aircraft. While no positive concrete results – which were measured in tonnage sunk in the strike squadrons – were claimed, some dry hits were documented. One can only imagine that the sudden appearance of a rocket firing, cannon barking Beaufighter coming directly at you against the night sky had some effect on the morale of Kriegsmarine and merchant seamen alike. All the while sensing that there was a steadily decreasing number of ships navigating the Norwegian coast to feed industrial raw material into a collapsing Nazi Germany. These sorties went to handpicked navigation-savvy crews like S/L “Bobby” Schoales DFC and F/L Jackson (nav) who, at 2203, launched the first of the four coordinated Lone Wolves that went out 2 March 1945.\n\nAlthough they had been gaining experience both on operations and in ongoing practice flying, like many others the crew of Bundy and Wright stuck with traditional daylight operations. Reunited with NE800 (now marked as EO•N) they took off at 1448 in the afternoon of 13 March as one of eight Buffaloes led by F/O Coyne. They headed east towards Sandoy together with 19 other Dallachy Strike Wing Beaus. McCallan and Cook in Z/404, armed with cannon only, filled the outrider role in the absence of a Norwegian-manned 333 Squadron Mosquito. Sniffing ahead after the force made landfall, they reported a lack of targets and worsening weather so, minus one of their number, the force set course for home and landed without incident. The one was N/404. She developed engine trouble early on and Bundy had her back safely on the ground at Dallachy by 1524. A very short hop indeed.\n\nEngine problem solved, the crew’s next trip out as part of a larger force on 17 March was also in NE800. After patrolling the coast for a bit between Stadlandet and Storholm Light the weather worsened enough for the strike leader to call it off. Another uneventful trip but just a minute under five and a half hours logged nonetheless.\n\nOn 23 March, 40 Dallachy Strike Wing Beaus (including 8 Buffaloes) sortied to attack shipping in Allesund Harbour. Going overland just above the haze after making landfall at Itteroerne the entire force missed its mark and came out at Haried. A few aircraft “attacked a few small boats in error” but they all returned without seeing the actual target. The force was accompanied by an RAF Film Production Unit (FPU) Mosquito which, no doubt, had to limit its recording to the picturesque ingress over the hazy yet rugged Norwegian terrain. One aircraft developed an unspecified serviceability issue while still over the North Sea. Bundy (with Wright in NV183 EO•P) was thus detailed to accompany C/404 (Bedell and Campanella in NT985) back to Sumburgh. The troubled aircraft landed at the Shetland Islands base at 1520 and Bundy recovered to Dallachy 35 minutes later.\n\nThe next day, even in the midst of a squadron move back to Banff, the Buffaloes still managed to contribute six aircraft, including the strike leader, to a full Wing effort of 28 Beaufighters on a shipping strike to Egersund Harbour. Once in the target area the strike leader, S/L WR Christison, DFC and Bar, spearheaded the first wave and was hit. After communicating his predicament, to cue his second to take over the strike, his aircraft (NV428 EO•R) was seen to ditch successfully. A survivor was spotted in a dinghy. The guys in the air presumed this to be “Chris”, since he’d reported that Toon (his navigator) had been wounded. A second flak-stricken 404 Squadron aircraft with the relatively inexperienced F/O LR Aljoe and F/S CE Orser crew aboard came down nearer the coast. Both made it to the dinghy and were waving as the force departed the area. Oddly enough, their aircraft was the very one Christison had survived Black Friday in, NE339 EO•U. F/O Bundy had flown this aircraft on several occasions as well. However, on this day he was flying a new “big tailed” Beau – RD421 EO•V. Given that all six of 404’s aircraft went in on the first wave, it can be assumed that some of his R/P had found their mark, for all six vessels present were left either smoking or burning and the largest M/V was seen to explode. The squadron’s other Beaufighter with the redesigned tail, RD427 EO•O, received flak damage. Two aircraft from the other participant squadrons also went missing on this strike.\n\nSo ended the Buffaloes last combat operation on the Beaufighter. Christison, “A” Flight commander, had been near the end of his second tour. He had joined the squadron at the same time as the other WOMs (wise old men), W/C Pierce, S/L Schoales DFC, and F/L Bolli about four years prior. Toon, his navigator was also a second tour veteran. Aljoe and Orser were at the other end of the scale with only a couple of operational trips. None of the downed airmen were ever seen again.\n\nMeanwhile the squadron was dividing its time and resources between Dallachy and Banff where a cohort was already in place to organize squadron facilities and accept their new aircraft; the deHavilland Mosquito FB.VI. Within 18 Group, which oversaw all Coastal Command activity in the north of Scotland, it was envisioned that Banff would specialize in Mosquito operations and Dallachy, Beaufighters. From a logistics standpoint it made perfect sense. In fact this was the reasoning behind the Buffaloes move the other way back in October, for the transition was already underway amongst other units at Banff. Now the Buffaloes were returning as the newest Mosquito squadron within the massive Banff Strike Wing. Even as the final Buffalo Beaufighter combat ensued over Egersund Harbour the ground crews of 404 Squadron and 8404 Servicing Echelon were a day into their technical training on the Mosquito. That morning the first of the aircrews, already bussed to Banff, commenced ground instruction. The OC, after flying two pilots into Banff on the 29th and returned to Dallachy to report that the first Mosquito had arrived. Two more came in the next day and conversion flying started on the 31st. By 3 April 1945 all personnel and most of the technical servicing equipment belonging to the Squadron and Echelon had been moved. by the 6th conversion flying was in full swing with nine crews up, while a few servicing personnel detached to Dallachy to service Beaufighters not yet reallocated. A “no absentees” aircrew-hosted, groundcrew-invited Officers and NCOs party in the Ops Canteen came after a day of intense Mosquito flying. It comprised three dozen individual sorties in all; 35 conversion exercise flights and an air test. With rare exception, this level of activity kept up until 404 Squadron could declare itself operational on 21 April 1945. This was accomplished without either the benefit of dual control trainers (i.e. the Mosquito T.III) or the advent of accidents. The conversion syllabus was made up of nine distinct exercises, which could be completed, one assumes ideally, over 20 flying hours. All of the 404 Squadron crews, experienced Beau men as they were, came through without a hitch. Presumably F/O Bundy and P/O Wright logged at least 20 training hours on the type through the better part of April.\n\nMosquito\n\nCommencing on the 22nd, 404 Squadron documented four operational missions on its new aircraft through the remainder of April. On the first one, Catrano and Foord carried out a morning shipping recce in RF851 EO•H. Snooping eastward along the south Norwegian coast they came upon one each Bv138 and He115 seaplanes at their Ksevik moorings some 200 feet offshore. They swooped in and hammered the Bv138, leaving as quickly as they came through intermittent flak. The black smoke, still visible from 40 miles away, marked the Buffaloes first Mosquito victory. McCallan and Cook used the same aircraft when they sortied on a similar recce at 0425 the next morning and retuned at 0750 after an uneventful trip to the Naze area. On the morning of the 24th the OC, W/C Pierce led four cannon and machine-gun armed (i.e. devoid of R/P) 404 Squadron Mossies as fighter cover to 31 other Mosquitoes of the Banff Strike Wing. When near the target area “Bad weather… prevented the formation from completing their patrol.” F/Os Gibbard and Burns flew a successful recce in RF842 EO•C on the morning of 26 April. Encountering “considerable flak” along the way they discovered multiple targets in a number of harbours and fjords and communicated the information to the inbound Dallachy Wing force, which carried out a successful attack: A fitting close to a busy month.\n\nThe squadron continued to enhance its Mosquito proficiency into early May as the weather tried to make up its mind between snow and rain, cloud and wind. All the while ops were still mounted. On the 2nd Catrano and Foord flew a flak-dotted lone Rover to the Naze environs, sighted several vessels but were forced to abandon the rest of their patrol due to weather. Earlier in the morning four Buffaloes provided fighter cover, together with 24 Mustangs out of Peterhead, to a strike force of 35 Banff Strike Wing Mosquitoes detailed to attack U-boats that intel had as moving north in the Kattegat. They and their minesweeper escort were found and duly attacked. R/404 returned due to drop tank trouble while the other three stayed above the action, as fighter cover should, and watched the melee unfold below.\n\nThe first R/P endowed mission for 404 launched with eleven Mosquitoes joining a massive evening strike force of 72 aircraft detailed to attack shipping in Kiel Bay on 3 May. A navigation error and poor visibility led to the mission being scrubbed while R/404, accidentally separated from the main force had a fleeting no-shots-fired encounter with a Ju188. Notably, all a/c had drop tank troubles on this outing.\n\nThe first successful R/P use by 404 Squadron Mosquitoes on operations occurred the next day. On the afternoon of the 4th W/C Pierce led six other 404 Squadron aircraft as part of a 41 Mosquito strike to the same area. All but two of the Buffaloes (those being tasked as fighter escorts) were armed with R/P. X/404 – the OC’s aircraft – and Q/404 attacked an R-boat enroute with R/P claiming 12 dry hits total. Joined by D/404 and M/404 they came back around and attacked with cannon, leaving the “vessel a mass of burning debris”. A convoy of seven vessels was encountered and attacked a short time later. After severely mauling these vessels and leaving the scene a ship towing a U-boat was sighted and attacked. With the exception of A/404 which returned early with drop tank trouble, and the two tasked with fighter cover, all R/P armed 404 aircraft fired their ordnance.\n\nWith victory not too far off and a real sense of it in the air, and with inclement weather threatening on the North Sea horizon from time to time, there was not much operational flying activity between 4 and 12 May 1945. Halfway along, V-E Day was official and the entire RAF Station Banff was released for the day. Either side of that training and skill sharpening wore on. Aircrew continued to be posted in and out. The admin types busied themselves with mountains of paperwork, the repat ship HMCS Buffalo – a single masted behemoth made up of three empty Mossie 100gal. drop tanks and fueled by various spirits – was launched, and effigies of Hitler and Goering were burned at the celebration bonfire stake."
