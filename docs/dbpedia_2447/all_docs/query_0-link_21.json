I was overwhelmed. Thank you. TENNIS TEAM PHOTOGRAPH - DISTRIBUTED APRIL 10 2013 Ian McCullough (RhAF) Writes:- My guess is they are the Solomon twins – if memory serves. Miles Cartwright via Malcolm Baillie (RhAF) Writes:- The names you were looking for are Brian and Alan Solomon, twin younger brothers of Frank Solomon. Bill Sykes (RhAF) Writes:- The unknowns are the Solomon (sp) brothers, both Rhodesian tennis players. Sammy Symes will tell you their names Danny Hartman (RhArmy) Writes:- Back row extreme right I think is Frank Solomon who went on to play for Rhodesia. I was at school with him and don’t recall him having a brother!! Trevor Smith (RhAF) Writes:- The two unknowns in the Tennis Team photo are the Solomon brothers – Alan and Brian but I can’t remember which is which. Their elder brother Frank was at the same time seeded No1 tennis player in Rhodesia and these two were rated about 3 and 4. Great to have them drafted to Air Force for National Service – if I remember rightly that was a team that was put together to play Thornhill in the 60’s – with those two one might say the New Sarum team was loaded. I remember many great games with them whilst serving at FAF2 – we would go to the school in Kariba with “Legs” Linnell (another TF and fine 1st League player). On one occasion we four were invited to play at Kariba Breezes – on arrival we found our game had been advertised as an exhibition by Rhodesia’s top players. My tennis was never in their class but they managed to keep feeding the ball to me on my best side to make me look good in front of the large crowd of Kariba folk and visitors. Was a fine day and the free beer after was special. Ted Barnard (RhAF) Writes:- The two in the back row are twins. They were TF’s in the Security Section, sorry but cannot remember their names, for some unknown reason, I think it could have been Solomon. Miles Orbell (RhAF) Writes:- Diggers, John Digby I chatted to him last year when I was in the UK, but unfortunately didn’t have time to go and see him, he was involved with us in MK Airlines for a long time, and I saw him fairly often, he also did a lot of our Ground School in 31 PTC, when we were still Cadets. Terry Bennett (RhAF) Writes:- I think the “unknowns” are the Solomon boys – maybe twins. However it is just a guess. Sammy Symes (RhAF) Writes:- Two guys in the back row are the Salomon twins. Alan and Brian. They had an elder brother who played Davis Cup for Rhodesia. Brian and Alan were doing National Service. I recall John Pinner played with one of the twins, I played with the other, in an exhibition set (Alan and Brian gave the exhibition) John and I just made up the four, to open the new All-weather courts at New Sarum. The photograph was taken at Sarum . Incidentally, I ruptured an Achilles Tendon a month or so ago, playing tennis in the snow. Will be in plaster for next 3 months, On My 80th last year I played squash at 8 am, tennis at 3 pm, and table tennis in the evening, it was just something I wanted to do! No chance of repeating last year next month! Perhaps at 81 time to hang up my racquet\\'s)!! Doctor said he had never treated anyone of 80 with a ruptured Achilles Tendon, normally happens to those between 30 and 50! By the same token he had never heard of anyone of 80 playing tennis either! Only fools and horses! Alan Harris (RhAF) Writes:- The two unknowns in the back row look like the Salomon brothers; Alan and Brian. Brian was on 54 TF Intake, I think. Ox Heron (RhAF) Writes:- The two youngsters were the Solomon’s T.F Refer. http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=1115578&comments=1 KEN SALTER NEWS Ken (RhAF) Writes:- I have just received my latest RAFA magazine and found among the book reviews one relating to \\\" Devotion to a calling\\\" by Grp Capt Harley Boxall and Joe Bamford. I quote \\\" The book is based on Harley Boxall\\'s memoirs written in 1948\\\"It also states that Harley reverted to Sqn Ldr at the end of the war and joined the Rhodesian Air Force as a Flt Lt. The book costs 19.99 through WWW.pen-and-sword.co.uk. I well remember going to lunches with Harley and Jack Wall when I was taking over as SO.Sec.VR PASSING OF JIM FRASER Reply from Saillie Hammond regarding the notification ORAFs distributed recently:- Very interesting story indeed about Jim Fraser. My husband\\'s late uncle, Leonard Dally, from Kimberley, serving with the South African Regiment was captured by the Germans after the Battle of Sidi Rezegh. Leonard, with the rest of his regiment, was sent to a POW camp in Italy. He managed to escape to the Vatican and spent the remaining part of the war under the disguise of a \\\"Father Sharkey\\\"- Irish Catholic priest! On seeing a German soldier in the streets of Rome and not knowing any Italian or Latin- Leonard would rush into the nearest church crossing himself saying \\\"eenie-meenie-minee-mo\\\"- please God make the Germans go\\\"! He remained safe in the Vatican until the end of the war. There is a picture of \\\"Father Sharkey\\\" in a family album-- clerical collar and black habit-- dressed for the part. CANDIDATE FOR ROGUES GALLERY Bruce Harrison, Ted Barnard and Ian McCullough agree the person was Terry Wall of Radio Section Ian thinks he was 11 or 12 LAR but ORAFs reflects him has 103 Entry in 1963. COMBINED SERVICES TENNIS TEAM Colin Castle (RhArmy) Writes:- The missing name is that of Peter Hean. I cant remember if his surname has an e at the end or not! Stan Standish-White (RhArmy) Writes:- Long shot but...could back right gent be Peter Hean, RLI Dick Lockley (RhArmy) Writes:- The unknown in the top right corner is Peter Hean who when the photo was taken would have been a lieutenant in the RLI. This must have been sometime in the early to mid- 70’s I imagine. Hickman, Walls and Rowley have passed on; Colin Castel lives in Ireland now, Peter Hean in Durban and you will know where Roy (I think PE?) and Hoffie live. So good to see the old faces as we remember them! Thanks for your continued news briefs- always received daily with great interest. Pete Simmonds (RhAF) Writes:- I think back right is Pete Hean. Terry Griffin (RhE) Writes:- The “unknown” is Pete Hean – not sure of the date though Refer. http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=1115637&comments=1 FAF DUTIES (PHOTOGRAPH) Bonnie Wainwright (Garrett) (RhAF) Writes:- I’ve forwarded this photo to Dad in the hope he may be able to give you a date and some names. Dad only joined the Rhodesian Air force in early 1969. I known he spent some time early that year in training before going to 5 Sqn, so this must be late 1969 or into the 1970’s. Thanks for adding it was great to see Dad in the photo. Ron Jarman (RhAF) Writes:- Front row centre is Barry Ord (instrument Basher) Wally Wallace (RhAF) Writes:- The gent holding the beer bottle was the late Barry Thompson. (ORAFs agrees with this identification) Bob Hattle (RhAF) Writes:- Back row right looks very much like Jim Light. Refer. http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=1115568&comments=1 22 PTC PHOTOGRAPH John du Plessis (RhAF) Writes:- The one 2 Sqdn guy on the left is definitely Roger Watt, he was my flying instructor in 1979 when I learnt to fly at Charles Prince, won\\'t forget him! Refer. http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=213427&comments=1 CECIL HOTEL GWELO Phillip Evans (Writes:- The Cecil hotel was still running in 1983 when I left Gwelo (Gweru). The owners were a couple called Bob and Rose, and they left to take over the Lion & Elephant at Bubye on the Beit bridge - Ft Vic road. the Cecil Hotel was still showing on Google Earth in June 2011. The only thing is that its name has changed to Chitukuko Hotel. It is still listed as one of the hotels to stay at if you are in Gweru. I lived in Gwelo from 1973 - 1984. The other hotels/motels in Gwelo were the Midlands hotel and the Fairmile Motel. Refer/ http://rhodesianadvertisements.blogspot.com/2013/03/cecil-hotel-gwelo.html MISSING PERSONS Veronica Attwell Writes:- Syd Wheeler said to contact you--- I have been asked by someone researching a family tree for any information about Gwelo/Gweru 1930’s. Among the info needed was about –B Company 2nd Battalion (Gwelo) Troop—John Arthur Dryden Dymond who was in Gwelo from 1933/38 & seemed to be involved in a voluntary army reserve doing exercises with the mentioned Co. He also mentions Enzo Mess, perhaps also associated with this. Any help would be appreciated or perhaps you could put me on to someone who might be able to. Thank you very much.

I would like to close this method as it is tedious and time consuming but - I need the help of those currently receiving their mail n that manner. The move will be to a mail server listing, but they do not permit anyone to add names to the listing. The list Manager has to forward an invitation to interested parties and they must accept the invitation. This alleviates the old cry \\\"I never asked to be on your list\\\" If you receive the invitation then be assured you are one that is due for transfer. This also is applicable to changing email addresses, I need both your old and new address. The operation is easy, when you receive the invitation be aware you are one that I want to move, ensure you are on line, accept the invitation and once you have been advised that you have been listed please advise me as per the instruction in the invitation. Please note the invitation has a time period before it expires. A few days only. One other request please. I receive email from our members and the email address is some think like prettyboy@ISP They do not give any other detail on the email so it is up to me to try and establish who has written.

I joined in January 1963 as an apprentice ground radar fitter, 103rd Entry RAF Locking, then was in the Radio Section at both Thornhill and New Sarum, but by the time of this photo (about 1979 or so) I was at Air HQ, programming computers.

A ‘real’ tennis player was unable to attend at the last minute and I was ordered to take his place. I did so very reluctantly as I was a total ‘rabbit’ at tennis, squash being preferred by me. I recall that I lost all my games and think that we were soundly beaten by the opposition. The unknown player is Pete Hean, then a major in the RLI.

Davidson D.M, RRAF VR Sarum and 24289 Stick Leader BSAP C Reserve I joined RRAF VR in 1963 and was based at Air Force HQ, Salisbury. My job related to setting up records of all VR members living in Rhodesia ... this followed the break up of Federation. Later I moved to New Sarum where I assisted with admin duties. Eventually became scribe to Squadron Leader H L Maltas VR at all his group meetings, recording minutes, and organising Coin training movies for members of 101 Squadron. Eventually did 7 week call up duties in Operation Hurricane where we were involved in mapping TTL (Tribal Trust Lands) areas, where all records had been destroyed, during the day and ambush detail at night aiding the RAR unit based in the area. In 1976 I transferred to the BSAP \\\"C\\\" Reserve and continued with regular call up duties in various Operation areas until 1980 when I resigned.

A while back some of my personal items surfaced in the UK and they sent them on to me. It was used in the Pride of Eagles book as well. We can only hope. Obviously it will be under Sgt Buchan. Replies to Charlie on denis.underberg@gmail.com OUR SINGING AIRMEN Tony Smith (RhAF) Writes:- Recent news from Peter Shout from Rhodie Music: Had a wonderful email from PETE BADENHORST of ESTABLISHMENT and NEW ESTABLISHMENT fame. Having survived being shot in 2000 in a crime incident at his home in South Africa, he and his wife emigrated to the United Kingdom where he joined old colleague, Moss Hills, in a music shop he had opened – STAGEBEAT. After two years of the inclement British weather, the Badenhorsts were on their way again, this time to sunny Spain where they bought a pub on Majorca. This, as you can imagine, was quite a lively venue with lots of good, old fashioned, bonhomie and live music. It seemed, however, that other establishments (excuse the pun!) took a disliking to the Badenhorsts’ success and their live music licence was revoked, effectively destroying their business. The wheel then turned full circle and Pete returned to Johannesburg where he landed a management position with a well know musical instrument shop. Pete has a hectic gigging schedule, playing every week, during the week and at weekends, and has built up a formidable reputation for himself. When not gigging in pubs he can be found at weddings, clubs or celebratory events. He says with pride that he has “now been playing for 52 years and can’t do without it”. I’m sure many of us know THAT feeling! Pete also provided a comprehensive update on his past band mates, Paul Stromsoe who sadly passed away in 2001, Roger Cowling who is retired in the UK and Steve “Lofty” Hughes who, after moving to Australia and back again and surviving an extremely serious car accident, is residing in Natal. He apparently landed in gig in January 2013 for three months playing aboard a cruise liner plying the East Coast of South Africa (while the rest of us work!).

Same size etc as Aden shells but would not work in the because of the electric firing in the Aden Gun - no contact because of the paint. Two railway trucks full of the stuff sitting in the siding. Virtually every armourer at Thornhill was called in, even the chiefy\\'s were helping. Seem to vaguely remember some of the guys from Sarum were also called in to help. Cant remember but think Bertie May was in charge of the Armoury at that stage. (Sgt on my early TF call ups, looked after all of us TF armourers at Thornhill, funny to go back years later to find he was now [Flt Lt ?] OC Armoury Thornhill ) Be nice if you could ask if anyone can recall the incident or any more details- just remember that 1 Squadron was critically short of ammo at the time.

I trust it is properly attributed to Colin and his craftsmanship.... Some time ago you published an article with pics about Brick Bryson flying the Harrier in the RAF. We also have living in retirement in SA, Commander Andy Auld RN who commanded the Harrier Strike Force during the Falklands conflict. I also had a look at the Transatlantic Air Race and found the following on Wiki: interesting that it was an \\\"individual entrant\\\" competition - the number of well-known names is amazing! There is also a log of all the entrants, aircraft and times. \\\" The race was held between the 4 and 11 May 1969, although named an air race it was actually a race of individuals between the Empire State Building in New York to the Post Office Tower in London. Each of the individuals or \\\"Runners\\\" had to use some form of air transport. With a number of different categories a total of 21 prizes could be won. A number of point-to-point world records for aircraft were broken. The shortest overall time between London and New York was by Squadron Leader Tom Lecky-Thompson flying a Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Harrier in 6 hours 11 minutes. The shortest time between New York and London was by Lieutenant Commander Peter Goddard a passenger in a Royal Navy McDonnell Douglas Phantom in 5 hours 11 minutes. The first civilian competitor to leave London was Miss Anne Alcock the niece of Sir John Alcock, she was followed by a number of other runners including Stirling Moss, Mary Rand and Sheila Scott, who used her own private aircraft. The Royal Navy entered three \\\"runners\\\" each to be flown across the Atlantic in a McDonnell Douglas Phantom. The navy runners used Phantoms which flew from the Floyd Bennet Naval Air Station to Wisley Aerodrome and were refuelled by Handley Page Victor aerial tankers over the Atlantic. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisley_Airfield On 11 May 1969 a Royal Navy Phantom of 892 Naval Air Squadron set a new world air speed record between New York and London in 4 hours and 46 minutes. The Vickers Alcock and Brown trophy was awarded to Lieutenant Commander Peter Goddard for his 5 hour 11 minute crossing which was the fastest West to East crossing.\\\" Replies to orafs11@gmail.com ERROR IN DEATH NOTICE FOR BSAP MEMBER Peter Huson (BSAP) Writes:- A very minor correction to Iain Harper’s notification, but just for the record the surname was Symmons, not Simmonds.

Adolf Hitler declared that Germany had proved unworthy of him and committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945. Hitler\\'s successor, Admiral Karl Dnitz, started negotiations with the Western powers, hoping to save as many troops and refugees as possible from Soviet reprisals. But the U.S.S.R. refused to recognize the surrender ceremony at U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower\\'s headquarters on May 7 (the hostilities set to end at one minute past midnight May 9, 1945 - or 9:01pm Eastern on May 8 in the U.S.). A separate German surrender to the USSR was signed and a separate Soviet V-E Day held, in Berlin on May 8 to end the war once and for all.

About time this chaps received recognition. Jim Redmond - From the British Embassy Dublin Facebook page 9th May 2013 British Ambassador Dominick Chilcott was delighted to present a Bomber Command clasp to Dr Jim Redmond, resident of Leopardstown Park Hospital yesterday evening. Those eligible for the new Bomber Command clasp already hold the 1939 to 1945 Star, to which the clasp will be affixed. It is also understood that there is an additional requirement to have flown at least one operational sortie as aircrew on a Bomber Command operational unit. Talking about the medal, Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans Mark Francois said: “All those who served our country in Bomber Command and on the Arctic Convoys deserve nothing but the utmost respect and admiration from us. That’s why I am delighted that these special individuals will in the next few weeks begin to receive the Bomber Command clasp and Arctic Star that they have so long deserved.“I am also pleased to announce that the families of those no longer alive will also be able to apply for these awards in recognition of their loved one’s bravery.” Joan O’Neill (Secretary of the Veterans’ Support Group, Leopardstown Park Hospital), Dr Jim Redmond (recipient of Bomber Command clasp), David Cooney (nephew of Dr Jim), Kitty (another resident of LPH) And Jim with the Ambassador.

From my log book I see that I am one up on Geoff, having seen the inside of that aeroplane as well as the outside. My seven year spell with the Saudi Air Force started in Riyadh in 1966 and included in the early months the opportunity to fly the Hunters on an informal basis. It looks like I flew this particular one twice in October out of Riyadh and three times out of Taif in November. The King used to spend some of the hotter months at his summer palace in Taif so I guess we were involved in some sort of flag waving exercise. OP DINGO Bill Sykes (RhAF) Writes:- Ian Pringle’s letter mentioning Chiswiti airfield sparked a few visual memories ... The five or six Dakotas, and the Lynxes, were parked at the beginning of the runway, with 32 helicopters arranged sixteen a side down past the halfway mark. Any Dak taking off was watched with great interest, nay alarm, as its wingtips skimmed over the blades of the Alos. One swing on take-off and at least a dozen aircraft would have been written off.

DES PLUNKETT - GREAT ESCAPE MAPMAKER Mike McGeorge (Air Rhodesia) Writes:- Just reading about Des Plunkett, perhaps this may interest the older folk. My twin brother John and I met Des Plunkett and his crew at the Coq d,or, Baker Avenue one day in September 1951, he was with Hunting Air Survey and here on a contract to map the Kariba area. Their Dak was parked at Belvedere Airport. As we had an interest in photography from our experiences with the Brit army in Palestine, meeting the photographer, Vic Harding, who could assist us in setting up a dark room at our home, we jumped at Des ,s invite for us to go on a mapping operation over Kariba. Taking off from Belvedere one October day in their Dak, There were some oxygen bottles down the side of the fuselage, which they said we must use if necessary by sucking from a tube attached to the bottle, as we were flying over ten thousand feet AGL. Quite an experience, so started a long friend ship, often meeting for the odd drink etc., Vic sorted out our first dark room where we made our first print, which gave us the same feeling as going solo at the gliding club, which was on Thorn Park on the Mazoe Road. I remember attending a Royal Aero Society meeting where Des spoke about his experiences at Stalag Lift 111, the consequent escape in 1944, where Des made all the escape maps, which you can read about in the book the Great Escape. He was picked up by the Gestapo in Prague, but can\\'t remember how he got out of being shot like 50 of his colleagues. Des was very fond of Amirila cigars! I have a vague recollection that his co pilot was someone Campbell? I know he flew the Dove for Air Survey company for quite a time. I have a studio photo of him somewhere amongst my old prints. Very happy days, also flying from Belvedere in the Viking to Ft Jameson in Northern Rhodesia., as I was a tobacco buyer for Bindi Noakes, we were attending the NE sales where tobacco was off quota, consequently prices were very good, strip leaf going for 60 pence per pound! I think we needed an iron lung to get us back to normal on our return from a week in Fort Jimmy!!

A conjuring trick, virtually devoid of military significance...\\\" Ken Brown publicly declared in 1992 that the raid that \\\"the raid was not worthwhile and the loss of eight crews unjustified\\\".

The emotional video, which has gone viral, shows the men from 2nd and 1st Battalion Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment performing the ancestral war cry for Corporal Luke Tamata, 31, Lance Corporal Jacinda Baker, 26, and Private Richard Harris, 21. The dead comrades were killed by a roadside bomb while serving in Afghanistan. The ceremony at Burnham Military Camp two weeks ago showed the coffins arriving by car to be greeted by the mass of soldiers. The group then break into a huge emotionally-charged haka war dance, similar to ones displayed by the All Blacks rugby team. Major John Gordon, a spokesman for the NZ army, said: “Many soldiers don’t tend to show their emotions but today you saw their collective grief.” Visit. http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4510470/NZ-soldiers-perform-emotional-haka-for-fanormallen-comrades.html ORAFs records its thanks to the Sun (Wednesday) May 15, 2013 As Stretch says - This video is very stirring and certainly impressive – I think the dead silence at the end makes it all the more moving.

GROUND LOOP Tony Smit (RhAF) Writes:- HI Guys, From what I remember, Ed Paintin landed at Rushinga to drop off supplies for the SAP. There was a crosswind from the left on Runway 09? Plus the fact that the SAP/Army had some RL trucks parked on the left as well. So!!! When he has a right brake failure, the aircraft started swinging left, and in order to correct it he applied power to the left engine. Eventually, with not much runway left, he had to apply a lot of power to the left engine to groundloop the aircraft or run over the edge of the runway where there was quite a drop. The result was as we see it in the pictures. He was very lucky not to be killed, as, on the Dak if the prop hits the ground with power on, it shears off chopping up the LH pilot area. This can be seen in one of the photos. I don’t know if Ed has seen this on ORAFs yet, but maybe he can give the actual account? Eddy Norris (ORAFs) Writes:- Ed is very welcome, to send ORAFs his account, in actual fact it would be greatly appreciated. Chris Higginson Wrote to Gerry Cleveland (PRAW) as such:- Hi Gerry Thank you for forwarding this to me. What Chris Dams writes is correct and describes very well the forces involved, but a contributing factor is that people tried to fly the Dak according to the \\\"Book\\\", and that is where part of the problem lies. I had the privilege of flying the Dak with people like Scotty Fraser who I believe had somewhat over 12000 hours on Daks which included flying the Berlin Air Lift etc etc. as well as up and down Africa. 12000 hours is not equitable to the same time on modern jets where the legs are long, the landing aids and facilities are new and all the runways are hard surfaces!! Dak flying was always a way to separate the men from the boys. But back to landings. After I did the Air Rhodesia Dak course and route checks I flew with Scotty Fraser on my first line flight. It was from SAY FTV BFO FTV SAY. On the approach into FTV we had to use the secondary runway (short) as the longer one was under repair. I set the aircraft up as taught, which if I remember correctly was 80 Knots on the Approach and 65 over the fence (long time ago now). Scotty watched what I was doing and said, \\\"No, that\\'s not the way to fly the Dak. That\\'s the way Operations says to do it, but let me show you what you really should do!\\\" He took control and reduced the speed until there was no speed registering on the ASI. The Dak was sitting comfortably in its \\\"wake\\\" like a speedboat \\\"off the plane\\\" and we crossed the fence, he closed the \\\"throttles\\\" and the aircraft sat on the ground in a three point attitude. The ground run was probably 150 yards (yes yards in those days, not metres) and we were at taxi speed. He had to apply power to get to the \\'cross\\' runway. Of course after that I had to vary what I did on the Dak depending on who I was flying with. At that speed ground looping is almost impossible. The problem is when landing at the \\\"recommended\\\" speed, the main wheels are on the ground, the tail wheels is high and there is stacks of inertia to get rid of, and the way to do that is to apply the brakes which induces all sorts of problems so ably described by Chris Dams. I did my worst take-off ever also at Fort Vic in a Dak. The problem was mixing the flying of the Viscount and the Dak, with much more time on the Viscount. On the Viscount the operational technique was to hold the \\\"stick\\\" forward to increase the nosewheel contact and traction, whereas on the Dak you held the \\\"stick\\\" back to keep the tailwheel, which was \\\"locked\\\" in the central position, on the ground for directional stability, until the rudder had sufficient airflow to maintain direction, then you raised the tail wheel off the ground. I did the unthinkable by pushing the stick forward on the Dak, and raising the tail too early. What followed was spectacular and memorable. We stayed on the runway, but only with the application of brakes. It was a severe lesson for me, and I was trained initially on tail wheel aircraft. Good Dak pilots are a special breed. I had an uncle who flew one into Eastern Poland during the war to pick up some VIPs. He landed in a potato field at night with just the light of four hurricane lamps, after flying through the Alps from Brindisi. He was given the Polish VC for that flight and there is a memorial there to commemorate the flight and every year members of the family go there to commemorate the event. A couple of years ago they even had a Dak fly over the field (not land) as part of the celebration. One of many Dak stories!

This is the story of Dennis Blackbeard who lived at Serowe and operated all over Botswana as a professional hunter and later hunting safari operator. He relates this story (or a very similar one) on page 34. Here the writer (Dennis\\' records) says that the bushmen had actually recently killed a giraffe and as the pilots wore uniforms they assumed they were police out to arrest them for the killing. After feeding the pilots and going to sleep for the night the bush folk discussed things among themselves and decided it safest to do away with the supposed policemen. If you haven\\'t read this book it is one I would recommend. Refer: http://rhodesianheritage.blogspot.com/2013/05/bwana-wa-polisi.html DR. JIM REDMOND Hi Eddy, my name is Tina Cochrane and this article, which came to me via Neill Storey is about my dad. Don\\'t know if you would like a little background info but here\\'s some anyway. He was born in Dublin and during World War II was a rear gunner with Squadron No.35 in the Royal Air Force. Flying Officer James William Redmond, Number 179011. He moved to the then Northern Rhodesia after the war and at the break up of the federation we moved to Australia for a short spell. We moved to Gweru in 1963 where dad worked as a GP, first on the Railways and then in private practice. He was a Reserve with the RAF and attained the rank of Squadron Leader during his time with them. I have not seen my dad for many years but I do have a few photos of his time in Bomber Command. I do not have his log book or any of the other bits and bobs which he kept although I do remember us looking at them as children. Thanks for your interest and for circulating this article. Valerie Malcolm (RhAF) I remember him as a Railway Dr in Gwelo when we were young. We then moved into his house in Greenwood Park, when he left the Railways. That was in the late 60s. Denise Taylor Writes:- Congratulations to Dr. Jim on receiving his Bomber Command Clasp. As the article says it was long overdue. Thank you Dr Jim for your service during WW 2, and Rhodesia too. I was wondering if perhaps Dr Jim has any memoirs of that time and of his time in Thornhill. As a child back then I can say that the Docs at sick quarters we used to visit were all super and gentle. Paul and I had the double bonus of having Sister Robbie live on the same road as us, and many a cut was cleaned at her house and boy did she have a stash of sweets for after the \\\"visit\\\". Not just one lollipop like the dentist used to give out - no our dear nurse knew a handful was just the thing to make you \\\"feel all better\\\"! Thanks for the memories.

RHODESIAN NAVY PUTS TO SEA Des McLindon (dmclindon@btinternet.com) I was in the unit between 1962-1967.Lived at Hillside and used to cycle once a week to the unit. People must have thought it strange to see matelots in the streets of a landlocked country. What triggered this was seeing an article from 1952 with cadets on a RN warship, included in the names are H.E Armitage, he was a PO when I was there. I also have a newspaper article showing cadets at the lake, including photos. The Co LT Hignell died only recently in Australia.

I have many fond memories of Air Rhodesia from the 7 years I worked first as a “ground hostess” and then once I turned twenty an “air hostess”. I was in Gordon Hall’s terrific team on the ground and what a great job it was for a teenager who had only been a year out of school. One of the great things I liked about being part of the airline is that we never seemed to lose our sense of humour no matter what happened. One of my favourite stories whilst not about the 720s was when we did a charter flight to Blantyre for the Goshawks Rugby team on a Dakota in Feb 1971. Being the only hostess on board I allowed them to trundle down to the back of the aircraft to collect their beers and snacks and completely forgot about “the trim” when they decided to congregate in the galley. That was until I got a call, from the flight deck, on the intercom from a very concern sounding captain saying “can you get those lock forwards forward now!” Wops! So I said “hey guys can you pick up your beers and walk” which they did in haste when I explained that we were a bit heavy at the rear end. Another good laugh was when a few crews were sitting in the VFA crew room about a year before we got the triplets (as Captain Heap later called them) and we were reading papers/ talking quietly in small groups and then someone said looking up at the unstable looking fan on the ceiling “one of these days that is going to fall on us”. Capt. Tom Tarr did not miss a beat he just added “oh but it will all be different when we get jets”. We just broke into laugher mainly because we all felt that we were never going to “get jets” and there was probably more chance of the fan falling on us. So when the jets did arrive I felt it had been the best kept secret. The first I knew of it was when I was staying overnight with my sister and her husband in Johannesburg and they woke me, far too early in the morning I thought, saying – “you are going to be flying on jets when you get home”. They went on to explain it was “all over the news in South Africa”. What fun it was to have something new! We certainly seemed to all get on so well. Of course the big down side was the viscounts going down – will we ever get over that? Thanks to you and Eddy for bringing back such fond memories.

This award is in recognition for all the hard work that has been carried out by our volunteers and those of you that have supported us since our inception in 2007. On a personal note, I feel honoured to accept the commendation on behalf of everyone that has helped the project in the past and present. Some of you have trekked to the back of beyond to photograph a single grave whereas others have photographed many hundreds, if not thousands, of headstones and memorials around the world. Some cemeteries, I am aware, have required a bit of ‘diplomacy’ to access and a few favours have been redeemed for which I am grateful. This determination has allowed us to continue to supply photographs to families who have never had the opportunity to visit a loved one’s grave and promote the work of the CWGC via our website. I am often asked when we will be complete but as we move forward to the 100th anniversary of WWI there will always be plenty to do with updating the archive with cemeteries where re-engraving has taken place. This process will allow us to continue to provide the sterling service that has become expected of TWGPP and the excellent reputation we have gained as partners of the CWGC. Sincere thanks to you all for your continued, loyal support. Wonderful news Steve - congratulations. (Some ORAFs members have assisted in this project.

I was fortunate enough to be selected as a representative of the Southern Rhodesia Staff Corps in the rank of sergeant. Marching next to me in the front rank were Tommy Minks (Minx)? And Doug Webster, the only SRAF representatives. I think they were still part of the army then as they had the same uniform as us ‘brown jobs’ with the exception of the badge. I became quite friendly with both of them later during my time at New Sarum. I was wondering if either or both of them was/ were surviving now as most, if not all, of the army and BSAP members have emigrated or gone to a ‘better place’! (Sandy - Tommy entered into rest in April 2010. See http://www.ourstory.com/thread.html?t=639158#765202 Doug - Only record I have is that he left the Service in 1954. Eddy Norris) RHODESIAN NAVY Dave Hughes (Umtali) Writes:- I must say the bit on the Sea Cadets brought those dear fellows well and truly back into my mind. So sad that we used to ridicule them as we did. Quite a number of Umtali boys endured the Sea Cadets then went on to the General Naval College in Gordon’s Bay. I know a number of them went on to be very successful in the Merchant navy. I remember meeting up with a chap who was, and had been the Captain, of a massive oil tanker for many years. Last I heard he was a director of the shipping company that owned the tankers and was resident in the South of France !! However, I can’t help but recall the occasion at Cadet Camp at Inkomo. We were all marched to the edge of the dam to see the sea cadets in action. They were proudly showing off a raft that we were told they had built the previous day. They then proceeded to load a “field gun” onto the raft. The gun looked like an old ships canon and mounted of very rickety looking and spindly wagon wheels. Once on board the lads paddled their way across the dam to the jetty on the far side. They unloaded the wheeled weapon and then using ropes they began to haul the weapon up the steep slope away from the dam. After quite some time the good lads lost their footing and as they all tumbled the weapon took off backwards down the hill at a very exciting speed. Just before the jetty it hit a bump and became air born. It flew over the jetty coming down in the middle of the rather flimsy raft. A Barnes Wallis bouncing bomb could not have been more effective ! The canon disappeared very rapidly while bits of plank and old motor tubes floated around on the surface . (I guess that is flotsom as it was floating ?) Of course, the gathered cadets broke down with hilarity and the poor “Sea Sprouts” had a difficult job of ever re-inventing themselves ! Shampies. John Britton (RhAF) Writes:- In reply to Cliff Potter, if it was the Wooden shack at the bottom of the Drill hall, that was TS MASHONA the sea cadets \\\"ship on land\\\" I was a member of those guys as you could do Army cadets or Naval at school. Frank Fynn (RhAF and RhArmy) Writes:- I think age is catching up on some! I don\\'t think these were Sea Scouts but SEA CADETS, definitely the Salisbury group behind the Drill Hall were Cadets as a couple of the kids lived next door to us in Montague Ave in 1966. I think they were from Ally Willy and they had the choice of RRR cadets or Sea cadets! They wore the outfits as shown. Francis Heron (RhArmy) Writes:- Your article about the Rhodesian Navy brought back some old memories. I personally was not involved, but our Personnel Manager at the Farmers\\' Co-op Ltd., where I worked, a Mr. Ray Hignell used to coach a batch of Sea Cadets at Mazoe Dam for many years. They had a \\'whaler\\' based there, with which they used for training etc. Unfortunately, my friend Ray has passed away, otherwise he would have been delighted to furnish you with more details. It was his best extra-mural activity Tony Viegas (RhAF) Writes:- Dave Jackson is absolutely correct regarding the boys from St Josephs. St Joseph was a reformatory school for boys, and the majority of the HMS Matabele Sea Scouts were in fact boys from St Josephs Reformatory School. I will attempt to send you a better copy of the 2 photos so as to assist James Mackenzie. As far as I recollect there was no identifying badge on the sailors cap. The cap merely had HMS Matabele.

There is another expression which most people have interpreted incorrectly through the ages... ‘When a horse walks on snow, the snow collects and compacts itself in the hollow of the hoof. It eventually becomes a ball of snow, with the result that the horse no longer has any traction. The horse’s subsequent tumble, with its hooves in the air, was called a “Balls up”. And you thought ... Mike Hamence (RhAF) Writes:- Re: the item about people taking a bath twice a year, herewith a true personal anecdote, hope you will find space in your next N/L: In August 1984 I went to work for British Aerospace, Hatfield, UK, and lived in digs while my wife Sheila sold up in Harare. The land lady was a kindly soul but rather Victorian when it came to personal hygiene. When I first went to meet her she asked what time would I get up for breakfast? I replied, \\\"6.30 am.\\\" She said, \\\"Why so early, you don\\'t start work till 8.\\\" I said, \\\"Well, I shall take a shower first.\\\" Her mouth opened wide. \\\"What? Every day? After living there for two weeks or so I asked her when she would change my bed linen. \\\"Only when it smells!\\\" Sheila moved in with me while we house hunted; it was the middle of winter. One weekend the lady went away; Sheila opened all the windows and \\'blitzed\\' the place from top to bottom. When the lady came home on the Sunday evening she sniffed and said, \\\"It don\\'t \\'alf smell queer in \\'ere!\\\" Vic Wightman (RhAF) Writes:- In my experience these \\\"amazing things, bet you didn\\'t know\\\" articles which do the rounds are fallacious 99% of the time. For example this recent one courtesy Ian Jack and Don Munroe is easily refutable by Snopes. See here:- http://www.snopes.com/language/phrases/lesson.asp This is not to blame you, of course. After all, it\\'s pretty harmless and might indeed be quite fun for some people. Who says I\\'m a cynic? (Jeez - I now wonder where they did originate. Eddy Norris) ALEC MANN Charlie Buchan (RhAF_ Writes:- Eddy could you please publish this for me. Maybe we can inject ( to be polite ) some support from Air Force members in Durban or that area Alec Mann has been moved to the frail care unit in the Flame Lily Moth Village in Queensborough nearer Pinetown. He is now alone in a small room which is much better for him. He is receiving good proper care. However where are the support group. My wife and I make a point of trying to get there once a month but it is a fair distance from Underberg. I know as you well do there are Air Force Members who live much nearer\\', So I am once again appealing to them to go and show a bit of comradie to an aging member. Easy to find as it is in the village where the SAS memorial is. Come on friends get off your butts and visit and keep his spirits and brain active.

I just thought I would send you early warning FYI that in September or October I will be publishing a full scale history of golf in Rhodesia and Zimbabwe right from the beginning 120 years ago. I hope to bring it out in September or October and I will send you full details probably in August. It will run to at least 250 pages under hard cover. A history of golf here has never been attempted before and the massive volume of research makes me understand just why. Actually it cannot be a history because records were often destroyed in the early days and people with recollections are long gone. I am titling it “Staying the Course” with the sub-title. “At long last - the story of golf in Rhodesia and Zimbabwe through 120 years of war and peace.” Trust you are well and the magazine flourishing.

This would awaken the Thornhill \\'Married Patch\\' residents. They called the train \\'The Maternity Special\\'.

Man: Usually about 3 Woman: How much do you pay per beer? Man: $5.00 which includes a tip Woman: And how long have you been drinking? Man: About 20 years, I suppose Woman: So a beer costs $5 and you have 3 beers a day which puts your spending each month at $450. In one year, it would be approximately $5400 ....correct? Man: Correct Woman: If in 1 year you spend $5400, not accounting for inflation, the past 20 years puts your spending at $108,000, correct? Man: Correct Woman: Do you know that if you didn\\'t drink so much beer, that money could have been put in a step-up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the past 20 years, you could have now bought a Ferrari?

It was a house for boys from broken homes. The Supt. was Eric Curtis and the Matron his wife Ida Curtis. The Sea Cadets were commanded (?) by Lt. George Thomas.

The main reason this video is called Angel Flight is visual. When the plane releases its decoy missiles, as is shown in several of the pictures, it creates an Angel shape in the smoke. But it is much more than just visual. See for yourself. Listen to the words of the pilot and the tower, and make sure you sit quietly and listen to the very end. This is beautiful.

BEAVER SAFARI IN NORTHERN RHODESIA (1961) Dave Whitehead Writes:- Many thanks Chris – no, I am not a subscriber yet but will ask Eddie for details to become one. I hope you don’t mind - Correction for Eddie Norris or rather John Rogers – Mankoya is not on the banks of the Zambezi but way inland. The last port of call before Lusaka is usually Mumbwa. Between Mankoya and Mumbwa is the Kafue. There is now a bridge across the Kafue HOOK but in my day the crossing was by a pontoon. Grannia O\\'Donell (Air Rhodesia) Writes:- Wow some names I know there John Rogers – I worked for him in PR when I left Air Rhodesia. Dave Harvey lovely guy great to fly with too. Peter Eggelston – I wonder if he was related to Eric Eggelston who was one of the managers in traffic when I worked there in 1969.

The Military Medal as far as I am aware, was normally awarded to non-commissioned ranks in the army and I know of no other case of this decoration being awarded to a member of the Air Force. I suppose it was because he was not in the air when he did this courageous deed. Can anyone tell me if this is so? Replies to orafs11@gmail.com MEMORIES OF NUMBER 1 INTERNMENT CAMP HARARE Vic MacKenzie Writes:- I found that post really interesting, mainly because at the end of the war when they released all the Germans and Italians, the Government moved \\\"poor\\\" Rhodesians into the internment camps and I happened to be one of those Rhodesians. (My father suddenly died leaving my mother with no support and four young children) The first seven years of my life were spent behind barbed wire fences, although the main gate was always opened. The camp was renamed Beatrice Road Cottages and was a wonderful place for a young child to grow up. We had our own little kindergarten school, a roller skating rink, a laundry and the little houses were brick built and very comfortable. All the roads were tarred. Plus the fact it was a very tight community. The only downside was it did attract a criminal element and as a youngster you could always tell when someone was released from jail because the prison authorities gave them a suit and a bus ticket. There were some larger than life characters who lived there such as Peter Platt who was a motorcycle racer and later a mercenary in the Congo, Billy Crauser and his brothers who were gangsters and the Parson family who ran the Cottages. The government started building African townships next to the Cottages and eventually the white people were moved out and it became part of the Harare township. I remember going back there in the late seventies and it was still the same. Fallbrook southern California. John Andrews (BSAP) My wife\\'s late step-father, Egon Groeger, was a Sergeant at the Italian internment camp near Fort Victoria. Egon was Jewish and had escaped from Vienna by the skin of his teeth when the Nazis arrived. Being Austrian he was briefly interned at the outbreak of war before it was realised he was actually an ally. However, he was called up for guard duties at the Fort Victoria camp. We still have his ID card somewhere. He told a story about some of the Italian prisoners breaking out of the camp to spend the weekends with female company in the local kraals. They always returned voluntarily by Monday morning! Apparently at the end of the war many of them applied to stay on in Rhodesia but the government insisted that they be repatriated to Italy and apply from there. I remember that in Bulawayo in the 60s and 70s there were a number of prominent citizens who had gone this route. I hope this snippet will be of interest. THE SPOOK HOUSE Doug Smith (RhAF) Writes:- It is still there. Rhodes did own it. He has passed away. Brian Rhodes was from Karoi area and his nick name was TSOTSE. He was a problem child. He owned the outdoor living centre and many acres in that area. One of our famous rally drivers stayed there, Hanas Kruger. I went there when he lived there. Very narrow doors and very airy. To have spooks there, it would not surprise me. It then became a restaurant after Hanas moved out. I am unsure if it is still running but the house is still there. It reminds me of the big house behind the seven miles hotel out on the Harare south road. It burnt down and not even the locals would go near it. Also meant to be haunted. Ian McKenzie (RhAF) Writes:- I lived across the road from the Spook House in the late seventy in Greengrove. Funny, the house always intrigued me and one day I when across to look around. Surprised to see a swimming pool which was someway away from the house amongst the large granite rocks. Never went near the house, thank goodness. Glad that I went in daylight. If I had known this was the Spook House I would never have ventured here in the first place. David Bruce Writes:- This house sounds like Lorelei which was right next door to the Drive In on the Umtali Road and was owned by NAF Williams. It was rented by members of C.I.D. Salisbury and I was one of its occupants in 1964-5. There were huge boulders alongside the house with a swimming pool under them. It is news to me that it was haunted. Bob Manser (RhAF) Writes:- If Doctor Williams who owned the house says it was haunted and told a large gathering of us History Society members at an organized talk, then I believe Doctor Wi"
