        "text": "You kissed your daughter goodnight. By morning, she’s gone.\n\nTwo days ago, FBI Agent Val Costa came face to face with a serial killer known as the Bear. One of only two women ever to survive, she’s forever branded with his a curling “S” carved into her skin. Val knows it’s only a matter of time before he takes another victim.\n\nForced home to recover, Val returns to Red Rose County, California, to be with her son. But the very next day she finds the close-knit community panic-stricken over the disappearance of blonde-haired, freckled-faced local teen, Scarlett Douglas.\n\nDefying orders, Val interviews the Douglas family at their farmhouse and uncovers a less-than-idyllic picture. Housebound since a devastating diagnosis, Scarlett’s world was crumbling. The sight of Scarlett’s unworn prom dress hanging in her room brings a tear to Val’s eye. She won’t sleep until this sweet girl is home and safe.\n\nVal and her team search the nearby towering redwoods for any clue to what happened the morning Scarlett disappeared. But the case takes a sinister turn when a little pink teddy bear is delivered to Val’s door. Did the Bear follow her to Red Rose County? Is her family now in terrible danger? Could Scarlett be his latest victim?\n\nWorking around the clock, Val begins to question if the Douglases are the loving parents they claim to be. With time running out to save Scarlett’s life, and the truth just within her reach, will Val once again come face to face with the Bear? And who—if anyone—will survive?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nThis is a new author for me and she had me hooked because of her storytelling and her writing style.\n\nThe main protagonist is Val Costa, an FBI agent and she is a wonderful person. She is determined and a bit head strong not wanting to waste time and thus venturing out on her own, with terrible consequences. What I also like about her is that she tends to color outside the lines, but all for the greater good.\n\nVal is doing her uttermost to keep all the plates spinning: trying to find a serial killer she has been eye to eye with, spending much needed time with her family and helping the police team in her home town with a missing persons case. The last one leading us down a road filled with disgusting characters.\n\nThis was an extremely thrilling book and a perfect first book in a new series. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nH.K.

Dark and seductive, he appears in my dreams, igniting a desire I can’t control.\n\nThey say Aon is a monster, a killer, and worse… So why do I find myself drawn to him? His face is hidden behind a mask, but his voice and his touch enchant me.\n\nWhen the magic of Under begins to change, the six houses are thrown into a struggle for power and I begin a deadly game of cat and mouse with Aon’s rivals.

Emily Stark is a ray of hope in the darkness, fighting for survival, fighting for truth.\n\nAmidst the corrosive clouds that shroud the globe, Emily is on a mission to reach the colossal machine that brought the skies crashing to earth. She has the power to destroy it, but her journey is fraught with danger.\n\nThe savage Outsiders patrol the poisonous, dark wilderness, hunting for any sign of life. As the acid air burns her skin, Emily can only stifle her screams. She must remain undetected. She must succeed in her mission.\n\nDeep within the workings of the machine, Declan Chambers wakes from a nightmare to the gentle touch of his beloved Sammi. She is beautiful, vibrant, enchanting… but he vividly recalls burying her broken body just a few days before.\n\nUtterly bewitched, he’s desperate to believe Sammi is real. As her belly swells with new life, she promises Declan the machine is not their enemy—it can grant them a life together, forever. But at what cost?\n\nClouds fall, the dead rise, and Emily has the fate of humanity in her hands. To return sunlight to the earth, she must destroy the machine. But will the sight of her resurrected sister, safe and happy, present a truly impossible choice?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nWhen we left the characters in book 1 it was on a very sad and emotional note. Now, when we look at the title, happier times seem to be on the horizon. The question is: how will they succeed in lifting the grey skies that had them captivated during all those years?\n\nThis second and last book in this mini series is filled with heartache, but it also heralds the beginning of happy times for some of the characters. The saying goes ‘after rain comes sunshine’, but in this case the sunshine comes after the grey skies.\n\nThe real purpose of the machines is also revealed, it being hidden behind a noble goal.\n\nPeople being lied to and manipulated does not only happen in the present world, but also in the apocalyptic one. Some things really do never change.\n\nAll’s well that ends well.It’s just a pity so many people had to suffer. It was refreshing to see that love never dies. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nB.R.

Someone puts a hand on my shoulder, pulling me into a hug. As I look into the face of a woman I’ve never seen before, she whispers something that shatters my world. “He was my father too.”\n\nStaring into the woman’s glassy gray eyes, I pray that she’s lying. I can’t believe that my steady, dependable father could do this to me. But a hush falls over my family as my ‘new sister’ Ava spills secrets about his hidden affairs and how he bought her silence. Now she’s finally free, she wants to be a part of the family.\n\nBut as my relatives welcome her with open arms, I’m certain something isn’t right. Details of her childhood keep changing. And I catch the way she looks at my fiancé, batting her long lashes and touching his well-toned arm. Can this woman be trusted? Does anyone else share my fears? Then, with a snide smile, away from the eyes of my family, she tells me that she knows my own dark secret.\n\nI need to stay silent to keep myself safe. Until I find a crumpled white envelope in my father’s office that makes my blood run cold. What if my father’s death was no accident? Is Ava really here to join our family, or tear us apart?\n\nAva thinks she knows all my secrets, but she has no idea just how far I’d go to protect the people I love…\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nI want to start by saying how much I love the cover.\n\nPeople can be very good in hiding the fact they have a child born out of wedlock. But as we often see, those secrets are bound to come out and this kind of surprises pop up after someone died, especially when there is something to gain.\n\nRose is not, to say it kindly, the most popular member ot the family. Then Ava appears claiming to be the secret child. Rose has some serious doubts about this claim. The family though would happily exchange Rose for Ava with a second thought.\n\nRose decides to dig up her feisty side and is determined to expose Ava for the inposter she believes she is.\n\nThis story is a true example of how far people are prepared to go when money is involved. An easy and enjoyable read. I liked the evolution Rose went through and she got everything she deserves. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nCole Baxter is a top Amazon bestselling author who is a practicing primary care physician who writes bestselling psychological suspense thrillers.\n\nHis stories will have you reading through the night – they are very addictive!\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/colebaxterbooks\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ColeBaxterBooks/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/colebaxterauthor/\n\n***\n\nBook Link\n\nhttps://geni.us/B0D98FDY1Ksocial\n\n***\n\nI look at where the woman was sitting. There’s a scrap of paper tucked into the gap between the seats. With shaking hands, I pick it up. The note reads: Help me.\n\nAt first glance, the couple on the train look normal. She’s dressed smartly, a floral patterned bag on her lap. But her hands are clenched, her fingers white. The man with her has his arm looped through hers, but not in a comforting way. He’s holding her too tightly.\n\nShe catches my eye and I see desperation there. I’m opening my mouth to speak when the train grinds to a halt and the man stands, hauling her away. She looks at me again, then at the seat behind her, her face pale.\n\nI find the message she left behind. Help me.\n\nWhen I call the police, there’s no sign of the couple on CCTV. The kind detective gently suggests that it’s not surprising, with my history, that I am imagining things. Wanting to save someone.\n\nI know what I saw. If no one will believe me, I’ll find her myself.\n\nBut as I search, what I find seems personal. Little things that remind me of what happened ten years ago. And I think I’m being followed, that someone broke into my flat.\n\nThe hunt for the woman on the train is leading me somewhere I should never go. Can I save her, or will I be next?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nOne aspect of being a good citizen is of course reporting to the police when you believe, even are convinced someone is in danger. But what if they don’t trust your judgement, because there just is not any proof.\n\nWhat would you do? Would you let it go and put it out of your head or would you do whatever you can to find out what is going on? If the author would have chosen option one, it would be a very thin book. 😉 😉 I am happy she picked the second one and treats us to a splendid story.\n\nThe author alternates chapters describing the present with those filling us in about the past.\n\nAre you ready to accompany Laura on her quest for the truth? Sit back, relax and enjoy!\n\nI, for one, had a wonderful time joining Laura on this thrilling ride. I enjoyed seeing all the pieces of the puzzle falling into place. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nClaire Cooper grew up in a small village in south Wales before moving to London as a student.
