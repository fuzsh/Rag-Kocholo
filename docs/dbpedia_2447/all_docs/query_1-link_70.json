It’s all made up, of course, but Ava doesn’t have to know that.\n\nThere is so much worry in her blue eyes. Her phone pings with constant messages and a small stain marks her crisp shirt. Breakfast with her two little girls before heading out to this high-flying job every morning can’t be easy.\n\nAva needs me, I think. More than anything.\n\nThe interview goes perfectly, because I have made myself into the perfect assistant. Now I just hope Ava never finds out why I’m really here. Not before she lets me into her home, and I meet her charming husband, and get to babysit her children.\n\nBecause I have plans for Ava. She just has to trust me…\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nWhen there is someone who knows everything about you and you know them inside out too, it’s great, because it means you are very close. When there is someone who knows everything about you, but you don’t know them from Adam, it’s another kettle of fish. What makes it even more creepy is the fact you don’t know they know all what happens in your life.\n\nThe question that comes to mind is are they here to help you or do they have another thing planned?\n\nGradually we find out what the intentions were and then there was only one thing left to be revealed. Why? Rest assured that all will become clear, but you have to be patient, because the author makes us wait for it. 🙂\n\nOnce again I realised how one person’s manipulations can start a whole string of problems and heart ache.\n\nA very delicious book with excellent characters and a smooth writing style. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nNicole Trope went to university to study Law but realised the error of her ways when she did very badly on her first law essay because-as her professor pointed out- ‘It’s not meant to be a story.’ She studied teaching instead and used her holidays to work on her writing career and complete a Masters’ degree in Children’s Literature.\n\nThe idea for her first published novel, The Boy under the Table, was so scary that it took a year for her to find the courage to write the emotional story. She went on to publish a further five novels in Australia before joining Bookouture in 2019. She is a USA Today and Amazon bestseller in the USA, UK, AUS and CAN.\n\nShe lives in Sydney with her husband and three children.\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NicoleTrope/\n\n***\n\n***\n\nBook Link\n\nhttps://geni.us/B0D6VVJSDZsocial\n\nIt was supposed to be my family’s promising new start, but then everything went very, very wrong…\n\nWhen Julia Blythe moves to a small, sleepy town on the south coast with her husband Ewan and their two children, they all agree to put their past behind them. She’s offered her dream job at the local hospital, and the kids get a place at the friendly, red-brick village school – it’s perfect. No more threatening letters, no more twisted lies.\n\nAnd how nice to meet her new colleague Nathan Sloan and his wife Storm, when picking up her children on their first day. Gracious and good-looking, the Sloans have a son in the same year and a close-knit circle of friends who welcome Julia and Ewan as if they’ve always known them.\n\nBut just as Julia is starting to relax into their new life, the unthinkable happens. A day trip to the coast ends in tragedy when her youngest child is reported missing. Her new friends crowd around to help – searching the desolate clifftops for a sign. But Julia can’t help but wonder if she’s once again placed her trust in someone deadly…\n\nIn a town this small, how could nobody see what happened? And who can she turn to when anyone around her could be telling lies? In running away to this new beginning, has Julia unknowingly put her family in even more terrible danger?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nEvery profession is important in our world. What would we do wiithour doctors, but equally, what would be do without hte people collecting our bins. They all matter, each in their own way.\n\nDoctors, of course, do amazing jobs and they deserve every credit they get. But some think they are some kind of God and when they have the looks and the charm too, they think they are unstoppable and can do as they please. Scheming to get what they want is something they consider as normal behaviour and as long as they can benefit, that’s all that matters.\n\nMost of the time, the victims don’t complain or some are flattered by the attention and won’t talk either.\n\nIn comes Julia. She is a doctor too, but she does not play the same game. On the contrary, she thinks it’s time they were taken down a notch. They, on the other hand, are not going to go down without a fight…\n\nA very enjoyable book, but sometimes a bit too slow paced for me. 4 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nLucy’s first bestselling novel – His Other Lover – was published in 2008.

No one believes that I’m innocent – and honestly, if I were them, I wouldn’t either. Everything you ever read, anything that makes the news? It’s always the husband.\n\nBeautiful, bright-eyed Michelle Jackson, a loving wife and mother, has been killed. Her husband Paul is accused of murdering her. Their little girl Emily, numb with grief, is refusing to speak. You’ll hate Paul for what he’s done.\n\nEveryone said they were the perfect couple, always holding hands. They did everything together. But when you hear about their whispered arguments and the terrible lies they both told, you’ll be certain Paul is guilty.\n\nBut everything you think you know is wrong. After all, behind closed doors every marriage has secrets. And some are deadlier than others…\n\nThis book was previously published as The Man Behind Closed Doors.\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nWhat is there not to love about this book? That’s a very good question and I honestly cannot name one thing.\n\nThe writing style is very fluent, the characters are great and I liked the premise. The author also manages to leave my mind in dubio the whole time. I could not really decide whether I found myself in the ‘I believe their story’ or the ‘I don’t buy it at all’ team.\n\nI had my eye on something I found suspicious and it seemed I was right about that, but I had not expected this outcome.\n\nThis is a great domestic and I admired and felt for Paul at the same time. He says he did not kill his wife. Now it’s up to the jury to decide whether he can walk away or remain locked up.\n\nI have utterly enjoyed every book I have read by this author and this one is no exception. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nMaria Frankland has a dubious internet search history and a very worried mother-in-law. However, neither of these things can stop her writing gripping psychological thrillers in which you’ll never find a happy-ever-after.\n\nHer novels are mostly set in Yorkshire where you’ll hear the accent through all her characters. These are people you could live next door to, or closer still… don’t say you haven’t been warned.\n\nMaria’s novels are fast-paced, down to earth and realistic. You never know what’s around the corner…\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nWebsite: https://mariafrankland.co.uk/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/writermaria_f/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/writermariafrank/\n\n***\n\n***\n\nBook Link\n\n***\n\nBerlin, 1942. “All I know is we will survive this together,” he says before kissing the tears away from my cheeks. But I know if the Nazis discover what we’ve done, how we’ve conspired against them, we will die together.\n\nDeaf since the age of five, Mina has had to fight for everything she has, including her place at an Austrian university to study physics. She has never felt accepted—until she meets fellow student Siggy, and her heart stops at the kindness in his bright blue eyes.\n\nBut Mina’s world comes crashing down when the SS arrive at her door and escort her to Berlin. She’s terrified it’s because of her disability—she’s heard the awful rumours about the Nazi euthanasia program. So relief washes over her when she’s told as one of Germany’s brightest minds, she’s been recruited to work for the government.\n\nSoon, this relief turns to horror when Mina learns why she’s truly here: they want her to build the atomic bomb that will win Germany the war. Mina knows if she refuses they will kill her. But if she does as they say, she could be responsible for the death of millions.\n\nWith Siggy’s help, Mina vows to do everything she can to sabotage the project. Will they save the world from a devastating catastrophe? Or will everything they’ve risked be in vain?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEllie Midwood is a USA Today bestselling and award-winning historical fiction author, whose works have been translated into 20 languages. She owes her interest in the history of the Second World War to her grandfather, Junior Sergeant in the 2nd Guards Tank Army of the First Belorussian Front, who began telling her about his experiences on the frontline when she was a young girl. Growing up, her interest in history only deepened and transformed from reading about the war to writing about it. After obtaining her BA in Linguistics, Ellie decided to make writing her full-time career and began working on her first full-length historical novel, “The Girl from Berlin.” Ellie is continuously enriching her library with new research material and feeds her passion for WWII and Holocaust history by collecting rare memorabilia and documents.\n\nIn her free time, Ellie is a health-obsessed yoga enthusiast, neat freak, adventurer, Nazi Germany history expert, polyglot, philosopher, a proud Jew, and a doggie mama. Ellie lives in New York with her husband and their three dogs.\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nWebsite: http://elliemidwood.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010612127541\n\n***\n\n***\n\nBook Link\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/When-World-Went-Silent-heartbreaking-ebook/dp/B0D4RP4B8X/\n\nShe’s here to help my daughter. She wants to steal my life.\n\nI have a gorgeous husband, Scott, two lovely children, a successful career and a stylish townhouse. Anyone would think my life is perfect. But it’s all a lie.\n\nMy twelve-year-old Katie has been in trouble at school and won’t talk to me. Desperate, we hire young, willowy brunette Deanna – an expert tutor – to help my daughter. I’ve been so worried and my husband blames me. Have I failed as a mother?\n\nDeanna is our last hope, the only person who seems able to help my precious child. But I’m starting to wonder about her intentions…\n\nShe’s in my kitchen, touching Scott’s arm. She and Katie seem to be keeping secrets, laughing as they glance at me. And I see her in my bedroom, watching from the window as I leave for work.\n\nThen I find Deanna in Scott’s study, examining an old, framed photograph. And she begins to ask questions about Scott’s beautiful ex-wife.\n\nI know her game; she’s looking for something that will destroy my life. The life she wants for herself.\n\nBut Deanna has underestimated me. I won’t give up my perfect family without a fight, and she has no idea how far I’ll go to stop her…\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nNever judge a book by it’s cover and I am not talking about an actual book in this case, but about people.\n\nThe most charming and loving person on the outside can have the most rotten center and someone you think you have to keep in your sight, might be someone who has your best interests at heart.\n\nSometimes someone sees something you don’t and in order to help you, they have to ‘hurt’ you first, because if they would talk to you about it, you would think they were not telling the truth. Sometimes they have to open your eyes the hard way.\n\nWhen I start a new book, the author gives me some information for my mind to work with and it starts wandering down a certain path. The question is though: is this the path the author wants me to follow or do they suddenly want me to throw everything I thought I knew overboard and make me reprogram by thinking process…\n\nA great story and great characters make for a very enjoyable read. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nJ M Dalgliesh is a bestselling British crime novelist.

She loves vintage clothes, antiques and… solving crimes?\n\nBella Winter moved to charming Hope Eaton for some peace and quiet after quitting her busy city job. She delights in spending time in her little antique store on top of the hill, hunting for bargains at auctions, and getting to know everybody – because if there’s one thing Bella’s good at, it’s solving other people’s problems.\n\nBut her peaceful life is overturned when she finds eccentric local historian Professor Oliver Barton dead in the ruins of Raven Hall, a trowel lying near his outstretched hand. At first, Bella is like everyone else: saddened by a tragic accident. But then her colleague John asks her to dig deeper. Because the dead man gave him an ancient coin he should never have had, and John thinks he was murdered.\n\nIt turns out the professor was hunting for buried treasure in the middle of the night. But who would have wanted him dead? And who are the four suspicious women he told John about, calling them the queens of hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades…?\n\nAs Bella delves into the case she uncovers a hoard of suspects: the lord of the manor, a secretive group of treasure hunters, the dead man’s desperate niece and her no-good son. And when another local historian takes a fatal tumble, she is certain that the answers lie in the antiques the professor stole. But can she solve the crime before someone tries to bury her?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nClare Chase writes classic mysteries.

Murder on the Marshes (Tara Thorpe 1) was shortlisted for an International Thriller Writers award.\n\nLike her heroines, Clare is fascinated by people and what makes them tick.

She swears she’ll leave again forever—it’s not like her childhood home holds any happy memories. But Jane hadn’t planned on bumping into Nik…\n\nThe boy she fell hard for was a skinny teenager with messy hair and his glasses askew. Now he’s broad-shouldered and stands well over six feet tall: but his deep brown eyes are just the same. And when he breathes her name and caresses the fresh bruise on her cheek—like he can’t help but touch her—Jane is thrown right back to the best and worst time of her life.\n\nJane and Nik once shared everything: kisses, hopes, and teenage dreams. Taking in his blue scrubs and doctor’s ID badge, Jane’s heart lifts that at least one of them got to live their dream. And as they catch up over the beautiful music they once loved, it’s like the years between them fall away.\n\nBut Nik doesn’t know the heavy secret Jane carries about the real reason she left town. Or who put that bruise on her cheek… or about her plans to truly disappear, forever.\n\nSo when the past comes calling, can Jane and Nik find the strength to fight for each other? Or was Jane dangerously wrong to think she could outrun her secret—and will it destroy them both?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nEvery child deserves the best possible childhood, but unfortunately some parents do not seem to agree with that. When you are young, you don’t have a choice and you have to try and make the best of it, but when the situation escalates, you flee. On the one hand to protect yourself, but to protect others too even if they don’r realise it and rather feel like you have left them behind.\n\nIt is not easy to try and build a new life, but when you are determined enough, it seems like the sun is shining on you again or it is just a smoke screen?\n\nI loved Jane. Even though she is still young, she is very mature, because of the decision she makes. I felt every emotion she went through and this can only mean one thing: the author did a splendid job in describing them and making me feel like I was standing next to her.\n\nThere are quite a few people who are the victim of one abusive person, whether they suffered directly or indirectly. It had an impact on their life which resulted in pain, sadness and anger.\n\nThis is an emotional story about lost love and second chances of lost friendships and becoming firm friends again, of making up and seeing things from a different angle.\n\nIt’shard for me to understand how some people can be so cruel, and enjoy it, to other people, but sadly it’s the harsh reality. 4 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nMelissa Wiesner is a night-owl who began writing novels about five years ago when her early-to-bed family retired for the evening.
