        "text": "Gatward History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Gatward family\n\nThe surname Gatward was first found in Essex where they held a family seat as Lords of the Manor. The Saxon influence of English history diminished after the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The language of the courts was French for the next three centuries and the Norman ambience prevailed. But Saxon surnames survived and the family name was first referenced in the year 1255 when Richard le Gateward held estates in that county.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Gatward family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Gatward research. Another 96 words (7 lines of text) covering the years 1273, 1455, 1487 and 1524 are included under the topic Early Gatward History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGatward Spelling Variations\n\nUntil quite recently, the English language has lacked a definite system of spelling rules. Consequently, Anglo-Saxon surnames are characterized by a multitude of spelling variations. Changes in Anglo-Saxon names were influenced by the evolution of the English language, as it incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other languages. Although Medieval scribes and church officials recorded names as they sounded, so it is common to find one person referred to by several different spellings of his surname, even the most literate people varied the spelling of their own names. Variations of the name Gatward include Gatward, Gatewood, Gatwood, Gateward, Gattward and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Gatward family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nthe Gatward family of Essex\n\nLoading...\n\nGatward migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers.
