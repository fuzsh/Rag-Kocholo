        "text": "BY RICHARD MADDOX\n\nSEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY a single RAF aircraft undertook an audacious mission to boost the morale of the French population.\n\nNINETEEN FORTY ONE wasn’t a good year for Occupied France and there was no reason to think that 1942 would be any better.\n\nThe Occupation continues to make daily life in France – and indeed in all the countries under German control – difficult in many ways.\n\nFrance is physically and ideologically divided. Troops are on the streets of the Occupied Zone. The Résistance and German authorities continue the cycle of assassinations and reprisals.\n\nPower struggles between Guallist and communist factions split the Résistance.\n\nFactories have been taken over to manufacture products for the Germans.\n\nRationing continues for the French population.\n\nMass arrests of communist sympathisers started in 1941 and Jewish citizens are coming under increasing scrutiny – not just from the Germans directly but through the occupying forces using the French authorities and their Vichy allies to enforce the new order.\n\nUnable to lure foreign workers to Germany itself by the promise of better rations, the German controlled Service du Travail Obligatoire (a scheme whereby more than half a million people were forcibly sent to work in Germany) was just starting.\n\nAfter the evacuation at Dunkirk and the destruction of units of the French naval fleet by the Royal Navy in August 1940, many felt in France and elsewhere felt Britain needed to show its support.\n\nThus Operation SQUABBLE was born.\n\nOrganised by the Special Operations Executive and Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert de la Ferté (himself of French descent) the original plan was for a single attacking aircraft to fly along the mile-long Avenue des Champs-Élysées just as the German Army were parading there and – if the opportunity presented itself – attack the nearby former French Ministre de la Marine (now occupied as the Germany Naval headquarters in France).\n\nSir Philip was Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, the branch of the RAF that operated closely with the Royal Navy and – critical in these circumstances – attack small targets at low level.\n\nCoastal Command had both the aircraft and the aircrew to mount an attack such as this.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Alfred Kitchener ‘Ken’ Gatward was a leading anti-shipping attack expert and was offered the chance of carrying out the attack. It was stressed that it would be an ‘unsafe’ mission using a single aircraft without further support.\n\nGatward and his navigator, Flight Sergeant Gilbert ‘George’ Fern immediately started planning the flight and honing their skills by carrying out attacks on an abandoned wreck in the English Channel.\n\nThe day of the attack dawned and improving weather – that is the lack of cloud cover – forced the pair back to England while they were over France.\n\nThis happened not once but three times and without the advantage of surprise the mission was doomed.\n\nSo on 12 June 1942 the aircraft left the Coastal Command airfield at Thorney Island, Hampshire (just outside Portsmouth) for what the crew had decided would be the final attempt. They had decide that there was to be no more practising.\n\nThis was it.\n\nThey would fly the whole mission at low level to give them the best chance.\n\nCrossing the French coast half an hour after take-off, they managed to avoid both fighter aircraft and flak positions.\n\nAt one point some 30 feet (10 metres above the ground) the aircraft scattered a murder of crows. One lodged in the engine air intake, causing the motor to overheat.\n\nStill they flew on.\n\nApproaching Paris from the south they rounded the Eiffel Tower and then headed for the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs-Élysées.\n\nTheir canons primed and ready, they reportedly flew at less than roof top height down the Champs-Élysées. But not until they had sent one of two banners (made from a French naval ensign back in Britain) fluttering down on the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nBut their German army quarry eluded them. The military parade – something that happened every day after midday – was nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead the crew saw groups of French people happily waving to the aircraft.\n\nAt the other end of the Avenue, the Place de la Concorde with its fountains and the Luxor monument grew ever larger.\n\nSwinging around the 75-foot Egyptian obelisk they lining up on their second objective, the Naval Headquarters.\n\nGatward fired a volley of 20mm shells into the building before dropping the second banner and making off north towards Gare Saint Lazare railway station and then coming around westward to return to England – again at low level.\n\nLanding at RAF Northolt not far from central London, he and Fern delivered 60 photographic images of Paris.\n\nIn 2012 Gatward’s Second World War medal group, together with memorabilia about the flight were sold at auction for £51,000.\n\nSources and more information\n\nhttp://www.reemandansie.com/departments/coins-militaria/\n\nhttp://www.vintagewings.ca/VintageNews/Stories/tabid/116/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/450/Ten-Minute-Triumph-Over-Tyranny.aspx"
