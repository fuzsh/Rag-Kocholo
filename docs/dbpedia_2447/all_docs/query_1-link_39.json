        "text": "National treasure and renowned wit Stephen Fry explores the highways and byways of the English language in these celebrated programmes.\n\nIn each episode, Fry explores the oddities and celebrates the curiosities of the language we use. His love of words is indulged with infectious enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity at all times.\n\nFrom puns and metaphors to clichés and gibberish, this famously witty, incisive and engaging series explores the joys of the English language.\n\nAs an Audio Show – free for members – when you add Fry’s English Delight (Series 8) to your library, you’ll get all four episodes, each with a runtime of about 30 minutes.\n\n***\n\n(Audible Studios, 23 January 2018, audiobook, 1 hour 52 minutes, narrated by Stephen Fry, Audible)\n\n***\n\nGET A COPY\n\n***\n\nEpisodes:\n\nWords Fail Me\n\nTalking About The Weather\n\nDo You Promise Not To Tell?\n\nEnglish Plus One\n\n***\n\nI enjoyed listening to this series.\n\nI found this podcast amusing and entertaining and not what I expected. I thought it would be all about Fry being snooty and berating how much the modern world has ruined the English Language. That’s not what I got at all.\n\nI liked the structure of the show, how Fry charts different facets of the English Language through history using interesting examples and with a little help from experts including linguists. I am a big fan of Fry and like his accent. The thing is, I love dialect and accents and could listen to certain ones for hours.\n\nMy favourite episode was English Plus One. This episode explores what it means to be bilingual or multi-lingual (apparently, there is a difference, I had no idea). I loved every moment of this episode. I was especially delighted by the four-year old boy who could switch naturally between different languages."
