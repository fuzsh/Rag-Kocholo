        "text": "Written by: David Gatward\n\nSpeculative fiction really does seem to be among the most exciting areas in writing. Wherever you look, someone, somewhere, is writing and publishing and talking about something new and unique and weird and scary and off the wall crazy.\n\nI came across this one by accident. Two horror anthologies launching at the end of November, published by U. P. Press: “Horror: Filipino Fiction for Young Adults”, edited by Dean Francis Alfar and Kenneth Yu, and a print edition of “Demons of the New Year”, edited by Karl de Mesa and Joseph Nacino. The official launch is November 29, 2013 at the West Wing Gallery of the Vargas Museum in UP Diliman. So if you’re around – drop in. Why? Well, here’s the info on Demons of the New Year:\n\n“These are more than just rehashed tales from the provinces about Filipino mythological monsters like aswang and the tilbakang. Nor are these your run-of-the-mill ghost stories told thrice over during sleepovers, with a flashlight in your face and your kumot over your head. Within these pages, you will find tales of haunted houses, demon hunters, monster pop stars, and more. And though you may think them familiar, this is because these stories have been twisted to fit nicely into their niches within the strange East-meets-West collective psyche of Filipinos. Welcome to the darkness that feeds on Filipino nightmares. But remember… don’t let them inside the door.”\n\nSounds great, doesn’t it? And though I’ve no blurb on the YA book, I did manage to find the submission guidelines for authors trying to get into the pages of the collection:\n\n1. In the horror genre or contain strong horror elements\n\n2. Written with the Young Adult reader in mind (from 10 – 18 years old) and feature a young adult character (or characters)\n\n3. Cognizant of the themes and concerns of Young Adult fiction (coming of age, identity, belonging, a sense of wonder, a love for adventure, angst, concerns over school, challenges of youth, family issues, relationships to authority figures, sexuality, experimentation, peer pressure, bullying, among many others) – without being didactic and/or boring.\n\nSounds great to me! Go check it out."
