        "text": "The importance of expert feedback during endovascular simulator training.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoyle, Emily; O'Keeffe, Dara A; Naughton, Peter A; Hill, Arnold D K; McDonnell, Ciaran O; Moneley, Daragh\n\n2011-07-01\n\nComplex endovascular skills are difficult to obtain in the clinical environment. Virtual reality (VR) simulator training is a valuable addition to current training curricula, but is there a benefit in the absence of expert trainers? Eighteen endovascular novices performed a renal artery angioplasty/stenting (RAS) on the Vascular Interventional Surgical Trainer simulator. They were randomized into three groups: Group A (n = 6, control), no performance feedback; Group B (n = 6, nonexpert feedback), feedback after every procedure from a nonexpert facilitator; and Group C (n = 6, expert feedback), feedback after every procedure from a consultant vascular surgeon. Each trainee completed RAS six times. Simulator-measured performance metrics included procedural and fluoroscopy time, contrast volume, accuracy of balloon placement, and handling errors. Clinical errors were also measured by blinded video assessment. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 15. A clear learning curve was observed across the six trials. There were no significant differences between the three groups for the general performance metrics, but Group C made fewer errors than Groups A (P = .009) or B (P = .004). Video-based error assessment showed that Groups B and C performed better than Group A (P = .002 and P = .000, respectively). VR simulator training for novices can significantly improve general performance in the absence of expert trainers. Procedure-specific qualitative metrics are improved with expert feedback, but nonexpert facilitators can also enhance the quality of training and may represent a valuable alternative to expert clinical faculty.

These multidisciplinary interactions lead to challenges that are reflected in the high rate of errors occurring during endovascular procedures. Endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation has evolved from simple benchtop devices to full physic simulators with advanced haptics and dynamic imaging and physiological controls. The latest developments in this field include the use of fully immersive simulated hybrid angiosuites to train whole endovascular teams in crisis resource management and novel technologies that enable practitioners to build VR simulations based on patient-specific anatomy. As our understanding of the skills, both technical and nontechnical, required for optimal endovascular performance improves, the requisite tools for objective assessment of these skills are being developed and will further enable the use of VR simulation in the training and assessment of endovascular interventionalists and their entire teams. Simulation training that allows deliberate practice without danger to patients may be key to bridging the gap between new endovascular technology and improved patient outcomes.\n\nTargeting clinical outcomes: Endovascular simulation improves diagnostic coronary angiography skills.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchimmel, Daniel R; Sweis, Ranya; Cohen, Elaine R; Davidson, Charles; Wayne, Diane B\n\n2016-02-15\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the effects of simulation-based medical education (SBME) on the skills required to perform coronary angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiovascular fellows commonly learn invasive procedures on patients. Because this approach is not standardized, it can result in inconsistent skill acquisition through exclusion of concepts and skills. Also, the learning curve varies between trainees yielding variability in skill acquisition. Therefore, coronary angiography skills are an excellent target for SBME in an environment in which direct patient care is not jeopardized. From January 2013 to June 2013, 14 cardiovascular fellows entering the cardiac catheterization laboratory at a tertiary care teaching hospital were tested on an endovascular simulator to assess baseline skills. All fellows subsequently underwent didactic teaching and preceptor-lead training on the endovascular simulator. Topics included basic catheterization skills and a review of catheterization laboratory systems. Following training, all fellows underwent a post-training assessment on the endovascular simulator. Paired t tests were used to compare items on the skills checklist and simulator defined variables. Cardiovascular fellows scored significantly higher on a diagnostic coronary angiography skills checklist following SBME using an endovascular simulator. The mean pretest score was 66.6% (SD = 9.7%) compared to 86.0% (SD = 6.3%) following simulator training (P < 0.001). Additional findings include significant reduction in procedure time and use of cine-fluoroscopy at posttest. SBME significantly improved cardiovascular fellows' performance of simulated coronary angiography skills. Standardized simulation-based education is a valuable adjunct to traditional clinical education for cardiovascular fellows.

This study aimed to design a structured training program for endovascular skills and validate its assessment methods. A PROficiency-based StePwise Endovascular Curricular Training (PROSPECT) program was developed, consisting of e-learning and hands-on simulation modules, focusing on iliac and superficial femoral artery atherosclerotic disease. Construct validity was investigated. Performances were assessed using multiple-choice questionnaires, valid simulation parameters, global rating scorings, and examiner checklists. Feasibility was assessed by passage of 2 final-year medical students through this PROSPECT program. Ghent University Hospital, a tertiary clinical care and academic center in Belgium with general surgery residency program. Senior-year medical students were recruited at Ghent University Hospital. Vascular surgeons were invited to participate during conferences and meetings if they had performed at least 100 endovascular procedures as the primary operator during the last 2 years. Overall, 29 medical students and 20 vascular surgeons participated. Vascular surgeons obtained higher multiple-choice questionnaire scores (median: 24.5-22.0 vs. 15.0-12.0; p < 0.001). Students took significantly longer to treat any iliac or femoral artery stenosis (3.3-14.8 vs. 5.8-30.1min; p = 0.001-0.04), whereas in more complex cases, fluoroscopy time was significantly higher in students (8.3 vs. 21.3min; p = 0.002; 7.3 vs. 13.1min; p = 0.03). In all cases, vascular surgeons scored higher on global rating scorings (51.0-42.0 vs. 29.5-18.0; p < 0.001) and examiner checklist (81.5-75.0 vs. 54.5-43.0; p < 0.001). Hence, proficiency levels based on median expert scores could be determined. There were 2 students who completed the program and passed for each step within a 3-month period during\n\nSimulation and augmented reality in endovascular neurosurgery: lessons from aviation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMitha, Alim P; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Janjua, Major Jameel J; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEndovascular neurosurgery is a discipline strongly dependent on imaging. Therefore, technology that improves how much useful information we can garner from a single image has the potential to dramatically assist decision making during endovascular procedures. Furthermore, education in an image-enhanced environment, especially with the incorporation of simulation, can improve the safety of the procedures and give interventionalists and trainees the opportunity to study or perform simulated procedures before the intervention, much like what is practiced in the field of aviation. Here, we examine the use of simulators in the training of fighter pilots and discuss how similar benefits can compensate for current deficiencies in endovascular training. We describe the types of simulation used for endovascular procedures, including virtual reality, and discuss the relevant data on its utility in training. Finally, the benefit of augmented reality during endovascular procedures is discussed, along with future computerized image enhancement techniques.\n\nSkills training after night shift work enables acquisition of endovascular technical skills on a virtual reality simulator.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaughton, Peter A; Aggarwal, Rajesh; Wang, Tim T; Van Herzeele, Isabelle; Keeling, Aoife N; Darzi, Ara W; Cheshire, Nicholas J W\n\n2011-03-01\n\nAdoption of residents' working time restrictions potentially undermines surgical training by reduction of operating room exposure. Simulation has been proposed as a way to acquire necessary skills in a laboratory environment but remains difficult to incorporate into training schedules. This study assessed whether residents working successive nights could acquire endovascular skills similar to colleagues working day shifts. This prospective observational cohort study recruited 20 junior residents, divided into day shift and night shift groups by their respective call schedule. After initial cognitive skills training, a validated renal artery stent module on an endovascular simulator was completed over a series of seven sequential shifts during 1 week. The primary outcome measure was serial technical skill assessments. Secondary measures comprised assessments of activity, cognitive performance, introspective fatigue, quality, and quantity of preceding sleep. Both groups demonstrated significant learning curves for total time at the first session median vs seventh session median (181 vs 564 seconds [P < .001]; night, 1399 vs 572 [P < .001]), fluoroscopy time (day, 702 vs 308 seconds, [P < .001]; night, 669 vs 313 [P < .001]), and contrast volume (day, 29 vs 13 mL [P < .001]; night, 40 vs 16 [P < .001]). Residents working day shifts reached plateau 1 day earlier in the above measures vs those on night duty. The night shift group walked more steps (P < .001), reviewed more patients (P < .001), performed worse on all cognitive assessments (P < .05), slept less (P < .05), had poorer quality of sleep (P = .001), and was more fatigued (P < .001) than the day shift group. Acquired skill was retained a week after completion of shifts. Technical skills training after night shift work enables acquisition of endovascular technical skills, although it takes longer than after day shift training. This study provides evidence for program directors to organize simulation-based\n\nVisuospatial and psychomotor aptitude predicts endovascular performance of inexperienced individuals on a virtual reality simulator.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Herzeele, Isabelle; O'Donoghue, Kevin G L; Aggarwal, Rajesh; Vermassen, Frank; Darzi, Ara; Cheshire, Nicholas J W\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThis study evaluated virtual reality (VR) simulation for endovascular training of medical students to determine whether innate perceptual, visuospatial, and psychomotor aptitude (VSA) can predict initial and plateau phase of technical endovascular skills acquisition. Twenty medical students received didactic and endovascular training on a commercially available VR simulator. Each student treated a series of 10 identical noncomplex renal artery stenoses endovascularly. The simulator recorded performance data instantly and objectively. An experienced interventionalist rated the performance at the initial and final sessions using generic (out of 40) and procedure-specific (out of 30) rating scales. VSA were tested with fine motor dexterity (FMD, Perdue Pegboard), psychomotor ability (minimally invasive virtual reality surgical trainer [MIST-VR]), image recall (Rey-Osterrieth), and organizational aptitude (map-planning). VSA performance scores were correlated with the assessment parameters of endovascular skills at commencement and completion of training. Medical students exhibited statistically significant learning curves from the initial to the plateau performance for contrast usage (medians, 28 vs 17 mL, P < .001), total procedure time (2120 vs 867 seconds, P < .001), and fluoroscopy time (993 vs. 507 seconds, P < .001). Scores on generic and procedure-specific rating scales improved significantly (10 vs 25, P < .001; 8 vs 17 P < .001). Significant correlations were noted for FMD with initial and plateau sessions for fluoroscopy time (r(s) = -0.564, P = .010; r(s) = -.449, P = .047). FMD correlated with procedure-specific scores at the initial session (r(s) = .607, P = .006). Image recall correlated with generic skills at the end of training (r(s) = .587, P = .006). Simulator-based training in endovascular skills improved performance in medical students. There were significant correlations between initial endovascular skill and fine motor dexterity as well as with\n\nA Proficiency Based Stepwise Endovascular Curricular Training (PROSPECT) Program Enhances Operative Performance in Real Life: A Randomised Controlled Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaertens, H; Aggarwal, R; Moreels, N; Vermassen, F; Van Herzeele, I\n\n2017-09-01\n\nHealthcare evolution requires optimisation of surgical training to provide safe patient care. Operating room performance after completion of proficiency based training in vascular surgery has not been investigated. A randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of a Proficiency based Stepwise Endovascular Curricular Training program (PROSPECT) on the acquisition of endovascular skills and the transferability of these skills to real life interventions. All subjects performed two endovascular interventions treating patients with symptomatic iliac and/or superficial femoral artery stenosis under supervision. Primary outcomes were technical performances (Global Rating Scale [GRS]; Examiner Checklist), operative metrics, and patient outcomes, adjusted for case difficulty and trainee experience. Secondary outcomes included knowledge and technical performance after 6 weeks and 3 months. Thirty-two general surgical trainees were randomised into three groups. Besides traditional training, the first group (nÂ =Â 11) received e-learning and simulation training (PROSPECT), the second group (nÂ =Â 10) only had access to e-learning, while controls (nÂ =Â 11) did not receive supplementary training. Twenty-nine trainees (3 dropouts) performed 58 procedures. Trainees who completed PROSPECT showed superior technical performance (GRS 39.36Â Â±Â 2.05; Checklist 63.51Â Â±Â 3.18) in real life with significantly fewer supervisor takeovers compared with trainees receiving e-learning alone (GRS 28.42Â Â±Â 2.15; pÂ =Â .001; Checklist 53.63Â Â±Â 3.34; pÂ =Â .027) or traditional education (GRS 23.09Â Â±Â 2.18; pÂ =Â .001; Checklist 38.72Â Â±Â 3.38; pÂ =Â .001). Supervisors felt more confident in allowing PROSPECT trained physicians to perform basic (pÂ =Â .006) and complex (pÂ =Â .003) procedures. No differences were detected in procedural parameters (such as fluoroscopy time, DAP, procedure time, etc.) or complications. Proficiency levels were maintained up to 3 months.

Whilst there are initial promising medical applications of 3D printing, a lack of evidence to support its use remains a barrier for larger scale adoption into clinical practice. Endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation plays an important role in the safe training of future endovascular practitioners, but existing VR models have disadvantages including cost and accessibility which could be addressed with 3D printing. This study sought to evaluate the feasibility of 3D printing an anatomically accurate human aorta for the purposes of endovascular training. A 3D printed model was successfully designed and printed and used for endovascular simulation. The stages of development and practical applications are described. Feedback from 96 physicians who answered a series of questions using a 5 point Likert scale is presented. Initial data supports the value of 3D printed endovascular models although further educational validation is required.\n\nA simulator for training in endovascular aneurysm repair: The use of three dimensional printers.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorres, I O; De Luccia, N\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo develop an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) simulation system using three dimensional (3D) printed aneurysms, and to evaluate the impact of patient specific training prior to EVAR on the surgical performance of vascular surgery residents in a university hospital in Brazil. This was a prospective, controlled, single centre study. During 2015, the aneurysms of patients undergoing elective EVAR at SÃ£o Paulo University Medical School were 3D printed and used in training sessions with vascular surgery residents. The 3D printers Stratasys-Connex 350, Formlabs-Form1+, and Makerbot were tested. Ten residents were enrolled in the control group (five residents and 30 patients in 2014) or the training group (five residents and 25 patients in 2015). The control group performed the surgery under the supervision of a senior vascular surgeon (routine procedure, without simulator training). The training group practised the surgery in a patient specific simulator prior to the routine procedure. Objective parameters were analysed, and a subjective questionnaire addressing training utility and realism was answered. Patient specific training reduced fluoroscopy time by 30% (mean 48Â min, 95% confidence interval [CI] 40-58 vs. 33Â min, 95% CI 26-42 [pÂ <Â .01]), total procedure time by 29% (mean 292Â min [95% CI 235-336] vs. 207 [95% CI 173-247]; pÂ <Â .01), and volume of contrast used by 25% (mean 87Â mL [95% CI 73-103] vs. 65Â mL [95% CI 52-81]; pÂ =Â .02). The residents considered the training useful and realistic, and reported that it increased their self confidence. The 3D printers Form1+ (using flexible resin) and Makerbot (using silicone) provided the best performance based on simulator quality and cost. An EVAR simulation system using 3D printed aneurysms was feasible. The best results were obtained with the 3D printers Form1+ (using flexible resin) and Makerbot (using silicone). Patient specific training prior to EVAR at a university hospital in Brazil improved\n\nTraining in endovascular surgical neuroradiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrozyk, Dorothea; Hanft, Simon J; Kellner, Christopher P; Meyers, Phil M; Lavine, Sean D\n\n2010-07-01\n\nDuring the past few years, the field of endovascular surgical neuroradiology has been expanding. Neurosurgeons, radiologists, and neurologists are currently being trained. We analyzed data from a national survey of endovascular training programs to assess the current training status and future projections. Survey participation requests were sent out to program directors and members of the Society of Endovascular Neurosurgery, the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery, and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology. The format was an on-line survey designed by the authors, and completed through the SurveyMonkey.com website. Forty-three programs were identified and invited to participate. We achieved a response rate of 81% (n = 35). Twenty-seven (79%) of the 35 respondents listed their training program as academic, and 7 (20%) listed it as a mixture of academic with private practice. The training program faculty consisted of 57 radiologists, 39 neurosurgeons, and 10 neurologists. Length of fellowship offered was the same for all specialties in 43%, and differed based on clinical experience/background in 51%. Of the programs, 86% offered a 2-year fellowship, 49% had a mandatory resident rotation, 17% offered an infolded complete fellowship for residents, and 34% offered an infolded partial fellowship. Only 9% reported no resident exposure at all. There were 12% of respondents who reported to have knowledge of vascular surgeons or cardiologists performing intracranial procedures. At the time of the survey, there were 68 fellows in training, and most entered training immediately after residency (38%), whereas 26% entered after a fellowship and another 26% trained while in residency. There will be a 14% increase of graduates within the next 5 years. Comparing the past 5 years (2003-2007) with future 5-year projections (2008-2012), the number of radiologists is declining by 37% (73 vs. 46), whereas the number of neurosurgeons (74 vs. 106) and neurologists (20\n\nHuman Thiel-Embalmed Cadaveric Aortic Model with Perfusion for Endovascular Intervention Training and Medical Device Evaluation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcLeod, Helen; Cox, Ben F; Robertson, James; Duncan, Robyn; Matthew, Shona; Bhat, Raj; Barclay, Avril; Anwar, J; Wilkinson, Tracey; Melzer, Andreas; Houston, J Graeme\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to evaluate human Thiel-embalmed cadavers with the addition of extracorporeal driven ante-grade pulsatile flow in the aorta as a model for simulation training in interventional techniques and endovascular device testing. Three human cadavers embalmed according to the method of Thiel were selected. Extracorporeal pulsatile ante-grade flow of 2.5 L per min was delivered directly into the aorta of the cadavers via a surgically placed connection. During perfusion, aortic pressure and temperature were recorded and optimized for physiologically similar parameters. Pre- and post-procedure CT imaging was conducted to plan and follow up thoracic and abdominal endovascular aortic repair as it would be in a clinical scenario. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and endovascular abdominal repair (EVAR) procedures were conducted in simulation of a clinical case, under fluoroscopic guidance with a multidisciplinary team present. The Thiel cadaveric aortic perfusion model provided pulsatile ante-grade flow, with pressure and temperature, sufficient to conduct a realistic simulation of TEVAR and EVAR procedures. Fluoroscopic imaging provided guidance during the intervention. Pre- and post-procedure CT imaging facilitated planning and follow-up evaluation of the procedure. The human Thiel-embalmed cadavers with the addition of extracorporeal flow within the aorta offer an anatomically appropriate, physiologically similar robust model to simulate aortic endovascular procedures, with potential applications in interventional radiology training and medical device testing as a pre-clinical model.\n\nStandards for Endovascular Neurosurgical Training and Certification of the Society of Korean Endovascular Neurosurgeons 2013\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShin, Dong-Seong; Park, Sukh-Que; Kang, Hyun-Seung; Yoon, Seok-Mann; Cho, Jae-Hoon; Lim, Dong-Jun; Baik, Min-Woo; Kwon, O Ki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe need for standard endovascular neurosurgical (ENS) training programs and certification in Korea cannot be overlooked due to the increasing number of ENS specialists and the expanding ENS field. The Society of Korean Endovascular Neurosurgeons (SKEN) Certification Committee has prepared training programs and certification since 2010, and the first certificates were issued in 2013. A task force team (TFT) was organized in August 2010 to develop training programs and certification. TFT members researched programs and systems in other countries to develop a program that best suited Korea. After 2 years, a rough draft of the ENS training and certification regulations were prepared, and the standard training program title was decided. The SKEN Certification Committee made an official announcement about the certification program in March 2013. The final certification regulations comprised three major parts: certified endovascular neurosurgeons (EN), certified ENS institutions, and certified ENS training institutions. Applications have been evaluated and the results were announced in June 2013 as follows: 126 members received EN certification and 55 hospitals became ENS-certified institutions. The SKEN has established standard ENS training programs together with a certification system, and it is expected that they will advance the field of ENS to enhance public health and safety in Korea.

In the case of endovascular intervention, it is desirable that a simulator accurately recreates the morphology and mechanical characteristics of the vasculature while enabling scoring. For this purpose, we propose a cyber-physical system composed of optical sensors for a catheter's body motion encoding, a magnetic tracker for motion capture of an operator's hands, and opto-mechatronic sensors for measuring the interaction of the catheter tip with the vasculature model wall. Two pilot studies were conducted for measuring technical skills, one for distinguishing novices from experts and the other for measuring unnecessary motion. The proficiency levels were measurable between expert and novice and also between individual novice users. The results enabled scoring of the user's proficiency level, using sensitivity, reaction time, time to complete a task and respect for tissue integrity as evaluation criteria. Additionally, unnecessary motion was also measurable. The development of cyber-physical simulators for other domains of medicine depend on the study of photoelastic materials for human tissue modelling, and enables quantitative evaluation of skills using surgical instruments and a realistic representation of human tissue.

The operator for this therapy has to obtain a license as a specialist in endovascular procedures. For neurologists wishing to acquire this license, there are two kinds of training programs: full-time training and concurrent training. Full-time training was chosen by the first author of this review, while concurrent training will be performed by staff in the author's department. The advantage of full-time training is the acquisition of a lot of experience of various diseases that are treated with endovascular procedures and managed in the periprocedural period. However, full-time training has the disadvantages of a requirement to discontinue medical care of neurological diseases except for stroke and employment at a remote institution. The advantages and disadvantages of concurrent training are the reverse of those of full-time training. Neither training system can succeed without cooperation from Departments of Neurology in neighboring universities and the institutional Department of Neurosurgery. It is particularly important for each neurologist to establish a goal of becoming an operator for recanalization therapy alone or for all fields of endovascular procedures because training will differ for attainment of each operator's goal.\n\nSimulation-Based Bronchoscopy Training\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKennedy, Cassie C.; Maldonado, Fabien\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground: Simulation-based bronchoscopy training is increasingly used, but effectiveness remains uncertain. We sought to perform a comprehensive synthesis of published work on simulation-based bronchoscopy training. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science, and Scopus for eligible articles through May 11, 2011. We included all original studies involving health professionals that evaluated, in comparison with no intervention or an alternative instructional approach, simulation-based training for flexible or rigid bronchoscopy. Study selection and data abstraction were performed independently and in duplicate. We pooled results using random effects meta-analysis. Results: From an initial pool of 10,903 articles, we identified 17 studies evaluating simulation-based bronchoscopy training. In comparison with no intervention, simulation training was associated with large benefits on skills and behaviors (pooled effect size, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.82-1.60]; n = 8 studies) and moderate benefits on time (0.62 [95% CI, 0.12-1.13]; n = 7). In comparison with clinical instruction, behaviors with real patients showed nonsignificant effects favoring simulation for time (0.61 [95% CI, â1.47 to 2.69]) and process (0.33 [95% CI, â1.46 to 2.11]) outcomes (n = 2 studies each), although variation in training time might account for these differences. Four studies compared alternate simulation-based training approaches. Inductive analysis to inform instructional design suggested that longer or more structured training is more effective, authentic clinical context adds value, and animal models and plastic part-task models may be superior to more costly virtual-reality simulators. Conclusions: Simulation-based bronchoscopy training is effective in comparison with no intervention. Comparative effectiveness studies are few.

Determining who has sufficient expertise for safe and effective clinical use remains elusive. Our aim was to analyze performance on a robotic platform to determine what defines an expert user. During three sessions, 21 subjects with a range of endovascular expertise and endovascular robotic experience (novices <2 hours to moderate-extensive experience with >20 hours) performed four tasks on a training model. All participants completed a 2-hour training session on the robot by a certified instructor. Completion times, global rating scores, and motion metrics were collected to assess performance. Electromagnetic tracking was used to capture and to analyze catheter tip motion. Motion analysis was based on derivations of speed and position including spectral arc length and total number of submovements (inversely proportional to proficiency of motion) and duration of submovements (directly proportional to proficiency). Ninety-eight percent of competent subjects successfully completed the tasks within the given time, whereas 91% of noncompetent subjects were successful. There was no significant difference in completion times between competent and noncompetent users except for the posterior branch (151 s:105 s; P = .01). The competent users had more efficient motion as evidenced by statistically significant differences in the metrics of motion analysis. Users with >20 hours of experience performed significantly better than those newer to the system, independent of prior endovascular experience. This study demonstrates that motion-based metrics can differentiate novice from trained users of flexible robotics systems for basic endovascular tasks. Efficiency of catheter movement, consistency of performance, and learning curves may help identify users who are sufficiently trained for safe clinical use of the system.

Photoelastic stress analysis can be used in human tissue modeling materials; this enables the development of simulators that measure respect for tissue. For applying this to endovascular surgery, first we present a model of saccular aneurism where stress variation during micro-coils deployment is measured, and then relying on a bi-planar vision system we measure a catheter trajectory and compare it to a reference trajectory considering respect for tissue. New photoelastic tissue modeling materials will expand the applications of this technology to other medical training domains.\n\nA National Needs Assessment to Identify Technical Procedures in Vascular Surgery for Simulation Based Training.\n\nPubMed\n\nNayahangan, L J; Konge, L; Schroeder, T V; Paltved, C; Lindorff-Larsen, K G; Nielsen, B U; Eiberg, J P\n\n2017-04-01\n\nPractical skills training in vascular surgery is facing challenges because of an increased number of endovascular procedures and fewer open procedures, as well as a move away from the traditional principle of \"learning by doing.\" This change has established simulation as a cornerstone in providing trainees with the necessary skills and competences. However, the development of simulation based programs often evolves based on available resources and equipment, reflecting convenience rather than a systematic educational plan. The objective of the present study was to perform a national needs assessment to identify the technical procedures that should be integrated in a simulation based curriculum. A national needs assessment using a Delphi process was initiated by engaging 33 predefined key persons in vascular surgery. Round 1 was a brainstorming phase to identify technical procedures that vascular surgeons should learn. Round 2 was a survey that used a needs assessment formula to explore the frequency of procedures, the number of surgeons performing each procedure, risk and/or discomfort, and feasibility for simulation based training. Round 3 involved elimination and ranking of procedures. The response rate for round 1 was 70%, with 36 procedures identified. Round 2 had a 76% response rate and resulted in a preliminary prioritised list after exploring the need for simulation based training. Round 3 had an 85% response rate; 17 procedures were eliminated, resulting in a final prioritised list of 19 technical procedures. A national needs assessment using a standardised Delphi method identified a list of procedures that are highly suitable and may provide the basis for future simulation based training programs for vascular surgeons in training.

Over the course of 30 days, five trainees performed 10 diagnostic angiograms, coiled 10 carotid terminus aneurysms in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and performed 10 left middle cerebral artery embolectomies on a Simbionix Angio Mentorâ¢ simulator. All procedures were nonconsecutive. Total procedure time, fluoroscopy time, contrast dose, heart rate, blood pressures, medications administered, packing densities, theÂ number of coils used, and theÂ number of stent-retriever passes were recorded.Â Image quality was rated, and the absolute value of technically unsafe events was recorded. The trainees' device selection, macrovascular access, microvascular access, clinical management, and the overall performance of the trainee was rated during each procedure based on a traditional Likert scale score of 1=fail, 2=poor, 3=satisfactory, 4=good, and 5=excellent.Â These ordinal values correspond with published assessment scales on surgical technique. After performing five diagnostic angiograms and five embolectomies, all participants demonstrated marked decreases in procedure time, fluoroscopy doses, contrast doses, and adverse technical events; marked improvements in image quality, device selection, access scores, and overall technical performance were additionally observed (p < 0.05). Similarly, trainees demonstrated marked improvement in technical performance and clinical management after five coiling procedures (p < 0.05). However, trainees with less prior experience deploying coils continued to experience intra-procedural ruptures up to the eighth embolization procedure; this observation likely corresponded with less tactile procedural experience to an exertion of greater force than appropriate for coil placement.

Cost data extracted from a previous experiment was used to perform a financial analysis according to the guidelines published by the National Institutes of Health. The analysis compared the purchase or rental of a Procedicus Vascular Interventional System Trainer to the rental of an animal laboratory. The VR laboratory course cost $3,434 per trainee versus $4,634 in the animal laboratory according to the purchase-versus-rental analysis. The cost ratio was 0.74 in favor of the VR laboratory. Cost ratio sensitivity analysis ranged from 0.25 in favor of the VR laboratory to 2.22 in favor of the animal laboratory. The first-year potential savings were $62,410 assuming exclusive use of the VR laboratory. The 5-year training savings totaled $390,376, excluding the $60,000 residual value of the simulator. Simulator rental reduced the course price to $1,076 per trainee and lowered the cost ratio to 0.23 in favor of the VR laboratory. Findings of sensitivity analysis ranged from 0.08 to 0.70 in favor of the VR laboratory. The first-year and 5-year potential national savings increased to $185,026 and $1,013,238, respectively. Although evidence remains sparse that the training of interventional skills in artificial environments translates to better performance in human procedures, there are good pedagogic grounds on which to believe that such training will become increasingly important. The present comparison of the direct costs of two such models suggests that VR training is less expensive than live animal training.\n\nSimulation-Based Training for Colonoscopy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPreisler, Louise; Svendsen, Morten Bo SÃ¸ndergaard; Nerup, Nikolaj; Svendsen, Lars Bo; Konge, Lars\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract The aim of this study was to create simulation-based tests with credible pass/fail standards for 2 different fidelities of colonoscopy models. Only competent practitioners should perform colonoscopy. Reliable and valid simulation-based tests could be used to establish basic competency in colonoscopy before practicing on patients. Twenty-five physicians (10 consultants with endoscopic experience and 15 fellows with very little endoscopic experience) were tested on 2 different simulator models: a virtual-reality simulator and a physical model. Tests were repeated twice on each simulator model. Metrics with discriminatory ability were identified for both modalities and reliability was determined. The contrasting-groups method was used to create pass/fail standards and the consequences of these were explored. The consultants significantly performed faster and scored higher than the fellows on both the models (Pâ<â0.001). Reliability analysis showed Cronbach Î±â=â0.80 and 0.87 for the virtual-reality and the physical model, respectively. The established pass/fail standards failed one of the consultants (virtual-reality simulator) and allowed one fellow to pass (physical model). The 2 tested simulations-based modalities provided reliable and valid assessments of competence in colonoscopy and credible pass/fail standards were established for both the tests. We propose to use these standards in simulation-based training programs before proceeding to supervised training on patients.

The Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Simulation Committee developed a simulation-based curriculum incorporating VR simulators to train residents in the management of common neurosurgical disorders. To enhance neurosurgical resident training for ventriculostomy placement using simulation-based training. A course-based neurosurgical simulation curriculum was introduced at the Neurosurgical Simulation Symposium at the 2011 and 2012 CNS annual meetings. A trauma module was developed to teach ventriculostomy placement as one of the neurosurgical procedures commonly performed in the management of traumatic brain injury. The course offered both didactic and simulator-based instruction, incorporating written and practical pretests and posttests and questionnaires to assess improvement in skill level and to validate the simulators as teaching tools. Fourteen trainees participated in the didactic component of the trauma module. Written scores improved significantly from pretest (75%) to posttest (87.5%; P < .05). Seven participants completed the ventriculostomy simulation. Significant improvements were observed in anatomy (P < .04), burr hole placement (P < .03), final location of the catheter (P = .05), and procedure completion time (P < .004). Senior residents planned a significantly better trajectory (P < .01); junior participants improved most in terms of identifying the relevant anatomy (P < .03) and the time required to complete the procedure (P < .04). VR ventriculostomy placement as part of the CNS simulation trauma module complements standard training techniques for residents in the management of neurosurgical trauma. Improvement in didactic and hands-on knowledge by course participants demonstrates the usefulness of the VR simulator as a training tool.\n\nSimulation-based bronchoscopy training: systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKennedy, Cassie C; Maldonado, Fabien; Cook, David A\n\n2013-07-01\n\nSimulation-based bronchoscopy training is increasingly used, but effectiveness remains uncertain. We sought to perform a comprehensive synthesis of published work on simulation-based bronchoscopy training. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science, and Scopus for eligible articles through May 11, 2011. We included all original studies involving health professionals that evaluated, in comparison with no intervention or an alternative instructional approach, simulation-based training for flexible or rigid bronchoscopy. Study selection and data abstraction were performed independently and in duplicate. We pooled results using random effects meta-analysis. From an initial pool of 10,903 articles, we identified 17 studies evaluating simulation-based bronchoscopy training. In comparison with no intervention, simulation training was associated with large benefits on skills and behaviors (pooled effect size, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.82-1.60]; n=8 studies) and moderate benefits on time (0.62 [95% CI, 0.12-1.13]; n=7). In comparison with clinical instruction, behaviors with real patients showed nonsignificant effects favoring simulation for time (0.61 [95% CI, -1.47 to 2.69]) and process (0.33 [95% CI, -1.46 to 2.11]) outcomes (n=2 studies each), although variation in training time might account for these differences. Four studies compared alternate simulation-based training approaches. Inductive analysis to inform instructional design suggested that longer or more structured training is more effective, authentic clinical context adds value, and animal models and plastic part-task models may be superior to more costly virtual-reality simulators. Simulation-based bronchoscopy training is effective in comparison with no intervention. Comparative effectiveness studies are few.\n\n[Endovascular surgery in the war].\n\nPubMed\n\nReva, V A; Samokhvalov, I M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRapid growth of medical technologies has led to implementation of endovascular methods of diagnosis and treatment into rapidly developing battlefield surgery. This work based on analysing all available current publications generalizes the data on using endovascular surgery in combat vascular injury. During the Korean war (1950-1953) American surgeons for the first time performed endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta - the first intravascular intervention carried out in a zone of combat operations. Half a century thereafter, with the beginning of the war in Afghanistan (2001) and in Iraq (2003) surgeons of central hospitals of the USA Armed Forces began performing delayed endovascular operations to the wounded. The development of technologies, advent of mobile angiographs made it possible to later on implement high-tech endovascular interventions in a zone of combat operations. At first, more often they performed implantation of cava filters, somewhat afterward - angioembolization of damaged accessory vessels, stenting and endovascular repair of major arteries. The first in the theatre of war endovascular prosthetic repair of the thoracic aorta for severe closed injury was performed in 2008. Russian experience of using endovascular surgery in combat injuries is limited to diagnostic angiography and regional intraarterial perfusion. Despite the advent of stationary angiographs in large hospitals of the RF Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s, endovascular operations for combat vascular injury are casuistic. Foreign experience in active implementation of endovascular technologies to treatment of war-time injuries has substantiated feasibility of using intravascular interventions in tertiary care military hospitals. Carrying out basic training courses on endovascular surgery should become an organic part of preparing multimodality general battlefield surgeons rendering care on the theatre of combat operations.\n\nSystematic review of skills transfer after surgical simulation-based training.\n\nPubMed\n\nDawe, S R; Pena, G N; Windsor, J A; Broeders, J A J L; Cregan, P C; Hewett, P J; Maddern, G J\n\n2014-08-01\n\nSimulation-based training assumes that skills are directly transferable to the patient-based setting, but few studies have correlated simulated performance with surgical performance. A systematic search strategy was undertaken to find studies published since the last systematic review, published in 2007. Inclusion of articles was determined using a predetermined protocol, independent assessment by two reviewers and a final consensus decision. Studies that reported on the use of surgical simulation-based training and assessed the transferability of the acquired skills to a patient-based setting were included. Twenty-seven randomized clinical trials and seven non-randomized comparative studies were included. Fourteen studies investigated laparoscopic procedures, 13 endoscopic procedures and seven other procedures. These studies provided strong evidence that participants who reached proficiency in simulation-based training performed better in the patient-based setting than their counterparts who did not have simulation-based training. Simulation-based training was equally as effective as patient-based training for colonoscopy, laparoscopic camera navigation and endoscopic sinus surgery in the patient-based setting. These studies strengthen the evidence that simulation-based training, as part of a structured programme and incorporating predetermined proficiency levels, results in skills transfer to the operative setting.

However, its effect on registered nurses has previously not been established in systematic reviews. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate effect of simulation-based training on nurses' skills and knowledge. We searched CDSR, DARE, HTA, CENTRAL, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, and SveMed+ for randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating effect of simulation-based training among nurses. Searches were completed in December 2016. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-text, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We compared simulation-based training to other learning strategies, high-fidelity simulation to other simulation strategies, and different organisation of simulation training. Data were analysed through meta-analysis and narrative syntheses. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence. Fifteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. For the comparison of simulation-based training to other learning strategies on nurses' skills, six studies in the meta-analysis showed a significant, but small effect in favour of simulation (SMD -1.09, CI -1.72 to -0.47). There was large heterogeneity (I 2 85%). For the other comparisons, there was large between-study variation in results. The quality of evidence for all comparisons was graded as low. The effect of simulation-based training varies substantially between studies. Our meta-analysis showed a significant effect of simulation training compared to other learning strategies, but the quality of evidence was low indicating uncertainty. Other comparisons showed inconsistency in results. Based on our findings simulation training appears to be an effective strategy to improve nurses' skills, but further good-quality RCTs with adequate sample sizes are needed.

Simulation is the main method of training in addition to clinical patient care. Access to cadaver-based training is limited due to cost and availability. The relative fidelity and perceived value of cadaver-based simulation training is unknown. This pilot study sought to describe the relative value of cadaver training compared to simulation for cricothyrotomy and tube thoracostomy. To perform a pilot study to assess whether there is a significant difference in fidelity and educational experience of cadaver-based training compared to simulation training. To understand how important this difference is in training residents in low-frequency procedures. Twenty-two senior EM residents (PGY3 and 4) who had completed standard simulation training on cricothyrotomy and tube thoracostomy participated in a formalin-fixed cadaver training program. Participants were surveyed on the relative fidelity of the training using a 100 point visual analogue scale (VAS) with 100 defined as equal to performing the procedure on a real patient. Respondents were also asked to estimate how much the cadaveric training improved the comfort level with performing the procedures on a scale between 0 and 100Â %. Open-response feedback was also collected. The response rate was 100Â % (22/22). The average fidelity of the cadaver versus simulation training was 79.9Â Â±Â 7.0 vs. 34.7Â Â±Â 13.4 for cricothyrotomy (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and 86Â Â±Â 8.6 vs. 38.4Â Â±Â 19.3 for tube thoracostomy (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Improvement in comfort levels performing procedures after the cadaveric training was rated as 78.5Â Â±Â 13.3 for tube thoracostomy and 78.7Â Â±Â 14.3 for cricothyrotomy. All respondents felt this difference in fidelity to be important for procedural training with 21/22 respondents specifically citing the importance of superior landmark and tissue fidelity compared to\n\nDesign of a cost-effective, hemodynamically adjustable model for resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) simulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeller, Benjamin A; Salcedo, Edgardo S; Williams, Timothy K; Neff, Lucas P; Carden, Anthony J; Li, Yiran; Gotlib, Oren; Tran, Nam K; Galante, Joseph M\n\n2016-09-01\n\nResuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an adjunct technique for salvaging patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage. Current REBOA training paradigms require large animals, virtual reality simulators, or human cadavers for acquisition of skills. These training strategies are expensive and resource intensive, which may prevent widespread dissemination of REBOA. We have developed a low-cost, near-physiologic, pulsatile REBOA simulator by connecting an anatomic vascular circuit constructed out of latex and polyvinyl chloride tubing to a commercially available pump. This pulsatile simulator is capable of generating cardiac outputs ranging from 1.7 to 6.8 L/min with corresponding arterial blood pressures of 54 to 226/14 to 121 mmHg. The simulator accommodates a 12 French introducer sheath and a CODA balloon catheter. Upon balloon inflation, the arterial waveform distal to the occlusion flattens, distal pulsation within the simulator is lost, and systolic blood pressures proximal to the balloon catheter increase by up to 62 mmHg. Further development and validation of this simulator will allow for refinement, reduction, and replacement of large animal models, costly virtual reality simulators, and perfused cadavers for training purposes. This will ultimately facilitate the low-cost, high-fidelity REBOA simulation needed for the widespread dissemination of this life-saving technique.\n\nEndovascular Broad-Neck Aneurysm Creation in a Porcine Model Using a Vascular Plug\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMuehlenbruch, Georg, E-mail: gmuehlenbruch@ukaachen.de; Nikoubashman, Omid; Steffen, Bjoern\n\n2013-02-15\n\nRuptured cerebral arterial aneurysms require prompt treatment by either surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Training for these sophisticated endovascular procedures is essential and ideally performed in animals before their use in humans. Simulators and established animal models have shown drawbacks with respect to degree of reality, size of the animal model and aneurysm, or time and effort needed for aneurysm creation. We therefore aimed to establish a realistic and readily available aneurysm model. Five anticoagulated domestic pigs underwent endovascular intervention through right femoral access. A total of 12 broad-neck aneurysms were created in the carotid, subclavian, and renal arteries usingmoreÂ Â» the Amplatzer vascular plug. With dedicated vessel selection, cubic, tubular, and side-branch aneurysms could be created. Three of the 12 implanted occluders, two of them implanted over a side branch of the main vessel, did not induce complete vessel occlusion. However, all aneurysms remained free of intraluminal thrombus formation and were available for embolization training during a surveillance period of 6 h. Two aneurysms underwent successful exemplary treatment: one was stent-assisted, and one was performed with conventional endovascular coil embolization. The new porcine aneurysm model proved to be a straightforward approach that offers a wide range of training and scientific applications that might help further improve endovascular coil embolization therapy in patients with cerebral aneurysms.Â«Â less\n\nSetting Up a Stroke Team Algorithm and Conducting Simulation-based Training in the Emergency Department - A Practical Guide.\n\nPubMed\n\nTahtali, Damla; Bohmann, Ferdinand; Rostek, Peter; Wagner, Marlies; Steinmetz, Helmuth; Pfeilschifter, Waltraud\n\n2017-01-15\n\nTime is of the essence when caring for an acute stroke patient. The ultimate goal is to restore blood flow to the ischemic brain. This can beÂ achieved by eitherÂ thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA), the standard therapy for stroke patients who present within the first hours of symptom onset without contraindications, or by an endovascular approach, if a proximal brain vessel occlusion is detected. As the efficacy of both therapies declines over time, every minute saved along the way will improve the patient's outcome. This critical situation requires thorough work and precise communication with the patient, the family and colleagues from different professions to acquire all relevant information and reach the right decision while carefully monitoring the patient. This is a high fidelity situation. In nonmedical high-fidelity environments such as aviation, Crew Resource Management (CRM) is used to enhance safety and team efficiency. This guide shows how a Stroke Team algorithm, which is transferable to other hospital settings, was established and how regular simulation-based trainings were performed. It requires determination and endurance to maintain these time-consuming simulation trainings on a regular basis over the course of time. However, the resulting improvement of team spirit and excellent door-to-needle times will benefit both the patients and the work environment in any hospital. A dedicated Stroke Team of 7 persons who are notified 24/7 by a collective call via speed dial and run a binding algorithm that takes approximately 20 min, was established. To train everybody involved in this algorithm, a simulation-based team training for all new Stroke Team members was conceived and conducted at monthly intervals. This led to a relevant and sustained reduction of the mean door-to-needle time to 25 min, and enhanced the feeling of stroke readiness especially in junior doctors and nurses.\n\n[Development of fixed-base full task space flight training simulator].\n\nPubMed\n\nXue, Liang; Chen, Shan-quang; Chang, Tian-chun; Yang, Hong; Chao, Jian-gang; Li, Zhi-peng\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFixed-base full task flight training simulator is a very critical and important integrated training facility. It is mostly used in training of integrated skills and tasks, such as running the flight program of manned space flight, dealing with faults, operating and controlling spacecraft flight, communicating information between spacecraft and ground. This simulator was made up of several subentries including spacecraft simulation, simulating cabin, sight image, acoustics, main controlling computer, instructor and assistant support. It has implemented many simulation functions, such as spacecraft environment, spacecraft movement, communicating information between spacecraft and ground, typical faults, manual control and operating training, training control, training monitor, training database management, training data recording, system detecting and so on.\n\nSimulation training: a systematic review of simulation in arthroscopy and proposal of a new competency-based training framework.\n\nPubMed\n\nTay, Charison; Khajuria, Ankur; Gupte, Chinmay\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTraditional orthopaedic training has followed an apprenticeship model whereby trainees enhance their skills by operating under guidance. However the introduction of limitations on training hours and shorter training programmes mean that alternative training strategies are required. To perform a literature review on simulation training in arthroscopy and devise a framework that structures different simulation techniques that could be used in arthroscopic training. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Databases were performed. Search terms included \"virtual reality OR simulator OR simulation\" and \"arthroscopy OR arthroscopic\". 14 studies evaluating simulators in knee, shoulder and hip arthroplasty were included. The majority of the studies demonstrated construct and transference validity but only one showed concurrent validity. More studies are required to assess its potential as a training and assessment tool, skills transference between simulators and to determine the extent of skills decay from prolonged delays in training. We also devised a \"ladder of arthroscopic simulation\" that provides a competency-based framework to implement different simulation strategies. The incorporation of simulation into an orthopaedic curriculum will depend on a coordinated approach between many bodies. But the successful integration of simulators in other areas of surgery supports a possible role for simulation in advancing orthopaedic education. Copyright Â© 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd.

The inside of silicone replica is required to be smooth for manipulating interventional devices without resistance. In this report, we demonstrate the fabrication of patient-specific silicone vessels with a low-cost desktop 3D printer. We show that the surface of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) model printed by the 3D printer can be smoothed by a single dipping in ABS solvent in a time-dependent manner, where a short dip has less effect on the shape of the model. The vascular mold is coated with transparent silicone and then the ABS mold is dissolved after the silicone is cured. Interventional devices can pass through the inside of the smoothed silicone vessel with lower pushing force compared to the vessel without smoothing. The material cost and time required to fabricate the silicone vessel is about USD $2 and 24âh, which is much lower than the current fabrication methods. This fast and low-cost method offers the possibility of testing strategies before attempting particularly difficult cases, while improving the training of endovascular therapy, enabling the trialing of new devices, and broadening the scope of vascular research.\n\nSimulation-based interpersonal communication skills training for neurosurgical residents.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarnof, Sagi; Hadani, Moshe; Ziv, Amitai; Berkenstadt, Haim\n\n2013-09-01\n\nCommunication skills are an important component of the neurosurgery residency training program. We developed a simulation-based training module for neurosurgery residents in which medical, communication and ethical dilemmas are presented by role-playing actors. To assess the first national simulation-based communication skills training for neurosurgical residents. Eight scenarios covering different aspects of neurosurgery were developed by our team: (1) obtaining informed consent for an elective surgery, (2) discharge of a patient following elective surgery, (3) dealing with an unsatisfied patient, (4) delivering news of intraoperative complications, (5) delivering news of a brain tumor to parents of a 5 year old boy, (6) delivering news of brain death to a family member, (7) obtaining informed consent for urgent surgery from the grandfather of a 7 year old boy with an epidural hematoma, and (8) dealing with a case of child abuse. Fifteen neurosurgery residents from all major medical centers in Israel participated in the training. The session was recorded on video and was followed by videotaped debriefing by a senior neurosurgeon and communication expert and by feedback questionnaires. All trainees participated in two scenarios and observed another two. Participants largely agreed that the actors simulating patients represented real patients and family members and that the videotaped debriefing contributed to the teaching of professional skills. Simulation-based communication skill training is effective, and together with thorough debriefing is an excellent learning and practical method for imparting communication skills to neurosurgery residents. Such simulation-based training will ultimately be part of the national residency program.\n\nCompetency-Based Training and Simulation: Making a \"Valid\" Argument.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoureldin, Yasser A; Lee, Jason Y; McDougall, Elspeth M; Sweet, Robert M\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe use of simulation as an assessment tool is much more controversial than is its utility as an educational tool. However, without valid simulation-based assessment tools, the ability to objectively assess technical skill competencies in a competency-based medical education framework will remain challenging. The current literature in urologic simulation-based training and assessment uses a definition and framework of validity that is now outdated. This is probably due to the absence of awareness rather than an absence of comprehension. The following review article provides the urologic community an updated taxonomy on validity theory as it relates to simulation-based training and assessments and translates our simulation literature to date into this framework. While the old taxonomy considered validity as distinct subcategories and focused on the simulator itself, the modern taxonomy, for which we translate the literature evidence, considers validity as a unitary construct with a focus on interpretation of simulator data/scores.\n\nDetermining procedures for simulation-based training in radiology: a nationwide needs assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nNayahangan, Leizl Joy; Nielsen, Kristina Rue; Albrecht-Beste, Elisabeth; Bachmann Nielsen, Michael; Paltved, Charlotte; Lindorff-Larsen, Karen Gilboe; Nielsen, BjÃ¸rn Ulrik; Konge, Lars\n\n2018-06-01\n\nNew training modalities such as simulation are widely accepted in radiology; however, development of effective simulation-based training programs is challenging. They are often unstructured and based on convenience or coincidence. The study objective was to perform a nationwide needs assessment to identify and prioritize technical procedures that should be included in a simulation-based curriculum. A needs assessment using the Delphi method was completed among 91 key leaders in radiology. Round 1 identified technical procedures that radiologists should learn. Round 2 explored frequency of procedure, number of radiologists performing the procedure, risk and/or discomfort for patients, and feasibility for simulation. Round 3 was elimination and prioritization of procedures. Response rates were 67 %, 70 % and 66 %, respectively. In Round 1, 22 technical procedures were included. Round 2 resulted in pre-prioritization of procedures. In round 3, 13 procedures were included in the final prioritized list.

Simulation-based training assumes that skills are directly transferable to the operation room, but only a few studies have investigated the effect of simulation-based training on surgical performance. A systematic search strategy that was used in 2006 was updated to retrieve relevant studies. Inclusion of articles was determined using a predetermined protocol, independent assessment by 2 reviewers, and a final consensus decision. Seventeen randomized controlled trials and 3 nonrandomized comparative studies were included in this review. In most cases, simulation-based training was in addition to patient-based training programs. Only 2 studies directly compared simulation-based training in isolation with patient-based training. For laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 10 studies) and endoscopy (n = 10 studies), participants who reached simulation-based skills proficiency before undergoing patient-based assessment performed with higher global assessment scores and fewer errors in the operating room than their counterparts who did not receive simulation training. Not all parameters measured were improved. Two of the endoscopic studies compared simulation-based training in isolation with patient-based training with different results: for sigmoidoscopy, patient-based training was more effective, whereas for colonoscopy, simulation-based training was equally effective. Skills acquired by simulation-based training seem to be transferable to the operative setting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopy. Future research will strengthen these conclusions by evaluating predetermined competency levels on the same simulators and using objective validated global rating scales to measure operative performance.\n\nFine-motor skills testing and prediction of endovascular performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBech, Bo; LÃ¶nn, Lars; Schroeder, Torben V; Ringsted, Charlotte\n\n2013-12-01\n\nPerforming endovascular procedures requires good control of fine-motor digital movements and hand-eye coordination. Objective assessment of such skills is difficult. Trainees acquire control of catheter/wire movements at various paces. However, little is known to what extent talent plays for novice candidates at entry to practice. To study the association between performance in a novel aptitude test of fine-motor skills and performance in simulated procedures. The test was based on manual course-tracking using a proprietary hand-operated roller-bar device coupled to a personal computer with monitor view rotation. A total of 40 test repetitions were conducted separately with each hand. Test scores were correlated with simulator performance. Group A (n = 14), clinicians with various levels of endovascular experience, performed a simulated procedure of contralateral iliac artery stenting. Group B (n = 19), medical students, performed 10 repetitions of crossing a challenging aortic bifurcation in a simulator. The test score differed markedly between the individuals in both groups, in particular with the non-dominant hand. Group A: the test score with the non-dominant hand correlated significantly with simulator performance assessed with the global rating scale SAVE (R = -0.69, P = 0.007). There was no association observed from performances with the dominant hand. Group B: there was no significant association between the test score and endovascular skills acquisition neither with the dominant nor with the non-dominant hand. Clinicians with increasing levels of endovascular technical experience had developed good fine-motor control of the non-dominant hand, in particular, that was associated with good procedural performance in the simulator. The aptitude test did not predict endovascular skills acquisition among medical students, thus, cannot be suggested for selection of novice candidates. Procedural experience and practice probably supplant the influence of innate\n\nSimulation-based training in flexible fibreoptic intubation: A randomised study.\n\nPubMed\n\nNilsson, Philip M; Russell, Lene; Ringsted, Charlotte; Hertz, Peter; Konge, Lars\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFlexible fibreoptic intubation (FOI) is a key element in difficult airway management. Training of FOI skills is an important part of the anaesthesiology curriculum. Simulation-based training has been shown to be effective when learning FOI, but the optimal structure of the training is debated. The aspect of dividing the training into segments (part-task training) or assembling into one piece (whole-task training) has not been studied. The aims of this study were to compare the effect of training the motor skills of FOI as part-task training or as whole-task training and to relate the performance levels achieved by the novices to the standard of performance of experienced FOI practitioners. A randomised controlled study. Centre for Clinical Education, University of Copenhagen and the Capital Region of Denmark, between January and April 2013. Twenty-three anaesthesia residents in their first year of training in anaesthesiology with no experience in FOI, and 10 anaesthesia consultants experienced in FOI. The novices to FOI were allocated randomly to receive either part-task or whole-task training of FOI on virtual reality simulators. Procedures were subsequently trained on a manikin and assessed by an experienced anaesthesiologist. The experienced group was assessed in the same manner with no prior simulation-based training. The primary outcome measure was the score of performance on testing FOI skills on a manikin. A positive learning effect was observed in both the part-task training group and the whole-task training group. There was no statistically significant difference in final performance scores of the two novice groups (P = 0.61). Furthermore, both groups of novices were able to improve their skill level significantly by the end of manikin training to levels comparable to the experienced anaesthesiologists. Part-task training did not prove more effective than whole-task training when training novices in FOI skills. FOI is very suitable for simulation-based\n\nComputer-based simulation training in emergency medicine designed in the light of malpractice cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarakuÅ, Akan; Duran, Latif; Yavuz, YÃ¼cel; Altintop, Levent; CaliÅkan, Fatih\n\n2014-07-27\n\nUsing computer-based simulation systems in medical education is becoming more and more common. Although the benefits of practicing with these systems in medical education have been demonstrated, advantages of using computer-based simulation in emergency medicine education are less validated. The aim of the present study was to assess the success rates of final year medical students in doing emergency medical treatment and evaluating the effectiveness of computer-based simulation training in improving final year medical students' knowledge. Twenty four Students trained with computer-based simulation and completed at least 4 hours of simulation-based education between the dates Feb 1, 2010 - May 1, 2010. Also a control group (traditionally trained, n =24) was chosen. After the end of training, students completed an examination about 5 randomized medical simulation cases. In 5 cases, an average of 3.9 correct medical approaches carried out by computer-based simulation trained students, an average of 2.8 correct medical approaches carried out by traditionally trained group (t = 3.90, p < 0.005). We found that the success of students trained with simulation training in cases which required complicated medical approach, was statistically higher than the ones who didn't take simulation training (p â¤ 0.05). Computer-based simulation training would be significantly effective in learning of medical treatment algorithms. We thought that these programs can improve the success rate of students especially in doing adequate medical approach to complex emergency cases.\n\nFace, content, and construct validity of human placenta as a haptic training tool in neurointerventional surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro de Oliveira, Marcelo Magaldi; Nicolato, Arthur; Santos, Marcilea; Godinho, Joao Victor; Brito, Rafael; Alvarenga, Alexandre; Martins, Ana Luiza Valle; Prosdocimi, AndrÃ©; Trivelato, Felipe Padovani; Sabbagh, Abdulrahman J; Reis, Augusto Barbosa; Maestro, Rolando Del\n\n2016-05-01\n\nOBJECT The development of neurointerventional treatments of central nervous system disorders has resulted in the need for adequate training environments for novice interventionalists. Virtual simulators offer anatomical definition but lack adequate tactile feedback. Animal models, which provide more lifelike training, require an appropriate infrastructure base. The authors describe a training model for neurointerventional procedures using the human placenta (HP), which affords haptic training with significantly fewer resource requirements, and discuss its validation. METHODS Twelve HPs were prepared for simulated endovascular procedures. Training exercises performed by interventional neuroradiologists and novice fellows were placental angiography, stent placement, aneurysm coiling, and intravascular liquid embolic agent injection. RESULTS The endovascular training exercises proposed can be easily reproduced in the HP. Face, content, and construct validity were assessed by 6 neurointerventional radiologists and 6 novice fellows in interventional radiology. CONCLUSIONS The use of HP provides an inexpensive training model for the training of neurointerventionalists. Preliminary validation results show that this simulation model has face and content validity and has demonstrated construct validity for the interventions assessed in this study.\n\nIn Vitro Measurement of Tissue Integrity during Saccular Aneurysm Embolizations for Simulator-Based Training\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTercero, C.; Ikeda, S.; Ooe, K.; Fukuda, T.; Arai, F.; Negoro, M.; Takahashi, I.; Kwon, G.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSummary In the domain of endovascular neurosurgery, the measurement of tissue integrity is needed for simulator-based training and for the development of new intravascular instruments and treatment techniques. In vitro evaluation of tissue manipulation can be achieved using photoelastic stress analysis and vasculature modeling with photoelastic materials. In this research we constructed two types of vasculature models of saccular aneurysms for differentiation of embolization techniques according to the respect for tissue integrity measurements based on the stress within the blood vessel model wall. In an aneurysm model with 5 mm dome diameter, embolization using MicroPlex 10 (Complex 1D, with 4 mm diameter loops), a maximum area of 3.97 mm2 with stress above 1 kPa was measured. This area increased to 5.50 mm2 when the dome was touched deliberately with the release mechanism of the coil, and to 4.87 mm2 for an embolization using Micrusphere, (Spherical 18 Platinum Coil). In a similar way trans-cell stent-assisted coil embolization was also compared to human blood pressure simulation using a model of a wide-necked saccular aneurysm with 7 mm diameter. The area with stress above 1kPa was below 1 mm2 for the pressure simulation and maximized at 3.79 mm2 during the trans-cell insertion of the micro-catheter and at 8.92 mm2 during the embolization. The presented results show that this measurement system is useful for identifying techniques compromising tissue integrity, comparing and studying coils and embolization techniques for a specific vasculature morphology and comparing their natural stress variations such as that produced by blood pressure.

A review of the literature between 1999 and 2014 was performed. The search terms included a combination of urology, prostate surgery, robotic prostatectomy, laparoscopic prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), simulation, virtual reality, animal model, human cadavers, training, assessment, technical skills, validation and learning curves. Furthermore, relevant abstracts from the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, British Association of Urological Surgeons and World Congress of Endourology meetings, between 1999 and 2013, were included. Only studies related to prostate surgery simulators were included; studies regarding other urological simulators were excluded. A total of 22 studies that carried out a validation study were identified. Five validated models and/or simulators were identified for TURP, one for photoselective vaporisation of the prostate, two for holmium enucleation of the prostate, three for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and four for robot-assisted surgery. Of the TURP simulators, all five have demonstrated content validity, three face validity and four construct validity. The GreenLight laser simulator has demonstrated face, content and construct validities. The Kansai HoLEP Simulator has demonstrated face and content validity whilst the UroSim HoLEP Simulator has demonstrated face, content and construct validity. All three animal models for LRP have been shown to have construct validity whilst the chicken skin model was also content valid. Only two robotic simulators were identified with relevance to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, both of which demonstrated construct validity. A wide range of different simulators are available for prostate surgery, including synthetic bench models, virtual-reality platforms, animal\n\nModels and Methods for Adaptive Management of Individual and Team-Based Training Using a Simulator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLisitsyna, L. S.; Smetyuh, N. P.; Golikov, S. P.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nResearch of adaptive individual and team-based training has been analyzed and helped find out that both in Russia and abroad, individual and team-based training and retraining of AASTM operators usually includes: production training, training of general computer and office equipment skills, simulator training including virtual simulators which use computers to simulate real-world manufacturing situation, and, as a rule, the evaluation of AASTM operatorsâ knowledge determined by completeness and adequacy of their actions under the simulated conditions. Such approach to training and re-training of AASTM operators stipulates only technical training of operators and testing their knowledge based on assessing their actions in a simulated environment.\n\nUpdate on simulation-based surgical training and assessment in ophthalmology: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomsen, Ann Sofia S; Subhi, Yousif; Kiilgaard, Jens Folke; la Cour, Morten; Konge, Lars\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThis study reviews the evidence behind simulation-based surgical training of ophthalmologists to determine (1) the validity of the reported models and (2) the ability to transfer skills to the operating room. Simulation-based training is established widely within ophthalmology, although it often lacks a scientific basis for implementation. We conducted a systematic review of trials involving simulation-based training or assessment of ophthalmic surgical skills among health professionals. The search included 5 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) and was completed on March 1, 2014. Overall, the included trials were divided into animal, cadaver, inanimate, and virtual-reality models. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Validity evidence was evaluated using a modern validity framework (Messick's). We screened 1368 reports for eligibility and included 118 trials. The most common surgery simulated was cataract surgery. Most validity trials investigated only 1 or 2 of 5 sources of validity (87%). Only 2 trials (48 participants) investigated transfer of skills to the operating room; 4 trials (65 participants) evaluated the effect of simulation-based training on patient-related outcomes. Because of heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to conduct a quantitative analysis. The methodologic rigor of trials investigating simulation-based surgical training in ophthalmology is inadequate. To ensure effective implementation of training models, evidence-based knowledge of validity and efficacy is needed. We provide a useful tool for implementation and evaluation of research in simulation-based training. Copyright Â© 2015 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We created a simulation-based training course on proper determination based on the AAN practice parameters to address and assess knowledge and practice gaps at our institution. Our intervention consisted of a didactic course and a simulation exercise, and was bookended by before and after multiple-choice tests. The 40-min didactic course, including a video demonstration, covered all aspects of the brain death examination. Simulation sessions utilized a SimMan 3G manikin and involved a complete examination, including an apnea test. Possible confounders and signs incompatible with brain death were embedded throughout. Facilitators evaluated performance with a 26-point checklist based on the most recent AAN guidelines. A senior neurologist conducted all aspects of the course, including the didactic session, simulation, and debriefing session. Ninety physicians from multiple specialties have participated in the didactic session, 38 of whom have completed the simulation. Pre-test scores were poor (41.4Â %), with attendings scoring higher than residents (46.6 vs. 40.4Â %, pÂ =Â 0.07), and neurologists and neurosurgeons significantly outperforming other specialists (53.9 vs. 38.9Â %, pÂ =Â 0.003). Post-test scores (73.3Â %) were notably higher than pre-test scores (45.4Â %). Participant feedback has been uniformly positive. Baseline knowledge of brain death determination among providers was low but improved greatly after the course. Our intervention represents an effective model that can be replicated at other institutions to train clinicians in the determination of brain death according to evidence-based guidelines.\n\nSimulation-based training for thoracoscopic lobectomy: a randomized controlled trial: virtual-reality versus black-box simulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nJensen, Katrine; Ringsted, Charlotte; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Petersen, RenÃ© Horsleben; Konge, Lars\n\n2014-06-01\n\nVideo-assisted thoracic surgery is gradually replacing conventional open thoracotomy as the method of choice for the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancers, and thoracic surgical trainees must learn and master this technique. Simulation-based training could help trainees overcome the first part of the learning curve, but no virtual-reality simulators for thoracoscopy are commercially available. This study aimed to investigate whether training on a laparoscopic simulator enables trainees to perform a thoracoscopic lobectomy. Twenty-eight surgical residents were randomized to either virtual-reality training on a nephrectomy module or traditional black-box simulator training. After a retention period they performed a thoracoscopic lobectomy on a porcine model and their performance was scored using a previously validated assessment tool. The groups did not differ in age or gender. All participants were able to complete the lobectomy. The performance of the black-box group was significantly faster during the test scenario than the virtual-reality group: 26.6Â min (SD 6.7Â min) versus 32.7Â min (SD 7.5Â min). No difference existed between the two groups when comparing bleeding and anatomical and non-anatomical errors. Simulation-based training and targeted instructions enabled the trainees to perform a simulated thoracoscopic lobectomy. Traditional black-box training was more effective than virtual-reality laparoscopy training. Thus, a dedicated simulator for thoracoscopy should be available before establishing systematic virtual-reality training programs for trainees in thoracic surgery.\n\nDistributed Simulation as a modelling tool for the development of a simulation-based training programme for cardiovascular specialties.\n\nPubMed\n\nKelay, Tanika; Chan, Kah Leong; Ako, Emmanuel; Yasin, Mohammad; Costopoulos, Charis; Gold, Matthew; Kneebone, Roger K; Malik, Iqbal S; Bello, Fernando\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDistributed Simulation is the concept of portable, high-fidelity immersive simulation. Here, it is used for the development of a simulation-based training programme for cardiovascular specialities. We present an evidence base for how accessible, portable and self-contained simulated environments can be effectively utilised for the modelling, development and testing of a complex training framework and assessment methodology. Iterative user feedback through mixed-methods evaluation techniques resulted in the implementation of the training programme. Four phases were involved in the development of our immersive simulation-based training programme: ( 1) initial conceptual stage for mapping structural criteria and parameters of the simulation training framework and scenario development ( n Â =Â 16), (2) training facility design using Distributed Simulation , (3) test cases with clinicians ( n Â =Â 8) and collaborative design, where evaluation and user feedback involved a mixed-methods approach featuring (a) quantitative surveys to evaluate the realism and perceived educational relevance of the simulation format and framework for training and (b) qualitative semi-structured interviews to capture detailed feedback including changes and scope for development. Refinements were made iteratively to the simulation framework based on user feedback, resulting in (4) transition towards implementation of the simulation training framework, involving consistent quantitative evaluation techniques for clinicians ( n Â =Â 62). For comparative purposes, clinicians' initial quantitative mean evaluation scores for realism of the simulation training framework, realism of the training facility and relevance for training ( n Â =Â 8) are presented longitudinally, alongside feedback throughout the development stages from concept to delivery, including the implementation stage ( n Â =Â 62). Initially, mean evaluation scores fluctuated from low to average, rising incrementally.

There have not been any reviews focussing on hip and knee orthopaedic simulators. A comparison of existing simulator features is provided to identify what is missing and what is required to improve upon current simulators. In total 11 hip replacements pre-operative planning tools were analysed, plus 9 hip trauma fracture training simulators. Additionally 9 knee arthroscopy simulators and 8 other orthopaedic simulators were included for comparison. The findings are that for orthopaedic surgery simulators in general, there is increasing use of patient-specific virtual models which reduce the learning curve. Modelling is also being used for patient-specific implant design and manufacture. Simulators are being increasingly validated for assessment as well as training. There are very few training simulators available for hip replacement, yet more advanced virtual reality is being used for other procedures such as hip trauma and drilling. Training simulators for hip replacement and orthopaedic surgery in general lag behind other surgical procedures for which virtual reality has become more common. Further developments are required to bring hip replacement training simulation up to date with other procedures. This suggests there is a gap in the market for a new high fidelity hip replacement and resurfacing training simulator. Copyright Â© 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

John D.âA.; Lee, Jason Y.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPurpose: Simulation-based training improves clinical skills, while minimizing the impact of the educational process on patient care. We present results of a pilot multidisciplinary, simulation-based robotic surgery basic skills training curriculum (BSTC) for robotic novices. Methods: A 4-week, simulation-based, robotic surgery BSTC was offered to the Departments of Surgery and Obstetrics & Gynecology (ObGyn) at the University of Toronto. The course consisted of various instructional strategies: didactic lecture, self-directed online-training modules, introductory hands-on training with the da Vinci robot (dVR) (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and dedicated training on the da Vinci Skills Simulator (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) (dVSS). A third of trainees participated in competency-based dVSS training, all others engaged in traditional time-based training. Pre- and post-course skill testing was conducted on the dVR using 2 standardized skill tasks: ring transfer (RT) and needle passing (NP). Retention of skills was assessed at 5 months post-BSTC. Results: A total of 37 participants completed training. The mean task completion time and number of errors improved significantly post-course on both RT (180.6 vs. 107.4 sec, p < 0.01 and 3.5 vs. 1.3 sec, p < 0.01, respectively) and NP (197.1 vs. 154.1 sec, p < 0.01 and 4.5 vs. 1.8 sec, p = 0.04, respectively) tasks. No significant difference in performance was seen between specialties. Competency-based training was associated with significantly better post-course performance. The dVSS demonstrated excellent face validity. Conclusions: The implementation of a pilot multidisciplinary, simulation-based robotic surgery BSTC revealed significantly improved basic robotic skills among novice trainees, regardless of specialty or level of training. Competency-based training was associated with significantly better acquisition of basic robotic skills.

It has proven effective in the training of medical personnel and affords rapid assimilation and integration of necessary skills. Non-traditional caregivers often operate in austere environments, where resource and personnel limitations preclude more standard provision of care by highly trained and fully equipped health care teams. In these settings, training time for the caregivers may be limited, with long gaps between time of the training and use of the skills, a limited grasp of the underlying physiology, and unfamiliarity with \"medical English\" which can render it difficult to communicate concepts to more advanced practitioners when such interaction can take place, as for example, when telemedicine can be used to project medical skills further forward . Methods: Simulation-based training can assist in the familiarization of caregivers to the environment, ensure adequate execution of skills at the appropriate time(s), and allow practice of telemedicine communication patterns between the mentor and caregiver. Results: Scenario-based training can and has been used for initial and sustainment training modules, including self-taught modules for use in the field. Strict identification of the critical concepts is vital, as is development and practice of technically simple procedures wherever possible. Medical devices can off-load tasks from caregivers, as well as to minimize the necessary level of caregiver knowledge, while integrated simulations among all members of the mission team can improve communication and efficiency. Discuss ion: Nontraditional caregivers face unique challenges when learning to provide medical care. Scenario-based curricula allow lesson plans to be tailored to each group's individual needs, as well as being suited for the participation of numerous groups, including the caregiver, evacuation/transport staff, decision-makers, and\n\n2nd Annual Invited Experts Meeting on Simulation-Based Medical Training\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2005-12-01\n\nmedicine, government, and regulatory officials with medical simulation and patient safety experts.
