In 1942 RAF Flight Lt. Alfred K. Gatward with Sgt. George F. Fern flew a Bristol Beaufighter over the streets of Paris at the level of third floor windows. They floated a Tricolour (French flag) down on to the Arc de Triomphe in an audacious morale boosting exercise.

The Operation named "Squabble" who took place on 12 June 1942 was a daring act of precision flying by Alfred Kitchener Gatward (AKA Ken) 1914/1998. The mission sought to send a message of hope and solidarity to the people of France during the occupation of the country in WW2.

The French flag was dropped on top of the Arc de Triomphe by the crew of a Beaufighter aircraft (Gatward and Sgt Gilbert 'George' Fern -1918/2010-) in one of the most daring acts of precision flying in WW2. Gatward volunteered for â€œOperation Squabbleâ€ after his skills as a pilot in low-level attacks came to the attention of his commanding officer. Intelligence had shown that the Germans paraded down the Champs-Elysees every day between 12.15 and 12.45.

In an act of defiance against the occupying forces and in support of the French people, the mission to drop a Tricolore (French flag) on top of the Arc de Triomphe was conceived. Gatward and his navigator, George Fern, practiced on a shipwreck in the English Channel, using a variety of techniques to weight down the flag, so it landed unfurled. The initial mission on 13th May had to be cancelled due to poor visibility over the French coast. Gatward and Fern took off on 12th June 1942 for a repeat attempt, flying from Thorney Island at 11:29 and circled the Eiffel Tower at 12:17.

Unknown to Gatward and his navigator, the German parade up the Champs Elysees had been cancelled but their mission continued and at 12:28 the Tricolore was released by George Fern down the flare chute over the Arc de Triomphe. The crew returned to England and landed at RAF Northolt at 13:53.

Gatward was awarded an immediate Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions that day and Fern received the Distinguished Flying Medal.​
