        "text": "BICENTENNIAL EDITION\n\nPioneer Tales Of Burnett County\n\nCompiled by Burnett County Homemakers Clubs\n\nCover Art by Kathy Swingle\n\nPrinted by Dan-Web Printing Co, Danbury, Wisconsin\n\n[Transcribed by G.T. Transcription Team]\n\nDedicated in memory of the pioneers of Burnett county and written to be passed on as a heritage to future generations.\n\nHOMEMAKER'S CREED\n\nWe, the homemakers of Wisconsin, believe in the sanctity of the home, the cradle of character â¦ blessed by motherly devotion and guarded by fatherly protection. We pledge ourselves:\n\nTo work for the preservation and improvement of home and community life;\n\nTo strive for healthier minds and bodies, and better living;\n\nTo promote the welfare of our boys and girls, the nation's greatest asset;\n\nTo be true to God and country and of lasting service to our homes and communities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBurnett County lies in the St. Croix river valley. The first actual movement in opening the St. Croix valley was in the autumn of 1833 when a mission was established at the outlet of Yellow Lake by Rev. Fred Ayer and his wife. Miss Crooks was the teacher.\n\nJuly 29, 1837, the United States purchased this valley from the Indians. A meeting for this purpose was held at Fort Snelling and a treaty signed. The purchased was ratified by Congress in the Spring of 1838.\n\nMarch 1, 1865, this county was separated from Polk county of which it was originally a part. The newly established Burnett county include the area that is now Washburn county. It was named in honor of Thomas Pendleton Burnett, a genial and kind hearted lawyer. In 1865 when the county was organized the first county officers appointed by the governor were as follows: Judge, Nimrod H. Hickerson; Clerk of Court, Canute Anderson; Register of Deeds, Peter Anderson; Treasurer, S. Thompson; Sheriff, Martin B. Johnson and district Attorney, Jacob Larson. Grantsburg was selected as the county seat.\n\nJanuary 24, 1865 the first county supervisors meeting was held. Michael Jensen was chairman, Thore Ingebretson and Peter Anderson were supervisors. November 7, 1865, the first election was held at the home of Nimrod Hickerson.\n\nThe early settlers were mostly Norwegian and Swedish immigrants.\n\nThe first frame house built in the county was built at Grantsburg in 1865 by W. H. Peck.\n\nThe first crops were raised in the township of 39, range 18 by Charles Ayer.\n\nThe first school for white children was held in a house belonging to Joel A. Hickerson. Mr. Hickerson came to this area in 1861, took a pre-emption and while building his home left it with tools inside and enlisted in the army. While he was gone the neighbors finished the building sufficiently to use it for a schoolhouse.\n\nThe first deed recorded in Burnett county was a tax deed from Polk county to Simon Estonson, dated January 20, 1866.\n\nAlpha\n\nSome of the first pioneers that settled in alpha and surrounding communities about 1869 came from Smaland, Sweden, hence the settlement became known a Smaland Prairie.\n\nOne of the main roads going to Grantsburg was then just a trail. This road is now 70 and is located in practically the same route as in the earlier days.\n\nThe first store in Alpha was built by Hedlund and was later sold to Adam Lindskog. This is the same building where Arthur Anderson now has his store.\n\nThe first school was a church school held at the N. P. Swenson house about 1880. For the next two years school was held at the Magnuson home in Alpha. Miss Carrie Anderson was the teacher. One of the first duties of the teacher was to teach the children to speak English as only Scandinavian languages were spoken in the homes.\n\nThe local creamery was built in 1895. This original building still stands where first erected and is now owned by Arthur Anderson. Mr. Noyce was the first butter maker. Butterfat was than 11 cents a pound. Feed sold for $11.57 a ton. About two years later Mr. Noyce started the post office upstairs at the home of M. Swenson which later was taken care of by Mrs. Eva Swenson.\n\nOne of the community's oldest landmarks is now in use as the Alpha garage. This building was the former Jacobson mill built about 1885 and later owned by Axel Peterson. This mill was later torn down and moved to Alpha where Peterson built the garage. At that time, he had the Overland agency. In 1924 Jerry Becvar bought the garage and is still in business at the same location.\n\nAxel Peterson bought the Jacobson farm in about 1918 ran the feed mill and supplied electricity for himself and surrounding farmers. The three-story log house has since been remodeled by the Albin Johnson family who now own the farm a mile south of Alpha on Wood river. Only the old mill wheel remains on the place to suggest that a mill dam was once located there. He also started a hatchery using a home built incubator operated by a steam engine.\n\nA mile or two downstream also on Wood River, was the Stenberg saw mill, another necessity in those days.\n\nAlstad\n\nAlstad was settled mostly by Scandinavians. Many of them came directly from Norway and Sweden. Others had settled in Iowa before making their home here. Alstad was often called \"Logging Creek\" because of the Logging Creek which ran through and emptied into the St. Croix.\n\nThe first settlers making their homes here were, Ingebretson and Everson. Later came John Grave, A. B. Lundberg, Hans Hoff, Charlie Gustofson, Christ Narveson, G. H. Holt, Herman Anderson, Peter Hoff, J. Bergman, O. A. Loken, Louis Narval, August Lehmann, James Swingen, Ole Munson, Anton Anderson and Peter Olson.\n\nAlthough there was no heavy soil available for farming, agriculture was still the important industry. The sand was suitable for raising hay crops such as clover, blue grass, red top and broom grass, making dairying quite important. The people needed a creamery as it was too far to go to Grantsburg. Therefore a creamery was built near a small store which had been built to serve the people. The mile was bought in and separated and the people would take the skim milk home to feed the stock. Harry Beckmark from Altas was the efficient buttermaker. As transportation became better the creamery building was sold to Crex Carpet Co.\n\nPotato pits still remain where they once held potatoes stored for the starch factory in Grantsburg. The remains of one pit is at the Ben Dannholz place.\n\nA school for education of the children was built, also a church to attend. A post office and a telephone exchange, \"The Logging Creek Telephone Co.\" were also built. Everything has been discontinued. The children are being transported to the Branstad school. The church called Pleasant View is still in use, nearby is a burial ground. Rev. Dahle who has served for many years is still the pastor.\n\nBass Lake\n\nIndian upraising around Trade Lake and Bass lake vicinity! It was a false alarm but real to the minds of the folks who thought the scalping knife was next thing due them and their families. In reality the Red men were having some of their ceremonial dances, the settlers heard their tom toms and fled. A tribe lived around Wood Lake then and other Indians came to gather wild rice. They had a camp, on the Frank Olsen place now occupied by his son, where they gathered sap and made maple sugar.\n\nMrs. Augusta Ryss, oldest pioneer in Bass Lake district, passed away February 3, 1947 at the age of ninety-four years. She lived on the present farm for fifty-six years. Indians were scattered here and there. One experience she could never forget when the Indians demanded the baby if no bread was given them. She was baking at the time. They took the baby with them and would not return it until she had the bread baked. The came several times and demanded food.\n\nBashaw Brook\n\nNested in a beautiful little valley between two long stretches of highlands is a happy little community known as Bashaw Brook. We took our name from that of a one time bountiful trout stream which runs through our valley, namely Bashaw Brook. We are told that the Indians who once inhabited our community gave the brook its name. The name Bashaw means \"welcome\" in the Indian language. We think this is a very beautiful name and like to fulfill it's meaning on every occasion.\n\nThe Indians who first lived here were part of the \"Lost Chippewa Tribe\" who were later recognized by the U. S. government and given their rightful claims. Both \"big and little\" chief of the Lost Chippewa Tribe were residents of Bashaw at one time, namely Mr. John Lonestar and Mr. Bearhart, respectively. These Indians had a camping ground on the present Chauncy Lane farm where they often gathered for their autumn dances to thank the Great Spirit for their bounteous harvests.\n\nNone of the first white settlers of Bashaw Brook are living there today. These people made a living for their families by farming and logging. Most of the men worked in the woods during the winter thus leaving the women and children at home alone for months at a time. Often these noble women had to shoulder a gun to chase away some wild animal from their door.\n\nThe first Bashaw Brook school was a log building. Since then three frame buildings have been erected, two of them having been destroyed by fire. Our present building was built in 1932.\n\nMany years ago, the people of Bashaw proved that cooperative plans of work were successful. In this way the Bashaw Valley Telephone Company, Bashaw Valley Creamery and the Bashaw Threshing company each was organized and worked out very successfully. The people sold shares to obtain money to carry out their plans and everyone donated the labor to establish each company.\n\nFor entertainment in those early days folks often gathered at the various homes for quilting parties, games of checkers, and square dances. Sometimes barn dances were held in a newly erected barn before it was used. Back as early as 1909 the Bashaw Ladies Aid was organized and is an active Society today. Two of the charter members of the Ladies Aid are still active members today, one of them having been president of the Aid for the past twenty-five years.\n\nA most unusual coincidence has come to our attention as we gathered material for the community history. Today our Homemakers club bears the name of \"Busy Bees\" and to our surprise we discovered that the above mentioned, Ladies Aid Society once called themselves the Bashaw Busy Bees. We truly do believe that history does repeat itself.\n\nBlaine\n\nA LAND OF FORESTS\n\nThe turn of century found northern Burnett county a land of forests lately visited by loggers who had stripped the beautiful virgin forests of much of the stately pines. Few smaller camps provided labor for lumberjacks. Dams on chases Brook and Upper Tamerac River, ruins of which still remain, created flowages and means of a cheap but serviceable transportation for the logs.\n\nFood mush be had for the workers, for every camp fed the men well. Tote teams hauled food supplies from stores in Grantsburg and Spooner, the nearest railroad centers.\n\nMany of the men told of the big logging camp in East Blaine that was destroyed in the great Hinckley fire of September 1894. The camp had a tramway, the tracks built of logs and having heavy five-foot cast iron wheels. The cars were drawn by ox teams and the logs were thus transported to the St. Croix River, a distance of some three miles, and put in above the St. Croix at the present site of Riverside. The fire destroyed the tramway and many of the oxen met their death. To the present day, decaying bones can be found to mark the spot of the destruction. Wheels from the tramway remained, and a section of a broken wheel, weighing over three-hundred pounds was hauled out and is now at Vic Carlson's farm.\n\nFollowing the larger camps, smaller camps sprung up, and their sponsors bought or homesteaded property. Their families came to live here and became the first permanent settlers, gradually replacing crooked logging roads with wider, well located networks of good roads we enjoy today.\n\nAmong the earliest settlers who still remain, are August Holmstrom, farmer who arrived about 1900, and his brother-in-law, C. G. Berg who had camps in logging centers. They were soon followed by August Carlsons, Sander Johnsons and Emil Simonsons, and followed in 1903 by Albert Carlsons.\n\nMany acres of forests remain today in northern Burnett county. Sawmills are still busy turning logs into valuable lumber, largely for local use as much building is still being done. Pulp wood is harvested from many spruce swamps, and a considerable jack pine output is made during winter months.\n\nBut from any rise of land in our part of this great state, the eye can discern, rising tall and stately above surrounding forests or farm, many beautiful pine trees, the faithful sentinels of valley and stream.\n\nGrandma's Trail\n\nThe land where we built our house was covered with brush and trees. It had been logged, but never used for agricultural purposes. The trail was there, just a footpath made forty years before by \"Grandma Anna\" and her family going to visit a neighbor. After the neighboring family had moved away, deer continued to use this trail and so it was kept open. My oldest boy, before he was two years old, and his dog, found it and many a time left home to visit Grandma.\n\nGrandma Anna came to her homestead here with her husband, August Carlson, and their children. Three other families took homesteads that same spring of 1902. There was only one settler here at that time. Others came in the following years to build our local community which is now a part of the town of Blaine.\n\nEverything wasn't easy those first years. One of grandma' little daughters became sick and died during the first winter. Thus Grandpa and Grandma took a part of their land to use as a cemetery, now known as Hillcrest. They had to cross the St. Croix River to get their mail. The nearest stores were forty miles away at Grantsburg. That was a three day trip. There they took their wheat to be ground into flour. When the Soo Line was completed, business centers were developed along it. Finally, in 1922 highway number thirty-five was built, making travel much easier.\n\nGrandma Anna isn't dependent on roads, cars, or trains. She still sets out on foot. Her trails branch out in all directions towards her neighbors whom she visits regularly.\n\nRiverside\n\nWith the coming of Highway 35, in 1920-21, a camp site for housing laborers and stables for the horses being used for highway construction was chosen on the banks of the St. Croix river. A steel bridge spanned the river. Thirty-five crossed the river at this point and so a new plank floor was laid on the bridge and the old planks were sold.\n\nAfter graveling was completed and the camps were deserted, the buildings were torn down and the lumber became a big red barn on Vern Carlson's farm, on the state line.\n\nEd. Steinbring, lately deceased, purchased the small strip of land near the bridge where the construction camp had stood; and from lumber ripped from old bridge planks and other used lumber the original store and filling station was constructed.\n\nAs time passed a kitchen and dining room were annexed and Mrs. Steinbring opened a tea room.\n\nThe venture was a very profitable one for its owners and a tourist park across the highway was opened to the public.\n\nThe property has since passed into the possession of four new owners. It has overnight and housekeeping cottages besides rooms in the main building. The main building has been modernized and it is today one of the finest river resorts in the state.\n\nBranstad\n\nOle C. Branstad from Norway was born in 1839, was a sailor, served in the Civil War and later settled here. The settlement was named after him. He served as Register of Deeds and Treasurer for the county. Branstad had rich soil and a good stand of forest. After 1860 a large number came from Norway and a few from Sweden and took homesteads. Among these were, Zacarias Ericson, John Elg, Jake Olson, Olaus Eliason, Iver Thoreson, Lisa Peterson, Erick Tollefson, Anton Hanson, sons Sever and Nicholi. Sever served as sheriff om 1880. Others were Svenka Larson, Hans Hauger, Gotorm Halvorson, Ole and Andrew Pederson, Ole Mathison, Ole Berg, Simon Estensen, A. M. Clement, Tabias Thoreston, Martin Johnson, Pete Jacobson, Hedstrom, and Jens Jenson.\n\nThese homesteaders being of sound body and mind, built two churches. One was \"Thore\" built where the town hall now stands. This building was sold to John Hanson and is used for a granary. The Bethany church was built south of Branstad where it is still in use. F.O. Carlson, Grantsburg and Rev. H. L. Urness acted as first pastors. Other buildings built, improved and still in use are the creamery and store. The first school was built in 1870; one school was destroyed by cyclone, another by fire. Now they have the present modern one. Mina Robinson was the first teacher recorded and taught for the term of 1877-1878. One of the buildings was sold to Pete Pederson who used it for a blacksmith shop, another was bought by H. J. Hauger who remodeled into a summer kitchen which is still in use. Stores were built, one which held the post office. The post office was discontinued after better roads were built and cars were used. Branstad being close to Grantsburg much of the early history is closely linked with that of Grantsburg.\n\nCoomer\n\nThe August Fahland and George David families who came in 1879 were the first white persons to settle in Coomer. Orlando B. and Kate Smith came in 1881. B. W. Stiles, son-in-law of Mr. David and each of these three families homesteaded quarters of the same section of land. At that time there were no roads, just trails through the woods.\n\nA. Phelps and Early Holmes were also early settlers. Other neighbors were Indians, some of whom were the Bushheads and the Shenaways.\n\nIn 1883 the Albee and Charlie Hunter families took homesteads.\n\nWhen the Smiths moved to Coomer from Stillwater they had only what one horse could haul and fifty dollars in money. They drove through Clam Falls and stopped at the first house they came to for warmth and food. This happened to be the home of Kansas Smith. Mrs. Smith heated a dishpan of milk and added toast. This to the hungry travelers seemed \"the sweetest bite\" they ever tasted.\n\nNext they stopped at Tucker's and while there, the children all went skating. The Tucker children stayed out as long as the others even though they skated barefoot.\n\nIn about 1884, a log school house was built on the Lee Fahland farm one mile west of what is now Coomer. School was kept by Mrs. Linksweiler.\n\nMr. O. B. smith was the first postmaster with his wife as assistant. They held this position for 17 years. later Frank Fahland, son of August took it over. It was about 1909 when the first rural delivery from Clam Falls was made by Lester Sund, followed by Marion Smith, who still is the rural carrier.\n\nThe Coomer store was started by Frank Fahland in about 1906. He operated the business for many years.\n\nDanbury\n\nWith the coming of the railroad in 1912 the settlers came and the village of Danbury made its first appearance on the map. The first store was owned and operated by Sarkas Joseph, who earlier had a store on the St. Croix River, southwest of Danbury. It was located where Knute Averson later had his store. A large hotel opened by Ed. Peet in 1912 was located about half way between the depot and the Yellow river railroad bridge. It boasted 26 rooms with a large porch and livery stable. The first postmistress was Hanna Larsen who later became Mrs. Jensen. The post office was housed in a building which stood where the restaurant now stands. The Consolidated Lumber company opened its business in the location it still occupies in 1913, with Philip Gerber, Sr., the manager. In addition to those already mentioned some of the settlers in Danbury were the families of Olph Olssen, P. A. Wiersheim, Eachus Davis, Hugh Jefferies, Lloyd Ramsdell, Jack Hegge and C. W. Robie.\n\nThe first school the children of Danbury attended was west of the village where the old gravel pit is now. It was moved into the village where it was later used for the old town hall. The next school was built where the ball park is now. It was used until it burned in 1934.\n\nThe early settlers living in the surrounding district were for the most part farmers. Many were homesteaders who came as early as 1902. Their nearest trading post was Grantsburg. Some of these early settlers were Ole Olson, John Pearson, Avery Carpenter, Charles Mahlen and John Nelson.\n\nThe blueberry crop provided many families with a cash income during the summer. People came from miles around to pick and sell to the buyers who shipped them out by the carload. Many pickers camped in the woods for the duration of the season.\n\nThis part of the country contributed its share of furs and wild game. Hunters and trappers found such animals as beaver, mink, otter, badger, fox, weasel and wolf in large numbers. Those were the good old days when a man could go hunting for meat for his table whenever the supply ran low.\n\nLogging and lumbering provided work for many people in the winter. Logs were cut in logging camps and many were floated down the St. Croix River as far south as Stillwater. There were local sawmills that turned out lumber for the building being done at home.\n\nFalun\n\nA. G. Peterson, blind, and now over 80, is the son of one of the first settlers, Peter Anderson. Mr. Peterson tells this following interesting story of his arrival to the United States.\n\nMany long years ago, in 1868, the Anderson family and other friends left Falun, Sweden. Probably in their hearts they felt sad about leaving their native land, but with settlers' courage they headed for America.\n\nFrom Chicago to St. Paul they rode in a train very different from the streamline. The coaches were much like box cars. Rough and slivery were the hard seats. How dry and thirst the passengers got when journeying. The train would stop and the thirsty travelers rushed to the nearest creek for a drink of the bubbling liquid. When they all had their fill, the trainmen blew the whistle and shouted, \"Get aboard, we are going!\"\n\nSt. Paul at this time was only a village with seven streets. Years later Mr. Peterson took his mother to St. Paul. When told how the city had grown, she boasted and said, \"Oh, I can easily find my way, there are only seven streets\". On arriving, she turned to her son and said, \"Oh, take me home! It is too much noise here.\"\n\nAfter leaving St. Paul the first time, they settled in a small logging center called Carver. In this place they joined with two brothers, Simon and Gustoph Anderson. Simon had been out looking over land. As he returned he gave a vivid picture of a winding creek, sparkling lakes, open trails and abundant wild game. Plenty of wood for lumber and firewood topped the list of God-given things. No man today could resist such. All that was necessary was to claim a homestead. Five families headed for this area. Andrew Olson and Erick Erickson joined them. It was summer and what could be more beautiful than Wisconsin at this time of the year? So off to the place now known as Falun they went. Being, they were from Falun, Sweden, they named this new place the same.\n\nHurriedly they made rude coverings for shelter. After which, they built individual log cabins. These homes were built in small openings along the creek which they thought would be their homesteads. They had a surveyor later and it was discovered that three homes were built on one of the settler's property. When fall came P. O. Peterson and Borell Landstrum arrived from Sweden. Mr. Landstrum was unable to get a cabin built, so he built a dugout by Little Wood Lake. In the winter he became ill and died leaving his family. August Landstrum a son, lately deceased, was a survivor of the terrible winter.\n\nA long, hard walk it was to Rush City for the men intent on cutting cord wood. In the spring a large number of the peeled poles drifted down the creek. Upon investigation it was discovered that a dam had been built about a half mile away. This went to prove how little traveling had been done during the first winter. The dam had been built by some men from Grantsburg.\n\nThe education of the children was thought of, so the Olsons built a lean-to on their house and moved into it giving up their original quarters for the teacher, Pauline Berg, aged 15. She taught the children for two months. When she was asked to continue longer she replied, \"I cannot because I taught them all I know.\" Later a school house was built on the Gust Flodin place. The school building was also used for church. In the winter their Christmas services were held there. The skillful settlers made torches of pine carried high above their heads. These pitch torches were used to light their way to the services. On arrival they put the torches in the snow. The light continued to burn till they were ready to depart for home. Gifts were exchanged at the programs. During one occasion water was seen running on the floor near the tree. After searching it was found that someone had brought fish in a leaky pail as a gift.\n\nThe preachers then were very radical, they would wave their arms frantically and on bended knees plead with the people how the devil would be sure to get them if they did not become saved. Many became so frightened that they did not know how soothing true religion can be.\n\nMrs. John Oman (nee Lydia Anderson, daughter of Gustoph Anderson) now deceased, often told the following. Mrs. Oman attended school at the Flodin corner. The Indians had proven to be very good friends, so the Indian children would attend school with them. At noon the Indian children would go swimming in the river close by because they felt very dirty after being shut in a short time.\n\nAll was not well with the pioneers. Forest fires were one of the worst enemies. One of these occurred when Mrs. Oman was a child. Her mother was bedridden with the dreaded disease, cancer. The fire endangered their home so all belongings were moved out and Mrs. Anderson was carried across the creek to Simon Anderson's. The only water they had to fight the fire with was carried from the creek. After much fighting they succeeded in putting the fire out.\n\nA great deal of walking was done by these stalwart pioneers. Many trips where made to Shell Lake, other trips were made to Ashland and Gordon. Trips to Rush City and Grantsburg were made for necessary staples. Mr. Sundler, who arrived from Sweden, was carrying his flour on his back. While resting at the Jacobson place at Wood Lake remarked that in Sweden he was a lord, but here he stated that he had the job of a jackass. Mr. Gustoph Anderson used to tell of how the bears would sit along the path. One party acquired a team of oxen later. It was considered a great privilege to ride at that time. Trading was done with berries and what eggs and butter they worked hard to get. Mrs. Ed. Anderson told of how she had been sold how scarce children were. One woman had a hen who died while sitting on eggs. To preserve the eggs for hatching, she wrapped them in several layers of cloth and tied them around her waistline and kept them there until chicks were hatched. This is not a fist story. It is true.\n\nEd. Anderson is the only one left of the Simon Anderson family.\n\nA. G. Peterson married Tena Jensen of Grantsburg. To this union were born 12 children all of whom are living. The Petersons still live on the homestead of his childhood. Other children of the Peter Andersons are Mrs. Annie Fink of Falun, Mrs. Emma Nelson of Superior and Charlie Peterson of Minneapolis.\n\nFollowing as Told by Arthur Warner\n\nWhen the first settlers came over here the land was all woods and unsettled, the settlers each had to file their own homesteads. Having no means of transportation when my father, John Warner had proved his homestead and got his title, he had to walk to Osceola, a distance of 40 miles. This was in the year 1880. He came to American in 1871 from Sweden and settled in Falun, Burnett county.\n\nIn the early days fences were not used, so the cattle and oxen ran at large. People had to walk two miles of more to get them. One time an ox was found floating on Indian Lake.\n\nThe first stove was purchased at St. Croix Falls, 36 miles from here. Dad brought it up to Trade Lake by oxen then to Simon Anderson's a neighbor on the adjoining forty. From there it was carried on poles up to our home.\n\nFire permits were not yet in effect during the early days. One settler, residing south of Falun, was burning brush and the fire go away. Father was called to help fight fire but had to come home to save his place. The fire burned all night, a range of two miles. People had to fight fire all night, and that, along with a rain the next day, got the fire out. This fire occurred in 1890.\n\nFor many years my father was treasurer for town of Daniels; this, being before the other townships were organized, covered a large part of Burnett county. He traveled this by foot to collect taxes.\n\nFalun Being Organized\n\nOften we have heard of how the people went to California during the gold rush. Settlers, though not as large in number, arrived from Sweden much the same manner to claim homesteads. Being allowed 160 acres each the land in our vicinity was soon taken up. The additional ones to arrive were John Warners, Ole Nelsons, Vernnerstrands and Andrew Jernstads.\n\nStores were organized, moved and enlarged until the present time. The first store was owned by Dahlin by Arthur Warner's place. A laundry was built where Arthur Jonson's former home is located. This was bought by A. G. Peterson who made it into a store with the addition of the Dahlin building. It was here where the first post office was. Later it was moved to Johnson and son Hardware where it remained until discontinued about 1920. Other buildings of business that have been burned or changed are the woolen mill, planing mill, excelsior mill, dance hall, tannery and Free Mission church.\n\nThe creamery of years ago was replaced with the present one. Two churches remain, the Lutheran and the Baptist. School changed site several times - from the Flodidn corner to the former Westin place, then to where the Mission church stood, later to its present site. We have the following grocery stores, Miller, Carlson and Johnson; Fred Johnson and Henry Schweitzer, which are located by the creek which drew the homesteaders. Emit Forester runs a store one mile East of Falun. There is one barber shop with Stanley Olsen at the chair. A saw mill is operated by Emil Fallstrom. There are two hardware stores run by Arthur Johnson and Emil Fallstrom and Son; two garages run by Clarence Fallstrom and Don Jensen, two oil stations run by William Larson and Albin Johnson, a jewelry repair shop by O. J. Evenson, two cafes run by Violet Dahlgren and Pearl Larson, and a produce operated by Henry Baumgardt.\n\nFreya\n\nThe township of West Marshland first consisted of the whole north end of Burnett county. It included part of Wood River which was then known as Wood Lake.\n\nThe Freya school was the voting center. Settlers came to vote, visit and bear the news. Many brought their families and stayed overnight at the homes of August Gustafson, E. Q. Erickson, Earl Roberts and Isaac Lundquist.\n\nThe school supervisor, Isaac Lundquist, had to visit all the schools in the township which included Ekdahl, Freya, Black Brook, Karlsberg, Orange, and others. The town treasurer also made trips through the town collecting taxes from each settler as he went. This would take several days.\n\nE. A. Erickson was town supervisor and at one time he walked about 15 miles to the place now known as Meenon to survey a new road. It rained continuously for three days so he returned home. The town board decided that as long as Mr. Erickson had done no work he would not be paid for his trip.\n\nThere is a story of a farmer who shot and sold venison out of season. The sheriff came to his home one day and found the deer hide and arrested the farmer. The sheriff was invited into have coffee. While the men were eating, the farmer's wife went out and exchanged the deer hid for a calf hide. The men went to Grantsburg and when the case came before the judge, the joke was on the sheriff.\n\nThe first settlers' mode of travel was on foot and many were the times when they would walk a long distance for meager supplies or to visit.\n\nOne incident is told of Mr. and Mrs. August Gustafson's walking to Braham, Minn., to visit her brother. They carried their small child.\n\nOne of Freya's old landmarks can still be seen near Melquist's farm on county D. This was the old skimming station, which was a branch of the Wood River creamery.\n\nGrantsburg\n\nCanute Anderson was born in Norway in 1839. He came to America in 1851 and in 1854 settled on a farm about four miles south of Grantsburg. In 1858 the first post office in the county was established at his house, and he was appointed postmaster. In 1878 he represented Ashland, Barron, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas and Polk counties in the legislature. He did much to further the progress of Burnett county. Many of the early settlers were poor and for them his home w3as always open. Here the immigrant could obtain information as to the county and its resources. No other white men settled in the county until eight years later when Nimrod Hickerson and his brothers Joel, Perry and Newton came from Ohio and settle on Wood River. Nimrod, the oldest, built a saw mill, kept a stopping place and established a post office on the Bayfield and St. Paul route in 1869. These very early settlers were followed by the Peter Anderson family, the Dotys, Thore Ingerbretson and his sons Iver, Berswen, and Ole, Andre Skog, Martin B. Johnson, Tobias and Simon Thoreson, Michael Jensen, Bynell, Larsson and many others.\n\nThe village of Grantsburg was founded by Canute Anderson who built a flour and saw mill, a good hotel and opened a store. It was selected as the county seat when the county was organized and became the trade center of the county. By 1886 it had a court house, school house, several churches, hotels, and stores. In 1884 a branch of the Northern Pacific railroad from Rush City, Minn., to the village was completed.\n\nIn the early days when the only land ready for farming was the natural meadows, where excellent hay was found, and the small clearings made by the settlers, it was necessary for the men of the family to add to their incomes in some other way. This was usually done by working in the woods during the winters while the older men, women and children cared for the livestock and other chores. Many of the lumbermen or lumberjacks as they were called came through Grantsburg by rail or by stage on their way to the camps. On pay day in the spring, the village streets would be gay with the bright blues, yellows, greens and reds of their mackinaws, the click of their heavy boots on the board walks and the shouts and laughter of the men released from the solitude of the winter in the forests. The men would cash their checks in the village; then some of the more serious minded would hurry home to their families while others would remain in the village making merry and spending much of their earnings before going on.\n\nThe \"Big Meadows\" north of the village has been a source of income for the residents of the county and many experiments have been tried there. At first it was valuable for its crops of cranberries and wild hay or red top. In 1899 L. C. Erbes bought fifteen thousand acres of it, part of which he drained and sold as small farms or hay land. Later the meadows were purchased by the Crex Carpet Company who built several camps and hired many men in cutting, baling and hauling the wire grass to the railroads where it was shipped to their factories in Minneapolis. Later parts of it were seeded to reeds and canary grass. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to get it back into a paying crop of cranberries. At present it is a state game refuge and dikes have been built to form lakes for wild ducks, geese and other wild game. It has been one of the most interesting lands in the county.\n\nThe first agricultural exhibit was held in the court house in 1878. A fair house was built about midway on Long Street. This location was soon changed because of the inconvenience of running the horse races the length of the street. The grounds were moved north of the village for a few years, but finally twenty acres of land were purchased from Peter Anderson which is still the location of the fair grounds.\n\nOne of the chief sources of entertainment was the \"Rink.\" This was a large wooden building located where the Home Oil Company now stands. This building served as a community center and here they had roller skating, basket socials, community programs, dances, medicine and vaudeville shows and church services conducted in English for those who understood the language.\n\nIn the early days most of the church services were conducted in the Scandinavian language. The Norwegian Evangelical church was built in 1871 where the Grantsburg town hall now stands and is believed to be one of the first churches in the county. This society was organized in 1865. The first services were held in a log school house and a minister came twice a year from Rush City to conduct the meetings. For a number of years, the Methodist denomination was a part of circuit extending from Polk county up to meet the Superior circuit. The circuit riders for this area met the rider form Superior and they would journey through the most dangerous areas together. The younger children learned the English language in our schools and the need of an English service became necessary. The Methodist church was then built in 1898. One of the first churches in the village was built on the corner at the junction of highways 71 and 48 by Peter Anderson and Magnus Nelson on land donated by Peter Anderson. An argument arose and the congregation divided, part staying in the original building, the other uniting to form and build the Norwegian Methodist church which is now the American Legion Hall. Other groups later built or organized the Swedish Baptist, Swedish Lutheran and Catholic churches.\n\nJames Jensen is said to be the first white boy born in Burnett county. Mr. Jensen was chairman of the county board for a number of years and served in the Assembly for several terms. He conducted a real estate office at Grantsburg and was the pioneer land man of Burnett county.\n\nRecollections of Mrs. E. J. Pickle\n\nBack in the early sixties and seventies logging was carried on to a large extent during the winter months. The logs were cut and hauled out along the shores of Wood Lake. In the spring they were rolled into the water and floated down Wood River which runs through Grantsburg, then driven down the St. Croix River to Stillwater. The \"Wangan\" a large boat house or cook shanty followed close behind the logs. The wangan was a shed roofed building built on a large flat boat where all of the cooking was done to feed the river drivers. If it was rainy the men could go inside the wangan to eat. There was a log jam on Wood River about where the old mill used to stand. My father was a cook so while they waited for the jam to be broken he invited his family to have supper on the boat. This was an incident not soon to be forgotten. Just before the Civil War, Joseph Hickerson and five of his boys moved from Ohio to River Falls. Nimrod, Joel, Perry and Newton moved on and took homesteads in Burnett county just west of the village of Grantsburg. Joel and Nim built a saw mill where they sawed logs for a good many homes in the county. Nimrod's own home was a stopping place and post office. It was a large two-story structure built into a side hill at the \"Big Spring\" on Wood River between Grantsburg and the St. Croix. At the font of the building was an unroofed open porch built so high that wagons could drive up to it and the passengers step directly from the wagon to the porch. From this porch one entered the bar room as the lobby was called. This was a large room with a split log floor, made by splitting the logs and laying them spit side up and round side down. This room wash heated by a huge stone fireplace that burned four-foot logs. Whenever the fire got low, the boy would bring the pony up from the barn and hitch him to a log, pull it in across the floor and roll it on the fire. Before the fireplace were real barrel chairs, made by cutting the upper front half from a barrel, adding a seat and covering it with padding and heavy figured cloth. A buffalo robe covered the floor between the fireplace and the chairs and here the4 children ate popcorn and molasses candy made over the open fire; cracked hazel nuts and listened to stories told by the older people. Here many a deer was skinned and made ready to be hauled to the market to St. Paul. At one time there were 86 deer saddles hanging in the old mill. The dining room opened off the lobby. Here the tables were home-made as were some of the chairs. At some tables were plank benches. In this room was the stairway leading to the sleeping rooms. The children had great fun racing up these stairs across the floor and out the door, which opened directly on the top of the hill, then down the hill, in at the front door and up the stairs again.\n\nThis stopping place was on the mail route between Stillwater and Bayfield. A post office was established here. The mail was carried by pony, dog team, on foot and in the winter, often on snow shoes. It took three or four weeks to make the trip. It was a hard and dangerous trip, especially from Gordon to Ashland.\n\nOne time when I was helping a lady who lived at the Deering Ferry (now the Rush City Ferry) I had gotten up early in the morning to build the fire, and after shivering through the process of dressing, I opened the door into the living room and there stood an Indian dressed in long buckskin jacket and leggings, arms folded. He said not a word. I, thoroughly frightened, started backing toward Mrs. Deering's door. The Indian spoke never a word, just stood and watched me. I finally reached the latch, opened the door and slipped inside. Mrs. Deering went out to see who it was and had a good laugh for it was \"Old Susie\" who had come to give us some fresh meat he had just gotten in the forest. Another exciting instance was the Indian scare in the seventies. An Indian friend of the Lindeman family of marshland came to their home one day and told them the Indians were on the war path and they were having a war dance on the \"Big Island\" at Wood lake. He had come to warn them to leave and tell their friends and neighbors to go too and as soon as possible. The boys were sent immediately to the neighbors, who at once dropped everything and started for town with their families. One man who was working barefoot in his garden, took a baby under each arm and ran for town where he found everyone very excited. Some had gone, some were leaving. Those who had first heard the news were already on their way, others along the way left everything and joined them. It was hard going and a very slow-moving procession by foot, oxen and team. About 15 miles south of town they decided to take a stand on top of the Cushing Hill where they could have a good view of the surrounding country and where they would have a good chance to see when and if the Indians came. In the meantime, messengers had been sent to Fort Snelling for help. A group of soldiers were sent to Wood Lake to talk to the Indians who were as frightened as the settlers and made rapid flight north. It turned out that they had had no hostile intent. That was the last real Indian scare in the county.\n\nGreen Grove\n\nGreen Grove community in the town of Rusk was first settled by white men in 1885. These first men were Aaron Cornelison, Levi Ailport and John Ross who came from Pierce county. Prior to that time the locality was in its wild state. These three men were to work in earnest building homes and getting food supplies. After this was done they got their families.\n\nThere were no schools nor doctors close at hand. They had to make their own entertainment. Religious worship was conducted in the homes, as there were no churches to go to. The nearest town was Shell Lake and it was only a small village and that was 12 miles away. In order to have their wheat ground into flour they had to drive with oxen to St. Croix Falls which was 50 miles away. The trip would usually take two days. Here and there would be half way houses. They could get lodging and board. Sometimes there would be many weeks before they would receive any mail.\n\nThe Indians in this community were quite numerous, but they were friendly and never bothered these white people. At first these people would quite often be startled to see an Indian tapping on the window, but soon learned it was harmless gesture to attract attention, then knocking at the door.\n\nBy 1888 they had erected a crude school house for six students who should have been in school before. They were Dennis and Myrtle Cornelison, James and Tena Ross, Rosa, and Everett Ailport, with miss Lillian Bevan as teacher.\n\nAbout this time other families heard of this new community and began moving in. They were Edward Roatch, Henry Lawrence, Simon Rand, A. R. Hills, Frank Barden, W. W. Cable, Richard Poquett and Frank Clemons. A new neighbor was always welcome. Everyone joined to help whenever they could.\n\nIn a few years, with the influx of immigrants the population of the community had been built up enough to warrant having their own post office which was established in 1897, where George Lewis lives at the present time on county trunk highway \"H\". It was named \"Aaron\" for Aaron Cornelison, one of the original settlers and he was postmaster. In 1908 it was discontinued and a rural route took its place.\n\nSince those early days horses have replaced oxen, cars and tractors have replaced horses, new and modern buildings replaced the old log structures. Roads have replaced trails. Farms have been established, highways built and churches have been erected until today Green Grove is a pleasant and prosperous farming community. The old pioneers have passed on to another land, but many of their children and their children's children still live here and are carrying on in the same way to make Green Grove an ever-progressing community.\n\nGrettum\n\nThe appearance of this community was that of a jungle when the first settlers arrived.\n\nThe first white settler to come to Grettum was Canute Anderson. He was born in Sogan, Norway, in 1830. He immigrated to the U. S. in 1851. Three years later he settled here. In 1858 the first post office was established, named Anderson, hence the town of Anderson received its name. Mr. Anderson was often referred to as \"King Canute\". He was always doing all that he could to promote easier living for the people. Some of the other courageous early settlers were John Hane, Ole Arntson, Peter Thor, Charlie Lee, Peter Dahl, Elert and Jacob Hegge, John Hanigen, John Nelson, Zachariah Johnson, August Ellstrom, Eli Eliason, Grettum, Ole Zetterstrom, Matt Johnson, Lindholm Hamerstrom and N. M. Nelson.\n\nHattie Anderson, daughter of Canute Anderson was said to be the first white girl born in Burnett county. She was born in September 1861. She married John G. Johnson of St. Croix Falls who was associated with Simon Thoreson in the mercantile business. He also served as county clerk until his death in 1889. Andrew Alstrom filled the unexpired term. Robert C. Anderson, her brother lived on the farm his father homesteaded. Like his father he took an active part in community affairs, having been sheriff and member of the county and town boards.\n\nJudge Magnus Nelson was one of the county's oldest settlers. He was county judge for seven terms.\n\nThe chief trading centers were at St. Croix Falls and Rush City. Money was very scarce and needed so badly that only the things needed to make their main foods were bought. Later a store was built on the George Christian farm. Ole Hauge and Mr. Selander would often times go around to the homes with a cart and sell groceries and clothing.\n\nThe people of Grettum wanted a school built, so one was erected where the St. Olof's church is now standing. It was later moved to the present location. Later the St. Olof's church was built. Two years ago, the congregation celebrated it's seventy-fifth anniversary.\n\nThese early pioneers did not have the conveniences and benefits of modern life, but they did have faith, and the courage and moral strength to give their families a true sense of values.\n\nHertel\n\nHertel was named after Otto Hertel who had the first post office and store on a peninsula on Warner Lake. He had it for several years; then he sold out to Merrill M. Larrabee who moved it to his home at the present site of Hertel.\n\nAlec Lauder took over the store and post office and ran it for 11 years, when Merrill Larrabee bought it back and his son, Joe Larrabee ran it until 1946 when he sold out to Groves.\n\nOtto Hertel and Mr. Steinkiiler came from western Kansas in a covered wagon in the spring of 1895.\n\nA short time later Fred Larrabee and Alex Lauder arrived, Larrabee, Steinkiiler and Hertel took adjoining homesteads on the south end of Sand Lake. These four men married sisters. Hertel married Lottie Hotchkiss, Lauder married Edith, Steinkiiler married Mamie and Larrabee married Inez.\n\nMr. Hertel donated the land for the White Pine school and cemetery which was near the first Hertel post office.\n\nMrs. Lily Anders was the first teacher at Webster, teaching part of a term. Mrs. Otto Hertel finished the term and started the next.\n\nThe May post office was named after May Schoonover who worked there.\n\nOther early settlers in the area were Jake Berg, Frank Parker, Melvin Ainsworth who lived where Anchor Inn and Twin Pines resorts are not, and Schoonover who had the May store and post office where the Filipiak resort is not.\n\nRemains of a Doran post office and store can still be seen just southwest of the junction of S and B. Also those of the McCarty store just west of the McCarty school.\n\nWhere Nick Larson now lives there was a gorgeous camping site with a rippling spring. The Indians had used this place for their camp during the harvest season. They would pick wild rice and do their fishing, hunting and trapping. During this period the rice crop and game were plentiful. Many trials led to this spring. When the white men came and settled around, the families would come a long distance to get this spring water. On this farm a dam had been built during the logging days. After county highway B was built the trails are no longer in use and the dam has been taken out.\n\nThe first mail route was from Hertel to Shell Lake with a stop at Aaron. When the mail route was extended Alex and Jim Lauder carried the mail all the way to Kruger, stopping at the May post office.\n\nProbably one of the earliest surveyors in Burnett county was Ed Hart, father of Mrs. John Lonestar, who came in about 1858. He worked with a land office in Stillwater and was valuable to the settlers in helping them to locate their homesteads. He was also a logger. He lived on the Yellow River near Spooner in what was then Burnett county.\n\nThere were numerous Indian settlements in this area. One of these was near the present site of the South Dewey school. There some lived in houses, some in teepees, and they had a lodge for medicine dances. When there was a death, bodies were brought to Bashaw Lake for burial. It is told that one of the last important battles fought between the Sioux and Chippewa tribes took place in the area east of Bashaw Lake shortly after the Civil War.\n\nA strip of land next to Bashaw Lake used to be Indian territory but whites squatted there.\n\nSome of the Indian families who were well known by the settlers were the Shinaways, Scotties, Taylors, LeGrues and Tippetweaesiks. Shinaway was John Lonestar's grandfather; Gus LeGrue, a Civil War veteran, was Mrs. Heenan Taylor's father. John Lonestar, Darius Connor and several others from this area attended Carlyle University in Pennsylvania. George Martin, a brother of Mrs. Lonestar's mother lived where Buttons now live. When John Lonestar came back from college he worked in a store aby a sawmill just east of the present Bashaw store. Since 1895 he has been a leader on Indian affairs.\n\nHertel being inland country was homesteaded much later than most other parts of the county.\n\nJackson\n\nJackson township was formerly a part of West Marshland township. The town was split up and Jackson formed at a meeting held at the Pete Lundquist home.\n\nLogging was the main industry in the early days with white pine being taken first and then Norway and jack pine. They were taken across Lily Lake, Austin Lake and Round Lake to the Yellow River and then to Stillwater via the St. Croix.\n\nD. L. Jackson, Leef, Mark and Ed. Blodgett, Bettelson, Jay fuller, Sawyer and Alden were early homesteaders. Further north Mark, Joe and John Phernetton, Dan Conroy, Jack Cowell, Deans, Olin, Burgett, Shaeffer and Tunda settled.\n\nKarlsborg\n\nMost of the early settlers came to Karlsborg in the year 1880. They came from Sweden. Times were hard in Sweden so they came to the United States. They built their homes from hand hewn logs. The homes had one and sometimes two rooms. The logs were filled in with clay and the rooms were paper with newspapers. The men worked at logging and stayed in the camps in winter. The women did the chores.\n\nSome of the early settlers were Mr. and Mrs. Jonas Johnson, Mrs. and Mrs. P. B. Johnson, Nels Bjorklunds and Wm. Gustafsons. The Gustafsons saw no white people until a year after they came here. They had to trade with the Indians. The settlers got their provisions from either Grantsburg or St. Croix Falls which made it 25 to 30 miles for some.\n\nThey made their own candles from tallow. They dried different kinds of berries and fruit as well as corn. In those days they did no canning.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Charles Olson of Karlsborg were early settlers of this community. At one time they lived near Black Brook. Here they had a stopping place for those who did toting of merchandise from Grantsburg to Webster and other places. Mr. Olson used to haul loads of flour and groceries for various ones in the grocery business.\n\nAt the very first the post office was at the Blanding place on the east side of Mud Hen lake. There was only a narrow foot trail from Karlsborg down there. One evening when a couple of people were coming home from there, a severe rain storm came up and they had to crawl into a hay stack and spend the night there.\n\nMr. Thomas Reed was born in Plymouth, Indian, Feb. 21, 1847. He grew to manhood and served in the Civil War. Miss Ellenora Vanasdahl was born April 9, 1851. They were married March 23, 1873. After spending four years in Indiana they came by covered wagon to New Haven, in Dunn county. They settled on a very heavily wooded homestead. They were one of the first settlers in that part of Dunn county. There they lived for 20 years. They moved to Bashaw Brook in the eastern part of Burnett county. After two years they moved to Sinclair stopping place on Clam river, where Mr. Reed worked in the woods. Mrs. Reed ran the stopping place and helped out the neighbors in times of sickness, births and deaths. After several years they moved to a farm near Crex meadows where Mrs. Reed kept busy as every with her stopping house. After 20 years they moved to Janesville and later to Superior where Mr. Reed died in 1935 and Mrs. Reed in 1939.\n\nKruger\n\nKruger is located in the town of Meenon which is in the center of the county. Meenon received its name from the Chippewas and is a word for blueberries. The early settlers found the sandy soil a natural haven for jack pines and blueberries.\n\nWith two rivers, the Yellow and Clam, it was only natural that early loggers should start their work in this area.\n\nThe first man lived in a cabin on the west side of Clam Lake to the unusual age of 103 years. His name was Robert Davidson. A beach on Clam Lake was named after him. (A separate story about him in this group.)\n\nLater on many more came here including C. J. Peterson, Leonard McKees, Wm. Eddy, George Wheeler and more. The first settlers went great distances for their mail and groceries, such as a trip to Grantsburg for a sack of flour and other necessities. These trips were made on foot.\n\nOur present school had its beginning in the C. J. Peterson home. Some years later the present building was erected. The bell and belfry were put up in 1912, through a benefit social.\n\nThe Kruger church was built on a four corners one mile north of the junction of 35 and 70. It is no longer in existence. The little cemetery where many of our pioneers now rest is peace is on a hill overlooking Clam Lake.\n\nWhen the Soo Line came through many more people came, since which time the logging industry has dwindled.\n\nThis community's earliest white settler was Robert Davidson who came here from \"no one knows where\" in 1867. At the time he had to ride horseback to St. Croix Falls whenever he had to make any purchases. He was a single may and most thrifty. He tried to glean most of his living from his surroundings. He was a good gardener and an expert marksman. Plentiful was the wild game and he was never in want for meat. Davidson's cabin was near the bank of little Clam lake, and he spent much time on the water in his canoe. When he desired fish to eat he had no trouble catching his favorite ones. His bees supplied more honey than he could eat so it was exchanged for other food on his shopping trips.\n\nAt one time, \"Uncle Bobby\" as he was known to the people who settled here in later years, had to appear in court; so he traveled by horseback to Madison where he pleaded his own case. He won the decision and returned home none the worse for the trip that would seem impossible today.\n\nIn the years 1890 to 1900 many families from many states came to claim homesteads. These families had to travel hundreds of miles over land either by a horse drawn vehicle or one drawn by a team of oxen. There must have been a couple dozen families who chose this community for their home during that period.\n\nTo be sure, there were no houses on this land, but with logs from the land they claimed, the houses were quickly built. Each member of the family old enough to do any work had a part in building the home. Crude though these houses were, they provided shelter for many years. it meant hard work to clear the land. During the first years it was necessary for the men to work part time, logging for construction companies to make money to feed their families. After a few years of hard work, each farmer had several acres of land ready to produce food. These farm families were most congenial, working together, ever ready to help one another. If there was sickness in any home, kind neighbors who were gifted with nursing ability were there to care for the patient. These same good neighbors prepared the body for burial and the casket was made by someone who was handy with the saw and hammer.\n\nFor many years this group of people had to drive with a team of either horses or oxen. Over 20 miles they pushed to purchase provisions or to sell what little produce they raised over that which was needed for the family. Some children had to walk four or five miles to and from school prior to 1900 when our present school house was constructed.\n\nHardy, willing workers were these people, desiring to make a home for their families. They planned and worked together and at frequent intervals gathered at some home to spend an evening in a social way.\n\nAlthough most of them started life here with little of this world's goods, hard work and the grace of God enabled them to prosper enough to stay here. One can't recall ever hearing of one family who gave up and wandered back to the land from whence they came. Strange as it seems, the folks were happy. There was a bond between neighbors at that time, that showed greater devotion than our mode of living today could create.\n\nThe Lee and McGraw Lake Region of Blaine\n\nOne of the interesting early sidelights of the Lee school district is that it was at first combined as a joint district with the Forest Home school located across the St. Croix river about 8 miles southeast of here. School meetings were always held at the Forest Home. To reach these meetings it was necessary for out early settlers to cross the river with a boat and someone always met them with horses and wagon to finish the trip. Mr. Slipher served continuously as school clerk from the time he came until the district was dissolved.\n\nThe Forest Home region had been settled a good bit earlier and some of the familiar pioneer names are Sam Turner, Henry Zack, Olof Johnson, Clemens and Bradley. All of that land was placed under forest crop and the last of the families were moved out in 1937 which is also when that school district was dissolved. It was not until '34 or '35 that the bridge was put across the St. Croix river and road built through from the Lee school to the Forest Home school, and leading on to Minong and Gordon.\n\nA few years following the coming of the Lees and Sliphers found several other families coming to this locality, Knutsons, Emil Bleise, Ranks, Charley Cook, Lee Cook, John Larson and Clyde Bushey.\n\nJoe Schluahland (known to everyone as just \"Joe\") had a little store just west of Hay Creek on the south side of the road. This place came to mean a great deal to the people of this area.\n\nThe Lee school building was used for church services with Seth Bordon as the minister. At present Sunday school and church services are being conducted every Sunday morning at the Woodland school with Rev. Robert Thracher, a Wesleyan Methodist pastor coming over from Stone Lake.\n\nOther activities are the Farmers' club and the 4-H. Charlie Lee was elected the first president of the Farmers' club. Florence Cook is an active leader of the 4-H.\n\nClarence Lee was the first to build on the shores of beautiful Big McGraw lake. To his place many people have come every year in search of big fish. The lake has many northern pike, bass, crappies, bluegills and bullheads. It was not long before city people bought lots and built summer homes north of his place.\n\nSo far the community has been isolated from electricity and our nearest telephone is at Riverside.\n\nFrom the small beginning a little over 30 years ago has blossomed a very thriving community. The faithful hands that toiled so hard must not be disappointed, and the boys and girls hold great promises and possibilities for their future.\n\nThe early years of the twentieth century found a few early homesteaders and pioneers in our town of Blaine located at the very northwest tip of Burnett county. Among the earliest were the Bergs, Holmstroms, Simonsons, Carlsons, Goldsmiths, and others of the Riverside region.\n\nIn early April of 1917 came the real settlers of the Lee region. Christ A. Lee came first with his four horses, machinery and furniture all loaded on a box car from North Dakota to Markville, Minn. Mrs. Lee and children came to Superior by train and waited for the rest. They stayed on the Vern Carlson place along Snake trail while they built the lean-to on the barn, where they lived while the house was being built. Carpenters were secured at once and rapid progress was made in getting the house built. Many long days of hard work went into clearing the land so the food might be grown both for the family and for the livestock they soon secured.\n\nIn August of the same year came Mr. Lee's oldest daughter, Anna, soon to be followed by William A. Slipher, and in early September they were united in marriage. They built a fine home across the field from Mr. Lee's buildings. Both the homes had full basements and built-in cupboards, which was unusual in those days. Charley Lee settled near his father, Christ. They did their trading in Markville. Often they hauled produce to Superior, though this was no easy job before the highway was built.\n\nNo regular school was held the first year although Mr. Slipher very ably helped the boys and girls in evening classes and throughout the winter months conducted school in the Lees' living room. Later Miss Schretenthaler was hired. The school year of 1919-20 Roy Steffenson was at the helm. This term a new school house was built. During the term of 1923-24 this school was hauled from the Lee and Slipher corner one mile to its permanent location. In 1926 a very fine new schoolhouse was built which served until the school was closed in 1940. All of town of Blaine was made one large district combining the Lee and Woodland schools with the Aspen school. Bert Carlson bought the large building and is at present preparing to move it. The original building was bought by Bushey who uses it as a woodshed.\n\nMudhen Lake\n\nThe territory around Mudhen lake was a regular paradise - a lake full of fish, a cranberry marsh, other berries and plenty of wild game. Settlers who came from Sweden were Andrew Johnson who settled on the late Raymond Groskop farm, Gust Andersons, Erick Andersons, the Tjaders, Ole Sundquists, Lars Sundquists, Louie Andersons, Daniel Johnsons, Charley and Fred Jacobson, Henning Anderson, John Peter Johnson and J. P. Johnson. All of these pioneers have passed on. The John Peter Johnson children are the largest number living. There are now 11 children living, ranging from the ages of 50 to 70 years.\n\nThe buildings were all similar to those of other homesteaders.\n\nIn 1884 the Mudhen lake school opened its doors to instill in the minds of those early pupils the fundamentals of reading, writing and arithmetic. Their first teachers were Emma Mundrum and Nettie Rice. Nettie Rice, now Mrs. Blanding, told of her applying for the job. August Danielson was clerk. He said, \"you are young (she was 16) but pretty big so you can have the job.\" They had wanted to have an older person. The education of a teacher was equivalent to that of eighth grade. It was then known as the Blanding school. The school was named after the post office and store. The store was operated by Louis Anderson. It was located on the shores of Mudhen Lake where the Nelson resort is. The same post office with additions is still being used.\n\nWilliam M. Blanding, St. Croix Falls, having charge of issuing titles, etc., was requested by Louis Anderson to get a permit for a post office, as he had no name suggested for it the governor called it \"Blanding.\" This was about 70 years ago. Mail was delivered approximately two times a week. Trips were made to Orange, Wood Lake and Grantsburg. Jennie Landstrom was the postmistress at Wood Lake.\n\nA Lutheran church was built shortly after the Blanding school. They also purchased more ground for the Lutheran cemetery. The Town of Daniels later purchased more ground for a town cemetery adjoining the Lutheran cemetery so they are joined together. A caretaker, Elmer Eklund, has been hired by the town to make improvements. The town of Daniels when organized, bought the Lutheran church to use as a town hall. A Baptist church was built at this time where Blondie's Resort is located. It was torn down and the congregation joined that at Falun.\n\nOrange\n\nPrior to the taking of homesteads in the Orange community, loggers were busy in that area cutting the virgin timber and floating it across lakes and rivers to the St. Croix and on to Stillwater.\n\nHiram Ingalls who came in 1883 is said to be the first settler. Very soon his brother George Ingalls, Ben and Andrew Connors and Ed. Fuller came and took homesteads. Andrew settled on what is now known as Connors Lake. Frank Connors, Andrew's son, had a homestead first in Jackson, but soon moved to Orange. Ed Fuller homesteaded where the Stone brothers now live. Darius and Bernard Connors also lived in Orange. Bernard owned the place where the school is now.\n\nHiram Ingalls was the first mail carrier. He carried the mail on foot rom the Blanding post office and distributed it among the few settlers for one year. Billy Smith carried the mail from Grantsburg. Later L. S. Spafford, Kleckner, Ed Fuller and John Peterson were mail carriers. Kleckner carried mail from Orange to Jackson. Later W. F. Hayden, brother of Mrs. August Peterson got $650 to $700 a year salary for making 3 trips a week from Orange to Spooner with mail.\n\nBill Connor, son of the first Ben Connor had a post office where Jay Newcomb now lives, which is on the west side of Connors lake. At that time the road went from the Kruger post office on the Yellow river to Connors post office.\n\nIn 1906 Tillie Abrahamson moved her store from Yellow River (at the point now crossed by highway 35) to Orange, close to where the church is now.\n\nThe three Beers brothers, Byron, Freeman and Austin were also early settlers. Austin was a circuit rider in the days when church was held in the homes. The only original house of homesteaders left now is that of Byron Beers where Jim Beran lives.\n\nThe first school was a log school built in 1889, opposite where Reuben Krause's mail box stands. When this go too small, one was built where the Orange school now stands, but that burned and the present building was erected.\n\nIn 1896 P. T. Peterson, father of August came and took up a homestead.\n\nLater arrivals were the Hopkins, Culvers, Spooners, Ingebretsons, Daniels, Ole Fosmos, Chas. Israels, Frank Connor, Kulbecks, Baileys and Busheys.\n\nIn regard to the naming of Devils Lake, a fable has been told that an Indian couple and a child were out in a canoe fishing when a large horned fish leaped out of the water, grabbed the baby and swallowed it. The fish was so much like they pictured the devil that they called the lake Devils Lake.\n\nOrange has a history of many cooperative ventures. In 1904 the first telephone line was put in from Webster nearly to Spooner. To finance this, each subscriber $25 in cash, gave a mile of poles and donated so many days work. Twenty farmers organized a company and bought a threshing machine, clover huller, steam engine and wood saw. Henry Leef was the first engineer. They also starred the Equity, a debating society and a cow testing association, the latter in cooperation with Scribner and Searles of Madison. They were active in organizing the creamery in Webster. Robert Magnusen, George Rice and August Peterson sold shares.\n\nThe present Orange church plans were begun in 1908 and the church dedicated in September of 1910. Mrs. Lydia Hardell, mother of Mrs. Hiram Ingalls wished to be buried by a certain pine tree. Later two acres of land at this site were donated by her son, Hiram for the Orange Cemetery.\n\nIt is a long time since those days when in calling the telephone central, folks would say, \"Is this the middle?\" The progressive spirit of the early pioneers of Orange has lived on as if embedded in the very earth.\n\nPansy\n\nThis community was settled within a year after the land was released for homesteads in 1898.\n\nThe nearest trading post was Grantsburg 40 miles distant. The road was an old logging road; a rough, slow trip that was. For a round trip it took 3 days. The nearest doctors were also there. What a hard time he must have had in emergencies.\n\nChas. Chipman's family came here from southern Minnesota near Granada. Mr. Chipman made the journey by team and old-fashioned surrey. Fourteen days it took to make the weary trip.\n\nThe people were ambitious. No grumbling or complaining came from their kips over hardship. The first thing after coming here, was to build a house. As you can guess they could not compare with the modern home of today. The material for the abode was from the forest. Land had to be cleared at first. The families were large and a school had to be built, also roads and other buildings. An old log house was donated in which to hold classes. The hardworking settlers worked so cooperatively that much was accomplished.\n\nGrassy, wet meadows were the source of hay. Hay was cut with a scythe and shocked hay had to be carried out onto dry ground. Two poles were passed underneath and two people, one on either side, carried it. The cleared land was used for different crops, wheat being the chief one. Wheat was cut by hand with a cradle, then bundled by hand, threshed with a flail. It was then hauled to Grantsburg and ground into flour. This amount was usually enough to last a whole year.\n\nFor recreation all the family would gather at a neighbor's house for dancing and visiting, while fiddle and mouth organ provided music. Lunch was served and a happy time was had without great expense. We know of three men who walked 15 miles to a dance at Aus. Gatten's. The wife and child of one man rode on a hand sled.\n\nThe first post office was Swiss. Miss Cora Chipman carried mail 22 miles, free of charge to establish a post office. Later Mrs. John Vorphal did the same to establish Pansy post office.\n\nDuring the winters the men worked in logging camps. They often walked home 20 miles on Saturday night to see if the family was all right. In the spring, if the river was high enough, men worked on the drive, floating logs to Stillwater. The camps bought everything that the settlers could raise. In the summer blueberries were picked and sold and hauled to Spooner. This was done by using a team and wagon, a hundred crates to a load. Two men hauled continuously.\n\nA ferry at Pansy on the St. Croix served for years until a bridge could to be built. Many streams had to be forded. There were other modes of transportation. The railroads came along and brought markets closer. Towns sprang up. Dreams were coming true. We were getting ahead. Roads were built and improved, until today we have fine highways. The speeding cars and airplanes tell the story of \"stout hearts, strong backs and cooperative hands.\" Eric Lundgren, the oldest living settler, is an example of such a person. He is hale and hearty at 91 years. He likes, what he says, \"is a far cry from oxen to airplanes.\"\n\nThe Old, Old Ferry\n\nWhile I, Babe Richardson Coveau, was not born in Burnett county, my earliest recollections of any interest are connected with it, for I was only seven when I came there to live. My sister had become the wife of Mark Andrews, the man for whom Markville was later named and I came to live with her for I had lost my mother at the age of two and my sister kept me with her whenever possible. We lived at the old Pansy post office on the banks of the St. Croix. In addition to the post office there was a store and stopping place all under one room. \"Lean-tos\" had been added to the old log structure as necessity demanded. There were no roads as we think of roads today, just sand trails winding in and out of the jack pines. We went by horse and buggy to Minong, Spooner or Grantsburg when we needed supplies or had to take a train trip. Our main, and almost only source of entertainment were the dances held at the old Depot camps at Bass Lake or in a private home. Some would fiddle, another would chord on an organ, we would dance the waltz, twostep and square dance and \"a good time would be had by all.\" I was too young to join the dancers at first, but as sitters were unheard of, everyone took their youngsters and we slept wherever convenient when we grew tires. One of these dances in particular, I shall probably never forget. Some of we girls, Indians and white both were our doors when we noticed two drunken Indians trying to pick a fight with one who was sober. I shall not mention names, but the sober one tried for some time to avoid them, but to no avail. Finally, and so quickly that no one realized his intention he turned and stabbed the nearest one with his knife. I, at least, was paralyzed with fright. The wounded Indian didn't die, but only because the knife blade hadn't been long enough, but I'll be he thought twice before he tried to start another fight.\n\nIn 1911, the Soo Line started to build the railroad from Superior to Dresser Junction. Because of circumstances over which we had no control, my sister, her two small daughters and myself were alone and on our own. The railroad camps were on the Minnesota side of the St. Croix, but many supplies were hauled in from the Wisconsin side and had to be taken across by ferry, so I tackled the job for it meant money and that was something were pretty much in need of. The old ferry wasn't the kind in use now, the few places they are used, for this one required plenty of push with the old \"pike pole,\" a long pole with a sharpened metal point in one end, to get it started and plenty of energy to bail it out each morning before starting my day. Things were fairly smooth though and I was plenty busy but normally happy about the whole thing until one day a man showed up with a load of supplies and twelve mules strung out behind his wagon. If whoever read this had never tried to take mules across a river by ferry, I wouldn't advise trying it. The poor devils were half scared to death and I was kept as busy as I ever hope to be, dodging flying heels and I couldn't hear myself think for the braying they set up. I made two trips with them, six at a time and could only charge two fares, so that two that there is no doubt I earned. For individual passengers we had two small boats which I took across and brought them back with. At all times of night, folks would call from the other side of the river and my sister would wake me to go and get them. She was expecting another child soon and could not go herself but she always came part way down the hill and stood where she could hear either me or her two little girls. Being a tomboy I though it strange then, but in those camps were many men whom I don't think had ever gone to Sunday school and no one could tell just who I was going to bring across the river. Now that I have long since grown up and acquired at least a small amount of grey matter, I hope, I know how I must have worried my sister on several occasions, but youth is full of adventure and stupidity also. One day she came down to the river to find me in the middle of the St. Croix going hand over hand on the ferry cable with her four year old girl, Margel, perched on my neck and clutching my hair while Dorothy, six, watched us from the shore. The water was deep and the current swift and I couldn't swim a stroke. It was sheer stupidity, not bravery, and I couldn't have blamed her had she take drastic measures with me, but she didn't. I ran the ferry and two boats that summer and fall until I had to go back to southern Wisconsin and school, and had many experiences I shall never forget.\n\nDuring the time Markville and other towns along the new Soo Line were being built up, many of my Indian girlfriends died of tuberculosis, the disease so dreaded by the Indians, and the Indian village just a short distance north of what is Markville today, where I visited wo often and danced their tribal dances with my friends, became a ghost village. My sister died when I was nineteen. She was the only mother I had ever known. I have a grown son, four grandkiddies and have lived in many parts of the U. S., but the country in and around Burnett county always calls me back somehow as it has many others and I will always feel a bit of loneliness, I reckon for \"the good old pioneer days.\"\n\nRound Lake\n\nThe Round Lake community was settled by Scandinavians. Some of the first ones came in the year of 1868. The early pioneer days here were much like the rest of Burnett county. The nearest trading post and post office was at St. Croix Falls. The men used to carry the provisions home on their backs. They also had some trouble with Indians. An old Indian cemetery is located on an island in Trade Lake.\n\nWild animals were plentiful. The wolves used to come and look in the windows at night when the candles were lit.\n\nThe early settlers did not have many good things to eat at first. I can remember when my father would tell of one young boy who used to say, \"I wish we were rich enough so we could eat syrup on our potatoes.\" That was his ideas of a feast. There were three men named Andrew Anderson who always got their mail mixed up. To solve the problem, they called them Andrew Anderson No. I, Andrews Anderson No. II, and Andrew Anderson No. III. This was done to tell them apart as long as they lived.\n\nAs the years went by, school houses were built. At first, classes were held in the homes.\n\nSchyttner was the name of the man who was a good musician. He organized a band in about 1895. They used to travel around and play at weddings and all celebrations.\n\nIn the year of 1913 the first automobile made its appearance here. It was owned by A. O. Dahlbert and sons. The now ancient auto had a siren that could be heard for miles which was a warning for all the horses and buggies to clear the road. In 1916, George Briggs helped organize a Farmers club, which was a success until about 1938 when the old folks stayed home to listen to the radio and the young folks were not satisfied to stay so closes to home. The club used to exhibit at county fairs. They won many silver loving cups. Round Lake has one of the oldest 4-H clubs in the county. It was started in 1938 with Frank Kingsley as leader. Our homemakers club was organized quite a few years ago.\n\nWe have beautiful lakes with good fishing. Round Lake has a resort and many cottages. We are proud of our people and community.\n\nSand Lake\n\nMr. D. O. Kuhnly tells the following story about his coming to the Dongola community.\n\nWe landed here in a wagon about 50 years ago. We came from Barron county. There was no road in this region, just trails through the woods. It took three days to make a trip one way, but it was fun then.\n\nWe had a little post office, and we go mail only three times a week.\n\nWe took up a homestead in section 18-39-15. We lived in a tent the first summer and built a log cabin in the fall. This was in the year of 1898.\n\nOur first school house was made out of logs and it burned down by forest fires when almost completed. Another log hut 12x12 was built with a sod roof which served the purpose until the next year. We then built a frame school house. The work was done by donation.\n\nOur nearest town was Spooner, in Washburn county. Our neighbors were mostly Indians, few of whom still remain.\n\nScott\n\nIn the early '90's this part of the country was wild indeed. But soon the lumber companies learned of the white pine, Norway and jack pine forests here and in a few years there was very little left of the virgin timber except for some lone pines for some reason left standing to be landmarks for future travelers. Signs of the old logging camps may still be seen, usually on the banks of lakes bearing the names of the logging companies. Also, the logging rods used can be traced to McKenzie Lake where the logs were floated to be taken down the creek to the Namekagon river, then down the St. Croix river, then down to the mill at Stillwater, Minn. The log drives furnished work for many of our early pioneers, as did the other phases of the lumber industry. However, most of these early settlers were not permanently located here and moved out as the lumbering enterprises dwindled.\n\nThe first permanent settlers came here about 1895 and by 1900 there were about a dozen homesteaders here who had come from Ohio, Illinois and points in middle and southern Wisconsin. These represented the French, German, polish, Bohemian, Russian, Scotch, Irish, Dutch and English nationalities.\n\nAs this region in the early days was midway between settlements in the Swiss-Danbury region, and Spooner the nearest shopping center, some of the homes on the route became the stopping place for travelers and \"toters\" passing through. They witnessed the periodic Indian caravans which passed through going south to the rice beds or north to the blueberry camps.\n\nThe story of our people is the same as that of any pioneer and includes hard work, privations and discouragements. But their enterprise and diligence are evident in the character of their homes and farms, and their foresight has made it possible for us to boast of a consolidated school, church, electric power line and asphalt roads.\n\nOur many lakes make the Town of Scott an ideal spot for recreation, and summer resorts have sprung up on most of the lakes which have fish in abundance ranking from the minnow to the sturgeon. One of the latter kind weighing 211 pounds and was found in McKenzie lake a number of years ago.\n\nPlease read, my friends, and you shall learn some of Scott township's history away back when our neighbors were few and far between.\n\nScott is located in the northeastern part of Burnett county. The county trunk lines of A and H extend in a cross section. It derives its name from an early settler. This section is a consolidated district.\n\nThere are a number of successful farmers and a dozen tourist lodges, being blessed with approximately 20 lakes.\n\nGoing back into our oldest scrap books that are yellow with age, we found some of the following dates, by keeping obituaries.\n\nIn the eighteen hundreds and early nineteen hundreds numbers of courageous men and women chose this section and took up homesteads. Tom Temple and Du Bois settled near Du Bois lake which is now called Doby lake. Peter Durand took up his homestead in the year 1899 and was in saw milling business for a number of years. He used steam engines for power. About 1900, G. L. Miller settled near Gaslyn lake and about 1903, established a post office which was known as the Gaslyn post office. Along in the year 1899 Loren D. Hastings settled on his farm at Big McKenzie lake. The John Okonek family homesteaded in 1908 near Rooney Lake. These mentioned above are all deceased, although sons and daughters of most of these families still reside in Scott. George Christner was another very early settler and is still living. His home was always an open houses to travelers. Mr. Charles Kimball of Birch Island lake is our oldest living pioneer, having passed his 90th birthday. To mention other settlers, there were Maxwells, Bowns, Swetlands, Staffords, Tatros, Kesslers, Hornings, Hanscomb, Rannetesburghers, and perhaps a few others.\n\nTo the west of us in the town of Jackson, John Leef, Oscar Pratt, Mark Blogett, Bartosh brothers and Austins were some of the first settlers there.\n\nLogging operations and blueberry picking were the chief means of livelihood.\n\nA missionary priest by the name of Father Oderik came through the country and said masses in some of the homes before Crescent lake church was built. Some of the early settlers had yoked oxen which were used to break land. A number of this brave lot had open wells, pulling the water up in pails on ropes. When they owned a horse and buggy they were considered well fixed. A good horse or team of horses could make a trip to Spooner or Webster in one day if an early start was made such as four o'clock in the morning.\n\nAll school children walked to school and when the district was consolidated, but transportation was provided.\n\nIn tilling the soil, many arrowheads of flint are found, proving that this was a favorite section for the Indians. There are also many Indian graves, or mounds.\n\nAt this time in the year 1948, a majority of our people have rural electrification conveniences and the rural boys and girls have opportunities of attending high school by means of bus transportation. Nine out of ten families have cars.\n\nWe end our little story hoping it will become more interesting with each passing year, and when it is handed down to our families they may find their great-grandfather's name and know he had a part in the making of our beloved state.\n\nSiren\n\nStrange as it may seem, the earliest character who left a detailed written description of the Siren community was an Englishman with a Scandinavian named George Nelson was a trader with a Canadian Fur Company known as the XY Company and spent some time in this community in the years 1802 and 1803. He writes of the country in his journal as follows:\n\n\"There is a great number of lakes in the whole extent of the country; some of them beautiful, many magnificent bodies of water, and well furnished with fish. Many a time in walking overt them have I thought: 'Whenever this country becomes settled how delightfully will the inhabitants pass their time.' There is no place perhaps on this globe where nature has displayed and diversified land and water as here. I always felt as if invited to settle down and admire the beautiful views with a sort of joyful thankfulness for having been led to them. There is nothing romantic about them, frightful rock and wild and dashing water falls. Nature is here, clam, placid and serene, as if telling men in language mute, indeed - not addressed to ears, but to hear and soul. It is here man is happy; a genial healthy climate - the rigor of winter scarcely three months and in that time no very severe cold. I have diversified the land with hundreds of beautiful lakes all communicating with each other by equally beautiful streams, full of excellent fish, and ducks of twenty species; swans and geese with abundance of rice for you and them. The borders well furnished with grapes, plums, thorn apples, butternuts, etc. The woods swarming with deer, bear and beavers. Not one noxious or venomous animal, insect or reptile. Come my children; come and settle in this beautiful country I have prepared for you. And be happy.\" [A Winter in the St. Croix Valley, George Nelson's Reminiscense, 1802-03. Reprinted by permission of the copyright owner, Minnesota Historical Society.]\n\nWritten almost 150 years ago, the above is a good description of the Siren community even to this day.\n\nThe Government survey of the township line of the town of Siren was made in August, 1854. The Section lines were surveyed in August and September, 1855.\n\nPrior to that time there were no settlers although there are remains of squatters' and fur traders' shanties around the numerous lakes.\n\nRobert Davidson, a Scotchman, came to the Siren community in 1865. He entered what is probably the first homestead in the township. He made his living chiefly by hunting and furnishing venison to the logging camps along the Clam River. He lived in a log shanty near where the Clam River bridge on 70 is now located and levied tribute from the logging companies for flooding his land when they drove their logs down the river. He lived to the ripe old age of 102 years, a living example that dirt does not kill anyone. Shortly after the first World War he became quite ill and was taken by some kind person to Webster. These people game him a bath and he died within twenty-four hours.\n\nAbout the same time that Robert Davidson settle here, a French \"Squawman\" named Alexis LePrairie opened a trading post on the banks of Clam Lake where Mound Beach is now located. He traded with the Indians and according to legend, sold them plenty of \"scoot-a-wa-boo.\" One night after a carousal in his trading post he tried to put the Indians out, but they held a council of war and decided to take the place by store. In the fight that ensued, six Indians were killed and LePrairie and his family barely escaped with their lives. The trading post was burned and the Indians were buried in a shallow mass grave on the banks of clam Lake, which up to 1916 was visible with several human bones sticking out of the pit.\n\nIn the years from 1880 to 1900 permanent settling began in the Siren area. The Siren post office was established by Charles F. Segerstrom, who was the first postmaster. The post office was located in Mr. Sergerstrom's residence about one mile north of the present village. In this connection it is interesting to know how Siren go its name. In submitting an application for a new post office, the postmaster is requested to submit a name and if there is no other post office of the same name in the State, the named suggested is usually accepted. Mr. Segerstrom's residence was surrounded with lilacs, and so he thought, \"what would be more appropriate name than lilac?\" Now it so happens that the Swedish name for lilac is siren. Mr. Segerstrom wrote the work \"siren\" in the blank space provided for the suggested name. When the application got to Washington there evidently were no Swedish people in the Postal Department so that name just did not make sense to them. They changed the \"y\" to \"I\" and that is how Siren got its name. Several years later the post office was moved 1½ miles west of the present village where a store and creamery had been established on the shore of Little Doctor's Lake. It remained there until it was moved into the village in 1912 after the Soo Line railroad was extended from Frederic to Duluth.\n\nMany of the original settlers in the Siren community were Swedish people who came from the iron mining part of Sweden and who originally settled in the iron mining country around Iron Mountain, Mich., and who moved from there to the Siren community. Space does not permit more than the bate mention of the names of some of these early settlers who settled before the turn of the century.\n\nThe first entry of Government land by anyone in the Town of Siren was Frederick Schulenberg who made an entry on July 26, 1860 on Lot 5, Section 15-38-16, which is on the north shore of Silver Lake. Then on February 17, 1864, John Line and Peter M. Johnson entered the SE ¼ NE ¼ and the NE ¼ SE ¼ of Section 26, which was formerly known as the Lawrence Kiehl place. On December 14, 1869 an Indian by the name of Little Pipe entered Lot 4 in Section 2 where the Shtamek Resort is now located. About the year 1880 the Scandinavian settlers began to arrive and from then until the turn of the century a large number of settlers arrived. Probably the oldest farm house standing in the Siren community is the one built by Johan albert Johnson where Mr. Protosavage lives at the present time. Mr. Johnson came here in about the year 1882.\n\nEarly settlers took out a homestead on a plot of land, usually comprising 160 acres. This cost then $7.00 and in order to keep the land after 6 months they had to have 10 acres of field, cows, barn and a well. In 5 to 7 years of satisfactory use of the land, it became theirs. Some of the earliest settlers in the town of Daniels who came between 1880 and 1890, were Per Danielson, Charles Erickson, Lars Lundquist, Nels P. Hanson, Peder Erick Erickson, Andrew G. Anderson, Hans Hanson and Ludwig Bjork. H. K. Anderson now occupies the place homesteaded by Hans Hanson and Vernon Peterson that homesteaded by Bjork.\n\nIn the town of Siren, the following were old settlers and homesteaders whose claims are dated in 1892 or 1893. W. D. Johnson, Nels Jonson, Per Olson, who settled on the Tom Tobias place on the north shore of Crooked lake; Gustaf A. Kap on the townsite of the town of Siren; Andrew M. Lund; Lars Olaf Stener; Hans Nelson, the Paul Johnson farm on Crooked lake (Nelson was Paul Johnson's grandfather); John Anderson, the Segerstrom farm; Jons Danielson Lindh; Frank E. Lanquist; Lars Erick Larson; Peter and Johanne Wassine and Mr. Soderberg who settled on the banks of Clam River where his son, Nels still resides.\n\nAmong the other old settlers in the community were N. P. A. Nelson; Engra Olson; Anthony A. Lovall; Olaf Nordquist; Carl John Olson; Charlie Johnson; Adam Johnson; Gustav A. Johnson; Charles Erick Nyren; Ole Sundquist; Charles Gustavson; A. B. W. Engstrom; Olous Johnson; Johannes Nyberg; Daniel Johnson who came here in 1880 and or whom the town of Daniels is named; Frederick Johnson; Fred and Chas. Jacobson; Eric Stromberg and others. None of these sturdy pioneers is now alive. In some cases, their homesteads are occupied by their descendants, but in most cases, they are only a memory.\n\nWhen the first settlers came to this area, provisions had to be carried from either St. Croix or Shell Lake. Edwin Nelson had his first store when Siren was located on Little Doctor's lake and moved it to its present location after the railroad went through. When Siren moved the post office it was at first in Mr. Nelson's home.\n\nSince potatoes were one of the main crops raised locally there was a potato warehouse in Siren and a starch factory in Grantsburg.\n\nRural free delivery was started in 1913 with Mildred Danrust the first rural carrier. The first newspaper was printed in Siren in about 1915. The first automobile was owned by Dan Lind. The first airplane came in 1916, landing on the Henderson field.\n\nThe first school was near Crooked lake. The first school building in Siren is now used for the Lutheran church.\n\nThe first church was held in the school house. The first church building constructed in Siren was the mission church.\n\nOne of the early doctors was Dr. Oliver who was here until he went to World War I.\n\nSiren is today a rapidly growing village located at the crossroads of both the east-west and north-south highways in the heart of the \"fishbowl of Burnett county.\"\n\nSt. Croix Indians (The Lost Tribe)\n\nOn September 23, 1854, a government parley was held at Minneapolis to settle the placing of the different Chippewa Tribes on reserves and the 14 chiefs were each permitted to pick the location of their reservations.\n\nChief Buck who had his lodge at Little Rice Lake in Burnett county asked for the territory within Stinnett on the north, St. Croix river on the west, Long Lake on the east and New Richmond on the south. Before the grants were settled, however, Chief Buck who had returned home, took suddenly ill and died. On his death bed he made his people promise to stay right where they were and assured them that the government would keep their pledge and reserve this land for them. They obeyed. Two years later the Chiefs met again at Ashland, but Buck was dead. As there was no representative for his tribe, his tribe did not get its territory. So all of these years they have been called the \"Lost Tribe of the Chippewas.\"\n\nTimberland\n\nWhat is now the peaceful well-organized community of Roosevelt township in Burnett county was not always thus. This was once the home of the Chippewa Indians. The Chippewas came here from New York and inhabited the shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior. They lived in wigwams made of saplings poplar set in a circle of the desired size. The tops of these poles were bent to form a round top and securely tied with rawhide thongs. The Indians put grass mats and bark over this frame, leaving a smoke-ventilation at the top. The Chippewas became a powerful tribe. One of the important foods of these Indians was wild rice which they gathered near the shores of the many lakes. They did a very nice job of building canoes. They were light and the Indians could travel swiftly across streams and lakes. They wore snow shoes made of elastic wood with rawhide thongs for webbing.\n\nThis land where we now live was once owned by France and England respectively.
