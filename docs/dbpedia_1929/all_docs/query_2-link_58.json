GENERAL OFFICES: 613-614-615-616 DOOLY BUILDING SALT LAKE CITY Member Association of American Directory Publishers 2 Copyright 1918, by R. L. Polk & Co., of Utah. INTRODUCTION WITH THIS EDITION the Seventh Volume of the State Gazetteer makes its bow. Patrons browsing through the labyrinth of material embraced within its covers will quickly recognize the marvelous growth of the state in every line of industry from which the publishers have so carefully* gathered data. Conscientious endeavor has been made to bring together in carefully classified order, facts and figures which men and women in all walks of life will readily appreciate. We can assure our readers and friends that no effort has been spared by the management to make the work com¬ prehensive without being cumbersome, and to secure a log¬ ical arrangement for easy reference by the busy seeker after the valuable facts which this Gazetteer contains. With changes coming so rapidly, one upon another, features in books of this character become quickly obsolete: we will therefore, thank . our patrons for information on all matters which should come in as revisions for our next edition. In the preparation of this work we acknowledge with thanks the serviceable co-operation extended by men and women throughout the state of Utah, which has made it pos¬ sible for the Gazetteer of 1918 to be complete, reliable, inter¬ esting and valuable.

ETTA M. HENCHEY, Mgr. Recognizing the need of a Modern Maternity Hospital in Salt Lake City, one was started in a small home five years ago. The present institution is the out¬ growth of that home. Today it is located at 7 76 E. South Temple, with Mrs. Etta M. Henchey, a very competent and progressive woman, as manager. The hospital' is devoted entirely to maternity work and is modern in every particular. There are twenty beds. The rooms are large and sunny and graduate nurses are in constant attendance. Here we have all the conveniences of a modern hospital surrounded with the atmosphere of home. The patient is given her choice of a ward or private room, and medicines are furnished free of charge. Prices are more reasonable and service much better than can be obtained in a private home. A large high pressure sterilizer and a well equipped operating room are responsible for the uniformly good results. Recently the American method of “twulight sleep” — gas and oxygen -has ->een used at the request of the patient. There is a house doctor m cons ar attendance and all physicians of good standing are invited to bring cases to the Modern Maternity Home. 776 East South Temple Telephone Wasatch 7059 STATE GOVERNMENT Offices, Capitol Building, Salt Lake City MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

Appropriately called “The City of 7ti WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT A a r* ■ _ 9 : ti ie Deseret Evening Net THE FAMILY PAPER vs; UNION PORTLAND CEMENT CO OGDEN, UTAH MANUFACTURERS OF “RED DEVIL” PORTLAND CEMENT IF NOT HANDLED BY YOUR DEALER, WRITE US Brigham UTAH STATE GAZETTEER Brigham 29 Homes,” is beautifully situated on the western slope of the Wasatch mountains, 20 miles north of Ogden. It is the county seat of Boxelder county and contains about 4.200 inhabitants. The O S L R R and the O L & I Ry run through the city and the S P is but a few miles west. The residents of Brigham are nearly all engaged in fruit raising or farming, the former being the principal occupation. The strawberries and peaches of this place are especially famous and the supply has very seldom been equal to the demand. All kinds of fruit, however, can be raised at a profit and of fine quality. Immense orchards of peaches and prunes have been planted in recent years, and an annual “Peach Day” festival is held. Raising sugar beets is now receiving considerable attention and is already a profitable industry. The city has a natural advantage over any other in the state — it is never muddy. Built on an immense wash of gravel from the Box- elder canyon, no matter how hard it may rain, a few hours of sunshine will make the streets practically dry. This peculiar¬ ity of the soil does not, however, inter¬ fere with irrigation, and it is highly pro¬ ductive. The city has an electric light system, a creamery, a number of mercan¬ tile houses. 3 good banks, a, cannery, a planing mill, lumber yards and 3 live and up-to-date newspapers — The Boxelder News, The Boxelder Journal and Brigham Bulletin. While for the most part a Mormon com¬ munity, there is also here a Presbyterian church. The public library, in its own cozy build¬ ing, is deserving of special mention. The city is supplied with pure water from the Boxelder canyon, and has an excellent water system owned by the city. This city was first settled in 1852 and the pioneers had to contend with many hardships and privations before the soil could be made productive and the environ¬ ment suitable for civilized living. It is now, with its abundance of trees, health¬ ful water supply, neat gardens and homes, wide streets and withal its location, one of the most picturesque and prosperous cities in the state.
