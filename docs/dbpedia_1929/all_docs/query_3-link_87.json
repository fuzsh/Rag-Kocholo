        "text": "PARIS â€” A pair of 22-year-old Swedes has risen to the top of the beach volleyball world with an innovative technique that could prove to be as revolutionary as the forward pass in football or high jumping's Fosbury Flop. The \"Swedish Jump-Set\" is a move in which the player jumps as if to spike the ball but instead sets it to his partner. The misdirection forces the opponent to leave his feet, so that he is out of position when the ball is actually passed. All teams occasionally hit the ball over the net on the second shot. But the Swedes are the first to rely on the jump-set as a first option."
