A hundred and eight patients, 58 females and 50 males at the age of 18-59 years (M. 36.9 years, SD = 9.6) with radiologically verified Kimmerle anomaly were examined. A control group comprised 40 healthy subjects at the similar age range. The diagnosis of headaches was based on the criteria proposed by the IHS. A character of headaches, their localization, frequency, duration, number of days with headaches per year, circumstances associated with their onset and concomitant symptoms were evaluated. All the patients were subjected to electrophysiological studies (ENG, EEG and VEP). The results were statistically analyzed using a SPSS/PC+ computer system. It was revealed that clinical symptoms and signs in Kimmerle anomaly occurred most frequently in the third and fourth decade of life (65% of cases). These were most often tension-type headaches (50% of cases with headaches), vascular headaches (26% of cases) and neuralgia (24% of cases). Intensity of headaches was high. Headaches were accompanied by other complaints like vertigo (59% of cases) and in one third of cases--nausea. About 10% of patients also suffered from vomiting, paresthesia, dizziness, short periods of loss of consciousness. Sporadically--tinitus, drop attack, and vegetative symptoms. In cases without pain the most frequent signs were short periods of loss of consciousness, dizziness, and also nausea and dizziness. The EEG examination revealed pathology in 40% of patients with Kimmerle anomaly. The ENG examination in more than 33% of anomaly cases showed injury in the central part of vestibular system. Improper answers were reported in about 75% of the patients during the VEP examination.\n\nAbout signs and symptoms: can semiotics expand the view of clinical medicine?\n\nPubMed\n\nNessa, J\n\n1996-12-01\n\nSemiotics, the theory of sign and meaning, may help physicians complement the project of interpreting signs and symptoms into diagnoses. A sign stands for something. We communicate indirectly through signs, and make sense of our world by interpreting signs into meaning. Thus, through association and inference, we transform flowers into love, Othello into jealousy, and chest pain into heart attack. Medical semiotics is part of general semiotics, which means the study of life of signs within society. With special reference to a case story, elements from general semiotics, together with two theoreticians of equal importance, the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure and the American logician Charles Sanders Peirce, are presented. Two different modes of understanding clinical medicine are contrasted to illustrate the external link between what we believe or suggest, on the one hand, and the external reality on the other hand.\n\nComparing early signs and basic symptoms as methods for predicting psychotic relapse in clinical practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nEisner, Emily; Drake, Richard; Lobban, Fiona; Bucci, Sandra; Emsley, Richard; Barrowclough, Christine\n\n2018-02-01\n\nEarly signs interventions show promise but could be further developed. A recent review suggested that 'basic symptoms' should be added to conventional early signs to improve relapse prediction. This study builds on preliminary evidence that basic symptoms predict relapse and aimed to: 1. examine which phenomena participants report prior to relapse and how they describe them; 2. determine the best way of identifying pre-relapse basic symptoms; 3. assess current practice by comparing self- and casenote-reported pre-relapse experiences. Participants with non-affective psychosis were recruited from UK mental health services. In-depth interviews (n=23), verbal checklists of basic symptoms (n=23) and casenote extracts (n=208) were analysed using directed content analysis and non-parametric statistical tests. Three-quarters of interviewees reported basic symptoms and all reported conventional early signs and 'other' pre-relapse experiences. Interviewees provided rich descriptions of basic symptoms. Verbal checklist interviews asking specifically about basic symptoms identified these experiences more readily than open questions during in-depth interviews. Only 5% of casenotes recorded basic symptoms; interviewees were 16 times more likely to report basic symptoms than their casenotes did. The majority of interviewees self-reported pre-relapse basic symptoms when asked specifically about these experiences but very few casenotes reported these symptoms. Basic symptoms may be potent predictors of relapse that clinicians miss. A self-report measure would aid monitoring of basic symptoms in routine clinical practice and would facilitate a prospective investigation comparing basic symptoms and conventional early signs as predictors of relapse.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical signs and subjective symptoms of TMD in a large number of instrumentalists objectively. Materials and Methods A total of 739 musicians from a diverse range of instrument groups completed a TMD questionnaire. Among those who reported at least one symptom of TMD, 71 volunteers underwent clinical examinations and radiography for diag-nosis. Results Overall, 453 participants (61.3%) reported having one or more symptoms of TMD. The most frequently reported symptom was a clicking or popping sound, followed by temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, muscle pain, crepitus, and mouth opening limitations. Compared with lower-string instrumentalists, a clicking or popping sound was about 1.8 and 2 times more frequent in woodwind and brass instrumentalists, respectively. TMJ pain was about 3.2, 2.8, and 3.2 times more frequent in upper-string, woodwind, and brass instrumentalists, respectively. Muscle pain was about 1.5 times more frequent in instrumentalists with an elevated arm position than in those with a neutral arm position. The most frequent diagnosis was myalgia or myofascial pain (MFP), followed by disc displacement with reduction. Myalgia or MFP was 4.6 times more frequent in those practicing for no less than 3.5 hours daily than in those practicing for less than 3.5 hours. Conclusion The results indicate that playing instruments can play a contributory role in the development of TMD.

Methodology development study conducted in an audio communication school. Thirty-six deaf people were selected. A video containing image representations of clinical signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections expressed in Libras was produced. Semantic validation was performed by deaf students and content validation by three judges who are Libras experts. The validation results were subjected to the Content Validity Index, where an index score > 0.80/80% was considered as agreement among judges. Seven signs and symptoms related to sexually transmitted infections were validated and obtained satisfactory Content Validity Indexes, most of them with 100% representativeness and agreement. The validation process made the expressions of signs and symptoms related to sexually transmitted infections represented in Libras valid for establishing effective communication in the area of the study, turning it into a care tool that facilitates and standardizes communication with deaf people through Libras.

A prospective, cross-sectional and comparative study was done. A validated questionnaire was applied including the following topics: social demographic, main signs and symptoms, clinical cases; and clinical pictures. We interviewed resident doctors (n = 40), general physicians (n = 21), family physicians (n = 35) and pediatricians (n = 19) from different institutions (SSa, ISSSTE, IMSS) in Guadalajara, Mexico, from March to August 2005. Scores were interpreted as very good, good, regular and poor, and these scores were related with the specialty and clinical years of experience. chi2, student t test and linear regression. This study included 115 physicians between 22 to 60 years old (mean = 39) and with 0 to 31 (mean = 10) clinical years of experience. Regarding the conceptual identification of main signs and symptoms, tonsil exudates were recognized by 33 to 61% of physicians, and a clinical case of streptococcal tonsillitis was recognized by 50 to 70%. A clinical picture of tonsil caseum was misinterpreted as streptococcal tonsillitis by 13 to 35% of the physicians. There was no association between years of clinical experience and the scores obtained in clinical cases (r = 0.20) or clinical pictures (r = 0.09). The clinical identification of streptococcal tonsillitis was regular to poor among all the interviewed physicians, and there had no correlation with the years of clinical experience. The reinforcement in teaching to recognize the key signs and symptoms of streptococcal tonsillitis at medical school would result in better recognition, more rational use of antimicrobials and reduction in health institutions costs.\n\nPredictors of Discordance between Symptoms and Signs in Dry Eye Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nVehof, Jelle; Sillevis Smitt-Kamminga, Nicole; Nibourg, Simone A; Hammond, Christopher J\n\n2017-03-01\n\nTo investigate predictors of discordance between symptoms and signs in dry eye disease (DED). Cross-sectional association study. A total of 648 patients with dry eye from the Groningen LOngitudinal Sicca StudY (GLOSSY), a tertiary dry eye clinic patient cohort from the Netherlands. Patient symptoms were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. Dry eye signs were assessed by tear osmolarity, Schirmer test, tear breakup time, corneal and conjunctival staining, and meibomian gland dysfunction, all in both eyes, and a composite dry eye signs severity score was calculated from these 6 tests for each patient. Linear regression analysis was used to test the association of discordance between symptoms and signs with a wide range of independent variables (demographic and environmental variables, systemic diseases, ocular traits, and medications). Predictors of discordance between symptoms and signs in DED, defined by the difference between the rank score of the OSDI and the rank score of the dry eye signs severity score. Of the 648 subjects in this cohort, 536 (82.7%) were female and the mean age was 55.8 years (standard deviation, 15.6 years). Significant predictors of greater symptoms than signs were the presence of a chronic pain syndrome, atopic diseases, a known allergy, the use of antihistamines (all P < 0.001), depression (PÂ = 0.003), osteoarthritis (PÂ = 0.008), and the use of antidepressants (PÂ = 0.02). Predictors of lesser symptoms than signs were increased age (P < 0.001) and the presence of SjÃ¶gren's disease (P < 0.001) (primary SjÃ¶gren's disease, PÂ <Â 0.001) more than secondary SjÃ¶gren's disease (PÂ = 0.08), and graft-versus-host disease (PÂ = 0.04). Furthermore, greater symptoms compared with signs were highly associated with lower self-perceived health (P < 0.001). This large clinical study has shown that discordance between symptoms and signs in DED is an indicator of self-perceived health.

Though the signs and symptoms of malaria among pregnant women have been already described, clinical presentation may vary according to intensity of transmission and local perceptions. Therefore, determining common signs and symptoms among pregnant women with a malaria infection may be extremely useful to identify those in need of further investigation by rapid diagnostic test or microscopy. Six hundred pregnant women attending the maternity clinic of Nanoro District Hospital, Burkina Faso were recruited, 200 with suspected clinical malaria and 400 as controls. Cases were matched with controls by gestational age and parity. Signs and symptoms were collected and a blood sample taken for rapid diagnostic test, microscopy and haemoglobin measurement. A multivariate model was used to assess the predictive value of signs and symptoms for malaria infection. The overall prevalence of malaria was 42.6% (256/600) while anaemia was found in 60.8% (365/600) of the women. Nearly half (49%) of the cases and 39.5% of the controls had a malaria infection (pâ=â0.03). The most common signs and symptoms among the cases were fever (36%,72/200), history of fever (29%,58/200) and headache (52%,104/200). The positive predictive value for fever was 53% (95% CI:41-64), history of fever 58% (95% CI:37-63) and headache 51% (95% CI:41-61). Signs and symptoms suggestive of malaria are frequent among pregnant women living in areas of intense transmission. Common malaria symptoms are not strong predictors of infection. For a better management of malaria in pregnancy, active screening to detect and treat malaria infection early should be performed on all pregnant women attending a health facility.\n\nPhasic jaw motor episodes in healthy subjects with or without clinical signs and symptoms of sleep bruxism: a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshizawa, Shuichiro; Suganuma, Takeshi; Takaba, Masayuki; Ono, Yasuhiro; Sakai, Takuro; Yoshizawa, Ayako; Kawana, Fusae; Kato, Takafumi; Baba, Kazuyoshi\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTo investigate the association between each clinical diagnosis criterion for sleep bruxism (SB) and the frequency of jaw motor events during sleep. Video-polysomnography was performed on 17 healthy adult subjects (mean age, 26.7 Â± 2.8 years), with at least one of the following clinical signs and symptoms of SB: (1) a report of frequent tooth grinding, (2) tooth attrition with dentine exposure through at least three occlusal surfaces, (3) morning masticatory muscle symptoms, and (4) masseter muscle hypertrophy. Episodes of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) and isolated tonic activity were scored visually. These variables were compared with regards to the presence or absence of each clinical sign and symptom. In 17 subjects, 4.0 Â± 2.5/h (0.1-10.2) RMMA and 1.0 Â± 0.8/h (0-2.4) isolated tonic episodes were observed (total episodes: 5.0 Â± 2.4/h (1.2-11.6)). Subjects with self-reported grinding sounds (n=7) exhibited significantly higher numbers of RMMA episodes (5.7 Â± 2.3/h) than those without (n=10; 2.8 Â± 1.8/h) (p=0.011). Similarly, subjects with tooth attrition (n=6) showed significantly higher number of RMMA episodes (5.6 Â± 3.1/h) than those without (n=11; 3.2 Â± 1.6/h) (p=0.049). The occurrence of RMMA did not differ between the presence and absence of morning masticatory muscle symptoms or muscle hypertrophy. Clinical signs and symptoms frequently used for diagnosing SB can represent different clinical and physiological aspects of jaw motor activity during sleep.\n\nPolymorphism of DC-SIGN (CD209) promoter in association with clinical symptoms of dengue fever.\n\nPubMed\n\nOliveira, Layanna Freitas de; Lima, Clayton Pereira Silva de; Azevedo, Raimunda do Socorro Silva; MendonÃ§a, Dafne Silva Furtado de; Rodrigues, Sueli Guerreiro; Carvalho, ValÃ©ria Lima; Pinto, Eliana Vieira; Maia, Andreza Lopes; Maia, Maria Helena Thomaz; Vasconcelos, Janaina Mota; Silva, Andrea Luciana Soares da; Nunes, MÃ¡rcio Roberto Teixeira; Sena, Leonardo; Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando; Santos, Eduardo JosÃ© Melo dos\n\n2014-06-01\n\nC-type lectin DC-SIGN receptor, encoded by CD209, plays a key role in the infection of dendritic cells by dengue virus (DENV). Because the -336A/G SNP (rs4804803) polymorphism in the promoter of CD209 modulates DC-SIGN expression, we investigated the putative association of this polymorphism with DENV infection and its pathogenesis. A control sample of 72 individuals, rigorously selected through a clinical investigation for absence of past dengue fever (DF) was compared to a sample of 168 patients (156 classical DF; 12 dengue hemorrhagic fever), all residents from ParÃ¡, Brazil. However, the prevalence of symptoms showed a trend higher in the AA genotype (Wilcoxon test; Z=2.02; p=0.04). Hence, our findings indicate that the G allele downregulates the spectrum of symptoms during the early acute phase of DENV infection, putatively decreasing the viremia, as suggested in the literature.\n\nUsher syndrome clinical types I and II: could ocular symptoms and signs differentiate between the two types?\n\nPubMed\n\nTsilou, Ekaterini T; Rubin, Benjamin I; Caruso, Rafael C; Reed, George F; Pikus, Anita; Hejtmancik, James F; Iwata, Fumino; Redman, Joy B; Kaiser-Kupfer, Muriel I\n\n2002-04-01\n\nUsher syndrome types I and II are clinical syndromes with substantial genetic and clinical heterogeneity. We undertook the current study in order to identify ocular symptoms and signs that could differentiate between the two types. Sixty-seven patients with Usher syndrome were evaluated. Based on audiologic and vestibular findings, patients were classified as either Usher type I or II. The severity of the ocular signs and symptoms present in each type were compared. Visual acuity, visual field area, electroretinographic amplitude, incidence of cataract and macular lesions were not significantly different between Usher types I and II. However, the ages when night blindness was perceived and retinitis pigmentosa was diagnosed differed significantly between the two types. There seems to be some overlap between types I and II of Usher syndrome in regard to the ophthalmologic findings. However, night blindness appears earlier in Usher type I (although the difference in age of appearance appears to be less dramatic than previously assumed). Molecular elucidation of Usher syndrome may serve as a key to understanding these differences and, perhaps, provide a better tool for use in clinical diagnosis, prognosis and genetic counseling.\n\nBiofeedback efficacy to improve clinical symptoms and endoscopic signs of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nForootan, Mojgan; Shekarchizadeh, Masood; Farmanara, Hamedreza; Esfahani, Ahmad Reza Shekarchizadeh; Esfahani, Mansooreh Shekarchizadeh\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSolitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is often resistant to medical and surgical treatment. This study assessed the effect of biofeedback in decreasing the symptoms and the healing of endoscopic signs in SRUS patients. Before starting the treatment, endoscopy and colorectal manometry was performed to evaluate dyssynergic defecation. Patients were followed every four weeks, and during each visit their response to treatment was evaluated regarding to manometry pattern. After at least 50% improvement in manometry parameters, recipients underwent rectosigmoidoscopy. Endoscopic response to biofeedback treatment and clinical symptoms were investigated. Duration of symptoms was 43.11Â±36.42 months in responder and 63.9 Â± 45.74 months in non-responder group (P=0.22). There were more ulcers in non-responder group than responder group (1.50 Â±0.71 versus 1.33Â±- 0.71 before and 1.30 Â± 0.95 versus 0.67 Â±0.50 after biofeedback), although the difference was not significant (P=0.604, 0.10 respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were constipation (79%), rectal bleeding (68%) and anorectal pain (53%). The most notable improvement in symptoms after biofeedback occured in abdominal pain and incomplete evacuation, and the least was seen in mucosal discharge and toilet waiting as shown in the bar chart. Endoscopic cure was observed in 4 of 10 patients of the non-responder group while 8 patients in responder group experienced endoscopic improvement. It seems that biofeedback has significant effect for pathophysiologic symptoms such as incomplete evacuation and obstructive defecation. Improvement of clinical symptoms does not mean endoscopic cure; so to demonstrate remission the patients have to go under rectosigmoidoscopy.

The study population comprised 280 dental students at UmeÃ¥ University in Sweden. The study design was that of a case-control study within a 2-year prospective cohort. The investigation comprised a questionnaire and a clinical examination at enrolment and at 12 and 24 months. Cases (incidence) and controls (no incidence) were identified among those without signs and symptoms of TMD at the start of the study. Cases with 2-year persistence of signs and symptoms of TMD were those with such signs and symptoms at all three examinations. Clinical registrations of baseline variables were used as independent variables. Odds ratio estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the relative risks of being a case or control in relation to baseline registrations were calculated using logistic regression analyses. The analyses revealed that self-reported bruxism and crossbite, respectively increased the risk of the 2-year cumulative incidence and duration of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) signs or symptoms. Female gender was related to an increased risk of developing and maintaining myofascial pain. Signs of mandibular instability increased the risk of maintained TMD signs and symptoms during the observation period.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical signs and symptoms associated with teeth with PCO and to assess the status of the periapical tissues using the periapical index (PAI) as an aid in making a treatment decision. The study included teeth diagnosed with PCO in patients with a history of traumatic injury to the involved teeth. Histories of associated signs and symptoms including pain, swelling and drainage from a sinus tract were elicited. Tooth color, sensibility to electric pulp testing, mobility and percussion tenderness were recorded. The periapical status was assessed using the PAI. Two hundred and seventy-six teeth were diagnosed with PCO. One hundred and fifty-seven (56.9%) and 119 (43.1%) demonstrated partial or total PCO, respectively. Yellow discoloration presented most frequently, occurring in 186 (67.4%) teeth. Sixty-two (33.3%) of these had developed periapical lesions and reacted negatively to sensibility testing. Fifty-seven (30.7%) of these teeth presented radiographically with a normal periapical appearance and reacted normally to sensibility testing, whereas 67 (36.0%) presented with small changes in the periapical bone pattern and reacted in the high normal range to sensibility testing. Teeth with PAI scores < or =2 presented with occasional spontaneous pain. Teeth with PAI scores > or =3 presented with clinical symptoms and signs ranging from pain on percussion to spontaneous pain, and slight swelling to sinus tract drainage. Based on the findings of this study, endodontic treatment should be initiated in teeth with tenderness to percussion, PAI scores > or =3 and a negative response to sensibility testing.\n\nMultidisciplinary Modelling of Symptoms and Signs with Archetypes and SNOMED-CT for Clinical Decision Support.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarco-Ruiz, Luis; Maldonado, J Alberto; Karlsen, Randi; Bellika, Johan G\n\n2015-01-01\n\nClinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) help to improve health care and reduce costs. However, the lack of knowledge management and modelling hampers their maintenance and reuse. Current EHR standards and terminologies can allow the semantic representation of the data and knowledge of CDSS systems boosting their interoperability, reuse and maintenance. This paper presents the modelling process of respiratory conditions' symptoms and signs by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and information architects with the help of openEHR, SNOMED and clinical information modelling tools for a CDSS. The information model of the CDSS was defined by means of an archetype and the knowledge model was implemented by means of an SNOMED-CT based ontology.\n\nSigns and Symptoms (Smallpox)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Method: Methodological development study, which involved 36 people with deafness and three LIBRAS specialists. The study was conducted in three stages: investigation of the signs, symptoms and diseases/health problems, referred to by people with deafness, reported in a questionnaire; video recordings of how people with deafness express, through LIBRA, the signs, symptoms and diseases/health problems; and validation of the contents of the recordings of the expressions by LIBRAS specialists. Data were processed in a spreadsheet and analyzed using univariate tables, with absolute frequencies and percentages. The validation results were analyzed using the Content Validity Index (CVI). 33 expressions in LIBRAS, of signs, symptoms and diseases/health problems were evaluated, and 28 expressions obtained a satisfactory CVI (1.00). The signs, symptoms and diseases/health problems expressed in LIBRAS presented validity, in the study region, for health professionals, especially nurses, for use in the clinical anamnesis of the nursing consultation for people with deafness.\n\nDepressive symptoms and the relationship of inflammation to physical signs and symptoms in heart failure patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeo, Seongkum; Moser, Debra K; Pressler, Susan J; Dunbar, Sandra B; Dekker, Rebecca L; Lennie, Terry A\n\n2014-09-01\n\nDepressive symptoms in patients with heart failure can affect the relationship between physical signs and symptoms and inflammation. To examine the relationship between soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I and physical signs and symptoms and the effects of depressive symptoms on this relationship in patients with heart failure. Data on physical signs and symptoms (Symptom Status Questionnaire-Heart Failure), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and levels of the receptor (blood samples) were collected from 145 patients with heart failure. Data on the receptor were square root transformed to achieve normality. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their scores for depressive symptoms (nondepressed <14 and depressed â¥14). Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the data. In the total sample, with controls for covariates, higher levels of the receptor were significantly related to more severe physical signs and symptoms (F = 7.915; P < .001). In subgroup analyses, with controls for covariates, levels of the receptor were significantly related to physical signs and symptoms only in the patients without depression (F = 3.174; P = .005). Both depressive symptoms and inflammation should be considered along with physical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of improvement in inflammation on improvement in physical signs and symptoms, with consideration given to the effects of depressive symptoms.

However, there are still no clinical indicators for this situation, and confirmation of resistant strains occurs through culture and sensitivity, which can take up to 14Â days. During this period, protective measures may no longer be taken, contributing to the spread of these pathogens. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between clinical signs and symptoms of infection in venous ulcers and the presence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or Pseudomonas spp. A cross-sectional study was developed including 69 patients with 98 venous ulcers. Clinical observation protocol was applied to detect infection indicators established by the European Wound Management Association and microbiological analysis of samples of the lesions. Fisher's exact test and Ï 2 were used for analyses (PÂ <Â 0.05). Two indicators of infection predominated (f >70%): discoloration of the opaque type and/or dark brick red and increased exudate volume; 31 (31.6%) ulcer samples showed positive culture for the bacteria studied. There was no relationship between signs and symptoms of infection and the presence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Taking into account the percentage of lesions with resistant strains, for safe care, contact precautionary measures should be implemented in the treatment rooms, in addition to standard precautions.

Clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools, including measures of patient-reported outcome, performance outcome, clinician-reported outcome, and observer-reported outcome, allow patient-focused assessments to complement traditional efficacy measures such as overall survival and radiographic endpoints. This review examines the properties of various COA measures used in malignant glioma clinical trials to date and cross references their content to the priority signs, symptoms, and functional limitations defined through a community survey conducted by the National Brain Tumor Society. The overarching goal of this initiative is to identify COA measures that are feasible and have appropriate psychometric properties for use in this patient population as well as highlight where further development is needed.

The prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. Seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella oralis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia. Significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella melaninogenica, Pstr. micros/Prev. melaninogenica (all P < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and Pstr. micros/Prevotella spp. (P < 0.01); (c) 'Wet' canal (57 cases) and Prevotella spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.01), Peptostreptococcus spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.05). Thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific bacteria.\n\nAssociation between patterns of jaw motor activity during sleep and clinical signs and symptoms of sleep bruxism.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshida, Yuya; Suganuma, Takeshi; Takaba, Masayuki; Ono, Yasuhiro; Abe, Yuka; Yoshizawa, Shuichiro; Sakai, Takuro; Yoshizawa, Ayako; Nakamura, Hirotaka; Kawana, Fusae; Baba, Kazuyoshi\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the association between patterns of jaw motor activity during sleep and clinical signs and symptoms of sleep bruxism. A total of 35 university students and staff members participated in this study after providing informed consent. All participants were divided into either a sleep bruxism group (nÂ =Â 21) or a control group (nÂ =Â 14), based on the following clinical diagnostic criteria: (1) reports of tooth-grinding sounds for at least two nights a week during the preceding 6Â months by their sleep partner; (2) presence of tooth attrition with exposed dentin; (3) reports of morning masticatory muscle fatigue or tenderness; and (4) presence of masseter muscle hypertrophy. Video-polysomnography was performed in the sleep laboratory for two nights. Sleep bruxism episodes were measured using masseter electromyography, visually inspected and then categorized into phasic or tonic episodes. Phasic episodes were categorized further into episodes with or without grinding sounds as evaluated by audio signals. Sleep bruxism subjects with reported grinding sounds had a significantly higher total number of phasic episodes with grinding sounds than subjects without reported grinding sounds or controls (Kruskal-Wallis/Steel-Dwass tests; PÂ <Â 0.05). Similarly, sleep bruxism subjects with tooth attrition exhibited significantly longer phasic burst durations than those without or controls (Kruskal-Wallis/Steel-Dwass tests; PÂ <Â 0.05). Furthermore, sleep bruxism subjects with morning masticatory muscle fatigue or tenderness exhibited significantly longer tonic burst durations than those without or controls (Kruskal-Wallis/Steel-Dwass tests; PÂ <Â 0.05). These results suggest that each clinical sign and symptom of sleep bruxism represents different aspects of jaw motor activity during sleep.

The purpose of this study was to correlate tear serotonin levels, as a marker of nociceptor sensitization, to facets of dry eye (DE) including symptoms and signs. Design Cross-sectional study Participants Sixty-two patients with normal eyelid and corneal anatomy were prospectively recruited from a Veterans Administration Ophthalmology Clinic over 11 months. Methods DE symptoms (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI]), signs (tear break-up time [TBUT], corneal staining, and Schirmerâs score), and clinical descriptors of neuropathic ocular pain (NOP) (sensitivity to light and/or sensitivity to wind) were assessed. For tear analysis, each patientâs tears were collected after instilling 50Âµl of sterile saline to the lower cul-de-sac of each eye and using capillary action microcaps to collect the ocular wash. Tear serotonin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Main Outcomes Measured Correlations between tear serotonin concentrations and DE symptoms and signs. Results The mean age of the population was 61Â±14 years and 84% (n=52) of the patients were male. Serotonin concentrations negatively correlated with Schirmerâs scores (r=â0.28; p=0.02), but did not correlate with other DE parameters, such as OSDI scores, sensitivity to light or wind, TBUT, or staining. According to our hypothesis, we divided patients into groups based on both DE symptoms and aqueous tear production; serotonin concentrations were found to be significantly higher in DE group 1 (OSDIâ¥6 and Schirmerâs<8) compared to both DE group 2 (OSDIâ¥6 and Schirmerâsâ¥8) and controls (OSDI<6 and Schirmerâsâ¥8). Patients in the DE group 2 more frequently complained of sensitivity to light (64%) and wind (67%) compared to the DE group 1 (40% and 60%, respectively) and controls (8% and 17%, respectively). Conclusion Patients with DE symptoms and aqueous tear\n\nPatient-clinician agreement on signs and symptoms of 'strep throat': a MetroNet study.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Jinping; Schwartz, Kendra; Monsur, Joseph; Northrup, Justin; Neale, Anne Victoria\n\n2004-12-01\n\nDespite substantial use of the telephone in health care, only a few studies have formally evaluated the appropriateness of telephone-based management for acute medical problems. The accuracy of patients' report of signs and symptoms remains unknown. We compared the agreement between patient self-assessment and clinician assessment on the typical signs and symptoms of group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) to investigate the potential difficulties of using patient self-report to triage sore throat patients. In this cross-sectional study, each of 200 adult pharyngitis patients was instructed to examine him/herself and to record the symptoms and physical findings. Two clinicians independently interviewed and examined each patient and recorded their findings. Each patient then had a rapid GABHS antigen test, the results of which were blinded to both clinicians and patients. Each patient self-assessment was compared with the findings of each clinician, and the agreement and disagreement between them computed. We found varying levels of agreement (kappa=-0.05 to 0.71) between patients and clinicians on sore throat history and physical assessments. Importantly, there was fair to substantial agreement (kappa=0.20-0.71) on the key signs and symptoms used in GABHS clinical prediction rules. As expected, history items had the highest agreement (kappa=0.52-0.71). Patients were more likely than clinicians to report rather than deny a specific physical sign. Adult sore throat patients may reliably report their symptoms, but may not be able to assess and report accurately on relevant physical signs of pharyngitis. Patients have a tendency to over-report physical signs. This study indicates the potential difficulties associated with telephone triage of sore throat patients, or other illnesses that require assessment of physical signs.\n\nNeurological Signs and Symptoms in Fibromyalgia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatson, Nathaniel F.; Buchwald, Dedra; Goldberg, Jack; Noonan, Carolyn; Ellenbogen, Richard G.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nObjective To determine the type and frequency of neurological signs and symptoms in individuals with fibromyalgia (FM). Methods Persons with FM (n=166) and pain-free controls (n=66) underwent systematic neurological examination by a neurologist blinded to disease status. Neurological symptoms present over the preceding 3 months were assessed with a standard questionnaire. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association of neurological symptoms and examination findings with FM status. Within the FM group we examined the correlation between self-reported symptoms and physical examination findings. Results Compared to the control group, age and gender adjusted estimates revealed the FM group had significantly more neurological abnormalities in multiple categories including: cranial nerves IX and X (42% vs. 8%), sensory (65% vs. 25%), motor (33% vs. 3%), and gait (28% vs. 7%). Similarly, the FM group endorsed significantly more neurological symptoms than the control group in 27 of 29 categories with the biggest differences observed for photophobia (70% vs. 6%), poor balance (63% vs. 4%), and weakness (58% vs. 2%) and tingling (54% vs. 4%) in the arms and legs. Poor balance, coordination, tingling, weakness in the arms and legs, and numbness in any part of body correlated with appropriate neurological exam findings in the FM group. Conclusions This blinded, controlled study demonstrated neurological physical examination findings in persons with FM. The FM group had more neurological symptoms than controls, with moderate correlation between symptoms and signs. These findings have implications for the medical work-up of patients with FM.

Persons with FM (n = 166) and pain-free controls (n = 66) underwent systematic neurologic examination by a neurologist blinded to disease status. Neurologic symptoms lasting at least 3 months were assessed with a standard questionnaire. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association of neurologic symptoms and examination findings with FM status. Within the FM group we examined the correlation between self-reported symptoms and physical examination findings. Age- and sex-adjusted estimates revealed that compared with the control group, the FM group had significantly more neurologic abnormalities in multiple categories, including greater dysfunction in cranial nerves IX and X (42% versus 8%) and more sensory (65% versus 25%), motor (33% versus 3%), and gait (28% versus 7%) abnormalities. Similarly, the FM group had significantly more neurologic symptoms than the control group in 27 of 29 categories, with the greatest differences observed for photophobia (70% versus 6%), poor balance (63% versus 4%), and weakness (58% versus 2%) and tingling (54% versus 4%) in the arms or legs. Poor balance or coordination, tingling or weakness in the arms or legs, and numbness in any part of the body correlated with appropriate neurologic examination findings in the FM group. This blinded, controlled study demonstrated neurologic physical examination findings in persons with FM. The FM group had more neurologic symptoms than did the controls, with moderate correlation between symptoms and signs. These findings have implications for the medical evaluation of patients with FM.\n\nPelvic floor muscles training to reduce symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy: a case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMercier, Joanie; Morin, MÃ©lanie; Lemieux, Marie-Claude; Reichetzer, Barbara; KhalifÃ©, Samir; Dumoulin, Chantale\n\n2016-07-01\n\nVulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), caused by decreased levels of estrogen, is a common problem in aging women. Main symptoms of VVA are vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. First-line treatment consists of the application of local estrogen therapy (ET) or vaginal moisturizer. In some cases however, symptoms and signs persist despite those interventions. This case study describes a 77-year-old woman with severe VVA symptoms despite use of local ET and the addition of pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training to her treatment. A patient with stress urinary incontinence and VVA was referred to a randomized clinical trial on PFM training. On pretreatment evaluation while on local ET, she showed VVA symptoms on the ICIQ Vaginal Symptoms questionnaire and the ICIQ-Female Sexual Matters associated with lower urinary tract Symptoms questionnaire, and also showed VVA signs during the physical and dynamometric evaluation of the PFM. She was treated with a 12-week PFM training program. The patient reported a reduction in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia symptoms, as well as a better quality of sexual life after 12 weeks of PFM training. On posttreatment physical evaluation, the PFMs' tone and elasticity were improved, although some other VVA signs remained unchanged. Pelvic floor muscle training may improve some VVA symptoms and signs in women taking local ET. Further study is needed to investigate and confirm the present case findings and to explore mechanisms of action of this intervention for VVA.\n\nCERVICAL SPINE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: PERPETUATING RATHER THAN PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS IN WOMEN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBevilaqua-Grossi, DÃ©bora; Chaves, ThaÃ­s Cristina; de Oliveira, Anamaria Siriani\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAim: The purpose of this study was to assess in a sample of female community cases the relationship between the increase of percentage of cervical signs and symptoms and the severity of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and vice-versa. Material and Methods: One hundred women (aged 18-26 years) clinically diagnosed with TMD signs and symptoms and cervical spine disorders were randomly selected from a sample of college students. Results: 43% of the volunteers demonstrated the same severity for TMD and cervical spine disorders (CSD). The increase in TMD signs and symptoms was accompanied by increase in CSD severity, except for pain during palpation of posterior temporal muscle, more frequently observed in the severe CSD group. However, increase in pain during cervical extension, sounds during cervical lateral flexion, and tenderness to palpation of upper fibers of trapezius and suboccipital muscles were observed in association with the progression of TMD severity. Conclusion: The increase in cervical symptomatology seems to accompany TMD severity; nonetheless, the inverse was not verified. Such results suggest that cervical spine signs and symptoms could be better recognized as perpetuating rather than predisposing factors for TMD.

The daily ulcerative colitis signs and symptoms scale (DUCS) was developed in two phases. Phase I involved concept elicitation interviews with patients and healthcare providers, review of website posts and item generation. Phase II involved cognitive debriefing and assessment of usability and feasibility of the eDiaries. Participants were recruited from five US clinical sites, a research recruitment agency, and internet advertising. Thematic and content analysis was performed to identify concepts from Phase I. The Phase II cognitive debriefing interviews were analyzed iteratively to identify problems with clarity and relevance of eDiary content. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also reviewed and provided feedback on the eDiaries. Phase I included 32 participants (22 remission; 10 active disease). Phase II included 38 participants (22 remission; 16 active disease). A core set of seven signs and symptoms emerged that were reported by at least 30% of the patients interviewed: abdominal pain, blood in stool, frequent stools, diarrhea, stool urgency, nighttime stools, and tiredness. Participant input influenced changes such as refinement of item wording, revision of graphics, and selection of response scales. Revisions suggested by FDA included simplifying the response scale and adding questions to capture symptoms during sleeping hours. The findings of instrument development suggest that the DUCS PRO and ObsRO eDiaries are content-valid instruments for capturing the daily signs and symptoms of pediatric patients with mild to moderate UC in a clinical trial setting.\n\nSigns & Symptoms of Dextromethorphan Exposure from YouTube\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChary, Michael; Park, Emily H.; McKenzie, Andrew; Sun, Julia; Manini, Alex F.; Genes, Nicholas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDetailed data on the recreational use of drugs are difficult to obtain through traditional means, especially for substances like Dextromethorphan (DXM) which are available over-the-counter for medicinal purposes. In this study, we show that information provided by commenters on YouTube is useful for uncovering the toxicologic effects of DXM. Using methods of computational linguistics, we were able to recreate many of the clinically described signs and symptoms of DXM ingestion at various doses, using information extracted from YouTube comments. Our study shows how social networks can enhance our understanding of recreational drug effects.

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism according to patients' age and gender as well as severity and type of hyperthyroidism. This was a cross-sectional study of 3049 consecutive patients with hyperthyroidism presenting to a single secondary/tertiary care clinic. Calculation of adjusted odds ratios for presence/absence of symptoms/signs of hyperthyroidism simultaneously analyzing the influence of patients' age/gender, disease etiology/severity, symptom duration, and smoking. The majority of patients older than 61 yr had two or more symptoms. The lowest proportion of subjects reporting five or more symptoms was found in those older than 61 yr. Increasing age was associated with reduced adjusted odds ratio for the presence of most classical symptoms except for weight loss and shortness of breath, independent of disease severity. Those with more severe hyperthyroidism and smokers had increased odds ratios for most symptoms. Older age, higher serum free T(4) concentrations at diagnosis, male gender, and toxic nodular hyperthyroidism were independently associated with risk of atrial fibrillation. Signs of ophthalmopathy were associated with increasing age, smoking, longer symptom duration, and female gender. Classical symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism are significantly less prevalent in older patients and more prevalent in smokers and subjects with higher free T(4) concentrations. We propose a lower threshold for performing thyroid function tests in patients older than 60 yr, especially in those presenting with atrial fibrillation, weight loss, or shortness of breath.\n\nIdentifying patterns in signs and symptoms preceding the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Retrospective medical record review study and a nested case -control design.\n\nPubMed\n\nBature, Fidelia; Pang, Dong; Robinson, Anthea; Polson, Norma; Pappas, Yannis; Guinn, Barbara\n\n2018-04-04\n\nEvidence suggests that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often diagnosed in the later stages of their disease with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to identify patterns in signs and symptoms preceding the clinical diagnosis of AD to suggest a predictive model for earlier diagnosis of the disease in the primary care. A retrospective medical record review; nested case control design. Participants included one hundred and nine patients from three general practice (GP) surgeries in Milton Keynes and Luton Clinical Commissioning groups (CCG) (37 cases with AD and 72 controls without AD). A retrospective analysis using the logistic regression of the presence of signs and symptoms before the diagnosis of AD was attained. Identification of the timing and sequence of appearance of these presentations as first reported before the clinical diagnosis was measured. Episodic memory with an odds ratio of 1.85 was the most frequent presentation, documented in 1.38% of the controls and 75.6% in cases. Auditory disturbance with an odds ratio of 3.03, which has not previously been noted except in the form of auditory hallucination, could have a diagnostic value. Auditory disturbance, which occurred mostly in the Caucasian females, could discriminate individuals with AD from those without. The symptom, which presented up to 14.5 (mean time) years prior to clinical diagnosis, was identified in Caucasians and mixed race individuals only.

Individual case safety reports, including structured (age, sex, adverse event [AE]) and unstructured (clinical narratives) data, were analyzed by automated text mining from a Japanese post-marketing AE-reporting database (16 April 2008-10 April 2015) assuming the following: treated in Japan; TCZ RA treatment; â¥1Â SI; unable to exclude causality between TCZ and SIs. The database included 7653 RA patients; 1221 reports met four criteria, encompassing 1591 SIs. Frequent SIs were pneumonia (15.9%), cellulitis (9.9%), and sepsis (5.0%). Reports for 782 patients included SI onset date; 60.7% of patients had signs/symptoms â¤28Â days before SI diagnosis, 32.7% had signs/symptoms with date unidentified, 1.7% were asymptomatic, and 4.9% had unknown signs/symptoms. The most frequent signs/symptoms were for skin (swelling and pain) and respiratory (cough and pyrexia) infections. Among 68 patients who had normal laboratory results for C-reactive protein, body temperature, and white blood cell count, 94.1% had signs or symptoms of infection. This study identified prodromal signs and symptoms of SIs in RA patients receiving TCZ. Data mining clinical narratives from post-marketing AE databases may be beneficial in characterizing SIs.\n\nCushing's syndrome: update on signs, symptoms and biochemical screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nNieman, Lynnette K\n\n2015-10-01\n\nEndogenous pathologic hypercortisolism, or Cushing's syndrome, is associated with poor quality of life, morbidity, and increased mortality. Early diagnosis may mitigate against this natural history of the disorder. The clinical presentation of Cushing's syndrome varies, in part related to the extent and duration of cortisol excess. When hypercortisolism is severe, its signs and symptoms are unmistakable. However, most of the signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome are common in the general population (e.g., hypertension and weight gain) and not all are present in every patient. In addition to classical features of glucocorticoid excess, such as proximal muscle weakness and wide purple striae, patients may present with the associated comorbidities that are caused by hypercortisolism. These include cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disease, psychiatric and cognitive deficits, and infections. As a result, internists and generalists must consider Cushing's syndrome as a cause, and endocrinologists should search for and treat these comorbidities. Recommended tests to screen for Cushing's syndrome include 1 âmg dexamethasone suppression, urine free cortisol, and late night salivary cortisol. These may be slightly elevated in patients with physiologic hypercortisolism, which should be excluded, along with exogenous glucocorticoid use. Each screening test has caveats and the choice of tests should be individualized based on each patient's characteristics and lifestyle. The objective of this review is to update the readership on the clinical and biochemical features of Cushing's syndrome that are useful when evaluating patients for this diagnosis.

Various Epidemiological studies had shown occurrence of TMD in all age groups including children. Also research had shown that non nutritional oral habits to be associated with TMD. Present study aimed to find whether harmful oral habits are associated with sign and symptoms of TMD among adolescents in Greater Noida. Schools in Gautam Buddha district and descriptive study. Cross sectional study was carried out among 240 adolescents (10 - 19 years) studying in schools of Greater Noida. Study population were selected by random sampling to whom screening questionnaires recommended by American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP) were distributed. Patient history and clinical examination was used to determine harmful oral habits. Data analysis was done in SPSS version 21 and Chi-square test was applied. Sixty one participants (25.4%) displayed no sign and symptoms of TMD, 34 (14.2%) responded affirmatively to atleast one item on the questionnaire and 108(46%) gave at least three affirmative responses. Headache, Neckpain and Toothache were most frequent reported sign and symptoms of TMD (46.2%). There was statistically significant association between gender and sign and symptoms of TMD on three items of the questionnaire (p < 0.05). Nail Biting (45.8%), Biting Lips/objects (37%) were most common habits among the study group. There was statistically significant association between Nail Biting (p = 0.001), Lip Biting/ object biting (p=0.001), Grinding of teeth (p = 0.01) and sign and symptoms of TMD. A statistically significant association was found between nail biting, lip/ object biting and grinding of teeth with signs and/or symptoms of TMD. Thus there is need for preventive dental treatment and community dental education so that young adults realize importance of early diagnosis and treatment of TMJ\n\nUltrasound discloses entheseal involvement in inactive and low active inflammatory bowel disease without clinical signs and symptoms of spondyloarthropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBandinelli, Francesca; Milla, Monica; Genise, Stefania; Giovannini, Leonardo; Bagnoli, Siro; Candelieri, Antonio; Collaku, Ledio; Biagini, Silvia; Cerinic, Marco Matucci\n\n2011-07-01\n\nTo investigate the presence of lower limb entheseal abnormalities in IBD patients without clinical signs and symptoms of SpA and their correlation with IBD clinical variables. A total of 81 IBD patients [55 Crohn's disease (CD) and 26 ulcerative colitis (UC), 43 females and 38 males, mean age 41.3 (12.4) years, BMI 24 (2)] with low active (12) and inactive (67) disease were consecutively studied with US (LOGIQ5 General Electric 10-MHz linear array transducer) of lower limb entheses and compared with 40 healthy controls matched for sex, age and BMI. Quadriceps, patellar, Achilleon and plantar fascia entheses were scored according to the 0-36 Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring System (GUESS) and power Doppler (PD). Correlations of GUESS and PD with IBD features [duration, type (CD/UC) and activity (disease activity index for CD/Truelove score for UC)] were investigated. The intra- and inter-reader agreements for US were estimated in all images detected in patients and controls. Of the 81 patients, 71 (92.6%) presented almost one tendon alteration with mean GUESS 5.1 (3.5): 81.5% thickness (higher than controls P < 0.05), 67.9% enthesophytosis, 27.1% bursitis and 16.1% erosions. PD was positive in 13/81 (16%) patients. In controls, US showed only enthesophytes (5%) and no PD. GUESS and PD were independent of duration, activity or type (CD/UC) of IBD. The intra- and inter-reader agreements were high (>0.9 intra-class correlation variability). US entheseal abnormalities are present in IBD patients without clinical signs and symptoms of SpA. US enthesopathy is independent of activity, duration and type of gut disease.\n\nSigns, symptoms, and treatment patterns across serial ambulatory cardiology visits in patients with heart failure: insights from the NCDR PINNACLEÂ® registry.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllen, Larry A; Tang, Fengming; Jones, Philip; Breeding, Tracie; Ponirakis, Angelo; Turner, Stuart J\n\n2018-05-03\n\nDue to a relative lack of outpatient heart failure (HF) clinical registries, we aimed to describe symptoms, signs, and medication treatment among ambulatory patients with heart failure (HF) over time. Using health records from 234 PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) U.S. cardiology practices (2008-2014), serial visits for patients with HF were characterized. Symptoms, signs, and HF medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB], beta blockers [BB], and diuretics) were compared between visits. Among 763,331 patients with HF, 550,581 had â¥2 clinic visits <â1Â year apart, with 2,998,444 visit pairs. In the 12Â months following an index visit, patients had a mean of 2.5âÂ±â2.3 additional visits. Recorded index visit symptoms ranged from dyspnea (53.6%) to orthopnea (23.1%); signs ranged from peripheral edema (52.2%) to hepatomegaly (0.6%). Of those with ejection fraction <â40%, ACEI was prescribed in 58.6%, ARB in 18.5%, BB in 85.2%, and diuretics in 70.0%. Between-visit recorded changes were infrequent: dyspnea appeared in 3.8%, resolved in 2.7%; NYHA class increased in 2.9%, decreased in 2.9%; number of signs increased in 6.0%, decreased in 5.1%; ACEI/ARB or BB added in 6.4%, removed in 6.2%; diuretic added in 3.7%, removed in 3.8%. Changes in recorded symptoms were rarely associated with initiation or discontinuation in HF medication classes. Ambulatory HF care in U.S. cardiology practices seldom recorded changes in symptoms, signs, and medication class. Although templated medical records and absence of medication dosing likely underestimated the degree to which clinical changes occur over serial visits for HF, these PINNACLE data suggest opportunities for greater symptom-based and therapy-focused visits.\n\nNeuropsychiatric signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease: NewÂ treatment paradigms.\n\nPubMed\n\nLanctÃ´t, Krista L; Amatniek, Joan; Ancoli-Israel, Sonia; Arnold, Steven E; Ballard, Clive; Cohen-Mansfield, Jiska; Ismail, Zahinoor; Lyketsos, Constantine; Miller, David S; Musiek, Erik; Osorio, Ricardo S; Rosenberg, Paul B; Satlin, Andrew; Steffens, David; Tariot, Pierre; Bain, Lisa J; Carrillo, Maria C; Hendrix, James A; Jurgens, Heidi; Boot, Brendon\n\n2017-09-01\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), causing substantial distress for both people with dementia and their caregivers, and contributing to early institutionalization. They are among the earliest signs and symptoms of neurocognitive disorders and incipient cognitive decline, yet are under-recognized and often challenging to treat. With this in mind, the Alzheimer's Association convened a Research Roundtable in May 2016, bringing together experts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies to discuss the latest understanding of NPSs and review the development of therapeutics and biomarkers of NPSs in AD. This review will explore the neurobiology of NPSs in AD and specific symptoms common in AD such as psychosis, agitation, apathy, depression, and sleep disturbances. In addition, clinical trial designs for NPSs in AD and regulatory considerations will be discussed.\n\nVaginal flora alterations and clinical symptoms in low-risk pregnant women.\n\nPubMed\n\nGondo, Fausto; da Silva, MÃ¡rcia G; Polettini, Jossimara; Tristao, AndrÃ©a da R; Peracoli, JosÃ© C; Witkin, Steven S; Rudge, Marilza V C\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTo evaluate associations between alterations in vaginal flora and clinical symptoms in low-risk pregnant women. Vaginal specimens from 245 pregnant women were analyzed by microscopy for vaginal flora. Signs and symptoms of vaginal infection were determined by patient interviews and gynecologic examinations. Abnormal vaginal flora was identified in 45.7% of the subjects. The final clinical diagnoses were bacterial vaginosis (21.6%), vaginal candidosis (10.2%), intermediate vaginal flora (5.2%), aerobic vaginitis (2.9%), mixed flora (2.9%) and other abnormal findings (2.9%). The percentage of women with or without clinical signs or symptoms was not significantly different between these categories. The presence of vaginal odor or vaginal discharge characteristics was not diagnostic of any specific flora alteration; pruritus was highly associated with candidosis (p < 0.0001). Compared to women with normal flora, pruritus was more prevalent in women with candidosis (p < 0.0001), while vaginal odor was associated with bacterial vaginosis (p = 0.0026). The prevalence of atypical vaginal flora is common in our low-risk pregnant population and is not always associated with pathology. The occurrence of specific signs or symptoms does not always discriminate between women with different types of atypical vaginal flora or between those with abnormal and normal vaginal flora.

Two authors independently searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included articles if they contained data on the accuracy of symptoms or signs of streptococcal pharyngitis, individually or combined into prediction rules, in children 3-18 years of age. Thirty-eight articles with data on individual symptoms and signs and 15 articles with data on prediction rules metÂ all inclusion criteria. In children with sore throat, the presence of a scarlatiniform rash (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.91; 95% CI, 2.00-7.62), palatal petechiae (LR, 2.69; CI, 1.92-3.77), pharyngeal exudates (LR, 1.85; CI, 1.58-2.16), vomiting (LR, 1.79; CI, 1.58-2.16), and tender cervical nodes (LR, 1.72; CI, 1.54-1.93) were moderately useful in identifying those with streptococcal pharyngitis. Nevertheless, no individual symptoms or signs were effective in ruling in or ruling out streptococcal pharyngitis. Symptoms and signs, either individually or combined into prediction rules, cannot be used to definitively diagnose or rule out streptococcal pharyngitis. Copyright ÃÂ© 2012 Mosby, Inc.

The accuracy with which patients and parents report signs and symptoms of GAS has not been studied. Our objectives were to measure agreement between patient or parent and physician-reported signs and symptoms of GAS and to evaluate the performance of a modified Centor score, based on patient or parent and physician reports, for identifying patients at low risk for GAS pharyngitis. Children 3 to 21 years old presenting to a single tertiary care emergency department between October 2013 and January 2015 were included if they complained of a sore throat and were tested for GAS. Patients or parents and physicians completed surveys assessing signs and symptoms to determine a modified age-adjusted Centor score for GAS. We evaluated the overall agreement and Îº between patient or parent and physician-reported signs and symptoms and compared the performance of the scores based on assessments by patients or parents and physicians and the risk of GAS. Of 320 patients enrolled, 107 (33%) tested GAS positive. Agreement was higher for symptoms (fever [agreement = 82%, Îº = 0.64] and cough [72%, 0.45]) than for signs (exudate [80%, 0.41] and tender cervical nodes [73%, 0.18]). Agreement was highest when no signs and symptoms contained in the Centor score were present (94%, Îº = 0.61). The proportion of patients testing GAS positive rose as the modified Centor score increased. For identifying GAS pharyngitis, patients or parents and physicians showed moderate to substantial agreement for 3 of 4 key pharyngitis signs and symptoms.

In this analysis, we evaluated the effect of pasireotide treatment on signs and symptoms in patients with Cushing's disease. Phase III study with double-blind randomization of two pasireotide doses. Patients (n = 162) with persistent/recurrent or de novo Cushing's disease and urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels â¥1Â·5Ã upper limit of normal (ULN) were randomized to receive subcutaneous pasireotide (600/900 Î¼g bid). At month 3, patients with UFC â¤2 Ã ULN and not exceeding the baseline value continued their randomized dose; all others received 300 Î¼g bid uptitration. At month 6, patients could enter an open-label phase until month 12 with a maximal dose of 1200 Î¼g bid. Changes in signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism over 12 months' treatment in patients still enroled in the study and with evaluable measurements were assessed in relation to degree of UFC control. Reductions in blood pressure were observed even without full UFC control and were greatest in patients who did not receive antihypertensive medications during the study. Significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were observed in patients who achieved UFC control. Reductions in BMI, weight and waist circumference occurred during the study even without full UFC control. Adverse effects were typical of somatostatin analogues except for hyperglycaemia-related events, which were experienced by 72Â·8% of patients. In the largest Phase III study of medical therapy in Cushing's disease, significant improvements in signs and symptoms were seen during 12 months of pasireotide treatment, as UFC levels decreased.

This particular patient population represents a severely psychotic sample: mean +/- SD PANSS total scores at baseline were 129.26 +/- 19.76. After I week of olanzapine treatment, mean PANSS total score was decreased significantly (-13.14; p < .001), as was mean PANSS total score after 6 weeks of olanzapine treatment (-45.16; p < .001); additionally, the positive subscale, negative subscale, and mood scores improved significantly. A significant improvement in the catatonic signs and symptoms composite score was also observed at week 6 (-4.96; p < .001). The mean +/- SD daily dose of olanzapine was 18.00 +/- 2.89 mg after 6 weeks of treatment. The present data analysis suggests the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of severely ill schizophrenic patients with nonspecified catatonic signs and symptoms.\n\nSigns and symptoms that precede wheezing in children with a pattern of moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing.\n\nPubMed\n\nRivera-Spoljaric, Katherine; Chinchilli, Vernon M; Camera, Lindsay J; Zeiger, Robert S; Paul, Ian M; Phillips, Brenda R; Taussig, Lynn M; Strunk, Robert C; Bacharier, Leonard B\n\n2009-06-01\n\nTo examine parent-reported signs and symptoms as antecedents of wheezing in preschool children with previous moderate to severe wheezing episodes, and to determine the predictive capacity of these symptom patterns for wheezing events. Parents (n = 238) of children age 12 to 59 months with moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing enrolled in a year-long clinical trial completed surveys that captured signs and symptoms at the start of a respiratory tract illness (RTI). Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value (PPV) for each symptom leading to wheezing during that RTI were calculated. The most commonly reported first symptom categories during the first RTI were \"nose symptoms\" (41%), \"significant cough\" (29%), and \"insignificant cough\" (13%). The most reliable predictor of subsequent wheezing was significant cough, which had a specificity of 78% and a PPV of 74% for predicting wheezing. Significant cough is the most reliable antecedent of wheezing during an RTI. It may be useful to consider individualized symptom patterns as a component of management plans intended to minimize wheezing episodes.\n\nWhich on-field signs/symptoms predict protracted recovery from sport-related concussion among high school football players?\n\nPubMed\n\nLau, Brian C; Kontos, Anthony P; Collins, Michael W; Mucha, Anne; Lovell, Mark R\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThere has been increasing attention and understanding of sport-related concussions. Recent studies show that neurocognitive testing and symptom clusters may predict protracted recovery in concussed athletes. On-field signs and symptoms have not been examined empirically as possible predictors of protracted recovery. This study was undertaken to determine which on-field signs and symptoms were predictive of a protracted (â¥21 days) versus rapid (â¤7 days) recovery after a sports-related concussion. On-field signs and symptoms included confusion, loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, retrograde amnesia, imbalance, dizziness, visual problems, personality changes, fatigue, sensitivity to light/noise, numbness, and vomiting. Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. The sample included 107 male high school football athletes who completed computerized neurocognitive testing within an average 2.4 days after injury, and who were followed until returned to play as determined by neuropsychologists using international clinical concussion management guidelines. Athletes were then grouped into rapid (â¤7 days, n = 62) or protracted (â¥21 days, n = 36) recovery time groups. The presence of on-field signs and symptoms was determined at the time of injury by trained sports medicine professionals (i.e., ATC [certified athletic trainer], team physician). A series of odds ratios with Ï(2) analyses and subsequent logistic regression were used to determine which on-field signs and symptoms were associated with an increased risk for a protracted recovery. Dizziness at the time of injury was associated with a 6.34 odds ratio (95% confidence interval = 1.34-29.91, Ï(2) = 5.44, P = .02) of a protracted recovery from concussion. Surprisingly, the remaining on-field signs and symptoms were not associated with an increased risk of protracted recovery in the current study. Assessment of on-field dizziness may help identify high school athletes at risk for a protracted\n\nExercise-induced nausea and vomiting: another sign and symptom of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKing, Kathryn S; Darmani, Nissar A; Hughes, Marybeth S; Adams, Karen T; Pacak, Karel\n\n2010-06-01\n\nA cohort of nine patients, mostly young adults, presented with a new sign/symptom of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: exercise-induced nausea and vomiting. The aims of this article are to introduce this sign/symptom and offer a possible hypothesis for the observation. Following a 2000 report from a paraganglioma patient experiencing exercise-induced nausea and vomiting, we began asking patients about instances of nausea and vomiting with exercise. A total of nine patients, 4.4% of our pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma population, presented with reports of exercise-induced nausea and vomiting, initially with moderate-to-intense levels of exercise, at the first presentation of their disease. All of these patients reported a cessation of exercise-induced nausea and vomiting following the removal of their primary tumor. Two patients with metastatic disease to the lungs reported a recurrence of exercise-induced nausea and vomiting. The majority of patients studied were young adults with mean onset age of 19.4Â years (range of 9-51Â years) and the mean age of diagnosis being 24.1Â years (range of 11-53Â years). Exercise-induced nausea and vomiting should be considered a sign/symptom of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and should be addressed in the clinical evaluation of these patients, especially in young adults. Whether exercise-induced elevated catecholamine levels could account for the induced nausea and vomiting via activation of adrenergic receptors in the area postrema remains to be established.\n\nJaw symptoms and signs and the connection to cranial cervical symptoms and post-traumatic stress during the first year after a whiplash trauma.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeverinsson, Yvonne; Bunketorp, Olle; Wenneberg, Bengt\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTo estimate the prevalence of jaw symptoms and signs during the first year after a neck sprain in a car collision. Further, to determine their relationships to the localisation and grade of the initial neck symptoms and signs, headache, post-traumatic stress and crash characteristics. One hundred and forty-six adult subjects and crash characteristics were prospectively investigated in an in-depth study during 1997-2001. Head, neck, and jaw symptoms and signs were recorded within 5 weeks and after 1 year. Acute post-traumatic stress was estimated with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Jaw symptoms were initially reported by three men (5%) and three women (4%), and subsequently developed in eight women (10%) during the following year. Jaw signs were noted initially in 53 subjects (37%) and in 28 subjects (24%) after 1 year, without difference between sexes, and more often after low-speed impacts. Headache in females, cranial cervical symptoms, pronounced neck problems, post-traumatic stress and whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) grade II-III after rear-end impacts were related to jaw signs during the acute phase. After 1 year, jaw signs were related to residual neck problems, headache and post-traumatic stress. Jaw symptoms are seldom reported during the acute phase after a whiplash trauma. Women more often than men develop jaw symptoms during the first year. Jaw symptoms and signs may develop also after low-speed impacts, especially after rear-end collisions. Jaw symptoms and signs should be observed after whiplash trauma, especially in those with headache, pronounced neck problems, cranial neck symptoms and post-traumatic stress.\n\nInfluence of headache frequency on clinical signs and symptoms of TMD in subjects with temple headache and TMD pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnderson, Gary C.; John, Mike T.; Ohrbach, Richard; Nixdorf, Donald R.; Schiffman, Eric L.; Truelove, Edmond S.; List, Thomas\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe relationship of the frequency of temple headache to signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) was investigated in a subset of a larger convenience sample of community TMD cases. The study sample included: 86 painful TMD, non-headache subjects; 309 painful TMD subjects with varied frequency of temple headaches; and 149 subjects without painful TMD or headache for descriptive comparison. Painful TMD included Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) diagnoses of myofascial pain, TMJ arthralgia and TMJ osteoarthritis. Mild to moderate intensity temple headaches were classified by frequency using criteria based on the ICHD-II classification of TTH. Outcomes included TMD signs and symptoms (pain duration, pain intensity, number of painful masticatory sites on palpation, mandibular range of motion), PPTs and temple headache resulting from masticatory provocation tests. Trend analyses across the painful TMD groups showed a substantial trend for aggravation of all of the TMD signs and symptoms associated with increased frequency of the temple headaches. In addition, increased headache frequency showed significant trends associated with reduced PPTs and reported temple headache with masticatory provocation tests. In conclusion, these findings suggest that these headaches may be TMD-related, as well as a possible role for peripheral and central sensitization in TMD patients.

Particularly, respiratory depression, track marks and hemorrhages, skin \"popping\", practices of phlebotomy, tissue necrosis and ulceration, dermatitis, tongue hyperpigmentation, \"coma blisters\", intra-arterial administration, candidiasis, wounds associated with anthrax or clostridium contaminated heroin, desomorphine related lesions and characteristic non-biological evidences are some commonly reported findings in opioids abuse, which will be discussed. For this purpose, clinical and forensic cases from our database (National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, North Branch, Portugal), in addition to literature data, are reviewed.\n\nPrevalent Signs and Symptoms in Patients with Skin Cancer and Nursing Diagnoses.\n\nPubMed\n\nLisboa, Isabel Neves Duarte; Azevedo Macena, Monica Suela de; Conceicao Dias, Maria Isabel Fernandes da; Almeida Medeiros, Ana Beatriz de; Lima, Cyndi Fernandes de; Carvalho Lira, Ana Luisa Brandao de\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSkin cancer has a remarkable importance given the high incidence in the population. In Brazil, it is estimated that there were 98,420 new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer among men and 83,710 new cases among women in 2014. To verify signs and symptoms present in patients with skin neoplasms according to the literature and relate them to the nursing diagnoses of NANDA International. Integrative literature review carried out from March to May 2015 in the databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, SCOPUS, National Library of Medicine and Nattional Institutes of Health, Latin American and Caribbean Sciences of Health and Web of Science. The descriptors used were: 'Signs and Symptoms' and 'Skin Neoplasms'. Sixteen articles were identified as the final sample. After review, the signs and symptoms of skin cancer identified in the literature were related to the defining characteristics present in NANDA International, with the aim to trace possible nursing diagnoses.
