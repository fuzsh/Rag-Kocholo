J. CLARKE PUBLISHING COMPANY 1926 3 3' a. Banks and Bankers CONTINENTAL AND COMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK. Chicago. On December 12, 1864, in an office in Clark street, between Lake and South Water streets, several men had a meeting. Their names were P. R. Westfall, William H. Ennis, Charles Ennis, Robert B. Ennis, Moses S. Bacon, and Nicho- las 0. Williams. With the exception of Robert B. Ennis, these men comprised the first board of directors of the Commercial National Bank of Chicago, which was then and there organized. Mails may have been slow in 18(51 but Chicago moved fast. A month and a day later the bank was given a certificate of author- ity to do business. The certificate was issued and signed by Hugh McCulloch, first comptroller of the currency, and its date was January 13, 1865. The capital stock of this seedling was two hundred thousand dollars and the privi- lege was given of increasing it to five hundred thousand dollars. The capital stock of the Commercial National Bank was increased to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in October, 1866, and to five hundred thou- sand dollars in March, 1868. Its home was destroyed in the fire of 1871, and finally the concern obtained three rooms in a dwelling house at 532 Wabash avenue and did business over a counter hastily constructed of pine boards. The floors of the frame building were not strong enough to bear the weight of the safe, Avhich was under guard in the street. Despite the devastation the losses of the bank were negligible. In March, 1883, the Continental National Bank was chartered. John C. Black was the moving spirit and among his associates the chief one was P. D. Armour. The capital of the bank was two million dollars, which was more than ample at the time and was not increased until eighteen years later. The difference between the two-hundred-thousand-dollar initial capital of the Commercial National and the two million dollars of the Continental National marked with reasonable clearness the progress Chicago had made in nineteen years. The period of greatest banking development in Chicago had, however, not yet arrived. Banks grew in capital and resources, but inadequacy to fill business requirements was met by forming new banks. • In the early '90s the following banks were among those doing business in Chicago: The Interna- tional Bank, Globe National Bank, National Bank of North America, American Trust and Savings Bank, Lincoln National Bank, Bankers National Bank, Federal Trust and Savings Bank, Mutual Bank. In due course all of these banks were consolidated or merged in various ways to make the Continental and Commercial organization of 1910. The second president of the Commercial National Bank was Henry F. 5 6 FINANCING AN EMPIRE Eames. He succeeded P. P. Westfall in 1866 and held the office until 1898. In that year Mr. Eames was succeeded by James H. Eckels, who had been comptroller of the currency. Mr. Eckels brought with him John C. McKeon and Joseph T. Talbert. The former was vice president and the latter cashier. These were men of wide acquaintance in the banking and business world. The policy of the bank became more aggressive. The year before Mr. Eckels became president of the Commercial National, that is in 1897, George M. Reynolds came to the Continental Bank as cashier. In 1900 the deposits of the Continental National Bank had reached thirty-one million dollars. In 1901 the capital stock of the Continental was increased to three million dollars and the year following Mr. Reynolds was elected vice president. In 1905, deposits passed the fifty-million mark. In 1906, John C. Black relinquished the presidency in favor of Mr. Reynolds and the bank's capital was raised to four million dollars. The panic of 1907 was the result of an expansion which was too rapid for the inelastic currency and fixed credit system. In the acute distress brought on by panic conditions, Mr. Reynolds found opportunity for bringing the Continental Bank to the front. When cash payments were all but uni- versally suspended and clearing-house certificates were in common use, he telegraphed offers of help to other banks: If the Continental Bank was held in great regard by its correspondents before, it now reached a new high point of popularity. The offer of help was a display of courage and contributed its share in staying the panic and hastening the return of confidence. The passage of the Aldrich-Vreeland Currency Act by congress followed. At the invitation of the National Monetary Commission, whose creation was provided for in that act, Mr. Reynolds participated in the formulation of plans for what is now the Federal Reserve System. For many years Mr. Rey- nolds took an active part in the deliberations of the American Bankers Asso- ciation, culminating in his election to the presidency of the association. The Commercial National had built its deposit account up to fifty million dollars, without merger or consolidation when on September 1, 1909, it took over the Bankers National Bank. The Bankers National Bank was a promi- nent institution and had deposits in excess of twenty million dollars. As a part of this consolidation plan the capital stock of the Commercial National was increased to seven million dollars. The Bankers National made, therefore, an important addition to the components of what subsequently became the Continental and Commercial National Bank. On April 1, 1910, the capital stock of the Commercial National Bank was increased to eight million dollars. At the same time the Commercial Trust and Savings Bank was organized with capital of one million dollars. Early in 1910 negotiations were opened by the Continental Bank's officials with the directors of the Commercial National Bank with a view to unifying these two interests. The negotiations were brought to a successful conclusion and on August 1, 1910, the Continental National Bank and the Commercial National Bank were merged under the name of the Continental and Commer- cial National Bank of Chicago. The new bank had a capital of twenty million dollars and surplus of ten million dollars. HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 7 The number of banks which were consolidated or merged before the final consolidation of interests August 1, 1910, had been reduced to four major units in the year preceding. The four institutions were the Continental Na- tional Bank, the Commercial National Bank, the Commercial Trust and Sav- ings Bank and the American Trust and Savings Bank. As a part of the general merger the American Trust and Savings Bank and the Commercial Trust and Savings Bank were consolidated under the name of Continental and Com- mercial Trust and Savings Bank. The capital stock of this institution was owned by the stockholders of the National Bank. Thus the union of national and state bank — of commercial, savings, trust and investment business — was insured. The consolidation of the Continental National Bank and the Commercial National Bank and of the American Trust and Savings and the Commercial Trust and Savings created a new institution which, in point of size and scope, became Chicago's leading bank. The capital stock of the National Bank, twenty million dollars, with that of the Trust and Savings Bank, three mil- lion dollars, gave the new institution a total of twenty-three million dollars which, with surplus and undivided profits of ten million dollars, brought to thirty-three million dollars the amount of invested capital. Total deposits were one hundred and seventy-five million dollars and total resources reached the imposing figure of two hundred and sixteen million dollars. In one of the circulars announcing the purpose to consolidate these institutions it was said that \"the dominating idea was not alone the promotion of the interests of our respective stockholders, but also, and in no less a degree, the creation of bank- ing facilities of such superior excellence as only an organization and business of the magnitude of the prospective Continental and Commercial National Bank can offer. * * * We confidently believe that this consolidation will prove to be of the greatest benefit to our customers and provide Chicago and the west with a bank commensurate with their financial and commercial im- portance.\" Opportunity came to \"effect a unity of the interests of the stockholders of the Continental and Commercial National Bank and of the Hibernian Bank- ing Association.'' This was accomplished in November, 1918, when the latter was consolidated with the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank. With the great increase in the volume of business transacted and the larger number of employes, however, came added burdens of administration. The officers of the banks were busy men. The very mass of the business en- gaged their entire time, and it was decided to bring into the bank a man who could assume a share of the burden incident to the ultimate determination of policies; who, instead of devoting himself to the routine business of the day, could study the institution in its larger aspects, who could organize or reorgan- ize, if occasion demanded, and carry out new things he might plan. For that work the directors selected as first vice president, Arthur Reynolds, who, in January, 1915, left the Des Moines National Bank, of which he had been president for more than twenty years and which had been built up under his management into one of the largest banks in Iowa. Mr. Reynolds had won 8 FINANCING AN EMPIRE a place for himself in the banking and business world. He had held all of the major offices in the American Bankers Association, including the presidency. The Continental and Commercial Banks were not strangers to him. He natu- rally knew their history and was familiar with their methods and the policy which had made them succeed. With a broad background of business expe- rience, a keen credit insight and a gift for organization, he was peculiarly fitted to assist in their administration. In addition to his work in the Na- tional Bank. Mr. Reynolds gave a great deal of attention to the Trust and Savings Bank. Here, as in the National Bank, his efforts met with marked success, and in November, 1918, he was elected president of the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank. At the same time George M. Key nolds was elected chairman of the board of directors. In October, 1919, the Continental and Commercial Securities Company was organized. Its capital of one million dollars and surplus of seventy-four thou- sand, five hundred and sixty-five dollars was provided for by a stock dividend of five per cent on the shares of the National Bank. The stockholding relation- ship between this company and the stockholders of the National Bank is tho same as that of the Trust and Savings Bank. Arthur Reynolds was the origi- nator and the moving spirit in the organization of the Securities Company and also became its president. At the annual meeting of the directors of the Continental and Commercial National Bank in January, 1921, George M. Reynolds was elected chairman of the board of directors and Arthur Reynolds became president. When the Fort Dearborn Banks were absorbed a year later the Continental and Com- mercial Banks attained the form in which they are today. The last unit to be added to the Continental and Commercial group was made up of the Fori Dearborn National Bank and the Fort Dearborn Trust and Savings Bank. This transaction brought the deposits and resources of the Continental and Commercial Banks to amounts unprecedented in the west. The development of the banks which were the components of the Conti- nental and Commercial group brought many buildings into existence in the course of forty years. The Continental National Bank had its home for many years in an old-fashioned brick building at the corner of LaSalle and Adams streets. This corner is part of the site of the Continental and Commercial Bank building. Mr. Reynolds held to that corner tenaciously after the bank moved to the building erected by the American Trust and Savings Bank at the corner of Clark and Monroe streets. This building, comparatively small by present standards, was a fine addition to Chicago's bank and office buildings when it was erected. Its banking quarters were larger than the American Trust and Savings Bank needed, and part of it was rented. When the Continental National Bank moved there, the space was none too large. Its resi- dence in that building was, however, of short duration. In 1907 the Com- mercial National Bank built for itself a great bank and office building at the corner of Clark and Adams streets. That building, now owned and occupied by the Commonwealth Edison Company, was designed on a large scale and was intended to provide ample space for a bank of greater proportions than its ambitious constructors could conceive. When the final consolidation of (Courtesy of Graham, Burnham & Co.. Architects.) CONTINENTAL AND COMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 11 banking interests was made in 1910 this building became the home of the Continental and Commercial Banks. The new banks made such strides, how- ever, that it soon became apparent that larger quarters would be desirable, if not absolutely necessary. The ambitions of George M. Reynolds were not satisfied to have brought into existence a great banking group. He began to imagine a home for the institution that would measure up in size and quality to the banks. Growing business hastened the decision. The old home of the Continental National offered a nucleus for a site. In due course and after long negotiations, the entire block bounded by LaSalle, Adams, Quincy and AVells streets was secured. The buildings on it were many and some were modern. It was a gigantic enterprise whose conception, planning and execu- tion called not less for courage than for architectural, engineering and artistic skill. The Continental and Commercial Bank building, at the time of its completion, was the largest office building in the world. The building is three hundred and twenty-five feet long and one hundred and sixty-six feet wide, and contains approximately two thousand offices. Its great glory is the main banking room occupied by the National Bank. In Oc- tober, 1914, the Continental and Commercial National Bank, the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank and the Hibernian Banking Asso- ciation moved into the new building. Thus there came finally to an end the trend begun in 1865 and continued with ever-increasing force while the nine- teenth was giving way to the twentieth century. The many combinations, buildings, movings, and changes came to rest in this great building where the product of the bank melting pot was completely housed under one roof. The Continental and Commercial group of banks, the product of forty years of growth and development, was in one building which typified in stone and steel and marble its strength and size. Here was equipment to give to Chicago and the west the banking service they required. A picture of the diversified activities of the Continental and Commercial Banks would have the world for its background. Like the business which flows to and from Chicago, that of the banks knows no territorial limitations. The general divisions of this banking institution are, of course, commercial bank- ing, foreign exchange, savings, trusts, bonds and investments, safe deposit and the Securities Company, but the National Bank alone has fifty-two depart- ments and the Trust and Savings Bank about twenty. The primary function of the National Bank is the transaction of commercial banking business. In scope, diversity and volume this exceeds the business of all other departments. The commercial banking business falls naturally into two classifications — re- lations with banks, and relations with individuals, firms and corporations. The statement of the Continental and Commercial National Bank at the be- ginning of the year showed capital stock of twenty-five million dollars, sur- plus and profits amounting to twenty-two million, two hundred and ten thousand, two hundred dollars and total deposits of four hundred and twenty- eight million, three hundred and sixty-one thousand, one hundred and thirty dollars. The Continental and Commercial banking group is composed of four cor- 12 FINANCING AN EMPIRE porations with the common title applied to National Bank, Trust and Savings Bank, Safe Deposit Company, and Securities Company. The entire capital stock of two of these corporations is owned by the stockholders of the National Bank under a trust agreement, but the Safe Deposit Company is owned by the National Bank. This banking group is original in form, indigenous to Chicago, amply capitalized, thoroughly equipped, highly organized and competently directed to serve the city and the district whose marvelous growth and com- mercial development could have been paralleled in no other way. The official personnel of the Continental and Commercial National Bank at this time is as follows: George M. Reynolds, chairman board of directors; Arthur Reynolds, president; Ralph Van Vechten, Herman Waldeck, William T. Bruckner, John R. Washburn, John F. Craddock, Cyrus A. Barr, Wilson W. Lampert, James R. Leavell, Edward E. Barker, George H. Wilson, Dan Norman and William G. Mackintosh, vice presidents; Charles Fernald, H. F. Studt and Abner J.

White, W. J. Delaney, R. A. Aishton, D. C. Clark, Willard G. Butler and Fred C. Ven- ables, assistant cashiers. The members of the board of directors are J. Ogden Armour, Alex F. Banks, Eugene J.

The capital stock of the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago is owned by the stockholders of the Continental and Commercial National Bank of Chicago and is one of the group of affiliated and commonly owned institutions known as the Continental and Commercial Banks. The group is composed of four corporations with the common title applied to Na- tional Bank, Trust and Savings Bank, Safe Deposit Company, and Securities Company. The institutional organization is never lost within but from the outside point of view the Trust and Savings Bank is a separate thing. It has a state charter and, therefore, another supervising agency. In its main divi- sions it is comprised of a banking department, which does a commercial busi- ness, a savings department, a trust department and a bond department. In its statement at the beginning of the year 1926 the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank showed capital of five million dollars, surplus and profits amounting to eleven million, eight hundred and fifty-three HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 13 thousand, seven hundred and seventy dollars and deposits totaling one hun- dred million, four hundred and thirteen thousand, nine hundred and sixty dollars. The official personnel of the Continental and Commercial Trust and Sav- ings Bank is as follows: George M. Reynolds, chairman; Arthur Reynolds, president; John Jay Abbott, Hugh H. Saxon, D. R. Lewis and Henry C. 01- eott, vice presidents ; John A. Shannon, cashier ; Robert J. Hercock, Albert S. Martin, George Allan and J. S. Macf erran, assistant cashiers ; William P. Kopf, secretary; Everett R. McFadden, E. J. Claussen, Kinney Smith, AVil- liam H. A. Johnson, Samuel Witting, R. D. Cameron, assistant secretaries; George W. Pearson, vice president and manager of the bond department; Walter J. Engle, G. A. Waldorf and Edward Schranz, .Jr., assistant managers of the bond department ; Ernest D. Brooks, manager of sales, bond department ; W. K. McCracken, assistant sales manager, bond department; John P. V. Murphy, manager savings department; and D. Ed Jones ami John E. Shea, assistant managers savings department. The members of the board of direc- tors are J. Ogden Armour, John Jay Abbott, A. F. Banks, Ed F. Carry, B. A. Eckhart, William F. Hayes, D. F. Kelly, David R. Lewis, Robert T. Lincoln. Robert H. McElwee, D. R. McLennan, Thomas J. MeNulty, Henry C. Olcott, Arthur Reynolds, George M. Reynolds, Ralph Van Vechten and F. Edson White. george mcclelland Reynolds. In the \"Who's Who\" of George M. Reynolds, chairman of the board of directors of the Continental and Commercial National Bank, the first notation is that he was born in Panora, Iowa, January 15, 1865; the second that, after being graduated from the Guthrie County high school in 1879, he became a clerk in the Guthrie County National Bank. From this business beginning, at the age of fourteen Mr. Reynolds made his own way to his success. He was not content to be a bank clerk long. He was not content to work within the confines, physical or economic, of the village where he was born. In 1886 he went to Hastings, Nebraska, where he engaged in the farm loan and mortgage business. In the meantime he had been married to Miss Elizabeth Hay in Panora, and found his domestic responsibilities a justification for seeking larger opportunities. However, the bank in Panora, established by his father, reasserted its claims to him and in 1886, he was back there as cashier and manager. It was a responsible position for a young man and it held him until 1893, when he went to the Des Moines National Bank as cashier. He became president of that institution in 1895 and in that two years he won a reputation for farsightedness and decisiveness that stretched out beyond Des Moines as his record in Panora had previously reached out over Iowa. In 1897 he went to Chicago to become cashier of the Continental National Bank. In this larger field the same qualities that had carried him from Panora to Des Moines asserted themselves and he was soon recognized as a strong factor in banking and business affairs in Chicago. Under the spur of his aggressiveness, the Continental National Bank grew in size and importance. He grew with it. In May, 1902, he was elected vice president and in January, 1906, he became president. The reasons for this progress that carried a country boy to the presidency are not far to seek. The force that was driving banking as well as other business for- ward in Chicago found in Mr. Reynolds a new ally. He was not wedded to con- ventions or traditions. His idea was that banking was created for business and 14 FINANCING AN EMPIRE that old ways and traditions were entitled to respect only if they contributed to the service that banks owed business. He had broad views and he had courage. He won his way within the bank by close attention to the bank's business and by insistence upon conduct which, to his mind, accorded with sound banking practice. He found time to develop business from without while developing organization within. He was keenly interested in country banks and the expansion of their facilities. One form of expansion was close relationships with their city corre- spondents and in this field he was particularly successful. The advantages which the large city bank would have in the cultivation of relationships with country banks were recognized by Mr. Reynolds. It was due largely to him that the Continental National absorbed the International Bank and the Globe National in 1898. Those two absorptions marked the beginning of a long series of increases in capitalization and mergers which came to a climax on August 1, 1910, when the Continental National and the Commercial National banks were merged under the present name. The new institution had a capital of twenty million dollars and surplus of ten million dollars. It was the largest bank outside of New York and larger than most of them there. George M. Reynolds was its president. There were other elements which contributed to make this merger of interests notable. It was found advisable, if not necessary, that a bank in Chicago should afford its customers every kind of banking service. While commercial banking was primary with both the Continental and the Commercial banks, the former had taken over the commercial business of the American Trust and Savings Bank in 1909 with the ownership of all the stock of that institution. The operation of the savings, trust and bond business was left. In April, 1910, the Commercial National Bank organized the Commercial Trust and Savings Bank. When the final combination came the two trust and savings banks were put together as well as the two commercial banks. In June, 1911, the Hibernian Banking Association was acquired. This bank, however, was not joined to the others until the new building of the Continental and Commercial was finished over two years later and it was not physically ab- sorbed until 1918. The last unit in the Continental and Commercial's banking structure was added on January 2, 1922, when the Fort Dearborn Banks were taken over under dramatic circumstances. This relation gives Mr. Reynolds' achievements as a bank builder and organizer but his capacity as a bank operator was as notable. There was a steady growth in business in every institution he managed and a steady expansion and perfection of service. Banking as a profit making machine was even less interesting to him than banking as a public need and a social service. Any sound plan for the im- provement of banking claimed his attention and study. He was elected president of the American Bankers Association and for many years took an active part in its deliberations. He was in close touch with banking legislation and was an ad- visor of the National Monetary Commission whose work paved the way for the Federal Reserve Act. In the development of this law and in the development of the Federal Reserve System thereafter Mr. Reynolds was deeply interested and very active. He has been a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ever since it was opened for business. His confidence in that system may be illustrated by his conduct when it was proposed, as a war measure, that the member banks turn over all their gold to the reserve banks. He was first to announce that the Continental and Commercial would take that step. It seems of little moment now, but in 1917 the reluctance of bankers to surrender gold was fortified by the traditions of a century. Mr. Reynolds' home is at No. 1444 Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. In politics Mr. Reynolds is a republican and he is identified with a number of the leading social organizations of this city, including the Industrial Club, of which he was president in 1907, the Chicago, Union League, Bankers, Exmoor Country and Old Elm Clubs. He holds friendship inviolable and, as true worth may always win his regard, he has a very extensive circle of friends. No plan or movement for the benefit of the city along lines of progress and improvement seeks his aid in vain. While he has attempted important things and has accomplished what he attempted, his success has never represented another's losses but has resulted from effort intelligently applied, and the generous use which he has made of his means in assisting others HISTOKY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 15 marks him as a man of kindly spirit, recognizing the obligations and responsibilities of wealth. His kindness has not been impelled by a sense of duty but by sincere interest in his fellowrnen. JOHN JAY ABBOTT. For more than a quarter of a century John Jay Abbott has been officially iden- tified with the Continental and Commercial Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago, which he has represented in the capacity of vice president since 1905. He was born in the city of New York, on the 11th of March. 1S71. his parents being John X. and Violet G- Abbott, also natives of the eastern metropolis. There he pursued his education as a public school pupil, and upon attaining his majority became connected with the Chicago Edison Company as assistant comptroller, thus serving from 1892 until 1896. In the latter year he assumed the duties of assistant general superintendent, in which position he continued with the Chicago Edison Company for three years more, or until 1S99, when he entered the Continental and Com- mercial Trust & Savings Bank, formerly the American Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago, in the capacity of assistant cashier. Three years later, in 1902, he was made cashier of the institution and in 1905 became its vice president, in which connection he has remained to the present time. His sound judgment and intimate knowledge of the banking business have long been recognized as factors of value in Chicago's financial activities. On the 22d of January. 1896. Mr. Abbott was married to Rowena C. Marsh. He is a member of the Chicago Club and the Chicago Golf Club and he enjoys high standing in social as well as banking circles of his adopted city. ALEXAXDER FREXCH BAXKS. Alexander French Banks, who entered railway service forty-eight years ago in the humble capacity of office boy. has since risen by the merit system to a prominent place in transportation circles as president of the Elgin, Joliet & East- ern Railway and also of the Chicago, Lake Shore & Eastern Railway, having thus served since May, 1901. He is likewise a factor in financial circles of Chicago as a director of the Continental & Commercial X'ational Bank, the Continental & Commercial Trust & Savings Bank and the Continental & Commercial Securities Company. Mr. Banks was born in Crawford county. Indiana, on the 31st of January. 1861. his parents being Henry Bartlett and Julia C. (French) Banks, both natives of Kentucky. He attended the public schools in the acquirement of an education and was a youth of sixteen when in 1ST 7 he obtained a position in the office of the contracting freight agent of the St. Louis & Southeastern Railway Company at Evansville. Indiana, where he subsequently discharged the duties of contracting agent from 1879 to 188 0. During the succeeding eight years he served successively as agent, traveling agent and general agent for the Continental Fast Freight Line at Peoria, Illinois, while from January until September, 1888, he represented the Iowa Central Railway as general agent at the same place. Mr. Banks continued in the service of the Iowa Central Railway as general freight agent from September. 188 S, until May, 1SS9. when he was promoted to the position of general freight and passenger agent and thus served until February. 1890. He spent the following three years as traffic manager for the same road and then in 1893 became connected in a similar capacity with the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway, thus continuing until May. 1901. He also served as traffic manager of the Chicago. Lake Shore & Eastern Railway from May 1, 1899, until May. 1901, since which time he has been its president as well as the president of the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway. The steps in his orderly pro- gression are easily discernible, indicating the wise utilization of his opportunities and the gradual unfolding and development of his powers. In financial circles his name is a familiar one as a director of the Continental & Commercial X'ational Bank, the Continental & Commercial Trust & Savings Bank, the Continental & 16 FINANCING AN EMPIRE Commercial Securities Company, the South Chicago Savings Bank and the Gary State Bank of Gary, Indiana. On the 13th of November, 1883, at Evansville, Indiana, Mr. Banks was united in marriage to Miss Blanche Nichelson. Their children are three in number, namely: Duke Nichelson, who wedded Elena Cusicauque of La Paz, Bolivia, and now resides in Santiago, Chili; Blanche Alexander, who lives in Evanston, Illinois; and Charles Ackert, who married Elizabeth Duringer of Fort Worth, Texas, and makes his home in Lake Forest, Illinois. The home of Alexander F. Banks and his wife is at No. 1204 Sheridan road in Evanston. Mr. Banks gives his political support to the republican party, while his reli- gious faith is that of the Presbyterian church. His name is on the membership rolls of the Chicago Club, the Mid-Day Club, the Old Elm Golf Club, the Glen View Golf Club and the Country Club of Evanston. As railroad executive and financier he occupies an enviable position among Illinois' leading and influential citizens and his record is a truly inspiring one. ARTHUR REYNOLDS. Long a prominent figure in the banking world, Arthur Reynolds holds an out- standing position among the financial leaders of Chicago as president of the Con- tinental and Commercial National Bank, the Continental and Commercial Trust & Savings Bank and the Continental and Commercial Securities Company. The story of his life of well directed and successful endeavor, replete with interest, holds much of inspirational value. He was born on a farm near Panora, Iowa, on the 10th of March, 1868, his parents being Elijah Jackson and Mary (Anderson) Reynolds. His maternal grandfather, who made his way to the Hawkeye state in the early days, took up forty thousand acres of government land and established his home in the vicinity of Panora. The parents of Arthur Reynolds began their domestic life in a log cabin. The father, a rugged pioneer whose tall and angular frame sug- gested that of Abraham Lincoln, hewed the furniture for the primitive dwelling from the native timber. Resourceful, industrious and courageous, he combated success- fully the conditions of pioneer life which confronted him at every turn. There was no railroad in the sparsely settled district, Indian depredations were common and wolf packs were a constant menace. Elijah J. Reynolds was a man of Puritan habits and strict religious views whose strong, determined spirit was tempered by kindliness and charity. Farming constituted the principal occupation of the men of the community, who toiled from sunrise to sunset. Under the leadership of Elijah J. Reynolds, however, there was begun the development of a business com- munity in Panora. A lumber business, an elevator, a general store, a drug store, received his attention, and he was interested in many enterprises that were started including the church, of which he was chief support for many years. Already at an early age Arthur Reynolds found his time busily occupied, for in addition to home chores he performed his share of the tasks at the school, the boy students being asked to take care of the building and the fires. Subsequently he collected the sum of one dollar per month for assuming the duties of janitor at the schoolhouse. While a student in the Guthrie county high school he worked at vari- ous occupations during the periods of vacation. When the high school was in ses- sion he acted as clerk in the drug store of his brother, Marshall Reynolds, before and after school hours. Following the completion of his high school course, Arthur Reynolds matriculated in Iowa College at Grinnell, but at the end of a year he returned to Panora to become his brother's partner in the drug store, where he intro- duced methods of progressive salesmanship that resulted in the steady growth of the business. A year after entering the drug store he secured his first position in a bank, the Guthrie County National Bank of Panora, without giving up his interest in the drug establishment. He assisted in keeping the books as well as sweeping the floors and building the fire at the bank, of which he was made assistant cashier in 1889, on attaining his majority. It was in the same year that he became mayor of Panora, while for a number of years he served as a director of the county high school. In January, 1893, he was promoted to the cashiership of the Guthrie County National Bank. The activities of the community banker ranged from the conven- tional business of making loans to helping a patron settle his family disputes. At. HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 19 this time George M. Reynolds, elder brother of Arthur Reynolds, was cashier of the Des Moines National Bank, in the capital city of the state. When the former be- came associated with the Des Moines National immediately after the panic of 1893, he found the institution in very bad shape. In 1895, his brother having been elected president of the bank, Arthur Reynolds became identified therewith in the capacity of cashier. The task of bringing the bank to a success was at first of less importance than saving the depositors from losses. This work was only fairly under way when George M. Reynolds went to Chicago, leaving his brother to succeed him as president of the Des Moines National Bank. The situation called for courage and determination; but more than either it demanded diplomacy, down- right ability, and the faculty of inspiring confidence. In the panicky times follow- ing 1893, in the face of government supervision and of competition, it will be readily seen that Arthur Reynolds, bank president at the age of twenty-seven years, encountered many difficulties. However, after three or four years the institution was permitted to pay small dividends, and in the meantime an amount greater than the bank's capital had been charged off to profit and loss. When Mr. Reynolds severed his active connection with the bank after twenty years, the deposits ex- ceeded eight million dollars. A good illustration of his ability to stimulate public interest in his business is the fact that forty thousand people of the sixty thousand living in Des Moines at that time attended the opening of a new building constructed for the Des Moines National Bank under his management. During those years in Des Moines Mr. Reynolds found time to devote to other business. He was active in several insurance companies and became very familiar with their operations. As a banker he was a close student of methods of invest- ing the funds of insurance companies and served for several years on committees having that work in charge. He was always interested in bankers' associations, first in his own state of Iowa, and soon in the American Bankers' Association, which functioned in the national field. In 1902 he became a member of the executive council of the latter organization. In 1905 he was made chairman of the federal legislative committee. It was in this committee that the famous currency commis- sion of the American Bankers' Association had its origin, and of this commission he became a member. In 1910 he was elected treasurer of the American Bankers' As- sociation, and in 1911 was chosen chairman of the executive council. In 1912 he was elected first vice president and succeeded to the presidency on the death of Charles H. Huttig. He was elected president in the following year, and has the unusual record of having served the Association as president more than twelve months. In the course of his active connection with the American Bankers' Associa- tion in official positions he was a positive factor in shaping the legislative program in connection with banking. He was a member of the currency commission which made extensive and practical studies of banking reform legislation, and was par- ticularly alert and active during the period when the present Federal Reserve System was in process of development, taking part in all the conferences of the commission and conferences between the commission and committees of congress. During this time he made many addresses in\" all parts of the country on banking reform, and he was the author of many pamphlets and articles on that and allied subjects. His business, his many connections, his studious disposition and broad interests have won him a high reputation as an authority on business and banking subjects. A contemporary biographer said of him: \"To those who know him Arthur Reynolds is a veritable dynamo of energy. A tireless worker, he has nevertheless learned by long experience the futility of looking after details. He has a long vision and a remarkable breadth of view. His mind grasps everything within range and a good many things that seem out of range. He can dissect a business plan or economic problem with all the deftness of a surgeon and he brings to the solu- tion of every question not only a keen business insight, but a genial human spirit and a kindly charity. He is distinctly human and remarkably well poised. He can- not be driven or led away from the main points in a question or argument. With directness and simplicity, two of his most pronounced characteristics, he puts a pointed finger on the essential and eliminates everything that is not. He is a discoverer of talent and a developer of men. To the latter he gives great latitude once they have displayed the necessary ability, and makes them responsible for re- sults, which count strongly, but not exclusively, with him, because he is also inter- ested in methods. All this bespealcs self-reliance and courage, which in turn are 20 ' FINANCING AN EMPIRE fortified by capacity for analysis, absence of self-deception and a sound under- standing of business principles.\" It was in January, 1915, that Arthur Reynolds left the Des Moines National Bank to accept the first vice presidency of the Continental and Commercial Na- tional Bank of Chicago, to which his brother, George M. Reynolds, had come as cashier in 1897 and of which he was then president. The group of affiliated and commonly owned institutions known as the Continental and Commercial Banks, composed of four corporations with the common title applied to National Bank, Trust & Savings Bank, Safe Deposit Company and Securities Company, had its inception in the organization of the Commercial National Bank of Chicago on the 12th of December, 1864. These banks were not strangers to Arthur Reynolds. He naturally knew their history and was familiar with their methods and the policy which had made them succeed. With a broad background of business experience, a keen credit insight and a gift for organization, he was peculiarly fitted to assist in their administration. He came to the bank with no assignment. He was free to range where he pleased. He studied the institution, bank by bank, department by department, section by section, group by group and man by man. He studied other banks and their methods. He studied new business opportunities. Investment banking, savings, trusts claimed his attention. The foreign department challenged him. Increasing the business generally was a subject always before him, and advertising and publicity plans were marked for development. In seven years of combined operation the institution may be said to have precipitated. Arthur Reynolds analyzed the precipitate. His great purpose was to bring about complete unification, the highest degree of cooperation among departments, a more perfect organization and thereby to promote efficiency and increase business. In addition to his work in the National Bank, Mr. Reynolds gave a great deal of attention to the Trust & Savings Bank. Here, as in the National Bank, his efforts met with marked success, and in November, 1918, he was elected president of the Conti- nental and Commercial Trust & Savings Bank. At the same time George M. Reynolds was elected chairman of the board of directors. In October, 1919, the Continental and Commercial Securities Company was organized. Its capital of one million dollars and surplus of seventy-four thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars was provided for by a stock dividend of five per cent on the shares of the National Bank. The stockholding relationship between this company and the stockholders of the National Bank is the same as that of the Trust & Savings Bank. Arthur Reynolds was the originator and the moving spirit in the organization of the Securities Company and is also its president. The company has met with considerable success, and today is one of the important units in the Continental and Commercial organization. Its surplus has been increased out of earnings to three million dollars and it has a large undivided profits account. At the annual meeting of the directors of the Continental and Commercial National Bank in Janu- ary, 1921, George M. Reynolds was elected chairman of the board of directors and Arthur Reynolds became president. When the Fort Dearborn Banks were absorbed a year later the Continental and Commercial Banks attained the form in which they are today. The last unit to be added to the Continental and Commercial group was made up of the Fort Dearborn National Bank and the Fort Dearborn Trust & Savings Bank. This was a dramatic event, quite different in character, cause and purpose from all those that preceded. It made a notable contribution to the mag- nitude and prestige of the Continental and Commercial Banks, bringing the deposits and resources of the Continental and Commercial Banks to amounts unprecedented in the west. Indeed the institution is now in point of resources one of the three largest in the country. In point of number of customers, volume of business, of scope and reach, it is unrivalled in the domestic field. Mr. Reynolds has written the following monographs: The Aldrich Plan; Our Banking Future; Some Needs for Banking Reform; How May We Avoid a Money Trust; Currency Reform; and Segregation of Savings Deposits. He is a director of the Continental and Commercial National Bank, the Continental and Commer- cial Trust & Savings Bank, the Continental and Commercial Securities Company, the Continental and Commercial Safe Deposit Company, the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway, the Chicago, Lake Shore & Southern Railway, the Great American Insur- ance Company, the American Alliance Insurance Company, Armour & Company of Illinois and the North American Provision Company. \"All that I have accom- plished has been due chiefly to my interest in human beings and to my belief HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 21 that human relations are the most vital thing in the world,\" said Mr. Reynolds. \"This belief is the very foundation of my business creed.\" The subjective and ob- jective forces of life are in him well balanced, making him cognizant of his own capabilities and powers, while at the same time he thoroughly understands his opportunities and his obligations. To make his native talents subserve the demands which conditions of society impose at the present time is the purpose of his life, and by reason of the mature judgment which characterizes his efforts at all times, he stands today as a splendid representative of the prominent financier and capi- talist to whom business is but one phase of life and does not exclude his active participation in and support of the other vital interests which go to make up human existence. On the 7th of October. 1902. Mr. Reynolds was united in marriage to Miss Bertha Goodrich of State Center, Iowa. ROBERT WRIGHT STEWART. Robert Wright Stewart, a director of the Continental and Commercial National Bank and the Boulevard Bridge Bank of Chicago, as well as the National City Bank of New York in New York city, has served as chairman of the board of directors of the Standard Oil Company (of Indiana) at Chicago since October, 1918. A prominent lawyer, he has continuously represented this corporation since he first became identified therewith as general attorney in South Dakota. His birth occurred at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on the 11th of March, 1867, his parents being William and Eliza Mills (Lucore) Stewart. Following the comple- tion of a high school course in his native city he entered Coe College of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, from which institution he was graduated with the degree of Bache- lor of Science in 1886. In that year he removed from Cedar Rapids to New Haven, Connecticut, in order to prepare for a professional career in Yale University, which in 1888 conferred upon him the degrees of Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws. It was in 1S89 that Mr. Stewart took up his abode in Pierre, South Dakota, for the practice of his chosen calling, in which he soon won a position of merited distinction. He served as states attorney for Hughes county, South Dakota, from 1893 until 1895, as supreme court reporter of that state from 1893 until 1899 and represented Hughes. Hyde and Sully counties of South Dakota in the state senate from 1899 until 1903, making a splendid record in each connection. In the year 1905 Mr. Stewart removed to Huron, South Dakota, as general attorney for the North Western Railroad. He also represented the International Harvester Company and the Standard Oil Company of Indiana in South Dakota, in which state he continued to reside until July, 1907, when he came to Illinois and has since remained in Chicago. Here he continued his association with the Standard Oil Company of Indiana as general attorney from 1907 until 1914, when he was made general counsel of the corporation, while -in October, 1918, he assumed his present position as chairman of the board of directors of the Standard Oil Com- pany of Indiana. The military chapter in the life record of Robert W. Stewart is an interesting one. From May until October, 189 8, he took part in the Spanish-American war as major in the Third United States Volunteer Cavalry (\"Rough Riders\"), while from 189 9 until 1907 he held the rank of colonel in the Fourth Regiment of the South Dakota National Guard. On the 14th of June, 1896. at Aberdeen, South Dakota, Mr. Stewart was united in marriage to Miss Maude Bradley Elliott. They are the parents of four chil- dren, as follows: Robert Giffen, who wedded Phyllis Shaw and resides in New York city, and is vice president and assistant to chairman of the board of the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company; James Wright, who married Miss Rose Chilleen and makes his home in New York city, and is president of the Pan American Exploration Company: and Donald William and John Elliott, living in Chicago. The residence of Mr. and Mrs. Robert W. Stewart is at No. 199 Lake Shore drive, Chicago, Illinois. In politics Mr. Stewart is a stanch republican, while his religious faith is that of the Presbyterian church. His name is on the membership rolls of the Chicago, University, Old Elm, Glen View, South Shore Country, Shore Acres, Saddle and Vol. II— 2 22 FINANCING AN EMPIRE Cycle, Chicago Yacht and Racquet Clubs of Chicago; the Metropolitan and Sleepy Hollow Clubs of New York; and the Congressional Country and Racquet Clubs of Washington, D. C. Along strictly professional lines he is a member of the Illinois Bar Association and the American Bar Association. The many sterling char- acteristics which he has displayed in the varied relations of life have gained for him the friendship and high regard of those with whom he has been associated. BERNARD ALBERT ECKHART. Bernard Albert Eckhart has long been an influential factor in the financial, industrial, commercial and civic life of the city of Chicago, where he is a stock- holder and director in large banking institutions. He was instrumental in the upbuilding of one of the leading flour-milling enterprises of the country, and his great civic loyalty and public spirit have brought to him distinguished official preferments and given him large and benignant influence in connection with public affairs. He is a director of the Continental and Commercial Banks as well as other representative financial institutions of Chicago, and he occupies a prominent position in manufacturing circles as president of the B. A. Eckhart Milling Company, which had its inception as the firm of Eckhart & Swan in 1874. Bernard Albert Eckhart was born in the province of Alsace, France, but as an infant was brought to the United States by his parents, Jacob and Eva (Root) Eckhart, who took up their abode among the pioneer settlers of Wisconsin. His early education, obtained in the public schools of that state, was supplemented by a college course in Milwaukee, where he was graduated as a youth of sixteen in 1868. From 1870 to 1874 he was the Chicago representative of the Eagle Milling Company of Milwaukee, and he then became one of the organizers of the Chicago milling firm of Eckhart & Swan. When it was later reorganized as the Eckhart & Swan Milling Company he became president of the corporation, an office of which he continued the incumbent after the present title of the B. A. Eckhart Milling Company was adopted. His progressive and resourceful administration brought this concern into foremost place in its field of enterprise, and through his associa- tion with it he laid the foundation for his substantial fortune. Mr. Eckhart is still president of the company. He is also president of the Chicago, Terre Haute & Southeastern Railway Company, is a member of the executive committee of the Continental and Commercial National Bank, a member of the executive committee of the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank, a member of the executive committee of the Harris Trust and Savings Bank and a member of the finance committee of the Chicago Title and Trust Company. His name is or the directorate of the Continental and Commercial National Bank, the Continental and Commercial Trust and Savings Bank, the Continental and Commercial Securities Company, the Continental and Commercial Safe Deposit Company, the Harris Trus* and Savings Bank, the Chicago Title and Trust Company, the Erie Railroad Company, the Chicago & Erie Railroad Company, the Chicago, Terre Haute & Southeastern Railway Company, Montgomery Ward & Company and Armour & Company, in the successful control of which his cooperation and counsel constitute valuable elements. He was also formerly a director of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank. Mr. Eckhart's marked ability as a financier has manifested itself on many occasions, particularly in October, 1904, when he effected the sale of the old National Bank of North America, which he represented as vice president and as chairman of the board, to the Continental National Bank. Owing to an unfortunate financial transaction on the part of one of its officers, the National Bank of North America was placed in such a position that the majority of the directors were in favor of closing the institution. In this crisis Mr. Eckhart submitted to the board a plan for the absorption of the National Bank of North America by the Continental National Bank, of which John C. Black was the president and George M. Reynolds the vice president, holding a continued meeting throughout the night until all legal formalities attending the sale were completed. Within a few months the value of the stock had increased considerably, and thus Mr. Eckhart not only saved the stockholders from loss but made their investment a most profitable one. He is perhaps the only individual banker who has brought to a successful culmination a financial transaction of such magnitude. ENG Br HENRY TAYLOR JR £ SON.CHGO ^^ HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 25 In the domain of public affairs and service Mr. Eckhart has made a record which reflects great honor upon his name, even as his reputation in business and in private life has ever been inviolable. He has been a stalwart and effective advocate and supporter of the cause of the republican party and has been influential in its councils in the state of his adoption. During the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth general as- semblies of the Illinois Legislature (1887-9), he was a member of the state senate, in which he served with characteristic loyalty and ability. He was instrumental in having enacted in laws many useful and progressive measures while he repre- sented the first senatorial district of Illinois in the senate, among others the statute creating the Sanitary District of Chicago. From 1891 to 1900 he was a member of the board of trustees of the Sanitary District of Chicago, of which he was president from December, 1895, to December, 1896. Preparatory to opening the canal in 1900, when the main channel was completed, he secured a permit from the United States government through General Alger, then secretary of war, to draw the waters from Lake Michigan into the canal. From July, 1905, to February, 1908, he was president of the board of West Chicago park commissioners and during that period of time reconstructed the entire West Park system and created the first small parks and playgrounds on the west side. In 1905 he was a delegate to the Chicago charter convention, in which he served as chairman of the committee on rules, procedure and general plans. He was appointed a member of the Illinois State Railroad and Warehouse Commission in 1907 and thus served until 1913. He was largely responsible for the abolition of grade crossings in the state of Illinois between steam railroad and electric roads. He was delegate at large from Illinois to the National Republican convention in 1912 and was western treas- urer of the National Republican committee in 1924. He was also member of the executive committee of the capital issues committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of the seventh district. It is worthy of special note that Mr. Eckhart was prominently identified with the organization of Chicago's celebrated military body that made a gallant record in the Spanish-American war — The First Infantry Regiment of the Illinois National Guard, in which he served as an officer for several years. In 1906 he augmented his military distinction by becoming an aide-de-camp on the staff of Governor Deneen, during whose administration he served in this capacity with rank of colonel. In the service of his country during the great World war Mr. Eckhart acted as chairman of the Illinois-Wisconsin Milling Division of the United States Food Administration and as director and member of the executive committee of the Citizens War Board of Chicago. Since 1878 Mr. Eckhart has been a member of the Chicago Board of Trade, of which he was a director from 1888 until 1891. He became the first president of the Millers National Federation, serving in that capacity from 1902 until 1904. In 1903 he was president of the Illinois Manufacturers Association; in 1908 he was vice president of the National Council of Commerce; and in 1910 he was ap- pointed by President Taft a delegate to the International Congress on Commercial Education in the city of Vienna, Austria. He was a member of the executive commit- tee created to prepare the bill for presentation in the Illinois legislature to effect the establishment of the municipal court of Chicago. He is vice chairman of the ex- ecutive committee of the Chicago Community Trust, a governing member of the Art Institute of Chicago and vice president and trustee of the Lewis Institute, one of the notable and practical educational institutions of Chicago. On the 25th of December, 1874, Mr. Eckhart was united in marriage to Miss Katie L. Johnston of Cincinnati, Ohio. Their children are four in number, as follows: Carlos K.; Percy B.; Hazel, who is the wife of Truman W. Brophy, Jr.; and Dorothy, the wife of E. Reginald William's. Mr. and Mrs. B. A. Eckhart reside at No. 1530 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, and also have an attractive home in Lake Forest, Illinois. Mr. Eckhart's appreciation for the social amenities of life is in- dicated in his membership in the Chicago, Union League, Onwentsia, Commercial (vice president in 1912), Art, Old Elm, Shore Acres and Bankers Clubs of Chicago; the Midwick Country Club of Pasadena, California; and the Congressional Country Club of Washington, D. C. His labors have long been a potent and beneficial force in connection with the civic, commercial and financial affairs of Chicago, and he stands forth as one of the emphatically representative men of the great metropolis of the west. In his life are the elements of greatness because of the use he has made of his talents and his opportunities, because his thoughts are not self-centered 26 FINANCING AN EMPIRE but are given to the mastery of life's problems and the fulfillment of his duty as a man in his relations to his fellowmen, and as a citizen in his relations to his city, state and country. HERMAN WALDECK. Herman Waldeck, who has been actively connected with financial interests in Chicago for nearly a third of a century, has attained a position of prominence in this field as one of the vice presidents of the Continental & Commercial National Bank. He was born on the 19th of November, 1871. in Baden, Germany, in which country he pursued his education and spent the period of his minority. It was in the year of 1892 that he crossed the Atlantic to the United States and made his way to Chicago, which city has since been the scene of his banking activities. He was first employed as clerk in the International Bank of Chicago from 1893 until 1897, and in the latter year became connected with the Continental National Bank in a minor clerical capacity, becoming assistant cashier in 1903, which posi- tion he held until elected to the vice presidency in July, 1909. Since the consolida- tion of the Continental National Bank with the Commercial National, in August, 1910, he has occupied the position of vice president of the Continental & Com- mercial National Bank, taking an active part of its management, in shaping its policy and in extending the scope of its activity and business relations. Advance- ment has come to him as the logical sequence of his close application and the ability he has displayed in meeting the heavy responsibilities which have devolved upon him in his various connections with the banking interests of this city. He is also one of the directors of the People's Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago. On the 22d of April, 1903, Mr. Waldeck was married to Miss Gertrude Schwab, a daughter of Aaron Schwab of Chicago. Mr. and Mrs. Waldeck reside at the Drake Hotel. Politically Mr. Waldeck may be said to be an independent republican. During the period of the World war he entered most earnestly into efforts to support the government and became a member of the legal advisory board of the forty- seventh exemption district at No. 400 East Chicago avenue. Appreciative of the social amenities of life, he has joined the Union League, Mid-Day, Attic, South Shore Country and Lake Shore Country Clubs. Coming to the new world as soon as he entered into man's estate, he has worked his way steadily upward through merit and ability to a position among the representative and successful financiers of the metropolis of the west. WILLIAM T. BRUCKNER. William T. Bruckner, vice president of the Continental & Commercial National Bank of Chicago, has been continuously identified for a third of a century with this institution and its predecessor, the Commercial National Bank. His birth occurred in Monroe, Michigan, on the 4th of August, 1869, his parents being George W. and Ann Eliza (Spalding) Bruckner, the former a native of Brooklyn, New York, and the latter of Monroe, Michigan. In the acquirement of an education William T. Bruckner attended the gram- mar and high schools at the place of his nativity. He had attained his majority when in 1890 he secured a position in the wholesale hardware establishment of the Wells & Nellegar Company, in which he was employed until about 1892, when he entered the Commercial National Bank of Chicago. In this institution he filled various clerical positions, served as assistant to the vice presidents and also served in the capacity of assistant cashier. When on the 1st of August, 1910, the Commercial National Bank was consolidated with the Continental National Bank, Mr. Bruckner was made a vice president of the merged institution — known as the Continental & Commercial National Bank. He has thus been officially connected therewith to the present time and he is also a director of the Lake View Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago, the Cicero State Bank of Cicero, Illinois, and the National Life Insurance Company of the United States of America in Chicago. His record is one of steady progress in the field of banking in the mid-west ■ , 1 . \\ .

On the 25th of May, 1911, at Santa Barbara, California, Mr. Bruckner was united in marriage to Miss Edith Alexander. They have become the parents of two children, Herbert A. and Charlotte Spalding, who are twelve and nine years of age, respectively. The family residence is at Hinsdale, Illinois. Mr. Bruckner gives his political allegiance to the republican party, while his religious faith is indicated by his attendance at Grace church of Hinsdale, Illinois, in which he has served as vestryman. He also belongs to the Chicago Athletic Association, the Hinsdale Golf Club, the Hinsdale Club and the Chicago Bank- ers Club and he enjoys the friendship and high regard of all who know him. FRANK EDSON WHITE. Frank Edson White, a director of the Continental and Commercial National Bank, the Continental and Commercial Trust & Savings Bank and The Stock Yards National Bank of Chicago, is a prominent figure in the packing industry as the president of Armour & Company, with which corporation he has been continuously identified since he first became connected therewith as department manager thirty years ago. His birth occurred in Peoria, Illinois, on the 9th of September, 1873, his parents being Frank C. and Lillian Gertrude (Hunt) White, natives of Penn- sylvania, who left the Keystone state to become residents of Peoria, where the father engaged in the live stock business. Frank Edson White obtained his education in the public schools of his native city and was a youth of seventeen when in 1890 he entered the service of E. Godel & Sons, a packing concern of Peoria with which he remained for two years. Sub- sequently he spent a year in the employ of Swift & Company of Chicago, while from 1893 until 1895 he filled the position of department manager for the Western Meat Company of San Francisco, California. It was in the year 1895 that he was ap- pointed department manager for Armour & Company of Chicago, in the service of which corporation he has worked his way upward through successive stages to the presidency. He was elected a director thereof in January, 1912, was made vice president in November, 1914, and in 19 23 was chosen the chief executive officer. He is also the vice president of the Armour Leather Company and, as above stated, his name is on the directorate of the Continental and Commercial National Bank, the Continental and Commercial Trust & Savings Bank and The Stock Yards Na- tional Bank of Chicago, as well as of the Chase National Bank of New York. On the 19th of October, 1899, Mr. White was married to Miss Lillian Pearson, of Collingwood, Ontario, Canada. Their children were three in number, namely. Gertrude Lillian, who is now the wife of William M. Spencer of Erie, Pennsyl- vania; Georgina Hester; and Frank Edson, Jr., who died in September, 1923. The White residence is at No. 70 Scott street in\" Chicago and the family also main- tains Whitehouse Farms at Lake Forest, Illinois. Politically Mr. White is a stanch republican, while his religious faith is that of the Episcopalian church. Fraternally he is identified with the Masonic order and he also belongs to the Chicago, Chicago Athletic, Old Elm, Knollwood and Exmoor Country Clubs, having served as president of the last named during the years 1916 and 1917. Mr. White is a governor of the International Live Stock Ex- position, a director of the National Live Stock and Meat Board and the Institute of American Meat Packers and has long occupied a position of leadership in the packing industry. CHARLES GATES DAWES. Charles Gates Dawes, who was elected vice president of the United States in November, 1924, has been the president and chairman of the board of the Cen- tral Trust Company of Illinois in Chicago since 1902. He was born in Marietta, Ohio, on the 27th of August, 1865, a son of General Rufus R. and Mary Beman (Gates) Dawes. His father served in the Civil war as colonel of the Sixth Wis- 30 FINANCING AN EMPIRE consin Regiment, a brilliant unit of the famed Iron Brigade, and was brevetted brigadier general for distinguished services and gallant conduct. General Rufus R. Dawes figured prominently in the public affairs of the state, represented his district in congress for one term and died about twenty-three years ago at his home in Marietta, Ohio. The family comes of old Massachusetts stock of English origin and among the ancestors was William Dawes, who with Paul Revere made the famous ride to alarm the settlers of the approach of the British that meant the opening of the Revolutionary war. Charles G. Dawes acquired his education in the common schools of his native town and in Marietta College, from which he was graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1884, while in 188 7 the same institution conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts. It was in 1886 that he received the degree of LL. B. from the Cincinnati Law School, being admitted to the bar the same year. He had already done considerable work as a railroad civil engineer and after graduat- ing in law became chief engineer of a small line which is now part of the Toledo & Ohio Cenlral Railroad. In 1887 he removed to Lincoln, Nebraska, and for seven years was there engaged in the practice of law. Having made a special study of railroad freight rates, he was retained by many Nebraska shippers in their suits against the railroads, whose hearings were influential in bringing about the passage of the Interstate Commerce Law. In the pressing of these suits he came into marked prominence as a lawyer and at the same time obtained high standing as a republican leader and campaigner. In 1894 he removed to Evanston, Illinois, having acquired an interest in the local gas company, his activities in this direction afterward extending to La Crosse, Wisconsin, Seattle, Washington, and other points. Mr. Dawes had been an admirer of William McKinley and in 1895 inaugurated the work in Illinois which led the republican state convention in 1896 to instruct its delegates to support him for president in the national nominating convention. He was appointed on the executive committee of the republican national com- mittee and was regarded as McKinley's special representative. When Mr. Dawes was appointed comptroller of the currency in 1897 his relations with the president became even more confidential and his businesslike conduct of the affairs of his office, especially his regard for the welfare of depositors in the national banks, met with the cordial approval both of the administration and the general public, irrespective of party. On October 1, 1901, he resigned the office to enter upon his campaign for the United States senatorship, but in May of the following year withdrew from the contest and a few days later was elected head of the Central Trust Company of Illinois, which he had then recently organized and which he has since served as president and chairman of the board. He is the president of the Rufus F. Dawes Hotel Association, succeeded the late James H. Eckels as presi- dent of the Home for Destitute Crippled Children and also became vice president of the Chicago Grand Opera Company. With America's entrance into the World war, General Dawes offered his serv- ices to the government and became a member of the Seventeenth Engineers (Rail- way), with which organization he was connected from June 11, 1917, until August 30, 1917. On the former date he was commissioned major and on the 15th of July was advanced to the rank of lieutenant colonel. It was on the 7th of July, 1917, on the steamer Carmania, that he sailed for Europe, landing at Liverpool, proceeding thence to London and on to Bordeaux, where he entered upon his important administrative duties in connection with the administrative staff of the commander in chief. On the 30th of August, 1917, he was made general purchas- ing agent and chairman of the general purchasing board of the American Expedi- tionary Forces, on the administrative staff of the commander in chief, and thus continued to serve until July 1, 1919. He was also a member representing the American Expeditionary Forces on the military board of allied supply from June 20, 1918, to July 30, 1919, and served as a member of the advisory liquidation board of the American Expeditionary Forces from November 27, 1918, to January 30, 1919. On the 11th of February, 1919, he was made a member of the United States liquidation board of the war department and thus continued until July 26, 1919. In the meantime he had been advanced in rank and was commissioned colonel on January 16, 1918, and brigadier general on the 15th of October. He was present in the Meuse Argonne offensive from the 5th to the 12th of October, 1918, and on the 6th of August, 1919, he returned to the United States, being HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 31 mustered out at Washington, D. C, on the 31st of August. Marshal Foch of France, in bestowing upon Brigadier-General Charles G. Dawes the war cross, cited him as follows in official orders of the day: \"During the course of operations in 1918 General Dawes obtained a complete union of supplies between the American and French armies. By his breadth of spirit and his constant effort to put upon a com- mon basis the resources of the two armies, he permitted to be realized under the best possible conditions a community of effort which resulted in the victory over the Germans.\" General Dawes was accorded the Distinguished Service Medal of his own country, that of commander of the Legion d'Honneur (France) in 1919, of Companion of Bath of Great Britain, of commander of the Order of Leopold (Belgium) in 1919 and the Croix de Guerre (one palm) of France. General Dawes was appointed director of the Federal Budget System in 1921 and two years later was appointed by the Reparations Commission as president of the committee to investigate the possibilities of the German budget. His work in this connection, culminating in the adoption of the Dawes Plan, has won him world-wide fame. Previous to this time he had gained an enviable reputation as a writer on financial problems, being the author of \"The Banking System of the United States,\" published in 1892; \"Essays and Speeches,\" 1915; \"A Journal of the Great War,\" 1921; and \"The First Year of the Budget of the United States,\" 1923. At the republican national convention which was held in Cleveland in June, 1924, Charles G. Dawes was nominated for the vice presidency of the United States, to which position he was elected in the following November, being thus signally honored by the citizens of a country he has served so long and so well. On the 24th of January, 1889, General Dawes was united in marriage to Miss Caro Dana Blymyer, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and they became the parents of two chil- dren, Rufus Fearing and Carolyn. The General is a member of the Chicago, Union League, University, Onwentsia, • Glen View, Evanston, Evanston Country and Evanston Golf Clubs. WILLIAM RUGGLES DAWES. William Ruggles Dawes, numbered among the leading financiers of Chicago for more than two decades, is the vice president of the Central Trust Company of Illinois and the president of the Chicago Association of Commerce. He was born in Ripon, Wisconsin, on the 5th of October, 1862, and comes of honored colonial ancestry. William Dawes, commonly known as \"the patriot,\" rode as the com- panion of Paul Revere in the latter's famous ride and call to arms of the patriots. In Ripon, Wisconsin, on February 28, 1854, a mass meeting of whigs, demo- crats, and free soilers resolved to throw old party organizations to the winds, and three weeks later local organization was effected and the name republican was adopted for the party which was to elect Lincoln to the presidency six years later — 1860. William R. Dawes received his more advanced intellectual training at Ripon College, from which institution he was graduated in 1884. The same year he removed to Redfield, South Dakota, where he was identified with the Spink County Bank until 1889. He also discharged the duties of treasurer of Redfield College from 1887 until 1889 but in the latter year took up his abode in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he was associated with his cousin, General Charles G. Dawes, at that time a resident of Lincoln, as secretary of the Dawes Business Block Company from 1890 until 1898. It was in 1900 that William R. Dawes became cashier of the Chicago post office, under Postmaster Charles U. Gordon. When the Central Trust Company of Illi- nois was organized in July, 1902, he was made cashier of that bank and nine years later was elected to the dual position of vice president and cashier. In 1919 he was elected vice president of the institution, which he has thus represented to the present time. Mr. Dawes was also president and director of the North Side State Savings Bank of Chicago from 1909 until 1920, covering a period of eleven years, while during the decade between 1912 and 1922 he acted as vice president and director of the Mechanics & Traders State Bank of Chicago, and was later director of the Market Traders State Bank, formed by the consolidation of the Mechanics & Traders State Bank and The Market Trust & Savings Bank. At present he is offi- 32 FINANCING AN EMPIRE cially connected with the Liquid Carbonic Company of Chicago as a director and with the O'Gara Coal Company of Chicago as director and treasurer. He has also served as a trustee of Ripon College. In 1918, when the railroad situation loomed high in the problems of the country, Mr. Dawes proposed a restricted control of the railroads based on the plan put into operation by the Federal Reserve System. He proposed that a general board of federal directors be selected to administer in Washington, and that each railroad line be represented in the region in which it operates by men representing the railroad brotherhoods, the private interests op- erating the lines, the investors and the public. Mr. Dawes has always manifested a deep interest in the work of the Chicago Association of Commerce, having served as a member of its finance committee in 1916 and 1917 and in 1922 and 1923 on its executive committee, of which he was vice chairman in the latter year. On the 12th of December, 1923, he was elected president of the Chicago Association of Commerce for the year 1924. He was reelected for 1925 and was again reelected for the year 1926. In 18 85, at Whitewater, Wisconsin, Mr. Dawes was united in marriage to Miss Margaret Booker. He is a member of the First Congregational church of Evanston, and he is prominent in social circles, at one time serving as president of the Country Club and as president of the Wisconsin Society of Chicago in 1925. In this capacity he supervised the rebuilding of the new home of that club, the old one having been destroyed by fire two years ago. He also belongs to the University Club, the Bankers Club, the Mid-Day Club and the Wisconsin Society, all of Chicago, and the Evanston Club, the Glenview Golf Club and the University Club of Evanston, Illinois. A game on the links is his favorite form of recreation. JOSEPH EDWARD OTIS. Joseph Edward Otis is an outstanding figure in financial circles of the state as president of the Central Trust Company of Illinois in Chicago. His record has at all times been in harmony with the personal integrity and lofty business prin- ciples of his ancestors, who were not only prominent in the early upbuilding of Chicago but in its later rebuilding following the great conflagration of 1871. His interests have permanently centered in the city of his nativity, for it was here that Mr. Otis was born on the 5th of March, 1867, his parents being Joseph Edward and Maria (Taylor) Otis. The family was established in Chicago during the era of pioneer development and its members have since been conspicuous in connection with the promotion and development of the city's best interests. After acquiring his preliminary education in the Harvard School for Boys in Chicago, Joseph Edward Otis went east to enter the Phillips Academy of Andover, Massachusetts, and later continued his studies in the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University. His education completed as far as the technical training of the schools is concerned, he entered the real estate and renting business in associa- tion with Edwin Read in 1889 and a year later started upon an independent ven- ture, establishing a real estate and renting agency as a partner of the firm of Joseph R. Putnam & Company. Upon the failure of his father's health in 1892 the son took charge of his affairs and in 1894 joined Charles H. Wilcox and Fred- erick S. Wheeler in organizing the Great Western Tin Plate Company at Joliet, Illinois. Of this concern Mr. Otis remained the president until 1897, when it was sold to the American Tin Plate Company. Watchful of opportunities pointing to success, Mr. Otis in 1897 believed that he might enter a broader and more profit- able field by turning his attention to the stock brokerage business, and in part- nership with Charles H. Wilcox and H. W. Buckingham formed the firm of Otis, Wilcox & Company. The connection was thus maintained for three years, when, in 1900, Walter H. Wilson bought out the interest controlled by Mr. Wilcox and the firm name was changed to Otis, Wilson & Company, at which time the character of the business was also changed from stock brokerage to private bank- ing. Ralph C. Otis, a brother of Joseph E. Otis, also joined the firm as a partner and on the 1st of July, 1902, the company consolidated its interests with those of the Western State Bank, under the title of the Western Trust & Savings Bank, of which Mr. Otis remained president until December 23, 1911, when it was consolidated with the Central Trust Company of Illinois. On this date Joseph E. £&L^ HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 35 Otis became vice president of the Central Trust Company. When Charles G. Dawes was made chairman of the board Mr. Otis succeeded him as president of the institution. In 1917 Mr. Otis organized the Chicago Morris Plan Bank, then a pioneer move- ment to meet the needs of the many people who could not properly expect credit accommodations from a commercial bank and a considerable number of whom had been previously forced into the hands of money lenders. For a time Mr. Otis gave much of his time to the direction of this institution, serving as its presi- dent until 1921, when he was made chairman of the board, which is his present connection with the bank. One of his associates in this movement has said: \"Mr. Otis has not only given freely of his time to this work, just at a time when he could least afford it, and without compensation, but his knowledge of banking and his genius for organization are responsible for the success that this in- stitution has enjoyed.\" Mr. Otis has been very active in commercial enterprises. Besides being presi- dent of the Central Trust Company of Illinois and chairman of the Chicago Morris Plan Bank, he is chairman of the finance committee of the Security Life Insurance Company and a director in the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, the Stewart- Warner Speedometer Company, the Stewart Manufacturing Company, the Hur- ley Machine Company, the Illinois Power & Light Company, the Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee Railway Company and the Drovers National Bank. In 1902, with the assistance of his brother, Ralph C. Otis, he organized the Chicago Sav- ings Bank and was for a short time vice president of that institution. Despite the demands of this wide range of business interests Mr. Otis has devoted a great deal of time to civic work. He was for many years treasurer of the Chicago Police Pension Fund, which he reorganized, establishing the present system and securing proper legislation at Springfield. He has also been very active in the work of the Chicago Civic Federation, which he served as treasurer of the election committee from 1905 to 1915, president from 1915 to 1921 and since that time as a member of the executive and finance committees. It was during his administration and under his guidance that the Civic Federation began to devote itself exclusively to matters of taxation and public finance. It was also under his direction that they first began organization among taxpayers in outlying territory and the supplying of tax information in bulletin form. Mr Otis votes with the republican party and holds membership in the Episcopal church, while his appreciation for the social amenities of life is indicated in his connec- tion with the Chicago, University, Commercial, Saddle and Cycle and Mid-Day Clubs. On the 3d of October, 1891, Mr. Otis was united in marriage to Miss Emily Porter Webster of Chicago. They had five children, as follows: Joseph Edward. George Webster, Stuart Huntington, Raymond and Emily Huntington. George Webster Otis left Yale University to enlist as a private in the United States army, when war with Germany was declared; and died in the training camp. The family residence is at No. 1415 Astor street, Chicago. WILLIAM GRANT EDENS. Few bankers in Illinois are more widely known than William Grant Edens; not only has he been active in business circles but he has also labored for the adoption of many benefits to the state. Since 1905 he has been identified with the Central Trust Company of Illinois, Chicago, in charge of the department of new business, and he has been a vice president of this bank since November, 1919. Mr. Edens was born in Richmond, Wayne county, Indiana, November 27, 1863, his parents being Hervey D. Washington and Elsie Jane (Fought) Edens. His father, a native of Virginia, left the Old Dominion for Ohio because of his oppo- sition to slavery. William G. Edens acquired his education in the public and district schools of Lebanon and Boone county, Indiana. From the age of ten he has been de- pendent upon his own resources, for at that age he became a messenger boy for the Western Union Telegraph Company. He afterward acted as mail carrier and as assistant to the station agent of the Indianapolis, Cincinnati & Lafayette 36 FINANCING AN EMPIRE Railroad (now the Big Four) at Lebanon, Indiana, for three years. Subsequently he was in the service of the Ohio Central Railroad, Toledo & Ann Arbor Rail- road, and the Vandalia Lines, devoting many years to railroad work and filling consecutively the positions of freight and passenger brakeman, train baggageman, express messenger and freight and passenger conductor. This covered the period between 1880 and 1887. Joining the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen (now Trainmen) he was in 1887 elected vice grand master of the international organization and continued in that capacity until January, 1890, traveling extensively in the United States, Canada and Mexico, organizing and visiting established lodges. He was then ap- pointed chief clerk and cashier at the national headquarters of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen at Galesburg, Illinois, acting in that capacity for a period of six years. Mr. Edens has been sergeant at arms at every republican national convention since 1S96. In the early '90s he did effective work as a member of the committee which was instrumental in making Chicago the site of the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1896 he was chosen state organizer of the Illinois Republican League, and under the direction of General Charles G. Dawes made a canvass of the state in behalf of William McKinley for president. In the fall of the same year he served on the staff of the republican national committee at the Chicago headquarters under Chairman Marcus A. Hanna, with supervision of the organ- ization of railroad voters. In October, 1897, he was appointed by President McKinley as assistant general superintendent of the free delivery system in the post office department at Washington, D. C, serving until July 1, 1904, when he resigned to again become state organizer of the Illinois Republican League during the national campaign. He assisted in organizing the postal service in the mili- tary camps of the United States and Cuba during the Spanish-American war. Early in Mr. Edens' railroad and brotherhood career, he was chosen to represent organized railroad labor before congress at Washington favoring safety appliance legislation, and as chairman of the legislative committee of the forty-fourth gen- eral assembly of Illinois, assisted in bringing about the formation of a labor con- ference for the entire state and the passage of remedial legislation. Mr. Edens has been active in both state and national bankers' associations. In 1907 he assisted in organizing the group system of the Illinois Bankers Associa- tion and acted as secretary and chairman of group No. 4, and as a member of the executive council. He made an excellent record as secretary of the committee on agriculture and vocational education of the Illinois Bankers Association in 1910, and later as chairman of both the good roads and transportation committees of that association. In 1919 he was appointed a member of the agricultural com- mission, and since 1922 has served on the public relations committee of the American Bankers Association, and for two terms as a member of the executive council of the same association. During his banking career of twenty years he has appeared on the program at many local, state and national conventions as an advocate of improved agriculture, better highways and cooperative effort for more efficient country schools. In 1912 Mr. Edens was elected president of the Illinois Highway Improvement Association, and conducted the campaign culminating in the adoption by the people of Illinois of a sixty million dollar good roads bond issue in Illinois in 1918. For this service he was presented with a gold medal by his associates \"in recognition of his energetic leadership.\" In 1917 Governor Frank O. Lowden appointed him a member of the board of highway advisers of Illinois. He is now an Illinois director of the Dixie Highway Association, Lincoln Consul for Chicago, and a member of the committee on highways for the Chicago Regional Planning Association. Mr. Edens has been active in the Chicago Association of Commerce for fifteen years, and was chairman of the good roads committee of that organization for eight years. Twice during campaign years he acted as chairman of the political action committee of the Hamilton Club. Throughout the period of the World war he was honorary recruiting officer of the Seventeenth Engineers, A. E. F., a pioneer railroad construction regiment, and of the One Hundred Eighth Regiment, Illinois Engineers. He was grand chancellor of the Knights of Pythias of Illinois in 1903 and 1904, and since 1905 has been a member of the Supreme Lodge, in which he has been a member and acted as chairman of finance committee. He is also a life member of the Loyal Order of Moose. Mr. Edens is a member of the HISTORY OF BANKING IN ILLINOIS 37 Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Banking, the Illinois Historical Society, and the Indiana and Ohio Societies of Chicago, being a trustee of the first named. He is an honorary member of the National Association of Letter Carriers, and vice president of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress for Illi- nois. He is a member of the Bankers, Mid-Day, Bob O'Link Golf Club, Hamilton and Press Clubs, while his religion is indicated by his membership in the Metho- dist Episcopal church. At Milwaukee, December 9, 189 6. Mr. Edens was united in marriage to Miss Lillian Maud Brunei- of Galesburg, Illinois. Their son, William McKinley Edens, is a graduate of the College of Commerce of the University of Illinois and is now an assistant national bank examiner for Federal Reserve District No. 12. A contemporary biographer said of Mr. Edens: \"He is perhaps best known as champion of the interests of the people. In this connection, his work in behalf of improvement of public highways and for progressive and remedial legislation, both state and national, is well known.\" WALTER H. WILSON. \"Just an errand boy. If I can continue to run errands and do it well, and avoid the bunkers, I may keep my job!\" ALBERT J. EARLING. Albert J. Earling, one of the incorporators of the Central Trust Company of Illinois in 1902, had reached the age of seventy-seven years when he departed this life on the 10th of November, 1925. For some time he had enjoyed the dis- tinction of being the only remaining member of the original board of directors of the Central Trust Company with the exception of General Dawes. He was, more- over, a noted railway pioneer. On the 10th of January, 1919, he retired as chair- man of the board of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company, with which he had been continuously identified for more than a half century and in the service of which he had worked his way upward from the humble position of telegraph operator to that of chief executive. Albert J. Earling was born at Richfield, Wisconsin, on the 19th of January, 1848, his parents being Charles and Elizabeth (Sander) Earling. His public school education was supplemented by a course of study in Milton College of Wisconsin, and he was a youth of eighteen years when in 1866 he left the Badger state to come to Chicago. Seeking employment, he secured the position of telegraph operator with the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company, serving at various places until transferred to Milwaukee -in 1869. He spent five years as telegraph operator and was then promoted to train dispatcher. After five years' service in that position he served for four years, from 1878 until 1882, as assistant division superintendent and for two years thereafter was division superintendent. He was next made assistant general superintendent in 18 84 and after four years' preparatory service in that position became general superintendent, thus serving from 1888 until 1890. In the latter year he assumed the important duties of general manager, while in 1895 he was chosen second vice president and in Sep- tember, 1899, succeeded Roswell Miller to the presidency. Mr. Earling retired as active head of the railway company in 1917 but continued his connection there- with as chairman of its board of directors until January 10, 1919. The following is an excerpt from a review of his career which appeared in the Chicago Daily Tribune under date of November 11, 1925: \"Mr. Earling's chief monument prob- ably was the Pacific coast extension of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul road. With the late James J. Hill, Mr. Earling believed no middle western railroad could become great without an outlet to the Pacific. Many of his associates did not agree with him, but his will triumphed and he went ahead with the project, the fulfillment of which has been held responsible for much of the road's financial troubles in more recent years. It is contended, however, that the extension will prove in the long run a benefit to the road, when the far western country grows 38 FINANCING AN EMPIRE more in population. He also made the extension the first railroad to be elec- trically operated over the Rocky mountains, nearly five hundred miles of the line being run in that way. Even after he became its president, Mr. Earling continued to keep in touch with details of the road. It is said he would spend nights in the yards, riding switch engines and talking to the men. When the extension was being built Mr. Earling spent weeks on the construction, working night and day and watching every detail of the work. The human side of President Earling's career attracted public notice frequently. He reached the Cherry (111.) mine dis- aster a few hours after it occurred and directed in person the work of relief.\" A contemporary biographer said of him, while he was still an active represen- tative of transportation interests: \"The steps in his orderly progression are thus easily discernible and his advancement has followed as the logical recognition of his constantly expanding powers. He does not claim genius or any phenomenal characteristics, but all familiar with his history recognize that he is capable of mature judgment of his own capacities and of the people and circumstances that make up his life contacts and experiences. He is eminently a man of business sense and easily avoids the mistakes and disasters that come to those who, though possessing remarkable faculties in some respects, are liable to erratic movements that result in unwarranted risk and failure. Possessing sufficient courage to venture where favoring opportunity has presented, he has by the faithful per- formance of each day's duties qualified for the larger responsibilities that have come to him in his various promotions, and his judgment and even-paced energy have carried him forward until he now occupies a foremost position in the ranks of railway officials in the middle west * * * Long identification with railway interests has made him familiar with the various departments of this system and developed his efficiency to cope with propositions of great magnitude and render correct judgment in matters of the deepest import. Contemporaries and associates alike honor him for what he has accomplished, recognizing in him a dependable man in any relation and any emergency.\" In 1871 Mr. Earling was married to Margaret Peebles, of Watertown, Wiscon- sin. They became the parents of three children: George Peebles, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Sherburne M., a resident of Chicago; and Harriett, who is the wife of Lawrence Fitch and who makes her home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mr. Earling maintained his residence at Daytona Beach, Florida, for several years but spent the summer months in Wisconsin. His name was on the membership rolls of the Chicago Club, the Commercial Club of Chicago and the Milwaukee Club. R. FLOYD CLINCH. Among the older directors of the Central Trust Company of Illinois is R. Floyd Clinch, president of the Crerar-Clinch Coal Company of Chicago. He was born in Georgia on the 19th of July, 1865, a son of Colonel Duncan L. and Susan A. (Hopkins) Clinch. His father rendered distinguished service in the Confed- erate army, as did also his grandfather, General Duncan L. Clinch, in the War of 1812. R. Floyd Clinch gained his early education in private schools of his native state and later attended the military academy at Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. In 188 3 he came to Chicago and began his business career in the employ of the Joliet Steel Company. In 1889 he joined John Crerar in establishing the firm of Crerar, Clinch & Company, which was l"
