Always present on the horizon were the colossal cooling towers of the Bona Reactor, with their green obstruction lights. If you put your ear to the ground, you could hear the heartbeat of the Loop – the purring of the Gravitron, the central piece of engineering magic that was the focus of the Loop’s experiments.\n\nIt was the middle of summer, and my little sister, Klara, had tried to follow me and my friend around for weeks. Her best friend was out of town and my mother tried, without much success, to arouse my sympathy. I had always taken care of Klara, not only because of her hearing impairment, but because there has always been something fragile about her, as if she can be easily damaged or broken. However, this summer had awakened the desire in me to ride as far away as possible on my bike, and to do things on my own. When Klara suddenly disappeared, guilt hit me like a blow to the stomach, and I remembered she had talked about meeting a new friend called Bettan.\n\nWe found them on the other side of the strait; I still don’t know how they managed to cross. We crept toward them through the tall grass as the wind tore at the pines. A woodpecker could be heard in the distance. Klara sat on a stone and leaned forward to place a daisy chain on the head of a runaway robot, her new friend “Bettan.” I signaled to my friends to keep quiet and snuck around to the other side. When I looked back, Bettan was staring at me, its eyes narrowing to tiny black dots as it took my sister in its arms.\n\n7\n\nCHAPTER O1\n\nEXAMPLE The Gamemaster: Bettan has clearly seen you. What do you do? Player 1 (Klara’s brother Olle): I crouch down in the tall grass and try to calm myself, but feel my heart beating even faster. Player 2 (Olle’s friend Anita): I guess it hasn´t seen me? I try to sneak around it. The Gamemaster: Roll Sneak. Player 2: Five dice. (Rolls dice to get at least one six.) Yes, one success! The Gamemaster: Tell us what you do. Player 2: I sneak from tree to tree until I’m on the other side, and kneel behind an overgrown jasmine bush. I am prepared to rush the cyborg if it tries to leave with Klara. Player 1: Do I know anything about how cyborgs work, how to stop them? The Gamemaster: Roll Calculate. Player 1: Two dice. (Rolls dice.) Success! The Gamemaster: You have read a lot about robots because your father previously worked at a job producing spare parts for robots. You know there is sometimes a big red button on the chest for an emergency stop; if pressed hard, the robot collapses lifeless. Player 1: Are there any rocks close by? The Gamemaster: Absolutely. Player 1: I grab a large piece of granite and slowly stand up. I try to spot the button and see if I can throw the stone at it. The Gamemaster: The cyborg stands turned towards you with Klara in its arms, her face against its chest. It strokes her hair. The button on its body is concealed by Klara. What do you do? Player1: I slowly place the stone on the ground and talk to it with a soft voice: “I’m her brother. I will not hurt you.” This story is an example of what can happen when you play the Tales from the Loop roleplaying game, which takes place in the fantastic world created by Simon Stålenhag. A roleplaying game is a conversation where you and your friends build a story with a beginning, a mid-\n\n8\n\nCUSTOM DICE e availThere is a set of custom dic , sold p able for Tales from the Loo and gue separately at the Free Lea are e dic Modiphius websites. These port sup y not needed to play, but the e nic a the game mechanics and are addition.\n\ndle, and an end. A typical story takes between three to six hours of play. Most often you sit at a table and you need paper, pens, and at least ten six-sided dice.\n\nTHE TALES FROM THE LOOP In this game, a story is called a Mystery. It deals with a group of friends who try to solve Mysteries together. The friends are Kids, aged 10-15 years old, living in the late 1980s. Everyday Life is full of nagging parents, never-ending homework, and classmates bullying and being bullied. The Mysteries allow the Kids to encounter strange machines and creatures that exist as a result of the nearby Loop, a huge underground particle accelerator built in the late 1960s. The Kids get to escape their everyday lives and problems and be part of something meaningful and magical, yet also dangerous. They risk getting injured and also changed by the Troubles they have to overcome to solve the Mysteries.\n\nAll players, except one, create a character; a Kid whom they will play in the story. In-game, you choose what your Kid does and says, and you tell the others what she looks like and what she thinks and feels. You should pretend to be the Kid, like an actor in a movie or a play. It is usually easier to play the Kid if you refer to the character as “me” or “I,” instead of “she” or “her.” One of the players will be the Gamemaster. She plays all people except the Kids, and controls all creatures and machines. These are called Non-Player Characters, or NPCs. The Gamemaster also describes what everything looks like in the game, the smells and the sounds. She is responsible for making the story move forward and cuts from scene to scene, just like a director in a movie. The Gamemaster shouldn’t decide what will happen in the story. She presents situations and puts the Kids in Trouble. The players decide how the Kids try to overcome that Trouble, and that creates the story. To support the story, the Gamemaster has a Mystery, a script that describes locations and NPCs that the Kids can encounter, and what Trouble they may need to overcome. The Mystery is only a guide, as the Gamemaster can choose to improvise and make up her own events, but she can always fall back on the Mystery when she is unsure of what to say or do. The Gamemaster’s task is clearly a bit more difficult than that of the others, but is also even more rewarding. The Gamemaster can invent intriguing mysteries, play robots and mad scientists, and she may, with the help of the players, describe the fantastical world of the Loop. The Gamemaster should cheer on the Kids just like you do with the heroes of a movie, but at the same time, put them in Trouble so that she can enjoy how they overcome it and solve the Mystery. The players and the Gamemaster take turns telling what the characters do, what the scenery looks like, and what happens. It is important that everyone gets space and time to participate. The group should listen to, and take in, each other’s ideas. The story should be created together, and it’s important to help one another, not compete for attention.\n\nTWO LOOPS, SWEDISH AND US There are two settings included in this book. The primary setting is an alternate version of the Swedish Mälaren Islands, west of the capital Stockholm. This setting is described in Chapter 2. The second, alternative setting is based on the US town of Boulder City, Nevada, which has a Loop of its own and is a sister facility to the Swedish Loop. The US setting is described in Chapter 3. The Mystery Stories (scenarios) later in this book are primarily based on the Swedish setting, but they contain hints on how to adapt them to Boulder City. All comments in orange brackets [like this] in the scenario texts refer to the American setting.\n\nWELCOME TO THE LOOP\n\nROLEPLAYING - HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nSometimes situations arise where the Kids try to do something difficult. In those situations, you roll dice and let chance determine if you succeed or fail.\n\nA LOOP IN YOUR OWN HOME TOWN? It’s entirely possible to set your game in your own home town, where you live or where you grew up. In your game universe, maybe that’s where the Loop was built? Creating your own game setting requires some more work, but can be a lot of fun!\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER O1\n\nTHE MYSTERY LANDSCAPE An alternative way to play the game is for the Gamemaster to use the Mystery Landscape. The Mystery Landscape consists of weird or problematic Locations spread out over the game setting. The Kids are expected to seek out the Locations and solve whatever problems they encounter. These two methods can be combined by using the pre-written Mysteries as a part of the Mystery Landscape. Read more about the Mystery Landscape in Chapter 7.\n\nROLLING DICE The Kids have numeric ratings for what they are good at: understanding machines, fast talking, climbing trees, and running fast. The rating indicates how many six-sided dice you get to roll when trying to overcome Trouble. A six means a success. You rarely need more than one success. If you fail, you may try again, but then you risk getting hurt, upset or scared. This is explained further in Chapter 5.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF THE LOOP The Tales from the Loop roleplaying game is permeated by six principles that the players and the Gamemaster will use to create stories with the right kind of feeling and plot. They are also tools to finding a way to get along, if players have different opinions about what should happen in the story and how it should be described. The principles are first presented as a numbered list, and then explained in more detail, written as instructions and inspiration to you who are reading this text.\n\n10\n\n1. Your home town is full of strange and fantastic things. 2. Everyday life is dull and unforgiving. 3. Adults are out of reach and out of touch. 4. The land of the Loop is dangerous but Kids will not die. 5. The game is played scene by scene. 6. The world is described collaboratively. 1. YOUR HOME TOWN IS FULL OF STRANGE AND FANTASTIC THINGS When fusion, particle accelerators and the magnetrine effect were discovered in the 1950s, it broke the boundaries between the possible and the impossible. Huge transport vessels fly, cyborgs and robots can think, scientists create time portals and objects that replace people’s identities. Strange beasts roam the landscape, and humanity can contact people and creatures from other times and places. Not infrequently, things are created because of experiments that go wrong or random events that spawn something new and unexpected. Only the imagination limits what can happen in the land of the Loop in the late 1980s. The Kids should discover all these strange things. See the world through the eyes of Kids, as they are about to leave childhood with all of their lives ahead of them. They can do anything, and will do it to solve the Mysteries. Use your own experiences from being a kid – whether you are one now or it was many years ago – to create magic and wonder. Think of how it feels to sneak out in the middle of the night to secretly meet your friends, to dive deep underwater to gather stones or ride your bike as fast as you can on hilly trails through the woods. Think of how it feels to sit sweating in a secret tree hut with friends and how those first days of summer break feel. Think of what it is like to spy on the creepy guy with the dogs, or listen to the older kids’ stories about burglars or the strange old lady. Let yourself be enchanted. 2. EVERYDAY LIFE IS DULL AND UNFORGIVING The alarm clock rings every morning, and homework must be done every night. It does not matter that the magnetrine ships sail by outside the window, that mom\n\nWELCOME TO THE LOOP\n\nand dad still quarrel, and your brother seems to hate you. Your house smells fishy and you don’t get enough pocket money to buy that tape you want. The garbage has to be thrown out every day, bullies give you nicknames, and your bike is broken. It’s raining, and you have no raincoat. Life is full of setbacks and obstacles. The adults decide and do as they please, and Kids are forced to do as they say. Sure, sometimes a problem is solved and you enjoy a nice moment, but it only lasts a short while, then it’s the same as before. Everyday life.\n\n3. ADULTS ARE OUT OF REACH AND OUT OF TOUCH It does not matter what you say; the adults neither listen nor understand. They live in their own world, distinct from the Kids. There’s no point in asking them for help with problems, Mysteries to be solved or Troubles that must be overcome. The Kids are at the mercy of each other. The adults won’t even believe in all the strange things that the Kids encounter. The adults nag and whine and argue with each other. They are busy with themselves and their work.\n\n11\n\nCHAPTER O1 Moreover, they are ignorant. It is usually their mistakes that the Kids need to fix – machines that run amok, experiments gone bad, aircraft that crash or explode. The worst are the adults who actually see the Kids and want to exploit or harm them. Sometimes adults help, like when your dad comforts you, or you call the police and they catch the burglars, but it never lasts and it often comes with a price. The police take all the glory, your stepmom wants you to mow the lawn all summer as payment for her help, or your teacher sees you as an ally and expects you to help her keep an eye on the bad guys in class. 4. THE LAND OF THE LOOP IS DANGEROUS BUT KIDS WILL NOT DIE The Kids can be hurt, locked up, mocked, displaced, robbed, or broken-hearted, but they cannot die in this game.\n\n12\n\n5. THE GAME IS PLAYED SCENE BY SCENE Just like in the movies, the Mystery is played in scenes. First, the characters talk to each other in the house, then we skip to when they meet their teacher at school. Don’t play out every little step they take on the way between home and school. Skip the boring or less important parts. In Tales from the Loop, the Gamemaster is the one who “sets” the scenes, often with the help of the players. Setting a scene means to initiate the scene and end it when it seems done. The Gamemaster should consult the players when unsure. The Gamemaster can set scenes on her own initiative, like this: “When you come home at night, you hear someone crying in the kitchen. Your father is sitting at the table. When he sees you, he puts on a fake smile. What do you do?” The Gamemaster should also ask the players to suggest which scene should be set. A good rule of thumb is to allow players to set at least every other scene.\n\nWELCOME TO THE LOOP\n\nEXAMPLE The Gamemaster: Does anyone have a scene? Player 1 (Olle): I would like to try to break into the school to see what they are hiding there. The Gamemaster: Do you go there alone? Player 1: Yes. The Gamemaster: The sun is going down above the oaks when you lean your bike against the fence behind the gymnasium. It is quiet and empty, and all the windows are dark. 6. THE WORLD IS DESCRIBED COLLABORATIVELY The Gamemaster is responsible for setting scenes and describing things in the story, but that doesn’t mean she should do all the work herself. The Gamemaster should ask the players for help all the time. Ask them what the school looks like, what the weather is, why\n\nthe neighbors are arguing, and so forth. The Gamemaster should ask the Kids questions: What does your mother look like? What’s fishy about the lady of the house next door? What is the mood like in the house when you get home? How do you feel? What are you thinking? What have you done that makes her hate you? What are you wearing? How come you love her? The Gamemaster should use the players’ imaginations by asking questions all the time, and making sure the group creates the world together. If the players make up flying schools and parents who work as Alien Hunters, the Gamemaster should remind them of the principle “Everyday life is dull and unforgiving.” The strange and the mysterious should be in the Mysteries. The Gamemaster has the final say.\n\n13\n\nO2 CHAPTER\n\nTHE ’80S THAT NEVER WAS\n\n15\n\nTHE SWEDISH LOOP\n\n17\n\nTHE MÄLAREN ISLANDS: A SLICE OF SUBURBIA\n\n19\n\nTHINGS TO DO IN THE ’80S 20 SVARTSJÖLANDET: BLACK WATERS AND DEEP FORESTS\n\n21\n\nMUNSÖ: HOME OF THE LOOP\n\n24\n\nADELSÖ: REMNANTS OF THE PAST\n\n26\n\nRIKSENERGI 27 THE LOOP\n\n27\n\nCIVILIAN TECHNOLOGY\n\n29\n\nMILITARY TECHNOLOGY\n\n30\n\nMAGNETRINE FLIGHT – HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n32\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nThe Loop’s presence was felt everywhere on the Mälaren Islands. Our parents worked there. Riksenergi’s service vehicles patrolled the roads and the skies. Strange machines roamed in the woods, the glades, and the meadows. Whatever forces reigned deep below sent vibrations up through the bedrock, the flint lime bricks, and the Eternit facades – and into our living rooms.\n\nOne of the core elements of the game setting is that the Tales from the Loop RPG takes place in a distinct and iconic period of time: the 1980s. It’s a time you probably know well – you might even have grown up during this era, and if not, you have probably experienced it through a score of iconic movies like E.T., The Goonies, and Wargames. It is the decade that gave us global pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna, when hard rock and synth pop dominated the radio, and the Commodore 64 was the world's best-selling computer. In a way, it was the first really modern decade. The VCR made its way into homes, and a generation of kids watched movies that previously were out of sight and reach for them. After the pessimistic ’70s, the ’80s looked ahead and upwards. Everything seemed possible. Yet it was also a decade of fear and conflict. Looming over every-\n\nthing was the spectre of the Cold War, and the global threat of nuclear war. To be scared of The Bomb was as natural as being afraid of climate change today. This, and everything else that happened during this era, is part of this game. But there is more to it as well – this game is about an ’80s that never was.\n\nTHE ’80S THAT NEVER WAS Things are not quite as you remember them. The ’80s of this game are filled with strange technology and top secret, government-run projects. The twin large particle accelerators in Sweden and the US are still active. “Balanced autonomous systems” (commonly known as robots) are commonplace and 10,000 ton gauss freighters traffic the Tundra route to Siberia. This is the era of the Tales from the Loop.\n\n15\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\nTEN MOVIES ■■ Ghostbusters (’84) ■■ Top Gun (’86) ■■ Return of the Jedi ■■ The Goonies (’85) ■■ E.T. (’82) ■■ The Breakfast Club ■■ Back to the Future ■■ Stand By Me (’86) ■■ Gremlins (’84) ■■ Karate Kid (’84)\n\n(’83) (’85) (’85)\n\nIn the years after the second World War, the major powers invested huge amounts of time and money in experimental research programs. Most of these yielded almost no results, but a few of them paid off handsomely. The so-called magnetrine effect was discovered by scientists in the Soviet Union, and gave birth to the majestic gauss freighters that, in the decades that followed, became a common sight, especially in the northern hemisphere. The magnetrine effect is distinctly weaker in the southern hemisphere, limiting its use to smaller gauss ships there. In the US, the world’s first particle accelerator was constructed in Boulder City, Nevada, in the 1950s. Part\n\nof a military program, its scientific findings were unclear, and rumors calling it a failure spread. That did not stop scientists in Sweden from following suit. In the 1960s, the Swedish government formed Riksenergi, an agency tasked with building the world’s largest particle accelerator on the Mälaren Islands outside of Stockholm. The Facility for Research in High Energy Physics was inaugurated in 1969, and top scientists from all over Sweden relocated to the area so as to partake in one of the most ambitious scientific endeavors of its time. It did not take long for the inhabitants of the islands to come up with a new name for the facility: The Loop. Meanwhile, the Japanese company Iwasaka perfected the self-balancing machine in laboratories in Osaka. In the ’70s and ’80s, these machines, most often simply called robots, became a more common sight in industries and defense forces. MAKING THE FANTASTIC MUNDANE The world of the Tales from the Loop is our world, but it’s also quite different. The discovery of the magnetrine effect and the perfecting of robot technology in the late ’60s have made things we consider fantastic commonplace in this world. Keep in mind that while seeing a huge gauss ship cruise above the ground is an awe-inspiring sight for the Kids in this game, it is not something magical or fantastical. They grew up in this reality; for them, hovering magnetrine ships and robots are as normal as jets or computers are to us. Tales from the Loop is science fiction, but it is not about technology. At its heart, this game is about growing up in the shadows of strange things and solving mysteries. It is about the Kids.\n\nSCIENCE – A TIMELINE 1950-59 ■■ Scientists in the Soviet Union discover the Magnetrine Effect. ■■ The world’s first particle accelerator is built in Boulder City, Nevada.\n\n16\n\n1960-69 ■■ Iwasaka, a Japanese company, develops the self-balancing machine, laying the foundation for the development of what are today known as robots. ■■ Riksenergi, the government agency tasked with operating the Swedish accelerator, is founded. ■■ Department of Advanced Research into Teleportation is started by the US government agency ARPA. ■■ The construction of the Swedish accelerator.

Some call it a socialist utopia, others a failed experiment of finding a middle way between capitalism and communism. It is a country governed by the monolithic Social Democratic party, who have ruled more or less single-handedly since World War II. It’s a far cry from the communist countries of Eastern Europe, but the belief that the government should care for its citizens from the cradle to grave is still strong. Education is free for everyone, as is health care. Alcohol is only sold in state owned Systembolaget stores, there are only two TV channels - both state owned and showing a mix of American soap operas, Swedish social realist dramas, and cartoons from behind the Iron Curtain. Sweden is officially neutral, and is not aligned with NATO or the Warsaw Pact. Indeed, it was one of the few countries in Europe that was not occupied and did not fight in World War II, a subject that has been much debated among its less lucky neighbors. But regardless of what Finns or Norwegians think about Sweden’s way of not taking sides, it is firmly entrenched in the Swedish psyche. The Social Democratic government has good diplomatic relations with both the Soviet Union and the US. But even if the official stance always is to never pick a side, it is an open secret that the\n\nSwedish military, many politicians, and a large part of the population only really see one obvious enemy: the Soviet Union. There are rumors that cooperation with NATO countries is more widespread than commonly believed, and some talk about secret research and intelligence projects in cooperation with US representatives. When the Soviet submarine U-137 runs aground outside Blekinge in southern Sweden in 1981, the threat suddenly becomes very real.\n\n1970-79 ■■ Scientific work commences at the Loop. Scientists from all over Sweden, and indeed Europe are recruited to the project. ■■ The first civilian autonomous robots enter service. ■■ Robot-wave tactics used by Chinese in the Baikal Wars fail, bringing military use of robots to an end.\n\n1980-89 ■■ Hans Albrechtsson takes over as Director of the Loop. ■■ The Swedish Armed Forces introduces the AMAT1, crewed self-balancing machines. ■■ Strange sightings are reported around the Loop. Wildlife patrols are increased.\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nTHE SWEDISH LOOP\n\n17\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\nAfter the incident, the Swedish navy steps up its efforts, and submarine hunting becomes a regular thing throughout the rest of the decade, although with no tangible results. Sweden is also a changing society. Influence from the West, and especially the US and the UK, is growing stronger both in popular culture and in economic policies. So-called “yuppies” are celebrating the capitalist way in Stockholm, with one hand on an absurdly large mobile phone and the other on the steering wheel of a Porsche. Kids are playing with Garbage Pail Kids, HeMan and Transformers. The personal computer can be found in many homes, most often in the form of the Commodore 64. Pen and paper roleplaying games, like Drakar och Demoner and Mutant, sell 100,000 copies. Going on charter vacations becomes a national pastime. The shift from the idealistic and political ’70s to a more individual and pleasure-seeking way of life in the ’80s is gradual, but clear. In February 1986, Swedes awake to momentous news: the iconic Prime Minister Olof Palme has been murdered in cold blood in downtown Stockholm. The murder will never be solved, and some claim that this marks the end of the age of innocence in Sweden. Throughout the decade, the Swedes carry on with their lives the way they have always done. Enduring the long cold winters, spending the short but beautiful summers in country houses, and the rest of the year longing for next summer. GROWING UP IN SWEDEN Being a kid in 1980s Sweden feels like being stuck between the past and a bright, shining future. There are still only two channels on the TV, the computers in school are hopelessly outdated ABC 80s, and a vocal minority of the adult world sees parts of popular culture, such as horror films, computer games, and heavy metal, as soul-corrupting garbage. Still, things are exponentially better than the drab, grey ’70s when your older siblings grew up. VHS tapes of American movies are copied and distributed among friends, pirated cassettes full of Commodore 64 games are tiny slices of heaven for enthusiasts, and the music scene is alight with decadent and deliciously dangerous metal groups as well as stylish and glitzy synth pop duos.\n\n18\n\nTeen magazines such as Okej (glam rockers), Datormagazinet (computer games), and Frida (love and heartache) are required reading for the young, as well as comics such as the popular Fantomen (The Phantom), Spindelmannen (Spider-Man), and Min Häst (for horseriding youth). Parents have a less controlling parenting style in the ’80s, and often let Kids keep to themselves without any major interference. Kids are allowed to roam the countryside as they please, as long as they return before dark. It is also a decade where divorce becomes commonplace, and many kids grow up in separate homes. Turbulence at home and the existential uncertainty that comes with this casts a shadow over many kids who seek to understand what is happening to their once so-called safe families. School is mandatory and free. All kids go to the grundskola (basic school) at the age of seven, and continue for nine years before they go on to two to four years in gymnasiet (college). English is taught from an early age, and because all television shows and movies only have subtitles in Swedish, kids learn to speak English very well, although often with Hollywood-like accents rather than the British English that is most often taught in school. The school system is relatively fair and progressive, but echoes of archaic methods from the ’60s still remain. Teachers are often kind and well-meaning, but hopelessly out of touch with the realities of the kids. Bullying is a real and commonplace problem, and teachers and parents alike struggle to handle it properly. For some, the school years are torture at the hands of their so-called comrades, and the only respite they find is in like-minded friends or an escape into dreams of something else.\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nTHE MÄLAREN ISLANDS: A SLICE OF SUBURBIA In many ways, the group of small islands called the Mälaren Islands (Mälaröarna in Swedish) is the archetypical suburban landscape of middle-class Sweden. Located just a short car ride from the capital of Stockholm, the Mälaren Islands are not quite in the city nor in the countryside. It’s a bit of both. The landscape is dotted with red cottages and farms. Vast fields stretch towards the water of Lake Mälaren that surrounds the islands. Swaths of forest full of birch, oak, and pine trees break up the landscape. There are a handful of schools, several supermarkets, and even a 17th century palace on the islands. But mostly they are home to regular Swedes: families, workers, loners, and now, also scientists. GETTING AROUND The main roads on the Mälaren Islands are paved and in good condition; these are made for car and bus traffic and quite narrow, making cycling on them an exciting and dangerous prospect. For Kids, the three main ways of getting around the islands are walking, cycling, and taking the communal bus. The 18-year-old age minimum for getting a driver’s license makes cars a distant fantasy, but as you only need to be 15 to use a moped, this is often the vehicle of choice for cool, older Kids. For the most part though, the bike reigns supreme, and is used all the time to visit friends, go to school or go exploring the countryside. BMX bikes are very popular, as are, to a lesser degree, road handlebar bikes, although they are less useful in rough terrain. Popular brands are Crescent (its model “Världsmästarcykeln” is iconic), Monark (made of paper and bark as the saying goes) and DBS. Buses from Stockholms Lokaltrafik (SL) traverse the islands and connect them with greater Stockholm. Most kids that have a long trip to school have SL cards that allow them to use the buses as often as they want. Less fortunate kids have to pay the fare, which often makes the difference between having the money to buy a soda or not. Still, as the islands are quite heavily forested and full of difficult terrain, walking is often the method\n\nof choice for exploring the surrounding lands. Even though Kids are often free to come and go as they please, most keep close to their homes and school. Going farther than a couple of kilometers from home feels like going on an expedition into strange lands.\n\n19\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\nTHINGS TO DO IN THE ’80S Being a Kid in ’80s Sweden is living with the constant stress from homework, the social games in school, and demands from parents and siblings at home. It’s hard to be a Kid; what with school tests, local bullies, and other, much cooler kids, it sometimes feels like life is out to get you. When this happens (and it does, a lot) your only allies are your real friends and the dreams about something else. Whatever forms they take. Boredom is ever-present, days feel like they never end, visits to grandparents are mind-numbingly slow, and chores at home seem to always turn up when you least want them. It’s no wonder that Kids have perfected a number of ways to pass the time together. HANG OUT AT THE LOCAL KIOSK Wherever you go in Sweden, there is always a kiosk somewhere to gather near. These small newspaper stands stock magazines, candy, and tobacco. They are often staffed by grumpy old men who are very skeptical of the youngsters constantly hanging about but almost never buying anything. In some towns, these are replaced by grill kiosks, with the same basic concept, but selling hot dogs and hamburgers instead of magazines. Regardless, whenever a Kid happens to get a cash windfall, his next stop is invariably the kiosk. GO TO A SCHOOL DISCO There are no proms in Swedish schools, but there are school discos. These always awkward affairs are equally filled with angst and short-lived bliss. Most often arranged in some local building decorated with balloons and confetti, these discos consist of kids standing in groups hugging the walls, while more daring youths take to the floor to dance to the latest pop hits. Alcohol being off limits, popcorn and lemonade are consumed in great quantities before the obligatory slow dance begins. The slow dance is the real deal, the thing everybody has been waiting for. To songs such as “Carrie” by Europe or “Winds of Change” by Scorpions, Kids ask for a dance (it’s considered bad form to say no) and dance while holding each other by the backs and slowly rocking from one foot to the other, desperately trying not to step on the dance partner’s feet. Outside of these events, it’s not uncommon to find older Kids listening to boom boxes and drinking folköl (weak beer that can be bought in stores if you are 18).\n\n20\n\nPLAY GAMES Games become extremely popular in the ’80s, both in digital and analogue versions. The personal computer is finally affordable for an average family, and the Commodore 64 dominates the major part of the decade, to be followed by the Atari ST and the Amiga. C64 tapes are hard currency in school yards around the country, especially the so-called “turbo tapes,” where up to 40 games are compressed on a single tape (although most of them won’t work). A common practice is to gather at a friend’s place after school and play games until dinner time. Pen and paper roleplaying games are sold in great numbers throughout the decade. Thanks to the Swedish company Äventyrsspel, Sweden has one of the highest number of RPG players per capita in the world. The Swedish games Drakar och Demoner and Mutant are the best sellers, while older Kids prefer to play games in English, such as Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu and Rolemaster. For some Kids, playing RPGs offers a way to channel creativity and imagination previously unheard of. It’s popular to create homebrew games, drawing complicated maps, and writing adventures. Roleplaying is even done during school breaks, without dice or rules, just telling stories and acting in them.\n\nTEN SONGS Take On Me - A-ha (’85) n Billie Jean - Michael Jackso (’82) ture Club ■■ Karma Chameleon - Cul (’83) - Europe (’86) ■■ The Final Countdown 4) ■■ Jump - Van Halen (’8 e Fun Hav To t Wan t ■■ Girls Jus 3) (’8 per Cyndi Lau – Jefferson ■■ We Built This City 5) (’8 Starship - Berlin (’86) ■■ Take My Breath Away ricane ■■ Rock You Like A Hur 4) (’8 Scorpions e It - Twisted ■■ We’re Not Gonna Tak Sister (’84)\n\n■■ ■■\n\nSVARTSJÖLANDET: BLACK WATER AND DEEP FORESTS Svartsjölandet (Black Lake Lands in English), also known as Färingsö to some, is the main island of the setting. It covers an area of 82 square kilometers and is surrounded on all sides by Lake Mälaren. Below are some of the important places on Svartsjölandet listed with short descriptions. FÄRENTUNA A small village housing 60-70 inhabitants. Mostly known for its old, stone church constructed in the 12th century, and which still stands today. Enclosed in the 900-year-old walls are the so-called Uppland rune writings, artifacts of the pagans that lived here before Christianity conquered the lands. The runes read “… his wife… and… Odrik, his father. God help his soul.” KUNGSBERGA A minor settlement where a few hundred people live. Kungsberga has nothing to distinguish it from other settlements, only a small food store and a newspaper kiosk.\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nWATCH VIDEOS Video stores are popular, but as most families won’t own a VHS player until the mid ‘80s, the rentable moviebox is the solution of choice. This is a VHS player in a sturdy plastic carrying case that is rented for a day. As you need to be 18 years old to rent video films, this is the domain of parents and older siblings. A kid who happens to have a moviebox at home is envied by all, and often keeps court in which friends re-watch the rented movies in the middle of the day. Getting the moviebox and films back to the video store before 6 pm is often an adventure in itself, as the Kids struggle to view all of the movies before time’s up. The debate about the so-called video violence is a major topic in the media of the time. Talk shows on TV discuss the negative impact of American horror movies, and the older generation of Swedes struggles with how to deal with these gory movies suddenly being so easy to get hold of. This is not something that most Kids notice. For most of them, every VHS tape is a box filled with mysteries.\n\nSTAVSBORG’S FACTORY An abandoned factory in ruins. No one really knows what was made here, but most agree that it had something to do with explosives. Today, most people stay clear of the old buildings; rumors say it’s being used by local criminals for shady business. STENHAMRA The largest settlement on the island, Stenhamra is home to a few thousand people, and has all the basic facilities needed. Here, you can find two schools, a library, a supermarket, a small boat harbor, and a pizzeria. The town is mostly known for its abandoned stone quarry that has given the village its name (Stenhamra is roughly translated to Stonehammer). The quarry, one of the largest of its kind in Sweden, employed workers that toiled around the clock. It was worked from 1884 until 1919 – providing the lion’s share of Stockholm’s stone work. Scores of workers died during those years, many of them in grisly accidents, others of tuberculosis. Today, the quarry has been left for nature to reclaim, and is mostly filled with dark water. Occasionally, film crews come here for the spectacular scenery, but otherwise wild animals, loners, and nosy kids are the only ones visiting the Stenhamra quarry today. SVARTSJÖ PALACE A stone palace built in the rococo style by the Swedish king Fredrik I in the 18th century, as a gift to his queen Ulrika Eleonora. Partly built by the British royal architect William Chambers, it stands on the ruins of another royal castle that burned to the ground in the 17th century. After a century of decay, it was converted to a facility for forced labor so as to mine the granite deposits nearby. It served as a prison up until 1965. Today, it stands mostly unused, a shadow of its former glorious self. The prison walls have been demolished, and the cells abandoned. But the beautiful facade still hides many dark secrets from the past.\n\n21\n\nPRI\n\nN\n\nIN FL UX\n\nKO LB ÄC K\n\nA\n\nC\n\nE\n\nE\n\nL CE c\n\nc\n\ne\n\nle\n\nT RA t ra\n\nOR n Tu\n\n-\n\nP\n\nneL\n\nor\n\nACC\n\n1\n\n-\n\nM\n\n1\n\nELERATOR\n\nPRI\n\nALHOLMEN\n\nA\n\nR\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\nT 23 26\n\n1\n\nDÄVE\n\nLAGNÖ\n\nDäve Fact\n\n-\n\nBjörkfjärden\n\nGö\n\nTO RA\n\nLE\n\nk\n\nACCE\n\nis\n\nGATE 2D-3B\n\nBona\n\nTHE BONA REACTOR\n\nSv\n\nin\n\nA\n\nWäsby\n\nG\n\nCooling Tow\n\nM\n\nnd\n\nE\n\nU\n\net\n\nTofta\n\nDalby\n\nD\n\nWEST GATE 5D\n\nSätra\n\nrd\n\nOUTFLUX MÄ LSÅKER\n\nLöten\n\nNo\n\nBASTLAGNÖ\n\nsu\n\nM Ä L A\n\nR\n\nA\n\nUX\n\nÖ L S\n\nStenby Lundkulla\n\nHovgårdsfjärden\n\nPrästfjärden\n\nOUTFLUX BOTKYRKA\n\nAdjustments to map by Rikskartor, Stockholm 1981\n\n22\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nPrint 101 no. 403 THE MÄLAREN ISLANDS\n\nNORTH GATE 5B\n\nTHE MÄLAREN FACILITY\n\nT H EAREALMAP OOP\n\nIM\n\n-\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n\n2\n\nKM Service Tunnel\n\nENSÖ\n\nFerry Route\n\nELDGARNSÖ\n\nensö tory\n\nTransport Tunnel Civilian Road\n\nöholmen\n\nNästfjärden\n\nSkarnholmen Löftet\n\nForest\n\nVendeludd Lunda\n\nka\n\nIlända Kungsberga Ölsta\n\nVä\n\nS\n\nGob\n\nV\n\ni\n\nGATE 3C-4FStavsborg\n\nPopulated Area\n\nlm\n\nsv\n\nik\n\nen\n\nCompass Error 1981 Appr. 1 Gradian East Local irregularities may occur.\n\nHILLESHÖG\n\nRESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT\n\nT\n\nSätuna\n\nho\n\nIndustrial Area\n\nR\n\nFÄRENTUNA\n\nFarmland\n\nEAST GATE 5C\n\nA\n\nwers\n\nnt\n\nVän tho lme n\n\nS\n\nJ\n\nLå\n\nN\n\nL\n\nrm\n\nÖ\n\nta\n\nÖ\n\nng\n\nS\n\nSånga-Säby Svartsjöanstalten\n\nA\n\nen\n\nTorslunda\n\nN Edeby\n\nD\n\nSockarby\n\nSOUTH GATE 5D\n\nSTENHAMRA\n\nE Mörby\n\nVäsby\n\nT Skå Menhammar Troxhammar Skytteholm\n\nEneby\n\nE K\n\nE\n\nR\n\nÖ\n\nRikskartor Stockholm 1981\n\nNot approved for general distribution, Statens lantmäteriverk April 27, 1981 130930\n\n23\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\nSVARTSJÖ PRISON When the prison in the palace was dismantled, Svartsjö Prison was constructed to replace it. Divided into a men’s wing and a women’s wing, the prison is made up of a score of low, flat buildings inside the perimeter of security fencing. Used for low-risk criminals, the prisoners live a reasonably comfortable life here, mostly caring for themselves and cooking their own food. Being a prison, there are, of course, rumors about the inmates and their crimes. Some say there is a known hole in the fence, and that some prisoners use this to move freely on the island.\n\nMUNSÖ: HOME OF THE LOOP The island of Munsö is home to the heart of the scientific installations of the Mälaren Islands, the Loop itself. Still open to the public, the northern part is where the main buildings and installations are found. Around these, the immediate surroundings are sealed off for everyone other than cleared personnel. THE BONA TOWERS The three massive cooling towers of Bona are a landmark visible from far away. The tallest of them reaches 253 meters into the air. The purpose of the towers is to release the heat created by the huge amount of energy released by the Gravitron, the heart of the Loop that powers the entire particle accelerator deep underground. Around the towers are scores of red wooden houses. These are home to the scientists working at the Loop and their families. DEFENSE RESEARCH FACILITY 14 The FOA (Försvarets forskningsanstalt or the Swedish Defense Research Agency) facility at Sätra is classified as Top Secret and off limits to the public. Obviously, this fuels rumors as to what is really going on behind its wired fences. Some say the FOA researchers work on a military application of the Loop, others that they perform weird experiments on local animals, and even people. What is known is that military robot prototypes have been spotted on the premises, and that the facility is guarded around the clock.\n\n24\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\n25\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\nADELSÖ: REMNANTS OF THE PAST Of the three islands detailed here, Adelsö is the wildest and least built up. Covered by deep forests, the island’s only real inhabitants are a few farmers in small settlements. Once an important island during the Viking Age, the island is dotted with graves from the Bronze Age and forward. Two old stone fortresses can be found here, mostly overrun by nature, but their once proud selves can still be glimpsed. LILLA STENBY A small village with roughly 140 inhabitants, Lilla Stenby houses a small food store and a harbor with a ferry that connects it to the island of Munsö. HOVGÅRDEN Once a royal estate, Hovgården consists of ancient grave fields, rune stones, a castle ruin, and an old “tingsplats” (meeting place from the Viking Age). Among the old stones and grassy hills are a few houses and a church. North of the church are the three Kungshögarna (“Royal Mounds”), burial chambers within mounds, the largest being almost six meters tall. According to the historical chronicle The Life of Ansgard by Rimbart, these are the graves of the kings Olof, Björn, and Erik. These kings were the ones that first received the Christian missionaries to Sweden, and probably resided here in Hovgården. SÄTRA YOUTH CORRECTIONAL FACILITY On the northern tip of the island, there is a remote building that houses a youth correctional center. Home to a dozen kids of various backgrounds, and a number of staff that live and work here, the building only sees regular visitors when food and other supplies arrive every other week. Sometimes kids manage to escape from the facility, prompting the police to come looking for them, and most often finding them quickly. However, people are still talking about the two kids from Norrland that disappeared a few years back, never to be seen again. Some say they drowned in Lake Mälaren trying to swim to the mainland, others claim they were seen sneaking around the tombs of Hovgården before they got lost.\n\n26\n\nRIKSENERGI In the 1960s, the Swedish government decided that it would construct a large-scale particle accelerator on the Mälaren Islands close to Stockholm. The location was chosen because of the proximity to the capital, but also because the bedrock here was considered suitable for constructing an underground facility of this magnitude. To oversee this huge project, the state agency Riksenergi was created, and immediately granted plentiful funds. Considered by some a sister organization to Televerket, the state-owned telephone and communications operator, in reality Riksenergi has next to nothing to do with its more mundane sibling. Under the first director, Sten Ankarsjö, the agency started recruiting top scientists from around the country. Attracted by the proposition of working on the world’s largest\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\naccelerator and by the rewarding relocation package, hundreds of scientists took the offer and committed to working on the project for years to come. Riksenergi is by far the largest employer on the Mälaren Islands, and as such, is generally viewed favorably by the population. Some consider the agency as “theirs” and are very protective about its activities, even when bad rumors sometimes circulate. Even though security around the vital installations (especially the installations below ground) is tight, movement on the islands is relatively unrestricted. This “open door” policy has been questioned by some as naive, and there are persistent rumors of foreign-sounding strangers camping around the island, claiming to be birdwatchers but with their binoculars firmly trained on the scientific installations.\n\nTHE LOOP From its inception in 1969, the Facility for Research in High Energy Physics, or simply “The Loop,” is the largest particle accelerator of its kind in the world. The Mälaröarna Facility was built by the newly formed government agency Riksenergi, together with the state-owned corporation Atomenergi, on the island of Munsö, some 26 kilometers northwest of downtown Stockholm. Construction began in 1961, using the best of Swedish engineering and know-how. Tunnels were blasted deep into the bedrock, creating the enormous loops for the world's largest particle accelerators, centered around a huge chamber housing the Gravitron. The facility was powered by the Bona reactor, a subterranean nuclear power plant whose most prominent feature are the three huge cooling towers, the tallest rising 253 meters above the rural surroundings.\n\n27\n\nCHAPTER O2 28\n\nThe scale of the Loop – or rather Loops – is daunting. The main particle accelerator, Prim-1, has a diameter of 26 kilometers, unsurpassed anywhere in the world. It is capable of performing experiments that were previously only dreamt of. There is also the secondary accelerator, Prim-2, at 20 kilometers in diameter, and lastly, the auxiliary accelerator, Aux-1, with a diameter of a “mere” 16 kilometers. Add to this the access tunnels and other underground installations, and one has one of the most impressive engineering feats ever seen. It isn't known how a small nation like Sweden could afford such a massive undertaking, as large parts of the project's budget were classified, but there's speculation that private investors, international corporations, universities, and the US government provided funds in exchange for access to the facility and the results of the research conducted there. To enter the main entrance of the Loop, a visitor needs to pass through two security checks, have valid credentials, and be scheduled to work or visit, making it next to impossible for any unwanted intruders to slip in. It is safe to say that no Kids will be allowed in here through any means. However, there are a number of service tunnels stretching below and around the islands, and these have separate entrances. Though guarded by security systems, and requiring special codes and cards to open, there have been rumors that some locals have managed to open one of these entrances, and have snuck around in the tunnels for short periods before being discovered. Not much is publicly known about what kind of experiments are performed at the facility. Some claim that Riksenergi has failed to get the installation to perform at its full capacity, others that the nature of the experiments have changed drastically since the second director, Hans Albrechtsson, took over the reins at Riksenergi. What is known is that US delegations, some of them uniformed, have visited the facility, fueling speculations that the science worked on at the Loop might somehow have military applications. Most of the projects and experiments conducted at the Loop are secret, which has resulted in a lot of speculation. The nature of some of the anomalies appearing in the area gives some hints, though. The high energies released in combination with ex-\n\nperiments with anomalous materials are believed to cause minor and major resonance cascades, which in turn, opens rifts in the space-time continuum. There are persistent rumors of large, reptilian animals having been seen in the woods on the Mälaren Islands. Most people disregard this as kids’ fantasies about dinosaurs, but some have noticed that the Riksenergi game warden team has been unusually active lately and seemingly on constant alert. Using JR-17 hunting robots and MSPB-13 magnetrine armored reconnaissance cars, the warden team patrols the area around the Loop facilities, officially to make sure “wild animals” are not a reason for concern to the scientific installations. There are rumors of an illness among the workers, scientists, and other staff working in proximity to the Gravitron. This so-called “Loop sickness” has symptoms of psychological disorders, including nightmares, depression, rage, alcoholism, and drug use, sometimes leading to suicide. It appears that the longer someone is exposed to the Gravitron, the higher the risk of developing the disorder. Unconfirmed rumors claim that Riksenergi employees fill a whole wing at the Beckomberga psychiatric hospital in west Stockholm. One intriguing, and not completely understood, type of machinery is the echo sphere, which appears here and there in the landscape. These metal spheres, up to a few meters in diameter, each accessible through a round hatch, lie seemingly abandoned in the countryside around the Loop. The spheres can feel warm to the touch (or icy cold), give off a tingling sensation, cause nausea, or emit flashing lights emanating from the inside. Some carry a sign marked “Rogosin Locke Industries, Bethesda, Maryland,” while others are unmarked. It’s possible that the echo spheres are the remains from a previous experiment by Riksenergi, as no one has claimed ownership of the spheres, and they are often left to rust. What their true purpose was – or is – is not known. Maybe they are still active somehow. Unconfirmed reports from locals claim that animals (and even people) that have entered some spheres have vanished into thin air. Whatever the truth of the matter is, most agree that echo spheres are best left alone.\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nCIVILIAN TECHNOLOGY The discovery of the magnetrine effect in 1943 facilitated the revolution in transport technology that was to last for half a century. The Earth’s magnetic fields were strong enough to provide the needed lift north of a line spanning from the Mexican border to the Mediterranean, through the Middle East and along the Himalayas, and curving up towards Japan. This meant that magnetrine ships (also known as Gauss freighters) can only travel along routes in the northern hemisphere, spanning the northern three quarters of the Eurasian continent, North America, and the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Traditional shipping by ocean-going ships is still very much in use, both in the rest of the world and in the magnetrine shipping zone. In Sweden, exports like cars, iron ore, paper, and timber are shipped via magnetrine ships to destinations ranging from Japan in the east to California in the west. The powerful magnetic fields created by the larger magnetrine ships make it inconvenient to have them travel through densely populated areas, as they affect local electronics. They have to follow routes, usually the same as traditional ships, but also specially designated “corridors” across land. Smaller ships are less risky, but they aren’t used in cities or other built-up\n\nareas, which is why older technology like trucks and trains are still used. Most coastal cities have magnetrine ship ports, where the cargo is usually loaded on trucks for local and regional distribution. Railway transport is faster than magnetrine vessels, and the same goes for road transport. That’s why there’s a need for traditional wheeled vehicles. Airplanes still have their role, too, as they are faster and not limited by the magnetic fields, but there are magnetrine luxury liners for those who like to travel in style. The principle of the magnetrine drive is simple: magnetrine discs mounted along the bottom part of a hull are charged, the resulting magnetic field repelling the ship against the magnetic field of the Earth, providing the lift needed. The discs on modern vessels are auto-correcting, adjusting to local variations in the magnetic field. In order to propel the vessel, the discs are engaged in sequences, rapidly changing the polarity of the discs in what is known as “caterpillar drive,” creating a pull-and-push effect that provides locomotion. Most magnetrine ships are diesel-powered single or twin turbine vessels with a deadweight tonnage (DWT, the weight of everything the ship carries, excluding the ship itself) of up to 80,000 metric tons. Some of the largest freighters are nuclear-powered. The ships come in four classes:\n\n29\n\nCHAPTER O2 ■■ MAGLIGHT (5,000 to 10,000 DWT), up to 100 me-\n\nters in length. ■■ MAGMID (10,000 to 25,000 DWT), up to 200 meters in length. ■■ MAGMAX (25,000 to 50,000 DWT), up to 250 meters in length. ■■ SUPERMAG (50,000 to 80,000 DWT), up to 300 meters in length. There are also the smaller vessels for local transport, service and maintenance, military operations, and so forth. Magnetrine discs are used for other purposes, too, such as unmanned drones, road traffic control, construction of buildings, and suspending billboards in the air.\n\nMILITARY TECHNOLOGY The military applications of the magnetrine technology are plentiful – on paper. After many weapons projects,\n\n30\n\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the technology have become evidently manifest. First out of the block were the Soviets, as Mikhail Vorobyev had discovered the effect back in 1943. World War II was over before it could be applied to weapons (it was originally a spinoff find while researching long-distance missile guidance systems), but during the first years of the Cold War, Soviet scientists experimented with magnetrine technology and armored vehicles. After Soviet scientist Vladimir Degtaryev defected to the West in 1951, the US got access to the technology, and soon several other Western countries did, too. One obvious area of research was armored vehicles. Magnetrine hovertanks proved to be problematic, though. The limitations of armor-to-lift ratios made the tanks too lightly armored, and coupled with the raised silhouette, hover tanks proved to be unsuitable for the modern battlefield. The area where magnetrine technology proved useful was in supply and trans-\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\nport. Magnetrine transports filled the niche between wheeled trucks and helicopters, combining capacity with all-terrain access. Magnetrine cargo and troop transports became part of frontline units, as well as lightly armored reconnaissance vehicles. As the magnetrine tech worked best in the northern hemisphere, it couldn’t be utilized in the Vietnam War or in many other conflicts in the Third World, and thus saw limited combat use. When the self-balancing issue was solved by Iwasaki in the late 1960s, military self-balancing autonomous systems – or robots – soon saw the light of day. Classic, humanoid robots proved to be inferior on the battlefield, as they simply couldn’t react and adapt like human soldiers. Instead, they were useful for sentry duty and load carrying. Larger robots were more or less autonomous, most commonly patrolling border areas or remote-controlled by human operators, either with line-of-sight “control glove” systems, or via sat-\n\nellite uplink from control centers. As artificial intelligence improved, robots became more independent, like the Swedish-built ABM-100. Problems with military robots have usually been associated with poor or rogue AIs. The Baikal Wars in the 1970s saw Chinese “robot wave” tactics fail due to weak command and control systems. As for Sweden, secret research conducted at the FOA facility at Sätra on Munsö included military robots. Despite safety measures, some of the robots are known to have escaped. It is possible that their AI is a little too good, as there are rumors that not all of them have been rounded up. Swedish Army AMAT-2 quadruped robots, painted in a standard army camouflage pattern, have been deployed from time to time in order to deal with extraordinary incidents on and around the islands. The AMAT-2 and its predecessor, AMAT-1, have been successful exports, serving in the armies of Norway, Austria, Brazil, South Africa, and Malaysia.\n\n31\n\nCHAPTER O2\n\n32\n\nTHE AGE OF THE LOOP\n\n33\n\nO3 CHAPTER\n\nLIVING IN AMERICA\n\n35\n\nBOULDER CITY: “BEST CITY BY A DAM SITE” 37 THINGS TO DO IN THE ’80S\n\n38\n\nINSIDE BOULDER CITY\n\n40\n\nLAKE MEAD\n\n42\n\nLAS VEGAS AND BEYOND\n\n45\n\nTHE DART\n\n45\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\n46\n\nTHE US LOOP A project as big as the Loop could never have been realized without international collaboration. Even if Swedes would have liked to see it as a Swedish project through and through, it was clear that a lot of the technology and expertise behind the facility was developed in other countries, primarily in the USA. American experience and technology from similar projects in the Nevada desert turned out to be invaluable in the construction of the Loop. Some even say that the whole project was only possible because of an American desire to have a technological presence in the Baltic Sea area. There was much speculation about what part the Loop played in the Cold War, and some questions may never be answered.\n\nThe Loop might have reached its highest level of notoriety in Sweden, but it got its start as a top-secret military project in the USA. Specifically, it began in Boulder City, Nevada, a sleepy little town just a half-hour’s drive southeast of Las Vegas, overlooking Lake Mead. While it started out in the early days of the Cold War in the 1950s, the US Loop peaked in the heady years of the 1980s. The Loop was originally meant to investigate the possibility of instantaneous teleportation between two points on the planet. It was formed under the auspices of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was known simply as ARPA at the time. President Dwight D. Eisenhower himself ordered the creation of the Department of Advanced Research into Teleportation (DART), hoping to employ the fruits of its labors as a means of moving troops around the globe at a moment’s notice.\n\nBut that initial promise – secret as it might have been – was never fulfilled, and the city seems to have suffered for it.\n\nLIVING IN AMERICA Although Boulder City can sometimes seem like a deserted island in the middle of an endless sea of sand, it’s actually not a terrible place to grow up. AMERICA IN THE ’80S America in the age of the Loop isn’t quite the same as the one you might remember. Strange airships scud across the sky, floating atop gigantic magnetrine discs. Robots perform a lot of the heavy labor, often guided by human operators – but sometimes not.\n\n35\n\nCHAPTER O3\n\nTEN TV SHOWS 8)\n\n■■ Magnum P.I.

The ‘80s is the era of Ronald Reagan, the former actor who becomes the nation’s oldest-ever President by promising a “morning in America.” It’s a time when Americans want to have faith in their government restored to them after it’s been shattered by Watergate and President Nixon’s resignation. The threat of an imminent nuclear holocaust may cast a shadow over everything, but by the end of the decade, the Soviet Union is knocked onto the ropes, and it seems there’s nothing America can’t do. At the same time, that faith turns out to be founded on a pack of lies. Reagan doesn’t just free the hostages from Iran in 1981. Instead, in 1980, he negotiates for them to be held until his inauguration, to help him win the election. Not too much later, the CIA refuses to obey Congress’ ban on helping prop up the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Congress also cuts off funding to CIA efforts to overthrow the Sandinistas in that war-torn nation, but CIA agents illegally procure their own funds for the cause by selling weapons to America’s enemies in Iran instead. For the most part, though, no one knows this until later in the decade. And to Kids in America, little of this matters directly to them anyway.\n\n36\n\nAt the start of the decade, underage drinking reaches deep into high schools, because the drinking age in much of the country is 18 – although it had been 21 in Nevada since the end of Prohibition. That starts to change in 1984, when Congress forces the states to raise the national drinking age to 21. At the same time, the Reagan administration heats up the War on Drugs, sending First Lady Nancy Reagan out with the slogan, “Just Say No.” While widely mocked, teen use of drugs drops during the decade from its highs in the ‘70s. Meanwhile, the era of Free Love comes to an end with the rise of HIV and AIDS. This world-wide epidemic infects millions of people who share dirty needles or have unprotected sex. Now, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) don’t just make you sick: they can literally kill you. Military service is entirely voluntary. While men have to register for the draft at age 18, no one’s been conscripted into the US military since the early ’70s. Perhaps because of this, the ’80s are comparatively peaceful. The US invades the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in December of 1989, but both operations are swift, limited, and conclusive. There are only four major TV stations in most of the country: ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS (Public Television). In 1986, Fox joins the fray. Cable TV is still rolling out over much of the nation, bringing new channels like HBO, MTV, and ESPN to American households. Cartoons start being broadcast in the afternoons, after school, rather than just on Saturday mornings. During the decade, the Federal Communication Commission ends the prohibition of toy companies making cartoons based on their products. They flood the airwaves with toy-based shows, including Transformers, My Little Pony, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe, and Thundercats. GROWING UP IN AMERICA Being a kid in 1980s America feels like being stuck between a wild, dangerous past and an even stranger and more complicated future. Your grandparents fought in World War II. Your parents either fought in or protested the Vietnam War. The Cold War seems to be heating up to the ignition point, and if you manage to survive that, you can see a corporate-owned, cyberpunk future\n\nto eight D-cell batteries. They also watch movies and TV shows on VCRs – both in VHS and Betamax formats – and swap copies of tapes recorded off broadcast TV with each other. Some kids play a lot of tabletop games, including Dungeons & Dragons, Traveller, and Middle-Earth Roleplaying (MERP). In certain areas, these games are banned – along with heavy metal music recordings – for fear that they might have a demonic influence on the kids who play them. The Satanic Panic causes a lot of hand-wringing, but the added notoriety seems to sell even more games and records than before. Most homes don’t have a computer in them, but in those that do, the Apple II and the Commodore 64 top the list, mostly because they offer video games more intricate than the ones you can find on the Atari, Colecovision, or Intellivision systems of the day, things like Zork and Castle Wolfenstein. This changes in 1985 when the relatively inexpensive Nintendo Entertainment System reaches America, and Super Mario Bros. storms the nation.\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\nheaving toward the digital horizon. You ride the wave of nostalgia that seems like it’s sure to crash on the shoals of nuclear armageddon, and the only thing you can hope for is that you can keep surfing long enough to grab a fresh wave laced with future shock. The only cell phones anyone has at this point are the size and weight of a brick, and they usually come attached to a car. If you want to get a hold of someone when you’re out of the house, you have to hunt for a pay phone and hope you have a quarter to plug into it. You don’t have GPS. You have paper maps that no one can seem to fold back together, and you have your memories. The upside is that no one can reach you unless you want to be found, and the idea of someone tracking you using an array of satellites ringing the planet seems like something out of Star Trek. The only apps anyone has come before dinner at your favorite restaurant. In America, you start school with kindergarten at the age of five. Grade school ranges from 1st through 5th or 6th grade, after which you go to middle school or junior high. High school usually starts with 9th grade and ends at 12th. Most kids go to public schools, which are free, although some parents pay tuition to send their kids to private schools instead. After high school, you head off to college or technical school – both of which you must pay for – or enter the job market straight away. Divorce rates reached a peak in the 1980s, leaving lots of kids living in single-parent homes. Most kids in such situations wind up living with their mothers. Sometimes they spend every other weekend with their fathers, who end up playing a smaller part in their lives. Almost all kids spend a good chunk of their waking hours in school. In homes where the parents both work – or there’s only one parent around – the kids often come home to an empty house, giving rise to a generation of latchkey kids. They tend to themselves, and sometimes younger siblings, until their parents get home from their jobs. If they don’t come straight home from school, there’s no one around to notice. In their spare time, many kids listen to tunes – including this new thing called rap music – on the radio or on cassettes. Some play their cassettes on portable players like the Sony Walkman or tote them around on their shoulders inside massive boom boxes that use six\n\nBOULDER CITY: “BEST CITY BY A DAM SITE” Boulder City is a sleepy little town in the middle of the Mojave Desert in southern Nevada. It started out as a town for the workers who labored on the Hoover Dam – which was originally known as the Boulder Dam. It was intended to be a model city for the area, but once the dam was finished, most of the businesses – and people – in the area moved off to Las Vegas or parts unknown instead. Most of the city went up between 1930 and 1934, so by the start of the 1980s, no building is over fifty years old. Unlike most cities in Nevada, gambling is prohibited inside Boulder City, which makes it feel a bit more normal than gambling meccas like Las Vegas. There are casinos that sit just outside the city’s borders, but Kids don’t have much to do with them. Less than 10,000 people live in the city at the start of the 1980s. By the end of the decade, there are about 12,500 in total. Everything is spread out over an area of 208 square miles, giving everyone in the city plenty of room. By land size, it’s the largest city in Nevada.\n\n37\n\nCHAPTER O3 The wealthiest people live on the top of the slope that leads down toward Lake Mead in the distance. The middle class lives below them, and the poorest people are at the bottom of the slope. The lots for homes at the top of the slope are spacious and friendly, but as you move down the slope, they become smaller and rougher. The citizens of Boulder City are about 95% white. Hispanics make up 4% of the city, and members of other races are few and far between. In the game, of course, Kids can be any race they like. The city sits on the eastern edge of the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8). When you cross into Arizona, which lies on the eastern side of the Hoover Dam, you’re in Mountain Time (UTC-7) instead. GETTING AROUND Most Kids walk around Boulder City or ride their bikes, but they can also grab a ride on the local bus\n\n38\n\nsystem, which even has intercity connections to Las Vegas. Lots of Kids ride standard BMX-style bikes, but as they get older, they often move up to road bikes. Few people have even heard of mountain bikes at the time. Older kids can get a license once they turn sixteen years old, and many kids go and take their driver’s test on their sixteenth birthday. Motorcycles and mopeds are popular because they’re cheaper than cars, and unlike in colder climates, they can be used all year round.\n\nTHINGS TO DO IN THE ’80S As a Kid in Boulder City in the 1980s, there’s not a lot to do outside of school, homework, and sports, which can seem to consume your entire life. Toss in stress induced by bullies and budding romances, and it sometimes seems like the only people you can truly count on\n\n■■ Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ■■ Rolemaster (1980) ■■ Top Secret (1980) ■■ Call of Cthulhu (19 81) ■■ Champions (1981) ■■ Gangbusters (1982) ■■ Star Frontiers (1982) ■■ Chill (1984) ■■ Pendragon (1985) ■■ Cyberpunk (1988)\n\n(1977)\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\nTEN TABLETOP RPGS\n\nopen year round. Most Kids wouldn’t be caught dead in it for about three quarters of the year, as the adults in town claim it mostly for swimming laps rather than playing around. During the winter, though, a die-hard few will venture inside for the daily hours of free play between 3:30 and 5 PM.\n\nin your life – at least to keep you from being bored out of your mind – are your friends. Although Boulder City is relatively close to Las Vegas, it’s not easy to reach without a car – or the determination to bicycle the 25 miles across the blazing desert. It’s less than 8 miles to Hoover Dam in the opposite direction, but once you’ve seen it, there’s not a whole lot of entertainment out that way. Most Kids hang out in town instead. HANG OUT AT THE POOL As hot as Boulder City can be, many kids head straight to the city pool once school lets out. In some ways, it’s an extension of the school, since kids tend to gather in the same cliques here as they do during the day. Some kids stick around until sunset, although most head home after 5 PM to join their families for dinner. There’s an indoor pool that’s heated, and kept\n\nPLAY GAMES When you’re stuck inside with the air conditioning and need to escape the boredom of living in a small town in the middle of nowhere, games are just the ticket. The wealthier kids might have Nintendo Entertainment Systems or even an old Atari machine kicking around. Others turn toward tabletop games which are cheap and endlessly renewable entertainment. Tabletop roleplaying games – led by Dungeons & Dragons – are in their golden age in the 1980s. Without a means of communicating with each other, most gamers have to figure out how to play the games themselves, rather than being taught. Fortunately, it’s easy to modify such games via house rules to fit any particular group’s style of play. Miniatures games like Warhammer Fantasy Battles (1983) and Warhammer 40,000 (1987) become incredibly popular during this time, too. Kids spend hours painting their armies of lead figures and then pitting them against each other on dining room tables and disused ping-pong tables across the country.\n\n39\n\nCHAPTER O3\n\nTEN MUSIC VIDEOS t Hats “Safety Dance” by Men Withou (1982) se” by the ■■ “Burning Down the Hou Talking Heads (1983) l Jackson ■■ “Thriller” by Michae (1983) Heart” by ■■ “Total Eclipse of the Bonnie Tyler (1983) a (1984) ■■ “Take on Me” by A-h ra Branigan Lau by l” tro Con ■■ “Self (1984) e It” by ■■ “We’re Not Gonna Tak Twisted Sister (1984) by Genesis ■■ “Land of Confusion” (1986) er Gabriel ■■ “Sledgehammer” by Pet (1986) Up” by Rick ■■ “Never Gonna Give You Astley (1987)\n\n■■\n\nWATCH MUSIC VIDEOS Music videos have their heyday in the 1980s.

This new art form popularizes music of all kinds, driving them to even greater heights of sales. Most kids buy their music on cassettes. While the music CD debuts in 1982, CD players cost hundreds of dollars at the time and only wind up attached to high-end audio systems for most of the 1980s.\n\nINSIDE BOULDER CITY Kids who live in Boulder City spend most of their time there. If their parents like the big city, the Kids might get hauled off to Las Vegas for shopping trips, concerts, or shows. If they like the great outdoors, they might visit the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area on the far side of Las Vegas, or they could even take a day trip to the Grand Canyon. For the most part, though, Boulder City is the landscape of the Kids’ lives.\n\n40\n\nPIERSON’S SALVAGE Billy Pierson runs this junkyard on the south side of town. It’s filled with rusty wrecks of all kinds, including cars, magnetrine freighters, and even the occasional robot. If you’re looking for spare parts for any sort of project, this is the place to be. Billy has an encyclopedic memory for everything he’s ever bought for the place, and he’s eager to sell. THE BOULDER THEATER The Boulder Theater is the center of the downtown shopping district. Built in 1933, it’s a bit rundown\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\nthese days. Since it can only show one film at a time, it can’t compete with the big cineplexes in nearby Henderson or Las Vegas, but for Kids on their own, it’s the only theater in town. THE BOULDER DAM HOTEL This sun-bleached small hotel once housed important people visiting the dam when it was being built. Citizens are mustering an effort to restore it to its former glory, but it’s a work in progress. Still, important outsiders often stay here because of its central location.\n\nBOULDER CITY AIRPORT The airport once serviced the dam project, but it’s since closed down. The Elks Club purchased the place in 1958, and turned the terminal into its clubhouse. Some kids claim the airstrip still gets used by secret government planes traveling in the dead of night, but no one has any actual proof. BOULDER BOWL This 8-lane bowling alley opened in 1947, and still feels like a throwback to that time. Kids often come here to kill some time in the air conditioning.\n\n41\n\nL\n\nA\n\nS B\n\nE\n\nY\n\nG\n\nLakeshore Rd\n\nCo\n\nL\n\nBEEH ISLAN\n\nBoulder Basin\n\nCastle Reef\n\nSENTINEL ISLAND BIG BOULDER ISLAND LITTLE BOULDER ISLAND\n\nHe\n\nme nw\n\nROCK ISLAND\n\na\n\nSeven Dry Falls\n\nH\n\nr\n\nHe me nw ay\n\na b\n\no\n\nr\n\nCooling Towers\n\nWa ll\n\ny\n\nRd ore esh Lak\n\nLake Mead Marina\n\nMAIN REACTOR\n\nlo\n\nFOXTROT GATE\n\nCo\n\nECHO GATE\n\nE\n\nK\n\nA\n\nPumping Plant Number One\n\nBoulder Beach Campground\n\nRiver Mountains\n\nA\n\nE\n\nM\n\nS\n\nBoulder Harbor Pyramid Island Southern Nevada Water System Boulder Beach\n\nDELTA GATE\n\nOUTFLUX WEST\n\nA\n\nk Roc ck nt Bla Poi\n\nSurge Tank Number Two Pumping Plant Regulating Tank Number Two Number Two\n\nNO RT H\n\nA\n\nK AC D BL LAN IS\n\nALPHA GATE\n\nN E V A D A OU TF LU X\n\nV\n\nBRA\n\nin Rd Red Mounta\n\n93\n\nD A M\n\nHoover Dam Lodge\n\nn si\n\nHemenway t Ba Pass Grea\n\nin a t n Mou\n\nDARPA FACILITY\n\nHemenway Park\n\nAC\n\nCE\n\non ny Ca\n\nL\n\ny Hw\n\nE\n\nRd\n\nn si Ba t ea Gr\n\nCol\n\nT\n\nOR\n\nor\n\nC I T Y\n\nad\n\nB O U L D E R\n\nA\n\nRed\n\nH O O V E R\n\n93 y Hw\n\nR\n\nCHAPTER O3\n\nM143-7500\n\no\n\nRi\n\n93\n\nve\n\nCHARLIE GATE\n\nCa ny on\n\nOUTFLUX SOUTH\n\nPo in t Rd\n\nBoulder City Airport\n\n42\n\nA Y Col\n\nor\n\nd e R h or kes La\n\niver o r ad\n\nD\n\nA\n\nBOULDER CITY\n\nA\n\nr e Rd\n\nL\n\nTHE LOOP\n\nS E\n\nG A\n\nLakes ho\n\nV\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\nLakeshore Rd\n\nN E V A D A\n\nS B\n\nHOOVER DAM\n\nA Y\n\nLakeshore Rd\n\nAREA MAP 93 0 1 2 3 4 5 93\n\n93\n\nkm Col\n\nor\n\nd e R h or kes La\n\nN E V A D A\n\nsi\n\nn\n\nHw y\n\niver o r ad\n\nHIVE ND\n\nA R I Z O N A\n\nService Tunnel\n\nBa\n\nHOOVER DAM 93\n\nt ea Gr\n\nHills/Mountains\n\nn\n\nsi\n\nTransport Tunnel do ora Col\n\nBa\n\nt ea Gr\n\nA R I Z O\n\nFerry Route\n\n93\n\nHw y\n\ntle Cas ove\n\n93\n\nPark/Forest\n\nA R I Z O N A\n\nBOULDER CITY\n\nCivilian Road Populated Area\n\nBOULDER CITY\n\nr ve ri\n\nr ve ri\n\ndo ora Col\n\ne 93\n\n93\n\nBuildings\n\n93\n\nRi\n\nor\n\nad\n\no\n\ne Caprn Ho\n\nve\n\nr\n\n93\n\nB O U L D E R C I T Y CA\n\nAVO GATE\n\nM\n\nNY\n\nWilbur Sq Boulder Boulder City Theatre Police Department COLOR ADO ST Boulder Bowling St Christopher's Hall Dam Hotel Church\n\nON\n\nRD\n\nBoulder Canyon 93\n\nFisher Space Pen\n\nA NEVAD\n\nHIGHW\n\nAY\n\nMitchell Elementary School\n\nBoulder City High School\n\nWhalen Baseball Field SOUTH Boulder City Boulder City Library St Andrew's GATE 5D Catholic Hospital Church ADAMS BVD\n\nBUCHANAN BLVD\n\nOasis Park\n\nBoulder City Golf Course\n\nPier's Salvage\n\ner Helicopter Sightseeing Boulder City Airport\n\n0\n\n500 1000 1500 2000 2500 m\n\n130930\n\n43\n\nCHAPTER O3 The Boulder City High School teams practice here, but anyone is welcome to the other alleys at any time. FISHER SPACE PEN The Fisher Space Pen Company moved here in 1976, and quickly became one of the biggest employers in town, making the company’s famous Silver Bullet pens, which use pressurized ink chambers so they can function in space. Rumor has it that DART is the company’s largest customer.\n\nLAKE MEAD Lake Mead is an artificial lake created by the construction of the Hoover Dam to block the Colorado River, which forms the local border between Nevada to the west and Arizona to the east. It’s the largest such reservoir in the nation when it reaches its peak capacity in 1983, although drought and water demand later in the decade cause it to shrink.\n\n44\n\nHOOVER DAM The Hoover Dam provides water and hydroelectric power to Las Vegas and all other nearby places. It was built and operated by the US Bureau of Reclamation, a division of the Department of the Interior, which is still one of the biggest employers in Boulder City. The massive concrete structure stretches over 1,200 feet across the Black Canyon, and stands over 725 feet from the top to bottom. LAKE MEAD NATIONAL RECREATIONAL AREA Lake Mead isn’t just a water reservoir; it’s also a fantastic lake upon which people boat, fish, and play. It runs from the mouth of the Grand Canyon all the way to the Hoover Dam. People from Boulder City head east on Highway 93 until they reach Lakeshore Road, from which they can reach the Las Vegas Boat Harbor, the Boulder Beach Campground, and Boulder Beach.\n\nAREA 51 In the 1950s, aliens supposedly landed in this legendary part of the Nevada Test and Training Range run by the US Air Force, although no evidence of this has ever been produced. It’s actually used to test experimental aircraft and weaponry. It sits over 80 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas, out past the Nevada Test Site, where the US military used to test atomic bombs.\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\nIt stretches four and a half miles south from Las Vegas’s actual city limits to just shy of the famous “Welcome to Las Vegas” sign, and it includes such notables as the Dunes, the Sands, the Sahara, the Stardust, and the gigantic, emerald-colored MGM Grand, at which an electrical fire kills 87 people in 1980.\n\nNUCLEAR TESTING In the 1950s, casinos in downtown Las Vegas actually advertised suites from which visitors could watch the glow from the nuclear explosions light up the night. Fortunately, the prevailing winds didn’t carry the fallout to Boulder City, and above-ground tests ended in 1963.\n\nVALLEY OF FIRE STATE PARK Just west of the northernmost tip of Lake Mead sits the Valley of Fire, so named for the red sandstone formations that jut out of the desert floor. Native Americans known as the Anasazi once lived here, and the petroglyphs they left behind can still be found on sheltered walls and inside caves.\n\nLAS VEGAS AND BEYOND A wider world awaits beyond the borders of Boulder City. Heading west on Highway 93 brings you to Henderson, Nevada, and some 14 miles beyond that lies Las Vegas. This is the largest city in Nevada, and you can see the lights from its casinos blazing through the desert sky all night long. THE STRIP The Strip is a series of world-famous casinos that sit along South Las Vegas Boulevard.\n\nTHE DART With the Hoover Dam providing a massive surplus of electricity for the region, DARPA decided in the early 1950s to begin construction of the world’s largest particle accelerator on the western edge of Lake Mead. President Eisenhower ordered the development of the Department of Advanced Research into Teleportation (DART) to oversee the project. Since the project’s actual goals were top secret, no one was allowed to reveal to the public what the organization’s acronym actually stood for. Most outsiders assumed it was the Department of Advanced Research and Technology, and no government official ever dared correct them. The smartest physicists in the nation were recruited to work there by the project’s original director, Malcolm Grayson, who often resorted to siphoning people off other government projects – at least temporarily. Most of DART’s employees live in Boulder City with their families, occupying homes formerly owned by the people who built the Hoover Dam.\n\n45\n\nCHAPTER O3\n\nThey’re all sworn to secrecy about the nature of their work, even to the point that they cannot tell their spouses or kids. The fact that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam have become tourist destinations for people visiting nearby Las Vegas causes the DART security team fits at times, but others see that as conveniently providing cover for them to indulge in their most paranoid fantasies about spies and other potential breaches. DART’s current director, Dr. Alma Madeira, hasn’t shown any impulse to restrain them so far.\n\nTHE US LOOP The DART Loop is gigantic, although at nearly 15 miles across, it’s still smaller than the Loop in Sweden. It runs deep underneath all of Boulder City, encompassing a large chunk of the municipality within its circumference. Most of Boulder City’s residents live within the DART Loop, and don’t even realize it. No one is allowed into any DART facilities without the proper credentials being presented at the main offices, which are located in a high-fenced compound that sits next to the golf course on the outskirts of town. Dogs and guards patrol the compound’s perimeter, which is lined with motion detectors and concertina wire. Some people have noticed a number of Swedish scientists are regularly roaming in and out of town, staying at local hotels. This is supposedly part of an exchange program set up with similar particle accelerators around the world – even though it’s rare to see any visitors from a nation other than Sweden. No Kids are allowed inside the DART Loop, not even on Take Your Kid to Work Day. There are a dozen or so maintenance shafts that lead down to the Loop at various points around the city though, and these aren’t quite so obviously guarded. With the right tools, someone might be able to sneak down into the tunnels beneath the city, and maybe even get into the main headquarters before they were detected. If anyone’s managed this so far, though, they haven’t announced what they've found. Anytime someone disappears from town without warning, however, the rumors that they were caught somewhere they weren’t supposed to be – and then swept away to a secret federal prison – start flying.\n\n46\n\nTHE US LOOP\n\n47\n\nO4 CHAPTER\n\nTYPES 49 BOOKWORM 50 COMPUTER GEEK\n\n51\n\nHICK 52 JOCK 53 POPULAR KID\n\n54\n\nROCKER\n\n55\n\nTROUBLEMAKER 56 WEIRDO 57\n\nAGE 58 ATTRIBUTES 58 LUCK POINTS\n\n58\n\nSKILLS 58 ITEMS 59 PROBLEM 59 DRIVE 60 PRIDE 60 RELATIONSHIPS 60 ANCHOR 61 CONDITIONS 62 EXPERIENCE 62 NAME 62 DESCRIPTION 62 FAVORITE SONG\n\n62\n\nHIDEOUT 63 QUESTIONS 63\n\nTHE KIDS\n\nThe echo sphere lay there in the gravel pit. A faint tune hummed from within the sphere when the wind resonated between the steel walls. Kalle and Olof immediately ran inside and started shouting to test the echo. A pair of nervous ospreys wheeled above the sphere. I remained outside, reminded of that first day there with my grandfather. Thinking back on it now I realize that this is probably my first memory of experiencing nostalgia. Odd; a summer’s day and three nine-year-olds, one of whom was stopped in the middle of playing by a childhood memory.\n\nEach player creates a Kid. The process is shown stepby-step and then explained more thoroughly. There are four pre-made Kids at the end of this book. These can be used to start playing immediately, without having to create characters for the game. 1. Choose your Type. 2. Decide your age, from 10 to 15 years. 3. Distribute a number of points equal to your age in the four attributes, 1 to 5 points in each. 4. Determine your number of Luck Points, equal to 15 minus your age. 5. Distribute 10 points in skills. You may take up to level 3 in the three key skills of your Type. For other skills, a starting skill level of 1 is the maximum. 6. Pick an Iconic Item. 7. Pick a Problem. 8. Pick a Drive.\n\n9. Pick a Pride. 10. Define your Relationships to the other Kids and to the NPCs. 11. Select an Anchor. 12. Name your Kid. 13. Write a short description. 14. Choose your favorite song. DO THIS TOGETHER: 15. Define the group’s Hideout. 16. Answer the Gamemaster’s questions.\n\nTYPES Choose which Type your Kid is. There should preferably only be one Kid of each Type in the group.\n\n49\n\nCHAPTER O4\n\nBOOKWORM When you read, you travel thousands of miles to foreign countries.
