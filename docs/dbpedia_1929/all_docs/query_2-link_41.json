        "text": "Various coastal structures can be used to solve, or at least, to reduce coastal erosion problems. Some of them can provide direct protection, like breakwaters, seawalls and dikes, and others, such as detached breakwaters and artificial reefs, provide indirect protection, reducing the hydraulic load on the coast to the level required to maintain the dynamic equilibrium of the shoreline. To achieve this objective, these structures are designed to allow the transmission of a certain amount of wave energy over the structure by overtopping (and also some transmission through the porous structure, in some types of breakwaters), and/or wave breaking and energy dissipation on a shallow crest (submerged structures). Rock walls, breakwaters or groynes usually serve the purpose of protecting land from erosion and/or enabling safe navigation into harbours and marinas, but other commercial value and multi-purpose recreational and amenity enhancement objectives can also be incorporated into coast...\n\nTerms such as &#39;nature-based&#39;, &#39;living shoreline&#39;, &#39;green infrastructure&#39; and &#39;ecological engineering&#39; are increasingly being used to reflect biomimicry-based engineering measures in coastal defences. Innovative interventions for nature-based sea defences have included the retrofitting of man-made water filled depressions or &#39;vertipools&#39; to existing seawalls (Hall et al., 2019; Naylor et al., 2017) and the addition of artificial drill-cored rock pools to intertidal breakwaters (Evans et al., 2016). Through their capacity to retain water, such measures serve to enhance biodiversity in the built environment (Browne and Chapman, 2014). Evans et al. (2016) for example, experimentally demonstrated that the introduction of artificial rock pools to an intertidal granite breakwater enhanced the levels of species richness compared to those observed on plain surfaces of the breakwater. Notwithstanding these biological benefits, the impetus for incorporat...\n\nNo. Time Name Supervisor Title of thesis Chairman 1 10:00 – 10:25 Hossain MD.
