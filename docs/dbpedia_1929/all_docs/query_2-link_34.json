        "text": "A music label is a company that helps artists record and distribute their music to a wider audience. A label typically offers services such as financing for recording and production, marketing and promotion, and distribution of the artist's music. The label also helps the artist navigate legal and business issues related to their music, such as copyright and licensing agreements. In exchange for these services, the label takes a percentage of the artist's earnings from music sales and other revenue streams. Overall, a label can provide valuable resources and support for artists looking to make a name for themselves in the music industry."
