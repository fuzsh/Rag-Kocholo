        "text": "Basketball: USA win women's gold!\n\nThey were pushed to their very limits, but the USA's incredible gold medal-winning streak continues.\n\nAn incredibly tight contest came down to the final minute of play. where the USA simply executed on the offensive end, and France didn't.\n\nWith roughly 30 seconds to go France had the chance to cut the USA's lead to 1 or even tie with a three, but an ill-advised shot from Marine Fauthoux was blocked by Breanna Stewart. It then became a free-throw game, with France now having to foul to stop the clock and hope that the USA would miss.\n\nBut despite the cauldron of noise coming their way, the USA came up clutch at the line to extend their lead.\n\nA three-pointer by Gabby Williams brought France within 1 with 3.8 seconds left, but more free throws from Kahleah Copper gave the USA a three-point lead.\n\nIncredibly, Williams hit another shot as time expired that sent the audience into raptures as they thought she had tied the game - but she was just inside the three-point line, meaning the USA win 67-66 in a game for the ages.\n\nThe French fans inside Bercy Arena were stunned - but only for a moment as the realisation of what their team had achieved in pushing the giants of women's basketball right to the brink began to sink in.\n\nThe crowd stood as one to applaud both sets of players, with especially loud cheers for Les Bleus who were, understandably, emotional at the final buzzer.\n\nWilliams was incredible for France, scoring 19 points to go along with 7 rebounds and 3 steals. A'ja Wilson was unstoppable for the USA, scoring 21 points, grabbing 13 rebounds and blocking four shots.\n\nThe USA win their 10th gold medal and eighth in a row, with Diana Taurasi (who didn't play in the final) earning a sixth gold medal - a record for an athlete at the Games in any team sport.\n\nSilver goes to France, who finish on the podium for a second consecutive Games following the bronze they won at Tokyo 2020. Australia take the bronze after beating Belgium in the day's earlier game.\n\nðŸ¥‡USA\n\nðŸ¥ˆFrance\n\nðŸ¥‰Australia\n\nTrack cycling: Jennifer Valente wins women's omnium again\n\nEverything has changed in the standings and we're coming up to the end of the race â€“ the double points sprint!\n\nValente is clear for gold but silver and bronze have changed. Poland's Daria Pikulik sits in second and New Zealand's Ally Wollaston third on the live interim standings.\n\nBelgium's Lotte Kopecky, an established road racer too, is in fourth.\n\nBut Pikulik and Wollaston pick up points and guarantee their podium spots!\n\nGold to Jennifer Valente (USA), who successfully retains her Olympic title! She finishes on 144 points.\n\nDaria Pikulik (POL) takes silver on 131, having gained two laps on the field in this race and moved up from eighth overall.\n\nAnd Ally Wollaston (NZL) takes bronze, also gaining two laps to move up from seventh to third on 125 points.\n\nValente goes to hug her family by trackside. Pikulik breaks down in tears as she's hugged by the Polish support staff.\n\nTrack cycling: Valente wins omnium elimination race to extend lead\n\nThe favourites have all stayed out of trouble in this women's omnium elimination race so far.\n\nThere was an earlier error from the race commisaires eliminating Poland's Daria Pikulik, but it was corrected and the race yellow flagged to let her chase back to the pack. She is finally eliminated in 10th place.\n\nFourth overall after the tempo race, Denmark's Amalie Dideriksen is eliminated in eighth â€“ that will drop her down the rankings quite a bit.\n\nWe're now down to four riders. Can Belgium's Lotte Kopecky do herself a big favour in the overall standings with a strong finish?\n\nShe's joined by the overall top three: Valente, Baker, and Maggie Coles-Lyster of Canada. And it is Kopecky who gets called.\n\nIt means our top three overall are also the last three in this race, and they will stay in the medal positions.\n\nColes-Lyster goes in third, meaning we're down to one final sprint for the lineâ€¦ and Jennifer Valente wins the race!\n\nThe Olympic champion extends her overall lead to 10 full points.\n\nModern pentathlon: Michelle Gulyas wins women's gold with new world record score\n\nClouvel has struggled on the laser range â€“ needing 14 shots to get her five green lights on her first visit â€“ and the Frenchwoman's dropped back to second, just barely keeping ahead of Republic of Korea's Seong Seungmin.\n\nHungary's Michelle Gulyas is clear at the front after some strong laser shooting.\n\nUp they come to the range for the final time. Gulyas is in the lead, and she is in and out in no time at all!\n\nFinally Clouvel gets a good visit to the range and she is going to be on her heels for the last 600m lap.\n\nGulyas, arms outstretched, celebrates as she comes home for gold! Clouvel celebrates too as she wins silver on home soil, her second silver adding to Rio 2016! And Seong comes home for bronze!\n\nThe crowd go wild for Clouvel.\n\nThat is a new overall score world record for Gulyas! 1461 points, breaking Alice Sotero's 1443."
