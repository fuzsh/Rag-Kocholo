Firstly, I have to say, whoever wrote the theme song, Radio America, has written one of the songs that you cannot get out of your head for days and weeks!!! Arghhh!!!

The film itself is very endearing. As a musician myself, I have found that this story of an up and coming band navigating the world of the music industry to be very true - to -life. The characters and the drama were handled masterfully by Christopher Showerman, who directs with ease and comfort of a seasoned director.

This film gets better with multiple viewings because the songs and characters get under your skin in a good way.

I want more!!!
