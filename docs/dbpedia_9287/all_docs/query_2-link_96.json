        "text": "Across all demographics, Nielsen demonstrates that radio is still the most popular form of media in America. Radio reaches 90% of adults aged 18-34, 94% aged 35-49 and 91% aged 50 and older. That being said, here are our thoughts on why radio is still popular today...\n\n4 Reasons Why Radio Radio is Still Popular\n\n4. Radio is Portable\n\nNielsen state radio has a legacy as THE audio medium audiences are used to. Itâ€™s also easily accessible to anyone, as most, if not all, cars come equipped with radios.\n\nNielsenâ€™s data shows that 69% of weekly radio consumption is done outside of the home, primarily in cars and at work. Audience numbers spike from 6/7am through to 5pm, the average work day. On weekends numbers are at their highest around mid-day, when people are out or shopping. Radio is the companion you take with you on your daily commutes, that helps you get through long days at the office and makes your chores just a little more bearable.\n\nThis makes radio very advertiser-friendly. In modern times when people favour subscription services where they wonâ€™t encounter advertisements, radio is the medium that will not only allow advertisers to reach large audiences but target them when theyâ€™re out and closest to retailers.\n\n3. Radio is Free\n\nRadio doesn't require any form of monthly subscription, due to being advertiser-funded, unlike many current media services.\n\n[Radio is] accessible anywhere and to everyone online.\n\nEven podcasts are often on subscription sites such as Spotify, making radio a free alternative when most other services are becoming increasingly costly. Take Soho Radio, accessible anywhere and to everyone online via radio directories and on their site through their player.\n\n2. Radio is Adaptable\n\nRadio adapts with changing technologies and consumer trends. Radio is now accessible through laptops, computers, phones and even smart speakers, so you can listen to your favourite station whenever you want, however you want.\n\nRadio doesnâ€™t need you to set time aside the way TV does, as it asks less of its audience, being an audio-only medium. TV requires the full attention of its audience due to audio and visual elements, people can take the radio with them anywhere without missing out on half of the experience.\n\n1. Radio is Inclusive\n\nNielsenâ€™s findings show the appeal of radio across demographics, drawing large listener numbers across all ages, genders and ethnicities. Radio attracts 99% of Hispanic Americans, 98% of African Americans, 98% of women aged 25-54 and 93% of teenagers aged 12-17. Radio has a diverse variety of stations able to appeal to all audience tastes.\n\nMany podcasts aim for limited audiences, covering niche topics. Plus, podcasts arenâ€™t that easy to discover. Listeners usually have to go out of their way to find them. Radio has an established, easily digestible format that aims for larger audiences by promoting generalised content presented by regular DJs. Radio has no long-form narratives or story arcs, audiences can jump in and out without missing anything.\n\nMake radio, not war.\n\nRadio presenters play a large part in drawing people, as they often become like friends to regular listeners, some of whom tune in every day just to hear them. This makes radio a less demanding medium to get into than podcasts, which often require listeners to go back and familiarise themselves with older content, a problem radio does not have.\n\nAs itâ€™s all about reaching a broad audience, unsurprisingly, stations which focus on whatâ€™s popular have the most success. Nielsenâ€™s data supports this; the most popular stations amongst people ranging 12-54 are country music stations, which hold a 13.2% share of Americaâ€™s total time spent listening.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nHow we consume our favourite content has changed, but Nielsenâ€™s research demonstrates radio still has a firm hold on the market in the digital age.
