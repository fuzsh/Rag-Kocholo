        "text": "Collected commentary on the value of radio. Radio is \"virtually useless,\" \"just another disintegrating toy.\" Radio is \"a Tremendous Contribution,\" \"the only means of instantaneous communication yet devised by man.\" Radio \"will elect the next president\"; its listeners comprise \"an organization that in days to come will be the most powerful in the world.\" However one judged radio as it grew from a \"helpless youngster\" into a \"husky adolescence,\" one thing was clear—\"There it is, up in the air, absolutely free, waiting for you to pull it down with the aid of electricity.\" The vast array of opinion on radio's value and future is apparent in this excerpted commentary of the time. To what extent does the commentary resemble 21st-century discussion about the value and future of the Internet, social networking, mobile devices, etc.? Selections can be divided among students for research and classroom discussion. (8 pp.)\n\nThe WLS Showboat—the \"Floating Palace of Wonder,\" AUDIO CLIP (21 min.). TRANSCRIPT. The earliest entertainment shows in commercial broadcasting were not the soap operas, serial dramas, and comedy shows often characterized as \"early radio\"—those arrived in the 1930s. Twenties radio offered listeners the same fare they could hear in theaters—opera, orchestral performances, vaudeville routines, musical revues, etc., and could read in newspapers—news, weather, stock market closing prices, farm updates, home management advice, etc., adding such features as bedtime stories for children. WLS Chicago, created in 1924 by Sears Roebuck & Co. to increase its outreach to midwestern farmers, offered a weekly variety program, the WLS Showboat, the \"Floating Palace of Wonder.\" Listeners would \"travel\" along American rivers on the Showboat and enjoy songs and humorous banter not unlike vaudeville [music hall song-and-dance acts]. This undated broadcast is archived by the Library of American Broadcasting at the University of Maryland. Listen to the audio clip while reading the transcript. What characterized 1920s radio entertainment? How did it set the stage, so to speak, for later radio and television entertainment? (Audio clip online; transcript, 10 pp.)"
