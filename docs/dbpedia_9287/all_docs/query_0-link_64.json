        "text": "This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here.\n\nDan Foster had a big voice, a love of giving away gifts and a light touch with a story. And when he arrived in Nigeria to work in radio in 2000, he found a public that was ready for him.\n\nThe country’s airwaves had only recently emerged from state control, and Mr. Foster’s mix of plain talk, folksy humor and American swagger — calling himself the Big Dawg or the Top Dawg — made him a new kind of morning radio host, one of the most popular in the country.\n\n“It was the first time in Nigeria we had someone who sounded different from us, who brought that American flavor, brought stories and just changed the way everybody saw radio,” said Osikhena Dirisu, a morning host at The Beat, a station in the main city, Lagos.\n\nThe Big Dawg parlayed his celebrity into roles in movies and on reality television, as a judge on “Idols West Africa” and “Nigeria’s Got Talent.” He also promoted concerts. The Nigerian website Pulse called him “the God of radio,” waxing, “There are two eras of radio in Nigeria. Before and after Dan Foster.”\n\nMr. Foster died on June 17 at a hospital in Lagos a day after receiving a positive test result for the coronavirus, his wife, Lovina Okpara, told Nigerian media. He was 61.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
