        "text": "Rap and hip hop are the most popular musical genres in the United States, consuming almost a third of all streams, claims Billboard.\n\nThough rap is steadily gaining popularity, the best rap radio stations are difficult to find (amid the sea of ​​pop and \"butt-rock\" that the radio is most frequently associated with). We've put together this comprehensive list of our favorite rap radio stations for your convenience, complete with a rundown of what they play and when they play it.\n\n1. Streetz 94.5 FM, the Local FM and Online station for Hip-Hop fans\n\nStreetz 94.5, the latest hip-hop station in Atlanta, may not be the biggest mainstream radio station in Georgia, but it is definitely one of the best. It is best known for featuring the city's native hip hop and rap artists while broadcasting urban contemporary.\n\nWith all the recent rap talent coming out of Atlanta, Streetz 94.5 is a great place to find new rappers. Additionally, you can access the most recent news, keep up with nearby events, and listen to the entertaining morning show.\n\n2. Hot 97, the Local and Online station for Hip-Hop and Urban Contemporary fans\n\nOne of the hottest spots for all things hip-hop is Hot 97.

On its website, music is streamed live around the clock. You can also download the Hot 97 app to your smartphone and listen to the radio station there.\n\nHot 97 is big enough to have exceptional brands and programs that can't be found anywhere else but small enough to be nimble in serving their listeners. It's a safe bet that they are correct, given the fact that their presence spans Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and several radio software programs.\n\n3. Power 106, the Local and Online station for Hip-Hop and Urban Contemporary fans\n\nMeruelo Media, the media company that owns Power 106, was founded in 1986 and proudly asserts that it is the largest minority-owned media company in Southern California.\n\nPower 106, widely regarded as the first rhythmic contemporary radio station, is the go-to place for everything hip hop in LA. By excluding rock from its playlists, the station is in fact, to blame for the name \"rhythmic contemporary.\"\n\n\"Wh ere Hip-Hop Lives\" is the station's tagline, and judging by the videos they have of their DJs addressing Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, and a host of other big names, they aren't exaggerating.\n\n4.
