        "text": "America, the iconic multi-platinum-selling group, will perform at The Chicago Theatre on Friday, July 19 as part of their Ride On tour. Al Stewart, best known for his hits “Year of the Cat” and “Time Passages,” will be the evening’s special guest.\n\nAmerica’s best-known tunes, which include “A Horse with No Name,” “Sandman” “I Need You,” “Ventura Highway,” “Don't Cross The River,” “Tin Man,” “Lonely People,” “Sister Golden Hair” and “You Can Do Magic,” were cornerstones of 1970s & 80s Top 40 and FM rock radio. America's six certified gold or platinum albums displayed the full range of the trio’s talents. The trio won the GRAMMY for “Best New Artist” in 1972 and began working with George Martin and Geoff Emerick in 1974. This successful team went on to record seven albums and several top ten hits. Their growth as singers, songwriters, and musicians has continued into the present day with landmark releases including 2000’s three-disc box set, “Highway;” 2002’s “Holiday Harmony;” 2007’s “Here & Now;” 2009’s “Live In Concert: Wildwood Springs;” 2011’s “Back Pages;” and 2015’s “Lost And Found and America: Archives Vol. 1.” In 2020, the band released their ultimate eight-disc anniversary box set “Half Century,” streamed their concert special “America - Live at the London Palladium,” and released their book “America, the Band, An Authorized Biography” by Jude Warne. America’s recordings have been licensed for a multitude of placements in films including “American Hustle,” “The Nice Guys,” “The Last Unicorn,” and “Girl Most Likely;” television shows including “The Sopranos,” “Friends,” “Breaking Bad,” and “Saturday Night Live;” and video games including “Grand Theft Auto.”"
