Hollywood Studios Golden Era Fox Films Corportation Loew’s Incorporated Paramount Picutres RKO Radio Pictures Warner Brothers Universal Pictures Columbia Pictures United Artists Today Warner Brothers Paramount Picutres 20th Century Fox Walt Disney Pictures Columbia Pictures Universal Pictures\n\n3. Company Origins The Walt Disney Company began in 1923, in a small office in Vermont, where Walt Disney and his brother Roy created short animated movies. After just 4 months, the company was growing rapidly, so they moved from their $10 a month office to a large space next door which was called ‘Disney Bros. Studio.’ A year later, they had upgraded again to a lot in the Silver Lake District in LA, which they called the Hyperion Studio, where a new studio was constructed. It was here that the famous Mickey Mouse was born. After production of the first full length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Walt Disney decided he needed to increase the size of his studio. So with the profits of the film, he put a deposit on a 51 acre lot in Burbank, and began designing a studio which would fit his needs. His main concern was to produce a self-sufficient, state-of-the-art production factory that provided all the essential facilities for the entire production process. Walt designed the Animation Building, housing the Disney Artists and animators, which was planned in the center of the lot. Across a small street were built the Inking and Painting and the Camera buildings, where the artwork was completed and photographed. Next to Camera, in the Cutting building, the post production process occurred. Sound facilities included dubbing, scoring, effects, and voice recording studios. Many of the buildings were linked together by an underground tunnel, so even in bad weather, the process of making animated films was not disrupted. To enhance the campus-like setting, all of the utilities were placed underground which was an innovation for 1940. From then on the Disney Company expanded. In the late 1940’s Disney began creating live-action features and TV programmes, meaning the studios were expanded further.\n\n4. Key Personnel Walt Disney - Founder John E.

Aims & Ideologies Walt Disney Pictures has the objective of becoming one of the worlds leading producers and providers of entertainment for all the family. They also aim to focus on the future, and produce films for the ‘time.’ Therefore, their films and techniques of production are modernising over time, resulting in films that are more and more successful. ‘You're dead if you aim only for kids. Adults are only kids grown up, anyway.’ Walt Disney ‘Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive.’ Walt Disney Walt aims to produce films that recreate historical and important events, sometimes with animals, that aren’t ‘too childish’ but that also add in some adult satire to make the films for the whole family. This way, children don’t understand the sarcasm but are learning about historic events of watching wonderful stories, whilst the parents are still enjoying the film in a different way.\n\n6. Size & Resources The Walt Disney Studios are a huge, all designed by Walt Disney, and still used to this day. The studios include all the original features and buildings, as well as the following to help with the production of films. SOUND STAGES: - Live action sound stages were created for the filming of interior scenes. Stage 1 was created in the original 1940 studio, and used for filming live action scenes for films such as Fantasia, and the TV show, The Mickey Mouse Club. Stage 2 is one of the largest sound stages in LA, at around 31,000 sq ft. Stage 3 was built specifically for 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea in 1954. Stage 4 was created in 1958, but then split into two stages (Stage 4 and Stage 5) in 1988. These stages were used in the production of the following – Mary Poppins, Davy Crockett, The Love Bug, Blackbeard's Ghost, Bedknobs and Broomsticks etc. RIVERSIDE LOT: - Walt had plans to create Mickey Mouse Park opposite the studios where there would be a train ride and statues of the characters. This is where the Feature Animation Building and The ABC Building now stand. With his growing ideas, he realised he needed more room to fulfil his dreams, so he bought 200 acres of orange groves in Anaheim, California, which is now the sight of Disneyland. SHOPS: - Walt created ‘back-lot’ shops that housed the many crafts and services required to produce his films. The Machine Shop – camera and production objects along with cars/trams for Disneyland, Electric/Plumbing Building – repairing and maintenance, Staff Shop – plaster casts, fibreglass figures, Special Effects Shop – flying cars, spaceships, The Paint Shop – spraying cars and sets, Sign Graphics, Craft Services and The Mill. BACK LOT: - This included exterior sets such as ‘Town Square’ and ‘Residential Street’ produced for production. However as ‘on location’ filming became more popular, the back lot sets were gradually replaced with offices, production buildings, parking and Stages 6&7. GOLD OAK RANCH: - This 500 acre area was purchased in 1959 for use of it’s natural settings which have been used in The Parent Trap, Pirates of the Caribbean 2, Pearl Harbour etc. This ranch included feature such as a bridge over a lake, farm houses, barns, fields, country roads, forests, a running waterfall and much more.\n\n7. Filmography Financing Disney Pictures is owned by The Walt Disney Company, the largest media conglomerate in the world in terms of revenue. This company owns television channels, publishing's, 14 theme parks, merchandising as well as the Disney Pictures. Therefore, Disney Pictures is funded by The Walt Disney Company. Production In terms of production, Disney Pictures do a lot of this themselves. The Walt Disney Company own one of the largest and well known studios in Hollywood, where a huge number of their films are produced and edited. This was created by Walt Disney himself in 1924. Distribution Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is the Disney distribution company owned by Disney Enterprises. From 1929 – 1932, Walt Disneys productions were distributed by Columbia Pictures, between 1932 – 1937 distributed by United Artists, and 1937 – 1954 by RKO Radio Pictures. However, after a disbute with RKO Radio Pictures, Walt and his brother Roy formed their own distribution company – Buena Vista Distribution Company Inc to handle the U.S distribution of their own productions. Buena Vista International was formed in 1992 after Disney ended a joint venture with Warner Brothers. Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture distributes all features produced by the following: - • Walt Disney Pictures – Walt Disney Animation Studios – Pixar Animation Studios – DisneyToon Studios • Disneynature • Marvel Studios • Touchstone Pictures – Dreamworks Pictures • Hollywood Pictures • ESPN Films\n\n8. Key Texts\n\n9. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an animated film about a princess who ends up living in the forest with seven dwarfs. It is the tale of her life with them and how she meets her prince charming. It is a simple fairytale, yet it is one you could watch 1000 times without getting bored. As one of Disney’s oldest films, the attention to detail in the animation is incredible. It shows just how much care and love went into the production of the film. Personally, this is one of my favourite Disney films; one of their classics. Release Date : - February 4th Cast: - Adriana Caselotti 1938 Lucille La Verne Director: - David Hand Harry Stockwell Producer: - Walt Disney Pinto Colvig Roy Atwell Writer: - Ted Sears Target Audience: - Primarily children, mainly Budget: - $1,488,423 girls who admire princesses/want to Box Office: - $184,925,486 become princesses – imaginative. Age Genre: - Fantasy/Fairytale between 5-12. Animation\n\n10. Mary Poppins is the story of two children, Jane and Michael, who are in need of a new nanny, who ends up being Mary Poppins. She isn’t an ordinary nanny, she takes them on strange adventures where they have tea parties on the ceilings, dance with cartoon animals and sing ‘Supercalafrajalisticexpealadotious,’ while still following their fathers instructions and being firm. This is a timeless Disney film, and for something made in the 60’s, an extraordinary production. With animation, the illusion of flying, this is shows the beginning of a new era of film. It is definitely worth the watch, and will have you whistling for days. Release Date : - August 27, 1964 Cast: - Julie Andrews Director: - Robert Stevenson Dick Van Dyke Producer: - Walt Disney David Tomlinson Glynis Johns Writer: - Billy Walsh Karen Dotrice Budget: - $6 million Matthew Garber Box Office: - $102,272,727 Target Audience: - familes, specifically Genre: - Musical young girls 7-12. Fun, outgoing, like singing, fantasy loving.\n\n11. Finding Nemo is one of the best Disney animation films so far in my personal opinion. From the comedy throughout, to the gripping storyline of a father’s aim to reunite with his son, Finding Nemo will have you both laughing and crying. You’ll discover what life is really like under the sea, and how fish can be as stupid as some humans; Dory, the fish who thinks she can sing like a whale. When Nemo and his dad are torn apart, the film follows the obstacles Marlin has to overcome in order to reach his son who has ended up thousands of miles away. When all hope is lost, is there still light at the end of the tunnel for Nemo? Or is it too late? This film had me gripped to the edge of my seat from beginning to end, something that is unusual for an animated Disney film, yet with the cute animations and heart warming, it’s hard not to relate to this fantastic film. Release Date : - Cast: - Albert Brooks Director: - Andrew Stanton Ellen DeGeneres Producer: - Graham Walters Alexander Gould Writer: - Andrew Stanton Target Audience: - family film, specifically young children, 7-12. Adventurous, Budget: - $94 million outgoing, like exploring. Box Office: - $867,893,978 Genre: - Animated Comedy - Drama"
