        "text": "Some of this may sound like \"Drunk Uncle\" from Saturday Night Live because I know the big picture but am not going to sources to double check details:\n\nI am surprised no-one has mentioned Mary Poppins. Again, as with Snow White, Walt Disney took a big gamble on the film and it paid off handsomely. MaPo (sp?) was the engineering company formed to design the attractions for Disneyland and was the predecessor to Walt Disney Imagineering. Without Mary Poppins, much of what brings us to these forums would not exist. Mary Poppins was the cash cow for much of the 1950s expansion of the company.\n\nSimilarly, how many people know how bad a shape the film division of Walt Disney Pictures was in by the mid 1980s? Walt Disney's son in law Ron Miller had been given the reins to keep the company going after Walt's death and in an attempt to maintain the family image, the company put out films that were family friendly but didn't make any money. By 1984, the company was on the cusp of being acquired, chopped up and sold to the highest bidder. Roy Disney Jr (the nephew) formed a company to bring change to save the company and his efforts led to the hiring of Michael Eisner and Frank Wells, and the company was able to fend off a hostile takeover bid from corporate raider Saul Steinberg. The film division formed Touchstone pictures and its first movie to gross $100,000,000 (big money in the 1980s) was - no, not Splash (this was before that):\n\nDown and Out in Beverly Hills - starring Bette Midler and Nick Nolte. That may have been a film that saved the Walt Disney Company.\n\nWhat really kept the company afloat during the late 40s was the package films. Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, Fun & Fancy Free, Melody Time, and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad were all released from 1943-1949. They all combined multiple narratives into a single, long feature in order to keep money flowing to the studio. Disney did this because it was deemed too expensive to produce single narrative features while most of the animation staff was busy being drafted or working on propaganda cartoons.\n\nThese movies didn't really generate much revenue. They didn't run losses, but they were not big hits either. The studio was more half-sunk than afloat in the immediate post-war years.\n\nI always thought in the 1980's and 1990's it was the Little Mermaid that saved the Disney and the whole entire movie animation department.\n\nBesides Black Cauldron, Disney didn't really have a hard time producing animated money makers. Oliver and Company, released 1 year before Mermaid, was a hit in its own right. Mermaid et al propelled animation back to blockbuster status, but Disney wasn't struggling to make money there either. Animation was kicked off the Disney lot because the live action (Touchstone) movies were generating more revenue and it was deemed more important for a time. Eisner did think of dropping animation because he thought it would save production costs and the re-issue market (then still a cash cow for the company) had enough titels to sustain itself, but it was a combination of titles that changed his mind (like Roger Rabbit, a much bigger hit than Mermaid at the time).\n\nI am surprised no-one has mentioned Mary Poppins. Again, as with Snow White, Walt Disney took a big gamble on the film and it paid off handsomely. MaPo (sp?) was the engineering company formed to design the attractions for Disneyland and was the predecessor to Walt Disney Imagineering. Without Mary Poppins, much of what brings us to these forums would not exist. Mary Poppins was the cash cow for much of the 1950s expansion of the company.\n\nBy the time Mary Poppins was released, the company was well established and at the peak of its success during Walt's life. Mary was confirmation of that (in a big way), but Disney had plenty of other hits during that era like Swiss Family Robinson and The Parent Trap. I don't think \"saving the company\" is the right term for it.\n\nSimilarly, how many people know how bad a shape the film division of Walt Disney Pictures was in by the mid 1980s? Walt Disney's son in law Ron Miller had been given the reins to keep the company going after Walt's death and in an attempt to maintain the family image, the company put out films that were family friendly but didn't make any money.

That may have been a film that saved the Walt Disney Company.\n\nI was about to bring up Touchstone, so this is the point I agree with the most.\n\nIt should be noted though that Ron Miller tried to release atypical Disney features in the early 80s (Tex, Never Cry Wolf, The Watcher in the Woods) but they were not money makers. They also helped to influce the creation of Touchstone, by showing that Disney needed some other label to expand they kind of movies they needed to produce. It (and The Disney Channel) was the right idea, but it came too late to save his position in the company."
