        "text": "When I watched Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny I was surprised to see the Disney Logo with the Cinderella castle at the beginning of the opening credits, as none of the Disney-released Star Wars movies — which are also from Lucasfilm — used the Disney Logo. Acquired animated movies like Spies in Disguise didn't use the Disney logo. None of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies released by Disney use the Disney logo. Avatar: The Way of Water was released as a 20th Century Studios film. But Disney uses its logo for every Pixar film.\n\nSo what is the deciding factor? Is it contractual obligations made before the Disney acquistions? Or is a branding thing, where Disney feels some properties would benefit from the association with Disney (Pixar, Indiana Jones) and feels other properties would be weakened by association with Disney (Star Wars, Avatar, Marvel, etc.)\n\nI was just mildly curious and couldn't find the answer anywhere else.\n\nWhen Disney bought Lucasfilm Paramount still held the distribution rights to Indiana Jones movies.\n\nDisney made a deal to take over distribution, with Paramount still getting their financial cut per the original agreement.\n\nI'm assuming part of that agreement included the provision that Paramount still got their logo in front of the movie.\n\nIf that were not the case, it might have just been the Lucasfilm logo. Since the Paramount logo was there it would make sense that Disney would also want their logo included.\n\nWhen Disney bought Lucasfilm Paramount still held the distribution rights to Indiana Jones movies.\n\nDisney made a deal to take over distribution, with Paramount still getting their financial cut per the original agreement.\n\nI'm assuming part of that agreement included the provision that Paramount still got their logo in front of the movie.\n\nIf that were not the case, it might have just been the Lucasfilm logo.

A win for Paramount because they get money for doing nothing with zero effort.\n\nSame thing happened when Disney bought Marvel."
