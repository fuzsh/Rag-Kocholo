        "text": "The big news today is that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has just announced the Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Ultra HD release of Disney and Pixar’s Inside Out 2 (2024) on 9/10. The Digital release is expected on 8/20.\n\nExtras will include a pair of behind-the-scenes featurettes (including New Emotions and Unlocking the Vault) along with 5 deleted scenes (among them Cold Open, Broken Joy, Pool Party, Puberty Prank, and Shame Spiral).\n\nThe 4K will be released as a Limited Edition 4K + Blu-ray Steelbook.
