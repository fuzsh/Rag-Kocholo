Among them is a fork who insists he's not a toy.\n\nWhy we're interested: After multiple delays and the departure of the film's director from the studio, we're wondering if the \"Toy Story 4\" we'll see this summer is the same one the former Disney Animation and Pixar chief creative officer, John Lasseter, originally had in mind. The sequel will introduce several new characters, including a talking fork, but we're holding out hope to see the return of a fan-favorite.\n\nIn 2015, Lasseter originally said the story was inspired by his wife and that the movie would be a love story between Woody his former flame, Bo Peep. Tim Allen, who voices Buzz Lightyear, said the film is so emotional that he had a tough time getting through the final scene.

We have a lot of faith in director Jon Favreau who brought the live-action version of \"The Jungle Book\" to the big screen. That movie earned nearly $1 billion at theaters.\n\nIf the trailer didn't hit you right in the feels, the star-studded cast of Beyoncé, Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and Chiwetel Ejiofor should get you excited. Plus, James Earl Jones is reprising his role as Mufasa. Get ready to cry all over again.\n\nWatch the teaser trailer here.\n\nRead more: See the cast behind Disney's new \"Lion King\" movie\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\"\n\nRelease date: Friday, July 12\n\nStudio: Fox\n\nWhat it's about: The movie is supposed to be based on the New York Times' bestseller from 2008 which follows a race car driver, Denny, and his dog, Enzo.

The film will also include new songs about the sisters.\n\nWhy we're interested: While the last \"Frozen\" short caused some backlash from fans, the sequel is in good hands with returning directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee and the Oscar-winning songwriting team of husband and wife Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. Disney must feel confident about the sequel as it moved its release date up one week.\n\nWatch the teaser trailer for the movie here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n18. \"Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker\"\n\nRelease date: Friday, December 20\n\nStudio: Lucasfilm\n\nWhat it's about: \"The Rise of Skywalker\" will serve as a culmination of the Skywalker storyline and will include more of Carrie Fisher's General Leia through previously unused footage.\n\nWhy you should see it: Say what you will about mixed reviews of \"The Last Jedi,\" but if you've invested years watching the \"Star Wars\" saga, don't you want to see how it all ends for Kylo Ren and Rey? Maybe we'll even learn who Rey's parents are — or not!\n\nIf you were a fan of \"The Force Awakens,\" director J.J. Abrams is back in the director's chair for \"The Rise of Skywalker.\" And he's not just directing. Abrams also wrote the script for the ninth film so our fingers are crossed for a satisfying conclusion to the new trilogy.\n\nWatch the first trailer for the movie here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. \"Spies in Disguise\"\n\nRelease date: Wednesday, December 25\n\nStudio: Blue Sky Studios\n\nWhat it's about: The world's greatest super spy, Lance Sterling, teams up with a gadget inventor, Walter, to save the world. The catch? Sterling is disguised as a pigeon.\n\nWhy we're intrigued: Will Smith and Tom Holland voice the two lead characters in the animated picture. Smith is playing the spy who becomes a pigeon.
