I even had the opportunity to walk the Red Carpet with Jane Goodall for the Chimpanzee World Premiere in Florida as well as attend other Disney movie screenings. When it comes to movies, I am a big Disney fan! I will NEVER be too old to watch any of the new Disney animated films or the classics. I LOVED watching Brave, Wreck It Ralph and the Secret World Of Arriety at the theater with my youngest daughter this year. I also enjoyed watching The Odd Life Of Timothy Green with two oldest daughters. Those were some of our favorite memories of 2012.\n\nI am really EXCITED for some of the movies that Disney has in it’s lineup for 2013, especially Oz The Great and Powerful.
