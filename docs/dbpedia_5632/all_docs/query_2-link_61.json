Hicks and Karin Gist have been tapped to write the script for the latest installment in the franchise and Goldberg has stated that she is involved.

According to Deadline, which broke the news, it “centers on a space hero who saved the universe 35 years ago but when he came back to Earth, no one believed his fantastic stories.
