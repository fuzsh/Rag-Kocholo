        "text": "01 of 26\n\n101 Dalmatians (1996)\n\n1996's 101 Dalmatians was one of Disney's very first live-action adaptations. A remake of the 1961 animated film, the updated version starred Glenn Close as the infamous villain, Cruella de Vil, alongside Jeff Daniels as Roger Dearly and Joely Richardson as Anita Campbell-Green-Dearly.\n\nA sequel, 102 Dalmatians, was released in November 2000, with Close reprising her role as Cruella.\n\n02 of 26\n\nAlice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nIn 2010, Mia Wasikowska played the whimsical Alice in Tim Burton's live-action adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Inspired by both the 1951 Disney animated film and Lewis Carroll's books, the film takes a slightly different approach to the story as Alice returns to Wonderland as a teenager.\n\nAlong with Wasikowska in the main role, the film featured a number of big stars, including Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen.\n\nThough it wasn't Disney's first live-action adaptation, it did inspire the trend of Walt Disney Studios remaking many of their classic animated movies. Following the release of Alice in Wonderland, a sequel titled Alice Through the Looking Glass was released in May 2016.\n\n03 of 26\n\nThe Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010)\n\n2010's The Sorcerer's Apprentice is named after a segment in Disney's 1940 film Fantasia, in which Mickey Mouse plays the young apprentice of sorcerer Yen Sid (who Nicholas Cage's character is based on). Though the film does feature one big reference to Fantasia, it takes many other liberties with the story and isn't defined as a direct remake.\n\n04 of 26\n\nMaleficent (2014)\n\nStarring Angelina Jolie as the Disney villain from 1959's Sleeping Beauty, the film is a live-action retelling of the story with a twist: Maleficent isn't as evil as she appears. The film features many different characters from the original, including Elle Fanning as Aurora.\n\nThe movie was a huge commercial success, eventually paving the way for a sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, which was released in 2019.\n\n05 of 26\n\nCinderella (2015)\n\n2015's Cinderella starring Lily James was the first of the live \"Disney princess\" adaptations (Disney had previously produced Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella starring Brandy and Whitney Houston, which was released as a TV movie in 1997.) The 2015 film stayed true to the original 1950 animated film right down to the magical blue dress — though chose to forgo the musical numbers.\n\n06 of 26\n\nThe Jungle Book (2016)\n\nIn 2016, Disney did a live-action/CGI adaptation of The Jungle Book, based on Rudyard Kipling's works and Disney's 1967 animated film of the same title. It marked the second live-action adaptation of the story, following 1994's The Jungle Book.\n\nAlong with Neel Sethi as Mowgli, the film featured a star-studded voice cast for the CGI animals, including Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Scarlett Johansson as Kaa and many more.\n\nA sequel was announced in 2016 with Jon Favreau attached to direct, however, further details have not been released.\n\n07 of 26\n\nPete's Dragon (2016)\n\nFollowing the release of 1977's Pete's Dragon, which featured a cartoon green dragon, a remake was released in 2016. The new film reworked the musical as an adventure film starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Oakes Fegley, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, Oona Laurence and Robert Redford.\n\n08 of 26\n\nBeauty and the Beast (2017)\n\nIn 2017, Disney released a live-action remake of the 1991 animated film, Beauty and the Beast. Starring Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the Beast, the film was a faithful retelling of the original, featuring many of the iconic musical numbers.\n\nIn June 2021, Disney+ ordered a prequel series about Gaston and LeFou, with Luke Evans and Josh Gad slated to reprise their roles from the film, however, the project was indefinitely put on hold the following year.\n\n09 of 26\n\nChristopher Robin (2018)\n\n2018's Christopher Robin was a live-action adaptation of Disney's Winnie-the-Pooh franchise, which was based on A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard's children's books. The film followed a grown-up Christopher Robin, played by Ewan McGregor, with many of the animated show's voice actors lending their talents, including Jim Cummings as Winnie the Pooh and Tigger and Brad Garrett as Eeyore.\n\n10 of 26\n\nDumbo (2019)\n\nFollowing Alice in Wonderland, Disney teamed up with Tim Burton again for 2019's Dumbo, a live-action remake of the original cartoon released in 1941. The film, starring Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin, follows a circus family who discover a baby elephant with the ability to fly.\n\n11 of 26\n\nAladdin (2019)\n\nIn 2019, Disney released a live-action remake of 1992's animated film, Aladdin, starring Mena Massoud as the title character and Will Smith as the Genie. The film was a box office success, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2019.\n\nIn February 2020, Variety reported that a sequel was in the works, however, further details haven't been announced.\n\n12 of 26\n\nThe Lion King (2019)\n\nFollowing the success of The Jungle Book, Disney released a remake of 1994's The Lion King. Unlike previous adaptations, however, The Lion King wasn't entirely live-action as it used computer-animated technology to bring the animals to life. The film featured many songs from the original, which were sung by a star-studded cast, including Donald Glover as Simba and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala.\n\nA prequel, titled Mufasa: The Lion King, is currently in the works with Barry Jenkins slated to direct. The film was first announced in 2020 and the first look was shown at D23 in September 2022, though an official release date hasn't been announced.\n\n13 of 26\n\nLady and the Tramp (2019)\n\nReleased exclusively on Disney+, 2019's Lady and the Tramp was a live-action remake of the 1955 animated film of the same name. The film starred Tessa Thompson as the voice of Lady and Justin Theroux as the voice of Tramp alongside many other stars, including Sam Elliott, Janelle Monáe, Benedict Wong and more.\n\n14 of 26\n\nMulan (2020)\n\nIn 2020, Disney released a live-action adaptation of 1998's animated film, Mulan, with significant differences from the original (including introducing new characters and having no musical numbers). One thing that didn't change? Christina Aguilera, who performed \"Reflection\" for the original film's end credits, did contribute to the new film's soundtrack, including a new version of \"Reflection\" and a new song titled \"Loyal Brave True.\"\n\n15 of 26\n\nCruella (2021)\n\nIn 2021, Emma Stone stepped into the role of Cruella de Vil for a new film that served as an origin story for the infamous Disney villain. Since the film is a prequel to 101 Dalmatians, most of the story has little connections to the animated film, however, several characters do make appearances, including Roger and Anita. Though the film wasn't set in the same universe as the two live-action films starring Glenn Close, Close served as an executive producer alongside Stone.\n\nIn August 2021, Disney announced plans for a sequel with Stone slated to reprise her role. Further casting and a release date have not been announced.\n\n16 of 26\n\nPinocchio (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Disney released a live-action/computer-animated version of the 1940 animated film, Pinocchio. The film, which was exclusively released on Disney+, starred Tom Hanks as Geppetto with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth voicing the role of the puppet Pinocchio.\n\n17 of 26\n\nPeter Pan & Wendy (2023)\n\nReleased exclusively on Disney+, Alexander Molony and Ever Anderson starred in the live-action adaptation of 1953's Peter Pan. The film features other big stars such as Jude Law as Captain Hook and Yara Shahidi as Tinkerbell.\n\n18 of 26\n\nThe Little Mermaid (2023)\n\nHalle Bailey stars as Ariel in Disney's live-action adaptation of the 1989 animated film, The Little Mermaid. Not only does the film feature an A-list cast, including Melissa McCarthy as Ursula and Javier Bardem as King Triton, but it also features new songs from Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\n19 of 26\n\nSnow White (2024)\n\nRachel Zegler is set to play the winsome Disney princess in the upcoming live-action remake of 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs — Disney's first full-length animated film.\n\nThe Marc Webb-directed film, which also stars Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is set to be released on March 22, 2024.\n\n20 of 26\n\nLilo & Stitch\n\nA live-action adaptation of the 2002 film was first announced in 2018 and several stars have been confirmed since, including newcomer Maia Kealoha as Lilo. In April 2023, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Chris Sanders (who voiced Stitch in the original film) was in final negotiations to voice the character in the live-action movie.\n\nA release date hasn't been announced.\n\n21 of 26\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\n\nIn January 2019, PEOPLE confirmed that a live-action The Hunchback of Notre Dame was in the works with Josh Gad slated to produce and Alan Menken, who created the original score of the animated film, set to compose the music with Stephen Schwartz.\n\nIn May 2023, Menken gave an update on the project, saying that it currently sits in \"limbo\" as writers discuss how to move forward with the story. \"It's a tough one, because the Hunchback movie, Hunchback story involves a lot of real, real issues that are important issues and should be explored to be discussed,\" he told Comicbook.com. \"And there has to be an agreement about how we deal with those issues.\"\n\n22 of 26\n\nBambi\n\nPlans for a Bambi live-action film were first announced in January 2020.
