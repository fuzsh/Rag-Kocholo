        "text": "A Plastic Ocean is a new award-winning feature length documentary brought to you by a group of dedicated scientists, film-makers, social entrepreneurs, scholars, environmentalists and journalists, that explores the fragile state of our oceans and uncovers alarming truths about the consequences of our disposable lifestyle.\n\nA Plastic Ocean documents the global effects of plastic pollution and highlights workable technologies and innovative solutions that everyone - from governments to individuals - can do, to create a cleaner and greener ocean.\n\nA Plastic Ocean has been selected for screenings at international conferences and festivals around the world including at the Smithsonian Institute and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, where the film was seen by former US President Barack Obama and environmentalists Sylvia Earle and Jane Goodall.\n\nThe copyright of A Plastic Ocean is owned by Plastic Oceans Limited in Hong Kong.
