But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps — one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark's surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film will introduce a few new superheroes including Black Panther and the new Spider-Man.\n\nFive years later, Johnny Depp is reprising his role as the Mad Hatter in the sequel to \"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Alice Through the Looking Glass.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time Alice (Mia Wasikowska), who has been spending the past few years sailing across the seas, has to save the Hatter by traveling back in time.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen joins the cast as Time while Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway also return. \"Through the Looking Glass\" will be out May 27, 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver 10 years later, we'll be getting a sequel to \"Finding Nemo\" called \"Finding Dory.\" Dory will hunt down her parents as she searches for answers to her past.\n\nEllen DeGeneres will reprise her role as the blue tang along with new cast members Ed O'Neil, Diane Keaton, and Ty Burrell. \"Finding Dory\" will be in theaters June 17, 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans were going crazy for this one at Disney's fan convention D23 last August. Steven Spielberg is adapting Roald Dahl's beloved fairytale, \"The BFG,\" which stands for the big friendly giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis August, we'll get a reboot of 1977's \"Pete Dragon,\" starring Bryce Dallas Howard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film will follow an orphan, Pete, and his best friend, Elliott. The catch? Elliott's a dragon. Wes Bentley and Robert Redford also star. The film will be released August 12, 2016.\n\nHere's the official synopsis:\n\nFor years, old wood carver Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) has delighted local children with his tales of the fierce dragon that resides deep in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. To his daughter, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales … until she meets Pete (Oakes Fegley). Pete is a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliot. And from Pete’s description, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham’s stories. With the help of Natalie (Oona Laurence), an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack (Wes Bentley) owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOut this fall, \"Queen of Katwe\" will follow the adventures of a young chess protégé hoping to aspire to an international champ.\n\nThe film stars Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o (\"12 Years a Slave\"), David Oyelowo, and Madina Nalwanga as the 10-year-old chess-loving girl from Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Doctor Strange\" will introduce the internet's favorite actor, Benedict Cumberbatch, to the Marvel universe.\n\nThe film will follow Strange, a bull-headed neurosurgeon who discovers the \"world of magic and alternate dimensions\" after a car accident leaves him unable to work anymore. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton will also star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Doctor Strange\" will be in theaters November 4.\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson will show another side to the former wrestler when he sings in Disney's 56th animated movie, \"Moana.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoana, a teen from the Pacific Islands, will set out on a voyage with the \"once-mighty\" demi-god Maui (The Rock) to accomplish a mission her ancestors left uncompleted.\n\n\"Moana\" will be in theaters November 23, 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first \"Star Wars\" standalone movie, \"Rogue One\" will be in theaters December 16, 2016.\n\nTaking place before the events of \"A New Hope,\" \"Rogue One\" follows a group of resistance fighters who try to steal the plans for the Death Star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt will feature a huge cast ranging from Felicity Jones to Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker and \"Hannibal\" fan-favorite, Mads Mikkelsen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFassbender will star as a World War I veteran who comes across a baby that washes ashore ashore along with a dead man.
