        "text": "Mira Nair didn’t know it, but for years, she lived just 15 minutes away from the subject of her next film—chess champion Phiona Mutesi, a prodigy from the slums of Kampala, Uganda. It took the attention of one particularly dedicated Disney executive, Tendo Nagenda, to introduce Mutesi and Nair, then shepherd through the studio a film: Queen of Katwe, a movie that looked almost nothing like anything else from the company that brings you Avengers, jedis, and pirates.\n\n“I’ve never had a guardian angel in any film in a studio,” Nair tells Vanity Fair. “[Tendo] is truly one because he made it happen.”\n\nKatwe is a film about a young African girl, with essentially no speaking roles for white characters, directed by an Indian woman. It’s an anomaly even in an industry that prides itself on having an imagination. But it’s also one of many examples of how Disney is diversifying its array of upcoming films, presenting more inclusive visions of everything from classic musicals to a galaxy far, far away.\n\nIn the near future, we’ll have a Christmas movie starring Kevin Hart as Santa Claus, an adaptation of The Nutcracker starring Misty Copeland and Morgan Freeman, and a surprising reimagining of The Rocketeer starring a young black girl. Ice Cube is working on a hip-hop version of Oliver Twist. Moana, Disney’s first Polynesian princess movie, is set for a Thanksgiving-week release. Lin-Manuel Miranda (Disney's latest go-to music man, who also penned songs for Moana) will co-star in a Mary Poppins sequel. The upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story presents an intergalactic rebellion from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed, Diego Luna, and Donnie Yen—and all led by a woman, Felicity Jones. Between 2016 and 2018, about 24 percent of the studio's live-action releases will feature ethnic minority leads, Disney says.\n\nThings are changing behind the scenes, too. In Marvel’s corner, Taika Waititi is directing the next Thor. Ryan Coogler is helming Black Panther, which has an all-star cast featuring Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett and Lupita Nyong’o. Ava DuVernay is reimagining Madeline L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time to center around a biracial girl (newcomer Storm Reid), and the cast also includes Oprah, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Jennifer Lee will return to co-direct the Frozen sequel. The majority of Pixar films are co-produced by women, a trend that will continue (Lindsay Collins produced Finding Dory, for example). Prolific cinematographer Bradford Young has joined the company’s upcoming Han Solo origin story (which will also star Donald Glover), becoming the first black cinematographer in the historic Star Wars franchise. Meanwhile, Kathleen Kennedy, president of Disney-owned Lucasfilm, recently told Variety that they're looking for a female director to (finally) helm a Star Wars film. (The lack of female filmmakers helming blockbusters is a major, industry-wide problem, one that Disney is working to combat—though the studio doesn't currently have any hard and fast mandates in place when selecting directors for upcoming films, a source tells Vanity Fair.)\n\n“They are really killing it across the board in terms of the depth of the bench and the commitment to an inclusive slate,” DuVernay told Vanity Fair. “You have an amazing executive of color, Tendo Nagenda there. And you've got this really, really forward-thinking Sean Bailey [president of production] and Alan Horn [chairman of Walt Disney Studios] . . . they don’t even have a conversation about a movie unless they‘re talking about how it should reflect the world.”\n\nDisney is a company accustomed to molding the world in its image. The creator of iconic family movies for decades, the studio is as powerful now as it’s ever been, with a global box-office total for the year of $6.07 billion and counting—as well as control over many of the world’s most popular franchises. Disney is fairly tight-lipped when it comes to its master plan to increase diversity, but there have been clear statements over the years that show the company’s commitment. Last year, John Lasseter, the chief creative officer at Pixar Animation Studios, said his studio is dedicated to creating inclusive films. “It’s very important to us . . . to have female and ethnic characters,” he said during a press conference last May, when asked if Pixar would release a film with a black protagonist. “It’s grown in importance over time. As you’ll see in future films, we’re really paying attention to that.”\n\nMoana was one of the examples he cited, adding that the studio is “trying to reach out and find origins of legends all over the world.” Both Disney and Pixar have also been on a kick of releasing movies with strong social messages lately; Inside Out was a spectacular approach to portraying mental health, while Zootopia was a clear and vital allegory about racism (though its voice cast was, surprisingly, rather homogenous).\n\n“Inclusivity is not only a priority but an imperative for us, and it’s top of mind on every single project,“ Disney president of motion-picture production Sean Bailey recently told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAnd it’s not always easy, even at a studio sitting comfortably atop the global box office. Nagenda, for example, spent years hoping to develop Queen of Katwe, but he had to get a few hits under his belt first. So he worked on more conventional films like Cinderella and Saving Mr. Banks first, both of which became critical and box-office successes—and bolstered his bargaining power. “I used all of the equity I had built to put this movie forward,” he told Wired. The film got a $15 million budget, and was executed with both Nair and Nagenda's vision of depicting real life for a young Ugandan girl—there would be no white saviors and no tired African stereotypes, but they also wouldn’t shy away from depicting the harsh realities of life in the slums, Nair says. The film wasn't a box-office hit (it made $9.5 million worldwide), but it did garner great reviews; it’s currently sitting on a fresh 92 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n“Across all of our studios, we strive to tell inclusive stories — both in front of and also behind the camera,” Alan Horn tells VF. “It’s one of the most important issues facing our industry, and we continue to seek out and work with filmmakers and creatives who understand and share our commitment to making films that reflect the world around us.”\n\nThat dedication to depicting reality is a priority for a number of Disney’s films. Last year, Pixar surprised critics of its upcoming Día de los Muertos film Coco by hiring cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz, who had previously lambasted Disney for trying to trademark the phrase “Day of the Dead”—an ill-conceived move that rightly drew backlash.\n\nMoana is another example of Disney's pursuit of authenticity and cultural approval. For years, co-directors John Musker and Ron Clements worked with “a team of anthropologists, cultural practitioners, historians, linguists, and choreographers from islands including Samoa, Tahiti, Mo’orea, and Fiji,” they told Vanity Fair, in order to ensure cultural accuracy and sensitivity.\n\nDespite that dedicated team, Moana has still faced scrutiny for obvious missteps. Earlier this year, Disney released a boys’ Halloween costume that allowed children to dress up like main character Maui. But the costume was a full-body outfit made to look like Maui’s skin, which was quickly deemed offensive and then pulled from Disney's online store. “The team behind Moana has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific Islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some,” the company said in a subsequent statement. “We sincerely apologize and are pulling the costume from our website and stores.”\n\nThe studio has made missteps elsewhere. When Finding Dory possibly showed a lesbian couple for a few brief seconds earlier this summer, it was newsworthy — because Disney has yet to portray LGBT characters in a significant way. Dory's filmmakers also included an equally rare depiction of characters with disabilities, but couldn't avoid criticism of their efforts.\n\nAnd as the studio continues to mine its own back catalogue for new films, often drawing on stories told in less progressive times, there is more room for error. After Disney announced its plans to make a live-action Mulan, Internet reports about the new film’s spec script revealed that the story originally featured a white savior character—a European trader in his 30s who falls in love with Mulan, a teenager. A source close to the film eventually quelled the outrage—“Mulan is and will always be the lead character in the story, and all primary roles, including the love interest, are Chinese,” the source told V.F in October.\n\nBut Disney‘s past is littered with films that employed racist stereotypes. Beloved classics like Peter Pan and Dumbo, for example, contain jarringly racist caricatures of Native Americans and African-Americans, while older films like the notorious 1946 Song of the South will always be a severe embarrassment—and a testament of a grim past Disney is trying to leave far behind. More recent movies like Aladdin have been dogged by stereotyping criticisms as well. And even Auli’i Cravalho, who voices the titular role in Moana, said she was initially “wary” of the film: “I think that everyone can say they might be a little afraid of it, because when we have a film that is inspired by a culture we want to feel good about it.”\n\nDisney, with its vast resources and power, is uniquely situated to reflect the diversity of its voracious audience. Five of the top 10 highest-grossing films of the year thus far are Disney films, while Rogue One is poised both to end the year with a bang and shepherd in a strong 2017 box office.\n\nAnd inclusive filmmaking from a powerful studio is just what the industry needs right now. Study after study has shown that white men get the lion's share of opportunity in Hollywood, both in front of and behind the camera, as well as in the studio C-suites—even though films with more inclusive casts make more money at the box office, according to a study conducted by U.C.L.A.'s Bunche Center for African-American Studies. “The conventional wisdom has been, you can’t have a film with a minority lead because it’s not going to travel well overseas—and films make most of their money overseas,” Bunche center director Darrell Hunt says. “What our study is suggesting is that that logic is false.” Disney, which cast John Boyega and Oscar Isaac to lead the $2 billion-grossing Star Wars: The Force Awakens, understands this as well as anyone. The international box office has grown by 21 percent, and forthcoming films will need to find ways to reel in new viewers. “Diversity is not only important; it is a core strategy for the company,” Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company, has previously said.\n\nPast and present Hollywood behavior has taught us that if something like Queen of Katwe doesn't do well at the box office, similar films—directed by women, starring black actors—just won't get made. Though that film was outside the norm even for Disney, the studio's devotion to making it the right way is a sign that Disney really is committed to telling stories the world should hear.\n\n“I think Disney has woken up, and is seeing the power of waking up others,” Nair says. “And that’s great . . . but the real test will be in the years to come, whether Queen of Katwe will continue to stand out as this rarity alongside other movies they’re now committing to, like Wrinkle in Time and Moana and so on. Or whether it will be one out of many—and I want to be one out of many.”"
