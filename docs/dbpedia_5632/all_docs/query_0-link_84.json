        "text": "Ocean's Crew Steals Box-office Title from Pirates\n\nOcean's Thirteen debuted to slightly lower numbers than parts Eleven and Twelve, yet still topped the weekend box office with a $37.1 million haul, unseating POTC 3 ($21.3 mil) from the No. 1 spot.Rounding out the top five were Knocked Up ($20 million), Happy Feet: The Funny Version Surf's Up (opening with $18 mil) and Shrek the Third ($15.75 mil). The week's other newbie, Hostel Part II (or as I like to call it, \"Poor, Poor Heather Matarazzo\") came in at No. 6 with $8.75 mil, less than half of the original's first-weekend take. Overall, the box office was down nine percent from a year ago, when Cars opened with $60 mil.\n\nOcean's Stars Donate $750K to Darfur Efforts\n\nNot On Our Watch, an organization that raises awareness of the crisis in Darfur and similarly troubled regions and was founded by Ocean's Thirteen stars George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle, and producer Jerry Weintraub, announced on Thursday that a $750,000 grant has been made by the aformentioned quintet to Oxfam's humanitarian efforts in Darfur and neighboring Chad.\n\nAt the Movies: Cannes Has Thirteen's Number\n\nPer Variety, Ocean's Thirteen will make its international premiere at this year's Cannes Film Festival.... Don Cheadle will produce, star in and make his feature-directing debut with a Miles Davis biopic.... Per the Hollywood Reporter &#151; as Kristen Bell shared with TVGuide.com two weeks ago &#151; the Veronica Mars star will topline Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a \"romantic disaster movie\" penned by and costarring How I Met Your Mother's Jason Segel.... Daniel Craig is in talks to join Julianne Moore in Blindness, based on Jose Saramago's acclaimed novel.... Rider Strong will reprise his role of Paul in Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever. 30 Rock's Judah Friedlander is also on board."
