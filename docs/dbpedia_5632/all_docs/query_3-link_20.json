        "text": "Walt Disney (DIS) is a household name in family entertainment and a leading international media conglomerate. Founded in 1923 as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio by brothers Walt and Roy Disney, the company has a market capitalization of about $177 billion. It generated a net gain of $3.4 billion on revenue of $88.9 billion during its 2023 fiscal year (FY), which ended Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nUnder the leadership of Bob Iger, the company operates through the following business segments: Entertainment, which includes media networks, studio entertainment, and direct-to-consumer and international; Sports, including ESPN; and Experiences, which includes parks, experiences, and products.\n\nBelow, we look in more detail at the company’s seven largest acquisitions.\n\nDisney's Acquisition Strategy\n\nAcquisitions are a major vehicle of growth for Disney—and have been over the past three decades. One example is Studio Entertainment, the foundation upon which the company was built.\n\nWhile Disney produces high-quality video content under its name, it has used acquisitions to become the owner of intellectual property (IP) rights to its blockbuster film and TV franchises. It bought the following names:\n\nLucasfilm, which owns of the “Star Wars” franchise\n\nMarvel Entertainment, the owner of a long list of Marvel heroes, including Spider-Man and Iron Man\n\nPixar, creator of the “Toy Story” and “Cars” franchises and other hits\n\nThe company also distributes content through three major acquired brands—ABC, ESPN, and 21st Century Fox—as well as through its own Disney Channel.\n\nThe acquisition of a majority stake in BAMTech in August 2017 and the purchase of 21st Century Fox in March 2019 were key deals in the company’s launch of its digital content streaming service Disney+.\n\n1. 21st Century Fox\n\nType of Business: Global media and entertainment\n\nAcquisition Price: $71 billion\n\nAcquisition Date: March 20, 2019\n\n21st Century Fox emerged from the 2013 split of News Corp., the sprawling publishing and entertainment empire owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. In the breakup, the publishing arm of the company retained the name News Corp. (NWS) while the entertainment division, including the 20th Century Fox studio, was spun off into a separate company named 21st Century Fox.\n\nWhen Disney acquired the company in 2019 for $71 billion, the entertainment business was renamed TFCF Corp., and many of the news assets were spun off into a new, separately owned public company called Fox (FOX).\n\nThrough that series of deals, Disney became the owner of a basket of prized global franchises, including the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, international TV business Star, and a 30% interest in Hulu, increasing Disney's interest to 60%. The company purchased the remaining 33% stake in Hulu from Comcast in 2023. The deal was worth $8.61 billion.\n\nDisney also retained perpetual rights to certain Fox brands, including 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight. The acquisition significantly augmented Disney’s ability to provide more content and entertainment options to meet growing consumer demand.\n\n2. Capital Cities/ABC\n\nType of Business: Media\n\nAcquisition Price: $19 billion\n\nAcquisition Date: July 31, 1995\n\nCapital Cities/ABC was formed in 1985 when media firm Capital Cities Communications acquired American Broadcasting Company for $3.5 billion.\n\nDisney’s $19 billion purchase of the company in 1995 was considered the second-largest corporate takeover ever, bringing together two of the world’s leading media and family entertainment companies. Through the deal, Disney acquired TV stations, radio stations, a percentage of ESPN, The History Channel, A&E Network, Lifetime Television, and a publishing group.\n\nThis acquisition transformed Disney into the first media company with a major presence in the four key distribution systems of filmed entertainment, cable television, broadcasting, and telephone wires (through a joint venture with three regional phone companies). The deal also expanded Disney’s overseas presence, as Capital Cities/ABC was already distributing ESPN abroad.\n\n3. Pixar Animation Studios\n\nType of Business: Computer animation studio\n\nAcquisition Price: $7.4 billion\n\nAcquisition Date: Jan. 24, 2006\n\nPixar was created in 1986 when Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, bought the computer animation division from Lucasfilm, which made major progress in perfecting animated film technology. Under Jobs, Pixar turned into the world’s premier animated film producer. It created “Toy Story,” the world’s first computer-animated feature film, and other hits like “Finding Nemo.”\n\nDisney’s $7.4 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006 made it an instant leader in animated films. Under Disney, Pixar has produced films such as “Cars,” “Ratatouille,” “WALL•E,” and several sequels to “Toy Story.”\n\n4. Lucasfilm\n\nType of Business: Film and TV production company\n\nAcquisition Price: $4.1 billion\n\nAcquisition Date: Oct. 30, 2012\n\nLucasfilm was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1971 by filmmaker George Lucas. The studio is best known for creating and producing the blockbuster “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” franchises and has been a leader in developing special effects, sound, and computer animation.\n\nDisney’s acquisition of the company in 2012 gave it access to the distribution rights of those high-grossing franchises. Disney also leveraged those franchises through its theme parks and resorts, such as the “Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge”-themed entertainment area at Disneyland and Disney World.\n\n5. Marvel Entertainment\n\nType of Business: Entertainment\n\nAcquisition Price: $4 billion\n\nAcquisition Date: Aug. 31, 2009\n\nThe precursor to what would become Marvel Entertainment was founded in the 1930s under the name Timely Comics. The comic book publisher went through various name changes, different ownerships, filed for bankruptcy, and developed into a premier creator and publisher of entertainment media with a library of 5,000 characters, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, X-Men, Captain America, and the Fantastic Four.\n\nDisney leveraged its $4 billion purchase of the company to accelerate the number of movie releases starring Marvel characters, including box office hits such as “The Avengers” (2012), “Iron Man 3” (2013), “Black Panther” (2018), and many more.\n\n6. Fox Family Worldwide\n\nType of Business: Media and entertainment\n\nAcquisition Price: Approximately $5.2 billion ($2.9 billion in cash, plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in debt)\n\nAcquisition Dates: July 23, 2001 (announced); Oct. 24, 2001 (completed)\n\nFox Family Worldwide was formed in 1995 by a joint venture (JV) between Haim Saban and Fox Broadcasting, an affiliate of billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Before being acquired by Disney, the company had become one of the world’s leading vertically integrated global family and children’s entertainment companies.\n\nThrough the deal, which occurred in late October 2001, Disney acquired the Fox Family Channel in the U.S., which had about 81 million subscribers, as well as Fox Kids channels worldwide.\n\nThe acquisition was seen as a move by Disney to keep pace with its competitors during a period of consolidation in the media industry. It also gave Disney the rights to 6,500 episodes of children’s and family-friendly programming, as well as rights to show Major League Baseball games. Disney renamed the network ABC Family Channel. It has since been rebranded as Freeform.\n\n7. BAMTech LLC\n\nType of Business: Streaming services\n\nAcquisition Prices: $1 billion in two installments (33% stake); $1.6 billion (additional 42% stake)\n\nAcquisition Dates: Aug. 9, 2016; Aug. 8, 2017\n\nBAMTech LLC originated out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM), the interactive media and Internet company formed by Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\nThe company first began livestreaming MLB games in 2002. In 2007, it launched a video streaming app on Apple's (AAPL) iTunes store. Over the next eight years, BAMTech launched the WWE Network streaming service, HBO NOW, the PlayStation Vue livestreaming TV service, and more. In 2015, the company was spun off from MLBAM.\n\nIn 2016, Disney acquired a 33% minority stake in BAMTech, which by then had become a global leader in direct-to-consumer streaming services, data analytics, and commerce management. The deal came with an option for Disney to acquire majority ownership, which it exercised a year later, purchasing an additional 42% stake for approximately $1.6 billion in 2017. The acquisition of a majority stake in BAMTech provided Disney with the assets that it would use to launch video streaming services ESPN+ in 2018 and Disney+ in 2019.\n\nDisney Diversity & Inclusiveness Transparency"
