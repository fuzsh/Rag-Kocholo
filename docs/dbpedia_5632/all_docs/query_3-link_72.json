        "text": "This article is about the current feature animation division of The Walt Disney Company. For this company's history prior to 1986, see Walt Disney Productions.\n\nBackground\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios is an American animation studio owned by The Walt Disney Studios, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was formed on February 6, 1986 as Walt Disney Feature Animation, inheriting the animation staff of Walt Disney Productions following that company's reorganization as The Walt Disney Company. In its current incarnation, the studio has produced 37 animated films within the larger Disney Animated Canon, with its most recent being Wish, released on November 22, 2023. All of its films are released by Walt Disney Pictures through the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures banner.\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios did not have an official onscreen logo until it took on its current name in 2007.\n\n1st Logo (Unofficial) (March 1996)\n\nVisuals: Above the Funcom logo on a white background, there's a sunlight. Over the sunlight, a Mickey Mouse silhouette is seen with a hand drawing a picture. Below it, there are the smaller texts \"Animation Services\" and \"Walt Disney Feature Animation\" with \"Walt Disney\" being in a corporate font.\n\nTechnique: A still, digital graphic.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on Pocahontas for Sega Genesis.\n\n2nd Logo (Official) (March 23, 2007-)\n\nVisuals: On a paper background, a red circle is drawn. As the camera zooms out, more pieces of paper fold out on the screen like a flipbook, and the circle quickly becomes a rough sketch of Mickey Mouse in his appearance from the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie. Eventually, the pages stop flipping, and the sketch animates (showing Mickey happily whistling while turning the wheel on the steamboat he is driving) before slowly turning into footage of the original scene from the short. The scene zooms out onto the background with a spotlight, and below the picture, the words \"WALT DiSNEY\" write themselves in a sketchier version of the signature corporate font, with \"ANIMATION STUDIOS\" (set in ITC Kabel Demi) fading in underneath.\n\nTrivia: In 2024, Steamboat Willie entered the public domain in the United States. However, it has been speculated that this logo was created using footage of the cartoon to extend its protection under trademark law.\n\nVariants:\n\nStarting in 2008, the logo was given a high-definition look, which used the same animation.\n\nOn the iPad app Disney Animated, the logo is in a 4:3 aspect ratio and is shown before the first section \"Art in Motion\". In this variant, the logo zooms in to focus on an abridged version of the Steamboat Willie footage. As the animation finishes, it cuts to a scene from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nOn Tangled (the 50th Disney animated feature and the 25th film produced by WDAS) and Encanto (the 60th Disney animated feature and the 35th film produced by WDAS), a custom variant was used:\n\nThe former has the animation staying in place as it is slowly overtaken by a large, orange circle outline, with the wheel being filled with black before transforming into the normal scene. It then zooms out to reveal it is part of a large \"50\", with the company name entirely in brown at the top, while the stacked text \"ANIMATED MOTION PICTURE\" appears under the \"50\" and a small \"TH\" appears at the top-right corner. The closing version of this variant has the finished product shown up close before animating as usual (albeit at a faster pace); the company name is already formed while the rest of the text fades in.\n\nThe latter has the \"50\" replaced by a \"60\", and the logo is shortened to the number zooming out to its place. The closing variant just has the last seconds of the normal logo.\n\nA trailer for the latter film has the company name replaced with \"OUR\".\n\nOn Wreck-It Ralph, the logo is done in an 8-bit video game style on a black background.\n\nOn Frozen II, the logo crossfades into the opening scene of the movie.\n\nA shortened version exists which has the logo in its last few seconds, with the cartoon footage already fixed in place as the text writes in. This seems to have replaced the standard logo on films.\n\nSometimes, the logo is still.\n\nOn the Disney100 \"4th of July\" special look video on Disney's social pages, the first few seconds of the logo are shown in black and white before it fades into footage from Steamboat Willie. On Disney's TikTok page, it is cropped in a 9:21 ratio to fit the phone's portrait orientation.\n\nTechnique: CGI directed by Mike Gabriel and produced by Roy Conli, using Ub Iwerks' original animation drawings from the Steamboat Willie short as reference.\n\nAudio: The sound of pages turning, followed by audio of Mickey whistling the song Steamboat Bill (music by The Leighton Brothers and lyrics by Ren Shields) with a piano playing along, taken directly from the original Steamboat Willie cartoon.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Wreck-It Ralph, a short 8-bit version of Steamboat Bill plays.\n\nThe shortened variant has a truncated version of the whistle tune.\n\nOn some films, the opening theme or sound effects play over the logo instead.\n\nThe closing variant is silent or has the ending theme of the movie.\n\nAt the end of The Princess and the Frog and on post-2011 prints of Beauty and the Beast (1991), only the whistling is heard with no piano accompaniment.\n\nThe still version has the ending theme of the film play over it.\n\nAvailability: This appears on every film produced by the studio beginning with Meet the Robinsons.\n\nIt also appears on post-2011 prints of Beauty of the Beast (1991).\n\nThe shortened variant appears at the end of the studio's films starting with Bolt, as well as on short films and movies beginning with Strange World (due to the length of the 2022 Disney logo).\n\nIt also appears on the Disney+ series Baymax! and Zootopia+.\n\nThe still version appears on the Prep & Landing TV specials, as well as the short Operation: Secret Santa.\n\nAlthough a new print logo was introduced in 2020, this logo is still used onscreen.\n\nThis logo does not appear on the 2022 short Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, despite it being produced by the company.\n\nLegacy: This is a throwback to one of Disney's most important films, which marked the debut of Mickey Mouse, the company's mascot (the character actually made his debut on a test screening of Plane Crazy, an earlier short that was produced before Steamboat Willie but not officially released until a few months after said short)."
