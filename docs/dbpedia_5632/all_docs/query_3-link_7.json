        "text": "This article is about the distribution division, Buena Vista Film Distribution\n\nclick the blue text to see the film company of the same name Buena Vista Film Relases.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Type Division of The Walt Disney Studios Founded June 23, 1953 Headquarters 500 S. Buena Vista Street, Burbank, California, United States Founder(s) Walt Disney\n\nRoy Oliver Disney Key people Dave Holis (vice president) Industry Motion Pictures Parent The Walt Disney Studios\n\n(The Walt Disney Company) Website http://www.waltdisneystudios.com/\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is an American motion picture distributor owned by The Walt Disney Company. Established in 1953 as Buena Vista Film Distribution, the company handles distribution for films produced by the Walt Disney Studios; including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, 20th Century Studios, Disneynature, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, Blue Sky Studios, and Lucasfilm.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrior to 1953, Walt Disney Productions' short films and feature films were distributed by Celebrity Productions, Columbia Pictures, United Artists and RKO Radio Pictures. A dispute with RKO over the value of Disney's True-Life Adventures series of live-action documentary featurettes in 1953 led to Walt and his older brother Roy Oliver Disney to form its wholly owned subsidiary Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (BVD) to handle the U.S. distribution of their own films. Despite this, RKO would continue to distribute some of Disney's theatrical shorts until 1956. Buena Vista's first release was the Academy Award winning live-action feature The Living Desert on November 10, 1953 along with Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Buena Vista's first animated release. Notable subsequent releases include the foreign film, Yang Kwei Fei (Most Noble Lady), released in US theaters in September of 1956, The Missouri Traveler in March 1958, and The Big Fisherman in July 1959 (the first third-party production financed by Disney). In 1961, Disney incorporated Buena Vista International, distributing its first PG rated film, Take Down, in January 1979.\n\nOther names for the division were Buena Vista Distribution Company, Inc. (April 1960-July 1987) and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. (July 1987-April 2007)[1].\n\nIn April 2007, Disney dissolved the Buena Vista moniker in its distribution branding and re-branded itself as Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.\n\nDistribution[]\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is noteworthy for having 25 films that have surpassed the $1-billion-mark and 3 films of the $2-billion-mark in worldwide ticket sales:\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019; $2,797,800,564)\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (2015; $2,068,223,624)\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2018; $2,048,359,754)\n\nThe Lion King (2019; $1,656,821,650)\n\nThe Avengers (2012; $1,518,594,910)\n\nFrozen II (2019; $1,450,026,933)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015; $1,402,805,868)\n\nBlack Panther (2018; $1,347,280,838)\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi (2017; $1,332,539,889)\n\nFrozen (2013; $1,280,802,282)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (2017; $1,263,521,126)\n\nIncredibles 2 (2018; $1,242,805,359)\n\nIron Man 3 (2013; $1,214,811,252)\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016; $1,153,304,495)\n\nCaptain Marvel (2019; $1,128,274,794)\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019; $1,074,144,248)\n\nToy Story 4 (2019; $1,073,394,593)\n\nToy Story 3 (2010; $1,066,969,703)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006; $1,066,179,725)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016; $1,056,057,273)\n\nAladdin (2019; $1,050,693,953)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011; $1,045,713,802)\n\nFinding Dory (2016; $1,028,570,889)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (2010; $1,025,467,110)\n\nZootopia (2016; $1,023,784,195)\n\nDisney is the only major Hollywood studio that has released more than four films that have crossed the $1-billion-mark (in worldwide grosses). In addition, Disney is the first of only two studios to have released two $1-billion films in the same year (the other being Warner Bros.). The top three highest grossing animated films have been released by Disney (4 films if counted The Lion King). Seventeen of the twenty highest grossing G-rated films were also distributed by Disney. In 2012, Disney achieved its largest yearly box-office gross in North America.\n\nThe company distributes all features produced by The Walt Disney Studios, other Disney film units and some third-parties including:\n\nCurrent units\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\n\nPixar Animation Studios\n\nThe Muppets Studio\n\nLucasfilm\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nDisneynature\n\nESPN Films\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nFox 2000 Pictures\n\n20th Century Animation\n\nBlue Sky Studios\n\nSearchlight Pictures\n\nFormer units\n\nDisneytoon Studios (1988-2018; defunct)\n\nHollywood Pictures (1990–2007; defunct)\n\nMiramax Films (1993–2010; sold)\n\nDimension Films (1993–2005; sold)\n\nImageMovers Digital (2009–2011; defunct)\n\nTouchstone Pictures (1984–2016; inactive)\n\nInternational arrangements[]\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International was formed in 1961 as Buena Vista International, Inc.[2], which is the owner of Disney Channel Asia.[3] In 1992, Disney opted to end a previous joint venture with Warner Bros., that began in 1988 to distribute their films in overseas markets (UK, Ireland, Benelux and Scandinavia). In those territories from 1993-2007, Disney reactivated the Buena Vista International name, and also sent distribution under it in countries that did not have any current arrangements with other companies. Distribution rights in West Germany were given to MGM (under CIC in the early 1970s) and later to 20th Century Fox before the Warner Bros. joint venture. In Russia and CIS, Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Greece, Singapore and the Philippines, Disney films had been distributed in a joint venture with Sony Pictures Entertainment.[4] In Japan, distribution rights are handled in partnership with Toho.\n\nOther international distributors\n\nUK/Ireland — Rank Film Distributors (1954–1986) and Warner Bros.
