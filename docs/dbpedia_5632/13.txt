Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is an American motion picture distributor owned by The Walt Disney Company. Established in 1953 as Buena Vista Film Distribution, the company handles distribution for films produced by the Walt Disney Studios; including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, 20th Century Studios, Disneynature, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, Blue Sky Studios, and Lucasfilm.

History[]

Prior to 1953, Walt Disney Productions' short films and feature films were distributed by Celebrity Productions, Columbia Pictures, United Artists and RKO Radio Pictures. A dispute with RKO over the value of Disney's True-Life Adventures series of live-action documentary featurettes in 1953 led to Walt and his older brother Roy Oliver Disney to form its wholly owned subsidiary Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (BVD) to handle the U.S. distribution of their own films. Despite this, RKO would continue to distribute some of Disney's theatrical shorts until 1956. Buena Vista's first release was the Academy Award winning live-action feature The Living Desert on November 10, 1953 along with Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Buena Vista's first animated release. Notable subsequent releases include the foreign film, Yang Kwei Fei (Most Noble Lady), released in US theaters in September of 1956, The Missouri Traveler in March 1958, and The Big Fisherman in July 1959 (the first third-party production financed by Disney). In 1961, Disney incorporated Buena Vista International, distributing its first PG rated film Take Down in January 1979.

Other names for the division were Buena Vista Distribution Company, Inc. (April 1960-July 1987) and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. (July 1987-April 2007).[1]

In April 2007, Disney dissolved the Buena Vista moniker in its distribution branding and re-branded itself as Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.

On October 12, 2020, Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced the founding of Disney Media Distribution, as the result, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Disney Music Group, and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment are all transferred to this new division.[2]

International arrangements[]

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International was formed in 1961 as Buena Vista International, Inc.[6], which is the owner of Disney Channel Asia.[7] In 1992, Disney opted to end a previous joint venture with Warner Bros., that began in 1988 to distribute their films in select overseas markets (UK, Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia, Brazil among others). In those territories from 1993-2007, Disney reactivated the Buena Vista International name, and also sent distribution under it in countries that did not have any current arrangements with other companies. Distribution rights in West Germany were given to MGM (under CIC in the early 1970s) and later to 20th Century Fox before the Warner Bros. joint venture. In Russia and CIS, Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Greece, Singapore and the Philippines, Disney films had been distributed in a joint venture with Sony Pictures Entertainment.[8]

Notes[]

Disney retains all the distribution rights to these 14 DreamWorks films in perpetuity.

Buena Vista is only a distribution studio working for Disney, and does not exist as a separate company.

Some home video prints of Disney movies released under RKO instead rely on later re-release under Buena Vista.
