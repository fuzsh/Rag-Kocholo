Background

In 2007, after the release of The Game Plan, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, an American film distributor within the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company, was renamed Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It handles theatrical and occasional digital distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by the Walt Disney Studios, including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studios; the Searchlight Pictures label operates its own autonomous theatrical distribution and marketing unit. The company almost never uses a logo, instead opting for in-credit notices, but there has been one exception.

Logo (October 6, 2010, 2012)

Visuals: Scrolling in the credits, there is an outline of a rectangle with a monochrome version of the castle from the 2006 Walt Disney Pictures logo. Under the rectangle, there is the stacked text "WALT DiSNEY STUDIOS MOTION PICTURES".

Variant: On the Phase 4 Films release of the film, the logo is much smaller, making it harder to see, and is on a white square.

Technique: A still and superimposed digital graphic.

Audio: The closing theme of the movie.

Availability: It's seen only on the Dutch film, Fuchsia the Mini-Witch.
