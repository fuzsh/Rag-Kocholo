        "text": "The One with the Donor\n\nDisappointed to learn that they cannot conceive a baby naturally, Monica and Chandler mull their options. When Chandler brings home a handsome, unknowing co-worker, Zack (John Stamos - \"Full House,\" \"Thieves\"), for dinner, Monica and Chandler embarrassingly \"interview\" him as a potential sperm donor. Meanwhile, while shopping with Phoebe, Rachel confides that she is enamored with Joey. Unfortunately, Joey's current girlfriend, Charlie (recurring guest star Aisha Tyler), overhears. And Phoebe encounters a boyfriend, David (recurring guest star Hank Azaria), from long ago.\n\nTequila Sunrise\n\nTurtle gets a south-of-the-border business pitch from Alex, but has a hard time believing he isn't being used. Drama enlists Bob Saget to help him smooth out a rough first impression with John Stamos, a potential sitcom co-star. Ari's euphoria after making an NFL pitch to a group of Hollywood high rollers is tempered when he learns that Lizzie may be siphoning off some of his prized clients. Eric and Scott patch up their differences with an eye on Vince's future--and the shared success of their company.\n\nBang\n\nWhen an abandoned baby is found on playground, Detectives Benson (Hargitay) and Stabler (Meloni) go in search of the child's caregiver. Upon meeting the nanny and her boyfriend, Ken Turner (guest star John Stamos), they soon realize that he is also engaged.\n\nBritney/Brittany\n\nWhen Brittany and the gang try to convince Mr. Schuester to let them do a Britney Spears number, he is reluctant to go that edgy. Meanwhile, an insecure Will is curious about Emmaâs new beau, Dr. Carl Howell, so he convinces her to bring him in to talk to the kids about dental hygiene. While the dreamy doc inspires the girls to take their dental health more seriously, Will is left feeling worse than before.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Glee Show\n\nWill decides to have the glee club perform âThe Rocky Horror Showâ for the annual school musical after learning of Emmaâs newfound love for the cult classic. Despite Sueâs usual scheming, the members of New Directions inject their distinctive style to the showâs timeless tracks. Meatloaf and Barry Bostwick guest-star. Musical performances include âScience Fiction Double Featureâ, âDamn It, Janetâ, âWhatever Happened to Saturday Night?â, âSweet Transvestiteâ, âTouch a Touch a Touch a Touch Meâ, âThereâs a Light (Over At the Frankenstein Place)â and âTime Warpâ."
