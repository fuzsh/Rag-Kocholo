        "text": "Hank Azaria, as cordial as one could be on a Monday morning in El Segundo, rolls through a 15-minute appearance on “The Rich Eisen Show,” regaling about all things New York sports – Mets, Jets and Knicks – that are near and dear to him.\n\nAs Eisen sends the show into a commercial break, Azaria eases himself out of the guest chair from the window-framed, ground-floor studio in the AT&T facility.\n\n“I’ve got six minutes, right?” Azaria asks.\n\n“Six minutes,” Eisen confirms, “and we’re back.”\n\nIn a deft costume-change move out of “Saturday Night Live” between skits, Azaria goes with a mini-entourage – a publicist, a personal assistant and a production partner — back down the hall and around the corner to Eisen’s dressing room.\n\nGetting out of his blue blazer, gray-striped dress shirt and olive-colored khaki pants, Azaria is soon retracing his steps back to the set now in dark slacks, a white dress shirt and red tie – and slipping on the subjectively loud plaid jacket in the process.\n\nNo new makeup, hairpiece or alcohol intake necessary.\n\nJim Brockmire is now ready for his caustic close-up.\n\nWith the proper prompting by Eisen, Brockmire immediately lays in with the thick campy Southern drawl and returns fire at the host, saying he watched him on gas station pump monitors and says he’s now become “the Shonda Rhimes of petroleum-based entertainment.”\n\nHe sizes up Texas Rangers’ soon-to-be 45-year-old pitcher Bartolo Colon as “disability-check fat.” He calls NBA games unwatchable because “the last 90 seconds are like a Judd Apatow movie – a fun thing that goes on at least 20 minutes too long.” And he just can’t stop when referring to Brent Musburger as “a P-U-N-K punk” but takes it to a point where now the phrase “Ruffles have ridges” is something seared into our Freudian id.\n\nAs that quarter-hour segment winds down, Brockmire poses for photos, submits to some Eisen show-related social media, and morphs back into Azaria. The crew is whisked up the nearby 105 Freeway toward the LA Live studios of 710-KSPN to join John Ireland and Ben Lyons for another two-segment sit-down – this time, only as Azaria – as the Southern California tour continues.\n\nA CHARACTER’S CHARTED COURSE\n\nBy the time Season 2 of “Brockmire” debuts Wednesday on the IFC network, Azaria will have submitted to all sorts of somewhat-odd and high-end media appearances, contractually obligated but personally agreeable.\n\nHe’s publicizing something to a sports TV viewership world that’s nothing more than a DVR reminder — the show that already got him a Best Actor in a Comedy Series nomination from the Critics’ Choice Television Awards will reload, explaining more from the salty cliffhanger that ended its debut eight-episode run in the spring of 2017.\n\nMost of these media hits focus primarily on Azaria, the 53-year-old actor known for his voiced characters on “The Simpsons,” playing a gay Guatemalan house boy in “The Birdcage,” and once embodying Mitch Albom in a “Tuesdays With Morrie” made-for-TV movie almost 20 years ago. This coming week leading into the relaunch, Azaria will be back in New York for spots on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” the “Today” show and “Live with Kelly and Ryan.”\n\nBut when the circumstances of Azaria-as-Brockmire present themselves, organically or staged, the dynamic changes for the betterment of all who want to play along.\n\nThe zigging in and zagging out of different ways to promote a show have now included coming on with longtime friend Eisen, a recent half-hour appearance on ESPN’s “Highly Questionable” with Dan LeBatard, and going on the air during an ESPN telecast of a Mets’ game. Fox has figured out a way to have Azaria dressed as Brockmire at the Mets’ Citi Field on Tuesday to record a series of lines that will be edited into the intro for the FS1 coverage of the Yankees-Angels game from Anaheim on April 28.\n\nBut before he’s doing any more ESPN “car wash” or Barstool Sports appearances, there is some prep work that has to be done.\n\nBack up again to the Eisen pit stop: A half hour before he was to go on, Azaria paced in the green room asking three publicists who came with him if they could pull documents up on their phones that included lines he had used in the past that had to do with Colon, the former Angels Cy Young Award-winning pitcher who, because of his size and appearance, is still ripe for ribbing, especially after nearly throwing a no-hitter against Houston the previous night on ESPN “Sunday Night Baseball.”\n\nThe trio of colleagues, who were with Azaria in Hollywood that Sunday morning for Deadline’s Emmy-contenders panel discussion, quickly started reading off jokes that Azaria had done, allowing him to filter through and re-rehearse them as one-liners he could use on the set as Brockmire when he was to be with Eisen.\n\nSo yes, a decent part of Azaria’s appearances as Brockmire have a scripted element, crafted by the show’s executive producer and head writer Joel Church-Cooper to fit the circumstances of each interview and keep the character true. But it doesn’t preclude Azaria from inserting his own prepared ad libs. Comfortable enough doing Brockmire for a full season-plus and knowing the audience is already in on the joke, Azaria says it’s easier to roll with this because of his years of “method acting” training on “The Simpsons” to simply take a breath, focus, and get into it.\n\n“And for the most part, I know what I’m going to say,” Azaria said during a break after the ESPN radio spot. “I can free-form, improvise as the character, but I’m usually in the context about talking about sports. You want to have a take and be funny, concisely, and promote the show as well aside from just being entertaining, not to go out there and bomb.\n\n“So, yeah, you want to know what you’re going to say and you want to score.”\n\nSEASONED VETERAN MOVES\n\nPromoting “Brockmire” could be an award-winning venture into itself, if awards are given for such a thing.\n\nAs more and more working sports broadcasters embrace the grizzled “Brockmire” creation – Joe Buck played himself astonishing well in Season 1 as a Brockmire foil, and Bob Costas hosted the Season 2 premiere in New York last week – the Baseball Hall of Fame’s “Scribes and Mikemen” wing has allowed a display to go up featuring the Brockmire plaid jacket. Maybe if only to confuse visitors who make the pilgrimage in hopes of getting a glimpse of a Vin Scully or Dick Enberg plaque.\n\nLongtime sports communications specialist Adam Friefeld, who flew out from New York to help coordinate the L.A. media appearances, said it took about a year to orchestrate that aspect of the promotional campaign.\n\nIFC has already picked up Seasons 3 and 4 for “Brockmire,” giving Azaria time to process how far this can go. Season 2, for example, gets a little more in to Brockmire’s dark side as he moves to New Orleans – what could possibly go wrong there for a recovering alcoholic? – and gets frustrated as he awaits the retirement of the Atlanta play-by-play man and a promise he’ll be hired so he can resume his big-league career.\n\n“Season 4 might genuinely be it,” said Azaria, whose character was birthed several years ago from a “Funny Or Die” company skit co-created by Will Ferrell, who knows about making promotional appearances (and even beyond that) in character as Ron Burgundy from “Anchorman” movie fame.\n\n“One of the things about this lovely era of television is that when things seem to run its course, then you can stop. If you tell the creative story you want to tell, then you can be done. That said, if they back up the money truck to our house and say ‘Season 5!’ we’ll probably do it. Who knows?”\n\nBy then, who knows how it’ll be promoted. What about a sports-related revival of the old Off-Broadway musical “Forever Plaid?”\n\nMEASURING MEDIA MAYHEM\n\nWHAT SMOKES\n\n— Even before its release scheduled for Tuesday, “Caddyshack: The Making of a Hollywood Cinderella Story” (Flatiron Books, $26.99, 304 pages) by Entertainment Weekly film critic Chris Nashawaty has already reached top billing in several Amazon.com categories like “movie history & criticism” and “genre films,” perhaps inspired by an excerpt currently on SI.com.\n\n— The University of Nebraska women’s bowling team has made it to HBO’s “Real Sports”? Indeed. The next episode (Tuesday, 10 p.m.) brings in Mary Carillo to explain the dominance of this program as an NCAA-sanction championship-seeking event. Nebraska has won 10 national titles, five since 2003 when it was officially recognized by the NCAA. “Is Nebraska bowling perhaps the most unknown dynasty in all of sports?” Carillo asks coach Bill Straub, who responds: “I think the coaches are paid the least of any dynasty in sports, but that’s another issue.”\n\n— Fox Sports chief Eric Shanks would not comment earlier this week during an appearance at the CAA Sports Congress at LA Live about reports that his network will team up with ESPN on a joint deal to cover the UFC coming up. Variety had an exclusive story posted Tuesday, noting the UFC programming for ESPN would be for its new ESPN+ app that is continues to try to bolster as a $4.99 a month service launched a week ago.\n\nWHAT CHOKES\n\n— No doubt, there’s an abundant overload of TV coverage coming up on the NFL draft, starting with Fox’s foray into the mess from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, for Thursday’s Round 1, a simulcast of the NFL Network production. ESPN and ESPN2 also have live coverage, which morphs into ABC on the final day Saturday morning of Rounds 4-7 to apparently give the parent network some counter-programming for all the kids shows going on at the time and consider a way to make “Mr. Irrelevant” a new cartoon series. Who are we kidding? Anything related to the NFL seems to still be worth piling on if you’re a network way in over your head with rights fees. Winning the offseason is all part of the year-around business model now."
