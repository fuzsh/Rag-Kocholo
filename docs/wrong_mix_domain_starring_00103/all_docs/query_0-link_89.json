        "text": "Baseball is back and it’s a great time to watch some baseball movies! After not-so-patiently waiting Opening Day 2024 is now in the books. That means summer is just around the corner!\n\nTo celebrate the return of Major League Baseball, here are 5 of the greatest baseball movies of all-time!\n\n5 Of The Greatest Baseball Movies Of All-Time\n\nThere’s certainly no shortage of great baseball movies. It was incredibly difficult to make a list of the 5 best. That means we were leaving out some outstanding movies. Some of the ones that missed the list deserve to be on it. You also might disagree with some of the choices that made the list. Your opinion is valid. Let us know if we missed your favorite!\n\nIt seems like there are more baseball flicks available to watch than any other sport. Sure, football has a lot, too. There’s The Replacements, The Longest Yard, Any Given Sunday, and more. Those are some fantastic movies. There are also great basketball movies like Coach Carter, Hustle, and Space Jam (the original, of course). There’s only one movie on BASEketball. However, when it comes to sports movies baseball truly has some of the best.\n\nThere have been so many great baseball films over the years. Likewise, there have been many not-so-great baseball movies. Those can still be enjoyable! The Benchwarmers isn’t a great movie, but it’s watchable. Also, I never noticed how many baseball movies Kevin Costner stars in. What’s the deal with that? It’s like a crazy number, I didn’t realize he had such a love for the game. He starred in Chasing Dreams, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, For Love of The Game, and The Upside of Anger. I might even be missing some. That’s a good chunk of his resume devoted to baseball movies, I respect that.\n\nSome excellent movies didn’t make the list. So, I’ll have to quickly shoutout some Honorable Mentions before getting to the Top 5. A League of Their Own, 42, and The Rookie are all solid movies and are definitely worth watching. However, they didn’t make the list. I think the 5 that did are just better movies, personally. Here’s the list!\n\n5 Must-See Baseball Movies"
