        "text": "You already know him by ear, as the vocally limber virtuoso behind such Simpsons characters as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu, and Comic Book Guy. And you might recognize him as the buff, infrequently clothed Guatemalan houseboy in The Birdcage, or as the buff, infrequently clothed French scuba instructor in Along Came Polly—or, perhaps, as the ethically compromised F.B.I. agent who locked horns with Liev Schreiber’s title character in Ray Donovan. But this month Hank Azaria at last assumes deserved leading-man status in a live-action comedy program, namely IFC’s TV series Brockmire. Based on a 2010 Funny or Die short in which Azaria portrayed a regionally beloved baseball play-by-play man who suffered a spectacular fall from grace (involving his discovery of his wife’s infidelity, the ingestion of too much booze, and a profane over-the-air meltdown), the new show finds Jim Brockmire attempting to rebuild his life as the P.A. announcer for a Rust Belt minor-league team whose wily owner (played by Amanda Peet) sees Brockmire’s very unpredictability as a potential means of ginning up fan interest. Its dark barfly humor leavened by its central character’s deranged-yet-plausible patter (“Folks, that ball cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery because it just got tattooed!”), Brockmire is the Hank Azaria vehicle we’ve been waiting for. Herewith, some facts and insights gleaned from a breakfast with the man behind the mike.\n\nHE WAS born and raised in Forest Hills, Queens, and is therefore a long-suffering (but recently less so) New York Mets fan.\n\nHE AND his wife, Katie Wright Azaria, moved back to New York from Los Angeles three years ago, when their son, Hal, was four. “It’s kind of a joke when I say I moved mostly because I wanted to raise a Mets fan,” he says. “But it’s not totally a joke.”\n\nHE HAS been obsessed since childhood with the ineffable strangeness of the generic male broadcaster voice. “Not just sportscasters,” he says, “but also the guy who sold you the Ginsu knife, who gave you the disclaimers at the end of the commercials, ‘Batteries not included’—the vanilla ice cream of voices.”\n\nHE DEVELOPED Brockmire by toying with the premise of: What if that voice was put to malevolent or bizarre use? “It lets you get away with anything,” he says. “Any weird thing you want to say—’Last night I spent the greater portion of the evening with your mom, and oh, man, my goodness, is she a wild woman in the sack!’—as long as you give the count afterwards, no problem.”\n\nHE IS a full-blooded Sephardic Jew, with all four grandparents having immigrated in the early 20th century from either the Greek city of Salonika (known today as Thessaloníki) or the Turkish city of Izmir.\n\nHE IS proud to note that a “Rabbi Azaria” appears in the Passover Haggadah.\n\nHIS LATE father, Al, was a garmento who specialized in knockoffs of designer dresses. His mother, Ruth, who is 89, parlayed her fluency in Spanish and Ladino into a job doing publicity outreach for Columbia Pictures’ South American market.\n\nHE ATTRIBUTES his talent for mimicry to (a) watching lots of television alone as a latchkey child with two hardworking parents and two much older sisters who no longer lived at home; (b) growing up in an ethnically diverse enclave of New York City; and (c) picking up the street jive and crosstalk of Manhattan’s Garment District when he tagged along with his dad to work.\n\nHE RATES John Travolta’s body in Staying Alive higher than his own body in Along Came Polly, and his Along Came Polly body higher than his current, almost-53-year-old body.\n\nHE IS nevertheless nude in Brockmire, too. “I guess I’m assuming the Harvey Keitel mantle,” he says.\n\nHE IS an avid poker player, with a set of poker buddies on each coast. His New York set includes the actors Billy Crudup and Michael Cera, the playwright Eric Bogosian, and the screenwriter Andy Bellin.\n\nHE IS a graduate of the Kew-Forest School, unlike fellow Kew-Forest attendee Donald Trump, whose father packed him off to the New York Military Academy after the seventh grade.\n\nHE IS also an alumnus of Tufts University, and last year delivered its commencement address. In the voice of Moe the bartender, he told the graduates, “I didn’t have the benefit of a fancy, highfalutin education; I went to B.U.”\n\nHE IS a six-time Emmy Award winner—once for his work in Ray Donovan, once for playing Mitch Albom in the telefilm of Tuesdays with Morrie, and four times for The Simpsons. Though the Television Academy doesn’t make such distinctions, he reckons that two Simpsons Emmys belong to Moe, one to Apu, and another to Comic Book Guy.\n\nHIS MOST challenging Simpsons character to voice is Kirk Van Houten, the sad-sack divorcé father of Bart’s friend Milhouse—first, because it compels him to extrapolate an adult version of Milhouse’s voice, which is performed by the actress Pamela Hayden, and, second, because “Kirk has to be so raw emotionally so often.”"
