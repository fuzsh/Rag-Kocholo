The New York native said that he's always dreamed of playing The Boss and is excited to step on stage and sing his classics.\n\nThe band is called Hank Azaria and the EZ Street Band and they're located in New York City. According to Azaria, 60, the idea came about after he did an impression of Springsteen at a party earlier this year.\n\nShane MacGowan’s wife praises 'insanely brilliant' Bruce Springsteen tribute to her late husband\n\nBruce Springsteen visits traditional Irish pub before final concert on Ireland tour\n\nTaking to Instagram to share the news, Azaria said: \"Ever since I was 15 years old, I worked up a talking impression of Bruce Springsteen. I decided for my birthday party to work up a singing impression.\n\n\"It went so well that, by popular demand, we're playing our first ticketed gig. Come check us out, I sing just as good as I talk.\"\n\nThe concert will take place at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on August 1. The event will be ticketed but all of the money will go to Azaria's foundation, Four Through Nine, to support children's education.\n\nAzaria is an actor, comedian, and producer who has starred in a range of television shows and movies. His best known work is on The Simpsons as the voice of Chief Wiggum, Moe Szyslak, Comic Book Guy, Apu and Carl Carlson. He also starred in Dodgeball, The Smurfs, and Night at the Museum.\n\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here.\n\nAzaria has set up an Instagram account for his new band and said that additional tour dates would follow soon.\n\nSpringsteen might be a little busy to attend the gigs himself. The Boss is currently touring with his E Street Band, having just finished up a four-date leg in Ireland.\n\nBruce Springsteen joins the crowd to watch his own concert in Ireland\n\nBruce Springsteen pays touching tribute to Shane MacGowan at Irish concert\n\nOver 80,000 fans attended his gig at Croke Park in Dublin on May 19, where the Born to Run singer treated the crowd to a Shane MacGowan tribute and over three hours of hits.\n\nThe Boss also sang Christmas songs in Co Cork and joined the crowd behind the barriers in Co Kilkenny. He will return to the US in August after finishing the European leg of the tour."
