        "text": "Jason Biggs, Edie Falco and Hank Azaria have joined the producing team of “The White Chip,” a comedy that will premiere Off-Broadway in 2024. Described as a “wry and wild” journey, the story follows an alcoholic’s unusual path to sobriety.\n\nThey will work with the previously announced lineup of Annaleigh Ashford, John Larroquette (“Night Court”) and writer-activist Ryan Hampton. Ashford, who is currently starring in the Broadway revival of “Sweeney Todd” calls “The White Chip” an “essential, life-saving play.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\nDavid Byrne's Broadway Musical 'Here Lies Love' to Close Due to Low Ticket Sales\n\nAaron Tveit and Sutton Foster to Replace Josh Groban and Annaleigh Ashford in Broadway's 'Sweeney Todd'\n\nElle Fanning Making Broadway Debut in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' 'Appropriate'\n\n“Hank, Jason and Edie, all extraordinary artists, have so selflessly shared their stories of recovery with the public, so to have them join us in amplifying this play is a true honor,” she said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the new producers, the production has announced the final cast of Crystal Dickinson (“Clybourne Park”) and Jason Tam (“A Chorus Line”) and Joe Tapper (“You Can’t Take It With You”).\n\nThe story follows Steven (played by Tapper), who is on top of the world with his dream job as the head of an exciting theater company. But he’s also an alcoholic spinning out of control. The play follows his life from first sip to first love, all the way to rock bottom, where he begins his journey to recovery.\n\n“We are over the moon, too, that Crystal and Jason — both powerhouse talents — will join Joe onstage,” Ashford added. “We feel so lucky.”\n\n“The White Chip,” an autobiographical play by Sean Daniels, will be directed by Sheryl Kaller (“Next Fall,” “Mothers & Songs”). It will begin performances Off-Broadway at The Susan & Ronald Frankel Theater in The Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space on Jan. 22, 2024, with an opening night set for Feb. 1.\n\nAdditional producers include the nonprofit organization The Recovery Project, John Beyer, Linda Karns, Nick Mills and Barbara Manocherian.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nOscars Predictions: Animated Feature - Will Disney's Awards 'Wish' for Two Feature Film Nominees Come True?\n\nOscars Predictions: Original Score – Will Thomas Newman Garner His 16th Career Nom for 'Elemental?'"
