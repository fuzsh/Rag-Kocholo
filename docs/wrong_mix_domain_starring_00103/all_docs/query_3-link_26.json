        "text": "Post by starlightsfalls on\n\nIn January 2007, as a way to promote the upcoming Disney Channel Original Movie, High School Musical 2, Disney Channel had a series of poll questions on their website. This promotion was called High School Musical: Play Your Part. These polls were on www.DisneyChannel.com/HighSchoolMusical from January 12, 2007 to January 31, 2007. Unfortunately, due to the way Disney Channel’s website ran, this page cannot be easily accessed on the wayback machine. These questions impacted various things throughout the movie such as certain dialogue choices and props, as well as deciding one cameo appearance in the film.\n\nAccording to news articles from the time these polls were active, there were 10 questions. www.accessonline.com/articles/disney-invites-you-to-be-part-of-the-hsm-sequel-57571\n\nSeveral of the winners from the polls were revealed in “Wildcat Chat\" (www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYWHHW5Z-c), which aired during commercial breaks of the premiere of High School Musical 2. However, these clips only showed the answers to 7 of the poll questions, and did not show the losing options.\n\nFrom Wildcat Chat we know:\n\nPicnic Sandwich: Peanut Butter and Jelly\n\nChad’s T-Shirt: I Majored In Vacation\n\nU. of Alburquerque Mascot: Redhawks\n\nMs. Darbus’ Chalkboard: Turn off your cell phones.\n\nHannah Montana Cameo Star: Miley Cyrus\n\nWhat skateboarding trick will Troy teach Gabriella?: Twisted Flip\n\nWhat’s on Sharpay’s golf cart?: Vanity Mirror with Makeup Supplies\n\nFrom some articles around this time, there are two more poll questions that are known, but not the winning option.\n\nWhat type of dessert does Zeke bake for Sharpay? www.accessonline.com/articles/disney-invites-you-to-be-part-of-the-hsm-sequel-57571\n\nIn addition to the questions themselves, most of the graphics of the polls from the site have also not been archived. Because of this, we do not have access to the specific wording of the questions, just rephrasings from various reports. I was able to find a screenshot of the results page for 5 of the questions, but I'm new here and I dont know how to add the image.\n\nThere were also likely promos advertising these polls during commercial breaks on Disney Channel, however these do not seem to be archived either, or at least not easy to find.\n\nHere is a table of all the poll questions I've been able to find.\n\nQuestionWinning Option\n\nLosing Options\n\nPicnic SandwichPeanut Butter and JellyTurkey, Veggie Wrap, Lobster and Gorgonzola PaniniChad’s T-ShirtI Majored In VacationDo Not Operate Without Manual, Wake Me When It’s Over, Born To Sleep InU. of Albuquerque MascotRedhawksTumbleweeds, Settlers, RenegadesMs. Darbus’ ChalkboardTurn off your cell phones.Musicals rule!, Detention will resume in September., Have a great summer!Hannah Montana Cameo StarMiley CyrusJason Earles, Emily Osment, Billy Ray CyrusWhat skateboarding trick will Troy teach Gabriella?Twisted FlipWhat’s on Sharpay’s golf cart?Vanity Mirror with Makeup SuppliesWhat type of dessert does Zeke bake for Sharpay?What is Sharpay’s favorite drink?"
