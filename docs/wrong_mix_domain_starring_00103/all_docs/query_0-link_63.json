        "text": "The Broadway premiere of Aaron Sorkinï¿½s new American play about the advent of television, The Farnsworth Invention, will play its final performance this afternoon at the Music Box Theatre(2 Mar 2008.) The drama had been booking through to 30 Mar 2008. When the show closes it will have played 34 previews and 104 regular performances.\n\nThe play began previews at the Music Box Theatre on 15 Oct 2007, and was scheduled to open on 14 Nov 2007, but due to the strike on Broadway in Nov 2007, the play was forced to re-schedule its opening to 3 Dec 2007.\n\nThe Farnsworth Invention opened to mixed reviews: \"It is theater that both entertains and enlightens.\" (New York Theatre Guide); \"A fast-moving sequence of reflex-stimulating information- and emotion-bites. It never pauses long enough to find depth in any of them.\" (New York Times); \"Though the play is informative, it's seldom deeply involving.\" (New York Daily News); \"Vintage Sorkin and crackling prime-time theater. NewsDay); \"Dramaturgical laziness undermines even the most robust narrative.\" (Variety); \"A lively, extremely engaging new play.\" (The Record).\n\nDirected by two-time Tony Award winner Des McAnuff, The Farnsworth Invention stars Tony Award-nominee Hank Azaria as David Sarnoff, and Jimmi Simpson as Philo T. Farnsworth.\n\nThe play centres on the bitter conflict that pitted Philo T. Farnsworth (Jimmi Simpson), a boy genius who invented television as a high school student in 1927, against David Sarnoff (Hank Azaria), the head of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). The legal battle between Farnsworth and RCA would later become known as one of the great, tragic examples of legal and industrial force combining to crush a rightful patent owner. In a race that would change humanity forever, two men battle one another for honour, glory and a place in the history books.\n\nThe cast also features Nadia Bowers, Kyle Fabel, Maurice Godin, Adam Grupper, Christian McCarthy Johansen, Aaron Krohn, Kate MacCluggage, Bruce McKenzie, Malcolm Morano, Spencer Moses, Michael Mulheren, Jim Ortlieb, Michael Pemberton, Javier Picayo, Katharine Powell, Steve Rosen, James Sutorius, Margot White, Alexandra Wilson and William Youmans.\n\nThe Farnsworth Invention is produced on Broadway by Dodger Properties with Steven Spielberg, Dan Cap Productions, Fred Zollo, Latitude Link and the Pelican Group.\n\nThe creative team comprises Klara Zieglerova (sets), David C. Woolard (costume), Howell Binkley (lighting) and Walter Trarbach (sound)."
