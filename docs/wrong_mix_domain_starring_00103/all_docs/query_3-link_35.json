Troy Bolton can hardly believe his luck when he’s offered a job at Albuquerque’s posh country club, Lava Springs. What he doesn’t know is that his newfound employment is part of club queen Sharpay’s plot to lure him away from Gabriella. But that plan begins to unravel when Troy, unbeknownst to Sharpay, lands a lifeguard position at the club for Gabriella and the rest of his Wildcat pals. The club’s annual Midsummer Night’s Talent Show provides an opportunity for Troy and Gabriella to sing a duet, while the determined Sharpay plots to ensure they will not upstage her. Directed by Kenny Ortega. Stars Zac Efron (Troy Bolton), Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella Montez), Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay Evans), Lucas Grabeel (Ryan Evans), Corbin Bleu (Chad Danforth), Monique Coleman (Taylor McKessie), Mark Taylor (Mr. Fulton).
