The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) network announced on Tuesday that it is rebooting the popular television and film franchise, with work starting on casting High School Musical 4 this spring—just over a decade after the first TV movie debuted on the Disney Channel. The original installment’s airing, in 2006, spawned a hugely popular franchise that helped Disney pull in record-breaking television ratings, sold millions of soundtrack albums, and launched the careers of actors Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens.

Followed by the even more popular TV installment High School Musical 2, in 2007, the franchise also dominated the box office when Disney released the third film in theaters in 2008. Last month, the franchise’s stars gathered for a 10-year reunion to celebrate the first film and subsequent entries.

High School Musical is often credited with helping to pave the way for Glee, another popular TV musical set in a high school. Meanwhile, the musical format generally continues to flourish on television more than 10 years after the franchise debuted, with both Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBC and Fox (FOX) recently experimenting with airing live musical productions on primetime television. (Fox’s Grease adaptation even starred Hudgens and earned solid ratings and reviews last month.)
