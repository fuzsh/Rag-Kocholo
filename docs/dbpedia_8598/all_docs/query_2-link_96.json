        "text": "2015年9月19日\n\nOn the second day of my 8 days of Adventure in Kyoto I visited Nishi Honganji, a major Buddhist temple in downtown Kyoto, and Nijō Castle, another famed historical site nearby.\n\nBefore going to Nishi Honganji, I swung by Higashi Honganji again real quick since it was so close you could see its rooftops from the hotel window.\n\nAfter that I took a side street over to Nishi Honganji. The two temples are almost perfectly aligned with each other in the grid of Kyoto’s street plan. Nishi (“west”) being exactly to the west of Higashi (“east”). We saw a few interesting sites along the way.\n\n西本願寺 Nishi Hongan-ji\n\nIt wasn’t long before we reached Nishi Honganji, the Western Temple of the Original Vow, which is situated facing Horikawa-dori. The east and west temples represent a split in the Shin Buddhist sect ordered by the Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, in 1602 in order to reduce the influential power the sect had in the realm. The temple was founded in 1591.\n\nJust as with my first visit to Higashi Honganji, something interesting was going on at Nishi when we arrived. We entered the main hall and, again, many people were seated on the tatami-covered floors (oh! tatami are so nice!). In the front there were a group of priests kneeling on the ground in front of the alter chanting a long, sonorous prayer. The air was rich with the fragrance of incense. There were these little books on a table near the entrance. Upon opening the books, we found that it was a transcription of the prayer the priests were chanting, sort of like a church hymnal. At the front of the book was a list of all of the kanji (Chinese script characters) that were in the prayer, along with their proper reading (pronunciation). In the text of the prayer itself, the sing-along part, next to each kanji, was a little stroke which either pointed up, down, or straight, indicating the change in pitch for each utterance.\n\nThe prayer ended and people began filing out of the hall, and I continued exploring the temple complex. The two main halls were connected by a large walkway, which I believe I read was itself considered a national treasure.\n\nThere was also a tremendous, 400-year-old tree on the temple grounds. It was surrounded by a stone fence and had numerous posts installed to prop up its expansive and ancient limbs. This practice is extremely common in Japan. You’ll see old trees and tree limbs propped up in gardens and parks just about everywhere you go. I’ve seen walls and buildings built around trees here. In America, got an errant tree branch? Chop it down! Tree in the way of your privacy fence? Rip it out of the ground! Nope, not here.\n\n食堂 Shokudō\n\nAfter Nishi Honganji my friend and I were famished, so we looked around and found a little shokudō for lunch. A shokudō is like a cafeteria-style eating place where you slide your tray on down the line and pick what you want to eat. It’s cheap and easy, and there’s always free tea, so drink up.\n\nAt this shokudō I tried natto for the first time. Natto is fermented soybeans. I did not like natto. I found it . . . unpalatable. The flavor was not too bad, it came with a little mustard and shoyu (soy sauce) to add. It was the texture. I’ve never felt that kind of sliminess in my mouth, or anywhere else for that matter. It was truly strange. By all means, please try it for yourself before writing it off, I hear it’s good with rice. Lots and lots of rice.\n\n二条城 Nijō-jo\n\nNext we were on our way to Nijō-jo, or Nijō (“2nd Avenue”) Castle. This walled fortress was begun in 1601 by Tokugawa Ieyasu and completed in 1626 by Tokugawa Iemitsu, and was used by the Tokugawa Shoguns as their residence in Kyoto (Edo was the Shogunate’s capital). The complex is ringed by two moats, and contains the Ninomaru Palace, where affairs of state were handled, as well as a central keep within the second moat. It was here, in the Ninomaru Palace, that the last Shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, formally handed power back over to the Imperial Court in 1867.\n\nMuch to my disappointment I found that the main gate of the castle compound was robed in construction coverings, undergoing renovations, just as I had found at Higashi Honganji. Come on, Kyoto! It’s tourist season!\n\nInside the ring wall wasn’t so bad, however. The gate to the palace was quite extravagantly decorated with gold fittings and elaborately painted motifs featuring white cranes.\n\nThe Ninomaru Palace is a connected network of five buildings. You can take a tour through the palace, where they have descriptions of each room posted, and they even have some cool mannequins dressed up and arranged so you can see what it might have looked like while the Shogun was handling his business. You could not, however, take photographs. It was cool, though. I guess you’ll just have to go see for yourself.\n\nThe landscapes within the grounds were well manicured and there were nice pines and a pond with koi fish. There was a great stone stairway up to the top of the central tower location, but alas the castle keep burned down centuries ago, so at the top was nothing but a nice place to get a view of the area and to rest my legs on some benches.\n\nOn our way out of the castle complex we found a little rest area with restrooms, a couple of little shops selling tourist trinkets and even a little café. I was informed that the place resembled a typical countryside rest area. We ordered some coffee beverages and took a break before moving on to the next leg of our journey, which happened to be a trip to the shopping and entertainment areas of downtown Kyoto. I’ll tell you all about it in part two of day two of my 8 Days of Adventure in Kyoto! じゃあまた！\n\n終わり End\n\nIn this installment of Dave’s Japan I’ll bring you a taste of downtown Kyoto and one of the city’s major temples, Higashi Honganji. (It’s also worth noting that I finally broke out my real camera for this excursion.)\n\nI had one mission for the day: to find a wall outlet adaptor for my computer cable. Seems simple enough, right? Everyone directed me towards the big electronics super store by Kyoto Station, Yodobashi Camera, so that’s where I decided to go. I popped into a couple of konbini just to make sure they didn’t have one; that would make my mission simpler. But of course, no one had what I was looking for, so I went ahead down into the subway and on to Kyoto Station.\n\nThis time I found the underground shopping mall at Kyoto Station. Or, I should say, that I nearly got completely lost inside the underground shopping mall. This is where I thought I would find Yodobashi Camera, but I couldn’t find it anywhere. The station and mall were teeming with people.\n\nI finally found my way up to the surface and the main vestibule of the station, and I luckily ran into one of my dorm mates who directed me to Yodobashi Camera. It was an immense structure on the far side of the equally immense Kyoto Tower Hotel, the most iconic modern structure in the city.\n\nThe interior of Yodobashi Camera contained a mind-shattering array of every possible electronic device, and just about anything else you could think of. It was 5 or 6 floors of a buzzing, ringing, chattering, cacophony of electronic sounds, pop music, and promotional announcements.\n\nAfter I was done at Yodobashi Camera, I went out and grabbed an iced coffee at the Starbucks in Kyoto Tower, and took a seat on the street corner where I watched a stream of about 127 million people walk by as I sipped my cool beverage.\n\n東本願寺 Higashi Hongan-ji\n\nI soon realized that there was a sightseeing map posted directly in front of me indicating that there was a major Buddhist temple right up the street, so I decided to go there and take some photos.\n\nThe temple was Higashi Honganji, or the “Eastern Temple of the Original Vow.” The temple was founded in 1602 by Tokugawa Ieyasu (He’s the guy who started the Tokugawa Shogunate, the biggest, baddest Samurai lord ever). The temple is one of a pair, the other being the Western Temple of the Original Vow, or Nishi Honganji, and the two represent a split in the Shin Buddhist sect, which had been orchestrated by Ieyasu to reduce its political influence.\n\nIt was quite beautiful, although it was having major renovations or reconstruction done to it at the time, and so was somewhat less attractive than what it may normally be.\n\nInterestingly, there was some kind of formal service about to begin. There were a lot of Japanese people all dressed up in there nicest clothes sitting inside the main hall, and an announcer seemed to be taking roll. After the roll call everyone got up and headed out through a side exit. It seemed that it was a private affair (now that I think of it, it was perhaps a funeral service), so I took my leave and did not follow the group.\n\nAfter that I wandered somewhat aimlessly around the vicinity of Kyoto Station, taking a few more photos of the city.\n\nI eventually got back to the dorm and quickly discovered that indeed, the adaptor I bought would not fit with my cord. Disappointed, and with a dying laptop, I sat in silence and cracked open a can of chūhai. Chūhai is a carbonated beverage made of soda, fruit juice, and shōchū, a spirit made from grain or potatoes, a bit like vodka, but not as strong. I drank my chūhai as the sky turned from a drab gray into the cricket-filled black of night.\n\n終わり End"
