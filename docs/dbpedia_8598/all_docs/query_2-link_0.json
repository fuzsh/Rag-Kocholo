Japanese Buddhist temples usually have its honorific mountain name and the one for Hongwanji is Ryukokuzan. Therefore, the templeâs official name is Ryukokuzan Hongwanji, however, its nickname âNishi (lit., âwestâ) Hongwanjiâ is rather well known to people. The founder of the Jodo Shinshu teaching is Shinran Shonin (1173â1263) who lived in the early medieval period of Japan.\n\nOn the precincts of Hongwanji are the Amidado (Hall of Amida Buddha), Goeido (Founder's Hall), Karamon, Shoin, Hiunkaku and other structures, many of which have been designated as National Treasures and Important Cultural Assets of Japan. In addition, the Hongwanji received the designation as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1994 as part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto."
