        "text": "Located close to Kyoto Station, Nishi Hongan-ji Temple is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School. Although commonly referred to as Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, its official name is Ryukokuzan Hongan-ji Temple, and Kyoto residents often refer to it affectionately as ”Onishi-san.” The temple was first established as Otani Byodo (Otani Mausoleum) by Kakushinni, the daughter of a Buddhist monk, Shinran Shonin, in the Higashiyama area of Kyoto. The temple was transferred to its current location in Shichijo Horikawa in 1591 when Hideyoshi Toyotomi offered to give the land to the temple. The temple buildings and structures that exist today were either rebuilt after they were destroyed in the great fire of 1617 or transferred from Momoyama-jo Castle. The temple retains its architectural structures and gardens that were designed in the style of the Momoyama Period, such as Hiunkaku (Flying Cloud Pavilion) and Kara-mon gate, and many of them have been designated as Important Cultural Properties. In 1994, the temple was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as one of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto.\n\n・The Hall of Amida Buddha is where the temple's principle image of worship, Amida Nyorai, is enshrined\n\nThe Main Hall of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple is the Hall of Amida Buddha, which is a National Treasure. Rebuilt in 1760, the hall measures 42 meters east to west, 45 meters north to south, and 25 meters in height. A wooden statue of Amida Nyorai, the temple's principle image of worship, is enshrined in the center of the hall, flanked on either side by sculptures of six of the Seven Pure Land Masters from India, China and Japan: Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Tan-luan, Dao-chuo, Shan-dao, and Genshin. The side alcoves contain images of Honen Shonin and Prince Shotoku.\n\n*The inner sanctum is under construction until March 2022.\n\n・A wooden statue of Shinran Shonin is enshrined in Goeido (Founder's Hall)\n\nReconstructed in 1636 and significantly repaired in 2009, Goeido measures 48 meters east to west, 62 meters north to south, and 29 meters in height. A wooden statue of Shinran Shonin is enshrined in the center of the hall, flanked by images of past head priests throughout the history of Hongan-ji Temple. Due to the structure of the roof, the outer sanctum alone encompasses a space of 441 tatami mats (approximately 804 square meters). The hall has a capacity of 1,200 people, so all major services and ceremonies at Nishi Hongan-ji Temple are conducted in Goeido. It was designated as a National Treasure in 2014.\n\n・The magnificent decorations of Kara-mon Gate make visitors lose track of time\n\nOn the west side of the temple is Kara-mon Gate, a four-pillared gate made of cypress bark thatching. It is decorated with rich carvings in the style of the Momoyama Period. Different designs such as Chinese lions, dragons and qilins, in addition to peony flowers and pine trees, adorn the gate, adding vibrant colors to the black base. You can stare at it for hours, and indeed, the gate is sometimes called the ”All Day Gate” because people become so enchanted by its fine details that they lose track of time and stand there until the sun goes down. The gate is designated as a National Treasure.\n\n*Under construction until March 2022.\n\n・Hiunkaku (Flying Cloud Pavilion), located within a Place of Scenic Beauty, is one of Kyoto's three most famous pavilions\n\nThe three-story Hiunkaku is located within Tekisui-en Garden. It is said to be one of Kyoto's three most famous pavilions along with the Golden Pavilion at Kinkaku-ji Temple and the Silver Pavilion at Jisho-ji Temple. It is designated as a National Treasure."
