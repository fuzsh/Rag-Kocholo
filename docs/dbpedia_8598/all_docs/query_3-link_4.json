        "text": "The first opportunity to have your child encounter the Buddha Dharma is truly a joyous occasion. Like memorials and other Buddhist services and ceremonies, celebrating happy events such as the birth of a baby, admission to or graduation from schools, and coming-of-age, are also recommended as auspicious opportunities that allow you and others to encounter and appreciate more deeply Amida Buddha's teaching in daily life.\n\nAt Hongwanji, the infant rite is conducted in the worship halls which entail the offering of incense, a commemorative photo, signing in the Hongwanji Infant Rite memorial book, and the presentation of a commemorative gift.\n\n(Ceremony length: approximately 30 minutes)\n\nAdvance appointment is required."
