You cannot enter the stage but you can catch a glimpse of it as you tour the buildings. Unfortunately for me, photography is also prohibited.\n\nHere, you can also see the Hinkaku or Flying Cloud Pavilion, a beautiful three-storey building. The Flying Cloud Pavillion together with the Golden and Silver Pavillions, are collectively known as Kyoto's 'Three Great Pavillions'. Entry is not permitted, but photography fortunately is.\n\nOut of the structures/monuments you can enter or get closer to some stood out to me more than others:\n\nthe Karamon - a beautifully decorated 16th-century four-pillar gate made me think I was back at the Imperial Palace.\n\nThe Founder's Hall (Goeido), built in 1636, is one of Kyoto's largest wooden buildings\n\nThe Great Ginko Tree - a 400-year-old tree designated as a Natural Monument of Kyoto.\n\nHow long does it take to visit Nishi Hongangi?\n\nYou can easily spend 1 to 2 hours seeing everything this beautiful temple has to offer.\n\nIt is quite close to Kyoto Station and it's not as crowded as other temples, so if you only have a couple of hours to spare, you might want to consider a quick visit to this fascinating place.\n\nHave you ever been there? If so, I would love to hear about your visit there, in the comments below.\n\nIf you like this post or found it useful or entertaining, please click on the little heart below."
