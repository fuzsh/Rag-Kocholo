        "text": "Collections: Contents and Access\n\nThe Otani expeditions returned to Japan with a collection of ancient manuscripts, woodslips, wall paintings, sculptures, silk paintings, textiles, coins, seals, nine mummies and archaeological documentation. The items originally went to Kyoto’s Nishi Honganji Monastery but were later moved to Villa Niraku at the foot of the Rokko mountain in Kobe, where they were also organized. With respect to the categorization, organization and dispersal of this collection, please see Fujieda 1989, Kudara 1996 and Katayama 1999 (see bibliography below). Below are some of the most important items within the collection.\n\na) Chinese Buddhist sutras\n\nThe Otani expedition excavated a large number of sutras from the remains of a Buddhist monastery in Turfan and elsewhere. Below are some representative items from this collection.\n\na Western Jin manuscript of the Buddhasaṃgītisūtra (T.810) dated to 306 (present location unknown);\n\na manuscript of the Lotus Sutra (translated by Kumarajiva in 406) dated to 411;\n\na manuscript of chapter 21 of the Lotus Sutra (presently in the Ryukoku University collection);\n\na manuscript of the Mahaprajnaparamita Upadesa (Treatise of the Great Perfection of Wisdom) translated by Kumarajiva (405);\n\nthe famous first dated paper manuscript called the ‘Li Bo document’ from 328.\n\nb) Non-Chinese documents\n\nThe Central Asian sites yielded many documents in languages other than Chinese, including Buddhist sutras written in Sanskrit using the Brahmi script, Buddhist sutras and Manichaean documents in Sogdian, Tibetan, Tangut, and Uighur. For example, among the Buddhist works belonging to the Pure Land Sect, the collection includes an Uighur translation of the Kanmuryoujukyou (Contemplation on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life) Sutra.\n\nc) Art and historical material\n\nIn this respect, the third expedition proved to be the most important one. The explorers excavated ancient tombs in Astana and Gaochang, extracting nine mummies and collecting many burial objects and ancient documents used during the funeral.\n\nIn 1914, Count Otani, having taken responsibility for a bribery scandal, resigned as the abbot of the Nishi Honganji Monastery. As a result, he had difficulties continuing his explorations in Central Asia and the collections were dispersed to China, Korea, and Japan. After his resignation, Otani shifted his base to the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Lüshun. About this time, part of the collection from Villa Niraku was shipped to the Otani Villa in Lüshun. After that, some of these objects were shipped back to Japan, The Buddhist sutras and statues remaining in the villa were later transferred to the Kantocho Museum (present-day Lüshun Museum). Following this in 1954, 620 items from this collection, including the Dunhuang manuscripts, were transferred to Beijing Library (the present-day National Library of China), while the fragments of Buddhist paintings were transferred to the Chinese Museum of History in Beijing. A sizable collection remained in the Villa Niraku in Kobe. The villa and its collection was subsequently sold to Fusanosuka Kuhara. Kuhara later presented the collection as a gift to Terauchi Masatake, an old friend, who was then Governor-General of Korea, and it was housed in the Korean Government General Museum (now in the National Museum of Korea, Seoul).\n\nBeside these, some of the artefacts, photographs, botanical specimens and mummies brought back by the Japanese expeditions have gradually been sold into private and public collections both in Japan and abroad. Consequently, the Japanese collection, unlike famous collections in other countries, is to a large degree divided between public institutions and private collectors. Moreover, in the case of Japanese collections, the exact origin and history of the material is not always clear. Generally speaking, the different owners attached their own seal impression or made some other marking on the item, or mounted it in some patrticular way.\n\nMain location of the Otani Collections\n\nLüshun Museum, China: material from Turfan, including 16,035 Buddhist manuscript fragments, non-Chinese documents and various art objects. See Chinese Collections.\n\nChinese Museum of History. See Chinese Collections.\n\nNational Library of China: 621 Dunhuang scrolls moved from Lüshun Museum. See Chinese Collections.\n\nNational Museum of Korea: c. 2,000 art objects, including wall paintings. See Korean Collections.\n\nIn Japan, items from the Otani expeditions are housed in Ryukoku University, Tokyo National Museum, and Kyoto National Museum. Other museum and libraries have material from Central Asia acquired elsewhere. These are listed below.\n\nCentral Asian Collections in Japan\n\n1. Ryukoku University\n\n1.1 The Otani Collection at Ryukoku University\n\nAmong the artefacts from the Otani expeditions that were dispersed in Japanese and foreign collections, a portion is currently located in the Omiya Library of the Academic Information Centre, Ryukoku University.\n\nIn 1949, a year after the death of Count Kozui Otani at the age of seventy-three, artefacts filling two wooden boxes were discovered at the Villa Niraku and were donated to Ryukoku University. Beside precious manuscript material (scrolls, booklets, separate folios, and wooden slips), the boxes received by the University contained printed documents, silk paintings, textiles, plant specimens, coins, rubbings, and archeological documentation. Together, these nine thousand items came to be known as the Otani Collection at Ryukoku University. The Dunhuang and Silk Road collection consists of the following four groups:\n\n(a) Eight thousand odd items from the Otani expeditions discovered after the death of Kozui Otani in two wooden boxes at the Nishi Honganji Monastery;\n\n(b) Fifty-five items donated from the Tachibana collection;\n\n(c) Painting fragments and 166 photographs from the Yoshikawa collection;\n\n(d) Items acquired from other sources.\n\n1.1.1 Material written in Chinese\n\nOne of the objectives of the Otani expeditions was the collection of Buddhist scriptures, therefore the Japanese explorers were particularly interested in sites yielding large quantities of manuscript material, such as the Buddhist sites of Kucha and Turfan, as well as the Dunhuang caves.\n\n(a) Manuscript material\n\nThe Dunhuang documents were obtained when Tachibana and Yoshikawa visited Dunhuang during the third Otani expediton in 1912. Although large numbers of documents had already been purchased by Stein (1907) and Pelliot (1908), Tachibana was still able to acquire over three hundred items, including important finds such as the Lotus Sutra (fifth century) and the first volume of the Muryoujukyo sutra (sixth century).\n\n(b) Secular documents\n\nAmong the secular material there are documents of land administration (fragments related to giving, requesting, and returning land in Turfan) and economic affairs (Oda 1984,1990).\n\nAmong the main items in the collection are the aforementioned ‘Li Bo document’ and a scroll (718) acquired by Yoshikawa in Dunhuang during the third expedition, which represents part of the Bencao jizhu xulu, often called the ancestor of Chinese pharmacology. The fragments gathered by the Otani expeditions in the cemetery complexes near Turfan originally were discarded administrative documents recycled to be used at funerals.\n\n1.1.2 Non-Chinese material\n\nThe non-Chinese material consists of two major categories: religious documents (Manichaean scriptures, Nestorian Christian texts) and secular documents with social and economic content (contracts, receipts and expenditures, correspondence). The Ryukoku University collections contains texts written in 15 different languages (including Sanskrit, Tokharian, Sogdian, Khotanese, Turkic, Uighur; Tangut, Mongolian, and Tiibetan) using thirteen different scripts (including Brahmi, Kharosthi, Sogdian, Manichaean, and Uighur).\n\nRepresentative items include the Kharosthi wood slips (found in Turfan; ca. fifth century), fragments of an illustrated Uighur copy of the Sudana Jataka (found in Turfan; ca. thirteenth–fouteenth century), and a Khotanese copy of the Book of Zambasta written in the Brahmi script (found in Turfan; ca. eighth-ninth century) (Kudara_1996).\n\n1.1.3 Burial Items\n\nThe Astana and Gaochang cemeteries in the Turfan area yielded several silk paintings which decorated the ceiling and walls of the tombs. These include four variations of the Fuxi-Nüwa diagram. All of them were obtained by Yoshikawa in 1912 during the third expedition.\n\n1.1.4 Art objects, archaeological documentation, plant samples, textiles\n\nArt objects in the collection include a statue head, Buddha tiles, silk paintings, and stamped images.\n\n1.1.5 Other\n\nNishi Honganji Monastery\n\nIn addition to the above material which was brought over from the Nishi Honganji Monastery, there are also other items donated to the collection by Tachibana, Yoshikawa, Nomura and their descendants. These items include expedition equipment, survey diaries, notes (sketches, watercolours, maps), letters, and photographs, all of which provide an important witness to the conditions during the expeditions.\n\nMoreover, Ryukoku University and the National Ethnographic Museum houses the ethnographic and other material collected during the Indo-Tibetan survey, which was carried out by Aoki Bunkyo and Tada Tokan in parallel with the Central Asian expeditions.\n\n1.2 Access to the Collections\n\nOmiya Library\n\n125–1 Daikutcho\n\nOmiya Higashihairu\n\nShichijo-dori\n\nShimogyo-ku\n\nKyoto\n\nJapan 600–8268\n\nRyukoku University Website\n\nIn order to use the collection, readers are required to make an appointment in advance.\n\n2. The National Museum, Tokyo\n\nThe Tokyo National Museum comprises four buildings in the Ueno Park built on the old site of the Kaneiji Temple. The oldest building, which was completed in 1909, is used to display an architectural exhibit. The central building, completed in 1937, houses Japanese art. The Treasure House was built in 1964 for a collection of 319 items of seventh century art from the Nara Horyuji Temple. The fourth building was completed in 1968 and today it is used to display Asian art, Chinese calligraphy, and Central Asian art. The museum is one of three National Museums (the others being in Kyoto and Nara) and holds a collection of 88,000 items.\n\nAll the items from the Otani expeditions were purchased in 1964 by the Japanese Society for the Preservation of Culture and were moved to the Tokyo National Museum in 1967. The collection consists of archaeological objects excavated at various sites in Xinjiang, Chinese and Uighur manuscripts and woodslips from Turfan, Dunhuang and other sites; and paintings excavated at Dunhuang and Turfan. The museum also houses a few items under an exchange agreement with the Guimet Museum. Moreover, there are also several Central Asian items acquired from other sources.\n\nFor a long time, part of the Villa Niraku collection had been kept at the Imperial Gift Museum of Kyoto (today’s National Museum of Kyoto), before it was transferred, at the end of World War II, to Kimura Shinzo. After that, the state had acquired the collection and now it is housed in the Oriental Collection (Toyokan) at the National Museum of Kyoto. Among the items there is an image of a winged apsaras, a painting of Buddha teaching the law (from Kizil), a standing Bodhisattva holding a parasol (from Bezeklik), and a bodhisattva head.\n\nAccess to the collections\n\n13–9 Ueno Park\n\nTaito-ku\n\nTokyo 110–8712\n\nThe Tokyo National Museum Website\n\nA portion of the collection is on permanent display at the Central Asian Gallery.

The National Museum, Kyoto\n\nThe museum was founded as the Imperial Museum of Kyoto in 1897. It was renamed ‘Kyoto Royal Museum’ in 1900 and in 1924 was given to the city of Kyoto as ‘Imperial Gift, Kyoto Museum’. In 1952 it became a National Museum under its present name.\n\nThe main exhibition hall was built in 1895, designed by Toguma Katayama. The new exhibition hall was completed in 1966. The new hall houses the permanent collections from Japan and East Asia, while special exhibitions are held in the older hall. There is a permanent gallery of calligraphy and also of Buddhist paintings. The museum has a collection of about 4,000 items, with an additional 6,000 items from temples and other places in its custody.\n\nKyoto National Museum holds Dunhuang and Turfan documents formerly in the Matsumoto and Moriya collections. The former consists of five items mounted on four scrolls said to come from the Kucha region and the latter seventy-two manuscripts reportedly from Dunhuang.\n\nThe collection includes five fragments, mounted onto four scrolls, of a Chinese translation of the Lotus Sutra, the Mahaprajnaparamita Upadesa, the Dazhidulun, the Dapin Sutra and the Upasaka.\n\nAccess to the collections\n\n527 Chayamachi\n\nHigashiyama-ku\n\nKyoto 605–0931\n\nKyoto National Museum Website\n\nThe manuscripts are not on display but may be seen by prior appointment in writing.\n\n4.

It therefore aimed to buy old books and artefacts from China and Japan. In 1907, the institution purchased the entire collection of a Qing bibliophile which included Song and Yuan printed books, and this formed the foundation of the collection.

He made a collection of Chinese artefacts and manuscripts, ranging from Shang dynasty bronzes to Qing costumes, but his collection of seals is most renowned. Yurinkan has a collection of about one hundred manuscripts from Silk Road sites. Sixty pieces were originally in the collection of He Yansheng, the Qing official responsible for transporting the manuscripts from Dunhuang to Peking, and there are other Dunhuang manuscripts from other sources. In addition, Yurinkan has twenty-seven documents in languages other than Chinese, twenty-three in Uighur, but also Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit.\n\nAccess to the Collections\n\nEnshoji-cho 44\n\nOkazaki\n\nSakyo-ku\n\nKyoto 606–8344\n\nThe museum is open on the first and third Sunday of each month from 12 noon to 3pm.

Other Collections\n\nApart from the above, there are also about fourteen manuscripts in the Daitokyu Memorial Library in Tokyo, eleven in the Oriental Institute at Tokyo University, four at the Otani University, along with another thirty-four from the Otani collections. There are also manuscripts in private collections. There are, for example, the forty Dunhuang manuscripts from the collection of Kiyono Kenji, a famous collector in Kyoto before the Second World War, which today are owned his descendants. One of the largest collections in Japan is still hidden. The Haneda Memorial Hall at Kyoto University has photographs of seven hundred Dunhuang scrolls made by the late Professor Haneda which are still owned by an unnamed corporation in Osaka."
