Amazon offers used, discounted books which are very affordable.

Let's have a jab at this.... Any questions? Call me, Mary Matsuda, at (808) 271-2655 or email me at This email address is being protected from spambots.

Let’s explore the essence of this work:\n\nOverview:\n\nTitle: River of Fire, River of Water: An Introduction to the Pure Land Tradition of Shin Buddhism\n\nAuthor: Dr. Taitetsu Unno\n\nPublication Date: April 13, 1998\n\nLanguage: English\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nLength: 272 pages\n\nRating: 4.7 (based on 120 ratings)\n\nContent:\n\nDr. Unno introduces readers to Pure Land Buddhism, which is the most popular form of Buddhism in Japan. Unlike Zen or Tibetan traditions, Pure Land Buddhism was practiced by common people, making it harmonious with daily life. Its goal, like other Buddhist schools, is the awakening of the true self.\n\nThe book covers topics such as the conspiracy of good, nonduality, interdependence, impermanence, unrepeatable life, and the view of death withing the context of Shin Buddhism.\n\nSignificance:\n\nRiver of Fire, River of Water enriches the understanding of Pure Land Buddhism for both beginners and those already familiar with the tradition.\n\nDr. Unno’s spiritual insight and scholarship contribute to the growing practice of Buddhism in the United States.\n\nThis work stands alongside other influential books in the field of Buddhism, such as Three Pillars of Zen, The Miracle of Mindfulness, and Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind1. If you’re curious about the path of awakening and the interplay of spirituality with everyday life, this book offers valuable insights.\n\nFor those interested, you can explore the book on platforms such as The Maida Center (link in right margin), Amazon, Rakuten Kobo, and eBooks.com.\n\nSelect Sunday Service videos are on YouTube, Kaneohe Higashi Hongwanji, clickhere.\n\nFor an archive of past services, click archive.\n\nThe Maida Center of Buddhism (link in right margin)\n\nThe Maida Center is an excellent resource for Shin Buddhism. Their website includes articles by the Center's Director, Dr. Nobuo Haneda; their newsletter, THE DHARMA BREEZE; and the availability of books and lecture videos on Shin Buddhism.\n\n{Please note that temple services and activities listed are subject to governmental directives for public health.\n\nPlease call 808-247-2661 with questions}\n\nWe are grateful for your DANA donations so this temple may continue to serve as your DOJO (place to learn); Kaneohe Higashi Hongwanji, 45-520 Keaahala Road, Kaneohe, HI 96744\n\nAbout Kaneohe Higashi Hongwanji\n\nThe Kaneohe Higashi Hongwanji temple was established in 1924 to serve the residents of Kaneohe and continues to serve a broader community. While the Kaneohe Higashi Hongwanji temple is located on the Windward side of Oahu, its membership includes residents of other parts of the island, California, Nevada, and Washington state.\n\nBuddha's teachings by virtue of its transcendental nature were for a long time limited only to the educated and the elite and therefore beyond the comprehension of the common masses. Shinran Shonin, the founder of our sect(Jodo Shinshu orShin Buddhism)of Pure Land Buddhism, made Buddha's teachings understandable to the masses and showed us how the teachings are relevant to our daily lives.\n\nWhile many people think of Buddhism only as it is related to death, on the contrary, Jodo Shinshu emphasizes how each of us can make the best of our lives here and now.\n\n♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦"
