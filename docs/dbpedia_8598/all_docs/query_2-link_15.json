        "text": "As its name suggests, Nishi Hongan-ji is the western Hongan-ji. It is the smallest of the two temples, and the one offering more intimacy, despite a relatively wide outdoor space, and furthermore, not favored by tourists.\n\nNishi was actually the first Hongan-ji in Kyoto, after its transfer from Osaka in 1591. In 1602, famous shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu had Jodo-Shinshu sect's head temple split in two, and Higashi Hongan-ji was founded a couple of hundred of meters away. Both underwent a fire üî• in 1617, but Nishi Hongan-ji was spared from most of the damages. Therefore, most of the current constructions are still those built in the 17th century, allowing them to be listed as National Treasures of Japan.\n\nSeveral pavilions stand in the temple‚Äôs grounds:\n\nGoei-do (dedicated to Shinran Shonin, its founder), or Founder‚Äôs Hall, achieved in 1636 and with impressive dimensions: 62 meters long, 48 meters wide and 29 meters height;\n\nAmida-do (dedicated to Bouddha Amida), almost as large (45 x 42 x 25 meters) rebuilt in 1760 after a fire;\n\nDaisho-in, a reception hall for the monks, with tatami floored rooms,\n\nShoro, the small tower in the north-east, that shelters the temple‚Äôs bell (1620) ;\n\nand Kara-mon, a great gate with magnificent 16th century architecture, that remains closed.\n\nMost of the rooms are decorated with beautiful lanterns üèÆ, sliding doors, old wooden floorings, and several other ornaments wonderfully preserved (some are said to be parts retrieved from Fushimi Castle üèØ), that give the place a really inspiring atmosphere. A splendid gingko tree revealing marvelous golden colors in autumn üçÅ is said to have been growing in the temple‚Äôs grounds for four centuries."
