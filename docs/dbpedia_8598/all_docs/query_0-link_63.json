        "text": "This paper presents some observations on how the borders between the religious and the secular are perceived, blurred and reinterpreted at the community level in Kyoto. These reflections are based mainly on my extended fieldwork in the city, where I participated in and took note of the activities of two chōnaikai (neighborhood associations). I also observed and examined events related to the Gion matsuri, which takes place in July and is one of the three main festivals in Japan. The neighborhood associations play a pivotal role in Kyoto’s community life, and the boundaries between the religious and the secular very often remain indistinct due to the ambiguous character of the chōnaikai. In this context, I analyze some of the religious activities within the chōnai, such as taking care of the small votive shrine dedicated to the bodhisattva Jizō, and events related to Shintō. With regard to local festivals, I explore religious and secular aspects of the Gion matsuri, an event that attracts crowds of visitors from all over Japan and abroad, which offers the opportunity to investigate the intermingling of religion and business, local government, culture and tourism. The paper can be accessed through: https://brill.com/view/journals/jrj/1/1/article-p83_6.xml\n\nIn this paper, I analyze Gion Matsuri in Kyoto as a multilayered phenomenon, and explore its religious aspects in context, with particular attention to interactions between actors, such as its organizing bodies, residents of the neighborhoods that sponsor the yama and hoko floats, the local government, and Yasaka Shrine (Yasaka Jinja 八坂神社). Based on my extended fieldwork, I focus on the festival's most recent transformations (esp. the reinstatement of ato matsuri in 2014) and the negotiation of religious and secular boundaries, both within and without the festival's physical spaces. I also reflect on Gion Matsuri as a \"contested zone,\" an idea that contributes to opening up new perspectives for the study of this and other festivals. More broadly, my analysis aims to shed light not only on the multidimensional character of Gion Ma-tsuri, but also on the interplay of religion with different arenas of contemporary society, including local communities and government, tourism, the economy, and cultural policies . https://brill.com/view/journals/jrj/9/1-3/jrj.9.issue-1-3.xml\n\nFollowing the Second World War the policy separating state and religion meant that many long-running and traditional festivals in Japan had to change their structure to fit with the new guidelines. Many festivals were cancelled, and those that remained put more emphasis on the connection with neighborhood associations. In this way neighborhood festivals continued, but the connection to the local shrine was reduced. However, in recent years the influence of religion in neighborhood festivals has increased, and organizers are no longer subject to strict guidelines separating state and religion. This paper looks at research conducted into a neighborhood festival in Tokyo in which there is a strong hierarchical dichotomy between the teams representing the commercial districts of the town, and the team representing the local shrine. As such, the festival can be said to be separated motivationally along religious lines, with the merchant’s association teams hoping to bring business to the area, and the shrine based team hoping to appease the neighborhood god. This divide is further emphasized through the hierarchical organization of the teams and team members, with both sides vying for stature in the festival. The aim of this paper is to analyze the challenges this situation has created, and investigate the effect of the spiritual/secular dichotomy and the associated hierarchy on both the festival and its participants.\n\nThis article explores self-representational strategies employed by the two major branches of Shin Buddhism, the Honganji-ha and Ōtani-ha, for proselytization and self-promotion. In particular, it takes into account an important religious event, the 750th memorial for Shinran, who is acknowledged as the founder of this tradition, which will take place in 2011-2012. This event is explored through the institutions’ employment of new visual media linked to popular culture and slogans as ways for conveying their teachings. The slogans chosen on this occasion by the Honganji-ha and Ōtani-ha are analyzed in their historical and doctrinal developments in order to shed light on how religious institutions adapt communication strategies to social and economic changes and react to times of crisis. Self-representational strategies emerge as attempts by religious institutions to reach a large audience of followers and possibly to acquire new adherents. At the same time important religious ceremonies are significant for the institutions to reflect, maintain, and possibly enhance their own religious authority.\n\nThe need manifested by Japanese Buddhist organizations to present themselves as “modern” forces that are relevant to present-day society seems to be central in shaping their communication strategies. In this regard, one interesting aspect is represented by religious institutions’ attempts to “brand” themselves to enhance their profiles and visibility, specifically by drawing on popular culture formats. Based on fieldwork in Japan, I examine the use made by Japanese Buddhist institutions of these formats in their attempt to revive Buddhism and make its teachings attractive to an audience greater than the elderly parishioners who still maintain contact with their temples, mainly for funerary rites and other memorial rituals related to the ancestors.
