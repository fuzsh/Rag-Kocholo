Both temples form the headquarters of the Jodo-Shinshu (Pure Land Buddhism) sect. The temples are dating back to the 16th century. Nishi Honganji has the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the main hall (Goei-do) of the Higashi Hinganji is the largest wooden building in Kyoto and one of the largest in the world. Part of the Higashi Hinganji temple is the nearby beautiful Shosei-en Garden. In 1641 Shogun Iemitsu Tokugawa (1604 – 1651) donated this property.
