This temple serves as the headquarters of the Hongan-ji Branch of the Jodo (Pure Land) School of Buddhism. It is a Unesco World Heritage Site and features some beautiful National Treasures — the Shoin Room and the Karamon Chinese Gate.\n\nWhile it is an impressive site, it is not at the top of my Must-See list (there are just so many other sites I would recommend first). But if you do visit this site, don’t miss the beatiful garden and Japan’s oldest Noh Theather stage."
