        "text": "This article explores two significant Buddhist temples in Los Angeles’s Little Tokyo, the Nishi Hongwanji, and the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Churches. The study’s methodology is inspired by Yi-Fu Tuan’s humanistic geography, whose work explores the relationship between environment and human subjective experience. As the majority of 20th-century Japanese immigrants were Buddhists, a closer look at the temples helps explicate the dynamic between Buddhist belief and its architectural expression. This article takes the concept of a binary as its framework. It explores Little Tokyo in terms of the sacred and profane, the inner and outer, and the vertical and the horizontal vis-à-vis two Buddhist temples. The argument here is that these dualities resolve into one holistic experience with respect to the formation of memory, history, and religious faith.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Special Places, Sacred Spaces\n\nT2 - Two Traditional Buddhist Temples in Nihonmachi Los Angeles\n\nAU - Gordon, Robert E.\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: © The Author(s) 2019.\n\nPY - 2021/11\n\nY1 - 2021/11\n\nN2 - This article explores two significant Buddhist temples in Los Angeles’s Little Tokyo, the Nishi Hongwanji, and the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Churches.
