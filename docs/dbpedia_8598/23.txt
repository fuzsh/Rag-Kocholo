About Nishi Hongan-ji Temple

Nishi Hongan-ji Temple is simply referred to as the Honganji temple, and is the Honzan of Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji Temple sect. Nishi Honganji is a common name, the official name is Ryukoku mountain Hongan-ji. The name of the neighboring Ryukoku University seems to come from here, too. Nishi Hongan-ji temple is also called “Onishisan” from Kyoto citizens. It is said that it was in 1591 that it was built in the present place.

As well as the East Hongan-ji Temple, the site area is also large, huge and majestic main hall is very impressive. The ginkgo tree planted in the precincts is also majestic. In addition, since the Temple of East and West Honganji is not made up of tourist income, there is no admission fee.

When you come to Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, I think it is good to see the Kosho temple which is adjacent to the south together, too. On the day I took pictures, there was an exhibition of chrysanthemum flowers.
