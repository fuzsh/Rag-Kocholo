Fatih Terim has stepped down as Turkey coach after allegedly being caught up in a 'restaurant brawl' two weeks ago.

The former Fiorentina, AC Milan and Galatasaray boss managed his national side for 11 years across three spells.

Terim, 63, found himself in hot water earlier this month when he and his bodyguards reportedly left five men injured.

Confirming his departure, the Turkish Football Federation said: "Some non-football issues have been wearing out our football director Fatih Terim and the management of TFF.

"The two sides agreed that it would be more healthy for both parties to part ways."

Terim’s son-in-law Ahmet Baran Cetin, who owns the Beeves Steakhouse in the Turkish beach resort Alacati, has repeatedly clashed with the neighbouring Yuzevler restaurant over a partition wall.

The kebab diner is owned by Selahattin Aydogdu, the former president of Adana Demirspor and a Turkish FA director.

Adana-born Terim came through Demirspor’s youth ranks and spent five years in the first team before joining Galatasaray in 1974.

Reports in Istanbul claim chairs and punches were thrown in a late-night brawl that left Aydogdu and four of his staff needing hospital treatment.

Restaurant worker Abdurrahim Baysal said: "I was cleaning the oven after midnight when I heard shouting.

"Terim and four or five other people were trying to attack the owner and throwing chairs around. Someone hit me and the police were called.

"I want Terim and the people with him to be arrested and punished."

Aydogdu's son Ugur added: "Terim phoned my dad and threatened him. Six men arrived from Bodrum and they punched him."
