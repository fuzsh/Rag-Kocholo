Anadolu Agency are reporting that former AC Milan manager Fatih Terim has tested positive for the coronavirus. The legendary coach from Turkey is currently in his 4th stint with Galatasaray . The 66 year old is currently admitted in hospital but sent encouraging messages on Twitter saying, “Don’t worry. See you in the shortest time...” Terim managed Milan for about 5 months in 2001 with the 'total football’ attacking philosophy. He managed 8/13 wins in his brief spell. He had two key accomplishments in that period, firstly, he brought the famous Rui Costa to Milan from Fiorentina setting the stage for future successes and he managed Milan in a famous 4-2 derby victory against Inter Milan where Milan scored 4 goals in the second half including a Sheva brace.

The report comes weeks after Terim outlined the danger of the decision for football in Turkey to go ahead behind closed doors despite the spread of the coronavirus in the country. The decision taken by the Federation has definitely impacted Galatasaray as an executive alongside the manager have contracted the coronavirus.
