Fatih Terim, the renowned Turkish coach, is leaving Panathinaikos after a season, citing misalignment in future plans.

Turkish football expert Fatih Terim (70) will part ways with Panathinaikos at the end of this season, the Greek football club announced.

"Panathinaikos announces the end of our collaboration with coach Fatih Terim. The Turkish expert led our team in 26 matches, achieving 14 wins, six draws, six losses, and securing a place in the Greek Cup final," Panathinaikos stated.

Terim also confirmed the departure on social media: "Our plans for the next season did not align," said Terim, who took over the Athens club in December last year.

Throughout his career, Terim has had four stints, totaling 12 years, with Galatasaray, led the Turkish national team three times, and also managed Milan, Fiorentina, Ankaragücü, and Göztepe.
