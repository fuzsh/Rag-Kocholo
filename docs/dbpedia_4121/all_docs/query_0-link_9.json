        "text": "The Emperor’s palace is on a hill just to the north of Istanbul, overlooking the Bosphorus.\n\nFatih Terim is Turkish football. It’s difficult to come up with an equivalent figure in the English game because there isn’t. He defines football in Turkey, certainly over the last 30 years, more than anyone else has in any other country.\n\nHe has been the Turkish national team manager three times. He took them to Euro ’96, their first major tournament since 1954 (and given they made that World Cup thanks to the drawing of lots, effectively their first-ever qualification), and to the semi-finals of Euro 2008.\n\nHe has managed Galatasaray, the biggest and most successful club in the country, four times. With them he’s won the Turkish Super Lig eight times (a record), the Turkish Cup three times and remains the only manager to win a European trophy with a Turkish club, when they beat Arsenal in the 2000 UEFA Cup final.\n\nHe has loomed over the game in Turkey for the better part of 30 years. His nickname — Imparator, Turkish for emperor — was given to him by the Galatasaray fans during their extraordinary run of four straight league titles between 1997 and 2000. He doesn’t take all the credit for himself, though.\n\n“As a football man, the gods made me have all the success I could have.”\n\nUpon being granted an audience with the Emperor, The Athletic has underestimated Istanbul’s murderous traffic. A pre-emptive apology for potential tardiness is sent from the taxi. The response from the great man is relayed: “Tell the driver you’re coming to Terim’s house. Then you’ll be on time.”\n\nNow 68, Terim has had more time to survey his kingdom recently. He was deposed by Galatasaray in January, his fourth spell at the club ending amid no little recrimination, a historically bad start to the season overtaking new president Burak Elmas’ summer promise that Terim would be in place for the next three years. The idea was that, as the landscape of Turkish football changes with Istanbul’s big three clubs’ supremacy fading amid financial catastrophe, Terim would be afforded the time to oversee a “revolution” in how the club was run.\n\nAfter all, he had won them his eighth and their 22nd league title in 2019-20, and missed out by a single goal to Besiktas in 2020-21. But by January, they were 12th and on a run of one win from nine: unacceptable at Galatasaray, even for an Emperor, though opinion was split both inside the club and with the fanbase about whether Terim should stay.\n\nTerim is circumspect about the current state of affairs at his club, but does offer: “At the beginning of this year, I decided there should be a revolution at Galatasaray. I said it wouldn’t be easy. The decision wasn’t something I was expecting. So now I need some time to relax mentally.”\n\nHe does seem pretty relaxed. But, as the old saying nearly goes: come at the emperor, you best not miss. At a recent meeting of the Galatasaray members, Elmas was effectively given a vote of no confidence, forcing him out and a new president will be elected at the end of April. There’s no suggestion that Terim was directly involved in deposing the man who sacked him, but the decision to dismiss the club legend was certainly a factor in the general dissatisfaction.\n\nYou don’t tend to get short answers from Terim. He has the capacity to, let’s say, “take a question for a walk”. One question is answered with the utmost pith and directness, though: could he ever manage a Turkish club other than Galatasaray?\n\n“Impossible.”\n\nTerim is clearly not a fan of the truism “never go back”. Usually, it doesn’t work. For Terim, it has. So why does he keep returning to Galatasaray?\n\n“Galatasaray is a one-way ticket. I can’t imagine working for another Turkish club. It’s a return to family. Whenever my club wanted me, I could not say no. Galatasaray is my home. It’s my family. I came home to my family.\n\n“Every conversation before I returned to Galatasaray in the past was short. They say, ‘Mister, we need you’. I signed the contract without checking the amount on it. When I was playing, many clubs wanted me. Other clubs would have paid me five times more. But I signed for Galatasaray.\n\n“Belonging to one club — you must feel like this. I belong to Galatasaray, this is how I show it.”\n\nTerim moved to his spiritual home from his actual home, Adana, in 1974. Back then his nickname wasn’t Imperator, but the rather less macho-sounding “Samantha”, after the character from the popular TV show Bewitched. That nickname refers to a couple of clearances he made that, in the view of some observers, were like magic tricks.\n\nBack then he was a tough-tackling midfielder with a quick temper that has been a constant throughout his career. He headbutted an opponent in one game and was banned for spitting at a referee in another. “He would plunge in head-first. If a friend needed someone to fight with him, he would be there,” Ahmet Yasar, a childhood friend of Terim’s, told John McManus for his excellent book about Turkish football, Welcome To Hell?\n\nHe stepped down from his last stint with the national team in 2017, after a brawl involving a restaurant owner who was a business rival of his son-in-law. Terim phoned the rival in question and, seemingly very dissatisfied with the outcome of that call, got into his car with his sons-in-law and drove 500km to settle the matter in person.\n\n“I spoke to the guy on the phone and I got a nasty response,” said Terim at the time. “I hung up the phone, put my trousers on and got into the car.” A Turkish Football Federation statement delicately said: “Some non-football issues have been wearing out Fatih Terim… the two sides agreed that it would be more healthy for both parties to part ways.”\n\nTerim is the epitome of one version of overt masculinity: aggressive, authoritarian, abrasive, shirt usually unbuttoned down to there to display his chest. He has a relatively conservative two buttons undone when The Athletic meets him.\n\nMcManus writes that Terim is often seen as the classic example of a “kabadayi”, which essentially means a sort of macho uncle figure, aggressively protective and fascinated with the concept of honour. Terim himself disputes this, but the restaurant set-to is just one bit of evidence that there is, at least, some truth to the characterisation.\n\n“I have never changed my character,” he says. “I am always the same Fatih Terim, from when I arrived at Galatasaray 50 years ago to now.”\n\nTerim signed for Galatasaray as a midfielder, but shortly after joining was moved into defence. And it’s something of a surprise when he reveals who was responsible for his positional shift.\n\n“I changed positions because of Don Howe,” he says. Howe, who a generation of English players will frequently describe as the best coach they ever had, took over at Galatasaray shortly after Terim arrived. “I was a midfielder, but in a European Cup game against Rapid Vienna he said, ‘Fatih, you are playing as a libero’. From then until the end of my career, I was a libero.”\n\nAs it turns out, Terim is quite the Anglophile, broadly because of the influence of Howe and a series of other Englishmen he played under. “Howe, Malcolm Allison, Arthur Cox, Brian Birch: I worked with many English coaches.”\n\nFrom the affectionate way he speaks of him, it seems like Allison was his biggest influence. Our interview is mainly conducted through a translator, and it is quite odd to hear him speak in his native Turkish but throw in the occasional “Big Mal”.\n\nHe tells a touching story about being visited by Allison — who by that stage wasn’t in a good way, having to rely on two walking sticks — in the stadium at one of Turkey’s Euro ’96 games. “They wouldn’t let him in,” Terim says. “I went outside and met Malcolm and brought him into the dressing room. I said, ‘Hey, boys, this is my coach’. He was so emotional. He was about to cry. He said ‘Fatih, I am so proud of you’. It was a great memory.”\n\nHe also recalls, with a slightly different sort of emotion, Allison’s girlfriend back then. “She was called Serena, she was a Playboy bunny. Mr Allison would take me out with him (at night), but then in the morning, we would have to do extra training (to make up for it).”\n\nWhat did he learn most from his English mentors? “Discipline. Discipline and seriousness. It was the most important thing I learned, especially during training, as well as the match. But off the pitch, they wanted their players to be relaxed.\n\n“Even if it was freezing, even if it was snowing, they always wore shorts. They were not affected by the cold. Everyone else was wearing double tracksuits, hats, many layers — they were there in shorts.”\n\nIn Terim’s office/den, one wall is dominated by a huge bookcase on which, among various trophies, photos and, most interestingly, a replica of the Turkish team’s bus from Euro 2008, sit two copies of Sir Alex Ferguson’s first autobiography.\n\n“He is one of the most important football men,” Terim says. “Of course I was influenced by his coaching and management style, because of everything he has achieved.”\n\nThis leads to a discussion about longevity and the demands of managing big clubs. Ferguson, of course, managed United for 27 years, and while Terim has never stayed in one job for anything like that amount of time — “That’s impossible in Turkey, that would be like 50 years here” — he has been at the top of the game, in various guises, for a generation.\n\nHe started his coaching career down the ranks at Galatasaray, then managed Ankaragucu before a season at Goztepe. He was then offered a gig as assistant to Sepp Piontek — who had been coach of the brilliant Danish team in the 1980s — with the Turkey national team, also taking over the under-21s. “We wanted to find a new type of Turkish footballer, not the sort that was written about in the press because of the actresses they were seeing,” Piontek told the Guardian a few years later.\n\nWhen Piontek left, Terim stepped up to the main job while still coaching the under-21s, essentially shaping a new generation of Turkish players. They qualified for Euro ’96, and, although they lost all three of their games there, it changed Turkish football and set the groundwork for later successes, like reaching the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup under Senol Gunes.\n\nTerim, meanwhile, returned to Galatasaray and immediately became a god — those four titles, three cup finals, culminating in the UEFA Cup win. “He is the soul of the club,” said forward Arif Erdem just before that final. “He’s like a father to us and a brother to us.”\n\nIn those days he was innovative — Galatasaray’s football was not dissimilar to the frantic pressing game that is commonplace now. “We always had an offensive mentality and put pressure on the opposition. During games, opponents would ask my players, ‘Are you playing with 14? We cannot understand this pressure, this power’. There were not too many teams that were applying this sort of mentality. Now there are many teams that do this.”\n\n“The demands of these big clubs are so different,” he continues. “After Euro ’96, I came to Galatasaray. Maybe in some places, getting into the Champions League places is a success. Or finishing second. With Galatasaray, only first is success.\n\n“After you get one title, it’s much more difficult. Each day you work in a big club, it gets more difficult. You mustn’t lose any games, you must always improve: it’s so much more difficult to maintain success. Because you can’t keep doing the same things: you have to change things.”\n\nThe Athletic asks Terim about that UEFA Cup final, which Galatasaray won on penalties against Arsenal, with Gica Popescu scoring the clincher after Davor Suker and Patrick Vieira had missed for Arsenal.\n\nBut instead, Terim has something more important to remember. “Before Arsenal, I must talk about Leeds.” The night before the first leg of that year’s semi-final, Leeds fans Chris Loftus and Kevin Speight were stabbed to death in Istanbul. It’s never been fully established exactly what happened but the psychological scars remain, and still weigh heavily on Terim.\n\n“It would be better for me if we had lost the game and these fans would have survived. I always think about those Leeds fans. I hope they rest in peace.”\n\nHe went to Italy in 2000, initially with Fiorentina and then a brief spell with AC Milan. He was the first Turkish manager to work in Serie A, but it didn’t go well: he was popular at Fiorentina but fell out with owner Cecchi Gori, and he only lasted 15 games at Milan. “He was a really strange fellow who seemed allergic to rules,” Andrea Pirlo later wrote about him. “He’d arrive late for lunch, turn up for official engagements without a tie, run off just so he could watch Big Brother.”\n\nThere have been opportunities for him to come to England. When Bobby Robson left Newcastle, he recommended Terim. Other clubs approached him, but nothing came to fruition. Around the time Luis Felipe Scolari’s brief reign at Chelsea was ending he was heavily linked with them, leading to the exceptional headline: “You’re the one for me, Fatih”.\n\nBack home though, few questioned him. In terms of popularity, he is polarising, which probably isn’t surprising for someone so closely associated with one club. But you get the impression that even the people that don’t like him, at least respect him.\n\nSince returning from Italy, he has only managed Galatasaray or Turkey, bouncing between the two for 20 years and, for a short spell in 2013, doing both jobs simultaneously.\n\nSo which job is tougher? “The national team, because you are responsible for the whole country. Your colours are red and white, not red and yellow. Everybody will question you. Automatically you feel it.\n\n“At Galatasaray, you are only responsible for the Galatasaray fans. I always felt this responsibility, but I was never affected by the pressure. Never did my shoulders go down because of this pressure.”\n\nThere is a perception that Terim’s time has gone, that he hasn’t sufficiently adapted to how the game has changed. There might be some truth in that, particularly given Terim’s preference is to be a manager, rather than a head coach, an increasingly outmoded and impractical concept. For what it’s worth, Terim himself insists he is forever modernising, and he brings up expected goals (admittedly as evidence that he shouldn’t have been sacked by Galatasaray), which suggests he is at least open to new ideas.\n\n“When I first managed I coached players older than me. Now they are younger than my children. Football never stops. Every day it changes. Especially the intensity of the game, the rhythm of it. It’s so high. There are so many clubs insisting on building up the game from the back. The passing game is increasing a lot.\n\n“This is the era of teams who want to play. In the past, it was popular to stop the opposition from playing. Now the public doesn’t like to watch these teams. The people want to watch a tough game, but with the ball. You must destroy the opponent with your playing style.”\n\nStill, even if he’s no longer at the forefront of the game’s innovative thinking, here’s an illustration of his continuing influence on Turkish football: of the 20 current managers in the Super Lig, ten of them either played or coached under Terim at some point. You can throw in another seven from coaches who have left their jobs in the division this season, as well as Mustafa Denizli, who played with him. Plus Hamit Altintop, who is part of the senior national team set-up. And Tolunay Kafkas, the under-21s head coach. We could go on.\n\nSo what’s next for the Imparator? “Very openly, I haven’t decided,” Terim says. “Soon, I will know. But I don’t know.” Galatasaray have moved on, and it is thought that none of the new presidential candidates intends to bring him back. It’s hard to imagine him at another club, even abroad. Stefan Kuntz is the national team coach and seems to be relatively secure, despite Turkey’s failure to qualify for the World Cup.\n\nHe is often urged to run for the Galatasaray presidency himself but doesn’t seem enormously keen. There were even reports that he wanted to head up the national federation, but The Athletic understands that is not true.\n\nWill he be back? The Athletic asked a Turkish journalist that question, and the response was emphatic: “He always comes back.”\n\nAt the back of his house is a trophy room, which is more of an overstocked utility room, with cabinets full of trophies, medals, awards and other assorted memorabilia, being stashed there while a proper museum is constructed. There’s a clothes rail heaving with shirts that would make a collector weep. There’s a pair of custom brogues in Galatasaray red and yellow. There’s a mocked-up DVD cover of The Godfather, given to him by Francesco Toldo during his brief spell at Fiorentina.\n\nHere is the physical evidence of one of the great careers, mementoes of a life well-lived. But more than objects, even if he never manages another game, Terim has left behind something bigger.\n\n“Most important to me, much more important than all the titles that I won, is that I want to leave an important legacy for Turkish football. A game, a mentality, the life as a head coach. This will be the proudest moment. The love that people have for me is the priceless thing.”\n\n(Top photo: Isa Terli/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)"
