        "text": "Early this morning, after the Istanbul soccer team Galatasaray won the first major European championship ever won by a Turkish team, the coach, Fatih Terim, said he had one more wish.\n\n''I hope our country follows up on this,'' Mr. Terim said during the jubilation, ''not just in soccer but in every field.''\n\nMost people in this soccer-crazed country spent today both proud and ecstatic. In a century of competition, no Turkish team has even come close to such a triumph.\n\nBut Galatasaray's 4-1 victory in a penalty shootout over the British team, Arsenal, has an importance far beyond sports. It spoke of this country's growing self-confidence and encouraged the increasing number of Turks who say that Turkey can succeed at any level if it disciplines itself and embraces European rules.\n\nMr. Terim is an ideal symbol of the transition Turkey hopes to make. Once a young tough who got into fights in bars, he has blossomed into an articulate leader who plays by Europe's rules and comes out a winner.\n\n''This is much bigger than football,'' said Serif Erol, a radio commentator who spent much of his Thursday morning show discussing the big victory in the Ufea Cup, given by the Union of European Football Associations.\n\n''Turkey has been missing success for much too long,'' Mr. Erol said. ''We started to wonder if we could ever compete with Europe. Now we're losing some of that inferiority complex. It's a sign of the reversal in our psychology. If we can beat so many great European teams on the soccer field, that makes us think we can be as good as the rest of Europe in democracy, in human rights, in everything.''\n\nWednesday night's game, which was played in Copenhagen, gave Galatasaray the right to call itself the best soccer club in Europe. On its way to the championship, it defeated top teams not just from Britain but also from Germany, Italy and other longtime soccer powers.\n\nThe victory came at a remarkable moment in Turkish history. During the last year this country has seen the apparent end of a long civil war, has been invited to apply for membership in the European Union, and has begun making peace with Greece, its longtime rival."
