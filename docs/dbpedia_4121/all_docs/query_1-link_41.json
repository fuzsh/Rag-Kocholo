        "text": "Carlo ‘Carletto” Ancelotti, otherwise known as one of the best managers in the world right now celebrated his 500th league win as Real Madrid crushed Real Betis after a 5-0 win at the Estadio Benito Villamarín in Sevilla. To congratulate Carlo on this amazing achievement, I’ve decided to write an article that summarizes basically his time at each of his former clubs: Regianna, Parma, Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, PSG & Real Madrid.\n\nAncelotti began his career in Italy in 1995 with Regianna where probably his most important achievement was leading them to Serie B promotion in his first year as manager. The following year, he left Regianna to join another Italian team which was full of superstars such as Buffon and Cannavaro, Parma. In his first season with Parma as well, he lead them to second place in Italy and guaranteeing them a Champions League spot. Sadly in his second season, he lead them to a joint 5th place and securing the UEFA Cup spot.\n\nIn 1999, he was given the Juventus head coach position where he coached his current assistant coach Zinedine Zidane & Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, succeeding the great Marcello Lippi. He didn’t any notable trophy with Juve except for the fact that he finished in second place in his 2 year-reign over Juventus. What is remarkable about his time with the Bianconeri is the way he was brutally sacked. In the final game of the 2000/2001 season which was a season decider, the board announced that Carlo will no longer be managing Juventus.\n\nAfter his Juventus sacking, Carlo arrives at the club where he probably had his best results as a manager, AC Milan. Ancelotti arrived to Milan on 6 November 2001, replacing the previous Galatasaray coach, Fatih Terim. In his first season, he led Milan to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. In the following year, Carlo was able to win his first Champions League cup after beating the club which previously sacked him Juventus 3-2 at Old Trafford as well as winning the 2003 Coppa Italia. Milan won the Scudetto the following year. His worst memory probably at his time in Milan came after losing the Champions League final to Liverpool on penalties after a 3-3 draw in Istanbul and being 3-0 up at halftime. But his rivalry with Liverpool wasn’t over yet, as he managed to defeat them in the 2007 Champions League final in Athens, securing his second Champions League cup with AC Milan. Ancelotti final trophy with Milan was the 2007 Club World Cup before announcing his resignation on 31 May 2009 leaving behind a never ending list of players that he coached there such as Maldini, Nesta, Gattuso, Kaka, Inzaghi, Shevchenko, Seedorf, Pirlo, Cafu, Dida.\n\nA few weeks later he agreed on taking the Chelsea spot after Guus Hiddink was sacked. His first trophy as Chelsea manager was fast as he was able to win the Community Shield on the expense of Manchester United on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Chelsea were eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter finals after a defeat to Inter (3-1 on aggregate) who were then managed by former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho. In 2010, Carlo Ancelotti became the first Italian manager to win the Premier League after beating Manchester United to the title by just one point. Carlo secured Chelsea’s first domestic double as well after beating Portsmouth in the FA Cup final at Wembley. In the 2010/2011 season, Ancelotti’s Chelsea were not as good as before as they were sitting in fifth position in January and were at risk of not clinching the Champions League place for the first time since 2002. Chelsea were dumped out of the Champions League in the quarter finals as well that year after losing 3-1 (on aggregate) against Manchester United. Even though they were very far away in the Premier League from first place, Carlo still managed to bring them up to second place and just three points away from Manchester United with three games left to be played. But then he was handed another loss against Manchester United, this time in the league which put them six points away from first place and thus losing the race. On May 22, Carlo was sacked by club owner, Roman Abramovich.\n\nAfter Chelsea, Carlo was appointed as the new PSG coach on 30 December 2011. Carlo was very close to winning the title in his first year at PSG as he was three points away from Ligue 1 winners at that time, Montpellier. In the 2011/2012 season, Carlo lead PSG to the Ligue 1 title and with 2 matches to spare. Sadly, he was out of the Champions League after being kicked out by Barcelona on the away goals rule (3-3 aggregate).\n\nAnd finally, on 25 June 2013, it was announced that Carletto will be the new Real Madrid coach, with Zizou as his assistant coach. He brought in enforcement such as Isco, Illaramendi, Carvajal & Gareth Bale to the team.\n\nCarlo had:\n\n41.46% win rate with Regianna.\n\n48.28% win rate with Parma.\n\n55.26% win rate with Juventus.\n\n56.26% win rate with AC Milan.\n\n61.47% win rate with Chelsea.\n\n63.64% win rate with PSG.\n\n80.00% win rate with Real Madrid. (so far)\n\nThe number of superstars that Ancelotti had previously coached is tremendous. Buffon, Cannavaro, Maldini, Nesta, Pirlo, Inzaghi, Drogba, Lampard, Beckham, Ibrahimovich and now Cristiano, Bale, Ramos, Xabi Alonso and the list goes on and on. The great Gabriele Marcotti once said: ‘I think the quality that most shines is that he’s a tremendous man manager, he knows how to handle superstars’. So it’s no surprise that Carlo knows how to lead a team into winning habits and hopefully get Real Madrid their 33rd Liga and the much needed ‘Decima’."
