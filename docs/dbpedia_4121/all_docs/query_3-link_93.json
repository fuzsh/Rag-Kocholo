        "text": "Galatasaray first team manager, Fatih Terim, said that he expects more on the pitch from Egypt international Mostafa Mohamed.\n\nGalatasaray have been struggling since the start of the season, whether on the domestic or continental level.\n\nThe Lions started their European campaign with a 7-2 loss on aggregate against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League to book a spot in the Europa League.\n\nThe beginning of their league journey wasn’t much different as before this weekend they had earned just eight points from their opening five games, winning just two.\n\nThey were then up against Goztepe on Sunday night and were already trailing 1-0 at half-time. However, they managed to turn things around in the second-half to win 2-1, their first victory since beating Hatayspor in the second matchday.\n\nMostafa Mohamed made a substitute appearance in the 93rd minute and barely got any playing time.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Terim expressed his delight with the win, which puts them in 10th place, and mentioned Mohamed among other player who need to step up their game.\n\n“I’m very happy that we won, we got the three points we deserved today, which was very difficult, but we played very well in the second half,” Terim told Galatasaray’s official website.\n\n“We put a lot of pressure on them in the second half more than we did in the first, and Morutan scored a great goal. I’m very happy with the performance of my team.\n\n“Congratulations to my team, they fought very well, I’m happy with the support of our fans, and I thank them on behalf of my players. I was very happy to see the fans in the stadium.\n\n“We have many players that I expect more from, goalkeeper Muslera to Mostafa Mohamed, Mbaye Diagne and Emre Kilinc.\n\n“They played well in the last match, and today I was happy with the reaction of some. My goal is to have a good team with experience and youth, and I hope we can improve in the following matches,” he concluded.\n\nFollowing a fantastic debut season, Mostafa went into this season with a lot of hopes with Galatasaray, especially after the departure of Henry Onyekuru and Radamel Falcao.\n\nHowever, the Zamalek-loanee has had an underwhelming start to the season so far, failing to score any goals across 13 different games."
