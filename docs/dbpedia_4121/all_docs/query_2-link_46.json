        "text": "Christian Pulisic looks ready for his sophomore campaign at AC Milan.\n\nComing off a sensational debut season with the Rossoneri, Pulisic is ramping up for the new campaign during his club’s three-game tour of the United States.\n\nIn Milan’s third and final game of the tour on Tuesday, Pulisic started at the No. 10 in a high-profile showdown with Barcelona in Baltimore.\n\nThe American star stole the show in front of his home fans, grabbing a goal and an assist within the first 15 minutes.\n\nPulisic first assisted Luka Jović with a ball across the box that left the Serbian forward with a tap-in, before getting a goal himself just five minutes later.\n\nThe 25-year-old ran in behind the Barcelona defense to get on the end of a pass from Rafael Leão, before cleverly lifting a shot over goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen from a tight angle.\n\nFollowing this match, Milan will to Italy to face Monza in the Trofeo Luigi Berlusconi on August 13, before kicking off the regular season the following week.\n\nWatch Pulisic’s goal vs. Barcelona"
