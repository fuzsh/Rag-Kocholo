        "text": "Very few managers succeeded while pulling off this amazing feat.\n\nIt is very rare in football history for a manager to manage the job of a national team whilst still continuing at the club level. However, many bizzare things have happened in the history of football and quite a few managers have pulled off this feat.\n\nHere are the 5 managers who managed a club and national team at the same time:\n\n5. Rinus Michels\n\nThe Dutchman was the coach of both Netherlands and FC Barcelona as well. He was the inventor of \" Total Football\" and applied his tactics at both the Netherlands International team and Barcelona.\n\nJohan Cruyff was at the helm during Michel's role at both Barcelona and the Netherlands team. Rinus led the Dutch National side to the World Cup Final as well in 1974. This happened whilst he was still in charge of Barcelona and went on to also manage the Dutch National side for 4 years.\n\nIn the domestic side of his career ,he won the La Liga title with Barcelona.\n\n4. Leonid Slutsky\n\nLeonid has managed CSKA Moscow for seven years and also had to manage Russia for ten months during his last year.\n\nRussia failed to perform at the Euro 2016, finishing bottom of the group behind Wales and England. The atmosphere was very awry and infuriating after the Euros. In view of that ,UEFA threatened to disqualify Russia after violence from the fans. The only good news for Russia was that since they were hosts of the 2018 WC ,they qualified automatically. The Football Union of Russia also asked Leonid to choose between CSKA Moscow or the Russian Team.\n\nHowever, Slutsky has accomplished much with CSKA Moscow winning three Russian Premier League titles and two Russian Cups.\n\n3. Fatih Terim\n\nThe 68 year old former Galatasaray player has managed the team and Turkey national team on three occasions each. This happened during August 2013 during the World Cup Qualifiers whilst he was still managing his beloved Galatasaray.\n\nFatih is the essence of Turkish football. He gained legendary status after guiding Galatasaray to a UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2000. This made them the first Turkish side to win European trophies. He has also won two league titles with them on his second managerial stint taking their tally to 23.\n\nHowever the club's performance dipped drastically and they finished 12th in the league table. Furthermore they have just won 7 out of 20 league games this season which prompted the board to fire him.\n\n2. Guus Hiddink\n\nAnother Dutch manager has made it to the list and Guus has done well with both Chelsea and Russia. The legendary Dutch coach led Russia in 2006 and then managed Arshavin ,Pavlyuchenko to the Euro semi-finals in 2008.\n\nHe then took on the task to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. Unfortunately Guus failed and was then appointed as Chelsea coach in early 2009. He was appointed following Scolari's sacking. The Blues won the FA Cup within a few months of his appointment. Under Hiddink's management the club also lost only 1 out of 22 games in 2009 throughout all competitions.\n\n1. Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nSAF is arguably the greatest coach in the history of football. He has managed both Aberdeen and Scotland as well. The Scotland side had already qualified for a World Cup play-off qualifier.\n\nThe Scottish legend had a tough time with the international side losing to Austria in the play-off and missing out on the 1986 World Cup.\n\nHowever Sir Alex Ferguson has won 9 honours managing Aberdeen from 1978 to 1986. Whilst managing both sides ,SAF won the Scottish Cup in the 1985-96 season and also the League cup in the same season."
