        "text": "Fatih Terim, the most renowned coach in Greek football, is on the brink of dismissal following three consecutive defeats.\n\nGreek giant Panathinaikos surprised many last year by sacking Serbian coach Ivan Jovanović after two and a half years and appointing the illustrious Turk Fatih Terim, the legendary Galatasaray strategist and the most celebrated Turkish coach of all time.\n\nInitially, Terim managed to win over the fans, but recently PAO has plunged into a severe crisis and currently sits in fourth place on the league table with one round remaining in the season.\n\nThe 1-4 defeat against PAOK seems to have serious repercussions, as Turkish media report that Panathinaikos president Giannis Alafouzos is set to meet with Terim soon, with the termination of their collaboration almost decided.\n\nGreek media have been highly critical of the 70-year-old Terim, as evidenced by a headline in Gazzetta:\n\n\"Fatih Terim has destroyed in five months everything that Ivan Jovanović built in two and a half years.\""
