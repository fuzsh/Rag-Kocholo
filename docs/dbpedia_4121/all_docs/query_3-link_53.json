Known as the Emperor, Galatasaray fired him only after a month.\n\n(Photo source AP)\n\nISTANBUL: Turkish giants Galatasaray on Tuesday fired coach Fatih Terim after a disappointing start to the season.\n\nThe news comes only a month after the most successful coach in Turkish history agreed to take over the national team on a one-year deal, while continuing his club commitments.\n\nBut following a mediocre start to the season that saw them win one, and draw three of their opening four league matches, leaving them currently ninth, Terim has been shown the door.\n\nFollowing a board meeting the club published a statement on their website saying they had decided to \"end Fatih Terim's contract\", explaining that it was to \"protect the club's interests\".\n\nApart from the champions' poor league start, last week they were humiliated 6-1 at home to Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\nKnown as the Emperor in his homeland, Terim was in his third stint at the Galatasaray helm having previously won six Turkish league titles and led them to the UEFA Cup crown in 2000, beating Arsenal on penalties in the final.\n\nHe is in his third spell as Turkey coach after previously taking the reins from 1993 to 1996 and then again from 2005 to 2009."
