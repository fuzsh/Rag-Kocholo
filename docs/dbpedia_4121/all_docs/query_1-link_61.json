        "text": "Samir joined Arsenal from the age of 8, and managed to sign a professional contract there. He was happy to talk his experience growing up at the Gunners and how it helped make him the player and person he is today.\n\nSA: How did your early football journey start?\n\nSB: I started kicking the ball from an early age with my dad in the garden at around 3/4 years old. My parents then put me in a local Sunday side called Barkingside FC when I was 5 years old, and I started my first ever game off as a goalkeeper which didn’t go really well as I conceded a lot of goals that day but the following week, I played outfield and enjoyed it much more.\n\nAfter that season, I joined another team called Redbridge United and I was there from ages 6-8. We were a good team and the majority of other players were picked up to sign for other academies; we were all quite talented and being able to train and play together a lot for two years just excelled our development. Myself and Jordan Wynter both went to the same primary school and played together for Redbridge so playing with him helped me get better, alongside our parents’ and coaches’ enthusiasm and passion to be the best. During my time there, I gained interest from a few academy sides like Arsenal, West Ham, Tottenham and Charlton.\n\nI played for another team as well called Ascot United, where another player who ended up playing for Arsenal played there as well called Alban Bunjaku. Growing up in the area, we came up against good players all time and I remember Tommie Hoban played for a rival Sunday team called SoccerSkills, and it’s funny to think that me, Jordan, Alban and Tommie all were from in and around the same area, and encountered each other a lot by playing with and against each other and we all played and joined Arsenal together at young ages.\n\nSA: Who scouted you?\n\nSB: Gary Nott\n\nSA: What clubs have you been at?\n\nSB: Barkingside, Redbridge United, Ascot, Arsenal, Bournemouth, Hayes and Yeading, Wealdstone, Enfield Town, Braintree Town, Wingate and Finchley, New Orleans Jesters and Walthamstow FC.\n\nI did trials at Wolves, Sunderland and West Ham when I left Arsenal but I decided to sign for Bournemouth where Eddie Howe offered me my contract.\n\nSA: From the top of your head, who are some of the names you remember playing with at academy level?\n\nSB: In my age group, I played with Zak Ansah, Josh Rees, Jordan Roberts and Anthony Furlonge. And in the other age groups were Benik Afobe, Chuks Aneke, Nico Yennaris, Ryan Fredericks, Isaac Hayden and Jason Banton. And in terms of foreign lads, I played with Serge Gnabry, Héctor Bellerín, Kristoffer Olsson and Jon Toral.\n\nSA: Who would you say were the best coaches that helped get the best of you and why?\n\nSB: Danny Buck and Ose Aibangee, from when I was 9 to 11, were great. With those two, I just remember having fun all the time at Hale End and the confidence they gave me at a young age to express myself did a lot for me.\n\nSteve Bould as well. He was my manager for the U18s. The jump from U16s football to full-time at London Colney was huge but his knowledge and attention to detail was second to none and helped me adapt. He was very strict but for the right reasons. He would pull me aside at times and tell me my running abilities were elite and that I fitted the mould of an Arsenal player and I believe he was doing this to encourage me to push myself to give me the best chance of breaking through into the first team.\n\nAnd at Bournemouth, it was Eddie Howe, who instilled confidence in me after I had been let go from Arsenal and made it easy for me to adapt to living in a completely new environment.\n\nSA: Who, to you, were the best players growing up?\n\nSB: In terms of who I played and trained with Josh Rees, Zak Ansah, Benik Afobe, Serge Gnabry, Jon Toral, Jack Wilshere and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas. And against, Nathan Redmond, Jacob Murphy, Paul Pogba, James Ward-Prowse and Blair Turgott.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you remember playing against that were really good?\n\nSB: When we were U14s, we played PSV in the Willem II final and we got absolutely outplayed. They were a joke, they had one player flip-flapping it over our players’ heads.\n\nSouthampton and West Ham were always tough games as well. West Ham were our biggest rivals going through the age groups.\n\nSA: Do you have some funny or cool interesting stories that people might not know about?\n\nSB: Our age group were the first to be able to play on the Emirates pitch before it was officially opened for the first team. I also scored the first unofficial goal there.\n\nAnother is I was given the squad number 52 and Nicklas Bendtner must have been away on loan and when he came back, he went mad and then, I had to be given a new number.\n\nAnother is Roy Massey, who was the head of Hale End, gave up his tickets for a Manchester United game when I was younger because I was a big fan and had asked months in advance – tells you what type of guy he is; super nice.\n\nLastly, I can remember a story about Jeffrey Monakana. After training, there used to be a biscuit box and we could take two and there was a lady called Moira, who would stand by it and monitor how many we took and one day she turned her back, and two lads in front of Jeffrey must took whatever was left (I think it was Alie Sesay and another lad called Ramone) and Jeffrey went mad that he couldn’t have any and kicked the door in half. One half was still on the hinges and the other half was on the floor. Roy Massey came in and went mental and he didn’t come in for 2 weeks and when he came back, he was training with the older group because apparently, they were impressed with how much power he could generate from his kicks.\n\nSA: Are there some key people in your young footballing journey that you’d like to bring light to that might not be known?\n\nSB: My dad. He spent so much of his time taking me to the park practising nearly every day and gave up his time to drive me to training and wherever we needed to be. I remember playing up until the age of 18 and always looking over to him during games and waiting for a thumbs up or thumbs down if I wasn’t playing well. I was more worried about his opinion than the coaches.\n\nSA: What happened post-Arsenal for you?\n\nSB: After leaving Arsenal, I went on to sign for Bournemouth, and following that, I had spells in non-league then went to play out in the U.S. for New Orleans Jesters where I made the team of the year. I currently now have my own construction business, which takes up majority of my time, alongside playing and managing my local YouTube Sunday team called Brook Athletic.\n\nPhotos of Samir are down below\n\nCharlie Swann has been playing football all his life and he spent some of his formative playing years at the Arsenal academy and managed to play with well-known players from a really young age. He was happy to talk about his experience.\n\nSA: How did your early journey begin?\n\nCS: Football was a huge part of my life from a very young age. For as long as I can remember, I had a ball at my feet. Even when my dad tried to give me a rugby ball as a kid, I tried to do kick-ups! I started out at a team called Lions 98, where I was picked up at age 6 and ironically, I was picked up on my very first game. I played for Arsenal for 4 years, and then I was released and had a few spells at Charlton & West Ham.\n\nSA: Who scouted you?\n\nCS: Roy Massey and Graham Nicholls.\n\nSA: From the top of your head, who are some of the names you remember playing with at academy level?\n\nCS: Harry Kane, Benik Afobe, Deniz Mehmet, Chuks Aneke, Nico Yennaris and Alex Lozowski.\n\nSA: Who would you say was the best coach you had growing up?\n\nCS: Tunde Adeshokan by far. He’s the best coach I’ve ever played under. He was phenomenal; the highlight coach. He was so good with the younger players and built a solid foundation for so many to go on.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you played with?\n\nCS: The best players were Benik and Chuks.\n\nSA: What players did you play with growing up that ended up surprising you with their career?\n\nCS: Harry Kane for sure. We were both released at the same age at a similar time and I think he was released for being too small. It’s crazy when you think about it now.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you remember playing against that were really good?\n\nCS: Tottenham was always a good one. We used to have tournaments with Norwich City a lot. Chelsea and West Ham were also good to play against.\n\nSA: Do you have some funny or cool interesting stories that people might not know about?\n\nCS: It’s funny because it was always the talk of the changing room when we played Charlton. They were the team that my family and I supported. I would always look forward to playing them. We played Charlton 9 times, and collectively, I scored 15 goals against them. When I left Arsenal, I went to Charlton but I turned them down, even though they offered my family a box, which I do regret, not going to lie.\n\nI also remember we were so good as a group that we would play good non-academy teams from in and around London, and they would tend to be an age group older than us. We played teams such as Parkfield, Peacocks, Ridgeway Rovers, Croydon Borough, Haringey Borough, Gladstone Rangers and Tower Hamlets Borough. There was a one team from Southend, called Galaxy Raiders, who were U10s and played us at U9s, and I remember they beat us 12-11 and I scored 7 goals. My dad still says it was an amazing game to watch.\n\nWhen I got released, I wrote Arsenal a letter thanking them for the wonderful years. I visited back a few years later, and they still had the letter pinned on the wall at Hale End.\n\nSA: Can you tell us about after Arsenal and what happened?\n\nCS: I got released from Arsenal and only ended up playing for Charlton and West Ham for a short amount of time. I went on to play semi-pro at Greenwich Borough and then Fisher FC. I then went to the States to coach and I got my badges. I then got recruited to play University football in the States and earn my Bachelor’s degree in Finance. I recently just coached last year but now, I just work as a fund accountant.\n\nVideo of Charlie playing football in Uni\n\nPhotos of Charlie are down below\n\nReice Charles-Cook is a current semi-professional goalkeeper who spent a lot of his time growing up in Arsenal’s academy and was happy to talk about his young playing days under the Wenger regime.\n\nSA: How did your football journey begin?\n\nRCC: I was playing for my Sunday League team, Tulse Hill, as an Under 7. I played as a goalkeeper because I had a heart murmur. I then got scouted from playing in a Watford tournament and half my team got scouted. Every club in London wanted to sign me from the age of 7 and I was going to development centres for about a year. I stayed training with Arsenal’s academy goalkeepers for about 2/3 years but didn’t sign, and on occasion, I would train with the actual signed players but it wasn’t until after I went on a tour that I got signed at 10.\n\nSA: Who scouted you, if you can remember?\n\nRCC: Chris McGinn\n\nSA: Who were your favourite coaches?\n\nRCC: I had outstanding coaches at Arsenal. To name some, Dan Buck, Ose (Ozzie) Aibangee, Gordon Lawrence, Steve Leonard, Carl Laraman, Steve Bould and Steve Gatting. I would say Arsenal was perfect for giving you the right coaches at the right ages, for example, working with Steve Bould would mould you into a man.\n\nSA: Who are some of the names you played with at academy level?\n\nRCC: Zak Ansah, Josh Rees, Jordan Wynter, Jeffrey Monakana, Anthony Furlonge, Tommie Hoban, Ernest Boateng and Jordan Roberts, just to name some.\n\nLooking back at some of the names, I’d, with hindsight, say to play for Arsenal at that time, you had to have been gifted. To play for Arsenal back then, you weren’t there by mistake. I would say it was the pinnacle of academy football worldwide, alongside Chelsea and Man United. If you stood out when we played you, you would normally see that player there on the Tuesday evening training with us. Even if players got released from Arsenal, wherever they went after, I’m sure they stood out; it may not have been straight away but it’s about being at the right place at the right time, to showcase what you learned at Arsenal.\n\nSA: Do you have interesting funny cool stories about growing up at Arsenal?\n\nRCC: To be fair, there are a few. I look back at them all now and laugh.\n\nI go through some of the stories on this podcast episode.\n\nI have a story where on my first day on trial at Arsenal, we played a mini-tournament at Hale End and one of my good friends now, Jordan Wynter (who isn’t/wasn’t a goalkeeper), told me to give him my gloves because I was playing badly in goal. I thought I was done at Arsenal and there was a green and brown cage at Hale End and I was sitting on the fence and I remember my dad just telling me I was done. I remember feeling silly because all the other boys were in Arsenal gear and I was in my Sunday league gear.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I didn’t sign for Arsenal at the earliest age but I stayed and trained every week with the academy keepers. I was technically on trial for 2 years and I got picked to go to a tournament called ‘the MIC Cup‘. It was strange because I wasn’t signed and the keepers were signed didn’t go and I went but after that tournament that we won, I got signed and I remember Roy Massey shaking my hand and Steve Leonard giving me the full kit and I was so happy. Before then, me and my dad weren’t that sociable and talkative when we would go to Hale End, but after I put pen to paper, that’s when we both came out of our shells.\n\nI remember being 12 and being at the old JVC centre, under Highbury, where we used to go on Thursdays. I would get called up to train with the older age groups, and I was overwhelmed with the lack of leniency they had for me. The older players, just to name some, were the likes of Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, Henri Lansbury, Mark Randall, Jack Wilshere and Roarie Deacon, and they had no mercy; they didn’t care that was 12 and they hit the ball as if I was a keeper in their age group. I remember my hand would be stinging and my dad would be watching the sessions from above and would be cautious but he was told I would learn from it and I did.\n\nI also remember seeing Mario Götze and Jack Wilshere both putting up ‘player of the tournament’ campaigns in the Willem II tournament one year, and both of them were so special, doing special things on the pitch.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you’ve played with and against and also, trained with at a young age?\n\nRCC: In terms of with, Jack Wilshere is the one player that we all, at Arsenal, knew, from the age of 10, that he was going to make it in the Arsenal first team; he looked like he gliding with the ball at times when we were younger. I also remember being at my first session at Coventry and James Maddison was so confident and tidy at such a young age and I told my family after that session, to put money down on him playing for England and lastly, Serge Gnabry. I just knew Serge was going to go the whole way.\n\nIn terms of against, Yanic Wildschut was such a problem the year Wigan got promoted from League One; he was like Ronaldo. One name that people wouldn’t know about is a French guy called Yann Gueho, who played for Chelsea’s academy, and I’m convinced he would have a Ballon D’or right now if he kept playing and was on the straight and narrow. I think back to a time, he was around 14 and I remember doing the match prep at Arsenal with the U16s, and we dedicated part of a training session to prepare for him; that’s how good he was. And lastly, Memphis Depay, when he was at Feyenoord, at a young age, in the Willem II tournament.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you feared playing against?\n\nRCC: Nah, not at all. We always knew tough games were coming against Charlton, Fulham, Chelsea and Crystal Palace but fear wasn’t a thing.\n\nSA: Are there some key people in your young footballing journey that you’d like to bring light to that might not be known?\n\nRCC: Alex Welsh was an unbelievable goalkeeper coach. He probably was the most perfect goalkeeper coach you can pick for young goalkeepers ages 7-16. The day I went in, he took to me and has a special place in my footballing journey and my life as well. My family as well. My older brothers are the best. They made me who I am today because my mum wouldn’t let me run about with my heart problem, so they were making me dive on concrete in my garden from a young age. Having a brother in the academy, Regan, was difficult. Seeing as we are 3 years apart, it meant we would train on different days of the week and when it came to matches, one would be at home and the other be away. I remember our parents having to do Rock paper scissors to see who was travelling with who away and who got to do Hale End.\n\nPhotos of Reice down below\n\nCole is a pro footballer who plays for Biggleswade Town, but spent his formative footballing years in the Luton and Chelsea set-ups. He was happy to talk about his journey.\n\nSA: How did your early football journey begin?\n\nCDS: I started playing football from as soon as I could walk with my brothers. My Sunday league team was a team called Luton Celtic, where my dad was the manager. We played with all our friends and I think because we were all good friends, it helped us get good. I started at Luton Town, from 7/8 years old and I played up an age group with my brother Jay. I stayed at Luton until I was about 11 or 12 years old before going to Chelsea. I visited multiple clubs before deciding on Chelsea. Spurs, Brentford, Watford and Arsenal all wanted us but all 3 of us brothers decided Chelsea was best for us.\n\nSA: Who scouted you, if you remember?\n\nCDS: Martin Taylor\n\nSA: From the top of your head, who are some of the names you remember playing with at academy level?\n\nCDS: Jay (my brother), Frankie Musonda, Jamal Lewis, James Justin, Tyreeq Bakinson, Mason Mount, Reece James, Trevoh Chalobah, Iké Ugbo, Conor Gallagher, Daniel Kemp, Declan Rice, Eddie Nketiah and Levi Lumeka.\n\nSA: Do you have a funny cool interesting story that people might not know about? Anything that you can think of that would make the reader surprised…\n\nCDS: I remember playing against Jamal Lewis at Sunday league level and he played for a team called St Martins, I believe. Jamal, now, is one of my close friends.\n\nSA: Who would you say were the best coaches, at each club you were at, that helped get the best of you and why? And who were your favourites?\n\nCDS: At Luton, it was John DeSouza and Stuart English and at Chelsea, Frank O’Brien, Adi Viveash, Jody Morris and Michale Beale.\n\nThey all got a different strength out of me. Michael Beale made every session fun and technical which is what we loved, but Jody Morris made every session tough and I was probably at my best under him, fitness-wise and technically but each coach understood me and my teammates as players and knew what was needed to progress.\n\nSA: Can you remember anyone notable coming in on trial? Like anyone that’s known now that got rejected and didn’t get in or something…\n\nCDS: I remember Timothy Weahspent time with us. He was ridiculously good but I’m not sure why he never signed. I don’t think he got rejected, I just don’t think it ended up happening. Now, he’s doing very well.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you played with and against and also, trained with at a young age?\n\nCDS: Mason Mount and Reece James were always top talents. Jérémie Boga is maybe the best player I’ve played with on natural ability. I’ve trained with the likes of Eden Hazard, Cesc Fàbregas and John Terry so many world-class players.\n\nPlayed against, I’d say Marcus Edwards always gave me the most difficult challenge. And Jadon Sancho & Brahim Díaz were always exceptional also.\n\nSA: What players did you play with or against growing up that ended up surprising you with their career?\n\nCDS: I wouldn’t say any surprised me. But someone like Conor Gallagher, was never necessarily the best talent, but always worked ridiculously hard, which allowed him to show his unreal talent.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you remember playing against that were really good?\n\nCDS: Arsenal was always a great game, and so was Man City.\n\nPhotos of Cole\n\nChris Solly is a professional footballer who plays for Ebbsfleet, but had his footballing education at Charlton’s and Arsenal’s academies and he was happy to talk about his journey.\n\nSA: How did your early football journey begin?\n\nCS: I played for my local side called Cliffe Woods, and I got scouted by Arsenal. I went on a 6-week trial and then, I was offered a contract. I spent 4 seasons at Arsenal and I signed as an U8. I then got released by Arsenal at 11 for being too small and then signed for Charlton.\n\nSA: Who scouted you?\n\nCS: Graham Nicholls.\n\nSA: Who are some names you played with growing up?\n\nCS: At Arsenal, I played with Jack Wilshere, Henri Lansbury, Sanchez Watt, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, Craig Eastmond, Emmanuel Frimpong, Thomas Cruise, Cedric Evina and James Shea. We had an unbelievable team; it’s mad that quite a few made it from our U8s team.\n\nAt Charlton, in the academy, I played with Jonjo Shelvey, Scott Wagstaff, Josh Wright, Harry Arter, Harry Pell and Luke Rooney. A lot of other boys, that I played with went on to are having brilliant careers, like Joe Gomez, Ademola Lookman, Nick Pope and Ezri Konsa.\n\nSA: Who were your favourite coaches that you remember?\n\nCS: At Arsenal, around U8s and U9s, Tunde Adeshokan had a bubbly personality and was always positive! I had Steve Leonard at U10s and U11s, and he was unreal – definitely one of my favourites! Training with him was always enjoyable, and he was firm but fair. He was a top guy.\n\nAt Charlton, John Humphrey was unbelievable; he was a RB himself. He was a great guy and a great coach. Steve Avory is probably the best coach I worked under. I improved loads being coached by him because his attention to detail was incredible. Then also, Damian Matthew, my youth team manager, who was a big influence on my career; the period of going from a boy to a man, he was brilliant for me.\n\nSA: Do you have any funny stories that people might not know about?\n\nCS: I remember with Arsenal, we had one game away at Spurs, and we must’ve been about 10 and we only had 10 players so we used their sub-keeper in goal for us and our normal GK played up front, we won 4-0 and he got a hat-trick.\n\nAnother is when I signed at Charlton, our games with Arsenal were all spicy and would always be super competitive. At one stage, I remember one game the ref had a blue card, as players were getting sent off in previous games, and they used it to sin bin players.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you’ve played with and against at a young age?\n\nCS: At Arsenal, Jack Wilshere and Henri Lansbury. And at Charlton, Jonjo Shelvey and Joe Gomez.\n\nI remember, for England U17s, I played against Gaël Kakuta, and he was frightening! He played at Chelsea – He had an incredible left foot and was so silky and skilful.\n\nSA: What players did you play with or against growing up that ended up surprising you?\n\nCS: Andros Townsend – I played against him loads growing up, and he has had an incredible career.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you feared playing against?\n\nCS: No. Certainly not at Arsenal. At that age, we never lost and at Charlton, I always enjoyed playing against the better players at Arsenal and Chelsea to be fair.\n\nPhotos of Chris Solly\n\nSam Byles has experience from being at Arsenal at a young age, developing his playing style at Hale End and he was happy to talk with us about his journey.\n\nSA: How did your early football journey begin and who did you play for as a kid?\n\nSB: I was exposed to football from a very young age as I have 2 older brothers. I began playing for a grassroots team called Cuffley, in Hertfordshire, at the age of 7. From there, I got spotted by an Arsenal scout & began training at a satellite development centre under a brilliant skills coach called David George. My grassroots team won a local tournament in which a few scouts were present, having played well, there was some immediate interest & contact was made with my parents. These clubs were Barnet, Charlton & Ipswich, but I eventually when to Arsenal.\n\nSA: Who are some of the names you played with at academy level?\n\nSB: Looking back, Hale End was a hotbed for talent. My age group had the likes of Luke Ayling, Jack Wilshere and Emmanuel Frimpong who made it to the highest level in the PL. However, the majority of players didn’t quite reach those heights like myself but still went on to successful careers in the non-league and abroad like Conor Henderson. There’s some others players that played with us but left when we were young like Ryan Fredericks (he left and went to Spurs), Christian Burgess (who left at 12) and Jonjo Shelvey played with us before he moved to West Ham’s academy.\n\nSA: Do you remember the names of your coaches and the ones that had an impact on you?\n\nSB: Gordon Lawrence was our coach for the first few years in the academy & was great in the early phases of our team’s development. Our team then passed through some brilliant coaches at the academy, such as Steve Leonard, Bob Arber and Steve Gatting.\n\nThe most memorable coach was Dermot Drummy. He had a real impact with his personality around Hale End and knew when to banter but also knew where to draw the line. I vividly remember my U14s season under Paul Mortimer, who believed in my potential & instilled massive confidence in me. As a football coach today, this makes me value the psychology and the role a coach can play in a child’s development.\n\nHowever, to this day, I would say Steve Bould as my U18s coach; he was the best in terms of technical & tactical development.\n\nSA: Do you have cool interesting stories that people might not know about?\n\nSB: At U14s, my 1992 year group was lucky enough to go and play in an inaugural tournament in Qatar at the Aspire Academy. We met Pele & Maradona, and I believe the picture is still up on the wall at Hale End.\n\nMy biggest & favourite memory is winning the Player of the Tournament award in Tilburg, Holland. We played & beat a Dortmund team with Mario Götze in the semi final, which is pretty cool to think about.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you’ve played with and against and also, trained with at a young age?\n\nSB: Jack Wilshere was levels above everyone in his own age group, and was for the year group above. No surprise to where his career went…\n\nI was fortunate enough to train with the Arsenal first team a few times. Besides Jack, Fabregas & Nasri were the standouts.\n\nJosh McEachran would give me some tough games and Jonjo was also a nightmare to play against at times. Games against Jonjo when we were younger were tense; there would literally be fist fights on the pitch when he was around. Me and Jonjo became good friends when we played for the same England team.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you feared playing against?\n\nSB: No way. Our Arsenal team was untouchable. We were the best team in the country!\n\nSA: So what happened post-Arsenal for you?\n\nSB: So after I left Arsenal, Liam Brady offered me a coaching role at Hale End whilst I found my next playing club. It was great to go back and work with the younger age groups in the academy and share some of my knowledge & experiences with them.\n\nThe U9s & U10s were the groups that I worked with the most; I worked with some notable young players now like Bukayo Saka, Arthur Okonkwo, Matt Smith & Tyreece John Jules.\n\nThat experience really sparked my interest in coaching, so I left the role at Hale End to go to Solent University on a football scholarship to study further.\n\nAfter university, I challenged myself to play football overseas. Firstly, I went to America to play for FC Buffalo. From there, I got myself over to Perth, Western Australia, completely as a free agent and bagged myself some trials at 2 different clubs. I signed for Sorrento FC and probably to this day, some of my favourite moments of my career come from playing for them.\n\nReturning back from playing in Australia, I signed for the infamous YouTube team, Hashtag United. This was another really cool time in my career, with all games shown weekly on YouTube, reaching 100’s thousands of viewers per game.\n\nTo coincide with playing, I started my own 1-2-1 football coaching business in which I help develop young kids, from grassroots to academy level, to reach their full potential. This is now my full time focus & a huge passion of mine. My playing career has slowed down this season, but I found a new love for long distance running & cycling, as well as getting my golf handicap to single figures.\n\nPhotos of Sam are down below\n\nErnest Boateng spent his footballing young years at Hale End, Arsenal’s academy, and was happy to talk about his journey\n\nSA: How did your early footballing journey begin?\n\nEB: I was 7 years old playing in a park in Palmers Green with my mum and I saw some people playing football and asked to go join in. I played well and had fun and an adult asked my mum if I wanted to join their team. I started playing for this team called ‘Reliant Regals’ in Palmers Green, for the year (the U9s). In my first season, we came bottom of the league but I scored 30 goals, I played against the team that was top of the table, Broadwater Farm, twice that season and we lost once and drew the other but I had good games. One of the coaches, Clasford Stirling, asked my dad to join Broadwater Farm at the end of the season so I did. In my 1st season at Broadwater Farm, we won a lot and that summer, we played Arsenal in a friendly and we drew 2-2 and I scored 2 goals. Roy Massey asked me to sign for Arsenal but Arsenal had just signed Jeffrey Monakana from Broadwater Farm, who was a quality player, so I was asked to stay 1 more season at Broadwater Farm. I played in some games for Arsenal, whilst still playing 1 more season at Broadwater Farm and we won a lot again and then I signed Arsenal permanently at 10. I signed with another boy as well who was from the same Sunday team as me. So technically, I got scouted by both Roy Massey and Clasford Stirling. Clasford is the man who had a big impact on my young footballing career and allowed me to do what I loved at the time.\n\nSA: How long were you at Arsenal?\n\nEB: I was at Arsenal from age 9 to 14.\n\nSA: Who are some of the names you played with?\n\nEB: Jordan Wynter, Josh Rees, Zak Ansah, Reice Charles-Cook, Tommie Hoban, Chuks Aneke, Nico Yennaris and Jeffrey Monakana are the first names that pop into my head.\n\nSA: What coaches do you remember having a big impact on your football?\n\nEB: My first coach at Arsenal was Dan Buck, I remember him being good with us; he made training and football fun. He got involved with all the kids and you felt like you were just playing football with your mates; it’s almost like we’d forgotten we were at a high level. My next coach, Ose Aibangee, was my best coach and he taught me the intricacies of making runs, movement and how to give yourself the best chance of scoring goals. He was a great coach and a good man. We had a few coaches after like Gordon Lawrence, Steve Leonard and Carl Laraman.\n\nSA: Do you have funny stories of when you were at Arsenal?\n\nEB: A funny story is even though I was at Arsenal, for 5/6 years, I wasn’t at any end-of-season team photos, as I was away at boarding school every single time it was scheduled. Another thing is even though I grew up as a forward, I looked up to the older players that weren’t even in my position like Jack Wilshere, but also Emmanuel Frimpong, as well, who came from Broadwater Farm too. He found playing in any midfield/attacking position easy and had so much ability and people were always so shocked because when he ended up playing for the first team, he was a defensive midfielder.\n\nSA: Who are the best players that you’ve played with and against and also, trained with?\n\nEB: Chuks is one as he could dominate anyone in midfield; he was like a quality mix of Vieira, Diaby and Yaya Toure. Benik Afobe, as well, as he was ruthless in front of goal. In terms of playing against, I would say Nathaniel Chalobah; he could play in midfield and defence and was technically so good. The best players I had the opportunity to train with at some point were Jack Wilshere and Emmanuel Frimpong. I also looked up to a guy called Peggy Lokando, from my area, who played for Arsenal; he was amazing – he played for the same Sunday team as me.\n\nSA: What players did you see growing up that ended up surprising you?\n\nEB: Isaac Hayden and Alex Iwobi have both ended up having great careers which is well deserved because of their hard work, dedication and quality.\n\nSA: What happened post-Arsenal for you?\n\nEB: I got released from Arsenal at 14 because I was juggling boarding school and football, and my mum wanted me to focus on education. After I got released, I got calls from Chelsea, West Ham and Watford but I didn’t follow through. I didn’t play for a year and then I went on trial at Peterborough but I lost my love for the game at that point. I ended up playing football again at college and university, stopped for a few years again but I’m back playing again. It’s taken me a while to realise there is a life outside football but my experiences playing taught me to never stop doing what you love in any capacity whatever that may be.\n\nPhotos of Ernest Boateng are down below\n\nAaron Barnes is a current footballer, who is also now a scout, and spent time at Charlton’s and Arsenal’s academies and was happy to talk about his experiences growing up there.\n\nSA: How did you end up at Arsenal?\n\nAB: In 2007, I was playing for my Sunday team in the George Parris tournament, which was played at Upton Park. I had been scouted before by other teams, like West Ham, Chelsea and Spurs but I wasn’t too keen on going to academy football that early, and neither was my family but when I was 10 and Arsenal approached me at that tournament, my dad and I took notice and we were keen to go. It was a sick feeling to get scouted and go to the club you support. I had a trial and I got signed quite quickly.\n\nSA: Who scouted you for Arsenal?\n\nAB: A scout named Graham Nicholls.\n\nSA: Who are some notable names that you played with at Arsenal?\n\nAB: Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Alex Iwobi, Chris Willock and Jordan Brown are some names that pop up in my head first.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you’ve played with and against and also, trained with at a young age?\n\nAB: When I was at Arsenal, Chris Willock, Chuba Akpom, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Gedion Zelalem were all very good. I remember Chelsea were very good. They had names like Charlie Colkett, Ola Aina, Jérémie Boga and Charly Musonda. Josh Onomah, who was at Spurs, was also very good as well.\n\nWhen I played for Charlton, the best players I played with were Joe Gomez, Ademola Lookman and Ezri Konsa, but I also remember playing against names like Patrick Roberts, James Maddison and Josh Sims.\n\nSA: What players did you play with growing up that ended up surprising you with their career?\n\nAB: Alex Iwobi has gone on to have an amazing career, which is well deserved and Ebere Eze, who got released quite early on.\n\nSA: Are there some key people in your Arsenal journey that you’d like to publicly appreciate that might not be known?\n\nAB: Roy Massey, Miguel Rios, David Court, Liam Brady and Steve Leonard.\n\nSA: Do you remember any names of your coaches?\n\nAB: Andy Edwards, Jamie Day and Steve Leonard are a few that I remember. They stand out to me because of their man management and personal skills. And there were also great people as well. At Charlton, I had Steve Avory, Paul Hart and Jason Euell but Karl Robinson gave me my debut.\n\nSA: Do you have some cool stories that people might not know about?\n\nAB: I remember I got invited to London Colney to meet Wenger and the first team when I was 12, which was rare at the time, and that’s a day that will forever stay with me.\n\nSA: Can you remember anyone notable coming in on trial?\n\nAB: I remember Steven Bergwijn doing a few weeks with us and Charlie Colkett, as well, before he went to Chelsea from Charlton.\n\nSA: How has your career been post-Arsenal?\n\nAB: Arsenal offered me a scholarship, but they told me they were going to be buying players from abroad so my playing time wasn’t guaranteed and plus, me and my family are very educational and Arsenal weren’t offering A-Levels at the time but Charlton were offering me to play football, do A-Levels and a BTEC. I went to Charlton with Regan Charles-Cook, from Arsenal, so the transition wasn’t too difficult, and also I knew some of the players from playing against them; I guess there was mutual respect.\n\nI did well at Charlton and then after a while there, I signed for Colchester, on deadline day, in January 2018, where things didn’t work out for me. I left in the summer of 2019, to join Dulwich Hamlet and I spent 2 Covid-ridden seasons there before signing for Welling United, in the summer of 2021, where, at this point, I was working toward being a scout and rejoined Charlton as a first-team scout in April 2021. I left Welling in the summer, and I’m now playing part-time with Hythe Town, whilst working as a first-team video scout for Stoke City.\n\nPhotos of Aaron are down below\n\nAlly is currently a personal trainer but had a stint playing professionally as a goalkeeper for clubs like Arsenal, QPR and Oxford (just to name a few). He was very happy to talk about his journey.\n\nSA: So Ally, can you remember your early football days?\n\nAFA: So first, I was playing for my primary school team and we managed to play in the Metropolitan Cup, which was the equivalent of the FA Cup, in London, for primary schools. I got spotted by the Haringey district team, which was managed by Clasford Stirling MBE.\n\nWe used to play against academies and we had a match against Reading, which we won and I pulled off 20 saves, and kept a clean sheet and after that, I had Arsenal, Man United, Chelsea, Spurs and Reading all interested to sign me when I was in year 6.\n\nMy dad asked Clasford for support, as he had become like a second dad to me and Clasford advised me to sign for Arsenal, seeing as he was already a scout there.\n\nThe very first time I went to Arsenal, I played without any training with the team and it was against Derby County and we won 14-0. We had Alex Zahavi, Sanchez Watt, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, Henri Lansbury, Tom Cruise and Chris Solly playing.\n\nSA: Who scouted you, if you remember?\n\nAFA: It was Clasford at first, but after it was a guy called Steve Leonard.\n\nSA: What does your football timeline look like?\n\nAFA: Broadwater Farm United, Arsenal, QPR, Wimbledon, Orduspor, West Ham United, Oxford City and Welling United.\n\nSA: Who were your favourite coaches?\n\nAFA: At Arsenal, it was Steve Leonard, Alex Welsh (who was the goalkeeping coach), Steve Bould and Dermot Drummy but elsewhere, it was Héctor Cúper, who managed my team, Orduspor, in Turkey and for the Turkish national team, Fatih Terim.\n\nSA: Do you have some funny or cool stories of your young playing days?\n\nAFA: Yes, when I was away in Turkey, my teammates did a Brazilian birthday-style prank on me. They washed my head with eggs and flour, which was surprisingly funny.\n\nI’d say it was cool to play in Turkey. I got to play against some great players like Alex de Souza, Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder.\n\nSA: Can you remember anyone notable coming in on trial to your clubs when you played?\n\nAFA: At QPR, I remember we had Chris Smalling come in and Neil Warnock said thought he was not good enough.\n\nSA: Who were the best players that you’ve played with and against and also, trained with at a young age?\n\nAFA: The best players I played with are Gabriel Iancu and David Barral, who is a good friend and teammate. I played against Alex de Souza and he was amazing.\n\nThe most talented players I played with are Alex Zahavi, Emmanuel Frimpong and Jack Wilshere. Alex left Arsenal at 14 and signed for Barcelona after, Emmanuel is a still good friend and was a good player and Jack was amazing as well.\n\nI played two years above my age group at times at Arsenal so I got to play with older players but my actual age group consisted of Benik Afobe, Jason Banton and Harry Kane but seeing as I was much more developed compared to my actual age, they moved me two years up.\n\nSA: What players did you interact with growing up that ended up surprising you with their career?\n\nAFA: Harry Kane and Hakan Çalhanoğlu.\n\nSA: Were there any teams that you feared playing against?\n\nAFA: No because at Arsenal, we didn’t lose a game for 4 years and that included beating Real Madrid, AC Milan and Ajax.\n\nSA: What happened post-Arsenal for you?\n\nAFA: I left Arsenal because I had a meeting with Liam Brady and he asked me if I would play for England as they watched us in the Nike Cup and I said no. I was already called up by Turkey and he didn’t like it and I got released cause of the choice I made. I was going to sign with Liverpool after but I broke my arm, which hindered my progress as I was out for a long time. To be honest, I was left in turmoil by Arsenal because I used to play and train with the older boys like Ross Kitteridge and James Shea, they even offered me an early scholarship and I still got released. At the time, Arsenal had Wojciech Szczęsny and Emiliano Martínez then signed for Arsenal after I left.\n\nI eventually got a contract at QPR and that snowballed me into having a good career until I had to retire when I was at West Ham United last in 2015 because of elbow pain.\n\nNow, I am a strength and conditioning coach. I also do personal training and bodybuilding is my passion.\n\nPhotos of Ally Ferhat Aksoy are down below"
