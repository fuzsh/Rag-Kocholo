        "text": "THE LAST week of Serie A before the winter break plays host one of the greatest derby in league football.\n\nThe Derby della Madonnina between Inter and Milan. Since both clubs play at the same stadium, it creates an atmosphere unlike any other. Milan and Inter go into the derby in 13th and 5th place, respectively. Milan have clearly been struggling, while Inter have been up and down the entire season so far. Believe it or not, Milan will be heading into the match off the back of a 5 match unbeaten streak, albeit a draw-filled one.\n\nWith both clubs needing a win from the derby, expect it to be a very exciting 90 minutes. There will be goals. There will be cards. And there will be magic from one of the sides.\n\nVideo: All of Kaka’s goals against Inter\n\nInter-Milan: The Rossoneri squad\n\nFor Milan, a victory over their city rivals will boost spirits and hope that a comeback ala last season is possible. However, a loss will only serve to tighten the noose around Allegri’s neck, and will really dishearten the Rossoneri players. However, a draw may well be the end result, as both clubs have not made a habit of killing off matches.\n\nInter will be looking to expose Milan’s weakness in defending set pieces, and could very well score a goal off a corner or free kick. They will also be riling up Balotelli, but that should be no different than most other Milan matches. But the flip side is that Inter’s defense has not been much better this season, and Milan’s attacking combo of Balotelli and Kaka will look to expose any defensive frailties.\n\nThe Squads\n\nGoalkeepers: Handanovic, Carrizo, Castellazzi;\n\nDefenders: Jonathan, Zanetti, Juan, Andreolli, Campagnaro, Wallace, Ranocchia, Samuel, Pereira, Rolando, Nagatomo;\n\nMidfielders: Kovacic, Guarin, Mudingayi, Kuzmanovic, Cambiasso, Taider;\n\nForwards: Belfodil, Palacio, Icardi.\n\nGoalkeepers: Abbiati, Coppola, Gabriel;\n\nDefenders: Bonera, Constant, De Sciglio, Mexes, Zaccardo, Zapata;\n\nMidfielders: Cristante, Emanuelson, De Jong, Kakà, Muntari, Nocerino, Poli, Saponara;\n\nForwards: Balotelli, Matri, Pazzini.\n\nSuspensions and Injuries\n\nInter have significantly less members missing from their squad. Cristian Chivu, Diego Milito, McDonald Mariga, and Walter Samuel are all injured, while Ricky Alvarez is suspended.\n\nMilan will have to do without Marco Amelia, Valter Birsa, Stephan El Shaarawy, Robinho, and Matías Silvestre, who are all injured and will not take part. Abate and Emanuelson are doubtful, but are both included in the squad. Captain Riccardo Montolivo will miss the match due to yellow card accumulation after his yellow against Roma last week. M’Baye Niang was not included in the squad all together, most likely so as not to inure him before his proposed loan move to Montpellier.\n\nWhere: Stadio Guissepe Meaza (San Siro).\n\nWhen: 14:45 pm Eastern US, 18:45 pm GMT, 20:45 pm CET.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nInter: Handanovic; Jesus, Ranocchia, Campagnaro; Nagatomo, Kovacic, Cambiasso, Taider, Jonothan; Guarin, Palacio.\n\nMilan: Abbiati; De Sciglio, Bonera, Zapata, Constant; Poli, De Jong, Muntari; Kaka; Matri, Balotelli. (via WhoScored.com)\n\nPrediction: 2-2\n\nWhat do you think about the derby? Comment or tweet me @Daniel_gutman"
