        "text": "August 17, 2020\n\nInteressanti aneddoti della vita di un fuoriclasse che ha fatto la fortuna soprattutto del Milan. Bello conoscere finalmente il dietro le quinte di molti degli avvenimenti storici calcistici che l'hanno visto protagonista.\n\nMay 31, 2013\n\nThis is a must read especially for A.C. Milan fans. It tells you insight about Milan and what it means to become a Milan fan.\n\nApart from that this is book is a page-turner. There are so many interesting stories and I have to mustered my strength not to laugh out like mad man.\n\nThis book is not about football tactics, management or backroom negotiations. It's a story about a man who has win so much as a player and as a manager.\n\nMy only disappointment is that the cover picture should not be him with Chelsea shirt because (1) there's not much chelsea-related story and (2) ultimately, he has identified himself so strongly with A.C. Milan, the cover should be him with Milan shirt.\n\nIn the end, buy the book and enjoy the ride.\n\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\nThe pig can coach!\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s list of achievements are sublime, both as a player and as a coach. He is one of the few managers in today’s game that has won both the Champions leagues as a player and as a coach. A self-confessed foodie, one can be forgiven if every now and again you have to keep telling yourself that this book is about football and not an ode to Italian food. While this book occasionally comes across as light hearted, its essence is that Carlo Ancelotti is passionate about football and pasta.\n\nFor someone who follows the English football league, I am embarrassed to say that I don’t know enough about the other leagues. This book gives an invaluable insight in to the glory days of AC Milan through the late eighties, when they were completely unstoppable! What stood out for me, was that as far back as 1986, certain coaches had already identified the need for mental strength trainers and the AC Milan coach at the time, Arrigo Sachi, employed one to great effect.\n\nAncelotti glosses over his playing career and focuses on his ‘how and why’ reasons that got him into coaching. He does not give much away in terms of secrets, but it’s evident that he has an analytical brain when it to comes to football. Tactically astute to the point of admitting that a coach needs to change his formation to the strengths of his players. A point proven by his breakthrough at AC Milan (Ancelotti’s infamous Christmas tree formation). What is interesting is when you look at his career, his best work was done over an extended period of time at AC Milan, uncharacteristically long for a coach in football. What more possible proof do you need that keeping the faith brings out a person’s best work?\n\nStill coaching today, still passionate about football and pasta. One of the unsung heroes of the footballing world. A true gentleman and a scholar, on most days, if you believe what he has written.\n\nJanuary 9, 2018\n\nThis sports bio of Ancelotti provides a fun and (apparently) laid back view of one from the inside of the game. Of course he is an expert of the game and of the details, but he spare us of the analytical views and analysis. We are shown things as of in his own eyes, from a first person perspective: no filters by a kind , passionate and in love with the game coach.\n\nIt covers his beginning as a player to his carreer as a coach and this where it focus:\n\nAncelotti is one kind of a coach and his approach to players and to the game is shown by him in this book trough is very personal narrative. He doesnt spare us of the details, no, the dirty game, the locker dramas, his personal and intimate opinion of the players and people involved in the business are all layed here trough the path of people and clubes from where he has passed.\n\nHe doesnt focus so much on tactics but more on the his observations of the phenomenon\n\nWorth every minute for me.\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nThis book written by Carlo Ancelotti, is one of the more enjoyable books I have ever read. As a soccer/football fan, but also a writer, it was a fantastic read beyond its value for sporting fans. Great prose, good jokes, fun stories. Don Carlo elegantly highlights how despite the consistent backlash from tacticos, he is indeed an ordinary genius. And he has continue to expand his legacy since the release of this book.\n\nAnd I greatly look forward to reading the next book of his, \"Quiet Leadership\".\n\nMarch 10, 2020\n\nVery beautiful piece of writing, and an insightful behind the scenes of the managerial years of Carletto as captured in this book.\n\nGattuso eating a live snail?! No, I don't want to believe that! But, if the culprit is Gattuso then it is definitely true!\n\nSeptember 6, 2017\n\nFantastic.\n\nEnjoyed it from the beginning to the end.\n\nApril 27, 2018\n\nA nice anecdotal book describing some of the very important incident ancelotti as s player and then as a coach\n\nMay 10, 2018\n\nIf you love European football, this is a very entertaining read.\n\nJune 25, 2022\n\nuno dei personaggi migliori e con più cose da raccontare nel mondo del calcio. grande biografia\n\nJanuary 1, 2023\n\nGrande allenatore, i racconti dei suoi colleghi e ex calciatori arricchiscono tantissimo un libro già stracolmi di aneddoti e contenuti.\n\nBig Carlo portaci sempre in alto\n\nMarch 1, 2017\n\nlibro semplice e divertente da leggere, buona sintassi, si legge facilmente. curiosi alcuni aneddoti, sicuramente consigliato per rilassarsi e farsi due risate\n\nDecember 4, 2014\n\nI simply love this man. I am a big fan of Real Madrid CF, so, when he came to coach us after Mourinho left, I was interested in knowing more about him. Because, you know, all the players said that the dressing room was tumultuous, divided and so tension filled under Mourinho. And it was Ancelotti, who bought calm and stability to the dressing room along with it La Decima. So, I thought I'll read about him...\n\nHis sense of humour is superb, he can laugh at himself, many anecdotes mentioned here talk about his love for food, his lighter side. He also talks about his style of managing, his love for football and other stuff. After knowing more about his way of doing things, I can see why players like him so much. Although, I must say that few, just a few chapters are little boring, but that's only because, I know very little about Italian football at 1990s.\n\nNot just for A C Milan fans, any football fan can read it. Apart from his anecdotes, experiences, his humour makes it an interesting read. Hence rating 4.\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\nI picked up this book eager to read into the life of a Champions League winner - which he won as a player and twice as a manager. He was also the manager who lost the famous final to Liverpool after leading 3-0.\n\nI should also point out that I am not a Chelsea fan, but a Man Utd fan.\n\nFirstly, this book was very enjoyable and written in such a way that the pages flowed easily. At times the chronology is a little hard to follow but they may have been because it was from the 80s and the peiod of his career which I knew nothing about.\n\nYou do not need to be a fan of one of his clubs to appreciate this book.\n\nI had hoped for some sort of insight into tactics or motivation, but it steers clear from those 'trade secrets'. I guess the angle I desired would not have made the most commercially attractive book.\n\nStill, if you are interested in football this is a decent enough read.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about Italian football, then read The Italian Job by Marcotti and Gianluca Vialli.\n\nAugust 24, 2011\n\nThis is a very funny book, full of anecdotes, not just soccer related but also personal stories by Carlo Ancelotti, a great player as well as a successful coach. When you see Ancelotti by the sidelines giving instructions to his players, it is hard to imagine that behind that intense focus and dedication there is a person who can even make fun of himself and his never ending passion for food. This book is not so much an autobiography, but rather the book covers mainly stories about his time as a player and as a coach. Through the pages of this book we experience Carlo's lowest moments (as in bitter defeat) as well as his greatest triumphs. The book doesn't disappoint. Even if you are not a fan of Ancelotti's teams or strategies, you are sure to enjoy reading about great names in soccer in the last 30 years.\n\nJuly 16, 2011\n\nThis was tremendously entertaining. However, it was with great remorse that I read about one of my favorite coaches in the beautiful game. That is, Chelsea my dear club unceremoniously fired dear Carletto Ancelotti this year. I felt is was truly disgraceful and completely inappropriate. Had we left Carletto to do what Alex Ferguson has done in Manchester we would have clearly been a better club for it. However, it appears Mr. Abramovich had no patience for a trophyless season and we're starting over yet again. I'll hope for the best with Andre Villas-Boas, but I will be watching Carletto and wishing him well as he was a true genius of tactical formations and a true gentleman. Arrivederci e buona fortuna, Carletto. Grazie.\n\nJanuary 24, 2014\n\nانا كأي شخص مهتم في الكورة، سبب اقتنائي لهذا الكتاب بعد حصول تشلسي على الدوري الانجليزي وحبيت أتعرف اكثر على المدرب اللي جاء لتشلسي وغيره لفريق قوي هجومي. الكتاب ما مجمل يتكلم عن حياة انشأ وأي وبداياته في روما كلاعب الى مدرب في تشلسي(الكتاب قبل ما يروح مدريد) منجما انصح فيه وبقوه، طبعا الكتاب نادر ما يتطرق عن الناحية التكتيكية للمدرب كان التركيز على حياته على الصعيد الشخصي.\n\nThis book one of the best books that I read in a while, the book about Carlo the person outside the field outside the football strategy, although it focus how he was doing as a player and how he felt to couch for the first time. In the end I recommend it to anyone how like football in general.\n\nMay 13, 2015\n\nThe book is pretty interesting and provided lot of insights how Ancelotti became the coach he is.\n\nHe talked about how his flaws, his idols and players he worked with.\n\nHis achievements are staggering in terms of trophies and leagues won as player and coach.\n\nThe book captures all of the stories and incidents of Ancelotti.\n\nThe introduction of book is good with Chelsea and ends on same note.\n\nI am looking forward to reading his book on life after Chelsea and more of his rebuilding with PSG and his dream job at Real Madrid.\n\nJuly 12, 2015\n\nwhat an extraordinary book! biographies usually are chronological but not this one. carletto shares his memories in an absolutely untidy way and reading it is such a pleasure. i laughed so much, its written super funny, ancelotti has a big heart and great sense of humor and really big distance to himself.\n\ni wish i could read some memories of his work in RM but in genereal i absolutely loved this book. he is a great man and i am so sad he is leaving my favurite team...\n\nJanuary 29, 2016\n\nDa interista ma amante del calcio ho deciso di leggere questo libro dopo aver letto una frase su fb tratta da questa biografia. Questo libro farebbe innamorare di ancelotti qualsiasi sportivo indipendente dalla fede calcistica... Un grande uomo e un grande allenatore.. Peccato averlo visto sempre con i colori sbagliati :)\n\nOgni tanto mi piace leggere libri leggeri e questo secondo me è molto bella da leggere in periodi in cui non si vuole leggere libri più \"spensierati\"\n\nMay 12, 2015\n\nIn harrods there was a small bookstore and after I searched for the book everywhere I finally found it. Amazing book specially because am a hugs Milan fan it showed me insight from back in the glory days. I recommend this book for every calcio fan to be frank. Bellissimo !!!\n\nDecember 18, 2016\n\nOne of the most humorous, light hearted and insightful narration of one of the top most manager/players around.\n\nIt could also be termed almost an satire on the tough life of a football managers or managing any tough job for that matter.\n\nSeptember 10, 2015\n\nLibro davvero piacevole, da leggere in una giornata. La storia del grande Mister è raccontata schiettamente e con un costante velo di ironia che trasmette immediatamente una forte simpatia in Carletto Ancelotti."
