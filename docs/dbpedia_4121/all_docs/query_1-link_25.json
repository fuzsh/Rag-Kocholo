        "text": "Manchester City have won the UEFA Champions League to complete the treble, defeating Inter Milan 1-0 in the final.\n\nRodri’s second-half goal won the game for Pep Guardiola’s side, with Ederson making a vital late save to deny Romelu Lukaku.\n\nEleven players have represented Manchester City and Inter Milan. Let's take a look back at some of the most interesting examples:\n\nEdin Dzeko: The City cult hero with a chance to break their hearts tonight. Dzeko famously scored the equalising goal that allowed Sergio Aguero to score his Premier League-winning goal in 2012. The 127-cap Bosnian has been with Inter since 2021 scoring 31 goals in 100 appearances.\n\nPatrick Vieira: Vieira retired with City in 2011, having spent the previous four seasons in Milan.\n\nAleksandar Kolarov: The thunder-footed left-back spent his best years with City, winning two Premier Leagues in seven seasons before joining Roma and eventually retiring with Inter in 2022.\n\nJoao Cancelo: The Portuguese full-back, who could still earn a winners medal tonight despite being eliminated by City while on loan with Bayern, spent the 2017-18 season with Inter on loan from Valencia.\n\nMaicon: Arguably the best right-back in the world during his Inter days, the Brazilian struggled for fitness and form in England, making just 13 appearances in his one season at City.\n\nMario Balotelli: The maverick striker won the Champions League with Inter in 2010 before joining City, embedding himself into Premier League history for his eccentric behaviour. Joining the BT Sport coverage tonight, the journeyman scored 6 goals this season as he was relegated with Swiss side Sion.\n\nThe other players are Stevan Jovetic, Felipe Caicedo, David Pizarro, Ousmane Dabo and Bernardo Corradi.\n\nRoberto Mancini is the only person to have managed both teams.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the only player in either of today's teams to have previously won the Champions League is Manchester City's third-choice goalkeeper, Scott Carson.\n\nCarson was an unused sub as Liverpool came from 3-0 down to win the 2005 final against AC Milan.\n\nThe former England international offered his medal to Chris Kirkland, who couldn't make the bench due to injury, because he played more games during the competition than him — an offer which Kirkland turned down.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nThe Ataturk Olympic Stadium will host its second Champions League final today, having hosted Liverpool and AC Milan's famous meeting in 2005.\n\nThe stadium was originally supposed to host the 2020 final between Bayern Munich and Paris-Saint Germain but was delayed twice due to Covid-19.\n\nOpened in 2002, the stadium was built for Turkey's ultimately unsuccessful 2008 Olympics bid and named after the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 74,753, albeit the record attendance was recorded at 79,414 for a friendly between Galatasaray and Olympiacos in July 2002.\n\nIn addition to being the home of the Turkish national team, several Istanbul clubs (Galatasaray, Besiktas, Kasimpasa, Istanbul Basaksehir) have played at the stadium while theirs were undergoing construction or renovation. Fatih Karagumruk, who recently sacked coach Andrea Pirlo, have been the sole club tenant since 2020.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nGreatest Champions League final upsets\n\nNo prizes for seeing this one coming.\n\nIt's only fitting that for our final inclusion of the greatest upsets, we return to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium, the location of today's game, to see a north-western English team defeating a Milan side in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe Italians had the lead within the first minute as Paolo Maldini headed Andrea Pirlo's free kick home. A Hernan Crespo double late in the half seemingly wrapped up the trophy for Milan, who led 3-0 going into the break.\n\nHowever, Liverpool famously fought back in the second half. Steven Gerrard and Vladimir Smicer scored in the 54th and 56th minutes before Xabi Alonso levelled the match just five minutes later.\n\nBoth teams had several chances to win it in normal and extra time, but the game would be decided by penalties. After Serginho and Pirlo missed, Liverpool had the advantage. Jerzy Dudek became a hero by denying Andriy Shevchenko, who scored the winning penalty in the 2003 final, to secure the greatest comeback in Champions League final history.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nMario Balotelli will be a pundit for BT Sport’s coverage of today's Champions League final for audiences across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe former Manchester City striker has not appeared as a pundit on English television before.\n\nThe 32-year-old spent three years with City, making 54 appearances and scoring 20 goals. He also played for Liverpool in England. Balotelli has had spells with Inter Milan, AC Milan, Nice, Marseille, Brescia, Monza and Adana Demirspor during his playing career.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nGreatest Champions League final upsets\n\nThe miracle of Munich: Chelsea beat Bayern in their own stadium to win this competition for the first time.\n\nUnder the stewardship of caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo following the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas, Chelsea defeated Napoli, Benfica and Barcelona in dramatic fashion en route to an unlikely win.\n\nShrugging off the heartbreak of losing the 2008 final in Moscow on penalties, Chelsea would have to do it without Branislav Ivanovic, Raul Meireles, Ramires and John Terry, who were all suspended from the semi-final; their absence compounded by injury concerns.\n\nChelsea edged through the game, looking extremely unlikely to survive on several occasions and when Thomas Muller gave Bayern the lead in the 83rd minute, they seemed dead and buried... and they were, but for the efforts of Didier Drogba whose late equaliser forced the game into extra time.\n\nDrogba's script was not over though. In what would be his last game before leaving the club, he gave away a penalty but was bailed out by Petr Cech, who denied former team-mate Arjen Robben from the spot.\n\nEnding in the most Hollywood of fashions, Cech saved Ivica Olic and Bastian Schweinsteiger's penalties, setting up the opportunity for the legendary Ivorian to score the winning penalty.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nManchester City owner Sheikh Mansour is planning to attend today's final, nearly 13 years after he last attended a competitive match.\n\nThe vice-president of the United Arab Emirates has travelled to Turkey to watch City take on Inter Milan at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium.\n\nSince buying the club in 2008, Mansour has attended just one competitive game, at home to Liverpool in August 2010, in addition to two exhibition matches in Abu Dhabi.\n\nMansour is the brother of the current president of the UAE, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nayhan. He is also married to Sheikha Manal bint Mohammed Al Maktoum, who is the daughter of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nGreatest Champions League final upsets\n\nBoth of Porto's Champions League titles are contenders. They came from behind to shock Bayern in the 1987 final, but I'm opting to highlight the 2004 final.\n\nWhile Monaco themselves were far from favourites to win the tournament, Porto's victory is worthy of a place on this list for the story it tells.\n\nTaking over a fifth-placed Porto in January 2002, Jose Mourinho cobbled together a team, signing players such as Paulo Ferreira from smaller Portuguese teams, cast-offs from big teams like Maniche and developing young players like Ricardo Carvalho and Deco.\n\nPromising to make Porto winners in his first full season in 2002-03, Mourinho delivered more, brining back a quadruple of trophies including the UEFA Cup in a landmark victory against Henrik Larsson's Celtic.\n\nThe next year, Porto won the league again and the Champions League. In the immortal words of Mourinho: \"Beating Partizan Belgrade, Real Madrid, Marseille, Lyon, Manchester United, please do no call me arrogant because what I am saying is true, I am European champion, I'm not one of the bottle, I think I am a special one.\"\n\nWhat a storyline.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)\n\nGreatest Champions League final upsets\n\nWhile the match itself is remembered as a boring game of negative football, its significance was enormous as Steaua Bucharest became the first team to win the European Cup from behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nSo little did either team seemingly want to score, even the first four penalties were saved by the goalkeepers, Helmuth Duckadam of Steaua and Francisco Urruticoechea of Barcelona.\n\nDuckadam undeniably goes down as the hero, saving a record four penalties and keeping a clean sheet. Interestingly enough, centre-back Miodrag Belodedici was also part of the aforementioned Red Star team.\n\nThe crowd in Seville was almost entirely Barcelona fans, with only 50 vetted Steaua supporters allowed to travel by repressive communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu (one-third of which defected instead of returning home) only feeding into the uniqueness of the spectacle.\n\nThe victory of the side from Romania undeniably marks one of the greatest Champions League final upsets of all time.\n\n(All photos by Getty Images)"
