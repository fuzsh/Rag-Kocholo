        "text": "Unlike most jobs, sportsmen’s professional path is very short. The average length of their career is just 10 years. The number includes athletes who give up sports early but even most successful retire in their 30s. Traditionally, the next step after retirement is becoming a coach but salaries are not comparable and there simply cannot be so many coaches.\n\nInstead of competing with others in training careers some sportsmen use their wealth, fame and connections to start a business.\n\nFrom the very start of a career most talented sportsmen sign dozens of advertising contracts with different companies. For example, sports brands such as Nike or Adidas hunt for young football players providing them with free equipment and later rewarding them for wearing their clothes. Sportsmen become the face of food, beverages, clothing companies, car manufacturers and perfume. But as their professional career finishes, they become less marketable. To make the most of their fame smartest sportsmen found their personal brand.\n\nMicheal Jordan is considered the best basketball player ever and one of the most famous sportsmen. But he would never become a billionaire just for playing basketball. Jordan earned $90 million in playing salary during his 15-year playing career. His partnership with Nike and Air Jordan brand brought him at least 20 times more as his net worth is 1.9 billion now.\n\nThis is bright but fat from the only example of a sportsman starting a personal brand. Cristiano Ronaldo has his own perfume, underwear and hotel chain, David Beckham has his perfume, eyewear, and clothing, Maria Sharapova founded premium candy line “Shugarpova” and former Barcelona football player Andres Iniesta started to produce his own wine.\n\nActivity of famous sports goes far beyond creating their personal brand. Conor McGeregor produces his whiskey “Proper Twelve” without using his name on a logo but promotes his beverage energetically. Some sportsmen do not even limit their occupation with business and become politicians. Retired football player Romario is famous for his games for the Brazilian national team. He won the World Cup in 1994 and became the best player in the tournament. Now he is president of the party in the State of Rio de Janeiro. In 2018 former AC Milan player George Whea became president of Liberia. Being one of the most influential people in his country as a sportsman helped him in reaching career heights in politics.\n\nEven though successful sportsmen earn much more than average professionals it does not guarantee untroubled future and financial stability.\n\nEmmanuel Eboue’s salary in Arsenal was 2,5 million euro but it clearly was not enough. Due to risky financial decisions and failed marriage he lost most of his money. In 2017 he revealed that he has to sleep on his friend’s floor. Emmanuel said that his wife, Aurelie, took everything he had including their three children, mansion, cars and their first house in North London where he was ordered by a court to surrender ownership.\n\nThe latest update was that he was invited by Fatih Terim to become a coach of 14 year’s old team in Galatasaray. Hopefully, this story became cautionary for him and all young sportsmen.\n\nIt goes without saying that the professional career of an athlete opens wide opportunities for a sportsman even beyond the sport itself. And besides a high salary, the great advantage is the ability to grow a fanbase and build relationships with the audience. It can help sportsmen significantly even after their retirement. In the 2020s the best way to create such a background is to start communicating with supporters. Sportsmen have a lock of everyone’s attention and it is irrational not to use it."
