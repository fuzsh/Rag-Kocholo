        "text": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Former Turkey coach Fatih Terim left Greek club Panathinaikos on Friday, with one game still to go this season.\n\nPanathinaikos named Christos Kontis, a former assistant manager at the club, as his replacement in a caretaker role.\n\nThe 70-year-old Terim said in an online post that he was ending his five-month stint with the club after a meeting with the owners.\n\n“Our plans for the 2024-2025 season were not aligned,” said Terim, who won eight championship titles in his homeland as manager of Galatasaray.\n\nHe thanked Panathinaikos fans and club staff, adding: “I sincerely wish Panathinaikos a successful future.”\n\nUnder Terim, Panathinaikos remained in contention for the title before slipping to fourth place after three successive defeats, losing 4-1 to PAOK in Thessaloniki Wednesday.\n\nLeague leader PAOK takes on city rival Aris in Sunday’s final round. A defeat could hand the title to second-placed AEK Athens, which hosts Lamia.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
