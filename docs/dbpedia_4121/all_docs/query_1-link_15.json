        "text": "Carlo Ancelotti has become the first manager to win the title in all five major European leagues when Real Madrid beat Espanyol on Saturday. So how did he do it? Our writers explain the skill and the individual challenges he overcame in each of the triumphs…\n\nMilan 2003-04: ‘Nasty’ outburst helps ‘successful loser’ take title\n\n“A pig can’t coach.” You’d have to say the banner hasn’t aged well. Juventus’ ultras didn’t hold Carlo Ancelotti in high esteem. He was from farmer’s stock and had maybe let himself go a bit since his playing days. The contrast with his predecessor, the cigar-smoking, silver fox Marcello Lippi, who wouldn’t have looked out of place sunbathing on Gianni Agnelli’s yacht, was stark.\n\nIt seems strange now but Ancelotti was known at the time as il perdente di successo — the successful loser. Juventus lost the title on the final day in 2000 when a downpour in Perugia waterlogged the pitch. Pierluigi Collina maybe should have postponed the game but the show had to go on and Alessandro Calori’s goal sparked celebrations in Rome where Lazio were declared champions of Italy.\n\nA year later, Ancelotti came up agonisingly short again and the Triad running Juventus didn’t care he’d amassed 144 points over two seasons (in an 18-team league). As the Juventus motto goes, winning isn’t important, it’s the only thing that counts. And when Lippi delivered the title upon his return to the club, it was used against Ancelotti. Soon enough though, he’d take his revenge.\n\nMilan got rid of Fatih Terim in the winter of 2001 after a defeat to Torino. They were fifth in the table (Chievo were top) and the story, as Ancelotti tells it, was that the club’s chief executive Adriano Galliani wanted a better dining companion. Terim apparently ordered the worst dish on the menu, didn’t drink and left the impression he’d rather watch Big Brother than spend time with the Milan hierarchy. “He wanted to see if the housemates f**ked,” Ancelotti wrote. “They did, then Milan f**ked him.”\n\nIt was a homecoming for Ancelotti who had spent five years as a player at Milan winning the Scudetto twice and the European Cup in back-to-back seasons. The atmosphere at Milanello was like that of a family, far warmer than the cold corporate feel he’d experienced at Juventus.\n\nStereotypes of him as an avuncular, quiet leader indulgent in his man-management of star players have subsequently come to define Ancelotti. But he upset his old team-mate Demetrio Albertini by benching him and still maintains the turning point at Milan came after a “disgraceful” 2-0 defeat in Bologna in 2002 when he smashed up the dressing room and chewed out each and every one of his players. “I got personal,” he recalled. “I was nasty on purpose. I told them it’s one thing to make stupid mistakes and another to actually be stupid like they all seemed at that moment. That outburst shook them up and our season changed for the better.”\n\nMilan qualified for the Champions League and would eliminate Inter in the semi-finals before getting the better of Juventus in the shootout that decided the final at Old Trafford. It would lead Ancelotti to joke: “I prefer the Coppa”, a wink and a raised eyebrow at the double entendre between the Italian word for Cup and his favourite slice on the salumi board provided by the most “sacred” animal on the farm; the pig.\n\nThe Scudetto that had so far eluded Ancelotti arrived the following year. Winning the Champions League had not been enough on its own to silence his critics. In fact, Ancelotti’s game plan for the final had ended up in the hands of Bruno Vespa, one of Italy’s most famous journalists and television hosts, who included them in a book and seemed to pass them off as the work of Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nMilan’s owner always fancied himself as a master tactician and appeared jealous of the praise showered on his coaches. “I’m the one who built Milan over the last 18 years,” he said. “Why do they only talk about Capello, Sacchi and Ancelotti?”\n\nEven after a 3-2 win in the Derby della Madonnina in the spring of 2004, Berlusconi thought he knew better. As was the case when Alberto Zaccheroni won the Scudetto five years earlier with a team that played three at the back, Ancelotti’s Christmas Tree was not to his taste. “From Monday onwards, every Milan coach will be obliged to play two strikers,” Berlusconi said. “If not, you can think again about coaching Milan. I’m going to write a letter to the coach and the club. It can’t happen anymore.”\n\nOutbursts like that can seriously undermine a coach. Take Dino Zoff for instance. Zoff’s intention was to remain in position after Italy lost the Euro 2000 final to France on account of a golden goal scored by David Trezeguet in extra time. However, he reconsidered after Berlusconi heavily criticised his performance in the press. Zoff’s dignity was so offended he resigned.\n\nAncelotti on the other hand never lost his aplomb. Backed by a skilled diplomat in Galliani, he too learned how to manage up. Ancelotti continued to play Andriy Shevchenko as a lone striker. Milan became champions with two games to spare.\n\nShevchenko finished Capocannoniere with 24 goals and would win the Ballon d’Or that year. “The game on a Sunday was the easy bit,” he says. “During the week, when you played against Paolo (Maldini) and (Alessandro) Nesta in training, they were a lot more compact than any defence we faced. Carlo didn’t want us playing games in training at that time. They were tough and competitive and you risked getting injured in them more than during a game. It’s the truth.”\n\nKaka was the difference that season. No one had ever heard of him and Ancelotti thought he was collecting a university student on an Erasmus exchange when the player came through arrivals at Malpensa. Jaws dropped to the floor in his first training session as Rino Gattuso decided to go in hard on him only to be shrugged off with ease as Kaka then proceeded to catch out Nesta with a perfectly hit 30-yard through-ball.\n\nHis integration was yet more proof if more were necessary that Ancelotti was no longer the Sacchi fundamentalist who had sold Gianfranco Zola and turned down the chance to sign Roberto Baggio at Parma because no role for a No 10 existed in his rigid 4-4-2. Managing Zinedine Zidane at Juventus had changed Ancelotti and the Christmas Tree he inaugurated at Milan would evolve from having Manuel Rui Costa and Rivaldo off the front-man to Kaka and Clarence Seedorf.\n\nThe team was outrageously talented and came back from losing the Intercontinental Cup to Boca Juniors to chase down Francesco Totti and Antonio Cassano’s Roma, the winter champions in Serie A, who got themselves six points in front while Milan were in Tokyo.\n\nOn May 2, a showdown at San Siro ended in title euphoria. The line-up against Roma that night was the same that had capitulated in another tie against Deportivo a few weeks earlier, one that would foreshadow Istanbul. The Scudetto helped cancel it out.\n\nAs Milan became champions, the clouds above San Siro burst and Ancelotti came full circle. “It’s the same rain as that day (in Perugia in 2000),” he said. “The difference is that was acid rain, this is sweet. The memory of Perugia burned. Now it burns no more.”\n\nWidely viewed as the last great Milan side, Shevchenko marvels at its place in the football pantheon and how teams gain access to it. “When you coach great players, they have to believe games can come down to the last 10 seconds. If you believe that, then you can win the Champions League at the end,” he says. That’s what Milan did in 2003 and Liverpool did unto them in 2005. “This is the beauty of football,” he continues, “but you need to build the right mentality. Just look at Carlo’s Real.”\n\nChelsea 2009-10: ‘Humble’ nature eases tensions over Abramovich’s high expectations\n\nIn the week Ancelotti started work at Chelsea, his predecessor, Luiz Felipe Scolari, conducted an interview essentially warning the Italian he was entering a nest of vipers.\n\n“The real power in football at the moment lies with the players,” the former Brazil manager told O Globo back in his homeland. “The coach, at the vast majority of European clubs, has no strength to contradict them. Yet the people who are sacked are always the coaches, and the major players know this. My problem at Chelsea was that guys like Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack and Petr Cech never accepted my training methods or what I was asking of them.”\n\nIt should be acknowledged that, while that trio had spoken with the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and discussed Scolari’s management style and training methods, the players denied deliberately seeking to undermine their head coach. Regardless, Scolari lasted barely seven months in his role at Stamford Bridge. His replacement, the interim manager Guus Hiddink, instigated a recovery to steer the team to a Champions League semi-final, third place in the Premier League and victory in the FA Cup final.\n\nBut, as Ancelotti took up the reins following his departure from Milan, the sense was that Chelsea’s standards had slightly slipped. Certainly from those established over Jose Mourinho’s three full seasons in charge.\n\nThe landscape had changed in the period since. Manchester United had re-established their grip on the Premier League and claimed the title three years in succession. Manchester City were nouveaux riches a year into the Abu Dhabi ownership and threatening to disrupt the established elite. Rafael Benitez’s Liverpool appeared contenders. Even Tottenham Hotspur, under Harry Redknapp, were stirring. In-house at Stamford Bridge there were doubts swirling over John Terry’s contractual situation, with the captain having written an open letter to supporters over the summer stressing that third place “isn’t good enough for Chelsea any more”.\n\nThe new man was inheriting an ageing group largely assembled over Mourinho’s tenure and reputedly difficult to control. He was also being asked to meet the same objectives confronted by Scolari 12 months previously: to wrest domestic dominance from United and secure the club’s first European Cup. All, of course, while playing a scintillating brand of football to please the owner.\n\nPlenty of those objectives were met over his first season in charge.\n\nWhere Scolari, who had spent the previous seven years as an international manager with Brazil and Portugal, struggled to deliver the intensity to training that the senior core of players expected, Ancelotti won over a strong-willed, demanding group from the outset. His blend of hard work and good humour gained him friends at Cobham. There were no political murmurings of discontent over that first campaign in charge, which actually felt refreshing.\n\nAncelotti attended a two-week language course in Amsterdam to learn English, a reflection of his determination to build a strong and positive rapport with his squad upon arrival. When he did struggle, he leaned on the late Ray Wilkins, his No 2, as an interpreter. His mantra was to talk “with”, rather than “to”, his players. “We work hard on the training ground and, off the pitch, we are fairly light-hearted around the place,” said Frank Lampard at the time. “We’ve been like that all season.\n\n“Carlo understands what it is to be a player and what he has to do as a manager. He is laid-back, but when he speaks he speaks with authority. He doesn’t show any tension because he doesn’t want his players being tense. And he has that focus you need. It must have been an eye-opener coming to a new country, a new culture, but he’s done very well.”\n\nWilkins had witnessed the reverence in which Milan’s players still held Ancelotti when the teams met in a pre-season friendly in Baltimore and spoke almost in awe of the Italian’s ability to relax potentially tense situations with a joke or a timely raise of that maverick eyebrow. His man-management set him apart.\n\n“The key to Carlo’s management is his personality: humble and down to earth,” says Paul Clement, who had worked his way up from academy coach at Chelsea into the first-team set-up, and who struck up such a fine working relationship with Ancelotti that he followed him to Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. “There’s no arrogance to him, even with everything he’s achieved in the game. Players warm to him straight away. He can be strong when he needs to be but likes to speak to people on the same level. His attitude is very much, ‘We’re both men, let’s talk’.\n\n“He is open-minded, asks questions and gets other people involved, but is decisive enough to decide how he wants things done. He’s calm, very patient, but has an amazing energy and enthusiasm for football. He never had a day off. Every day he’d be out on the field, even during the international break when there were no players around.”\n\nSome of the players’ off-field antics did lead to concerns within the hierarchy that too much leeway was being granted to the group – that may have played a part in undermining him over his second year in charge – but the likes of Terry and Ashley Cole felt able to confide in him over the problems they were experiencing in their personal lives.\n\nThe manager leaned heavily on the sports psychologist Bruno Demichelis, the only member of staff to accompany him from Milan, when it came to cultivating those relationships. But there was a pragmatism to everything he instigated at Stamford Bridge over that first year.\n\nHis initial intention had been to reprise the 4-4-2 diamond he had deployed at Milan, preferably with the addition of Andrea Pirlo to the ranks. Ancelotti had witnessed City’s heavy summer spending and might have been aggrieved that Chelsea’s highest-profile arrival was Yuri Zhirkov — who proved to be an under-used left-back — but he was used to managing up after his time working with Berlusconi in Milan. Rather than kicking up a fuss, as others might, he sought solutions from the personnel he had inherited.\n\nWhat quickly became evident was his favoured formation did not play to the Chelsea players’ strengths. Lampard, in particular, laboured timing his forward runs from the tip of the diamond. So the manager tweaked the approach to something more akin to a 4-3-3, all free-flowing movement in the centre and width provided from the front three. “You can achieve creativity not only with creative players, but with creative organisation,” he explained at the time. “You can change the idea of the team with the same players.”\n\nChelsea duly ran riot. “People said he was a defensive coach at Milan,” said midfielder Michael Essien. “But maybe he had a different kind of player at Chelsea than in Italy.”\n\n“It played to their strengths: pace and power going forward, aggression and solidity at the back,” says Clement. “We were unstoppable at times. Opponents didn’t know what had hit them. We scored 103 goals in the Premier League (there were 142 in all competitions) and had an incredible attacking side, a team with a lot of maturity in every position.”\n\nThose whose form had floundered under the previous permanent manager — Salomon Kalou, Florent Malouda, Deco and, most obviously, Drogba — flourished with his support. The Ivorian was prolific, rattling in 37 goals. “Ancelotti is the best coach in the world,” said the striker. “He arrived at a new place with players he didn’t know and a staff that wasn’t his own. Despite all this, he settled in quickly. He is a winner. I love the way he manages the team, the calmness he can convey to us.\n\n“We work a lot under him, but with a smile on our faces as he can be funny too, both in training and in the dressing room.”\n\nThe right balance had been struck. It helped that United were not quite as dominant following the departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, while Liverpool were engulfed in political turmoil all year. But Chelsea, the odd hiccup aside, recovered as others lost ground. Needing a win on the final day to pip United to the title, they lanced any tension by walloping Wigan Athletic 8-0.\n\nThey followed that up with FA Cup victory over Portsmouth a week later. No one had a bad word to say about the man overseeing it all.\n\nDominic Fifield\n\nParis Saint-Germain 2012-13: The father and the friend\n\nWhen Ancelotti arrived at Paris Saint-Germain in winter 2011, replacing the legendary Antoine Kombouare, he encountered a club with vast ambitions but seemingly little idea of how to achieve them.\n\nDespite being top of Ligue 1 and flush with new money, the capital club still lagged behind most of their competitors.\n\nIn that sense, one of the Italian’s first decisions, the hiring of Clement, ultimately proved to be among his most important. Together, they and respected performance coach Nick Broad quickly set about enacting the cultural and structural change needed to turn PSG into a powerhouse.\n\nThey went from having no in-house catering of note for players to a situation where the squad were fed on site and a chef travelled with them to away games. “We changed the structure of training and put in a kitchen because French players arrive half an hour before training and leave half an hour after,” Ancelotti told Movistar+.\n\nThe new canteen had a dual purpose. Not only did it allow backroom staff to control the players’ eating habits, but it also brought an expensively assembled set of individuals together off the field.\n\nOther notable changes were made after consultation with players who had been at other top clubs. One such figure was Alex, the Brazilian defender who had been persuaded by his former Chelsea manager to swap Stamford Bridge for the Parc des Princes.\n\n“I arrived with Maxwell and (Thiago) Motta,” he tells The Athletic. “At that moment, there was a big difference between Chelsea and PSG. We only had two training pitches and they were terrible. In January, the pitch was so difficult. But we talked with Carlo and the club, and we could see they wanted to change everything.\n\n“They always came to ask me about Chelsea, Maxwell about Inter Milan, and we gave them some information to help them change.”\n\nThe quality of training pitches improved. Ancelotti and Clement monitored sessions using GPS tracking, like they had done at Chelsea, and did video work before and after every game. Some of this may seem simple now, but it was all new to PSG at the time.\n\nAncelotti did not win the league in his first season, losing out to Montpellier by three points, but the framework was in place. A year later they became French champions for the first time in 19 years, finishing 12 points ahead of rivals Marseille.\n\nRemarkably, given what was to come, there were moments when it looked like it would all come crashing down for Ancelotti.\n\nAn influx of new players and changes behind the scenes initially caused teething problems. After a challenging winter, PSG were fourth and staff were left fearing for their jobs.\n\n“It really hit boiling point,” Clement said. “We thought we weren’t going to get through it. We’d packed up our desks after losing to Nice in December and thought that was it, ‘We’re sacked’.”\n\nPSG’s quality would, however, eventually tell. The ship was steadied thanks to eight wins in nine games around the turn of the year. Summer signings such as Thiago Motta, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Thiago Silva and Zlatan Ibrahimovic started to click. Further reinforcements arrived in January in the form of Lucas Moura and David Beckham, further raising levels.\n\nMaking a group of star players into a cohesive team is not always easy, but it has been Ancelotti’s undoubted forte throughout his managerial career.\n\n“Carlo was a father for everyone,” adds Alex. “He is the first coach I saw whose decisions were totally respected by everyone. All the players loved him.\n\n“He comes to talk all the time, not just about football things. If you needed something, he would go to talk to (sporting director) Leonardo to help. He invites you to dinner or lunch with him, and this is why all players respect him.\n\n“One time some players like Lavezzi called him about 2 o’clock in the morning to come to the restaurant and he went. He is a friend.”\n\nEveryone played a role in PSG’s success under Ancelotti. Blaise Matuidi broke through at the top level, making 52 appearances and adding industry and nous in midfield. Winger Jeremy Menez weighed in with eight goals, including the strike against Lyon that clinched the title.\n\nBut few in France — or indeed anywhere else — could hold a candle to Ibrahimovic that year. He was at the peak of his powers, scoring four against England and netting 30 times for PSG in Ligue 1.\n\n“I do recall a session with Zlatan, the most unbelievable I’ve ever seen someone train,” Clement recalled. “It was a couple of days after he’d come back from scoring four against England. He was on the crest of a wave.\n\n“I’ve never seen a player train like that. The quality, the intensity, the drive. He scored an overhead kick not dissimilar to the England one, but in a small-sided game into a 2m x 1m goal. Everyone just stood there with mouths wide open.\n\n“He’s an incredible athlete. (Didier) Drogba was immense, physically, but Zlatan’s at another level.”\n\nThe 2012-13 title should have been the start of a glorious era for PSG under Ancelotti, but it proved to be just a fleeting moment in time.\n\nThe Italian has since claimed he was told he would lose his job if they failed to beat Porto that December, something he saw as a fundamental breach of trust. He was persuaded to stay a while longer by the squad, but despite the ensuing success on the pitch, confidence was never fully restored and he quit at the end of the season.\n\nDespite his short reign, however, Ancelotti provided the building blocks for PSG to become the domestically dominant, European giant they are today.\n\nPatrick Boyland\n\nBayern Munich 2016-17: ‘Pragmatist not dogmatist’ after following Guardiola\n\nAt his very first press conference as Bayern Munich coach in July 2016, Carlo Ancelotti was his usual reserved self. “I’m not here to start a revolution” he said.\n\nThe revolution, after all, had already happened. In the three years previously, Pep Guardiola had completed Bayern’s restoration to the higher ranks of European footballing nobility. The Catalan may not have won the Champions League in Munich, but he had still made Bayern one of the top three teams on the continent and started a new era of domestic dominance unprecedented even by their standards.\n\nAncelotti’s job was to keep the wind in the sails, and in the summer of 2016, it seemed like a match made in heaven. For the Italian, it was a chance to explore new waters in a fifth major European league and Bayern, meanwhile, could not have wished for a steadier hand on the tiller.\n\n“When you are Bayern Munich and you are looking for a successor to Pep Guardiola, there are very few coaches who even come into question,” Bayern’s former technical director Michael Reschke tells The Athletic. He was midway through his three-year spell at the club when Bayern hired Ancelotti, and he still raves about his former colleague.\n\n“I remember going to meet him in London a few days after we signed the contract, and we spent two days together talking about the squad and the visions we had. From the very start, he was so trusting, so competent. This was a person you felt comfortable around,” says Reschke.\n\n“Ancelotti is a pragmatist rather than a dogmatist,” he adds. “Bayern is a club which is never calm, but Ancelotti is always calm, and is a great balancing factor in difficult times.”\n\nFor many observers both inside and outside the club, that was exactly what Bayern needed after three intense years under the previous boss. “After the departure of the ascetic tactician Guardiola, Bayern now once again have a bit of joie de vivre in the dugout,” wrote 11 Freunde magazine in the summer of 2016.\n\nThose who worked with him tend to agree. Reschke hails Ancelotti as “someone who knows how to enjoy life”, while in a recent column for Die Zeit newspaper, Philipp Lahm described him as “independent and laid-back”. “An hour and a half after full-time, you could often find him in an Italian restaurant eating tortellini with his family,” recalled the former Bayern captain.\n\nAncelotti’s side eventually won the title by a 15-point margin in the 2016-17 season, losing only two games and scoring 89 goals in the process.\n\nYet six years on, the view of Ancelotti’s short spell in the Bundesliga is still tainted by how quickly things went downhill in his second season.\n\nIn hindsight, there were already hints of what was to come in his first, title-winning year in charge. In the first half of 2016-17, Bayern trailed promoted side RB Leipzig in the title race. In the second half, they suffered a bitter defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals, their earliest exit from the competition in six years.\n\nBy the time Ancelotti was sacked in September 2017, Bayern bosses felt they had no choice. The dressing room had turned on him, with several players allegedly going behind his back to complain to the directors. A humiliating 3-0 loss to PSG was the final straw, with players like Arjen Robben refusing to back the coach in post-match interviews.\n\nSo what went wrong? As Ancelotti’s long-term assistant Giorgio Ciaschini would later point out, the language may have been one problem. Though his German was arguably no worse than Guardiola’s, he often appeared less inclined to use it than his predecessor. At Bayern, a global club that still has a healthy streak of parochialism, that always invites criticism.\n\nReschke, though, thinks otherwise. “Communication wasn’t the issue, because Carlo has an aura which makes up for any language problems,” he says, insisting that the players “quickly developed a closeness to him”.\n\nBut it was those same players who eventually toppled Ancelotti. But why?\n\nPerhaps his skills were less suited to Bayern than they would be to a club like Real Madrid, Chelsea or PSG.\n\n“Ancelotti’s great skill is to get the soloists playing like an orchestra,” says Reschke. But at Bayern, the orchestra was already in tune after three years of Guardiola. In some cases, the pragmatism seemed to frustrate players who were used to being part of a more complex machine.\n\n“We need to play more systematically,” complained Robert Lewandowski after Bayern lost 1-0 to Borussia Dortmund in November 2016, their first defeat under Ancelotti. The Italian was also heavily criticised for failing to get the best out of Thomas Muller, a player who struggled to find his role in the 4-3-3 system.\n\nReschke argues that there was also a more fundamental problem for Ancelotti at Bayern, with players like Lahm, Robben and Franck Ribery by then in the twilight of their careers. “It was a difficult time at Bayern because there was a changing of the guard. The older players were approaching the end, but the younger players coming up weren’t quite ready yet.”\n\nThat problem would continue to provide headaches for Jupp Heynckes and Niko Kovac in the years after Ancelotti’s departure. Arguably, it was only under Hansi Flick that Bayern completed the transition from one treble-winning generation to the next.\n\nAncelotti’s tenure fell at perhaps the most difficult juncture in that transition, and as such, there is still a feeling that his time in the Bundesliga fell short of expectations. Nonetheless, you would be hard-pressed to find anyone in Germany who doesn’t speak highly of him.\n\n“He is a man with an extraordinary level of intelligence and charm,” says Reschke, who left Bayern a few months before Ancelotti. Former CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, meanwhile, would later admit that he almost cried when he told the Italian he was fired.\n\n“Carlo is a great person,” he told Gazzetta dello Sport in 2019. “He is still a very good friend of mine.”\n\nKit Holden\n\nReal Madrid 2021-22: ‘Closing the circle’\n\nAncelotti’s first spell as Real Madrid coach, from 2013-15, is mostly remembered for delivering the club’s long-awaited ‘Decima’ — their 10th European Cup/Champions League trophy. Two consecutive failures to win La Liga also left a legacy around the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nMadrid’s 2013-14 La Liga began with a 1-0 at home defeat to Atletico in game seven, then a 2-1 loss at Barcelona three matches later. It was not a vintage title race, with Gerardo ‘Tata’ Martino struggling as Barcelona coach and blaugrana talisman Lionel Messi hampered by injury. Even after Madrid hit form and got close to the top, they then took two points from three games against Valencia, Real Valladolid and Celta Vigo to allow Atletico Madrid to hang on for an unlikely title.\n\nWhether fair or not, the feeling was that Ancelotti had blown it. Had Madrid not beaten their neighbours to win the Decima the following week in Lisbon, his first season in Spain could well have been his last. The perception was an inability to keep his team’s physical and mental intensity level up week after week to provide the consistency needed to win league titles.\n\nMadrid began the following season superbly, winning all 22 games they played in every competition from late September until the end of the year. By the winter break, they had a four-point La Liga lead over second-placed Barca.\n\nThe momentum did not last much longer, and a 0-4 La Liga defeat at Atletico in February was difficult to recover from, especially with injuries to key players Luka Modric, Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez. March’s 2-1 loss at the Nou Camp meant Luis Enrique’s Barca had a four-point lead, as the trident of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar caught fire.\n\nIt did not matter that Ancelotti’s Madrid won nine and drew one of their last 10 La Liga games — they had already blown it. By the Champions League semi-final exit to Juventus, everyone knew Florentino Perez would fire him.\n\nAncelotti made it clear he wanted to stay, and he had the support of senior players including Ronaldo. But that perceived closeness to the dressing room’s biggest personalities actually counted against him with the club hierarchy. Exactly 12 months after the ‘Decima’ win in Lisbon, Perez announced “the difficult decision” to look for “a new impetus to win new trophies and reach our maximum competitive level”.\n\nAncelotti had all this very clear in his head when he accepted last summer’s call from Perez to leave Everton and return to the Spanish capital. There was a real feeling of unfinished business around the Bernabeu and an opportunity to fulfil one of the few things Ancelotti had left to achieve in football.\n\n“Carlo is hugely, hugely excited about winning the Spanish title,” a source who knows the Italian well told The Athletic as the season began. “He always remembered from his first spell as coach that it got away from him. He feels that he needs to win La Liga.”\n\nMultiple sources also told The Athletic early in the campaign that Ancelotti had a big focus on La Liga. With the current Madrid squad not at the level of his first spell as coach, winning the Champions League was seen as unlikely by most at the club. But the domestic title, especially with defending champions Atletico Madrid not getting going and Barcelona in turmoil after Messi’s exit, was eminently winnable. Even obligatory.\n\nIt took a while for this new team to get going. A loss to Espanyol in October led to a tactical tweak to sit deeper and play more counter-attacking football. The 2-1 Clasico win over Barcelona later that month began a run of 11 games unbeaten, which included nine wins including victories against other potential rivals Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Real Sociedad. By the winter break, Madrid impressively built an eight-point gap at the top.\n\nThen came a real sense of history repeating itself. Madrid began 2022 with a 1-0 defeat at relegation battling Getafe, then drew two of their next four La Liga games. Although they won the Spanish Supercopa in Saudi Arabia, they crashed limply out of the Copa del Rey at Athletic Bilbao, before the 0-1 Champions League last-16 first-leg defeat at PSG brought more deja-vu.\n\nDoubts were being raised again about Ancelotti’s ability to prepare a squad for the mental and physical demands of a complete season. The Italian himself bristled when the idea was raised by reporters he knew were close to the Bernabeu hierarchy. He kept his team focused even during hugely emotional Champions League ties against PSG, Chelsea and Manchester City, using the confidence and energy generated by these rollercoasters to fuel their La Liga campaign.\n\nApart from the anomaly of the 4-0 Clasico defeat to Xavi’s resurgent Barcelona aside, Madrid won every La Liga game since early February. That run culminated in Saturday’s 4-0 stroll past Espanyol at the Bernabeu to wrap up the title with four games remaining.\n\nNobody can argue they do not deserve it. Their only challengers for most of the season were Sevilla, but Julen Lopetgui’s methodical and solid side were twice beaten by late goals. Barca and Atletico were put firmly in their place and were far behind by Christmas. Madrid also won away at Real Betis, Valencia, Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao.\n\nThe watchword from day one has been “intensity” — Ancelotti needed his team to match the work rate and physicality of opponents, and then their individual quality would show out. They did not score as many goals as his previous Madrid team, or play as excitingly, but they were better at just getting the job done.\n\nWinning La Liga at Madrid is never a given — the nature of the club, and its focus on Europe, means they have won just three of the last ten Spanish titles. Ancelotti has now shown he can motivate and organise a team through a 38-game season, driving the physical and emotional consistency required.\n\n“I’m very emotional,” Ancelotti said during Saturday’s celebrations. “The season has been spectacular — very consistent. I have to thank the players for their work and their attitude. Now we have to celebrate — I’m full of pride to win the five big leagues. I can say I like what I do, and this means I do it pretty well.”\n\nDermot Corrigan\n\n(Photos: Getty Images; graphics: Sam Richardson)"
