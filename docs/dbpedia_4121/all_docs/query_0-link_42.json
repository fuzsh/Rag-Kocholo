        "text": "Milan have appointed Carlo Ancelotti as Terim's replacement.\n\nAncelotti has been given a contract that runs until June 2004.\n\nSome media reports suggested that Milan's senior players such as Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Costacurta and Demetrio Albertini could have been behind the decision.\n\nBut Maldini, who is currently out of action with injury, dismissed the idea.\n\n\"The club has clearly decided to make the change at a time when our position in the league table is in no way compromised,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew of the change after it had happened and I want to repeat that I have always had an excellent rapport with Terim.\"\n\nMilan are fifth in the Serie A standings with 15 points, five points behind the leaders Chievo.\n\nTerim had received a vote of confidence from Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani following a 1-1 draw with bottom-placed Venezia in mid-October.\n\nTerim led Turkey to the European Championships for the first time in 1996.\n\nHe then coached Galatasaray to four Turkish championships and the UEFA Cup in 2000.\n\nHe managed Fiorentina last season but resigned towards the end of the campaign after problems with the board, having coached the club for only 20 games.\n\nFourth coach\n\nAncelotti, 42, was sacked by Juventus at the end of last season after twice guiding them to the runners-up position in Serie A.\n\nA former Milan and Italy midfielder, Ancelotti helped the club win the European Cup in 1989 and 1990.\n\nHe had also been linked with a return to Parma, who he coached from 1996-98, following the resignation of Renzo Ulivieri last week.\n\nAncelotti is Milan's fourth coach in less than a year.\n\nAlberto Zaccheroni and Cesare Maldini also coached the club last year."
