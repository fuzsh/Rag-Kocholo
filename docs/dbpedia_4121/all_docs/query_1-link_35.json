        "text": "Antonio Conte’s struggles continue at Premier League outfit Chelsea. For now he remains as Chelsea’s head coach even after his most recent demoralizing defeat to Watford.\n\nEven through the tough results, Chelsea has put off a decision to change coaches until the end of the season. They have chosen to keep their trust in the former Juventus and Italian national team manager until June, where he could leave the Chelsea bench.\n\nHis future could be back in Italy after Chelsea and according to a report in the Gazzetta Dello Sport, he has a few options on his table. Talks about returning to the Italian national team have reopened. Right now, Roberto Mancini seems to be the favorite for the position but there is also potential interest from both Milanese clubs, AC Milan and Inter. If either were to offer a higher salary than the national team and the team presents a good project his decision can certainly be altered."
