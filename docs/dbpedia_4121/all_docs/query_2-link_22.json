        "text": "The question is often asked regarding how AC Milan’s hierarchy actually works in practice, and more specifically what powers each member of the management has.\n\nThis applies above all to the CEO Giorgio Furlani, considering that there have been some media reports suggesting that he has the final say on the targets technical director Geoffrey Moncada picks out, while others believe Gerry Cardinale has the signing-off powers.\n\nAccording to Felice Raimondo, the Chamber of Commerce records show Furlani can now move freely for each single-signature operation (i.e. independently) up to €30m gross, which is even greater freedom than his predecessor Ivan Gazidis.\n\nThese operations include agreements with sports agents and player salaries for their entire duration. That means, putting some figures in, that Furlani can sign-off the renewal of a player worth €3m net per season without Growth Decree (approximately €6m gross) for a five-year contract (6×5=30) in complete autonomy.\n\nFor operations between €30m and €100m gross, however, the joint signature of Furlani and the owner Cardinale is required plus the positive opinion of the Technical Committee, which also includes Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Moncada.\n\nFor example, Morata – who according to the media signed a contract worth €4.5m net, cost approximately €9m gross for four years which equals a potential salary commitment of €36m.\n\nThus, signing arrival can be considered a collective responsibility given that it was finalised with a double signature plus the positive opinion of the Technical Committee.\n\nIn terms of what the actual budget is, the management all move within the margins set each year by the Board of Directors (what is improperly called budget), and the figures are rightly unknown to the public."
