        "text": "GENNARO GATTUSO has spoken about many things relating his career and his experiences with the Rossoneri shirt.\n\nA lot has happened at Milan since Gattuso left the club in 2012. Rino has seen everything and won everything in football – from the Champions League to the World Cup to the Coppa Italia and the Serie A title and he’s considered a Milan legend.\n\nGattuso has been through a lot and he has a lot of memories from his time with the prestigious red and black jersey and Gennaro sat down with the Milan Channel to talk about some of his many experiences at Milan from 1999 to 2012.\n\nHighlights: Milan Glorie 2-0 Benfica Legends\n\nGalli rejects assistant coach role, Tassotti to stay at Milan\n\n“Memory of my father in-law Mario Romano (father of Gattuso’s wife Monica Romano, died in 2011)? He made me grow up a lot. We were friends and he was very influential in my career. I met him when I was 18 and he helped me a lot,” Gattuso, the 36-year-old who retired from football in 2012, told Milan’s official TV station l last evening on the show Terza Pagina.\n\n“They have a mindset of their own. There were rules in the stadiums that we’re lacking today. The first steps at Glasgow Rangers? I had fun because I am Catholic and I teased them because they have the queen (laughs). I’ve always respected them, though.” Gattuso played for Rangers from 1997-1999, making 49 appearances in the process and scoring five goals. Rino arrived to Milan in 1999 from Salernitana for €8 million (Salernitana purchased him from the Scottish side for €5m.\n\n“I come from a family of Milan fans I remember that when we won the final against Steaua in 1989, I cried and my father took me to the streets to celebrate,” Gattuso continued. “When we won the Champions League in Manchester my father told me for the first time in my life that he was proud of me, I cried. Coming to Milan? I had already been sold to Roma but my father told me I had to go to Milan for less money. I realized my dream of dressing the Rossoneri shirt. My first year here at Milan? We came third and some of the fans doubted me because I didn’t have certain class and not a good presence.\n\n“Braida was good to me; I had to go to Fiorentina in the winter and instead he kept me. It was a special year. We played with a 3-man defense and it wasn’t da Milan. Now many clubs play like this but back in the day t was rare and Galliani didn’t like it. George Weah’s departure in 2000? I was very much sorry. He’s always been an idol for me and it was a big deal. When he greeted us it was a touching moment. He wasn’t the only one to have problems with Zaccheroni , Boban had them too.\n\n“The Milan dressing room back then? I’ll tell you one thing: Albertini and Billy Costacurta were very picky and they controlled everything. There were great professionals there and I noticed immediately that Milan is not a place where you can joke around. I watched and I listened to the biggest and I followed their paths. I then did the same with those who came to Milan, teaching them how this shirt should always be sweaty and loved forever. The sacking of Alberto Zaccheroni? I wasn’t used to such dispensations. Zaccheroni and I had spent a lot of time together and he wanted to see me improve a lot.\n\n” I was disappointed but then I had Tassotti who got me to improve even further. His workouts alone with me were the secret of my growth. My help in the negotiations to bring Inzaghi? Pippo used to steal my boots when we were on national team duty and one day he scored with my boots on, so he never gave them back. That was the beginning of a great friendship. We used to call each other a lot and he said he wanted to come here, so I told Galliani and he was delighted to buy him.\n\n“The time with Fatih Terim? Terim is very polite but here it’s different than at Fiorentina. He was very unfortunate because there were many injuries and we were penalized. The change of the coach was a defeat of the team but it was a nice change because Carlo Ancelotti came. The birth of Andrea Pirlo? Pirlo finally exploded and it was also the end of Albertini (Demetrio left Milan in 2002).\n\n“Ancelotti put him in front of the defense. It was a big improvement for me, because I passed the ball to him and just put the ball in the bank. Carletto built the team around him. The arrival of Rivaldo? he said that he wasn’t used to keeping such a high pace and I told him not to run and that I would do the running for him (laughs). Nesta’s arrival? We kept calling Sandro, Pirlo and I and the others. Every day we phoned him because he was going to Juve. We were important in bringing him.\n\n“Filippo Inzaghi the striker? Inzaghi used to get CDs of the opponents and study them for days on end. He knew everything about them. He was obsessed. Everybody thought that Pippo was just lucky, but it was all down to skill and preparation. He used to get so angry with the wingers if they didn’t send in the right crosses and he would study things meticulously. The arrival of Kaka? In the first game he introduced himself with a sombrero and there began his splendid career at Milan. Sheva? He looked like a robot. He was a sniper.\n\n“The 2002/2003 Champions League campaign? In the match against Lens in the group stage something was born. You breathe different air, a great atmosphere, a full stadium. That was the start,” Rino added. The victory over Bayern Munich gave us belief that we can do something important. The Champions League final against Juventus? I’ve always lived as a Milanista and it was my dream to win the Champions League with the Rossoneri and it was something that is unimaginable.\n\n“At Manchester I reached the goal of my life. The time after winning the Champions League? We had a fully belly and we experienced a horrible summer, losing all the friendlies and Ancelotti was very angry. The 2003 UEFA Super Cup final against Porto? Porto was a great team, coached by Mourinho. They were well crafted and difficult to deal with. Manuel Rui Costa crossed the ball and Shevchenko scored an important goal. The match against Deportivo La Coruna? I have no doubt that had we won that game we would have won the Champions League that year (Milan lost 5-4 on aggregate).\n\n“I still remember that night because my wife just had a car accident. I wasn’t mentally in the game. The defeat against Liverpool in the 2005 final? We played well in that game and I can’t do anything about those six minutes. It’s really inexplicable but we were dominating without suffering. We were stronger than them in 2005 but they were stronger in 2007.\n\n“Bayern Munich 0-2 Milan in the 2006-2007 Champions League campaign? We played to win, also for our coach. Everyone gave us up for dead after the first leg (Milan drew the game 2-2) and Ariedo Braida also caused some controversy. I was angry with him because after winning the away leg he came to celebrate with us. But then we clarified everything.\n\n“Being in agreement with Ancelotti was the real force of the team. My relationship with Fabio Capello: We are two strong characters and we both don’t know how to lose but we’re friends. We keep in touch often. The possible relegation to Serie B in 2006 due to the Calciopoli? Galliani called me and said we’re going to Serie B but I would have remained with Milan if it happened because I knew it was an unjust thing (Juventus were of course relegated to the second division because of it).\n\n“My first possible Milan farewell? When i began to see a wrong attitude and after a blow like the one in Istanbul I was going to leave. I didn’t like certain situations and certain things were missing and I wasn’t training happily. A possible transfer to Bayern Munich? I had reached a verbal agreement with Bayern and I remember that I went to Milan’s offices as 12:00 and left at 21:00. I was in the trophy room with my father and with (Vice President and Chief Executive Adriano) Galliani.\n\n“I made a fool of myself in the eyes of the Germans because I had given them my word but I stayed at Milan. My knee injury? Leonardo was right to keep me out because I wasn’t myself and i could barely trudge on the field. Losing the title in 2012? In London against Arsenal, like Zambrotta said, something broke (Milan lost 3-0 and Ibra nearly fought Allegri).\n\n“And of course the goal of Muntari made the different. Had that ball entered we would’ve gone 8 points clear off Juventus and not 5,” added Gattuso, who now has a career as a coach. He worked as boss at FC Sion and at Palermo in Serie B."
