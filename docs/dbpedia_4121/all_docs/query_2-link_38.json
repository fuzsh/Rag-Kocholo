        "text": "AC Milan capped off their American Tour with a penalty shoot out victory over FC Barcelona in Baltimore after a 2-2 draw. Paulo Fonseca has impressed in his four friendlies in charge as he has beaten Manchester City, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona making the most of the young players and depth players at his disposal.\n\nLuka Jovic opened the scoring with a tap in at the backpost connecting with a square ball from Christian Pulisic. Rafael Leao set up Pulisic for the second with a through ball cutting open the Barcelona defence with a shot across goal.\n\nBarcelona equalised as Robert Lewandowski capitalised on Alexis Saelemaekers error for his first and has a half volley tap in for his second.\n\nLorenzo Torriani, the 19 year old Primavera goalkeeper, stole the show in the penalty shoot outs as he saved three spot kicks on top of a great display during the game. Milan won 4-3 in the shoot out with Calabria, Okafor, Adli and Zeroli converting.\n\nPulisic put on a show for the home fans with a goal and an assist to end to the American pre-season tour ahead of the Trofeo Berlusconi next week and the Serie A opener on the 17th of August."
