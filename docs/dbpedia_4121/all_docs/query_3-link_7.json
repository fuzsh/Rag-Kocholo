As a result of this meeting, it was decided that our professional relationship would not continue,\" he added.\n\nSeventy-year-old Terim has previously managed Turkish and European giants like Galatasaray, Fiorentina, and AC Milan.\n\nUnder Terim, Galatasaray won Europe's second-tier trophy, the UEFA Cup, in 2000 after beating English club Arsenal on penalties.\n\nHe is considered one of the most respected coaches in Turkish football history, winning eight Super Lig titles with the Lions."
