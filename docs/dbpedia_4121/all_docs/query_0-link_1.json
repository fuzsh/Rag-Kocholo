        "text": "MILAN captain Paolo Maldini has admitted that the players must share the blame for Fatih Terim's sacking as manager. The Turkish coach was sacked by The Rossonerri on Monday after last Sunday's shock defeat to Torino and he has been replaced by former Milan star Carlo Ancelotti.\n\n\"Terim's failure was also our failure,\" said Maldini. \"Now the team must look at themselves as there are no more excuses. Maybe it was the players' fault because we couldn't put Terim's teachings into action.\"\n\nIt has been reported that a number of Milan players had pushed for Terim to be removed at Giuseppe Meazza, but Maldini insists he had a good relationship with the former Fiorentina boss.\n\n\"I only knew of the change of management when everything had already been said and done,\" protested Maldini, \"and in any case I had an excellent rapport with the coach.\"\n\n\"I think that Terim always had to put up with the pressure of the press from the start,\" said Maldini. \"On the first day of our summer get-together, the first question put to him concerned rumours of Milan's interest in Ancelotti.\"\n\n\"In today's game there is less and less time to get things right,\" \"As the investments rise the club has less patience in awaiting results.\"\n\nThe Italian international is confident that his former Milan team-mate Ancelotti will help bring success to the club.\n\n\"We had fine relations with Ancelotti as good team-mates and I think nothing will hinder us to have friendly relations again,\" said Maldini. \"When we were playing together in Milan, he was behaving like a coach on the field. Ancelotti led and guided us.\n\n\"I think every thing now will be the same as in former times,\" added Maldini.\n\nMeanwhile, Terim was upset at how Milan handled the affair and claimed he had been disrespected by the Italian giants.\n\n\"The board's attitude towards me was inadequate and quite wrong though I must say I was not surprised with this dismissal,\" said Terim.\n\n\"I felt this was going to happen when the Italian championship had just started. But I am offended by the fact that they decided to sack me when I was in Istanbul without even looking into my eyes.\n\n\"The people who have self-respect never act that way. I myself always treat people with respect and expect from them the same.\"\n\nThe former Galatasaray coach also dismissed reports that he could be in line to take over as Turkey coach again.\n\n\"At present there is nothing of that kind. Just two days ago I was training Milan and I couldn't let myself be occupied with other clubs.\"\n\n&nbsp;"
