        "text": "So let me clarify the situation a little bit. Gala at home was a great danger when they used to play in the HELL called Ali Sami Yen and even 20'000 people would scare the shit out of Figo, Raul, Maldini and the likes. They moved to the Ali Sami Yen Türk Telekom Arena a couple of years ago, broke the record in terms of the loudest stadium in the world (check guiness book), however, they still struggle to make it their home and unbreakable castle. The pitch is awful because of mismanagement. They renewed the pitch in the winter break, however some mistakes have been made and now it looks like a potato field, unfortunately. So the home games are kind of a struggle for Galatasaray.\n\nInterestingly they perform very well in away games. Lost 1-0 to Manu, very close. Won against Braga, Cluj and Schalke away. I think we're always good for a surprise. The good thing is that we don't have anything to loose, that makes us more dangerous (even if it sounds like a basic shitty comment) than people can think of.\n\nFatih Terim is a great motivator and a great coach, his lads believe in him and he can even make Drogba, Sneijder etc. press and run till they die So let's see... I don't think that we can beat Madrid out of the Tournament, but I hope for a good game at least where there is some drama\n\nHonestly Barca & Malaga would have been ... due to our recent history with you in the last 8 games including 4 games of two leg ties & knowledge of Malaga\n\nbut i can't complain but i do fear teams like Galatasary if we don't finish them cleanly at home ..it will be tough in Turkey , very tough\n\nTo be fair gal, psg and Malaga were the 3 weakest opponents. Saying Barca is ridiculous. Fair enough you have done well against us recently but it doesn't change the fact that it would be tougher than gala/psg.\n\nlol City were so bad the both legs you just werent up to the challenge. And lets not talk about Ajax ffs... they are your punching bag for the last few years, they always bend over.\n\nCity was bad because the group was a group of death with all 4 are champions.. and Ajax improved a lot and look no further than their games with Borussia and City ..\n\nIf they were in a walk in a park group like your group they would have qualified... there is a reason our group was called the group of death ..\n\nSo let me clarify the situation a little bit.

Galata are a tough team and Drogba can make Ramos or any other defender of ours his bitch, especially during set pieces. Sneijder holds a grudge against Real as well so we will have something to prove too. Whether their defense is weak makes no difference if these particular players perform well. Remember Monaco in 2004? They had a run solely based on performances of their key guys and won despite conceding like hell.\n\nSeriously.. how many stupid posts does it take to realize that there is no weak teams by this stage of this year's Champions League?

(yes even Chelsea, at the start of the season when i recall they were top of the Premiership) & Nordjsaellen actually weren't half bad!\n\nI definately butchered the spelling of that team again, and not for the first time\n\nSeriously.. how many stupid posts does it take to realize that there is no weak teams by this stage of this year's Champions League?

Some people are clutching at straws, besides lucks is a part of the draws, how can you blame RM for that? Especially since they faced though opposition in United and Dortmund already...\n\nThe fact that we had to overcome Milan with such effort was our own fault, and despite losing to Celtic, our group was rather easy... Can't blame RM for that either...\n\nIf anything, for cules, it would be sweeter if RM got eliminated by a \"lesser\" team, don't you think?"
