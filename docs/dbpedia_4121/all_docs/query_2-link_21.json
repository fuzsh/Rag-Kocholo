        "text": "Legendary former Rossoneri coach Arrigo Sacchi believes that Inter Milan are still favourites over AC Milan to win the Serie A title.\n\nSacchi gave his thoughts on his former team’s chances for the title in an interview published in yesterday’s print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews. He argued that they still have a “fighting chance.”\n\nLast season, Milan finished second in the Serie A table behind their city rivals Inter.\n\nHowever, in truth there was never really a title race.\n\nThere had been a close race up until the end of January. But that had been between Inter and Juventus.\n\nWhen the Bianconeri’s form plummeted dramatically, Milan were able to move ahead of them in the table.\n\nBut by that time, Inter had already pulled well ahead of all the other teams in the table.\n\nAt the end of the season, the Nerazzurri’s lead in the table stretched to nearly twenty points.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, Inter also clinched the title in the derby against Milan. That was the first time that either the Nerazzurri or the Rossoneri had ever done so.\n\nSacchi: Inter “Still Ahead” Of AC Milan In Serie A Title Race\n\nMilan have taken steps to strengthen during the summer transfer window.\n\nFor one thing, the Rossoneri have hired a new coach, in the form of Paulo Fonseca.\n\nThe former Roma, Lille, Shakhtar Donetsk, and Porto boss replaces Stefano Pioli at the helm.\n\nMoreover, there are indications that Milan are ready to really revamp their squad.\n\nThe Rossoneri have already made a very high-profile signing in attack. EURO 2024 winner Alvaro Morata joins from Atletico Madrid as a replacement for Olivier Giroud.\n\nReportedly, Milan are also looking to make notable reinforcements in midfield.\n\nFormer Milan coach Sacchi remarked, “We ask ourselves, and the fans are right to ask: Are Milan ready to aspire to the Scudetto?”\n\n“If I’m honest, I still believe that Inter are ahead of them, at least by a bit.”\n\n“Because they just won the title,” Sacchi said of the Nerazzurri. “And because they’ve been working with the same coach and with the same group of players for three years.”\n\n“However, I’m convinced that – if the Rossoneri do things right, then they’ll have a fighting chance.”\n\n“They can achieve something extraordinary,” Sacchi said of his former side Milan."
