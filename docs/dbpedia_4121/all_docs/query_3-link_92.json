        "text": "It was a good game for both teams but without a winner. Neither Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim nor Bursaspor coach Samet Aybaba were satisfied with the one point.\n\nIn front of their own audience last Friday evening, the winning streak of 16 home games for Galatasaray ended. It was also the first loss of points at home after Fatih Terim took office last season. Several points were decisive for the draw. In the first half Coach Terim had to change three times already due to injuries, of which the injuries of Fernando Reges and Sofiane Feghouli are to be taken probably seriously. Against Bursaspor, the lions were not the yellow of the eye when it came to shots at goal. For the first time this season, Galatasaray shot only three times at the visitors' goal in their own stadium. But the Guests - Coach Samet Aybaba once again managed to score points from Galatasaray. In the last ten encounters with the record champion, the 63-year-old won twice and drew six points. He was only left out twice.\n\nFatih Terim, coach of Galatasaray: \"We didn't lose, but not winning on Friday isn't nice. Of course, I can't say anything about the injuries yet. But I can't understand the injuries of Fernando and Feghouli. For example, they were not in the national team. Unfortunately, it's always difficult after the international break. There are players who are on the road 24 hours a day. We have the problem that our players have to go to Uruguay, Japan, Nigeria and Cape Verde. Actually, our fears before the game were with Younes Belhanda and Selcuk Inan, who were only at 50%. And yet we can't complain because we're playing eleven against eleven. But at no time did it look as if we were too eleventh on the pitch. Of course, the injuries and everything around them also had a psychological disadvantage.\n\nAfter the goal we have made our game, but could have stood today also with empty hands. As for Ãmer Bayram's performance, I can only say that we expect a lot from him. But if our fans criticise him after a few mistakes, then he can't concentrate any more. The support of our fans is enormously important, but some of our young players are afraid if the pressure is too high. But we must not forget that the UEFA Champions League is a priority for us. You can still catch up in the league, but it's difficult in the champions league. I'd also like to say something general in the end. If the opponents are playing for time and you then signal to me that you will let this time replay, it doesn't help me much either. That destroys my complete rhythm in that moment. And then you give an extra time of five minutes and don't even let it replay. I want the referees to protect the team that is also trying to play football. No matter who should play. And for God's sake they should stop with the yellow cards in the last ten minutes. They should simply stop with these things!â³\n\nSamet Aybaba, coach of Bursaspor: \"After the goal we should have extended the lead. Had we done that, we would have talked about other things. My players are trying their best, but there are problems. I'm not satisfied with the draw today because we're a team from a big football city. The victory today would have been very important. I congratulate my players, but I will continue to criticise them when they give up games. As for the two personal details, I can only say that they needed some time for themselves and had it with the suspension. Our youth work and the training ground are excellent to switch off and be like a newborn. Sometimes we need to teach the players a lesson to win them over in the long run.â³\n\nFernando Muslera, goalkeeper of Galatasaray: \"Of course the injuries influenced our game, also our coach was surprised that something like this happened. Apart from that, we didn't give the guests any chance except for the penalty kick. We also had our chances, but nevertheless we scored one point. Such points can lead you to the title at the end of the season. If you still pay attention to the injuries, the point score is all right.â³"
