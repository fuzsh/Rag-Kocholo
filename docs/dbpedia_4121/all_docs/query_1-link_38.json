        "text": "Atatürk Olympic Stadium is the largest football stadium in Turkey with a capacity of 74,753. It was built as part of Turkey’s bid to host to Olympics in 2008, which in the end was hosted in China. It is not the most beautiful stadium in Istanbul and is located far from the city centre, but with its oval and open bowl shape, the stadium is quite unique. The pitch and the first row of stands are lower than the street level and you get a panoramic view from the top of the western and eastern stands.\n\nNowadays, Atatürk Olympic Stadium is the home ground of the Turkish national football team and of the Turkish football club Fatih Karagümrük. In the past, Istanbul Başakşehir used the stadium as its home before it moved to the Fatih Terim Stadium. Galatasaray and Besiktas also had short stints in the Olympic stadium when their own grounds were being refurbished.\n\nThe Champions League final of 2005. One of the greatest games in the competition’s history. The Liverpool of Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso were 3-0 behind against the star-studded AC Milan with Andriy Shevchenko and Kaká among others. The game looked all set and done, but to everyone’s surprise, Liverpool scored three goals in six minutes after half-time. Eventually, Liverpool went on to win the game in a penalty shootout.\n\nThe Atatürk Olympic Stadium is still loved by Liverpool fans. They even call it the ‘Turkish Anfield’. In June 2023, the stadium will also host the Champions League final.\n\nThe story of Fatih Karagümrük has gone a little bit under the radar. Back in 2012, the Turkish football club was still playing amateur football and not a single fan could have dreamt of what was to come. After having been promoted to the fourth tier, which is the lowest professional level in Turkey, in 2012, the club went on to play two seasons at this level before being promoted to the third tier. They continued to play in that league until 2019, and then the unimaginable happened. What followed were two successive promotions and in 2020 the club suddenly played in Turkey’s highest division. They went from amateurs to the highest division in a space of eight years. Since then, the club seems to have established itself as a midtable side and currently has the legendary Italian footballer Andrea Pirlo as their manager.\n\nEver since their promotion to the highest tier of Turkish football, the club has been playing their home games in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium because their ground does not meet the criteria of the league. The Olympic stadium is a bit too big for Fatih Karagümrük, but when they play against top sides like Fenerbahce, Galatasaray or Besiktas the stadium can become quite full of away fans.\n\nFatih Karagümrük used to play its home matches in Vefa Stadı, also known as the Karagümrük Stadyumu. It is a shame they are not allowed to play here because it is a beautiful stadium surrounded by apartment blocks which have been built on top of a cliff. From Fevzi Paşa Street you have a splendid view of the ground.\n\nVefa Stadı is located near the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in the Fatih district, one of Istanbul's most historic and popular neighbourhoods."
