        "text": "ISTANBUL\n\nPanathinaikos confirmed Fatih Terim as their new manager Tuesday after sacking Ivan Jovanovic.\n\n\"As a coach he had a great journey, and is by far the second-best coach in Turkey, having won eight championships and a UEFA Cup with Galatasaray. He also led the Turkish National Team to the semi-finals of the EURO,\" Panathinaikos said in a statement.\n\n\"We welcome Fatih Terim to the Panathinaikos family!\" the Greek club added.\n\n\"Terim, whose flight is planned to go to the capital Athens on Wednesday, will have the last meeting with the club officials,\" according to an Anadolu correspondent. \"If a definitive agreement is reached in this meeting, Terim is expected to sign a 1.5-year contract.\"\n\nBut the deal's financial and duration details were not disclosed.\n\nThe 70-year-old head coach previously led Galatasaray, Fiorentina, AC Milan, and the Turkish national football team.\n\nDuring the Terim era, Galatasaray won Europe's second-tier trophy, the UEFA Cup, in 2000 after beating English club Arsenal on penalties.\n\nHe is considered one of the most respected coaches in Turkish football history, winning eight Super Lig titles with the Lions.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Greek club parted ways with Jovanovic, who is from Serbia, after two-and-a-half years at the helm.\n\nPanathinaikos are second in the league table with 34 points in 15 weeks, one point behind PAOK."
