        "text": "Legendary former AC Milan, Real Madrid, and England coach Fabio Capello feels it will be “open season” on Inter Milan in the Serie A title race.\n\nCapello gave his thoughts ahead of the upcoming season in an interview published in yesterday’s print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews.\n\nThere is no hiding the fact that Inter will have a target on their back next season.\n\nThe Nerazzurri cannot avoid the tag of favourites to win the Serie A title after last season, in which they romped to the title in dominant fashion.\n\nInter’s campaign last time around has set a high benchmark for their rivals.\n\nBut by all indication, the other big teams in Serie A are reacting to this.\n\nJuventus look to be having a very ambitious transfer window under new coach Thiago Motta.\n\nMeanwhile, the arrivals of Paulo Fonseca and Antonio Conte on the benches of AC Milan and Napoli respectively mean that both teams should be refreshed and hungry./\n\nFabio Capello: “Officially Open Season” On Inter Milan In Serie A Title Race\n\n“It’s officially open season on Inter,” said Capello.\n\n“The teams are still under construction,” said Capello.\n\n“Some of them have changed coaches. And others don’t quite know exactly what they’ll do in the transfer market.\n\nLast season’s closest rival for Inter, AC Milan, are now working under Fonseca in preseason training. They are also linked with big name attacking signings such as Romelu Lukaku and Alvaro Morata.\n\nJuventus, meanwhile, have already signed two big-name midfielders in the form of Khephren Thuram and Douglas Luiz.\n\nInter have made two big free transfer signings. Both Mehdi Taremi and Piotr Zielinski are coming in to bolster the defending champions’ ranks.\n\n“Maybe Kim could be on the way from Bayern as well,” Capello noted.\n\n“But Inter might be the only one of the big teams to be done with their transfer business on July 9th – that’s no mean feat.”"
