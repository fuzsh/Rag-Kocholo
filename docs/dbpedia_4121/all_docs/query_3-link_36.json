        "text": "Istanbul (AFP) – Galatasaray on Monday parted ways with former Turkey and AC Milan manager Fatih Terim after a horrendous run put the Istanbul side well out of title contention.\n\nTerim gained hero status by guiding Galatasaray to a UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup double in 2000, making them the first Turkish side to win European trophies.\n\nThe 68-year-old former Galatasaray defender rejoined the club as manager for a third time in 2017 after spells coaching the national side and in Serie A with AC Milan and Fiorentina.\n\nHe led Galatasaray to two more championship titles, increasing their record haul to 23.\n\nThe club finished an agonising second last season, level on points with eternal Istanbul rivals Besiktas, but losing the title on goal difference.\n\nBut their form has been dire this season, with three losses in the last five matches leaving them stranded in 12th place and closer to the relegation zone than another title.\n\nThe team were whistled off the pitch after losing 1-0 at home to Giresunspor on Saturday, prompting Terim to lash out to fans for failing to stand by the club.\n\n“The fans may be angry, they may react, and they may be right. But that is no reason to behave like that,” Terim said after the match.\n\n“Unfortunately, we are going through a season where even on good days, we do not win.”\n\nThe TRT state broadcaster said Terim resigned after a meeting with the club president.\n\nThe club said in a statement Terim was leaving his duties affective immediately, without providing further details.\n\nTurkish media reports said Galatasaray have already started the search for Terim’s successor, with Spaniard Domenec Torrent expected in Istanbul for preliminary discussions on Tuesday.\n\nThe 59-year-old has worked as an assistant coach at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City between 2008 and 2018, also briefly managing Brazilian giants Flamengo in 2020."
