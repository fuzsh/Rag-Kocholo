        "text": "BACK IN the 08-09 season, Cagliari brought to Serie A a young and unexperienced coach. A coach that had done great things with Serie B and Serie C1 teams, but that had many more things to prove.\n\nI’m taking my time to explain the style, the origins and the path of our rossoneri coach, because many people critisice him, many support him, but few really know at what point of his career he really is and how much he can achieve. I’m not going to inform you about his experiences with Serie B and C1 teams, but rather his two seasons with Cagliari (I know you’re not that interested in Cagliari but let me work my way to the present and the impact he might have at San Siro).\n\nIn the 2008 season, Mr Allegri managed to make a bottom half table team, earn a very repectable 9th place with 53 points. Many might say it’s no big deal, but Cagliari is not a team that is kown for his wealth and it was not a team that spilled talent when Allegri arrived, but he managed to exploit every player’s best attributes to build a decent team. That season with limited resources, Allegri and his team played a very offensive football, figuring worst case scenario they would finish in the bottom half as usual and best case scenario they would qualify for an european competition. With his offenssive tactics and formation that displayed the diamond formation in the midfield, he ripped of a victory from the likes of Inter, Juve, Napoli and Fiorentina, and he got draws against Inter, Milan, Napoli and Roma as well. Huge accomplishment for a coach lacking experience and specially in his first year in Serie A.\n\nPalermo 1 – 0 Milan\n\nReport: Milan reach agreement with Dede\n\nLet’ fast forward time to june 2010. Almost two years after his first taste of Seria A and a couple Albo Panchina d’Oro later, Allegri becomes AC Milan’s head coach after being fired from Cagliari in April, not because his team had bad performances, but because he spoke with other teams for the coching job. The first half of the season was a little bumpy, but I think it’s due to three reasons : firt of all, Allegri is not that good with starts, if you see how he began his two seasons with Cagiari you would ask yourself how he got to Milan. The second reason is that the job seemed to be bigger than him at that time. He had to deal with bigger egos, better players and higher expectations from the fans and specially from Berlusconi than what he was used to. The final reason is that with so much talent in the squad, it took him a few games to find the optimal formation that suited that talent the best. It’s quite different to manage a squad that lacks talent to one that pours it, specially because a talented player won’t be happy just watchng the game from the bench.\n\nNow, it’s obvious that Max has made many mistakes since the begining of the season : late subs, questionable starting 11 at times, playing the wrong players at the wrong moment and I’m sure many of you can add quite a few to the list. However, the progress he has made from the beginning of the season until now it’s quite impressive. At the european stage we got knocked out by one defensive mistake, just one. Not that bad in mi opinion if you keep in mind that it was his first european challenge. We are still in the Coppa Italia against a team that will surely cause no obstacle with us reaching the final, and we are favourites to win the Serie A for the first time since 2004. Far better than Carletto’s last year and Leo’s season.\n\nAllegri is at a stage of his career where he still can learn a lot. Think of his time at Cagliari as an intership. Him, along Leo, and Guardiola to name a few, belong to a group of young managers that will be the best in a few years. Sure, Guardiola already won trophies with Barcelona, but you also must keep in mind that he doesn’t only know Barcelona’s system and style of play, but he played it to. It also worries me a little that Milan might start changing coach year in, year out. I think that it’s best to keep a coach for a few years to create an atmosphere of stability, unlike Real Madrid’s locker room for example. It’s crucial for our youngsters to develop in a unique style of play, otherwise they will never adapt to a postition or a role, but rather they will be mediocre because they never got to adapt to one style. Take Pato for example, in the past few years he played in three different styles. In every style he’s had his lows and highs, but how do you expect him to adapt to be a center forward, winger or a second striker if he alternates every season, and even if the formation doesn’t change, he’s asked to play different with every coach. I guess what I’m trying to say is that we need to be more patient and keep Allegri for one or two more seasons even if he doesn’t do great, you know, give him a chance so he can catch up with the demands he’s imposed to and let our young players grow in a specific role and make sure they understand it.\n\nNow, it’s not only praises and high regards I have for Max, I do have a few things to point out. The most important would be that I don’t know if he lacks the imagination or the guts to display a different tactical formation other than the usual 4-3-1-2. I would love to see a more offensive formation, or tactical variety, specially in matches against little teams where the best option is to push forward. Eventually they’ll make a mistake and allows us to score. I don’t know if he is affraid to change the formation, but he has the tools and the talent at his disposal to build different effective formations.\n\nThe other issue I have with Allegri, is the misuse of some players. For example, instead of using Antonini in left back he could use Emanuelson providing a more dynamic, more technical defense and specially, less akward. He used to play in left back at Ajax when needed. Cassano should also have more playing time. I don’t mind if he’s not a starter but him playing for 30minutes instead of 15-20 provides us more creativity in the last third of the game when the opposition begins to show signs of fatigue.\n\nAt the end of the day, weather you think he’s good or bad, weather you like him or not doesn’t really matter, because for every person who wants him to stay, I’m sure there is another who wants him to leave, but the fact is that Allegri might become an excellent coach and we can see him grow with us, or against us, and I wouldn’t like that. Take Leo as an example."
