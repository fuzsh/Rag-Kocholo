        "text": "Manchester United and Arsenal, the only two remaining English sides, will be looking to avoid the big guns in the draw for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League, which takes place in Nyon (Switzerland) on Thursday 10:30am GMT.\n\nManchester United qualified as Group H winners and so are seeded in the draw but they still could be drawn against the big sides, while Arsenal finished as runners-up and like United could face the top guns especially Barcelona (third time in the past four seasons) in the knockout stages. On the other hand, Chelsea became the first holders to be eliminated in the group stages, while Manchester City were completely knocked out of Europe as they ended bottom of their group.\n\nGroup Winners: Paris Saint-Germain, Schalke, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nGroup Runners-Up: Porto, Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nBelow we have a look at each of the above 16 teams in detail..\n\nPARIS SAINT-GERMAIN\n\nCountry: France\n\nCoach: Carlo Ancelotti\n\nKey Player: Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nOther Star Players: Thiago Silva, Ezequiel Lavezzi & Javier Pastore\n\nRising Star: Marco Verratti\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Semi-final 1995\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nChances: PSG are one of the richest clubs in the world and have ambitions to win the Champions League this term. If striker Ibrahimovic can continue his superb form from the group stages, it might just happen.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nSCHALKE 04\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nCoach: Jens Keller\n\nKey Player: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar\n\nOther Star Players: Benedikt Howedes, Lewis Holtby & Kyriakos Papadopoulos\n\nRising Star: Julian Draxler\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Semi-final 2011\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, AC Milan, Shakhtar Donetsk, Galatasary, Valencia, Celtic, Real Madrid\n\nChances: The Germans were unbeaten through their group which consisted the likes of Arsenal, Olympiakos and Montpellier, which shows they are not a team to be taken for granted. One their day they could upset the big guns.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nMALAGA\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Manuel Pellengrini\n\nKey Player: Isco\n\nOther Star Players: Joaquin, Martin Demichelis & Eliseu\n\nRising Star: Francisco Portillo\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Debutants\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nChances: Have been very impressive so far in their debut season in the Champions League, but their inexperience in the competition may prove costly in the knockout stages.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nBORUSSIA DORTMUND\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nCoach: Jurgen Klopp\n\nKey Player: Marco Reus\n\nOther Star Players: Roberto Lewandowski, Mats Hummels & Mario Gotze\n\nRising Star: Moritz Leitner\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1997\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Arsenal, AC Milan, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic,Galatasaray\n\nChances: The reigning Bundesliga champions have very much caught the eye in the group stages after finishing at top of the Group of Death and are the team to beat. Considered as the dark horses for the title.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nJUVENTUS\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nCoach: Antonio Conte\n\nKey Player: Arturo Vidal\n\nOther Star Players: Andrea Pirlo, Gianluigi Buffon & Giorgio Chiellini\n\nRising Star: Paul Pogba\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1985, 1996\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Valencia, Celtic, Galatasaray\n\nChances: The reigning Serie A champions remained unbeaten in the group stages and topped their group by winning on the final matchday. The Italians are expected to step it up when the competition resumes in February.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nBAYERN MUNICH\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nCoach: Jupp Heynckes\n\nKey Player: Franck Ribery\n\nOther Star Players: Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger & Philipp Lahm\n\nRising Star: David Alaba\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1974, 1975, 1976, 2001\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Celtic,Galatasaray\n\nChances: The current Bundesliga leaders ended as the beaten finalists last season and will be looking to make amends for it. They have been in fine form so far and are one of the favourites to lift the trophy in May.\n\nPrediction: Semi-Finals\n\nBARCELONA\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Tito Vilanova\n\nKey Player: Lionel Messi\n\nOther Star Players: Andres Iniesta, Xavi & Sergio Busquets\n\nRising Star: Christian Tello\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1992, 2006, 2009, 2011\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, Arsenal, Galatasaray, AC Milan\n\nChances: The Catalans were the pre-tournament favourites to win the competition and there has been very little so far to suggest that they won’t win it this term. Vilanova has done brilliantly since taking over from Pep Guardiola in the summer.\n\nPrediction: Winners\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED\n\nCountry: England\n\nCoach: Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nKey Player: Wayne Rooney\n\nOther Star Players: Robin van Persie, Nemanja Vidic & Antonio Valencia\n\nRising Star: Rafael\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1968, 1999, 2008\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Porto, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, Valencia, Celtic\n\nChances: Unlike last season, United have marched pretty easily into the knockout stages and with Van Persie & Rooney both in form they are a team to fear. Surely one of the contenders for the title.\n\nPrediction: Semi-Finals\n\nPORTO\n\nCountry: Portugal\n\nCoach: Vitor Pereira\n\nKey Player: Jackson Martinez\n\nOther Star Players: Joao Moutinho, Lucho Gonzalez & Nicolas Otamendi\n\nRising Star: James Rodriguez\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winner 1987, 2004\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: Schalke, Malaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nChances: The Portuguese champions have gone all the way before but its very unlikely it will happen again this season. They have a very good squad with some very talented players but its highly unlikely they will trouble the big teams.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nARSENAL\n\nCountry: England\n\nCoach: Arsene Wenger\n\nKey Player: Santi Cazrola\n\nOther Star Players: Jack Wilshere, Thomas Vermaelen & Lukas Podolski\n\nRising Star: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Runner-up 2006\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Malaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona\n\nChances: The Gunners have had a stuttering season both domestically and in Europe – especially at home. They will need to improve a lot in the second half of the season if they want to be genuine title contenders.\n\nPrediction: Quarter-Finals\n\nAC MILAN\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nCoach: Massimiliano Allegri\n\nKey Player: Stephan El Shaarawy\n\nOther Star Players: Philippe Mexes, Ricardo Montolivo & Kevin-Prince Boateng\n\nRising Star: Mattia De Sciglio\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nChances: Like Arsenal, the Rossoneri are struggling this term domestically and in Europe. They are not the force of the old, although their pedigree and experience in this competition means they should not be taken lightly.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nREAL MADRID\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Jose Mourinho\n\nKey Player: Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nOther Star Players: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos & Mesut Ozil\n\nRising Star: Raphael Varane\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United\n\nChances: Its been over a decade since Real Madrid last won the Champions League and the boss Mourinho has never appeared more determined to win the tournament for the club this season. With the team they have they are regarded as the joint favourites alongside Barca.\n\nPrediction: Runners-Up\n\nSHAKHTAR DONETSK\n\nCountry: Ukraine\n\nCoach: Mircea Lucescu\n\nKey Player: Luiz Adriano\n\nOther Star Players: Darijo Srna, Willian & Fernandinho\n\nRising Star: Henrikh Mkhitaryan\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Quarter-final 2011\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Malaga, Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United\n\nChances: Like Dortmund, Shakhtar are another side that have grabbed the attention of many in the group stages. They are the ones who dumped Chelsea out of the tournament and a side very few people would want to face in the knockout stages.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nVALENCIA\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nCoach: Ernesto Valverde\n\nKey Player: Roberto Soldado\n\nOther Star Players: Jonas, Sofiane Feghouli & Adil Rami\n\nRising Star: Daniel Parejo\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Runner-up 2000, 2001\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Dortmund, Juventus, Manchester United\n\nChances: The Spaniards have been very impressive in the group stages with their star striker at the top of his game but do not appear equipped for a really extended run in competition this season.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nCELTIC\n\nCountry: Scotland\n\nCoach: Neil Lennon\n\nKey Player: Giorgos Samaras\n\nOther Star Players: Fraser Forster, Victor Wanyama & Gary Hooper\n\nRising Star: Anthony Watt\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Winners 1967\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Málaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United\n\nChances: Had little hopes of making it through to the knockout stages after being grouped with Barcelona, Benfica and Spartak Moscow but they did it. Anything else from now will be a bonus for the Scottish champions.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nGALATASARAY\n\nCountry: Turkey\n\nCoach: Fatih Terim\n\nKey Player: Burak Yilmaz\n\nOther Star Players: Felipe Melo, Nordin Amrabat & Hamit Altintop\n\nRising Star: Semih Kaya\n\nPrevious best in CL/European Cup: Semi-finals 1989\n\nPossible Round of 16 Opponents: PSG, Schalke, Málaga, Dortmund, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Barcelona\n\nChances: Snatched the second spot from CFR Cluj on the final matchday. Like Celtic, anything else they achieve from now on will be a bonus for the Turkish side and very few teams will fancy making the trip to the intimidating Turk Telekom Arena in Istanbul.\n\nPrediction: Round of 16\n\nEuropean glory is up for grabs on Sunday night at Kiev’s Olympic Stadium when the defending champions Spain go head-to-head against the 2006 World Cup winners Italy.\n\nNeither side have lost a match in the tournament so far but it will be the Italians who enter the showpiece in better form. Cesare Prandelli’s side were excellent in their quarter-final win over England – which was only decided on penalties because of their poor finishing – and they backed it up with a superb 2-1 victory against an in-form Germany. And although Spain will enter the final as favourites, Prandelli is confident his side can cause problems for their opponents. “We only have one day to prepare for this game but we will try to find Spain’s weaknesses,” Prandelli said. “They are the world and European champions and they are an example to everyone. But we have grown and we should not fear them. We have to have the strength to face them with ideas and quality.”\n\nReigning European champions Spain had the opportunity to eliminate Italy during the group stage, with both sides slugging it out in Group C. A 2-2 draw against Croatia in their final group game would have been enough to see Spain and the Croats progress at Italy’s expense. Del Bosque’s side play to win, though, and a late effort from Jesus Navas, coupled with a 2-0 victory for the Azzurri over the Republic of Ireland, kept things fair. Del Bosque has no regrets at having passed up the chance to send a rival packing and is looking forward to renewing acquaintances with a side that posed Spain plenty of problems during a 1-1 draw in the opening round of fixtures. “Never have we regretted not drawing with Croatia to eliminate Italy. This wasn’t good for sport,” Del Bosque said. “Italy and ourselves have lived parallel lives and now we have to be at the level that a final demands. In the game in the group stages they were possibly superior in the first half. They were the team that gave us most problems.”\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nSpain\n\nSpain boss Vicente del Bosque is expected to have a fully-fit squad for the Euro 2012 final showdown with Italy. The 61-year-old’s biggest selection dilemma is likely to be over whether to field a recognised striker after Alvaro Negredo’s anonymous performance in the semi-final win over Portugal. With Fernando Torres seemingly out of favour, and with Fernando Llorente yet to make an appearance at the tournament, Cesc Fabregas could be restored to a ‘false nine’ role up front alongside Andres Iniesta and David Silva.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly defender Ignazio Abate, who missed the semi-final win over Germany with a muscle injury, is likely to return to fitness in time for the final, while fellow full-back Christian Maggio is also available after serving a one-match ban. Coach Cesare Prandelli may persist with the same formation that served him well against the Germans rather than revert to the unorthodox 3-5-2 line-up used in the opening match against Spain. AC Milan-bound Riccardo Montolivo is likely to keep his place in the team ahead of Thiago Motta after an assured performance in the semi-final.\n\nROAD TO THE FINAL\n\nSpain\n\n10 Jun – Group C – Spain 1-1 Italy (Fabregas)\n\n14 Jun – Group C – Spain 4-0 Ireland (Torres(2), David Silva, Fabregas)\n\n18 Jun – Group C – Croatia 0-1 Spain (Jesus Navas)\n\n23 Jun – Quarter-Finals – Spain 2-0 France (Xabi Alonso(2))\n\n27 Jun – Semi-Finals – Portugal 0-0 (2-4P) Spain\n\nItaly\n\n10 Jun – Group C – Spain 1-1 Italy (Fabregas)\n\n14 Jun – Group C – Italy 1-1 Croatia (Pirlo)\n\n18 Jun – Group C – Italy 2-0 Ireland (Cassano, Balotelli)\n\n24 Jun – Quarter-Finals – England 0-0 (2-4P) Italy\n\n28 Jun – Semi-Finals – Germany 1-2 Italy (Balotelli(2))\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nPlayed – 30\n\nSpain Wins – 8\n\nDraws – 12\n\nItaly Wins – 10\n\nFORM GUIDE\n\nSpain – DWWWD\n\n27-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Portugal 0-0 Spain\n\n23-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 2-0 France\n\n18-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Croatia 0-1 Spain\n\n14-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 4-0 Ireland\n\n10-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 1-1 Italy\n\nItaly – WDWDD\n\n28-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 1-2 Italy\n\n22-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – England 0-0 Italy\n\n18-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Italy 2-0 Ireland\n\n14-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Italy 1-1 Crotia\n\n10-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 1-1 Italy\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nIker Casillas (Spain)\n\nThe Real Madrid and Spain captain is often unsung, but he steers the game out of the back, organizes the defense and restarts the attack. In Spain’s best games, he often has little to do which makes his concentration all the more remarkable: he is the rare keeper who can make the important save after sitting idle for 89 minutes. That’s a more valuable asset than most fans realize.\n\nAndres Iniesta (Spain)\n\nAgainst Portugal, the Barcelona playmaker was shackled and kept quiet. It showed in Spain’s insipid play. Iniesta has to have the ball and he has to have room to create. When he has both, Spain are the most vicious team on the planet, slicing apart defenses with abandon. But when he is off – and he rarely is – they are reduced to a passing team that must play keep-away and is very boring to watch.\n\nCesc Fabregas (Spain)\n\nDel Bosque’s insistence on packing his side with as many playmakers as possible has rendered Spain slow and predictable in possession, with not enough width to stretch the opposition. The 61-year-old could compensate for this by ordering Fabregas to make runs behind the Italian backline as often as possible to drag defenders out of position, thus creating space for Iniesta and Silva to run into.\n\nGianluigi Buffon (Italy)\n\nPirlo may control the game, but Buffon is the man who saves it. He was brilliant against Germany, swatting away shot after shot and showing control of his area that most keepers can only dream of. A consummate competitor, he also stalked off the field after their win, clearly unhappy. Why? Italy had wasted too many chances at the other end. That kind of fire drives teams, and Italy’s captain has fire in spades.\n\nAndrea Pirlo (Italy)\n\nEven though Balotelli was praised by the football fraternity for his two goals against Germany, it was Pirlo’s brilliance on the field that won him his third Man of the Match award for the tournament. Pirlo has been able to topple all the opponents with his accurate passes and wise decisions creating opportunities for his team-mates to score goals every now and then. Along with Balotelli, Italy will need Pirlo to use his experience for a formidable show.\n\nMario Balotelli (Italy)\n\nEven though many disagree on the striker’s maturity level, none would doubt Mario Ballotelli’s ability on the pitch as a footballer. He proved his worth against Germany in the last four as he was key to Italy’s place in the final. After being inconsistent throughout the tournament, Balotelli was the catalyst against Germany which rung the bells for the defending champions. The fans would expect an encore from Balotelli and with a formidable show; he can also bag the much coveted golden boot.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nSpain (4-3-3): Iker Casillas (C); Alvaro Arbeloa, Sergio Ramos, Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba; Sergi Busquets, Xavi, Xabi Alonso; David Silva, Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta.\n\nThe Spaniards are expected to field the same side that featured against the Italians in the first game in Group C. Cesc Fabregas, who scored the winning penalty against Portugal, will come in place for Alvaro Negredo, who was quite annonymous during the semi-finals. The rest of the starting XI will be the same. But at the same time, Del Bosque is not shy of throwing in some surprises and might actually play Pedro or Jesus Navas or Fernando Torres in place of David Silva or in the central striker role. Pedro and Jesus Navas were very impressive against the Portuguese after coming on as substitutes and caused Cristiano Ronaldo and co some problems.\n\nItaly (4-3-1-2): Gianluigi Buffon (C); Ignazio Abate, Andrea Barzagli, Giorgio Chiellini, Federico Balzaretti; Claudio Marchisio, Andrea Pirlo, Daniele De Rossi; Ricardo Montolivo; Mario Balotelli, Antonio Cassano.\n\nIt hardly seems that boss Cesare Prandelli will change his winning team that defeated Germany in the semi-finals. However, a solitary change is a possibility with the AC Milan right back Ignazio Abate coming back in the side for Leanardo Bonucci with Federico Balzaretti going back to his normal left back position. Rest of the side will remain the same with Andrea Pirlo, Claudio Marschiso and Daniele De Rossi playing in center midfield just behind Ricardo Montolivo. Up front, the attacking duo of Mario Balotelli and Antonio Cassano are set to start yet again after an very impressive display against the Germans.\n\nKEY BATTLES\n\nSergio Ramos v Mario Balotelli\n\nWith Carles Puyol ruled out for the entire tournament by injury, Sergio Ramos has cemented his place as Gerard Pique’s partner at the heart of Spain’s defence. His replica of Andre Pirlo’s penalty in the semi-final penalty shoot-out win over Portugal demonstrated his confidence. Mario Balotelli appears to be maturing before our very eyes at UEFA EURO 2012. His form and attitude were questioned in Italy’s first two games but he has been almost unplayable since scoring the stunning goal as a substitute against Ireland.\n\nXavi v Andrea Pirlo\n\nA mouthwatering showdown between two of the best passers ever to grace the game. Xavi’s status as an all-time great has already been assured but he has yet to hit the heights in Poland/Ukraine and will be desperate to do so on Sunday. Andrea Pirlo has been peerless for Italy and almost has the Player of the Tournament award wrapped up ahead of the final.\n\nAndres Iniesta v Ignazio Abate/Federico Balzaretti\n\nIf Spain decide not to play a striker, their midfield will have to fill the void and no-one is more capable of doing so than Andres Iniesta, whose goal settled the 2010 World Cup. The 28-year-old also likes to drift out wide, where he will doubtless come up against Ignazio Abate or Federico Balzaretti. The AC Milan right-back and the Juventus defender both have been very impressive going forward during the tournament.\n\nTHE STADIUM\n\nName: Olympic Stadium, Kiev\n\nUEFA Capacity: 64,640\n\nRecord attendance: 102,000 (2-0 FC Dynamo Kyiv v FC Bayern München on 16/03/1977)\n\nTenants: Ukrainian national team\n\nOpened: 1923 (reopened October 2011)\n\n• Located at the foot of city’s central Cherepanov Hill in Pechersk, the venue started life as the Red Stadium of Lev Trotsky and has enjoyed numerous face-lifts (minor and major) since.\n\n• The latest stadium reconstruction, from December 2008 to October 2011, saw the demolition and rebuilding of the lower tier, a new West Stand with a two-level press box or VIP seats between the two tiers and the addition of a new transparent roof.\n\n• Andriy Yarmolenko scored the first goal at the renovated Olympic Stadium on 11 November 2011, a crowd of 70,000 in attendance as Ukraine led 2-0 and 3-1 before drawing 3-3 with Germany.\n\n• It has had several monikers, too. It became simply the Red Stadium before being renamed the Republican Stadium in 1936 and, barring a 17-year stint as the Central Stadium (1962 to 1979), kept the title until 1996. Then it adopted its current Olympic name, a nod to the 1980 Moscow Olympics when it hosted seven games.\n\n• The stadium is the traditional stage for Dynamo Kiev’s European games, replacing the 16,973-capacity Valeriy Lobanovskiy Stadium.\n\n• Because there were no seats the venue often exceeded its official 100,062 capacity. Newspapers used to just report attendance as being ‘chock-full’.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE MATCH BALL\n\nThe adidas Tango 12 Finale features a modern interpretation of classic Tango design, used during FIFA World Cups and UEFA European Championships during the early 1980s, including bespoke graphics designed to represent the two host countries and the key characteristics of football – unity, rivalry and passion.\n\nDeveloped over a two-year period, it has been constructed in the same way as the ball which will be used during the rest of the tournament. That ball was presented in December 2011 at the EURO draw and distributed to the participating teams.\n\nThe final ball underwent two rigorous types of testing – qualitative player testing, which was conducted across eight different countries, using players, federations and clubs from both elite and grassroots football, and quantitative lab testing, which concluded that the adidas Tango 12 Finale meets and exceeds all FIFA standards for an official match ball, making it the most tested ball adidas has ever produced.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE TROPHY\n\nSpain’s Iker Casillas had the pleasure of becoming the first captain to lift the updated version of the Henri Delaunay Cup in June 2008, with the new trophy a fitting replacement for the prize that has been synonymous with the UEFA European Championship.\n\nThe second version of the trophy is based on the original designed by Arthus-Bertrand in 1960 and named after Henri Delaunay, the former president of the French Football Federation and UEFA’s first general secretary, from the body’s founding on 15 June 1954 to 9 November 1955.\n\nIt is 18cm higher and 2kg heavier than the original, made of sterling silver, and has retained its historical name. The trophy was reincarnated to reflect the scale and size of Europe’s most prestigious international tournament.\n\nThe responsibility for creating the original went to Pierre Delaunay, son of Henri, the visionary behind the competition. Henri Delaunay died in 1955 before seeing his idea come to fruition, but the updated prize is testament to his enduring legacy, maintaining its classic style.\n\nMinor differences between the original and updated version include the silver base being enlarged to make it stable. In addition, the names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have been engraved on the back of the trophy, which weighs 8kg and is 60cm tall.\n\nUnlike the original, which was the work of the Chobillon goldsmith and was later bought by Arthus-Bertrand in Paris, the making of the modern equivalent was entrusted to Asprey London.\n\nAsprey, renowned silversmiths, jewellers and goldsmiths, have a long history of trophy-making stretching back to the America’s Cup, which their sister company Garrard produced in 1848. UEFA wanted to improve on the quality but also the scale of the trophy, and have a focal point for the event – it was felt that the original trophy was too small to do this.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE REFEREE\n\nPedro Proenca of Portugal has been selected to referee the UEFA EURO 2012 final between Italy and Spain at the Olympic Stadium in Kyiv on Sunday. The appointment completes a memorable end to the season for the financial director from Pinhal Novo, who oversaw last month’s UEFA Champions League showpiece in Munich, where Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich on penalties.\n\nSunday’s fixture will be the 41-year-old’s fourth of the tournament, having taken charge of two group stage matches – Spain’s 4-0 victory against the Republic of Ireland on 14 June and Sweden’s 2-0 defeat of France five days later – as well as the England-Italy quarter-final in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nProenca will be assisted by countrymen Bertino Cunha Miranda and Ricardo Jorge Ferreira Santos, with Manuel Jorge Neves Moreira De Sousa and Duarte Nuno Pereira Gomes acting as additional assistant referees. The fourth official will be Cüneyt Cakır and the reserve assistant referee Bahattin Duran, both from Turkey.\n\nProenca has been on the rise in European refereeing circles since handling the UEFA European Under-19 Championship final in 2004. Promoted to UEFA’s Elite category at the start of 2009/10, he was in the middle for four games in that season’s UEFA Champions League, five in the 2010/11 edition and six this term, culminating in the Fußball Arena Munchen decider on 19 May.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nTHE CLOSING CEREMONY\n\nKiev’s Olympic Stadium will host the UEFA EURO 2012 closing ceremony on Sunday, an unforgettable curtain-raiser to the final between Spain and Italy.\n\nInspired by football, the 16 participating teams and the tournament’s values, the 12-minute show will be presented shortly before kick-off, and will feature more than 600 volunteer performers. The concept has been created to celebrate the end of a historical event – the first UEFA European Championship staged in central and eastern Europe. It will also promote the participating nations together with key competition values: unity, rivalry and passion.\n\nBoth the opening and closing ceremonies were devised by Marco Balich, the president of Filmmaster Events, along with artistic director Lida Castelli and show director Bryn Walters. Balich has designed many international events, including the 2002 Olympic flag handover in Salt Lake City, the 2006 Olympic ceremonies in Turin and the Carnival of Venice.\n\nThe official tournament song, Endless Summer, will be performed live by German singer Oceana. The UEFA EURO 2012 hit is the first single from Oceana’s outstanding new studio album, recorded in London, New York and Berlin with producers including Rob Davis (Kylie Minogue) and Blair McKichan (Lily Allen). The national anthems of both finalists will be presented by Tamara Khodakova and Mykhailo Humenniy – soloists from the Kyiv Municipal Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre, under the leadership of Anzhela Maslennikova.\n\nA total of 150 million viewers are expected to watch the UEFA EURO 2012 final live.\n\n(source: uefa.com)\n\nBETTING ODDS\n\nMatch Result\n\nSpain – 6/5\n\nDraw – 11/5\n\nItaly – 5/2\n\nTo Lift The Trophy\n\nSpain – 8/15\n\nItaly – 6/4\n\nMethod Of Victory\n\nSpain in extra time – 10/1\n\nItaly in extra time – 14/1\n\nSpain on penalties – 9/1\n\nItaly on penalties – 9/1\n\nCorrect Score\n\nSpain 1-0 – 5/1\n\nDraw 0-0 – 11/2\n\nItaly 1-0 – 15/2\n\nSpain 2-0 – 17/2\n\nDraw 1-1 – 11/2\n\nItaly 2-0 – 18/1\n\nSpain 2-1 – 9/1\n\nDraw 2-2 – 22/1\n\nItaly 2-1 – 14/1\n\nSpain 3-0 – 25/1\n\nDraw 3-3 – 125/1\n\nItaly 3-0 – 66/1\n\nSpain 3-1 – 22/1\n\nDraw 4-4 – 250/1\n\nItaly 3-1 – 50/1\n\nHalf-Time/Full-Time\n\nSpain / Spain – 11/4\n\nDraw / Spain – 4/1\n\nItaly / Spain – 28/1\n\nSpain / Draw – 16/1\n\nDraw / Draw – 7/2\n\nItaly / Draw – 16/1\n\nSpain / Italy – 33/1\n\nDraw / Italy – 15/2\n\nItaly / Italy – 13/2\n\nUnder/Over 2.5 Goals\n\nUnder 2.5 Goals – 4/9\n\nOver 2.5 Goals – 13/8\n\nBoth Teams to Score\n\nYes – 5/4\n\nNo – 4/7\n\nGoalscorer\n\nNo Italy Goalscorer – 6/5\n\nNo Spain Goalscorer – 15/8\n\nMario Balotelli – 12/5\n\nFernando Torres – 5/2\n\nCesc Fabregas – 5/2\n\nAntonio Di Natale – 7/2\n\nPedro – 7/2\n\nAntonio Cassano – 7/2\n\nDavid Silva – 7/2\n\nFernando Llorente – 11/4\n\nAlvaro Negredo – 11/4\n\nFabio Borini – 11/4\n\nSebastian Giovinco – 11/2\n\nAlessandro Diamanti – 11/2\n\nAndres Iniesta – 4/1\n\nAndrea Pirlo – 6/1\n\nWinning Margin\n\nSpain by Exactly 1 Goal – 5/2\n\nItaly by Exactly 1 Goal – 7/2\n\nSpain by Exactly 2 Goals – 6/1\n\nItaly by Exactly 2 Goals – 12/1\n\nSpain by 3 or more Goals – 14/1\n\nItaly by 3 or more Goals – 33/1\n\n(source: skybet.com)\n\nPREDICTION\n\nSpain are the favourites to go and defend their European crown, but no team in the history has ever done that and so it would be a huge achievement. Spain came to Poland/Ukraine as the pre-tournament favourites, but they have not looked any where near their best. This is the best possible time to play Spain as they have grinded out results in almost all their games – except the ones against Ireland and France – and looked too tired against Portugal in the semi-finals. On the other hand, Italy have defined the odds to come so far and have beaten the likes of England and Germany on the way. The Azzurri are finding the right form at the right time in the tournament and they have all the weapons they need to hurt their opponents on the counter.\n\nPredicted Score – Spain 0-1 Italy\n\nDefending champions Spain battle with their Iberian neighbours Portugal for a spot in the UEFA EURO 2012 final when they meet in the semi-finals at the Donbass Arena in Donetsk tonight.\n\nBoth teams enter the last-four clash on the back of three consecutive wins at the tournament, with Sunday’s final clearly in sight. Vicente del Bosque’s Spain produced an effective quarter-final victory against France, while their neighbours downed Czech Republic to advance.\n\nPaulo Bento believes patience is key if his Portugal side are going to find a way past the holders and world champions in Donetsk. “Of course there are going to be moments in the game when we can link up and go forward,” he said in Tuesday’s pre-game press conference. We want possession of the ball but we are playing against a team that has played better than all the other teams. It’s going to be about patience. We know what we have to do. We have to put pressure on our opponents in the right areas of the pitch. Our aim is not to defend all the time. You can’t do that against the world and European champions. We are aware that it’s going to be difficult but they also know that we can cause them problems. It was very easy to get motivated because we’re in the semi-finals. There can’t be a more beautiful opportunity than the one we have tomorrow.”\n\n“We’ll intend to throw him (Cristiano Ronaldo) off his game, the best example of that is the second round win at the World Cup, where we managed the better result,” said Vicente Del Bosque of a 1-0 win over Portugal in Johannesburg. “The idea will be the same.” Spain has won its last six knockout round games at major tournaments by a combined score of 7-0. Although the team is not providing eye-catching scorelines, it has shown patience and maturity to break down opponents who nearly always ‘park the bus’, or take a completely defensive approach. “I would prefer if they play back in their own half, it’s a satisfaction for us to keep possession,” Del Bosque said of the Portuguese. “They have enough players that can provide alternatives to their attack, but I would like it if they played in a defensive way because we have solutions to combat that.”\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nPortugal\n\nReal Zaragoza frontman Postiga has been ruled out with a thigh injury, meaning coach Bento will be unable to field the same starting line-up which he has used in the last six competitive matches. Besiktas forward Hugo Almeida is expected to get the nod in Donetsk, with 20-year-old Nelson Oliveira, who has come on as a substitute three times in the tournament, likely to be on the bench again. Almeida will be flanked in the Portuguese attack by Cristiano Ronaldo, whose glittering displays against the Netherlands and the Czechs played a decisive part in sending Portugal into the last four.\n\nSpain\n\nDel Bosque reported no new injury problems following the quarter-final victory against Les Bleus. However, he must decide whether to start the game again without a recognised striker and allow Cesc Fabregas to fill the role. If Del Bosque decides against the quarter-final line-up, Fernando Torres could lead the line, while Pedro could also get a start in the Spain midfield.\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nPlayed – 34\n\nPortugal Wins – 6\n\nDraws – 12\n\nSpain Wins – 16\n\nFORM GUIDE\n\nPortugal – WWWLL\n\n21-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Czech Republic 0-1 Portugal\n\n17-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Portugal 2-1 Netherlands\n\n13-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Denmark 2-3 Portugal\n\n09-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 1-0 Portugal\n\n02-Jun-12 – Friendly – Portugal 1-3 Turkey\n\nSpain – WWWDW\n\n23-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 2-0 France\n\n18-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Croatia 0-1 Spain\n\n14-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 4-0 Ireland\n\n10-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Spain 1-1 Italy\n\n03-Jun-12 – Friendly – Spain 1-0 China\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nPepe (Portugal)\n\nThe Real Madrid defender has been as solid as a rock in the heart of the Portuguese defence. The hard tacking defender has had an excellent tournament so far, and has been one of the reason why Portugal are in the semi-finals. He was solid against the Czechs on Thursday. Another performance like that against the Spaniards today and Portugal could be through to the finals.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)\n\nHe would undoubtedly be the key man for his side, as he is the only player who looks capable of breaching the solid Spanish defence and getting past his Real Madrid teammate Iker Casillas. He has been in tremendous form in the last two matches, scoring three goals and hitting the post four times and is sure to be the biggest test yet for his opposing Captain Casillas.\n\nIker Casillas (Spain)\n\nThe Spanish captain hasn’t been troubled a lot so far in this tournament and this will be arguably his toughest test in Poland/Ukraine. He has been in good form throughout the year for both Real Madrid and Spain and today he will face his club teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. If Casillas is able to keep Ronaldo quite and not let him score any goals today then La Roja have a huge chance of progressing to final.\n\nAndres Iniesta (Spain)\n\nThe Barcelona star has undoubtedly been one of the best players in attack for Spain and has hardly let anyone feel David Villa’s absence. Although kept quiet for most of the last game, he did deliver the beautifully weighted pass that let in Jordi Alba to cross for the first goal. He would be raring to go and make an impact against arch-rivals Portugal today and help his team progress to the final.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nPortugal (4-3-3): Rui Patricio; Joao Perreira, Pepe, Bruno Alves, Fabio Coentrao; Miguel Veloso, Raul Meireles, Joao Moutinho; Nani, Hugo Almeida, Cristiano Ronaldo (C).\n\nThe Portuguese would match Spain’s 4-3-3 formation. However, with Helder Postiga set to miss the clash due to the injury sustained in the quarter-finals, Hugo Almeida is expected to start as the centre man in the front three. He would be the target man and long balls would be hit straight at him, which he would be expected to hold up and then bring the dangerous wingers Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani into play. The rest of the team would be the same which has taken field in all four matches.\n\nSpain (4-3-3): Iker Casillas (C); Alvaro Arbeloa, Sergio Ramos, Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba; Sergi Busquets, Xavi, Xabi Alonso; David Silva, Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta.\n\nThe defending champions are expected to line-up in the same 4-3-3 formation that started against the French and completely dominated the game. Fabregas was not too impressive, but would still be expected to start ahead of Fernando Torres as he fits better in the team whose emphasis is on passing football and keeping possession. Plus he has better understanding with the other Barcelona players in the squad. Del Bosque would keep the same team players that have delivered the results.\n\nMATCH ODDS\n\nPortugal 10/3 Draw 23/10 Spain 10/11\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThe rivalry will be there for everyone to see and it is set to be a tough battle. Portugal have played to their potential in the UEFA EURO 2012 and arguably the same cannot be said for Spain. Spain will play as expected and dominate the possession, while the Portuguese will b looking to catch them on the counter with their pacey wingers. It’s very hard to see Spain losing today as they have the experience and the extra bid of quality in their midfield which could be the difference between the two sides in Donetsk.\n\nPredicted Score – Portugal 1-2 Spain\n\nWhat an exciting season of football it has been across Europe this year. Real Madrid, Manchester City, Juventus all won their first ever league titles in years, while Montpellier won the Ligue 1 for the first time in their history and Dortmund made it two in two years in the Bundesliga. Chelsea shocked the footballing world by winning the Champions League against all odds and Atletico Madrid defeated their Spanish rivals Athletic Bilbao to win the Europa League in Bucharest.\n\nAs we draw to an end to league football across Europe for the season and as we move closer to the European Championships in Poland & Ukraine in the summer, we look at the eleven best players and one manager who form our European Team of the Season 2011/12.\n\nGianluigi Buffon (GK) – Juventus\n\nHe has been a loyal servant to the Bianconeri having stayed at the club through the Calciopoli Scandal and the relegation to Serie B in 2006/07. At 34-years of age, many thought he was past his peak but he has proved everyone wrong. Except for that one blunder against Lecce, the 2006 World Cup winner was back to his best and with 21 clean sheets and just 16 goals conceded, he has to be the best keeper around Europe this season ahead of the likes of Iker Casillas, Joe Hart or Manuel Neuer.\n\nLukasz Piszczek (RB) – Dortmund\n\nThe Poland international has been sensational for Dortmund this season as they went on to do the domestic double by winning the Bundesliga and the DFB Pokal. The 26-year-old has had an outstanding season for the Bundesliga champions this year and he comes in this team ahead of the German captain Philipp Lahm and Barcelona’s Dani Alves. Piszczek has been very good both offensively and defensively for his side and he is the leading goal scorer as a right back this season with 4 goals.\n\nMats Hummels (CB) – Dortmund\n\nHe is the second Dortmund and Bundesliga player in this team and truly deserves his place. Hummels has been a rock in the defence for the Bundesliga champions this season and his partnership with Nevan Subotic in center of that Dortmund defence, has conceded just 25 goals this season. He is in the team ahead of the likes of Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol and Thiago Silva and is there for a good reason as he has been able to stop Bundesliga’s top strikers like Mario Gomez, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Lukas Podolski, Raul, Claudio Pizarro and Marco Reus from scoring any goals against BVB this season.\n\nVincent Kompany (CB) (C) – Manchester City\n\nWhat a season this man has had. He led City to their first ever league title in 44 years and also scored the most important goal against Manchester United in the Manchester derby at the Etihad stadium which decided the title. Like Hummels, Kompany has been a rock in that City defence and the Premier League champions have missed him badly whenever he was injured or suspended. The Belgium international who has scored three goals and created one this season is also Premier League’s Player of the Year. He has been a true leader on and off the pitch and has also been an inspiration for his City team-mates and that’s why he is also the captain of this team.\n\nJordi Alba (LB) – Valencia\n\nThis year has been a dream year for Jordi Alba. The left back who came through the ranks at La Masia has been in form for Valencia this season, making the step up to the national team to become Spain’s first choice left back. With 2 goals and 5 assists, Jordi Alba has been a key member of the Valencia team that finished third for the third time in a row. With his performances attracting interests from the likes of Manchester United and Barcelona, dont expect him to be around at the Mestalla next season. The young Spaniard is in the team ahead of Philipp Lahm, Ashley Cole and Patrice Evra.\n\nAndrea Pirlo (CM) – Juventus\n\nFor me Pirlo has to be Serie A’s Player of the Season. Many thought the Italian international was past his prime and finished when he left Milan for free last summer and joined Juventus. But like Buffon, he has answered his critics by the performances on the field. The veteran was a standout in his debut match against Parma as he put in an outstanding performance in 4-1 win and as the season progressed he got better and better. With 13 assists and 3 goals to his name in 37 league appearances this season he has proved everyone that he is far from finished and is surely a player to watch at the Euros this summer.\n\nYaya Toure (CM) – Manchester City\n\nDavid Silva, Vincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero got all the praise for guiding Manchester City to their first ever league title in 44 years but Yaya Toure has played a key part as well. He play like what Patrick Vieira use to play during his times at Arsenal and is the driving force in the heart of the City midfield. The Blues missed the Ivorian badly when he was on international duty during African Cup of Nations but ever since his return he has been inspirational in their bid for the title. He also scored the two important goals for City at Newcastle in penultimate game of the season that got them one step closer to the title.\n\nMesut Ozil (CAM) – Real Madrid\n\nFor an attacking midfielder with an advanced role Mesut Ozil doesn’t score enough goals but has been a vital part of Real Madrid team this season as they went to win their 32nd La Liga title. The German international has just 7 goals in 52 appearances this season but has created 23 goals which is only second best to Lionel Messi (28). His movement off the ball is one of the best in the world at the moment and has been consistently the best attacking midfielder for the last two years for both club and country. He is in the team ahead of David Silva because he guided Los Blancos to the semi finals of the Champions League and also created the goal for Cristiano Ronaldo against Barcelona which handed the league title to Jose Mourinho’s men.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (RW) – Real Madrid\n\nThe Portuguese failed to win the Golden Boot or the Pichichi Trophy this season as he ended just four goals behind Lionel Messi but it was Ronaldo who had the last laugh as Real Madrid went on to win their first ever league title since 2008. With 46 goals in the La Liga and 60 in all competitions, the former Manchester United player has played a pivotal role in helping Mourinho’s men win their 32nd La Liga title and also reaching the semi finals of the Champions League this season. The 27-year-old’s winner against Barcelona at Camp Nou guaranteed that the league title will be heading back to Madrid.\n\nLionel Messi (LW) – Barcelona\n\nIt hasn’t been a good season for Barcelona as they finished second behind Real Madrid in the league and were knocked out by eventual winners Chelsea in the semi finals of the Champions League but on a personal note it has been Messi’s best season as he continued to break more records. He went on to become the club’s all-time highest goalscorer this season with 252 goals in all competitions and also set a new record of goals in a European season with 72. He also created a new record of most number of goals scored in the league with an incredible number of 50 goals.\n\nRobin van Persie (ST) – Arsenal\n\nThe Dutcman has single-handedly carried Arsenal on his shoulders and guided them to a third place finish in the Premier League after having one of their worst starts to the season. He scored 30 league goals this season and those goals consisted of both stunning striker and poacher like finishes which proves what a complete striker he is. The PFA Player of the Year and the Premier League Golden Boot winner has been a true leader for the young Arsenal side on the pitch and has brought them back from the dead too many times this season. He is the key to any future success that is in store for Arsenal and the Gunners must do everything possible to keep him at the club.\n\nAntonio Conte (Manager) – Juventus\n\nIt was a tough choice to choose between Conte and Jose Mourinho as both led their clubs to league success after many years but in the end it was Italian for me. The former Juventus fan favourite was appointed as the new coach at the start of the season and did a tremendous job in his first season by lead the Bianconeri to their first ever Scudetto title since 2006. In the process Juventus stayed unbeaten in the Serie A through out the season, winning 23 and drawing 15 games. Conte also guided the Zebras to their first ever Coppa Italia final since 2004 only to be beaten by Napoli 2-0. The Italian who joined in May last summer has now signed a new contract which will see him stay at the Juventus Stadium for the next three years.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nPetr Cech (Chelsea), Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Xavi (Barcelona), David Silva (Manchester City), Franck Ribery (Bayern Munich), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)."
