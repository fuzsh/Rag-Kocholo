One needs only look at the surface of the Moon to get a sense of just how many impacts there were. In fact, collisions of asteroids with the early Earth may have been the key to delivering water to our planet (e.g., Daly & Schultz, 2018), enabling life as we know it. Now, billions of years later, the influx of small bodies in the inner Solar System is much lower. Those that do are called Near Earth Objects (or NEOs).\n\nFormally, an NEO is any comet or asteroid (also referred to, in particular, as Near Earth Asteroids, or NEAs) that passes within 1.3 astronomical units (au) of the Sun — this is slightly farther than the average radius of the Earth’s orbit. Further restrictions may be placed on the orbital period or the orbit’s semimajor axis to avoid including objects with long periods (such as comets with a very close approach to the Sun). NEOs typically only spend a short time orbiting in this region of the Solar System (their median lifetime is only about 10 million years, as most NEOs crash into the Sun). Still, their number is continually replenished and kept in a steady state by dynamical mechanisms that transport asteroids from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter to the terrestrial planet region.\n\nThere are four different classes of NEAs, depending on the object’s current orbit. However, an individual object can move from one class to another as planetary flybys or non-gravitational forces change its orbit. These classes are summarised in Figure 1. Amor and Apollo class NEAs are the most numerous populations; these comprise more than 90% of the known NEAs (JPL, 2023a). Apollo and Aten NEAs have Earth-crossing orbits, though this designation does not necessarily make them hazardous to life on Earth.\n\nTo be classified as a “potentially hazardous object” (PHO), an NEA must be on an Apollo or Aten orbit, must be larger than 140m across, and must travel to within 0.05 au of anywhere along Earth’s orbit. Most of the known PHOs are asteroids: there are currently known PHAs (JPL, 2023a). Note that the designation “potentially hazardous object” does not necessarily mean that the object will impact the Earth in the foreseeable future. It simply means that we should pay extra attention to these because (1) these objects are closer to the Earth’s orbit than most NEOs; and (2) in the unlikely event of an impact, the result would have global implications.\n\nFigure 1: The four orbit families of Near Earth Asteroids.

When an observer discovers a body moving relative to the background, they will send the information (position on the sky and time of observation) to the IAU Minor Planet Center (MPC), located at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Most observers will try to obtain at least three sets of observations during the night. MPC combines all data received for this object, calculates, and publicises its orbit in real-time. Since only very preliminary orbits can be determined from a single night of data, more observations must be made — and quickly! — for MPC to precisely calculate the orbit and announce the discovery of the NEO in an MPC Electronic Circular (MPEC). The MPC is not the only institution doing this work: the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL) also calculates the orbits of newly-discovered, yet-to-be-confirmed NEOs in near time and provides warnings for possible impactors.\n\nFigure 2: The number of NEOs discovered from 1980 to the present. Image Credit: JPL (2023a)\n\nIn recent years, several all-sky surveys have come online to spot and track NEOs as they pass by the Earth. For that reason, it might appear that the number of NEOs has dramatically increased (see Figure 2). However, that simply results from being better equipped to observe them. Numerous ground and space-based observation programmes from around the world aim to discover, track, and understand NEOs.\n\nThere are many programmes around the world that are currently in production to aid in the effort of scanning the night sky for NEOs. For example, when it is operational, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory plans to undertake the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This survey will scan the whole night sky visible from Chile once at least every three days using the world’s largest astronomical camera (at the time of its completion). Another example comes from the European Space Agency, which is building a network of observatories that will be able to observe the entire sky in a single night. Named Flyeye, this project’s optical design got its inspiration from the compound eyes of a fly that enable it to look in multiple directions at once.\n\nThere are also major projects that will take on this challenge from space. For example, NASA has initiated a new space mission specifically designed to detect, track, and characterise NEOs: the NEO Surveyor. This will be the first space telescope dedicated to discovering asteroids and comets and has been designed to find more than 90% of all PHAs. NEO Surveyor will observe at the wavelengths where NEOs are the brightest (the infrared), and will launch no later than June 2028 to conduct a 5-year survey of the sky. This spacecraft is expected to discover hundreds of thousands of NEOs, millions of asteroids in the Main Belt, and thousands of comets during its survey, greatly expanding our census of the NEO population. By observing in the infrared, NEO Surveyor will also obtain data needed to measure the size of each asteroid, which is a critical component to constrain the hazard the object would pose to the Earth in the case of an impact.\n\nNEO Risk Determination\n\nThere are two scales on which astronomers determine the risk associated with an NEO: the Torino Scale and Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale.\n\nThe Torino Scale (Morrison et al., 2009) paints a broad picture of the risk associated with a NEO. It is based on impact probability (how likely an object is to hit the Earth or its atmosphere) and kinetic energy (this depends on how fast the object moves and how massive it is). The Scale ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no hazard, and 10 indicates a certain impact with likely catastrophic global effects. While several NEAs are initially categorised as a 1 (normal) on the Torino Scale every year, as more data is taken of these objects, they are usually downgraded to a level 0 in due course. As of this writing, there is 1 NEO that rates higher than level 0 on the Torino Scale (JPL, 2023b)."
