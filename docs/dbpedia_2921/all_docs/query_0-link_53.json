        "text": "The use of technology in industrial settings relies on connectivity, which is not possible in enclosed spaces. Industiral plants are usually located in connected areas, but connectivity or power outages may occur.\n\nOur IoT satellite connectivity modem can be integrated into existing local network, providing an independent backup connectivity hardware and sensors.\n\nAdvangtages\n\nThe continuity of info provision over plants & platforms;\n\nEnforcing ubiquitous control over complex machineries.\n\nThe use of technology in glaciers and water infrastructures relies on connectivity, which allows monitoring remote areas, enabling efficient data collection and analysis for scientific research, resource management, and early awarning system.\n\nThe IoT satellite modem of our picosatellites can be flexibly integrated into any hardware and sensors.\n\nUsage\n\nClimate change research, facilitating the connection of long-term data on e.g. glacier melting rates, ice thickness and aquifer depletion;\n\nWater resource planning, providing insights into water availability and streamflow patterns;\n\nThe assessments of infrastructure stability, including hydroelectric dams, underground pipelines and checking cities pipelines for leaks.\n\nIn the realm of smart cities, our hybrid service technology, with the use of gateways, emerges as particularly suitable in addressing urban connectivity challenges and monitoring infrastructure performances (frequency used is originally leveraged for gas metering). This innovative approach offers a multitude of advantages.\n\nAdvantages\n\nSignal penetration and obstacle mitigation for uninterrupted communication;\n\nReal-time coverage to address emergencies faster;\n\nOptimize resources ad improve service delivery.\n\nThe use of technology in agriculture relies on connectivity which is often lacking in large crop land.\n\nModems connecting to our picosatellite constellation can be flexibly integrated in any sensorized hardware.\n\nUsage\n\nRetrieval data from a variety of sensors (humidity, temperature, ecc…).\n\nSupport Precision Farming applications in remote areas and large crop lands.\n\nBenefits\n\nBeing independent from the phone network.\n\nPossibly running on batteries and solar cells.\n\nRobbery is a common issue with container shipping, where goods are found stolen or not corresponding to custom declaration.\n\nLockers connected with our Iot satellite connectivity solutions prevent these problems.\n\nUsage\n\nThey allow logging authorised and unauthorised operations.\n\nThey track locations, even on sea.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe operation and track record of the container is broadcasted to Apogeo Space’s picosatellites network.\n\nOperation and track recorded data is available to shipping companies supporting management and operations activities.\n\nEnforces ubiquitous control over goods."
