Showing an increase in production, nine more cubesats launches are planned for 2020 - 2022: Alfa Crux, 14BisSat, NCBR-2, ConnaSat A, ConnaSat B, Garatea, Sport and the VCUB constellation. With a growing national interest in CubeSat platform and variations, a transition from educational and experimental activities to a more demand driven technology production is expected. In 2018, a joint initiative between the Brazilian Space Agency and Brazil Industrial Development Agency opened the discussion on commercial development of mature technology. At the occasion, in São José dos Campos, the nation’s aerospace demands were categorized in earth observation, data gathering, meteorology, communication, GP Sand science missions. The present study explores the goals and status of previous Brazilian CubeSat missions, and of the next nine missions planned for the near future. The objective is to investigate the gap between academic and industrial development with a pragmatic view, giving emphasis to the next steps needed to approximate both sectors and stimulate the country’s small satellites production and applications. Furthermore, the analyses should serve as a blueprint for business that plan on engaging in future missions in and applications.\n\nKeywords: cubesat, Brazil, constellation, overview, business, analysis\n\nIntroduction\n\nOverview of the seven Brazilian smallsats\n\nAnalysis of launched Brazilian smallsats\n\nFuture cubesats preview\n\nBrazilian small satellites future missions analysis\n\nWith the past, present and future small satellites data, it is possible to enhance the previous analysis done on topic 3. Starting with the region analysis, the future projects are also centered on the south and southeast regions of the country, with exception of the alfa crux project that is managed by a professor from the center region (Brasília) and Sacode and ConaSat projects, that are being developed on the northeast region. So it is possible to see the production centered on the south and southeast region of the country, but is also possible to see that other parts of Brazil are starting to develop space technologies. Analyzing the development time, it is possible to see that some projects plan to develop and launch their cansat in 2 to 3 years, but there are some projects that have 9 and 16 years of development. Unfortunately the average time is still bigger than 6 years. Which means Brazil will not, in a near future, produce cubesats with average time of the international market. Analyzing the payload promised on the future missions, it is notable that the focus on communication experiments decreased, and now, the missions are focusing on scientific experimentation, which makes sense since most of them are made in universities, and they are also focusing on some commercial usages. For example, the VCUB project aims at the Earth Observation market and will use a camera as the cubesat payload.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith all the analysis made, both for the past and for the future missions, it’s visible that Brazil’s Small Satellites are evolving. Demographically speaking, the production is spreading to other regions of the country, which is a good step to build a solid space market. From the view of development time, the number of missions that are in line with the average production time of the international market increased significantly, so it is possible to assume that Brazil’s production maturity has increased, even though it doesn't have its own launch vehicle. This assumption is reinforced when it takes on account the future missions payload analysis, since it shows that the cubesat production is aiming either on scientific advances or on commercial production.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was only made possible by an individual initiative of four people, students of aerospace engineering, who see the possibility of boosting the Brazilian aerospace market, which is already an international reference. We should be grateful for the performance of fellow participants throughout the work, the University of Brasilia which provided experience within academia, and the Brazilian Space Agency that generated the knowledge we need to be presenting the work.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nReferences"
