The ST200, developed by AAC Hyperion, is one of the world’s smallest and lightest fully autonomous, low power star trackers, aimed at applications in pico- and nano-satellite platforms\n\nWith an accuracy of 30 arcseconds and its extremely small size the ST200 can be used in practically every platform that requires attitude determination.\n\nThe ST200 is also suitable for applications on CubeSats as well as larger satellite platforms. For these applications, additional interfaces and power supply ranges are available. Optionally AAC Clyde Space offers standard size and mission-specific baffles.\n\nThe ST200 was co-developed by AAC Hyperion and Berlin Space Technologies.\n\nAccuracy\n\nWith an accuracy of 30 arcseconds (3-sigma) and its extremely small size the ST200 can be used in practically every platform that required attitude determination.\n\nDesign\n\nWith its plug-and-play design and various baffle options available on demand the ST200 is the perfect star tracker to seamlessly integrate with AAC Hyperion’s line of integrated attitude determination and control systems."
