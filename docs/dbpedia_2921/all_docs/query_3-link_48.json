        "text": "On this page\n\nCubeSats in a nutshell\n\nUsing CubeSats\n\nLaunching CubeSats in space\n\nThe benefits of using CubeSats\n\nWho uses CubeSats?\n\nLooking to the future\n\nCubeSats in a nutshell\n\nA CubeSat is a square-shaped miniature satellite (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm—roughly the size of a Rubik's cube), weighing about 1 kg. A CubeSat can be used alone (1 unit) or in groups of multiple units (maximum 24 units).\n\nUsing CubeSats\n\nFour types of CubeSat missions Type of mission Description Example\n\nThings CubeSats have in common\n\nJust like any satellite, CubeSats are custom built to the specific requirements of their mission and have at least three things in common:\n\nThe antenna and radio communication system, which sends and receives information to and from Earth.\n\nThe power source, like a solar panel or simply a battery.\n\nThe computer, which executes instructions to ensure proper functioning of the satellite.\n\nThe main cubic structure is made of aluminum and serves to hold the above components along with others such as cameras, sensors or scientific payloads. In addition, antennas and solar panels can be installed on the exterior of the structure.\n\nLaunching CubeSats in space\n\nTo be launched into space, CubeSats hitch a ride into space using extra space available on rockets. They are packed in a container which, with the push of a button, activates a spring that ejects the CubeSats into space. CubeSats can also be deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) by using the same technique from the airlock in the Japanese module. Like other satellites, they can be flown alone or in a constellation network, in orbit around the Earth.\n\nWhy size matters\n\nArtificial satellites come in a variety of sizes ranging from one you can hold in your hand to the size of a school bus: small satellites, nano satellites, miniature satellites, traditional satellites. Their dimension and costs are mostly determined by the complexity and type of their instruments (commonly known as payloads). In recent years, thanks to the miniaturization of space technologies, satellites have become smaller for a number of reasons, the first being the cost associated with assembly and launch.\n\nThe benefits of using CubeSats\n\nPros\n\nFast: can be built within two years\n\nCost: far less expensive than large satellites\n\nTechnology: simple, standard parts available off-the-shelf\n\nDesign: simple design for short mission; no need to use thermal blankets\n\nSpace debris: none – they burn up in the atmosphere upon re-entry\n\nCons\n\nScope: limited due to reduced capacity to carry scientific instruments\n\nMission duration: most of them are operational for a period of 3 to 12 months\n\nWho uses CubeSats?\n\nCubeSat rapidly expanded beyond educational purposes and created its own niche with government, industry and academia, who are collaborating to increase its technological capabilities.\n\nSchools\n\nCubeSats do the following:\n\nGive students experience in developing flight hardware and conducting space missions.\n\nAssist professors and faculties in preparing Canada's next-generation skilled workforce.\n\nGovernment and industry\n\nCubeSats are a game changer; labelled as faster, smaller, smarter and cheaper, they are valuable to government and industry for:\n\nProviding a platform for low-cost technology development and scientific research\n\nEnabling the acceleration of flight-qualified technology\n\nGenerating innovative public-private partnerships\n\nOffering opportunities to develop the expertise and skills required for careers in the space sector\n\nLooking to the future\n\nCubeSats are revolutionizing access to space: developers and users are eagerly taking advantage of this new platform to increase research and development activities conducted in space.\n\nCubeSats are even being used for interplanetary missions: NASA's Mars Cube One (MarCO) will embark on a mission to Mars in May 2018. CubeSats will offer an experimental communications service relaying information to Earth during atmospheric entry and landing.\n\nExplore further"
