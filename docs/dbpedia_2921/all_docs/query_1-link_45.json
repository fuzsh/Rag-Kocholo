        "text": "Description\n\nThe ISISPACE CubeSat Antenna System 1U/3U contains up to four tape spring antennas of up to 55 cm length. The deployment system relies on a thermal knife composed of one wire and two redundant heating elements per tape. RF phasing / BalUn circuitry ties the antennas together in the user-defined configuration.\n\nDepending on the configuration, one or two radios in the CubeSat can connect to the antenna system by means of miniature RF connectors. The top face of the antenna system can accommodate a two solar cell solar panel and it can be customized for accommodating sensors or other systems to protrude to the exterior, e.g. camera apertures.\n\nThe antenna is compatible with any UHF and/or VHF radio system. It can be mounted on all ISIS CubeSat structures and Pumpkin rev C and rev D CubeSat structures. For custom made structures, which adhere to the CubeSat standard mechanical envelope, mounting should also be possible.\n\nSpecifications\n\nMass: < 100g Envelope stowed (l x w x h): 98x98x7mm (supplied aluminium cover plate included) Power consumption: Nominal: < 40 mW (3V3 model) Nominal: < 60 mW (5V model) During deployment: 2W Interfaces: Electrical: Miniature 9 pin OMNETICS connector Data: I2C Other protocol on demand Frequency Range: >10MHz useable bandwidth in frequency range specified Antenna Return Loss at resonance frequency: > 10 db (VSWR < 2:1) Operational temperature range: -20°C to +60°C Antenna main beam gain: UHF: 0 dBi VHF: 0 dBi Max RF Power: 2W Bandwidth: UHF: >50 Mhz (-10db bandwidth) VHF: >10 Mhz (-10db bandwidth) Antenna element deployment duration: <3s above 15°C operating temperature\n\nIn the box:\n\nAntenna system\n\nRF harness\n\nRefurbishment kit for flight preparation\n\nDocumentation: user manual, test and build reports\n\nFAQ:\n\nFor which frequency is the deployable antenna suitable?\n\nThe ISISPACE Antenna System frequency range is between 100MHz and 500MHz.\n\nCan the antenna be mounted on the side face of the CubeSat?\n\nIt is not possible to mount the ISISPACE Antenna System on the side. The system can be mounted on the top, bottom, or in between stacks of the CubeSat."
