        "text": "Reading Time: 15 minutes\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we live and interact with the world around us. With the increasing demand for global connectivity, satellites play a crucial role in expanding the reach of IoT devices. In this article, we will explore the evolution of communication technology and the role of satellites in IoT, including the development of CubeSats and Swarm startup.\n\n‚ÄúThe primary challenge stems from the nature of CubeSats themselves. Historically, they‚Äôve been seen not as commercial opportunities, but as academic playthings ‚Äì tools for scientists, students, and amateur radio enthusiasts. However, Swarm represents a pioneering venture. It‚Äôs arguably the first enterprise to successfully harness CubeSats for commercial use. Within certain sectors, this is being hailed as nothing short of a revolution‚Äù\n\n¬© Maxim Diatel. Senior SWE. Sirin Software.\n\nThe Evolution of Communication\n\nThe progression of communication methods has led to the crucial role of satellite communication in today‚Äôs interconnected world. It supports vital functions like worldwide navigation, meteorological predictions, and crisis response. Satellites offer the unparalleled ability to span extensive territories and facilitate communication in isolated areas that land-based systems cannot access. Let‚Äôs remember how it was.\n\nClassic Radio Point-to-Point\n\nEarly communication systems relied on direct radio transmissions between two points. These point-to-point systems were limited by the range of the transmitter and the receiver, often requiring line-of-sight for successful communication. As a result, the reach of these systems was restricted, and communication over long distances was challenging.\n\nRepeaters\n\nTo extend the range of radio communication, repeaters were introduced. These devices received a radio signal, amplify it, and retransmit it to another receiver. By placing repeaters at strategic locations, communication networks could be extended over much larger distances. This development allowed for improved communication and information exchange over vast areas, connecting people and communities that were previously isolated.\n\nHam Satellites\n\nAmateur radio operators, or ‚Äúham‚Äù radio enthusiasts, realized the potential of placing repeaters in space, leading to the development of ham satellites. By placing a repeater on a satellite, signals could be relayed over much greater distances, even between continents. This innovation greatly expanded the reach of radio communication and enabled radio operators to communicate with others around the world.\n\nBBS Early Mail Satellites\n\nBulletin Board Systems (BBS) were early online communication systems that emerged in the late 1970s. Users could connect to a central server using a modem to exchange messages, share files, and play turn-based games. BBS paved the way for electronic mail services, which allowed users to send messages without a physical connection, marking the beginning of modern communication.\n\nDigital (Packet) Radio and PACSAT\n\nDigital packet radio was a communication technology that emerged in the early 1980s. It allowed for more efficient communication as it no longer required dedicated channels for each conversation. Instead, messages are divided into smaller packets that can be transmitted individually and reassembled at the receiving end. This development increased the capacity of radio systems and enabled more simultaneous connections, facilitating the growth of digital communication networks.\n\nPACSAT is an example of a digital ham satellite that supports digital packet radio. This technology allows for efficient data transmission without the need for dedicated channels. Packet radio satellite technology, utilized by PACSAT, enables radio operators to send and receive messages in small data packets. This method of communication is particularly useful when real-time communication is not possible due to distance or satellite limitations. Additionally, digital ham satellites like PACSAT contribute to the evolution of store-and-forward technology, further enhancing communication capabilities.\n\nCommercial communication satellites\n\nThese massive satellites carry intricate communication payloads, providing direct-to-home TV broadcasting, internet, phone services, and video conferencing for a 10-15 year lifespan. Launched via rockets, they use radio frequency (RF) waves to communicate with ground stations and other satellites. Examples include Intelsat and SES, global operators offering services worldwide. Inmarsat, a British firm, delivers global mobile satellite communications, while EchoStar caters to US customers with direct-to-home TV broadcasting. Commercial communication satellites often struggle to accommodate IoT applications due to elevated per-connection costs, limited scalability, and reduced integration choices. Still, many operators plan to enter the IoT market, even though traditionally these commercial satellites focused on voice data transmission rather than the short data bursts typical of IoT devices.\n\nCubeSats and Swarm Startup\n\nAs satellite communication technology advanced, the demand for affordable and efficient methods to explore space, conduct scientific research, and deliver satellite services to businesses and commercial entities increased. This led to the conception of compact, modular satellites. Proving to be precisely such a solution, CubeSats have significantly transformed the satellite industry by lowering entry barriers and promoting innovation, ultimately broadening the scope of space exploration opportunities.\n\nWhat is CubeSat\n\nCubeSats are small, standardized satellites that are revolutionizing the space industry by enabling cost-effective access to space for various applications, including IoT. Built using a modular design, CubeSats typically come in units of 10x10x10 cm (1U) and can be combined to create larger sizes (e.g., 2U, 3U, or 6U). This standard was developed in 1999 to make satellite technology more accessible to a wider range of users. CubeSats are built using off-the-shelf components, can be designed at a fraction of the cost of traditional satellites, and launched as secondary payloads on larger rockets, making them a cost-effective way to test new technologies in space. By leveraging store-and-forward technology*, CubeSat enables integration with local or cloud-based IoT projects, offering a reliable and efficient communication solution for the Internet of Things.\n\n* Store-and-forward technology allows data to be transmitted in chunks when real-time communication is not feasible due to distance or satellite limitations. By storing the data on the satellite and forwarding it when the destination is within range, it ensures that information reaches its intended recipient even in remote areas.\n\nStructure\n\nCubeSat structures are carefully crafted to balance strength and weight. By using lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber composites, these small satellites retain durability while reducing mass. Lower mass is crucial, as it directly influences the cost of launching satellites into space.\n\nAluminum is a commonly used material in CubeSat structures due to its remarkable strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures in harsh space environment.\n\nCarbon fiber composites are well-suited for CubeSat applications because they offer an exceptional combination of stiffness, strength, and low weight, all while maintaining excellent thermal and electrical insulation properties.\n\nMaterial selection and CubeSat structure design significantly impact the satellite‚Äôs performance, influencing payload capacity, maneuverability, and resilience to harsh space conditions. Engineers commonly use advanced methods like computer-aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) to optimize the structure, ensuring it endures the forces and stresses during launch and orbital operation.\n\nPower Systems\n\nCubeSats rely on efficient, dependable power systems for onboard computing, communication, and payload operations. Solar panels and batteries provide a stable energy supply throughout the mission.\n\nSolar Panels: CubeSats use exterior-mounted solar panels with photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity. The panels‚Äô size, type, and arrangement are optimized, considering factors like orientation, mission duration, and onboard power requirements.\n\nBatteries: Rechargeable batteries store electricity generated by solar panels, ensuring continuous satellite operation during eclipses. Battery choice is vital, considering weight, size, energy density, efficiency, and lifespan. Common types include lithium-ion, lithium-polymer, and LiFePO4 batteries.\n\nEnergy Management: CubeSat power systems feature components that regulate energy flow between solar panels, batteries, and onboard systems. They manage battery charging and discharging, distribute power, and monitor consumption for efficient energy utilization. The system may also include maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for solar panel optimization and fault protection mechanisms.\n\nCommunication systems\n\nIoT devices can use a variety of communication solutions to exchange data with CubeSat satellites, depending on their constellation standards, mission objectives, and requirements. M138, LoRa, and Astronode in cooperation with RISC-V embedded processors and MCU-based controllers, are the most popular and scalable choices for IoT applications, so let us look at them a bit closer.\n\nM138:\n\nThe M138 is a compact, energy-efficient transceiver specifically designed as the sole official modem for SpaceX Swarm communication. It operates in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, offering diverse communication possibilities. Depending on the frequency band and modulation, it supports data rates up to several Mbps. The transceiver can employ modulation schemes such as BPSK, QPSK, or GMSK to optimize communication. Its low-power design makes it ideal for CubeSat applications and power-saving IoT communication.\n\nLoRa:\n\nLoRa is a type of LPWAN technology that enables long-range communication and low data rate transmission. It is a good choice for certain IoT applications in CubeSats due to its low power consumption and ability to penetrate obstacles. LoRa operates on license-free ISM bands such as 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in North America. It offers low data rates from 300 bps to 50 kbps, which is well-suited for IoT applications with limited data transmission requirements. LoRa is capable of long-range communication, up to several kilometers or more, depending on factors such as antenna design and environmental conditions. Additionally, it is highly energy-efficient, enabling extended battery life for IoT devices and reduced operational costs.\n\nAstronode:\n\nThe Astronode is a compact SDR for the AstroCast network, designed for the AstroCast CubeSat constellation. The network offers an alternative to Swarm for efficient communication solutions in the satellite industry. It supports UHF, S-band, and X-band frequency bands, and offers BPSK, QPSK, and GMSK modulation options. The Astronode can handle data rates from a few kbps to tens of Mbps, catering to different IoT applications. The Astronode‚Äôs SDR architecture allows on-the-fly reconfiguration, making it highly flexible for changing mission requirements.\n\nEmbedded RISC-V Solutions\n\nRISC-V processors are gaining traction in satellite communication systems due to their flexible, open-source, and modular architecture. For instance, the University of Maribor in Slovenia, in collaboration with CERN and SkyLabs, developed the Trisat-R nanosatellite to measure ionizing radiation in medium earth orbit (MEO). The onboard NANOhpm computer uses a fault-tolerant RISC-V processor, showcasing the adaptability and resilience of RISC-V in space applications.\n\nCanadian company SpaceBridge created an advanced satellite access technology (ASAT) System on a Chip (SoC) for next-generation Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) products, using a RISC-V processor to manage communication between ground equipment and satellites. This allows SpaceBridge to develop customizable, efficient devices with higher throughput and improved latency compared to traditional systems.\n\nMCU-based controllers\n\nMicrocontroller units (MCUs) are integrated circuits designed for embedded applications. They are popular due to their energy efficiency, affordability, and user-friendly nature, making them suitable for many industries. MCUs are also often used in home automation, vehicle systems, and IoT devices to perform specific functions in real time.\n\nWhat is Swarm Startup\n\nSwarm Technologies, also known as Swarm, is a startup company that utilizes CubeSat technology to provide IoT communication services by transmitting data between remote devices and ground stations. The company was founded in 2016 by a team of former NASA and Google engineers, headquartered in Silicon Valley, and was acquired by SpaceX in 2021.\n\nSwarm Network in Urban Environment\n\nWhen it comes to urban environments, the utilization of SWARM satellites can vary considerably compared to their application in rural areas. The typical spectrum in an urban environment is a complex and crowded space. With a multitude of signals from various sources, creating a robust solution for urban applications is not a simple task.\n\nChallenges\n\nInterference with VHF Radio\n\nSwarm proposes to operate its satellites using frequencies in portions of the 137-138 MHz (space-to-Earth) and 148-149.95 MHz (Earth-to-space) bands. These frequency bands fall within the VHF (Very High Frequency) range, commonly used for FM radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, two-way land mobile radio systems, long-range data communication, and marine communications., which can lead to interference.\n\nThe Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) at 144Mhz in a city\n\nSensitivity to Noise Factor\n\nTechnically, the noise floor is a measurement of the sum of all noise sources and undesired signals within a particular system. Given the high noise floor typically associated with urban environments, (-95 dBm in Europe), the SWARM network‚Äôs sensitivity could lead to performance degradation.\n\nThe typical spectrum in the city\n\nAn elevated noise floor implies a greater presence of unwanted signals, which makes it harder for a receiver to discern the intended signal amidst the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù. This is especially crucial for SWARM‚Äôs link budget, a comprehensive calculation of all gains and losses from the transmitter to the receiver. A high noise floor could mean a weaker Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), a poorer Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and a potentially less reliable connection overall.\n\nSolutions\n\nUse of Bandpass Filters\n\nIn their functioning, bandpass filters enable specific frequencies within a set spectrum to go through while lessening or blocking frequencies outside this limit. Their frequency-specific nature greatly minimizes interference from devices sharing overlapping frequency zones. Using these filters for the SWARM network notably cuts down the interference from VHF radios and other devices using the same frequency spectrum as the SWARM modem. Therefore, these filters help establish a communication channel that‚Äôs neater and more robust against interference, supporting the smooth operation of the SWARM network\n\nCustom Antennas\n\nCustom antennas enhance SWARM network performance in urban environments. Tailored to specific frequency ranges and environments, they optimize efficiency. Despite larger sizes due to accommodating the 2-meter signal wavelength, custom antennas can be engineered for optimal performance. Leveraging design principles like effective aperture, polarization, and impedance matching, could significantly improve signal reception and transmission, overcoming noise and interference challenges.\n\nSpaceX Starlink\n\nSpaceX Starlink is a satellite-based internet service that has been developed to provide global internet coverage to underserved areas using a constellation of thousands of small satellites in low Earth orbit. Starlink satellites are closer to Earth than traditional communication satellites, providing lower latency, faster speeds, and better coverage. As of February 2023, Starlink consists of over 3,580 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit, which communicate with designated ground transceivers. In total, nearly 12,000 satellites are planned to be deployed, with a possible later extension to 42,000. Starlink is designed to provide internet access to remote locations, areas affected by natural disasters, and developing countries. The service uses a phased array antenna to track and communicate with the satellites as they move across the sky. Starlink is still in beta testing and costs $110 ‚Äì $500 per month with an additional one-time equipment fee for each distant located point.\n\nSwarm and Starlink in IoT\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of various physical devices and systems through the Internet. These devices can range from simple sensors and actuators to complex machines and appliances, and they can be used in various applications, including healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing.\n\nSwarm and Starlink represent different approaches to IoT connectivity, and their suitability depends on various factors such as the nature and scale of the IoT application, the cost and availability of hardware and services, the regulatory and environmental constraints, and the level of connectivity required.
