Introduction

CubeSats, the miniature satellites that have revolutionized space research and exploration, are composed of several subsystems. Each subsystem has its own complexity, cost, and testing factors. This article provides a detailed overview of the subsystems of a CubeSat and discusses these factors.

CubeSat Subsystems

1. Communication Subsystem

The communication subsystem is the CubeSat’s lifeline, enabling it to transmit and receive data between the satellite and the ground station. It typically includes antennas, transceivers, and sometimes amplifiers. The complexity of this subsystem depends on the frequency band used (UHF, VHF, S-band, etc.), the data rate, and the communication protocol. The antennas must be designed to operate at the chosen frequency, and the transceiver must be capable of handling the data rate. The communication protocol must be robust enough to handle the lossy and delay-prone nature of space communication. The cost can vary widely depending on these factors, and the specific components used. Testing involves checking the performance of the subsystem in various conditions, including different temperatures and radiation levels. It also includes testing the subsystem’s ability to handle data errors and losses.

2. Power Subsystem

The power subsystem is the heart of the CubeSat, providing power to all other subsystems. It includes solar panels, batteries, and power management circuits. The complexity of this subsystem depends on the power requirements of the CubeSat and the efficiency of the solar panels and batteries. The solar panels must be designed to generate enough power for the CubeSat’s operations, and the batteries must be capable of storing enough power for when the CubeSat is in the Earth’s shadow. The power management circuit must efficiently distribute power to all subsystems and manage charging and discharging of the batteries. The cost is relatively high due to the need for efficient and reliable components. Testing involves checking the performance of the subsystem under different light conditions and temperatures. It also includes testing the subsystem’s ability to handle power surges and shortages.

3. On-Board Computer (OBC)

The OBC is the brain of the CubeSat, controlling the operations of the satellite. It processes data from other subsystems, executes commands, and manages the overall functioning of the CubeSat. The complexity of the OBC depends on the tasks it needs to perform. More complex missions require more powerful and complex OBCs. The OBC must be capable of handling the data processing requirements of the mission, and it must be robust enough to handle the harsh conditions of space. The cost can vary widely depending on the complexity of the OBC. Testing involves checking the performance of the OBC under different conditions, including different temperatures and radiation levels. It also includes testing the OBC’s ability to handle software errors and hardware failures.

4. Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)

The ADCS is responsible for determining and controlling the orientation of the CubeSat. It uses sensors to determine the CubeSat’s orientation and actuators to adjust it. The complexity of the ADCS depends on the accuracy required for the mission. Some missions require precise pointing, which requires a more complex ADCS. The sensors must be accurate enough to determine the CubeSat’s orientation, and the actuators must be capable of adjusting the orientation to the required accuracy. The cost can be high for CubeSats that require precise pointing. Testing involves checking the performance of the ADCS under different conditions, including different temperatures and radiation levels. It also includes testing the ADCS’s ability to handle sensor errors and actuator failures.

5. Payload

The payload is the mission-specific equipment carried by the CubeSat. It can include cameras, sensors, or other scientific instruments. The complexity of the payload depends on the specific mission requirements. For instance, a CubeSat designed for Earth observation might carry a high-resolution camera, while a CubeSat designed for scientific research might carry a spectrometer or other scientific instruments. The payload must be designed to meet the mission requirements, and it must be robust enough to handle the harsh conditions of space. The cost of the payload can be significant, especially for scientific instruments. Testing involves checking the performance of the payload under different conditions, including different temperatures and radiation levels. It also includes testing the payload’s ability to handle data errors and hardware failures.

6. Proof of Life Beacon

The proof of life beacon is a subsystem that sends signals to confirm that the CubeSat is operational. This subsystem is relatively simple, but it must be reliable. The beacon sends a simple signal, such as a ping, at regular intervals to confirm that the CubeSat is still operational. The cost is relatively low. Testing involves checking the reliability of the beacon under different conditions. It also includes testing the beacon’s ability to handle signal losses and errors.

7. Solar Panels

Solar panels are part of the power subsystem and are responsible for generating power for the CubeSat. They convert sunlight into electricity, which is then used to power the CubeSat’s subsystems. The complexity of the solar panels depends on the power requirements of the CubeSat and the efficiency of the solar panels. The solar panels must be designed to generate enough power for the CubeSat’s operations, and they must be robust enough to handle the harsh conditions of space. The cost can be significant, especially for high-efficiency solar panels. Testing involves checking the performance of the solar panels under different light conditions and temperatures. It also includes testing the solar panels’ ability to handle power surges and shortages.

8. Battery Board

The battery board is a crucial part of the power subsystem. It is responsible for storing the electrical energy generated by the solar panels and supplying it to the CubeSat’s subsystems when needed. The complexity of the battery board depends on the power requirements of the CubeSat and the efficiency of the batteries. The battery board must be designed to store enough power for the CubeSat’s operations, especially during the periods when the CubeSat is in the Earth’s shadow and the solar panels cannot generate power. It must also include protection circuits to prevent overcharging and overdischarging of the batteries. The cost of the battery board can be significant, especially if high-capacity or high-efficiency batteries are used. The cost also includes the cost of the protection circuits and the battery management system. Testing of the battery board involves checking its performance under different conditions, including different charge and discharge rates, and different temperatures. It also includes testing the performance of the protection circuits and the battery management system. The battery board must also be tested for its ability to handle power surges and shortages.

9. Antenna Deployment Mechanism

The antenna deployment mechanism is responsible for deploying the antenna after the CubeSat is in orbit. This subsystem is crucial for ensuring that the CubeSat can communicate with the ground station. The complexity of this subsystem depends on the design of the antenna and the deployment mechanism. The antenna must be designed to operate at the chosen frequency, and the deployment mechanism must be reliable enough to deploy the antenna once the CubeSat is in orbit. The cost can vary depending on the complexity of the mechanism. Testing involves checking the reliability of the deployment mechanism under different conditions. It also includes testing the mechanism’s ability to handle deployment failures.

10. Structural Subsystem

The structural subsystem is the framework that houses and protects all other subsystems of the CubeSat. It must be robust enough to withstand the intense vibrations during launch and the harsh conditions of space, while also being lightweight to minimize launch costs.

Complexity: The complexity of the structural subsystem depends on the size of the CubeSat (1U, 2U, 3U, etc.), the requirements of the other subsystems, and the mission requirements. For instance, some missions might require deployable structures, which would increase the complexity of the structural subsystem. The cost of the structural subsystem can vary widely depending on the materials used and the complexity of the design. High-strength, lightweight materials like aluminum alloys and carbon fiber composites are commonly used, but they can be expensive. Testing of the structural subsystem involves subjecting it to the conditions it will experience during launch and in space. This includes vibration testing to simulate the launch conditions and thermal vacuum testing to simulate the space environment. The structural subsystem must also be tested for compatibility with the launch vehicle.

Summary

CubeSats, small and cost-effective satellites, have revolutionized the space industry. They are composed of several subsystems, each with its own complexity, cost, and testing factors. These subsystems include the communication subsystem, power subsystem, on-board computer (OBC), attitude determination and control system (ADCS), payload, proof of life beacon, solar panels, antenna deployment mechanism, and structural subsystem.

The complexity of these subsystems depends on the mission requirements, and the cost can vary widely based on the complexity and the specific components used. Before launch, CubeSats must undergo rigorous testing to ensure they can withstand the harsh conditions of space and perform their mission successfully. This includes vibration testing, thermal vacuum testing, functional testing, performance testing, endurance testing, and software testing.

Despite the challenges associated with their complexity, cost, and testing, CubeSats provide an affordable and accessible platform for space research and exploration.
