        "text": "My Name Is New York (Audiobook) by Nora Guthrie & Woody Guthrie\n\n3-CD SET INCLUDES:\n\n2-CD AUDIO TOUR – 19 tracks highlighting significant locations where Woody Guthrie lived and wrote. A historic audio tour told by those who knew him best.\n\nwith PETE SEEGER\n\nARLO GUTHRIE\n\nRAMBLIN’ JACK ELLIOTT\n\nBOB DYLAN\n\nand many more\n\nAND\n\nTHE SONGS CD - 16 Woody Guthrie NYC songs + new releases\n\nWritten and Narrated by Nora Guthrie\n\nWOODY GUTHRIE lived in New York City from 1940-1967, a total of 27 years. Although he continued to ramble, New York was the city he called home, and always returned to. With friends Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and others, he was at the hub of a new movement – introducing and popularizing rural, roots, topical, and protest music to modern urban audiences.\n\nTHIS LAND IS YOUR LAND was written at a small boarding house on 43rd Street. His autobiography BOUND FOR GLORY and many of his most popular songs were written in various locations around town; JESUS CHRIST, TOM JOAD, VIGILANTE MAN, and RIDING IN MY CAR are among the 600 songs he composed here.\n\nNow, for the first time, you'll actually be able to hear these stories told by those who knew him best, in many different ways and through various encounters and circumstances; music partners Pete Seeger, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sonny Terry, and Bess Lomax Hawes, Woody's first wife Mary Guthrie, Woody's merchant marine buddy Jimmy Longhi, Bob Dylan, Woody's second wife Marjorie Guthrie, Arlo Guthrie, Nora Guthrie and many others share their memories with you first-hand.\n\nWith this new audio tour, we invite you to walk the streets, ride the buses and subways, or sit down and relax on some of the stoops, park benches, or beaches where Woody Guthrie did – always strumming away on his guitar, always working on a new song.\n\n\"All you can write is what you see\" – Woody Guthrie\n\n~ July 14, 2014 ~\n\n'MY NAME IS NEW YORK' DELUXE COLLECTION CELEBRATES WOODY GUTHRIE'S NEW YORK WITH AUDIO TOUR, UNRELEASED SONGS, NEVER-SEEN ARTIFACTS AND MORE\n\nThree-disc set features new interviews with\n\nPete Seeger, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Arlo Guthrie, Woody's friends and family\n\nWhat some people know about Woody Guthrie is filtered through a reputation as America’s wandering folk singer, but for 27 years New York City was the place he called home. His career is almost inseparable from the city: Woody Guthrie wrote over 600 songs here - including \"This Land Is Your Land,\" \"Tom Joad,\" and \"Hard Travelin'\" - and raised his family in a variety of locations around Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn.\n\nTo celebrate the indelible influence this city had on Woody’s career, on September 23 Woody Guthrie Publications is releasing ‘My Name Is New York; Ramblin’ Around Woody Guthrie’s Town’ a three-disc collection that offers an intimate portrait of Woody's NYC life through storytelling and music. Produced by Steve Rosenthal, Michael Kleff and Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie, ‘My Name is New York’ presents two discs of an audio tour and stories that contextualize Woody's New York with new interviews, song snippets and a history narrated by Nora, plus a third disc of music, including some never heard before.\n\n“Working on this project has been more than just a nostalgic walk down memory lane,\" Nora says. \"It’s been a precious adventure, collecting the stories – and the voices - of my father’s NYC friends and family, many of them who are now gone. It’s been, at times, both a hilarious and tearful journey. And, just as for thousands of artists who have migrated here, you can see how New York City was absolutely critical in significantly chiseling my father’s destiny.”\n\nFeaturing new interviews with luminaries like Pete Seeger (in one of his final interviews), Woody’s son Arlo Guthrie, and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, as well as with Woody’s many other friends and family, the first two discs take listeners on a virtual tour of the city as Woody experienced it through visits to 19 locations. They include the boarding house on 43rd Street where “This Land Is Your Land” was written; the Greenwich Village apartment that The Almanac Singers — an all-star folk collective included Guthrie, Seeger, Lead Belly and Josh White - called home; and his home on Coney Island, where Woody tirelessly composed over 100 songs, and was eventually laid to rest.\n\nThe collection also includes a bonus music disc featuring an array of Guthrie’s NYC songs, including the first recording of “This Land Is Your Land\"; two previously unreleased home demos he recorded in the city, including the song that gave the set its name and a duet with Sonny Terry; and five premieres of previously unpublished lyrics from a variety of artists, from contemporaries to younger musicians following in his tradition.\n\n'My Name Is New York' Track List\n\nDisc 1: February 16, 1940 — November 1942\n\n01. 59th Street at 5th Avenue, Manhattan\n\n02. 101 West 43rd Street, Manhattan\n\n03. 57 East 4th Street, Manhattan\n\n04. 31 East 21st Street, Manhattan\n\n05. 5 West 101st Street, Manhattan\n\n06. 70 East 12th Street, Manhattan\n\n07. 130 West 10th Street, Manhattan\n\n08. 430 6th Avenue, Manhattan\n\n09. 148 West 14th Street, Manhattan\n\n10. 647 Hudson Street, Manhattan\n\nDisc 2: December, 1942 — October 3, 1967\n\n01. 74 Charles Street, Manhattan\n\n02. 3815 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn\n\n03. 3520 Mermaid Avenue, Brooklyn\n\n04. 49 Murdock Court, Brooklyn\n\n05. 517 East 5th Street, Manhattan\n\n06.
