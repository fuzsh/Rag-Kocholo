        "text": "(1912–67). The most famous of the more than 1,000 songs that Woody Guthrie wrote is “This Land Is Your Land,” a composition taken up as an anthem by the civil rights and anti–Vietnam War movements of the 1960s. By the time of his early death, Guthrie had become the most legendary of modern American folksingers. His son Arlo and associates such as Pete Seeger helped keep his music and memory alive.\n\nWoodrow Wilson Guthrie was born in Okemah, Oklahoma, on July 14, 1912. His schooling ended in 10th grade, and he left home at 15 to wander the country by freight train. Carrying with him his guitar and harmonica, Guthrie became a welcome figure in the hobo and migrant camps of the Great Depression of the 1930s. He was close to the struggles of the common people, and their experiences were reflected in his songs. He became a musical spokesman for working people in songs such as “So Long (It’s Been Good to Know Yuh),” “Hard Traveling,” “Blowing Down this Old Dusty Road”, “Union Maid,” and “Tom Joad” (inspired by John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath).\n\nIn New York City he joined Pete Seeger and others in the Almanac Singers, who performed mostly for farmer and worker groups. After service in the Merchant Marine during World War II, he returned to the group and wrote a series of songs and sketches entitled American Folksongs. The last years of his life were spent in a New York hospital fighting Huntington’s chorea, a disease of the nervous system that took his life on October 3, 1967."
