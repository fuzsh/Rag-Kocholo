        "text": "It wasn't the first time Woody Guthrie's family had traveled to Oklahoma. But the July 1971 visit was special as it would be the famous folk singer's birthday, and the family had arrived for a concert that would benefit research for Huntington's disease.\n\nWoody Guthrie, born July 14, 1912, in Okemah, had died from Huntington's disease less than three years earlier in October 1967.\n\nGuthrie's son, Arlo, and Arlo's mother, Marjorie Guthrie, arrived in Okemah on the eve of the singer/songwriter's birthday. Also accompanying Arlo was his wife, Jackie, and their son, Abraham.\n\nIn a July 14, 1971, story in The Daily Oklahoman, Marjorie Guthrie spoke during a news conference:\n\n\"We have come because we were invited. And we're very pleased to come because there are a lot of people here who want to celebrate Woody's birthday.\"\n\nMore: Woody Guthrie Folk Festival draws musicians and fans back to folk icon's Oklahoma hometown\n\nIt became clear that some were not so pleased with talk of a celebration, though Marjorie had hopes of convincing them otherwise, as reported in the news story:\n\nNot everyone in Okemah wants to celebrate his birthday anniversary. The Okemah Chamber of Commerce decided it would not promote a special day in his memory.\n\nMrs. Guthrie has hopes of changing the minds of those Okemah citizens ― and others — who have branded Guthrie a Communist.\n\nWoody Guthrie is probably best known by many for his song \"This Land Is Your Land,\" which has been sung by many an elementary school student, who also might have sung his \"Crawdad Song.\" But his song lyrics and outspokenness against oppression soon earned him the communist label.\n\nWhen Arlo was asked in 1971 what he thought about the label placed on his father, he reportedly shrugged his shoulders and said, \"That's fine. It's better than nobody being interested.\"\n\nMore than 50 years have passed since the family's visit to Okemah. Recognition of the city's native son is no longer an issue as evident in The Woody Guthrie Festival which is held annually and called WoodyFest. The event was planned this year for July 10-14, which coincides with Woody's birthday."
