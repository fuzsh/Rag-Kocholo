        "text": "Woodrow Wilson Guthrie (14 July 1912 – 3 October 1967) was a prolific American folk musician, most famous for his song \"This Land Is Your Land\" (1940).\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThis song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright #154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ours, cause we don't give a darn.

QUoted in Kinney, David (2014). The Dylanologists: Adventures in the Land of Bob. Simon and Schuster. p. 40.

Just protect my own inner brain, my own mind and heart, by drawing it up into a hard knot, and not having any more hopes or dreams at all. Pull in my feelings, and call back all of my sentiments — and not let any earthly event move me in either direction, either cause me to hate, to fear, to love, to care, to take sides, to argue the matter at all — and, yet … there are certain good times, and pleasures that I never can forget, no matter how much I want to, because the pleasures, and the displeasures, the good times and the bad, are really all there is to me.\n\nAnd these pleasures that you cannot ever forget are the yeast that always starts working in your mind again, and it gets in your thoughts again, and in your eyes again, and then, all at once, no matter what has happened to you, you are building a brand new world again, based and built on the mistakes, the wreck, the hard luck and trouble of the old one.\n\n\"Notes about Music\" (29 March 1946) also quoted in A Race of Singers: Whitman's Working-Class Hero from Guthrie to Springsteen (2000) by Bryan K. Garman, p. 244\n\nNo matter how bad the wicked world has hurt you, in the long run, there is something gained, and it is all for the best … The note of hope is the only note that can help us or save us from falling to the bottom of the heap of evolution, because, largely, about all a human being is, anyway, is just a hoping machine, a working machine, and any song that says, the pleasures I have seen in all of my trouble, are the things I never can get — don't worry — the human race will sing this way as long as there is a human to race.\n\nThe human race is a pretty old place.\n\n\"Notes about Music\" (29 March 1946) also quoted in Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie (2004) by Ed Cray\n\nLet me be known as just the man that told you something you already knew.\n\n\"Notes about Music\" (29 March 1946), quoted in \"Walt Whitman and Woody Guthrie : American Proghet-singers and their People\" in: Journal of American Studies (April 1990), p. 55\n\nOkemah was one of the singiest, square dancingest, drinkingest, yellingest, preachingest, walkingest, talkingest, laughingest, cryingest, shootingest, fist fightingest, bleedingest, gamblingest, gun, club and razor carryingest of our ranch towns and farm towns, because it blossomed out into one of our first Oil Boom Towns.\n\nPastures Of Plenty: A Self Portrait (1990), p. 3\n\nI ain't a communist necessarily, but I been in the red all my life.\n\nAs quoted in \"Woody Guthrie\" by Steve Earle in The Nation (21 July 2003)\n\nI hate a song that makes you think that you are not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim too ugly or too this or too that. Songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard traveling. … I am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood.\n\nI am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it has hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built, I am out to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work.\n\nAnd the songs that I sing are made up for the most part by all sorts of folks just about like you. I could hire out to the other side, the big money side, and get several dollars every week just to quit singing my own kind of songs and to sing the kind that knock you down still farther and the ones that poke fun at you even more and the ones that make you think you've not any sense at all. But I decided a long time ago that I'd starve to death before I'd sing any such songs as that. The radio waves and your movies and your jukeboxes and your songbooks are already loaded down and running over with such no good songs as that anyhow.\n\nStatement quoted in Prophet Singer: The Voice And Vision of Woody Guthrie (2007) by Mark Allan Jackson. There are a few slight variants of this statement, which seems to have originated in a performance monologue.\n\nThis Land Is Your Land (1940; 1944)\n\n[edit]\n\n\"This Land Is Your Land\" was written primarily on 23 February 1940 as \"God Blessed America\", but was not recorded until 1944, after the title and a few of the lyrics were altered. Significant variations exist among various published and recorded versions of the song. - Full lyrics at Wikisource\n\nThis land is your land, this land is my land\n\nFrom California to the New York Island\n\nFrom the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters\n\nThis land is made for you and me.\n\nAs I go walking this ribbon of highway\n\nI see above me the endless skyway\n\nAnd all around me the wind keeps saying:\n\nThis land is made for you and me.\n\nWhen the sun came shining as I was strolling,\n\nAnd the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,\n\nAs the fog was lifting a voice come chanting:\n\nThis land was made for you and me.\n\nThis is one of the more variable of the stanzas; other renditions include:\n\nWhere the wind is blowing I go a strolling\n\nThe wheat field waving and the dust clouds rolling\n\nThe fog is lifting and the wind is saying:\n\nThis land is made for you and me.\n\nThe sun comes shining as I was strolling,\n\nThe wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,\n\nThe fog was lifting as a voice come chanting:\n\nThis land was made for you and me.\n\nNobody living can ever stop me\n\nAs I go walking my freedom highway\n\nNobody living can make me turn back\n\nThis land was made for you and me.\n\nThe last line of this last stanza is also sometimes rendered \"This land is made for you and me.\"\n\nQuotes about This Land is Your Land\n\n[edit]\n\nThis Land is My Land (1993), a picture book written and illustrated by the Canadian Cree artist George Littlechild, ... refers to Woody Guthrie's Depression-era song, \"This Land Is Your Land,\" which is far from an unproblematic expression of patriotic love for country but (especially in its seldom-sung fourth and sixth verses) ironizes the line \"This land was made for you and me\" by pointing to distinctions between those who have access to the bounty of the land and those who do not. Through his intertextual reference to Woody Guthrie's song, Littlechild acknowledges traditions of resistance in white culture, even as he draws attention to the effects of colonization upon Native Americans.\n\nClare Bradford, Unsettling Narratives: Postcolonial Readings of Children’s Literature, p. 20\n\nBiggest Thing That Man Has Ever Done\n\n[edit]\n\nAlso known as \"The Great Historical Bum\" · Full text online\n\nI'm just a lonesome traveler, The Great Historical Bum.\n\nHighly educated from history I have come.\n\nI built the Rock of Ages, 'twas in the Year of One\n\nAnd that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done.\n\nI worked in the Garden of Eden, that was the year of two,\n\nJoined the apple pickers union, I always paid my due;\n\nI'm the man that signed the contract to raise the rising sun,\n\nAnd that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done\n\nI'd better quit my talking, 'cause I told you all I know,\n\nBut please remember, pardner, wherever you may go,\n\nThe people are building a peaceful world, and when the job is done\n\nThat'll be the biggest thing that man has ever done.\n\nVariant: The world is digging, slavery's grave and when the job is done\n\nThis'll be the biggest thing that man has ever done.\n\nI better quit my talking now; I told you all I know,\n\nBut please remember, pardner, wherever you may go,\n\nI'm older than your old folks, and I'm younger than the young,\n\nAnd I'm about the biggest thing that man has ever done.\n\nQuotes about Guthrie\n\n[edit]\n\nSorted alphabetically by author or source\n\nAs I drove across the New Mexico Painted Desert, I found myself singing softly, \"This land is your land, this land is my land...,\" the Woody Guthrie alternative anthem that was enjoying a revived popularity. It made me think, no, this is not your land. I was driving through the Navajo Nation as a guest, not an owner. I wondered how the Navajos or other Indians would feel about that song.\n\nRoxanne Dunbar-Ortiz Outlaw Woman (2001)\n\n[Guthrie's songs] made my head spin[,] made me want to gasp. ... He was so poetic and tough and rhythmic. ... The songs themselves, his repertoire, were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them. ... For me it was an epiphany... I could sing all these songs, every single one of them and they were all that I wanted to sing. It was like I had been in the dark and someone had turned on the main switch of a lightning conductor.\n\nBob Dylan, Chronicles: Volume One (2004), pp. 243–245\n\nGuthrie, he had a particular sound. And besides that, he said something to go along with his sound. That was highly unusual to my ears. He was a radical, his songs had a radical slant. I thought, \"Ooh\", you know, like... \"That's what I want to sing. I want to sing that.\" I couldn't believe that I'd never heard of this man. You could listen to his songs, and actually learn how to live.\n\nBob Dylan, in No Direction Home (2005)\n\nWoody Guthrie was what folks who don't believe in anything would call an anomaly. Admittedly, the intersection of space and time at the corner of July 14, 1912, and Okemah, Oklahoma, was a long shot to produce anything like a national treasure.\n\nWoody was born in one of the most desolate places in America, just in time to come of age in the worst period in our history. … He became the living embodiment of everything a people's revolution is supposed to be about: that working people have dignity, intelligence and value above and beyond the market's demand for their labor. … For me personally, Woody is my hero of heroes and the only person on earth that I will go to my grave regretting that I never met.\n\nSteve Earle, in \"Woody Guthrie\" in The Nation (21 July 2003)\n\nOf course I remember when I was a little kid, I started writing my songs, my dad took me aside one time, and said \"Arlo, you know if you can't be great, it's better to belong.\" I'm still thinking about that.\n\nArlo Guthrie, during the recording of the 40th Anniversary performance of Alice's Restaurant; partly a pun on how Alice's Restaurant is nearly 20 minutes or longer each time he performs it.\n\nNow they sing out his praises on every distant shore,\n\nBut so few remember what he was fightin' for.\n\nOh why sing the songs and forget about the aim,\n\nHe wrote them for a reason, why not sing them for the same?\n\nAnd now he's bound for a glory all his own,\n\nAnd now he's bound for glory.\n\nPhil Ochs, in \"Bound For Glory (The Story of Woody Guthrie)\" (1963)\n\nI remember the night he wrote the song \"Tom Joad.\" He said, \"Pete, do you know where I can get a typewriter?\"\n\nI said, \"I'm staying with someone who has one.\"\n\n\"Well, I got to write a ballad,\" he said. \"I don't usually write ballads to order, but Victor wants me to do a whole album of Dust Bowl songs, and they say they want one about Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath.\" … Woody had a half-gallon jug of wine with him, sat down and started typing away. He would stand up every few seconds and test out a verse on his guitar and sit down and type some more. About one o'clock my friend and I got so sleepy we couldn't stay awake. In the morning we found Woody curled up on the floor under the table; the half gallon of wine was almost empty and the completed ballad was sitting near the typewriter.\n\nAnd it is one of his masterpieces.\n\nPete Seeger, in The Incompleat Folksinger (1972), p. 44\n\nWe must look beyond the songs to find the full importance of Woody Guthrie. As a song-maker, he has earned the stature he deserves. But his reputation as a writer, poet and philosopher is still underground and must he brought into the light. When his songs, poems, and essays are studied in our American literature classes, this omission may be righted.\n\nRobert Shelton, in his introduction to Born To Win (1967) by Woody Guthrie\n\nWoody is just Woody. Thousands of people do not know he has any other name. He is just a voice and a guitar. He sings the songs of a people and I suspect that he is, in a way, that people. Harsh voiced and nasal, his guitar hanging like a tire iron on a rusty rim, there is nothing sweet about Woody, and there is nothing sweet about the songs he sings. But there is something more important for those who will listen. There is the will of the people to endure and fight against oppression. I think we call this the American spirit.\n\nJohn Steinbeck, as quoted in Woody Guthrie: A Life (1981) by Joe Klein, p. 160\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nWikidata has open data related to:\n\nThe Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives\n\nBound for Glory : The Life and TImes of Woody Guthrie at theMOMI.org\n\nWoody Guthrie and the Archive of American Folk Song: Correspondence, 1940-1950 at the Library of Congress\n\nTimeline of Guthrie's life\n\nAmerican Masters : Woody Guthrie: Ain't Got No Home (PBS)\n\nAllmusic.com entry for Woody Guthrie\n\nMP3 recording of \"This Land Is Your Land\" at the University of Virginia Library\n\n\"Pete Seeger remembers Woody Guthrie\" (PBS) (RealPlayer audio file)\n\n\"Woody Guthrie\" by Steve Earle in The Nation (21 July 2003)\n\nPop Matters on the Woody Guthrie Folk Festival"
