        "text": "Pretty Boy Floyd\n\nby Woody Guthrie – 1939\n\nThe pertinent verses:\n\nYes, as through this world I’ve wandered\n\nI’ve seen lots of funny men;\n\nSome will rob you with a six-gun,\n\nAnd some with a fountain pen.\n\nAnd as through your life you travel,\n\nYes, as through your life you roam,\n\nYou won’t never see an outlaw\n\nDrive a family from their home.\n\nThis song was written in March 1939, five years after Floyd’s death. It has been recorded and performed by many country and folk musicians over the years, including Arlo Guthrie, The Byrds, Bob Dylan, Roseanne Cash, and James Taylor.\n\nWoody Guthrie died at the age of 55 in 1967.\n\nAside:\n\nWhat’s the “missing” verses from Guthrie’s wonderful anthem “This Land is Your Land” — with the refrain of “This land was made for you and me.” So exactly what are the verses that were cut out of the All-America version that we love and know — the verses that aren’t in the lyrics seen and sung all over the country?\n\nAs I went walking I saw a sign there,\n\nAnd on the sign it said “No Trespassing.”\n\nBut on the other side it didn’t say nothing.\n\nThat side was made for you and me.\n\nIn the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,\n\nBy the relief office I seen my people;\n\nAs they stood there hungry, I stood there asking\n\nIs this land made for you and me?\n\nPretty Boy Floyd\n\nWords and Music by Woody Guthrie – 1939\n\nIf you’ll gather ’round me, children,\n\nA story I will tell\n\n‘Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,\n\nOklahoma knew him well.\n\nIt was in the town of Shawnee,\n\nA Saturday afternoon,\n\nHis wife beside him in his wagon\n\nAs into town they rode.\n\nThere a deputy sheriff approached him\n\nIn a manner rather rude,\n\nVulgar words of anger,\n\nAn’ his wife she overheard.\n\nPretty Boy grabbed a log chain,\n\nAnd the deputy grabbed his gun;\n\nIn the fight that followed\n\nHe laid that deputy down.\n\nThen he took to the trees and timber\n\nAlong the river shore,\n\nHiding on the river bottom\n\nAnd he never come back no more.\n\nYes, he took to the trees and timber\n\nTo live a life of shame;\n\nEvery crime in Oklahoma\n\nWas added to his name.\n\nBut a many a starvin’ farmer\n\nThe same old story told\n\nHow the outlaw paid their mortgage\n\nAnd saved their little homes.\n\nOthers tell you ’bout a stranger\n\nThat come to beg a meal,\n\nUnderneath his napkin\n\nLeft a thousand-dollar bill.\n\nIt was in Oklahoma City,\n\nIt was on a Christmas Day,\n\nThere was a whole car load of groceries\n\nCome with a note to say:\n\n“Well, you say that I’m an outlaw,\n\nYou say that I’m a thief.\n\nHere’s a Christmas dinner\n\nFor the families on relief.”\n\nYes, as through this world I’ve wandered\n\nI’ve seen lots of funny men;\n\nSome will rob you with a six-gun,\n\nAnd some with a fountain pen.\n\nAnd as through your life you travel,\n\nYes, as through your life you roam,\n\nYou won’t never see an outlaw\n\nDrive a family from their home.\n\nClick on the start-triangle at the center of each video to play the music.\n\nThe Byrds — Original Version\n\n“Legacy Edition”\n\nJames Taylor"
