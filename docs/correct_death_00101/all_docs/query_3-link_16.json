        "text": "Woodrow Wilson Guthrie was born on July 14, 1911 in Okemah, Oklahoma. Woody was named after the then soon-to-be elected president and was the son of businessman and local politician, Charles Edward Guthrie. Woody’s mother, Nora Belle Guthrie was a homemaker who later died of Huntington’s disease- a neurological disease that Woody also inherited.\n\nAlthough Woody Guthrie grew up in Okemah, OK, his adventures took him all over the country and abroad. He combined his keen observational skill with wry wit and a passion for humanity. Throughout the years, Guthrie produced a treasure trove of songs, poems, books, newspaper columns, radio programs, film appearances, photographs, and drawings that continue to inspire artists and thinkers today.\n\nAs Bob Dylan wrote in his poem, “Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie”:\n\nYou can either go to the church of your choice\n\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\n\nYou’ll find God in the church of your choice\n\nYou’ll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\n\nAnd though it’s only my opinion\n\nI may be right or wrong\n\nYou’ll find them both\n\nIn the Grand Canyon\n\nAt sundown\n\nThanks to users crabapple, nevereatsshreddedwheat and corporate_sunshine for their contributions. Here is a list of locations associated with America’s finest Dust-Bowl rambling balladeer."
