Guthrie's tumultuous life had its roots in the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s, and World War II, and many of his songs were considered powerful anthems in defense of the poor and oppressed.",

        "text": "Woodrow Wilson Guthrie was born on July 14, 1912 into a prosperous family in the midwestern U.S. state of Oklahoma.\n\nBut by the time he was 17, Guthrie -- or Woody, as he had come to be known -- had lost his mother, a sister, and the family home, all under tragic circumstances.\n\nDestitute, he embarked on a hardscrabble life, migrating to Texas and California in search of work as the Great Depression and the devastating 1930s drought known as the Dust Bowl left hundreds of thousands of Americans hungry and poor.\n\nThrough it all Guthrie, a musician, was chronicling his experiences in songs like the 1938 \"I Ain't Got No Home In This World Anymore,\" which describes life as an itinerant worker roaming from \"town to town:\"\n\nNow, 100 years after his birth, Guthrie is considered to be one of the United States' most important and prolific folk singers.\n\nHe is believed to have written as many as 3,000 songs before his death in 1967 of Huntington's disease at the age of 55.\n\nSongs From An Honest Place\n\nAccording to his granddaughter, Anna Canoni, Guthrie appealed to generations of ordinary Americans because his own life had been marked by many of the same struggles they shared.\n\n\"He migrated with thousands and thousands of people from Oklahoma to California,\" she says. \"He wasn't just reading about it. He experienced it. He was in the migrant camps in California. He experienced people starving. So I think that he wrote songs from a very honest place, a place of genuine experience.\"\n\nGuthrie's travels and his experiences among the working class left him with both a respect for the American countryside and a passionate opposition to what he saw as the destructive nature of capitalism and private property.\n\nIn 1940 he wrote \"This Land Is Your Land,\" a song that has come to be known as one of the United States' most famous folk songs.\n\nThe song was written in response to the patriotic ballad \"God Bless America,\" which Guthrie deeply disliked for what he considered its nationalist overtones.\n\n\"This Land Is Your Land\" has since come to be seen as an unofficial national anthem, with lyrics celebrating the beauty of the American landscape and the independence of its people.\n\n'This Machine Kills Fascists'\n\nBut Guthrie's scope wasn't limited to the United States.\n\nThe songwriter, who wrote a regular column in a U.S. Communist Party newspaper, was a keen defender of the international labor movement.\n\nAnd with the start of World War II, he dedicated many songs to the fight against Nazi Germany.\n\nHis guitar emblazoned with the slogan \"This Machine Kills Fascists,\" Guthrie authored a number of songs decrying Hitler and lionizing his Soviet opponents.\n\nOne such song, \"Miss Pavlichenko,\" honored the legendary Ukrainian female sniper Lyudmyla Pavlichenko with the phrase, \"300 Nazis fell by your gun.\"\n\nGuthrie, a confirmed iconoclast, was never a formal member of the Communist Party.\n\nBut his sympathy towards communist ideals and his fascination with the Soviet Union made him a controversial figure in the United States during the Cold War and beyond.\n\nEven today, some Americans see Guthrie as an angry radical who sought to bring down the government.\n\nBut his defenders say Guthrie, in fact, was a joyful, good-natured optimist who believed that ordinary people deserved a role in political decision-making.\n\nFilm director Peter Frumkin, who profiled Guthrie in the 2006 documentary \"Ain't Got No Home,\" maintains that the singer-songwriter remains widely revered in the United States, especially as the current faltering economy is fueling a new protest climate:\n\n\"I think Woody Guthrie's legacy is becoming more important to the country now, because some of the issues that he was writing about are reappearing,\" he says.\n\n\"In the 1930s and 1940s, when he was writing, working people in the country were having a really, really tough time, and once again, the middle class is having a really, really tough time.\"\n\nWoody Guthrie's son Arlo and daughter Nora have forged successful folk careers of their own.\n\nAnd Guthrie himself remains a frequent inspiration for some of the best-known performing artists today, including Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Billy Bragg, who share his belief in the power of music to change things for the better.\n\nDaisy Sindelar\n\nDaisy Sindelar is the vice president and editor in chief of RFE/RL."
