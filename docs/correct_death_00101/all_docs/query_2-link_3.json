They've become the folk song standards of the nation, known and performed in many languages throughout the world. He wrote over 3,000 songs in his lifetime, hundreds of which that have become staples in the canon of American music.

        "text": "CHILDHOOD (1912â1931)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"Okemah was one of the singingest, square dancingest, drinkingest, yellingest, preachingest, walkingest, talkingest, laughingest, cryingest, shootingest, fist fightingest, bleedingest, gamblingest, gun, club and razor carryingest of our ranch towns and farm towns because it blossomed out into one of our first Oil Boom Towns.\"\n\nWoodrow Wilson Guthrie was born on July 14, 1912, in Okemah, Oklahoma. He was the second-born son of Charles and Nora Belle Guthrie. His father â a cowboy, land speculator, and local politician â taught Woody Western songs, Indian songs, and Scottish folk tunes. His Kansas-born mother, also musically inclined, had an equally profound effect on Woody.\n\nSlightly built, with an extremely full and curly head of hair, Woody was a precocious and unconventional boy from the start. Always a keen observer of the world around him, the people, music and landscape he was exposed to made lasting impressions on him.\n\nDuring his early years in Oklahoma, Woody experienced the first of a series of immensely tragic personal losses. With the accidental death of his older sister Clara, the family's financial ruin, and the institutionalization and eventual loss of his mother, Woody's family and home life was forever devastated.\n\nIn 1920, oil was discovered nearby and overnight Okemah was transformed into an \"oil boom\" town, bringing thousands of workers, gamblers and hustlers to the once sleepy farm town. Within a few years, the oil flow suddenly stopped and Okemah suffered a severe economic turnaround, leaving the town and its inhabitants \"busted, disgusted, and not to be trusted.\"\n\nFrom his experiences in Okemah, Woodyâs uniquely wry outlook on life, as well as his abiding interest in rambling around the country, was formed. And so, he took to the open road.\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nHard Travelin' (Woody Guthrie)\n\nI Hear You Sing Again (Janis Ian)\n\nOklahoma Hills (Arlo Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nBound For Glory (Woody Guthrie)\n\nTHE GREAT DUST BOWL (1931â1937)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"If there was anybody around there that did not play some instrument I did not see them... We played for rodeos, centennials, carnivals, parades, fairs, just bustdown parties, and played several nights and days a week just to hear our own boards rattle and our strings roar around in the wind. It was along in these days I commenced singing, I guess it was singing.\"\n\nIn 1931, when Okemah's boomtown period went bust, Woody left for Texas. In the panhandle town of Pampa, he fell in love with Mary Jennings, the younger sister of a friend and musician named Matt Jennings. Woody and Mary were married in 1933, and together had three children, Gwen, Sue and Bill.\n\nIt was with Matt Jennings and Cluster Baker that Woody made his first attempt at a musical career, forming The Corn Cob Trio and later the Pampa Junior Chamber of Commerce Band. It was also in Pampa that Woody first discovered a love and talent for drawing and painting, an interest he would pursue throughout his life.\n\nIf the Great Depression made it hard for Woody to support his family, the onslaught of the Great Dust Storm period, which hit the Great Plains in 1935, made it impossible. Drought and dust forced thousands of desperate farmers and unemployed workers from Oklahoma, Kansas, Tennessee, and Georgia to head west in search of work. Woody, like hundreds of âdustbowl refugees,â hit Route 66, also looking for a way to support his family, who remained back in Pampa.\n\nMoneyless and hungry, Woody hitchhiked, rode freight trains, and even walked his way to California, taking whatever small jobs he could. In exchange for bed and board, Woody painted signs and played guitar and sang in saloons along the way, developing a love for traveling the open roadâa lifelong habit he would often repeat.\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nThe Great Dust Storm (Woody Guthrie)\n\nSo Long, It's Been Good To Know Yuh (Woody Guthrie)\n\nTalkin' Dust Bowl (Woody Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nDust Bowl Ballads (Woody Guthrie)\n\nHome In This World (Various Artists)\n\nWoody Guthrie Classics Songbook (Woody Guthrie)\n\nKFVD: THE RADIO YEARS (1937â1940)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"I hate a song that makes you think that you're not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are either too old or too young or too fat or too slim or too ugly or too this or too that....songs that run you down or songs that poke fun of you on account of your bad luck or your hard traveling. I am out to fight those kinds of songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood.\"\n\nBy the time he arrived in California in 1937, Woody had experienced intense scorn, hatred, and even physical antagonism from resident Californians, who opposed the massive migration of the so-called âOkieâ outsiders.\n\nIn Los Angeles Woody landed a job on KFVD radio, singing âold-timeâ traditional songs as well as some original songs. Together with his singing partner Maxine Crissman, aka âLefty Lou,â Woody began to attract widespread public attention, particularly from the thousands of relocated Okies gathered in migrant camps. Living in makeshift cardboard and tin shelters, Woodyâs program provided entertainment and a nostalgic sense of the âhomeâ life theyâd left behind; despite their desperate circumstances, it was a respite from the harsh realities of migrant life.\n\nThe local radio airwaves also provided Woody a forum from which he developed his talent for controversial social commentary and criticism. On topics ranging from corrupt politicians, lawyers, and businessmen to praising the compassionate and humanist principles of Jesus Christ, the outlaw hero Pretty Boy Floyd, and the union organizers that were fighting for the rights of migrant workers in Californiaâs agricultural communities, Woody proved himself a hard-hitting advocate for truth, fairness, and justice.\n\nWoody strongly identified with his audience and adapted to an âoutsiderâ status, along with them. This role would become an essential element of his political and social positioning, gradually working its way into his songwriting; âI Ain't Got No Homeâ, âGoin' Down the Road Feelin' Badâ, âTalking Dust Bowl Bluesâ, âTom Joadâ and âHard Travelin'â; all reflect his desire to give voice to those who had been disenfranchised.\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nDo Re Mi (Woody Guthrie)\n\nPretty Boy Floyd (Woody Guthrie)\n\nVigilante Man (Woody Guthrie)\n\nWoody's and Lefty Lou’s Theme Song (Words and Music by Woody Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nNew Multitudes (Jay Farrar, Anders Parker, Will Johnson, and Yim Yames)\n\nWoody Guthrie in L.A. 1937-1941 (Darryl Holter and Bill Deverell)\n\nNEW YORK TOWN (1940-1941)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"There's several ways of saying what's on your mind. And in states and counties where it ain't any too healthy to talk too loud, speak your mind, or even to vote like you want to, folks have found other ways of getting the word around. One of the mainest ways is by singing. Drop the word 'folk' and just call it real old honest to god American singing. No matter who makes it up, no matter who sings it and who don't, if it talks the lingo of the people, it's a cinch to catch on, and will be sung here and yonder for a long time after you've cashed in your chips. If the fight gets hot, the songs get hotter. If the going gets tough, the songs get tougher.\"\n\nNever comfortable with success, or being in one place for too long, Woody headed east for New York City, arriving in 1940. He was quickly embraced for his Steinbeckian homespun wisdom and musical \"authenticity\" by leftist organizations, artists, writers, musicians, and progressive intellectuals. That same year, folklorist Alan Lomax recorded Woody in a series of conversations and songs for the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. Woody also recorded âDust Bowl Balladsâ for RCA Victor, his first album of original songs, and throughout the 1940s he continued to record hundreds of discs for Moses Asch, founder of Folkways Records. The recordings from this early period continue to be touchstones for folk music singer-songwriters everywhere.\n\nIn New York City, Lead Belly, Cisco Houston, Burl Ives, Pete Seeger, Will Geer, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Josh White, Millard Lampell, Bess Hawes, Sis Cunningham, among others, all became Woody's close friends and musical collaborators. Forming a loosely knit folk group called The Almanac Singers, they took up social causes such as union organizing, anti-Fascism, strengthening the Communist Party, peace, and generally fighting for the things they believed in the best way they could: through songs of political protest and activism. Woody became one of the prominent songwriters for the Almanac Singers.\n\nThe Almanacs helped to establish folk music as a viable commercial genre within the popular music industry. A decade later, original members of the Almanacs would re-form as the Weavers, the most commercially successful and influential folk music group of the early 1950s. It was through their tremendous popularity that Woodyâs songs would become known to the larger public.\n\nWith increasing popularity, prosperity and critical success from public performances, recordings, and even his own radio show, Woody could afford to bring his struggling family to New York to enjoy his new found success.\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nTalkin' Subway Blues (Woody Guthrie's American Song)\n\nThis Land Is Your Land (Woody Guthrie)\n\nTom Joad (Woody Guthrie)\n\nUnion Maid (Woody Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nMy Name Is New York: Ramblin' Around Woody Guthrie's New York Town (Nora Guthrie)\n\nThis Land: Symphonic Variations on a Song by Woody Guthrie (David Amram)\n\nThis Land Is Your Land (Woody Guthrie and Kathy Jakobsen)\n\nHard Hitting Songs For Hard Hitting People (Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Alan Lomax)\n\nCOLUMBIA RIVER (1941)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"The Pacific Northwest is one of my favorite spots in this world, and I'm one walker that's stood way up and looked way down acrost aplenty of pretty sights in all their veiled and nakedest seasons. The Pacific Northwest has got mineral mountains. It's got chemical deserts. It's got rough run canyons. It's got sawblade snowcaps. It's got ridges of nine kinds of brown, hills out of six colors of green, ridges five shades of shadows, and stickers the eight tones of hell. I pulled my shoes on and walked out of every one of these Pacific Northwest Mountain towns drawing pictures in my mind and listening to poems and songs and words faster to come and dance in my ears than I could ever get them wrote down...\"\n\nDespite his success, Woody became increasingly restless and disillusioned with New York's radio and entertainment industry. Feeling the heat of censorship he wrote: \"I got disgusted with the whole sissified and nervous rules of censorship on all my songs and ballads, and drove off down the road across the southern states again.\"\n\nLeaving New York, with his wife and three young children in tow, Woody headed out to Portland, Oregon where a documentary film project about the building of the Grand Coulee Dam sought to use his songwriting talent. The Bonneville Power Administration placed Woody on the Federal payroll for a month and there he composed the Columbia River Songs, another remarkable collection of songs that include âRoll on Columbia,â âGrand Coulee Dam,â and âThe Biggest Thing That Man Has Done.â\n\nWhen his contract expired, Woody moved his family back to Pampa, Texas.\n\nHoping to get back to New York City, and on the radio, he hitchhiked his way across the country. Woody's constant traveling, performing, and lack of regular work throughout the early 1940s took a hard toll on his family. Together with his increasing interest and involvement with progressive âradicalâ politics helped bring about the end of his first marriage.\n\nâTo Woody, poet of the rain-starved Dust Bowl, this mighty stream of cool, clear water, coursing through evergreen forests, verdant meadows, and high deserts was like a vision of paradise. He saw the majestic Grand Coulee Dam as the creation of the common man to harness the river for the common good â work for the jobless, power to ease household tasks, power to strengthen Uncle Sam in his fight against world fascism.â âAlan Lomax\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nGrand Coulee Dam (Woody Guthrie)\n\nPastures of Plenty (Woody Guthrie)\n\nRoll On Columbia (Woody Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nColumbia River Collection (Woody Guthrie)\n\nColumbia River Songbook (Woody Guthrie)\n\n26 Songs in 30 Days: Woody Guthrie's Columbia River Songs (Greg Vandy)\n\nWORLD WAR II (1942â1945)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ âMy big Gibson guitar has got a sign I painted on it, says, \"This machine kills fascists\" and it means just what it says too.\"\n\nBack in New York, Woody met and vigorously courted a young dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company named Marjorie (Greenblatt) Mazia. Sharing humanist ideals and activist politics, Woody and Marjorie were married in 1945 and over the years had four children: Cathy, (who died at age four in a tragic home fire), Arlo, Joady, and Nora.\n\nThis relationship provided Woody a level of domestic stability and encouragement which he had previously not known, enabling him to turn out a staggering number of original songs, writings, drawings, paintings, poems and prose pieces. His first novel, Bound for Glory, a semi-autobiographical account of his Dust Bowl years was published in 1943 to critical acclaim.\n\nDuring World War II, moved by his passion against Fascism, Woody served in both the Merchant Marine and the Army. Shipping out to sea on several occasions with his buddies Cisco Houston and Jimmy Longhi, Woody's tendency to write songs, tell stories and make drawings continued unabated. He composed hundreds of anti-Hitler, pro-war, and historic ballads to rally the troops, such as âAll You Fascists Bound To Loseâ, âTalking Merchant Marine,â and âThe Sinking of the Reuben James.â He began to work on a second novel, Sea Porpoise, and was enlisted by the army to write songs about the dangers of venereal diseases, which were published in brochures distributed to sailors. His capacity for creative self-expression seemed inexhaustible, whether on land or sea.\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nDear Mrs. Roosevelt (Bob Dylan and The Band)\n\nI've Got To Know (Woody Guthrie)\n\nThe Sinking of the Reuben James (Woody Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nThat's Why We're Marching (Woody Guthrie)\n\nWoody, Cisco, and Me (Vincent Jimmy Longhi)\n\nCONEY ISLAND (1946â1954)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"Watch the kids. Do like they do. Act like they act. Yell like they yell. Dance the ways you see them dance. Sing like they sing. Work and rest the way the kids do. You'll be healthier. You'll feel wealthier. You'll talk wiser. You'll go higher, do better, and live longer here amongst us if you'll just only jump in here and swim around in these songs and do like the kids do. I don't want the kids to be grownup. I want to see the grown folks be kids.\"\n\nFollowing the war, in 1946, Woody Guthrie returned to settle in Coney Island, New York, with his wife Marjorie and their children. The peace he had fought so hard for seemed finally within his reach. It was during this time that Woody composed and recorded Songs to Grow On For Mother and Child and Work Songs To Grow On, considered children's classics which won him success and recognition as an innovative writer of childrenâs songs.\n\nWoodyâs unique approach was to write songs that dealt with topics important to children written in language used by children such as; friendship (âDonât You Push Me Downâ), family (âShip In The Skyâ), community (âHowdi Dooâ), chores (âPick It Upâ), personal responsibility (âCleanoâ) and just plain fun (âRiding In My Carâ).\n\nDuring these years, Woody was exposed to Coney Islandâs Jewish community through his mother-in-law, Aliza Greenblatt, a Yiddish poet. Inspired by this new relationship, he wrote a remarkable series of songs reflecting Jewish culture, such as âHanuka Dance,â âThe Many and The Fewâ and âMermaidâs Avenue.â\n\nToward the late 1940s, Woodyâs behavior started to become increasingly erratic, moody and violent, creating tensions in his personal and professional life. He was beginning to show symptoms of a rare, neurological disease, Huntington's Chorea, a hereditary, degenerative disease that gradually and eventually robbed him of his health, talents and abilities. At the time, little was known about Huntingtonâs Chorea. It was later discovered to be the same disease which thirty years earlier had caused his mother's institutionalization and eventual death.\n\nShaken by inexplicable volatile physical and emotional symptoms, Woody left his family once again, taking off for California with his young protÃ©gÃ©, Ramblin' Jack Elliott.\n\nArriving at his friend Will Geerâs property, Woody met Anneke Van Kirk, a young woman who became his third wife and with whom they had a daughter, Lorina.\n\nSuggested Lyrics\n\nHowdi Do (Woody Guthrie)\n\nMail Myself To You (Arlo Guthrie)\n\nRiding In My Car (Woody Guthrie)\n\nRelated Releases\n\nSongs To Grow On for Mother and Child (Woody Guthrie)\n\nThe Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949 (Woody & Marjorie Guthrie)\n\nMermaid Avenue (Billy Bragg & Wilco)\n\nMermaid Avenue, Vol. 2 (Billy Bragg & Wilco)\n\nWonder Wheel (The Klezmatics)\n\nHappy Joyous Hanukkah (The Klezmatics)\n\nHOSPITAL YEARS (1954-1967)\n\nWOODY SEZ ~ \"I never dread the day that I will die, âCause my sunset is Somebodyâs morning sky.\"\n\nThe late 1940âs and early 1950âs saw a rise in anti-Communist sentiments. Leftist and progressive-minded Americans were subjected to Red-scare tactics such as âblacklistingâ. Many people, particularly in the arts and entertainment fields, either lost their jobs or were prevented from working in their chosen careers. The Weavers, along with Woody, Pete Seeger and others from their circle, were targeted for their activist stances on such issues as the right to unionize, equal rights, and free speech.\n\nWoody headed south to Florida, where friend and fellow activist Stetson Kennedy offered blacklisted artists living space on his property. While in the South at Kennedyâs âBeluthahatcheeâ, Woody worked on a third novel, Seeds of Man, and composed songs inspired by a heightened awareness of racial and environmental issues.\n\nBecoming more and more unpredictable during a final series of road trips, Woody eventually returned to New York with Anneke, where he was hospitalized several times. Mistakenly diagnosed and treated for everything from alcoholism to schizophrenia, his symptoms kept worsening and his physical condition deteriorated. Picked up for âvagrancyâ in New Jersey in 1954, he was admitted into the nearby Greystone Psychiatric Hospital, where he was finally diagnosed with Huntingtonâs Chorea, the incurable degenerative nerve disorder now known as Huntingtonâs Disease or HD.\n\nDuring these years, Marjorie Guthrie, family and friends continued to visit and care for him. A new generation of musicians took an interest in folk music bringing it into the mainstream as yet another folk music revival. Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, The Greenbriar Boys, Phil Ochs, and many other young folksingers visited Woody in the hospital, bringing along their guitars and their songs to play for him, perhaps even to thank him.\n\nWoody Guthrie died on October 3, 1967 while at Creedmoor State Hospital in Queens, New York. His ashes were sprinkled into the waters off of Coney Island's shore.\n\nA month later, on Thanksgiving 1967, Woodyâs son Arlo Guthrie released his first commercial recording of âAliceâs Restaurantâ, which was to become the iconic anti-war anthem for the next generation.\n\nIn his lifetime, Woody Guthrie wrote nearly 3,000 song lyrics, published two novels, created artworks, authored numerous published and unpublished manuscripts, poems, prose, and plays and hundreds of letters and news article which are housed in the Woody Guthrie Archives in Tulsa, OK at the The Woody Guthrie Center\n\nâWoody is just Woody. Thousands of people do not know he has any other name. He is just a voice and a guitar. He sings the songs of a people and I suspect that he is, in a way, that people. Harsh voiced and nasal, his guitar hanging like a tire iron on a rusty rim, there is nothing sweet about Woody, and there is nothing sweet about the songs he sings. But there is something more important for those who still listen. There is the will of a people to endure and fight against oppression.

Sometimes when I hear music I think back over my days - and a feeling that is fifty-fifty joy and pain swells like clouds taking all kinds of shapes in my mind. Music is in all the sounds of nature and there never was a sound that was not music - the splash of an alligator, the rain dripping on dry leaves, the whistle of a train, a long and lonesome train whistling down, a truck horn blowing at a street corner speaker - kids squawling along the streets - the silent wail of wind and sky caressing the breasts of the desert. Life is this sound, and since creation has been a song. And there is no real trick of creating words to set to music, once you realize that the word is the music and the people are the song.\"\n\nHaving lived through some of the most significant historic movements and events of the Twentieth-Century --the Great Depression, the Great Dust Storm, World War II, the social and the political upheavals resulting from Unionism, the Communist Party and the Cold War-- Woody absorbed it all to become a prolific writer whose songs, ballads, prose and poetry captured the plight of everyman. While traveling throughout the American landscape during the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, Woody's observations of what he saw and experienced has left for us a lasting and sometimes haunting legacy of images, sounds, and voices of the marginalized, disenfranchised, and oppressed people with whom he struggled to survive despite all odds. Although the corpus of original Woody Guthrie songs, or as Woody preferred \"people's songs\" are, perhaps, his most recognized contribution to American culture, the stinging honesty, humor, and wit found even in his most vernacular prose writings exhibit Woody's fervent belief in social, political, and spiritual justice.\n\nRelated Releases\n\nTil We Outnumber 'Em' (Various Artists)\n\nWoody Guthrie: The Tribute Concerts (Various Artists)\n\n1996\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and Case Western Reserve University presented a ten day celebration honoring Woody Guthrie, entitled Hard Travelin'.
