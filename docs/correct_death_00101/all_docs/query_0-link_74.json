        "meta_description": "My Name Is New York (Audiobook) by Nora Guthrie &amp; Woody Guthrie, released 08 October 2020\n\n1. Location 01 ~ 59th Street At 5th Avenue\n2. Location 02 ~ 101 West 43rd Street\n3. Location 03 ~ 57 East 4th Street\n\n*GRAMMY Award Nominee ~ &quot;The New York Trains&quot; nominated for Best American Roots Song\r\n\r\nWoody Guthrie first arrived in New York City on February 16, 1940. Although he continued to ramble, for 27 years— from 1940 until his death in 1967—New York was the city he called home and always returned to.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, this wonderful New York story comes to life with historical photos, documents, and previously unpublished lyrics from the Woody Guthrie Archives. Highlighting 19 significant locations, this special audiobook provides an expansive yet intimate portrait of Woody Guthrie’s NYC life. \r\n\r\nMany of Woody’s most popular songs were written in apartments, lofts, and other locations around “New York Town.” That song, along with “Jesus Christ,” “Vigilante Man,” “Hard Travelin’,” “Tom Joad,” “Reuben James,” “All You Fascists Bound to Lose,” and “1913 Massacre,” are among the more than 600 he composed in The Big Apple. Most surprisingly, his iconic “This Land Is Your Land,” was written at a small rooming house on 43rd Street and Sixth Avenue, on February 23, 1940 within a few days of his arrival. With new friends Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee and the Almanac Singers he was at the center of a new movement—introducing and popularizing rural, roots, topical, and protest music to modern, urban audiences.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to walk the streets, ride the buses and subways, or sit down and relax on some of the stoops, park benches, or beaches where Woody Guthrie did—always strumming away on his guitar, always working on a new song.",

Pastures of Plenty, Tom Joad, Deportee, Oklahoma Hills, Union Maid, Jesus Christ, and This Land Is Your Land are among the hundreds that have become staples in the canon of American music. ... more"
