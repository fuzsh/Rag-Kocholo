        "text": "Was Lottie Williams murdered or\n\ndid she commit suicide? This is the\n\nquestion that has been freely discussed\n\nby the many friends of the Perth girl\n\nwho so tragically passed out in\n\nMelbourne somewhere about a fortnight\n\nago; and it may be said that the gen-\n\neral opinion is that she did not take\n\nher own life.\n\nAlthough she was inclined to take an\n\ninterest in metaphysical or religions\n\nfads, Lottie Williams was a, very\n\nsensible and cheerful girl and in her\n\nnormal senses was not likely to listen to\n\nany suggestion of self-destruction. She\n\nwas ordinarily well read and had an\n\ninclination to penwork, and could write\n\nattractively,as those who have read\n\nthe women's notes in the \"Railway\n\nGazette\" may discover. None of her\n\nfriends whom we have questioned ever\n\nheard her express peculiar conclusions\n\nas to the disillusions of life that would\n\ninduce what Schopenhauer would call\n\nthe \"will to death.\"\n\nConsequently the deduction is that\n\nshe did not die willingly-not, at all\n\nevents, in her normal mentality-and\n\nthe only alternative is that she was\n\neither murdered or was induced to\n\ntake some will-destroying, drug and\n\nwas so made susceptible to suggestions\n\nof suicide. Of course that resolves it-\n\nself into very much the same thing as\n\nhomicide, and might be designated a\n\ndistinction without a difference. It is\n\nto be feared, however, that \"the tragic\n\nmystery will never' be cleared up,\n\nunless Lottie Williams had written to her\n\nmother shortly before her death,in\n\nwhich case some clue may be. gained\n\nas to her state of mind.\n\nIt is strange, however, that after her\n\narrival in Melbourne, she does not\n\nappear to have written to any of her\n\nfriends here. She was fond of scribbling\n\nnotes. It was a trick of hers in\n\nthe Audit Office to dash off notes to\n\nother typists either in that department\n\nor elsewhere and despatch them at\n\nonce. Such an idiosyncrasy or habit\n\nwas likely to remain with her wherever\n\nshe went, and the fact that she\n\ndid not communicate with people here\n\nis inexplicable to those who knew her.\n\nOne of her closest friends had not\n\nlong previously gone to Sydney, and\n\nit is just possible that this young lady\n\nmay hare had letters from her after\n\nher arrival in Melbourne. This is\n\nmore likely to be the case, inasmuch:\n\nas Lottie Williams took with her from\n\nPerth several presents or pieces of\n\nmusic for her friend, which shows that\n\nshe intended to go to Sydney herself..\n\nIn fact, it is stated that such was her\n\nintention, as her friend had advised,\n\nher that she would have no difficulty\n\nin getting a position there.\n\nThen why did she stay in Melbourne?\n\nIt is pretty certain that her objective\n\nwas Sydney when she left Perth. That\n\nwas on September 25, and several\n\nfriends who saw her off on the Indarra\n\nstate that she was bright and hopeful.\n\nThere was no secrecy about her going\n\naway. The man Greenwood was there,\n\nand somewhat ostentatiously bade her\n\ngood-bye, but he was never seen about\n\nPerth afterwards, and the, inference is\n\nthat he remained on the steamer, and\n\nwent to Melbourne by it. If he .had\n\nmerely failed to come ashore when the\n\nship was casting off he could have left\n\nthe boat at Albany next day, but it is\n\nclear that he intended to go on. Was\n\nLottie Williams cognisant of this intention\n\nwhen they parted (apparently) at\n\nFremantle? Her friends firmly believe\n\nthat she was not, but that Greenwood\n\ndeceived her and kept out of the way\n\nuntil the ship left Albany.\n\nAfter that the deeper mystery begins.\n\nThey arrived in Melbourne on\n\nSaturday,October 2, and must have\n\ntaken rooms almost immediately after-\n\nwards at Whitehall Chambers, Bank\n\nplace, under the name of Mr. and Mrs.\n\nHardey: None of the residents of the\n\nbuilding saw much of them, and they\n\nmade no acquaintances. Now, the\n\nbodies of both were found on October\n\n22, or 20 days after they had reached\n\nMelbourne, but it is alleged that Lottie\n\nWilliams had not been seen for a fort-\n\nnight previously. Even a week previously\n\nwould bring us only to October\n\n15, whereas Greenwood dated a letter\n\nto a resident of W.A. on the 18th.\n\nWhen the girl's body was found the\n\ndoctor who was called in thought she\n\nhad been dead for some time, probably\n\na week. Therefore, when Greenwood\n\nwrote on the 18th that they were going\n\nto be married she must have been\n\nlying dead in the room. If so, why\n\ndid he write? Did he contemplate going\n\naway? Because, if' he did not,\n\nthen there was no object' in writing\n\nand saying they were to be married\n\n-unless he meant lt In the spiritual\n\nsense.\n\nGreenwood, however, was not spiritual,\n\nbut rather material. He expressed\n\nthe view while employed in the\n\nState Audit Department that it would\n\nbe a splendid thing to have a grand\n\nfinal flutter of a fortnight and then\n\npass out. That is purely the materialist's\n\napotheosis. It is the essence of\n\nthe declaration in Isaiah: \"Let us eat\n\nand drink, for to-morrow we die.\"\n\nGreenwood affected to hold peculiar\n\nviews, but many now think that was\n\na veneer or a cloak, or a bait if you\n\nlike. He was known to lay siege\n\nto the weaker sex, and occult jargon\n\nand talk about affinities and twin souls\n\nwas part of his artillery, so to speak.\n\nHe is described as possessing\n\nindications of a Mongolian strain. His\n\nfeatures were of the Mongolian type,\n\nwith high cheek bones sallow skin,\n\nprominent almond-colored eyes, and\n\nshort wiry hair of the bristly kind. It"
