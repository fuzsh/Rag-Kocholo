Her formal education ended early so she could help provide care for her younger siblings.\n\nShe was united in holy matrimony to Earnest L. Bell in May of 1956 and moved to Penn Yan, New York to start her journey. She later relocated to Rochester, New York. She professed her faith in Jesus Christ and joined Salem Baptist Missionary Church in Rochester, New York in the late 1960s where she was a dedicated member. She was employed at Rochester City School District for over thirty years until she retired in February of 1995. She had a generous spirit and was loved by many. Her influence will forever remain in the lives of all who knew her.\n\nShe quietly departed this life on July 15, 2024, at 1738. She was preceded in death by her husband, Earnest Bell; daughter, Lizzy Mae Barner; brother, Charlie Barner; mother, Birtha Barner; and her father, Steve Barner.\n\nLilly’s beautiful life will forever be cherished in the lives of her sisters: Willie Lee Wilson of Rochester, New York and Annie Mae Barner of Americus, Georgia; her brother, Calvin Barner of Americus, Georgia; her sisters-in-law: Mary Barner of Americus, Georgia and Evelyn Jackson of Bell Glade, Florida; her brother-in-law, Joseph Walker of Americus, Georgia; a devoted niece that she called her daughter, Linda Wilson of Rochester, New York; devoted great-niece, Latitia Jackson of Rochester, New York; devoted great-nephews “her boys” Jahquan Grimes and Quintel McKnight of Rochester, New York; a host of devoted nieces, great-nieces, nephews, great-nephews, cousins, devoted family members and friends."
