        "text": "Lottie Rendak was a woman of incredible strength. She was a woman of great character, conviction, and yes, even opinion, strong-willed and determined, who lived her life her way, and the Lord’s way. As strong as she was, Lottie was equally caring, as a loving wife, mother, grandmother and friend, always offering her great love, support and strength to those around her.\n\nLottie’s story began on a warm summer day in 1911, in the bustling city of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Those were exciting times in this country, as the automobile and the airplane began to transform our society forever. On June 25, 1911, Matthew and Agnes (Tomajczyk) Smiegel celebrated the birth of a beautiful baby girl, a daughter they named Lottie Anastasia.\n\nLottie was joined by her sisters Vickie, Florence and Rosalyn and her brother Martin in the family’s home, at 1111 Hovey SW. Her hardworking father toiled in the plaster mines of Grand Rapids, while her mother cared for the home and children.\n\nLottie grew up in a devoutly Catholic family, helping form the basis for her lifelong faith, and she attended Sacred Heart School as a child. Like so many young girls in those days, she left school after the ninth grade, attending business school instead.\n\nLottie eventually found work at Stickley Brothers Furniture, working in the factory. She later went to work for Wurzburg’s Department Store, where she worked for several years. It was her personal life that was about to get more interesting, however.\n\nOne day Lottie met a handsome young man named John Rendak, who worked as a milk hauler for Buth Dairies. The sparks flew between them, and a whirlwind romance ensued. The couple soon fell deeply in love, and was married on September 30, 1930 at Sacred Heart Church.\n\nThe newlyweds settled into a house on Jackson NW, the first of several they would call home over the years. Eventually they moved to a home on Lane Avenue, then on Lake Michigan Drive, and finally to a lovely home on Butterworth Drive, where they lived the rest of their days.\n\nJohn took a job as a truck driver for Quimby Walstrom Paper Company, a better opportunity to provide for his new bride and growing family.\n\nLottie and John were blessed with their son John and daughter Virginia over the years, though they sadly suffered the death of another son and daughter as infants. Lottie was a wonderful wife and mother, with a larger-than-life presence in her children’s lives. She was a very strong and strong-willed mom, yet her kids never doubted her love and compassion for them. She enjoyed children very much, and later on worked as a nanny for more than a decade, too.\n\nAdmittedly, Lottie wasn’t the greatest cook or baker (she far preferred eating out), but thankfully, John excelled at both and happily handled those duties. Lottie was a meticulous homemaker, however, and ironed every single stitch of clothing (even the underwear!), and knew exactly where everything was in her home, despite being a self-professed pack-rat.\n\nLottie and John led very active social lives together, as well. They loved to go fishing, and whether it was on the pier, in the river, or on the lake, she didn’t care. Lottie simply loved to fish. The couple also had many, many friends, especially from the Polish Falcons, where John was a longtime President and Lottie was an integral part of the Ladies Auxiliary. Lottie also loved to bowl, and played on a number of leagues over the years. She also was a member of the Polish Aid Society, the Sacred Heart Mothers Club and the Sacred Heart Altar Society, as well.\n\nLottie and John loved to entertain at their home, too, and friends were always stopping by. Their home was a hub of activity in the family, as well, with many beloved backyard barbecues and holiday gatherings over the years.\n\nLater on, when Lottie and John became grandparents, the kids all loved visiting their home. They fondly remember Grandma taking them down to John Ball Park near their home to feed the ducks. Going to Grandma’s also meant a ready supply of Cracker Jacks, chocolate milk, and Vlasic dill pickles! And of course, Grandma would teasingly scare them with her stuffed alligators she brought back from Florida, too!\n\nAfter John retired in the mid-70s, he and Lottie spent their winters in the Sunshine State, in addition to their many trips to Baldwin to visit Lottie’s sister at Wolf Lake. They also went up north together, and visited Niagara Falls, too. They had a beautiful marriage, and were truly best friends, as well. Sadly, John died in 1981 of colon cancer, which Lottie took very hard, of course. Through her great strength and faith, she persevered.\n\nLottie was more content to stay home after John died, content to do her word search puzzles, her sewing, or tending to her houseplants. She still enjoyed getting out to play bingo, or to go shopping, of course (she was thrifty, but always fashionable), and she drove until she was 86! In fact, Lottie put up one of her famous fights when her family told her it wasn’t safe for her to drive anymore. Eventually, she relented, and relinquished her car keys.\n\nThat was Lottie, though; strong-willed, feisty and fearless, never afraid to speak her mind. Lottie’s strength was rooted in her Catholic faith, which she carried with her all of her days. Her favorite possessions were her many rosaries and prayer books, which were never far from her side.\n\nSadly, Lottie died peacefully in her sleep on Tuesday, August 21, 2007, at the age of 96.\n\nLottie was a wonderful woman, a woman of such great strength and faith. She was strong, and strong-willed, such a loving and supportive wife, mother, grandmother and friend. She will be so greatly missed.\n\nLottie was preceded in death by her husband, John Rendak and grandsons Robert Rendak and Ronald Berry, sisters Victoria Ignasiak, Florence Zmudka and Roselyn VanderBaan. Surviving are her son John (Helen Small) Rendak, daughter-in-law Patricia and their children, Debra Rendak, John Rendak, Teresa and Terrence Williams and Marie Rendak. Also surviving are her daughter Virginia and Dick Berry and their children Debi and Dan George, Dan Berry and Karen, daughter-in-law Mary Berry, Greg Berry, Brian Berry and Terri, Brenda and Tim Glerum, her granddaughter, guardian and caregivers, Kathy and Bob, Erik, Brent (Tracy) Clark with whom she resided. She is also survived by 28 great grandchildren, 13 great-great grandchildren and two more expected arrivals and many nieces and nephews as well as a special “son” Todd Hentschel for whom she was a nanny for many years and always held a special place in her heart. A special thanks to the doctors and staff at Heartland Health Centers and St. Mary’s Hospital for all their support, comfort and care and to Danny from Senior Meals on Wheels who delivered her meals daily and was always concerned for her well-being. The mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Saturday at 10AM at Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, (meet at church) 156 Valley Ave. S.W. with interment in Holy Cross Cemetery. Friends may meet the family at the Heritage Lifestory Funeral Homes- Alt & Shawmut Hills Chapel, 2120 Lake Michigan Dr. NW on Thursday from 7-9PM and on Friday from 2-4 and 7-9PM where the Rosary will be recited Friday evening at 7PM. Memorial contributions may be made to Senior Meals on Wheels, 1279 Cedar NE, 49503 or the charity of one’s choice.
