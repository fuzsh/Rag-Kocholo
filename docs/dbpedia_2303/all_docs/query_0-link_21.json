Palmer in 1854. Palmer's Concert Hall burned to the ground in 1860 and in 1882 a new theater was dedicated on the same site. The elegant Dohany Opera House at 552-556 W. Broadway could seat 1,400 people and showcased a variety of famous performers during the glory days of vaudeville. With the advent of motion pictures, the Dohany Opera House became the Strand Theater and was remodeled in 1927 with a glazed facade and refurbished Moorish interior.\"",
