        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by montanamom\n\nThanks unicron. That's all I needed to know.\n\nIt's a little bit of a shame that ONE post by ONE poster with a jaded view of a town is what gives you \"all\" you needed to know.. . . ..I lived there on and off thru quite a few years and yes..like any town of equal size there are always less desirable areas to live in and there are many degrees of desirable areas to live in above that ... please do a little more research than just this posting here to discern if it's a place you'd like to live...\n\nI've got family in Omaha, and have spent a lot of time in the Omaha/CB area.\n\nThe truth is, Council Bluffs is just a \"different\" kind of place. It's hard to describe. Though there is now a lot of business built up along the Interstate (Lake Manawa & Metro Crossing), anywhere else in Council Bluffs is almost like stepping back in time about 30 years. It's not all bad, but certainly not all good. And anytime I've been in CB, I always have this weird feeling that everybody there is related.\n\nHistorically, Council Bluffs is a river & railroad town. Lower economic strata, and tending to be pretty dirty. A lot of people refer to it as Omaha's Trailer Park, or Counciltucky.\n\nCouncil Bluffs has recently turned into a Casino River Town - meaning that the casinos are pouring money into the city, but many of the residents of the city (and Omaha) have \"lost their shirts\" due to gambling. Even so, the casinos have bought the affections of the CB City Council by doing things like forming and funding the Iowa West Foundation, which pours millions of dollars into \"art\" around Council Bluffs. Unfortunately, most of the art is nothing short of hideous, and literally a laughing-stock. Also, bars used to stay open in Co Bluffs later than in Omaha, so you had a huge number of drinkers & gamblers who would drive (about 50% drunk) into Co Bluffs late at night, then drive home (100% drunk) after 2:00 AM.\n\nThat said, there are some newer developments - particularly in the east part of Co Bluffs - that are very nice. That area is up off the flood plane/river bottom, is hilly and wooded, and beautiful.\n\nCouncil Bluffs has come a long way forward in the last 10 years. However, if I were to move into the area, I'd choose to live just about anywhere BUT Co Bluffs. If you want an urban feel, live in near-downtown Omaha. If you want \"white\" Suburbs, live in West Omaha. If you want a more spread-out, slightly rural feel, live in Bellevue or Papillion. If you want country, live in the country."
