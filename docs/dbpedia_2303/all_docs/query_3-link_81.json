Have an account? .\n\nThough \"Yellowstone\" has filmed in Texas, Oregon, and Utah, many locations really are in Montana.\n\nAs a native Montanan, I decided to visit several filming locations scattered across the state.\n\nFrom the Dutton Ranch to the infamous \"train station,\" here's how reality compares to the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a native Montanan, I recently set off to see what \"Yellowstone\" locations looked like in real life.\n\nI'd put off watching \"Yellowstone\" long enough.\n\nI was born and raised in Montana, and any mention I've made of my home state for the past five years has been met with questions along the lines of: \"Is it like 'Yellowstone'?\"\n\nIn short, no. The modern-day Western drama, with five seasons of blatant and unapologetic lawlessness, is a stark contrast with the sleepy state I grew up in. Centered on the Dutton family, led by the patriarch John, \"Yellowstone\" boasts a cast that will do anything for its dynasty: the largest ranch in Montana. Think \"Succession,\" but with more cowboy hats.\n\nBut with the current season airing while I was home for the holidays, I figured it was time to settle in and learn about my culture. And within a few episodes, I realized the TV show and the state did actually have a few things in common: settings.\n\nThough some scenes are shot in Texas, Oregon, and Utah, many of the show's locations really are scattered across Montana's varied countryside — including the infamous Yellowstone Dutton Ranch. So I set out to see some of the locations for myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn real life, many of the locations in \"Yellowstone\" are nowhere near Yellowstone National Park — or one another.\n\nMost scenes in \"Yellowstone\" are, ostensibly, within a few miles of one another. The Yellowstone Dutton Ranch — the family's home and the place where much of the show's action takes place — is bordered by Yellowstone National Park and the fictional Broken Rock Indian Reservation and is near Bozeman, Montana.\n\nReality paints a different picture.\n\nThe Dutton Ranch is nowhere near Bozeman, or Yellowstone. To drive to Bozeman would take 3 ½ hours, while the closest entrance to Yellowstone National Park is about 4 ½ hours away — making it a bit trickier for characters to have quick trips to \"the park.\"\n\nAnd if John Dutton wanted to visit his son Kayce at his home on the Broken Rock Indian Reservation — filmed on Montana's Crow Reservation — it would take him about six hours and 43 minutes to drive there.\n\nIt took about 10 hours from my home in Helena to visit each of the filming locations listed below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor's office, which is filmed in the state's capitol, is just as opulent as it looks on TV.\n\nOne of the first scenes in season one, episode one, takes place in the governor's office, a setting I instantly recognized as the Montana State Capitol.\n\nIn this scene, viewers are introduced to Jamie Dutton, John Dutton's adopted son, who works as an attorney. Throughout the first few seasons, members of the Dutton family are frequently seen in and about the governor's office.\n\nBoth inside and out, I thought this location looked the same in person as it did on TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Yellowstone Dutton Ranch is a real, working ranch in Darby, Montana.\n\nThe Yellowstone Dutton Ranch is a real place — and cabins on the property can be rented out for $1,200 to $1,500 a night. The real-life ranch is called the Chief Joseph Ranch and is in Darby, a small town in western Montana.\n\nWhile renting a cabin was out of the budget this time, the Chief Joseph Ranch can be seen from the road, so I went to check it out.\n\nWhen I pulled off the highway, I was disappointed by how little of the ranch could be seen. From behind a large gate, I could see a sign welcoming visitors to the \"Yellowstone Dutton Ranch.\" Beyond that, though, little was in view other than the tops of a few white barns, including one bearing the Dutton brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Duttons solve several of their problems at the \"train station,\" where they commit murder and dump the bodies of unruly foes.\n\nThroughout the show, the Duttons and Rip, a cowboy on the ranch, dump bodies at the \"train station,\" an overlook that's said to be a few miles over the Wyoming border.\n\nIn reality, according to Montana's Glacier Country blog, the train station is a highway pullout near Sula, a small town about 15 minutes from the Chief Joseph Ranch — which would make it more time-efficient for body dumping, albeit less discreet.\n\nThe setting is the same as any highway turnout area, making it far more conspicuous than I had imagined. A few other cars were parked there when I arrived, hammering home that this would not be an ideal place for the Duttons to commit murder.\n\nStill, with a river running below it and mountains on either side, the spot made for a beautiful view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the fourth season, a group of activists holds a rally outside the Livestock Association's Livingston Field Office.\n\nIn reality, the \"field office\" is actually a building at the intersection of Woody Street and Railroad Street in Missoula, about 3 ½ hours from Livingston.\n\nI noticed the real building was missing a sign that was present in the show. Other than that, the location looks nearly identical to its portrayal in the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn season four, a holdup, followed by a shootout, takes place at Ruby's Cafe in Missoula.\n\nIn the fourth season, John Dutton and the cowboy Rip arrive at Ruby's Cafe to find that robbers are holding the place up. A shootout follows after the two sneak in the back, leaving the robbers — and the sheriff — dead.\n\nWhen I stopped by the greasy spoon for bottomless coffee and a stack of buttermilk pancakes, I found a café that looked essentially identical to its fictional counterpart. The decor was the same, down to a whiteboard displaying the breakfast specials and dessert menu.\n\nRuby's is the kind of joint one comes to expect from a hometown diner: cozy and intimate, and bustling even on a weekday morning. In fact, a waitress told me they'd seen a dramatic difference in patronage since the episode aired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Dutton buys Jamie's paternal father a steak at Glen's Cafe in Florence, Montana.\n\nIn season four, John Dutton runs into Jamie's biological father, Garrett, at Glen's Cafe. In the episode, John tells Garrett to enjoy \"the best Salisbury state in Montana, because you never know which meal will be your last.\"\n\nI stopped by Glen's in Florence, a small town about 20 miles south of Missoula. And while I didn't order a steak to confirm its accolades, the café has started selling T-shirts modeled after those worn in the show — so I picked one up for $30.\n\nThe cafe looks just as it was portrayed in the series, with a few diners nibbling at breakfast. On one wall, Glen's even boasts a shelf of \"Yellowstone\" memorabilia: a framed photo of Kevin Costner sitting at the bar, and a framed Glen's Cafe T-shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Dutton is sworn in as governor at the start of the fifth season. But his inauguration doesn't take place at Montana's capitol; it was actually filmed at the Missoula County Courthouse.\n\nIn season one, the governor's office is shot inside Montana's real-life capitol. In season five, however, \"Yellowstone\" filmed its gubernatorial scenes in the Missoula County Courthouse — which is just a few blocks from the fictional Livestock Association's Livingston Field Office.\n\nIn the first episode of the most recent season, we watch John Dutton being sworn in in front of the \"capitol.\" The frames are tight, so non-Montana natives wouldn't notice the discrepancy. But what you can see — the front of the building — is accurate to real life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nYellowstone Television\n\nAdvertisement"
