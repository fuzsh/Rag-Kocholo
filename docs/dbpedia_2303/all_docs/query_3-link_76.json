        "text": "We love old maps. Their coloration, typography, legends, notations, and sometimes even outdated place names all have a nostalgic quality that gives them a special beauty. If you share our love for vintage maps, youâ€™ll appreciate this State Bird and Flowers Map of the United States by Fritz Hilton from 1965. In remastering this map, we went to great pains to clean it up, eliminating stains, stamps, handwriting, and other signs of map aging. We then reworked it into easily frameable sizes. Because we print them on fine archival paper and canvas, all their original beauty shines through.\n\nFREE SHIPPING on domestic orders over $49 with UPS ground or USPS to PO Boxes.\n\nPaper prints ship within 1-2 business days plus transit time.\n\nFramed Prints ship within 2-3 weeks plus transit time.\n\nFull refund on returns within 30 days of purchase on unframed paper prints. We do NOT ACCEPT returns or exchanges on framed prints or canvas wraps because they are made to order.\n\nClick HERE for more information on shipping and returns\n\nWe use real Walnut for our frames, unlike the lesser quality veneer you will typically find elsewhere. With beautiful hardwood grain, each is handmade to order at a professional frame shop.\n\n7/8 inch face and 1 1/2 inch depth\n\nAcrylite glazing (more clear than glass)\n\nAcid-free backing paper\n\nHanging wire installed"
