        "text": "In 2007, Google began construction of a server farm on the former site of the Council Bluffs drive-in theater on Veterans Memorial Highway. This first phase, completed in 2009, was to create \"200 high quality jobs\". The second Google campus, on Bunge Avenue, had an open house in October 2013, employing 50 people who are \"installing and upgrading Google servers and providing maintenance on equipment\". In March 2014, a third phase, the Southlands expansion, was announced, creating 35 additional jobs and bringing Google's investment up to $1.5 billion, the largest private investment in Iowa's history to date. The state increased its tax abatement of sales and use tax for Google from $9.6 million to $16.8 million. As of July 2014 Google stated it created 130 jobs and as of June 2016 \"over 300 jobs\" on site. In particular, the server farms are backing the entire \"us-central1\" region of the Google Cloud Platform."
