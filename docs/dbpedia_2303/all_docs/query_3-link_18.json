        "text": "Article I of the United States Constitution established the legislative branch known as the Congress. Congress enacts laws that influence the daily lives of all Americans and is intended to serve as the voice of the people. Its responsibilities include funding government functions and programs, holding hearings to inform the legislative process, and oversight of the executive branch.\n\nCongress is a bicameral legislature divided into two equal institutions: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each state sends elected representatives and senators to Congress. Although the House and the Senate are structured differently and have their own roles and responsibilities, they work together to pass legislation. No bill can become a law without passing both houses of Congress. View more information about how a bill becomes a law.\n\nAbout the House of Representatives\n\nThere are 435 members of the House of Representatives. Each state is represented in the House based on its population and has at least one representative. U.S. territories and the District of Columbia are represented in the House by delegates who perform many of the same functions as their colleagues but cannot vote on final passage of legislation. You can find your representative here. Homepage | house.gov\n\nTo be elected to the House of Representatives, a person must be at least 25 years old, a citizen of the United States for seven years or more, and a resident of the state that they represent. Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms.\n\nLearn more about the House of Representatives.\n\nAbout the U.S. Senate\n\nWith each state represented by two senators, a total of 100 members serve in the U.S. Senate. The U.S. territories and the District of Columbia are not represented in the Senate. You can find your two senators here. https://www.senate.gov/\n\nIn order to be elected to the U.S. Senate a person must be at least 30 years old, a citizen of the United States for nine years or more, and a resident of the state that they represent. Senators are elected for six-year terms, and every two years 1/3 of the Senate is up for re-election."
