        "text": "The arms feature a sun symbol, two supporters, and the motto “Excelsior” (“Ever upward”) on a ribbon. The scene depicted under the sun in the coat of arms is a view of the Hudson River. The supporters of the shield are Liberty (with her liberty cap on a staff) and Justice. An American eagle surmounts the globe at the top.\n\nA 17th-century settler named Jonas Bronck, who owned land in what is today the Bronx in New York City, had a coat of arms showing a rising sun. This may have influenced the state seal of New York and its coat of arms, adopted in 1778. Alternatively, the sun symbol may have been selected in honour of the duke of York, who ruled the English colony after 1664. (The sun was the badge of the dukes of York.)\n\nA banner resembling the current state flag was carried by a military unit during the American Revolution (1775–83). In 1858 a similar flag, but with a background of white, was recognized as the state flag. The colour buff (light tan), which was used for facings on New York uniforms during the Revolution, replaced white as a background colour on April 8, 1896, but on April 2, 1901, the original dark blue background was restored. The pattern of the coat of arms was officially specified in 1882, but it is essentially the design first adopted during the Revolution."
