        "text": "SAN DIEGO – The San Diego State lacrosse team is well represented at the World Lacrosse 2024 Women’s U20 Championship Tournament with its head coach, one current player and one former player.\n\nAztec head coach Kylee White is an assistant coach for Team Canada, while rising junior Molly Malone is playing for Team China and former player Julia Masias is the general manager of Team Mexico.\n\nThe event will be hosted by China Hong Kong Lacrosse Association in Hong Kong and will take place from Aug. 15-24.\n\nTeam Canada ranks second in the world in the U20 rankings, and will be in Pool B alongside Haudenosaunee, Korea, Chinese Taipei and Wales. Team China, meanwhile, is in Pool A with top-ranked USA, Germany, Israel and Puerto Rico. Team Mexico is in Pool C with Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Scotland.\n\nWhite, who has been the San Diego State for all 13 years of the program, helped the Aztec to back-to-back MPSF titles in 2018 and 2019. SDSU begins its first season of Big 12 play in 2025. White will be working alongside coaches Emily Boissonneault, Kaylin Morissette and Rachel McKinnon, and head coach Allison Daley.\n\nA native of London, Ontario, Canada, White has played in four IFWLA World Cups for her native country. In 2001 and 2005, she helped Canada achieve a pair of fourth-place finishes. She led the Canadians to their first bronze medal in 27 years in the 2009 World Cup, and propelled them to a silver medal in the 2013 World Cup played in Canada. At the 2005 tournament, she ranked in the top five for caused turnovers per game and was nominated for the All-World team. In November 2016, White was inducted into the London (Ontario) Sports Hall of Fame. She was also an assistant coach of Canada's U-19 team that finished fourth in the 2007 World Championships and played on the inaugural U19 Canadian National Team in 1995 and helped lead the team to a fourth-place finish at the First World Championship.\n\nMalone played in two games last year for San Diego State after playing in nine games at Duquesne in 2023. Macias played four years for the Aztecs from 2017-20, logging two ground balls in 14 games as a defender.\n\nFor more information on the 2024 Women’s U20 Championship, click here: https://worldlacrosse.sport/events/world-championships/2024-world-lacrosse-womens-u20-championship/\n\nOutside of the U20 Championships, alumni Harlowe Steele has made the 2024 World Lacrosse Box Championships for Team Canada. The tournament will take place in Utica, N.Y., from Sept. 20-29. Steele was a four-year player at SDSU from 2016-19, serving as team captain as a senior and earning all-MPSF honors in 2018."
