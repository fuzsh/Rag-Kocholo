        "text": "For Decades Route 6 has followed Broadway through Council Bluffs. Broadway in the downtown area, shown here in a 1960s postcard, is over three miles east of the Missouri River. Broadway between downtown and the river is a quintessential automobile commercial strip. Today, the only U. S. highway it carries is Route 6, but in the past it accomodated four of them (30A, 75, 275, and 6 in the 1940s).\n\nDiscovering intereting old structures and signs is one of the rewards offered to the old highway explorer. Near the place where old Route 6 meets the current 6 is this memory of a farm implement company that has long been out of business. After having been bought-out by White Motor Company in 1960, the last Oliver tractor exited the assembly line in 1976. (August 1999 photo)\n\nFor the traveller entering Iowa from the west this is also a reminder that she or he is entering farm implement manufacturing territory. Among the Iowa cities with major farm implement factories in the past are Charles City (Oliver), Des Moines, Ottumwa, Waterloo, Dubuque, and Davenport. And, of course that traveller should know that the farm implement capital of the world in only 300 miles ahead on Route 6.\n\nThis bronze eagle, which is part of Oakland's Veteran's Memorial, guards the western entrance to downtown. It was sculpted by Russell Christensen. The older road out of town on which this monument now sits was paved with brick. Downtown Oakland features some great nineteenth century buildings, including the 1882 building on the left of the photo on the right. Oakland's historical museum is is worth a visit.
