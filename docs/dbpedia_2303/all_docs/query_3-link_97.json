        "text": "Red light camera facts\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) reviews the images from the cameras for possible violations and mails out notices of liability to vehicle owners.\n\nRegardless of who was driving, the owner of the car is responsible for the ticket.\n\nRed light camera tickets do not result in any points on your driving record.\n\nOnce the light turns red, the camera is automatically activated by sensors that pick up the vehicle crossing over the crosswalk line.\n\nIf you fail to stop, you may be sent a notice of liability in the mail with the picture of your car driving through the red light.\n\nYou can view the evidence against you by logging on to the website printed on the notice of liability.\n\nDOT personnel must issue technician’s certificates certifying the proper operability of the camera on the date of occurrence, along with a confirmation that the vehicle bearing your license plate number was the one that drove through the red light.\n\nMultiple red light camera violations issued at different locations on the same day are each enforceable.\n\nThe photos in the notice of liability will have a black bar above them with certain information:\n\nDate of the violation\n\nViolation time (in military time)\n\nCamera location\n\nElapsed time from when the light turned red (in seconds)\n\nStreet lane that triggered the camera (counted from right to left)\n\nSerial frame of the photo\n\nPhoto sequence: The first photo will show the vehicle passing or entering the crosswalk line while the light was red. The second photo will show the vehicle after it has passed under the traffic signal and through the intersection. The third photo will show a close-up of the vehicle’s license plate.\n\nYou have evidence showing that you drove through the red light because of a health or emergency situation.\n\nYou have evidence showing that you drove through the red light because you were following the instructions of law enforcement personnel.\n\nYou have evidence showing that you drove through the red light because you were part of a funeral procession.\n\nYou have evidence showing that your vehicle or license plate was not the one depicted in the photos.\n\nYou have evidence showing that your vehicle or license plate was stolen or transferred prior to the date and time of the violation.\n\nIf your vehicle was not the only one in the photo, it may be possible that your vehicle was not the one that triggered the camera.\n\nYou may attempt to challenge the proper operability of the camera if you have evidence that the camera malfunctioned at the time of the violation. Ask for the technician’s certificates.\n\nYour evidence shows that the traffic light was broken at the time of occurrence."
