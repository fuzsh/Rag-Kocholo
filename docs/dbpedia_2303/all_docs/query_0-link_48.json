        "text": "Posted June 28, 2021\n\nPosted by: Conservation\n\nPottawattamie Conservation is excited to announce another terrific Speaker Series event this July 8th. This year's events held in partnership with the Council Bluffs Public Library & supported by a grant from Humanities Iowa, a state-based affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nOur program is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, July 8th & will be held in meeting room B at the Council Bluffs Public Library located at 400 Willow Avenue in Council Bluffs. This event is open to participants age 14 & over & is presented free of charge.\n\nClick Here for More Information & to Register Online\n\nOur speaker is Kathy Fiscus, she will guide our exploration of Iowa's Loess Hills through art and storytelling using the lenses of archaeological, geological and fossil records!\n\nGet to know our July speaker & get ready to meet her on July 8th!\n\nKathy devotes much of her time researching and painting the Loess Hills National Scenic Byway from the perspective of archaeological, geological and fossil records. Most of her Loess Hills paintings depict 13,000-5,000 years ago. She also paints nature scenes including sunsets and sunrises, trees and Iowa landscapes.\n\nWhat sparked your interest in conservation and the Loess Hills?\n\nWhile I was working at the Council Bluffs Convention and Visitors Bureau, I often engaged with Conservation staff. I was attending a public meeting where Chad Graeve explained about the extensive root system of native prairie plants. I was fascinated and wanted to learn more.\n\nYou are presenting at the speaker series coming up on July 8 what are some highlights we can expect at your presentation?\n\nOften images of prehistory Loess Hills are black and white photographs or pencil sketches. My presentation is an explosion of color. I explain how the Loess Hills were formed and I emphasize the fragile nature of the hills.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of your work?\n\nI love imagining the appearance of prehistory Loess Hills humans, plants, and animals while trying to remain scientifically accurate.\n\nIf you only had a minute or two to inspire or encourage people to care about the Loess Hills, what would you tell them?\n\nWhile Loess is everywhere, Iowa has the ONLY Loess Hills National Scenic Byway. Early explorers were amazed by the appearances, the vistas, and the oddities of the Loess Hills. You will be impressed if you just visit the hills.\n\nAre there any suggested books or publications you would suggest, for participants who are interested in learning more prior the event in July?\n\nLand of the Fragile Giants: Landscapes, Environments, and Peoples of the Loess Hills by Cornelia F. Mutel (Editor)\n\nWhat is one piece of knowledge you would like everyone you interact with to know?\n\nThe only other place in the world where Loess soil is as deep as in western Iowa is China, and China has experienced dramatic erosion of their Loess. Our Loess Hills are a rare, unique landform which we should promote, protect, and preserve.\n\nWhat is the greatest lesson you have learned from your work?\n\nNature is constantly evolving, often so slowly we don't notice. But the changes Iowa has experienced over the last 20 thousand years or so is hard to imagine."
