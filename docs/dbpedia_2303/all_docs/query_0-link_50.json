        "text": "5.8.4 Westward the Star of Empire Takes Its Way â€” Near Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nEuropean-Americans of the late nineteenth century saw themselves as living in a fundamentally transformative time; change was a major theme of art that depicted frontier settlement as a process of nation building. Progress entailed loss as well as gain, shown here by tree stumps where the wilderness once stood. Melrose painted this picture in celebration of the railroad's arrival in Council Bluffs, suggesting this was a small price to pay for the coming of civilization. In Andrew Melrose's painting, the wilderness on the right side of the image is transformed into a pioneer homestead, as the darkness gives way to the rosy dawn of a new day. Fueling this process is the engine, its headlamp burning bright as it leads the way for future settlers.\n\nHenry George, a famous writer and economist from the nineteenth century, questions the type of progress that the railroad will bring to California. Based on this excerpt of his writing, what is his argument? What does he say the consequences of the railroad might be for the people of California? California is the \"she\" in this quote: \"She will have more people; but among those people will there be so large a proportion of full, true men? She will have more wealth; but will it be so evenly distributed? She will have more luxury and refinement and culture; but will she have such general comfort, so little squalor and misery; so little of the grinding, hopeless poverty that chills and cramps the souls of men, and converts them into brutes?... \" How does an argument like this help us to better understand some of the concerns about a rapidly growing and changing nation?\n\nHenry George settled in California in 1858, where he became involved in journalism and politics. This article, which was reprinted in the San Francisco Times, was widely read at the time. George is most well known for advocating for a single tax on landowners as an economic solution to inequality. Based on this excerpt, encourage a discussion with your students in which they reflect upon who George positions as \"the people\" of California, and who was left out of his definition (women, native peoples, Asians, etc. )."
