        "text": "Levee Alignment A Accreditation\n\nUNDERWAY\n\nCoordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is underway for accreditation of the northwest portion of the City’s levee system. Documentation has been developed for a segment of the Missouri River levee system starting at Big Lake Park and running west and south to the Western Historic Trails Center (south of Interstate 80). Once this is documentation is accepted, this segment of levee will be officially documented as accredited on FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). Documentation for other segments of levee in Council Bluffs will be coordinated with FEMA once construction of necessary improvements is complete.\n\nLevee Underseepage Control Project Improvement (Geotechnical MR_3)\n\nCONSTRUCTION UNDERWAY\n\nThe project will replace existing levee underseepage control features. Twelve relief wells will be decommissioned and replaced with a seepage sand berm measuring approximately 3,500 feet in length and ranging in width from 150 feet to 300 feet. The sand berm will partially be constructed utilizing existing sand berm material on-site placed during the 2011 flood. Over 65,000 cubic yards of additional sand for the project will be sourced from material dredged from Lake Manawa.\n\nLevee Underseepage Control Project Improvement (Geotechnical MR_4)\n\nCONSTRUCTION UNDERWAY\n\nThe project will replace existing levee underseepage control features. Ten relief wells will be decommissioned and replaced with a seepage sand berm measuring approximately 4,700 feet in length and 400-feet in width. The sand berm will partially be constructed utilizing existing sand berm material on-site placed during the 2011 flood. Over 375,000 cubic yards of additional sand berm material will be sourced from material dredged from Lake Manawa.\n\nLevee Underseepage Control Project Improvement (Geotechnical MR_5)\n\nCOMPLETED IN 2020\n\nThe project replaced existing levee underseepage control features. Seven relief wells were decommissioned and replaced with a seepage sand berm measuring approximately 1,500 feet in length and 275 feet in width . The sand berm was partially constructed utilizing existing sand berm material on-site placed during the 2011 flood. Over 40,000 cubic yards of additional sand berm material was hauled to site to complete the berm.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nLake Manawa Sand Dredging\n\nCOMPLETED IN 2020\n\nThe city partnered with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) to complete a dredging project at Lake Manawa. While the dredging project is beneficial to the lake, the dredged sand will serve as an important material source for construction of planned sand seepage berms. A grand total of 519,805 cubic yards of sand suitable for seepage berms was successfully dredged from the lake.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nLevee Underseepage Control Improvement (Geotechnical MR_1)\n\nCompleted in 2016\n\nThe project replaced existing levee underseepage control features. Twenty one original relief wells were replaced with a pervious toe trench with collector pipe system. The pervious toe trench is supplemented with a sand berm. The sand berm was partially constructed utilizing existing sand berm material on-site placed during the 2011 flood.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nLevee Underseepage Control Improvement (Geotechnical MR_2)\n\nCompleted\n\nThe project modified the existing relief well system by retrofitting the system with a buried discharge pipe system to collect flow from the relief wells. A groundwater sump was constructed to collect and allow for pumping of flow collected from the relief wells.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nLevee Underseepage Control Improvement (Geotechnical MR_7)\n\ncompleted\n\nThe project replaced existing levee underseepage control features. Seven new relief wells were installed to replace seven original relief wells. A stability and seepage sand berm was installed to supplement the relief wells. The sand berm was constructed utilizing existing sand berm material on-site placed during the 2011 flood.\n\nREAD MORE"
