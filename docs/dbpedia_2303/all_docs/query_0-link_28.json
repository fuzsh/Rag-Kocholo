Iowa artist, Grant Wood, best known for his work \"American Gothic,\" was commissioned by hotel magnate Eugene Eppley in 1927 to create two murals at the new Hotel Chieftain in Council Bluffs, titled the “Corn Room” and “Early Days of Kanesville”. The 19-foot-by-6-foot mural “Early Days of Kanesville” was based on paintings and sketches by George Simons, the first artist to call Council Bluffs his home. Simons worked as a cook for the surveying party of railroad pioneer Grenville Dodge. Between meals, Simons made drawings which provided the earliest pictorial record of Council Bluffs during the early 1850s, documenting the landscape as it appeared in pioneer times.\n\nRICHARD & DEANNA MILLER GRANT WOOD GALLERY\n\nGrant Wood Corn Room Murals\n\nExplore the artwork of and Grant Wood in this permanent exhibition.
