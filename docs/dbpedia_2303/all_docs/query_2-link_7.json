        "text": "The city of Council Bluffs is located in Pottawattamie county in southwestern Iowa. It lies on the Missouri River across from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe city is a major transportation hub. There is some industry (cast-iron pipe, processed foods), and casino gambling is now important for the economy. Iowa Western Community College–Council Bluffs Campus opened in 1967. Railroad engineer Grenville Mellen Dodge’s restored Victorian-style home (1869) is open for tours. Lake Manawa State Park is in the southern part of the city.\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the area of modern-day Council Bluffs in 1804 and held consultations with the Oto and Missouri Indians at a place called Council Hill or Council Bluff; a monument commemorates this meeting. Several trading posts were established at the original site against the bluffs along the riverbank, which was settled by Mormons in 1846 and was variously called Miller’s Hollow and Council Point. In 1848 it was renamed Kanesville to honor Colonel Thomas Kane, who had aided the Mormons in their migrations."
