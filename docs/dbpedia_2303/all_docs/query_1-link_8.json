        "text": "In celebration of National Travel and Tourism Week, we are looking at some exciting things coming to Council Bluffs that will enhance the experience of travelers and residents alike!\n\nBelles' Play Garden\n\nComing soon to Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park, Belles' Play Garden, features a series of Missouri River-inspired play and educational elements, interpretive seating and surface textures, and rich native plantings. The focal point is a 15-foot pelican play feature with climbing structures, a slide, intimate enclosures, and a lookout perch with sweeping views of the Omaha skyline and Missouri River banks.\n\nStay tuned for the opening date!\n\nLearn More\n\nAdventure Tower at River's Edge Park\n\nThe MidAmerican Energy Adventure Tower is coming to Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park! The tower will be a 138-foot-tall observation tower with numerous platforms that take visitors above the tree line to experience the Missouri River valley, Loess Hills, and a view of the Omaha metropolitan area. The tower will also include an adventure course with a 50’ outdoor climbing wall, simulated caving experiences, and a roll-glide ride!\n\nLearn More\n\nFirst Ave: Multi-Use Trail\n\nFirst Avenue, a former railroad corridor, is a 66’ wide right of way stretching from I-29 in the west to Indian Creek in the east, and it is currently under development. This section of town is transforming into a walkable and attractive urban streetscape that features a multi-modal recreational trail with open plaza areas. The path fills an important gap in the city’s extensive trail system and allows visitors and residents to experience Council Bluffs differently!\n\nThe northern side of the trail is being preserved for future features that would connect downtown Council Bluffs to downtown Omaha, opening up more of the metro for visitors and residents to explore.\n\nLearn More\n\nPottawattamie County Purchased Mt. Crescent Ski Area\n\nAnnounced in January, Pottawattamie County is the new owner of Mt. Crescent Ski Area in Honey Creek, Iowa. Once management has been transitioned, the County plans to explore options for further recreational development. This purchase will allow the County to continue to support conservation and recreation in Pottawattamie County for years to come!\n\nLearn More\n\nCouncil Bluffs continues to transform into a more vibrant community with enormous potential! We can’t wait for these new developments to be finalized, allowing more opportunities and experiences for residents and visitors in CB."
