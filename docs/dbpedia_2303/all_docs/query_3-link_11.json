        "text": "State Animals of the USA Map Wall Art\n\nThis illustrated map shows the official state animals of the USA. I love drawing animals, I love drawing maps and on the several visits I’ve made to the country, I love the United States. So creating this map was indeed a labour of love.\n\nThe United States map includes each state name, each state capital and a hand-drawn icon of the state animal or mammal. Some American states share the same animal for their animal symbol. For example, the whitetail deer is the state animal for over 10 states.\n\nThe Black Bear – State Animal of Alabama, Louisiana, New Mexico, West Virginia\n\nThe American States which have chosen the Black Bear as their state animal are Alabama, Louisiana, New Mexico and West Virginia *.\n\nBlack bears are clever, shy, and low-key animals. An encounter with them in the wild is a rare and exciting experience. These versatile creatures, scientifically known as Ursus Americanus, are not always black; they can also be cinnamon, white, beige, or even “blue” (slate gray).\n\nThey are quite the athlete, with the ability to run up to 30mph and to swim adeptly in rivers and lakes. They are solitary by nature and as cubs, they stay with their mummy bear until their second summer.\n\n* Minnesota is currently proposing the black bear as a potential state animal (along with white-tailed deer and the eastern wolf. They have not yet been officially adopted)\n\nThe Ringtail – State Animal of Arizona\n\nArizona’s ringtail, a fascinating creature, resembles a small fox with a long, raccoon-like tail. With its large, expressive eyes, Zorro-style mask and distinctive ringed tail, the Ringtail is a beloved symbol of the Arizona desert.\n\nThe ringtail’s most distinctive feature is its long, black-and-white “ringed” tail, with 14–16 stripes—about the same length as its body.\n\nEquipped for climbing and hunting, ringtails play an important role in the Arizona ecosystem. These agile climbers help by controlling rodent populations and dispersing seeds.\n\nDespite its nickname “ringtail cat,” it’s not related to cats at all; instead, its closest relatives are the coati and raccoon.\n\nRocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep – State Animal of Colorado\n\nMeet Colorado’s official state animal, the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep! Known for their impressive curved horns and their remarkable agility and balance.\n\nThese bighorns (scientific name Ovis canadensis) are found in the rugged Rocky Mountains, typically above the tree line in the high-altitude regions of the Rockies.\n\nUnlike deer and elk, whose antlers are shed annually, bighorn horns grow continuously throughout their lives, with a single pair weighing close to 13 kg (approximately 30 pounds).\n\nAs with so many other animals, their population declined due to overhunting and from diseases introduced by non-native animals. However, conservation efforts are helping to preserve these beautiful and unusual sheep.\n\nThe American Bison – State Animal of Kansas, Oklahoma, Wyoming. Official national mammal of the United States.\n\nThe American bison, sometimes known as “buffalo,” is a true icon of the American West. These gentle giants once roamed the Great Plains in vast herds, numbering in the millions.\n\nThey are not only the state animal of Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming, but also hold special significance as the national mammal of the United States, since 2016.\n\nThey played a vital role in the lives of Native American tribes, providing them with food, shelter, clothing, and a deep spiritual connection. Sadly, European settlers hunted bison to near extinction in the 19th century, driven by a desire for their hides and a misguided belief that they were a threat to cattle ranching. By 1889, only a few hundred bison remained.\n\nBut, thanks to conservation efforts, the American bison has made a remarkable comeback. Today, there are an estimated 500,000 bison in North America, and their numbers continue to grow. These majestic creatures are a symbol of resilience and hope, reminding us of the importance of protecting the planet’s natural heritage.\n\nThe Moose – State Animal of Alaska & Maine\n\nThe Moose holds the distinction of being the official state land mammal of both Alaska and Maine. In Alaska, this choice is fitting considering the state’s vast wilderness and abundant wildlife.\n\nMoose are not only admired for their size and beauty but also respected as a vital part of the ecosystem and a key resource for subsistence living. With their large populations roaming the forests and tundra, Moose are deeply intertwined with Alaska’s identity and way of life, making them a natural choice for state representation alongside the iconic grizzly bear.\n\nIn Maine, the Moose is equally significant. Maine is the only eastern state to have a sizable moose population. The moose sub-species found in Maine is known as Taiga Moose (Alces alces). They are calm yet fierce animals, embodying the spirit of the state.\n\nThe Nokoto Horse – State Animal of North Dakota\n\nThe Nokota horse holds a special place in North Dakota’s heart and serves as the honorary equine (horse) of the state. The name “Nokota” is linked to the Native American Nakota people, who inhabited the North and South Dakota regions\n\nNokota horses embody a blend of intelligence, resilience, and sociability, making them a fascinating and versatile breed.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the Nokota horse population was nearly wiped out due to efforts by ranchers, state, and federal agencies to reduce competition for livestock grazing. However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park was established in the 1940s, a few Nokota bands were inadvertently trapped inside the park, accidentally preserving them\n\nToday there is an active Nokota Horse Conservancy organisation ensuring the survival of these fabulous horses.\n\nThe Grizzly Bear – State Animal of California\n\nWhile the grizzly bear once roamed freely throughout California’s rugged landscapes, sadly it is now extinct within the state.\n\nHistorically, grizzly bears were revered by Native American tribes as symbols of strength, courage, and wisdom, and their presence shaped the ecological balance of California’s ecosystems. Due to hunting, persecution, habitat loss, and a lack of legal protection, the survival of grizzly bears was not ensured. These powerful beautiful animals had vanished from the state by the late 1800s.\n\nToday, the memory of the California grizzly lives on in historical records, art, and the state flag, serving as a reminder of the need for conservation efforts to prevent the loss of other iconic species.\n\nThe Beaver – State Animal of Oregon and New York\n\nThe beaver, renowned for its industrious nature and remarkable engineering skills, holds the esteemed title of state animal in Oregon and New York.\n\nBeavers exemplify industriousness, environmental impact, and interconnectedness within ecosystems. Their ability to engineer intricate dams and lodges has left a lasting legacy in Oregon’s history, earning the state the nickname “The Beaver State.”\n\nSimilarly, in New York, the beaver holds a special place as a symbol of the state’s pioneering spirit and resilience. Beavers role as a keystone species underscores both states commitment to conservation and responsible stewardship.\n\nThe Desert Big Horn Sheep – State Animal of Nevada\n\nThe desert bighorn sheep, with its majestic horns and rugged adaptability, proudly stands as the state animal of Nevada.\n\nThese iconic creatures are perfectly suited to the arid and rocky landscapes of the state’s deserts and mountains. Revered for their strength, agility, and resilience, desert bighorn sheep symbolize the wild spirit of Nevada’s untamed wilderness.\n\nThese majestic creatures represent the enduring legacy of the American West as they navigate cliffs and harsh terrain.\n\nThe magnificent horns of these animals can grow up to three feet in length, serving dual purposes of breaking open cacti, which they eat, and for self-defence."
