        "text": "Context counts. That’s especially true when it comes to a soon-to-close exhibition at the Foothills Art Center:\n\n“Masterpieces of Colorado – A Rich Legacy of Landscape Painting.”\n\nThe show’s accompanying catalog is a keeper, beautifully laying out the history of the state’s landscape painting tradition, with helpful timelines and biographies of the major artists along the way.\n\nBut inexplicably, this wonderful context is nowhere to be found in the exhibition other than the basic labels. Instead, viewers are apparently expected to fend for themselves. If they know what they are seeing, great. If not, well, tough.\n\nNot helping matters is the unflattering installation. The works are hung in a vaguely chronological arrangement, but there is no attempt to trace influences or make connections among the selections.\n\nTracy Felix’s stylized, almost cartoonish “Twin Peaks,” for example, seems lost among the incongruously neo-realist pieces that surround it. Why not group it with some of the other contemporary works that take a less traditional tack?\n\nIt would also have been interesting to see Charles Ragland Bunnell’s “Cripple Creek Mine” (1936), a stark scene of an early 20th-century mining landscape, next to Charles Forsman’s pointed “American Fable,” fancifully depicting a housing subdivision balanced on a hillside stripped bare by mining activities.\n\nIf the show’s display raises no shortage of questions, there is much to praise about the selections themselves, especially the historical works. With few exceptions, guest curator Rose Glaser Fredrick has found first-rate examples by the 41 artists highlighted, drawing on a variety of public and private collections.\n\nNotable older pieces include:\n\nHelen Henderson Chain, “Mount of the Holy Cross” (circa 1879). It would be easy to mistake this small, virtuosic work as a copy of Thomas Moran’s better-known depiction (on display as well), but it was painted some two decades earlier and is a worthy counterpart.\n\nRobert Reid, “Broadmoor at Night” (date unknown). This prominent American Impressionist created a nuanced, luminous nighttime view of the quickly recognizable Broadmoor, an upscale resort in Colorado Springs.\n\nErnest Lawson, “Waterfall, Colorado” (circa 1927). Best known as a member of the Ashcan School, Lawson spent four summers in Colorado, creating mountain scenes, such as this tiny one, with its impastoed surface and flurry of restless brush strokes.\n\nIt would have been nice to see an example by Boulder artist Eve Marie Drewelowe. Her “Swinging Saplings” was a highlight of a similar landscape show at the Loveland Museum/Gallery in 2001-02.\n\nFor the 16 contemporary artists included, Fredrick deliberately emphasized what she cites as a “return to realism.” While this choice can certainly be justified, it’s hard not to wish for more works in a conceptual, avant-garde vein.\n\nOne such example that did make the cut is Don Stinson’s cleverly deceptive “Ice Park at Ouray.” At first, it appears as a straightforward, spectacular depiction of a natural scene until it becomes clear that it is a man-made waterfall – a reality that gives the scene a welcome added dimension.\n\nIt also might have made sense to include more works that deal with the human forces dramatically altering the Colorado landscape, everything from global warming to the rapid incursion of development. Too often, the included artists simply act as though man is not even present.\n\nThe exhibition, which will travel to four more venues, was organized by the Foothills Art Center and marks the 40th anniversary of the Colorado Council on the Arts.\n\nIt is not surprising that the council would choose such a populist, non-adventuresome project to mark this milestone, given today’s goal that government arts agencies be as inoffensive as possible.\n\nFine arts critic Kyle MacMillan can be reached at 303-954-1675 or kmacmillan@denverpost.com.\n\n| Masterpieces of Colorado\n\nAn exhibition of nearly 70 paintings and original prints depicting Colorado scenes will be at the Foothills Art Center, 809 15th St., Golden, through July 8, and then will be shown in other Colorado locations through May 2008.\n\nGOLDEN|10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and 1 to 5 p.m. Sundays|$3, $2 seniors, free for students and members| 303-279-3922 orfoothillsartcenter.org.\n\nGRAND JUNCTION|July 28-Sept. 23, Western Colorado Center for the Arts, 970-243-7337 orgjartcenter.org.\n\nCAÑON CITY|Nov. 9-Dec. 15, Fremont Center for the Arts, 719-275-2790 orfremontarts.org.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS|Dec. 22-Jan. 31, El Pomar Carriage Museum, 719-577-7065 orelpomar.org.\n\nDENVER|Feb. 22-May 23, Denver Central Library, 720-865-1111 ordenverlibrary.org."
