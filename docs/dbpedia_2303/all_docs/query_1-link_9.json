Dodge, before her death in 1916.\n\nSidewalk Mosaics and Streetscape Tiles (Pearl and Main Streets, and West Broadway) Former postcards and history that depict various aspects, persons, and locations in Council Bluffs have been reproduced in ceramic and sidewalk mosaic tiles in downtown Council Bluffs.\n\nUNsculptures Pottawattamie Arts, Culture & Entertainment (PACE) partnered with the City of Council Bluffs to have several art installations placed throughout the city that celebrate how Council Bluffs is UNlike anywhere else.\n\nWestern Historic Trails Center Metal Sculptures This center contains more than 200 metal sculptures by Timothy Woodman to interpret historic pioneer trails.\n\nIowa West Public Art Sites offers even more pieces to check-out throughout the community.\n\nShow More +"
