        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn current United States politics, the association between Democrats and blue, and Republicans and red, is so ubiquitous that it is easy to forget how recently this color mapping emerged. A person flipping through TV channels during a pre-2000 election season might have seen, on one news station, a political forecast map coded Republican-leaning districts or states as blue and Democrat-leaning ones as red, but then the next news station might use red–blue, or orange–green, or no hues at all (Bensen, 2003; Farhi, 2004; Enda, 2012). There was no agreement across news outlets or across election seasons, and if anything, left-leaning political parties had a stronger association with red (e.g., the Communist Party). The Republican-red and Democrat-blue mapping took hold in 2000, as the Bush v. Gore presidential election controversy and vote recounts unfolded over days and weeks and received extensive news coverage. Media outlets covering the election gradually settled on the current party-color mapping, and the associations stuck.\n\nIn just two decades a color-coding system that began as a convenient visualization tool has become a symbol for—and, potentially, a contributor to—the increasing divide between liberals and conservatives. The symbolic dichotomization implies a lack of nuance in political ideology, which in turn might exacerbate the bipartisan divide across political (Baldassarri & Gelman, 2008), geographic (Tam Cho et al., 2013), and virtual (Bail et al., 2018) settings. The existence of “red states” and “blue states” is now taken for granted, though in actuality the U.S. is a quilt of different shades of purple. This was demonstrated by Robert Vandervei, who coined the phrase Purple America after the 2000 presidential elections (Klinkner, 2004). Red and blue have become such essential properties of people’s concepts for Republican and Democrat that on election days, when the parties are made particularly salient, people’s personal color preferences become more aligned with their party affiliation (Schloss & Palmer, 2014). That is, people’s preferences for their political in-group permeates their color preferences, underscoring the strength of the association between parties and colors.\n\nDepicting the U.S. using a dichotomous color mapping simplifies complex voting patterns (see Fig. A), but it can also alter the ways in which people construe partisan politics, potentially further polarizing people’s estimates of voting outcomes. Color facilitates categorization (Oliva & Schyns, 1996) and grouping of objects (Goldstone & Hendrickson, 2010; Makovski & Jiang, 2009; Wertheimer, 1923), so people can look at a color-coded map and quickly extract information. But maps utilizing the red–blue categorization have a significant drawback. Prior work shows that dichotomizing a political map using two hues, red and blue, rather than a continuous hue gradient (from red to blue, through purple), leads people to overestimate within-state political homogeneity and nation-wide political polarization (Rutchick et al., 2009). In other words, people assume “blue states” must be substantially more Democratic and liberal than “red states”, when in fact they could be just a few percentage points apart. This exaggeration occurs because a categorical classification scale is applied to a continuous feature (e.g., the percent of voters in a geographic region that hold a particular opinion), which causes people to hold more categorical representations of the feature (Szafir et al., 2016). People may then represent residents of “red states” and “blue states” as more different from each other than they actually are, potentially exacerbating harmful stereotypes about “liberal bubble states” and conservative “flyover country.”\n\nAs depicted in Fig. , there are multiple ways of using continuous gradations of color to represent a variable of interest (e.g., the percent of votes that went to a given candidate, or the percent of voters who endorse a position). Sticking with the red–blue representation, such a map could use a hue gradient that passes from pure red, through purple (the result of combining red and blue), to pure blue (Rutchick et al., 2009). This would result in a map of various hues that capture the continuous distribution of voting patterns, as discussed in the previous paragraph (see Fig. B). However, these purple maps make it challenging to interpret the outcome of a winner-takes-all electoral college system, where a single percentage point can decide whether an entire state goes to the Republican or Democratic candidate. For such an election system, it is useful to represent the actual or likely winner of a district or state, as well as the margin by which they won or are expected to win. One way to maintain the continuous representation supported by red–purple–blue maps, while illustrating the categorical outcome of a winner-take-all system, is to use a divergent map with two hues interpolated through an achromatic color, like white (see Fig. C). This visualization method avoids the muddiness of purple shades, but it is yet unknown whether they eliminate the categorical effects of hue on people’s judgments of polarization (Jacobson, 2016).\n\nIn two studies, we asked whether dichotomizing maps into red and blue states leads people to overestimate polarization compared to maps that represent voting patterns using a continuous gradation from red to white to blue. We also investigated the effects of prior color-concept associations by testing whether maps designed with novel, non-party hues (orange/green) decrease perceived voting polarization compared to the traditionally conditioned associations of red/blue hues with US political parties.\n\nWe tested three hypotheses across two pre-registered studies. The first hypothesis was that hues associated with political parties (red/blue) increase perceived voting polarization compared to previously non-associated hues (orange/green) or uniform grey. The second hypothesis was that dichotomous color maps increase perceived voting polarization compared to continuous color maps. The third hypothesis was that the effect of dichotomous and continuous color maps depends on whether the hues had prior political associations (i.e., an interaction effect). The two experiments tested the same three hypotheses, under two different contexts. In Study 1 participant predicted future voting patterns of swing states for which there were thus no clear base rates on which they could base their responses. In Study 2 participants recalled results from the 2020 presidential election for a random subset of all 50 states to determine whether the effects only applied to swing states. Study 2 also tested a possible consequence of perceiving red and blue states to be highly polarized: thinking that a single vote in those states will matter less.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs hypothesized, participants’ voting predictions were more polarized when maps used party-associated hues (red/blue) compared to arbitrary hues (orange/green). We further found that when people had salient associations between hues and groups (red-Republican and blue-Democratic), continuous maps decreased predicted voting polarization compared to dichotomous maps. When there were no prior conditioned associations (green-Democratic, orange-Republican) dichotomization had no significant effect on predicted voting polarization. Finally, polarization was lessened for uniform grey maps and orange/green maps compared to dichotomous red/blue maps.\n\nIn Study 1, the polarizing effects we observed were driven by the spread (predicted difference between two states of different hues), rather than the clustering (predicted similarity between two states of the same hue). Thus, changing the hue and gradient steps of a political map appear to have greater impact on the predicted between-group difference than on the predicted within-group consistency. We did not find moderating effects of conditions based on political ideology (measured by intended voting choice for the 2020 presidential election) or general concerns about polarization. While people may be concerned with general bipartisan polarization, such a concern does not influence their predictions about voting patterns.\n\nThe present study design has several limitations, which may hinder the generalizability of these findings. (1) We only used swing states and instructed participants to imagine hypothetical candidates in order to limit the influence of participants’ prior knowledge, but we cannot know whether the results generalize beyond states that historically have close voting margins. (2) We let participants freely infer the meaning of the hue pairs used in electoral maps (red/blue and orange/green) to see whether the red-Republican and blue-Democrat association occurs implicitly in contrast to novel hue pairs, but it is therefore not clear whether the novel hue pairs (green/orange) decreased perceived polarization because of their lack of association, or whether they were ignored and participants, due to the uncertainty, selected the mid-point of the scale. (3) We asked participants to estimate voting patterns in a hypothetical future election, so we had no true baseline against which to compare their estimates.\n\nWe designed a second study with the aim of increasing the ecological validity and generalizability of these findings. Study 2 used electoral maps showing actual results from the 2020 Presidential Election and asked participants to estimate the voting margins. Participants were again assigned to view maps showing one of four hue-gradient combinations. Each participant evaluated a subset of 15 States (out of 50 US States). Finally, we explored the influence of hue pairs and gradients on a secondary dependent variable: how much participants thought a single vote matters in each state.\n\nGeneral discussion\n\nTwo decades ago, the United States media chose red to represent a majority of Republican votes and blue to represent a majority of Democratic votes, perhaps without realizing that the dichotomization of the country into states as red or blue would come to mislead the public into over-estimating voting polarization and perceive reduced voting influence. The goal of the present studies was to test the hypothesis that any overestimation of political polarization is in part due to the way the media has chosen to visualize election results on maps. Specifically, we asked whether people perceived voting margins to be more polarized because of their learned associations between blue-Democrat and red-Republican, and/or because red/blue maps dichotomize continuous variability in voting margins. Across two studies, we found that continuous color maps, compared to dichotomous color gradient maps, lead people to make less polarized voting estimates (hypothetical predictions in Study 1 and actual retrospective estimates in Study 2). In Study 2, we showed that dichotomous maps not only lead people to over-estimate how polarized US states were in the 2020 general election, but it also led them to think their votes would have mattered less.\n\nThe significant effect of hue pair (green/orange vs red/blue) that we found in Study 1 did not replicate in Study 2, in which participants were provided a legend that explicitly assigned a political party to each color. This inconsistency suggests that Study 1 participants either did not consistently assign the green/orange hues to Republican or Democrat party during the task, and/or did not pay attention to the hue information on the map. The null effect of Hue Pair in Study 2 suggests that the previously held semantic association between Republican-red and Democrat-blue does not exacerbate perceptions of political polarization when the assignment of parties to colors is explicitly labeled.\n\nInstead, it appears that an information theory account of these findings would suggest that using continuous hue-lightness gradients simply provides more granular information, which in turn helps viewers of the map situate their voting estimates with greater accuracy compared to dichotomous maps. That is, when participants are presented with a dichotomous (red–blue) map and asked to estimate the voting margin for a particular state (e.g., a state represented in red), they can only infer that the voting margin will fall between 51 and 100% for republicans. In contrast, participants presented with a continuous map benefit from additional data granularity provided by the hue-lightness gradient steps (e.g., 50–62.5, 62.5–75, 75–87.5, 87.5–100).\n\nThe abovementioned explanation, would suggest that the observed polarization (i.e., overestimation of voting margin differences) is due to a lack of accuracy driven by the amount of information conveyed by continuous vs dichotomous maps, which would entail that in highly polarized states participants underestimate polarization (i.e., voting margin difference). However, results from study 2 demonstrate that participants in the dichotomous conditions overestimated the margins by which each state was won for almost all states (43 out of 50; see Fig. ). The dichotomous maps could have simply narrowed the range of margins participants estimated without increasing them, but instead they biased participants to systematically overestimate between-state voting polarization.\n\nAn information theory account of this finding would further explain that without any prior information, participants in the dichotomous condition may have guessed the voting margin to be closer to the average estimate of 75.5% (i.e., the middle—between 51 and 100%) which would make their guess higher than most states’ actual voting margins. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the continuous hue-lightness gradient maps did not eliminate the overestimation of polarization, as most states were still judged, on average, to have higher voting margins in the 2020 election than they actually did. This could be due to the presence of any hue variation between states (as opposed to just white) being interpreted as stating a greater difference, which would slightly bias the voting margins upwards for the party associated with that particular hue.\n\nAn alternative explanation for the systematic over-estimation of voting margin polarization could be due to inflated perceptions of political polarization between Republicans and Democrats, which inadvertently leads participants to perceive voting estimates between red and blue states as more polarized than they are in actuality (see Rutchick et al., 2009 for initial findings supporting this hypothesis). Intractable conflict over partisan issues such as healthcare, gun control, and immigration plagues contemporary U.S. politics (Jacobson, 2016; Klein, 2020). This conflict is in part due to increased polarization between Democratic and Republican voters and legislators (Pew Research Center, 2014). However, people also overestimate the true degree of polarization (Westfall et al., 2015). It turns out that the majority of people hold more moderate views than others attribute to them (Blatz & Mercier, 2018; Fiorina & Abrams, 2008; Robinson et al., 1995). And expecting the rest of the population’s attitudes to be polarized, regardless of the true polarity of the population, leads to increased political action, such as attending political rallies and donating money to parties and candidates (Westfall et al., 2015). Polarized perceptions can also escalate conflict (Reeder et al., 2005; Robinson & Friedman, 1995). The concerning implications that stem from exaggerated public perceptions of polarization have increasingly attracted the attention of social scientists (Enders & Armaly, 2019; Lees & Cikara, 2021; Levendusky & Malhotra, 2016; Prior, 2013; Rutchick et al., 2009) and warrant further investigation in influencing perceived voting estimates.\n\nIn sum, an information theory account would suggest that participants’ voting estimates are simply inaccurate due to a lack of data granularity which also leads participants to guess a higher voting average difference, resulting in the polarization of voting margin estimates. In contrast, a polarization account would suggest that political polarization is made particularly salient through the dichotomization of political maps and therefore further polarizes voting margin estimates. Both accounts could be involved in explaining participants' systematic over-estimation of voting polarization, but future research is needed to further distinguish their individual or paired influence on voting estimates.\n\nThe present research also aimed to test a practical solution to reduce perceived voting polarization and increase perceived voting influence. Instead of using continuous purple maps as in prior work (Rutchick et al., 2009), which do not clearly communicate the winning majority party in a particular state, we used a gradient going from red to blue through white, which is more informative given the US state-by-state winner-takes-all election system. Across both studies, we found that using a continuous gradient instead of using dichotomous gradient steps can decrease perceived voting polarization (Study 1 and Study 2), along with increasing perceived voting influence (Study 2). Furthermore, the fact that hue association did not significantly influence perceived voting polarization and perceived voting influence when hue-party assignments were labeled in a legend suggests that political map designers do not need to stray from the commonly used hue schemes to reduce perceived voting polarization and influence.\n\nIn the present studies, we used color as the specified continuous visual feature, because color is typically used to represent election outcomes on maps. However, we suspect the present findings would generalize to any comparison of visual features that are dichotomized versus continuous. Future research could test this hypothesis by varying the type of visual features used to represent election outcomes (e.g., size, texture). The effects of dichotomization may also extend beyond visual features to other means of reporting election outcomes, such as numeric or verbal reports.\n\nIn a time where US. politics appear to be deeply divided; we conducted the present study to draw attention to the ways the usage of color in political maps might play a role in exacerbating polarization. Interestingly, we found that perceived voting polarization is partly driven by the information concealed in the dichotomous representation of continuous data, but is not influenced by the conditioned semantic associations between red/blue and Republican/Democrat political parties when the meanings of colors are labeled. The present results offer a simple way to reduce the polarizing effect of dichotomous color maps and increase perceived voting influence."
