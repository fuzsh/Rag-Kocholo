        "text": "In the heart of the Midwest, nestled along the east bank of the Missouri River, lies the vibrant city of Council Bluffs. Steeped in a rich tapestry of history, the city is a testament to the pioneering spirit that has characterized the American narrative. Council Bluffs was not only a significant hub during the great westward expansion but also played a central role in the birth and growth of the American railroad industry. The city proudly embraces its heritage, inviting visitors to see its historic landmarks along with its vibrant cultural scene. From picturesque parks to insightful museums, Council Bluffs’ attractions narrate the tales of pioneers, adventurers, and innovators who once walked its streets.\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links. At no extra cost to you, I will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.\n\nQuick history of Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nIn its earliest days, the region witnessed the historic Lewis and Clark expedition, which charted a course through unexplored American territories. Their encounter with the Otoe tribe on the bluffs of the Missouri River in 1804 marked the city’s first claim to fame, sowing the seeds of a rich and diverse cultural lineage.\n\nAs pioneers passed through the area, Council Bluffs became a gateway to the western frontier. It was an assembly point for pioneers preparing to embark on their journey across the great plains. This rendezvous point symbolized hope and adventure, attributes that are ingrained in the very fabric of Council Bluffs’ identity even today.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the city further cemented its place in history as a railroad powerhouse. The Union Pacific Railroad, whose museum now stands in downtown Council Bluffs, established its eastern terminus in the city. This monumental development transformed the city into a bustling hub of commerce and innovation, connecting people and places in unprecedented ways.\n\nTop Council Bluffs attractions\n\nThe following 12 attractions are just the beginning of all that the city offers.\n\nUnion Pacific Railroad Museum\n\nThe Union Pacific Railroad Museum features exhibits on the history of the Union Pacific Railroad and its role in the development of the American West. Exhibits cover the construction of the transcontinental railroad through modern times, and there are many interactive elements found throughout. One of the best photo opps is on a life-sized replica of a caboose. The building it’s housed in was originally a Carnegie library. Admission to the museum is free.\n\nTip: For even more trains, visit the Rails West Railroad Museum on the grounds of a former Chicago Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot.\n\nUnion Pacific Railroad Museum, 200 Pearl St., Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nRails West Railroad Museum, 1512 S. Main St., Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nLake Manawa State Park\n\nLake Manawa State Park is one of the most popular parks in western Iowa, offering over 1,500 acres of outdoor recreation opportunities, including hiking, boating, fishing, and swimming. The park features several trails that wind through the woods and along the lake’s shoreline, offering stunning views of the water and surrounding countryside.\n\nOne of the park’s highlights, without a doubt, is Dream Playground. Nearby, there is a small, sandy beach area inside the park. There is an admission fee for the beach.\n\nThe park is free to visit for those with Iowa license plates; it’s $5 for a daily permit for out-of-state visitors. One of the most popular annual events at the park is the Fourth of July fireworks display.\n\nLake Manawa State Park, 1100 South Shore Drive, Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nRiver’s Edge Park\n\nTom Hanafan River’s Edge Park is one of the city’s newest parks along the riverfront near the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, which connects Council Bluffs to Omaha. It’s a busy bridge for walkers and bikers, and has a popular photo opportunity of the state line located at the center of the bridge.\n\nThe park’s public art sculptures stand out, but for families, the highlight is the adorable Belles’ Playgarden and spray ground for young kids. There are plans to build an observation tower and an adventure course at River’s Edge Park.\n\nIn the summer, the park hosts outdoor movies, comedy nights, and festivals.\n\nRiver’s Edge Park, 4200 Ave. B, Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nMid-America Center\n\nMid-America Center is the city’s big arena and events center, where touring productions perform, and conventions are held. Its proximity to Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 is pretty convenient, to boot. Parking is free.\n\nNear the MAC, as I like to call it, there are a few popular restaurants like Quaker Steak and Lube, a movie theater, hotels, casinos, and the Bass Pro Shop.\n\nMid-America Center, 1 Arena Way, Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nBayliss Park\n\nLocated in the heart of downtown Council Bluffs, Bayliss Park has a stunning, modern fountain with a small sprayground, a bandstand, and plenty of green space for playing. There is also a veterans memorial nearby.\n\nIn the summer, there are free weekly concerts held at the park’s pavilion. In May, Celebrate CB festivities are held in the area, with carnival rides and food stands lining the streets around the park.\n\nFun fact: The water patterns of the sprayground duplicate the forms of the large central fountain.\n\nBayliss Park, 100 Pearl St., Council Bluffs, Iowa\n\nHistoric Squirrel Cage Jail Museum\n\nThe Historic Squirrel Cage Jail is the only three-story-tall lazy susan jail structure to still be standing, and it’s a museum now making it a fascinating place to visit. It was built in 1885 and was in use until 1969. You can take a tour of it, and hear stories about notorious prisoners and the rumored hauntings.\n\nThe museum is open Thursday through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. No reservation is needed for the tours.\n\nSquirrel Cage Jail Museum, 226 Pearl St., Council Bluff, Iowa\n\nBregant House\n\nOne of Council Bluffs’ most famous couples, the Bregants, built a custom home in the early 1900s to suit their smaller statue. The home was nicknamed “The Doll House.” Inez and Jean Bregant were popular entertainers in their day, though they were best known as the “Candy Kids” in advertisements for John G. Woodward and Co. At 42 inches and 45 inches tall, they were known as “the little people” in Council Bluffs.\n\nTours last about 30 minutes and cost $5 per person.

On Thursdays nights when the weather permits, hundreds of cyclists gather to bike from Council Bluffs to Mineola for the weekly Taco Ride.\n\nThere is a trail fee charged to help with maintenance.
