        "text": "Hobby Haven in Urbandale\n\nGood Morning,\n\nThis is 2-3 miles from downtown, but well worth the trip. All RR scales, books, scenic materials, etc. I never pass thru Iowa without stopping.\n\nThere's a very nice botanical garden with five climate zones.\n\nA minor league hockey team(Iowa Wild) that plays downtown thru April.\n\nThere's a casino and an amusement park on the Northeast side of town.\n\nI'm sorry, must have been a senior moment for me. House of Trains in Omaha would be the best choice.\n\nJJ&CL\n\nTry JJ&CL Model Train Shop\n\n901 McKenzie Avenue\n\nCounsel Bluffs IA 51503\n\n712-328-6647\n\nYou will need a GPS to find it. or call John first and he will give you good directions.\n\nAlso check out House of Trains at:\n\n8106 Maple St, Omaha, NE 68134\n\nPhone: (402) 934-7245\n\nBoth are very good! And somewhat near the Mid-American Center.\n\nWes\n\nSioux Falls, South Dakota\n\nCouncil Bluffs\n\nFirst of all, welcome to Council Bluffs! I hope you enjoy your stay here.\n\nI second the vote for House of Trains. I've heard good things about JJ&CL, but I've lived in Council Bluffs nearly all of my 49 years, and didn't even know the place existed until not all that long ago. It's in someone's garage on the east side of town. I really need to get out more.\n\nOther things to see:\n\nUP Museum in downtown CB, just a few blocks from my place. Maybe 10 minutes from the MAC.\n\nRailsWest Museum, about a mile south of the UP Museum, in the former RI depot. Includes an HO scale club layout.\n\nGeneral Dodge Museum, just a few blocks SE of the UP Museum. Home of the UP's initial chief design engineer responsible for their route westward.\n\nOmaha Zoo, just across the river from the MAC on I-80. Considered by some to be the best zoo in the world ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/05/travel/tripadvisor-best-zoos/ ). Includes a 1:1 steam-powered narrow gauge passenger railroad that's a great way to relax and take in a few of the zoo's highlights.\n\nUP's Council Bluffs yard is directly north/NW of the MAC and very busy.\n\nIowa Interstate's yard is about 10 minutes east. Daily westbound arrives in darkness, but its eastbound counterpart typically departs in early afternoon. Local industry/yard/transfer action throughout the day.\n\nI hope that helps. Please let me know if you have questions."
