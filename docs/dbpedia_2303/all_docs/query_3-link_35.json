        "text": "When you download an image from Unsplash, you get a license under that contributor copyrights which permits you to broadly use the image without attribution or compensation to the contributor. This is why we say that they are free to use. When Unsplash contributor uploads an image, they agree they have the proper releases, ownership, and permissions needed to permit Unsplash users to use the image freely. It is possible, however, that the use of some images require the permission of someone else. For example, if an image depicts a brand in it, or another copyrighted work (like a work of art, for example), you may need that brand or copyright owner’s permission if you use the image in certain ways. Similarly, if there’s an identifiable person in the image, you may need his or her permission before you can use the image in certain ways.\n\n​\n\nThough we ask all contributors to confirm that they have all the rights needed to provide their images to use and distribute freely to Unsplash users, you are solely responsible to ensure that your use of the images does not violate or infringe third parties’ rights, such as brand owners or individuals depicted in the images, and obtain any necessary permissions from these third parties. When in doubt, it’s best to ask."
