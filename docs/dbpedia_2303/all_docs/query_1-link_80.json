It serves as a way for walkers, runners, and bicyclists to access 150 miles of trails within the metro. The bridge provides impressive views of the Missouri River and downtown Omaha. And…\n\nLocated in historic downtown Council Bluffs, Iowa, on the Missouri River, we’re a great place for friends and family to come and learn about the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nAlmighty, O my friend — but it is too much for my strength — I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!"
