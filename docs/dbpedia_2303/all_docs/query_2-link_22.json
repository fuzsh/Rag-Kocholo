At the time of publication, it represented the best available science.\n\nThe Missouri River served as a vital waterway for transport of the epic Lewis and Clark Expedition. In the vicinity of Omaha, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, this mighty river meanders southward through a broad floodplain some two to eight miles wide, bordered by dissected bluffs. In late July 1804, the expedition paused to rest and repair their boats and planned the “first” Native American council (Council Bluff) with representatives of the Otoe Tribe.\n\nThis photograph was taken by the Expedition 7 crew of the International Space Station on June 13, 2003, and is among the first acquisitions of an ongoing effort to document from space dozens of historical sites along the Lewis and Clark Expedition’s entire route. In this near-vertical view of Omaha—with a population estimated at more than three quarters of a million residents—the city is situated on high ground to the west of the river while Eppley Airfield and the town of Council Bluffs are located on the floodplain."
