Council Bluffs, city, seat (1851) of Pottawattamie county, southwestern Iowa, U.S., on the Missouri River across from Omaha, Nebraska. The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed there in 1804 and held consultations with the Oto and Missouri Indians at a place called Council Hill or Council Bluff; a monument commemorates this meeting. Several trading posts were established at the original site against the bluffs along the riverbank, which was settled by Mormons in 1846 and was variously called Millerâ€™s Hollow and Council Point. In 1848 it was renamed Kanesville to honour Colonel Thomas Kane, who had aided the Mormons in their migrations.

During the Mormon period the town flourished as a stopping place for west-bound gold seekers. After the Mormons left for Utah, the name was changed to Council Bluffs at its incorporation in 1853. Abraham Lincoln met in Council Bluffs with railroad engineer Grenville Mellen Dodge in 1859, and after becoming president he designated the city as the eastern terminus of the Union Pacific Railroad; the event is commemorated by a granite monument. The first railroad reached the city in 1862, and by 1870 five rail lines had converged there.
