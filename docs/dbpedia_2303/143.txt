From Council Blufss Remembered (2004): "The first theater located on the northeast corner of West Broadway and Sixth Street was built by J.M. Palmer in 1854. Palmer's Concert Hall burned to the ground in 1860 and in 1882 a new theater was dedicated on the same site. The elegant Dohany Opera House at 552-556 W. Broadway could seat 1,400 people and showcased a variety of famous performers during the glory days of vaudeville. With the advent of motion pictures, the Dohany Opera House became the Strand Theater and was remodeled in 1927 with a glazed facade and refurbished Moorish interior."
