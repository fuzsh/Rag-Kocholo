        "text": "Welcome to Week 4 of Paris 2024 Sport Weeks. This week, we share everything you need to know about blind football, a physical and technical sport that has been staged at the Paralympics since Athens 2004.\n\nBlind football is men’s five-a-side football adapted for athletes with a vision impairment. Eight teams – Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, France, China, Japan, Colombia and Turkiye – will play for the podium at the foot of Paris’ iconic Eiffel Tower.\n\nBrief history of blind football\n\nSpain are considered the pioneers of blind football, having played the sport since the 1920s. Brazil started developing the sport in the 1960s and held the first national tournament in 1974.\n\nThe sport has been governed by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) since 1996. In 1997, the first IBSA European Championships was held in Barcelona, Spain, while Asuncion, Paraguay, hosted the first American Championships.\n\nOne year later, the first World Championships were held in Brazil. The sport was included at the Paralympics for the first time at Athens 2004 and has been staged at every Games since. Brazil are the only team to have won Paralympic gold, most recently at Tokyo 2020.\n\nWhat to watch in blind football\n\nThe pitch is the same size as FIFA futsal, and kickboards surround the pitch to prevent the ball from going out. The ball has a bell inside that makes a sound when it moves, and players shout “Voy” when they go for the ball to cue other players in the defense or attack.\n\nEach team consists of four outfield players and one goalkeeper. At the Paralympics, outfield players are almost or fully blind and wear eyeshades during matches. Goalkeepers can be sighted or partially sighted and must play in the goalkeeper’s area.\n\nCommunication plays an important role in the sport, and fans are asked to be silent until the ball is out of play, or a goal is scored. Each team has three sighted guides who can give instructions to their respective third of the pitch – the goalkeeper in the defensive third, a coach in the midfield, and a guide in the attacking area.\n\nMemorable Paralympic moments\n\nBlind football has become one of the most popular sports at the Paralympics.\n\nSix countries – Argentina, Brazil, France, Greece, Republic or Korea and Spain - competed at Athens 2004. In the final, Brazil beat Argentina in a penalty shootout, capturing the first of five Paralympic gold medals in the sport.\n\nSince then, Brazil have been invincible, winning every title since. Argentina have earned two silver and two bronze medals, while France, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the People’s Republic of China have earned one silver apiece.\n\nBrazil delighted the home crowd at Rio 2016, defeating Iran in the gold medal match. While Iran ended sixth at London 2012, they put on a strong run in Rio, eliminating Argentina on penalties in the semis.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, Nonato scored the winning goal in the gold medal match, again against rivals Argentina, extending Brazil’s winning streak at the Paralympic Games to 27 matches.\n\nMorocco earned the bronze medal, just five years after finishing last on their Paralympic debut at Rio 2016. Hosts Japan ended fifth at their first Games.\n\nParis 2024 event programme\n\nThe blind football tournament will be held between 1 and 7 September.\n\nTwelve group stage matches will be held from 1-3 September, followed by classification matches and the semi-finals on 5 September. The bronze medal and gold medal matches are scheduled for 7 September.\n\nParis 2024 venue\n\nTeams will step into the spotlight at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, located at the foot of Paris’ iconic landmark."
