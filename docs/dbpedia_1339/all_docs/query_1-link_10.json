        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe skinfold sum total scores were slightly lower and less disperse than those found in the 11-a-side male national football team10 (50.2+12.36) and in professional football players of the top three Spanish national leagues.11\n\nWhen compared, our values have shown to be notably lower than those for the U-21 national male team obtained at the regional headquarters for sports medicine in Castilla and León (46.71+8.23 vs 70.8+25.1 and 65.15+23.73, respectively).\n\nWhen comparing skinfold sum total scores by playing positions, as observed in other studies,12 there are statistically significant differences, with keepers showing higher scores than lastmen ( ).\n\nWith regard to somatotype in futsal playing positions, the highest scores for endomorphs and mesomorphs were found in pivots, whereas in other studies12 keepers showed the highest scores.\n\nOur study population showed to have a markedly different somatotype compared with U-19s, who also practised this sport and had a much higher endomorphic (fat) component (2.80+1.05 vs 1.98) and a much lower mesomorphy (muscle) component (4.23+1.15 vs 5.09+1.03). Our population also showed a lower endomorphy (fat) component than that reported in another study, while scores for muscle component were very similar.\n\nWhen comparing the Spanish male futsal player somatotype with that of other countries, we found Colombian players to have a markedly higher fat component (3.1+1.03), even higher than that of Spanish U-21s, whereas their muscular (mesomorphic) and ectomorphic components were very similar.13 When studying somatotype values in relation to futsal’s different playing positions, our study found pivots to have the highest endomorphic and mesomorphic values, whereas in other papers14 these values where highest in keepers.\n\nThe BMI values for our population have been similar to those found in Iranian players.15\n\nWe agree with other authors who conclude that BMI values are not useful when assessing players’ body composition as they cannot distinguish whether body weight increases are due to an increase in muscle or fat content.16–18 Other authors believe this BMI may be distorted due to the proportionality of sitting height and leg length so that relatively long legs would reduce BMI scores.19\n\nOur study has shown that right-footed players suffer ipsilateral injuries more frequently than left-footed players, whose injuries occur more frequently on the contralateral side. These results are in contrast to those of other authors. Serrano et al 20 found no significant differences between these two variables.\n\nOn a different matter, we have found no statistically significant differences between lesion diagnosis and laterality. Other studies21 specifically assessing ankle sprains do find a correlation between injury and contralateral dominance, justifying so as the dominant limb is used most frequently when dribbling, whereas the non-dominant is used mostly for support. This fact justifies, according to their authors, the fact that both feet are trained in training sessions with a football. The highest frequency of ankle sprains in the non-dominant leg was also found by Ekstrand and Gillquist22 to appear in football players.\n\nAbate et al 23 in their study about the prevalence of patellar and Achilles tendinopathies in futsal also found a stronger prevalence for the non-dominant leg, justifying it by the forementioned reason as well.\n\nMost lesions (67.2%) show an intrinsic aetiology, coinciding almost totally with those values found for the Iranian national team,15 as well as with another Portuguese study23 and some others too,1 19 24–26 on the fact that most extrinsic or traumatic lesions occurred during official matches. Such a fact had already been proven by Hootman et al 27 after analysing 15 team sports practised in the USA between 1998 and 2004.\n\nIn our work, most lesions have occurred in the thigh (ischiocrural muscles), coinciding with the values for lesions found at the U20s championship in Brazil.26 Nevertheless, in studies carried out at three different Futsal World Cup Championships (2000, 2004 and 2008),25 it was the knee followed by the thigh area that suffer most lesions, although in these cases data for official matches were collected, leaving aside training sessions. A study carried out with Portuguese players of varied levels also produced the same findings, with the knee as the most injured site.20\n\nIn a study carried out in several of Iran’s national teams between March 2011 and June 201215, lesions appeared more frequently in the ankle, followed by the knee, and the total number of injuries increased as the level of players studied decreased.\n\nWhen it comes to relating the injured site with the lesion aetiology, our findings agree with those of other studies20 in that most muscle tendon injuries were caused by an intrinsic mechanism, whereas articular and bone injuries appeared due to extrinsic factors.\n\nOver 50% of diagnosed cases were muscle overloads, a fact that Junge and Dvorak25 justify based on the numerous sprints that also include direction changes performed while practising futsal.\n\nOur study findings show to be in contrast with other works that show that sprains,14 mainly in the ankle, or contusions1 21 22 25 were the most common injuries.\n\nSome studies carried out in the 11-a-side football have established a correlation between different lesions and the playing position,28 correlations also found by other authors when referring to keepers.20 Other studies have not found such correlations among the different playing positions in futsal.29\n\nIn reference to the injury diagnosis and the time of appearance of the lesion, we have found statistically significant differences so that injuries by overload occurred during training sessions, whereas contusions were more frequent during matches. Serrano et al 20 in their study with Portuguese futsal players, found—in contrast to our findings—a higher incidence of sprains and contractures during training sessions, whereas the most common injury during matches was muscle-fibre tear.\n\nIn summary, the somatotype values for those players who most frequently received medical assistance was mesomorph dominant (1.98 - 5.09 - 2.14). Pivots showed both the highest fat and muscle content of all players. BMI was not found to be useful when assessing players’ body composition. Right-footed players suffered ipsilateral injuries slightly more frequently, whereas left-footed players suffered contralateral and two-sided injuries slightly more frequently. Most extrinsic injuries (by external traumatism) took place during official matches. The muscles showed to be the most frequently injured structure, with nearly half of all injuries involving them (43.3%); the thigh was the most commonly injured site, followed by the leg (12.6%), knee (10%), back (9.7%), ankle (6.15%) and foot (5.8%). Over 50% of diagnoses were muscle overloads. Almost all injuries took place during training sessions, and in most cases (96.6%) diagnoses were issued after clinical assessment, with no further tests necessary."
