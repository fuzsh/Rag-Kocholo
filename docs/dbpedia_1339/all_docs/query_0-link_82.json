There are no bronze medal bouts in Olympic boxing, and the two losers of the semifinals each receive a bronze medal.\n\nThis was South Korea's first boxing medal since Han Soon-chul won silver in the men's 60kg event in 2012.\n\nEarlier in the day, Pang Chol-mi of North Korea was awarded the first bronze medal in the women's 54kg division, after losing to Chang Yuan of China by a 3-2 decision.\n\nThree of the five judges gave Akbas the edge in the opening round, with the South Korean trying to stand her ground. Im came out more aggressive early in the second round, but ended up losing it 4-1 in judges' scoring.\n\nAkbas once again had a 3-2 edge for the third round and secured a split-decision victory.\n\nSubscribe to us\n\nTwitter"
