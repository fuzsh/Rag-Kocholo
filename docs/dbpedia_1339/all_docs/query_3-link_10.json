        "text": "Two days after the attack, a judge took the unusual step of lifting the anonymity order — the suspect was named as Axel Rudakubana — in a bid to stop further misinformation spreading and the fact that the accused was about to become an adult within days.\n\nBut the decision came too late to reverse the deluge of anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric that had taken off online.\n\n“In this example, there was the thing that everybody wanted to know,” Edelson says. “The information demand was: ‘Was the alleged perpetrator an asylum seeker?’\n\n“There was a lot of demand for that piece of information and there was no legitimate supply of that information. What has happened is we now have a free market for information.\n\n“What that means is, if there is demand, supply will rise up to fulfill that information demand. And if those in the mainstream media are not willing or able to supply that information, other people will.\n\n“People are asking, ‘Why would anyone do this [spread misinformation]?’ It is because there is demand and they are fulfilling that demand — and there are rewards for doing so.”\n\nEdelson says that those spreading misinformation might have been aware that what they were putting out was false but that it reinforced what they hold as a “core belief.”\n\n“They do it because they think there is some core truth that they are getting at with this incorrect fact pattern,” she explains. “It reinforces something that they themselves already believe.”\n\nFar-right in Britain has evolved\n\nMarianna Griffini, a London-based Northeastern expert on extremism, says the far-right in Britain has evolved over time.\n\nCentrally organised groups, such as the anti-Islam English Defence League, have “faded into irrelevance” and instead have been replaced by less defined “movements” that are mostly active online, she states.\n\nAccording to Griffini, the protests seen in the aftermath of the Southport tragedy seem to be less driven by a coherent ideology —such as fascist or neo-Nazi political beliefs — and more by social and economic grievances, particularly felt by those in Britain’s white working-class communities.\n\n“What prompted these people to act was apparently fake news [about the Southport defendant’s identity],” she says. “It appealed to an ideological terrain of carrying grievances, of resentment against the government but also against whoever is different from an ethno-cultural point of view.\n\n“If you ask the protesters, ‘What do you want?’ It would be to drive immigrants out. They want to recreate a homogeneous white Britain, whatever that has come to mean over the past 60 years.”\n\nGriffini points out that the demonstrations have mostly been focused in Brexit-voting areas. The assistant professor in international relations and anthropology says part of what can attract young white males to join these protests is “the appeal of violence.”\n\n“I do not think that they consciously identify with an ideology,” she says. “I’m not sure of the extent to which they are completely aware of the values and principles that they seem to be fighting for.\n\n“This is underground. It is not about canvassing or going door-to-door; it is not about organizing a town hall meeting. It is not about doing politics according to its true meaning — to deliberate, discuss, compromise and have dialogue.\n\n“It is instead something that is behind the curtain and beyond what is permitted in the political mainstream, which does not allow for activism to become extreme, violent or even terrorism.”"
