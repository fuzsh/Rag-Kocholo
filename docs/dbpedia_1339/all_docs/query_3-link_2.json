His 100m WR is still in tact, as he predicted, but he's less confident about today's 200m...\n\nas.com\n\nLyles back for more\n\nThat 200m final (at 14:30p.m. ET) will see Noah Lyles line up with ambitions of following up his 100m gold with another... and the relay also ahead for a golden treble.\n\nCould he really break Usain Bolt's 200m world record?
