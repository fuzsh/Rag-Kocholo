        "text": "LONDON: Argentina international midfielder Guido Rodriguez became West Ham's sixth summer signing on Tuesday.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who was part of the Argentina squad which won the World Cup in 2022 and the 2021 and 2024 Copa America titles, was available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract at Real Betis.\n\nRodriguez spent the last four-and-a-half years in Spain, becoming a key player as Betis have qualified for European football in each of the past four seasons.\n\n\"I feel like it's every footballer's dream to play in the Premier League, and I was very excited when I heard that West Ham were interested in me,\" Rodriguez said in a club statement.\n\n\"I will bring experience to the team, and though I'm aware the Premier League is very physical, I'm ready to put the work in to make sure I'm up to the task.\"\n\nThe Hammers have already added German international striker Niclas Fuellkrug, wingers Crysencio Summerville and Luis Guilherme and defender Max Kilman to their squad for Julen Lopetegui's first season in charge.\n\nTechnical Director Tim Steidten said Rodriguez's signing was a \"statement of intent\" as they aim to improve on finishing ninth in the Premier League last season.\n\n\"This is a massive moment for West Ham United in bringing a player of Guido's pedigree to the club,\" said Steidten.\n\n\"He is a player I have admired for a long time, and we couldn't be happier to have completed the deal to bring him to east London.\"\n\nPARIS: Mallory Swanson scored the winning goal as the United States edged Brazil 1-0 in Saturday’s Olympic women’s football final to claim the gold medal for a record-extending fifth time.\n\nBrazil fought hard on a hot afternoon at the Parc des Princes, but the USA struck just before the hour mark when Swanson — on her 100th cap — ran through to finish past goalkeeper Lorena.\n\nIt is the first time the USA have taken the Olympic title in 12 years, their gold in Paris adding to those won in 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012.\n\n“I am just in awe of how hard everyone has worked to get here,” said the winger Trinity Rodman.\n\n“I believed the entire time, but to finally be able to hold (the gold medal) is so amazing.”\n\nThe USA have now beaten Brazil in three of those Olympic finals, with the South Americans again having to settle for silver here just as they did in Athens in 2004 and Beijing four years later.\n\nIt was not quite the ending that their legendary captain Marta was hoping for, as she bowed out of her sixth and last Olympics aged 38 with a third silver medal.\n\n“We surpassed ourselves throughout the competition to get to the final. That was our main objective, to come away with a medal,” Marta said.\n\nBrazil were never expected to get this far, while the USA’s victory confirms their renaissance under new English coach Emma Hayes.\n\nShe only arrived from Chelsea in late May but has worked wonders with a team that a year ago was sent packing from the World Cup in the last 16.\n\n“I am very emotional. It has been a dream of mine to be in this position,” Hayes told broadcaster Eurosport.\n\nShe described her team as “tremendous people and players and role models, I love them.”\n\nThat World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand was the international swansong for USWNT icon Megan Rapinoe, who was among the crowd for Saturday’s final, as was Tom Cruise.\n\nMuch of the talk in the build-up was about Marta, with the Brazil great free to return for a farewell Olympic appearance after serving a two-game ban for a red card in her team’s last group outing.\n\nBut the 38-year-old multiple winner of the FIFA world player of the year award was left on the bench at kick-off by coach Arthur Elias.\n\nA younger Marta had played in Brazil’s defeats in the 2004 and 2008 finals, both of which came in extra time.\n\nThis was also the second clash between the nations in a final this year, after the USA won 1-0 in the CONCACAF Gold Cup in March.\n\nThe USA subsequently welcomed Hayes as coach and she oversaw wins against Japan and Germany in the knockout rounds to get to the Olympic final.\n\nBrazil, meanwhile, scraped through their group as a best third-placed team, before wins against hosts France in the quarter-finals and World Cup holders Spain in the last four, both achieved without Marta.\n\nTheir direct approach posed problems to the USA defense in the first half, and they had the ball in the net on 16 minutes.\n\nLudmila turned Naomi Girma inside out in the box before finishing, but the goal was disallowed for offside.\n\nSwanson was denied at the other end by Lorena after bursting into the box, yet it was Brazil who had the best chance of the opening half.\n\nCaptain Adriana crossed in stoppage time for Gabi Portilho to divert the ball toward goal, but Alyssa Naeher saved well.\n\nThe Americans boasted the more dangerous attack, though, and they went ahead on 57 minutes when Korbin Albert released Swanson to advance and finish expertly for her fourth goal of the tournament.\n\nBrazil sent on Marta for the final half hour, but they never seriously looked like equalising.\n\nThe veteran sent a free-kick over the bar before Naeher kept out Adriana’s header in stoppage time as the USA secured a third straight 1-0 win to take the title.\n\nLONDON: The Saudi ambassador to the US said on Saturday that media criticism of Algerian Olympic gold medallist boxer Imane Khelif had to stop and that “kindness and human dignity must prevail every time.”\n\nPrincess Reema bint Bandar was speaking at the 142nd session of the International Olympic Committee in Paris in her capacity as a member of the IOC and an official in its gender equality, diversity and inclusion commission.\n\nShe said, however, that in the case of the abuse Khelif has faced, she spoke as “a female, a Muslim and an Arab woman.”\n\nShe continued: “As such, I cannot serve in good conscience on this committee and remain silent on the media commentary on Imane Khelif.\n\n“I’d like to say today that I wholeheartedly support (IOC President) Thomas Bach and everyone who communicated the joint Paris 2024 Boxing Unit and IOC statement made on Aug. 1.”\n\nThe Algerian won a gold medal amid a tumultuous run in Paris, where she has endured intense scrutiny inside and outside the ring and online abuse from around the world over misconceptions about her womanhood.\n\n“From my point of view, the facts are clear, Khelif is a woman,” Princess Reema said. “She was born a girl and has lived her entire life as a female. However, despite this joint statement, there has been continuous misreporting based on misinformation which has caused immeasurable pain and this is not only unacceptable but absolutely heartbreaking,” she added.\n\nThe ambassador said that, from humble roots in rural Algeria, Khelif had worked just as hard as every other Olympic athlete, with “determination, grit and persistence,” for the right to compete in front of the world.\n\n“As is the nature of Olympians, she represents the most superior capability and capacity, and this is what makes these Games so spectacular and what makes Paris so spectacular. But nobody has the right to deny her her womanhood and continuing to push false narratives against her is an attempt to rob her of her dignity and her merit,” said Princess Reema.\n\n“So, I stand here today in front of his distinguished committee and I say this can’t continue. Women Olympians are elite, they train to be the best of the best. And it is that collective failure of all of us that we still have this conversation, so I think it is more paramount than ever.\n\nThe princess said if a female stayed silent, she was viewed as accepting the misreports or as weak, but if she were to speak out, she would be branded as defensive.\n\n“I believe athletes should be focusing on their performance, not having to justify their existence,” she told the committee.\n\n“No athlete should be bullied or ridiculed for their appearance, no athlete should have their wins, or talents or achievements they have developed over a lifetime, weaponized against them, because what eclipses appearance is talent.\n\n“These Olympics are a time to celebrate diversity, with athletes hailing from all corners of the globe. But ladies and gentlemen, you know, women don’t look, speak or act singularly and each woman performing in her respective sport, she’s unique. The only communality is the determination to make it to the top,” she added.\n\nThe Saudi princess said after Khelif’s quarterfinal win, when she fell to her knees in tears, “every woman who has ever felt isolated, mocked or or told that they didn’t belong; they fell with her. And when she rose, they rose with her.”\n\nShe added that she offered her full support, not only to the IOC and the “brave and bold statements they have made,” but also to “every female who has been subjected to unnecessary criticism, in what should have been their time to shine and reap.”\n\nShe continued: “To the general public and to humankind, I ask that you look at women athletes and look at what they’ve endured, and ask yourself: What it was your daughter? What if it was your female friend or relative? Your words matter and our behaviour matters.\n\n“And to every girl who thinks she sits just a little outside the box or outside of the norm, if you see a racket, pick it up; if you see a soccer ball, kick it; and if you see a track, run as fast as you can.”"
