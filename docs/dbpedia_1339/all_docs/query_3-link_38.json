        "text": "Preview\n\nMaccabi arrived at the LFF stadium in Vilnius for the EUROPA League 3rd qualifying round first leg against Lithuanian champions FK Panevezys aiming for a good result ahead of next week’s return leg.\n\nMaccabi’s coach Zarko Lazetic who could face his former club TSC Backa Topola in the Play Off following yesterday’s draw at UEFA Headquarters, will try and emulate last season’s achievement by reaching the EUROPA League group stages. Lazetic, made three changes from the side that suffered a late defeat to Steaua Bucharest that ended any champions league dreams. Roi Mishapti kept his place in goal while the defense also remained unchanged as Tyrese Asante and Raz Shlomo were named as the two central defenders with Idan Nachmias and Ofir Davidzada completing the back four on the right and left respectively. Maccabi’s engine room also remained unchanged as Joris van Overeem, Gabi Kanichowsky and Dor Peretz were named as the midfield trio. Sagiv Jehezkel who made his debut appearance in Budapest last week made his debut start, while new signing Hisham Layous was given his first outing in a Maccabi shirt on the opposite flank.\n\nDor Turgeman, who returned from international duty at the Olympic Games in Paris, led the line upfront for his first appearance of the season.\n\nMaccabi’s other four Israeli internationals Roy Revivo, Osher Davida, Ido Shahar and Elad Madmon were also named amongst the substitutes. Madmon who was signed in January from Hapoel Hadera but only joined now, was hoping to make his Maccabi debut as was new signing from Bordeaux Issouf Sissokho.\n\nOfek Melika, Roi Amedi, Avishay Cohen, Eran Zahavi, Dan Biton, Yonas Malede, Henry Addo and Matan Baltaxa were the other substitutes that Lazetic named on the bench.\n\nFirst Half\n\nMaccabi couldn’t have asked for a better start especially from their debutants as Dor Peretz scored a spectacular goal with three minutes on the clock. Hisham Layous dribbled into the box from the left before cutting the ball back for Sagiv Jehezkel who teed up Peretz on the edge of the area. Maccabi’s captain on the night blasted a right foot shot that rocketed into the top corner and went in off the crossbar giving the keeper no chance. In the seventh minute Idan Nachmias rose to meet Gabi Kanichowsky’s corner with a powerful header which was punched away by Vytautas Cerniauskas.\n\nTwo minutes later the Panevezys keeper could do nothing to deny Maccabi’s second. A slick exchange between Nachmias and Peretz saw the midfielder turn provider with a perfectly timed cross that allowed Dor Turgeman to flick the ball home and open his account for the season. The hosts came close in the 15th minute as Maccabi’s defense struggled to clear allowing Ernestas Veliulis to latch on the loose ball but fail to keep his shot down and fire over. Referee Aliyar Aghayev cautioned Tyrese Asante in the 22nd minute for a foul on Cheikhou Dieng just inside Maccabi’s half.\n\nTurgeman could have scored a second in the 26th minute but his effort from the center of the area lacked power and was easily collected by the keeper. Right on the half hour mark Turgeman swapped roles with Peretz and almost assisted a goal as his dummy released Peretz through on goal. But Peretz’s attempt was blocked by a combination of the rushing keeper and his defenders.\n\nJoris van Overeem who dominated the midfield was struck in the face by Noel Mbo who was consequently booked in the 37th minute.\n\nJust as the fourth official raised his sign for 2 minutes of added time, Raz Shlomo required medical treatment for colliding with an opponent in mid-air while Roi Mishpati came off his line to punch the ball and clear the danger.\n\nSecond Half\n\nMaccabi began the second half just like they did with the first one as Turgeman fed Jehezkel on 51. But the pacy winger couldn’t get a clean shot as he sliced his effort wide of the target. Mbo almost exploited a mistake in Maccabi’s defense five minutes later as he picked the ball inside the center circle before shrugging off Shlomo to race through. But Asante tracked back and blocked the Panevezys forward before he could get a shot on target allowing Mishpati to collect.\n\nA minute after the hour mark the hosts were awarded a free kick near the corner of the area as Linas Kimavvicius was given the time and space to meet Jeffrey Sarpong cross but send his header wide. In the 64th minute Layous’s cut-back found Peretz in the box, only for a Panevezys’ defender to clear for a corner. This was Layous’ final contribution as Lazetic made his first change seconds later by replacing him with Osher Davida.\n\nPanevezys cut the deficit in the 70th as Sivert Gussias exploited a mix-up between Ofir Davidzada and Shlomo. Gussias then charged into the box before dinking the ball over the advancing Mishpati. Maccabi came close to restore their two-goal lead on 75 as Turgeman slid the ball to Kanichowsky whose effort was blocked by Cerniauskas. Lazetic reacted with a triple substitution in the 77th minute introducing Roy Revivo, Ido Shahar and Eran Zahavi for Davidzada, Peretz and Jehezkel.\n\nInside injury time the hosts increased the pressure in a bid to score a late equalizer. Maccabi defense couldn’t clear the danger as the ball fell to Markas Beneta whose shot forced Mishpati to turn it over the crossbar and secure the win."
