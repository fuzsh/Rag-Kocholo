        "text": "Similar to other complex systems in nature (e.g., a hunting pack, flocks of birds), sports teams have been modeled as social neurobiological systems in which interpersonal coordination tendencies of agents underpin team swarming behaviors. Swarming is seen as the result of agent co-adaptation to ecological constraints of performance environments by collectively perceiving specific possibilities for action (affordances for self and shared affordances). A major principle of invasion team sports assumed to promote effective performance is to outnumber the opposition (creation of numerical overloads) during different performance phases (attack and defense) in spatial regions adjacent to the ball. Such performance principles are assimilated by system agents through manipulation of numerical relations between teams during training in order to create artificially asymmetrical performance contexts to simulate overloaded and underloaded situations. Here we evaluated effects of different nume...\n\nHere, we report an investigation of the patterned movement behavior of players for a specific sub-phase of the game of futsal, namely when the goalkeeper for the attacking team is substituted with an extra outfield player. The movement trajectories of the ball and players were recorded in both lateral and longitudinal directions and investigated using relative phase analysis. Some differences in phase relations between different playing dyads were noted, indicating specificity of phase attractions, or otherwise, for certain players. In general terms, the defenders demonstrated strong in-phase attractions with the ball and with each other, whereas weaker phase attractions, indicated by increased relative phase variability, were observed for the attackers and ball, as well as between attackers themselves. These results demonstrate different coordination dynamics for the defending and attacking dyads, from which we interpret evidence for different playing sub-systems consistent with different team objectives linked together in an overarching game structure. In keeping with dynamical systems theory for complex systems, we view this sub-phase of futsal as being characterized by coordinated behavior patterns that emerge as a result of self-organizing processes. These dynamic patterns are generated within functional constraints, with players and teams exerting mutual influence on each other.\n\nThis study analysed the influence of field dimension and players’ skill level on collective tactical behaviours during small-sided and conditioned games (SSCGs). Positioning and displacement data were collected using global positioning systems (15 Hz) during SSCGs (Gk+4 v. 4+Gk) played by two groups of participants (NLP- national-level and RLP-regional-level players) on different field dimensions (small: 36.8 × 23.8 m; intermediate: 47.3 × 30.6 and large: 57.8 × 37.4 m). Team tactical performance was assessed through established dynamic team variables (effective playing space, playing length per width ratio and team separateness) and nonlinear signal processing techniques (sample entropy of distances to nearest opponents and the teams’ centroids’ mutual information). Results showed that the effective playing space and team separateness increased significantly with pitch size regardless of participant skill level (P η 2 = 0.78 and P η 2 = 0.65, respectively). Playing length per width...\n\nPerformance analysis is a subdiscipline of sports sciences and one- approach, notational analysis, has been used to objectively audit and describe behaviours of performers during different subphases of play, providing additional information for practitioners to improve future sports performance. Recent criticisms of these methods have suggested the need for a sound the- oretical rationale to explain performance behaviours, not just describe them. The aim of this article was to show how ecological dynamics provides a valid theoretical explanation of performance in team sports by explaining the formation of successful and unsuccessful patterns of play, based on symmetry-breaking processes emerging from functional interactions between players and the performance environment. We offer the view that ecological dy- namics is an upgrade to more operational methods of performance analysis that merely document statistics of competitive performance. In support of our arguments, we refer to exemplar data on competitive performance in team sports that have revealed functional interpersonal interactions between attackers and defenders, based on variations in the spatial positioning of performers relative to each other in critical performance areas, such as the scoring zones. Implications of this perspective are also considered for practice task design and sport development programmes.\n\nThe aim of this thesis was to investigate the informational constraints that guide performance of individuals and teams in sport. An initial meta-analysis of the effects of expertise on decision-making revealed stronger effects with more homogeneous results in performance contexts and when individuals were allowed to perform sport actions. Based on this conclusion, all of our empirical experiments were developed using a specific sub-phase of competitive futsal games. Analysis of ball passing performance revealed that the decision to pass a ball to a teammate was regulated by spatial constraints through the coupling of interpersonal distance values between players at the moment of pass initiation. Furthermore, the success of the pass was well predicted by a proposed variable defined as Time to Ball Interception. In order to understand how ball dynamics and goal position constrained interpersonal relations between players we also investigated how patterns of interpersonal coordination between players emerged during different sub-phases of the game. It was observed that the ball and the goal represent key performance constraints which shape the emergent patterns of coordination between players and teams. Different coordination dynamics for defenders and attackers were observed, which was consistent with different team objectives In conclusion, all the studies contributed to a better understanding of how individual players or teams adapted their behaviors to the changing conditions of the performance environment, in order to successfully perform.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to (1) verify the correlation between maturation and peripheral perception and (2) to analyse the effect of peripheral perception on the efficiency of tactical behaviour in young soccer players. Fifty-four (U-11, U-13 and U-15) young male soccer players participated in the study. The maturation was evaluated by the Khamis-Roche method, the peripheral perception by a computer-based test in the Mental Test and Training System, and the efficiency of the tactical behaviour by the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer. Descriptive analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Spearman bivariate correlation, and multivariate analysis of variance tests were performed. The significance level adopted was p < .05. Correlations have been observed between the percentage of predicted adult height and the performance in peripheral perception. It was also detected that the peripheral perception has an effect on the efficiency of the tactical behaviour in young players. It has been concluded that the maturation of an individual has an association with the peripheral perception, and that it can make players more efficient to perceive the environment and in the execution of fundamental tactical principles of the soccer game.\n\nThe teaching and learning of games and sport-based activities has historically been the dominant form of the physical education curricula. With an interest in providing to students meaningful and culturally situated sporting experiences, Sport Education is probably the most implemented and researched pedagogical model worldwide. However, although there is considerable evidence that the model as a curriculum approach can benefit the development of social goals and healthy sport behaviors, not a single study as to date examined students&#39; game-play development beyond participation in single and isolated teaching units. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine students&#39; development of Game Performance and Game Involvement during participation in three consecutive Sport Education seasons of invasion games. The participants were an experienced physical education teacher and one seventh-grade class totaling 26 students (10 girls and 16 boys). Using the Game Performance A..."
