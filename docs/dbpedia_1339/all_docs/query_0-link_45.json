        "text": "After a goalless first-half, Iran scored three quick goals at the start of the second period to take the game away from Japan at the Indoor Stadium Huamark and retain the crown they clinched in 2015.\n\nSara Shirbeigi was the star of the show for Iran as she netted a hat-trick, while Fereshteh Karimi and Fahimeh Zarei also got on the scoresheet.\n\nThe result ensures Iran remain the only team to win the event as this year's tournament in Thailand was the second edition of the competition.\n\nThailand earned their second consecutive bronze medal as they beat Vietnam on penalties after the match had ended 0-0.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2015 final, neither Japan nor Iran could find the net in a scoreless first-half.\n\nIran then quickly seized control as Shirbeigi tapped home the opener before Karimi direct from a free-kick.\n\nKarimi turned provider for Shirbeigi to make it 3-0 and the latter completed her hat-trick shortly after with Iran's fourth.\n\nMika Eguchi pulled a goal back for Japan but Iran soon restored their four-goal advantage thanks to Zarei.\n\nAnna Amishiro reduced the deficit to 5-2 late on but it mattered little as Iran cruised to a dominant victory, sparking wild scenes of celebration at the final whistle."
