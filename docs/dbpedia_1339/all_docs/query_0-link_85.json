        "text": "As the world's attention is on the Paris Olympics, 17-year-old Malachi has his sights set elsewhere — on making his mark at the 2032 Brisbane Paralympic Games.\n\nDespite the Games being eight years away, Malachi trains daily, calling the local athletics track in Lismore his second home.\n\n\"I feel like it's where I belong,\" he says.\n\n\"Discus, shot-put, javelin, long jump, running — I love it all.\"\n\nFor Malachi, being on the track in his home town feels spiritual, a place where his mind quietens and instinct takes charge, especially when he throws the javelin.\n\n\"Javelin is in my blood,\" he says.\n\nWhile Malachi's natural abilities provide an advantage, it's his hard work and discipline that keep him on track to becoming a First Nations Paralympian.\n\nSince starting competitive athletics at eight, he has accumulated a bedroom full of medals. But as he has grown older, his definition of success has changed.\n\n\"I used to be disappointed if I didn't get gold,\" he says.\n\n\"But now I'm all about breaking records, knowing my name is going to be on that paper forever.\"\n\nMalachi currently holds five Australian records in long jump, discus, and shot-put under his T20 para-athlete classification.\n\nHe has also represented Australia twice: first at the 2022 Virtus Oceania Asia Games in Brisbane, and then at the 2023 Virtus Global Games in France, the world's largest elite sporting event for athletes with intellectual impairments.\n\nMalachi draws inspiration from athletes like Usain Bolt and Alberto Campbell.\n\n\"Usain Bolt is my idol. I also look up to Alberto Campbell,\" he says.\n\nFor Malachi, his commitment to athletics goes beyond his physical training, it's his way of life.\n\n\"I breathe athletics. It's my mindset,\" he says.\n\nRealising the opportunities\n\nMalachi lives in Caniaba, on the outskirts of Lismore, New South Wales, with his younger brother and guardians, Annette and Malcom Sky.\n\nOver the years, the Skys have fostered more than 23 children.\n\nIn 2010, despite their recent decision to stop fostering, they agreed to provide a home for two brothers in need.\n\nFrom the start, Mrs Sky expressed concern about Malachi's health, particularly when he wasn't meeting the developmental milestones typical for his age.\n\nMalachi was diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder at age of six and underwent multiple operations. Later, he was diagnosed with ADHD and a hearing impairment.\n\nDespite these challenges, Malachi's athletic talents were evident early on, particularly during sports carnivals where he outperformed his able-bodied peers.\n\nBut it wasn't until a visit to his paediatrician, Jackie Andrews, at age seven that Malachi's potential as a para-athlete was first flagged.\n\n\"His paediatrician said, 'Well, if he likes to run, you know that he can compete as a para-athlete?'\" Mrs Sky says.\n\n\"I went, 'Are you serious? He's got all his arms and legs!'\"\n\nToday, Mrs Sky acknowledges Dr Andrews's pivotal role in shaping their lives.\n\n\"She actually helped get the paperwork and filled it out— and the rest is history,\" Mrs Sky says.\n\n\"Malachi's been thriving ever since, and we have her to thank.\"\n\nFinancial challenges\n\nCompeting in para-athletics can be costly, from flights and accommodation to coaching, uniforms and equipment.\n\nWhile some costs are covered under Malachi's NDIS plan, Mrs Sky says, without occasional scholarships or grants, many expenses fall to them.\n\nFor instance, they had to pay $8,000 for Malachi to compete at the Virtus Global Games in France last year.\n\nOver the years, Mrs Sky has advocated with both state and federal parliamentarians for better support for people with disabilities, highlighting that the cost of competition is often out of reach for many families.\n\nOne of those essential services Malachi relies on is provided by Sam Mitchell, an exercise physiologist who has been working with him for the past year.\n\nMr Mitchell says Malachi's determination was evident from the first day they met and discussed future goals.\n\n\"Each session he's motivated to come in, which makes the world of a difference in terms of reaching that end goal.\"\n\nMr Mitchell believes there are two things that set Malachi apart: his drive and his natural athleticism.\n\n\"He's amazingly naturally talented. I think it's definitely a gift for him to be able to move and be as quick and explosive and coordinated as he is,\" he says.\n\nDespite the ambitious goals, the pair still finds time to incorporate fun in sessions, which Mr Mitchell says is an important part of the process.\n\n\"We've got a serious job, but we don't take ourselves too seriously,\" he says.\n\nCareer as elite athlete\n\nTorita Blake is a First Nations Dunghutti woman and a two-time Paralympian.\n\nAt just five weeks old, she endured brain injuries from domestic violence, ultimately leading to cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and legal blindness.\n\nLike Malachi, Blake was faster than most of her able-bodied peers growing up, but only became aware of her sporting opportunities when her Year 9 PE teacher brought them to her attention.\n\nWithin a year, Blake received her classification, joined an athletics club, and began competing at national events, where Paralympian and Paralympics Australia senior performance and talent advisor Tim Matthews noticed her.\n\nSix months later, at just 16, Blake was competing at the London 2012 Paralympics.\n\n\"I had no understanding of what the Paralympics were. I remember I got over there and there were 80,000 people in the crowd,\" she says.\n\nBlake would go on to compete in the Rio Paralympics four years later.\n\nBorn in Moree and raised in Logan, south-east Queensland, Blake knows firsthand the difficulties Indigenous teens from rural areas face when pursing the Paralympics, particularly the financial challenges.\n\nBlake says, without the support of 989 FM, a national Indigenous radio station, her career as an elite athlete would not have been possible.\n\n\"They raised all the funds — so I'm always grateful for them.\"\n\nBlake now uses her athletics profile to empower Indigenous youth to reach their academic and sporting ambitions.\n\n\"My main passion is trying to get more Indigenous kids with disabilities involved in sports,\" she says.\n\nBlake is a mentor for Raise the Bar Academy, a joint initiative between Athletics Australia and the University of Melbourne, aimed at helping Indigenous high school students discover tertiary education and employment through sports.\n\nShe is also an ambassador for the Deadly Choices Healthy Lifestyle Program, which promotes wellness within Indigenous communities.\n\n\"I look at how many Indigenous athletes have represented Australia at the Paralympics,\" Blake says.\n\n\"Before Paris, there have only been 16, the first being [wheelchair basketballer] Uncle Kevin [Coombs].\n\nNot even realising you're eligible\n\nTim Matthews says often there are talented individuals already participating in sports who may not be aware or connected to a Paralympic pathway, much like Torita Blake.\n\nHe says outreach and education are fundamental in increasing opportunities for more para-athletes to participate in future Games.\n\n\"They just don't have an understanding of classification or which sports they may be eligible for.\"\n\nMr Matthews says this lack of understanding can also extend to coaches, administrators and those involved in sport delivery in some cases.\n\nIn a bid to change this, Paralympics Australia is aiming to make more educational classification resources available to demystify eligibility.\n\nIt is also partnering with the Australian Institute of Sport and national sporting organisations to help unearth potential para-athletes.\n\nAdditionally, Mr Matthews would like to see more Indigenous athletes participating in para-sports and given the opportunity to progress with the necessary support.\n\n\"I think we need to do better in this space across the board.\"\n\nMr Matthews says the country's 16 known Indigenous Paralympians, led by the great Uncle Kevin Coombs and others, have left a \"great legacy\".\n\n\"Thankfully there's been a significant announcement in terms of uplift and investment into Paralympic sport, which is amazing, but that there still requires a lot of work to do.\""
