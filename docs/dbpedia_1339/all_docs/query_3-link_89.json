        "text": "Prospective I-League investors praise initiative\n\nNEW DELHI: All India Football Federation (AIFF) President Mr. Praful Patel presided over the first of its kind AIFF organised Open House Meeting for induction of two new I-League Clubs. He was extremely confident that a minimum of two corporate-backed clubs will help raise the standard of the I-League significantly.\n\n“Take it from me; this initiative will help all existing clubs find partners. Clubs will fulfill the Club Licensing Criteria which is very essential for development infrastructure and youth development. Football is very popular in India. It’s just that we do not have a proper infrastructure and setup,” said Mr. Patel while addressing the 30 interested corporate parties present at the Football House on Tuesday (March 5,2013).\n\nHe further added: “For example, every English Premier League club has a ground, which they call their home ground. Here no club has that. In Kolkata four teams use the same ground. Now with two new clubs backed by corporate bodies coming up, these issues are expected be sorted out as they will be under the Club Licensing Criteria. All the other existing clubs will follow suit and in the process we can dream of a better League and perhaps one day compare with the best Leagues in the world.”\n\nThe bidding process will take place from March 30 till May 10 when the announcement of the successful bidders will be done.\n\nAIFF General Secretary Mr. Kushal Das said: “The AIFF is doing this keeping in mind the development of football infrastructure and youth development. It is not a profit making exercise. That the clubs will meet the AFC Club Licensing Criteria which states that some portion of the budget should go to Grassroot Development and building Academies is actually a step forward towards development of infrastructure.”\n\nMr. Das also gave a brief overview of the structure and activities of the AIFF including the current focus in grassroot and youth Development.\n\nI-League CEO Sunando Dhar, explaining the process of bidding and rules and regulations to be met, stressed on the fact that roadmap for the future is looking bright from the turnout.\n\n“I see a full house inside the Conference room. Just goes to show that we are on the right direction. We want to touch new bases in our objective of a pan Indian I-League. So we are looking at investors investing in bases which don’t have I-League team but amount of interest in football is huge. For example Kerala. So we are restricting the two new clubs from setting up a base in Kolkata and Goa. It is just to create that pan India feel which is very important.” - ;\n\nAbhijit Sarkar, Head- Corporate Communications of Sahara and one of the potential investors was all praise about the initiative. “This is an excellent initiative from AIFF. Football needed this to grow and I am glad that it is finally happening. There is market in India for the sport which is so popular here.”\n\nPrakash Shah, Director of Mumbai Tigers (formerly known as Dodsal FC) added that the importance of infrastructure is paramount and the fact that it is being stressed here is heartening.\n\n“Without Grassroots and proper infrastructure, football cannot develop. Look at top leagues across Europe. I totally agree with Mr. Patel that this can change the outlook of clubs in India. You need to be professional and invest judiciously.”\n\nAmong the major investors who attended the meet were Mr. Sajjan Jindal, Chairman of JSW and the ex-chairman of the I-League Committee, and Mr. Shirish Kulkarni, Director of DSK Shivajians. Representatives from GMR and Hero Motors were also present.\n\nPraful Patel signed off by saying that a similar meeting will take place in Dubai by the end of this month to attract foreign investors from Gulf and Europe.\n\nBound to survive with the Air India and ONGC situation.\n\nJust a pity that it is March now and we are starting to know what will happen for the next season - this should all of been settled before this season even started. You could argue at times that it's made up as it goes along and that the AIFF really do treat the fans with an utter lack of respect.\n\nThe excitement of the relegation battle and seeing Mohun Bagan really battle it out down there has gone.\n\nMB don't need to do anything now but build for next season - I guess this is the plus point. Everyone who isn't challenging for the title now has from now until October to really get there act together and be competitive - i mean such as United Sikkam - they survive now, so i hope next year they don't get trounced again, cos they've got 7 months to prepare!!!\n\nI agree with this.\n\nDon't understand the need for teams to build new stadium - jesus, they could get relegated quite quickly and have a stadium for nothing, lets start right from the very bottom first.\n\nNot sure on Conferences. Are AIFF now saying it's too far to travel? Seems a cheap shot to get more teams in the top flight. In the future they might aswell have 32 top flight teams, do away with relegation altogether, do away with a feeder league, just pile them all up in conferences.\n\nIf AIFF really want this, might as well just play State Leagues, and send all winning teams to a knockout finals.\n\nThis really could kill off rivialries between east and west altogether.\n\nThe two corporate clubs (the ones who are promising stadiums) are the ones who wont be relegated even if they end in the relegation zone. I can understand that but still, I dont want the AIFF to just allow a company to create a team in Bangalore and then next season only have 1,000 people per game just like HAL SC did for the 2 seasons they were in the I-League. We need to know if they can improve on that.\n\nFor a country like India we should be aiming to put teams in specific markets where football has support and we should be aiming to average a league wide 10,000 fans per game. Of course this is long time in the future stuff but I dont see a team in Bangalore doing this just yet. The domestic game is just not that popular down there.\n\nAs for conferences. I still dont see the logic. If the AIFF want a play-off then follow the A-League way and have the top few teams in a single table enter the play-offs with the winner of the regular season getting automatic qualification into Asia. Its not rocket science. And conferences would really take the fans out of their confort zone. They are already Eurosnobs (ones that wont except franchises, salary caps etc) why do more damage and add the conferences. Direct teams and salary caps we can get away with but conferences is to much."
