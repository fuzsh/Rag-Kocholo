        "text": "The 2024 Premier League title race went down to the final day, but Manchester City prevailed again to win a fourth successive crown.\n\nPep Guardiola's side beat West Ham 3-1 to win a sixth league title in eight years with challengers Arsenal - who were seeking a first crown since their 'Invincibles' season under Arsene Wenger in 2003/04 - falling two points short despite a 2-1 win against Everton.\n\nSeven sides have won the Premier League since England's top flight, the old First Division, was rebranded in 1992. Here's every previous Premier League champion in the competition's history, plus all you need to know about the trophy - and who gets a medal...\n\nPremier League standings\n\nPremier League 2024/25 season dates\n\nLive football on Sky Sports\n\nWho were the first Premier League winners?\n\nManchester United were the inaugural Premier League champions in 1992/93, ending a 26-year wait for a top-flight crown.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson's side finished 10 points clear of Aston Villa to win the first title, with Norwich City two points further back. Blackburn Rovers and QPR made up the top five.\n\nUnited seized the momentum after a memorable game against Sheffield Wednesday on April 10, 1993, when centre-back Steve Bruce scored two late goals - including the winner in the seventh minute added on - and the concept of 'Fergie Time' was born.\n\nThat dramatic show was part of a seven-match winning streak as United stormed to glory and sealed it at Old Trafford with a 3-1 win over Blackburn.\n\nWho has won the most Premier League titles?\n\nThat 1992/93 triumph ushered in an unprecedented era of Manchester United success under Ferguson, with the club dominant domestically during the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nManchester United have had the most Premier League success with 13 titles to their name and their last came in 2012/13 - Ferguson's final campaign in charge.\n\nSince the League began in 1992, there have been seven different winners in total, with Manchester United joined by Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and Liverpool.\n\nWhat do the Premier League winners get?\n\nThe champions get to lift the Premier League trophy, which the Premier League says is based on the \"three lions of English football\". Two of the lions are displayed above the handles on either side, with the captain of the winning team \"becoming the third lion when he raises the trophy and its gold crown above his head\".\n\nThe trophy stands 104cm tall and weights 4st.\n\nThere are actually two identical trophies; one stays with the Premier League champions until three weeks before their final match of the current season, while the other is used by the Premier League for events and promotional purposes.\n\nWho gets a Premier League medal?\n\nThe champions also get 40 commemorative medals, made of silver.\n\nAccording to Premier League rules, they can be given to the manager, players and officials as the winning club sees fit, provided every player who has made at least five Premier League appearances during the title-winning season gets one.\n\nAdditional medals may only be presented with the consent of the Premier League board.\n\nPremier League champions - list of winners by year\n\n2023/24: Manchester City\n\n2022/23: Manchester City\n\n2021/22: Manchester City\n\n2020/21: Manchester City\n\n2019/20: Liverpool\n\n2018/19: Manchester City\n\n2017/18: Manchester City\n\n2016/17: Chelsea\n\n2015/16: Leicester City\n\n2014/15: Chelsea\n\n2013/14: Manchester City\n\n2012/13: Manchester United\n\n2011/12: Manchester City\n\n2010/11: Manchester United\n\n2009/10: Chelsea\n\n2008/09: Manchester United\n\n2007/08: Manchester United\n\n2006/07: Manchester United\n\n2005/06: Chelsea\n\n2004/05: Chelsea\n\n2003/04: Arsenal\n\n2002/03: Manchester United\n\n2001/02: Arsenal\n\n2000/01: Manchester United\n\n1999/00: Manchester United\n\n1998/99: Manchester United\n\n1997/98: Arsenal\n\n1996/97: Manchester United\n\n1995/96: Manchester United\n\n1994/95: Blackburn Rovers\n\n1993/94: Manchester United\n\n1992/93: Manchester United\n\nLive Premier League on Sky Sports in 2024/25\n\nSky Sports will show 128 games exclusively live in the 2024/25 season - and a brand new agreement between Sky Sports and the Premier League means even more live matches from 2025/26.\n\nFrom 2025, Sky Sports will broadcast a record minimum of 215 Premier League matches a season after finalising a new four-year agreement.\n\nThroughout the 2024/25 season, you can watch Premier League match highlights for free - without being a Sky Sports subscriber.\n\nYou'll find highlights from every Premier League game in the Score Centre, as well as on the Sky Sports website and Sky Sports app shortly after full-time, or from 5.15pm for midday Saturday kick-offs.
