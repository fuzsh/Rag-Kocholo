        "text": "My opinion:\n\nTradition. IIRC, the BL began with 16 teams but within a year or two was at 18,and has been there since. Moreover, to go with 20 teams, you'd almost certainly have to either do away with the winter break or add many more weekday fixtures, which goes against the tradition of playing on weekends and not at all in January.\n\nPersonally, I don't necessarily think bigger is better. In fact, I think 16 teams would be preferable to 18 teams (but I don't see that happening because of Tradition).\n\nIf the BL would go to 20, it would most likely mean more revenue, but perhaps not as much as one might think (I suppose one could make the argument that by diminishing the importance of the games by adding more, you'll end up breaking even on fan attendance, but I certainly would think TV and ad revenue would increase). Adding more games decreases the appeal of the existing games (that mid-February game becomes incrementally less important in a 38 game schedule than a 34 game schedule). Might it also decrease the quality? While we assume more revenue, would it be enough to support two additional teams that would not lower the overall level of league play? I'd argue no, that the rich would get richer and the teams at the bottom of the table would not realize any benefit, with the effect being that the quality of play within the league will decrease because of more weak teams at the bottom. Other top Euro leagues bring in much more revenue, so perhaps they are better able to absorb two more weak sisters than would the BL. Moreover, can one argue that the success of the German National Team can, at least in small part, be attributed to the fact that its members, most of whom ply their trade in Germany, are less tired than their peers in the other leagues?\n\nP.S. The 2.BL only has 18 teams. Perhaps you meant the 3.BL, which in fact has 20.\n\nIf you are talking about that logic it makes much more sense to make no promotion/relegation.\n\nSaying only 16 teams in a league might make the league more exiting but it also pisses on all the fans of other clubs than those 16.\n\nAfterall Promotion/relegation system exists because theres potentially thousands of clubs with fans.\n\nMay I remind that this is not an US major sport league, with franchises relaocating if not enough fans. These are all genuine clubs wether its in BL or Landesliga were you can come from the street and become member of the club and play for the club (mostly on team 27 though).\n\nMay I also remind you how many people you will make jobless, players, managers, coaches, staff if only 16 clubs in BL just because some people are talking about exitement in the league.\n\ndont misunderstand me, but the system is made for people that want to have a local club to support and go and follow the club, not for more exitement in the league.\n\nYou seem to forget that there is not just one league. In Germany, every town has at least one professional football club, and even many villages have one. They don't play in the Bundesliga, of course, but in the 2. Bundesliga, or in the 3. Bundesliga, or the Regionalliga etc\n\nWho says that fans can only enjoy football if their team plays in the highest league of a country? That's only true for so-called \"bandwagon fans\", or the \"prawn sandwich brigade\". But they aren't real fans anyway.\n\nOk, I may have exaggerated a little. But even semi-professional or amateur clubs play (lower league) football that can be enjoyed by the local population. What I meant to say is that every town has at least one such team that the locals can root for.\n\nThat makes no sense to me. On the contrary: the lower divisions would have more high profile clubs in them that now play in a higher division. If clubs like Hertha, Kaiserslautern, Hamburg are relegated, then the 2. Bundesliga becomes much more attractive. Fans don't abandon their team just because they play in a lower league. Hertha drew 46.000 visitors on average in the 2. Bundesliga last year.\n\nThat's not true. The 2. Bundesliga, for instance, has never been more popular than now and the average attendance has increased dramatically in recent years.\n\nOf course the local popultion doesn't actually go to the games anymore. Lüneburg or Celle are towns with a population of 70k each, to use a local example. Ten years ago their clubs still got attendances in the low to mid 4-digits. Today it's 100-300. And the people going to the games are almost exclusively old timers, as there are no new fans. Kids grew up with the Bundesliga on TV.\n\nYou actually think the 2. Bundesliga qualifies as \"lower divisions\" already? 2. Bundesliga attendance heavily depends on what clubs play there, obviously, and there are 30-40 pro clubs in Germany who have pretty much monopolized the game.\n\nSo far this season 6 Oberliga clubs have gone bankrupt. During the last 4 years alone in the 3rd to 5th division there have been, by my count, at least 32 clubs who went into insolvency or were denied a license.\n\nThat's sad.\n\nBut increasing the number of teams in the 1. and 2. Bundesliga does nothing to improve that situation.\n\nWhen clubs with a great tradition and a large fanbase like Dresden are in the 3rd or 4th tier league (as they were for many years), then this increases interest in this league. So, as I said, less clubs would be of help to the lower leagues.\n\nThe reason why so few young people attend lower league football matches is not the Bundesliga but changes in society and culture. People have so much choices how to spend their free time, there are fewer young people, communities have less money to support clubs, and people have become lazy and reclusive.\n\nYou complain that the Bundesliga monopolizes all the attention and interest, but the only way to change that would be to make the Bundesliga less attractive. Is that what you want to achieve by the proposal to increase the number of teams?\n\nBut making the Bundesliga less attractive will not make people attend lower league matches. It will make them turn away from football altogether. If the Bundesliga is exciting, people are drawn to football and some of them will look for a club in their neighborhood to support.\n\nThomas part of whats saying is definately true, world has become smaller, however just because the world has become smaller no need to hurry up and kill local clubs only because 16 league championship is more exciting.\n\nI am aware that BL will never have 20 clubs the interest from the existing teams are simply not there to accept. Personally the 3. League was in the right direction.\n\nAs long as the leagues are organised decentralized egoism among the big gold clubs will also be present. Howmuch i despise american franchise sports league, they have a strong organisation with clear ideas and visions were the league is dictating the progression not likes of Bayern München.\n\nTake on example is the Japanese J-League. 20 years ago the league was created as a franchise league, in these 20 years it has grown from 10-40 pro clubs by adding 1-2 teams a year. They have a clear vision calling the 100 year vision stating that every town has its right in having a proclub, each time some clubs has tried to resist and go ego the league has hitted hard on the owner organisations. I think thats an example to follow.\n\nYoung people seem to attend Bundesliga games just fine. By my personal experience even moreso than in the 1990s. But people in Oldenburg, Hildesheim, Celle or Lüneburg now think of Bremen, Hannover or HSV as their \"local\" clubs. Due to modern transportation you are quickly there, you see them on TV all the time, even the local paper (ok, kids don't read those often) will have pages over pages on the nearest Bundesliga club (hell, even in Braunschweig the paper seems more concerned with Wolfsburg than with Eintracht ), and if your lucky you get a tiny boxscore from the local Oberliga club (just buy a paper in Hildesheim and check yourself - and VfV Hildesheim, the local club, used to have 5-digit attendances way back...).\n\nAnd let's be real - a kid who watches Messi clips on youtube, and goes to see Bayern, HSV, whatever, once a month will never ever check out their local club. Nobody they know goes there, and it's a completely different experience.\n\nDresden in the 4th diviion would only do Dresden way more harm (hello next insolvency) than it would help increasing interest in the league. Even the 3. Liga survives entirely on subsidies already (the ARD doesn't actually want to show the games, at least not enough to pay for it what they do now - however, the DFB requires it if you want to get the rights to NT games).\n\nThe issue is way more complex and lower division football has been systematically destroyed (maybe not entirely on purpose - but the DFB has completely lost it when it comes to the grassroots level, they don't really give a ******** anymore).\n\nI was more stating the facts. The vast majority of people on this board doesn't follow lower division soccer at all, so I think pointing out misconceptions is fair game.\n\nI can't remember making such a proposal (I'd increase the 2. Bundesliga to 20 clubs, though - but I'm sure I never actually mentioned this).\n\nOf course so far everything we have seen suggests the exact opposite.\n\nThe league originally looked like a success, but season you can see quite clearly that the league isn't self supporting. As I said, it survives entirely on subsidies anyway. Attendances are lower than in the old 3rd division Regionalliga (which at the beginning was masked by clubs like Düsseldorf, Braunschweig, Dresden - as soon as those were promoted the league became quite bleak), and at least one third of the clubs are in danger of not getting a license each year.\n\nThe by FAR biggest issue about the new RL reform are the reduced license requirements. It's still impossible for many OL clubs to fullfill those, but at least we won't have the situation again that multiple OL champions refuse promotion.\n\nNo reserve teams is unlikely to happen - that's what the DFB gets for giving the Bundesliga a veto right on all decisions (they don't have one de jure - but the Bundesliga has so many votes in the DFB assembly that, if they vote no, it's impossible to get a supermajority, which would be needed for decisions like this).\n\nLets not forget that the lowest pro league will always fight against bad economy no matter where in the world, thats a natural law so clubs in 3.liga in diffilcuties is acceptable.\n\nI also still think that 3.Liga is a much bigger succes than you state Alex.\n\nYou said attenance were masked by dresden, braunschweig and Düsseldorf.\n\nI prefer to see it in another way. Without 3. liga none of the 3 clubs would have gottem up to 2.BL\n\nIt also serves as a cushing before clubs disapearing into oblivity. 3. liga has saved a clubs like Bielefeldd and Rostock, and when Karlsruhe or Aachen goes own this season they wont be hit as hard as if they were relegated down to the regionals.\n\nWhat offcourse is a big miscalculation was that much fewer of the old traitionsvereins in the old Regional liga went up to 3.liga. Theres clubs like Osnabruck and Offenbach, but no doubt that clubs like Mannhein, Essen, Ulm, Magdeburg etc.... were expected to be there. However I also thinks its a matter of time before we see those clubs up there, we alreay saw Münster, Chemnitz and Darmstadt going up last season.\n\nI think the creators of 3. liga forgot that like before in the 2bl was full of odd clubs with no fans pid by a rich guy, this would also happen in 3.liga and now it would be cheaper than in 2bl to o the trick and still the old traditionsvereins would not have enough money to compete against these."
