        "text": "(ATTN: CHANGES headline, lead; UPDATES throughout with new club)\n\nSEOUL, July 25 (Yonhap) -- The reigning South Korean professional football MVP Lee Jae-sung is set to join a second division German club, a source said Wednesday.\n\nThe source, privy to pro football transactions, said the star midfielder for the K League 1 club Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors has agreed to sign with Holstein Kiel in the 2. Bundesliga.\n\nThe source added that Jeonbuk and Holstein Kiel are hammering out some final details. The new 2. Bundesliga season kicks off on Aug. 3.\n\nHolstein Kiel, founded in 1900, won the top German league title in 1912, with runner-up finishes in 1910 and 1930.\n\nLast season, they ranked third in the 18-team competition to earn a spot in the promotion playoffs, where they lost to VfL Wolfsburg 4-1 in aggregate score. Holstein Kiel last competed in the top division in 1963.\n\nLee, 25, was voted the K League 1's MVP last season, after helping Jeonbuk to their third championship in four years. He was also linked to Fulham FC in the Premier League and FC Midtjylland in Denmark.\n\nAccording to the source, Lee will receive incentives from Holstein Kiel based on his contributions if they get promoted to the top division in the 2019-2020 season.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Jeonbuk general manager Baek Seung-kwon said the club will have a sendoff ceremony for Lee after their home match in Jeonju, 240 kilometers south of Seoul, on Aug. 5.\n\nBaek said Lee has asked to be moved to Europe, and head coach Choi Kang-hee decided to grant that wish.\n\n\"We'll support Lee the best we can so that he'll gain valuable experience competing on a big stage,\" Baek added.\n\nIn 2015, in his second season, Lee was voted the Young Player of the Year, awarded to the top homegrown player 23 or younger with less than three years of professional experience.\n\nLee also represented South Korea at this year's FIFA World Cup in Russia."
