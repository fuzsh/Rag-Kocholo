The Bears’ 72 total sacks still stand as an NFL record...92.5 sacks for the Bears rank second in team history, behind Hall of Famer Richard Dent...in 1988 (11.5) and 1992 (10.5), McMichael led the team in the category, and he totaled seven seasons with eight or more.\n\nJulius Peppers\n\nDefensive End/Linebacker\n\n6-7, 295lb\n\nNorth Carolina. Carolina Panthers 2002-09, 2017-18, Chicago Bears 2010-13, Green Bay Packers 20014-16, 266 games.\n\nSelected second overall by the Carolina Panthers in 2002...became one of the most dominant pass rushers of his era.

He also forced two fumbles and defensed five passes. For his efforts, he earned the Defensive Rookie of the Year Award from the Associated Press, was named a first-team All-Pro and was the only rookie defensive player invited to the Pro Bowl — his first of seven consecutive selections to that game in an injury-shortened eight-year career...continued to build his reputation and resume in 2008 and came back in 2009 with perhaps his best overall season statistically: 152 tackles, four sacks, three forced fumbles, eight pass deflections and career-bests with three interceptions and 13 tackles for loss.
