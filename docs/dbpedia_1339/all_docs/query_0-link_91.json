        "text": "Let me give you a first hand perspective of ID2. My Son just attended the all paid for camp in Casa Grande, Arizona this past December. He was in attendance with some of the best kids in the country. Many kids from the National team were also in attendance as well as coaches from the National team staff. From the boys side the program is run by Gerry Mckeown. He is the DOC of PDA and a total pro. I can see this guy being a national team coach in no time if US soccer new what was good for them. All I can give you is a biased parental opinion. I will say this program is top notch! Very professional and very inclusive. US Club will take anyone that shows up to tryout and has the skill to make the cut. That speaks volumes. Also another flagship of this program is that they are very in tune with the developmental side of kids this age. While I will say that they are not quite ready to make the leap of faith in kids that have not hit puberty yet for their international tour... they do at least bring them to the camp and keep them on the radar. One of its mission statements is that they look for technique over all other things including physicality. However I do believe that even though this program is taking a huge leap with regards to identification and selection... this is still the USA and our mentality of bigger, stronger... finds a way to permeate the ID process. But they are trying. If your child was asked to attend any of these camps or tryouts... I would jump on it immediately. Other than the cost of getting to the camps... everything else is free including tons of ID2 uniforms, socks, bags, sweaters. The staff that puts the program on from US Club is totally professional and like I said before... top notch. Also,,, you want to include your soccer player in environments like this. One of the things that programs like this and the national team looks for is confidence. You want your player to arrive at a camp like this and be comfortable. Exposing them to the best players and letting them realize that they can hang is soooo important. Whether they make a further cut is less important if they realize that just making it to that level is really really good. Hope that helps.\n\nWhat is your experience with other programs? How familiar are you with professional youth programs? How many of them are there in US? Just asking in order to judge the validity of your strong opinion of the id2. There are some very strong words in your post....I've highlighted them.\n\nYonko,\n\nWhen comparing ID2 to ODP, (ID2 was created by US Club to compete with ODP) there is one major positive of ID2. It does pay for all player costs other than transport to the camp, this includes international travel costs if selected for the trip. Regardless of opinions on which provides better training, path to the national team, etc. the fact that ID2 costs are not the player's responsibility makes it currently superior to the ODP program in my opinion. With ODP, unless you can find an individual sponsorship the player/players family is out over $800 just to attend the regional camp, the costs continue to mount if selected to a regional team. USYS uses ODP at the state and regional level as a fund raising program. In my state over 1/2 the kids that sign up for ODP make a state pool. Not because they are talented enough to make it to regionals but because the state association can make more money.\n\nThat said, like ODP, ID2 has many flaws. 1) How will it remain funded if Nike does not see the return on investment 2) On the girls side it is essentially an ECNL selection pool for the ID2 camp pool, (not sure on the boys side how wide the net is cast), 3) The formation of the ID2 program did more to fracture the US youth soccer landscape than unify it.\n\nYonko,\n\nWhen comparing ID2 to ODP, (ID2 was created by US Club to compete with ODP) there is one major positive of ID2.

And I'm already aware of the financial differences between ODP and id2. I'm still in the process in figuring out how much better is the training and coaching in id2 compared to other programs (besides ODP).\n\nThe association between cost and quality is interesting. Some people think the higher the cost, the better the quality must be. Others prefer the lower the cost, the better the value.\n\nI recently discovered that two coaches from close to my area are involved at some capacity with running some parts of the id2 process and I don't have a high opinion of them (these coaches). So it has made me a little suspicious, to be honest."
