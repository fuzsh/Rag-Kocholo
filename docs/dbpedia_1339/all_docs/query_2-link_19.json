        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am hoping to get your thoughts on a topic that I heard discussed (but not personally experienced)--kids moving up and down A & B teams. I was talking to a friend of mine who is a coach at a travel club, and he mentioned that players rarely get moved up or down year over year. He said in the three years he's been coaching, he's seen only two players switch levels.\n\nIt would seem to me that at the younger age groups, the \"A\" teams would be comprised mostly of kids who grew quicker, but I would hope when you get a little older, you'll have some smaller kids that have developed skills and would be assets. Is this not the case?\n\nAdditionally, I talked to a co-worker of mine who mentioned that his daughter opted to quit playing ODP because it was \"too political\". She felt she wasn't treated properly and some weaker players received favorable treatment, presumably due to relationships built up over the years. His daughter became a 4-year starter at a D-I school. It seems to me that these are related issues, but maybe one of you with more experience can elaborate better.\n\nThis tells me that once a kid is pegged as a \"B team\" player, it's extremely difficult to shake that reputation. How do you encourage a young kid to practice and foster a love for the game when people around him/her are saying they're not very good? Maybe that is separate topic, but it's a natural lead-in to the issue at hand. My friend's idea was that if the parent thought their kid was good enough to be on the \"A\" team, their best bet is to switch clubs to get the fairest look.\n\nIn my area (still dominated by town travel teams, but for-profit club model is catching on), the prime time to move up to the \"A\" team occurs when the rosters expand from 9v9 play to 11v11 play (at around U12). That being said, what you said about the stigma is very true and teams rather expand by bringing kids from out of town teams to fill out the roster. The B team kids who may have developed from when the teams were first formed at 9 may get discouraged and either find other town/club teams or leave the sport altogether, further diluting the quality of the B team.\n\nWith the advent of US Club based teams, now I am seeing teams with mixed roster up to 26 kids playing in two separate competitive levels. So the A team and B team dichotomy still exists but with a common trainer and (theoretically) the ability for B team player to play with the A team (either temporarily or permanently). I say theoretically because this system can and do get abused (i.e., the A team player coming down to the B team to play in key games).\n\nIn our youth league a player registered on an A team can not play down on a B team.\n\nHow ever a B team registered player can play up on the A team.\n\nBut everything can be abused unfortunely. Like if there are not enough players for an A and B team. They will take 7 of the A players and register them for the B team. Then they play around with the schedules so those A players registered as B player can play in both games the A team and the B team.\n\nYep, pretty much the ENY rules. Ideally you have a small permanent A team (at U-12 with a max roster of 16, say 9-10 players) the rest are B (and even C or D teams if you have the luxury) and 'earn' the ability to 'play up.' Of course our A team has 14, our B and C teams have 15 each. Very little moving this season.\n\nMost clubs let coaches pick the teams. Problem is that not all good coaches are good at indentifying the best players or the players with the most upside potential. In fact, even being a really excellent coach does not mean that you have a \"good eye\" when it comes to player selection. Add in the politics and natural biases, and what you get is quite inconsistent results in terms of team selection.\n\nMy 12 year old son plays for a large club that has four tiers of teams at U12. U12 here plays 8v8 so each team had 12 players. I consider myself to have a very good eye for talent and I would say they were maybe 75% right with their picks. That's actually pretty bad when you consider how many kids got screwed over. And some of the mistakes were massive; five kids picked for the bottom team should have been placed on one of the top two teams. That's pretty inexcusable in my book. And there was zero opportunity to move up during the seasonal year. No DOCs even went to see either of the bottom two teams play.\n\nSeems to me that if you are going to tier out the teams, you need to give the players on the lower teams lots of motivation and belief that they can climb the ladder. Give the ones who are overperforming a chance to guest play up. Let them know that you recognize their quality. Doesn't seem to happen in most cases I have seen. The B, C and D team players are generally forgotten about.\n\nLet me ask you this, when were the teams selected? I assume you are in the main part of your season now. I find that clubs that make their teams following tryouts in August for a U-12 or U-10 group will be highly inaccurate. Two or three days the previous July are not a good indicator for what the teams 'should' be the following spring.\n\nYes, we choose a certain number of players for the first team during the July tryouts. Only those 6-9 players are guaranteed a spot on team 1. Everyone else is eligible to move up or down between fall training, games, indoor season and winter practices. Ideally we don't make our teams for spring outdoor until early February and even then kids develop in such a way that there will be a few 'misses' (and I am reluctant to use that word because players don't develop on a straight upward line).\n\nAny time you deal with subjective opinions there is going to be differences in opinion. And it is often a matter of comparing apples to oranges to peaches.\n\nFor instance how to value a player who strength is dribbling while sprinting against a player who excells at dribbling to maintain possession or another who excells at dribbling for penetration. How do you value athletic skills vs. ball skills? Is that weighting different at age 8 versus age 14 once you are past the best years for motor skill development? How much weight to give to first touch vs. dribbling vs. passing? How much weight to give to an excellent mentality or a poor one? I suspect metality ratings sometimes factor into a decision regarding players who skills appear to be higher or lower than others on the team. Then what do you do when the player has a problem parent?\n\nThe simplest way to avoid unnecessary differences in opinion is to use one coach (e.g., the DOC) to rate the players. There would be no need to keep others from making recommendations. He would still be using his own standards. Another approach is to use a committee to rate the players.\n\nMy own approach would be to value mentality and athletic ability (not physical maturity) higher before U10. I think early excellence in those two aspects indicate a high potential in all four aspects. (Please understand that I think forming U-Littles into formal teams is a bad approach for player development. I don't think formal teams should be designated before you want to train team tactics.)\n\nThe club picked the u12 teams in May 2014 for the seasonal year that ran from August 2014-May 2015. All rosters were locked immediately and no changes were made. New players were evaluated over two tryout sessions while returning players were only looked at during one session. Despite the fact that many of the returning players hadn't been looked at over the previous year other than by their own coaches. Yes, there is a lot wrong with how this club does it, but my understanding is that it is the norm.\n\nYep and in my area the neutral evaluators are only used in U10 and U11. Starting with U12 and beyond the coach of the team is the evaluator. Add to the fact that the coach is also a parent, there are a lot of complaining.\n\nI like to think my kid could break that cycle even though he has multiple starting disadvantages: born in October (in terms of annual year cutoff programs like odp), small even for his age (even now 5 percentile height and 0 for weight) and pegged as B player when he started at U10. Because he tried out at the same time as his school grade class he was on average about a year younger than the typical athletic competition. I credit all development to his tenacity to not let his size get in the way, but I sought out additional training for him as well. There must be a lot of stories like him out there.\n\nI wish these town teams would recognize this and maintain the quality of the training for B or C kids. What typically happens is that the big athletic kids give up soccer for lacrosse (perceived by parents to be better for scholarships) and the A teams drop from Division 1 prominence in the local leagues or worse fold altogether. If the town teams only had nurtured their B/C players all along, maybe these teams could survive.\n\nNow the for profit clubs are coming into prominence here and The towns are losing their monopoly as the only viable soccer outlets. Now perhaps the B and C players can get the same training as the A kids, but as always only if the kids' parents can pay.\n\nAnd this is the reason we wait as long as possible to make A, B and C teams. Aside from the initial July selection of a percentage of the A players (the appease the 'crazies' who feel they need to go to tryouts and shop around) . We want them training in a pool all coaches see all players. The only reason we make teams is because the league forces us to set a roster.\n\nNick, I believe this is the MOST important job of a coach. You have to make them a fan of the game first if you want to accomplish anything.\n\nAlthough this is true, the mental part is the most likely to change over time. Unfocused kids usually become focused by age 11 or so, whereas unathletic kids are far less likely to become athletic.\n\nEffectively punishing an unfocused 8-10 year old by putting them on a lower-level team than their ability/potential dictates seems particularly short-sighted, especially when you're effectively punishing them for normal childhood behavior. Now, if they are a major behavioral problem that's definitely a different story, but weeding out the \"unfocused\" 8-10 year olds is not a good idea. Those unfocused players may very well be higher energy and more creative than their laser-focused peers, and once they channel that energy and creativity they may well outperform them.\n\nI tend to look at it this way: The super-focused 10 year old is currently performing at the top of his ability, whereas the unfocused 10 year old has unlocked potential just under the surface. If I can unlock that potential, I'm going to see a big improvement in a short amount of time.\n\nThanks. That's awesome.\n\nThe problem, maybe self imposed, is that coaching (at least in our case) is a limited resource. I'd love, sincerely, to handle the development of our B-team players but my schedule cannot accommodate it. We, as a club, decided that we were not the type that was going to take A, B, C teams like our neighboring clubs do. Critically, I think they take on those teams as profit centers because from what I know, very few of the B/C players move up.\n\nAnd yes, I'll admit that the top 9 I named above mostly are fast, coordinated, athletic, powerful, and big for their age. BUT they are also highly motivated, exhibit high soccer IQs, have excellent discipline and work ethic in practice. Of the B-team players I mentioned in the previous post, one I'm really struggling to cut.\n\nI've gotta say from our club's standpoint, we tend to ignore size and speed and to a lesser extent athleticism, at least initially. But yes, it HAS to come into the equation at some point. Our B team has quite a few good athletes that need more time on the ball and/or increasing their soccer IQ.\n\nThinking back to tennis practice in high school, the best training for me was playing a friend who was evenly matched with me. Long rallies so relatively a lot of touches before a point. In a mismatch neither player gets many touches besides their service.\n\nI think this probably holds true in soccer for individual skills and even very small group games. The conventional wisdom about playing with better players making the learning curve faster, however, I don't think applies to individual skills or small groups. Unless the better players hold back, the weaker player will not be getting significant amounts of touches unless in a very small group. And, if the better players hold back, then their training quality is degraded.\n\nThe significance is that for U-Littles the competive level of the team is of relatively little importance. Pressure can be added to training in many ways, not merely by the relative ability level of opponents. More important than the ability of the other players is the quality of the coaching.\n\nThere is no training advantage to making good coaching available only to a small portion of U-Littles, although it is a competive advantage to those lucky players. There is also no training advantage to training U-Little teams separately by individual coaches. While that is a typical practice in competitive team sports, the object of youth sports is (or at least should be) to develop players, not develop teams to win competitions.\n\nThe academy system is a much better training model. It is inclusive. All players receive the organization's best coaching. Coaches have more resources (players) and flexibility. Coaches can mix genders and ages to keep training challenging regardless of the soccer age of the player."
