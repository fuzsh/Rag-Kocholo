        "text": "FIFA Futsal Rankings – Top Futsal Nations Worldwide The FIFA Futsal Rankings determine the best men's national futsal teams in the world, updated monthly. Brazil reigns supreme at #1 having won 5 of 8 FIFA Futsal World Cups and producing stars like Ricardinho. They boast a commanding lead in the rankings. European nations Spain, Portugal, Russia, Italy and Kazakhstan make up the rest of the top 10. Spain and Portugal have strong domestic club leagues and talented national teams. Russia is the current FIFA Futsal World Cup holders while Italy and Kazakhstan frequently qualify for major tournaments. Iran, Argentina, Egypt and Guatemala lead Asian, African and CONCACAF representation in the top 25. Iran's futsal success is built on the widespread popularity of street football played with miniature goals. Argentina and Egypt have talented squads but lack consistency. The rankings demonstrate Brazil's enduring dominance of the indoor 5-a-side game. But competition is heating up with European teams like Russia and Spain determined to showcase their quality on the global stage. The next FIFA Futsal World Cup in 2024 will be hotly contested. #footyware #futsal #futsalrankings #futsalshoes #futsalnews #futsalbal #FIFA #FIFAFutsal #brazil #BrazilFutsal Read more: https://lnkd.in/d5QbXc2F\n\nFIFA Futsal World Rankings: Vietnam Claims Impressive 33rd Position The Vietnamese futsal team under the guidance of coach Diego Guistozzi is currently ranked 33rd in the world. Photo: VFF Previously, FIFA has not ranked national futsal teams. The rankings used by teams are mainly based on the rankings of futsalworldranking.com. Based on this website, the Vietnamese futsal team ranks 44th in the world. However, FIFA has just announced its rankings for the first time, with a total of 139 ranked teams. The initial rankings have been based on statistics gathered from over 4,600 FIFA ‘A’ matches. FIFA defines an international ‘A’ match as a match between two FIFA members for which both members field their first representative team (‘A’ team). According to FIFA information, this ranking system will also serve for classification before drawing lots to divide groups in all upcoming tournaments of the FIFA Futsal World Cup. The system will likewise be used for qualification processes and enable comprehensive and consistent data to be gathered to monitor member associations in accordance with the FIFA Regulations Governing International Matches. This will support the prevention of practices that jeopardize the integrity of the sport, such as match manipulation. Brazil sits at the summit in the first FIFA Futsal Men’s World Ranking. Brazil is the champion team in 9 FIFA Futsal World Cups to date. Next are Portugal and Spain. Portugal is the team present at the 2024 Futsal World Cup as the defending champion and owns two recent European championships. Spain is the team that has won the FIFA Futsal World Cup twice (2000 and 2004), and won the European championship seven times. Thailand is the only representative of Southeast Asia to be listed in the Top 10, and claimed the second place in Asia, after the Iranian team, in the rankings. The Vietnamese women’s futsal team has an impressive ranking on the world rankings. Photo: VFF In the rankings for women’s futsal teams worldwide, 69 teams are ranked. The Vietnamese women’s futsal team ranked 13th in the world, 4th in Asia and 2nd in Southeast Asia. Similar to the rankings for men’s futsal teams, FIFA’s women’s futsal rankings will serve to seed teams for futsal tournaments organized by FIFA, including the first women’s futsal World Cup in 2025. Therefore, being in the Top 4 in Asia can also be considered an advantage for the Vietnamese women’s futsal team. In the women’s game, Brazil’s national team have been just as dominant as their male counterparts, followed by Spain and Portugal. Asia has three representatives listed in the top 10, namely Thailand, Iran, and Japan, which secured the 6th, 8th, and 9th positions, respectively.

India, on the other hand, scored two penalties and clinched the title in a thrilling match that had eight goals in total. Pakistan did not go home empty-handed, though, as they secured the silver medal and the second place in the tournament. The match started with Pakistan taking the lead in the 5th minute with a goal from Abdul Rehman, but India quickly leveled the score in the 7th minute with Jugraj Singh’s goal. The Blues then went ahead in the 10th minute with Maninder Singh’s goal, but Pakistan equalized again in the 13th minute. The first half ended with Pakistan leading 3-2, with Zikriya Hayat scoring another goal just before the break. The second half saw both teams playing with intensity, resulting in three more goals, with Arshad Liaquat scoring for Pakistan in the 19th minute. However, India’s Mohammad Raheel scored twice in the second half, making it a draw. The match was decided in the penalty shootout, where Pakistan’s penalty takers, Mohammad Murtaza and Arshad, missed their chances, while India’s Maninder and Gujrot Singh scored their penalties and won the match. Both Pakistan and India have qualified for the 2024 Hockey5s World Cup, which will be held in Muscat, Oman. #pakhockey #hockey #hockeygame #hockeylife #asiahockey #currentaffair #currentaffairs #CurrentAffairsMCQs #currentaffairs2023 #currentaffairsquiz #currentaffairschallenge #currentaffairsupdates #CurrentNews #currentnews #currentnewsupdate #currentnewsreport #pakistan #pakistani #pakistantimes #pakistantime #pakistantimes\n\nT20 World Cup, Australia beat Namibia by 9 wickets (Photo: Kirkinfo) Australia beat Namibia by 9 wickets in ICCT20 World Cup.
