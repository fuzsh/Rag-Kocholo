        "text": "Hey there!\n\nI find myself having low-energy for some matches and a lot of energy for others. I Would like to know what your pre-match routine is for maximum energy, from the night before, to kickoff. I usually have a breakfast of cereal and a ham and egg sandwich with coffee or tea, then i usually have a pre-lunch snack of milk and some form of carbs. Then a random lunch that is low in gluten. And then a snack like a granola bar 20 min before game. Are there any physical activities that I should do pregame as well? Let me know!\n\nEat three hours before a match and not later then that.\n\nFor myself I like to play hungry so I just drank water before a match. Do not do that it worked for me.\n\nYou want to be warmed up enough to be ready to play at real game speed from the start of the game. If you do that there is a good chance of not playing flat in the beginning of games. So don't make it a little baby short warm up. Let the warm up be a real warm uo.\n\n1. Jogging\n\n2. High knees\n\n3. Long stride (like a drum major leading a band on the field)\n\n4. Backwards run (encourage long stride and arm action)\n\n5. Skip (low and high)\n\n6. Touch Ground (touch hand to ground to side as you are jogging)\n\n7. Karaoke (sideways - trail foot alternates between steps in front and in\n\nback of lead foot)\n\n8. Shuffle (sideways, lower body, feet don't touch)\n\n9. Hip Flexes (player lifts and moves knee so it does a big circle)\n\n10. Hops\n\n11. Sprint\n\n12. Jump and simulate a header\n\n-------------\n\nThen move into warming up in groups seperately.\n\nKeepers are warmed out seperately.\n\nBacks -- pass to each other back and across the field and back again.\n\nMids-- pass to each other back and across the field.\n\nStrikers work together with servers on served short and long balls and turn with the ball or back pass to the server or control longer balls like crosses.\n\nThen they all join and start passing within all the groups combined.\n\n--------------\n\nThen when they are all warmed up enough. Then they can start to finish those kind of chances on net under no pressure. Then add some pressure.\n\nThen when the game begins kick their ass\n\nFor me, it started the day before.\n\nEat right and hydrate the day before. Limit things that would spike salt, fat, or sugars. Go to bed early, like between 8-10. No later.\n\nDay of the match, work backwards from the beginning of warm-up and three hours have a normal meal. Top it off with bites of something if you feel hungry in between. A few bites of a banana or, personally, some oatmeal. It won't harm you to take about 5 ounces of coffee anywhere from an hour to 15 minutes before kickoffâ€”caffeine gives your body a natural boost physically and psychologically.\n\nLearn to listen to your body. Tiredness is part of the feedback loop for an athlete. On match day your training cycle should have you at a peak, so if you're tired then either your training cycle is off, you're over-training, you don't have enough or the right fuel in your body, or you are not rested enough.\n\nVisualization helps too. Find a place, close your eyes and visualize yourself playing football energetically and successfully for several minutes.\n\nI suspect dehydration is a problem. You mentioned eating and drinking things that dehydrate and never mentioned water. Drink water before a match, a sports drink afterwards.\n\nAs mentioned previously don't eat right before a match. Cereral, bread, pasta or any other complex carbohydrate is the worse thing to eat right before a match as that type of food takes the longest to digest. Digestion takes about a third of your blood supply. That is oxygen that is going to digestion instead of to your muscles. Do I need to spell out what cutting your available blood supply by 30% does to your performance?\n\nhttp://www.freetrainers.com/FT/jsp/Message.jsp?f_ix=3&t_ix=3122\n\nI woke up yesterday at 630 AM. Worked a full day from 8 AM to 5 PM. Coached my team for 1.5 hours at 6 PM. Ate a roll and a small bowl of cheerios at 8:15 and was off to my game by 9 PM. Needless to say I was dragging during the match. I didn't bring any water with me for the sidelines, I had no energy because I didn't have good energy stored up during the day, and I didn't hydrate properly throughout the day.\n\nI had heard, but can't confirm that Roger Bannister knocked one out right before the race when he was the first to break the 4 minute mile.\n\nMy personal belief is that the release of endorphins is, probably, a good thing for the body. Especially if it is right before an exercise activity. Of course, I'm talking a relatively light affair here.\n\nIsn't this an issue everytime the World Cup rolls around? One team will ban their players from having sex. On one level, it makes a ton of sense. It's a short tournament, there's a very limited amount of time for recovery between matches and training so why expend more energy having sex.\n\nI think it was an Argentinian player that said that it isn't the act of sex alone that makes it a no-no but also all the time and effort that goes into getting it. He was talking about being out in the party atmosphere of the World Cup.\n\nElessar is correct about the Argentine. Lately I have been training people very early followed by coaching in the afternoons and getting up at 5 am everyday to after getting to bed at 11am. It has been 8 weeks like this and I have never agreed more about the importance of sleep. There is nothing that can replace quality sleep over time. Everything is hard when you are tired.\n\nHere are some good sleep tips-\n\n1. Pitch black room, no lights whatsoever even if you are scared of the dark and want a little soccer ball night light. make it a cave!\n\n2. Avoid caffeine 6 hours prior to bed.\n\n3. More than a little alcohol disrupts sleep so careful with that.\n\n4. Dont stuff yourself with hard to digest foods.\n\n5. The more active you are and on your feet during the day the better you should sleep.\n\n6. Melatonin is a good supplement to help.\n\nSleep un-interrupted is the main factor for energy. (and hydration)\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you are looking for but to check out her health and nutrition you can calculate her BMI, there's many sources on the internet that show you how to calculate it. You can go to a clinic and have them take a blood sample and analyze if she's lacking anything in her diet. Training wise, she can pretty much play/train every day unless it's an intense training where a days rest is usually sufficient, best thing though is to always listen to your body, if she's are still sore and tired on the day it's best to skip training.\n\nThat's right idea"
