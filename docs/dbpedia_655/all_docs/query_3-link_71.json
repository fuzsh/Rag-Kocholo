        "text": "The dojo training philosophy is that all people, men and women, young and old, can participate and develop themselves. At Aikido Northshore students range in age from 4-75 years. It does not matter at what level of strength you begin, but every class you try to advance yourself a little bit. This philosophy is one of the reasons many people that practice Aikido feel it helps their daily life. The dojo atmosphere is one of openness and generosity dedicated to hard work and success of all students.\n\nAikido Northshore is affiliated with the national organization Aikido Schools of Ueshiba, founded by Mitsugi Saotome Shihan who was a 15 year resident student of O’Sensei.\n\nAikido Northshore is a federal 501.c non-profit organization and welcomes all students who can safely participate in our programs. All of our classes are open for free observation.\n\nAikido Northshore is open to any person who safely can participate in our programs and activities regardless of race, color, national and ethnic origin, ancestry, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender variance, marital status, and mental or physical disability, and all such persons will be afforded the rights, privileges, programs and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of any of the above in administration of its educational politics, athletics, or other school-administered programs.\n\nOur dojo is managed by an all volunteer board of dojo members. The current board members are:\n\nPresident: Jerry Steiert\n\nVice President: Roger Harwood\n\nSecretary: Elizabeth Bailey\n\nTreasurer: Warren Schramm\n\nDojo Cho: Marianne Baker\n\nMember at Large: Shawn Miller\n\nLee Crawford Sensei, 6th Dan, is Chief Instructor at Aikido Northshore. Crawford Sensei began her aikido training in 1980 under the direction of Akira Tohei Shihan at the University of Wisconsin Aikido Club. After relocating to Seattle in 1988, she became the Assistant Chief Instructor for George Ledyard Sensei at Aikido Eastside in Bellevue, WA. In 1995 Crawford Sensei opened Aikido Northshore in Kirkland, WA.\n\nCrawford Sensei has trained extensively under the direct instruction of Mitsugi Saotome Shihan and Hiroshi Ikeda Shihan. She also includes Kevin Choate Sensei and Patty Saotome Sensei as having strong influences on her aikido.\n\nIn 2014 Crawford Sensei was awarded the Ueshiba Juku designation by Saotome Shihan. This honor identifies those who are in a direct line of succession from O'Sensei through Saotome Shihan.\n\nJosh Drachman has been training in Soshinkan Karate Jissenjuku under the instruction of Kenji Ushiro Sensei since 2007. He is in charge of the Seattle branch of Soshinkan Karate, and one of two students with permission to lead classes in Soshinkan Karate in North America. Josh has over 40 years of Aikido experience. He is a Rokudan in ASU, a member of Ueshiba Juku and a founding member of the ASU Board of Directors. He translated Ushiro Kenji Sensei’s “Karate and Ki” and “Ushiro Karate, practical philosophy of Bujitsu'' as well as Mitsugi Saotome Sensei’s “A Light on Transmission” among other books on classical martial arts.\n\nHe believes passionately in the transformative value of ki-based karate and martial arts and their role in developing human potential and a harmonious society. Karate classes focus on Soshinkan’s five basic kata and their applied techniques. People of all ages and levels of experience are most welcome to attend his classes."
