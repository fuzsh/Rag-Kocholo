        "text": "Aikido and Iaido are Ways to refine and improve one’s character through discipline, respect toward others, tempering negative reactions and responses, and commitment to training. Enjoy practice.\n\nNomura Sensei began aikido training in 1975. In 1979, she co-founded West Los Angeles Aikido Institute. In 1981, she began training with T. Kazuo Chiba Shihan in aikido, weapons, and iaido. In 1982, she began iaido training with Takeshi Mitsuzuka, Grand Master of San Shin Kai, Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido. She founded Aikido Institute of San Francisco in June, 1999. T.K. Chiba Shihan promoted Nomura Sensei sixth Dan in January, 2000, and to Birankai Shihan in January, 2002. She was certified as Shihan by Aikikai Hombu, Tokyo, Japan in November, 2006. Nomura Sensei was certified as 7th Dan by Aikikai Hombu dojo in January of 2017. She is a member of the Senior Council of Birankai North America.\n\nEvery technique, every class, we seek to give 100%; to be fully present and committed to the task at hand. We train to greet the world with our full spirit.\n\nBelt Sensei is the chief Instructor at Ventura Aikikai. He began his aikido training in 1978 by attending a class at Ventura College taught by Nobu Iseri Shihan. Soon after starting, he was fortunate enough to attend an aikido seminar that really opened his eyes and he has been training ever since. He has studied intensively with T.K. Chiba Shihan. Belt Sensei was awarded Shihan (master teacher certification) by T.K. Chiba Shihan in 2010. He is a member of the Senior Council of Birankai North America (BNA) and was a longtime member of the BNA examination committee. He has studied Iaido (Japanese swordsmanship) since 1994.\n\nAikido is not always a harmonious journey, but one that is also full of conflict and the reality of one’s own limitations. Through the process of physical training we gain personal and spiritual growth and learn more about ourselves and others.\n\nStier Sensei began training in 1973 with the UMass Aikido Club under the direction of Dr. Taitetsu Unno Sensei, a professor of Buddhist Studies and former student of Akira Tohei Sensei. During his time with UMass Aikido he met his eventual teachers, Paul Sylvain and Lorraine DiAnne Shihan. Stier Sensei helped them build their first dojo, Amherst Aikikai upon their return in 1979 from their special training with T.K. Chiba Shihan in Japan. He met Chiba Sensei in 1980 and developed a special relationship that played an important role in his Aikido development. After Sylvain Sensei’s death, he became co-head instructor of Valley Aikido until opening Green River Aikido in 2005. Chiba Sensei formally accepted him as his student and Green River Aikido as active members of Birankai North America in 2011. In 2015, Stier Sensei was honored to be awarded Shihan (master teacher certification) by Chiba Shihan. He serves on the Senior Council of Birankai North America.\n\nFrank Apodaca Sensei began his Aikido training in November 1985 at San Diego Aikikai under the direction of T. K. Chiba, 8th Dan, Shihan.

In 1971, as a student at Northern Illinois University, Browne Sensei began training in Aikido as a charter member of the NIU Aikido club. In 1975 she continued her Aikido training as a founding member of the Midwest Aikido Center, which was established in Chicago under the direction of Akira Tohei Shihan. In 1978 Browne Sensei moved to Tokyo to train intensively at the Aikido Hombu dojo. Upon arrival at Hombu, she had the privilege of meeting and training with T.K. Chiba Shihan. It was at Hombu in 1978 that Browne Sensei received her Shodan in Aikido from Aikido Doshu, Kisshomaru Ueshiba. After returning to the US in 1980, she continued her study of Aikido with Tohei Sensei. In 1992, Browne Sensei and her husband John Gussman opened the Martial Arts Training Service and began teaching classes in Judo, Jujitsu and Aikido, which led to the creation of the Fox Valley Aikikai. In 1994 the Fox Valley Aikikai affiliated with T. K. Chiba Shihan.\n\nBrowne Sensei holds the rank of 8th Dan, Professor in Danzanryu Jujitsu from Shoshin Ryu Yudansha-kai and 6th Dan, Shihan in Aikido from Birankai North America.\n\nBrowne Sensei currently serves as Chair of the BNA Ethics Committee and is a member of the Senior Council of Birankai North America.\n\nJobe Groot Sensei began training in Aikido in 1977 at Victoria Aikikai. He trained for over 15 years as a close personal student of Y. Kawahara Shihan and F.I. Ishiyama Shihan, and participated in many seminars conducted by some of the most prominent Aikido instructors of the time. In the late 1980s, after several impactful encounters with T.K. Chiba Shihan, Groot Sensei began training with Chiba Shihan, travelling often to train at San Diego Aikikai, and seminars and intensives conducted by Chiba Sensei.\n\nGroot Sensei is the founder and Chief Instructor of Mountain Coast Aikikai. He holds the rank of Rokudan (6th dan) and the teaching certification of Shihan (master instructor). He has served as a member of the Birankai North America Examination Committee and currently serves as a member of the Senior Council of Birankai North America.\n\nIn addition to Aikido, Groot Sensei has studied human physiology, fitness and conditioning, as well as extensive training in other martial arts and related mind-body integration disciplines, notably: Yoga, Qi-gong, Ju-Jitsu, Karate and Japanese swordsmanship.\n\nGroot Sensei has travelled extensively to instruct at seminars and training intensives in Canada, United States, Europe and South-East Asia.\n\nRodger Park began his study of Aikido in 1989 at the University of Rochester Aikido Club, Rochester, New York.

He has served as Chair of the Birankai NA Teachers’ Council and on its national Examination Committee, and presently is a member of its Senior Council.\n\nThroughout his study, Park Sensei has broadened his training through regular participation in seminars and training camps conducted by many of the Shihan (master teachers) in the United States, as well as seminars conducted by visiting instructors from the Aikikai Hombu (World Headquarters) Dojo in Tokyo, Japan. He has traveled to Japan for short periods to train at Hombu Dojo and at the Ichikukai Dojo near Tokyo. Over the years, he has complemented his martial arts training with extensive training in other arts and movement systems, including yoga, Pilates, mixed martial arts, and CrossFit™. He also holds a coaching certification in the Original Strength – Resets™ movement system.\n\nT. K. Chiba Shihan, founder (in memoriam)\n\n8th dan\n\nFounder of Birankai\n\n(February 5, 1940 – June 5, 2015) T. K. Chiba was born in 1940 in Tokyo, Japan. At 14 years of age, he began serious Judo training at the International Judo Academy. Two years later, he began the study of Shotokan Karate, but still felt that he had not found what he sought in the martial arts. In 1958, he discovered Aikido and began seven years of intensive live-in study as an uchideshi (private student) of Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of the art. By 1960, Chiba Sensei had earned the rank of sandan (third-degree black belt) and was dispatched to the city of Nagoya to establish a branch school and to serve as its full-time instructor. In 1962, he was awarded fourth dan rank and began instructing at Aikikai Hombu Dojo. Within three years, during which time he taught at many local universities, he completed his training as uchideshi, and was promoted to fifth dan.\n\nIn 1966, Chiba Sensei was invited to the United Kingdom to teach Aikido. He formed the Aikikai of Great Britain, which later became the British Aikido Federation. In 1970, he was awarded the rank of sixth dan and the title of Shihan. Though he left Britain in 1975, he later served as Technical Director of the British Aikikai, a group formed by his original students in the UK. Upon his return to Japan from Britain, he resumed teaching at Aikikai Hombu Dojo, and became Secretary of the International Department of Hombu Dojo. He also began intensive study of Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido under Mitsuzuka Takeshi Sensei during this period.\n\nIn 1981, Chiba Sensei accepted an invitation from the United States Aikido Federation (USAF) and moved to San Diego, California, where he established his own school, San Diego Aikikai, and in time took on leadership of the Western Region of the USAF. In January of 2000, Chiba Sensei officially formed Birankai International, an international Aikido community that now includes nine country organizations. In 2001, he founded Birankai North America as a separate organization from the USAF. He held the post of Technical Director of Birankai North America until his retirement in 2010. Chiba Sensei passed away on June 5, 2015.\n\nJack Arnold Shihan (in memoriam)\n\n7th dan\n\nFounder and former Chief Instructor, Aikido Daiwa\n\nArnold Sensei began his study of Aikido in the 1950s in New York City. When his career as a percussionist took him to Los Angeles, he joined Los Angeles Aiki Kai, then began teaching on his own in 1979. When T. K. Chiba Shihan arrived in California, Arnold Sensei aligned with him; their relationship of mutual respect and loyalty endured throughout years of training and organizational changes. In 2006, Arnold Sensei traveled with Chiba Sensei and a dozen other American and European senior instructors to receive the rank of Shihan (master teacher) at Hombu Dojo – an unprecedented event for those of non-Japanese descent. The honor was followed, in April 2010, by Jack’s elevation to nanadan (seventh-degree black belt), making him the most highly ranked member of Birankai after Chiba Sensei.\n\nIn 2011, the sale of the dojo building resulted in a forced move and, at the age of 82, Arnold Sensei, aided by his enthusiastic students, relocated Aikido Daiwa to its present Magnolia Boulevard location where until May of 2014 he taught six classes per week and where his spirit continues to reside. Arnold Sensei passed away on November 5, 2014, with his wife Melinda and several of his devoted students at his side.\n\nNobuo F. Iseri Shihan (in memoriam)\n\n6th dan\n\nNobuo F. Iseri was a pioneer of Aikido on the west coast. He began his training in 1958, and received his Shodan (1st dan) certificate when O-Sensei was signing them personally.\n\nIseri Sensei began teaching Aikido in Ventura County through City Parks and Recreation classes, which led to a position teaching Aikido at Ventura College in 1975. It was here that Iseri Sensei started building his student base, which enabled him to open a permanent dojo, The Moving Centre (now Ventura Aikikai) in 1985. Iseri Sensei was among the first California instructors to welcome Chiba Sensei to San Diego, and became a founding member of the USAF/WR Teaching Committee. Iseri Sensei was promoted to Rokudan (6th dan) in 1996, and in 2001, was among the first foreign instructors to be promoted to Shihan (Master Teacher).\n\nIn his professional life, Iseri Sensei was a nurse practitioner, as well as an excellent jazz musician, playing trombone and percussion. For many years, he participated in the ‘Artist in the Classroom’ program for Ventura County schools, bringing Aikido to a new generation.\n\nIseri Sensei passed away on December 29, 2001, doing what he loved, teaching Aikido. He is remembered by his many students and friends for his kindness, curiosity, common sense, and commitment to Aikido as a path for personal growth.\n\nMorihiko (Mark) Murashige Shihan (in memoriam)\n\n6th dan\n\nFormer Assistant Chief Instructor, San Diego Aikikai\n\nJust train. That’s it.\n\nMurashige Sensei was born in Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan, in 1945. He began studying Aikido in 1962, with his father, Aritoshi Murashige, and went on to study under the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, as well as Seigo Yamaguchi Sensei, for six years. In 1978 he moved to San Diego, California, to work as a sushi chef at his brother’s restaurant. In 1981, when Chiba Sensei moved to San Diego, he joined San Diego Aikikai, eventually holding the post of Assistant Instructor. He attained the rank of sixth dan and was awarded the title of Shihan in 2002. Murashige Sensei passed away in October 2013"
