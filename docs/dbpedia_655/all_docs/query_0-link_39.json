        "meta_description": "N-polar aluminum nitride (AlN) is an important building block for next-generation high-power RF electronics. We report successful homoepitaxial growth of N-polar AlN by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on large-area cost-effective N-polar AlN templates. Direct growth without any in-situ surface cleaning leads to films with inverted Al-polarity. It is found that Al-assisted cleaning before growth enables the epitaxial film to maintain N-polarity. The grown N-polar AlN epilayer with its smooth, pit-free surface duplicates the structural quality of the substrate as evidenced by a clean and smooth growth interface with no noticeable extended defects generation. Near band-edge photoluminescence peaks are observed at room temperature on samples with MBE-grown layers but not on the bare AlN substrates, implying the suppression of non-radiative recombination centers in the epitaxial N-polar AlN. These results are pivotal steps towards future high-power RF electronics and deep ultraviolet photonics based on the N-polar AlN platform.",
