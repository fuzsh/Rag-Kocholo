Tohei Shihan leaves behind his wife Joanne Kiyoko Tohei and son Akihiro Tohei.\n\nTohei Shihan, or just Sensei, as he was known to the tens of thousands of students whose lives he touched, brought to the United States Midwest Region much more than any words can express.\n\nIt is not possible to put on paper the gratitude students feel towards Sensei, who helped each individual student grow from Aikido infants unable to walk or speak to young adults in Aikido practice, able to appreciate the path laid down by O-Sensei. The words here chosen can only pale to the life of such a great practitioner and teacher."
