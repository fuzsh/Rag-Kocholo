        "text": "Celebrate Aldrich Sensei’s existence! (Or come for the sake and cake!)\n\nWhat is this about?\n\nIt started with, “Hey, it’s my birthday. Let’s have a seminar!” and now it’s morphed into this uniquely beautiful opportunity of connection, charity, camaraderie, and a heck of a time.\n\nThen followed the “I don’t need gifts, and I feel it oddly selfish to host a seminar solo.”\n\nWhere is this going?\n\nWhen in doubt, I turn to my friends. My good friend, Angel Murphy Sensei, was inspired by my recent adventure to open a dojo. She’s been teaching for years in a YMCA space but is now taking the leap to have a permanent location. How better to express gratitude than helping a fellow lover of Aikido build their space? If you’re truly thankful for what you have, you are compelled to pay it forward.\n\nHowever, if you know me, I never do things simple. When the New York Aikikai launched their Capital Campaign, I wanted to help. As a new business owner, extra capital is not something I have. Abundance of work ethic? I’ve got a boatload of that! So, this shifted from celebrating my existence to giving back to the world I’m grateful for. (Don’t worry; there will still be cake.) So I reached for one of my many New York Aikikai friends, Jaime Kahn Sensei.\n\nAngel Walker Murphy Sensei (Shidoin, 5th Dan) is the Chief Instructor of Alamo Area Aikikai in San Antonio, Texas. She has been studying Aikido for three decades. She has a rich, colorful Aikido history. She started with the Midwest Aikido Federation under the guidance of Akira Tohei Shihan in 1994 and was included in his Kenshusei program. She was fortunate to have Hayato Osawa Shihan awarded her Shodan. In the early 2000s, she connected with the USAF, and her aikido was influenced by Y. Yamada Shihan, S. Sugano Shihan, and M. Kanai Shihan. Over the years, she has developed a connection with Harvey Konigsberg Shihan, who visits Texas regularly. I met Angel Sensei back at Summer Camp 2015. She and I connected with our zest, zing, and sparkle on the mat. I admire her adaptive and inclusive training/teaching style. She holds a regal presence on the mat, welcoming everyone to partake in the journey. I find her inspiring for women on the mat. Her command in her technique is very refreshing.\n\nJaime Kahn Sensei (Shidoin, 6th Dan) of the New York Aikikai … where to begin? I’d say I had an Aikido life before Jaime Sensei, but once we met, it never existed. That’s how much Jaime Sensei brings to the mat. First introduced to Aikido in a class at NYU, he says that, for him, Aikido was “Love at first fall,” He presents a fiery heart with every pin and every throw. He was uchi deshi at the New York Aikikai in the 90’s, training with some of the top teachers in the world. On top of being incredibly talented, he is the most humble and supportive person. He views the world with gratitude and is excited to join us as we support New York Aikikai’s Captial Campaign."
