Through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s the dojo was in the Midwest region of the USAF under Akira Tohei, Shihan. Since 2004 it has been under the Eastern region of the USAF under Yoshimitsu Yamada, Shihan and since 2023 under members of the USAF technical committee. These teachers have had a major influence on all the TCAC instructors.\n\n<\n\n►\n\n>\n\nJeff Albright, Rokudan (6th Dan), began studying Aikido in 1992 at Twin Cities Aikido Center under Akira Tohei Shihan. He found himself in Japan training under the Masando Sasaki Shihan and Morihei Iio Shihan lineage. He has trained with over 30 aikido shihan throughout Japan and has been influenced by Hiroshi Ikeda Shihan, and Haruo Matsuoka Shihan. He also studied Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu Iaido (nidan, 1998) and attended ichikukai ascetic training."
