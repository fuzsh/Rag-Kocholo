        "text": "This should be very interesting.\n\nI've held out posting on this subject in hopes that other people far more qualified than I am would pick this point up, but that's not happening. Alas my own scholastic ability in Chinese is almost non-existent due to my personal laziness so I'll have to hack away at it. Hopefully my pathetic attempts will inspire the more knowledgeable to chime in. I will attempt to be extremely critical while still maintaining a level of civility. Some may view overt criticism by a young and not particularly talented martial arts practitioner as uncivil, and if that is the case I remind them that we are conducting this discussion in English on a website hosted in the United States where we have a tradition of open, tough minded public discourse.\n\nAs to David's point regarding the use of Chinese metaphysical tools to describe fighting arts:\n\nI agree with Rob that much of East Asia has worked hard to shift away from using these conceptual models and towards a scientific method. I am confused as to why someone would voluntarily subscribe to discredited ways of knowing.\n\nAs Trevor alluded to earlier, science is not simply another discourse, coequal with Chinese metaphysics, Navajo mythology or Japanese Shinto. Rather, per Karl Popper it is about establishing theories which are capable of being falsified. That is, there is a way of testing the truth of the matter.\n\nThe problem with the intuitive method of learning which David has championed is two fold. First of all, it is inherently hierarchal and anti-democratic. This may not be a concern to you, however, as a person living in what is theoretically a Western democracy it is a concern to me. I would personally not choose to participate in a system of knowledge which tells me that I cannot find the answers for myself unless I spend decades following someone else.\n\nSecond, this method has produced demonstrably poor results, which is why both Japan and later (with much greater difficulty) China have abandoned it. This method, whatever its other benefits never developed calculus and physics. Free exchange and inquiry in Europe allowed the flowering of modern science. Failure to embrace the free exchange of information rendered China poor, backwards and incompetent to deal with foreign invasion, because Chinese imperial government officials could not deal with technology, and ultimately with the Western way of war. We are discussing martial arts on this board. Martial arts originally justified their existence through their effectiveness in the face of opponents. Unfortunately for China, the non-rationalist way of knowing proved rather inadequate in the face of close order drill. Very intelligent people in Japan realized this and took drastic steps to remake the Japanese mind. In a broader sense, we also see that the iterative, non-hierarchal way of knowing also provides for a greater freedom for individuals to learn as they see fit, and yields tangible results. The rise of the Linux operating system is a good current day example of this.\n\nDavid has asserted that the intuitive, neo-Confucian, non-rationalist way of knowing is traditional. It really depends on whose tradition we are discussing. Some of the finest minds in East Asia wrestled with the idea of how to reconcile neo-Confucian and Buddhist thought with the modern era, among them Yoshida Shoin, Kang Youwei, Tan Sitong, and Liang Qichao.\n\nKang deserves special notice because he is widely regarded (by historians in the field) as the last of the great scholars of the imperial era. He also came to see at the end of his life that the hierarchal nature of Chinese society was fundamentally unjust and the cause of much misery, which again plays right back into my first point. It seems that David himself acknowledges this when he writes about his concerns that the school system in Japan and the United States stamp creativity and free movement out of its students through forcing people to bow down to a hierarchy. An insistence on the use of a subjective and non-rationalist, intuitive way of knowing will actually strengthen hierarchy.\n\nIn the end they realized that rationalist thought was superior in the realm of the material. Martial arts, whatever there other benefits, exist in the realm of the material because we are looking at tangible results, i.e. does this throw work? Can I develop so-called short power? Can I neutralize the force with a touch (ala Shioda)?\n\nI realize that one could construe my argument to be a radical Spencerian/Social Darwinist viewpoint. I am only arguing about the means and the methods of violent confrontation, and not making a normative claim about wider social issues.\n\nThis is not to say that there is no place for metaphysics or the discussion of subjective aspects like feelings. There is, but it has to happen in the context of looking for repeatable results. That's the rationalist way.\n\nDavid has made some other statements about measuring human feelings being beyond measurement. This is not the case. A very good friend of mine is a Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience. A large portion of his work is about addiction, and finding ways to detect and quantify obsessive/thrill seeking/drug seeking behavior.\n\nI will admit that my views on this subject are colored by my family history and personal experiences. It is rather difficult for me to be objective on this subject. I am typing this post in English, sitting in America because of the early 20th century collapse of the Chinese state which I, and others far more erudite than I am, chalk up to a fundamental failure to grasp rationalist thought. It was the reason that my grandparents could never go home, and it is the reason that many of my friend's families were subjected to horrific suffering. Please understand I treasure my copy of Chan Wing Tsit's Chinese philosophy source-book, and I mourn for the passing of what in many ways was a more sustainable and less volatile way of life.\n\nNonetheless, in a modern, rationalist democratic world there really is very little room for the neo-Confucian way of knowing. There is even less room for it in the very pragmatic world of martial arts.**\n\nI hope people find this post interesting and useful, and I welcome correction and harsh criticism. That's the whole point.\n\n**I respect enormously the amount of time and commitment that koryu practitioners have put in to their study of the art. I enjoy their articles. But I profoundly disagree with the pedagogical method. Koryu is also not something I would be interested in doing, for the reasons I've listed above.\n\nI think these conversations are really fascinating to watch because they represent a trend that started more than a decade ago. As more bits and pieces of knowledge about how to train ki and kokyu come out (and Rob's teacher is obviously showing a good and recognizable approach to some of these things, even if it's not exactly what I do/learned) there are always these head-to-head discussions with people who have studied martial arts for years, have some place in the hierarchies, but who for some reason weren't shown how to train these things. I guess that's nothing knew, really, if you look at the fact that some of Ueshiba's top deshi had to go outside in order to learn these things.... and they just did it without arguing that there was nothing big that they didn't know.\n\nBut overall, watching this thawing of the ice where someone who has found out that there was more actual substance to this stuff about ki and kokyu than most practitioners are aware of is pretty interesting and it keeps running into the same problems: knowledge is limited and \"established\" teachers will almost never easily accept the idea that there is anything major that they don't know.\n\nI still learn stuff. Each time I do find out more (these things are complex subjects, not the few simple things I wish they were) I am so glad that I haven't taught a group of students and found out that I left out some key piece of information. I would hate to have taught someone wrongly who gave me dues and loyalty.... they would have deserved better. But another reason is that this stuff is slowly coming out of the woodwork and within another 10-20 years a lot of it will be common knowledge.... so any \"students\" are ultimately going to be able to look back and know which teachers were clueless about ki and kokyu. And there's no way to defend against the inexorable obviousness of this. I think Rob, by commenting that he knows people who have studied a long, long time and yet who don't even know some of the basics of the stuff Akuzawa has showed him... I think that's what you're going to see start happening more and more. And there's no way for anyone to hold their ground and keep the knowledge away by simply denying there can be something they don't know. This is too big.\n\nThe good news is that real martial arts knowledge, in general, is improving and is getting more available to true enthusiasts. It's a positive thing.\n\nFWIW\n\nMike"
