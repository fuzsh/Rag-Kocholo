        "text": "Robert Klein is Chief Instructor at Aikido of Hilo.\n\nHe is Nanadan (7th Degree Black Belt) of the\n\nAikikai Foundation with over 50 years of aikido experience.\n\n​\n\nSadly, Barbara Klein, our past Chief Instructor,\n\npassed away in a bicycle/car accident on\n\nOctober 3, 2023. She led our dojo 43 years.\n\nShe is sorely missed by so many.\n\n​\n\nBarbara and Robert Klein began aikido training under Eddie Hagihara Sensei of Long Island Aikikai in New York and studied with Howard Pashenz and Edgar Kann, instructors of the Long Island Aikido Assn. in Suffolk County. They also visited New York Aikikai often for regular training and seminars.\n\nUnder the regional shihan, Yoshimitsu Yamada of New York, NY and Mitsunari Kanai of Cambridge, MA, they attended annual Summer Camps of the USAF Eastern Region, learning from many visiting sensei.\n\nIn 1975, Robert began study of chiropractic near Chicago and the Kleins began practice under Akira Tohei Sensei, shihan of the Midwest Region. Training weekly at the Midwest Aikido Center, they also taught at the Glen Ellyn Aikido Club.\n\nIn 1980, they moved to Hilo, Hawaii and founded Aikido of Hilo. Since that time, the Kleins studied under three Hawaii shihan, Sadao Yoshioka, Takaji Ishida and Robert Aoyagi, under the numerous sensei of the\n\nAikikai Hombu who enjoy visiting Hawaii and under the Aikido Doshu (Kisshomaru Ueshiba and Moriteru Ueshiba).\n\nGeography and Aikido History have favored Hawaii. There are many dojos and a large number of senior sensei locally, in addition to the numerous visitors we receive. Information and links to many dojos are at the Aikido Hawaii site.\n\nThe Kleins continued to travel for further training, whenever possible, to seminars and camps in throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and frequently to Japan. Their teaching reflects the influence from a multitude of sources which all contribute to our harmonious practice.\n\n​"
