It is a traditional dojo which was founded by Norio Mamura Sensei and continues to be guided by the principles and standards he established.\n\nThe dojo originated at a time when aikido first came to the Midwest. It has a deep history with instruction in the early years coming from Clyde Takaguchi, Shihan and instructors from Chicago including Yoshihiko Hirata Sensei and Isao Takahashi Sensei.\n\nThe Milwaukee Aikido Club was one of the original members of the Midwest Aikido Federation. For over 30 years the dojo had a close relationship with Akira Tohei, Shihan and many dojos throughout the Midwest. It was during this time that the dojo was also connected with the United States Aikido Federation. More recently, the club has spent time as a member dojo of the Aikido Schools of Ueshiba organization, run by Mitsugi Saotome, Shihan and has been in close contact with Hiroshi Ikeda, Shihan."
