Some of them I have only taken a single seminar (or even a single class) with. Others I have known for decades. A few that I owe a real debt for training, I have no pictures for.\n\nHere are a few photos reflecting my contact with them over the years. (I have purposely omitted Yukio Kawahara-sensei and Hayato Osawa-sensei, who I will cover separately.)\n\nAgain, in many cases I donâ€™t know who took these pictures. My sincere apologies for using them without acknowledgement. As well, I have forgotten some the names of some people in the photos, for which I apologize."
