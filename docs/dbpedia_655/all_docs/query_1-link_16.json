        "text": "About Our Dojo\n\nOur dojo is a bright, inviting, open space, with a mat surface of over 4,000 square feet, making it one of the largest dedicated Aikido dojo in the world. We have two clean, spacious dressing rooms, each with showers. We are conveniently located near the intersection of Damen and Montrose, steps from the Brown Line El. Abundant street parking is available.\n\nMembership\n\nYou can join as an Adult Member anytime. No contracts required. Instead, modest monthly dues allow adults to attend as many classes per month as they wish. Simply visit the dojo during any class time and a member will be happy to sign you up! If you want to begin the same day we recommend arriving 30 minutes before class giving you adequate time to fill out our membership forms, pay for the intended class program – cash, check and credit cards are all accepted – and fit you with the correct size keiko-gi (practice uniform). You can begin your practice the same day! If you are ready to join now, signing up is easy: please take advantage of our 2-for-1 offer today!\n\nMonthly Dues\n\nThe Midwest Aikido Center is a dues-based membership organization; there are no contracts. Monthly membership dues are $100. Discounts are available for students and couples/families. Additionally, after a member’s first rank promotion, there is also a $50 once-a-year fee to our national federation, the United States Aikido Federation, which applies only after a member’s first rank promotion.\n\nWe as members are the dojo. Our dues keep the doors open, lights on, and everything else that allows the MAC to offer multiple classes each month. Your dues allow you to practice in any class (except Iaido classes – those interested must see Robert Kolada Sensei). Please attend as many as you wish each month. More practice, more progress!\n\nIf you would like to support the dojo in the promotion of aikido, please consider a donation (see below)."
