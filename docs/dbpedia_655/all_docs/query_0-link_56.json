        "text": "Eligibility for Shihan requires holding the rank of 6th dan for a minimum of 6 years. Shihan is an appointment designated by Aikikai World Headquarters at the recommendation of Yamada Sensei, and is reviewed once a year as part of the kagami biraki (new year's promotion) process. Receiving Shihan certification is not automatic as there are several other factors taken into consideration.\n\n​\n\nShihan can test USAF members through 3rd dan. 4th dan testing must be administered by Shihan of the Technical Committee. No additional power or authority accompanies the title of Shihan, rather it shows ones qualifications as an Aikido instructor of the highest level.\n\n​\n\nShihan certification is organization-specific and cannot to be transferred outside of the USAF; therefore, only USAF Shihan are posted.\n\nShidoin is certification granted to an instructor who has had yondan for at least 1 year, and is a regularly scheduled instructor at the dojo. It is usually given only to the Chief Instructor, and the appointment of more then one shidoin in a dojo will be reviewed as to its necessity. A Shidoin may test up to and including 1st kyu alone. In order to test a student for shodan and nidan rank, there must be at least 2 Shidoin on the testing committee. Sandan and above must test in front of a Shihan. SHIDOIN CERTIFICATION IS DOJO-SPECIFIC AND IS DETERMINED BY THE CHIEF INSTRUCTOR OF A DOJO. THE CERTIFICATION DOES NOT TRAVEL WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IF THEY RELOCATE TO A NEW DOJO.\n\n​\n\nIn order to apply for Shidoin, the applicant must be recommended by either a Shidoin or Shihan. The purpose of this title is to grant the Chief Instructor of a dojo the ability to test his or her own students and therefore to promote growth within the dojo. It is not a reward, given solely on the basis of rank, and will not be granted for that purpose. This teaching certification will be awarded only on an as needed basis. The status of all applying and renewing shidoin is subject to review by the Technical Committee.\n\n​\n\nIn order to maintain certification, Shidoin must attend one major seminar each year and attend the class for instructors that may be offered at that seminar. In addition, they must attend a second seminar taught by a member of the Technical Committee in the same calendar year as well as be an active USAF member in good standing of a USAF dojo in good standing.\n\nFukushidoin is an assistant teacher certification granted to those who have been a nidan for at least 1 year. The applicant must teach class on a regularly scheduled basis. They may test kyu ranks up to and including 1st Kyu. FUKUSHIDOIN CERTIFICATION IS DOJO-SPECIFIC AND IS DETERMINED BY THE CHIEF INSTRUCTOR OF A DOJO. THE CERTIFICATION DOES NOT TRAVEL WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IF THEY RELOCATE TO A NEW DOJO.\n\nIn order to apply for Fukushidoin, the applicant must be recommended by either a Fukushidoin, Shidoin or Shihan. The purpose of this title is to grant the Chief Instructor of a dojo the ability to test his or her own students and therefore to promote growth within the dojo. It is not a reward, given solely on the basis of rank, and will not be granted for that purpose. This teaching certification will be awarded only on an as needed basis. The status of all applying and renewing Fukushidoin is subject to review by the Technical Committee.\n\nIn order to maintain certification, Fukushidoin must attend one major seminar each year and attend the class for instructors that may be offered at that seminar.
