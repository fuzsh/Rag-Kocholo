        "text": "Serge Beucher Pages on Watershed. Interesting pages, to my opinion a bit too dedicated to the work done at the CMM.\n\nHenk Heijmans home page. Some papers are available on line. This site is the home page of the Morphology Digest, a newsletter dedicated to Mathematical Morphology.\n\n\"Ligue Ile de France d'Aikido\". You will find here a wonderful site dedicated to the practice of aikido around Paris, France. In particular, you will find the dojo addresses. Ho, be careful, I may be a bit partial to this site, as I am its webmaster ;-)\n\nAikisearch. You are looking for a dojo somewhere in the world. This page is for you."
