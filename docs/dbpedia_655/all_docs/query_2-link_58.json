She has received a richness of Aikido instruction since 1968 when she started accompanying her father to the Illinois Aikido Club. First and foremost she has been a student of Norio Mamura Sensei, her father. Some of the other instructors who have had an influence on Belter Sensei include Clyde Takeguchi, Shihan , Yoshihiko Hirata Sensei and Isao Takahashi Sensei. For 30 years, the Milwaukee Aikido Club Inc. was affiliated with Akira Tohei, Shihan, Midwest Aikido Federation (USAF). At the turn of the millennium the MAC became member of Aikido Schools of Ueshiba with Mitsugi Saotome, Shihan and Hiroshi Ikeda, Shihan.\n\n“We have had a close relationship with Takehara Sensei and Yuki Hara Sensei since the 1960’s. In the early years we would travel to your dojo with my father, Mamura Sensei, and for the past 12 years Takehara Sensei has been a regular instructor and friend to our dojo. It is an honor for us to be able to teach and practice with you and we look forward to continued learning together.”"
