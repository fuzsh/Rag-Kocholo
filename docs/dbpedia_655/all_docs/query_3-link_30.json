        "text": "Morihei Ueshiba O-Sensei\n\nMorihei Ueshiba, now called O-Sensei (Great Teacher), founded the martial art known today as Aikido. Born in 1883 in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, he dedicated himself to becoming strong after seeing his father assaulted by political opponents. He sought out and studied under various masters of many traditional martial arts, eventually becoming expert at a number of styles of jujitsu (unarmed combat), kenjutsu (sword fighting), and sojitsu (spear fighting). Dissatisfied with mere strength and technical mastery, he also immersed himself in religious and philosophical studies. The stories of his immense physical strength and martial prowess are impressive enough, but more important is the legacy of nonviolence and human integrity he left to mankind. In early 20th century Japan, involvement in the martial arts was a competitive and dangerous business. Contests, feuds and rivalries often resulted in injuries and even deaths. The formulation of Aikido dates from an incident that occurred in 1925. During a discussion about martial arts, a disagreement arose between O-Sensei and a naval officer who was a fencing instructor. The officer challenged O-Sensei to a match, and attacked with a wooden sword. O-Sensei faced the officer unarmed, and won the match by evading blows until his attacker dropped from exhaustion.\n\nHe later recalled that he could see the opponent’s moves before they were executed, and that was the beginning of his enlightenment. He had defeated an armed attacker without hurting him—without even touching him. O-Sensei later wrote: “Budo (the Martial Way) is not felling the opponent by our force; nor is it a tool to lead the world into destruction with arms. True Budo is to accept the spirit of the universe, keep the peace of the world, correctly produce, protect and cultivate all things in nature”. O-Sensei continued to practice and teach Aikido into his old age. Observers would marvel at his martial abilities, vitality and good humor; he was still giving public demonstrations of Aikido at age 86, four months before his death. After he passed away on April 26, 1969, the Japanese government posthumously declared Morihei Ueshiba a Sacred National Treasure of Japan.\n\nRob Crowell Sensei\n\nRob Crowell began his martial art training in 1973 with Tae Kwon Do. In 1985, Rob began his Aikido training. In 1986, he joined the United States Aikido Federation. Rob's early Aikido career was heavily influenced by Akira Tohei Shihan. Rob was kenshusei (dedicated student) under Tohei Sensei and served as otomo to Tohei Sensei at major seminars and summer camps during the last nine years of Sensei's life.\n\nRob has trained under many different Shihan and traveled to Japan twice as part of his training. Rob continues his training by traveling to seminars with Shihan and senior instructors and is dedicated to developing the Aikido training of his students in Knoxville.\n\nRob holds the rank of 6th degree black belt awarded by the Aikikai World Headquarters (Hombu Dojo) and the position of Shidoin (certified instructor) granted by the United States Aikido Federation. Rob teaches all of the classes at the Knoxville Aikido Center unless prevented by illness or travel."
