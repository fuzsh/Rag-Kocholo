Although many of these legendary teachers are no longer with us, you can now experience their dynamic instruction in person, thanks to the video archives of Dan Palmer Sensei (Asheville Aikikai). Please join us and take advantage of this rare opportunity to experience Aikido history as taught at the Aikido Center of Atlanta!"
