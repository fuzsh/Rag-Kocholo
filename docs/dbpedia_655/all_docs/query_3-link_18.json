        "text": "The Midwest Aikido Center (MAC) was established in 1975 under Illinois state law as a not-for-profit educational corporation for the dissemination of Aikido technique and philosophy.\n\nThe MAC’s Chief Instructor since its inception was Akira Tohei, 8th dan. Tohei Sensei was the senior Aikido instructor in the U.S. until his passing in 1999. His most senior students continue Tohei Shihan’s legacy daily at the Midwest Aikido Center.\n\nThe MAC is a member of the United States Aikido Federation and maintained a very close relationship with Yamada Shihan, Hombu Shihan, and numerous USAF Shihan and Shidoin.\n\nThe MAC has a very robust history and has created many unique training experiences for Aikidoists from around the world."
