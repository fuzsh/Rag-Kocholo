        "text": "Sensei Michel Hovan\n\nI started Aikido in 1981 in Paris, France, where I studied the art until 1983. I then lived in Winnipeg for two years and was frustrated because there was no Aikido. I then moved to Minneapolis, MN and restarted my practice at the Twin Cities Aikido Center. My Kyu ranks were obtained under Akira Tohei Shihan (Chicago). In 1993 my job relocated me to Southern New Jersey. in 1995, I had the blessing of meeting Donovan Waite Shihan at a seminar in Philadelphia. When Waite Shihan moved to Philadelphia in 1997 and opened Aikido of Center City, my wife and I became his students and started training several hours and several times a week. My Dan ranks were obtained under Yamada Shihan. I was designated as a FukuShidoin in 2011. In 2006, my job moved me to New Hampshire where I am trying to pass on all the teachings that have been given to me over the years.\n\nA few years ago, I started practicing Brazilan Jiu Jutsu. In many ways I find it very similar and complementary to Aikido. I also enjoy other arts such as wrestling, Judo, Kung Fu, etc.\n\nIn case you like water, I am also a scuba instructor who loves to take people out.\n\nOther Instructors:\n\nLinda Hovan – Weapons\n\nAstros Quitayen – Mixed Levels Classes"
