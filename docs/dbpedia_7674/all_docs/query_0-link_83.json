        "text": "No one ever said of Mike Wallace, who died on Sunday at the age of ninety-three, what we folks in print have been known to say of television reporters who rely on producers: He’s superficial. He was the opposite of that. Radio and television had produced Edward R. Murrow and many outstanding journalists, but Wallace pioneered investigative reporting on television as a form and art. He helped inject “60 Minutes” with personality, gave viewers a sense that journalists like Wallace were their champions, helped elevate 7 P.M. E.T. Sundays to an hour of appointment television. Along the way, he covered subjects from Watergate to clinical depression, interviewing Ayatollah Khomeini and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ayn Rand; Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy; Jack Kevorkian and Roger Clemens.\n\nThose thoughts rush to mind when thinking of Mike Wallace, but so does a personal memory. For a number of years, Mike and I served together as national judges of the annual Livingston Journalism Awards for reporters under the age of thirty-five. I was dazzled each year how he dug into the hundred or so entries with the same energy he displayed chewing on the leg of a government or insurance company executive. The Livingston Awards are administered at Wallace’s alma mater, the University of Michigan, where a building endowed by him—the Wallace House—offers Wallace fellowship each year to journalists who aspire to be as good as he was."
