        "text": "Chris Wallace is an anchor for CNN. He hosts Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace? with new episodes available weekly on Max and The Chris Wallace Show with new episodes airing Saturdays at 10am ET on CNN and also on CNN Max. Praised as an “equal opportunity inquisitor” by The Boston Globe and “an aggressive journalist,” “sharp edged” and “solid” by The Washington Post, Wallace interviews CEOs and media moguls, Hollywood legends and newsmakers across politics, business, world affairs, sports and culture.\n\nIn January 2022, Wallace joined CNN after more than 50 award-winning years in broadcasting, including 18 years with FOX News where he was the anchor of FOX News Sunday. Throughout his almost two decades at FOX, Wallace participated in coverage of every major political event, secured numerous high-profile interviews with dignitaries as well as U.S and foreign leaders, covered five presidential elections, and interviewed every president since George H.W. Bush. Wallace was chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates to moderate the first presidential debate of the 2020 election season. In 2016, Wallace became the first journalist from FOX to moderate a general election presidential debate, and in August 2015, Wallace co-moderated the first GOP presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle along with the network’s second and third debates.\n\nWallace has won every major broadcast news award for his reporting, including three Emmy Awards, the DuPont-Columbia Silver Baton, the Peabody Award and the Sol Taishoff Award for Broadcast Journalism, which was awarded to him by the National Press Foundation. In 2021, he received the Panetta Institute’s 2021 Jefferson-Lincoln Award and in 2020, he was honored with the Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism and was named #1 on Mediaite’s Most Influential in News Media for his “clear-eyed reporting, analysis and commentary throughout the year.” Wallace also received the ICFJ Founders Award for Excellence in Journalism for “his unbiased, piercing approach to interviews.” In 2013, Wallace earned the Paul White Award for lifetime achievement and service to electronic journalism from the Radio Television Digital News Association.\n\nWallace is also the New York Times bestselling author of Countdown bin Laden: The Untold Story of the 247-Day Hunt to Bring the Mastermind of 9/11 to Justice and Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days That Changed the World. He will continue the series with the forthcoming COUNTDOWN 1960: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of the 312 Days that Changed America’s Politics Forever, which will be published on October 8, 2024.\n\nBefore joining FOX, Wallace worked at ABC News for 14 years where he served as the chief correspondent for PrimeTime and a substitute host for Nightline. Prior to ABC, Wallace was NBC’s chief White House correspondent and moderated Meet the Press, making him the only person to have hosted two Sunday talk shows. He also anchored the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News. A graduate of Harvard University, Wallace began his career as a city hall reporter for The Boston Globe."
