I say this from my heart: I love this kid, I love the way he works, I love the way he competes. I texted him last night basically and told him the same thing.\n\nI said, \"You know, I know this wasn't exactly how we planned it out.\" But I love him as a person, a competitor, a football player and Iâ€™m disappointed that it didn't pan out the way I envisioned it and that really and honestly, he's always going to be one of my kind of guys. I like this kid."
