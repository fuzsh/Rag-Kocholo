        "text": "As the self-described “black hat” of television’s premier newsmagazine “60 Minutes,” Mike Wallace crafted a persona of a probing reporter known for his often caustic questioning of sometimes reluctant guests on the program.\n\nBeginning in 1968, as one of the first hosts of the enduringly popular news show, he circled the globe, displaying his charm and wit and asking sometimes barbed, always penetrating questions of kings and presidents, business magnates and bureaucrats, entertainers and cultural personalities.\n\nWallace, who had triple bypass heart surgery in early 2008, died Saturday at a care facility in New Canaan, Conn., the CBS network announced. He was 93.\n\nOf the roughly 800 pieces the pioneering correspondent did for “60 Minutes,” two stood out the most for him, Wallace told The Associated Press in 2006.\n\nOne showed his tender side as Wallace persuaded piano virtuoso Vladimir Horowitz to pound out “Stars and Stripes Forever” in 1977. The other, in 1979, showed Wallace’s tough side as he became the first Western reporter to interview Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 53 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran. To Khomeini’s face, Wallace quoted Egyptian President Anwar Sadat as calling him a lunatic.\n\n“I figured what was he going to do, take me as a hostage?” Wallace said. “The translator looked at me as if I were a lunatic.”\n\nWhen he interviewed Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan in 2000, Wallace set an incendiary tone: “You don’t trust the media; you’ve said so. You don’t trust whites; you’ve said so. You don’t trust Jews; you’ve said so. Well, here I am.”\n\n“So what?” Farrakhan replied.\n\nFour scariest words\n\nWallace so specialized in the hard-hitting search for skullduggery that beer magnate Joseph Coors once quipped: “The four most frightening words in the English language are ‘Mike Wallace is here.’ “\n\nThe comment was adapted into a “60 Minutes” ad, and Wallace displayed a framed copy.\n\nBarbara Walters, a formidable interviewer and a competitor at ABC, offered a telling compliment on the 1997 special “Mike Wallace Remembers”: “The best interviewer in all of television — past, present and probably future — is Mike Wallace.”\n\nThe veteran broadcaster stepped down as a full-time correspondent in 2006, when he was 88. He made occasional appearances after that, culminating with his final interview in January 2008, with baseball pitcher Roger Clemens.\n\n“60 Minutes” creator Don Hewitt, who died in 2009, told People magazine in 2006: “If they were allowed to put plaques up at CBS for the three journalists who would stand out, they would be Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace.”\n\nJeff Fager, the show’s executive producer, told the Los Angeles Times in 2006, “I don’t think there would be a ’60 Minutes’ if Don hadn’t found Mike. Mike was never afraid to say what he thought.”\n\nWallace’s unapologetic style made for splashy, often emotional interviews — and the occasional dust-up.\n\nThe controversy that most affected Wallace grew out of a 1982 “CBS Reports” documentary he narrated on the Vietnam War. The report stated that Gen. William Westmoreland had inflated enemy casualty figures to maintain support for the unpopular war. Westmoreland sued CBS and Wallace for $120 million but dropped the lawsuit months into the trial.\n\n“The Westmoreland affair, professionally and personally, was one of the most difficult times of my life,” Wallace told the Chicago Tribune in 1989. “It was just devastatingly difficult because my integrity was put to question, and as a reporter, that’s the single most important thing you’ve got.”\n\nThe 1984 trial triggered Wallace’s first bout of clinical depression, and he tried to kill himself by swallowing sleeping pills. He publicly acknowledged the suicide attempt during a “60 Minutes” tribute to him in 2006.\n\nWith the support of Mary Yates, a longtime friend who would become his fourth wife, Wallace got the help he needed to treat his depression. He began seeing a psychiatrist and taking antidepressants, Wallace wrote in his 2005 memoir “Between You and Me.”\n\nIn 1995, Wallace sparred with CBS executives over the network’s initial refusal to air his report on tobacco whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand. The episode became the subject of the 1999 film “The Insider,” which alleged that CBS News delayed airing the report because it feared a debilitating lawsuit.\n\nSon of immigrant grocer\n\nBorn Myron Leon Wallace on May 9, 1918, in Brookline, Mass., he was the son of Russian Jewish immigrants Frank and Zina Wallace. His father ran a wholesale grocery business.\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Wallace wandered into the school’s broadcast center and found his metier. After graduating in 1939, Wallace got jobs in radio in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Detroit and was a communications officer in the Navy for three years during World War II.\n\nAt Chicago’s WGN radio in the 1940s, he got his first opportunity to do one-on-one interviews, the format that was to be his life’s work and earn him 21 Emmys, five DuPont-Columbia journalism awards and five Peabody Awards.\n\nHe married college sweetheart Norma Kaphan, and they had two sons, Peter and Christopher. After divorcing in 1948, he wed Buff Cobb, an actress he met while interviewing her on WGN.\n\nThe couple moved to New York and CBS, where they had an early 1950s radio and television talk show, “Mike and Buff.” The marriage ended in 1955.\n\nHis next marriage, to artist Lorraine Perigord, lasted 28 years.\n\nIn 1986, he wed Yates, the widow of his longtime producer Ted Yates, who was killed in 1967 covering the war in the Middle East. She survives him.\n\nWallace started doing commercials in the mid-1950s, which later caused news executives to question his credibility as an objective reporter.\n\nFinding his niche\n\nIn 1955, he landed a TV news anchor job in New York. The next year, Wallace faced his first guest, New York Mayor Robert Wagner, on the pioneering interview show “Night Beat.”\n\nCritics started calling him “Mike Malice.”\n\nIn its second year, the show aired weekly as “The Mike Wallace Interview” on ABC.\n\nWallace faced his first libel suit in 1957 on the ABC program when his guest, mobster Mickey Cohen, “filled the air with an outburst of vicious slander” against then-Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker, Wallace wrote in his memoir. Parker settled his $2 million lawsuit for $45,000.\n\nAfter that, Lloyd’s of London agreed to insure the show only if a lawyer sat across from Wallace during interviews holding cue cards printed “be careful,” “stop” or “retreat.”\n\nWallace left the ABC network in 1958 and returned to local television in New York and a weekday interview show.\n\nThe death of his 19-year-old son, Peter, in a hiking accident in 1962 made Wallace devote himself to serious journalism.\n\nPeter had hoped to pursue a news career. Wallace’s younger son, Chris, also went into broadcast journalism and is the host of “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nSharp moments on television\n\nSome of the many memorable moments in Mike Wallace’s career at “60 Minutes”:\n\n• Asking Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979 his reaction to being called “a lunatic” by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.\n\n• Challenging Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005: “This isn’t a real democracy, come on!”\n\n• When late-night TV host Johnny Carson expressed sympathy for a newsmaker who was an alcoholic, Wallace asked: “It takes one to know one?”\n\n• Airing a videotape in 1998 showing assisted-suicide advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian injecting a terminally ill patient with lethal drugs.\n\n• Becoming the subject of a movie, “The Insider,” after CBS cut an interview with tobacco company whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand from a 1995 story for fear of being sued. Months later, Wigand’s interview was aired.\n\n• Being sued by Vietnam-era Gen. William Westmoreland for libel after a 1982 documentary that alleged the general misled the American people. The lawsuit was withdrawn but plunged Wallace into depression.\n\n• Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad turned the tables on Wallace in a 2006 interview. “I hear this is your last interview,” the president said. Replied Wallace: “What do you think? Is it a good idea to retire?”\n\n• Questions Barbra Streisand’s many years of psychoanalysis: “What is she trying to find out that takes 20 years?”\n\n• Almost anytime Wallace prefaced a query with, “Forgive me, but …,” that’s when you knew to expect a sharp shot to the gut.\n\nOther Deaths\n\nRoger Furst, 78, who co-founded the Eastern Mountain Sports retail chain, died March 16 in Sherman, Texas, said his son Jason.\n\nFurst was a young lawyer in Denver in the early 1960s when he met Alan McDonough, a local hotel manager, and the two began hiking and fishing in the Rockies.\n\n“We got tired of walking two to five miles back to our car in the dark,” Furst told Backpacker magazine in 1974. “We started carrying our camp on our backs so we could sleep over and cook our fish right away.”\n\nBut the bulkiness of the equipment prompted Furst and McDonough to begin searching for manufacturers of lightweight camping gear. Realizing that there was a growing market for such equipment, they decided to shift careers and open their first store — the Mountain Shop in Wellesley, Mass. Renamed Eastern Mountain Sports, it was soon the largest outdoor equipment outlet in New England. The partners also opened the EMS Climbing School in North Conway, N.H., now the oldest rock-climbing school in the Eastern United States.\n\nWhen Furst and McDonough sold Eastern Mountain in 1979, it had 19 stores. It now has 66 stores in 13 states.\n\nFang Lizhi, 76, one of China’s best-known dissidents whose speeches inspired student protesters throughout the 1980s, died Friday in Tucson.\n\nAfter China’s 1989 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, Fang and his wife hid in the U.S. Embassy for 13 months after the crackdown. Once China’s leading astrophysicist, he became a physics professor at the University of Arizona.\n\nDenver Post wire services"
