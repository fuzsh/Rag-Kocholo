        "text": "Dr. Mike Wallace, senior faculty/instructional consultant at CELT, is a catalyst for helping the UK teaching community enhance learning and teaching within their courses across a wide range of modalities. His STEM background and curiosity around innovation and problem solving has served him well in transforming courses into hands-on, minds-on, collaborative learning experiences. As an assistant professor at Morehead State University, he transformed a lecture-lab physical science course for future elementary teachers into an inquiry-based learning experience designed around the Kentucky State K-8 Science standards as part of UK’s NSF Appalachian Science and Math Project grant. At the University of Texas - Austin, he worked with faculty from the sciences, humanities, and health sciences to infuse large-enrollment courses with opportunities to practice and collaborate during class. At the University of Kentucky, his focus has turned towards making sustainable yet impactful teaching changes that have been demonstrated to increase the learning success for all students, especially underrepresented groups, and across instructional modalities. He enjoys working within collaborative projects including the High Performance Brain Training, NSF GeoPaths SUCCESS, First Year Engineering, Scholarship of Teaching & Learning projects, and teaching within the Graduate School’s Preparing Future Faculty program.\n\nPhD Science Education, University of Missouri\n\nCELTic since 2018"
