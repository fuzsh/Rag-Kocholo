        "text": "Chris Wallace has a few words to say about the late Mike Wallace, his father and fellow TV broadcaster.\n\nThe younger Wallace, who anchors Fox News Sunday, issued a statement Monday, two days after the legendary CBS correspondent passed away at the age of 93.\n\n“My dad was everything you saw on television: fascinating and funny, challenging and exasperating. He was the best reporter I have ever known,” said Wallace, via the L.A. Times. “And while work often came first for him, over the last 20 years, he worked hard to make connections with his family. He became my best friend. And at the end, he was surrounded by children, grandchildren and even great-grandchildren. I already miss him terribly.”\n\nVIDEO: 5 Memorable Mike Wallace Interviews\n\nThe 64-year-old Wallace was a baby when his parents divorced in 1948, and did not forge a connection with his famous dad until he was a teenager, after his older brother died. He has worked at Fox for the past nine years following past gigs at NBC and ABC’s news divisions."
