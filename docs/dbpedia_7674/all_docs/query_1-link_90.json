        "text": "The Miami Dolphins reached an agreement with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Mike Wallace on a five-year deal worth $60 million, with $30 million guaranteed, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because Wallace was undergoing a physical and had yet to sign the deal Tuesday night.\n\nThe Dolphins later confirmed the Wallace signing in a tweet Tuesday night.\n\nEven before the three-day negotiating period, it was clear Wallace was on the Dolphins' radar. Then, as USA TODAY Sports reported on Sunday, the Dolphins spent the weekend talking to Wallace's agent.\n\nWallace had 1,193 receiving yards and eight touchdowns in 2011 and was selected to his first Pro Bowl, but his numbers fell last season, when he caught 64 passes for 836 yards and was plagued by drops. Still, Wallace led the Steelers in receiving touchdowns the past two seasons -- with eight each year -- after tying for the team lead with 10 in his rookie season.\n\nFactors in Wallace's drop in production could have been a change in offensive coordinators after the 2011 season. The Steelers got rid of Bruce Arians -- who became the offensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts and then the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals -- and hired former Chiefs coach Todd Haley. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger seemed uncomfortable in Haley's offense.\n\nWallace also suffered because of a preseason holdout.\n\nThe Steelers drafted Wallace in the third round (84th overall) in 2009 out of Mississippi.\n\nAlong with Wallace, the Dolphins landed another big-name free agent on the first day, agreeing to a five-year, $35 million deal with linebacker Dannell Ellerbe. To make room, the Dolphins released linebacker Karlos Dansby.\n\n***\n\nFollow Mike Garafolo on Twitter @mikegarafolo"
