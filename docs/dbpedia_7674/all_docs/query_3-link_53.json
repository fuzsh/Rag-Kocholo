        "text": "Even his own CBS network called him a âpit-bull reporterâ in the first sentence of its tribute to the late, inimitable Mike Wallace, who died on April 7, 2012, after a lengthy illness.\n\nHis tenacity, which came to full fruition on â60 Minutes,â is revisited in the new and acclaimed documentary film âMike Wallace Is Here,â currently playing at the Dallas Angelika Film Center.\n\nI interviewed Wallace several times during his long career. But my most vivid recollection of him is as a father who talked openly of reconnecting with his likewise famous son, Chris Wallace.\n\nThe two of them had never appeared on television together until Nov. 6, 2005, when Chris, 58 at the time, welcomed Mike, 87, to his âFox News Sundayâ program. A bit of business was at hand. Mike would be talking up what turned out to be his last book, Between You and Me. It was a compilation of a half-century of TV interviews with personages ranging from Eleanor Roosevelt to Martin Luther King Jr. to Johnny Carson to Barbra Streisand.\n\nIn separate interviews with your correspondent, both Wallaces were strikingly candid about their estrangement and eventual reconciliation.\n\nDuring his vintage years as the host of âNight Beatâ and âThe Mike Wallace Interview,â he had little time for his second son, Chris, who was born the year before the marriage of his father and the then Norma Kaplan ended in a 1948 divorce. She soon married CBS News president Bill Leonard, to whom Chris felt far closer in his formative years.\n\nUntil he turned 15, âIâd not had much of a relationship at all with my father,â Chris said.\n\nHis dad agreed.\n\nâI hoped that he would follow in my footsteps,â Mike said of Chris. âBut his stepdad had more to do with teaching Chris than I did. They had a wonderful life growing up. They told me they used to do sports play-by-play when they drove into New York City along the Hudson River together. They loved each other.â\n\nThe 1962 death of Peter Wallace â Chrisâ older brother and Mikeâs only other son â had a profound effect on both survivors.\n\nâHe fell off a mountain in Greece at the age of 19,â Mike remembered matter-of-factly. âI was much closer to him in those years than I was to Chris.â\n\nMike then had an epiphany. Heâd been taking just about anything that came along, including game shows and commercials for Golden Fluffo Shortening. After Peterâs death, he steeled himself.\n\nâI decided I was going to do something that would make Peter proud,â Mike said. âI said to hell with all this other stuff. I was going to find out if I could do it the way I wanted to, which was to do news and nothing but.â\n\nHe also re-connected with Chris.\n\nâWe both felt an interest in this other person in our lives that we didnât know much about,â Chris said. âOne thing he did know was that I was a huge sports fan, so he started taking me to Toots Shorâs restaurant in New York, where I could see Frank Gifford and people like that. I wasnât excited about seeing my dad, but I was very excited about seeing sports stars. That was sort of the way we made our way back to each other.â\n\nMike would soon also make his way to â60 Minutes,â where his blunt-spoken interview style stood out like a cactus amid orchids. His storied tenure lasted from 1968 until 2008, when his final interview was with accused steroids user Roger Clemens.\n\nWhat was his secret? âWhat I try to do, honestly, is to read everything thatâs been written about or by the person Iâm talking to,â Mike said. âWe have no subpoena powers, obviously. We have to persuade them that weâll be fair. When it becomes apparent that youâve done a lot of homework and you know a lot about them, they respect it and they become, in effect, co-conspirators. The chemistry of confidentiality develops in that way. But where else my interviewing skills come from, I donât have a clue. Maybe itâs just because Iâve been doing it for such a long time.â\n\nI saw him for the last time in fall 2005, just before he went onstage at Highland Park Methodist Church to talk about his new book and his many adventures within its covers. He insisted on signing a copy and wrote a warm, personal inscription as well before his presentation began.\n\nBut weâll close with his words about son, Chris. Because theyâre the ones that many dads never get around to saying.\n\nâI gotta tell you, itâs a joy to watch him. Heâs so damned good,â the once estranged father said of his son. âWe love each other a lot. Heâs a good fella.â\n\nEd Bark, who runs the TV website unclebarky.com, is a past member of the national Peabody awards board."
