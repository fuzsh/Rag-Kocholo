So, we created the Pathway to Homeownership initiative to alleviate some of your financial worries.\n\nWhat is the Pathway to\n\nHomeownership Initiative?\n\nThe Pathway to Homeownership offers qualified borrowers in select areas up to $8,000 in assistance. These funds are not a loan that needs to be repaid and are available to first-time homebuyers in designated areas.\n\nThis program can also potentially be combined with other down payment assistance programs to offer you even more support as you build the life of your dreams."
