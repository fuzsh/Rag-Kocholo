        "text": "There are few greater joys in an NFL reporter's long Sunday at the stadium than when an interviewee starts dropping third-person references in his postgame media session, and Dolphins wide receiver Mike Wallace is in midseason form when it comes to an art perfected by Rickey Henderson.\n\n“Here’s the thing about Mike,” Wallace told reporters in the aftermath of Miami's 33-20 victory against the Patriots. “Mike don’t ever fear nobody, ever in life, period. Don’t matter who it is.”\n\nWallace had reason to be confident after torching New England's Darrelle Revis for much of his seven catches for 81 yards and a touchdown, especially since he tweaked his hamstring early in the game and said, \"I kinda was on half a leg.\" Meanwhile, Revis left the game late with a cramp in his left leg, but by then Wallace and the Dolphins were well on their way to scoring 23 unanswered second-half points.\n\n\"He's a great player,\" added Wallace, \"but Mike don't care about none of that.\"\n\nUpon dropping that third \"Mike\" in as many sentences, Wallace let everyone know he was in on the joke. \"I'm speaking in third person,\" he finished with a laugh. After a somewhat disappointing season his first year in Miami, catching a career-low five touchdown passes for a .500 Fins squad in 2013, Mike Wallace has a reason to be happy about Mike Wallace's performance on Sunday."
