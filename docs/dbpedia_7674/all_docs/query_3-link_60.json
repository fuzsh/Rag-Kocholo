        "text": "Michael “Mike” John Wallace was a true and proud West Seattleite until his final day on February 26, 2023. He passed unexpectedly at the age of 65 in West Seattle, Washington.\n\nMike was a loving and devoted husband, father, and grandfather who is survived by his bride, Shari Lynn who he cherished as “the luckiest girl in the world.” He was a proud father of Christopher (Taryn) Wallace and Michelle (Alden) McCormick. He was the most vibrant Grandpa to his five grandchildren: Scarlett, Junior, Aidan, Evelynn, Sloane and excited for Michelle & Alden’s newest addition due this October. They will forever remember making noise and trouble with Grandpa Mike.\n\nMike is preceded in death by his sister, Kathi Norberg, and his parents, Hugh & Betty Wallace who raised him and his seven brothers and sisters in a loving home along 35th Avenue full of childhood memories. Mike is also survived by his siblings; Pat (Sheri) Wallace, Barbara Roumonada, Patty Valentine, Linda Byrne, Sue Ericson and Terry Wallace.\n\nMike made a notable and memorable impact during his 45 years at Avis where he built a career that he treasured. He never started a day without a cup of Starbucks coffee. He was always donned in his Avis swag, cruising the lots in his red Nike Air Forces. Mike was a magnet who brought people together through music and laughter. On the weekends, he took to the stage drumming with his band, The VanHolt’s. When he didn’t have a gig, he and Shari would spend their time at their property and “happy place” in Desert Aire. If you knew Mike, you fell victim to his famous pop-bys, random calls and saw a brief appearance at every event, but he made sure it never lasted too long as he would leave with a classic Irish Goodbye.\n\nMichael John Wallace’s contagious smile, drum solos, and unforgettable charismatic spirit will be missed and remembered by all.\n\nA celebration of life will be held on Saturday, April 1st, 2023 from 2-5pm at the Seattle Lutheran High School Gymnasium. All who want to share in Mike’s memory are welcome to attend.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to be made to a local Hope School students fundraiser that benefits Music4Life, a non profit dedicated to getting musical instruments into the hands of kids. Follow this link to donate to Dominic’s GoFundMe page.\n\nTo share your condolences and memories of Mike, please visit his Tribute Wall, located above.\n\n- Care Entrusted to Emmick Family Funeral Home -"
