        "text": "By Jacob Sturm\n\nMustang Times\n\nMUSTANG – With the imminent retirement of Mustang Police Chief Rob Groseclose, Mustang has been in search of the person poised to take over in the role.\n\nDuring April’s Mustang City Council meeting, it was announced that the city had found their man for the job in longtime resident and officer Mike Wallace.\n\n“I’m honored and very excited,” Wallace said. “I’ve dedicated my entire career here at Mustang, and to work up and earn that position is humbling. Truly it means a ton to me.\n\n“It’s very rewarding to see that the work that I’ve put forth throughout my career has led me to this opportunity to lead the people that we have now. It means a lot.”\n\nWallace has served as Mustang’s deputy police chief, which has helped him prepare for the opportunity to become police chief.\n\nGroseclose’s retirement announcement came sooner than many expected, and Wallace does not plan any significant changes once he assumes his new role.\n\n“My plan is to maintain the trajectory that we’re on because I think we’re in a good position and a good place,” Wallace said. “If I could concentrate on enhancing some of the programs that we have got in place, that would be my first goal.\n\n“There’s nothing specific there. I just know that we have made a vast amount of change in the last seven years. So, all of that just needs to be continued to enhance those changes. There’s not a dramatic amount of change that is needed right now.”\n\nWallace joined the Mustang Police Department in 1999 as a reserve officer. In the role, he volunteered part-time before eventually going full-time in 2000.\n\nWallace went back to reserve status for a couple of years starting in 2006, while maintaining his police officer commission through Mustang the full time, before picking back up and being full-time at MPD ever since.\n\nHe worked in traffic accident investigations for more than 15 years while working for the MPD and has a tremendous amount of investigative experience with traffic collisions.\n\nHe commanded the investigations at MPD for four years and eventually became a liaison with the Canadian County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nWallace said the Mustang community and city employees have been extremely supportive since the announcement he would become the new police chief.\n\n“This has been my home, this has been my community since very early in life, and I feel like the people that have reached out are super supportive of this decision,” Wallace said.\n\n“It’s very humbling to know that people recognize the impact maybe that I’ve had along my career, and they seem to be supportive of this decision. That’s really an awesome feeling.”\n\nMAN OF INTEGRITY\n\nMustang Mayor Brian Grider stated his support for Wallace.\n\n“I’m incredibly excited for Mike Wallace to be our next chief,” Grider said. “I’ve known Mike for probably 20 years or so, knew him long before I was on the council or had anything to do with the city. I knew him during his first stint whenever he was an officer with the City of Mustang, and he has always been a man of integrity. He’s always been somebody that’s always been well respected within the community…\n\n“Our community loves him and supports him and respects him. He has always led so well in the different roles that he’s had. I think he’ll do a phenomenal job moving forward as our chief of police.”\n\nMPD has had multiple retirements within the department happening simultaneously with Wallace taking over as the next police chief. That means MPD will be focused on backfilling the staff and making internal promotions.\n\nThat will make Wallace a pretty busy man once his time starts. If you ask Wallace, he’ll tell you that the promotion is not just about him.\n\n“I was selected for this position because the department is in a good place, and we’re doing good things, and that’s because of the team that we have in place,” Wallace said. “We have some of the best, well-trained, professional employees that I know of, especially in the state of Oklahoma (and) the people that I know. This is a great police department with great people.\n\n“The fact that I’ve been asked to move into this role is a statement of the fact that things are good, and people are doing the right things… I couldn’t be more proud of who we have working for us. That has made the deputy chief’s role that I’ve filled so much better and so much easier. I don’t suspect it to change as we move forward. I am truly honored to work with this group of people.”\n\nSupport is also abundant from his family regarding the Mustang police chief position.\n\n“I’ve got a ton of support from my family,” Wallace said. “This community is also my family’s home, and they’ve supported me on this journey my entire career and they’re also very excited to see me take on this role.”"
