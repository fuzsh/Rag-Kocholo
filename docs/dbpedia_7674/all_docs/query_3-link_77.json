        "text": "Mike Wallace was known to use his interviewing prowess to needle bidders at the Possible Dreams auction on Martha's Vineyard to up their ante, Wiet Bacheller remembers.\n\nIt was something to the effect of, \"Oh come on, don't sit on your hands,\" Bacheller, former co-chairwoman of the auction, recalled. \"You have plenty in your pockets, get your credit card out.\"\n\n\"It was great entertainment for auctiongoers, even if they didn't bid on a thing,\" Bacheller said. \"It was great theater.\"\n\nWallace, a part-time Vineyard resident, died Saturday in Connecticut at the age of 93. He was at a care facility in New Canaan, Conn., where he had lived in recent years, CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said.\n\nWallace was one of the original correspondents for CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" His pitiless, prosecutorial style transformed television journalism and made \"60 Minutes\" compulsively watchable.\n\nHis reputation was so fearsome that it was often said that the scariest words in the English language were \"Mike Wallace is here to see you,\" The Associated Press wrote.\n\nWallace didn't just interview people. He interrogated them. He cross-examined them. Sometimes he eviscerated them. His weapons were many: thorough research, a cocked eyebrow, a skeptical \"Come on\" and a question so direct sometimes it took your breath away.\n\nHe was well aware that his reputation arrived at an interview before he did, said Jeff Fager, CBS News chairman and Wallace's longtime producer at \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"He loved it,\" Fager said Sunday. \"He loved that part of Mike Wallace. He loved being Mike Wallace. He loved the fact that if he showed up for an interview, it made people nervous. ... He knew, and he knew that everybody else knew, that he was going to get to the truth. And that's what motivated him.\"\n\n\"He was hands down the best television interviewer ever,\" said Steve Kroft, his former \"60 Minutes\" colleague.\n\n\"I can't think of anyone, besides (CBS legend Edward R.) Murrow, who had a greater influence in shaping television journalism.\"\n\nWallace's late colleague Harry Reasoner once said, \"There is one thing that Mike can do better than anybody else: With an angelic smile, he can ask a question that would get anyone else smashed in the face.\"\n\nIn 2005, he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin, and challenged him: \"This isn't a real democracy, come on!\" Putin's aides tried to halt the interview; Putin said he was the president and he would decide what to do.\n\nUntil Wallace was slowed by heart surgery as he neared his 90th birthday in 2008, he continued making news, doing \"60 Minutes\" interviews with notable and controversial figures.\n\nHe had promised to still do occasional reports when he announced his retirement as a regular correspondent in 2006.\n\nWallace, whose career spanned 60 years, said then that he had long vowed to retire \"when my toes turn up\" and \"they're just beginning to curl a trifle. ... It's become apparent to me that my eyes and ears, among other appurtenances, aren't quite what they used to be.\"\n\nAmong his later contributions, after bowing out as a regular, was a May 2007 profile of GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, and an interview with Jack Kevorkian, the assisted-suicide doctor released from prison in June 2007 and who died June 3, 2011, at age 83.\n\nIn December 2007, Wallace landed the first interview with Roger Clemens after the star pitcher was implicated in the Mitchell report on performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. The interview, in which Clemens maintained his innocence, was broadcast in early January 2008.\n\nThe Wallace family spent a lot of time during the summer at their summer home on Hatch Road in Vineyard Haven. They bought the house in 1989 for $1.45 million and sold it last October.\n\n\"It was kind of a tumbledown house,\" he told Martha's Vineyard Magazine in a 2004 interview. \"But the porch was there, the sailors' bethel, the trees, the waterfront ... Even as I talk I can see it and smell it and feel it ... when the sun slants down from behind the house in the summer and you see the ferries coming by and the boats looking golden in the sunset, and you're looking at the Sound â€” Mary and I sit there on the porch and think, 'How lucky could we be?' \"\n\nSince 1980, Wallace was involved in the Possible Dreams auction, which benefited Martha's Vineyard Community Services, sometimes auctioning himself off, Bacheller said.\n\nHe auctioned a dinner with him and his wife, Mary, in New York, a tennis match and even a trip to the \"60 Minutes\" studio. Someone paid $25,000 for the dinner in 2006.\n\n\"He has been a big factor in the success of the Possible Dreams auction,\" Bacheller, president of the Martha's Vineyard Community Services board, said.\n\nIn 2008, the auction committee honored him and a handful of other famous Vineyarders for their service and help.\n\nWallace was born Myron Wallace on May 9, 1918, in Brookline, Mass.\n\nHe began his news career in Chicago in the 1940s, first as radio news writer for the Chicago Sun and then as reporter for WMAQ. He started at CBS in 1951.\n\nHe was married four times. In 1986, he wed Mary Yates Wallace, the widow of his close friend and colleague, Ted Yates, who had died in 1967.\n\nBesides his wife, Wallace is survived by his son, Chris Wallace, a broadcast journalist who hosts \"Fox News Sunday\"; a stepdaughter, Pauline Dora; and a stepson, Eames Yates.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.\n\nKey dates and events in the career of \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Mike Wallace:\n\n1940s: Wallace begins his news career as radio news writer for the Chicago Sun.\n\n1949: Wallace appears in a show called \"Majority Rules\" using his given name, Myron Wallace.\n\n1951: Wallace begins working at CBS.\n\n1950s: \"Night Beat,\" a series of one-on-one interviews that first brought Wallace recognition for his style of questioning, begins airing on a local New York station. It later airs on ABC.\n\n1959: \"The Hate That Hate Produced,\" a highly charged program that Wallace helped create about the Nation of Islam that was later criticized as biased and inflammatory, airs.\n\n1963: Wallace becomes a full-time newsman for CBS.\n\n1968: Wallace becomes the first man hired when late CBS News producer Don Hewitt puts together staff of \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n1970: Wallace wins first Peabody award at \"60 Minutes\" and second of five overall for the show's general excellence.\n\n1977-78: \"60 Minutes\" reaches top 10 in ratings for first time, where it remains for years.\n\n1979: During the Iranian hostage crisis, Wallace asks Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini what he thought about being called \"a lunatic\" by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Khomeini answers by predicting Sadat's assassination.\n\n1982: CBS airs a documentary that accuses retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland and others of deliberately underestimating enemy troop strength during the Vietnam War. Westmoreland sues Wallace and the network for libel, seeking $120 million. He later drops the lawsuit but only after years of legal wrangling. Wallace says the case brought on depression that put him in the hospital for more than a week.\n\n1999: \"The Insider,\" a film based in part on a 1995 \"60 Minutes\" story about tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand, premieres. Christopher Plummer stars as Wallace, who was unhappy with the film, in which he was portrayed as caving to pressure to kill a story about Wigand.\n\n2006: Wallace retires as a regular correspondent for the show.\n\n2008: \"60 Minutes\" airs Wallace's last interview, with Roger Clemens on his alleged steroid use.\n\nStoried career"
