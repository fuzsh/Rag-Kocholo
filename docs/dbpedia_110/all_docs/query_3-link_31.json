If you log into your Shopify account and click Settings > Billing, can you replace the wording with a different character? For example, if \"รณ\" is listed please use \"o\" instead. After that, please try to buy the domain again. You can always change the billing address back to the original address after the domain has been processed.\n\nLet me know how this goes and if there is anything else I can help you with, I'm happy to help!\n\nMany thanks,\n\nTed | Social Care @ Shopify\n\n- Was my reply helpful?
