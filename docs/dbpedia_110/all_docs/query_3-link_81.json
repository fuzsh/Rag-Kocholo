        "text": "Whatâs New\n\nThis is a minor release that supports faster scan data download via USB and includes the installation of the necessary USB driver required for the BLK2GO and BLK ARC as of the release of firmware 3.0.0.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nBLK360 Known Issues\n\nWhen downloading scans from the BLK360, progress is being made even though the dialog says 1% for much of the download.\n\nWhen the BLK360 battery is low, download is not supported. The download button will not be clickable though no warning message is given.\n\nWhen the BLK360 battery level is low, the charge percentage number is not shown.\n\nWhen a download from the BLK Data Manager is canceled, there is an intermittent error that causes the program to hang. The workaround is to restart both the scanner and BLK Data Manager and reconnect.\n\nIf a download is unsuccessful, a user might receive a message stating âDownloaded 0 setup(s).â if you receive this message, please re-download those scans.\n\nBLK360 scans will appear chronologically in the Download Manager while BLK2GO walks will appear in alphanumeric order.\n\nThe temp folder may not contain non-ASCII characters.\n\nIf there is a synchronization issue between the tablet and the scanner (which may be caused by a poor or interfering Wi-Fi connection) items created on the tablet using FIELD 360 such as links, images, and geotags may not be synced back to the scanner. The workaround here is to download the data from the tablet using FIELD 360 rather than directly from the scanner.\n\nIn rare cases when importing using Auto Cloud, REGISTER 360 may hang. The data is imported correctly with links created, the workaround is to close REGISTER 360 and open it again.\n\nWhen in a setup view and the Panoramic images are turned off, occasionally the position of the camera changes and is inverted. Going back to SiteMap View and then into the setup again will fix the issue.\n\nWhen a download from a BLK2GO scanner is canceled the user will not be informed.\n\nVirtual target snaps below were clicked and the exported data has different coordinates to those in Cyclone REGISTER 360. The Workaround is to lock the bundle before applying control.\n\nIf a control file has a leading space (a space as the first character) then that line is ignored. The workaround is to manually delete the first line.\n\nExport Panoramic images with the location coordinates and orientation in the user coordinate system i.e. in the control coordinate system.\n\nWhen we import BLK2FLY GPS data with 'Wall Aligned UCS' option, it ignores the UTM/State Plane coordinate UCS. The workaround is to not use Wall Aligned with UTM.\n\nSave B2G file(s) function during import from BLK2GO scanner is broken. The workaround is to use the DM.\n\nRe-import image command fails when trying to import image(s) from a BLK360 scanner with a cable connection i.e. via LAN\n\nAfter importing from a BLK scanner (BLK360, BLK2GO or BLK2FLY) if there were setups that were not selected for import, there is a dialog box that states âfailed to importâ on the un-selected setups. The expected behaviour is that these setups should not be mentioned.\n\nScans that have more than one point cloud in a Setup are not properly displayed. This can be the case when a C10 has a full 360 scan and a highly detailed window scan. The scans still exist and can be exported.\n\nIf Faro scans fail to import, please contact Leica support. The scans collected from the newest Faro scanner may not import. Please contact Leica support for the newest Faro SDK. It may be the case that new software from Faro needs to be downloaded and installed separately.\n\nAfter the recommended firmware update for BLK2GO, in some cases, setups are unable to be imported over wi-fi. The workaround is to import via USB-C cable.\n\nCyclone In some cases, when publishing to TruView Cloud setups do not appear in the SiteMap. The workaround here is to publish to LGS and import the file into TruView Cloud.\n\nIn rare cases, exports to LGS and RCP show different elevations on point cloud points than in Cyclone REGISTER 360.\n\nWindows scaling works best when set to 100%. Setting to 150% or higher causes some graphical errors.\n\nSome dialog boxes cannot be rescaled correctly and OK button is not shown in the dialog box.\n\nSome panels have a dialog that does not fit correctly.\n\nSetup icons are in some cases misplaced when data is published to TruView Cloud. The workaround is to set Windows Scaling to 100% as there seems to be an issue when set to 150%.\n\nScaling of 175% and 200% collapses the left side panel and cannot resize after collapse.\n\nSome new dialogs will not have translations.\n\nSome customers have reported Cyclone REGISTER 360 crashes when using AMD Ryzen 7 processors.\n\nIn rare cases downloading scans from a BLK360 may fail. The workaround is to restart the BLK360 scanner.\n\nAfter downloading Setups from the scanner this dialog will show if the number of Setups selected is less than the total Setups on the scanner. This dialog, while correct, should be ignored.\n\nInserting Virtual Targets with BLK2GO data can have issues if the Pano is on. The workaround is to turn off the pano image and then create a virtual target.\n\nCyclone REGISTER 360 Projects located on NAS drives are NOT recommended.\n\nDue to variations between network deployments Cyclone REGISTER 360 projects may be unreliable or slow to respond when accessed from a network location.\n\nCyclone REGISTER 360 Projects located on NAS drives show <1MB in the Projects & Storage tab.\n\nRCP publish will fail if the Setup published has zero points. The workaround is to restore the points for the Setup and publish again.\n\nThe cloud used for Cloud-to-Cloud registration cannot be cleaned by the Smooth Surface feature. Therefore, the options for which cloud to clean are not available.\n\nThere is an issue with publishing data to TruView Cloud with Applied Control for projects created in Cyclone REGISTER 360 prior to 2020.0. The Setup icons to do match the SiteMap. The solution is to create another Finalized Registration, then re-publish to TruView Cloud.\n\nOnce imported into 2021.0, B2G files are changed and are not compatible with older versions of Cyclone REGISTER 360. Please make a backup copy of the B2G file BEFORE import.\n\nAfter editing an HDR tone map, other Versions created will still show the original tone map in the thumbnail but the Pano and point cloud will be correct.\n\nThe 2-billion-point limitation has been removed from publishing to RCP.\n\n30 GB of temp space is needed for every billion points exported to a single RCP cloud.\n\nUsing Export to Separate Setups does not use the same level of temp space. Temp space is not generally a problem when exporting separate Setups.\n\nVirtual Machine (VM) environments are not supported.\n\nRemote Desktop is only supported if Cyclone REGISTER 360 is opened in the remote computer first. Trying to open Cyclone REGISTER 360 through a remote desktop is not supported.\n\nCyclone REGISTER 360 will not detect the dedicated graphics card on computers with multiple graphics cards. Users must manually set the dedicated card for use with Cyclone REGISTER 360. This is done with the Nvidia Control Panel for Nvidia graphics cards, or with the Catalyst Control Centre for ATI/AMD graphic cards\n\nImporting data over a network can cause issues, especially on Windows 10. The workaround is to copy the scan data to a local disk.\n\nIf memory issues arise, check that the virtual memory size is set to the same size as RAM.\n\nAutomatic image matching of imported panoramic images may not always be correct.\n\nThe zoom scale bar will be captured in the image in the import area using the satellite or street map.\n\nProject thumbnails (the image shown in the project explorer) are not preserved in the *.raf export file.\n\nF1 contextual help will not work with Microsoft Edge browser as the default browser. The workaround is to set Chrome or Firefox as the default browser.\n\nFiles written to the temp folder at C:\\Users\\(user name)\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Register360, will be deleted after the program closes. These files will NOT be deleted if the program freezes or crashes.\n\nIn rare cases, the Bundle will show an optimized state, but there is still an unoptimized Link in the Bundle (not shown with a dotted line). Optimize the Bundle to resolve the issue or split the Bundle into smaller Bundles and look for the suspect dotted line Link, delete this Link and re-optimize.\n\nThe currently active project should not be re-named from the Projects & Storage settings. You should close the project before renaming it.\n\nWhen a Setup has a UCS created from it, the UCS must first be deleted before the Setup can be deleted from the project.\n\nOn rare occasions, HDR images may appear grey with very little variation. The workaround is to open the image with the Tone Map Editor and re-save the image.\n\nSome graphic card anomalies can be caused by power management software. Please turn off by setting the power management profile to High Performance.\n\nPaper targets should not be placed on significantly curved surfaces. The workaround is to create a virtual target rather than using the algorithm to best fit in these cases.\n\nIn some cases, if the scanner was inverted and automatically acquired targets, applying control fails. The workaround here is to manually acquire the targets.\n\nA published RCP that has applied control with very large coordinates shows a black map rather than the colour image. The workaround is to create another map in ReCap.\n\nMac OSâs running Windows Boot Camp is not officially supported\n\nCyclone REGISTER 360 supports Windows 10 on Windows-native devices only.\n\nIssue with Multiple monitors using Windows Scaling higher than 100%.\n\nIf issues are encountered using Windowâs scaling settings higher that 100%, set the monitor that Cyclone REGISTER 360 is using to the main display.\n\nWhen publishing to Jetstream Enterprise with a large number of assets:\n\nThere can be an issue when publishing to JetStream Enterprise with a large number of assets in the project. The workaround is to publish the project to LGS and then import the LGS to JetStream Enterprise.\n\nWhen publish to Cyclone ENTERPRISE fails to open the proper landing page:\n\nWhen publishing to Cyclone ENTERPRISE, you need to enter the Host Name and Port for the target server. The Host Name should only contain the top-level domain part of the URL. In some cases, a host name may be valid for the connection test but will not work for publishing. In this case, the connection dialog will display the Project Selector. To solve this problem, edit the Host Name to remove all text after the Top Level Domain. For example, \"https://mycycloneenterprise.com/abc...-////\" should be trimmed to \"https://mycycloneenterprise.com\"\n\nWhen publishing to Cyclone ENTERPRISE fails, the below error message could mean that:\n\nThe sever has low disk space\n\nThe network drive is disconnected\n\nInvalid file path\n\nImporting from Cyclone FIELD 360\n\nOnly BLK360 projects will appear when the user connects to Cyclone FIELD 360. Cyclone FIELD 360 does not store full project data for the RTC360\\P-Series and should be imported directly from the scanner's USB memory stick.\n\nCleaned vs. Uncleaned pano layer publishing\n\nWhen publishing an LGS file, the Hue and Greyscale pano layers will show the uncleaned cloud.\n\nA workaround would be to publish to E57 and then re-import the data then publish to LGS.\n\nBLK2GO E57 Support\n\nDue to the unstructured nature of BLK2GO data, E57 files created from the scanner will not be supported for import into Cyclone REGISTER 360 2021.1 or earlier. Users should save original B2G files for future use.\n\nModified usage for Japanese OS\n\nJapanese OS language preference is not selected by default and causes issues with some Cyclone REGISTER 360 imports.\n\nThe user can fix this by manually selecting the language within preferences.\n\nOn the Japanese OS machine, launch Control Panel\n\nSelect region(å°å) and click on the accept button indicated\n\nCheck \"Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support\"\n\nReboot\n\nNon-ASCII characters\n\nNon-ASCII characters are not allowed in the following conditions:\n\nImport temp path\n\nOn computers with non-Latin user names, the user will not be able to create any project if the source data is stored anywhere under the user profile name. This issue will manifest itself in Japanese, Chinese, or any other language containing special non-Latin characters in the user name.\n\nThe SiteMap name cannot have non-Latin (Japanese, Chinese, etc.) characters for publishing to TruView Enterprise or TruView Cloud.\n\nUsage file reporting issue for EnterpriseElite Customers\n\nWhen using the standalone CLM installer, some EnterpriseElite users may find that the usage file (year-month.db) normally located at C:\\Leica Geosystems\\CLM\\LogFiles does not get produced.\n\nPlease ensure your LGS.opt file (located here: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Leica Geosystems\\License-Server\\lgs.opt) looks like this:\n\nDEBUGLOG +\"C:\\Leica Geosystems\\CLM\\LogFiles\\lgs.log\"\n\nNOLOG IN\n\nTIMEOUTALL 240\n\nENABLE_DB_HISTORY 1\n\nPATH_DB_HISTORY C:\\Leica Geosystems\\CLM\\LogFiles\n\nENABLE_DB_HISTORY should be set to 1 in this file. Please copy the file to a new location, edit it and re-save if the file says itâs read-only.\n\nInstalling CLM while a JetStream Enterprise service is running\n\nDuring the installation of CLM, users may encounter the following error message. This is commonly due to a service like JetStream running in the background.\n\nTo enable the successful installation of CLM, please follow these steps:\n\nLaunch the task manager\n\nSelect the Services tab\n\nLook up the process with the PID (Process ID) shown in the Close applications dialog\n\nIn this case it is JetStream\n\nTerminate the process so that CLM can be installed\n\nAfter CLM is installed, click on the Services button in the Task Manager and restart the service\n\nRCP publish dialog progress reporting\n\nWhen publishing an RCP file, the progress will appear to stall at a certain interval. Though the progress bar does not update, the export is progressing. Users may check the task manager to ensure that the service is still functioning.\n\nBlurred images within ReCap\n\nIn some cases, E57 files published from Cyclone REGISTER 360, when imported into ReCap, may display blurred imagery when entering the Setup location sphere. This is a known issue with ReCap's handling of E57 files. RCP files published from Cyclone REGISTER 360 do not show any display issues.\n\nThe E57 export using the new Compatibility mode option (see details above in the feature description) may help with this issue.\n\nLGS usage over network\n\nThe use of LGS files is only supported when the files are saved locally. Due to variations between network deployments LGS files may be unreliable when published to a network location.\n\nHyperlinks in the Master SiteMap in the Finalize area, once created, will hide behind the inserted image, but will still export to TruView, Cyclone ENTERPRISE and LGS properly.\n\nDeprecated Features\n\nLeica Geosystems strives to provide support for the widest array of operating systems and file formats possible as is reasonable given current technologies and support from third-party partners.\n\nWith each release, we review our list of currently supported formats and operating systems in line with industry trends and announced product terminations.\n\nLeica Geosystems may add or terminate support for a file format during any release. Obsolete operating systems will be supported for six months after their announced termination or the next major software release, whichever comes first. Server products will be supported in alignment with Leicaâs Client License Manager (CLM) supported servers to guard users against incompatibility.\n\nCyclone REGISTER 360 2020:\n\nTVG files are no longer published. Users should use the LGS format. If a TVG is required, users can Publish to TruView Local and run the dataset through the free utility Leica Pack&Go.\n\nCyclone REGISTER 360 2021:\n\nWindows 7, 8 and 8.1 are no longer supported.\n\nLicensing\n\nAll users with valid CCP for either Cyclone REGISTER 360 (standard edition) or Cyclone REGISTER, or with CCP valid as late as 28 May 2022, can run this new version of Cyclone REGISTER 360 (standard edition) with no new license required.\n\nAll users with valid CCP for Cyclone REGISTER 360 (BLK Edition) or with CCP valid as late as 28 May 2022 can run this new version of Cyclone REGISTER 360 (BLK Edition) with no new license required."
