        "text": "Select - this is the default option. It is mandatory for creating main filters. The metaproperty enables users to choose from predefined values.\n\nAutocomplete - this type is a combination of an input field and a dropdown. When users start typing the name of the metaproperty option, the system will return the existing matching options in a dropdown. If no existing value is found, you can add a new one.\n\nText - allows for entering a value in a text field. You cannot filter text metaproperties, but you can search for keywords in the text. This type can be used to enter data such as barcodes or extra photographer-related information. The text value will be lost when you create a text metaproperty and change the type later.\n\nYou can also put a direct download or a regular link in the text metaproperty. When users click a direct link, the file download will start automatically. This can be helpful if the files are stored in an external system and you want to give users easy access.\n\nLongtext - similar to the Text type but with additional support for line breaks and multiple lines.\n\nSidebar - display the metaproperty property on the left-hand side of the sidebar.\n\nDate - users can use a date picker to set a date as a metaproperty option.\n\nLinked assets - enables relating assets with one another.\n\nBrand store categories - displays categories in Brand Store.\n\nButton - creates a button with the metaproperty label and the URL link. This can be useful in Workflow to help users locate the templates they should use.\n\nWorkflow job - enables linking assets to workflow jobs to track asset history better. See Link assets to workflow jobs.\n\nSelect2 - combines the properties of the Select and Autocomplete types. See Use the combined benefits of the autocomplete and the select metaproperties.\n\nMultiselect - enables the selection of multiple metaproperty options for upload and editing.\n\nMulti filter - allows users to select multiple values within one metaproperty in the smart filter. This will treat the search as an \"OR.\" Multi Filter is now managed in Smart Filter management.\n\nEditable - if you do not select this option, this metaproperty will not display in the upload screen or the Edit tab on the Asset detail page.\n\nNote\n\nUsers with the Edit non-editable metaproperties on assets can override this setting when the option Editable is disabled. This means they'll still be able to edit the metaproperty even though it's not configured as editable.\n\nFilterable - enables filtering on the metaproperty. If you do not select this option, it will not show as a filter but will still display among the main filters on the Asset detail page. This option should be selected by default.\n\nApifield - adds the metaproperty name with option name to the API output for asset operations.\n\nDisplay field - if you do not select this option, it disappears from the Info tab on the Asset detail page but remains available as a filter and in the Edit tab on the Asset detail page.\n\nIt is filling in the metaproperty when uploading or editing assets is required. An asterisk will be added to the metaproperty field to indicate that it is mandatory.\n\nMain Filter - if this option is selected, the metaproperty will be displayed among the primary filters. If not selected, the metaproperty will display in the Advanced tab under Custom fields on the Asset detail page.\n\nNote\n\nDefining dependencies and access management is impossible if a metaproperty is not a main filter.\n\nDrilldown results - if you filter for a metaproperty, the filter will narrow down the results to the selected metaproperty and the related metaproperties. Other filters will not display. If you clear this option, you can select multiple values in the metaproperty filter, and Bynder will display the combined results.\n\nUse dependencies -when you select this option with the Sidebar metaproperty type, go to theYourwebsitename/select/metapropertyURL and click on an option in that view. The sidebar with all metaproperties and their options will display next to the assets linked to these metaproperty options.\n\nEmpty options in the filter allow users to search for assets not tagged with this metaproperty. This is useful for cleanup and ensuring all assets are tagged with a particular metaproperty. Empty options in the filter are now managed in Smart Filters Management.\n\nExport field - enables the export of metaproperties and their options to an XMP or a CSV file. The option displays when you select assets to download. See Download assets with metadata.\n\nHide public - is hidden for the users who are not logged in.\n\nShow in list view - displays the metaproperty next to the asset thumbnail when the asset overview is displayed as the list view. Show in list view is now managed in Metaproperties in Asset Bank List & Grid Views.\n\nShow in grid view - displays the metaproperty next to the asset thumbnail when the asset overview is displayed as the grid view. Show in grid view is now managed in Metaproperties in Asset Bank List & Grid Views.\n\nHide options without dependencies - if selected, the options that don't have any dependencies will be hidden in the upload, single and multi-edit view. This filter option only works for s elect2 metaproperties.\n\nNote\n\nYou might want to use this option when users create metaproperties and dependencies through the API, and there is significant time before the creation of dependencies and the metaproperty options. This option has been created to prevent users from using the options before their dependencies have been set.\n\nAdd a section in the spotlight results - if selected, the search results for this metaproperty will be displayed as a separate section in the search bar results."
