        "text": "Hi L√©onie,\n\nthanx for your answer / question.\n\nFirst I noticed them when I tried to synchronise the photos from my iPhone to the new GooglePhotos App (curiosity üòâ killed the cat)\n\nAll the file(names) arriving in GooglePhotos became visible there, and were clearly messed up. Took me some time to realise it wasn't Gooles fault.\n\nAfter some further fruitless experimenting I went directly onto the Iphone via usb with a browser app, to check the filenames and structure inside the phone (with AnyTrans and iExplorer).\n\nHere it became clear that the files did not have their original names anymore, but had (so it seems) inherited their parents preview folder names from inside the original Mac Library.\n\nFrom there on, when you try to work with the Phone files, for example as you say , share them in in Shared albums, or email them, or sync them to another App, the names are all wrong of course.\n\nAccording to what you say, it seems this happens only with the files that have been downloaded from the CloudLibrary to the iPhone or iPad, and not with the pictures that were taken with the iDevice itself. These reside in the CamRoll folder and get their correct names (IMG_XXXX) directly from the device. Seems that the 'wrong' names only happen when you try to download from the CloudLibrary onto an iDevice that first fetches previews (with messy preview names). Even waiting and hoping until the previews had been fully downloaded and 'upgraded' to the full quality original files, did not help. Downloading to an (other) Mac apparently doesn't create wrong names as the file and naming structure seems to be correctly mirrored.\n\nI didn't bother to try what you did: from phone sharing in shared folders, but of course I'm not surprised that it becomes messy there too.\n\nUnfortunately syncing the (correct) local PhotosLibrary from the Mac onto the phone directly (via iTunes orso) and then trying to upsync that from the phone to the Cloud is no solution either, as Photos first warns that it will erase the iTunes Photolibrary on the phone and replace it with a Cloud download (that takes centuries (again) of course)\n\nI hope this will be resolved in an upgrade soon, but I have low hopes.\n\nIn the meantime i quit using Photos+iCloud.\n\nGood luck ! üòê Gert\n\nHmm, Yes, I thought it would be something like this.\n\nBut I hoped that it would 'auto-resolve' with the settings option 'download and keep original files' enabled, as opposed to working with 'optimised files'.\n\nAfter the phone said it was up to date, but the files were still 'strange', I tried to disable iCloud. But then the phone warned it was still downloading a number of full-res files (although there was no status indication anywhere else about this). So I didn't disable iCloud but tried agin a while later. Again it warned it was still downloading in the background, and the number of files to be done was lower indeed. And so on a few times, until all full res were downloaded. (the only way to discover that something was actually happening, was to each time selecting the disable iCloud option, getting the warning with the (decreasing) number of files to be downloaded, and then not actually disabling) But after all, the files still had 'preview-names'. I didn't try to compare the resolution and bytes with the actual originals though. Good idea."
