        "text": "A meta description is an HTML element that provides a brief summary of a webpage. A page’s meta description tag is displayed as part of the search snippet in a search engine results page (SERP) and is meant to give the user an idea of the content that exists within the page and how it relates to their search query. In some cases, Google may rewrite your meta descriptions for display in their SERPs to better match their perception of a searcher’s intent.\n\nSome people like to describe meta description length in terms of character count and others prefer to think of it in terms of screen pixels. Technically, a meta description can be any length you want, but the reason site owners give consideration to this particular FAQ is because search engines will truncate meta descriptions to tailor the layout of their SERPs to fit the device being used by a searcher.\n\nFor example, a mobile phone user might sometimes see a meta description of a different length than a laptop user will. Here’s an example of Google showing an ellipsis (...) where it is truncating a SERP entry’s meta description after the word “see”:\n\nThere are a number of free meta description preview tools like the one pictured above from To the Web, which emulate what your mobile and desktop SERP result might look like based on the meta description you provide. These can be useful to play around with, but it’s important to know that these types of tools are not always perfectly accurate.\n\nFor example, if you compare the above screenshot to the one shown earlier, you will see that Google is actually truncating the live result to a shorter length than the one being displayed by the emulator. The most accurate way to understand how Google is handling your meta descriptions is to look at your own results in the SERPs across a variety of devices.\n\nDo meta descriptions affect search rankings?\n\nIn the early days of search, some SEOs believed that meta descriptions had a direct impact on search engine rankings. However, as long ago as 2009, Google announced that neither meta descriptions nor meta keywords factor into their ranking algorithms. It’s good to have an official statement on this once-controversial topic, but Google’s answer doesn’t quite convey the full picture of the role meta descriptions might play in rankings.\n\nThe ideal purpose of most meta descriptions is to persuade searchers to click through from the results to your page. Because many SEOs strongly believe click-through rates (CTR) may positively impact a page’s ability to rank well in Google’s SERPs, meta descriptions may well be thought of as having an indirect impact on rank.\n\nYou need to know that even this concept of CTR impacting rank has had its own historical controversy. Search Engine Land has compiled a massive document of every major statement Google and its reps have ever made about CTR. However, since the 2024 Google API leaks, it has become clear that clicks inform Google’s concept of site quality, and thus, clicks may be viewed as a ranking factor. The degree of their influence is a matter for further study, but the main thing to keep in mind is that there is zero controversy over whether meta descriptions influence click-through rates to your website, and this matters a ton to your organization!\n\nHow do meta descriptions affect CTR?\n\nThis question brings us to the most practical usage of the meta description element. For a moment, imagine that you are a searcher rather than a site owner. SERPs like Google’s are really just a list of options, and you have to choose what you want to click on.\n\nLet’s say you’re hoping to improve your garden’s ecosystem at home by planting native wildflowers, and you’re turning to the internet for help. Which of these two entries meets your needs?\n\nIs it the first result, providing a list of wildflowers, as the meta description indicates? Or is it the second result, offering to sell you wildflower seeds, as indicated by the meta description? When the title tag element doesn’t offer quite enough context, the meta description offers more screen space to describe what the searcher can expect to find on the page if they click through.\n\nAnd that’s the beauty of the meta description tag in a nutshell: if it matches the intent of the searcher, it can persuade them to click through to your site.\n\nIf only the dynamic were always as simple as that, this would be the end of this article. But we’re not quite there yet because Google often doesn’t leave it up to you site owners to decide what appears in this influential element of the search engine results. Read on!\n\nIn 2020, a large-scale study by Portent found that:\n\nGoogle rewrites the meta descriptions for 71% of first-page SERP entries in mobile results\n\nGoogle rewrites the meta descriptions for 68% of first-page SERP entries in desktop results\n\nIn other words, if you’ve succeeded at working your way to top visibility in Google’s results, you have only about a 30% chance of the meta descriptions you’ve crafted actually being displayed by the search engine. Questions immediately start bubbling to the surface as soon as site owners first encounter this information. We’ll answer the two biggest FAQs now.\n\n1. Why does Google rewrite meta descriptions?\n\nGoogle’s John Mueller provided a variety of cases in which Google might rewrite meta descriptions, including:\n\nThe page has an empty meta description field.\n\nThe meta description field doesn’t instill trust in Google because it contains something like a string of keywords that Google feels won’t be useful to searchers.\n\nThe contents of a page include information about multiple topics (keywords), and Google is trying to match the meta description to a searcher’s search phrase by pulling some of that language off the page instead of using what’s been written in the meta description field. We can see an example of this here if we search for the phrase “beavers return to Scotland” and check out the meta description:\n\nIt’s not always easy to understand Google’s logic in these choices, and it can definitely be frustrating for site owners when they see the meta descriptions they’ve worked hard to write being replaced by something Google thinks is “better.” But, as always, site owners have to remember that Google’s SERPs belong to Google and they can apply whatever rules they think make sense. The scenario definitely brings up further questions, like…\n\n2. Should I bother to write meta descriptions if Google is just going to overwrite them?\n\nBecause Google will generate a meta description for pages that lack one, some site owners now simply leave this field blank in their code or their CMS. If your organization is overwhelmed with work right now and you are having to wisely budget every minute of your day, you could choose to go this route in favor of prioritizing other SEO and marketing tasks, but it’s not ideal, and it could overlook opportunities. Considering that:\n\nThe meta description is a way to help Google understand the contents of your page\n\nYour custom meta descriptions will display to searchers some of the time\n\nMeta descriptions have so much power to influence CTR to your website\n\nYour meta descriptions will often display when you link to your content from your social profiles\n\n…yes, you should still make it a best practice to write a custom meta description for all of the important pages of your website. And, you can take comfort from knowing that Google’s habit of fetching actual text from your pages much of the time to re-write this field to better match searchers’ queries isn’t always a bad thing. It could actually improve your CTR some of the time.\n\nSo now, with everything you’ve learned so far about meta descriptions, your big question will be…\n\nGoogle’s examples make it clear that the meta description is, in fact, a marketing element with a strong potential to influence searchers. Some SEOs like to describe it as a place to feature your elevator pitch for the page, encapsulating in just a few well-chosen words why a searcher should click through. Given this, ask yourself the following questions to help you write the best possible meta descriptions:\n\nWhat is appearing in my competitors’ meta descriptions for the search phrases I’m focusing on, and how can I stand out?\n\nHow much am I investing in understanding the intent and needs of the public I want to serve, and are those elements reflected in my descriptions?\n\nWhat is the unique value proposition (UVP) of my page?\n\nHow can I describe my UVP in the fewest but most impactful words?\n\nDoes my meta description incorporate E-E-A-T principles, giving searchers strong reasons to click through because, for example, my page features first-hand experience, recognized expertise, content written by an accredited authority on the subject, or particular elements that instill trust?\n\nWould I rather have someone click through to my site, phone me, or drive to me right from the SERPs because I’ve included my phone number or address in the meta description? This goes for hours of operation, too, and the decision should be based on your goals.\n\nIs there an opportunity to engage emotions or attention with my meta description so that searchers feel a desire to click through for more information?\n\nIf I am updating an existing page to reflect new information, have I checked my meta description to see if it needs to be rewritten to reflect the revised content?\n\nThis eighth point brings us to the last thing you need to take into account regarding the meta-description element.\n\nThe truth about websites is that they can get messy over time without tending, and as they grow to encompass a large number of pages, elements like meta description tags can become overlooked or outdated. Because of this reality, it’s important to have a workflow in place to regularly audit your whole site to discover issues that have cropped up as the years go by and your organization and published assets grow.\n\nUse of a product like Moz Pro Site Crawl (get your free 30-day trial here) will help you find and fix low-quality or broken meta descriptions across your website. The frequency with which you perform such a crawl should be based on the rate at which your website is growing. The more pages you publish, the more proactive you need to be about maintaining site quality so that both search engines and searchers are having a clear, usable experience with your brand that drives clicks and conversions for your organization."
