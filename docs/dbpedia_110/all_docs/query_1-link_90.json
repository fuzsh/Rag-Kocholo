        "text": "This is called the minimap, and, as stated in that link,\n\nIf you would like to disable minimap, you can set \"editor.minimap.enabled\": false in your user or workspace settings.\n\nOnce you save the settings file, the minimap will be gone.\n\nYou can also toggle the minimap from the Command Palette. You can go to 'View' and select Command Palette or just Ctrl+Shift+P and type in the word 'minimap', you will instantly get the option to toggle the minimap.\n\nClick on \"File\" -> \"Preferences\" -> \"Settings\" After Settings open, in \"search settings\" or press \"Ctrl+f\" type \"editor.minimap.enabled\" this will take you direct to the settings. On left of it edited option will be available right click to it. And set it to \"false\" After wards you can see the right side pane is hide.\n\nWhile all the answers here will accomplish what the original question asks, they are showing a dated, manual way of hiding the minimap. Current versions of Code have a \"Toggle Minimap\" item in the View menu, which will hide the minimap without the need to edit anything manually in User Settings.\n\nI know of 3 ways to show/hide it.\n\nView -> Show Minimap\n\nCtrl+Shift+P -> Toggle Minimap\n\nSettings.json -> \"editor.minimap.enabled\": false\n\nI also made a Youtube tutorial here demonstrating all three ways.\n\nOowekyala's answer is correct. I am adding a description with image for better understanding. Here is the number from 1 to 5 that describe the steps. Firstly click on File->Preferences->Settings. Then you will get User Setting page. Next, type \"editor.minimap.enabled\" in the search box(step-4). you will get setting option. On left of it edited option(step-5) will be available right click to it.\n\nThis thing is called minimap\n\nto toggle is on and off\n\ncrtl+p then search for \">minimap\" then just click enter\n\nAnd if you again want to use it, repeat above step's again\n\nOn Mac: Code - Preferences - Settings, and in the right panel add the following line:\n\n\"editor.minimap.enabled\": false\n\nPlease care the commas, this file needs them after each but the last line. (It will warn you if a comma is missing.)"
