        "text": "Open Graph (OG) is a technology that social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., use to pull data from your site when you share the URL of your site on those services. You can specify the information shared in your siteâs link previews with Open Graph settings.Â\n\nNeed to know: If you havenât set up your Open Graph settings, random content (or no content) will appear when your site is shared on social media.Â\n\nIn this lesson, youâll learn:Â\n\nHow to set Open Graph tags\n\nHow to set dynamic Open Graph tags\n\nHow to test and debug Open Graph settings\n\nHow to troubleshoot missing Open Graph images\n\nHow to set Open Graph tags\n\nIn Webflow, you can set 3 Open Graph tags:Â\n\nOpen Graph title â the text that displays as the pageâs title when that pageâs link is shared\n\nOpen Graph description â the text that displays under the title and provides a description of the pageâs content\n\nOpen Graph image â the image that displays above the title and description\n\nGood to know: Open Graph content works best when itâs specific to the page being shared. For example, your home pageâs Open Graph content should be different from your pricing pageâs Open Graph content. You canât set Open Graph tags globally, and Open Graph tags apply only to the page on which youâve set the settings â so itâs best practice to set Open Graph tags for each of your pages.\n\nYou can view and set the Open Graph settings for a page by going to Pages panel > Page settings > Open Graph settings.\n\nPro tip: On sites with Localization enabled, you can localize your page-level Open Graph settings. Learn more about localizing Open Graph settings.Â\n\nOpen Graph title and descriptionÂ\n\nYou can enter an Open Graph title and description manually, or pull your Open Graph title and description from your SEO title and meta description by clicking the checkboxes below each Open Graph field.Â\n\nOpen Graph image\n\nFor your Open Graph image, enter a direct link to an image (i.e., a URL that ends in the filename with the image extension).Â\n\nTo use an image from the Asset panel in the Open Graph image field:Â\n\nHover over the image in the Asset panel\n\nClick the settings âcogâ icon that appears\n\nRight-click the âlinkâ icon next to the asset name in the Asset details menu\n\nCopy the linkÂ\n\nPaste the link in the Open Graph image field\n\nLearn more: Optimize images to generate better site previews\n\nHow to set dynamic Open Graph tags\n\nOn Collection pages, you can define a pattern that all pages in a Collection will use for their Open Graph information. That way, rather than manually writing the Open Graph title for each Collection item, all Collection items automatically generate their Open Graph title, description, and image based on the pattern you set. For example, if you have a Collection of blog posts, you can use dynamic data to pull content from your postâs name or title Collection field in your Open Graph settings.\n\nJust like static pages, you can edit this information by going to Pages panel > Page settings > Open Graph settings.Â\n\nOpen Graph title and descriptionÂ\n\nTo populate your Open Graph title and description fields with dynamic data from a Collection field, click Add field.Â\n\nYou can also enter an Open Graph title and description manually, or pull your Open Graph title and description from your SEO title and meta description by clicking the checkboxes below each Open Graph field.Â Â\n\nOpen Graph image\n\nTo set an Open Graph image on a Collection page, click the Open Graph image dropdown and choose an Image field from your Collection (e.g., main image, thumbnail image, etc.). If your Collection doesnât contain an Image field, you wonât be able to set an Open Graph image.\n\nNote: All Open Graph images in a Collection must share the same dimensions.Â\n\nHow to test and debug Open Graph settings\n\nYou may want to preview your links before sharing them to understand how theyâll appear on social media sites, or refresh your Open Graph content when old data appears in your link preview.\n\nMany popular social media sites provide their own tools for previewing, debugging, and refreshing your Open Graph data:Â\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nNote: Pinterest and Instagram donât have specific tools for validating Open Graph data. You can use Facebookâs debugger tool to check how these apps may display your site. You must be logged into Facebook to use the Facebook debugger.\n\nFacebookÂ\n\nFacebook provides their own debugger, which you can use to scrape (i.e., index) your link and pull in the most recent Open Graph data.Â\n\nTo use the Facebook debugger, paste in your link and click Debug. If youâve made changes to your Open Graph settings and the data that appears is outdated, click Scrape Again to refresh the data.Â\n\nNote: You must be logged into Facebook to use the Facebook debugger.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedInâs Post Inspector lets you request a re-scrape of your link and check when LinkedIn last updated the link preview. You can also use the Post Inspector to debug issues with your Open Graph data.Â\n\nTo use the LinkedIn Post Inspector, paste in your link and click Inspect. You can click on a property (e.g., Title, Type, Image, etc.) to learn more about how the value was chosen by LinkedIn.Â\n\nNote: You must be logged into LinkedIn to use the LinkedIn Post Inspector.Â\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitterâs Card Validator provides a Log which contains debugging information about your linkâs Open Graph data. To use the Twitter Card Validator, paste in your link and click Preview card.Â\n\nTwitter no longer displays a preview of your link in the Card Validator. To preview how your link will appear when shared on Twitter, compose a tweet and paste in your link.Â\n\nNote: You must be logged into Twitter to use the Card Validator and Tweet Composer.\n\nHow to troubleshoot missing Open Graph images\n\nWhen sharing a link to your site on Facebook, you may notice that your link preview contains only a title and description, and the image youâve set in your Open Graph settings is missing.Â\n\nTypically, this happens when a page is shared and the preview is generated for the first time, so you may be able to resolve the issue by removing and then re-adding the link in your post. However, there are a few best practices that can prevent this issue from occurring:Â\n\nUse the same dimensions for all Open Graph images on your site. Facebook recommends using images that have a width of at least 1080 pixels. Learn more about Facebookâs best practices for sharing images.Â\n\nPre-cache your images by running the link through the Facebook debugger tool. You should also do this after you update your Open Graph image.Â\n\nUse Open Graph tags to specify your image dimensions to the web crawler. This lets the web crawler render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it. To do this, add the following code snippet in Site settings > Custom code tab > Head code section, replacing the content values for the width and height with the respective pixel values of the images on your site (if youâve used the same dimensions for all Open Graph images):Â\n\n<metaproperty=\"og:image:width\"content=\"1200\"><metaproperty=\"og:image:height\"content=\"630\">\n\nâLearn more about using custom code in your siteâs head and body tags.Â"
