        "text": "What is a SERP feature?\n\nA SERP feature is any result on a Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) that is not a traditional organic result. The most common SERP Features are:\n\nRich Snippets which add a visual layer to an existing result (e.g., review stars for product ratings)\n\nPaid Results that are bought by bidding on keywords (e.g., AdWords or Google Shopping)\n\nUniversal Results that appear in addition to organic results (e.g., image results, new results, featured snippets)\n\nKnowledge Graph data which appears as panels or boxes (e.g., weather, Celebrity Knowledge Panel)\n\nIn the early days of Google, every result on the SERP looked the same, and these traditional organic results have not changed much in appearance over the years.\n\n2009\n\n2016\n\nHowever, beginning with AdWords in 2001, Google has been very busy adding other non-organic results into the SERP.\n\nHow can I discover which SERP features my site has?\n\nIn Moz Pro's Keyword Explorer, you can find out which of your tracked keywords trigger a SERP feature. Britney Muller explains how:\n\nWhat are some of the most popular SERP features?\n\nThe table below shows 16 SERP Features that commonly appear in Google SERPs. The icon shows how we identify them in Moz Pro. For examples of even more SERP Features, see the Mega-SERP: A Visual Guide to Google blog post.\n\nAdwords (Bottom)\n\nDescription\n\nTraditional AdWords ads come in many flavors now, but the most common type appears at the top and/or bottom of the left-hand column, above and below organic results. Each ad has a colored [Ad] label next to it.\n\nAds push organic results down the page and can impact CTR (especially on mobile browsers).\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\n“Ads are ranked primarily based on how relevant and useful they are to what the person searched for, your bid, and a few other factors.” - Google Support\n\nAdwords (Top)\n\nDescription\n\nTraditional AdWords ads come in many flavors now, but the most common type appears at the top and/or bottom of the left-hand column, above and below organic results. Each ad has a colored [Ad] label next to it.\n\nAds push organic results down the page and can impact CTR (especially on mobile browsers)\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\n“Ads are ranked primarily based on how relevant and useful they are to what the person searched for, your bid, and a few other factors.” - Google Support\n\nFeatured Snippet\n\nDescription\n\nWhen Google wants to answer a question that isn't in the core Knowledge Graph, they may attempt to find that answer in the index. This creates a special class of organic result with information extracted from the target page.\n\nFeatured Snippets have higher CTRs than regular organic results.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nIn almost all cases, featured snippets extract content from the page that answers the query in the most specific way. While there is usually only a single featured snippet shown, rarely two or more are offered for certain queries.\n\nThese generally represent a big opportunity for pages that already rank #1-5 for the given search query. In January 2020, Google made a big change to how featured snippets show up on the SERPs — learn more in our blog post about it here.\n\nImage Pack\n\nDescription\n\nImage packs are results displayed as a horizontal row of image links, which click through to a Google Images search. Image packs may appear in any organic position.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nImage Packs are special results that appear for specific searches where Google deems that visual content would be valuable. They use ranking rules beyond the core organic algorithm.\n\nWith image content, it is recommended to follow the following best practices (learn more about optimizing your images here):\n\nDescriptive file name\n\nDescriptive alt text\n\nHuman-readable URL\n\nOptimized image size\n\nTitle attribute included\n\nIn-Depth Article\n\nDescription\n\nFor broad or ambiguous terms, Google may return a block of \"in-depth\" articles, which are almost indistinguishable from organic results. They follow somewhat different ranking rules than core organic results, and are dominated by large publishers. Each block of three articles occupies only one organic position.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nIn-Depth Articles are almost exclusively won by large, authoritative publishers. They also commonly share these attributes:\n\nLong-form content (2000-5000 words)\n\nSchema article markup\n\nAuthorship markup\n\nUnique, high quality writing\n\nLearn more here.\n\nKnowledge Card\n\nDescription\n\nKnowledge Cards (part of the Knowledge Graph) cover a lot of ground, from semantic data from human-edited sources (such as WikiData), to semantic data extracted from the Google index, to private data partnerships.\n\nThey typically appear at the top of the SERP on a desktop search.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nAll Knowledge Card results are either based on human-edited data or appear as a result of data agreements with partners. For these reasons, appearing in a Knowledge Card is out of reach for most sites.\n\nThat said, it is useful to understand which keywords are affected by Knowledge Graph results, as knowing this can help you prioritize keywords to target, as well as understand how Google stores entity data about the world.\n\nKnowledge Panel\n\nDescription\n\nKnowledge Panels (aka Knowledge Graph), like Knowledge Cards, extract semantic data from a number of sources including human-edited sources like WikiData, data extracted from the Google index, and private data partnerships.\n\nThey typically appear to the right of the organic results for a desktop search.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nAll Knowledge Panel results are either based on human-edited data or appear as a result of data agreements with partners. For these reasons, appearing in a Knowledge Panel is out of reach for most sites.\n\nThat said, it is useful to understand which keywords are affected by Knowledge Graph results as knowing this can help you prioritize keywords to target, as well as understand how Google stores entity data about the world.\n\nLocal Pack\n\nDescription\n\nFor keywords that Google deems to have local intent (think ‘gastroenterology specialists in Seattle’ or ‘gastroenterology specialists near me’), the SERP will often contain a Local Pack containing the three physical locations Google deems most relevant to the keyword.\n\nThese features dominate the SERP, especially on mobile.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nLocal SEO has changed dramatically in the past couple of years, and local features are evolving rapidly. Especially if you have a brick-and-mortar business, it's important to be very familiar with Google's local space.\n\nLocal SEO is an entire discipline within itself, but a great place to start is our Local Learning Center.\n\nLocal Teaser Pack\n\nDescription\n\nSimilar to a Local Pack, this is a three-pack of local business results (mainly hotels and restaurants) shown on a map,with additional information below like hours of operation, reviews, and images. Options to sort (e.g., by price or rating) are also available.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nLocal SEO has changed dramatically in the past couple of years, and local features are evolving rapidly. Especially if you have a brick-and-mortar business, it's important to be very familiar with Google's local space.\n\nLocal SEO is an entire discipline within itself, but a great place to start is our Local Learning Center.\n\nNews Box\n\nDescription\n\nTime-sensitive and newsworthy topics may generate a block of results from Google News. Since the \"In the news\" update in late 2014, a wider variety of sites are eligible to rank in the news block.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nGetting into Google News results is a very different (and more transparent) process than organic results. Learn more here.\n\nRelated Questions\n\nDescription\n\nThe Related Questions card shows algorithmically-generated questions that Google believes might relate to your search. Each question expands to something that looks like a Featured Snippet. Related Questions are mixed into organic results and their location in the SERP may vary.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nRelated Questions appear to be related to Featured Snippets. In most cases:\n\nRelated Questions are also keywords with Featured Snippets\n\nThe winner of the Featured Snippet, is also the winner of the Related Question\n\nWinning a Related Question might resulted in a small CTR bump. However Related Questions are also useful as a method of finding Featured Snippet keyword opportunities related to your existing keywords. If you find Related Questions on a SERP, try tracking the question as a keyword in itself. Most of the time that keyword will have a Featured Snippet which you can win.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nReviews\n\nDescription\n\nReview stars and rating data are sometimes displayed for products, recipes, and other relevant items. Review/rating data is shown between the destination URL and snippet.\n\nResults with review stars get higher CTR.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nGoogle’s rules on which results are eligible for stars are not published, and differ by industry and vertical. At the very least, schema markup for reviews must exist on the page.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nShopping Results\n\nDescription\n\nPaid Shopping results or Product Listing Ads (PLAs) sell products directly with rich information, such as images and pricing.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nSimilar to AdWords, Shopping is a paid placement.\n\nWhether or not you are in the paid search business, it is a good thing know when you are competing for organic results against keywords with paid results.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nSite Links\n\nDescription\n\nWhen someone searches for an exact domain (suggesting clear brand intent), Google may display an expanded pack of up to 10 sitelinks. The full pack of sitelinks occupies five organic positions, dominating the SERP.\n\nSite Links can benefit your site by:\n\nGenerating higher CTR from the SERP\n\nGetting users to the page they are looking for faster\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nThree factors drive the appearance of Site Links in a SERP:\n\nType of query – Site Links appear mainly on branded terms\n\nSite traffic – Site Links are much more likely to appear on large branded sites with higher traffic\n\nImplementation of SearchAction anchor markup on the site\n\nYou can read more about this here.\n\nTweet\n\nDescription\n\nIn 2015, Google began displaying tweets directly in SERPs, mixed in with organic results. Unlike Google+ results, Twitter results do not seem to require, or be affected by, personalization\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nTwitter results in SERPs aren't \"organic\" in the general sense, but they do strengthen a brand’s visual presence on the SERP and perhaps perceived relevancy.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nVideo\n\nDescription\n\nVideo results (especially YouTube) may display a thumbnail. They used to be a true vertical but are now more of an organic enhancement.\n\nAppearance\n\nObtainability\n\nVideo results will only appear for certain keywords. At the very least, video schema markup must exist on the page.\n\nLearn more about Featured Snippets\n\n5 Steps to Surfacing a SERP Feature Strategy - STAT Blog\n\nFeatured Snippets: What to Know & How to Target - Whiteboard Friday\n\nHow to Optimize for Google's Featured Snippets [Updated for 2022] - Moz Blog\n\nBrand Entity SEO - Whiteboard Friday"
