        "text": "What is termux?\n\nFor those who do not know what termux is:\n\nTermux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.\n\nBasic shortcuts\n\nSo to clean your screen you can press Volume Down + l which is the same as if you were in a normal Linux terminal\n\nTo exit your terminal you can press Volume Down + d\n\nMore advanced keyboard settings (terminal) visit this link on termux wiki.\n\nUse F-droid instead of google play store\n\nThe updated termux version can only be found on the F-droid repo, read more here\n\nIn my case I had difficulties downloading F-droid directly to my android, so I downloaded it on my computer and started a http server using python to download it directly in my phone:\n\nI had to get my local ip (computer) and type it on my firefox on the phone:\n\nThere is also another alternative store: https://auroraoss.com/\n\nEnvironment variables\n\nTermux has a $PREFIX environment variable:\n\nYou can use it in some cases to avoid typing all the above path\n\nInitial install:\n\nFirst install from F-droid:\n\nBacking up termux settings\n\nsource: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux\n\nIn this example, a backup of both home and sysroot will be shown. The resulting archive will be stored on your shared storage (/sdcard) and compressed with gzip.\n\nEnsure that storage permission is granted:\n\nNOTE: Every time you have any permissions problem revoke termux permissions and run termux-setup-storare\n\nBacking up files:\n\nBackup should be finished without any error. There shouldn't be any permission denials unless the user abused root permissions. If you got some warnings about socket files, ignore them.\n\nRestoring\n\nHere will be assumed that you have backed up both home and usr directory into same archive. Please note that all files would be overwritten during the process.\n\nEnsure that storage permission is granted:\n\nExtract home and usr with overwriting everything. Pass --recursive-unlink to remove any junk and orphaned files. Pass --preserve-permissions to set file permissions as in archive, ignoring the umask value. By combining these extra options you will get installation state exactly as was in archive.\n\nNow close Termux with the \"exit\" button from notification and open it again.\n\nBackup using termux-backup:\n\nIn my case I have used this command\n\nTo restore just change \"backup\" for \"restore\"\n\nFix: repository is under maintenance or down\n\nThis solution comes from this youtube video/channel\n\nThe error is as follows:\n\nN: Metadata integrity can't be verified, repository is disabled now.\n\nN: Possible cause: repository is under maintenance or down (wrong sources.list URL?).\n\nThis issue is caused by bad repo sources or mirrors and because of this the package installations fail with an error saying \"repository is under maintenance or down\".\n\nA solution for this issue is to change the mirrors using the termux-change-repo command and that is what this video explains.\n\nSo, the commands are:\n\nUse space to select all the above options until you reach the next screen as follows:\n\nIn my case I chose the second of the list that follows\n\nInstall some useful apps\n\nTIP: You can abbreviate \"install\" just typing \"in\"\n\nCopy your public ssh key to your computer\n\nGenerate your ssh-key on your android:\n\nTIP: When generating your ssh keys do not type any password and set your sshd to allow only public key logins, this way you can login easily.\n\nYou also need to set a password to your use, just in case you need to access your ssh server without your keys:\n\nDiscover your termux \"user\" name:\n\nYou can also get your user name by typing:\n\nStart your sshd:\n\nCopy your computer's ssh public key to your android (termux):\n\nUsing scp\n\nhttps://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access\n\nAccess your termux using nautilus\n\nRemember to change the port number accordingly!\n\nSome useful aliases (~/.bashrc)\n\nSet folders\n\nAccording to termux wiki: In order to have access to shared storage (/sdcard or /storage/emulated/0), Termux needs a storage access permission. It is not granted by default and is not requested on application startup since it is not necessary for normal application functioning.\n\nStorage access permission will not enable write access to the external sdcard and drives connected over USB.\n\ntermux style\n\nHaving a nice looking terminal for me is something essential, so:\n\nHow to use Termux to download YouTube videos\n\nhttps://techwiser.com/how-to-use-termux-to-download-youtube-videos/\n\nSetup your python libs in a more sane way:\n\nThen you can:\n\nThe instalation script:\n\nInstall trash-cli\n\nTrash-cli moves your files to ~/.local/share/Trash\n\nSet youtube-dl script permissions\n\nFasd_cd\n\nFasd (pronounced similar to \"fast\") is a command-line productivity booster. Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX shells. It is inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps track of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly reference them in the command line.\n\nThe name fasd comes from the default suggested aliases f(files), a(files/directories), s(show/search/select), d(directories).\n\nFasd ranks files and directories by \"frecency,\" that is, by both \"frequency\" and \"recency.\" The term \"frecency\" was first coined by Mozilla and used in Firefox (link).\n\nAlso add these lines to yourc .bashrc\n\nBetter bash-completion\n\nBash prompt\n\nI have found an amazing projet that gives you a great bash prompt:\n\nhttps://github.com/1Tech-X/termux-PS1\n\nBashrc file \"~/.bashrc\""
