The company name dropdown list that's displayed is generated from companies that have a LinkedIn Page. If your company doesn't have a LinkedIn Page, no company logo will be shown.\n\nIf a Page is created for your company after you've created your position, you must edit your position and select the company from the dropdown list in order to display the logo. If your company isn't on our list, add a LinkedIn Page to make the name appear the next time you or others add a position to their profile."
