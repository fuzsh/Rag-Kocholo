        "text": "Add topics to build your mind map.\n\nAdd a child topic with a single tap on the \"add topic tool\" or use \"Tab\".\n\nTo add a sibling, use the \"add sibling tool\" or \"Enter\". This adds a new topic to the selected topic's parent.\n\nAdd another central theme by double-tapping in empty space when nothing is selected.\n\nInsert a topic in between two existing topics by using the \"Insert Topic\" command from the (drop-down) menu. (Not available for iPhone)\n\nPlace topics freely\n\nAdd new topics anywhere you want in free form layout.\n\nSelect a topic and double tap on an empty space. This adds a new child topic where you double tapped. Alternatively, drag and release the add topic tool or add sibling tool . SimpleMind adds the topic where you release the tool.\n\nAdd central themes\n\nTo add a new central theme, click in empty space once so no topic is selected. Next double click where you want to add the new central theme.\n\nTip, use the brainstorm mode to add central themes only.\n\nTo move one or more topics to a different location, select and drag the topics.\n\nTo move an entire branch, long press before dragging. This selects the whole branch.\n\nIn free form layout, move topics around freely. Place the topics exactly where you want them to be.\n\nIn auto layout, you cannot move topics around freely. The topics are placed by the auto layout. Use drag and drop to rearrange the topic order.\n\nTip! Mac and Windows: Press Shift to select the entire branch without the long press delay.\n\nSelect multiple elements to move, or customize, all the selected elements in one go.\n\nYou can select either topics, relations, images or labels. Selected elements show a thick border.\n\nMac and Windows:\n\nClick once to select a single element.Long press an element to select a single branch or use shift+click.To include, or exclude, a single element, use Control+click (Windows) or Command+click (Mac).\n\nTo include or exclude an entire branch, use Control/Command+long press.\n\nTo use Rectangular lasso selection Control+Drag (Windows) or Command+Drag (Mac) and use Shift+Command/Control+Drag to extend the selection.\n\nClick in empty space (or press Escape) to exit multiple selection.\n\niPad&iPhone and Android:\n\nTap once to select a single element.Long press an element to start the multiple selection.\n\nWhen in multiple selection mode, single tap to include or exclude an element. Long press to include or exclude an entire branch.\n\nRectangular lasso selection: Long press in empty space to start and drag to select.\n\nTap in empty space to exit multiple selection.\n\nIf you type longer texts, add linebreaks or use the word wrap tool.\n\nAdd line breaks when you type.\n\nA linebreak breaks the line you type and starts a new line. An additional line break creates a paragraph.\n\nWindows and Mac: Use Alt+Enter or Ctrl+Enter to insert a line break.\n\nAndroid and iPad&iPhone: Use Enter.\n\nWord wrap tool\n\nThe word wrap tool adds line breaks to text. This makes the topic look less wide. Long press the word wrap tool to automatically wrap the topic.\n\nThe word wrap tool removes existing lines breaks before it adds new line breaks. It maintains paragraphs and lists. Those are recognized based on markdown syntax.\n\nResize the topic\n\nAdd a minimum width and height for a topic to change the topic size, regardless of topic text. You can select this via Element style. If you want to use this more often, you may want to add the \"Resize Tool\" to your topic tools via Preferences - General - Topic Tools. Simply drag the tool to resize the topic.\n\nCollapase and expand topics\n\nCollapse topics to keep oversight in large maps. When a topic is collapsed, the whole branch is hidden. Expand is the reverse of collapse. Tap the collapse tool to either collapse or expand its child topics.\n\nLong press the tool for additional options like collapse children, full expand, etc.\n\nHide and show topics\n\nRather than collapsing a topic, use the hide/show tool to hide and show (child-)topics one by one. To hide, select the relation (line) and tap . To show, tap the show tool .\n\nLong press the tool for more options options\n\nDisplay hide tool\n\nUnlike the collapse/expand tool, the hide/show tool is not shown when you select a topic. You can change this in \"Preferences\" - \"General Options\".\n\nLearn more in this video:\n\nSimpleMind for iPad&iPhone and SimpleMind for Android support adding one or more video recordings to a topic.\n\nTo add a video recording, select the topic you want to add the video to. Use the topic toolbar , the image icon and tap “Add Linked Image” and “Record Movie”.\n\nOnce done, SimpleMind adds an image with a thumbnail of the video in the mind map. Double tap the thumbnail to play back the video.\n\nAdding video recordings is possible only when using a built-in cloud.\n\nHow a mind map looks is controlled by styles. The styles control everything, such as colors, topics, lines, font size, and more. Pick a style sheet to set the default style for the mind map. Customize the details by changing the style of one or more of the elements.\n\nStyle Sheet:\n\nTop level. The style sheet controls most of what you see in the mind map. When no other style settings are applied, the Style Sheet defines the appearance of the mind map.\n\nSelect any of the default style sheets, or create your own custom style sheet.\n\nMind Map Style:\n\nUse the mind map style to redefine aspects of the selected style sheet, for that mind map only.\n\nFor example, to change the background color for one mind map. Or the color of the relations.\n\nElement Style:\n\nUse the element style to redefine the appearance for a single element. For example, to make one crosslink red.\n\nAdditionally, set Preferences that operate on a global level for all mind maps.\n\nTip: The layout of a mind map, how topics are organized, is set via layouts.\n\nA style sheet contains a complete definition for a mind map’s appearance. It defines a color scheme and sub-styles for topics and relations. SimpleMind has a set of good looking built-in style sheets to quickly change the look of your mind map. When you switch to Dark Mode the built-in style sheets will also switch to Dark Mode.\n\nDownload more stylesheets here or create custom style sheets.\n\nTo select a style sheet:\n\nMac and Windows: Click the style sheet icon in the toolbar.\n\niPad/iPhone and Android: Tap on the style sheet icon or select “Style Sheet” from the overflow menu.\n\n&nbsp\n\nCreate custom style sheets\n\nCreate your own custom style sheet to suit your needs perfectly.

An element can be a topic, label, relation, crosslink or groupborder. Customize one or more elements, use style presets or use copy/paste style.\n\nWhen the mind map has a branch based style sheet, changing a topic’s color affects the whole branch. Should you do not want this, use a level based style sheet instead.\n\nOpen the style panel with the style icon to easily customize elements to your liking.\n\nMobile devices: If you don't see the icon use the overflow menu - Style.\n\nThe style panel shows different commands, depending on what element you've selected. For example, when an image is selected you can select crop to shape.\n\nStyle presets\n\nRather than selecting the same custom combinations over and over again, use presets. A presets can apply multiple customizations in one click.\n\nUse a style preset: In the style panel select \"use style preset\" . Select one of the style presets.\n\nCreate a custom style preset: Use the style panel to customize the element(s) exactly how you want. Once done, select the \"add style preset\" .\n\nSimpleMind will only save your custom choices as a preset. If you customize only the topic border shape for example, that alone will be saved in the preset. As a result, you can easily apply the preset to any topic, without changing f.e. the color or font size.\n\nCopy or paste Style\n\nInstead of making new presets, you could use copy style and paste style .\n\nFormat (parts of) text in topics, label and notes using rich text. For example, make one word italic or bold.\n\nImportant! SimpleMind for Windows can only show rich text in notes.\n\nWindows: To format text in Notes use the toolbar in Notes. Change whole topics and whole labels via the style toolbar.\n\nMac: Select the text and via the menu use Style – Font.\n\niPad: Select the text.

Not all Android devices support this.\n\nNote, use the word wrap tool to add line breaks.\n\nEasily create and play a slideshow presentation with SimpleMind. To start, open the slideshow view.\n\nMac and Windows: Use the inspector or the main menu – “View” – “Slideshow”.\n\niPad and Android tablets: select “Slideshow” from the menu.\n\nThis feature is not available for phones.\n\nCreate a default Slide Show in one tap\n\nTap on the \"Add default slides\" button so SimpleMind will create a slide for each branch.\n\nCreate a custom slideshow\n\nSelect one or more topics and tap \"Add Slide\". The new slide will be added after the last selected slide. Reorder the slides by using drag and drop.\n\nSee more in this video\n\nPlay or export\n\nStart the presentation by clicking \"Start Slide Show\", or use \"Export Slides\" to export all slides as .png images. When using \"Export Sildes\" SimpleMind will create a .zip with all the .png images for your convenience.\n\nTips!\n\nHave you changed your mind map? For example, you've made a topic red? No need to start over. Simply select the slide and tap on the \"retake slide\" button.\n\nLong press \"Add slides\" or \"Delete\" for more options.\n\nSelect a parent topic and Use \"Show Childeren sequentially\". This will add new slides, starting with the parent, next the parent and topic 1, next parent and topic 1 and 2 etc.\n\nAdd the .png images as slides into a presentation app.\n\nSimpleMind can search for mind maps, or search inside a mind map.\n\nSearch in an opened mind map\n\nUse this to find topics or labels with a specific text. All other topics/labels will be faded, so the search results stand out. The search also applies to the outliner.\n\nMac: Command+F and enter text.\n\nWindows: Control+F and enter text.\n\niPad/iPhone/Android: Select “search” from the (overflow) menu and enter text.\n\nTip: Use the arrows in the search window to move from the first found topic/label to the next and so forth.\n\nAdvanced Search in an opened mind map - (Mac, Windows, iPad)\n\nThe advanced search can also filter topics by (un)checked state, a specific icon, before a date or after a date. Filters can be combined.\n\nLong press the search tool and check “advanced search”.\n\nSearch for mind maps\n\nMac and Windows: In Multiple Windows mode Use the main menu - File - Search in directories. SimpleMind shows a list with the found mind maps.\n\nThe first time you use this, select the directories you want SimpleMind to search in, for example \"documents\" and \"Dropbox\". In single window mode use \"search\" in the mind map explorer. Mac can also use Spotlight or Finder to search for text inside mind maps, including notes. iPad/iPhone/Android:First select the storage, for example, Local or Dropbox. Type the text in the search bar in the toolbar. SimpleMind shows a list with the found mind maps.\n\nLong press the search icon to select “Search Titles” or “Full Text Search”.\n\nIf mind maps are stored in iCloud, use the Files app to search for mind maps.\n\nSimpleMind can show mind maps in Dark Mode. The built-in style sheets support dark mode, meaning if you switch to dark mode the style sheet will as well.\n\nFor example, this is a mind map in Light Mode:\n\nAnd this is the same mind map in Dark Mode:\n\nMac: By default when Mac is in Dark Mode, SimpleMind will be as well. You can change this via the main menu \"SimpleMind\"-\"Preferences\" or turn this off/on for stylesheets only by clicking the options wheel in Stylesheets.\n\nWindows: Change to dark mode via the main menu \"SimpleMind\"-\"Preferences\". Or change the stylesheets only in Stylesheets, next click the options wheel and select Dark Mode.\n\niPad&iPhone and Android: When your device is in Dark Mode, SimpleMind will be as well. You can turn this off/on for stylesheets via the options wheel in Stylesheets.\n\nChange settings that apply to all mind maps in Preferences. For example, fonts, snap options, general options and image options.\n\nTo open the preferences:\n\nMac or Windows: Select from the main menu “SimpleMind” → “Preferences”.\n\niPad/iPhone and Android: Select “Preferences” from the drop down/ overflow menu.\n\nFonts\n\nUsing the default fonts assures mind maps will look identical across platforms and devices. Should you adjust the default global fonts on one device, please remember to select the same fonts on your other devices.\n\nTip! Rather than increasing the font size, change the editor scale factor. This will make the font look bigger (or smaller).\n\nAdjusting the editor scale factor, rather than adjusting font sizes, assures your mind maps will still look identical across all devices.\n\nWe like to keep it simple. You need one license per platform and you pay only for what you need.\n\nSimpleMind is available on four platforms:\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\niPad & iPhone\n\nAndroid\n\nFor example, you want to use SimpleMind on Android and Windows. Only buy a license \"SimpleMind for Android\" and a license \"SimpleMind for Windows\".\n\nSimpleMind 2 is a one-time purchase per platform, there are no subscriptions or monthly fees. All updates in SimpleMind 2 are free and included.\n\nClick here for links to the stores\n\nWe like to keep it simple. SimpleMind is a one-time purchase per platform. There are no monthly or yearly subscription fees. SimpleMind is sold at the sharpest price possible per platform. Always.\n\nTherefor we do not offer discounts, such as student or reseller discounts.\n\nSimpleMind for Mac and SimpleMind for Windows are both sold in the same store. Because of that, we can offer combination packs. Those prices are visible here . Unfortunately, we are unable to upgrade an existing license at a later time.\n\nFor existing customers, to reinstall SimpleMind follow these steps.\n\nPlease note, you need a license per platform.\n\nMac - AppStore edition\n\nIf you purchased in the AppStore, download again in the AppStore.\n\nIf you purchased SimpleMind Pro, install SimpleMind Pro.\n\nIf you used in-app purchase in SimpleMind, install SimpleMind. Apple will recognize your purchase and unlock all Pro features.\n\nWindows and/or Mac\n\nUse the original download and activation e-mail to (re)install SimpleMind. Should you not have this you can download a copy from the MyCommerce Self Service portal.\n\nContact us for support if you cannot login and include\n\n- the original e-mail address and order number.\n\n- or a screenshot of SimpleMind - About (via the main menu - SimpleMind – About).\n\niPad&iPhone\n\nInstall is handled by the App Store.\n\nIf you purchased SimpleMind Pro, install SimpleMind Pro.\n\nIf you used in-app purchase in SimpleMind, install SimpleMind. Apple will recognize your purchase and unlock all Pro features.\n\nSee also Apple Support.\n\nAndroid\n\nDownload again in the Google Play Store.\n\nTrouble installing or asked to pay again? Please click here.\n\nAfter purchase you can continue working with the mind maps you made using the 30-day trial or the free edition.\n\nMac and iPad&iPhone:If you used the free edition and purchased SimpleMind Pro as a separate app, transfer the mind maps to the new edition. See how.\n\nAndroid: When you first run SimpleMind Pro you will be asked if you want to transfer the mind maps. Should you decline, you can still transfer manually.\n\nMind maps are saved on your device or a cloud of choice, such as Dropbox or iCloud Drive. You can make as many mind maps as you want. The free editions can save mind maps on your device only.\n\nMac or Windows\n\nEach time you create a new document, you name it and choose where to save it — for example on your desktop or in a folder. If you choose to save the mind map in a cloud folder, such as Dropbox or iCloud Drive, the cloud app syncs the changes with the cloud.\n\nMake sure to install the cloud app from the cloud's website first, unless you use iCloud Drive.\n\nMac: When using iCloud Drive and SimpleMind Pro for iPhone&iPad, save mind maps in the SimpleMind folder created by SimpleMind for iPad&iPhone (the folder with the SimpleMind icon). The reason is that SimpleMind is not allowed to access any files outside that one SimpleMind folder as a security measure by Apple.\n\niPad&iPhone\n\nWhen you first start SimpleMind Pro or used in-app purchase, SimpleMind will ask if you want to use iCloud Drive. If you do, this will create a SimpleMind folder in iCloud Drive where mind maps will be saved. You can also use built-in clouds (such as Dropbox, Google Drive or NutStore) to sync your mind maps, see how to connect in this help.\n\nAlternatively, store mind maps in any folder in Apple Files - meaning you can also store in a folder created by a cloud app. See how in this help.\n\nAndroid\n\nSimpleMind for Android can save mind maps on your device (Local) or in a built-in cloud: Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. Mind maps saved in a cloud will be synced with that cloud.\n\nSee how to connect to a cloud.\n\nSimpleMind Pro (Mac and/or Windows) has two ways of working with mind map files.\n\nMultiple windows\n\nSingle window with Explorer\n\nYou can change the application style via the main menu SimpleMind -> Preferences -> General Options.\n\nMultiple windows\n\nThis is the style you're most likely familiar with from other apps. Mind maps, and linked mind maps, open in a new window making it possible to work in multiple mind maps simultaneously. In SimpleMind for Mac you can optionally select to open mind maps in new tabs instead of new windows (via Preferences).\n\nSingle window with Explorer\n\nThis displays the Mind Map Explorer (navigator) on the left side of your screen. It shows thumbnails of your mind maps so you can browse though your mind maps from within the app. You can choose what directories are shown in the Explorer.\n\nIn Single Window style each mind map is opened in the same window, making it easier to focus. Linked mind maps also open in the same window, use the back button to switch back to the previous mind map.\n\nClick on the yellow folder icon to add a directory to the Mind Map Explorer such as \"My Documents\" and/or a cloud folder.\n\nShow or hide the Explorer by clicking the Explorer icon in the toolbar.\n\nShare in .smmx format:\n\nShare in original .smmx format via e-mail or another app. The other person can open the .smmx mind map with SimpleMind Pro. It does not matter if that is SimpleMind Pro for Mac, Windows, Android or iPad&iPhone.\n\nUse a shared cloud folder: To avoid sending mind maps back and forth use a shared cloud folder.\n\nNote! SimpleMind does not support real time editing, only one person should edit the mind map at the same time to avoid copies.\n\nIf you haven't already, store your Mind Map in a cloud.\n\nShare a folder via the cloud's website. The person(s) you shared the mind map with may need to accept your invite.\n\nStore mind maps you want to share in that shared folder so everyone can open and edit those mind maps.\n\nGoogle Drive works in a different way, it shows folders that are shared with you in \"Shared with you\". Google Drive does not display this folder in the Google Drive app for Desktops, so you cannot use this on Desktop.\n\nSharing your mind map with non-SimpleMind users?\n\nIf they have Mac, Windows, iPhone or iPad, share your mind map in original .smmx format and include a link to the free SimpleMind Viewer. Your colleague, teacher or friend can open the mind map and use features such as collapse branches, see the mind map as an outline, show notes and more.\n\nOr share your mind map as a .pdf. Any device can open a .pdf and they will see the mind map as a static image. If you have notes, make sure to export a Notes report as well.\n\nWhen topics jump back after you moved them, you’re using an auto layout. Click here to learn more about this and how to change this to a free form layout.\n\niPad&iPhone and Android\n\nIf editing is not possible, for example moving a topic, most likely you’ve zoomed out too much. Zooming out beyond a certain level will switch the mind map to read-only, this prevents unwanted changes.\n\nZoom in to bring back the normal functionality.\n\nIf you prefer to work zoomed out, you can adjust the editor scale in Preferences.\n\nAfter purchase you can continue working with the mind maps you made using the 30-day trial or the free edition.\n\nMac and iPad&iPhone:If you used the free edition and purchased SimpleMind Pro as a separate app, transfer the mind maps to the new edition. See how.\n\nAndroid: When you first run SimpleMind Pro you will be asked if you want to transfer the mind maps. Should you decline, you can still transfer manually.\n\nMind maps are not stored on our servers, nor do we have access to your mind maps or data. Therefore we cannot restore your mind maps.\n\nIf you stored the mind map on a cloud, you may be able to restore a previous version of your mind map via the cloud's website. Some clouds, like Dropbox, can even restore a deleted file.\n\nA trash-can image in the mind map means the mind map is in the trash.\n\nDeleting a local mind map moves it to the local trash folder. To remind you that you’ve deleted this mind map, the mind map displays a trash can image. To get rid of this, move the mind map to any other folder. The same applies to mind maps accidentally created in the trash folder.\n\nUse “Empty Trash” to completely and irreversibly delete the mind maps in the trash folder.\n\nTo delete, rename or move mind maps, tap \"Edit\" in the mind map explorer. Select a mind map and tap the command at the bottom of the mind map list.\n\nOr navigate to the mind map.Left swipe a little bit and tap \"More\" to rename, move or duplicate.\n\nTap \"Delete\" or left swipe completely to delete the mind map.\n\nTo delete or rename folders in iCloud, please use Apple's Files app. SimpleMind does not have permission to edit your folders.\n\nTip! To copy an existing (local) mind map to \"Files\" use \"Share\" - \"Open in..\" and select Files. If the file is already stored on a cloud, you can also use the Files app itself to move mind maps.\n\nThis can happen when SimpleMind was not installed via the Google Play Store. For example, you used another app/store to install SimpleMind.\n\nThe only way to fix this is to install SimpleMind directly in the Google Play Store. First make a back-up of your local mind maps (if you have any). Remove the app and install again from the Google Play Store.\n\nNote! If you use SimpleMind Lite, it is not possible to make a back-up. Deleting SimpleMind will also delete your mind maps.\n\nThere have been several cases where using the key to switch IME (Kanji key) causes problems, including crash of Windows own Metro app.\n\nOur Japanese customers tried the steps in this article (external link, not associated with us) and that fixed the problem. Should you prefer to google, we recommend using the search term \"Windows crash IME switch”.\n\nWe hope this helps you as well.\n\n---\n\nIME（漢字キー）を切り替えるキーを使用すると、Windows 独自の Metro アプリがクラッシュするなどの問題が発生するケースがいくつかあります。\n\n日本のお客様は、この記事の手順を試しました (外部リンク、当社とは関係ありません)。 そしてそれは問題を解決しました。 Google で検索する場合は、「Windows クラッシュ IME スイッチ」という検索語を使用することをお勧めします。\n\nこれがお役に立てば幸いです。"
