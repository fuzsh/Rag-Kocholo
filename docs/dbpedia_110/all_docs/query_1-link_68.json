        "text": "Something you'll want to do quite often when building a prototype is to allow a user to type input into a text field. ProtoPie makes it really easy to do this. In this tutorial, you'll see just how easy it is to allow your users to type in some text and to do something with it.\n\nOverview\n\nWhat you'll need\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow to prototype an interactive text field\n\nStep 1: Add a text input box\n\nStep 2: Customize the input box\n\nStep 3: Preview on your device\n\nStep 4: Add Interaction\n\nStep 5: Preview again!\n\nThat's it! Easy as banana cream pie!\n\nLearn more about interactive text input fields\n\nExplore more prototyping lessons\n\nWhat you'll need\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial, download this sample Pie and open it in Studio.\n\nWe'll also preview the experience as we go directly on our device. In order to do this, you'll need to install the ProtoPie Player app on your phone or tablet. ProtoPie Player is a powerful and free app that allows you or anyone you share your Pie with to run your prototype on their device as if it were a native mobile experience.\n\niOS\n\nAndroid\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll have learned how to:\n\nAdd a text input box to your Pie (prototype)\n\nCustomize the text input box\n\nReact to your user pressing the keyboard's return key to signify they are done typing\n\nBuild and call a web URL - this will be sneak preview of an advanced ProtoPie feature called Formulas, which we'll be covering in more detail in the next article.\n\nPreview the experience on your device\n\nTime to complete: â¤15 minutes\n\nHow to prototype interactive text fields\n\nTo learn how to create dynamic text input fields, check out the video tutorial or follow the detailed step-by-step guide below.\n\nStep 1: Add a text input box\n\nOpen the example Pie file. It has a single background image layer that looks like Google's image search UI.\n\nLook for the Text menu item in the top-left set of icons. Click it and choose Input.\n\nDrag to draw your input field anywhere you like on stage.\n\nWe'd like the input box to be perfectly sized inside the pill shape in the background.\n\nLet's rename the text box to be something more meaningful. Double-click the layer, and name it Search. It will be important later that this is named exactly Search (case-sensitive) so if you've instead just named it search with a lower case s or anything other than Search, fix this now.\n\nStep 2: Customize the input box\n\nWe'd like the input box to look seamless against the background. Remove the grey background color from the text box by unchecking the box beside Fill in the properties panel.\n\nCurrently, the text box has the phrase \"placeholder\" as its placeholder text. You can change it in the properties panel in the PlaceHolder section. Change it to read search for images.\n\nð¡ Pro-tip: You can change the color and opacity of the placeholder text here as well.\n\nThere are more customization options at out disposal. For example, you can choose what kind of keyboard the will appear when you focus the field, and whether the input box should be a password field.\n\nChoosing Text, URL, Email, or Number will tailor the keyboard to the particular type of information you'd like to capture. For example, if you choose Number, a numeric keypad will appear when you focus the field. Choosing either of the password options will mask the entered text instead of displaying the characters as typed.\n\nIn our case we're capturing a search term. So let's choose Text for Type.\n\nThe second option we have under Keyboard Options is what the label Return key has on on-screen keyboard.\n\nLastly if you're designing for iOS, you can choose whether you'd like the light or the dark theme.\n\nStep 3: Preview on your device\n\nIn the Studio Preview, click on the text box. You should see the on-screen keyboard appear. Your first instinct might be to click on the keyboard keys in order to type some input. If you try it, you'll see that doesn't work. That just causes the text box to lose focus, hiding the keyboard.\n\nWhen you preview text entry in Studio on your desktop computer, you need to type with your physical keyboard. The on-screen keyboard is just a placeholder image in Studio.\n\nLet's instead run this on our device so we can type on the keyboard directly. We're going to use the ProtoPie Player app on our device to do so. If you haven't done so already, install ProtoPie Player on your device using the links you'll find above in the What you'll need section.\n\nIn Studio click Device in the set of top-right icons. This will reveal a QR code. Leave this visible, as we're going to need it in a moment.\n\nOn your device, start the ProtoPie Player app. You'll be greeted with this screen:\n\nClick Scan QR Code and scan the code you revealed above. Your Pie should now start on your device.\n\nð¡ NOTE: For this to work your device needs to either be on the same WiFi as the computer running Studio, or your device needs to be connected to the computer running Studio with a USB cable. If your Pie won't start on your device, double check that your phone is connected in one of these two ways.\n\nTap on the text box on your device. A real keyboard will be displayed that you can type on. You'll either see a native iOS or Android keyboard depending on the device you're using.\n\nStep 4: Add Interaction\n\nWe'd like our experience to take action once the user has tapped the Search key in the keyboard, signifying they are done typing (Remember in step 2 we changed the label for the Return key to be Search). We're going to use the Return Trigger to take action when this happens.\n\nIn Studio, add a Return Trigger. In the properties panel, configure it to be associated with the Search input layer.\n\nAny Responses you add underneath this Trigger will fire when the user taps the Return (i.e., Search) button when the Input Layer has focus.\n\nThis next little bit might seem cryptic. We're going to use one of ProtoPie's advanced features called Formulas in order to build a URL and send it to a browser. Don't worry if this looks completely foreign to you. We're going to go into much more detail on Formulas in the next article. For now, just follow along step-by-step.\n\nAdd a Link Response. A Link Response can be used to open a web browser tab to a specific URL.\n\nWe'd like to build a dynamic URL using the input the user has typed in order to execute a Google Image Search. Since we don't know what the user has typed until the press Return, we need to build it on the fly. For this we will use a Formula. In the list under Link, choose Formula.\n\nWhen you click the box below this drop down, you will see a little â«x icon. This means you can create a formula for the link's URL!\n\nClick the â«x icon. The field will expand, giving you more space to type.\n\nType exactly (including the quotations marks) or copy and paste the following text into the formula field:\n\n\"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" + `Search`.text + \"&tbm=isch\"\n\nBefore we move on, I'll offer a bit more of an explanation as to what we just did. Whenever you type into an input box, the value of whatever you typed is stored in a property of that layer called text. We created the formula by joining together three bits of text:\n\na bit of known text â this part is always the same: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=\"\n\na bit of unknown text â the text property of the Search input box: `Search`.text\n\nanother bit of known text â again, always the same: \"&tbm=isch\"\n\nð¡ NOTE: Remember in the first step where we named the input layer exactly Search ? In our formula we accessed the Search layer directly by name. Layer names are case-sensitive when you use them in this manner.\n\nAgain, don't worry if this looks complicated. We're going to cover Formulas in more depth in the next article. The important takeaway here is that whatever your user has typed into the input box is stored as a property of that layer and available for use in your Pie.\n\nStep 5: Preview again!\n\nTo update your device with the latest changes, click Run in the top-right group of icons.\n\nYou should now be able to execute an image search. Type whatever you'd like to search for, then tap Search.\n\nYou'll notice that when you executed your search, your device switched to your browser app in order to display the results. If you're using iOS there's one more tweak you can make.\n\nClick the Link Response under the Return Trigger.\n\nIn the properties panel, check Open In-app Browser.\n\nClick Run once more to reload update your device with the latest change. When you execute your search, your browser tab will open within the ProtoPie Player app, and you can tap Done to return to your Search box.\n\nThat's it! Easy as banana cream Pie!\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned all about text input fields and how you can configure them. You also learned that it's possible to use whatever your user has typed by accessing the text property of the Input Layer. Lastly, you got a taste of the power of Formulas â one of ProtoPie's advanced features.
