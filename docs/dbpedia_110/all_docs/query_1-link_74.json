        "text": "Among the social media titans on the market today, YouTube is the vanguard platform. It’s been around since 2005, long before Facebook gained serious momentum, and it is still an essential part of any social media advertising mix.\n\nAn important step for success in YouTube advertising is to craft an ad with the correct YouTube ad specifications.\n\nBy using the correct YouTube ad specs this 2024, you will deliver a much clearer message to your audience. A well-composed video could go viral and launch your brand’s recognition into the stratosphere.\n\nRemember to optimize your YouTube advertising by also adjusting the content to suit the online viewer preferences (Does you audience watch videos on desktop or mobile?).\n\nTo help you with your 2024 YouTube advertising, we’ve outlined YouTube’s ad specifications below.\n\nTypes of YouTube ads\n\nOverlay ads\n\nSponsored cards\n\nBumper ads\n\nStandard display ads\n\nTrueView video discovery ads (now Video Action campaign)\n\nTrueView in-stream non-skippable ads\n\nTrueView in-stream skippable ads\n\nVideo View Campaign Skippable in-stream\n\nVideo View Campaign In-feed\n\nVideo View Campaign Shorts placement\n\nOverlay ads\n\nAs of April 6, 2023, Overlay ads have been discontinued in YouTube. Active overlay ads will only appear on desktop view as YouTube Creators shift to newer ad formats for YouTube advertising.\n\nOverlay image: required\n\nUnit: 480 pixels by 70 pixels\n\nFile type: static GIF, PNG, JPG\n\nFile size: 150KB\n\nCompanion banner: optional\n\nUnit: 300 pixels by 250 pixels\n\nFile type: GIF, PNG, JPG\n\nFile size: 150KB\n\nThink of discovery ads as an online billboards of sorts. These are generally static images or have very minimal movement and animation to them. They appear either to the side of the video or as an overlay on the bottom of the video. They’re good to include in your YouTube advertising mix because they’re less expensive than other ad forms like those that appear before or during videos.\n\nSince they don’t directly interfere with user activity on the site, users might also respond better to their presence. A potential drawback could be that some users have a tendency to tune out these kinds of ads, but a truly great ad can break through the clutter. Whatever size or format you choose is up to you, just make sure that the content is optimized for the ad format and that there is a clear call-to-action for consumers to respond to.\n\nPlatform: Desktop and mobile devices\n\nMedia: image\n\nFormat: JPG, PNG, GIF\n\nAspect Ratio: 1:1\n\nLength: 15 or 20 seconds\n\nFile Size: 2MB max\n\nSponsored card works as a brief “teaser”, which will be replaced by a card icon after a few seconds. Appearing in the upper right-hand corner of the video they are currently watching, the icon gives users the choice of clicking through to access further information about the sponsored content.\n\nIn that sense, a sponsored card ad is similar to display ads except where it’s located and how it functions differs slightly. The commonality among them is the ever critical call-to-action.\n\nBumper ads\n\nAssets overview\n\nWhere they appear: YouTube videos and video partner sites and apps on the display network\n\nCompanion: 300 pixels by 60 pixels .jpg, static .gif or .png; 300 pixels by 250 pixels video wall will show on YouTube if no companion ad is provided\n\nMaximum file size: 150KB\n\nVideo ad settings\n\nFile format: AVI, ASF, Quicktime, Windows Media, MP4 or MPEG\n\nPreferred video codec: H.264, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4\n\nPreferred audio codec: MP3 or AAC\n\nResolution: 640 pixels by 360 pixels or 480 pixels by 360 pixels recommended\n\nFrame rate: 30 FPS\n\nAspect ratio: native aspect ratio without letter-boxing (examples: 4:3, 16:9)\n\nMaximum file size: 1GB\n\nLength: 6 seconds\n\nA bumper ad is a non-skippable video ad format created to extend the reach of a campaign. It appears before the video the user has chosen to view. Sold on a CPM basis, Bumper ads perform well on mobile devices. In alignment with the 2024 YouTube ad specs, the maximum video length for bumper ads is 6 seconds.\n\nStandard display ads\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nDimensions:\n\n300 pixels by 250 pixels\n\n300 pixels by 60 pixels (YouTube Reserve companions)\n\n300 pixels by 600 pixels (Zagat only)\n\nFormats: GIF, JPG, PNG\n\nMaximum file size: 150KB\n\nMaximum animation time: 30 seconds (all animations, including loops, must stop at 30 seconds)\n\nAudio: no sound\n\nBorder: creatives with partially black or white backgrounds must have a visible border of a contrasting color\n\nTrueView video discovery ads (now Video Action campaign)\n\nTrueView in-stream non-skippable ads\n\nScheduled to be eliminated in 2018, these ads play in the video player and last anywhere from 15, 20 to 30 seconds in length.
