        "text": "Message types\n\nThere are two types of messages when using WhatsApp for business communications: templates and free-form messages. The type you use depends on who initiates the chat and the time frame of the conversation.\n\nTemplates - Preformatted messages approved by Meta.\n\nFree-form - Standard free-flowing messages that support all media types\n\nThe message type depends on who initiates the conversation and is it within the messaging window. Regulation dictates that you must stick to preapproved message templates when messaging customers outside of window.\n\nMessage templates\n\nMessage templates ensure that business-initiated communication follows WhatsApp guidelines. They contain predefined text and are preformatted. These templates can be reused when the same message needs to be sent multiple times.\n\nWhen you send a message template, you can send the template identifier (template name) instead of the message content.\n\nTemplates can contain placeholders. When you send the template message, you can replace the placeholders with values or personalized information.\n\nTemplate headers can contain media that provide additional information. You can also make interactive templates by registering buttons as part of the message.\n\nMessage templates can be classified into three categories to facilitate different types of business-initiated interactions: Marketing, Utility, and Authentication template. Each category serves distinct purposes and includes various subcategories to cater to specific communication needs.\n\n1. Marketing template\n\nDesigned for business-initiated interactions to promote products or services to end users who have opted in. These templates are used to send relevant offers, announcements, and other promotional content. Any business-initiated conversation that is not authentication or utility falls under this category.\n\nSubcategories:\n\nText and rich media template: Includes plain text messages and those enhanced with images, videos, or other multimedia elements to engage users.\n\nCarousel template: Allows businesses to showcase multiple products or services in a single message, enabling users to browse different options by swiping.\n\nLimited-time offer template: Designed for promotions available for a short period, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging quick action from recipients.\n\nCoupon code template: Used to send discount codes or special offers to users, encouraging them to make a purchase or take advantage of a deal.\n\nFlow template: Guides users through a series of steps or processes, such as signing up for a service or completing a survey.\n\nMulti-product message template: Enables businesses to showcase multiple products, each with titles and product IDs, and includes optional thumbnail images. The template supports clickable buttons for user interaction and optional URL management features like shortening and tracking. Available only via WhatsApp API (opens in a new tab).\n\nCatalog template: Allows businesses to send messages featuring a product catalog with clickable buttons for user interaction and includes optional thumbnail images. It supports URL management features like shortening and tracking. Available only via WhatsApp API (opens in a new tab).\n\nTo send catalog template messages, you must enable commerce settings in your WhatsApp Manager:\n\nGo to WhatsApp Manager on Meta.\n\nUnder Account Tools, find Catalog and click on it.\n\nSelect the business phone number.\n\nEnable both options:\n\nShow catalog icon in chat header\n\nShow \"Add to cart\" button on product pages and chat\n\n2. Utility template\n\nUtility templates facilitate business-initiated conversations related to transactions, such as post-purchase notifications and recurring billing statements. These messages are typically event-triggered, allowing businesses to follow up on end user actions or requests. Utility message types must include specifics about the active or ongoing transaction, account, subscription, or interaction to which they relate.\n\nUse cases:\n\nInvoice delivery and reminders\n\nPayment updates\n\nAlerts\n\nAccount updates\n\nOrder/shipping updates\n\nSubcategories:\n\nText and rich media template: Similar to marketing templates, these can include plain text and multimedia elements to provide detailed transactional information.\n\nCarousel template: Useful for presenting multiple updates or information in a swipeable format.\n\nFlow template: Helps guide users through processes related to their transactions, such as tracking an order or updating account details.\n\n3. Authentication template\n\nAuthentication templates support business-initiated conversations that facilitate user authentication through one-time passcodes. These templates are essential for various steps in the login process, and ensure secure and verified access to user accounts and services.\n\nUse cases:\n\nAccount registration\n\nAccount recovery\n\nSecurity checks\n\nMessage templates include the following sections:\n\nHeader\n\nBody\n\nFooter\n\nButtons\n\nCards (check Carousel template)\n\nThe first step in sending notifications is to create and register your message templates and then submit the templates to Meta for approval.\n\nMake sure you are familiar with the template guidelines, as well as the limitations below.\n\nTemplate names can contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). They cannot contain other characters or white space.\n\nHeader\n\nHeaders are optional.

Buttons are interactive components which enable users to quickly select options and perform actions.\n\nQuick reply button\n\nProvides customers with predefined responses they can send with a single tap.\n\nYou can add up to 10 quick reply buttons per template.\n\nCan contain a maximum of 25 characters.\n\nCall button\n\nAllows customers to call a specified business phone number directly from the chat.\n\nOnly one call button is allowed per template.\n\nThe phone number can contain a maximum of 20 characters and must be in the international format starting with a plus sign (+).\n\nClick to URL\n\nLets customers open a specified URL in their web browser.\n\nYou can add up to two URL buttons per template.\n\nThe text for each URL button can contain a maximum of 25 characters, while the URL itself can be up to 2,000 characters long. The URL can include a single placeholder at the end.\n\nCopy code\n\nAllows customers to copy a code, such as a coupon code, to the clipboard with a single click.\n\nThe text for each copy code button can contain a maximum of 25 characters.\n\nText and rich media template\n\nSend single text-only or rich media messages with buttons.\n\nClassified as a Marketing or a Utility template.\n\nCarousel template\n\nSend a message with up to 10 carousel cards, text, and buttons.\n\nYou can define media (image or video) and button types for all your cards.\n\nClassified as a Marketing or a Utility template.\n\nCan be created via the template editor or WhatsApp API (opens in a new tab).\n\nLimited time offer template\n\nSend time-bound offers with expiration dates for offer codes.\n\nYou can define the offer heading, expiration date, and button types.\n\nClassified as a Marketing template.\n\nCan be created via the template editor or WhatsApp API (opens in a new tab).\n\nCoupon code template\n\nSend discount codes with a button to quickly copy the code.\n\nYou can add a button to copy the code.

For this to work, you must enter Android app's package name and signature hash.\n\nTo use an authentication template for the authentication copy code button via WhatsApp API (opens in a new tab), you must set the button type as URL with the authentication code value as the parameter (if you create the template through our template editor, the URL will automatically be set as the button type). Here is an example:\n\nTemplate registration\n\nLog in to Infobip (opens in a new tab) and select Channels and Numbers > Channels.\n\nSelect WhatsApp.\n\nSelect the Senders tab.\n\nFor the desired sender, select three dots menu.\n\nSelect Manage templates.\n\nClick Register template.\n\nChoose the template category: Marketing, Utility, or Authentication.
