If the data is produced in a PDF from a form with proper validation, this usually is not a problem. If the data is not in that format for a minority of cases, you can always do a quick check (\"Test Regex Match\" action) to see if the Regex pattern matches and throw an exception if it doesn't.\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nSearch Pattern:\n\n(.*)[\\r\\n]+(.*)[\\r\\n]+(.*)[\\r\\n]+(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})[\\r\\n]+([\\d\\s]*?)[\\r\\n]+.*?[\\r\\n]+(.+)\\s(\\S+)[\\r\\n]+(.*)\\s(.*)\\s(\\S+)[\\r\\n]+(.*\\@.*\\..*)[\\r\\n]+.*?[\\r\\n]+.*?[\\r\\n]+(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})​\n\n​Replacement Pattern:\n\nSignature: $1\n\nFirst Name: $2\n\nLast Name: $3\n\nDate: $4\n\nEmployee ID: $5\n\nAddress: $6\n\nPhone No: $7\n\nCity: $8\n\nState: $9\n\nZip Code: $10\n\nEmail: $11\n\nSeparation Date: $12\n\n​\n\n------------------------------\n\nMicheal Charron\n\nSenior Manager\n\nRBC\n\nAmerica/Toronto\n\n------------------------------\n\nMicheal Charron\n\nRBC\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nCanada"
