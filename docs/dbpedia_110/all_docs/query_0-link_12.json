Works well with the ‘Highly editable (with layout)’ layout option.\n\nAnchor to Page: An image will be anchored to a fixed location within the exported page, to precisely match the location of the image within the PDF page. Works well with the ‘Precisely laid out’ layout option.\n\nConvert in-line images only: Only images placed between words and on the same baseline as line of text will be converted. Other images will not be converted.\n\nConversion | Word & Rich Text Page layout\n\nHighly editable (with layout): This option produces a file that is moderately editable, while still retaining the look-and-feel of the original PDF. Text formatting, graphics, and paragraphs are all recovered, and the output file is laid out in columns to maintain visual accuracy.\n\nHighly editable (single column): This option produces a file that is ideal for making major structural or layout changes to the document.

Nitro Pro is able to utilize a timestamp server to help ensure that the timestamp is precise and secure, since the system clock could be modified by a user.\n\nForms\n\nAutomatically calculate field values: A PDF form containing many complex and interdependent form calculations can affect how well a PDF viewer performs. If you use this kind of form regularly, or know you’re about to fill in such a form, consider turning off this preference\n\nHighlight form fields: A PDF form can be difficult for people to use as it is not always visibly clear what areas of the file must be filled in.

A fixed threshold applies the same cut-off point to the entire image, as opposed to finding the text dynamically. The percentage values indicate the point at which the contrast between blacks and whites is ideal to recognize text, with 0% being completely dark and 100% being completely white. This setting is recommended if an image contains different background colors, or a background which varies in shading or gradient.
