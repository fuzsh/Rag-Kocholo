        "text": "1. Bloch\n\nThese professional dance shoes are reasonably priced and serve beginners and more experienced dancers alike. The comfortable character shoes come in soft black or tan leather, and most actors opt for a T-strap and a two-and-a-half to three-inch heel. If you’re looking for an affordable alternative to the ultra-popular (and pricey!) LaDucas, Bloch’s split flex shoes have a similar look and a highly danceable flexible sole.\n\n2. Capezio\n\nBeginner dancers (and those on a budget) should not discount this expansive brand. Capezio offers a wide variety of ballet, jazz, tap, and character shoes in classic styles, and its footwear is far more affordable (and widely distributed) than the high-end competition. The Manhattan is straightforward and sturdy, and can easily be outfitted with taps. Strong dancers craving flexible soles can try the Cassie or Charlotte shoes for an elegant look and lots of bendability.\n\n3. LaDuca\n\nThey’re considered the Rolls Royce of dance shoes for a reason. Serious performers choose these pricey Italian leather heels, which are designed “by a dancer, for a dancer.” Popular styles for women include the Alexis, featuring an elegant Y-strap, or the Elizabeth, featuring crisscross straps across the arch of the foot. Both styles come in nude or black, and actors can choose two-and-a-half or three-inch heels. Pro tip: East Coast actors should make the pilgrimage to the LaDuca store in Manhattan to try on a few pairs and find the perfect fit.\n\n4. Miller & Ben\n\nThis esteemed company, founded by tap dancers/teachers Avi Miller and Ofer Ben, started in Israel before relocating to New York City’s Tap Emporium in the early aughts. Dubbed “musical tap instruments,” Miller & Ben shoes are hand-crafted, comfy, and ultra-attractive, designed with the performer in mind. The premium shoes can be found worldwide and come in a variety of styles and colors, including the Jazz-Tap Master and the (gorgeous) La Coquette.\n\n5. Só Dança"
