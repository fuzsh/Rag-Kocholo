Whether you create an IT request form, project intake Form, HR Form, feedback Form - if you want to gather information, a Form will help to streamline the process. Check out our course on how to Build and Distribute Successful Forms in ClickUp University.\n\nWhat you'll need\n\nYou need a paid plan to use Form view.\n\nEveryone, including guests with edit or full permissions, can create Form views.\n\nAnyone with a link to the Form can submit responses to it. They don't need to be a guest or member.\n\nCreate a Form view\n\nThe easiest way to create a Form view is in the Sidebar. This will create a new List called Form and set the Form as the default view.\n\nTo create a Form view:\n\nClick the ellipsis ... or the Create new + icon beside the Space you want to add the Form view to.\n\nSelect Create new, then Form.\n\nYour new Form opens.\n\nThe Form is added as a List view, a List in the Sidebar, and a Form view.\n\nGive your Form a name and description.\n\nRenaming a Custom Field's title on a Form view only impacts the public view and won't rename the Custom Field within your task.\n\nDrag and drop fields from the left panel to add them to your Form. You can rename any field by clicking its title.\n\nBy default, your Form is immediately publicly sharable. To disable public sharing, and close the Form, click the Active toggle in the upper-right corner.\n\nYou can also click + View on the Views Bar to create Form view.\n\nUse the responses button in the top left to open the List where the Forms are submitted.\n\nSupported Field Types\n\nForm views can use Task fields and new or existing Custom Fields anywhere in your Workspace. Once a new Custom Field is added to a Form, it is automatically added to the Space, Folder, or List where the Form view lives.\n\nIf you add a Form view on the Space or Folder level, the Custom Fields for that Form will be taken from the Space or Folder along with the List where the task is being made.\n\nThe following field types are supported:\n\nTask Fields Custom Fields\n\nTask Name\n\nTask Description\n\nPriority\n\nStart Date\n\nDue Date\n\nAttachment\n\nTime Estimate\n\nAssignee\n\nSprint Points\n\nTags\n\nStatus\n\nText\n\nLong Text\n\nWebsite\n\nDropdown\n\nEmail\n\nPhone\n\nDate\n\nCheckbox\n\nNumber\n\nMoney\n\nLabels\n\nRating\n\nLocation\n\nFiles\n\nPeople\n\nProgress (manual)\n\nVoting\n\nSignature\n\nSignature Custom Fields are in beta.\n\nIf a Task Name is not included in the Form view, the task name will default to Form Submission - #ZULU TIME. For example: Form Submission - #2021-10-22T19:06:34Z\n\nSubmitting a Form\n\nWhen a Form is submitted, it creates a task in the location where the Form view was added. If the Form is created at the List level, all Form submissions will appear as tasks in that List.\n\nIf the Form view is added at the Space or Folder level, you can select the List you would like the tasks added to during view creation.\n\nField Options\n\nYou can customize your Form submissions with additional options. Add hidden fields, automatically assign submissions to someone in your Workspace, or even add your own company branding.\n\nAfter you add a Field to a Form, click the ellipsis ... in the upper-right corner to see the Form options:\n\nField options vary by Field type.\n\nHidden Fields: If you already know your respondent's name, email, or other information, you can use a hidden field, to pre-fill your Form. This means respondents can skip filling out this information!\n\nAdd Form Label/Response to Task Description: Include a label or response information from your Form in the task description! This can be helpful for searching, as well as for handling a high volume of Forms when you need to merge similar requests together.\n\nWhen a Form is submitted anonymously and assign tasks to is applied, the task activity will show ClickBot (Automations) assigned to: [name of the user selected]. To remove this auto assignee function, use the Form settings.\n\nForm options\n\nForm options are only available on the Business Plus Plan or above.\n\nCustomize your Form options by clicking the cog icon in the upper-right corner.\n\nForm options include:\n\nForm option Description Avatar Click the ClickUp logo at the top of the Form to customize the avatar. Images can be up to 1GB in size and will be automatically scaled to fit the Form. Assign tasks to Choose the default Assignees for each Form submission. Use template to create task Any fields on the Form will be updated or replaced with the Custom Field values of the template that you choose. Redirect URL Instead of showing the response message, redirect the person filling out your Form to another URL.\n\nEmbedded Forms do not support Redirect URL.\n\nPrimary color\n\nChoose which color you want your buttons to be.\n\nFor ClickUp 3.0, we updated the available theme colors to make ClickUp more accessible and user-friendly.\n\nClickUp branding\n\nHide ClickUp branding on your Forms.\n\nAdd Custom Field answers to the description of task\n\nInclude all responses in a submitted Form's task description.\n\nKeep fields full width\n\nChoose to always display fields the full width of the Form.\n\nAdd reCAPTCHA to Form\n\nProtect your Form from fraud and abuse by including reCAPTCHA for submissions.\n\nShow link to submit another response\n\nInclude a link to Submit another answer on the Form submission confirmation page so users can easily submit multiple responses to the same Form.\n\nEdit the Form response\n\nUsers on the Business Plus Plan and above can edit the Form response.\n\nTo edit the response:\n\nClick Editing at the top of the Form.\n\nClick Response message at the bottom of the Form.\n\nClick into the message and begin typing to update the response.\n\nUse logic in Forms\n\nOn our Enterprise plan, you can use rules and conditions to add dynamic logic to your Form. Logic is used to guide Form submissions and capture more specific information.\n\nFor example, you can create a rule that automatically shows a Due Date field if an Urgent priority is selected. Rules for individual answers on a field won't appear in the Form if that Custom Field allows a combination of answers.\n\nTo add logic to a Form:\n\nAdd a new field to a Form or find an existing available field to add logic to. A top-level field like this is called a Decision Field.\n\nEnable Logic by clicking the toggle on.\n\nTo add a rule, first use the dropdown to set an If condition. Create multiple conditions by clicking + Add condition. You can add up to 25 rules per Decision Field.\n\nThen, click + Add field to create a Conditional Field. This is the action taken when the If condition is met. You can add multiple Conditional Fields.\n\nAvailable fields\n\nYou can add logic to the following Form fields:\n\nPriority\n\nDropdown\n\nLabel\n\nStatus\n\nCheckbox\n\nPeople\n\nAssignee\n\nPreview a Form\n\nTo see how your Form will look when it's active, you can toggle between Editing and Viewing modes at the top of the Form. You can even submit Form responses from the preview mode to test your Form.\n\nSubmit Forms on mobile\n\nForms can now be submitted or shared using the ClickUp mobile app! You can tap a Form view from the Views modal to submit a Form response or share its URL from the mobile app.\n\nForm views cannot be created or edited from inside the mobile app.\n\nShare, embed, and export Forms\n\nYou can share or embed your Form, or export all of your responses as a CSV file."
