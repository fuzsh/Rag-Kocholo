        "text": "Pose Creation via Action Editor#\n\nTo create a pose in the library from the Action Editor, pose the character, select the relevant bones, and click the Create Pose Asset button. This will create the new pose Action, which will contain keys for the current value of each boneâs location, rotation, scale, and Bendy Bone properties.\n\nThe created Action is now assigned to the armature. This makes it possible to inspect which bones are included and to tweak anything. In that respect, itâs an Action like any other, and you can add or remove keys as usual. Just make sure that the keys are all on the same frame, in order to keep this a âposeâ instead of an âanimation snippetâ; the latter isnât supported at the moment.\n\nTrue to its name, the Create Pose Asset button automatically marks the Action as Asset. Not only does this make it available in the pose library, it will also act as a fake user to ensure the Action isnât lost after you unassign it from the armature.\n\nThe pose asset can be renamed in the Asset Browser. There you can also right click on the thumbnail, then choose Assign Action to assign the Action to the active Object (see description above)."
