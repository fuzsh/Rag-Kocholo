This guide covers guidelines to follow when sending and receiving media messages through WhatsApp to ensure a smooth experience with your customers.\n\nMedia Content Types\n\nmedia-content-types page anchor\n\nTo send a WhatsApp media message, you must specify the MediaUrl parameter when making a request to the Twilio API for WhatsApp. Twilio checks the content-type header at the provided MediaUrl to validate the content type(link takes you to an external page) of the media file. If the content-type header does not match that of the media file, Twilio rejects the request.\n\nMessage Size Limits\n\nmessage-size-limits page anchor\n\nWhen you send an outbound WhatsApp message, the total message size must be under the maximum size limit for the channel. An API request with media or a collection of media larger than the size limit will fail with an error.\n\nFor a WhatsApp message, the maximum size limit is 16MB. Please note that the size limit for images is only 5 MB.\n\nFilenames and Captions\n\nfilenames-and-captions page anchor\n\nCurrently, Twilio does not support setting a filename or caption for documents that are send as media messages over WhatsApp.\n\nSupported MIME Types\n\nsupported-mime-types page anchor\n\nThe Twilio API for WhatsApp supports sending and receiving images, audio, PDF files, and video. The following formats are currently supported:\n\nImages: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP*\n\nAudio: OGG**, AMR, 3GP, AAC, MPEG\n\nDocuments: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX\n\nVideo: MP4 (with H.264 video codec and AAC audio)\n\nContacts: vCard (.vcf)\n\n* Please note the following:\n\n*The image/webp MIME type is only used for WhatsApp stickers, which have additional requirements. See support article(link takes you to an external page) for more details.\n\n**WhatsApp outbound OGG is only supported when the OGG file uses the opus audio codec. These files may have the .ogg or the .opus extension."
