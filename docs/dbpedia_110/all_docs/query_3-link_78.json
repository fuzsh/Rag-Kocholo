        "meta_description": "[Base64.ai](https://Base64.ai) API extracts text, tables, photos, and signatures from all document types.\n\nOur AI technology runs in the cloud (online) and on air-gapped, on-premises, offline datacenters. This document covers the online cloud API that supports a broader spectrum of documents.\n\nFor feedback and questions, please contact [support@base64.ai](https://mailto:support@base64.ai). The latest version of this document is always available online at [https://base64.ai/api/doc](https://base64.ai/api/doc).\n\n[Self-help Website](https://help.base64.ai) contains many valuable resources and tutorials. Also check our [YouTube](https://base64.ai/youtube) regularly for new educational content.\n\n# 1\\. Standards\n\n## 1.1. Transport security\n\nThe connection must be over HTTPS and TLS 1.2+.\n\n## 1.2. Authentication &amp; authorization\n\nThe API requires a `Authorization` header, and its value should be in `ApiKey email:secret` format. The `email` is your login email at [https://Base64.ai website](https://Base64.ai). The `secret` is the API Key that you can find on the [Integrations page](https://Base64.ai/integrations) on the Base64.ai website.\n\n## 1.3. Supported file formats\n\nThe following file formats are supported:\n\n- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, SVG, WEBP, TIFF  \n- Microsoft Office: DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX  \n- Open Office: ODS, ODT, ODP  \n- PDF: Both digital and image-only files are supported. PDFs may be single or multi-page and may contain multiple document types (e.g., 3 ID pages plus 1 invoice).  \n- ZIP: May only contain the supported file formats  \n- MSG: Outlook message files and the contents within (e.g., email's PDFs attachments)  \n- Audio: MP3, OGG, FLAC, WAV  \n- Video: MOV, MP4, AVI, WMV, M4V  \n- Text: CSV\n\nYou may send the document's mime type and binary in Base64 encoding:\n\n- `{\"document\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJR...\"}` for a JPEG or\n- `{\"document\":\"data:application/pdf;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJR...\"}` for a PDF\n    \n\nor simply provide the URL of the document:\n\n- `{\"url\":\"https://base64.ai/static/content/features/data-extraction/models/1.png\"}`\n- `{\"url\":\"https://base64.ai/static/content/features/data-extraction/models/health/sbc/1.pdf\"}`\n    \n\n`Content-Type: application/json` header is always required. Password-protected files are not supported.\n\n## 1.4. Error handling\n\nThe API returns standard [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), which are `200` for success, `401` for invalid authentication, `402` for lack of payment, `403` for disabled accounts, `404` for invalid URLs, `429` for rate-limited requests, and `500` for internal errors. The error response contains a `message` attribute to communicate the problem.\n\n## 1.5. Limitations\n\nNo artificial intelligence system (including self-driving cars, airplane autopilots) is able to provide 100% accurate results. We recommend adding a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step for humans to verify the results. Base64.ai provides a 24/7 team to do the review on your behalf, or your teams can use [Base64.ai Flow](https://base64.ai/flow).\n\nFree accounts are limited up to 100 credits. To test without using credits, use the [Mock API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10132588/SWT5hfdz#ea06ee71-a337-4286-a2da-12754d401314).\n\nMost documents are 1 credit per page and complex documents with tables and forms can be 2-5 credits. Facial and signature AI are 1 credit per request. Please see the [Pricing Page](https://base64.ai/pricing) for details.\n\nThe total request should be under 32 MB. When using multiple documents, each document should be less than 20 MB.\n\nThe free API is rate-limited at 10 requests/second, while the paid API supports up to 1,000 requests/second. Please contact [support@base64.ai](https://mailto:support@base64.ai) for increased bandwidth.\n\n# 2\\. Document processing\n\nBase64.ai provides a single stateless [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API (`/api/scan`). The response contains the recognized document type (`model`), the data in the document (`fields`), and the confidence scores for the model and each field. P99 response time is under 1 second.\n\nBase64.ai can automatically recognize and organize the documents into categories called models. For instance, all California driver's licenses, regardless of their designs or year, are automatically classified as `driver_license/usa/ca`, which enables further processing automation scenarios on the client-side, such as asking the user to upload the driver's license again if it is not from a desired state.\n\nYou can find all supported document types on the [Model Types Page](https://base64.ai/model-types).\n\n## 2.1. Request\n\nThe request should be a JSON object. It should contain either an `document` or an `url` attribute. `document` should be in Base64 format. `url` can be any web address such as `https://base64.ai/test.png`.\n\n## 2.2. Response\n\nThe success response is an array of results with each result corresponding to a document. An example result may contain the following objects:\n\n| Object | Description | Attributes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `model` | Document type | `name`, `type`, and `confidence` |\n| `fields` | Data in the document | `key`, `value`, and `confidence` for each field |\n| `features.faces` | Faces on the document | `image` is the face in Base64 encoding, `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` of the image, and `confidence` for each face. |\n| `features.signatures` | Signatures on the document | `image` is the signature in Base64 encoding, `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` of the image, and `confidence` for each signature. |\n| `features.tables` | Tables in the document | An array of tables in the document. Each table is an array of array of cells. |\n| `features.properties` | Document attributes | `width`, and `height` of the document pages, and the calculated `rotationAngle` in degrees. |\n\n## 2.3. Features\n\n### 2.3.1. Specifying document types\n\nThe API accepts an optional `modelTypes` request parameter to specify the models on which the data extraction AI must run. It is an array where each element is a model type. Limiting `modelTypes` can increase performance by reducing the processing time and increasing accuracy. The subtypes of a model are automatically included, e.g. providing `[\"driver_license/usa\"]` adds all US driver licenses. The client may pass multiple `modelTypes` such as `[\"driver_license/usa\", \"vehicle/registration/usa\"]`. See `Supported document types` for the full list.\n\nIf you pass `[\"ocr\"]` as `modelTypes`, the API returns the full-screen OCR of the document in response.\n\n### 2.3.2. Handwriting\n\nBase64.ai has handwriting support by default. No extra configuration is needed.\n\n### 2.3.3. PDF417 barcodes\n\nPDF417 is a popular 2-dimensional barcode that is used in US driver's licenses and DMV documents of some US states, as well as in many international IDs. It contains all the data in the document in a machine-readable format.\n\n### 2.3.4. MRZ (machine-readable zone)\n\nMRZ is a popular data format used in many IDs, as well as all passports and visas worldwide, recognizable by the &lt;&lt;&lt; characters.\n\nThe MRZ model type is in `mrz/{document type}/{issuing country's 3 digit ISO code}` format such as `mrz/visa/usa` for the visas issued by the United States of America. `document_type` can be `id`, `visa` or `passport`. [Click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) for the full list of 3-digit ISO codes.\n\n### 2.3.5. Data normalization\n\nThe API normalizes dates to ISO format so the caller can ignore the format on the document.\n\n### 2.3.6. Data validation\n\nThe API runs validations on the output data as a defense against fraud and reading errors. Some fields may contain an `isValid` attribute. `true` means the check is passed, `false` means the check is failed, and not having an `isValid` attribute means no checks were run for the field.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| VIN | Matches VIN checksum |\n| ID number | Matches the issuing authority's format specs |\n| Expiration date | Is a valid date in the future |\n| Birthday | Is a valid date in the past |\n| Issue date | Is a valid date in the past |\n\n### 2.3.7. OFAC check\n\nThe OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) is a part of the United States Treasury and the group oversees determining whether a company or individual is authorized to do business in the United States. This check includes economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy. The documents in the ID category (ID, driver's license, passport, visa, etc.) and invoices are scanned against the latest OFAC database.\n\n### 2.3.8. Text-to-speech\n\nText-to-speech is an assistive technology that appends an MP3 of the reading of the document text to the request.  \nDOM is turned off by default to reduce the processing time and response size.  \nYou may pass `\"convertTextToSpeech\": true` under `settings` object in the request body [(see sample request)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10132588/SWT5hfdz#8f558313-49f0-47fc-bd23-bc94399870c6)  \nor enable it globally on your [User Settings Page](https://base64.ai/user-settings).  \nThis feature is subject to extra fee. Please see the [Pricing Page](https://base64.ai/pricing) for details.\n\n### 2.3.9. Limiting the number of pages to be processed\n\nFile formats such as PDF, TIFF, and Microsoft Office files (DOC, XLS, PPT) may contain multiple pages.  \nThe default setting is 50 to reduce the processing time and response size.  \nIf you want to limit the number of pages that will be processed to `5`, pass `\"limitPages\": 5` under `settings` object in the request body.  \nIf you only want to process the first page, use `1` instead [(see limit-pages sample request)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10132588/SWT5hfdz#8b8c0028-6312-402c-ac16-5547b5023c69).  \nIf you want to stop the processing for the documents has more than 10 pages, pass `\"maxPages\": 10` under `settings` object in the request body. [(see max-pages sample request)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10132588/SWT5hfdz#8b8c0028-6312-402c-ac16-5547b5023c69).\n\n### 2.3.10. Original file name\n\nYou can give the file name to be listed in Base64.ai  \nhuman in the loop environments as an API parameter.  \nif you want to specify the file name that will be listed  \nas `document.pdf`, pass `\"originalFileName\": \"document.pdf\"` under the request body.  \nif you don't give this parameter, the API will generate a random file name to be  \nlisted or parse the uploaded document URL if exists.\n\n### 2.3.11. Echo parameter\n\nIf you want to connect your request with the asynchronous responses, you can add an `echo` parameter to your request body and receive the same data it in the response.  \nIf your request is `{ \"url\": \"http://...\", \"echo\": \"hello\" }`, each `result` in the response will contain the `result.echo` with the corresponding value (i.e. `hello`).  \nYou can send any data type including a string, integer, array, or object (map).\n\n### 2.3.12. Integration flow\n\nFlows are no-code document understanding solutions. They are the easiest way to process your documents. Flows can read documents from any source, process all types of documents, validate the results, and integrate your data into any system. They also help you to separate API traffic across documents and business processes.  \nIf you want to use flows in your API integration, add `base64ai-flow-id` header with your flow ID as its value, which you can find on the [Flow Page](https://base64.ai/flow).\n\n### 2.3.13. Password-protected PDFs\n\nIf your PDF is password protected, you need to add the passport to settings so that our service can open the file, e.g. send `{ \"url\": \"http://...\", \"settings\": { password: \"my-secret-pwd\" } }`.\n\n### 2.3.14. Spreadsheets\n\nBase64.ai supports extracting sheets as tables from Excel files. These sheets get added to the result as a table.\n\n# 3\\. Face recognition &amp; verification\n\nBase64.ai provides a REST API (`/api/face`) to detect and match faces on 2 documents. P99 response time is under 3 seconds.\n\n## 3.1. Request\n\nThe recognition (detection) API expects 1 document, `document` parameter.\n\nThe verification (matching) API expects 2 documents, `document` and `query` parameters, where the former is the ground truth (e.g. user's official ID) and the latter is the validation document (e.g. a selfie).\n\n## 3.2. Response\n\nIf there are matching faces on both documents, the response is an array of the matches displayed as the coordinates in the `query` document. If both documents have faces, but they don't match, the response is an empty array. If one or more of the documents don't contain a face, the error is displayed in `message`. If the `document` does not have a face, `isReferenceValid` is true, if `query` does not have a face, `isReferenceValid` is false.\n\n# 4\\. Signature recognition &amp; matching\n\nBase64.ai provides a REST API (`/api/signature`) to detect and match signatures on 2 documents. P99 response time is under 3 seconds.\n\n## 4.1. Request\n\nThe recognition (detection) API expects 1 document, `document` parameter.\n\nThe verification (matching) API expects 2 documents, `document` and `query` parameters, where the former is the ground truth (e.g. user's official ID) and the latter is the validation document (e.g. a handwritten signature on a form).\n\n## 4.2. Response\n\nIf there are matching signatures on both documents, the response is an array of the matches displayed as the coordinates in the `query` document. If both documents have signatures, but they don't match, the response is an empty array. If one or more of the documents don't contain a signature, the error is displayed in `message`. If the `document` does not have a signature, `isReferenceValid` is true, if `query` does not have a signature, `isReferenceValid` is false.\n\n# 5\\.
