        "text": "This summer, an end to 100ml liquid hand luggage restrictions at some airports was set to reduce the stress of flying. Several EU and UK airports have installed the next-generation CT scanners that allow liquids of more than 100ml, and smaller containers, to remain in carry-on bags during security screening. Lifting the long-standing liquid restriction can reduce waiting times, as well as making it easier to travel with just hand luggage.\n\nHowever, the UK Government reintroduced the 100ml rule in June – and the EU is planning to reinstate it at airports across the bloc from September.\n\nThe European Commission has said that the “precautionary measure is not in response to any new threat but addresses a temporary technical issue”. In the UK, the U-turn was also blamed on technology.\n\nAir travellers also face potential disruption this summer due air traffic control pressures.\n\nWith the chance of longer waits at security, and the risk of flight delays, travellers may be tempted by a flight-free break. The trips below still have availability this summer and all come in at less than £600 per person.\n\nScheveningen, Netherlands\n\nYou might struggle to pronounce it, but getting to this Dutch seaside resort is a doddle – and you can even take your bike. Set amid the dunes along a broad sandy beach, Scheveningen has a bygone charm without being too nostalgic. There’s a pier, a Ferris wheel and trendy beach bars along the shore. A 20-minute ride inland brings you into The Hague, “the world’s best city for cycling“, home to heavyweight cultural institutions, notably Mauritshuis. Here you’ll find, among other treasures, Vermeer’s ‘Girl With a Pearl Earring’.\n\nHow to get there\n\nTake the ferry from Harwich, Essex, to Hoek van Holland (return fares around £177, including a bike; stenaline.co.uk). From there, it’s an hour’s cycle up the coast to Scheveningen. Alternatively, sail overnight from Hull to Rotterdam (return fares around £345, including a bike and a cabin each way; poferries.com). From Rotterdam, it’s about a 90-minute cycle to Scheveningen.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe modern, centrally located Fox Hotel has doubles from around £87 per night.\n\nThe Isle of Scilly\n\nA new fast ferry promised to make the Isles of Scilly feel that bit closer to the British mainland this summer – until the operator axed the service before it even started last week. No matter, because the journey can still be made in under three hours via the existing Scillonian ferry, operated by Isles of Scilly Travel. It disgorges passengers on the charming island of St Mary, home to fine sandy beaches, Bronze Age ruins and fish restaurants serving the day’s catch overlooking the sea.\n\nHow to get there\n\nFirst, get to Penzance – ideally the night before as the daily ferry leaves at 8.15am or 9.15am. If it’s the later departure, you could take the sleeper train from London, which arrives in Penzance at 7.07am (from £66 one-way, seat only; gwr.com). The ferry costs around £170 return (islesofscilly-travel.co.uk).\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Atlantic has doubles from £230 per night. Alternatively, Garrison Holidays has scenic tent pitches for £18 per night, as well as pre-erected tents for £92 per night.\n\nRoscoff, France\n\nThis petite cité de caractère – “small town of character” – is the one-time departure point for Onion Johnnies, those Breton farmers who once crossed the Channel to sell their onions in the UK. Nowadays, the ferry from Plymouth mostly just carries holidaymakers, who come for a breezy break in this genteel and picturesque town. Dominated by a grand Gothic church, Roscoff has beaches aplenty and, this being France, loads of great restaurants. There’s also a botanical garden overlooking the Atlantic.\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe overnight ferry from Plymouth departs at 10pm and docks the following morning at 8am, except Tuesdays when it leaves (and arrives) two hours earlier. There’s an additional daytime sailing on Fridays. Departures vary for the return leg, none are overnight. Round trips cost from around £287, which includes a cabin on the way out, plus a space for your bike (brittany-ferries.co.uk).\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHôtel La Résidence des Artistes has singles from around £91 per night.\n\nEigg, Scotland\n\nThere are many reasons to visit Eigg – rugged scenery, sandy beaches, hiking trails, the birdlife – but chief among them is something intangible: the island’s independent spirit. Not content with having pulled off a pioneering buyout of their island in 1997, residents also created the world’s first off-grid electric network powered by renewables. The island has its own brewery and even a record label – Lost Map Records – which puts on gigs. Little wonder Eigg is bucking the depopulation trend witnessed on other Scottish islands.\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe ferry from Mallaig on the mainland takes around 90 minutes and costs less than £10 for a return fare (calmac.co.uk). Bikes are free to take, cars are not permitted.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nLageorna B&B has doubles from £140 per night, including breakfast and Glebe Barn has doubles from £65 per night. Wild camping is legal on Eigg, providing you adhere to the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.\n\nTenby, Wales\n\nTenby’s bright pastel buildings are a welcome contrast to the slate-grey skies that hang over Pembrokeshire for much of the year. However, summer brings better weather and a chance to bask on its glorious beaches, many of which are backed by dramatic cliffs. The medieval walls still stand around Tenby, which has listed architecture aplenty, including a castle. Art galleries and the pretty medieval lanes are a welcome distraction if the weather turns.\n\nHow to get there\n\nTenby is easily reached by rail.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Dunes has doubles from around £129 per night, including breakfast.\n\nLundy, England\n\nThis chunk of granite in the Bristol Channel is only a short hop from the mainland but takes visitors back to simpler times. Renowned for its resident puffins, hiking trails and diving, Lundy even has its own pub – the Marisco Tavern – which is going strong despite the island’s diminutive population (28 souls at the last count). The Landmark Trust has a handful of interesting self-catering cottages, which have no TVs, no Wi-Fi and no electricity between midnight and 6am. If you have a novel to write, this is the place to come.\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe MS Oldenburg sails to Lundy from Bideford and Ilfracombe (journey time around two hours; returns £93). Call the Landmark Trust for tickets (01271 863636).\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Landmark Trust has various interesting places to stay on Lundy, including an old castle and a Georgian gentlemen’s villa, though most are booked up during the school holidays. There’s room aplenty at its campsite though (pitches from £15 per night; landmarktrust.org.uk).\n\n* Prices and availability correct at time of writing"
