        "text": "Invalid or blocked file types\n\nApplies to:\n\nTemporary TMP files will not be synced to OneDrive. See OneDrive status stuck on \"Sync pending\" for more details.\n\nFiles that are used by your local computer, such as desktop.ini on Windows or .ds_store on macOS, don't normally sync. If these files do get uploaded to OneDrive during a migration, the sync app will delete the cloud copy and leave the local copy.\n\nOutlook .PST files are supported, however they are synced less frequently compared to other file types to reduce network traffic. To prevent uploading .PST files from the OneDrive sync app, read Blocking syncing of specific file types. To move .PST files out of OneDrive, read How to remove an Outlook PST data file from OneDrive. If users enable PC folder backup (Known Folder Move) manually without the group policy, they will see an error if they have a .PST file in one of their known folders (e.g. Documents). If Known Folder Move is enabled and configured via group policy, .PST files will be migrated.\n\nOutlook may show errors after .PST files are migrated because it is still looking for .PST files at original location.\n\nIf you are a OneDrive for work or school user, some file types may be blocked on your organization’s SharePoint site. The list of blocked files will vary depending on your administrator.\n\nFor security reasons, a number of file names and extensions can't be uploaded since they are executable, used by SharePoint Server, or used by Windows itself. For more info, see Types of files that cannot be added to a list or library.\n\nSharing\n\nApplies to:\n\nYou can’t share this item because too many items in the folder.\n\nWhen sharing a folder, the total number of sub-items contained within it and its sub-folders is limited to 50,000.\n\nTo overcome this restriction, move some items into another folder that isn't within the original folder, or choose individual files to share.\n\nYou cannot break inheritance for this item because there are too many items with unique permissions in this list or library.\n\nThe supported limit of unique permissions for items in a list or library is 50,000. However, the recommended general limit is 5,000. Making changes to more than 5,000 uniquely permitted items at a time takes longer. Therefore, for large lists, design the list to have as few unique permissions as possible.\n\nShared with me\n\nYou can't synchronize the Shared with me view grouping of files from a OneDrive for work or school site.\n\nDelivery has failed to these recipients or groups error when sharing\n\nYou may receive this error message when trying to share to an address that is not associated with a Microsoft account.\n\nOneNote notebooks\n\nApplies to:\n\nOneNote notebooks have their own sync mechanism outside of OneDrive. If you plan on sharing a OneNote notebook—with yourself or others—it's best to create it on OneDrive right from the start. Moving an existing OneNote notebook into a folder synced by OneDrive without going through the OneNote application isn't currently supported.\n\nOnce a OneNote notebook is saved in OneDrive, if you are syncing the folder that contains the notebook, you will find a stub .url file, which will open the notebook on the website.\n\nOneNote notebooks saved in OneDrive or SharePoint are limited to 2GB.\n\nRead how to Move a OneNote notebook to OneDrive.\n\nFile name and path lengths\n\nApplies to:\n\nDifferent apps and Office versions have different limits, and the combination of limitations may be unique to your setup.\n\nThe entire decoded file path, including the file name, can't contain more than 400 characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for work or school and SharePoint in Microsoft 365. The limit applies to the combination of the folder path and file name after decoding.\n\nFor example, if the file URL in SharePoint is https://www.contoso.com/sites/marketing/documents/Shared%20Documents/Promotion/Some%20File.xlsx, the limit applies to “sites/marketing/documents/Shared Documents/Promotion/Some File.xlsx.”\n\nLikewise, if the file URL in OneDrive is https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/meganb_contoso%20_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmeganb%5Fcontoso%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FContracts%2FVendor%20Quotations/Some%20File.xlsx, the limit applies to “personal/meganb_contoso_com/Documents/Contracts/Vendor Quotations/Some File.xlsx.”\n\nIn addition to the above, if files are synced to a PC or Mac, the following limitations apply:\n\nEach segment of the path (a segment is a file name or folder name like “Promotion” or “Some File.xlsx” in the examples above) can't be more than 255 characters due to operating system limitations.\n\nThe length of the OneDrive root folder (e.g. C:\\users\\meganb\\OneDrive - Contoso) + the relative path of the file (up to 400 chars) cannot be more than 520 characters.\n\nThe organization name can be updated in the M365 admin center but that will not propagate to existing Sync relationships (only newly established ones). For existing Sync relationships to have the new organization name, users need to unlink and relink their account.\n\nWhen syncing, you are also limited to the Windows Explorer or macOS file path limits. For example, in Windows Explorer, the limit is 256 usable characters not including the drive letter (like C:\\) nor the terminating null character. Read more about max path limitations in Windows.\n\nSharePoint Server versions only support up to 260 characters for file and path lengths, Microsoft Excel and older Office version have a lower limit, see KB 326039 for details.\n\nIf you exceed any limits, you'll receive an error message.\n\nNumber of items that can be synced or copied\n\nApplies to:\n\nWhen using the OneDrive website, you can only copy up to 2500 files at one time.\n\nFor optimum performance, we recommend syncing no more than a total of 300,000 files across your cloud storage. Performance issues can occur if you have more than 300,000 items, even if you are not syncing all items.\n\nIf you are uploading, downloading, or moving a large number of files at once, you may need to wait an extended period of time before the sync process can complete. The desktop app taskbar or menubar status icon will show “syncing” or \"processing changes\" during this period.\n\nNotes:\n\nWe may delay syncing of many files to ensure a high quality of service for everyone.\n\nThere are other SharePoint limits on viewing a document library using the web that may affect how you structure your files in OneDrive.\n\nWindows specific restrictions and limitations\n\nApplies to:\n\nFile Explorer displays the first 35 characters of a site library’s name and site name combination for a library that you have synchronized. This doesn’t affect the ability to sync these items within the limits that are described in this article.\n\nRoaming, Mandatory, and Temporary Windows profiles aren't supported. The OneDrive sync app only supports users who can write to OneDrive application directories.\n\nAdditionally, the OneDrive sync app is only supported in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments in the following cases:\n\nVirtual desktops that persist between sessions.\n\nNon-persistent environments that use Windows Virtual Desktop preview.\n\nNon-persistent environments that have FSLogix Apps 2.8 or later, FSLogix Office 365 Container, and a Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nRead more about using the sync app on virtual desktops.\n\nFor the sync app to work as designed, the following requirements must be met:\n\nThe application must be installed on the local computer.\n\nThe user must be able to write to the user profile.\n\nData that's written to the user profile must be saved to the local hard disk and be available without a network connection.\n\nFolders must not have the SetCaseSensitiveInfo setting enabled.\n\nOneDrive Files On-Demand is supported on Windows 10 2017 Fall Creators Update and later versions, or Windows Server 2019 and later versions, or Mac OS X Mojave (10.14) or newer.\n\nCheck you're not syncing too many files\n\nApplies to:\n\nIf OneDrive sync seems to be stuck for a long time or the status shows \"Processing 0KB of xMB\" it could be because you have a lot of files in your OneDrive or a lot of new files to be uploaded. If you have more than 300,000 files, sync can take a long time.\n\nNote: For transferring large files or lots of files, we recommend adding the files to the OneDrive desktop app rather than the using Upload button on the website.\n\nTo see how many files you have in your OneDrive:\n\nOpen File Explorer.\n\nRight-click the OneDrive folder and select Properties.\n\nIf the Contains number is more than 300,000 you should consider to reduce files in OneDrive. If you have shortcut folders or synced SharePoint libraries, removing shortcut folders and stop syncing the libraries are also effective.\n\nIf the sync is already in process, you can Pause and Resume your sync to get things going again.\n\nSelect the white or blue OneDrive cloud icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar.\n\nNote: You might need to click the Show hidden icons arrow next to the notification area to see the OneDrive icon, or click and start typing \"select which icons\" to display the notification area settings option, and then show Microsoft OneDrive. If the icon still doesn't appear in the notification area, OneDrive might not be running. Click , type OneDrive in the search box, and then click OneDrive (not \"OneDrive for work or school\" because that's an older version) in the search results.\n\nSelect More > Pause syncing... , and select either 2, 8 or 24 hours.\n\nSelect More again and select Resume syncing.\n\nMake sure you don't have duplicate filenames\n\nApplies to:\n\nYou may have sync conflicts if you're uploading multiple files on the OneDrive website at the same time, or if you made changes in your OneDrive folder on another PC that is syncing at the same time.\n\nSync issues can also occur if you edit files offline.\n\nTo reduce sync conflicts, rename the edited files or folders to something new or unique, and then save it again."
