The font, based on Jazm√≠n typeface, features a more developed design while still maintaining the essence of the original version.\n\nThe extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes gives Juana a harmonic and stylish look. It comes in 8 weights with matching italics and includes an alternate version. The whole character set supports over 200 Latin-based languages. Juana is perfectly suited for editorial design, branding, magazines, logos, headings and more.\n\nThanks to Latinotype. Juana Serif Font is the demo version, free for personal use only.\n\nLink to purchase full version and commercial license: HERE\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-black.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-bold.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-extralight.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-light.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-medium.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-regular.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-semibold.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juanaalt-thin.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-black.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-blackit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-bold.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-boldit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-extralight.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-extralightit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-light.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-lightit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-medium.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-mediumit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-regular.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-regularit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-semibold.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-semiboldit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-thin.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nView all Glyphs Fontspring-DEMO-juana-thinit.otf The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\nPrevious articleManverse Font\n\nNext articleMintage Font"
