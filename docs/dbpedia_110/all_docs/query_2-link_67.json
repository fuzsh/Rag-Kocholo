        "text": "Warranty\n\nYour Fermob furniture is covered by a dual guarantee as long as the product is used in the conditions recommended by the brand:\n\n5-year functional warranty\n\nFermob guarantees that products will remain fit for the purpose for which they were designed for 5 years. The guarantee covers all functional aspects of the product such as welding, fasteners, rivets and folding.\n\n2-year ageing warranty\n\nThe speed at which a product ages depends on how carefully it is treated. The ageing guarantee covers premature and abnormal deterioration in the appearance of the product’s materials, such as corrosion, discolouration, stains and rings.\n\nThe ageing and functional guarantees do not cover:\n\n• Damaged, converted or modified furniture.\n\n• Furniture not used as per Fermob’s recommendations. Any damage arising from insufficient care, or from failure to comply with the supplied instructions and advice for receiving, assembling, using, maintaining and storing furniture supplied to the customer.\n\n• Rings or stains undeclared when unpacking (including stains related to a combination of humidity retention + heat).\n\n• General wear and tear or natural fading of the materials used.\n\n• Corrosion originating from scratches or abrasions that result from general wear and tear and which cannot be removed via standard cleaning and maintenance processes.\n\n• Minor spots of rust under table tops and seats or on bases. These are a natural outcome of the material used (iron) and can be treated using the maintenance tools made available to customers by Fermob.\n\n• Corrosion of stainless steel parts due to use in a confined, chlorinated environment.\n\n• Corrosion of steel furniture (including stainless steel furniture) as a result of use in a coastal environment.\n\n• Any changes in the visual appearance of wood that are directly linked to ageing. As wood is a living material, the appearance of its surface changes naturally over time.\n\nThis guarantee is limited to reimbursement (with application of a reduction) or replacement of the product, and applies only upon presentation of the purchase receipt (cash register slip or purchase invoice).\n\nReturns\n\nBefore you request or arrange return of a Product, please read the below information carefully.\n\nYou may Return any Delivered Products you have purchased within 14 working days of Delivery, excluding any products which are Made To Order or Bespoke for any reason (including if you simply change your mind). To do so you must notify us in writing via email or post within 7 working days of Delivery. If you are Returning a Product for any reason, except damage or manufacturer defect, You must pay the costs of Returning the Products to Us or our suppliers.\n\nOn request, we will collect the Products from you, but the cost of this will be charged to you and we may deduct this from the Refund.\n\nIf:\n\nthe Product delivered is not what you Ordered (including an unapproved Substitute Product), or does not correspond with its description;\n\nthe Product delivered is not of a satisfactory quality;\n\nthe Product arrives damaged or faulty and you have notified us after 14 working days;\n\nWe may replace the item or affected parts or you may Cancel the Order and receive a full Refund. You will not be charged for the costs of returning an unapproved substitute or defective product. If Products arrive in a damaged condition you must make a note on the carrier's Delivery consignment note where possible and inform us within 7 working days of the Delivery. If the Product becomes defective soon after 7 working days have passed, Barbed Limited will, at its option, repair the product, replace the Product or Refund you. You will not be charged for the cost of Returning a defective Product.\n\nWe will not accept Returns or Cancellations if the Products have been altered by applying chemicals or paints to the surfaces or by altering or customising the Product in any way that could be deemed as you using or treating the Products as your own. While in your possession, you must keep any Products you intend to Return to us in good condition. Products must be Returned in the same condition as they were delivered. If products were delivered flat packed they must be Returned in the same way. Care must be taken to ensure the Return Products are packed well to avoid damage or loss of parts in transit. Products Returned which cannot be re-sold as new due to damage or wear and tear may be subject to a reduction in the Refund given.\n\nStock Definitions and \"Made To Order\" or \"Bespoke\" Items\n\nItems \"in stock\" are deemed to be available and will be packaged and shipped within 3 working days.\n\nProducts Made To Order or Bespoke cannot be cancelled or returned. Made To Order or Bespoke Products will usually be described as such on the website, however, any Product where you are specifying, for example, a colour or size which is not described as In Stock on the website is Made To Order.\n\nBarbed Ltd will try to ensure that Made To Order products are completed and delivered within the estimated lead time advised at time of purchase. However, delays do occasionally arise due to production or shipping issues, out of our control. If a delay occurs, Barbed will communicate to You, the customer as soon as the manufacturer confirms the new estimated delivery date or notifies Barbed Ltd of any production delays, however, this does not mean you have the right to cancel such an order if it is beyond the estimated timeframe.\n\nRefunds\n\nRefunds will be processed within 14 days. Where exchange rates of currency are involved, the Refund will be made in £GBP at the current exchange rate. Barbed Ltd do not accept responsibility for any loss or gain caused by changes in the exchange rate between the time of Ordering and the time of issuing the Refund."
