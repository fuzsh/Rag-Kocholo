        "text": "TEDx Logo Generator\n\nWe've built the handy TEDx Logo Generator to automatically design a draft of your event logo in the proper format!\n\nSimply type in your event name as licensed (with spaces between the words), choose any relevant event types, and download the files.\n\nThe Logo Generator creates logos in Inter font and produces PNG files best suited for online use. To create finished high-res .eps files, adapt the appropriate template linked in the PDF below.\n\nCreate your logo:\n\nTEDx Logo Generator\n\nTEDx Logo Templates\n\nLogo Template Files in Inter font (.eps)\n\nTEDx Logo Guidelines\n\nThe TEDx logo guidelines accommodate the growing range of TEDx events. The information below reflects the most up-to-date changes that go into effect in 2023 (and are optional for organizers licensed before 2023). You can learn more about these changes here.\n\nTeams are no longer required to include the tagline \"x=independently organized TED event\" in event logos.\n\nYou’ll use your TEDx logo throughout every part of your event: on your website(s), social media, and all event communications, materials and signs.\n\nThe TEDx logo is different from the TED logo, as it contains the “x” at the end as well as the unique location-based name of your event.\n\nLet’s get into the guidelines!\n\nRules to Remember\n\nNever use the TED or TEDx logos! Only your event's approved, full TEDx event name may be used.\n\nYour TEDx logo must appear on your website, all outbound communications with speakers, attendees and sponsors, and all PR and marketing materials.\n\nThe updated logo guidelines are mandatory for new series first licensed on or after January 1, 2023. However, TEDx organizers with event series first licensed before 2023 have the option to maintain their previous logo or use the updated guidelines.\n\nDesign and variations\n\nTEDx + Your Unique Event Name + when applicable, the event type modifier.\n\nFor events with a one-word location name: TEDx and the location name are always written as a single word.\n\nFor location names that are more than one word: the entire location name drops down to the following line(s). Include spaces between each word. Reference the examples below.\n\nWhen in doubt, use the Logo Generator!\n\nYour logo can be a maximum of four lines.\n\nThe maximum width for each line is equal to roughly four “TEDx”s written side by side, or about 22 characters.\n\nWhen you must write your event name in text rather than logo form (e.g. in an email or a social media caption, your YouTube channel name): write TEDx and the first name of the location name as one word, then include spaces between the remaining words.\n\nModifiers for special event types (Women, Youth, Salon, Studio) are included in bold.\n\nAdditional Specifications\n\nFont: The typeface Helvetica is an integral part of our visual identity, and it comes pre-installed on most computers. If you do not have access to Helvetica, you can use Inter Light, which is a nearly identical open-source font.\n\nIf you have a different version of Helvetica (Helvetica Neue, for example), use the Regular weight of your version.\n\nTracking: Letter-spacing in the TEDx logo templates is set to 0. Do not adjust this setting.\n\nKerning: You can kern individual letters in your location name, if needed.\n\nAlignment: The name of your event should always align left in relation to the \"TEDx\" part of the logo, and should be sized to be exactly the same height as the \"TEDx\" part of the logo. Tracking in the TEDx logo templates is set to 0. Do not adjust this setting.\n\nColor: your TEDx event's logo should always include a red \"TEDx\" and either black or white text for the other words.\n\nTED Red is HEX Color #EB0028.\n\nReproducing TED Red\n\nOffset printing with Pantone inks: When possible, a spot color should be used for your logo -- this is the best way to reproduce TED red (Pantone 185).\n\nOffset printing with 4-color process inks: If specifying a spot color is not possible, the 4-color process (CMYK) method of printing may be used to print your TEDx event's logo. 4-color process printing is acceptable, although it is not the preferable way to reproduce the logo. In 4-color process printing the TED red color will only be simulated.\n\nDesktop printing: Sometimes it is more appropriate to produce branded publications and other communications using a digital process -- such as printing from a computer directly to a desktop laser or ink-jet printer. Local settings and calibrations should be used to determine the best color specifications for your particular printer.\n\nOnscreen/web: When your TEDx event's logo is reproduced onscreen in slide presentations, in video, or online, RGB or web color logos should be used. Onscreen applications use RGB (red/green/blue) values to simulate color. On the web, hex values are used to specify color. Each of these specifications is shown below.\n\nNote that even though you may be offset printing a publication using 4-color process, it is often possible (and highly recommended) to specify an additional spot color (Pantone 185) for the logo.\n\nThe colors shown here and throughout these guidelines have not been evaluated by Pantone Inc. for accuracy and may not match the Pantone Color Standards.\n\nDue to the manner in which color is represented on-screen, the colors shown here may not accurately represent the true TEDx colors. Therefore, do not use the colors shown here (or a printed version of this page) for color matching. Instead, always refer to the color specifications and visually match the specified colors accurately using Pantone Color Standards.\n\nTagline\n\nWe no longer require teams to include the TEDx tagline “x=independently organized TED event” in the logo. Teams must still use their event’s full name: “TEDx[Event Name],” not “TEDx” or “TED” alone, in all of their communications.\n\nLogos and place names\n\nYour specific TEDx logo will contain your full location name. Longer names can continue to the next line, for a maximum of four lines.\n\nBackground color\n\nOnly use a solid white or black background.\n\nClear space\n\nTo ensure that your TEDx event logo is presented in the best possible manner, a minimum buffer zone of clear space should always be maintained around its perimeter. Keep other logos, graphics or copy out of this zone. (Logos may not be \"locked up\" with any other logos or images. Other logos cannot appear as if they are a part of your TEDx event logo.)\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nDo not set the place name in all caps and keep it the same size as \"TEDx.\"\n\nDo not change the color of TEDx or the “x” in TEDx. Do not write the place name in colors other than black or white.\n\nDo not place your TEDx event's logo on colors other than black or white or on photographic, patterned or illustrated backgrounds.\n\nNext: Visual design"
