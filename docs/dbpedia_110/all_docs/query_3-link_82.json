        "text": "The search syntax gives you more flexibility when creating searches, through the use of operators, wildcards and search filters. Although it is possible to perform most searches without using search syntax, this capability provides additional options for more powerful searching.\n\nPerforming Search Syntax Searches\n\nTo perform a search syntax search, click Search Filters next to the search box at the top of the Folder Browser. The Search Filters pane will open. In the Search Filters option, select Add Filter, select Search Syntax, and then click OK. You can then type the desired search syntax in the Search Syntax box. See Search Syntax Reference, below, for more information about individual search types.\n\nSearch Syntax Considerations\n\nWhen using search syntax, keep the following in mind:\n\nMultiple search syntaxes can be combined in a single search.\n\nUse operators to combine different search syntaxes.\n\nParentheses and the order in which the search syntax is listed determine how the search syntax will be interpreted. For example, each of the following will produce different search results:\n\n(A & B) | C\n\nA & (B | C)\n\nC | A & B\n\nSearch syntax supports the use of wildcards (i.e., *, ?, [], and -).\n\nCharacters that are neither in the alphabet nor are a number can only be searched upon if enclosed in double quotation marks. There are four exceptions to this rule: #, $, %, &.\n\nFor example, searching for \"in the city, a car\" will return any one of the following results:\n\nin the city? A car\n\nin the city. A car\n\nin the city! A car\n\nin the city a car\n\nIn other words, the search will return any result that has non-alphanumeric character in the place of the original non-alphanumeric character (in this case the comma) or it will ignore the delimiter altogether.\n\nIf other search filters are used, a document or folder will not qualify as a search result unless it meets all of the specified criteria.\n\nViewing the Search Syntax for an Search\n\nWhen performing an search, you can view the search syntax for the search as you create it. To do so, open Search Filters and click Show search syntax at the bottom of the dialog box. This will display the syntax for the search you currently have configured. As you make edits to your search, the syntax will automatically be updated. This is a useful way to learn how to create a search syntax search. You can also copy the syntax from this box and paste it into the Search syntax search option, and then fine-tune it without having to write the syntax from scratch.\n\nSearch Syntax Reference\n\nFor each search type, the sections below will provide the basic syntax and one or more examples.(See Records Management Search Syntax Reference, below, for information about records management searches.)\n\nAnnotation Comments Search Syntax\n\nThis search type searches for the comments associated with annotations in your documents. Annotation comment searches search across all types of annotations.\n\nBy default, an annotation comment search with multiple words will match any annotation comment that contains both words, even if they are not present as that exact phrase. To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in single quotes within the double quotes of the syntax.\n\nAnnotation comment:\n\n{LF:AnnComment~=\"Value\"}\n\nAnnotation Content Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for text contained in sticky notes, callout text, comments, and text boxes.\n\nBy default, an annotation content search with multiple words will match any annotation comment that contains both words, even if they are not present as that exact phrase. To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in single quotes within the double quotes of the syntax.\n\nAny text annotation (sticky note, callout text, or text box):\n\n{LF:AnnText~=\"Value\", Type=Type}\n\nType is optional, and can be set to S, T, and/or C for sticky notes, text boxes, or callout text respectively. If the Type parameter is omitted, the search will be performed on all three annotation types.\n\nSticky note:\n\n{LF:Sticky~=\"Value\"}\n\nCallout text:\n\n{LF:Callout~=\"Value\"}\n\nText box:\n\n{LF:Textbox~=\"Value\"}\n\nValue is the annotation text to be searched for; it must be enclosed by quotation marks.\n\nCreation and/or Modification Date Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to find items created or modified on a certain date.\n\nCreation date:\n\n{LF:Created=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\nModification date:\n\n{LF:Modified=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\nNote: Valid month/day/year search patterns are: mm/dd/yyyy, mm/dd/yy, mm/yyyy, and mm/yy. The order in which the month, day, and year are specified is determined by the short date format of your browser.\n\nDocument Relationship Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax allows you to perform searches for documents that have been linked together.\n\nDocument relationship:\n\nThis search will return entries given either side of a specific document relationship. This search will return at least two entries.\n\n{LF:Relation = \"Relationship Name\"}\n\nRelationship Name is the name of the document relationship being searched for; the name must be enclosed by quotation marks.\n\nSource relationship:\n\nThis search will only return entries given the source relationship half of a document relationship.\n\n{LF:RelationSRC = \"Relationship Name\"}\n\nRelationship Name is the name of the source side of the document relationship being searched for; the name must be enclosed by quotation marks.\n\nReverse relationship:\n\nThis search will only return entries given the reverse relationship half of a document relationship.\n\n{LF:RelationDST = \"Reverse Relationship Name\"}\n\nReverse Relationship Name is the name of the reverse side of the document relationship being searched for; the name must be enclosed by quotation marks.\n\nNote: Relationship and reverse relationship names are configured in Repository Administration.\n\nElectronic File Type Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for electronic documents associated with electronic files with specific file extensions.\n\nElectronic file extension:\n\n{LF:Ext=\"Extension\"}\n\nEntry ID Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents or folders by their entry ID, a unique number assigned to each document and folder in a Laserfiche repository.\n\nEntry ID:\n\n{LF:ID = EntryID}\n\nThe entry ID of a particular document or folder can be found by selecting the Metadata tab of the right pane in either the Document Viewer or Folder Browser. Click Show advanced to display the entry ID.\n\nEntry Name Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to look for all entries with a particular name. Entry name search is performed as an exact search unless you use wildcards.\n\nEntries with a specific name\n\n{LF:Name=\"EntryName\", Type=Type}\n\nEntries whose parent folder has a specific name\n\n{LF:ParentName=\"EntryName\"\n\nFolders containing entries with a specific name\n\n{LF:ChildName=\"EntryName\", Type=Type}\n\nEntryName is the name of the document or folder you want to search for; the value must be enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nThe Type parameter is optional and should be set to the type of entries that you want to be included in the search results. This parameter can be set to include any combination of folders (F), documents (D), shortcuts (S), etc. that you want to include. Note that the ParentName search does not support the Type parameter, as parents are always folders. The following table explains the acceptable values for the Type parameter:\n\nType Parameter Values for Entry Name Search Value Description D Documents B Documents without templates F Folders S Shortcut\n\nFolder Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to find items located in a particular folder.\n\nFolder:\n\n{LF:Lookin=\"Path\", Subfolders=Y/N}\n\nPath represents the folder path searched, and must be enclosed by quotation marks.\n\nSubfolders is an optional term; it determines whether subfolders of the specified folder path will also be searched. This parameter can be set to \"Y\" for yes or \"N\" for no. The default is âyesâ; if the term is omitted, subfolders will be searched.\n\nFull-Text Search Syntax\n\nOne of the benefits of using search syntax to perform text searches is performing more complex text searches, such as searching for multiple words or phrases.\n\nTo perform a simple text search, type the word you want to search for. To search for the word pruning, type the following:\n\npruning\n\nTo search for a phrase, enclose it in quotes. To search for the phrase âpruning shearsâ type the following:\n\nâpruning shearsâ\n\nYou can make searches more powerful by combining words or phrases with operators. To find all documents that pertain to \"pruning\" and contain the word \"maple\" or \"cherry,\" you would use one of the following:\n\npruning & (maple | cherry)\n\n(maple | cherry) & pruning\n\nIn the search criteria specified above, the pipe \"|\" represents \"OR\" and the ampersand \"&\" represents \"AND.\" In the above example, the order in which search criteria are listed does not matter, however, in other cases, the order can make a huge difference. If you remove the parentheses from the above example, you end up with the following:\n\npruning & maple | cherry\n\nThis would find all documents containing the words \"pruning\" and \"maple.\" It would also find all documents that contain the word \"cherry.\"\n\nmaple | cherry & pruning\n\nThis would find all documents containing the word \"maple.\" It would also find all documents that contain the words \"cherry\" and \"pruning.\"\n\nProximity searches can also be performed using search syntax. To specify a proximity search, separate two phrases with a caret (^) followed by the maximum number of words that can come between the two phrases. If you were only interested in documents where the word \"pruning\" occurs within 15 words of either the word \"maple\" or \"cherry,\" you would use one of the following:\n\n(maple | cherry) ^15 pruning\n\npruning ^15 (maple | cherry)\n\nImage Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents that do or do not contain image pages.\n\nImage page:\n\n{LF:Img=Y/N}\n\nThis search parameter can be set to \"Y\" for yes or \"N\" for no.\n\nSearchable Text Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents by whether searchable text has been generated for them or not.\n\nSearchable text:\n\n{LF:OCR=All/Some/None}\n\nThe following table explains the acceptable values for the OCR parameter of the searchable text search.\n\nValues for Searchable Text Search Value Description All Only documents where all pages have been processed by OCR will be considered valid search results. Some Documents where at least one page but not all pages have been processed by OCR will be considered valid search results. None All documents without a single page that has been processed by OCR will be considered valid search results.\n\nLocation Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents within a specified distance of a particular location, or by location description. Locations in search syntax use GPS coordinates.\n\nLocation description:\n\nSearch syntax allows you to search for entries with a specific description.\n\n{LF:GeoText=\"Value\"}\n\nValue is the location description that will be searched for.\n\nLocation:\n\nSearch syntax allows you to search for entries within a certain distance of a specified location, as defined by GPS coordinates. The distance is specified in meters.\n\n{LFGEO:Type=\"POINT\"} & {LFGEO:Distance<Distance, Object=\"POINT(CoordinateTwo CoordinateOne)\"}\n\nDistance is the distance in meters within which you want to search, and CoodiateTwo and CoordinateOne are the pair of GPS coordinates that define the center of the radius. Note that the coordinates are reversed from the GPS standard.\n\nTip: Use a mathematical operator (=, >, >=, <, and <=) and wildcards to determine the results that will be returned.\n\nPage Count Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents with a particular number of pages or a number of pages that fall within a particular range.\n\nPage count:\n\n{LF:PageCount = Value}\n\nValue must be an integer that represents the number of pages in your target documents.\n\nPages Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents that do or do not contain pages.\n\nPages:\n\n{LF:AssociatedPages=Y/N}\n\nNote: For the purposes of this search, a document is considered to have no pages if it contains neither TIFF image pages nor text pages.\n\nSize Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents with a particular image, text, thumbnail, or location data size. You can search based on whether you want to find a document where one or more individual image pages, text pages, thumbnails or location data items are a particular size, or to find a document with a specific total image, text, thumbnail or location data size.\n\nSize Search Syntax Options Entry component Syntax Individual Image Page {LF:ImageSize = Value} Individual Text Page {LF:TextSize = Value} Total Image Pages {LF:TotalImageSize = Value} Total Text Pages {LF:TotalTextSize = Value} Electronic File {LF:EDocSize=Value}\n\nValue must be an integer that represents the target size in bytes.\n\nTag Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to find documents and folders assigned a particular tag.\n\nTags:\n\n{LF:Tags=\"TagName\"}\n\nTagName is the name of the tag being searched for; it must be enclosed by quotation marks.\n\nTemplate and Field Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to look for all entries associated with a particular template, field, or field value.\n\nTemplates:\n\n{[TemplateName]}\n\nTo search across any template, leave the Template name blank \"[]\".\n\nTemplateName is the name of the template being searched for.\n\nFields:\n\n{[]:[FieldName]=\"Value\"}\n\nValue is the field content you are searching for. To search across any field, leave the name blank: \"[]\", or to search for fields that are unpopulated, leave the Value blank: {[]:[FieldName]=\"\"} (this is the only way to search for a blank field; wildcards will not return blank fields).\n\nFieldName is the name of the field whose values are being searched for.\n\nText fields:\n\nIf the field you are searching for is a text field, you may be able to use the following syntax:\n\n{[]:[FieldName]~=\"Value\"}\n\nThis will allow you to take advantage of additional search features such as fuzzy search and the ability to find variants of root words (such as searching for \"ran\" and also returning \"run\" and \"running\"). However, in some cases this search may not be possible. In that case, you should use the standard field search syntax ({[]:[FieldName]=\"Value\"} ).\n\nTemplate and field:\n\n{[TemplateName]:[FieldName]=\"Value\"}\n\nValue is the field content you are searching for. To search across any template or field, leave the name blank \"[]\".\n\nAs noted above, in some cases you can use the syntax {[TemplateName]:[FieldName]~=\"Value\"} if the field is a text field, to take advantage of additional features.\n\nMultiple fields:\n\nWhen searching for multiple fields/values, the following search syntaxes are interchangeable:\n\n{[]:[Field1]=\"Value1\", [Field2]=\"Value2\"}\n\n{[]:[Field1]=\"Value1\"} & {[]:[Field2]=\"Value2\"}\n\nThe following Search Filters syntax uses operators and will return a range of values:\n\n{[]:[Field1]>=\"Value1\", <=\"Value2\"}\n\nValue is the field content you are searching for.\n\nDate and Date/Time Fields\n\nThe order in which the month, day, and year should be specified is determined by the short date format configured on your workstation.\n\nExample: A date/time value is: 05/31/2012 09:45:13 AM.\n\nDate or date/time field:\n\n[]:[FieldName]=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\n{[]:[FieldName]=\"mm/dd/yyyyhh:mm: tt\"}\n\nTemplate and date or date/time field:\n\n{[TemplateName]:[FieldName]=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\n{[TemplateName]:[FieldName]=\"mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:sstt\"}\n\nUser Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to find all documents and folders created by, checked out by, or last modified by a particular user.\n\nCreated by:\n\n{LF:Creator=\"User Name\"}\n\nChecked out by:\n\n{LF:CheckOutUser=\"User Name\"}\n\nLast modified by:\n\n{LF:LastModifiedBy=\"User Name\"}\n\nVersion Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for documents that contain a particular version. A document under version control will contain multiple versions, and each version will have its own attributes (such as the date the version was created, the user who created the version, and the version comment). You can perform a search for characteristics of a single version, or a search for characteristics contained in any version or combination of versions in that document. In order to allow you to specify more than one search criteria within a single version, we use a special version search namespace.\n\nThe following version searches can be used separately or combined:\n\nVersion created by:\n\n{LFVER:ModifiedBy=\"User Name\"}\n\nUser Name is the name of the user in Laserfiche who created the version you are searching for. It must be enclosed in quotes.\n\nVersion comment:\n\n{LFVER:Comment~=\"Value\"}\n\nValue is the comment or part of the comment on the version you are searching for. It must be enclosed in quotes.\n\nVersion modified date:\n\n{LFVER:Modified=\"mm/dd/yy\"}\n\nmm/dd/yy is the date on which the version you are searching for was created. It must be in the format mm/dd/yy, mm-dd-yy, mm/dd/yyyy, or mm-dd-yyyy, and must be enclosed in quotes.\n\nVersion number:\n\n{LFVER:Version=Value}\n\nValue is the version number of the version you are searching for. It must be an integer value.\n\nRecords Management Search Syntax Reference\n\nFor each records management search type, the sections below will provide the basic syntax and one or more examples.\n\nCurrent Location Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to perform searches for records that are currently in a specific location.\n\nCurrent location:\n\n{LFRM:CurrentLocation=\"Value\"}\n\nValue is the location that will be searched for and must be enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nCutoff Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to search for all records that have specific cutoff characteristics.\n\nCutoff:\n\nThis search will return records that are already cutoff or records that are due for cutoff before a certain date.\n\nAll records:\n\n{LFRM:ActualCutoffDate=\"*\"}\n\nSpecific date:\n\n{LFRM:ActualCutoffDate=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\nCutoff instruction:\n\nThis search will return records that have a specific cutoff instruction.\n\n{ LFRM:CoffCritID=\"ID\"}\n\nID represents the automatically assigned ID number of the cutoff instruction.\n\nTip: Located the cutoff instruction's ID number by searching for the cutoff instruction from the Search Pane and opening Search Filters from the Customize Search drop-down. Show me.\n\nCutoff instruction type:\n\nThis search will return records that are assigned specific types of cutoff, such as Event or Time+Event cutoff instruction. If you select more than one cutoff instruction type, results will be returned for either.\n\n{LFRM:RetentionType=\"Value\"}\n\nValue specifies whether search results will contain records with Event-based cutoff instructions, Time-based cutoff instructions, Time+Event-based cutoff instructions, or no cutoff instructions. Use the table below to choose values.\n\nCutoff Instruction Type Search Syntax Options Value Description E All records with an Event-based cutoff instruction. T All records with a Time-based cutoff instruction. N All records with a Time+Event-based cutoff instruction. S All records with a Superseded-based cutoff instruction. I All records with an Interval-based cutoff instruction. R All records with an Interval+Event-based cutoff instruction. L All records with a Disposition Action-based cutoff instruction. NULL All records with no cutoff instruction.\n\nCutoff eligibility:\n\nThis search will return records that are eligible for cutoff on or before a specified date. Records that are already cutoff are not returned in a search of this type.\n\n{LFRM:EligibleForCutoff<=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\nTip: Use a mathematical operator (=, >, >=, <, and <=) and wildcards to determine the type of results that will be returned.\n\nDisposition Authority Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax allows you to perform searches for records governed by a specific disposition authority.\n\nDisposition authority:\n\n{LFRM:DispositionAuthority=\"Value\"}\n\nThe DispositionAuthority parameter determines the disposition authority that will be searched for, represented by the term Value, which must be enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nDisposition Eligibility Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax allows you to perform searches for records that have a calculated disposition eligibility date. It can also be extended to perform searches for records that have a disposition eligibility date on a given date.\n\nDisposition eligibility:\n\n{LFRM:DispEligibilityAction=\"Value\"}\n\n{LFRM:DispEligibilityAction=\"Value\", EligibilityDate=\"mm/dd/yyyy\"}\n\nValue specifies the type of disposition action to search for. The EligibilityDate parameter specifies the disposition eligibility date.\n\nDisposition Eligibility Search Syntax Options Value Description U All records that have a calculated eligibility date for any disposition action. T All eligible records with a projected transfer eligibility date. A All records with an Accession final disposition and a final disposition eligibility date. D All records with a Destruction final disposition and a final disposition eligibility date.\n\nEvent Type Search Syntax\n\nSearch syntax can be used to perform searches for records that have been assigned a certain event or have had a certain event set.\n\nAssigned event types:\n\n{LFRM:Event=\"Value\"}\n\nValue specifies the assigned event that you want to search for. When you enter the event name, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nSet event types:\n\n{LFRM:SetEvent=\"Value\"}\n\nValue specifies the set event that you want to search for.
