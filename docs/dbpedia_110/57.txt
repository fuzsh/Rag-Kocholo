Adicionar uma screenshot introdutória e descrição

Sempre que possível começamos uma página de aplicativo de nível superior com isso. O código para ativar isto é

{|class="tablecenter vertical-centered" |[[Image:YourScreenshot.png|250px|thumb]] |Seu texto descritivo |}

Formate seu Texto

Utilize Títulos

Cada título vai na sua própria linha começando e terminando com dois ou mais caracteres '='. Uma vez que há punhado de títulos em uma página, automaticamente é criada uma Tabela de Conteúdos, então é recomendado que se use eles. O número de caracteres '=' determina o nível do título na Tabela de conteídos, assim, os eles devem ser '== Nome da seção principal ==', '=== Nome da subseção ===', '==== Sub-subtítulo aqui ==== ', e assim por diante. Evite o uso de único '=', pois é reconhecido como o título da página e cada página wiki já tem seu próprio título, por exemplo, o nome desta página "Toolbox/pt-br" aparece como título da página.

Usar negrito e itálico

São usadas apóstrofes para especificar palavras em negrito e em itálico.

Use '''texto em negrito''' para especificar negrito e ''texto em itálico'' para especificar itálico.

A fim de assegurar que tenhamos uma tradução fácil e precisa, por favor respeite as Diretrizes Tipográficas.

Add a Code Snippet

We have templates to assist in correctly displaying code snippets. Examples of use in various situations are available on the typographical guideline page

If you have problems displaying pipe characters in your code snippet, please see the explanation and markup detailed on Typographical Guidelines

Adicionar Indentação

":" is used for an indent, and was used in multiples in some old pages. This is deprecated, and causes some problems, so the multiples will be removed as they are found. A single ":" indents by four characters.

Dates in a purely numerical format cause confusion, due to differences in expectations of geographical zones. Please format dates as

18 Mar 2011

with the month either spelled out completely or in abbreviated form, and the year in 4-digit format. The day may be single or double-digit.

Bulleted Lists

* is the symbol to use for bulletted lists. ** gives a second level:

* Almonds * Nuts ** Cashews * Raisins

produces

Almonds

Nuts

Cashews

Raisins

Enumerations

Enumerations are produced in the same way, using '#'.

# Sift # Mix ## Stir thoroughly # Bake

produces

Sift

Mix

Stir thoroughly

Bake

For more details see wikimedia on lists.

Combining Bulleted Lists and Enumerations

You can have an enumerated sublist in a bulleted list and vice versa, like this:

* Nuts *# Cashew *# Crazy * Other things

produces

Nuts

Cashew

Crazy

Other things

while

# Nuts #* Cashew #* Crazy # Other things

produces

Nuts

Cashew

Crazy

Other things

To get each bullet and each sub bullet in its own translation unit you can enter something like this:

* First bullet </translate > <translate > ** First sub bullet </translate > <translate > ** Another sub bullet<br /><br />This one consists of two paragraphs </translate > <translate > * The next main bullet </translate > <translate > ** And so on

This displays like this:

First bullet

First sub bullet

Another sub bullet

This one consists of two paragraphs

The next main bullet

And so on

The same method should apply to the other kinds of lists.

If on the other hand you need to have more sections in the same item, you can do something like this to have each section in a translation unit of its own:

* First bullet </translate > <translate > * Second bullet, first section. </translate><br /><br /> <translate > Second section of the second bullet. This section has a translation unit of its own </translate > <translate > * And so on

This displays like this:

First bullet

Second bullet, first section.

Second section of the second bullet. This section has a translation unit of its own

And so on

Itemizations

Itemizations are produced using ; and : alternatively. They are best for giving short descriptions for a group of related objects.

;Animals : They move around and devour other creatures. ;Plants : They have roots and feed upon ground water and sun.

produces

Animals

They move around and devour other creatures.

Plants

They have roots and feed upon ground water and sun.

Add a Link

There are three kinds of links to learn, internal ones, to another userbase page, internal links to a section of a userbase page, and external URL links.

For an internal link the format [[PageLayout]], where you want to display the name of the page, does work, but it is not ideal, particularly for translation to docbook and for localisation. It is better to use the form [[Special:myLanguage/PageLayout|Page Layout]], because that allows translators to link correctly even though the page name is localised. The result is that it directs to the correctly translated page, if one exists. You often need to include the link in a sentence, so in that case you would use

[[Special:myLanguage/PageLayout|this page]]

which displays

this page

Internal links to subsections of a page use character '#' (hash) and should look like this

[[Special:myLanguage/Tasks_and_Tools#Working_with_Languages|...]]

With this kind of link it is very important, that the page you link to declares the reference anchor. If the anchor contains space characters, replace them by character '_' (underscore) when calling the reference. If the reference is found, the section will be automatically displayed by your browser (if it manages anchors). If it is not the case, you will have to go down through the page to find the referenced section. External links are given as the URL and a text separated by a space and delimited by single square brackets as in

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE KDE's Wikipedia page]

which gives KDE's Wikipedia page.

Anchor declaration

Anchor declaration must be done immediatly BEFORE the referenced section, and followed by a blank line separating the anchor and its headline. In the following example just copy in the ID value, the title of associated section. It should look like this:

</translate><span id="Working with Languages"></span> <translate>

If the page containing the section that you link to is not yet marked up for translation, you should omit the </translate > and <translate > tags.

External links are slightly different so

[http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules our road map]

displays

our road map, which would take you straight to the techbase page.

One last thing to note - when you preview your page, all links are live. This gives you two benefits. You can check (by hovering) that your links are set up as you expected, and you can use a red link to create a new page.

Make an application list

If you want to make a list of applications like the ones in the subpages of Applications, you should use the AppItem template. Simply enter

{| {{AppItem|System Settings/Locale|Preferences-desktop-locale.png| Settings for localized handling of numbers, dates, etc}}A short text. A few more short lines about the app. This is optional. |- {{AppItem|System Settings/Shortcuts and Gestures|Preferences-desktop-keyboard.png| Shortcuts and Gestures}}Another short text. If you do not type <keycap>Enter</keycap> between the texts you get one section no matter how long the text is. |}

This gives the following display:

A short text.

A few more short lines about the app. This is optional.

Shortcuts and Gestures

Another short text. If you do not type Enter between the texts you get one section no matter how long the text is.

Note, that you should not prepend "Special:myLanguage" to the page name - the template takes care of that. Also note, that you must give a title, even if the title is the same as the page name.

Footnotes are rarely used in our pages, but if you need them you can place a <ref>text</ref> in the source where the footnote mark should appear. There has to be one <references /> somewhere in the source as well, usually towards the end of the page. This is where the text added by the <ref> tags will appear. For more info see the Wikipedia help page.

Illustrate Your Text

Add a single image, centered

[[File:KMail-kde4.png|250px|center]]

Note that you can change the position of the image, but the default is left. The size of the image depends on the circumstances, but for screenshots I recommend no less than 250px and no more than 500px.

Also note that Image: and File: are synonyms. So that [[Image:KMail-kde4.png]] is the same as [[File:KMail-kde4.png]]. However Image: is deprecated, so prefer File: in new content.

see mediawiki for more info.

Make the Image Clickable and Add a Caption

Where you need to show more detail, create a moderately sized image, clickable, so that the full-size can be seen. Simply add the parameter '|thumb' within the image parentheses.

A caption can also be added as a parameter, but will only show if '|thumb' is present.

Example:

[[File:file_name.png|thumb|this will be the caption]]

Add a caption without a thumbnail

Captions also appear on images marked up with the frame syntax.

Example:

[[File:image.png|frame|left|this will be the caption]]

Prevent text from flowing around image

Sometimes you might not want the text to flow down the sides of your image. You can prevent this by adding a <br clear=all> tag between the file tag and the text in question.

Example:

[[File:image.png]] <br clear=all> This text would normally flow down the sides of the image but now it will be found under the image

Use Tables to Precisely Place Multiple Images

{|class="tablecenter" style="border: 1px solid grey;" |[[Image:Desktop-config-customized.png|230px|center]]||[[Image:Desktop-settings-rightclick.png|230px|center]] |- |[[Image:Desktop-theme-details-dialog.png|230px|center]]||[[Image:Plasma-multiple-themes.png|230px|center]] |}

displays

Note that all the parameters for one image are contained within [[...]], and cells are separated by '||'. To start a new line, insert '|-' on an otherwise-empty line, then '|' at the start of the next one.

For more details on Table formating see mediawiki

Embed a Video

As of July 2012 the MediaWiki EmbedVideo extension has been installed on userbase.kde. This means you can embed videos from various video hosting sites into the page content and have them display in line.

EmbedVideo parser function expects to be called in any of the following ways:

{{#ev:service|id}}

{{#ev:service|id|width}}

{{#ev:service|id|width|align}}

{{#ev:service|id|width|align|desc}}

{{#evp:service|id|desc}}

{{#evp:service|id|desc|align}}

{{#evp:service|id|desc|align|width}}

Where:

service is the name of a video sharing service (See "service name" in the list below) id is the id of the video to include width (optional) is the width in pixels of the viewing area (height will be determined automatically) align (optional) is an alignment (float) attribute. May be "left" or "right". desc (optional) is a short description to display beneath the video when it is aligned

For example, to include the famous "evolution of dance" YouTube video, you'd enter:

{{#ev:youtube|dMH0bHeiRNg}}

And if you wanted scaled down to thumbnail size, on the right with a short description, you could use:

{{#ev:youtube|dMH0bHeiRNg|100|right|This is an embedded video!}}

As of version 1.0, EmbedVideo supports embedding video content from the following services:

Site Service Name Dailymotion dailymotion Div Share divshare Edutopia edutopia FunnyOrDie funnyordie Google Video googlevideo Interia interia or interiavideo Revver revver sevenload sevenload TeacherTube teachertube YouTube youtube and youtubehd Vimeo vimeo

Adicionando Notas e Avisos

Where a note or warning is relevant within your text, use these templates:

{{Info|This is general information}} displays

{{Note|Some important information at this point}} displays

{{Tip|A helpful piece of advice, something to remember}}displays

{{Warning|Take care - this is a dangerous thing to do}} displays

Where the strongest possible warning is needed, the Remember box can be used, but please use sparingly. {{Remember|1=This is for things that definitely must not be forgotten}}

You can also change the heading:

Page Redirection

You can make a page to redirect to another page automatically by using:

#REDIRECT [[Pagename]]

KDE3 and KDE SC 4 Versions of Applications

By default, KDE SC 4 is assumed. If the KDE SC 4 version is not yet ready for release, or where only a KDE 3 version exists, it may be necessary to document the KDE3 version. In this case you should add the template {{KDE3}} which displays Should you be writing about a KDE3 version and KDE SC 4 version on the same page, use icons for both — {{KDE4}} which displays

Other Useful Templates

Inserting GUI Icons

The best way to refer to icons in the GUI is to display it in the text. This can be done with a template like this: {{Icon|list-add}}. This will display the icon.

For this to work, the icon image must have been uploaded to the wiki. See Update an Image for an explanation on how to upload images. The .png files can usually be found here: usr/share/icons/oxygen. If possible use the 16x16 icon. The file name should have an Icon- prefix as in Icon-list-add.png — apart from the prefix the filename should exactly match the usual name. Note, that when using the template you should neither write the Icon- prefix nor the .png file type extension.

The icon can also be written as {{Plus}}, and the icon as {{Minus}}. You can also use {{Configure}} to get the icon, and {{Exit}} gets you the icon.

Community Applications

The final consideration concerns those applications which are not distributed as core KDE applications. These need to be indicated by an icon, placing {{Community-app}}

See footnote

at the end of your sentence or line, just as you would to denote a footnote in general writing. You then need to add {{Community-app-footnote}} which will create a footnote, like this:

Making Major Edits to Existing Pages

If a page is likely to be open for editing for some time there is a danger of conflicts - someone else may edit at the same time, and saving your edit will cancel out theirs, or vice versa. The way to avoid that is to make a temporary entry, directly under the language bar, using {{Being_Edited}} which will display

Don't forget to remove it when you have finished!

Adding a New Complex Page

If you need to be able to work on a page for quite some time, over several days, for instance, you may like to use the Construction template - {{Construction}}, which displays

Template:Construção

You can add links to a preceding or a following page using the following templates as described here:

{{Prevnext2|prevpage=Previous Pagename|nextpage=Following Pagename|prevtext=The page before this page|nexttext=This page you should read later|index=Index page|indextext=Back to Menu}}

← The page before this page

↑ Back to Menu ↑

This page you should read later →

All six arguments are optional. For first pages with no preceeding page or last pages with no following page use this:

{{Prevnext2|nextpage=Following Pagename|nexttext=This page you should read later}}

Toolbox/pt-br

This page you should read later →

{{Prevnext2|prevpage=Previous Pagename|prevtext=The page before this page}}

← The page before this page

Toolbox/pt-br

If you don't specify an indexname the name of the current page will be displayed.

You can link directly to a bug in Bugzilla by using this template:

{{Bug|123456}}

Please do not forget to add the <s> and </s> to strike through a bug that is closed.

Adding a List of Sub-Pages

== Subpages of {{FULLPAGENAME}} == {{Special:PrefixIndex/{{FULLPAGENAME}}/}}

is very useful when you want to list subpages with active links, such as

Subpages of Toolbox/pt-br

It does, however, also list all "other-language" pages, so use with discretion.
