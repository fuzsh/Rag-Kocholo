Swingin&#39; Till The Girls Come Home\n5. Yesterdays\n6. Blues For Nils\n7. A Simple Need\n8. Whisper Not\n9. Blues For Nils\n10. There&#39;s No Greater Love\n11. Ack Värmland Du Sköna\n12. Bluesology\n\nIn these duo and solo tracks, the strength of Kennys playing is clearly discernible. It Is no surprise either, that the work of NHØP in the first four tracks, and of his contemporary Bo Stief during the closing live set, is exemplary and stimulates the pianist to some of his best improvisation. The existence of these previously unreleased recordings should serve as a reminder that here was a unique and irreplaceable contributor to the art of jazz piano.",
