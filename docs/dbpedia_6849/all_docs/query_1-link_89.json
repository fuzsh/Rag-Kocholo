        "text": "Label: Dischi Della Quercia – 2Q 28005\n\nFormat: 2 × Vinyl, LP, Album / Country: Italy / Released: 1978\n\nStyle: Free Jazz, Contemporary Jazz, Free Improvisation, Avant-garde\n\nRecorded at: Live al Teatro Lirico di Milano il 22 novembre 1977.\n\nEngineer: Giuseppe Setaro\n\nCover Photos: Paola Mattioli\n\nSextett Photo: Laura Rizzi\n\nG r a f f i t i\n\nA1 - Black Out ........................................ 9:54\n\nA2 - Soul Street ....................................... 7:58\n\nB1 - Ballo Popolare Sui Navigli .............. 5:42\n\nB2 - Black Night, Black Light ............... 12:25\n\nC1 – Tastiere .......................................... 12:05\n\nC2 - Mexico City Free ............................. 9:22\n\n-\n\nD1 - Alle Fonti Del Jazz .......................... 8:15\n\nD2 - La Ballata Del Pover Luisin ............ 8:47\n\nGiorgio Gaslini – piano, electric piano, spinetta\n\nGianni Bedori – tenore and soprano sax\n\nGianluigi Trovesi – alto and soprano sax, bass clarinet\n\nPaolo Damiani – double-bass\n\nGianni Cazzola – drums\n\nLuis Agudo – percussions\n\nIn 1960 Gaslini wrote and recorded the music for Michelangelo Antonioni’s masterpiece La Notte. Five years later he made a record called Nuovi Sentimenti (New Feelings), with a band including Don Cherry, Steve Lacy, Gato Barbieri, two bassists and two drummers: an early example of a European musician embracing the avant garde. Since then he has written and recorded music in just about every conceivable format, from solos and duos through a regular quartet that featured the fine Italian tenorist Gianni Bedori, to quintets, sextets, septets, octets and many kinds oflarge ensemble; he has composed jazz pieces for his own big band and the Italian Instabile Orchestra, symphonies, choral pieces, ballet scores, and an opera called Colloquio per Malcolm X.\n\nGiorgio Gaslini\n\nGianluigi Trovesi\n\n...However, the most fully realised music is contained on the two albums devoted to a sextet he led in the late ’70s, with Bedori on tenor and soprano saxes, Gianluigi Trovesi on alto and soprano sax and bass clarinet, Paolo Damiani on double bass, Gianni Cazzola on drums and Luis Agudo on percussion. The first of them, dating from 1977, is called Free Actions and sounds today as fresh and compelling as any post-Coltrane jazz that was being played anywhere in the world at the time. Better than that: anyone listening to the brilliantly imaginative solos of Bedori and Trovesi against an active, hard-swinging ostinato figure during the fifth and final movement of the suite from which the album takes its name might well find themselves thinking of the current Wayne Shorter Quartet, and concluding that the Italians are not shamed by such an exalted comparison, even though they were making their music almost three and a half decades ago.\n\nThe second sextet album, Graffiti, was recorded live in Milan the following year and is equally as good. Again it’s a suite, and one of the movements — called “Soul Street” — brilliantly captures the spirit of the Charles Mingus of East Coasting and Jazz Portraits. It’s also in this track that Gaslini’s piano solo demonstrates how well he can blend the free with the funky. Once again Bedori and Trovesi are outstanding throughout, while Damiani’s sinewy bass lines remind me of his British contemporary, the late, lamented Jeff Clyne...\n\nMy favorite album for this month. Enjoy!\n\nIf you find it, buy this album!\n\nLabel: WATT Works ‎– WATT/ 2, Virgin – WATT/ 2\n\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album / Country: UK / Released: 1974\n\nStyle: Contemporary Jazz\n\nRecorded and Mixed At Blue Rock Studio, 1974.\n\nDesign – Paul McDonough\n\nEngineer – Eddie Korvin, Frank Owen\n\nEngineer [Assistant] – Richard Elen\n\nMixed By – Eddie Korvin\n\nPhotography By – Gregory Reeve, Jerry Bauer, Valerie Wilmer\n\nProducer – Michael Mantler\n\nNumber Six\n\nA1 - Part One . . . . . . . . . . 4:55\n\nA2 - Part Two . . . . . . . . . . 4:50\n\nA3 - Part Three . . . . . . . . . 5:45\n\nA4 - Part Four . . . . . . . . . . 2:05\n\nNumber Twelve\n\nB1 - Part One . . . . . . . . . . 7:35\n\nB2 - Part Two . . . . . . . . . . 4:05\n\nB3 - Part Three . . . . . . . . . 2:00\n\nB4 - Part Four . . . . . . . . . . 2:55\n\nComposed By – Michael Mantler\n\nWords By – Samuel Beckett From \"How It Is\", 1964\n\nCarla Bley – piano, organ, clavinet\n\nDon Cherry – trumpet\n\nJack Bruce – voice, bass\n\nA Beckett-like \"Endgame\" atmosphere, a feeling of hopelessness, pervades the work ... a very demanding, exceptionally intelligent production ....\n\nNo Answer marks the recorded beginning of Michael Mantler's fascination with the texts of Samuel Beckett as well as a long association with former Cream vocalist/bassist Jack Bruce. Here, with the spare instrumentation of voice, electric bass, keyboards, and trumpet (the late, great Don Cherry in outstanding form), he sets words from How It Is to accompaniment that ranges in style from bleak and spacy to almost funky. Bruce, with his high, plaintive voice, does a superb job here, investing the cynical, bitter text (example: \"and the mud yes the dark yes the mud and the dark are true yes nothing to regret there no\") with conviction and the right inflection of sorrow. On a couple of pieces, his bass kicks in for a momentary groove that sounds as though it was recalled from the type of Cream session that produced \"I'm So Glad,\" but Mantler doesn't allow such relief to continue for long, antithetical as it would be to the Beckettian world he's conjuring. The songs aren't structured as pop pieces, however; they owe more to contemporary art songs despite the instrumentation, making the affair challenging to the listener expecting a rockish album but relatively easy compared to his earlier work with the Jazz Composer's Orchestra. The contributions by Cherry and Mantler's then-wife, Carla Bley, are crucial to the success of the album, each playing in a stark style that befits the matters at hand. No Answer is an unusually fine melding of theatrical text and music and one of Mantler's best efforts in this genre. Recommended.\n\nFROM THE TEXTS\n\nhard to believe too yes that I have a voice\n\nyes in me yes when the panting stops yes\n\nnot at other times no and that I murmur yes\n\nI yes in the dark yes in the mud yes for\n\nnothing yes I yes but it must be believed yes\n\nand the mud yes the dark yes the mud and\n\nthe dark are true yes nothing to regret there no\n\n...................\n\nso things may change no answer end\n\nno answer I may choke no answer sink\n\nno answer sully the mud no more no answer\n\nthe dark no answer trouble the peace no\n\nmore no answer the silence no answer die\n\nno answer DIE screams I MAY DIE screams\n\nI SHALL DIE screams good\n\nInstrumentation is sparse and somber, occasionally heavy on Bley's organ drone. Cherry's presence is comparatively brief, but he's his usual compelling, challenging self, the most distinctive trumpet voice around. Bley and Bruce carry the weight with virtuoso performances. ... This is music of great strength, created by a master composer who needs to be heard. Mantler's music demands the support of open, intelligent ears everywhere.\n\n- DOWN BEAT\n\n\"No Answer\" was a bold step into new territory. Jack Bruce, bassist/vocalist from rock group Cream, had proven himself much more than a pop singer on the epic \"Escalator Over The Hill\", Carla Bley's \"chronotransduction\", produced by Mantler between 1968 and 1971. On \"No Answer\" Bruce was given Samuel Beckett's tense/intense texts from \"How It Is\" to sing, Beckett is celebrated by some commentators for his grim humour. This, however, was never his appeal for Mantler: \"I don't care for what people see as the satirical side of Beckett. I don't like the way the plays are produced, for instance. I like to see Beckett's work on a page, printed almost graphically - as a series of events. True, 'Watt' itself is a very funny book, but I never considered putting it to music. I was always so much attracted by the dark side, that was always enough. Enough material for a long time, to stay with that.\"\n\nBruce's voice, multi-tracked, soars and dives through Beckett's blackest moods, tellingly set by Mantler. An extraordinary performance. There is also intense keyboard work from Carla Bley, without a trace of the whimsy cultivated in later years, and bubbling, speeding trumpet work from the late, great Don Cherry.\n\nIf you find it, buy this album!\n\nLabel: Solid State Records – SS 18055\n\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album / Country: US / Released: 1969\n\nStyle: Free Jazz, Avant-garde Jazz\n\nRecorded at Bell Sound, New York City on May 11/12, 1969.\n\nArt Direction – Frank Gauna\n\nPainting [Cover] – Hans Weingaertner\n\nMastered At – Bell Sound Studios\n\nProducer – Sonny Lester\n\nA - Is ...................................... 29:01\n\n(by – C.

This album gives you all of that. Corea, Holland, DeJohnette and a very very fierce pre-Headhunters Bennie Maupin, then there are also surprisingly free Woody Shaw and Hubert Laws. Legends one and all.\n\nAlthough the recording of Chick Corea’s “IS” sessions took place in May of 1969, the rhythm section, which consists of bassist Dave Holland, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and legendary Latin/hard-bop/fusion pianist Chick Corea, found its footing seven months earlier in the electric tone poems of the In A Silent Way sessions under Miles Davis’s leadership.\n\nThe “IS” sessions, is a great LP released on Solid State Records, which is a musical example of the exploratory sound of 1969. On IS, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette largely break into the “new thing” or avant-garde with the help of hard bop players Woody Shaw and Bennie Maupin, flutist Hebert Laws, and percussionist Horace Arnold.\n\nRecords begins with “Is” is a 28 minutes of free association, a free jazz opus which symbolizes the experimental attitude that was present in American music and society in the late ’60s.\n\n“Jamala” introduces the free-form style with which begins the second side of the album. The piece, composed by Holland, is over fourteen minutes of avant-garde ramblings, unstated tempos, and dissonant piano chord changes.\n\n“This” breaks into free jazz territory, with Maupin dodging in and out of Corea’s lines on electric piano. It’s not suprising that Corea’s soloing on “This” has the seemingly chaotic but controlled intonations of Herbie Hancock considering they both played in Miles Davis’s free bop quintet on Filles De Kilimanjaro. Over five minutes of “This” is dedicated to showing off the simultaneous improvisation between Holland and Corea.\n\n“It,” a 28 second classical duet between flutist Laws and Corea that is based on an original Corea composition called “Trio for Flute, Bassoon, and Piano.”\n\nThis music is 46 years old now. Just realize what has happened during this time in contemporary music - jazz or \"classical\": The borderline has completely vanished. Listen to 21st century contemporary music (\"classical\") - it sounds like Chick Corea in 1969.\n\nIf you find it, buy this album!\n\nLabel: Blue Note – BST 84135\n\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album / Country: US / Released: 1985\n\nStyle: Hard Bop, Improvisation\n\nRecorded on December 27, 1962 at Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nDesign [Cover] – Reid Miles\n\nLiner Notes – Peter Keepnews\n\nProducer – Alfred Lion\n\nRecorded By [Recording By] – Rudy Van Gelder\n\nThis album was scheduled for release as BST 84135 in 1963 but was never issued.\n\nIt first appeared as part of a Hubbard double album (BNLA 496-2) in 1976.\n\nIt is issued here for the first time with the original Reid Miles cover from 1963.\n\nA1 - Philly Mignon . . . . . . . . . . 5:28\n\n(by – Freddie Hubbard)\n\nA2 - Father And Son . . . . . . . . . . 6:34\n\n(by – Cal Massey)\n\nA3 - Body And Soul . . . . . . . . . . 6:25\n\n(by – Heyman, Eyton, Green, Sour)\n\nB1 - Nostrand And Fulton . . . . . . . . . . 7:07\n\n(by – Freddie Hubbard)\n\nB2 - Full Moon And Empty Arms . . . . . . . . . . 5:25\n\n(by – Kaye, Mossman)\n\nB3 - Assunta . . . . . . . . . . 7:05\n\n(by – Cal Massey)\n\nFreddie Hubbard – trumpet\n\nWayne Shorter – tenor saxophone\n\nCedar Walton – piano\n\nReggie Workman – bass\n\nPhilly Joe Jones – drums, percussion\n\nScheduled for release in 1962 and then effectively shelved until 1986, “Here To Stay” is another of the seminal Blue Note albums that failed to see the light of day at the time of recording. Perhaps this reflects the difficult choices that Albert Lion had to make too often in order to keep a small independent record label afloat.\n\n“Here To Stay” is a fine and early example of Freddie Hubbard, then aged only 24, as a fully formed imaginative voice in jazz. The band - Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone); Cedar Walton (piano); Reggie Workman (bass); Philly Joe Jones (drums) – offers an ideal platform; all these musicians except Philly Joe Jones were working together at the time with Freddie Hubbard in Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers and the understanding they had developed shows. But it is Freddie Hubbard’s trumpet playing that really impresses; no wonder that his inventiveness on the instrument is still so admired today.\n\n“Philly Mignon”, the opening track and a Freddie Hubbard composition is all about virtuoso trumpet licks, played fast, perhaps too fast. The other Freddie Hubbard composition on the album, “Nostrand And Fulton”, however is waltzy and fluid. “Father And Son”, the first of two Cal Massey compositions starts out as lightweight samba based bluesy ballad but then goes through interesting transitions, finally emerging as a loose-limbed good time feel blues. The second Cal Massey composition, “Assunta” has Wayne Shorter sounding very Coltrane-like and seems to be mainly a vehicle for him until Freddie Hubbard interjects with a characteristically fluent solo that changes the pace and direction. “Full Moon And Empty Arms” dates from 1946 and is based on a melody from the third movement of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor with words and arrangement by Buddy Kaye and Ted Mossman. It was recorded by Frank Sinatra and is not highly regarded. Freddie Hubbard and the band here go some way to rescuing it but without complete success.\n\nThe stand out track is a fine version of the standard “Body And Soul”. Comparison with Coleman Hawkins’ classic 1939 tenor sax version of the Johnny Green song or even with John Coltrane’s 1960 version on “Coltrane’s Sound” shows just how far Freddie Hubbard had come with a truly modern appreciation of the song and how to interpret it for trumpet.\n\n“Here To Stay” is a very welcome addition to the Freddie Hubbard catalogue and is highly recommended.\n\nIf you find it, buy this album!\n\nLabel: Blue Note – BLP 4176\n\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album / Country: US / Released: 1964\n\nStyle: Contemporary Jazz, Improvisation\n\nRecorded at the Barclay Studios, Paris, France, on June 2, 1964.\n\nDesign [Cover] – Reid Miles\n\nLiner Notes – Leonard Feather\n\nProducer, Photography By [Cover Photo] – Francis Wolff\n\nRecorded By – Jacques Lubin\n\nA - Tanya . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18:22\n\n(by – Donald Byrd)\n\nB1 - Coppin' The Haven . . . . . . . . . 11:18\n\n(by – Kenny Drew)\n\nB2 - Darn That Dream . . . . . . . . . . . . 7:33\n\n(by – DeLange, Van Heusen)\n\nDexter Gordon – tenor saxophone\n\nDonald Byrd – trumpet\n\nKenny Drew – piano\n\nNiels-Henning Orsted Pedersen – bass\n\nArt Taylor – drums, percussion\n\nDexter Gordon is often cited as a major influence on John Coltrane. He was the first to take Charlie Parker's alto sax bebop breakthroughs and understand how to develop them for tenor. Not that he is aiming at the same transcendent themes as Coltrane but rather that his musical understanding is a spur to playing sax in a more open and responsive way than heard before.\n\nThis openness and invention is heard at its best on “One Flight Up”. The album is remarkable for a host of reasons. It was recorded in Paris (not New Jersey) by musicians who had established themselves outside of the United States. On its initial release on vinyl, a single 18 minute track (“Tanya”) took up the whole of the first side – this some two years before Bob Dylan’s “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” amazed the pop world by taking up a whole side of the album “Blonde on Blonde”. And “One Flight Up” marks the early and definitive appearance of one of the few European jazz players to make it on a truly international stage – bass player Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, unsurprisingly known for short as NHOP.\n\nDexter had been successful with the 1963 Blue Note release “Our Man In Paris” (with Bud Powell (piano), Pierre Michelot (bass) and Kenny Clarke (drums), recorded at CBS studios Paris, as the title suggests. This in itself is often regarded as one of the great jazz albums in which Dexter’s style fully and freely emerges. Francis Wolff was keen to get more of Dexter’s output on disc and went to Paris to produce the “One Flight Up” sessions.\n\nLeonard Feather’s original album liner notes for “One Flight Up” refer to a round table discussion for “Down Beat” in 1964 in which Dexter Gordon and Kenny Drew (who plays piano on the album) talk about the advantages of being expatriates. Dexter had left the US in 1962 to take up a permanent residency at the Montmatre Club in Copenhagen. There he had recruited NHOP (then aged just 16) as bass player in his trio. Kenny Drew had moved to Paris in 1960, staying on after a six week role in the play “The Connection”. Both point out the freedom that they were able to discover in playing jazz away from the pressures of being back home. The most obvious advantage was the absence of racism – still a major problem for African Americans in the 1960s, as we have pointed out in discussing John Coltrane’s music. Miles Davis had had a similar experience when he had lived for awhile in Paris in 1957, shortly after recording ‘Kind Of Blue”.\n\nHe was there to make the soundtrack of Louis Malle’s film noir “Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud (Lift To The Scaffold)”, joining the Left Bank artistic set (which included Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir) and, by all accounts, having an affair with movie actress Juliette Grecco. (All this is documented in the remarkable book by Boris Vian - \"Manual of Saint Germain-Des-Pres\"). Miles has remarked on the shock of being for the first time looked upon as a musician and a person about whom his race was not the most important thing. Seven years later, Dexter Gordon experienced the same freedom that could enter his music once that context of racism has been removed: “I felt that I could breathe, and just be more or less a human being, without being white or black….”\n\nBut there was a second aspect of the freedom of being in Europe that was equally important; working at the same location with continuity of employment in the same job (Dexter at the Montmatre, Drew with long residencies in Paris) created the space in which artistic expression could flower away from the constant pressure of touring at home. The music of “One Flight Up” fully reflects this newfound freedom.\n\nFormally, this is expressed in the way the open, mainly modal, structures of “Tanya” and “Coppin’ The Haven” allow space for each musician to express himself, unhurried, untroubled by conventions of time and length, able to take just as much room as they wish to get their musical ideas over. The sound and feel is remarkably similar to that achieved on Miles’ “Kind of Blue”; the clarity of Donald Byrd’s trumpet and Dexter Gordon’s sax echoing Miles’ and John Coltrane’s earlier masterpiece.\n\n“Tanya”, a Donald Byrd composition, is built around a heavy asymmetrical beat from Art Taylor and features two counterposed themes, the first modal and free flowing and the second more structured and conventional. The modal theme tends to stoke up tension, the more conventional theme serving as release, capturing that early ‘sixties jazz urban optimism. The overall feel is one of well-being, of being at peace and in harmony with whatever life brings.\n\nAs in Lee Morgan’s “The Sidewinder” there is the feeling that for all the lack of restriction on what each soloist will contribute, every note is somehow necessary and that though the piece is indeed 18 minutes long, that length is fully justified. “Coppin’ The Haven” (a Kenny Drew composition) is very similarly structured and executed except that the pace is quicker and the sense of well-being is infused with a sense of urgency. On both tracks the quintet is heard in full. “On Darn That Dream” (a Dexter Gordon composition that did not make it the original release) Donald Byrd is absent.\n\nA key player here is Niels-Herring Orsted Pedersen. Indeed, following his death aged 58 in April 2005, the whole album could be taken not only as a fitting tribute to Dexter Gordon's legacy (he died in 1990) but also to NHOP's legacy. Barely 18 at the time of recording “One Flight Up”, NHOP already displays those hallmarks that would lead to his long and illustrious career in jazz, most notably his long membership of the Oscar Peterson Trio. As John Fordham notes in his obituary for \"The Guardian\", where most bass players pluck the strings with a single finger (or a single clump of fingers) NHOP has the strength and dexterity to pluck the strings with four fingers individually, much as a guitar player would pick the strings of that instrument. The result is a fluency and an ability to develop bass line runs with rapidity and complexity that is seldom heard on the instrument. This is heard to full effect on “Tanya” and “Coppin’ The Haven” where the bass forms almost a fourth solo instrument at the same time as it also takes up its rhythm duties. Indeed, so strong is the rhythm taken on by bass that Art Taylor’s drumming is freed up to launch into all sort of increasingly complex cross rhythms that build on the feeling of openness as the song progresses.\n\n“Darn That Dream” is a more conventional take on the jazz standard, taken as a late night, after hours piece. Donald Byrd is absent; there is more opportunity for Dexter to show off his lyrical side and excellent sax technique. Richard Cook and Brian Morton note that this track in particular shows the influence of Dexter’s playing on John Coltrane’s harmonic development at this time.\n\nOverall, this a great album, catching five fine musicians at a moment in their careers when the pressure was off and the barriers to creative expression had been lowered. Over fifty years later that discovery they found in this music still shines through.\n\nIf you find it, buy this album!"
