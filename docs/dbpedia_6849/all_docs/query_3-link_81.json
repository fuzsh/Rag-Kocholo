        "text": "At his most sophisticated, Van Heusen presents an angelic melody that is devilishly difficult for the novice jazz performer. Many exotic harmonic devices are used and are wedded to the melodic line in a way not often heard in this genre. In the melody, D ascends to Eb by way of an upper G, then from E natural to F. Underneath, the chord progression goes from the I (G major) to the bVI (Eb), functioning almost as a German augmented sixth chord in that it resolves to a ii7 that the ear would expect to continue on to V7 – I. Instead, Van Heusen delays this by going to a III7 (embellished by a ctÃ¸7 based on iiii7(b5) – necessary, because of the melody note, a chromatic lower neighbor of the leading tone). This, in turn, resolves to vi, from which Van Heusen writes an exotic harmonic progression: vi – I – II7 – iv. This is actually ascending, but because of the inversions created by the descending bass line, we are tricked into hearing it as a descending progression. The iv chord is followed by a ctÃ¸7 functioning as a iiÃ¸7 of ii. This begins what is basically a circle-of-fifths return to the tonic but, again, so cleverly disguised by chord substitutions that itâs nearly impossible to recognize it as such. The ctÃ¸7 (Bm7(b5) in the original key) resolves to a VI7 (E7) and from there goes to ii7 (Am7) at the start of the last phrase of section âAâ. The logical progression would then be V7 – I (D7 – G), but, instead, Van Heusen substitutes a bVII7 (F7) for the V7, then, instead of going back to I, he goes to iii (Bm7). This, of course, requires another circle of fifths in order to return comfortably to I, which is exactly what Van Heusen does (no substitutions this time, but several chord extensions).\n\nAfter such an exotic, winding trip down tonal paths seldom heard, the contrasting simplicity of section âBâ is almost a relief. The modulation from the first key to the second is fairly direct, using I – vii7 – III7 in which the vii7 becomes the pivotal ii7 of the new key (in the original, G – Fm7 – Bb7, winding up in Eb major). Section âBâ consists of two old stand-bys: I – vi – ii7 – V7 in the first two-measure phrase, followed by iii – VI7(b9) – ii7 – V7 in the consequent phrase. The first phrase is repeated, but then the ear is warned of a change when the iiiiâs are suddenly âtonicizedâ by a brief VII7 (V7/I in the new temporary key – Gm –D7 – Gm). Indeed, the song has returned to the parallel minor of the original key, but most listeners do not realize it until the following ii7 followed byV7 preceded by an embellishing +6 chord (Am – Eb7 – D7).\n\nThis song is one requiring a fair amount of study and preparation. The head should be learned thoroughly, and initial improvisations should focus on melodic embellishment (no easy task with a complicated melodic line like this one)."
