        "text": "Credits:\n\nKenny Drew 、 Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen\n\nDescription:\n\nA straight-ahead recording with the magnificent sound of the wood bass body and the trembling of the strings\" - HIROMI WADA, Lifetime, Pianist Kenny Drew and bassist Niels-Henning Elsted Pedersen, known for their many collaborations over the years, have recorded one of the most memorable piano & bass duo sessions in jazz history. On the first tune, a folk song \"In the Deep and Silent Woods,\" Pedersen's bass guitar provides a warm melody line that Drew's piano gently envelops. The delicate touch and deep resonance of the piano on the other trad songs, as well as standards, bossa, and originals, make for a brilliant interpretation of the music. The expressive bass playing by Bedelsen and the electric piano playing by Drew on the classic \"Hasha Bye\" are also worth listening to."
