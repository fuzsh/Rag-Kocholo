        "text": "As I sat in the Grunewaldsalen on Saturday night waiting for the Jan Lundgren concert to begin, it struck me that the fates have not been kind to Swedish jazz. Two of its greatest pianists left the world well before their time.\n\nMany of you will know of Esbjörn Svensson who died in a scuba diving accident in the Stockholm archipelago in 2008: only 44 years old. However Jan Johansson, who was killed in a car crash en route to a gig in Jönköping in 1968, only 37 years old, is probably a lot less known. His album Jazz på Svenska (Jazz in Swedish) is the best-selling album of all time by a Swedish jazz artist. It’s on Spotify and this thread is to encourage you to give it a listen. (He also wrote the theme tune to the Pippi Longstocking TV show, a song that every Swedish child knows.)\n\nJazz på Svenska was Johansson and bassist Georg Riedel playing traditional Swedish folk tunes but reinventing them with a jazz twist. Restrained, melodic, rhythmic and atmospheric. And not a honking saxophonist in sight. Jazz perhaps for those who feel lukewarm about wearing a black beret and smoking gitanes?\n\n1968? A bit bloody late for the Obituary thread!\n\nThe reason I mention it now is that the gig that I and The Duke and Duchess of DuCoolia were attending was a tribute to Johansson by Ystad pianist Jan Lundgren. (He’s been mentioned here before as a member of the Mare Nostrum trio.) The material was taken from the three albums in which Johansson reinvented the folk music of Sweden, Russia and Hungary. The line up was Lundgren on piano along with the very funky Mattias Svensson on double bass. However, unlike the original recordings, here they were complemented by strings: the four ladies of the Bonfiglioli Strang Quartet. So it was far more than merely a slavish copy of the original recordings.\n\nThere many gorgeous moments full of Nordic melancholy and other Djangoesque ones where the string quartet really swung. Despite being very technically accomplished, Lundgren is not a flamboyant player. The melody and exquisite chords always come first.\n\nSo off you go to YouTube, Spotify or your local record shop! Then put on Jazz på Svenska, close your eyes and, as dusk comes, disappear into the magic of the Swedish forests.\n\nMany classical conposers have used folk tunes in their compositions. Are there any other example of jazz musicians doing it?"
