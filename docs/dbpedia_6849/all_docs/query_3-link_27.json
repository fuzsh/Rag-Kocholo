        "text": "Jazz music and piano go hand-in-hand! You can’t talk about great jazz musicians without mentioning several jazz pianists. That’s why we’ve compiled this list of the greatest jazz pianists of all time!\n\nWe’ll explore the best jazz pianists from all eras—from the early jazz of the 1920s to contemporary jazz—and discuss why these virtuosic pianists were influential for piano players and all jazz musicians.\n\nBut before we dive into the 50 greatest jazz pianists of all time, here’s a quick question:\n\nDo you want to be the best jazz musician you can be but don’t know the steps to take to get there?\n\nThe Learn Jazz Standards Inner Circle helps you reach your full musical potential. We’ve got the jazz resources and passionate community to help you play piano (or any instrument) at your highest level and break through the practice plateaus that have held you back in the past.\n\nReady to improve in 30 days or less? Join the Inner Circle\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow We Determined Our List of the 50 Greatest Jazz Pianists of All Time\n\nIn general, jazz pianists already play piano at a high level. They usually have an intuitive—if not well-studied—understanding of music theory compared to piano players in other genres. As a genre, jazz asks many of its players (as you know, dear reader)!\n\nAny famous jazz pianist you can think of has worked hard and dedicated themselves to both the art of playing jazz and of playing piano.\n\nHowever, among all the great jazz piano players, there exists a group of genuinely exceptional piano players who pushed their craft in new directions and brought immense value to the jazz scene and the greater musical world at large.\n\nTo make this list of the best jazz pianists of all time, the entrants must be exceptional and offer something unique to the genre, whether through virtuosity, innovation, individuality, or inspirational stories.\n\nThe jazz pianists on this list propelled jazz forward into the future, even if they were in our past. That’s why we’ll be considering jazz pianists from the earliest eras of jazz up until the modern day.\n\nSo, with that explanation out of the way, let’s dig into the 50 greatest pianists to grace the jazz genre!\n\n1. Art Tatum\n\nimage source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nYears lived: 1909-1956\n\nEras of jazz: Swing Era\n\nSubgenres of jazz: Stride, Swing\n\nDespite inhabiting a relatively small stretch of jazz history, Art Tatum is regarded as one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time. His virtuosity and innovative use of harmonies and chord progressions were unparalleled for his time.\n\nHe was doing things on the piano in the 1930s and 40s that were harmonically and stylistically way ahead of his contemporaries. He certainly would go on to influence many of the other great jazz musicians on this list, including Lennie Tristano, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Mary Lou Williams.\n\nInspired by classical music and impressionism, Art Tatum incorporated chord extensions and alterations into his chord progressions at a time when general audiences were getting used to major 7th chords! He would also frequently utilize bitonality and counterpoint in his improvisations.\n\nBecause of his vast influence on the art of jazz piano and his relatively early position in jazz history, Art Tatum gets the number one spot! Check out Art Tatum playing live in 1943:\n\n2. Thelonious Monk\n\nimage source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nYears lived: 1917-1982\n\nEras of jazz: Bebop, Post-bop\n\nSubgenres of jazz: Bebop, Hard bop, Modern Jazz\n\nThelonious Monk is one of the most influential jazz pianists and composers. His significant contributions to jazz include his unique improvisational style and many jazz compositions, which make up a substantial percentage of the many jazz standards we know and love.\n\nSeriously! There is a clear pre-Monk and post-Monk line where jazz changed forever. In his day, Thelonius Monk wasn’t always revered by jazz critics. Despite some critical pushback against his independent style and voice, Thelonius Monk’s vision and pursuit of his own sound never wavered.\n\nHis unorthodox playing style and rhythmic idiosyncrasies breathed life into his infectious compositions, influencing the greater jazz idiom.\n\nThis prolific composer contributed these jazz standards to the repertoire:\n\nRound Midnight\n\nAsk Me Now\n\nBlue Monk\n\nStraight, No Chaser\n\nRuby, My Dear\n\nMonk’s Dream\n\nIn Walked Bud\n\nWell, You Needn’t\n\n… to name a few.\n\nCheck out Thelonious Monk playing his tune “Blue Monk” in Norway in 1966:\n\n3. Bill Evans\n\nimage source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nYears lived: 1929-1980\n\nEras of jazz: Cool Jazz, Post-bop\n\nSubgenres of jazz: Cool Jazz, Modal Jazz\n\nHere, we have another prolific composer and incredible improviser. Bill Evans’s contributions to jazz piano and jazz music are many. Bill Evans was a classically trained pianist who was swept up into the modal jazz scene in the 1950s.\n\nThis great pianist played alongside many other great jazz musicians, including Miles Davis on his Album “Kind of Blue” and Tony Bennet. His duo work with jazz guitarist Jim Hall is also notable.\n\nOf course, we must mention his work with his own band, the Bill Evans Trio, which included bassist Scott LaFaro, drummer Paul Motian, and later, bassist Gary Peacock and bassist Eddie Gomez. This trio set new standards for small jazz combo interplay and redefined what a piano trio could be.\n\nBill Evans was known for his intricate harmonic ideas and sensitive, lyrical playing, which were both inspired by the great impressionist pianists of the 19th century, like Ravel and Debussy.\n\nBill Evans’ compositions include:\n\nWaltz For Debby\n\nBlue in Green\n\nTime Remembered\n\nTurn Out The Stars\n\nCheck out Bill Evans relatively early on in his career in 1969:\n\n4. Herbie Hancock\n\nimage source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nYears lived: 1940-present\n\nEras of jazz: Post-bop, Fusion, Contemporary\n\nSubgenres of jazz: Post-bop, Jazz Fusion, Funk, Electronic Jazz\n\nHerbie Hancock is one of the most versatile and innovative figures in music, let alone jazz! Herbie Hancock is a rare jazz musician with crossover appeal in mainstream music. His work spans several jazz subgenres, from his hard bop work to jazz fusion and hip-hop.\n\nAs a band leader, he has released groundbreaking, genre-redefining albums like Maiden Voyage and Empyrean Isles to pioneering jazz fusion with Head Hunters, which featured all electric instruments.\n\nHerbie Hancock has won numerous awards, including multiple Grammys, and remains a significant influence on contemporary jazz, hip-hop, R&B, and funk.\n\nHis compositions include:\n\nDolphin Dance\n\nWatermelon Man\n\nCantaloupe Island\n\nMaiden Voyage\n\nTell Me A Bedtime Story\n\nChameleon\n\nCheck out Herbie Hancock playing his composition “Chameleon” live in 1974:\n\n5. Keith Jarrett\n\nimage source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nYears lived: 1945-present\n\nEras of jazz: Post-bop, Contemporary\n\nSubgenres of jazz: Post-bop, Free Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Solo Piano\n\nKeith Jarrett is acclaimed for his improvisational prowess and his work in both jazz and classical music. As a classically trained pianist, Keith Jarret often blends the two genres, where he sometimes improvises jazz and classical music seamlessly for well over an hour straight.\n\nHis solo piano concerts, particularly “The Köln Concert,” are landmarks in jazz history.\n\nKeith Jarrett is a player’s player. His ability to improvise and weave in and out of song forms makes him a well-studied example of the best piano (and jazz) have to offer.\n\nHe played alongside Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and drummer Jack DeJohnetteas a sideman. However, his most remarkable contributions to jazz came through his work with the Standards Trio and his solo performances, which raised the bar for piano trio playing and solo piano.\n\nCheck out Keith Jarrett live in Tokyo in 1984:\n\n6. Chick Corea\n\nimage source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nYears lived: 1941-2021\n\nEras of jazz: Post-bop, Fusion, Contemporary\n\nSubgenres of jazz: Post-bop, Jazz Fusion, Latin Jazz, Avant-garde Jazz\n\nIt’s time for a personal favorite of mine! A teacher once theorized that Chick Corea had perfect time like other musicians have perfect pitch. His technical ability on the piano is so incredible. Just listen to the second studio album, Now He Sings, Now He Sobs, and you’ll hear why.\n\nChick Corea was a pioneer in jazz piano playing. He was also an incredible composer and performer.\n\nChick Corea wrote and produced entire jazz concept albums, like The Leprechaun, and with his group Return To Forever, he basically defined Latin-inspired jazz fusion. He was also an excellent sideman, playing on Miles Davis’ “Bitches Brew,” which helped launch the jazz fusion genre.\n\nHere are some of his notable compositions, which are considered jazz standards:\n\nCrystal Silence\n\n500 Miles High\n\nSpain\n\nHumpty Dumpty\n\nCheck out Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea performing a duo concert! They have performed in this format many times over the years, and I was lucky enough to see them do it before Chick passed away in 2021.\n\n7.
