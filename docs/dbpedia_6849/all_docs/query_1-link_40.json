        "text": "“One of the most distinctive of all pianists” is just one of the descriptions accorded to Erroll Garner. His style has rendered him nearly immortal among jazz pianists. He says, “I just play what I feel. Suddenly I hit a groove that moves me, and then I take off.” Erroll even composes––you may remember a little tune called “Misty”––no easy feat, considering he never learned to read music! In fact, Misty is featured below with a rousing rendition of the perennial favorite I Get a Kick Out of You just above it … both from a 1963 concert filmed in Belgium for television broadcast. The classic Garner trio is rounded out, in both performances, by bassist Eddie Calhoun and drummer Kelly Martin.\n\nKeith Jarrett is probably the most animated piano player I’ve ever seen! If you’re not familiar with him, you’ll know what I mean from the very first note. Once you settle in with, arguably, one of the finest trios ever put together, Keith’s musical prowess will quickly prevail over any extracurricular exuberance you may witness at the keyboard. The trio is rounded out by Jack DeJohnette on drums and Gary Peacock on bass. The uppermost video is a slightly funky rendition of Billy Holiday’s God Bless the Child from Jarret’s Standards Live album. Below that, It Could Happen to You, recorded live in 1996 at Tokyo’s Hitomi Memorial Hall.\n\nWith her behind-the-beat phrasing and ironic interpretation of lyrics, Carmen McRae is considered one of the most influential jazz vocalists of the 20th century. Her heartfelt rendition of Monk’s ‘Round Midnight in 1962 (above) was only a precursor of the greatness to come. Carmen is joined here by pianist Norman Simmons, bassist Victor Sproles, and drummer Walter Perkins.\n\nNearing the end of her career in 1990, she performed one of my personal favorites –– On Green Dolphin Street –– in Tokyo (below left) at the Good Day Club, together with Eric Gunnison (p), Scott Colley (b), and Mark Pulice (d).\n\nIn 1980, during what some say was her “prime” (never figured how anyone can determine that, especially with the great ones), McRae paints some vivid word pictures (below right) with Miss Otis Regrets; she makes you feel like you personally missed a lunch date, but fortunately, we don’t have to miss Carmen’s impassioned performance of the Cole Porter tune.\n\nOn May 7, 2023 NEA Jazz Master pianist Kenny Barron and eight-time Grammy-winning bassist Christian McBride went to church –– to play, not to pray. That’s gospel! As part of Trinity’s music series, in association with Jazz House Kids, the dynamic duo played practically nonstop for more than an hour, to the delight of a packed houseful of fans and supporters.\n\nThe top-tune is Billy Strayhorn’s Isfahan, while below that, McBride performs a few finger gymnastics on the more familiar Body and Soul.\n\nRed Top is a wonderfully straight ahead jazz tune written by Lionel Hampton, performed by David “Fathead” Newman. Normally, I list the accompanying personnel, but this time, I couldn’t track anyone down––not even the singing drummer. On Newman’s Chillin’ album, everyone sounds so precisely the same that I will risk a guess, and list the group that appears on the album. Both the video and recording are circa 1998, so it may be a relatively safe bet. I’m guessing that in addition to “Fathead” on tenor, John Hicks played piano, Steve Novosel was on bass, Winard Harper on drums, and Bryan Carrott played vibes.\n\nThe second video is the familiar Blue Bossa and features “Fathead” Newman and Houston Person on dual tenor saxes, along with the Rein deGraaff Trio. It was also recorded in 1998, when they were entering their twilight years but still going strong!\n\nBarry Harris is part of an exceptional group of Detroit-bred jazz musicians, including Tommy Flanagan and Donald Byrd, who rose through the extraordinary arts education program in the public school system during the 1930s and 1940s. He took piano lessons from his mother at the age of four––a church pianist, she asked him if he was interested in playing church music or jazz. Fortunately for us, he chose jazz.\n\nIn his teens, he learned bebop largely by ear, imitating solos by Bud Powell, who along with Thelonious Monk was a strong influence on his playing. Early on, he developed an interest in passing the torch through education. Barry began teaching his musical theories as early as 1956, tutoring young, promising talent––all the while performing professionally with the likes of Miles Davis, Max Roach, and Lee Konitz. He has carried on the teaching tradition throughout his life.\n\nStill going strong in 2017 at the age of 88, his arrangement of A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square at Dizzy’s in New York is as unique as Barry Harris himself.\n\nThe Marsalis family’s musical gifts all flow from the “headwaters’ … an internationally renowned piano player named Ellis. Sons Wynton, Branford, Delfaeyo and Jason have all become famous in their own right, with Wynton and Branford each standing with one foot in jazz and the other in classical music. In the video, Ellis Marsalis is joined by Andrew Baham on trumpet, Derek Douget on sax, Gerald Watkins at the drums and Jason Stewart playing bass. The tune is Delilah, recorded in New Orleans at The Jazz and Heritage Center December 15, 2018. Below that is Beautiful Old Ladies, a tribute to older women from Ellis’s Whistle Stop album, featuring Branford Marsalis on soprano sax, Robert Hurst playing bass, Jeff Watts on drums and, of course, Ellis at the piano.\n\nI had never really listened to Benny Green until I came across some old Art Blakey Jazz Messenger’s recordings and focused my ears past the drums. It has been said that that “those who can’t do teach” … well, Benny Green teaches but is equally gifted as a performer, evidenced by the videos below. Topmost, Tempus Fugit is an uptempo Bud Powell composition, recorded at New York’s Lincoln Center, that features a trio of Green at the piano, David Wong on bass and Aaron Kimmel playing drums. Lower left is Me And My Baby. Lower right something called Cupcake. Both offer the trio of Benny playing piano, Ben Wolfe on bass and Carl Allen on drums."
