        "text": "Sonny Rollins\n\nThis season has produced a bumper crop of worthy live releases by Sonny Rollins. First came “Live in ’65 & ’68,” a gem from the latest series of “Jazz Icons” DVDs on Naxos (jazzicons.com). Consisting of a pair of concerts in Copenhagen originally taped for television broadcast, it finds Mr. Rollins, the great tenor saxophonist, in casual form but at a creative peak, improvising with an astonishing flow of ideas. In the loose but invigorating 1965 performance he digs in with Alan Dawson, a whip-smart and underdocumented Boston drummer, and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, a precociously nimble Danish bassist. The 1968 concert feels a bit more settled and less surprising, with Mr. Rollins and Mr. Orsted Pedersen alongside Kenny Drew on piano and Albert (Tootie) Heath on drums. In both instances there’s a deceptively breezy version of Mr. Rollins’s signature calypso “St. Thomas,” and he makes each feel like a fresh opportunity.\n\nSimilar magic unfolds on “Sonny Rollins in Vienne,” a new concert DVD, and “Road Shows: Vol. 1,” a compilation album. Released a few weeks ago on Doxy/Emarcy, they draw from the more recent past, a period of prodigious touring for Mr. Rollins and his working bands. The strongest stuff appears on “Road Shows,” a bonanza for admirers of latter-day Rollins (and perhaps a rejoinder to those who still pine for the Sonny of yore). One highlight is a restless ramble through “Easy Listening,” recorded in Warsaw in 1980. Another comes from last year’s Carnegie Hall concert with the drummer Roy Haynes and the bassist Christian McBride; it’s “Some Enchanted Evening,” a song whose title would seem to apply to most of the evenings captured here, and presumably more to come.\n\nJames Moody and Hank Jones\n\n“Our Delight” (IPO) is the wonderful new release by James Moody, a garrulous saxophonist and flutist, and Hank Jones, an unfailingly elegant pianist. Somehow it represents the first substantial collaboration by these veterans, who hail from roughly the same blessed era that produced Sonny Rollins. (Mr. Moody is 83, Mr. Jones 90; Mr. Rollins recently turned 78.) And while this is a straightforward effort, mainly consisting of tunes by Tadd Dameron and Dizzy Gillespie, it does much more than confirm bebop’s stature as the reigning old-masters language in jazz.\n\nBacked by an attentive bassist (Todd Coolman) and a sensible drummer (Adam Nussbaum), Mr. Jones and Mr. Moody find a conversational rhythm that works just as efficiently on a curtain raiser like the title track as it does on a sumptuous duo reading of “Body and Soul.”\n\nWhite Denim\n\nGarage rock gets another psychedelic makeover on “Exposion” (Transmission), the debut full-length album by this three-piece Austin band. Available as a download at whitedenimmusic.com, the album accurately captures a stagebound aesthetic that’s messy by design and constitutionally wary of settling into a single groove for too long.\n\nJames Petralli, the guitarist and lead singer, favors usefully opaque lyrics and an unhinged, forward-plunging style; on “IEIEI” he follows a clearly articulated verse with a pure-vowel chorus (basically the title, repeated eight times). Steve Terebecki, the bassist and backing vocalist, fills a dual role as anchor and counterpoint. And Joshua Block, the drummer, holds all the energy together. He’s an expert momentum-shifter, capable of driving a beat forward and then wriggling loose. Altogether on some of the more elaborate tracks, like “WDA” and “Don’t Look That Way at It,” the group gives the canny impression of knowing more than it lets on.\n\nKieran Hebden and Steve Reid\n\nSince teaming up a few years ago, Steve Reid, a seasoned free-jazz drummer, and Kieran Hebden, the British electronic programmer also known as Four Tet, have been known for long-form improvisations with a hypnotic lilt. “NYC” (Domino) isn’t an exception to that rule, but each of its six tracks feels noticeably contained. And in contrast to the duo’s previous three releases, this album was approached with some song fragments at hand. They still register as fragmentary, even unfinished: several tracks flesh out the same idea, layering the washy hum of Mr. Reid’s ride cymbal over a faintly industrial throb. But then the last two tracks, “Between B & C” and “Departure,” shift the dynamic more toward closeness and intricacy, with samples of acoustic string instruments setting the tone.\n\nMr. Hebden and Mr. Reid, who are due to appear on Dec. 12 at Le Poisson Rouge as part of the Wordless Music Series, seem likely to keep stretching toward the horizon in live settings. They might be on to something here too.\n\nBill Carrothers\n\nModern-jazz piano trio playing doesn’t get a whole lot better than on “Home Row” (Pirouet), by the pianist Bill Carrothers. Recorded in 1992 and subsequently shelved  Mr. Carrothers, who lives in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, hasn’t had the luckiest or most aggressive career  the album deserves consideration as a new product, especially since some of its more vibrant songs are originals. “Hope Song,” a darkly reflective ballad, fits into that category, and so does “A Squirrel’s Tale,” which takes a brighter and busier path. On those songs and a handful of well-selected others, Mr. Carrothers finds a strong chemistry with the bassist Gary Peacock and the drummer Bill Stewart, both of whom play directly to their strengths."
