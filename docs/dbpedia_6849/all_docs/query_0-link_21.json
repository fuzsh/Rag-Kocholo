        "text": "(1928–93). American jazz pianist Kenny Drew was the center of a largely African-American expatriate jazz colony that settled in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the 1960s.\n\nDrew was born on August 28, 1928, in New York, New York. He began studying classical piano at age 5 and attended the High School of Music and Art in New York City. He was influenced early by such pianists as Fats Waller, Teddy Wilson, and Art Tatum, and later by Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, and throughout his career there were elements of both swing and bop in his playing. During the 1950s Drew accompanied and recorded with several of the major jazz artists of the time. After a brief period on the West coast of the United States, he went to Paris, France, in 1961, and in 1964 he moved to Denmark and settled in Copenhagen, where he became house pianist at the Montmarte Jazzhus. There he began an association with the Danish bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, with whom he performed and recorded extensively. Drew later took up composing and orchestrating and was involved in music publishing and recording industries. His son, Kenny Drew, Jr., also became a jazz pianist. Drew died on August 4, 1993, in Copenhagen. (See also black Americans.)"
