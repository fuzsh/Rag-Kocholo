They made three joint recordings, Duo in 1973, Duo 2 and Duo Live in Concert in 1974. We in Pori Jazz could enjoy their live performance on July 12, 1974. We can easily return back to that gig by listening those albums.\n\nKenny Drew (1928-1993) died twenty years ago, August 3, 1993 at the age of close to 65. He was born in New Your, but moved to Europe already 1961, first to Paris and three years later to Copenhagen, where he had his home the rest of his life.\n\nNHØP (1946-2005), also called “The Great Dane with the Never-Ending Name” was a generation younger than Drew, but their musical styles matched brilliantly together. He played practically with all the great jazz musicians of his time. Pedersen was far too young to die on heart failure at the age of 58."
