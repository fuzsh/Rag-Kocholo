Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, May 27, 1946 – April 19, 2005) was a Danish jazz bassist known for his impressive technique and an approach that could be considered an extension of the innovative work of Scott LaFaro. Born in Osted, near Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, Pedersen was known as The Great Dane with the never-ending name, or more simply as NHØP.

NHØP was an extraordinarily gifted double bass player, who died far too young. Fortunately he left a large catalog of recordings. For those new to his work, a good staring place is the album Chops, with Joe Pass on guitar.
