This is a list of what I consider to be the very best of a collective of some of the funniest, most creative animation done, ever. In fact, in the world of 7 minutes, no one has or ever will be as good as the guys at Termite Terrace in the 40s, 50s and 60s. A list of the best Looney Tunesc cartoons is exactly as hard and subjective as it sounds, and so I open the list to the public. Add what you think is missing and vote on what you think are the best. I know it's hard. God, I know. So...much...funny.

By skillfully merging iconic melodies with clever gags and memorable characters, this groundbreaking cartoon has become an essential part of animation history. Enjoy the delightful synergy between high culture and timeless humor that makes Rabbit of Seville an enduring masterpiece.

Rabbit of Seville is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short released in 1950. It was directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The cartoon, in a plotline reminiscent of Stage Door Cartoon, features Bugs Bunny being chased by Elmer Fudd into the stage door of the Hollywood Bowl, whereupon Bugs tricks Elmer into going onstage, and participating in a break-neck operatic production of their chase punctuated with gags and accompanied by musical arrangements by Carl Stalling, focusing on Rossini's overture to The Barber of Seville. Stalling's arrangement is remarkable in that the overture's basic structure is kept relatively intact; some repeated passages are removed and the overall piece is conducted at a faster tempo to accommodate the cartoon's standard running length. In 1994 it was voted #12 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.

Why Should I Stream? Indulge in the cleverly crafted animation masterpiece that is Duck Amuck, which brilliantly breaks the fourth wall and showcases beloved characters in a distinctive visual style. This innovative short film pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling techniques, earning its reputation as one of the greatest cartoons ever created by both critics and fans alike. Witness for yourself why this groundbreaking work continues to endure in popular culture.

Duck Amuck is a surreal animated cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons. The short was released in early 1953 by The Vitaphone Corporation, the short subject division of Warner Bros. Pictures, as part of the Merrie Melodies series. It stars Daffy Duck, who is tormented by a seemingly sadistic, initially unseen animator, who constantly changes Daffy's locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance and even shape. Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny. In 1994, it was voted #2 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, losing only to What's Opera, Doc?, also made by Chuck Jones and also written by Michael Maltese. It remains one of the most notable Warner animations, and has been inducted into the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Highly regarded for its exceptional artistry, superb orchestral arrangements, and side-splitting humor, this animated short film remains a celebrated piece in popular culture.

What's Opera, Doc? is a 1957 American animated cartoon short in the Merrie Melodies series, directed by Chuck Jones for Warner Bros. Cartoons. The Michael Maltese story features Elmer Fudd chasing Bugs Bunny through a parody of 19th-century classical composer Richard Wagner's operas, particularly Der Ring des Nibelungen, Der Fliegende Holländer, and Tannhäuser. It borrows heavily from the second opera in the "Ring Cycle" Die Walküre, woven around the standard Bugs-Elmer conflict. Originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. on July 6, 1957, What's Opera, Doc? features the speaking and singing voices of Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan as Bugs and Elmer, respectively. The short is also sometimes informally referred to as ''Kill the Wabbit'' after the line sung by Fudd to the tune of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries", the opening passage from Act Three of Die Walküre. In 1994, What's Opera, Doc? was voted #1 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by 1,000 members of the animation field.
