Background notes: The dog Marc Antony first appeared in the cartoon Feed The Kitty from 1952, where he found by the kitten Pussyfoot. Taken in by the kitten that did not fear him and went to sleep on his back, he tried to get permission to keep the kitten. Marc Antony and Pussyfoot appeared in five cartoons, the last one being Cat Feud from 1958 (voice by Mel Blanc). Except for Feline Frame-Up from 1954 where Claude Cat appeared, Marc Antony and Pussyfoot never interacted with the other Looney Tunes in the cartoons, and after Cat Feud, the two were only seen in reruns like The Bugs Bunny Show and The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show.

Outside the cartoons, Marc Antony appeared in several places, contrary to Pussyfoot. According to the information currently available, Marc Antony and Pussyfoot did not appear in comics until 1995 in Looney Tunes #15 from DC Comics, and so far it has only been a few appearances. It should be noted, that Marc Antony has appeared in more stories than Pussyfoot, and in the comics he appears with characters like Sylvester Pussycat and Elmer Fudd. Merchandise like the comics is also only a handful of appearances, and he appears on several items along with Looney Tunes characters other than Pussyfoot.
