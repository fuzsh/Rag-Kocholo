Great Chuck Jones short starring lesser-known Looney Tunes characters Claude Cat and bulldog Marc Antony. It's the third short featuring the two fighting over a little kitten called Pussyfoot. Claude pushes the kitten around and Marc Antony beats him up in return, only to be scolded by their master. So Claude gets Marc Antony kicked out of the house but that doesn't stop the bulldog from finding ways to get at him. What a fun cartoon. The animation is lovely with bright colors and well-drawn characters and backgrounds. The music is lively and whimsical. The gags are cleverly done and very funny. It's an excellent cartoon that I definitely recommend you take a look at. These characters may not be among the more famous ones but they work together well. If that final line doesn't make you laugh, nothing will.
