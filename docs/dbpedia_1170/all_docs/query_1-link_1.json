Television\n\nShorts:\n\nWarner Bros. CartoonsOriginal releaseNetworkABCReleaseSeptember 20, 1964 ( ) –\n\nSeptember 2, 1967 (1967-09-02)\n\nThe Porky Pig Show is an American television anthology series hosted by Porky Pig, that was composed of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoons made between 1948 and 1964. The series aired on ABC Saturday mornings from 1964 to 1967, with 26 half-hour episodes created. The show occasionally aired in the early 2000s as part of Cartoon Network's Boomerang 1964 block (on both channels), as well rerunning on Canal 5 in Mexico in the 2010s.\n\nEach show began with a newly animated title sequence featuring a theme song by Barbara Cameron, in which Porky welcomes his friends into a barn to dance and watch his show. Following the three cartoons featured on the program (the first one always featuring Porky, and few of which would be featured on any incarnation of The Bugs Bunny Show until the 1990s), a closing sequence played in which Porky's friends say goodbye and promise to return the following week. The opening and closing were produced by Hal Seeger Productions. Warner Bros. had shut down their own cartoon studio in the previous year.\n\nNo. 1st cartoon 2nd cartoon 3rd cartoon Original air date 1 Often an Orphan Mice Follies The Super Snooper September 20, 1964 ( ) 2 Awful Orphan Bell Hoppy Wild Wife September 27, 1964 ( ) 3 Scaredy Cat Baton Bunny Feather Dusted October 4, 1964 ( ) 4 The Wearing of the Grin The Unexpected Pest Which is Witch？ October 11, 1964 ( ) 5 Thumb Fun Ready, Woolen and Able Wise Quackers October 18, 1964 ( ) 6 The Prize Pest Room and Bird Early to Bet October 25, 1964 ( ) 7 Drip-Along Daffy Too Hop to Handle Chow Hound November 1, 1964 ( ) 8 The Pest That Came to Dinner Goldimouse and the Three Cats Two Crows from Tacos November 8, 1964 ( ) 9 Dog Collared Strife with Father Feline Frame-Up November 15, 1964 ( ) 10 My Little Duckaroo A Fox in a Fix Much Ado About Nutting November 22, 1964 ( ) 11 Fool Coverage The Bee-Deviled Bruin Go Fly a Kit November 29, 1964 ( ) 12 Bye, Bye Bluebeard The Lion's Busy Speedy Gonzales December 6, 1964 ( ) 13 An Egg Scramble Mouse and Garden Punch Trunk December 13, 1964 ( ) 14 Dime to Retire Bad Ol' Putty Tat Kiss Me Cat December 20, 1964 ( ) 15 Jumpin' Jupiter A Hound for Trouble Of Rice and Hen December 27, 1964 ( ) 16 Boston Quackie A Bear for Punishment The EGGcited Rooster January 3, 1965 ( ) 17 Porky Chops It's Hummer Time Mouse Warming January 10, 1965 ( ) 18 Boobs in the Woods The Hypo-Chondri-Cat Mixed Master January 17, 1965 ( ) 19 Riff Raffy Daffy Swallow the Leader Three Little Bops January 24, 1965 ( ) 20 Dough for the Do-Do Gopher Broke Pizzicato Pussycat January 31, 1965 ( ) 21 Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century Sleepy Time Possum The Honey-Mousers February 7, 1965 ( ) 22 Paying the Piper Caveman Inki Lumber Jerks February 14, 1965 ( ) 23 Deduce, You Say Heir-Conditioned Cat's Paw February 21, 1965 ( ) 24 Rocket Squad By Word of Mouse West of the Pesos February 28, 1965 ( ) 25 China Jones Rabbit Rampage Mouse Mazurka March 7, 1965 ( ) 26 Cracked Quack A Ham in a Role Sheep Ahoy March 14, 1965 ( )\n\nEpisode #1 of The Porky Pig Show was released on DVD, as part of Warner Home Video's Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1960s, Volume 1 two-disc set, on May 26, 2009.
