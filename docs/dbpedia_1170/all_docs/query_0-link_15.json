        "text": "Warner Bros.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc\n\nDirected by: Chuck Jones\n\nCat Out of the Bag Alert! This review contains some spoilers for this film!\n\nSynopsis: Claude the Cat takes pleasure in pushing around poor little Pussyfoot, but Marc Antony the bulldog is ready to defend the kitten even if it costs him his place in the house.\n\nCartoon Cats: This cartoon features two very different animated cats. First is the adorable Pussyfoot the kitten, whose gender changes from short to short (here Pussyfoot appears to be female).\n\nAnd then there is Claude the cat. Claude is a yellow cat who appeared in several Warner Bros. Looney Toons shorts pre-dating Pussyfoot’s appearance by a number of years. In previous appearances, Claude was timid and meek but not so here.\n\nKitty Carnage Warning! Claude the cat is brutal to Pussyfoot, kicking her off her pillow in the very first scene.\n\nThere is one moment when Claude holds Pussyfoot up to show Marc Antony and then gives her a hard flick to the head with his finger. Claude then dumps Pussyfoot into a clear vase and leaves her.\n\nAll this behavior somewhat justifies the fact that Marc Antony literally beats the crap out of Claude every chance he gets.\n\nEarly on, Claude tricks their owner by placing Pussyfoot inside Marc Antony’s mouth, making it look as if he is trying to eat the kitten.\n\nThe owner constantly throws Marc Antony outside to keep him from hurting Claude, but Marc Antony keeps finding ways to get to the cat.\n\nIn the end Marc Antony gets Claude to confess, Pussyfoot is restored to her rightful place on the pillow and Claude gets kicked out of the house instead.\n\nFinal Mewsings: Cats are not immune to karma.\n\nRelevant Links:"
