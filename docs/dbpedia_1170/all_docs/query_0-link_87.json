        "text": "MERRIE MELODIES: STARRING BUGS BUNNY AND FRIENDS\n\nWritten by Kevin McCorry\n\nIn honour of Bugs Bunny's fiftieth birthday in 1990, a television series of 65 half-hour instalments composed of Warner Brothers cartoons was released in syndication, that is directly to individual television stations, by Warner Brothers Domestic Television, to supplement the ABC television network's Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show. The 65 instalments were intended to be run 5 days per week over a 13-week time period from September 17 to December 14, 1990 and then aired an additional 7 times until September, 1992.\n\n\"Show Biz Bugs\", \"Bowery Bugs\", \"To Hare is Human\", and \"Rebel Rabbit\" were some of the Bugs Bunny cartoons in the Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends cartoon package.\n\nThis television series was given the name of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends because the more familiar Looney Tunes title had become the property of the Nickelodeon specialty cable television channel. Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends' format differed from that of Looney Tunes On Nickelodeon in that one Bugs Bunny cartoon was featured in every three-cartoon instalment. Most post-1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon shorts not in the Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show cartoon package between September, 1990 and September, 1992 were to be seen on Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends. Exceptions were \"Rabbit Every Monday\", \"Knights Must Fall\", \"Bedevilled Rabbit\", \"Backwoods Bunny\", \"Rabbit's Feat\", \"Bugsy and Mugsy\", \"A Witch's Tangled Hare\", \"Pre-Hysterical Hare\", and \"Which is Witch\". Those Bugs Bunny cartoons were to be televised by Nickelodeon from September of 1990 to September of 1992.\n\nBefore the third cartoon in most of the Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends instalments was a clip from one of the cartoons in other episodes in the television series. So that all instalments of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends would be of uniform length, these clips varied from 30 seconds to as long as 2 minutes depending on the length of the three cartoons composing each episode. All clips were introduced with the Tasmanian Devil coughing from his mouth the letters that spelled \"Another Hip Clip\". There were no \"Hip Clips\" in Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends instalments 2, 19, 21, 35, 38, 55, and 56.\n\nNearly all of the Road Runner cartoons directed by Rudy Larriva, including \"Boulder Wham!\", \"Shot and Bothered\", and \"Clippety Clobbered\", were in the Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends cartoon package.\n\nThe package of cartoons allocated to Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends included a number of Bugs Bunny cartoons that for censorship or other reasons never were in the offering for Saturday morning U.S. television network broadcast, including \"Bugs and Thugs\", \"Rebel Rabbit\", and \"Bushy Hare\". Also in the Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends cartoon package were most of the Rudy Larriva-directed Road Runner cartoons and nearly all of the Tweety cartoons that between September, 1990 and September, 1992 were not part of The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show. A quite large amount of the cartoons assembled for the Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends television series were those of Daffy Duck and Porky Pig.\n\n\"14 Carrot Rabbit\", \"Dog Collared\", \"Pop 'im Pop!\", and \"Duck! Rabbit, Duck!\" are some of the cartoons from which excerpts were used for the opening to Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends.\n\nOpenings to the 65 episodes of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were directed by Darrell Van Citters and showed Bugs jumping out of the Warner Brothers' concentric circles and producing a square containing a classic cartoon scene with a particular character or characters. The character or characters shown would vary from episode to episode. Some of the clips used were of Yosemite Sam (from \"14 Carrot Rabbit\"), Porky Pig (from \"Dog Collared\"), Sylvester and Sylvester Jr. (from \"Pop 'im Pop!\"), Daffy Duck (from \"Duck! Rabbit, Duck!\"), and Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk (from \"The EGGcited Rooster\"). Always, Daffy Duck would appear beside Bugs and jealously try to replace the pictured character in the square with himself or to remove the square from the camera's view, only to be defeated either when the pictured character retaliates, or when the square strikes Daffy in the face or propels him upward.\n\nMost cartoons shown would keep their original title card and crew and director credits, but not their Warner Brothers introduction, original Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies logo, or \"That's All, Folks!\" ending. One exception in the latter regard was \"Stop! Look! And Hasten!\", which did retain its closing visuals of the Road Runner's cloud trail composing the \"That's All, Folks!\" line.\n\nA number of cartoons on Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were only titled, not credited, them being some of the cartoon shorts from the late 1940s (\"Daffy Dilly\", \"Scaredy Cat\", \"The Foghorn Leghorn\", \"You Were Never Duckier\"), which had had their crew and director credits removed when reissued for theatres in the late 1950s, and the retitled \"Prince Violent\", now \"Prince Varmint\", for which the revised title was printed on plain, brown background (the titling utilised for that cartoon in its appearances in episodes of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show in the late 1970s and early 1980s).\n\nThe 65 syndicated episodes of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends boldly contained several cartoons that have since then disappeared from circulation due to racial or ethnic stereotypes. Cartoons like \"Caveman Inki\" and \"Wise Quackers\", now for all intents and purposes banned from television, were distributed between 1990 and 1992 on Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends with little or no cutting. However, cuts for violence were standard procedure, as they were on The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show. The censors for Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were not squeamish about electric shocks or head-pounding producing lumps, but gunshot scenes in the Rabbit-Season/Duck-Season trilogy and several other cartoons were excised using still-frame cutaways at the time of gunfire. Cannon gags in \"The Rebel Without Claws\", \"Captain Hareblower\", and \"This is a Life?\" were trimmed. And \"Big House Bunny\" underwent major revision to eliminate the scene in which (Yosemite) Sam Schultz hangs in a noose.\n\nBelow is an episode guide for the 65 episodes of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends that were run in syndication between September, 1990 and September, 1992. \"Hip Clips\" are only provided for those episodes in which they are clearly remembered by this writer.\n\nIn \"Bugs and Thugs\", Bugs Bunny tricks gangsters Rocky and Mugsy into hiding inside of an oven from a faked-by-Bugs police raid of the gangsters' hideout, and Bugs then proceeds to open the gas valve in the oven and trigger an explosion of the gas by way of a lit match thrown into the oven. And when the police arrive for real at the hideout, Bugs is able to bamboozle the criminals into hiding in the oven again and then repeats the explosion of the oven with use of the same procedures.\n\nSeason 1\n\nCartoons in episodes of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends do not correspond in the same way as those in weekly (i.e. one show per week) television series like The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show. Shared elements are seldom within same or consecutive episodes. They are spread over the instalments comprising a week or in episodes in consecutive weeks. A cartoon in a Monday episode may have things in common with a cartoon or cartoons in an episode on the succeeding Monday, or a cartoon on a Tuesday may contain aspects of association with one of the same week's Thursday or Friday episode. Hence, this article will not do an episode-by-episode analysis and will be rather sporadic in noting cartoon similarities.\n\nFour of the five Bugs Bunny cartoons in the first week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were \"High Diving Hare\", with Bugs being ordered by Yosemite Sam to perform a high diving act, \"The Hasty Hare\", with Bugs foiling an attempted abduction of him by Marvin Martian and K-9, \"Bully For Bugs\", in which Bugs fights a bull, and \"Hillbilly Hare\", wherein Bugs hoodwinks a pair of Ozark brothers into a square dance that becomes increasingly violent for the two yokels.\n\nThe first week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends was composed of the following cartoons: \"High Diving Hare\", \"Claws For Alarm\", and \"Fast and Furry-ous\" of Show 1; \"Often an Orphan\", \"Mouse Wreckers\", and \"The Hasty Hare\" of Show 2; \"Bully For Bugs\", \"Tweet and Sour\", and \"Henhouse Henery\" of Show 3; \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\", \"My Bunny Lies Over the Sea\", and \"One Froggy Evening\" of Show 4; and \"From A to Z-z-z-z\", \"Gee Whiz-z-z-z!\", and \"Hillbilly Hare\" of Show 5. Included in the preponderance of Chuck Jones-directed classics in this first week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were the inn motif in \"Claws For Alarm\" (the forsaken Dry Gulch Hotel) and in \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (Elmer Fudd's olde English lodgings), the incidence of Scotland in Charlie Dog's conveyance by mail to that place's Highlands and return as a jovial bagpiper to Porky Pig's Stateside farm (\"Often an Orphan\") and in Bugs' shenanigans on a golf course near Loch Lomand in \"My Bunny Lies Over the Sea\", and the yokel implication of Angus McCrory's bullet that has, \"been in (his) family for ye-e-e-r-r-r-s,\" (\"My Bunny Lies Over the Sea\") that accords with the Ozark Mountain men who declare a feud with a square-dance-calling Bugs in Robert McKimson's \"Hillbilly Hare\".\n\nSome other items of interest in the first week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends are the repeated letter Zs in the titles of \"From A to Z-z-z-z\" and \"Gee Whiz-z-z-z!\", the olde English scroll found with Michigan J. Frog in \"One Froggy Evening\" by the hapless construction worker, which coincides with the time period setting of \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\", Bugs as an Indian in \"High Diving Hare\" foreshadowing Ralph Phillips' imagined encounter with savage redskins in \"From A to Z-z-z-z\", and the frontier town backdrop to the ordeals of Bugs in \"High Diving Hare\" and Porky and Sylvester in Dry Gulch in \"Claws For Alarm\". Two of the Road Runner cartoons in Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends' first week involve Wile E. Coyote dressing as a super-hero, Superman in \"Fast and Furry-ous\" and Batman in \"Gee Whiz-z-z-z!\". Feline sanity is under question in \"Claws For Alarm\" and \"Mouse Wreckers\". An eager-to-please dog (Charlie, K-9) is featured in \"Often an Orphan\" and \"The Hasty Hare\" respectively.\n\nThe cartoons of week 2 were \"Mutiny On the Bunny\", \"Deduce, You Say\", and \"Much Ado About Nutting\" of Show 6; \"Mouse-Taken Identity\", \"Rabbit Fire\", and \"To Beep or Not to Beep\" of Show 7; \"Frigid Hare\", \"Kiss Me Cat\", and \"Dog Collared\" of Show 8; \"Bill of Hare\", \"Lovelorn Leghorn\", and \"The Hypo-Chondri-Cat\" of Show 9; and \"Daffy Dilly\", \"Stooge For a Mouse\", and \"What's Opera, Doc?\" of Show 10. \"Mutiny On the Bunny\" recalls Marvin Martian's fussing about insubordination by K-9 (after Bugs suggests that Marvin's faithful cohort may have mutinous intent) in week 1's \"The Hasty Hare\". In \"To Beep or Not to Beep\" is a Greco-Roman catapult used by Wile E., preceding the ancient Rome scenario of \"Roman Legion-Hare\" in Show 11 in week 3. Three cartoons in Show 8, \"Frigid Hare\", \"Kiss Me Cat\", and \"Dog Collared\", all have a be-kind-to-animals theme. Both Bugs and Porky befriend an affectionate animal (a penguin, a slobbering dog) that wishes for their constant company, and Marc Anthony is obliged to protect little Pussyfoot from an aggressive and unprincipled mouse (which whips Pussyfoot into pulling a mini-chariot like a Roman slave, with hint to the coming of \"Roman Legion-Hare\").\n\nMore second week peculiarities are a butler motif in \"The Hypo-Chondri-Cat\" as Claude Cat pretends to be butler to home-intruding rodents Hubie and Bertie: \"Will there be anything else, gentlemen?\" This motif recurs in \"Daffy Dilly\", wherein Daffy must combat the stodgy servant of a dying millionaire for access to the ailing magnate's bedroom, and in \"Golden Yeggs\" of Show 11, with Rocky's butler: \"Your laundry, sir.\" Pill-popping Claude Cat's belief that he is terminally ill in \"The Hypo-Chondri-Cat\" also associates with the situation of the really sick millionaire of \"Daffy Dilly\".\n\nThe contents of the third week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were \"Roman Legion-Hare\", \"Golden Yeggs\", and \"Scaredy Cat\" of Show 11; \"Little Boy Boo\", \"Dough Ray Me-Ow\", and \"Show Biz Bugs\" of Show 12; \"Transylvania 6-5000\", \"Bear Feat\", and \"Zip 'n Snort\" of Show 13; \"Curtain Razor\", \"Weasel While You Work\", and \"Bugs and Thugs\" of Show 14; and \"Robot Rabbit\", \"Dog Gone South\", and \"Putty Tat Trouble\" of Show 15. Week 3 contained the following things of interest: riches, the prospect thereof, in \"Golden Yeggs\" and \"Dough Ray Me-Ow\", lions in \"Roman Legion-Hare\" that succeed Sylvester's in-museum, stuffed-lion peril in Show 7's \"Mouse-Taken Identity\", explosive concoctions in \"Little Boy Boo\" and \"Show Biz Bugs\", Daffy and the show-business-eager wolf's mortal and hell-bound consumption of explosives in an act that can only be done once, in \"Show Biz Bugs\" and \"Curtain Razor\" respectively, and the motif of a circus in the Three Bears' antics in \"Bear Feat\" and the high-diving dog's performance for talent agent Porky in \"Curtain Razor\", involving a plunge into a drinking glass, which Elmer Fudd will do in the following week's (Show 18's) \"His Hare-Raising Tale\". Nocturnal stays in a spooky setting are a commonality of \"Scaredy Cat\" and \"Transylvania 6-5000\". Afterlife is posited in the climaxes of \"Dough Ray Me-Ow\", \"Show Biz Bugs\", and \"Curtain Razor\".\n\nAlso in week 3, gangster Rocky appears in two cartoons, \"Golden Yeggs\" and \"Bugs and Thugs\". Ice and snow provide the background to the events of \"Weasel While You Work\", \"Putty Tat Trouble\", and \"Duck! Rabbit, Duck!\" (Show 16 in week 4), and Wile E.'s ice-making machine freezes him in Show 16's \"Zoom at the Top\". It is interesting that the first two Tweety cartoons on Merrie Melodies, \"Tweet and Sour\" (Show 3) and \"Putty Tat Trouble\" (Show 15), contest Sylvester with a one-eyed, orange tabby for possession of the \"itty birdie\", and \"Putty Tat Trouble\" and the next Tweety cartoon on the show, \"Snow Business\" (Show 25), are winter-timed and contain scenes in which Sylvester uses a long-neck ashtray to extinguish his smoking tail. Furthermore, \"Scaredy Cat\" in Show 11 is the second Porky Pig and Sylvester cartoon to air on a Monday, \"Claws For Alarm\" having been in Show 1.\n\nThe cartoons included in week 4: \"Duck! Rabbit, Duck!\", \"Zoom at the Top\", and \"Wild Wild World\" of Show 16; \"The Slap-Hoppy Mouse\", \"Wholly Smoke\", and \"Sahara Hare\" of Show 17; \"Stork Naked\", \"Feline Frame-Up\", and \"His Hare-Raising Tale\" of Show 18; \"Broom-Stick Bunny\", \"A Sheep in the Deep\", and \"Jeepers Creepers\" of Show 19; and \"Feather Dusted\", \"Ready.. Set.. Zoom!\", and \"Rabbit's Kin\" of Show 20. Week 4 contained cartoons having a tea scene, with Bugs (in disguise as an ugly sorceress) and Witch Hazel in \"Broom-Stick Bunny\" and Bugs and Pete Puma (in the goofy guise of Mrs. Rabbit) in \"Rabbit's Kin\". A carrot dangling on a string, from a fishing rod in two cases, is used to catch Bugs in \"Broom-Stick Bunny\" and in week 5's \"Spaced-Out Bunny\" (Show 22) and \"Rabbit Romeo\" (Show 23). In \"Zoom at the Top\", Wile E. Coyote attempts and fails to bear-trap the Road Runner, and a multiple amount of the same device is utilised by un-expectant father Daffy with intent of preventing a \"sloshed\" stork's delivery in \"Stork Naked\".\n\n\"Rabbit Romeo\", \"The Iceman Ducketh\", and \"Bowery Bugs\" were three of the five Bugs Bunny cartoons in the fifth week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends. Bugs is not attracted to the female Slobovian rabbit that Elmer Fudd is trying to please, Daffy hunts for fur in the Klondike and believes that Bugs' pelt will be sufficient, and Bugs tells the story of Steve Brody, jumper from the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nWeek 5's content cartoons were \"A Star is Bored\", \"An Egg Scramble\", and \"Yankee Dood it\" of Show 21; \"Stupor Duck\", \"Spaced-Out Bunny\", and \"Caveman Inki\" of Show 22; \"Strife With Father\", \"Highway Runnery\", and \"Rabbit Romeo\" of Show 23; \"The Iceman Ducketh\", \"Of Rice and Hen\", \"Porky Pig's Feat\" of Show 24; and \"I Gopher You\", \"Bowery Bugs\", and \"Snow Business\" of Show 25. \"Rabbit Romeo\", \"The Iceman Ducketh\", and \"Snow Business\" involve the onset of winter. Prehistory is a shared time-setting of \"Caveman Inki\" and week 4's \"Wild, Wild World\" (Show 16). The Mynah bird of \"Caveman Inki\" and Beaky Buzzard in \"Strife With Father\" are both black-plumed fowl of voracious species, although Beaky is too bashful to be an aggressive hunter in \"Strife With Father\". Egg-hatching occurs in \"Strife With Father\" and \"Highway Runnery\". A hotel with a disagreeable proprietor in \"Porky Pig's Feat\" is similar in its undesirability to Porky's predicament in \"Dime to Retire\" (Show 27 in week 6) as guest of Daffy's troublesome inn. Bugs poses as an Irish constable to Steve Brody in \"Bowery Bugs\", and police-officer-on-patrol Porky in Show 27's \"Riff Raffy Daffy\" shouts with an Irish accent when angered. Bugs, dressed as a damsel, plays \"drop the handkerchief\" with Brody, as too does Miss Prissy with her beloved Foghorn Leghorn in \"Of Rice and Hen\".\n\nWeek 6's instalments were as follows: Show 26 with \"Ballot Box Bunny\", \"Boulder Wham!\", and \"Gone Batty\"; Show 27 with \"Riff Raffy Daffy\", \"Apes of Wrath\", and \"Dime to Retire\"; Show 28 with \"Strangled Eggs\", \"A Fox in a Fix\", and \"Person to Bunny\"; Show 29 with \"Baby Buggy Bunny\", \"Out and Out Rout\", and \"Pappy's Puppy\"; and Show 30 with \"A Bear For Punishment\", \"Porky's Pooch\", and \"This is a Life?\". \"Gone Batty\" and \"Dime to Retire\" reference circuses in that Bobo the Elephant's appearance on the baseball pitcher's mound as Sweetwater Schnooks' relief-hurler prompts members of the opposing team to comment that, \"This is a ball game, not a circus,\" and Porky resists the attack of a lion by use of a chair a la big top lion tamer. Elephants also appear in both cartoons. \"Boulder Wham\" further suggests carnival feats in Wile E.'s attempt to walk, with a circus balancing stick in his hand, across a rope and his use of a trampoline. The very windy weather of \"Out and Out Rout\" thematically accords with the ACME tornado seeds in \"Whoa, Be-Gone!\" (Show 33 in week 7), and these two Road Runner cartoons were both in same episodes of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour. \"Person to Bunny\" and \"This is a Life?\" are both television show parodies, with celebrity Bugs as the centre of attention. Incidence of Father's Day in \"A Bear For Punishment\" is reminiscent of Butch J. Bulldog's parenthood in \"Pappy's Puppy\".\n\nThe cartoons included in the seventh week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends were \"Wild and Woolly Hare\", \"Bell Hoppy\", and \"Rocket Squad\" of Show 31; \"Quack Shot\", \"Captain Hareblower\", and \"The Leghorn Blows at Midnight\" of Show 32; \"Tom Tom Tomcat\", \"Whoa, Be-Gone!\", and \"The Hasty Hare\" of Show 33; \"The Prize Pest\", \"Bewitched Bunny\", and \"The Mouse That Jack Built\" of Show 34; and \"Cracked Quack\", \"Roman Legion-Hare\", and \"Kiddin' the Kitten\" of Show 35. Week 7's proximity to Halloween accounts for the presence in its instalments of \"Bewitched Bunny\" (Witch Hazel's connection to the night of ghouls is obvious), \"The Prize Pest\" (Daffy's Jekyll-and-Hyde act and Porky's ghastly costume), the every-mouse's-nightmare scenario of \"The Mouse that Jack Built\", and Bugs' assumption that Marvin Martian and K-9 are trick-or-treaters in \"The Hasty Hare\". \"The Prize Pest\" has a relationship to \"The Ducksters\" of Show 39 in week eight: Porky is a contestant in radio game programmes of which Daffy is the prize in the former and the host in the latter. A marshland's large fish threatens trouble to Elmer Fudd in \"Quack Shot\", and Yosemite Sam, carrying a black-ball bomb, is swallowed by a huge fish in \"Captain Hareblower\".\n\nThe component cartoons of week 8 were \"Rabbit Seasoning\", \"Stop! Look! And Hasten!\", and \"The Honey-Mousers\" of Show 36; \"A Fractured Leghorn\", \"Paying the Piper\", and \"My Bunny Lies Over the Sea\" of Show 37; \"The Super Snooper\", \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Bunny\", and \"Goo Goo Goliath\" of Show 38; \"To Hare is Human\", \"The Ducksters\", and \"Go Fly a Kit\" of Show 39; and \"Little Red Rodent Hood\", \"Shot and Bothered\", and \"Ballot Box Bunny\" of Show 40. The use of mice to spoof a television show, The Honeymooners, in \"The Honey-Mousers\" accords with the same practice, The Jack Benny Programme being the spoofed subject, in Show 34's \"The Mouse That Jack Built\". Jack Benny was also a radio personality, thus further associating Show 34 with Show 39. \"Paying the Piper\" and \"Little Red Rodent Hood\" are based on fairy tales. Porky is a player of a pipe in \"Paying the Piper\", and Bugs meets bagpiper Angus McCrory in \"My Bunny Lies Over the Sea\". Youth or babyhood and childhood innocence are a shared theme of \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Bunny\", \"Goo Goo Goliath\", and \"Go Fly a Kit\".\n\nWeek 9's cartoons consisted of \"Southern Fried Rabbit\", \"Double or Mutton\", and \"Crockett-Doodle-Do\" of Show 41; \"Greedy For Tweety\", \"Gopher Broke\", and \"Hillbilly Hare\" of Show 42; \"False Hare\", \"Beep Prepared\", and \"Chow Hound\" of Show 43; \"Boston Quackie\", \"Bill of Hare\", and \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" of Show 44; and \"Big House Bunny\", \"Rocket-Bye Baby\", and \"The Coy Decoy\" of Show 45. In this week are cartoons referencing crime (\"Boston Quackie\") and incarceration (\"Big House Bunny\"), which accord with week 10's \"The Unmentionables\" (Show 47). Cafes of Franco-European ambiance are elements of \"Bill of Hare\" (Bugs' pretended Shish Kabob Emporium) and \"Boston Quackie\" (the dining establishment patronised by Daffy \"Quackie\" and Mary). In \"Boston Quackie\", there is a component of the Cloak and Dagger Express, called \"Electrique Chair Car\", which appropriately precedes the electric chair sequence of \"Big House Bunny\". An added note on the motif of the European \"eatery\": \"A Hound For Trouble\" that transpires in an Italian restaurant is featured in Show 49 on the following week. Also pertinent in this regard is the Luigi's Diner coin-tossing scene of \"Early to Bet\" in Show 47. Sylvester is hospitalised and medicated in \"Greedy For Tweety\", and the Goofy Gophers' \"psychological wearing-down process\" results in the barnyard dog's swallowing of \"E-Z Doze It\" sleeping pills. In \"Chow Hound\", another animal requires medical attention: the \"flimflam Fido\" bulldog who is the victim of his own excessive appetite for meat.\n\nThe episodes of week ten: Show 46 with \"Bonanza Bunny\", \"Chaser On the Rocks\", and \"Cats A-Weigh!\"; Show 47 with \"You Were Never Duckier\", \"The Unmentionables\", and \"Early to Bet\"; Show 48 with \"Pop 'im Pop!\", \"Frigid Hare\", and \"Bugged By a Bee\"; Show 49 with \"Horse Hare\", \"Porky's Bear Facts\", and \"A Hound For Trouble\"; and Show 50 with \"Rebel Rabbit\", \"Run, Run, Sweet Road Runner\", and \"The EGGcited Rooster\". Beverages with ice are referenced in \"Bonanza Bunny\" by Bugs' order of, \"...a straight shot of carrot juice, over the rocks,\" in the Dawson City Malibu Saloon and in the title of \"Chaser On the Rocks\". Aboriginal Americans are frequent figures in week 10: the attack on Fort Lariat in \"Horse Hare\", Bugs' sale of Manhattan to the Indians in \"Rebel Rabbit\", Wile E.'s rain dance in \"Run, Run Sweet Road Runner\", and Henery Hawk's \"Injun\" costume in \"The EGGcited Rooster\". Cement is used to weight Bugs' feet by Rocky and Mugsy in \"The Unmentionables\", and a construction worker is frustratingly attempting to establish a newly cemented sidewalk in \"Pop 'im Pop!\".\n\nMore observations on the tenth week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends: the gambling-by-cards between Bugs and Blacque Jacque Shellacque in \"Bonanza Bunny\" accords admirably with the effect of the Gambling Bug in \"Early to Bet\" and the antics of Bugs and Nasty Canasta in Show 51's (week 11's) \"Barbary-Coast Bunny\"; the wagering \"profession\" is also mentioned by Rocky (\"Oh, yeah, well, I'm the bookie here, and I'll do the booking.\") in \"The Unmentionables\"; Bugs is imprisoned in \"Rebel Rabbit\", echoing his predicament as an inmate at Sing Song Prison one week earlier in \"Big House Bunny\" (Show 45) and in \"The Unmentionables\" in this week's Show 47; \"Bugged By a Bee\", the tale of Cool Cat's timely athletic energy surges born of stings by a bee appears to be linked by thorny antagonist to the ill-fated honey-gathering endeavour of Pa and Junior Bear in Show 54's \"The Bee-Deviled Bruin\".\n\nThe cartoons included in week 11: \"Barbary-Coast Bunny\", \"Lickety-Splat\", and \"Sleepy-Time Possum\" of Show 51; \"The Foghorn Leghorn\", \"Porky's Movie Mystery\", and \"A Star is Bored\" of Show 52; \"Tweet Zoo\", \"Wideo Wabbit\", and \"Don't Give Up the Sheep\" of Show 53; \"People Are Bunny\", \"War and Pieces\", and \"The Bee-Deviled Bruin\" of Show 54; and \"The Daffy Duckaroo\", \"Sock a Doodle Do\", and \"Lighter Than Hare\" of Show 55. More savage Native Americans wreak havoc in two cartoons in week 11, \"Wideo Wabbit\" and \"People Are Bunny\", both set in a television studio in which Bugs respectively heckles Elmer Fudd and Daffy Duck and in the guise of an usher directs his hunting rifle-toting foes into a room wherein a violent, historic confrontation with Indians is being reenacted. In \"Sock a Doodle Do\", the barnyard dog tricks Foghorn Leghorn into looking through a \"telescopic\" tube at a literal \"flying saucer\" propelled directly into Foghorn's face, a gag that corresponds with the alien-invasion-of-Earth premise of \"Lighter Than Hare\". A wildcat released by Ralph Wolf from a box near to Sam Sheepdog in \"Don't Give Up the Sheep\" accords with Sylvester's encounter with the untamed lion in \"Tweet Zoo\". Wile E. Coyote's use of invisible paint in \"War and Pieces\" connects with Ralph Crumden's false invisible ink in \"Cheese it, the Cat!\" (Show 58 in week 12). In \"Barbary-Coast Bunny\", Bugs mistakes one of Nasty Canasta's gambling casino slot machines for a \"tele-o-phone\", and in \"Lickety-Splat\", a hammer falling onto Wile E.'s head causes his eyes to roll like the symbols of a slot machine and register, \"Tilt\".\n\nWeek 12's five instalments consisted of \"Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol\", \"Raw! Raw! Rooster!\", and \"Just Plane Beep\" in Show 56; \"Freudy Cat\", \"Baby Buggy Bunny\", and \"The Lion's Busy\" in Show 57; \"Bushy Hare\", \"Porky and Daffy\", and \"Cheese it, the Cat!\" in Show 58; \"The Slick Chick\", \"Apes of Wrath\", and \"Puss N' Booty\" in Show 59; \"Wise Quackers\", \"Clippety Clobbered\", and \"The Windblown Hare\" in Show 60. Foghorn Leghorn and Bugs Bunny endure the misery of care taking what at first seems to them to be an innocent minor in \"The Slick Chick\" and \"Baby Buggy Bunny\". Bugs is erroneously transported by a drunken stork to a a maternal gorilla in \"Apes of Wrath\" and is inadvertently delivered by the same bird (albeit not inebriated) to a mother kangaroo in \"Bushy Hare\". Wile E.'s use of war surplus equipment in \"Just Plane Beep\" is reminiscent of Bugs' construction of a robot from military left-over materials in Show 55's (week 11's) \"Lighter Than Hare\". In \"Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol\", Yosemite Sam as Scrooge is stacking coins rather like the money accumulated by Bugs in Canasta's place of gambling in \"Barbary-Coast Bunny\" (Show 51) is piled.\n\nThe thirteenth and final week of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends was composed of the following cartoons: \"14 Carrot Rabbit\", \"The Pest That Came to Dinner\", and \"Tired and Feathered\" of Show 61; \"The High and the Flighty\", \"Two's a Crowd\", and \"A-Lad-in His Lamp\" of Show 62; \"The Dixie Fryer\", \"Prince Varmint\", and \"Mouse-Warming\" of Show 63; \"The Rebel Without Claws\", \"Woolen Under Where\", and \"Rabbit Seasoning\" of Show 64; and \"Hare-Abian Nights\", \"To Itch His Own\", and \"Bye, Bye, Bluebeard\" of Show 65. \"A-Lad-in His Lamp\" and \"Hare-Abian Nights\" have Arabian settings, and Daffy Duck is bottled like a genie at the end of \"The High and the Flighty\". Early Americana is referenced by the slavery theme and Daffy's Lincoln disguise in Show 59's \"Wise Quackers\" in week 12 and by the U.S. Civil War of \"The Rebel Without Claws\". The sword worn by the executioner in \"The Rebel Without Claws\" has the same belt attachment aspect as that of \"Prince Varmint\". \"Mouse-Warming\" and \"Bye, Bye, Bluebeard\" involve a mouse being swallowed and escaping the mouth of his wishful devourer through mouse-eater Claude or Bluebeard's front tooth or teeth, which are opened and shut like doors. Pierre, the mightiest termite, and Mighty Angelo, the World's Strongest Flea- two tiny insects with potent muscles, respectively bedevil Porky Pig in \"The Pest That Came to Dinner\" and a swaggering, irritable bulldog in \"To Itch His Own\".\n\nShow # 1 Yosemite Sam high diving in a Wild West carnival, Porky and Sylvester staying for a night at the creepy Dry Gulch Hotel, and a chase by Wile E. Coyote of the Road Runner onto a freeway cloverleaf are aspects of this show. \"High Diving Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Claws For Alarm\" with Porky Pig and Sylvester \"Hip Clip\" from \"Bye, Bye, Bluebeard\" with Porky Pig \"Fast and Furry-ous\" with Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote Show # 2 Happily canine-less farmer Porky is beset with pushy Charlie Dog seeking a master, rodents Hubie and Bertie contrive to trigger mental collapse in Claude Cat so that they can have carefree residence in Claude's house, and Marvin Martian and his assistant, K-9, come to Earth to obtain a living subject of study and hereby choose Bugs, who commandeers their flying saucer after enwrapping them in straightjackets. \"Often an Orphan\" with Porky Pig and Charlie Dog \"Mouse Wreckers\" with Claude Cat, Hubie, and Bertie \"The Hasty Hare\" with Bugs Bunny, Marvin Martian, and K-9 Show # 3 Bugs emerges victorious against his bovine foe in a bullfight ring, Sylvester acts to protect Tweety from an orange cat's hungry clutches, for Granny has threatened a violin string fate for Sylvester should any harm befall Tweety, and Henery Hawk is lectured by Foghorn Leghorn on the necessity of \"starting small\" in his quest for chicken flesh. \"Bully For Bugs\" with Bugs Bunny and the Bull \"Tweet and Sour\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny \"Hip Clip\" from \"Sahara Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Henhouse Henery\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk Show # 4 A construction worker discovers a frog that will sing only for him and thus frustrates his aim of attaining fame and fortune by exhibiting the tuneful amphibian, Bugs plays golf with a short-tempered Scot, and Daffy reads to Warner Brothers mogul J. L. the scripted Merry Olde English saga of the Scarlet Pumpernickel, played ineptly by Daffy. \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" with Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Elmer Fudd, Henery Hawk, and Mama Bear \"My Bunny Lies Over the Sea\" with Bugs Bunny and Angus McCrory \"One Froggy Evening\" with Michigan J. Frog Show # 5 Ralph Phillips slips in and out of flights of daydream fantasy in the middle of school classes, Wile E.

Coyote's catapult repeatedly drops a boulder on top of him, and Sylvester and Sylvester Jr. encounter baby kangaroo Hippety Hopper, which they mistake for a giant mouse, while they are in mouse-catcher Sylvester's museum workplace. \"Mouse-Taken Identity\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper \"Rabbit Fire\" with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd \"To Beep or Not to Beep\" with Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote Show # 8 Bugs errs on his vacation route to Miami Beach and finds himself in Antarctica, where he protects a penguin from capture by an Eskimo. With a magnifying glass, bulldog Marc Antony proves that his kitten friend, Pussyfoot, is capable of scaring all of the infesting rodents from the house of Marc and Pussyfoot's master. Porky's kindness toward a big, slobbering dog results in his inability to lose the overly affectionate canine. \"Frigid Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and the Penguin \"Kiss Me Cat\" with Marc Antony and Pussyfoot \"Dog Collared\" with Porky Pig Show # 9 Rolling pin in hand, Miss Prissy seeks a husband- Foghorn Leghorn; the Tasmanian Devil, having broken loose from a crate on a pier, carnivorously pesters carrot-basting Bugs, who lures Taz on a quest for moose meat into a train tunnel- containing a train, of course; and two mice, wishing to have unopposed occupancy of Claude Cat's home, convince hypochondriac Claude Cat that he is seriously ill and in desperate need of an operation to be performed by them- an operation that they deceive Claude into believing to have killed him and resulted in his rise by balloon to Cat Heaven. \"Bill of Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Tasmanian Devil \"Lovelorn Leghorn\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Miss Prissy \"Hip Clip\" from \"A Bear For Punishment\" with the Three Bears \"The Hypo-Chondri-Cat\" with Claude Cat, Hubie, and Bertie Show # 10 Daffy endeavours to gain entry to an ailing millionaire's mansion in order to provoke laughter in the wealthy one before his death and is blocked from entering the lavish house by the millionaire's stodgy butler. A mouse wishing Sylvester's removal from impeding his attainment of a block of cheese deceives Mike Bulldog into thinking Sylvester to be a provocative foe. Finally, Elmer's hunting of Bugs is parodied to the pretentiousness of Wagnerian opera. \"Daffy Dilly\" with Daffy Duck \"Stooge For a Mouse\" with Sylvester and Mike Bulldog \"What's Opera, Doc?\" with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd Show # 11 Emperor Nero commands Roman Legionnaire Yosemite Sam to obtain a victim, Bugs, to feed to the Colosseum lions, but the big cats maul and eat Sam and the Emperor; Daffy is content to accept responsibility and acclaim for producing the golden egg really laid by a goose, that is until Rocky the mobster abducts and orders Daffy by gunpoint to lay more such eggs; and murderous mice instill terror in Sylvester who is residing with blase Porky in an old, spooky house. \"Roman Legion-Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Golden Yeggs\" with Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and Rocky \"Hip Clip\" from \"Zoom at the Top\" with Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote \"Scaredy Cat\" with Porky Pig and Sylvester Show # 12 Foghorn Leghorn shakes \"boy genius\" Egghead Jr.'s chemical concoction and is recipient of a violent explosion, Daffy, desperate to win against Bugs in a competition for theatre audience approval, swallows highly volatile fluids for a sensational act that can only be performed once, and a parrot connives to eliminate the stupid house cat with whom he shares his master's home and who precedes him in inheriting their master's affluent legacy. \"Little Boy Boo\" with Foghorn Leghorn, Miss Prissy, and Egghead Jr. \"Dough Ray Me-Ow\" with Louie the Parrot and Heathcliff the Cat \"Hip Clip\" from \"Stupor Duck\" with Daffy Duck \"Show Biz Bugs\" with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck Show # 13 A Transylvanian bloodsucker cannot better Bugs in a war of magic words, Papa Bear's aspirations to being a circus performer are ruined by his many-accident-causing son and by a decidedly out-of-date newspaper, and Wile E. Coyote's failed Road Runner-procurement ploys include a hand grenade in a toy aeroplane, a cannon positioned on the edge of a cliff, and axle grease rubbed onto his feet. \"Transylvania 6-5000\" with Bugs Bunny and Count Bloodcount \"Bear Feat\" with the Three Bears \"Zip 'n Snort\" with Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote Show # 14 Bugs hails a taxi in the city and unwittingly enters the getaway car of bank robbers Rocky and Mugsy, who bring Bugs to their hideout where Bugs impersonates a policeman to dupe the villains into hiding inside a gas oven, which Bugs explodes, and Rocky and Mugsy surrender to the real police to avoid further injury by Bugs. Talent agent Porky views several oddball acts, including a wolf's self-destruction by ingesting a variety of explosive substances. Foghorn Leghorn frolics in winter ice and snow while engaging in a war of pranks with the barnyard dog and avoiding the \"greedy, little choppers\" of a foraging-for-food, hyperactive weasel. \"Curtain Razor\" with Porky Pig \"Weasel While You Work\" with Foghorn Leghorn and the Weasel \"Bugs and Thugs\" with Bugs Bunny, Rocky, and Mugsy Show # 15 Modern technology fails to facilitate farmer Elmer Fudd's elimination of the rabbit raider of his carrot patch, Charlie Dog proposes a pet-and-master relationship to an uninterested and fiery Southern Colonel, and in the wintry city, Tweety flees Sylvester and an orange putty tat onto a frozen park pond and cuts the ice around the cats so that they fall into frigid water and become flu-stricken. \"Robot Rabbit\" with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd \"Dog Gone South\" with Charlie Dog and Colonel Shuffle \"Hip Clip\" from \"To Itch His Own\" with Angelo the Mighty Flea and Bulldog \"Putty Tat Trouble\" with Tweety and Sylvester Show # 16 Elmer Fudd stalks rabbit and duck in a winter wilderness, uncertain of what particular animal that it is the season to hunt, Wile E.

Coyote \"Gone Batty\" with Bobo the Elephant Show # 27 Nighttime winter constable on patrol Porky finds vagrant Daffy loitering inside of the cosy display window of a closed- for-business department store and acts to remove the duck from the establishment. An inebriated, feathered bringer of a baby gorilla to expectant parents loses his tiny bundle and selects Bugs as a replacement for the infant simian, and the father ape is violently agitated by the rabbit son that he neither wants nor loves.

Lastly, Daffy bristles jealously at the attention given to Bugs by Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person television show. \"Strangled Eggs\" with Foghorn Leghorn, Henery Hawk, and Miss Prissy \"A Fox in a Fix\" with the Scheming Fox \"Person to Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd Show # 29 A diminutive, baby-disguised bank robber acts to retrieve his \"dirty money\" after the sack thereof accidentally falls into Bugs' subterranean abode, Wile E.

Marvin Martian's abduction of Earth creature Bugs as a living subject of study, is foiled by Bugs, who enwraps Marvin and Marvin's assistant, K-9, in straitjackets and hence attains control of their flying saucer. \"Tom Tom Tomcat\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny \"Whoa, Be-Gone!\" with Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote \"Hip Clip\" from \"Weasel Stop\" with Foghorn Leghorn and the Weasel \"The Hasty Hare\" with Bugs Bunny, Marvin Martian, and K-9 Show # 34 Halloween show consists of Daffy's Jekyll-and Hyde split personality ploy to frighten his grudging house host Porky into providing for Daffy's every whim for fear of evoking Daffy's monstrous alter-ego, Bugs' battle against Witch Hazel, who wants to cannibalise Hansel and Gretel, and Jack Benny's dream that he and Mary Livingstone are mice lured into the maw of a cat that is disguised as the Kit-Kat Club where mouse Benny aims to play his violin. \"The Prize Pest\" with Porky Pig and Daffy Duck \"Bewitched Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and Witch Hazel \"The Mouse That Jack Built\" with Jack Benny Mouse Show # 35 Daffy's sneaky choice of winter quarters is the cosy dwelling of Porky Pig and Porky's intruder-sensing-and-hating dog; Emperor Nero commands Captain of the Roman Guards Yosemite Sam to find a victim to feed to the Colosseum's hoard of lions- and though Sam selects Bugs as the meal for the big cats, the lions instead opt to dine upon Sam and the Emperor; lazy, fat, pampered pussy Dodsworth, ordered by his mistress to \"round up\" all of the mice in their home, deceives a kitten into doing the work on the pretence that he is giving to the kitten valuable instruction and practicum in the catly art of rodent capture. \"Cracked Quack\" with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig \"Roman Legion-Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Kiddin' the Kitten\" with Dodsworth the Cat Show # 36 Daffy has \"pronoun trouble\" when trying to convince Elmer that it is rabbit season rather than duck season for hunting, Wile E. Coyote's Burmese tiger trap, intended to capture the Road Runner, spawns a real tiger, and Ralph Crumden, his wife, Alice, and his friend, Ned Morton (all mice) try with such insufficient contrivances as Ralph inside of an empty can and Ralph and Ned within a mechanically propelled \"Trojan dog\", to pass an orange cat in order to acquire food from a refrigerator, until spunky Alice shows to the male mice how feline impediments can be eliminated with feminine bravado and a single punch. \"Rabbit Seasoning\" with Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, and Daffy Duck \"Stop! Look! And Hasten!\" with Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote \"The Honey-Mousers\" with the Honey-Mousers Show # 37 A worm is desired as food or as bait for food by both Foghorn Leghorn and a cat. Porky's pied piping purpose of ridding Hamelin of its infesting rodents infuriates the town's cats, whose leader endeavours in the guise of a giant mouse to prove Porky incapable of completing this job and to hereby preserve feline relevance and honour in Hamelin.

Coyote's electronic brain advises him on how best to capture Bugs, and each time, the elaborate schemes fail, with explosive or crushing results for Wile E.; a radio game show is wretched for Porky, who must suffer the punishments for incorrect answers to questions posed by sadistic host Daffy; and a flying cat, whose tail acts as a propeller, defends a female feline from a belligerent bulldog. \"To Hare is Human\" with Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote \"The Ducksters\" with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig \"Go Fly a Kit\" with Bulldog and the Flying Cat Show # 40 A young mouse dreams that he is Little Red Riding Hood and that Sylvester is the Big Bad Wolf, with their confrontation occurring inside of a house and Sylvester being defeated by the mouse's cunning and hurriedly constructed contraption- a miniature Army tank. Wile E. Coyote's ploys to stop and catch the Road Runner with a tennis net, dynamite suspended on a rope, and a bomb which the helium-inflated Wile E. tries to drop from high altitude, are all complete failures. Violence escalates as virtuous Bugs and dishonest Yosemite Sam electioneer as rival candidates for mayor in a small town. \"Little Red Rodent Hood\" with Sylvester \"Shot and Bothered\" with Road Runner and Wile E.

Foghorn Leghorn escorts genius boy chick Egghead Jr. to the forest to teach him about scouting and woodcraft- real Davey Crockett stuff, but it is Foghorn who learns lessons of creating whistles and smoke signals, starting fires, triggering rainfall, and setting traps, from the prodigious Egghead. Ralph Wolf in the guise of Little Bo Peep, succeeds at tricking Sam Sheepdog into permitting him to claim possession of one of Sam's lambs, but Ralph has an unpleasant surprise when his planned mutton dinner removes its carcass to reveal a certain irate canine. \"Southern Fried Rabbit\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Double or Mutton\" with Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog \"Hip Clip\" from \"High Diving Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Crockett-Doodle-Do\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Egghead Jr. Show # 42 Sylvester, Tweety, and a bulldog are all hospitalised with broken legs and under the care of Granny, who is a nurse; the Goofy Gophers move to reacquire vegetables plucked from the farm garden beneath which the gophers live and believe all growing legumes to belong to them, by covertly giving to the barnyard dog guarding the harvested vegetables cause to doubt his sanity; and Bugs loves mountain music, particularly when it is he who sings the lyrics, for a square dance pitting his enemies, two hillbillies, violently against one another. \"Greedy For Tweety\" with Tweety, Sylvester and Granny \"Gopher Broke\" with the Goofy Gophers \"Hillbilly Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and the Martin Brothers Show # 43 Big Bad Wolf and his nephew try to lure Bugs to his doom and to their hungry bellies on the pretence of Bugs joining Club del Canejo, a club for rabbits, with Big Bad and his young kin disguised as bunnies in brotherhood with Bugs and scheming in vain to impale Bugs in an iron maiden and to fire him out of a cannon. A gluttonous bully bulldog will resort to any deception- with a cat and a mouse as his intimidated stooges- to acquire meaty foodstuffs- until such time as he has eaten so much cow flesh that he is obesely in need of immediate medical attention.

Coyote's face by a cactus, and Wile E.'s invisible paint does not protect him from being struck by a beep-beeping truck; and Pa Bear wishes to obtain honey from a bee's nest up in a tree- a painfully futile task when his assistant is his clumsy, dimwit son. \"People Are Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck \"War and Pieces\" with Road Runner and Wile E.

Starting in September, 1992, a new package, or new season, of Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends instalments was distributed only to affiliates of the Fox Network in the U.S. and contained such cartoons as \"Pancho's Hideaway\" and \"Trip For Tat\" and no longer featured ethnically or racially risque cartoons like \"Caveman Inki\", \"Horse Hare\", \"Wise Quackers, or \"Tom Tom Tomcat\". \"Rebel Rabbit\" was cut to remove its scene in which Bugs returns Manhattan to the Indians. \"Chow Hound\" had its ending snipped by the Fox censors. For the new season of instalments starting on Fox affiliates in September, 1992, the opening to Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends was changed and showed Bugs Bunny being awoken by his alarm clock and dashing out of his hole in a scramble not to be late for his television show. He runs onto the Warner Brothers production lot and nearly collides with several of his fellow cartoon celebrities before reaching a set, running in front of the Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends television series logo, and collapsing because he is \"out of breath\" from his run to the studio. With some modification (music change, new television show logo, and Bugs not collapsing when he poses in front of the logo), this would also be the standard opening for That's Warner Bros.!, the Warner Brothers Network's own cartoon compilation television series, in 1995.\n\nThere has been no representation as yet on commercial videocassette, laser videodisc, or digital videodisc (DVD) of the openings, closing credits, and \"Hip Clip\" introductions to Merrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nCartoon directors Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Robert McKimson, Tex Avery, Robert Clampett, Frank Tashlin, Arthur Davis, and Norman McCabe\n\nVoice characterisation performers Mel Blanc, Arthur Q. Bryan, Daws Butler, and Bea Benaderet\n\nMusicians Carl W.
