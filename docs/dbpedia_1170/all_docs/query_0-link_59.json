        "text": "Well, Boomerang US aired \"Greedy For Tweety\" with its 1997 Dubbed version.\n\nHere's also something interesting: In newer prints of \"Greedy For Tweety\" (the 1998 dubbed version print (a.k.a. THIS VERSION 1998) and the restored version seen on I Love Tweety Japanese DVD) during the part where Sylvester attempts to hit Hector's bandaged foot with a walking stick while saying \"Okay buster, you ask for it!\" there appears to be a slight screen shake in this scene.\n\nThis slight \"screen shake\" is surprisingly not found on older prints of the cartoon (Laserdisc, Golden Jubilee VHS, Oldest). Perhaps it could be due to the age of the cartoon's original negative when this cartoon was remastered in 1998 (dubbed version) and 2001 (restored Japanese DVD version), at the times the cartoon was remastered twice in those two years the original negative was already 41 and 44 years old during those two respective years.\n\nEvidence of a slight \"screen shake\" in newer remasters of \"Greedy for Tweety\"\n\n1. Dubbed version: at 4:04\n\n2. Restored version: at 3:56\n\nhttp://chomikuj.pl/Nieznam123/Zwari...y+w+opa*c5*82ach+(1957),5736318181.mkv(video)\n\n(Note: This copy of the restored version is Polish dubbed and is in PAL format (although having normal-pitched audio instead of high-pitched audio). I used this link above because your copy of the restored version of \"Greedy For Tweety\" in English audio (and in NTSC format) has been deleted from your DM channel a few weeks ago)\n\nBoomerang USA never airs any \"1997-1998 THIS VERSION\", the only ones I see are LaserDisc, 24 Karat VHS bad quality prints with PAL audio.\n\nOn the other hand though, they do air the dubbed computer colorized versions which is good, much better than the redrawn ones. I swear the redrawn ones are so bad, not only the quality, but they put fake titles, that's annoying. And hardly any AAP prints show up on Boom USA anymore.\n\nBoomerang USA actually does air 1997/1998 THIS VERSION prints, but only a small selection, though.\n\n(#) Earlier airings on CN/Boomerang USA initially used unrestored transfers, either via LaserDisc/ 1988 WB video remasters [LD] or Golden Jubilee VHS [GJ] or Looney Tunes Video Show prints [LTV] before being replaced by the dubbed versions on later CN/Boomerang USA airings.\n\n1997 dubbed version:\n\n1. Shishkabugs (no dubbed notice at the ending card)\n\n2. Daffy's Inn Trouble (#, LD [PAL])\n\n3. The Million Hare (no dubbed notice at the ending card)\n\n4. Beep Prepared (no dubbed notice at the ending card, low-pitched) (#, LTV [PAL])\n\n5. Bugs and Thugs (no dubbed notice at the ending card)\n\n6. Rabbit Rampage (no dubbed notice at the ending card)\n\n7. Bonanza Bunny (no dubbed notice at the ending card)\n\n1998 dubbed version:\n\n1. Greedy For Tweety (#, LD)\n\n2. Don't Give Up The Sheep\n\n3. The Wearing Of The Grin\n\n4. Wideo Wabbit (Censored)\n\n5. Big House Bunny\n\n6. Robot Rabbit\n\n7. Dough For The Do-Do (#, GJ [double speed])\n\n8. From Hare To Eternity\n\n9. A Mouse Divided (no dubbed notice at the ending card)\n\n10. Scaredy Cat (on current airings since 2011, no dubbed notice at the ending card) (#, LD)\n\n11. Stooge For A Mouse (Goofs: Both the English and Spanish audiotracks play on the left and right speakers for this dubbed version airing on the channel) (#, LD)\n\n12. My Bunny Lies Over The Sea\n\n\"Dubbed\" cartoons transfer alternatives on CN/Boomerang USA (there are what alternative unrestored transfers were used for CN/Boomerang USA airings in place of the THIS VERSION 1997/1998 prints):\n\nLaserDisc/ 1988 WB video remasters [LD]\n\nGolden Jubilee VHS [GJ]\n\nLooney Tunes Video Show prints [LTV]\n\n1.

Boyhood Daze [LD]\n\nAlthough Boomerang USA hardly airs a.a.p. prints of pre-1948 cartoons after 1995, however the notable exceptions are The Goofy Gophers (1947, no a.a.p. intro), Behind The Meatball (1945, no a.a.p. intro), Naughty But Mice (1938), Detouring America (1939), Land Of The Midnight Fun (1939), Fair and Worm-Er (1946, no a.a.p. intro), The Hare-Brained Hypnotist (1942, with blue borders like the Laserdisc version) and Buccaneer Bunny (1948, no a.a.p. intro and with light blue borders like the Laserdisc version).\n\nAs of 2011, Buccaneer Bunny (1948) and The Goofy Gophers (1947) are the most frequently aired a.a.p. prints on Boomerang USA."
