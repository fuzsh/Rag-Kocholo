        "text": "Charles Dwight “Charlie”, “Chuck”, “Chas” Sherwood, 88, of Tulsa, OK, was born February 8, 1933, in Northcott, KS, to Fred and Lola Gladys (Reiter) Sherwood. He passed away suddenly at home on January 21, 2022, in Tulsa, OK.\n\nCharles was a truck driver the better part of 54 years which during this time he took a break and served in the United States Navy from 1956 to 1962, as a Gunner’s Mate on the USS Stark County LTS 1134. He then returned to truck driving. He eventually became an “Owner/Operator” of his own semi-truck and trailer. After many years, he retired, selling his semi-truck and trailer. This didn’t last too long because he couldn’t stand being still, so he went out and bought another semi-truck and trailer to work a few more years. He loved to tell us stories of all the places he had been and things he had seen while on the road. I don’t think there was a highway in the United States that he hadn’t driven on at some time or another. Once he retired the second time, he resorted to driving his zero-turn mower around his property when he wasn’t hanging out at the café in Skiatook with his group of friends or sitting on his porch drinking coffee with a neighbor. He was a friend to so many including me but mostly, he is my dad, and has always been there when I needed him most. You are missed. I miss you, Dad!\n\nHe is survived by his daughter, Tina (Sherwood) Brown of East Bend, NC; 6 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren; brother; Kenneth Sherwood and wife, Betty, of Opelika, AL; sister, Lois Ruby of La Harpe, KS; sister; Rose Mary Johnson and husband, Leon of Burlington, KS; brother, John Sherwood and wife, Melanie of La Harpe, KS; several nieces and nephews; and many other relatives and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his sons, Charles D. Sherwood, and Merrill D. Sherwood; grandson, Shaun M. Davis; parents, Fred and Gladys Sherwood; sister, Betty Gilliland; brothers, Fred Sherwood, Jr., and Tallie Sherwood; and nephew, Willie Ruby.\n\nChristian burial will be celebrated with a graveside service on Thursday, May 5, 2022, at 10:00 AM at Geneva Cemetery in Iola, KS with Chaplain Lloyd W. Houk officiating under the direction of Feuerborn Family Funeral Service in Iola, KS.\n\nArrangements and services were entrusted to Johnson Funeral Home, Sperry, OK."
