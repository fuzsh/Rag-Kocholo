        "text": "RESEARCH\n\nThe long-term goal of my research is to develop an understanding of the molecular genetic basis of plant-fungal pathogen interactions in order to develop novel strategies for controlling fungal pathogens. We are currently investigating mating of Ustilago hordei, the cause of barley covered smut, which results in the conversion in this fungus from a non-pathogenic to a pathogenic form. Using genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology, we are defining [hope to define] the molecular determinants involved in pathogenicity of U. hordei. A second research area involves the molecular transfer of anti-fungal proteins found in the wheat endosperm to other plants, in order to limit plant diseases\n\nAREA OF RESPONSIBILITY\n\nFungal diseases of cereals, molecular genetics of fungal pathogens.
