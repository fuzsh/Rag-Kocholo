I knew John weâll over the course of over 50 years through basketball officiating and while I was working at NBCS. While there, if I wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes in the community or at school, I would visit to his barbershop. He was a ardent supporter of the âpurple and goldâ and his the New Berlin community. Together with his brother, they were a great asset to that area. I am saddened by his death but know he loved his family in total. He was simply one of the good guys!"
