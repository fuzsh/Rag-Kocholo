        "text": "These papers, dating from 1851 to 1981, document the activities and associations of Sherwood Eddy throughout his long career as a Y.M.C.A. secretary, seminar leader, author, and lecturer. Eddy's insightful letters and writings reveal much about his interests and involvements, which ranged from Christian evangelism to world politics to cooperative farms in the South to spiritualism. The controversies that accompanied Eddy's liberal views on various issues are documented.\n\nThe Eddy Papers complement numerous other collections at the Yale Divinity School Library, including the John R. Mott Papers and the archives of the Student Volunteer Movement and World Student Christian Federation. Of particular interest to the YDSL focus on China missions are the documentation of Eddy's evangelistic meetings in Asia 1911 to 1914 and letters that report on visits to China throughout the 1920s and 20s, revealing Eddy's evolving estimation of China's leadership.\n\nThe Eddy Papers came to the Library in three nearly equal sections, one during Eddy's lifetime, one donated by Eddy's widow in 1977 and one following her death in 1982. The original group of papers plus the 1977 addendum have been reorganized and integrated with the third increment.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE, the first series, is divided into six sections:"
