        "text": "RESOURCE QUANTITY, QUALITY, USE AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nPeru is the world’s third-largest producer of silver, zinc cooper and tin, the fourth-largest producer of lead, and the seventh-largest producer of gold (UNFPA 2015). As of 2014, the mining industry accounted for 52 percent of Peru’s exports with a value of US$ 20.5 billion. The extraction of oil, gas, minerals and related services in Peru represented 10.4 percent of the overall GDP for the same period (UNFPA 2015).\n\nSince 1991, mining claims throughout the country have increased from 2.2 million to 25.9 million hectares. Approximately 20 percent of all land in the country is covered by sub-surface mineral rights claims, according to the Geological Mining and Metallurgical Institute (2014). These claims have increased most rapidly in the highlands, where large-scale mineral operations have been privatized or where new mineral resources are likely to be developed in the near future. Over 95 percent of mining interests are held by private firms (Bury 2005). These claims are the source of conflict in the country as many oil and gas exploration plots overlap with community territories and national parks. Concerns over social-environmental impacts lead to protests that, at times, turn violent.\n\nPeru’s oil and gas resources are substantial. It is possible that the country’s crude oil reserves top 5,864 million barrels. The country’s legal framework favors investors in the oil and gas sector, and there are several foreign investors involved in exploration and extraction activities. Between 2000 and 2006, the government increased the number of approved oil development lots from 30 to 151; exploration permits now cover an estimated 89 percent of Peru’s Amazon region (Gurmendi 2005; Salazar 2010).\n\nThe country’s mining sector includes large-scale operations, which are generally run by foreign companies, often in partnership with local firms. Large-scale operations are the country’s leading producers of gold and copper. They typically use open-pit methods. Environmental issues associated with this production includes the risk of cyanide or acid solution leaks, leaching of waste materials, dust, noise, and disruptions of the local topography. Medium-scale mines tend to be owned by Peruvian companies.\n\nMost of their production comes from underground mines. In general, the medium-sized companies have less capacity and fewer resources to meet environmental standards. Small-scale and artisanal mining operations, almost entirely dedicated to gold mining, are run by individuals and often use methods that can cause substantial environmental damage (World Bank 2005). Factors such as the rising price of gold, easily exploitable deposits, and migration have increased the amount of artisanal mining in Peru (Peruvian Society for Environmental Law 2014).\n\nMining and smelting operations have significant impacts on the livelihoods of local residents and often are related to social tensions. In the six years between 2008 and 2014, 134 social conflicts related to the use or control of natural resources were registered. Frequently these conflicts are between native or indigenous communities and mining or oil companies (World Bank 2015c).\n\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe 1993 Constitution establishes the Government’s obligation to promote sustainable use of natural resources and promote conservation of biodiversity and protected areas through a defined environmental policy (World Bank 2005).\n\nHowever, Constitutional provisions exist alongside the institutional framework for mining activities in Peru, which was reformed in the early 1990s to promote foreign investment. The General Mining Law, passed in 1992 is the main legal instrument governing mining activities. Additionally, Legislative Decree No. 708 of 1992 promotes investment in the mining sector.\n\nIn December 2011, Congress passed Law No. 29815, which delegated legislative powers to the Executive to address illegal mining. As a result, the Executive issued legislation establishing the formalization process for small-scale and artisanal mining. One of the main issues introduced by this set of rules was the distinction of “informal mining” and “illegal mining.”\n\nTENURE ISSUES\n\nMineral deposits, including geothermic areas, belong to the State and cannot be alienated or acquired by adverse possession (Martindale-Hubbell 2008).\n\nThe state grants concessions for the exploration and development of mineral resources to nationals, foreign nationals, or juridical persons. Concession rights are registered in the public registry and may be pledged as collateral. Concessions are granted for areas between 100 and 1000 hectares in grids or groups of adjoining grids. There are no legal restrictions regarding the number of concessions that a petitioner may request. The concession grants the holder the exclusive right to explore and exploit the mineral substances in the subsoil. Most concessions that are applied for are granted. However, the concession by itself is not enough to initiate exploration and exploitation activities. To do this, the group or individual holding the concession must also obtain a number of authorizations, permits and licenses from the GOP and the surface landowner (World Bank 2015c).\n\nThe increase in informal mining poses a tenure challenge as unfortunately many miners are not informed of the environmental damages they are causing and therefore do not treat their runoff. This transfers the responsibility for environmental remediation to the state. In order to address this problem, the government launched a program to formalize artisanal mining but this has yet to show the expected results (KPMG 2015).\n\nGOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS\n\nThere are two options for granting mining concessions. The GOP, through the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MOE) and the Geological Mining and Metallurgical Institute of Peru (INGEMMET), is responsible for large and medium concessions. Small and artisanal mining are the responsibility of the Regional Governments through the Regional Mining Offices (World Bank 2015c).\n\nOther relevant institutions for the mining sector in Peru are the Geological Society of Peru; the National Society of Mining, Petroleum and Energy – SNMPE; and the Peruvian Institute of Mining Security.\n\nAdditionally, the Ministry of Environment (Spanish acronym MINAM) through the Environmental Evaluation and Supervision (Spanish acronym, OEFA) plays an important role in balancing private investment activities and environmental protection. OEFA investigates the possible commission of administrative violations and can impose sanctions as well as preventive and corrective measures.\n\nGOVERNMENT REFORMS, INTERVENTIONS, AND INVESTMENTS\n\nThe GOP has taken substantive steps to improve the governance of, and diffuse social tensions related to, extractive industries (EI). These measures include the creation of the MOE in 2008, compliance with the EITI and other regulatory steps that oblige consultation with indigenous communities about proposed extractive activities in their territories. (World Bank 2015c).\n\nDONOR INTERVENTIONS AND INVESTMENTS\n\nMining activity has been one of the main drivers of the Peruvian economy over the last decade. Between 2003 and 2012, investment in mining has grown by more than 2,700 percent, from US$ 305 million to US$ 8,568 million. Mining activities contribute almost 15 percent to Peru’s gross domestic product (GDP) and generates up to 16 percent of all tax revenues for the country (according to 2015 data). The mining industry is Peru’s primary export industry and it supports more than 200,000 direct jobs.\n\nWith strong domestic-driven economic growth, Peru’s private sector is increasingly engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR). An example of that, was the mining sector’s Solidarity Fund (or Aporte Voluntario) which, between 2007 and 2011, disbursed US$ 596.7 million for education, health, and economic growth projects. In addition, as part of their concession contracts, some mining companies have established development funds that have disbursed US$ 266 million for social investment and income-generation programs. The growing interest in CSR has helped USAID develop private sector alliances and leverage close to US$ 25 million in private sector resources over the last several years (USAID 2012).\n\nThe Government of Canada also supports the GOP to sustainably develop the extractive and natural resources sector, especially mining, through the project Promoting Economic Competitiveness and Diversification in Extractive Regions (Canada 2015)."
