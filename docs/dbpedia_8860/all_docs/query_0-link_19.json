        "text": "Asturias led by Alfonso I is a custom civilization mod by Grant, with contributions from Regalman.\n\nThis mod requires Brave New World.\n\nOverview[]\n\nAsturias[]\n\nAsturias is an ancient and diverse land, host to dozens of empires and kingdoms. Until the 2nd Century B.C. Asturias was home to the Astures and Galicae tribes, who were descended from the Celtic group that stretched across the fringes of western Europe. Despite the resistance of the tribes, they ultimately fell under the rule of Rome for several hundred years. However, they were never fully subdued, and when the Roman empire fragmented under the barrage of Gothic tribes the region of Asturias enjoyed a brief revival under the Visigoths and the Suebi. With them, Christianity was brought to Iberia, and the area remained stable until the arrival of the Umayyads, who conquered the region. However, frequent rebellions led by the Asturian leader Pelagius aided by the mountainous territory eventually forced the Umayyads to retreat to behind the Cantabrian mountains, and with that the Kingdom of Asturias was founded, called the Regnum Astorum. Through a line of powerful and decisive kings, the newborn kingdom grew from a strip of north Iberian coast to become the dominant power in North Iberia, stretching across to the lands of Leon, Galicia and Portugal at its height.\n\nKings Alfonso I and II solidifed its power, and by the venerable rule of King Alfonso III, it was one of the prime examples of the power of western Christendom. However, after his death the great empire split into three kingdoms: Galicia, Leon and Asturias, reducing the homeland to a petty kingdom which was the subject of squabbles between the more powerful kingdoms of Leon and Castille. As the reconquista accelerated and as the Muslim Kingdoms grew petty and small, the focus of power shifted ever south. By 1492, Asturias was but a provincial footnote in the Empire of Spain, which was soon to expand rapidly with the conquest of the New World.\n\nAlfonso I[]\n\nAlfonso I was the third king of Asturias, assuming the throne from his father in 739 A.D. Although not as much is known about him, unlike the detailed records of Pelagius or Alfonso III, he was solely responsible for re-uniting Asturias and conquering the lands of Galicia and Leon, which had previously been lost to the Moors. Upon his acsencion, he began a lifetime crusade against the Moors. By 740 Galicia was in his control, and by 754 he had even conquered Leon, marching his armies as far as La Rioja, near the lands of Castile. However, when he conquered these regions many feared a Moorish reprisal, and so fled to the safety of the Asturian heartlands. Alfonso encouraged this, as it meant that there was less for the Moors to capture, and it acted as a depopulated buffer zone between them and the Moors; if they invaded, they would find it hard to get supplies or seek shelter, as the region had become empty.\n\nThis was known as the Desert of the Duero, an area stretching from the Duero river to the Cantabrian mountains. Because of this, kings after Alfonso tended to focus their millitary campaigns mainly in Galicia and Vasconia. It would be a hundredf years, during the reign of the Asturian King Ordono I that the area would be repopulated again.\n\nDawn of Man[]\n\n\"Hail to thee, pious king Alfonso I of the holy Kingdom of Asturias! You are known as a hero to your people, a great defender of the realm, second only to the legendary Pelagius. In a time of crisis, you fought back the Heathen moors that threatened against your name, and sent them fleeing far into the south, liberating the lands of Galicia and Leon under your righteous rule. Through your great efforts you made even the grandest of caliphs tremble under your name, founding the glorious dynasty of Astur-Leon that gave forth kings of noble caliber to push back the Moorish hordes, surviving until the breakup of Asturias at the death of the revered king Alfonso III. Your achievements were the spark that turned the tide of the reconquista, the great war of liberation that so many kings tried to claim for themselves. However, the defeat of the Moors ultimatley led to your people's downfall; as the centre of Christendom fell ever south your legacy was diminised to just a footnote in history.\n\nOh, great king Alfonso I, heathens gather once more outside your kingdom, seeking its destruction. Can you restore your legacy and beat back forces who seek your end? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?\"\n\nIntroduction: \"Welcome to the great and powerful kingdom of Asturias! Are you here to strengthen the bonds of Christendom, or to tear them apart?\"\n\nDefeat: \"You have doomed the sacred land of Iberia to chaos and blasphemy! Someday, our people will return and rebel like my father Pelagius, wiping your armies off the face of the Earth.
