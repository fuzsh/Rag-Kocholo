        "text": "FUENTES:\n\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_de_Asturias\n\n-http://www.abcgenealogia.com/Asturias00.html\n\nSilo of Asturias\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSilo was the king of Asturias from 774 to 783. Silo was not a relative of either the Peláyez or Pérez families which had produced all previous kings. He was, however, the husband of Adosinda, daughter of Alfonso I. For this, some historians have posited a matrilineal succession or at least rule jure uxoris.\n\nHe transferred the capital from Cangas de Onís to the village of Pravia, which was closer to the centre of the kingdom. He was a local magnate of the region around Pravia. The strategic benefits were that Pravia was located in the Valle del Nalón and at the terminus of the Roman Asturica Augusta.\n\nSilo extended the frontiers of the realm to Galicia. He had to endure a Galician rebellion at Monte Cubeiro in the province of Lugo. On Silo's death, the throne was seized by Mauregatus, an illegitimate son of Alfonso I. Silo did leave one bastard son: Adelgaster."
