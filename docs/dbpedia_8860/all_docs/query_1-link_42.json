        "text": "Highlights:\n\nThe beautiful scenery of north-western Spain; mountains, seacoasts, and forests.\n\nThe impressive ‘castro’ strongholds of the Celtic tribes who resisted Rome.\n\nSome of the finest pre-Romanesque early-medieval buildings in Europe.\n\nA dedicated itinerary led by two specialists in their field, supported by a local Asturian guide.\n\nOverview\n\nThe principality of Asturias is northern Spain’s hidden gem, a natural paradise of wild coastline, majestic mountains, colourful towns and rustic villages. As the sole patch of Spain never to be conquered by the Muslims, some claim it is the real Spain.\n\nOur two-centred tour has two clear archaeological themes, each led by an Oxford University specialist and combining to reveal the origins and development of a unique Medieval kingdom.\n\nThe first half is based in the attractive coastal town of Navia and focuses on the original ‘castro culture’ of the prehistoric Iron Age Astures people, also an ideal way of exploring the remoter areas and wilder landscapes of the region.\n\nThe second half is based in Oviedo, capital of the post-Visigothic Kingdom, from where arose a highly accomplished pre-Romanesque Christian art and architecture, the reconquista of Spain from the Moors, the pilgrimage to Santiago, and the ultimate origins of the Spanish nation.\n\nSee the ‘Itinerary’ tab above for full itinerary details.\n\nDates & Prices:\n\n09 – 16 May 2025. Only £2095. Booking open.\n\nSingle supplement only £225.\n\nWhat’s Included:\n\nSeven nights’ accommodation with four nights in Navia and three nights in Oviedo.\n\nAll breakfasts and four evening meals, two of which are in traditional local restaurants.\n\nDaily excursions with all transport, entrances and guiding.\n\nAirport transfers in Asturias.\n\nFlexible flight arrangements.\n\n100% TTA financial guarantee.\n\nAll our itineraries are focused and well-paced, without being too intensive or rushed. They include a host of fully guided excursions and interesting talks to create an enriching travel experience. Click here for more about what to expect.\n\nYour Tour Directors\n\nGary Lock is Emeritus Professor of Archaeology at the University of Oxford, where he has taught and researched for many years. He specialises in the Iron Age and has carried out fieldwork in the UK, Spain and Italy. He also co-directed the recent ‘Atlas of Hillforts of Britain and Ireland’ project, and his publication of this has been nominated for the Archaeology Book of the Year Award 2023.\n\nMike Sibly graduated in history from Cambridge University and is now an Emeritus Fellow of St Anne’s College at Oxford University, where he is also an associate member of the history faculty. He has taught at Oxford University over many years and was Deputy Registrar until 2015. Amongst other things he has published two translations of medieval accounts of the Albigensian Crusade, and recently walked the pilgrimage route across northern Spain to Santiago de Compostella.\n\nActivity Level\n\nSome of the castro archaeological sites on the first half of this tour are in mountainous terrain, but they simply require some gentle uphill and downhill walking in order to get around them. There are no hikes or long walks, the pace is always gentle, and most of the sites on the tour will present little challenge for those with a reasonable level of mobility and independence. Please feel free to ask us for more details.\n\nFlights and Extended Stays\n\nFlights are added on a personal basis rather than included in the tour price. This gives you complete freedom to choose your preferred departure airport, flight times, length of stay, airline etc. We will be pleased to quote and book flights for you, and any extended stays, or you can book your own if you prefer.
