        "text": "By Sally Pederson\n\nOne of the most historic regions in Spain is Asturias. To the east of Asturias is Cantabria, to the south is Castile-León, and to the west is Galicia. Just like these three, Asturias is an autonomous community in northwest Spain. Asturias takes pride in having extensive greenery and lush vegetation. More than four-fifths of the area is covered with mountains, making this region part of \"Green Spain.\"\n\nAsturias has three major cities: Oviedo, Gijon, and Aviles.\n\nIn the Principality of Asturias, Oviedo is the capital. It is known as a cathedral city and has existed since the Roman period and beyond. This city has a rich architectural history as most buildings have been around since the early medieval times. Its population is less than a quarter-million people despite being the capital of Asturias.\n\nGijon is the biggest city in Asturias. This dynamic city used to thrive in steel and naval industries. It was also a Roman settlement before. Today, it is known as a tourist, university, commercial, and R&D center. The small villages are preserved and contribute to the overall charm of the place.\n\nAviles is a commercial town close to popular beaches like Salinas. What used to be an old seafaring and farming town is now a modern city and a major iron and steel center. This city boasts streets, plazas, and stone houses featuring civil and religious architecture. It also has plenty of other attractions, most notably the magnificent Centro Niemeyer, which easily appeals to tourists.\n\nAsturias was the first independent Christian kingdom of the European peninsula. The kingdom had twelve kings between 718 and 910. The first king was Pelayo, while the last was Alfonso III. In between the years, this kingdom witnessed many battles that would greatly contribute to the social and geographical evolution of the Iberian Peninsula and to what Spain is today. Compared to other parts of Spain, Asturias only went through a few occupations throughout the ages. It was briefly reigned over by Leon but was eventually re-established during the 14th century. Asturias has a strong fishing heritage.\n\nMoreover, the region was a major steel producer throughout the 20th century boasting an international reputation and production level. In 1982, Asturias was declared as one of the autonomous communities in Spain. The region also has significant political control within its borders.\n\nThe climate in Asturias is usually cool and damp, as the Atlantic Ocean influences it. Summers are cool and cloudy, while winters can be quite mild and rainy. This region has plenty of annual rainfall, and fog is common all year round. Although rare, snow occurs mainly in inland hilly areas and the mountains. The best time to visit this autonomous community is summer, from June to the first half of September. Although these are the driest and sunniest months of the year, don't be surprised by some drizzle and short showers.\n\nThe only international airport in Asturias is Asturias Airport (OVD). While it mostly has domestic flights, the airport also welcomes some international flights. You can fly to this region directly from Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, or London. Also, the airport is easily accessible by bus from the three main cities. The cities are compact and can easily be explored by walking. You can also ride a bus or taxi to get around.\n\nLifestyle in Asturias\n\nIn the north of Spain there is an ancient territory named Asturias. This autonomous community is surrounded by Castile-León in the south, Galicia in the west, and Cantabria in the east. Asturias was the first Christian kingdom of the Iberian Peninsula and had 12 kings. Then, it became a principality in the 14th century. Today, it draws in crowds for its lush landscape, attractions, gastronomy, and more.\n\nAsturias wouldn't be a part of Green Spain for nothing. The Asturian territory is filled with grandiose valleys and mountains, as well as grasslands and forests. Asturias takes pride in being the single-province Autonomous Region with the most Biosphere Reserves in Spain, with a total of seven. One of Asturias's Biosphere Reserves, the Picos de Europa National Park, is the oldest in Spain. The area's rich sources of nature offer multiple tourism activities like hiking, horseback riding, observing flora and fauna, and more. The region is also very much alive as winter approaches. Locals and tourists rush into the mountain and ski resorts during this season to enjoy a variety of winter sports.\n\nThe cultural beauty of Asturias is also what makes the region more appealing. Asturias has five caves, all of which are declared Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. These caves feature some of the most stunning Rupestrian Art samples in the entire European continent. The castros, a Latin word for \"castles,\" are also preserved in the region. They make for excellent attractions as they are placed in strategic points wherein visitors can take in panoramic views of the town. The Roman roads also offer incredible landscape views.\n\nThe three major cities are the most populated ones in Asturias. They are comfortable and pleasant to visit and live in.
