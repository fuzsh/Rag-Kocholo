It has a population of 10,248,230. Its capital and largest city is Amberdino.\n\nJahastia is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, which was established following the unification of various city-states on 12 July 1558. Jahastia is a federal state, consisting of five autonomous provinces, further subdivided into counties and districts.\n\nIndigenous people of Jahastia are known as Jahastians, who make up 98% of the population. Various subgroups of Jahastians exist, including Albertinos, Palcines, Restians, and Samatinians.
