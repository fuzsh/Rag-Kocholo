        "text": "King Silo (774-783) was the husband of Adosina, who was Froila\n\nthe First’s sister and who died prematurely when his son Alphonse was still too\n\nyoung to succeed. He was elevated to the throne despite the opposition of an\n\nimportant part of the court of Cangas de Onís. Probably because of that and also\n\nfor the convenience to better locate the capital, centred in the kingdom’s\n\nteritory, that included Galicia already, he moved the court to Pravia, the old\n\nRoman Flavium Avia where he built a set of palaces and a church dedicated to San\n\nJuan Apóstol y Evangelista that also seems to have been used as a royal\n\npantheon.\n\nWe find references to this church in the chronicles of the times of Alphonse the\n\nThird, and a description of its state at the beginnings of the seventeenth\n\ncentury have reached us to day. The sponsorship of this\n\nchurch was stated in a funny acrostic, destroyed in the seventeenth century\n\nwhere the phrase “SILO PRINCEPS FECIT” could be read in a thousand different\n\nways, and that it became a monastery at the death of the monarch. Later it went\n\nthrough several transformations, the first one of them in 1637, where the\n\ncomplete chevet was replaced, and several others in the nineteenth century, when\n\nthe crossing was enlarged and the western façade was replaced as well. Very few\n\nremains of the original construction remained standing at the beginning of the\n\ntwentieth century. These consisted of some masonry walls and two brick arches at\n\neach side of the central nave, upon pillars with bases and imposts decorated\n\nwith layered fillets. At those times it was studied by Fortunato Selgas, who\n\nsuggested a probable original structure, and it was investigated between 1975\n\nand 1980 and rebuilt under the supervision of José Menéndez Pidal.\n\n.\n\nThe end result after so many transformations shows us a church of a basilical\n\nplan with three naves. The central one twice wider than the aisles and separated\n\nfrom these by a series of three round arches, plastered in brick upon square\n\nsection pillars with a transept somewhat wider than the naves, also divided in\n\nthree separated areas by large round arches, the three rectangular plan apses built in the seventeenth century, being the\n\nsouthern one a bit wider than that side of the new transept and a portico also\n\ndivided in three parts, which central one was used as a royal pantheon, and a\n\ntribune upon it. But if we bear in mind the description of the jesuit Luis\n\nAlfonso de Carvallo at the beginnings of the seventeenth century and the\n\ninformation obtained from the excavations at the end of the twentieth century,\n\nit is unquestionable that there are far too many reasons to believe that there\n\nare big differences between one construction, maybe excessively inspired in the\n\nchurches known of Alphonse the Second’s period, half a century later, and its\n\noriginal structure.\n\n.\n\nWhilst Carvallo described a tripartite chevet though with semicircular apses,\n\nonly the central one was found in the excavations, which is in fact of the semicircular type, somewhat canted, which location is\n\nmarked on the floor of the present one. It has been also proven that the\n\noriginal transept was of the same width than the naves, as a continuation of\n\nthose, so its original plan was most probably formed by a rectangle of almost 25\n\nm long by 13 m wide, divided in six spaces, formed by the three naves; the\n\ncentral one twice the width of the aisles, and a crossing a bit narrower than\n\nthe main nave, also tripartite, plus a semicircular canted apse as a\n\ncontinuation of the main nave, and a portico, used as a mausoleum of a slightly\n\nlower width than the main nave. On the other hand, all the church was covered\n\nwith wooden roof, except the apse that was probably covered with a porous stone\n\nvault, according to the remains found in the last excavations.\n\n.\n\nAnother concept to bear in mind is that all the decoration found is of clear Visigothic influence. The one that was present in churches at\n\nthe end of the eighteenth century, that today we can find in Cudillero, of a\n\ndifficult to justify shape, as a great part of the one that appeared in the last\n\nexcavations. Both the altar formed by a stone plaque upon a strong octogonal\n\npillar, as well as the innerdoors with chiseled decoration on secant circles and\n\nfriezes with vegetal decorations, as the remains of a window formed by two horse\n\nshoe arches framed by a sort of alfiz and leaning upon columns, or the little\n\nhorseshoe shaped windows that are still preserved in the lateral walls, lead us\n\nto think that there are too many Visigothic elements for a church rebuilt with a\n\nclear thought on a later period.\n\n.\n\nBut it is still more surprising the existence of a baptismal font at the feet of\n\nthe southern nave that was found during the latest excavations of Menéndez Pidal. It is a\n\nbaptistry of the so called immersion baptistries chiseled on a block of\n\nsandstone of 60 cm by side and 30 cm deep that, due to its location in the most\n\nisolated area of the church, and probably with a direct entrance from the\n\noutside, seems to correspond to a Christian rite much older than Silo’s times,\n\nwho did not allow the neophyte its access to the cult until after being\n\nbaptized. We have to point out also the fact that the chevet’s floor, the naves\n\nand the baptistry are at different levels, having kept a part of the original\n\none around the baptismal pool, and another one in the baptistry built in Opus\n\nSigninum in red, alternating with black pebbles, quite usual in Roman\n\narchitecture. .\n\nAccording to what we have mentioned above, and starting from the point that both\n\nSilo’s acrostic as well as the codex of that period back up that the church was built by Silo\n\nand his wife Adosinda around 780. We find a series of reliable elements that\n\nrelate it with the preceeding Spanish architecture as well as with the Asturian\n\nart, especiallly with those of Alphonse the Second and Alphonse the Third’s\n\nreigns:\n\nThe semicircular canted apse is very similar to the Basilic of\n\nVeranes, at 50 Km from Pravia, and considered to have been built in the fifth or\n\nsixth century, razonable plantearnosbecause of its shape and for the presence of exterior buttresses. Considering\n\nthat both are located in two communities of Roman Spain origin, that were\n\ninhabited in the Visigothic period, it seems reasonable to think that\n\nconstructions that previously existed in the area may have had an influence in\n\nthe initial design of Santianes, of which Veranes is a good example. Apses of\n\nthis type are also found in previous Spanish churches, like San Bou in Menorca\n\n(fifth century), Aljezares in Murcia (sixth century) or Recópolis in Guadalajara\n\n(sixth century).\n\nThe immersion baptismal font, a system that was not been used\n\nin Spain since the sixth century, recalls the existing ones in churches in the\n\npeninsula in the fifth and sixth centuries, like San Pedro de Alcántara in\n\nMálaga (sixth century), Idanha a Velha in Portugal (sixth century) or Aljezares,\n\nand in some basilics in the Balearic Islands although in Santianes it is less\n\ndeep and there are not the usual seven steps: three to descend; the central one,\n\nand three to ascend, according to the description of San Isidoro.\n\nThe type of floor found, of a clear Roman or Paleochristian\n\norigin has not been utilized in the rest of the known Astur architecture.\n\nAll the decoration found both in the church in the nineteenth\n\ncentury as well as in later excavations that conform an undoubtly Visigothic\n\ncomplex.\n\nThe remains of the central nave that have been preserved, which\n\nare proven to have been built by that king, state a\n\nclear precedent of the late Astur architecture, at least in the structure of its\n\nnaves, but the square pillars are not new in Spanish Pre-Romanesque\n\narchitecture, with precedents in different periods, as the already mentioned of\n\nSon Bou and Aljezares or San Pedro de\n\nla Nave in Zamora (seventh century). The round arches in brick were\n\nalso quite usual in Roman architecture in Spain, and it is possible that there\n\nhad been constructions with this type of arches in the surroundings of Pravia,\n\nfor example, in Veranes or in the Flavium Avia, as it seems that the palace\n\ncomplex of Silo was built upon an ancient Roman town..\n\nThe remains of the central nave that have been preserved, which are proven to\n\nhave been built by that king, state a\n\nclear precedent of the late Astur architecture, at least in the structure of its\n\nnaves, but the square pillars are not new in Spanish Pre-Romanesque\n\narchitecture, with precedents in different periods, as the already mentioned of\n\nSon Bou and Aljezares or San Pedro de\n\nla Nave in Zamora (seventh century).

To do that it is very important to bear in mind the time it\n\nwas built, a few years later than Carlomagno came to the\n\nthrone (771) and much earlier than the empire and Carolingian art existed, as well as the\n\nlack of communication in those times of the Astur kingdom, since until Silo, its\n\ncourt had been secluded in the mountains in Cangas de Onís. On the other hand,\n\nthe existence of the complicated acrostic, added to the clear cultural level of\n\nBeato de Liébana, that in that very reign was writing his “Comments to the\n\nApocalypse” keeping a theological discussion of great level with Elipando, the\n\nMozarabic bishop of Toledo, lead us to consider that the Asturian kingdom had\n\nnot been kept unaware of the Roman and Visigothic cultural development in the\n\npeninsula. We must also consider that, according to the Chronicles of Sebastian,\n\nalready in times of Alphonse the First (739-757), many churches had been built\n\nand restaured, although nothing of them has been preserved, what makes it\n\nunquestionable the continuity of the Visigothic culture in the beginnings of the\n\nAsturian art, which, for the time being, until new findings take place, we can\n\nonly analyse in Santianes de Pravia and Veranes. All of these circumstances of\n\nthe Asturian kingdom in the times that the church was built, lead us to consider\n\nthat the fundamental element that Santianes provides to the late Asturian art,\n\nwhich consists on the the utilization of round arches upon pillars in the\n\nstructure of the naves, must be considered as a leap backwards within the\n\nHispanic building tradition, rather than attributing it to probable external\n\ninfluences.\n\nIf we start from that base and bear in mind that, as we have\n\nseen, a great amount of the remains preserved from the original construction,\n\nhave clear precedents in monuments of different phases of the previous Spanish\n\nart, we reach the conclusion that we are in front of a building that is the\n\nresult of the fusion of several heterogeneous elements. In it we find a plan\n\nthat recalls the basilic structures of the Paleo-Christian type paleocristiano, mixed with semicircular casted chevet, three naves with flat roof, portico and\n\nbaptistry with independent access from the outside, with so dissimilar elements\n\nlike the round arches in brick upon pillars, similar to those used in Roman\n\narchitecture; a Visigothic type crossing; the decoration, also Visigothic, that\n\ncould have been reutilized or developed for the church according to techniques\n\nand styles that still prevailed, or the utilization of the portico as a royal\n\nmausoleum. All of that makes Santianes de Pravia a clear example of the theory\n\nwe have exposed in the introduction of this study, in the sense that eclecticism\n\nis the funadamental characteristic of all Spanish Pre-Romanesque Art, except\n\nduring the reigns of Alphonse the Second and Alphonse the Third. In fact this\n\nchurch is already a clear precedent of the later Asturian art, but it had been\n\nbuilt prior to the times of Alphonse the Second, when the design of this type of\n\nbuildings was normalized, utilizing without any prefixed norm both in its\n\nstructure as in its decoration, different elements that were already available,\n\nand out of them, only one, although a basic one, was kept as a fixed\n\ncharacteristic in all the later Asturian art, except in the Ramirense period:\n\nthe series of round arches upon square pillars.\n\nIt is also to bear in mind in this case the possibility that\n\nwhat is considered a new contruction of king Silo could have been the\n\nreconstruction of a basilic that already existed from Paleo-Christian times.\n\nThough within the assimilation we propose for Santianes of different previous\n\narchitectural elements, the type of construction and the rest of the mentioned\n\ncharacteristics are prefectly acceptable for a building of the times of king\n\nSilo; the presence of a baptismal immersion font is beyond thinking at the end\n\nof the eighth century. If on top of that we consider that our church stands in\n\nwhat had been a city of Roman origin that, as Varenes, had been inhabited until\n\nthen, and the plan structure, so similar to the remains of the church of\n\nVarenes, it would be quite logical to think that it could have contained a\n\nbasilic of a previous period upon which the construction of Silo would have been\n\nerected, keeping a great part of the shape of the plan and of the baptismal\n\nfont. But we are afraid that after so many modifications suffered throughout the\n\ncenturies it will be very difficult to reach a definite conclusion both on the\n\nsubject as well as on the original elevations of this church."
