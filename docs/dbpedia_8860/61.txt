The Kingdom of Asturias was a kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula that existed from 718 to 910, with Oviedo serving as its capital. The kingdom was founded by the Visigoth noble Pelayo, whose Christian army defeated an Umayyad army at the Battle of Covadonga in 718. Much of northwestern Spain was reconquered during Pelayo's reign (718-737), and King Alfonso I of Asturias conquered Galicia in 740, Leon in 754, and advanced on La Rioja. In 761, King Froila I of Asturias founded a new capital at Oviedo. Asturias would eventually be plagued by infighting between nobles, and it became too large for a single ruler to govern. When Alfonso III of Asturias died in 910, his kingdom was divided into the Kingdom of Leon and the County of Portugal.
