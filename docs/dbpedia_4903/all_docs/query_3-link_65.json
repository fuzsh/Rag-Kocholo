        "text": "Stuart Bourne\n\nInducted 2021\n\nStu took a circuitous route to winemaking, first completing a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacology and Anatomy before completing his Agricultural Science degree in Oenology and Viticulture and smoothly moving into winemaking. He landed in the Barossa in 2002, as winemaker at Barossa Valley Estates.\n\nHe travelled extensively in both domestic and overseas markets, soon becoming one of our region’s most articulate advocates. He then took his skills to Chateau Tanunda, and in 2015, Stuart joined Soul Growers.\n\nBut it is his signature storytelling as much as his winemaking prowess resonates with consumers and fellow winemakers alike. Convinced that context is everything, he first talks about the region, its geology, geography, people, place and family.\n\nStuey believes that being a true Barossan is not about how many years or generations you’ve been here but instead where your heart lies.\n\nHis community contributions include the Wine Barossa Committee, Barossa Grounds presenter, guest lecturer and mentor and, infamously, master of ceremonies for the 2021 Barossa Wine Show dinner.\n\nHe is involved in the Angaston Junior Cricket, Football, Netball and Cricket Clubs and the Angaston Community and Business Alliance, has served on the Board of the Barossa Farmers Market and on the School Council of Good Sheppard.\n\nA focused, intellectual winemaker who is a tireless promoter of the Barossa, his enthusiasm and passion are infectious.\n\nStu has three children and lives in Angaston with his partner Leonie Boothby.\n\nMatthew McCulloch\n\nInducted 2021\n\nBorn in the UK, Matt attended Berkhamsted School, followed by business schools in London and Marseille.\n\nAfter roles with Coca-Cola France and PepsiCo UK, Matt joined Thierry’s, the UK’s largest importer of French wines, responsible for a quarter of French wine sold in the UK. He helped build the business to an annual volume of five million cases from thirteen countries and more than seventy suppliers and he built an enviable reputation for blending, buying and selling some of the most popular wines enjoyed in the UK.\n\nIn 2006 Matt, his wife, Gina and son Finlay immigrated to the Clare Valley, where he looked after the global sales and marketing for Kirrihill Wines. He also realised his long-held dream of owning a vineyard, growing grapes and making wine. In 2009, Matt became General Manager of Château Tanunda. Now joined by daughter Megan, the family relocated to the Barossa, where he is currently Managing Director of Langmeil Winery.\n\nMatt holds the Wine & Spirit Education Trust’s Diploma with Honours in Wines and Spirits and has completed the AWRI Barossa Wine Assessment Training.

After doing 3 vintages under Jim, Andrew started the Oenology course at Roseworthy (the same year he and Wendy were married).\n\nUpon graduation in 1976, rather than return to Krondorf, he was assigned to sister company, Saltram where his long association with Peter Lehmann began. He became Peter's right hand man in 1978 and embarked on a rather steep and rapid learning curve.\n\nThis was a difficult time in the wine industry and for well documented reasons, Peter gathered a few of his trusted band up at the end of 1979 to move to Tanunda and built Peter Lehmann Wines.\n\nWig has been in charge of winemaking at Peter Lehmann since then and together with the team and a loyal band of Barossa growers, has helped to establish a strong, successful brand that is recognised world wide.\n\nHis career highlights have been many but include the Jimmy Watson trophy in 1990, International Winemaker of the Year in 2003 and 2006 as well as Barossa Winemaker of the Year in 2001.\n\nAndrew's wife Wendy and two of their three children also work in the wine industry it is very much a family affair.\n\nHis skill as a winemaker combined with his ability to make anyone he meets welcome makes Wig an outstanding Baron of the Barossa.\n\nAdrian Hoffmann\n\nInducted 2007\n\nAdrian is a sixth generation born & bred Barossan, with ancestry on both sides of his family tracing back to Silesia.\n\nAfter years of helping in the family vineyard during school holidays, when he graduated from high school, he vowed to never go into a vineyard again.

Jan has always believed in opening up the doors of historical Hutton Vale to share Barossa Life for special events including Tasting Australia, Barossa Slow, the University of Gastronomic Sciences visits, international, interstate and local visitors. She has staged special interest days at Hutton Vale with a personal and real approach that is the signature of the Barossa, including The Smokehouse, Sausage Making, Butchery Skills and Preserving, which have featured in books, magazines, DVD's, television and films.\n\nIn recognition of Jan's creative participation in the region's food culture, Jan was invited to attend Terra Madre, Slow Food's international conference in Italy.\n\nJan's passion for food and wine is matched by her commitment to the arts. Believing that art is the greatest instrument to measure community health and connected social structure, she has worked to make the arts accessible for all. Her Board and Committee commitments include Playing Australia, Country Arts of SA Regional Board, the Barossa International Music Festival Board, Angaston Town Day Committee, Leisure Options Working Committee, Barossa Arts and Convention Centre working group, The Barossa Arts Council and most recently SALA (South Australian Living Artists) with the Barossa being the focus region of the state for 2007.

At the age of 15, he left Holland as the youngest immigrant on board the ship Sibajac, to join his father and half brothers and sisters in Sydney, Australia.\n\nHis early working life was spent in the airline industry in Australia and Hong Kong. Hans and Fransien searched the world for a place that exhibited history, seasonality, tradition and an understanding of the finer things in life good wine, good food and good fellowship.\n\nAfter 26 years in Hong Kong, Hans and his wife Fransien ended their search by purchasing their 40 acre Barossa vineyard and called it Hanenhof Vineyards.\n\nThey moved to the Barossa in 1995 and produced their first vintage in 1996, and the first of many trophies was won in 1999 with the 1997 Merlot Prestige.\n\nBut the highlight was in 2005, when Haan Wines won the Chateau Pichon Longueville Trophy for the Best Blended Red Wine with their Wilhelmus blend at the International Wine & Spirit Competition in London from a total of 5,100 wine entries from 57 countries. At the same competition, Haan Wines won Australian Wine Producer of the Year, competing against 453 Australian winery entries.\n\nSince moving to the Barossa, Hans has spread the good news about the Barossa throughout the world, speaking at presentations to international wine and food societies. Incidentally, each year Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands receives a bottle of Hanenhof wine for her cellar.\n\nHans has been innovative in working with new grape varieties, particularly Viognier and now has one of the largest private holdings of Viognier in the Barossa.\n\nHans is a member of the International Wine & Food Society, South Australian Wine & Food Society, Barossa Rotary Club and the Tanunda Liedertafel and a supporter of many local projects.\n\nThe Barons of Barossa welcome Hans Haan's enthusiastic embrace of all that makes the Barossa great.\n\nCharlie Melton\n\nInducted 2007\n\nCharlie Melton started his path to winemaking after attending Hurlstone Agricultural High School. This illustrious centre of learning in NSW was later to produce graduates such as the briefly Opposition Leader Mark Latham. Charlie was grateful to have been a student during the glory yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nAlthough winemaking had not entered his head consciously at this stage, the fact that of all the agricultural pursuits he had been exposed to, winemaking was one of the few that did not require cleaning up with a shovel afterwards made it quite attractive.\n\nAt the end of his education he embarked on the obligatory young man's ute tour of Australia and, after many formative work experiences such as picking Walthram Cross by the bucket in Robinvale, he found himself in the Barossa Valley.\n\nThe delightfully tropical weather of the 1974 vintage gave him an early insight into downy mildew, amongst other things, and led to a permanent position as a cellar hand at Krondorf Wines. Actually two positions were on offer, one in the cellar and one in the vineyard. Charlie and his travelling companion Kenny Roach (who is still gainfully employed in the vineyard of Grant Burge) knew of course such a far-reaching decision required a considered and irrefutable process to arrive at the answer needed.\n\nA toss of the coin took place!!\n\nAnd so began Charlie's apprenticeship proper into the world of wine.\n\nHis very first vintage was with Andrew Wigan and Charlie proceeded over the next decade or so to take his tutelage from both Andrew and Peter Lehmann after becoming a cellar hand at Saltram Wines in 1976.\n\nHe was part of the band of Saltram staff that moved with Peter to help establish the fledgling Peter Lehmann Wines which quickly led to more winemaking responsibilities.\n\nIn 1986, Charlie resigned from Peter Lehmann Wines and, along with his wife Virginia, commenced the construction of the Charles Melton winery on land he had purchased on Krondorf Road.\n\nThe following 21 years have been enjoyable, exciting, and salutary all at the same time, and have included chairmanship of the Barossa Winemakers Association and a nomination as a finalist in Gourmet Traveller Wine Magazine's \"Australian Winemaker of the Year\".\n\nConsistently acknowledged as a leader in the resurgence of the Barossa as the pre-eminent wine region of Australia, Charlie considers the Barossa - both the wines and the community a unique and special place.\n\nValmai Hankel\n\nInducted 2007\n\nValmai Hankel PSM was born and educated in Adelaide. She worked in the State Library of South Australia for 43 years. Her special interest was in rare books, which she enthusiastically promoted, and she was largely responsible for building up the Library's wine literature collection, including publications, winery records and labels, so that it is now one of the biggest in the world.\n\nShe was awarded the Public Service Medal in the 1996 Australia Day Honours List mainly for her work with rare books.\n\nFor some 30 years she has written about wine, especially its history and personalities, with many of her articles being on the Barossa.\n\nValmai is Vice President of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia and was involved in the publication of their guide books, Explore the Barossa and Discover the Barossa and has contributed to numerous other books.\n\nPart of her work as a committee member of the Friends of the State Library of South Australia involves researching and writing the introductions to many of their publications of Australian explorers' journals.\n\nValmai has been a regular guest on ABC radio, and is a popular public speaker she has given several talks in the Barossa and would like to give more!\n\nIn her spare time, she breeds part-Arabian ponies on her property in the rain-shadow of the hills, not far from the Barossa, and travels alone in the outback in her elderly LandCruiser always with a supply of Barossa reds. She has been a regular visitor to the Barossa since taking up wine seriously in 1960.\n\nThe Barons of Barossa welcome Valmai into the Wine Fraternity as a Companion.\n\nPeter Simic\n\nInducted 2007\n\nPeter attended the University of South Australia and after achieving a Marketing Degree worked in the corporate world for a number of years before taking up a position as Manager of the South Australian Wine Information Bureau in the mid 70's.He continued his own wine promotions after leaving the Bureau and designed the first wine course at Regency TAFE, lectured on wine and for a short time wrote on wine for the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nIn 1978 he launched a national wine magazine called Winestate from Adelaide which will celebrate 30 years of publication in 2008. .\n\nIn 1983 Peter launched America's first colour wine magazine Wine & Spirit which at the time judged 1,000 wines each issue when Wine Spectator was black and white and only judged 300. Many American wine writers were introduced to Australian wines or had their interest peaked because of this magazine.\n\nThroughout the years, Winestate has introduced many wine writers to the field. Most wine writers in Australia today began their writing careers either judging or writer for Winestate. Many of the rest wrote for Winestate at one time or another.\n\nPeter has been a great support of Barossa wines. In the early years, when the Sydney magazine Wine & Spirit Buying Guide strongly supported the Hunter Valley, Peter was staunch in his promotion of the Barossa as the leading medal winner in Wine Shows and Winestate tastings.\n\nOver the years, features such as the first Grange vertical tasting held, Grange vs Hill of Grace tasting, the Meschach vertical tasting and Band of Brothers tasting with Greenock Creek, Veritas and Three Rivers have continued to bring glory to the Barossa. The next issue of Winestate features a comprehensive feature on Elderton Command & Ashmead wines.\n\nThe Barons of Barossa welcome Peter as a Companion.\n\nAlexander Downer\n\nInducted 2005\n\nThe Rt Hon Alexander Downer has been Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs since the election of the Howard Government in March 1996, and has held the seat of Mayo for the Liberal Party continuously since 1984.\n\nBorn in 1951, Mr Downer was educated at Geelong Grammar School, Victoria; Radley College, Oxford, United Kingdom; and the University of Newcastle on Tyne, United Kingdom.

In spite of tasting at the hands of the PR spin-doctors, he claimed to learn more about the wine industry drinking beer with tanker drivers in the top pub at Truro, and he learned most about drinking beers in the old Buick he co-drove with Peter Lehmann in the 1988 Redex Rally.\n\nPhilip was a vital battler for the retention of the precious old shiraz, carignan, cinsault, mataro and grenache vines in the face of the notorious vine pull scheme, and was, behind the scenes, instrumental in forming the Barossa Residents Association, which eventually forced the Government to put an end to that destruction.\n\nIn the years since, Philip has written passionately and honestly about the Barossa in most of Australia's major newspapers and many magazines, local and international. His decade broadcasting on the ABC was special for its knowing references to Barossa life, religion and agriculture. His controversial commitment to environmental conservatism in viticulture, the protection of aquifers in the face of deadly salinity, and the preservation of the culture that makes the Barossa unique, is exemplary, tireless and ongoing.\n\nBob Ahrens\n\nInducted 2003\n\nAfter leaving school in 1953, Bob began work with his Father in the family Blacksmith Shop at Sheaoak Log.

Following these ventures, Aaron and a friend of some 26 years established the well known \"Lunch Plus\" at Unley. Three highly successful years later saw Aaron looking for a new lifestyle venture and after six months of looking around he discovered the former Seppelt Homestead in the Barossa.

Sir Donald was born on 18 February 1923 in Murray Bridge, South Australia and died on 15 October 2011, receiving a state funeral with full military honours in Adelaide, South Australia on 25 October 2011.\n\nSir Donald was a passionate South Australian who relished the work he undertook as governor. Many people have written about his very down-to-earth and warm manner, emphasising what a pleasure he was to work with, which is quite a remarkable tribute for someone in public life whose role in our state was such a formal one. There was no hint that his position or many honours made him aloof or led him to set himself apart from the people of the state he served with such distinction. It is a real testament to the kind of man he was that he is so well thought of so many years after he left his leadership role.\n\nSir Donald will be remembered for the tireless commitment and passion that underpinned his life, no matter what he was doing. In a style which was later emulated by many, he kept trim by striding the streets of Adelaide; he was a regular early morning walker. He was a proud man who had trained in military protocols, a very no-nonsense character who was very thorough and well read. On his return from the Eastern States to become Governor of South Australia he brought himself up to date with the local football code, attending several SANFL games and studying Max Basheer's books How to Play Australian Rules and Following the Game.\n\nSir Donald was a lifelong and distinguished soldier.

In addition to taking an active part in three major conflicts, he honed his leadership skills as a member of staff of the Royal Military College and a member of the directing staff at the Australian Staff College and the British Army Staff College, before capping his military career as a leader of the Australian Army as Chief of the General Staff from 1977 to 1982. His bravery was mentioned in dispatches, and his later service was variously recognised by membership of the Order of theBritish Empire in 1954, Commander of the British Empire in 1969, and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1972. He was made a Knight of the Order of the British Empire in 1980 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1991.\n\nSir Donald pursued life with vigour and an endless spirit for his state and country. In 1986, with Lady Beryl Dunstan at his side, they ensured the state's 150th anniversary was marked at every possible opportunity. They attended functions across the state or hosted ceremonies to celebrate this remarkable milestone in our state's history.\n\nSir Donald will be remembered for his honesty, professionali"
