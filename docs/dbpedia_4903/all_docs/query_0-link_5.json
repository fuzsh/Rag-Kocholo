March 1965 , my student financed old Vanguard up on the hoist getting serviced..in Kew\n\nThe proprietor, walked in, tears in his eyes, and said \"Lex Davison was killed at Sandown this morning?\n\nMy response was \"You are joking\"\n\nHis response was \" I wish i was\"\n\nWhat followed was beyond Hollywood.\n\nDavison's protégé, Rocky Tresise, killed in the 2.7 Cooper next weekend .\n\nWally Mitchell, buys both wrecks and makes a Cooper Monaco look-a-lke\n\nHe is killed after a fiery crash at Symonds Plains\n\nSome years later, Paul Higgins, a regular team member and a renowned journalist, is murdered in his suburban home .\n\nParadise Cancelled?\n\nor a Greek Tragedy\n\nAlec\n\nWhere was the garage in Kew?\n\nThe garage was in Cotham Road, north side, just east of Kew Junction, more or less opposite the former City of Kew municipal offices.\n\nAn imposing two story building abutting the footpath and with a central entrance - I think it was called \"Kirks Motors\" - it has been a Funeral Directors' premises for many years.\n\nMost Australian enthusiasts of that era can remember where they were and what they were doing, when they heard the news.\n\nAlec H\n\nPersonally I feel that Lex and Rocky were both true tragedys and Wally Mitchell perpetuated that with his demise. Paul Higgins though was a lot later and as Steven said nothing to do with motorsport.\n\nAs a matter of interest what did happen to the burnt remains of the car.Inc the deuce 97 Chev. It seems most of the 'good' bits went in various directions. Especially the two donor cars.\n\nTo be a Greek tragedy, there needs to be hubris followed by nemesis.\n\nI don't see any hubris here. Indeed it makes me wish Lex Davison had followed Jack Brabham et al to Europe so we could see how good he really was.\n\nTo be a Greek tragedy, there needs to be hubris followed by nemesis.\n\nI don't see any hubris here. Indeed it makes me wish Lex Davison had followed Jack Brabham et al to Europe so we could see how good he really was.\n\nThe Hubris was the Ecurie Australie presumption, that at a time when even Jones and Whiteford were content to trailer their Maseratis' about, and most Au cars were cobbled up specials, Davison considered that a Latin-named team was appropriate in Au motor sport of the era?.\n\nDavison's performances in England in 1961, in what were basically clapped-out, Aston Martin GT cars, were exceptional and were of great credit to him.\n\nThe point of my original posting however, was commenting on a life-style as perfect as could be imagined, even in a Boys Own Annual, was basically destroyed in a heart-beat and with flow owns.\n\nOf course motor racing is dangerous, but did the Jones, Stillwell, Patterson and even the later Davison equipes, ever suffer such total demise as did Ecurie Australie?\n\nAs always.... CAMS is the total nemesis of Australian Motor\n\nA Greek Tragedy\n\nAlecH\n\nDelving a little deeper than just the demise of the Davison team. The above image shows the catalyst of the 'Ecurie Australie' name coming into existence. Lex, Stan Jones & Tony Gaze taking the Holden 48/215 to Europe for the Jan 1953 Monte Carlo Rallye. I don't believe the name was used as an entrant for the event. But maybe someone on TNF has access to the official entry listing and can share the official entry details.\n\nA brief reference to Graham Howard's excellent tome on Lex, mentions the October 3 & 4, 1953 Fishermen's Bend meeting being the first instance of the 'Ecurie Australie' gathering of Lex, Stan Jones & Bill Patterson under that banner took place. But the entry lists from the programme, certainly don't reveal it. In fairness it doesn't list 'entrants' at all - simply number, name, car & capacity. The same can be said for the March 20 & 21, 1954 Bend meeting where 'A N Davison' is as good as the LCCV/Harley Club obviously felt necessary to type.\n\nThe November 21, 1953 Albert Park AGP meeting does include the Ecurie though, for Stan & Lex. Then when they ventured across the Tasman for the January 9, 1954 Ardmore NZGP meeting 'Ecurie Australie' is mentioned in that event's programme entries. And again when Lex went back for the January 8, 1955 NZGP meeting.\n\nStephen\n\nEdited by cooper997, 18 April 2018 - 09:59.\n\nThe book that the Davison family commissioned on Lex about a decade ago,is well worth reading,not only about his racing but,business and family life.\n\nReading its easy to understand why his death was to hit so many people so hard.\n\nUnlike some of our other hero's of that period,he was a quality person both on and off the track.\n\nI fully agree with you Rob. The 2004 published Davo book is a quality piece in research, production and subject. I need to devote some time to a refresh read of it one day.\n\nI recall a conversation with Chris Davison at his mum's wake. It was in regards whether the Davison archive would still have any information on his dad's Coopers. His response was \"All that stuff will be in the boxes Graham Howard went through for the book. Do you have the book?\"\n\nFrom the introduction page, Diana writes of contacting Graham to do a book on Lex, after David Rapley had suggested him for the task. Tongue in cheek I dare say Graham was forever grateful to David for that! No doubt there were some large phone bills and sleepless nights during gestation. But the end product is a worthy tribute to Lex & Graham's effort - made that much easier by the Davison's fulll co-operation. Mike Kable is mentioned in having been preparing a Lex book as early as 1964. From the way I read it Graham must of had access to Mike's taped interviews. But I guess Mike quietly filed them away after the tragedy of February & March 1965.\n\nStephen\n\nEdited by cooper997, 18 April 2018 - 10:00.\n\nThe book is a credit to the late Graham Howard.\n\nNot only does it fully explain the Davison motor racing Psyche, it is an insight to the Melbourne world of the 1950's\n\nA world where motor racing was \"not quite right\", but where Repco and within, people like Charlie Dean and Phil Irving were beginning to emerge to light up our racing.\n\nThe roots of our motor racing were Melbourne based - Whiteford, Davison, Jones , Patterson , Stillwell et al.\n\nGraham's research was meticulous ...he related to me his \"interview\": with Bib Stillwell.....\" he talked more about himself than Davo\"...I replied \"What did u expect, the man won 4 Gold Stars?\"\n\nIt is is a pity Stan Jones, Doug Whiteford and even Patto were not available at the time of writing .\n\nAlecH\n\n.\n\nI received a \"spam\" email today showing the end of Conrod Straight in 1964 and a bunch of shopping trolleys trying to corner..\n\n\"How we have progressed ..\"\n\nThe inference being ..\"How brave?\"\n\nConrad Straight ....poor vertical alignment , narrow, surface badly sealed with appallingly maintained crushed rock shoulders and no run-off areas at all.\n\nConsider then , in 1961, Bill Patterson did 169,mph down there in his F1 Cooper Climax, in what where by today's standards, motor cycle tyres.\n\nPerspective needed\n\nAlecH\n\nHi, while the mountain has lost some character it is still a very challenging place. The place was in the past downright dangerous.\n\nThough streamlining of the dipper and a couple of other corners have not made the place any safer, just faster. Conrod in the 70s was way too narrow for the speeds and the volume of cars being raced. Not a problem now with only HALF a field of cars competing, or at least in Stupid cars. IF we are lucky there will be 27 cars this year. With a grid density of 55!\n\nI still feel the place is too dangerous for open wheelers but good for any tintop class, and Production Sports too.\n\nEdited by Lee Nicolle, 26 July 2014 - 10:10.\n\nYea....dangerous\n\nJust ask Whiteford,Hunt, Davison, Jones, Patterson, Stillwell,McKay and even Matich about driving a GP car at the\"Mountain\" ......\n\nLee you are saying it is no longer a legit circuit ?\n\nA dodgem car track, a speedway, for Clunkers..oops V8 Supercars\n\nSurely not\n\nIt is no more\n\nWTF. It is a long time since front line open wheelers have run at the mountain. They ran F3 there last year? And as usual had bugger all cars. Though evidently a couple of runners thought it was a bit dangerous.\n\nThe FF have ran there on several occasions, usually with mayhem though I dont think anyone has been hurt. Quite a few budgets have been though.\n\nKB and somone else did a demo there in the 70s in 5000s. Somewhere on here is Kevins comments of the event."
