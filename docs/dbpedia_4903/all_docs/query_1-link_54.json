        "text": "Sometimes here at The Race Torque, when we are researching stories, we fall into rabbit holes that unearth some absolutely cracking yarns.\n\nRecently while delving into the 1954 Australian Grand Prix at Southport in Queensland, we stumbled upon a story regarding one of the greatest legends of Australian motorsport – “Gelignite” Jack Murray, and frankly, it’s too good not to be retold.\n\nGelignite\n\nAs far as characters in Australian motorsport go, Jack Murray is platinum certified top of the pops for the rest of time, never to be beaten.\n\nHis exploits from the circuits of Australia, and indeed from the backroads of every corner of the land, have gone down in folklore.\n\nAn inaugural inductee into the Australian Motorsport Hall of Fame, the Sydney garage proprietor first entered a rally in 1928, with his larrikin antics the subject of multiple books.\n\nSynonymous with the round Australia Redex Trials of the 1950s – he took sticks of gelignite with him to clear the path of any impediments encountered – however, when the route was found to be navigable, the crew took great delight in disposing of the superfluous cargo at opportune times!\n\nPerhaps his biggest achievement was winning the 1954 Redex with a clean sheet, with his gorilla mask, above, making headlines nationwide en route.\n\nIn that dominant performance, Murray and his ex-AGP winning co-driver Bill Murray, no relation, saved weight by keeping spares to a minimum, however, they did find space to carry three cases of gelignite “purely for legitimate reasons”…\n\nHijinks in the 1950s were all a part of the game.\n\nHe was a true sportsman, a wrestling champ that nearly went to the 1936 Olympics, a pioneer of water skiing Downunder, a skilled hunter, cyclist, footballer and more.\n\nFrom long-distance marathon rallies, such as the London to Sydney, Jack was also a mainstay on the circuit racing scene, taking in the major events of the day.\n\nPantless Dance\n\nThe 1954 Australian Grand Prix was contested on a primitive road course at Southport, a stone’s throw from the modern-day Surfers Paradise street circuit.\n\nBack in the earlier days of Indycar races at that venue, trackside nudity was all a part of the spectacle… but in the conservative ‘50s, times were somewhat different.\n\nCould you imagine going to the effort of winning the AGP, only to be upstaged by a naked fellow competitor?\n\nIn Sydney’s Daily Telegraph on Monday, November 8th, Jack Murray’s exploits headlined, overshadowing the efforts of the race winner, Lex Davison.\n\nRedex Trail winner Jack Murray danced around without pants during the Australian Grand Prix car race near Southport today.\n\nMurray gave his “performance” in the pit enclosure.\n\nHe did not know some women were near by.\n\nMurray’s car, a Cadillac-Allard, burst a fuel pipe in the first lap.\n\nFuel was pumped into the cockpit.\n\nMurray found himself sitting in a pool of high octane racing petrol.\n\nChemicals in the fuel burned him.\n\nWhen Murray stopped at the pit to have the fuel line repaired he tore off his trousers, counting the marks about his burning skin.\n\nHe thought he was still wearing his nylon underpants.\n\nBut chemicals in the fuel had dissolved them.\n\nMurray put on another pair of pants and resumed the race.\n\nMechanical trouble later forced him to retire.\n\nFirstly: what?\n\nSecondly: it always helps to have spares handy in the pits, and apparently, this extends to wardrobe…\n\nInterestingly, only once the story in the Telegraph covered off all of the drama of the day, was Davison’s victory mentioned in the final paragraph – race reporting has changed somewhat over the years!\n\nThe official 50 Year History of the Australian Grand Prix noted that the Allard had been fitted with a “very optimistic auxiliary fuel tank system”, which no doubt contributed to the drama.\n\nMurray was also the focus of other headlines from the day, with the image in the header of this story carried by multiple newspapers, with Murray actually backwards to the direction of travel, just after he left the pits with the pants problem.\n\nThe Courier-Mail’s caption read:\n\nGRAND PRIX thrill at Ferodo Bend, Southport, yesterday, when Rex Taylor, of Toowoomba (at left), crashed in his Lago Talbot through bales of hay into a gutter with the nose of his machine still on the track. Jack Murray, 1954 Redex trial winner, in his Cadillac-Allard, swept into the bend, skidded and, through skilful driving, gently brought his car alongside the crashed car. Seconds later Murray was racing again, but Taylor was left behind.\n\nCapable of a top speed of 185km/h, the Cadillac-Allard was a serious piece of kit, and the biggest car in the race with its 5,250cc powerplant, although it retired after eight of the race’s 27 laps.\n\nAway from the track during the race weekend, Murray used his Redex-winning 1948 Ford V8 to cruise around the Gold Coast.\n\nThere was good reason why Murray and the other stars of the day were attracted to Southport for the event, with the prize pool the biggest ever offered in Australian motorsport – £2,145 ($84,000 in today’s money), with an additional £550 ($21,500 now) worth of trophies.\n\nAs was standard for the time, the event drew a massive crowd, with one report stating that the Queensland Motor Sporting Car Club officials estimated the crowd to be as large as 60,000 strong.\n\nIt’s probably best not to lose your pants in front of an audience that large…"
