        "text": "Year Archives:\n\nAmongst the best\n\nBruce McLaren’s performance in the New Zealand Grand Prix in 1958 was noticed by Australian driver and future three-time World Champion Jack Brabham. That year McLaren also raced in F2 and was entered in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in which F2 and F1 cars competed together. He astounded the motor racing fraternity […]\n\nSebring in December\n\nThe 1959 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on December 12, 1959, at Sebring International Raceway in Sebring, Florida. It was the second United States Grand Prix, and the only occasion the race was held at the home of the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance sports car race. Innes Ireland, picture above, powers his Lotus […]\n\nWhat a banking!\n\nDan Gurney finished 2nd in his Ferrari, in his second ever Grand Prix, at the 1959 German Grand Prix held at the AVUS. This photo-above shows, without any photographic trick, how steep the banking really was, as it was constructed at a 44 degrees angle. The 1959 German Grand Prix was a Formula One race […]\n\nColours of Tasmania\n\nThe 1959 Australian Grand Prix was a Formula Libre motor race held at the Longford Circuit in Tasmania, Australia on 2 March 1959. The race, which had 13 starters, was won by Australian Stan Jones, driving a Maserati. Journalist Matt Bishop, like us, very much appreciates this picture above: “If you love racing, you’ll love […]\n\nLong straights and a sticking throttle\n\nThe 1959 French Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on the longer and faster 8.348km Reims circuit. The race was won from pole position by British driver Tony Brooks, driving a Ferrari 246 F1. Picture above: Tony Brooks, Ferrari 246F1, winner at Reims, 1959. Superb shot by Bernard Cahier, taken at turn 1 called “Calvaire”, where Brooks’ teammate, […]\n\nAustralian grit\n\nCooper‘s revolutionary rear-engined cars, powered by the compact and reliable Coventry-Climax 2.5 litre engine, won five races with Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss and Bruce McLaren during the 1959 season. Ferrari’s Tony Brooks took the fight to the Coopers and going into the final race he, Moss or Brabham could win the title. Moss retired from the […]\n\nJean Behra, shooting star\n\nLet’s recall French motor racing shooting star Jean Behra (1921-1959) who took part in 52 F1 world championship events in the 1950s with the Gordini, Maserati, BRM, Ferrari and Porsche teams, and who sadly died on August 1, 1959 in Berlin. He’s pictured above at the 1957 non-championship Morocco Grand Prix, flanked by Rob Walker on […]\n\nPushing too hard\n\nBritish driver Tony Brooks, driving a works Ferrari 246 F1, won the 1959 French Formula One Grand Prix at Reims. Brooks dominated the race, and despite a sticking throttle, crossed the finishing line 27 seconds ahead of his team mate Phil Hill. Stirling Moss was disqualified from eighth position after receiving a push-start (picture above), in […]\n\nA Maserati in the twilight\n\nPicture above: Carel Godin de Beaufort works quietly on his Maserati 250F, Reims 1959. Magical, lonely and intense moments between a driver and his car. Dutch driver Godin de Beaufort was one of the last truly amateur drivers in F1, who ran his own cars – painted in orange – the Dutch racing colours, under […]"
