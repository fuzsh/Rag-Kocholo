        "text": "Stanley \"Stan\" Jones (born March 1923 in Warrandyte, died 16 March 1973 in London, UK) was an Australian racing driver and the father of Alan Jones. Competing in motorsport from the end of World War II, he first appeared in the Australian Grand Prix in 1952, when he finished second in the sportscar race in April, before competing in the Formula 1 event for Redman Racing Team. One of the few local drivers to make the grid, Redman offered him a full-time drive for 1953, which he accepted. Jones regularly made the grid, though he rarely troubled the front-runners. When the team resorted to a single car in 1954, Jones signed for Balkan Eagle. He filled in at Scuderia Anglo-Italia for two races later that year, finishing a career-best eighth in Italy, before returning to Balkan Leader in 1955. He failed to make an impression and returned to Australia. Winning the New Zealand Grand Prix in 1954, the Australian Grand Prix in 1959 and the Australian Drivers' Championship in 1958, he was also a successful car salesman. When his business failed in the late 1960s, Jones suffered a series of strokes and moved to England, where he died in 1973. He was 49.\n\nComplete Alternate Formula One results\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; Races in italics indicate fastest lap)"
