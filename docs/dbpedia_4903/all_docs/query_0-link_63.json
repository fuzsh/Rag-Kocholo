        "text": "Fahrettin Cüreklibatir, better known by his stage name Cüneyt Arkin, is a Turkish film actor, director, and producer. Having starred in somewhere around 250 movies and also TV series, he is widely considered as one of the most prominent Turkish actors of all time. His films shown abroad credited him as George Arkin. Arkin's films have ranged from well-received dramas to mockbusters throughout his career spanning four decades.\n\nEarly in his career, Arkin became known for starring in historical dramas taking place during the first centuries of the Ottoman Empire and Anatolian Seljuks, such as Malkoçoglu Cem Sultan and Battal Gazi. While gaining success with such action-based films, he also took part in political films in the late 1970s, the most famous of those being The Adam Trilogy directed by Remzi Aydin Jöntürk. Arkin and Jöntürk continued their collaboration on many other films.\n\nIn the 1980s, Arkin became known abroad for the film Dünyayi Kurtaran Adam (The Man Who Saves The World, also known as Turkish Star Wars), an extremely low-budget science fiction tentatively famous for featuring bootlegged scenes from Star Wars. Today the B movie has a cult following.\n\nFahrettin Cüreklibatur was born in the village of Gökçeoglu in the Alpu district of Eskisehir Province, Turkey to a family of Crimean Tatar and Nogai origin.\n\nAfter graduation from the university as a physician, Cüreklibatir married his classmate Güler Mocan in 1965. In 1966, their daughter Filiz was born. The marriage did not last long due to Cüreklibatir's newly flourishing career as a film actor.\n\nIn 1968, he took the stage name Cüneyt Arkin, and met Betül Isil, the daughter of a wealthy family that owned a tile manufacturing company. Isil, a graduate of a university in Switzerland was working as a flight attendant at the time. They were engaged in 1969, married in 1970, and divorced in 1971. Soon afterwards, they remarried and Betül gave birth to two sons, Murat and Kaan Polat. Arkin's wife and sons have starred in several of his films.\n\nStanley Baker was unusual star material to emerge during the Fifties - when impossibly handsome and engagingly romantic leading men were almost de rigueur. Baker was forged from a rougher mould. His was good-looking, but his features were angular, taut, austere and unwelcoming. His screen persona was taciturn, even surly, and the young actor displayed a predilection for introspection and blunt speaking, and was almost wilfully unromantic. For the times a potential leading actor cast heavily against the grain. Baker immediately proved a unique screen presence - tough, gritty, combustible - and possessing an aura of dark, even menacing power.\n\nStanley Baker came from rugged Welsh mining stock - and as a lad was unruly, quick to flare, and first to fight. But like his compatriot and friend Richard Burton, the young Baker was rescued from a gruelling life of coal mining by a local teacher, Glyn Morse, who recognized in the proud and self-willed lad a potent combination of a fine speaking voice, a smouldering intensity, and a strong spirit. And like Burton, Stanley Baker was specially and specifically tutored for theatrical success. In fact, early on, Burton and Baker appeared together on stage as juveniles in The Druid's Rest, in Cardiff, in Wales. But later, by way of Birmingham Repertory Theatre and then the London stage, Stanley Baker charted his inevitable course toward the Cinema.\n\nFilm welcomed the adult Baker as the embodiment of evil. Memorable early roles cast the actor in feisty unsympathetic parts - from the testy bosun in Des Königs Admiral (1951) to his modern-day counterpart in Der große Atlantik (1953), to the arch villains in Hölle unter Null (1954) and Gefährliches Erbe (1957) to the dastardly Mordred in Die Ritter der Tafelrunde (1953) and the wily Achilles in Die schöne Helena (1956). For a time there was a distillation of Baker's screen persona in a series of roles as stern and uncompromising policemen - in Kinder der Straße (1958), Alles spricht gegen Van Rooyen (1959), and Hetzjagd (1960). But despite never having been cast as a romantic leading man, and being almost wholly associated with villainous roles, Stanley Baker nevertheless became a star by dint of his potent personality.\n\nAlthough now enthroned by enthusiastic audiences Stanley Baker was obviously aware he need not desert unsympathetic parts - and his relish in playing the scheming Astaroth in Sodom und Gomorrha (1962) and the unscrupulous mobster Johnny Bannion in Die Spur führt ins Nichts (1960) was readily evident. But soon there were more principled, if still surly characters, in Die Kanonen von Navarone (1961), The Games (1970), Eva (1962), and Accident - Zwischenfall in Oxford (1967), the latter two films reuniting Baker with the American expatriot director of The Criminal, Joseph Losey. Stanley Baker also established a fruitful working relationship with the American director Cy Endfield, following their early collaboration on Duell am Steuer (1957). When Baker inaugurated his own film production company - it was Endfield he commissioned to write and direct both Zulu - Die Schlacht von Rorke's Drift (1964) and Die Verdammten der Kalahari (1965), with Baker allotting himself the downbeat roles of the martinet officer John Chard in Zulu and the reluctant hero Mike Bain in The Sands Of The Kalahari.\n\nBaker must have felt more assured in disenchanted roles - as further films from Baker's own stable still promoted the actor in either criminal or villainous mode - as gangster Paul Clifton in Millionen-Raub (1967) and the corrupt thief-taker Jonathan Wild in Where's Jack? (1969). The success of Baker's own productions was timely and did much to enhance the prestige of what was then considered an ailing British film industry. Stanley Baker also took the opportunity to move into the realm of television, appearing in, among other productions, the dramas The Changeling (1974) and Robinson Crusoe (1974), and also in the series So grün war mein Tal (1975).\n\nKnighted in 1976 it was evident that Stanley Baker may well have continued to greater heights, both as an actor and a producer, but he succumbed to lung cancer and died at the early age of forty-eight. But his legacy is unquestioned. He was a unique force on screen, championing characterizations that were not clichéd or compromised. He established his own niche as an actor content to be admired for peerlessly portraying the disreputable and the unsympathetic. In that he was a dark mirror, more accurately reflecting human frailty and the vagaries of life than many of his more romantically or heroically inclined contemporaries. There have forever been legions of seemingly interchangeable charming and virile leading men populating the movies - but Stanley Baker stood almost alone in his determination to be characterized and judged by portraying the bleaker aspects of the human condition. Consequently, more than twenty-five years after his death, his sombre, potent personality still illuminates the screen in a way few others have achieved.\n\nHumphrey DeForest Bogart was born in New York City, New York, to Maud Humphrey, a famed magazine illustrator and suffragette, and Belmont DeForest Bogart, a moderately wealthy surgeon (who was secretly addicted to opium). Bogart was educated at Trinity School, NYC, and was sent to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in preparation for medical studies at Yale. He was expelled from Phillips and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. From 1920 to 1922, he managed a stage company owned by family friend William A. Brady (the father of actress Alice Brady), performing a variety of tasks at Brady's film studio in New York. He then began regular stage performances. Alexander Woollcott described his acting in a 1922 play as inadequate. In 1930, he gained a contract with Fox, his feature film debut in a ten-minute short, Broadway's Like That (1930), co-starring Ruth Etting and Joan Blondell. Fox released him after two years. After five years of stage and minor film roles, he had his breakthrough role in Der versteinerte Wald (1936) from Warner Bros. He won the part over Edward G. Robinson only after the star, Leslie Howard, threatened Warner Bros. that he would quit unless Bogart was given the key role of Duke Mantee, which he had played in the Broadway production with Howard. The film was a major success and led to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. From 1936 to 1940, Bogart appeared in 28 films, usually as a gangster, twice in Westerns and even a horror film. His landmark year was 1941 (often capitalizing on parts George Raft had stupidly rejected) with roles in classics such as Entscheidung in der Sierra (1940) and as Sam Spade in one of his most fondly remembered films, Die Spur des Falken (1941). These were followed by Casablanca (1942), Tote schlafen fest (1946), and Gangster in Key Largo (1948). Bogart, despite his erratic education, was incredibly well-read and he favored writers and intellectuals within his small circle of friends. In 1947, he joined wife Lauren Bacall and other actors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts. He also formed his own production company, and the next year made Der Schatz der Sierra Madre (1948). Bogie won the best actor Academy Award for African Queen (1951) and was nominated for Casablanca (1942) and as Captain Queeg in Die Caine war ihr Schicksal (1954), a film made when he was already seriously ill. He died in his sleep at his Hollywood home following surgeries and a battle with throat cancer.\n\nRichard Allen Boone was born in Los Angeles, California, to Cecile Lillian (Beckerman) and Kirk Etna Boone, a wealthy corporate lawyer. His maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, while his father was descended from a brother of frontiersmen Daniel Boone and Squire Boone.\n\nRichard was a college student, boxer, painter and oil-field laborer before ending up in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war he used the G.I. Bill to study acting with the Actor's Studio in New York. Serious and methodical, Boone debuted on Broadway in the play \"Medea\". Other plays followed, as did occasional TV work. In 1950 20th Century-Fox signed him to a contract and he made his screen debut in Okinawa (1951), playing a Marine Corps officer. Tall and craggy, Boone was continually cast in a number of war and western movies. He also tackled roles such as Pontius Pilate in Das Gewand (1953) and a police detective in Vicki (1953). In 1954 he was cast as Dr. Konrad Styner in the pioneering medical series Medic (1954), which was a critical but not a ratings success. This role lasted for two years, though in the meantime, he continued to appear in westerns and war movies.\n\nIn 1957 he played Dr. Wright, who treats Elizabeth for her memory lapses, in Lizzie (1957). It was also in that year that Boone was cast in what is his best-known role, the cultured gunfighter Paladin in the highly regarded western series Have Gun - Will Travel (1957). Although a gun for hire, Paladin was usually a moral one, did the job and lived at the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco. Immensely popular, the show made Boone a star. The series lasted six years, and in addition to starring in it, Boone also directed some episodes. He still kept busy on the big screen during the series' run, appearing as Sam Houston in the John Wayne epic Alamo (1960), and as a weary cavalry captain fighting Indians in Massaker im Morgengrauen (1961). After Have Gun - Will Travel (1957) ended in 1963, Boone hosted a dramatic anthology series, The Richard Boone Show (1963), but it was not successful.\n\nBoone moved to Hawaii for the next seven years. During this time he made a few Westerns, including the muscular Rio Conchos (1964), but he was largely absent from the screen. In the 1970s he moved to Florida, and resumed his film and TV career with a vengeance. In 1972 he again appeared on television in the Jack Webb-produced series Hec Ramsey (1972) (years before he had played a police captain in Webb's first \"Dragnet\" film, Großrazzia (1954)). Based on a real man, Hec was a tough, grizzled old frontier sheriff at the turn of the 20th century who, late in life, has studied the newest scientific theories of crime detection. His new boss, a much younger man, doesn't always approve of Hec, his nonconformist style or his new methods. The series lasted for two years. Boone continued working until the end of the decade but died as a result of throat cancer in 1981.\n\nIncisive, gravelly-voiced screen tough guy Powers Boothe was born on June 1, 1948 in Snyder, Texas, a sharecropper's son. Used to hard physical work \"chopping cotton\" as a youngster, he went on to become the first member of his family to attend university. He then proceeded to study acting via a fellowship with Southern Methodist University and graduated with a degree in Fine Arts. His performing career began in repertory with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.\n\nIn 1974, Boothe arrived in New York after theatrical stints in Connecticut and Philadelphia. It took another five years before he made his breakthrough on Broadway as a swaggering Texas cowboy in James McLure's comedy play \"Lone Star\". His Emmy-winning performance as Reverend Jim Jones in the miniseries Guyana-Massaker - Tor zur Hölle (1980) led to a permanent move to Los Angeles. Lucrative screen offers followed and Boothe became firmly established as a leading actor after being well cast as Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled Philip Marlowe (1983), HBO's first drama series, set in 1930s Los Angeles.\n\nThough his portfolio of characters would eventually comprise assorted sheriffs, military brass and FBI agents, Boothe appreciated the indisputable fact that bad guys were often the \"last in people's minds\" and playing them could be \"more fun\". Arguably, his most convincing (and oddly likeable) villain was snarling gunslinger Curly Bill Brocius, confronting the Earps in Tombstone (1993). He went on to tackle such complex characters as White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig in Oliver Stone's Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), hawkish Vice President Noah Daniels on 24: Twenty Four (2001) and industrialist power broker Lamar Wyatt in Nashville (2012).\n\nOne of his best remembered roles remains that of Cy Tolliver, the (fictional) owner of the (historical) Bella Union saloon and brothel, chief nemesis of Al Swearingen on HBO's Deadwood (2004). Boothe particularly enjoyed his lengthy soliloquies which reminded him of his time on the Shakespearean stage. The tall Texan with the penetrating eyes was rather gleefully (and enjoyably) over-the-top fiendish as Senator Roark in the post film noir Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For (2014) and managed (at least near the end) to inject some humanity into the role of Gideon Malick, the sinister head of HYDRA, in Marvel's Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013).\n\nAs is so often the case with actors of the 'hard-boiled school', Boothe has often been described as the very antithesis of the characters he essayed on screen. Sin City director Robert Rodriguez fittingly eulogised him as \"a towering Texas gentleman and world class artist\". Powers Boothe died in his sleep, in Los Angeles, at age 68 on the morning of May 14, 2017 of a heart attack after battling pancreatic cancer for six months.\n\nErnest Borgnine was born Ermes Effron Borgnino on January 24, 1917 in Hamden, Connecticut. His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\".\n\nIn 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as Mädchen ohne Mitgift (1956), Eisstation Zebra (1968) and Ein Zug für zwei Halunken (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Airwolf (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series Ein Single kommt immer allein (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies.\n\nErnest Borgnine has often stated that acting was his greatest passion. His amazing 61-year career (1951 - 2012) included appearances in well over 100 feature films and as a regular in three television series, as well as voice-overs in animated films such as Charlie - Ein himmlischer Held (1996), Small Soldiers (1998), and a continued role in the series SpongeBob Schwammkopf (1999). Between 1973 until his death, Ernest was married to Tova Traesnaes, who heads her own cosmetics company. They lived in Beverly Hills, California, where Ernest assisted his wife between film projects. When not acting, Ernest actively supported numerous charities and spoke tirelessly at benefits throughout the country. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from colleges across the United States as well as numerous Lifetime Achievement Awards. In 1996, Ernest purchased a bus and traveled across the United States to see the country and meet his many fans. On December 17, 1999, he presented the University of North Alabama with a collection of scripts from his film and television career, due to his long friendship with North Alabama alumnus and actor George Lindsey (died May 6, 2012), who was an artist in residence at North Alabama.\n\nErnest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn (1926-2013)\n\nRugged features and a natural charm have worked for Josh Brolin, the son of actor James Brolin. He has played roles as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States.\n\nBrolin was born February 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, California, to Jane Cameron (Agee), a Texas-born wildlife activist, and James Brolin. Josh was not interested at first in the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, during junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like. He played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film Die Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Pilot (1987) and Die jungen Reiter (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, James Brolin.\n\nAfter Die jungen Reiter (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in Roadflower (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Killer Cops - Mörder in Uniform (1996), the romantic film Das Rosenbett (1996), the thriller film Freeze - Alptraum Nachtwache (1997), and appeared with his father in Brothers in Arms (1997). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop Mod Squad - Cops auf Zeit (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn - In der Hitze der Wüste (2000), the sci-if thriller Hollow Man - Unsichtbare Gefahr (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane but later divorced in 2013.\n\nIt was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Grindhouse (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: corrupt officer Nick Trupo in the crime epic American Gangster (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama Im Tal von Elah (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in No Country for Old Men (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nBrolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film Milk (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially.\n\nBrolin then acted in the smaller comedy Women in Trouble (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Wall Street: Geld schläft nicht (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin's character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film's chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen's London-based film Ich sehe den Mann deiner Träume (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of Der Marshal (1969).\n\nDespite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly. Hopefully, he continues this streak of good fortune that his talents have finally given him.\n\nThe archetypal screen tough guy with weatherbeaten features--one film critic described his rugged looks as \"a Clark Gable who had been left out in the sun too long\"--Charles Bronson was born Charles Buchinsky, one of 15 children of struggling parents in Pennsylvania. His mother, Mary (Valinsky), was born in Pennsylvania, to Lithuanian parents, and his father, Walter Buchinsky, was a Lithuanian immigrant coal miner.\n\nHe completed high school and joined his father in the mines (an experience that resulted in a lifetime fear of being in enclosed spaces) and then served in WW II. After his return from the war, Bronson used the GI Bill to study art (a passion he had for the rest of his life), then enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. One of his teachers was impressed with the young man and recommended him to director Henry Hathaway, resulting in Bronson making his film debut in You're in the Navy Now (1951).\n\nHe appeared on screen often early in his career, though usually uncredited. However, he made an impact on audiences as the evil assistant to Vincent Price in the 3-D thriller Das Kabinett des Professor Bondi (1953). His sinewy yet muscular physique got him cast in action-type roles, often without a shirt to highlight his manly frame. He received positive notices from critics for his performances in Vera Cruz (1954), Sperrfeuer auf Quadrat 7 (1955) and Hölle der tausend Martern (1957). Indie director Roger Corman cast him as the lead in his well-received low-budget gangster flick Revolver-Kelly (1958), then Bronson scored the lead in his own TV series, Der Mann mit der Kamera (1958). The 1960s proved to be the era in which Bronson made his reputation as a man of few words but much action.\n\nDirector John Sturges cast him as half Irish/half Mexican gunslinger Bernardo O'Reilly in the smash hit western Die glorreichen Sieben (1960), and hired him again as tunnel rat Danny Velinski for the WWII POW big-budget epic Gesprengte Ketten (1963). Several more strong roles followed, then once again he was back in military uniform, alongside Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine in the testosterone-filled Das dreckige Dutzend (1967).\n\nEuropean audiences had taken a shine to his minimalist acting style, and he headed to the Continent to star in several action-oriented films, including San Sebastian (1968) (aka \"Guns for San Sebastian\"), the cult western Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (1968) (aka \"Once Upon a Time in The West\"), Der aus dem Regen kam (1970) (aka \"Rider On The Rain\") and, in one of the quirkier examples of international casting, alongside Japansese screen legend Toshirô Mifune in the western Rivalen unter roter Sonne (1971) (aka \"Red Sun\").\n\nAmerican audiences were by now keen to see Bronson back on US soil, and he returned triumphantly in the early 1970s to take the lead in more hard-edged crime and western dramas, including Die Valachi-Papiere (1972) and the revenge western Chatos Land (1972). After nearly 25 years as a working actor, he became an 'overnight\" sensation. Bronson then hooked up with British director Michael Winner to star in several highly successful urban crime thrillers, including Kalter Hauch (1972) and Ein Mann geht über Leichen (1973). He then scored a solid hit as a Colorado melon farmer-done-wrong in Richard Fleischer's Das Gesetz bin ich (1974). However, the film that proved to be a breakthrough for both Bronson and Winner came in 1974 with the release of the controversial Ein Mann sieht rot (1974) (written with Henry Fonda in mind, who turned it down because he was disgusted by the script).\n\nThe US was at the time in the midst of rising street crime, and audiences flocked to see a story about a mild-mannered architect who seeks revenge for the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter by gunning down hoods, rapists and killers on the streets of New York City. So popular was the film that it spawned four sequels over the next 20 years.\n\nAction fans could not get enough of tough guy Bronson, and he appeared in what many fans--and critics--consider his best role: Depression-era street fighter Chaney alongside James Coburn in Ein stahlharter Mann (1975). That was followed by the somewhat slow-paced western Nevada Pass (1975) (with wife Jill Ireland), the light-hearted romp (a flop) Zwischen zwölf und drei (1976) and as Soviet agent Grigori Borsov in director Don Siegel's Cold War thriller Telefon (1977).\n\nBronson remained busy throughout the 1980s, with most of his films taking a more violent tone, and he was pitched as an avenging angel eradicating evildoers in films like the Ein Mann wie Dynamit (1983), Der Liquidator (1984), Der Mordanschlag (1987) and Kinjite - Tödliches Tabu (1989). Bronson jolted many critics with his forceful work as murdered United Mine Workers leader Jock Yablonski in the TV movie Local 323 (1986), gave a very interesting performance in the Sean Penn-directed Indian Runner (1991) and surprised everyone with his appearance as compassionate newspaper editor Francis Church in the family film ...und den Weihnachtsmann gibts doch! (1991).\n\nBronson's final film roles were as police commissioner Paul Fein in a well-received trio of crime/drama TV movies Eiskalte Wut (1995), Family of Cops 2 - Der Beichtstuhlmörder (1997) and Family of Cops (1999). Unfortunately, ill health began to take its toll; he suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last few years of his life, and finally passed away from pneumonia at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in August 2003.\n\nBronson was a true icon of international cinema; critics had few good things to say about his films, but he remained a fan favorite in both the US and abroad for 50 years, a claim few other film legends can make.\n\nExotic leading man of American films, famed as much for his completely bald head as for his performances, Yul Brynner masked much of his life in mystery and outright lies designed to tease people he considered gullible. It was not until the publication of the books \"Yul: The Man Who Would Be King\" and \"Empire and Odyssey\" by his son, Yul \"Rock\" Brynner, that many of the details of Brynner's early life became clear.\n\nYul sometimes claimed to be a half-Swiss, half-Japanese named Taidje Khan, born on the island of Sakhalin; in reality, he was the son of Marousia Dimitrievna (Blagovidova), the Russian daughter of a doctor, and Boris Yuliyevich Bryner, an engineer and inventor of Swiss-German and Russian descent. He was born in their home town of Vladivostok on 11 July 1920 and named Yuli after his grandfather, Jules Bryner. When Yuli's father abandoned the family, his mother took him and his sister Vera to Harbin, Manchuria, where they attended a YMCA school. In 1934 Yuli's mother took her children to Paris. Her son was sent to the exclusive Lycée Moncelle, but his attendance was spotty. He dropped out and became a musician, playing guitar in the nightclubs among the Russian gypsies who gave him his first real sense of family. He met luminaries such as Jean Cocteau and became an apprentice at the Theatre des Mathurins. He worked as a trapeze artist with the famed Cirque d'Hiver company.\n\nHe traveled to the U.S. in 1941 to study with acting teacher Michael Chekhov and toured the country with Chekhov's theatrical troupe. That same year, he debuted in New York as Fabian in \"Twelfth Night\" (billed as Youl Bryner). After working in a very early TV series, Mr. Jones and His Neighbors (1944), he played on Broadway in \"Lute Song\" with Mary Martin, winning awards and mild acclaim. He and his wife, actress Virginia Gilmore, starred in the first TV talk show, Mr. and Mrs. (1948). Brynner then joined CBS as a television director. He made his film debut in Rauschgiftbrigade (1949). Two years later Mary Martin recommended him for the part he would forever be known for: the King in Richard Rodgers' and Oscar Hammerstein II's musical \"The King and I\". Brynner became an immediate sensation in the role, repeating it for film (Der König von Siam (1956)) and winning the Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nFor the next two decades, he maintained a starring film career despite the exotic nature of his persona, performing in a wide range of roles from Egyptian pharaohs to Western gunfighters, almost all with the same shaved head and indefinable accent. In the 1970s he returned to the role that had made him a star, and spent most of the rest of his life touring the world in \"The King and I\". When he developed lung cancer in the mid 1980s, he left a powerful public service announcement denouncing smoking as the cause, for broadcast after his death. The cancer and its complications, after a long illness, ended his life. Brynner was cremated and his ashes buried in a remote part of France, on the grounds of the Abbey of Saint-Michel de Bois Aubry, a short distance outside the village of Luzé. He remains one of the most fascinating, unusual and beloved stars of his time.\n\nProbably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.\n\nBurton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said \"home is where the books are\". He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.\n\nHis first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Waterfront (1950) and Green Grow the Rushes (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Meine Cousine Rachel (1952), Das Gewand (1953) and Alexander der Große (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the \"British New Wave\", and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in Blick zurück im Zorn (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Der längste Tag (1962), and then onto arguably his most \"notorious\" role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including Hotel International (1963), ...die alles begehren (1965), the dynamic Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung (1967), as well as box office flops like Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play Die Nacht des Leguan (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller Der Spion, der aus der Kälte kam (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Agenten sterben einsam (1968).\n\nHis audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Königin für tausend Tage (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Im Morgengrauen brach die Hölle los (1971), was over the top in the awful Die alles zur Sau machen (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Hammersmith ist raus (1972) and Blaubart (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous Das Mädchen und der Mörder - Die Ermordung Trotzkis (1972).\n\nBy the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Seine Scheidung, ihre Scheidung (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), Verflucht sind sie alle (1974), Flüchtige Begegnung (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and Exorzist II - Der Ketzer (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Fliehende Pferde (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in Die Wildgänse kommen (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor \"O'Brien\" in the most recent film version of George Orwell's dystopian 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Die Straßen von Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nA blond-haired, fair-complexioned actor with a toothy grin and capable of an unsettling glint in his eyes, Gary Busey was born in Goose Creek, Texas, and was raised in Oklahoma. He is the son of Sadie Virginia (Arnett), a homemaker, and Delmar Lloyd Busey, a construction design manager. He has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry. He graduated from Nathan Hale High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1962 and for a while was a professional musician. A talented drummer, he played in several bands, including those of country-and-western legends Leon Russell, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson.\n\nBusey's first film appearance was as a biker in the low-budget Angels Hard as They Come (1971) and, over the next few years, he landed several film roles generally as a country hick/redneck or surly, rebellious types. His real breakthrough came in the dynamic film Die Buddy Holly Story (1978), with Busey taking the lead role as Buddy Holly, in addition to playing guitar and singing all the vocals! His stellar performance scored him a Best Actor nomination and the attention of Hollywood taking overcasting agents. Next up, he joined fellow young actors William Katt and Jan-Michael Vincent as surfing buddies growing up together in the cult surf film Tag der Entscheidung (1978), directed by John Milius. However, a string of appearances in somewhat mediocre films took him out of the spotlight for several years, until he played the brutal assassin Mr. Joshua trying to kill Los Angeles cops Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the runaway mega-hit Lethal Weapon - Zwei stahlharte Profis (1987). Further strong roles followed, including alongside Danny Glover once again in Predator 2 (1990). He was back on the beaches, this time tracking bank robbers with FBI agent Keanu Reeves, in Gefährliche Brandung (1991) and nearly stole the show as a psychotic Navy officer in league with terrorists led by Tommy Lee Jones taking over the USS Missouri in the highly popular Alarmstufe: Rot (1992).\n\nThe entertaining Busey has continued to remain busy in front of the cameras and has certainly developed a minor cult following among many film fans. Plus, he's also the proud father of accomplished young actor Jake Busey, whose looks make him almost a dead ringer for his famous father.\n\nA masculine and enigmatic actor whose life and movie career have had more ups and downs than the average rollercoaster and whose selection of roles has arguably derailed him from achieving true superstar status, James Caan is New York-born and bred.\n\nHe was born in the Bronx, to Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, Jewish immigrants from Germany. His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed \"The Jewish Cowboy\". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including \"I Roam\" and \"Mandingo\".\n\nHe made his screen debut as a sailor in Das Mädchen Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Rote Linie 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1966) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in the sensitive Liebe niemals einen Fremden (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Freunde bis in den Tod (1971).\n\nWith these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in the Mafia epic Der Pate (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel Der Pate 2 (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Der Superschnüffler (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in Spieler ohne Skrupel (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star \"Jonathon E\" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller Die Killer-Elite (1975).\n\nUnfortunately, Caan's rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Und Morgen wird ein Ding Gedreht (1976), the quasi-western Eine Farm in Montana (1978) and the saccharine Das zweite Kapitel (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Der Einzelgänger (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Liebesgrüße aus dem Jenseits (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Der Steinerne Garten (1987).\n\nCaan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Spacecop L.A. 1991 (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys - Tage des Ruhms, Tage der Liebe (1991), another gangster in ...aber nicht mit meiner Braut - Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Durchgeknallt (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996).\n\nThe demand on Caan's talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards - Im Hinterhof der Macht (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief \"Big Ed\" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continued to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances up until his death in July 2022 at the age of 82.\n\nMichael Caine was born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen (née Burchell), a cook, and Maurice Micklewhite Sr., a fish-market porter. He had a younger brother, Stanley Caine, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised Die Caine war ihr Schicksal (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\".\n\nZulu - Die Schlacht von Rorke's Drift (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in Ipcress - streng geheim (1965) and the title role in Der Verführer läßt schön grüßen (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Das Mädchen aus der Cherry-Bar (1966), Finale in Berlin (1966), Ein dreckiger Haufen (1969), Die Luftschlacht um England (1969), Himmelfahrtskommando Okinawa (1970), Das vergessene Tal (1971) and especially Jack rechnet ab (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.\n\nHowever, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in Der Mann, der König sein wollte (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in Der Adler ist gelandet (1976). Rita will es endlich wissen (1983), Schuld daran ist Rio (1984) and Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), Gottes Werk und Teufels Beitrag (1999) (his second Oscar) and Letzte Runde (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldständer (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan's films including Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men (2006) and Pixar's sequel Cars 2 (2011).\n\nAs of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.\n\nCaine has been married twice. First to actress Patricia Haines from 1954 to 1958. They had a daughter, Dominique, in 1957. A bachelor for some dozen-plus years after the divorce, he was romantically linked to Edina Ronay (for three years), Elizabeth Ercy, Nancy Sinatra, Natalie Wood, Candice Bergen, Bianca Jagger, Françoise Pascal and Jill St. John. In 1971 he met his second wife, fashion model Shakira Caine (née Baksh), and they married in 1973, six months before their daughter Natasha was born. The couple has three grandchildren, and in 2023, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nIn 1979 with his Detroit friends, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, Bruce Campbell raised $350,000 for a low-budget film, Tanz der Teufel (1981), in which he starred and co-executive produced. Completed piecemeal over four years, the film first gained notoriety in England where it became the best-selling video of 1983, beating out Shining (1980). After its appearance at Cannes, where Stephen King dubbed it \"the most ferociously original horror film of the year\", New Line Cinema stepped forward to release \"Evil Dead\" in the U.S.\n\nAfter co-producing Die Killer-Akademie (1985), a cross-genre comedy written by Sam Raimi, Ethan and Joel Coen, Campbell moved to Los Angeles and quickly gained a foothold producing or starring in genre films such as the Maniac Cop (1988) series, Lunatics - Duell der Alpträume (1991), Moontrap - Gefangen in Raum und Zeit (1988), and Brain Slasher (1991), a post-apocalyptic \"Jeremiah Johnson\", during which he met his wife-to-be, filmmaker, Ida Gearon.\n\nCampbell then rejoined his Detroit colleagues to star and co-produce the second and third films in the Evil Dead trilogy (Tanz der Teufel 2 - Jetzt wird noch mehr getanzt (1987) & Armee der Finsternis (1992)), completing 12 years of work on the cult favorite.\n\nThis rough-and-tumble background was a plus as Campbell made his foray into television, first starring in the highly touted Fox series Die Abenteuer des Brisco County jr. (1993), then as a recurring guest-star on the hit show Superman: Die Abenteuer von Lois & Clark (1993).\n\nWith these under his belt, Campbell easily made the transition to director, helming numerous episodes and recurring as the King of Thieves in the #1 syndicated Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995), and its follow-up phenomenon, Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995).\n\nBruce has since expanded his range on television, appearing in anything from Disney's update of Ein toller Käfer kehrt zurück (1997), to decidedly dramatic turns on the acclaimed series Homicide (1993) and Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993). At the invitation of ABC, Campbell ventured into the world of sitcoms with a recurring role on ABC's Emmy-nominated Ellen (1994), participating in one of the three touted \"out\" episodes.\n\nBut Campbell didn't abandon his film roots. During that time, he had featured roles in the blockbuster Congo - Wo der Mensch zur bedrohten Art wird (1995), John Carpenter's Flucht aus L.A. (1996), and the award-winning independent crime drama, Running Time (1997). He followed these up with roles in Paramount's romantic comedy, Scheiden ist süß - Serving Sara (2002), Jim Carrey's The Majestic (2001), and all three of Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spider-Man movies.\n\nAfter a return to episodic television in the swashbuckling series, Jack of All Trades (2000), Campbell took the title role in MGM's cult sleeper Bubba Ho-Tep (2002). His directorial debut, Man with the Screaming Brain (2005) premiered on the Sci Fi Channel, and Dark Horse Comics published the comic adaptation.\n\nCampbell then directed and starred as himself in My Name Is Bruce (2007), a spoof of his B-movie career, then re-teamed with Disney for their fun-filled hit, Sky High - Diese Highschool hebt ab! (2005).\n\nCampbell has since made the leap into other forms of entertainment, and is enjoying his role as an author with back-to-back New York Times bestsellers: a memoir entitled \"If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor\", and his first novel, \"Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way\".\n\nIn the multi-media industry, Bruce has enjoyed voicing characters for Disney's animated TV series Tarzan (2001) and the Warner Brothers feature Lucas, der Ameisenschreck (2006). He also portrayed the character of \"Mayor Shelbourne\" in the animated hit film, Wolkig mit Aussicht auf Fleischbällchen (2009). Recently, Campbell voiced the role of \"Rod Torque Redline\" in Cars 2 (2011), the sequel to the smash Disney animated feature and for the immensely popular game, \"Call of Duty\".\n\nIn 2013, Bruce co-produced the hit remake of Evil Dead (2013), joined his filmmaking pal Sam Raimi on Die fantastische Welt von Oz (2013), and completed an impressive seven-year run on the spy show, Burn Notice (2007) (2007-2013), USA's #1 show on cable.\n\nMore than two decades after the release of Armee der Finsternis (1992), Bruce returned to his most iconic role for Ash vs Evil Dead (2015), a highly-anticipated series premiering on the Starz network on Halloween 2015.\n\nHong Kong's cheeky, lovable and best-known film star, Jackie Chan endured many years of long, hard work and multiple injuries to establish international success after his start in Hong Kong's manic martial arts cinema industry.\n\nJackie was born Kong-sang Chan on April 7, 1954, on Hong Kong's famous Victoria Peak, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, and the family immigrated to Canberra, Australia, in early 1960. The young Jackie was less than successful scholastically, so his father sent him back to Hong Kong to attend the rigorous China Drama Academy, one of the Peking Opera schools. Chan excelled at acrobatics, singing and martial arts and eventually became a member of the \"Seven Little Fortunes\" performing troupe and began lifelong friendships with fellow martial artists / actors Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and Biao Yuen. Chan journeyed back and forth to visit his parents and work in Canberra, but eventually he made his way back to Hong Kong as his permanent home. In the early 1970s, Chan commenced his movie career and interestingly appeared in very minor roles in two films starring then rising martial arts superstar Bruce Lee: Todesgrüße aus Shanghai (1972) (aka \"The Chinese Connection\"), and the Warner Bros. production Der Mann mit der Todeskralle (1973). Not long after Lee's untimely death, Chan was often cast in films cashing in on the success of Bruce Lee by utilizing words like \"fist\", \"fury\" or \"dragon\" in their US release titles.\n\nChan's own film career was off and running and he swiftly appeared in many low-budget martial arts films that were churned out at a rapid-fire pace by Hong Kong studios eager to satisfy the early 1970s boom in martial-arts cinema. He starred in Wooden Man (1976), Der Herausforderer (1977), Karate Bomber (1978) and The Red Dragon (1978), which all fared reasonably well at the cinemas. However, he scored a major breakthrough with the action comedy Sie nannten ihn Knochenbrecher (1978), which has become a cult favorite among martial arts film fans. Not too long after this, Chan made his directorial debut with Jackie Chan - Meister aller Klassen (1980) and then \"Enter the Dragon\" producer Robert Clouse lured Jackie to the United States for a film planned to break Jackie into the lucrative US market. Die grosse Keilerei (1980) featured Jackie competing in a \"toughest Street fighter\" contest set in 1940s Texas; however, Jackie was unhappy with the end result, and it failed to fire with US audiences. In a further attempt to get his name known in the United States, Jackie was cast alongside Burt Reynolds, Sir Roger Moore and Dean Martin in the Hal Needham-directed car chase film Auf dem Highway ist die Hölle los (1981). Regrettably, Jackie was cast as a Japanese race driver and his martial arts skills are only shown in one small sequence near the film's conclusion. Stateside success was still a few years away for Jackie Chan!\n\nUndeterred, he returned to East Asia to do what he did best--make jaw-dropping action films loaded with amazing stunt work. Chan and his legendary stunt team were without parallel in their ability to execute the most incredible fight scenes and action sequences, and the next decade would see some of their best work. Chan paired with the dynamic Sammo Kam-Bo Hung to star in Winners & Sinners (1983), Der Superfighter (1983), Der Powerman (1984), Tokyo Powerman (1985) (aka \"Winners & Sinners 2\"), Powerman 2 (1985) (aka \"Winners & Sinners 3\"). Chan then journeyed back to the United States for another shot at that market, starring alongside Danny Aiello in Der Protector (1985), filmed in Hong Kong and New York. However, as with previous attempts, Jackie felt the US director--in this case, James Glickenhaus--failed to understand his audience appeal and the film played to lukewarm reviews and box-office receipts. However, Jackie did decide to \"harden\" up his on-screen image somewhat and his next film, Police Story (1985) was a definite departure from previously light-hearted martial arts fare, and his fans loved the final product!\n\nThis was quickly followed up with the Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981)-influenced Der rechte Arm der Götter (1986), during filming of which Jackie mistimed a leap from a wall to a tree on location in Yugoslavia and fell many quite a few feet onto his head, causing a skull fracture. It was another in a long line of injuries that Chan has suffered as a result of doing his own stunt work, and he was soon back in front of the cameras. Projekt B (1987), Police Story 2 (1988), Miracles - Der beste Boss der Unterwelt (1989) (aka \"Mr. Canton and Lady Rose)\", Mission Adler - Der starke Arm der Götter (1991) (aka \"Armour of God 2\") and Police Story 3 - Supercop (1992) (aka \"Police Story 3\") were all sizable hits for Jackie, escalating his status to phenomenal heights in Asia, and to his loyal fanbase around the globe. US success was now just around the corner for the hard-working Jackie Chan, and it arrived in the form of the action film Rumble in the Bronx (1995) (though it was actually filmed in Canada) that successfully blended humor and action to make a winning formula in US theaters.\n\nJackie did not waste any time and went to work on Jackie Chans Erstschlag (1996) (aka \"Police Story 4\"), Mr. Nice Guy - Erst kämpfen, dann fragen (1997), Jackie Chan ist Nobody (1998), which all met with positive results at the international box office. Jackie then went to work in his biggest-budget US production, starring alongside fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker in the action comedy Rush Hour (1998). The film was a bigger hit than \"Rumble in the Bronx\" and firmly established Jackie as a bona fide star in the United States. Jackie then paired up with rising talent Owen Wilson to star in Shang-High Noon (2000) and its sequel, Shanghai Knights (2003), and re-teamed with Tucker in Rush Hour 2 (2001), as well as starring in The Tuxedo - Gefahr im Anzug (2002), Das Medaillon (2003) and the delightful In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004). Not one to forget his loyal fanbase, Jackie returned to more gritty and traditional fare with New Police Story (2004) and Der Mythos (2005). The multi-talented Chan (he is also a major recording star in Asia) shows no sign of slowing down and has long since moved out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, to whom he was usually compared early in his career.\n\nChan is truly one of the international film industry's true maverick actor / director / stuntman / producer combinations - he has done this the hard way, and always his way to achieve his dreams and goals to be an international cinematic star. Off screen, he has been directly involved in many philanthropic ventures providing financial assistance to schools and universities around the world. He is a UNICEF GoodWill Ambassador, and he has campaigned against animal abuse and pollution and assisted with disaster relief efforts to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims.\n\nSonny Chiba was born as Sadao Maeda in Fukuoka, Japan on January 22, 1939. His father was a military test pilot. During his youth, he had an interest in both theater & gymnastics. He was talented enough to make the Japanese Olympic Team until a chronic back injury ended his career. However, he took a strong interest in karate under the guidance of the Mas Oyama during college & soon earned his first black belt. However, his life changed again when he was discovered during a talent search by Toei Studios in 1960. He soon began his screen career under the name Shinichi Chiba, appearing as the space chief in Uchu Kaisoku-ken. Over the next decade, he busied himself w/ appearances in Japanese crime thrillers, steadily building a reputation for playing hard men of few words & direct actions.\n\nWith his proficiency in karate, judo & kenpo, he took advantage of the early 1970s martial arts boom sparked by Bruce Lee. He starred in Der Wildeste von allen (1974), playing a mercenary style street thug who would do anything for a price & take on anyone, even the yakuza. The approach of the film was quite different from the Bruce Lee films in that Lee only eliminated his enemies when he was defending his friends or his honor. Instead, he was only aiming for a fistful of dollars for his deadly services & would engage in mortal combat for the highest bidder, although this often clouded his judgement to his own detriment. The only person the Street Fighter respects is his martial arts teacher, karate master Masaoko who manages to easily out smart & out fight him. Upon its release, the film was criticized for its excessive violence.\n\nA sequel quickly followed w/ him back in Sonny Chiba - Der unerbittliche Vollstrecker (1974), which was then followed by a third Street Fighter movie starring Etsuko Shihomi in the gritty Die Karate-Tiger (1974). There was a fourth & final film in the series Gyakushu Satsujin ken.\n\nHe had firmly established himself as a key anti-hero of Asian martial arts cinema who said little & used his fists to sort out his troubles. With the demand high from fans, he remained busy on screen for the next 20 years, starring in numerous Japanese film & TV productions w/ an emphasis on bruising fights, samurai swords, yakuza gangsters & beautiful girls in trouble.\n\nOutside of Japan, the Street Fighter film series has achieved enduring popularity through many midnight cult screenings. Their style heavily influenced Quentin Tarantino. He has used strong references & imagery from the Street Fighter movies in several of his films including True Romance (1993) and Pulp Fiction (1994). When he came around to casting for Kill Bill - Vol. 1 (2003), he was eager to have Chiba accept the key role of the hot headed & sometimes humorous Okinawan sword maker Hanzo Hattori. He continued to be a major figure & influence in the world-wide passion in martial arts movies for over 3 decades, contributing to the genre by encouraging & training young hopefuls seeking to make their mark on screen.\n\nHe passed away on August 19, 2021.\n\nChow Yun Fat is a charismatic, athletically built and energetic Asian-born film star who first came to the attention of western audiences via his roles in the high-octane/blazing guns action films of maverick HK director John Woo.\n\nChow was born in 1955 on the quiet island of Lamma, part of the then-British colony of Hong Kong, near its famous Victoria Harbour. His mother was a vegetable farmer and cleaning lady, and his father worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker. Chow's family moved to urban Hong Kong in 1965 and in early 1973, Chow attended a casting call for TVB, a division of Shaw Bros. productions. With his good looks and easy-going style, Chow was originally a heartthrob actor in non-demanding TV and film roles. However, his popularity increased with his appearance as white-suited gangster Hui Man-Keung in the highly popular drama TV series Shang Hai tan (1980).\n\nIn 1985, Chow started receiving acclaim for his work and scored the Golden Horse (Best Actor) Award in Taiwan and another Best Actor Award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival for his performance in Dang doi lai ming (1984). With these accolades, Chow came to the attention of Woo, who cast Chow in the fast-paced gangster film City Wolf (1986) (aka \"A Better Tomorrow\"). The rest, as they say, is history. The film was an enormous commercial success, and Chow's influence on young Asian males was not dissimilar to the adulation given to previous Asian film sensations such as Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Nearly every young guy in Hong Kong ran out and bought himself a \"Mark Coat,\" as they became known--a long, heavy woolen coat worn by Chow in the movie (although it is is actually very unsuited to Hong Kong's hot and humid climate).\n\nFurther hard-edged roles in more John Woo crime films escalated Chow's popularity even higher, and fans all over the world flocked to see City Wolf II - Abrechnung auf Raten (1987) (aka \"A Better Tomorrow 2\"), The Killer (1989) (aka \"The Killer\"), and Hard Boiled (1992) (aka \"Hard Boiled\"). With the phenomenal global interest in the HK action genre, Chow was enticed to the United States and appeared in The Replacement Killers - Die Ersatzkiller (1998) with Mira Sorvino, Corruptor - Im Zeichen der Korruption (1999) with Mark Wahlberg, and, for a change of pace, in the often-filmed romantic tale of Anna und der König (1999).\n\nChow then returned to the Asian cinema circuit and starred in the critically lauded kung fu epic Tiger & Dragon (2000) (aka \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"). His wide appeal can be seen in his \"boy next door\" type of personality and his ability to play such a broad spectrum of roles from a comedic buffoon to a lovestruck Romeo to a trigger-happy professional killer. A highly entertaining and gifted actor with dynamic on-screen presence, Chow continues to remain in strong demand in many film markets.\n\nLanky, charismatic and versatile actor with an amazing grin that put everyone at ease, James Coburn studied acting at UCLA, and then moved to New York to study under noted acting coach Stella Adler. After being noticed in several stage productions, Coburn appeared in a handful of minor westerns before being cast as the knife-throwing, quick-shooting Britt in the John Sturges mega-hit Die glorreichen Sieben (1960). Sturges remembered Coburn's talents when he cast his next major film project, Gesprengte Ketten (1963), where Coburn played the Australian POW Sedgwick. Regular work now came thick and fast for Coburn, including appearing in Sierra Charriba (1965), the first of several films he appeared in directed by Hollywood enfant terrible Sam Peckinpah.\n\nCoburn was then cast, and gave an especially fine performance as Lt. Commander Paul Cummings in Arthur Hiller's The Americanization of Emily, where he demonstrated a flair for writer Paddy Chayefsky's subtle, ironic comedy that would define his performances for the rest of his career.\n\nThe next two years were a key period for Coburn, with his performances in the wonderful 007 spy spoof Derek Flint schickt seine Leiche (1966) and the eerie Immer wenn er Dollars roch (1966). Coburn followed up in 1967 with a Flint sequel, Derek Flint - hart wie Feuerstein (1967), and the much underrated political satire Jagt Dr. Sheefer (1967). The remainder of the 1960s was rather uneventful for Coburn. However, he became associated with martial arts legend Bruce Lee and the two trained together, traveled extensively and even visited India scouting locations for a proposed film project, but Lee's untimely death (Coburn, along with Steve McQueen, was a pallbearer at Lee's funeral) put an end to that.\n\nThe 1970s saw Coburn appearing again in several strong roles, starting off in Peckinpah's Pat Garrett jagt Billy the Kid (1973), alongside Charles Bronson in the Depression-era Ein stahlharter Mann (1975) and as a disenchanted German soldier on the Russian front in Peckinpah's superb Steiner - Das Eiserne Kreuz (1977). Towards the end of the decade, however, Coburn was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, which severely hampered his health and work output for many years. After conventional treatments failed, Coburn turned to a holistic therapist, and through a restructured diet program, made a definite improvement. By the 1990s he was once again appearing regularly in both film and TV productions.\n\nNo one was probably more surprised than Coburn himself when he was both nominated for, and then won, the Best Supporting Actor Award in 1997 for playing Nick Nolte's abusive and alcoholic father in Der Gejagte (1997). At 70 years of age, Coburn's career received another shot in the arm, and he appeared in another 14 films, including Snow Dogs - Acht Helden auf vier Pfoten (2002) and Ein Mann für geheime Stunden (2001), before his death from a heart attack in November of 2002. Coburn's passions in life included martial arts, card-playing and enjoying Cuban cigars (which may have contributed to his fatal heart attack).\n\nThe tall, handsome and muscular Scottish actor Sean Connery is best known as the original actor to portray James Bond in the hugely successful movie franchise, starring in seven films between 1962 and 1983. Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in The Untouchables: Die Unbestechlichen (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie's principal star Kevin Costner. Connery was polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man of the Century.\"\n\nThomas \"Sean\" Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. His mother, Euphemia Maclean, was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He also had a brother, Neil Connery, a plasterer in Edinburgh, who was eight years younger. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional soccer player or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent decisions.\n\nDie blinde Spinne (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it was followed by several made-for-TV movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) as well as guest appearances on TV series, and also films such as Duell am Steuer (1957), Herz ohne Hoffnung (1958), Das Geheimnis der verwunschenen Höhle (1959) and Die Peitsche (1961). In 1962 he appeared in Der längste Tag (1962) with a host of other stars.\n\nHis big breakthrough came in 1962 when he landed the role of secret agent James Bond in James Bond 007 jagt Dr. No (1962). He played James Bond in six more films: Liebesgrüße aus Moskau (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Feuerball (1965), Man lebt nur zweimal (1967), Diamantenfieber (1971) and Sag Niemals Nie (1983).\n\nAfter and during the success of the Bond films, he maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), Ein Haufen toller Hunde (1965), Mord im Orient-Express (1974), Der Mann, der König sein wollte (1975), Der Wind und der Löwe (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986), Der Name der Rose (1986), Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989), Jagd auf Roter Oktober (1990), Die Wiege der Sonne (1993), The Rock: Fels der Entscheidung (1996), Forrester - Gefunden! (2000) and Die Liga der außergewöhnlichen Gentlemen (2003).\n\nSean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had Sean's only child, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963. The couple announced their separation in February 1971 and filed for divorce 2½ years later. Sean then dated Jill St. John, Lana Wood, Magda Konopka and Carole Mallory. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they stayed married, despite Sean's well-documented love affair with Lynsey de Paul in the late '80s. Sean had three stepchildren through his marriage to Micheline, who was one year his senior. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and Jason's ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Connery, in 1997.\n\nSean Connery died at the age of 90 on October 31, 2020, in Nassau, the Bahamas, where he resided for many years."
