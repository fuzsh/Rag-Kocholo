        "text": "1963 +\n\nAt the conclusion of the 1963 Sebring race, 54 FAC and 56 FAC were returned to the UK. 57 FAC however, was sold to BMC Canada for a reputed $1,000. There exists a flow of correspondence between Geoff Healey and Peter Millard, Austin Canada, referring to Grant Clark racing the ex-Sebring car. Apart from an accident early on, Clark went on to win the Sportscars Class 12in 57FAC for 1963.\n\nAl Pease negotiated with BMC for Grant Clark to race the car. Pease put up entry fees for Clark on a loan basis. When the loan was not repaid, Pease assumed ownership of 57FAC as part of his BMC-backed Al Pease Racing Partnership, the team also running a potent MGB and an Austin Cooper sedan. The BMC sponsorship deal dissolved after 1964 and for just one Canadian dollar, Pease retained all three cars. Grant Clark infamously overturned another works Austin Healey 3000 [767 KNX] at Sebring in 1964, just four laps after his co-driver, Paddy Hopkirk had handed over the well-positioned car.\n\nOf interest, another key figure was Dennis Prophet, a Cornish employee of BMC Competitions and part of the 1963 BMC Sebring 12-Hour support crew. Dennis migrated to Canada with BMC and was responsible for supervising the importation of 57FAC and its ongoing preparation post Sebring. He then set up under his own banner, Reputation Tuning, located at Scarborough, Ontario. Dennis imported Broadspeed Minis and developed his own modified Mini, the Reptune GT. Dennis was a backer of the Al Pease Racing Partnership and also supported Canadian cars racing at Sebring from 1964.\n\nDennis Prophet with his daughter, Joy. Toronto August 2016.\n\nAl Pease and Don Kindree raced at the Players 200 at Mosport in June 1964, the Healey finishing 6th and winning class.\n\n57 FAC went on to win the 4-hour Sundown Grand Prix at Mosport in torrential rain on 22 August 1964.\n\nKindree won the Canadian Racing Drivers Association Class Championship and Pease was awarded \"Driver of the Year\". In 1965, Kindree and Pease again contested at Mosport placing 2nd with 57 FAC in the 6-hour Sundown GP endurance race.\n\nIn 1966-7, John Davies acquired the car and contested the 100-lap Sundown Grand Prix at Mosport for a 6th place outright finish. According to Canadian racer, Craig Rodwell: It was sixth in the 1967 Sundown GP while I was 12th after blowing a head gasket with 15 minutes to go as we were running together most of the race. This was when I drove the car in practice to check out the clutch that had just been replaced by his and my pit crew! In the spring of 68 I was offered the car for $1500 Canadian but couldnâ€™t come up with the cash at the time as I was getting married in September! (my loss!) I lost track of the car until 1989 at the Healey Conclave in Niagara Falls.\n\nDennis Prophet in whose care 57FAC was entrusted for much of its Canadian competition became the owner after John Davies relinquished racing the car. Many years later, Prophet sold the car to Ed Delong.\n\nProphet also advised that early in its Canadian life, despite warnings from Geoff Healey, the original engine block was damaged after experiments with the sump design failed and an all-new XSP block was despatched from the UK for Prophet to fit. The car retains this block - number XSP-22551.\n\nIn 1988, Phillip Coombs from California purchased the car from Ed Delong and over 1988-89 commissioned Tom Kovacs of the fabled Fourintune restoration shop at Cedarburg, Wisconsin to bring the car back to its correct Sebring works specification. In 1989, the restored chassis and drive train were presented at the Niagara Falls Healey Conclave with none other than Geoff and Margot Healey in attendance.\n\nImage from Graham Robson's book: Austin Healey 100-6 & 3000\n\nGeoff subsequently wrote to Fourintune: your restoration of 57 FAC is the finest I have seen and sets a standard which few will achieve.\n\nAt the time Coombs owned and raced 56 FAC from which Fourintune was able to interpret directly, specific nuances needed to accurately restore 57 FAC.\n\nBrooks' auction catalogue photograph: taken at completion of the restoration by Tom Kovacs.\n\n57 FAC then passed through the very first Robert Brooks auction at Olympia on October 26th, 1989, where it sold to Aston Martin chairman, Victor Gauntlett who attended the sale accompanied by Greek shipping tycoon, Peter Livanos, also a major investor in Aston Martin. Having raced against Coombs, Livanos understood the capabilities of an ex-works Big Healey and that may have influenced the purchase for a then-world record Austin Healey sale price of USD $349,627. Australian collector, Frank Moore became the next owner. Again sold by Robert Brooks, Frank reports that after the auction, he ran it around the Monaco GP track unofficially.\n\nPeter Harburg became custodian before the car passed to Brian Duffy and ultimately to Tony Parkinson with just 25,000 original miles recorded.\n\nAustralian Grand Prix Historics - March 17-20, 2016\n\nMcLaren Vale Vintage & Classic main street parade - 2023\n\nAustin Healey National Rally, Victor Harbor.

I try to exercise the car every month, usually on runs of approx. 60-70 miles. An invitation to take the car across the border for the Werk1 Rallye 3-day event was well rewarded.\n\nAmid Italian & German pre-1970 classics - WERK1 Rallye, NE Victoria November 2022.\n\nAscending mighty Mt.
