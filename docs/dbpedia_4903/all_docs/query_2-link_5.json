        "text": "1955-56\n\nThe first registered owner of 100S AHS 3906 was Australian racing legend, Stan Jones whose personal plate (Vic) 751 was applied to the car after it landed in October 1955.\n\nOf interest, Stan entered the 100S for the 1956 New Zealand Grand Prix [January 7th. 1956]. And Ross Jensen ran the Seabrook Fowlds-entered NZ 100S - AHS 3908, retiring with a broken crank.\n\nStan also entered the Maybach but was classed as a DNA [Did Not Arrive].\n\nEffectively AHS 3906 was entered - but did not run - in two national Grand Prix; New Zealand 1956 and Australia 1957.\n\nJones ran 3906 at Hepburn Springs and Templestowe hill climbs in 1956, the only recorded competition outings in the car which he sold in early 1956 to Ron Phillips.\n\nStan with Alan at Phillip Island in a Corvette-engined iteration of Maybach 1958.\n\nStan Jones, father of 1980 World Formula One champion, Alan, won the Australian Grand Prix in 1959 driving a Maserati 250F at the treacherous Longford circuit in Tasmania. He had won the New Zealand Grand Prix in 1953 driving an awesome Australian special, the Maybach, and was one of Australia’s best drivers throughout the 1950’s being crowned Australia’s Gold Star Champion for 1958.\n\nAnd the Jones remain the only Australian father and son winners of the Australian Grand Prix with Alan also winning the title in 1980 (Williams FW07 Ford) at the Calder circuit in Victoria.\n\nThis photo shows Stan Jones 250F Maserati-mounted at Albert Park 1956.\n\nStan Jones Racing transport equipé: Albert Park 1956. The Rice trailers were a status symbol of the era and as cars could not be adorned, provided space for sponsor advertising.\n\nStan Jones, Maserati 250F, at the 1957 AGP at Caversham in WA where he ultimately finished 2nd to Lex Davison [Ferrari 500/625]. At the same event, AHS 3906 was entered. Ron Phillips won the 40-lap sports car race but, despite qualifying for the AGP, did not run due to extreme heat [see Ron Phillips 1957].\n\nIn a protracted post-race judgement, Lex Davison won his second AGP at Caversham and Stan, again Maserati 250F-mounted, had to wait until Longford, Tasmania [below] to finally win the 1959 AGP after many foiled attempts.\n\nIn both these evocative photographs, the unmistakeable straight-arm technique of Stan Jones is evident. A true master at work.\n\nThe Country Club Hotel on what was known as Pub Corner on the long and fast Longford circuit, features the Lex Davison Bar, Lex having crashed into the building in 1962 after which he repaired to the bar where the locals shouted him a nerve steadier.\n\nAlan Jones re-united with the 100S at Penny's Hill, McLaren Vale April 2nd 2017."
