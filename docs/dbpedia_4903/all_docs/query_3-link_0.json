        "text": "Australian racing driver\n\nStanley Jones (16 March 1923 â€“ 16 March 1973)[1] was an Australian racing driver.\n\nToday better known as father of 1980 World Drivers' Champion Alan Jones, Stan was a prominent racing driver himself, racing mainly in the 1950s. He is one of eleven drivers to have won the Australian and New Zealand Grands Prix. Jones raced the Maybach Specials, the last of the great Australian built specials to remain competitive against the imported European Formula 1 cars, before racing a Maserati 250F.\n\nAn amateur racer, his career declined along with the ability of his business interests (mostly car dealerships) to fund it. After two strokes Jones moved to London to be with his son Alan, and died just short of his 50th birthday.[1]\n\nCareer results\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Race / Series Position Car Entrant 1956 New South Wales Road Racing Championship for Racing Cars 1st Maserati 250F Stan Jones Motors 1957 Australian Drivers' Championship 3rd Maserati 250F 1958 Australian Drivers' Championship 1st Maserati 250F 1959 Australian Drivers' Championship 3rd Maybach III-Chevrolet\n\nMaserati 250F\n\nCooper T51-Climax\n\nSabakat-Porsche 1961 Australian Drivers' Championship 4th Cooper T51-Climax\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
