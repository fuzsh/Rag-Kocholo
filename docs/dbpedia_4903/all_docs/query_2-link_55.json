        "text": "The 1980 Australian Grand Prix was a motor race held at Calder Park Raceway in Victoria, Australia on 16 November 1980.\n\nIt was the forty fifth Australian Grand Prix and it was open to cars complying with Australian Formula 1 regulations, which permitted international Formula One, Formula 5000 and Formula Pacific cars. The race was also the final round of the 1980 Australian Drivers' Championship.\n\nThe race was won by newly crowned 1980 World Drivers' Champion, Alan Jones, driving one of his championship winning Williams FW07 cars in front of an enthusiastic home crowd which came to see their new Australian hero. Italian driver Bruno Giacomelli finished second in the only other International Formula One car in the race, an Alfa Romeo 179. Third was French driver Didier Pironi driving an Australian built Elfin MR8 Formula 5000."
