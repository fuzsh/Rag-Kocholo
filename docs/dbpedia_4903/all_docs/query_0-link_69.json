        "text": "Twenty drivers will line up this weekend on the international circuit at Hampton Downs Motorsport Park with each aiming to add their name to the list of motorsport legends who have won the New Zealand Grand Prix.\n\nThe field will include two further New Zealand talents – taking the number of Kiwis competing in the race to eight.\n\n2021 pole position holder Kaleb Ngatoa, who has been racing in Australia recently, will take part in the weekend under the Giles Motorsport banner and the most experienced driver in the field when it comes to New Zealand’s premier single seater championship, Brendon Leitch, is the final runner and was confirmed to join Kiwi Motorsport yesterday. Both drivers have been getting their eye back in with recent runs in historic single seaters.\n\nVastly experienced racer Chris Van Der Drift was confirmed over last weekend, while Dutch racer Laurens van Hoepen was confirmed earlier this week for the final two rounds of the Castrol Toyota FR Oceania Championship, starting with the GP event.\n\nThe 67th running of the race - postponed last year due to pandemic travel restrictions – boasts a full international field of drivers including some of the best rising stars in the world.\n\nThe race will be the fourth round of this year’s 2023 Castrol Toyota Formula Regional Oceania Championship and will include all of the 16 drivers who competed last weekend at Manfeild - Circuit Chris Amon.\n\nIt means the field will have one Austrian, in current championship leader Charlie Wurz - son of former F1 racer Alexander Wurz - two English drivers in Indy Pro 2000 champion Louis Foster and Josh Mason, one Dutch driver in van Hoepen, Brazilian Lucas Fecury, four American drivers, two Australians and no fewer than eight New Zealanders gunning for glory.\n\nWith American Chloe Chambers and Kiwi Breanna Morris racing, it’s also the first time two women have competed in the New Zealand Grand Prix. Chambers in particular has shown good form in New Zealand on the back of a year in the international women only W Series.\n\nThe event is one of only two outside of the Formula One World Championship recognised as a bona fide Grand Prix event by the world governing body of motorsport – the FIA. The only other is the Macau Grand Prix, which these days is held for a slower specification of car than used in the New Zealand championship.\n\nThis weekend’s event will have a unique qualifying format, very similar to how Formula One runs its qualifying sessions. The session will be divided into three parts – the first 15 minute session, a second 10 minute session then a final 12 minute session.\n\nThe times in the first session will determine the grid positions for the first race, but instead of that being the end of the session, it will continue into a second session but will drop the slowest six drivers. The positions those slowest six achieve will determine their grid position – from 15th to 20th - for the GP itself.\n\nIn the second session, the top 14 drivers will be reduced to the top eight and the slowest six in that session will start the GP from ninth on the grid through to 14th. The final 12 minute session will see the top eight drivers fight for pole position and the top eight places on the GP grid.\n\nThere will also be prize money for the best of the 20 drivers to aim for this weekend, with the Castrol Pole Position winner taking home $500. The Grand Prix winner will get a cheque for $5,000 with $3,000 for the runner up and $2,000 for the third placed finisher.\n\nThe 2021 event was won sensationally by Supercars champion Shane van Gisbergen, who fought back from a pitlane start to take victory. He added his name to a list that includes some of motorsport’s all-time greats, including Stirling Moss, Jack Brabham, Bruce McLaren, Chris Amon and Jackie Stewart.\n\n2023 Castrol Toyota Formula Regional Oceania Championship Round 4\n\nNew Zealand Grand Prix Entry List\n\nCharlie Wurz (AUT) – M2 Competition\n\nLouis Foster (GBR) – Giles Motorsport\n\nRyder Quinn (AUS) – M2 Competition\n\nJacob Abel (USA) – Kiwi Motorsport\n\nLiam Sceats (NZL) – M2 Competition\n\nCallum Hedge (NZL) – M2 Competition\n\nDavid Morales (USA) – M2 Competition\n\nJames Penrose (NZL) – Kiwi Motorsport\n\nAdam Fitzgerald (IRL) – Giles Motorsport\n\nRyan Shehan (USA) – Giles Motorsport\n\nTom McLennan (AUS) – Kiwi Motorsport\n\nBilly Frazer (NZL) – Hamilton Motorsport\n\nChloe Chambers (USA) – Giles Motorsport\n\nJosh Mason (GBR) – Kiwi Motorsport\n\nLucas Fecury (BRA) – Kiwi Motorsport\n\nBree Morris (NZL) – Giles Motorsport\n\nChris Van Der Drift (NZL) – Hamilton Motorsport\n\nLaurens van Hoepen (NED) – M2 Competition\n\nKaleb Ngatoa (NZL) – Giles Motorsport\n\nBrendon Leitch (NZL) – Kiwi Motorsport\n\n2023 Castrol Toyota Formula Regional Oceania Championship certified by FIA - Events\n\n13-15 January 2023 - Highlands Motorsport Park\n\n20-22 January 2023 - Teretonga Park Raceway\n\n27-29 January 2023 - Manfeild - Circuit Chris Amon\n\n3-5 February 2023 - Hampton Downs Motorsport Park – 67th New Zealand Grand Prix\n\n10-12 February 2023 - Taupo International Motorsport Park\n\nNew Zealand Grand Prix winners\n\n1950 – John McMillan – Jackson Special\n\n1951 – Not held\n\n1952 – Not held\n\n1953 – Not held\n\n1954 – Stan Jones – Maybach Special\n\n1955 – Prince B Bira – Maserati 250F\n\n1956 – Stirling Moss – Maserati 250F\n\n1957 – Reg Parnell – Ferrari 555/860\n\n1958 – Jack Brabham – Cooper T43 Climax\n\n1959 - Stirling Moss – Cooper T45 Climax\n\n1960 – Jack Brabham – Cooper T51 Climax\n\n1961 – Jack Brabham – Cooper T53 Climax\n\n1962 – Stirling Moss – Lotus 21 Climax\n\n1963 – John Surtees – Lola Mk4 Climax\n\n1964 – Bruce McLaren – Cooper T70 Climax\n\n1965 – Graham Hill – Brabham BT11A Climax\n\n1966 – Graham Hill – BRM P261\n\n1967 – Jackie Stewart – BRM P261\n\n1968 – Chris Amon – Ferrari 246 V6\n\n1969 – Chris Amon – Ferrari 246 V6\n\n1970 – Frank Matich – McLaren M10A Chevrolet\n\n1971 – Niel Allen – McLaren M10B Chevrolet\n\n1972 – Frank Gardner – Lola T300 Chevrolet\n\n1973 – John McCormack – Elfin MR5 Repco-Holden\n\n1974 – John McCormack – Elfin MR5 Repco-Holden\n\n1975 – Warwick Brown – Lola T332 Chevrolet\n\n1976 - Ken Smith – Lola T332 Chevrolet\n\n1977 – Keijo ‘Keke’ Rosberg – Chevron B34\n\n1978 – Keijo ‘Keke’ Rosberg – Chevron B34\n\n1979 – Teo Fabi – March 79B\n\n1980 – Steve Millen – Ralt RT1\n\n1981 – Dave McMillan – Ralt RT1\n\n1982 – Roberto Moreno - Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1983 – David Oxton – Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1984 – Davy Jones – Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1985 – Ross Cheever – Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1986 - Ross Cheever – Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1987 – Davy Jones – Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1988 – Paul Radisich – Ralt RT4 Ford\n\n1989 – Dean Hall – Swift Cosworth\n\n1990 – Ken Smith – Swift Cosworth\n\n1991 – Craig Baird – Swift Toyota\n\n1992 – Craig Baird – Reynard 92H\n\n1993 – Craig Baird – Reynard 92H\n\n1994 – Greg Murphy – Reynard 90D\n\n1995 – Brady Kennett – Reynard 90 D\n\n1996 – Not held\n\n1997 – Not held\n\n1998 – Simon Wills – Reynard 94D\n\n1999 – Simon Wills – Reynard 94D\n\n2000 – Andy Booth – Reynard 94D\n\n2001 – Not held\n\n2002 – Fabian Coulthard – Van Diemen Stealth RF94\n\n2003 – Jonny Reid – Van Diemen Stealth RF94\n\n2004 – Ken Smith – Van Diemen Stealth Evo 2\n\n2005 – Simon Gamble – Spectrum 010\n\n2006 – Hamad Al Fardan – Toyota FT40\n\n2007 – Daniel Gaunt – Toyota FT40\n\n2008 – Andy Knight – Toyota FT40\n\n2009 – Daniel Gaunt – Toyota FT40\n\n2010 – Earl Bamber – Toyota FT40\n\n2011 – Mitch Evans – Toyota FT40\n\n2012 – Nick Cassidy – Toyota FT40\n\n2013 – Nick Cassidy – Toyota FT40\n\n2014 – Nick Cassidy – Toyota FT40\n\n2015 – Lance Stroll – Toyota FT50\n\n2016 – Lando Norris – Toyota FT50\n\n2017 – Jehan Daruvala – Toyota FT50\n\n2018 – Richard Verschoor – Toyota FT50\n\n2019 – Liam Lawson – Toyota FT50\n\n2020 – Igor Fraga – Toyota FT60\n\n2021 – Shane van Gisbergen – Toyota FT60\n\n2022 – Not held"
