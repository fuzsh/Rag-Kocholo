        "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- World racing champion Alan Jones of Australia Saturday won the pole position for Sunday's 45th Australian Grand Prix at Calder Motor Raceway.\n\nIn very hot conditions in the last qualifying session, 28-year-old Italian Bruno Giacomelli failed to better Jones' best time of 36.1 seconds set Friday over the course.\n\nGiacomelli was 0.3-second faster than Jones Saturday but 0.7 slower than his own best of 36.3 seconds.\n\nJones' Leyland Williams team is trying to win the Grand Prix that his father, the late Stan Jones, won in 1959.\n\nChief mechanic Wayne Eckersley said, 'This is worse than a world championship race. Everybody expects us to win, but Bruno is going to give us a helluva time. He didn't come 12,000 miles to Australia to come second.'\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix is not considered among the world championship events and puts pressure on all foreign competitors.\n\n'Unlike a world championship race where there is another one in a couple of weeks time, all the attention is on the overseas competitors,' Eckersley said.\n\nDespite the shortness of the Calder track, the Formula One cars do 12 gear changes per lap -- an average of one every three seconds.\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix is a two-part race. Jones, in the V8 Ford Cosworth-powered Williams, will be against Giacomelli, in the V12 Alfa with the F-5000 cars further behind.\n\nThe F-1 cars have the potential to lap the fastest of the F-5000 cars, driven by Alfredo Costanzo, about five times. And despite the F-5000 cars being more powerful -- 545 horsepower compared with 525 for the Alfa and 495 for the Williams -- the F-1's are faster down the two Calder straights.\n\n'But the F-1 cars get on to full power out of the corners so much earlier than we do, so they're faster through the corners and also brake later,' said Costanzo, who is No. 3 in the grid with a lap time of 39.1 seconds."
