The story of the 1957 Australian Grand Prix at Caversham, Western Australia.

It was a contest between two of the titans of Australian motor sport in the 1950s â€“ Stan Jones and Lex Davison. The three-litre Maserati versus the three-litre ex-F1 Ferrari of Lex and a 70 lap final in soaring 104-degree heat. These brave legends wrestling their cars around the circuit is testing conditions makes for a fascinating story.
