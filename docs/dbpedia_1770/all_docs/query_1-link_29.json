        "text": "Killed Journalists\n\nThe trial on the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was continued before the Istanbul 14th High Criminal Court on 28 March. At the 17th hearing, the court board accepted the plaintiff lawyers' request for a revision of the report issued by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK). The court board chaired by Judge Rüstem Eryılmaz ruled to keep Yasin Hayal and Erhan Tuncel in detention. Hayal and Tuncel are two of a total of 19 defendants tried in the scope of this case. The court indicated that the charges pressed against them might change and that they might be punished according to Article 309 of the Turkish Criminal Law (TCK) on \"violation of the constitution\". The request of the plaintiff lawyers to hear Ahmet Samast, father of prime suspect Ogün Samast, as a witness was declined. The trial will be continued on 30 May. The defence lawyer of defendant Tuncel requested to broaden the investigation and objected to the file's transfer to the prosecution because from his point of view evidence had not been fully collected yet. However, the court dismissed this request. It was furthermore decided to bring eye-witnesses Emsale Çakmak and Cemal Yıldırım to court on compulsion and to wait for the reply of the Trabzon High Criminal Court on Duty related to witness Sinan Reşitoğlu. The trial against triggerman suspect Ogün Samast will be continued before the Sultanahmet (Istanbul) 2nd Juvenile High Criminal Court on 4 April.\n\nOn 29 March, the Trabzon 1st High Criminal Court continued the trial related to the Dink murder. In the scope of this trial, the then Provincial Gendarmerie Commander of Trabzon (eastern Black Sea coast), Colonel Ali Öz, stands accused of \"negligence of duty\" prior to the murder. The court accepted the request for co-plaintiff status submitted by the Dink family members Rakel Dink (widow of the slain journalist), their daughters Sera Dink and Delal Dink, their son Arat Dink and the journalist's brother Hosrof Dink. The Public Prosecutor demanded to dismiss the request for a merger of the trial at the Trabzon High Criminal Court with the murder case tried before the Istanbul 14th High Criminal Court and the procedures related to the murder handled by the Trabzon 2nd Magistrate Criminal Court because, according to the prosecutor, the case files lack legal and de facto connections. Defendant Öz's lawyer Sürmen also put forward that the trials were based on different laws and thus a merger would not be possible. Sürmen requested to drop procedures. However, the joint attorneys of the Dink family reiterated their request for a merger of the trials. The Prosecutor announced to review the case file of the Trabzon 2nd Magistrate Court and to communicate her opinion subsequently. The prosecutor is going to present her final view on the request of the defence lawyer in the coming hearing on 17 May.\n\n24 January, 18 years after the violent death of renowned Turkish journalist Uğur Mumcu, his family filed a criminal complaint about \"the officials who neglected the investigation and the prosecution of the real perpetrators and instigators\". Mumcu was killed on 24 January 1993 by the explosion of a bomb that had been placed at his car in front of his home. The regarding file was returned by the Court of Appeals twice. Only defendant Ferhan Özmen is currently serving an aggravated life sentence. A new case was opened in 2010 against four people who are alleged members of the \"Tawhid-Salaam Jerusalem Organization\" that was found responsible for the murder.\n\nThe Court of Appeals decided to have the murder trial of journalist Cihan Hayırsevener tried before the Istanbul 10th High Criminal Court instead of the Bandırma High Criminal Court. Hayırsevener, then General Publications Director of the Güney Marmara'da Yaşam newspaper ('Life in Southern Marmara') published in Bandırma (Balıkesir), was killed on 18 December 2009. A total of twelve defendants stand trial including triggerman suspect Serkan Erkkuş, Ilk Haber newspaper publishing coordinator Engin Arıcan, the Bandırma Deputy Mayor, Talip Yıldız, and members of the Kuruoğlu family who is publishing the Ilk Haber daily, namely İhsan Kuruoğlu, İlbey Kuruoğlu and Osman Kuruoğlu. Journalist Hayısevener had been threatened prior to his violent death because of his articles on corruption. The police detained 29-year-old Serkan Erakkuş in the context of the murder. Defendants Tolga Ö. and Ali T. were released pending trial.\n\nAttacks and Threats\n\nOn 25 March, employees of Kapadokya TVand the İhlas News Agency were beaten when they recorded footage after a road accident of a coach. Their cameras were broken. Executives of the Dorak Tourism Company had apparently said, \"You are undermining tourism\". The President of the Nevşehir Journalists Association (NGC), Muammer Başar, condemned the attack on the journalists and the destruction of their cameras.\n\nJournalist Murat Aktaş was allegedly threatened by the Chief Advisor of the Prime Minister, Turan Erol. When forwarding a question Erol told him, \"Don't make this kind of news, your newspaper might be closed\". Aktaş is working for Objektif newspaper, a local daily published in Amasya, a province in central Anatolia close to the Black Sea. Erol is the former head of the Capital Markets Board (SPK). While he answered questions related to economics, he did not comment on questions regarding journalists in custody and detention, Aktaş conveyed later on. Erol denied the allegation.\n\nJournalists were attacked when they were covering news on the killing of four people on 16 March in Adana (eastern Mediterranean coast). NTV news channel Adana representative Hamza Gül was taken to hospital due to injuries to his head and chest caused by severe beating. The Çukurova Journalists Association (ÇGC) condemned the attack.\n\nOn 23 February in Rize (eastern Black Sea coast), tension arouse upon the police stopping a convoy with young man who were bidding farewell to go to the military.

The attack was condemned by the Rize Journalists Association, the Rize Journalists and Reporters Association, the ÇGD Rize Branch and the Black Sea Media Representatives Association.\n\nJournalist and writer Mehmet Metiner was the target of an assassination plot. One person who allegedly prepared the plot was taken into custody. In his statement given to the police he said that he 'was thinking about killing Metiner but he called it off at the last moment because he felt regret'. Reportedly, a person with the initials K.B. had been following Metiner for a while. Allegations were put forward that K.B. was pushed towards making a correspondent statement when he was in police custody.\n\nThe Kabalcı Bookstore in Beşiktaş/Istanbul received a threat from youth members of the Rights and Equality Party (HEPAR) lead by Osman Pamukoğlu. Reason for the threat was the selling of the 2011 Agenda by Metis Publishing with the subtitle \"Against Racism, Discrimination and Hate Crimes\". The group picked a quarrel with employees of the publishing company because they interpreted a child figure depicted on the page of 10 November (day of Atatürk's death) as an insult to the memory of Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic. The figure on subject is also printed on the pages of 17 February, 3 March, 2, 16 and 23 June, 4, 18 and 25 August, 8, 15 and 29 September and 6 and 20 October. The Say Stop! to Racism and Nationalism Initiative and the Human Rights Foundation (İHD) protested the policies of \"concealing and threat\" displayed by the action.\n\nThe weekly Penguen humour magazine apologized after criticism of a caricature by Bahadır Baruter published on 9 February 2011. The caricature was subtitled, \"There is no god, religion is a lie\". Baruter himself was quoted by radikal.com.tr as saying, \"A lynch campaign was launched in the cyber world against the caricature published in my column. I am the sole creator of this idea and the drawing. As it was defined in the statement by the magazine, the column is a free space\".\n\nColumnist Adem Yavuz Arslan, Ankara correspondent for the Bugün ('Today') newspaper, was threatened by means of a parcel sent to his Office on 26 January less than two weeks after the release of his book on the assassination of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. Arslan is the author of the book \"An Armenian: The Hrant Dink Operation Codes\". The book revealed new facts about the murder. The parcel contained several bullets for an automatic Kalashnikov rifle and a white beret, it was announced. Arslan said that he was being threatened on the phone ever since his book had been published less than two weeks ago. With this incident, the dimensions of the threat assumed increased proportions, he claimed. Hence, the author requested protection from the police. The Turkish Journalists Association (TGC), the Media Association, the Turkish Publishers Association (TYB) and the Press Institute Association condemned the threat.\n\nJournalist Kazım Şen, owner of the usak.tv news site, was shot at in front of his house in Uşak (interior of western Turkey). He was injured at his foot. Supposed attacker Tekin Uğur (23) was arrested, the weapon was seized.

Yılmaz, concessionaire of the local Alternatif Doğuş Newspaper ('Alternative Generation'), recalled, \"After the mayor had pointed at me calling me the leader of a gang, his bodyguards and supporters walked me over and took me out of the room. They took the cassette from the Ekin TV cameraman by force and physically harassed me\".\n\nHüseyin Orhan, General Publications Director of the Değişim Media Group, was apparently threatened after news and comments written about Halil Posbıyık, Mayor of Ereğli (south-central Turkey). Orhan, also the owner of the www.ereglininsesi.com website ('Voice of Ereğli') filed a criminal complaint, as it was announced on 11 January. The Ereğli District Governor İbrahim Çay transferred Orhan's petition to the Police Directorate as an urgent matter.\n\nCaricaturist Bahadır Baruter announced that he was threatened and insulted via the internet because he designed a deck of cards with Ottoman figures resembling insects.\n\nArrests and Detentions\n\nFive journalists went to prison in the first quarter of 2011 on the grounds of their writings and books, namelyVedat Kurşun and Ozan Kılıç as former editors-in-chief of the Kurdish Azadiya Welat newspaper; Bedri Adanır, owner of Aram Publishing and executive of Hawar newspaper; the editorial manager of the İşçi Köylü ('Worker Peasant') newspaper, Barış Açıkel; and Proleterce Devrimci Duruş ('Proletarian Revolutionary Stance') newspaper writer Nevin Berktaş.

Together with reporter Çiftçi, many executives and employees of the BDP were detained under allegations of \"membership of an illegal organization\" in the scope of the operations. The group of detainees includes Mikail Atan, representative of the Mesopotamia Association of Those Losing their Relatives (MEYA-DER).\n\nOn 31 March, the Diyarbakır 6th High Criminal Court again rejected the request for the release of Bedri Adanır, owner of Aram Publishing and editorial manager of the Kurdish Hawar newspaper. Adanır is tried under allegations of \"propaganda for an illegal organization\" on the grounds of publishing a book by imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan. The case was postponed to 12 May.
