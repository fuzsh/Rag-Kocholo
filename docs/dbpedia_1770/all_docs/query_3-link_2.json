        "text": "Annual LGBT event in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nIstanbul Pride (Turkish: İstanbul Onur Yürüyüşü) is a pride parade and LGBT demonstration held annually in Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul since 2003. Participants assemble in Taksim Square before marching the entire length of İstiklal Avenue. It has been described as the first and biggest LGBT event in Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe event reached roughly 5,000 people by 2010. In 2013, the pride parade, with the attendance of Gezi Park protesters attracted almost 100,000 people.[1][2] The 2014 Pride was the biggest LGBT event in Turkey's history and attracted more than 100,000 people.[3] Since 2015 pride parades in Istanbul were denied permission by the Governorship of Istanbul authorities. The governors repeatedly stated that the denials were based on security concerns and public order, but critics claimed the bans were taken on a religious and ideological basis. Despite the refusal, hundreds of people defied the ban each year, which resulted in law enforcement intervention.[4]\n\nPoliticians that have joined Istanbul Pride are mainly from the opposition parties Republican People's Party (CHP) and Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe event first took place in 2003 and now occurs each year on either the last Sunday of June or the first Sunday of July, to mark the end of Istanbul pride week. About 30 people took part in the first Gay Pride Istanbul. The numbers have increased exponentially each year, reaching roughly 5,000 people by 2010. The 2011 gathering attracted over 10,000 people, therefore making Gay Pride Istanbul the biggest march of its kind in the Muslim majority countries.[5][6][7][8] The 2012 pride march, which took place on 1 July, attracted between 10,000 and 30,000 people.[9][10]\n\nOn 30 June 2013, the pride parade attracted almost 100,000 people.[1] The protesters were joined by Gezi Park protesters, making the 2013 Istanbul Pride the biggest pride ever held in Turkey.[2] The 2014 pride attracted more than 100,000 people.[3] The European Union praised Turkey that the parade went ahead without disruption.[11]\n\nSuppression since 2015\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Sunday 29 June 2015, Reuters reported that Turkish police used a water cannon to disperse the gay pride parade.[12] In 2016 the pride march was banned by the local government \"for the safety of our citizens, first and foremost the participants’, and for public order.\"[13] LGBT organizations have also not been allowed to make a press statement. The governate of Istanbul once again claimed that a gathering of LGBT would not be allowed. \"Within Law No: 5442, this request has not been approved due to the terror attacks that have taken place in our country and the area; because provocative acts and events may take place when the sensitivities that have emerged in society are taken into account; and because it may cause a disruption in public order and the people's- including the participants of the event- tranquility, security, and welfare.\".[14] Supporters of the Pride claimed this decision was religiously motivated and the event was banned because it would have take during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.[12]\n\nIn 2017 the Istanbul Governor's Office yet again banned the LGBT Pride Parade, citing security concerns and public order.[15]\n\nIn 2018, for the fourth consecutive year the Istanbul Governor's Office yet again banned the LGBT Pride Parade, citing security concerns and public order, but around 1,000 people defied the ban, they were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. 11 participants were arrested.[16][17]\n\nIn 2019, the Istanbul Governor's Office yet again banned the LGBT Pride Parade, citing security concerns and public order.[18] subsequently, opposition Member of the Grand National Assembly Sezgin Tanrıkulu of the Republican People's Party (CHP) lodged a parliamentary question to the Vice President of Turkey Fuat Oktay asking why the deputy governor of Istanbul had banned Istanbul Pride. He also asked how many LGBT members had been killed in the last 17 years, the time the ruling party Justice and Development Party (AKP) ruled the city, due to provocative hate speech, and raised concerns over discrimination against the LGBT community.[19][20] On 29 June, hundreds of people defied the ban, they were met with tear gas, shields, pepper gas and plastic bullets from the Police.[4][21]\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Istanbul Pride was held online in 2020. Some activists gathered in person at Mis Sokak, which had been the finale of the 2003 parade.[22]\n\nThe trend of suppression has continued. Blockades and tear gas were used in 2021 and 25 people were arrested.[23] in 2022, 373 were arrested. In addition to blockades, public transportation to Taksim square was shut down.[24]\n\nOrganizers\n\n[edit]\n\nLGBT organizations[25]\n\nKoç Üniversitesi \"KUir\" LGBTI+ Club\n\nBahçeşehir Üniversitesi \"Gri (Gender roles and identities)\" Kulübü\n\nBilkent Üniversitesi Think colorful!

Mersin, Edirne, Tarsus, Eskişehir, Izmir, Bodrum. Istanbul's local governments such as Ataşehir, Beşiktaş, Şişli, Kadıköy, Maltepe, Kartal also showed their sympathy.[26]\n\nIn 2019, shortly after the 2019 Turkish local elections opposition politician and Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem İmamoğlu stated that the ban can't be unruled as the right to give permission to demonstrations lies with the governorship and the governors of Turkish provinces are not elected but directly appointed by the presidency.[27]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nLGBT culture in Istanbul\n\nLGBT rights in Turkey\n\nBigudi Club, lesbian and queer nightclub and bar in Istanbul\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
