This document provides a summary of key cases related to personal data protection under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It discusses cases involving the collection and retention of personal data, including data reflecting sexual orientation, DNA/fingerprints, and GPS data. For GPS data specifically, it outlines two cases - Uzun v. Germany, where the Court found no violation of using GPS data for 3 months during a criminal investigation, and Ben Faiza v. France, where real-time GPS tracking of a vehicle violated the law but obtaining phone records did not. It also briefly summarizes a recent case on dismissal based on geolocation data from an employee's company vehicle.",
