By the invention of web 2.0 every sector start using social media as new type of communication in the 2010s. This new type of communication start dominating especially the new generation who start using social media more than the previous generations. The politicians start using social media as well as the others who want to attract the attention of their audience. This paper is about how politicians shape their communication by using social media in their promotion and marketing in the elections. In the first part of the paper there is a conceptual research about social media term and its updated specifications. In the second part of the paper the use of social media in politics and elections is explored historically with examples and case studies from the world. How do the politicians use social media in their election campaigns? What kind of interaction do they prefer? The research part of the paper contains the municipal elections that were done in Turkey in the 31st of March 2019. The research explores the social media use of the winners and losers of municipal elections done it Turkey in the two big cities İstanbul and Ankara. The research gives a detailed descriptive analyse of how the Turkish politicians used social media interaction in their competition in the local elections.\n\nDevelopment in technology over the years made social media a very powerful tool in advancing political interest and in shaping the political direction of our society. This paper analyses four articles that dealt with the relationship of social media and politics in Turkey.Relevant findings indicate the active usage of social media by politicians during campaigns for elections and during a Gezi protest against the government in 2013. The government also responded to the threat posed by social media by creating and expanding laws that restrict the content shared in social media. The online surveillance in particular allows the government to have access to any user’s information especially during emergency situations.\n\nThis paper, mainly accepting that web 2.0 has a contribution to the development of citizenship culture, examines the uses of Facebook by Turkish political parties and their leaders during the 2011 Turkish General Elections. By examining the relationship through the discursive practices of social media interface, this study reveals the possible converting effects of those practices of political parties by the usage of social media in the process of political communication. During the study, 9 Facebook accounts have been recorded for 3 months and analyzed by means of the quantitative and qualitative content analysis technique. Qualities of the accounts, such as customizations, information shared on the accounts, and the numbers of posts, have been examined for each account; topics, themes, styles, linguistic practices etc. have been examined for each post. Hence, this paper focuses on the opportunities offered by web 2.0 that have been used for election campaigning in Turkey, the mutual and interactive communication between the party and/or the candidate and the voters forming during the campaigning period, and the qualities of the online communications between the candidate and his/her competitors throughout the analysis of Facebook usage by both the party and the leaders.\n\nThe developments in the field of internet and computers have paved the way for the formation of social media and a new media was born. Also, these developments created new platforms for communication. Rapid changes have occurred especially in the last decade. These changes have led social media to develop and pervade into every aspect of our life. In this respect the web 2-based internet has offered people new social environments where they can share theid ideas, feelings and knowledge and even their creativity. Particularly, these developments in social media were seen for politicians as a new field of propaganda and political communication. For this reason, social media platforms are used as an important means for political advertising in election campaigns. This situation arising as a result of technologcial developments has given rise to the widespread appearance of political communication in social media platforms. The use of social media becomes highly important for politicians in political campaigns. Therefore, the notion of 'digital politics' and 'online politics' have found a place in the political and academic literature. This study is an examination of the working of campaigns taking place in social media during the 30 March 2014 local elections in Turkey. The use of Facebook in political campaigns as a means of political communication is analyzed using the content analysis method. In this way, the political discourses of AKP and CHP are compared on the basis of their campaigns in the last local elections.\n\nSocial media, generated by advances in internet technology, are heavily used by individuals of every age and every class both in Turkey and all over the world. Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ make virtual societies possible, and enable ideas, opinions and comments to be shared. This sharing of visual and auditory context without any limitations has produced a more democratic platform. The democratic structure specific to social media enables them to be used for social and political purposes. In this study, a research is conducted on social/political use of social media in Turkey. Results of the research revealed that majority of the participants (46.6%) spend 2 to 4 hours on social media and 75.6% of the participants use smart phones for social media access. 11.2% of participants stated that they use social media for political and social purposes. 78.9% of the participants use Twitter and Facebook for political/social information sharing. 67.7% of participants frequently use Twitter for political/social purposes. In terms of political issues, participants prefer to use social media for domestic affairs rather than international affairs. The most controversial result was about the participants' pessimistic attitude towards social media. Some part of the participants think that social media will not change anything in Turkey, and the other part states that social media usage will divide up the society. Detailed analyses are given throughout the article."
