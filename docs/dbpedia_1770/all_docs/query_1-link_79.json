        "text": "Turkey-Syria Earthquake Solidarity Appeal\n\nSolidarity with the people of Turkey and Syria. This is an urgent appeal for Solidarity and assistance.\n\nTens of thousands of people are dead, and hundreds of thousands are injured after earthquakes hit parts of Turkey and Syria.\n\nSolidarity with the People of Turkey (SPOT) is calling for donations to fund direct support and Solidarity with the ordinary people who are suffering now.\n\nThe money will be used mainly to fund the activities of the Turkish Food Industry Workers Union and the United Textile Weaving and Leather Workers Union. They are already providing important relief on the ground. In areas where they do not have networks, similar competent trade union bodies will be used.\n\nThe need, and the horror of what has occurred, are felt particularly strongly in Britain. More than half of those living here with Turkish and Kurdish roots come from the areas hit by the earthquakes.\n\nWhat are called “natural disasters” take place in a political and economic context.\n\nThe Turkish government did not heed warnings about the devastation earthquakes would cause. And it has been slow to provide relief to the 17 million people who are estimated to be affected. We demand no discrimination in who receives aid and who does not.\n\nSurvivors forced to flee their homes face freezing winter conditions, and people struggle to find safe shelter, water and food.\n\nExperts warn the quakes could continue for weeks or even months, so long-term support is needed. Every donation raised from this appeal will go towards relief efforts on the ground.\n\nPlease pay donations to the Solidarity with the People of Turkey. Account details are as follows:\n\nAccount name: Solidarity with the People of Turkey (SPOT)\n\nAccount Number: 20384900\n\nSort code: 60-83-01\n\nBrawl Erupts in Turkish Parliament During Debate on Jailed MP\n\nTwo opposition members of Turkey’s parliament were injured during a session that devolved into a fistfight over a jailed MP who had recently been stripped of his status. The scuffle began when Alpay Özalan, a lawmaker from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and a former professional footballer, physically attacked Ahmet Şık, a deputy from the Workers’ Party of Turkey (TİP), while Şık was delivering a speech.\n\nFootage from the incident, which quickly spread on social media, shows Özalan striking Şık, causing him to fall. As other lawmakers rushed to intervene, a broader fistfight ensued.\n\nThe session had been convened to discuss the situation of Can Atalay, a TİP politician who won a seat in the May 2023 elections but remains imprisoned despite rulings from the Constitutional Court calling for his release. Atalay is currently serving an 18-year sentence related to the Gezi Park protests, a 2013 anti-government movement. His trial has been widely criticized as politically motivated.\n\nDuring his speech, Şık harshly criticized the AKP, accusing its members of being part of what he described as the “biggest terrorist organization” in Turkey. He also referenced comments made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had labeled Atalay a “terrorist.” Şık’s remarks provoked an angry response from AKP lawmakers, leading to the violent confrontation.\n\nIn the aftermath of the brawl, opposition MPs condemned the violence. CHP leader Özgür Özel called the incident “shameful” and urged Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmuş to convene an urgent meeting of party leaders to address the situation. Özel highlighted the seriousness of the violence by pointing to the bloodstains left on the parliamentary floor.\n\nGülistan Koçyiğit, a lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party), and Okan Konuralp, a member of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), were among those injured while trying to break up the fight. Video footage showed drops of blood on the floor, indicating the severity of the injuries sustained.\n\nThe DEM Party issued a strong statement on socialmedia, accusing the AKP of turning the parliament into a “venue of violence” and expressing their determination to continue their political work despite the attacks. Other opposition MPs also took to social media, condemning the incident as a manifestation of “AKP fascism” and a crisis for democracy and the rule of law in Turkey.\n\nMehmet Emin Ekmen, a lawmaker from the Democracy and Progress Party (DEVA), posted a video showing parliamentary staff cleaning the blood from the floor, lamenting that the stains on Turkish democracy would remain.\n\nThe parliamentary session was called to debate the status of Can Atalay after the Constitutional Court declared his removal from parliament “null and void.” Despite two rulings from the Constitutional Court affirming Atalay’s rights, the Supreme Court of Appeals has refused to release him, creating a judicial crisis. The opposition has called for swift action to reinstate Atalay’s status and secure his release.\n\nAtalay, who was stripped of his parliamentary status in January following a contentious session, was elected to represent Hatay province while still behind bars. His case, along with that of other Gezi Park defendants, including businessman Osman Kavala, has become a symbol of the Turkish government’s crackdown on dissent following the 2013 protests.\n\nThe extraordinary session in parliament highlighted the deep political divisions in Turkey and the escalating tensions as opposition parties continue to challenge the ruling party’s approach to governance and the rule of law.\n\nTurkey Faces Backlash Over Stray Animal Slaughter Law\n\nFollowing the enactment of a law permitting the ‘slaughter’ of stray animals, disturbing reports of mass killings have emerged from various cities across Turkey. In the Altındağdistrict of Ankara, numerous dogs were discovered buried, revealing signs of torture and severe bodily harm. An investigation into this tragic incident is currently underway.\n\nThe controversial legislation, proposed by the AKP and recently passed by Parliament, has sparked images of animal cruelty from different locales. Animal rights activists, lawyers, and scholars have voiced strong opposition to the law since its inception, expressing concerns that it would result in the unnecessary killing of animals.\n\nIn a disturbing incident yesterday in Altındağ, numerous dogs were found dead and buried behind the AKP’s NiğdeMunicipality animal care facility. Reports indicated that many dogs were discovered in a fenced area, with evidence showing they had been tortured, buried in bags, and disposed of improperly.\n\nThe Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office has opened an investigation into the matter. During the investigation, the Director of Veterinary Affairs for Altındag Municipality defended the actions taken as compliant with the Animal Protection Law No. 5199. He claimed the animals were ‘ownerless’ and emphasized that local governments bear responsibility for such actions.\n\nRepeal the Law Now!\n\nSPOT, Solidarity with the People of Turkey, urgently demands the immediate repeal of the newly approved law targeting millions of stray dogs across Turkey. This law, widely condemned as the “massacre law,” has sparked outrage and resistance among Turkish citizens, who view it as a cruel and inhumane approach to animal welfare. The government’s decision, passed swiftly before the summer recess, mandates the removal of stray dogs from the streets, potentially leading to their euthanisation or placement in already overcrowded shelters. This legislation not only threatens the lives of countless innocent animals but also raises concerns about its potential misuse to target opposition-controlled municipalities.\n\nThe widespread discontent is evident as thousands have taken to the streets in protests across the country, from Istanbul’s Şişhane Square to the capital Ankara. These protests reflect the broader sentiment of the Turkish community, who see this law as a betrayal of ethical and compassionate principles. As protestors boldly stated, “Life and solidarity, not hatred and hostility, will win.” The opposition, led by the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has vowed to challenge the law in the Supreme Court, highlighting its moral, conscientious, and legal flaws.\n\nWe echo the calls from Turkish citizens and organisations for the government to cease this legislative action immediately. We call on all UK organisations, animal rights groups, political parties, trade unions, and concerned individuals must join us in this urgent plea. We urge you to write to the Turkish government officials in the UK, details mentioned below, demanding the immediate withdrawal of this deadly law. Together, we must stand against this injustice and work towards humane and compassionate solutions for the stray animal population in Turkey.\n\nTurkish Consulate London: consulate.london@mfa.gov.tr\n\nTurkish Embassy London: embassy.london@mfa.gov.tr\n\nNew Education Curriculum in Turkey Sparks Controversy: Critics Cite Religious and Authoritarian Leanings\n\nMinister Yusuf Tekin unveils ‘Turkey Century Education Model’ amidst scrutiny over its ideological underpinnings\n\nIn a move that has ignited widespread debate, Minister of National Education Yusuf Tekin has introduced a new educational curriculum titled the ‘Turkey Century Education Model’. This announcement comes amid criticism from various quarters regarding its content and approach, with detractors alleging a tilt towards religious and authoritarian ideologies.\n\nThe new curriculum, slated to be open for public feedback for nine days under the name ‘Turkey Century Maarif Model’, has already drawn sharp criticism. Critics argue that the curriculum reflects a market-oriented and reactionary approach that has characterised the AKP government’s educational policies. This marks the fourth major overhaul of the curriculum under the current administration, which has been accused of reshaping education without achieving its intended goals.\n\nAdnan Gümüş, a columnist and faculty member at Çukurova University, has been vocal in his critique, highlighting what he describes as a fundamental flaw in the curriculum’s philosophy. Gümüş points out that the curriculum emphasizes religious values, particularly Sunni Islam, over a comprehensive educational framework. He criticizes the curriculum for dictating religious identity and values to children instead of focusing on their holistic development.\n\nGümüş further contends that the curriculum’s emphasis on ‘virtue-value-action’ perpetuates a religious agenda that undermines modern educational principles. He raises concerns over the curriculum’s potential to stifle intellectual freedom by prioritizing religious and moral teachings over scientific inquiry and critical thinking.\n\nMoreover, critics have pointed out discrepancies in the government’s claims about the curriculum’s development process. Gümüş challenges the Ministry’s assertion that the curriculum was developed in consultation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including universities and educators. He argues that the curriculum lacks scientific rigor and fails to address the educational needs of students, teachers, and parents.\n\nThe introduction of the ‘Turkey Century Maarif Model’ comes against a backdrop of ongoing reforms in Turkey’s educational system, which has seen multiple changes in entrance exams and school policies under the AKP’s tenure. Critics argue that these reforms have not adequately addressed the core challenges facing education in Turkey, including teacher shortages and disparities in educational access.\n\nAs the new curriculum undergoes public scrutiny, questions remain about its implementation timeline and the readiness of schools and educators to adopt its provisions. Critics fear that rushed implementation could further exacerbate existing challenges in the education system, leaving students and teachers unprepared for the changes.\n\nIn conclusion, the unveiling of the ‘Turkey Century Maarif Model’ has sparked intense debate over the future direction of education in Turkey. While proponents see it as a step towards reinforcing national and spiritual values, critics argue that it risks marginalizing scientific inquiry and stifling academic freedom. The coming months are likely to see continued discourse and deliberation over the merits and implications of the new educational framework.\n\nA trustee was appointed again to the Hakkari Municipality\n\nA trustee was appointed once more to the Hakkari Municipality, located in the easternmost part of Turkey where Kurds predominantly live. Hakkari Co-Mayor Mehmet Sıddık Akış was detained in Van in the morning hours. While the police raided the municipality, the Ministry of Interior announced that a trustee had been appointed in place of Akış. The decision to appoint a trustee has drawn criticism.\n\nThe Kurdish people, who have been voting for the DEM Party for years, voted for it once again on March 31, electing it to manage the municipality. As in previous elections, Erdoğan, who lost this election as well, once again did not recognize the will of the Kurdish people. There have been reactions to this trustee practice in many parts of the country.\n\nTurkish Court Imposes Substantial Sentences on Pro-Kurdish Leaders\n\nSelahattin Demirtas, the former Co-Chairman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), along with other Kurdish politicians, has been convicted and sentenced to prison on charges related to the case involving the 2014 Kobani protests.\n\nA total of 108 HDP members were prosecuted in relation to the nationwide incidents that occurred on October 6-8, 2014. The trial commenced on April 26, 2021. The defendants faced 29 separate charges, with a request for life imprisonment for each charge, resulting in a total of 38 life sentences and a cumulative imprisonment period of 19,680 years.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas has been sentenced to 42 years in prison, and his detention will continue. FigenYüksekdağ, another Co-Chairman of the HDP, has been given a sentence of 30 years and 3 months of imprisonment. Ahmet Türk, a former Member of Parliament, has received a 10-year prison sentence.\n\nDuring the announcement of the 130-page verdict, the lawyers expressed their dissatisfaction with the decision by applauding and leaving the courtroom.\n\nIn the AKP Government in Turkey, 33 Thousand Workers Lost Their Lives in Work Accidents\n\nIn Turkey, under the AKP and Erdogan government, approximately 33 thousand workers lost their lives in work-related accidents. During the 22-year reign of the AKP, Turkey witnessed some of its worst work-related accidents in history.\n\nDespite significant negligence on the part of the government and state institutions, not a single resignation has been tendered to date. Only symbolic, short-term sentences have been handed down. None of the government or state officials have faced any penalties.\n\nEven in the case of the Soma mine disaster, where 301 miners lost their lives, only a few individuals managed to escape with short prison sentences. The legal proceedings have been ongoing for 10 years.\n\nSimilar incidents have occurred dozens of times, with the primary cause being the government’s failure to inspect workplaces and its tendency to produce superficial inspection reports.”\n\nAs for turning it into a web article, you might want to expand upon each point, provide context, and possibly include quotes from experts or affected individuals to add depth and credibility to the piece. Additionally, it’s important to maintain a neutral and objective tone in the article.\n\nTurkey: Everyone is now a “spy”\n\nTurkey’s partisan President (from the Islamist/Nationalist Justice and Development Party – AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, signalled a “softening process” aimed at compensating for his party’s defeat in local elections a few days ago by stating, “I want to initiate a softening process in Turkish politics.” Erdoğan’s move resonated with the main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), which came first in the local elections, and CHP leader Özgür Özel met with Erdoğan. However, opposition circles claimed that this, like Erdoğan’s previous statements, was the beginning of a more aggressive move in the opposite direction.\n\nRecently, Justice Minister Yılmaz Tunç gave clues in an interview with a pro-government newspaper about the new hardening move that the Erdoğan regime would take in this direction.\n\nMinister Tunç outlined the contours of a new judicial reform expected to come into effect soon in a newspaper close to the government. According to the report, the judiciary’s hand will be strengthened in defining the boundaries of “espionage” during the investigation process (dependent on the government).\n\nTunç stated that this regulation would define a “new type of espionage crime” and that it would be in line with the “needs of intelligence units.”\n\nIn a subsequent statement on the matter, Justice Minister Tunç said that a new crime would be defined under the Turkish Penal Code as an “influence agent.” He stated that this new “crime” is regulated against crimes committed through social media, beyond espionage and spying, and those who create room for black propaganda against Turkey would fall under the category of “influence agents.”\n\nThe day after this news, Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) released a video titled “What is Espionage” on public platforms. The video suggests that there is no clear definition of espionage and that almost any activity that could be considered against the “moral values and security of the country” falls under the definition of espionage. The inclusion of the sentence “Our citizens should not be involved in these espionage activities consciously or unconsciously” in the video implies that almost anything shared or criticized by journalists or the public could be subject to espionage investigations.\n\nInitial comments suggest that the primary target of this legal regulation is news that does not appear in print or visual media due to censorship but still attracts attention on social media.\n\nThe Erdoğan regime had begun preparations for “new espionage” and “influence agent” accusations in 2022 and had established a “disinformation combating centre” within the Presidency’s Communication Directorate to monitor, report, and profile opposition activities.\n\nJournalists Continue to Be Arrested in Turkey\n\nIn the past two weeks, approximately 20 journalists have been detained in Turkey. As the latest example of this trend, two journalists were detained in Diyarbakır last night following raids on their homes.\n\nConcerns over press freedom in the country are escalating. Journalists’ right to report critically is continuing to be restricted.\n\nNurcan Yalçın and Derya Us, residing in Diyarbakır, were detained as a result of the raids conducted in the city.\n\nThe Dicle Fırat Journalists Association issued a statement regarding the situation. The statement emphasized, “We do not know why journalists are being detained. However, journalism is not a crime.”\n\nRights groups routinely accuse Turkey of undermining media freedom by arresting journalists and shutting down critical media outlets, especially since President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan survived a failed coup in July 2016.\n\nTurkey is one of the world’s biggest jailers of professional journalists and was ranked 158th among 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) World Press Freedom Index published on May 3.\n\nSuch interventions targeting press freedom and journalists’ professional activities in Turkey continue to draw international attention. Calls for the protection of press freedom and freedom of expression are increasing. It is noted that such restrictions are concerning from the perspective of democratic values and human rights.\n\n288 people who participated in May Day demo detained, 38 arrested!\n\nOn May 1st, police attacked workers who wanted to demonstrate in Taksim Square in Istanbul and detained a total of 288 people. 38 people were arrested and placed in prison.\n\nAlthough demonstrating in Taksim Square is a constitutional right, the Erdoğan government arbitrarily banned it.\n\nOn May 1st, 247 people were detained, and yesterday and today, 41 people were detained by breaking down doors in the early morning.”\n\n“288 people who participated in May 1st were detained, 38 were arrested.\n\nOn May 1st, police attacked workers who wanted to demonstrate in Taksim Square in Istanbul and detained a total of 288 people. 38 people were arrested and placed in prison.\n\nAlthough demonstrating in Taksim Square is a constitutional right, the Erdoğan government arbitrarily banned it.\n\nOn May 1st, 247 people were detained, and yesterday and today, 41 people were detained by breaking down doors in the early morning.”\n\nTurkey’s trade with Israel breaks records\n\nAccording to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), exports to Israel have reached a record level since the conflicts began in October 2023. In March, exports to Israel amounted to $436,928,000. Export figures between October 2023 and February 2024 were as follows: $347,868,000; $319,207,000; $429,054,000; $349,481,000; $422,059,000; $436,928,000.\n\nSo, while Erdogan declares support for the Palestinian people on the one hand, on the other hand, many products, including those used in military activities, are being sent to Israel. As previously announced, a significant portion of these goods is being transported by ships belonging to Erdogan’s close relatives.\n\nMay Day demonstration banned from Taksim Square!\n\nTaksim Square, known for its historical significance as the site of the Gezi resistance in 2013 and the tragic May Day demonstration in 1977 where 37 workers lost their lives, has been banned for this year’s May Day demonstration.\n\nThe decision has faced criticism from labour unions, who argue that workers should have the right to choose the square they wish to gather in on the International Day of Unity and Struggle. However, the Minister of Interior has defended the ban, claiming that Taksim Square is not an appropriate location for demonstrations.\n\nTaksim Square has the capacity to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people, making it an ideal venue for large-scale gatherings. However, it is believed that the real motive behind the ban is the fear of worker protests by the ruling AKP and President Erdogan. In recent years, security forces have responded to worker protests with force, suppressing even the smallest demands for rights.\n\nNine Journalists Detained in Istanbul and Ankara Police Operations\n\nThis morning, police operations were carried out against journalists in Istanbul and Ankara. In a house raid conducted in Ankara, Mehmet Aslan, a reporter for Mezopotamya Agency (MA), was detained.\n\nIn house raids conducted in Istanbul, MA reporter Esra Solin Dal, Enes Sezgin from Yeni Yaşam newspaper, as well as journalists Saliha Aras, Yeşim Alıcı, Beste Argat Balcı, Şirin Ermiş, and Erdoğan Alayumat were detained. Former MA reporter Doğan Kaynak was also detained in a house raid in Urfa.”\n\nPress Freedom Under Siege: More Journalists Face Prosecution in Turkey”\n\nAnother journalist in Turkey is confronting criminal prosecution for the publishing of news and opinion.\n\nJournalist Oktay Candemir faces investigation following complaint filed by Abdulahat Arvas, the AKP Van Metropolitan Municipality Candidate, resulted in an investigation being launched against journalist Oktay Candemir on charges of “insulting a public official” during the local elections. However, it is important to note that Arvas does not hold any public office.\n\nDuring his statement, Candemir emphasized the importance of press freedom and stated, “Abdulahat Arvas is a politician, and I exercised my right to criticize individuals of public interest, which falls within the scope of press freedom.”\n\nCandemir raised concerns about the impact of the investigations and lawsuits on his ability to practice journalism. He expressed his frustration with the pressures faced by journalists, saying: “The government has been consistently exerting pressure on journalists for a significant period of time. We observe the frequent use of legal measures against journalists. Every news article or social media post we publish is immediately treated as a criminal act. Journalists are being detained and arrested. In recent events in Van, we witnessed police officers attacking journalists who were documenting incidents, attempting to hinder their work.”\n\nOver the past decade, hundreds of journalists have been indicted, convicted, or imprisoned for news coverage deemed undesirable by the Turkish state. Turkish state must stop the systematic harassment and intimidation of journalists and media workers, who are simply doing their job and exercising their right to freedom of expression.\n\nMigrant shops are being closed\n\nBurcu Köksal, from the main opposition social democratic party CHP, who became the mayor of Afyon City in the local elections held on March 31, closed the unlicensed shops of migrants. Köksal also said she would send the migrants back to their home countries.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Burcu Köksal, who said that if she won the mayoralty, she would not allow DEM Party supporters, who are mostly Kurds, into the municipal building, closed 5 unlicensed shops belonging to refugees.\n\nKnown for her racist approaches, Köksal targeted the refugees by saying, ‘We promised our voters, we told them that we would send them, the Syrians, from this country without ‘no if’s’ or ‘no but’s'”\n\nMassacre and Trade are separate\n\nThe Turkish government and AKP’s response to public calls for cutting trade with Israel has stirred significant interest. Nihat Zeybekci, AKP Vice Chairman and Head of Economic Affairs delivered a notable response by drawing a line between the atrocities and commercial ties, stating, “Massacre is one thing, trade is another.”\n\nZeybekci’s remarks highlighted the complexity of the situation: “We condemn the massacre. But some of our colleagues trade with Israel. We have a trade agreement with Israel. We sell 6 and buy 1.” He emphasized the distinction between political condemnation and economic necessity, pointing out, “We sell them six [items] and buy one from them. This trade is useful, but we are working to be more sensitive about it.”\n\nIn contrast to the Finance Minister’s statement on implementing trade restrictions due to public outcry, Zeybekci maintained that his colleagues are continuing trade activities.\n\nDespite widespread demands across various sectors for an immediate halt to this trade, which many believe contributes to the suffering of Gaza civilians, Erdogan’s son Burak Erdogan and individuals with close government ties persist in such transactions. This ongoing trade has drawn criticism despite Turkey’s official stance against Israel’s actions in Gaza, showing that economic interests sometimes outweigh political rhetoric.\n\nZeybekci’s remarks have come under intense scrutiny at a time when Turkey’s trade relations with Israel are facing heightened scrutiny. His comments sparked anger among Turks, who took to social media to express their discontent.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Zeybekci defended his position, stating, “I stand by every word I said. Our trade agreement with Israel, which was not suspended even during the Mavi Marmara incident, allows our Palestinian brothers and sisters to buy Turkish goods, which improves our trade balance.”\n\nThe revelation of trade between Turkey and Israel, including transactions involving individuals close to President Erdoğan despite his anti-Israel rhetoric, was first brought to light by investigative journalist Metin Cihan in late November. Cihan continues to report on this commerce using official statistics and maritime traffic websites, all of which are publicly accessible.\n\nPolitical Prisoners Remain Detained\n\nThe detention of political prisoners, including HDP Co-Chair Selahattin Demirtaş, continues as the court rejected the request for their release. The decision hearing has been postponed to May 16 due to procedural deficiencies and time constraints. Despite being held for nearly 8 years, the reasons for their detention remain unclear. This situation raises concerns about the politicization of the judiciary and the lack of transparency in legal proceedings. The expectation that President Erdoğan will play a role in deciding the fate of these politicians further highlights the challenges facing the rule of law in Turkey.\n\nThe request for the release of the 18 politicians, including Selahattin Demirtaş, was based on the argument that the court proceedings were incomplete and that the time given was insufficient for a fair trial. Despite being in prison for a significant period, the reasons for their detention have not been adequately explained, fuelling concerns about the political motivations behind their incarceration. The expectation that President Erdoğan will be the one to decide the fate of HDP politicians underscores the politicization of the judiciary and executive branches of government in Turkey. This situation reflects broader concerns about the erosion of democratic principles and the rule of law in the country.\n\nStatement from the Ministry of Treasury and Finance regarding the Istanbul Convention and LGBTI+\n\nThe Ministry of Treasury and Finance clarified that the loans provided by the World Bank in cooperation with Turkey do not have any relation to the Istanbul Convention and LGBTI+ issues.\n\nIn a written statement released by the Ministry, it was emphasised that the allegations circulating on social media regarding the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), which serves as a roadmap for the 5-year collaboration with the World Bank, are baseless. The statement highlighted, “Since our membership in the World Bank in 1947, a total of 52 billion dollars in financing has been provided. These funds are utilised within the scope of development priorities through projects jointly developed by our relevant institutions and the World Bank. The use of funds provided by the World Bank is strictly in line with the objectives of the projects.”\n\nIt was noted that the World Bank loans aim at sustainable growth focused on poverty reduction and equitable sharing of prosperity. The statement clarified, “The utilisation of these resources considers the common interest of society. The term ‘vulnerable groups’ mentioned in the CPF primarily refers to individuals working in professions adversely affected by the green transformation and those facing difficulties in accessing financing. Through World Bank projects, skills are imparted to these groups to integrate them into production, thereby increasing employment and reducing poverty. Therefore, these loans have no relation to the Istanbul Convention and LGBT issues.” The statement also highlighted the significant role of the World Bank in the utilisation of grant support provided by the European Union under the Financial Support Program for Refugees (FRIT). Indicators related to such support are monitored in the CPF document. However, there is no provision for any loan from the World Bank specifically for refugees in the new CPF document. The statement concluded with a commitment to continue working with the World Bank to support our development goals and to generate added value through the large-scale projects we have developed.\n\nStatement from the Disinformation Combat Center\n\nThe Disinformation Combat Center stated, “Support for LGBTI is not included in the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) signed with the World Bank.”\n\nIn a social media post, the DCC clarified, “The claim circulating on some social media accounts that ‘World Bank project financing will be provided for LGBTI support and refugee employment’ is not accurate. Support for LGBTI is not included in the Country Partnership Framework signed with the World Bank. Within the framework of the program, the term ‘vulnerable groups’ refers to individuals working in professions adversely affected by the green transformation and those facing difficulties in accessing financing. While indicators related to grant support provided by the EU for refugees in our country are monitored in the CPF document, there is no provision for any financial support from the World Bank specifically for refugees.”\n\nWhy should trade unionists in the UK support SPOT?\n\nSolidarity with the People of Turkey was established to support those struggling for democracy and fundamental freedoms in Turkey, whilst also contributing to the working people’s struggle in the UK.\n\nPeople often ask why international work has anything to do with trade unions in the UK. As trade unionists, we understand the need for solidarity. It runs through everything that we do, from standing on picket lines, to attending marches and rallies and to the core work that we do in our workplaces defending workers’ rights.\n\nSolidarity knows no borders and that is why supporting trade union partners globally is an essential part of the work that we do. We know that attacks on our rights, working conditions and salaries do not differ from those of workers struggling in other parts of the world.\n\nSPOT has stood with those in Turkey fighting for democracy and human rights. We know that despite huge attempts to silence them the working people of Turkey have fought back against this. It is particularly powerful to see the struggle among women to defend their rights to self-autonomy, to education and equality.\n\nWe also know that academics and education workers have been at the forefront of the struggle to freedom of speech and for free and equal access to education.\n\nWe know as workers of the essential need for international solidarity, we know that our struggles are intertwined and that none of us can be free until all of us are free.\n\nThat is the reason that trade unions need to support and be actively involved with SPOT to enable us to stand in solidarity with those in struggle, to amplify their voices and to hold to account the current ruling regime for its attacks on democracy, human rights and civil liberties.\n\nMake sure your union branch is affiliated, invite a SPOT speaker to your next meeting and get involved in our actions to defend democracy and human rights in Turkey.\n\nTurkey’s Complicity: Unveiling the Hypocrisy in Erdogan’s Stance on Gaza\n\nThe recent police beating and arrests of over 40 people in Istanbul for protesting the genocide in Gaza underlines the rank hypocrisy of the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nThose demonstrating had embarrassed the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) by highlighting Turkey’s continued economic ties to Israel.\n\nAnother march in the city of Konya raised the slogan “Murderer Israel, Collaborator AKP”.\n\nSupport for the Palestinians is very widespread in Turkish society. Erdoğan has made repeated statements denouncing Israel. He has increasingly tried to pose as a friend of the Palestinians and a tenacious opponent of imperialism. But like every other utterance from his regime, it is a lie.\n\nMany people have seen through the pretence and it was one reason why the AKP lost millions of votes in the 31 March elections.\n\nA few days after the elections, the Turkish Ministry of Trade said it would no longer send to Israel items in 54 categories spanning iron and steel products, jet fuel, construction equipment, machines, cement, granites, chemicals, pesticides and bricks.\n\nBut this was an admission that until then such trade had gone on seamlessly despite the horrors in Gaza.\n\nTurkey will be a key site for the US if Israel’s provocations against Iran, Lebanon and Yemen trigger a wider regional war.\n\nErdogan host US and Nato bases, including Incirlik Air Base in Adana and the Kürecik Radar Base in Malatya.\n\nJournalist Metin Cihan has revealed damning facts about Turkey’s links with Israel despite the attacks on Gaza.\n\nLast December he reported that Turkish companies shipped four million tonnes of goods to Israel on 400 ships since 7 October. These companies included major belonging to important figures in the AKP.\n\n“We are sending fuel to Israel, covering its raw material needs, and a Turkish company produces over 7 percent of Israel’s electricity,” Cihan explained, adding that Turkey also supplies the barbed wire used by Israel.\n\nCihan said, “We deliver oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to Israel without any hindrance,” and “Turkey meets 65 percent of Israel’s steel requirement,” a critical component in warfare and general construction.” The authorities have now forced Cihan into exile.\n\nThe Turkish regime is not an enemy of Zionism, it is fully complicit in its filthy policies.\n\nOur solidarity goes to all those who are protesting against Erdoğan and seeking to build real support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe individuals who expressed their opinion of ‘Ceasing trade with Israel’ were apprehended.\n\nIn Taksim, Istanbul, 43 individuals expressing their desire to sever trade relations with Israel were apprehended. President Erdogan and the AKP government’s strong rhetoric against Israel has consistently sparked reactions. However, the recent developments have caused a significant backlash in Turkey, which has also been reflected in the election results. Despite widespread public support for cutting off trade with Israel, Erdogan has refrained from taking any actions that may upset Israel. Alongside protests in various cities, yesterday’s demonstration in Istanbul led to the detention of 43 individuals, with 38 being released at midnight while investigations continue for the remaining 5. Numerous opposition parties have condemned the detentions and criticized Erdogan for his perceived double standards.\n\nOpposition figure who ousted Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s nominee restored to Van’s mayoral position\n\nTurkish authorities have yielded to significant protests in the southeastern city of Van, reversing their decision to disqualify an opposition politician who secured victory over the candidate from President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling party in Sunday’s election.\n\nVan, a vibrant city situated near Turkey’s border with Iran, erupted into jubilant celebrations on Wednesday and Thursday following the announcement by the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) that its mayoral candidate would indeed receive the mandate to govern.\n\nPreviously, provincial authorities had disqualified DEM candidate Abdullah Zeydan and announced plans to replace him as co-mayor with a runner-up from Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP).\n\nZeydan had triumphed over AKP candidate Abdulahat Arvas by a significant margin of 28 percentage points in Sunday’s race, securing 55 per cent of the vote, as reported by the state-run Anadolu news agency. Overall, DEM clinched victories in 10 provincial capitals, compared to eight in 2019.\n\nThe reversal occurred following intense protests that rocked Van after Sunday’s local elections, marking the AKP’s worst defeat since its inception over 20 years ago, co-founded by Erdoğan.\n\nInitially pledging non-interference in the outcomes, Erdoğan and his government mostly accepted results in major cities across western Turkey. However, the AKP initiated a recount in Istanbul’s Beykoz district after its mayoral candidate was defeated by the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP). Despite this, the country’s election board eventually upheld the result, cancelling the recount, as confirmed by the CHP on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, in Istanbul, CHP member Ekrem İmamoğlu successfully defended his position as mayor against the AKP’s strong attempts to regain control of the municipality. However, disputes between the CHP and AKP continued in other races in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, as of Thursday.\n\nIn Van, located in the southeast with a significant Kurdish population, outrage erupted over the interference in its election process. Following the resistance of the Kurdish people, allies, and the democratic public, it was decided to award the election certificate to Abdullah Zeydan, co-mayor of Van Metropolitan Municipality, as announced by DEM in a statement on Wednesday night.\n\nThe clashes between police and demonstrators in Van echoed the Gezi Park protests from a decade ago, initially starting in Istanbul but later evolving into one of the most significant national public uprisings against Erdoğan since he assumed power at the beginning of the millennium.\n\nA resident of Van described chaotic scenes on Tuesday night, with fires everywhere and the constant sound of police tear gas bombs, likening the situation to a war zone.\n\nErdoğan suffered defeat in the local elections yet persists in lawlessness!\n\nTurkey has been governed unlawfully for years. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who obtained a majority in the government, tries to do as he pleases in the country. He disregards judicial decisions and does not grant any freedom to his people. Even in elections, he always stayed in power through various fraudulent means.\n\nHowever, he suffered a major defeat in the recent elections. In the local elections held on March 31, 2024, Erdoğan received fewer votes from another party for the first time since 2002 and lost many of the municipalities he held. This means Erdoğan can no longer use the municipal budgets as he wishes. With the municipal rents, Erdoğan has bought ships for his children, made ministers and party friends billionaires, and completely handed over the country to capital groups.\n\nIt is evident that a significant portion of the people felt great joy at the outcome of the recent elections. A people who have been thirsty for victories for years and have been subjected to constant oppression, torture, and imprisonment naturally celebrated the election victory.\n\nWhile the social democrat party CHP dealt a heavy blow to Erdoğan by winning most major cities, the DEM Party maintained its strength in Kurdish provinces and won the municipalities of all cities where trustees were previously appointed.\n\nErdoğan couldn’t stomach this and through judicial means annulled the mayoralty of the DEM candidate in the city of Van. Despite receiving 55% of the vote, Abdullah Zeydan had his mayoralty taken away and handed over to the candidate of Erdoğan’s party, AKP, who only received 27% of the votes.\n\nHowever, the people objected to this. Despite the immediate ban on demonstrations by the governorship, people took to the streets to protest. Many parties, including CHP and the Labor Party (EMEP), expressed their objections. In a city in the west, people also protested, and ultimately the Supreme Election Council had to reverse its unjust decision and give the mayoralty to Abdullah Zeydan.\n\nIn many parts of the country, AKP and security forces intervened in the elections and handed over the mayoralties to AKP candidates. In many cities, soldiers were mobilized to cast votes, ensuring the victory of AKP candidates. Despite this, Erdoğan, who suffered a significant loss of power, is preparing for new attacks.\n\nEconomic problems in the country are worsening. According to ENAK, inflation has exceeded 124%. A retiree can only afford 15 kilos of meat with their pension. Rents have surpassed salaries. Minimum wage earners can no longer afford to educate their children. Erdoğan constantly deceives retirees and workers about wages, while billionaires increase and workers become impoverished.\n\nErdoğan and the AKP government constantly lie upon lies. In the Palestinian issue, they appear as if they support Palestine and the people of Gaza. However, they continue to expand their trade with Israel. They do not even respond to calls for embargoes.\n\nDue to poverty, the complete disregard of democracy, and the denial of freedom of expression to anyone, the people punished Erdoğan. They did not vote for his party in these local elections.\n\nThese elections once again showed that Erdoğan’s hypocritical and deceitful policies have become evident. The British government, which benefits from these policies and only thinks about doing business, must now act according to reality. Britain and the Sunak government need to suspend all relations with the Erdoğan government, which pursues anti-democratic and aggressive policies.\n\nUnions and professional associations issue a statement in response to the passing of 29 workers\n\nTrade unions and professional organizations made a statement regarding the fire that broke out during renovation at the Masquerade Club, a nightclub on the ground floor of a 16-story building in Beşiktaş Gayrettepe, resulting in the deaths of 29 workers.\n\nThe Istanbul Regional Representation of DİSK, the Istanbul Branches Platform of KESK, the Istanbul Coordination Board of TMMOB, and the Istanbul Chamber of Physicians members gathered in front of the Masquerade Club where the fire broke out, drawing attention to the negligence and stated, “Enough is enough! Let’s stop workplace accidents and worker fatalities.”\n\n“POISONOUS AND ASPHYXIATING GASES CAUSED THE WORKERS TO SUFFOCATE”\n\nReading the press release, TMMOB Provincial Secretary Seyfettin Avcı stated that yesterday, the team wanting to conduct a technical examination regarding the fire was not allowed access, and said, “People living and working in the area were consulted, and images shared previously about the place where the fire broke out were examined. According to this information: The fire occurred as a result of the spread of sparks of unknown origin during renovation works in a publicly accessible establishment operated as an entertainment center on the 2nd basement floor (-0.00 m) of the 16-story building. The sparks infiltrated the building materials used for the renovation of the establishment, reached petroleum-based building materials that should definitely not be used in this venue, and ignited these building materials. As a result, poisonous and asphyxiating gases quickly spread throughout the venue, causing the workers engaged in renovation work to run out of oxygen in a very short time, unfortunately resulting in deaths.”\n\n“A MASSACRE LIKE THIS CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT SERIOUS NEGLIGENCE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE”\n\nAvcı, stating that there was no emergency exit in the entertainment venue located under a multi-story residential building and where hundreds of people could be present at any moment according to the information obtained, said, “Similar situations are observed in many entertainment venues. In such places, it is likely that there will be other incidents that will harm many people, both workers and visitors. Municipalities, especially those places where there are many people and high risk of fire, such as entertainment venues, should regularly inspect workplaces and residences. Such inspections should not only be based on license applications or complaints. Municipalities need to carry out these activities with expert engineers in fire prevention. During the extensive renovation works apparent in this workplace, it is primarily the responsibility of the business owners and the contractors renovating the building to take necessary precautions for the safety of both the workers and the occupants of the building. A massacre of such magnitude, in which 29 people died, cannot happen without serious negligence of those responsible. The perception being created in public opinion through capital and official institutions that ‘work accidents happen due to the mistakes of workers’ is completely misleading. Planning for worker health and safety should prioritize from the planning stage to the organization, equipment used, chemicals used, and collective protection measures to be taken, and these should be done by employers, not individually by workers. The consequences of not taking these measures can be seen from the fact that at least 7 workers die in work accidents on average every day in our country.”\n\n“LESSONS ARE NOT LEARNED FROM THE OCCURRED WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS”\n\nAvcı, stating that in the current conditions, only the public can act as a restrictor against capital, which does everything to increase its profits and disregards human life, continued his words as follows: “However, public institutions also do not fulfill these duties. The failure of the relevant units of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and municipalities to carry out inspection and enforcement duties against these practices, which jeopardize both worker health and safety and the lives of people in the vicinity, magnifies the incident. Additionally, similar catastrophes could occur at any moment. The responsible parties for the massacre in Gayrettepe are both the operators of the establishment and the public officials who failed to carry out inspection duties. Regulations that prioritize human life over profit must be made to prevent further massacres. Lessons are not learned from the occurred workplace accidents due to the pro-capital government policies and municipal administrations. The power and municipal administrations that go hand in hand with capital and do not learn from the explosions that occurred in Davutpaşa in 2008, in OSTIM in 2011, in Marmara Park Shopping Mall in 2012, and the explosion in Bayrampaşa in 2017 are the real culprits of these massacres.”\n\nWorkers trapped in goldmine after landslide destruction\n\nSearch and rescue operations are currently underway for the nine workers who are trapped in the collapsed heap leach at the Çöpler Gold Mine, which is owned by Anagold Mining in the İliç district of Erzincan. This incident has once again brought attention to the country’s poor safety record, as previous calls to shut down the Copler mine were ignored.\n\nRescuers are searching through cyanide-contaminated soil to save the workers who were trapped when 10 million cubic meters of sludge rolled over their open pit on 13 February 2024. The mine is operated by the private company Anagold and is the second-largest gold-producing mine for SSR Mining. Eighty per cent of Anagold is owned by SSR Mining, a company based in Denver, United States, and Turkey-based Lidya Madencilik and Calik Holding.\n\nThe Çöpler mine was previously closed in 2020 due to a cyanide leak caused by a burst pipe into the river. It was reopened two years later after the company was fined and a cleanup operation was conducted. Despite local efforts to shut it down, the mine continued its operations.\n\nEnvironmentalists are concerned that the cyanide and sulphuric acid used in the gold extraction process could potentially contaminate the Euphrates River, which flows from Turkey to neighbouring Syria and Iraq. However, the Ilic Nature and Environment Platform, a local pressure group, has stated that the stream has already mixed with the Euphrates, and instead of sealing off the stream, they are urging authorities to close down the mine.\n\nThe Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects said on Wednesday that the government should close the Çöpler mine in the eastern town of Ilic “immediately”. The union stated that their previous warnings about a potential disaster had been disregarded. “All those responsible for the disaster should be held accountable before the judiciary,” it said in a statement. “All environmental impact reports should be cancelled and the plant should be closed immediately.”\n\nTurkey has a significant history of poor mine safety. In 2022, an explosion at the Amasra coal mine on the Black Sea coast claimed the lives of 41 workers. The country’s most devastating mining disaster occurred in 2014 at a coal mine in Soma, western Turkey, where 301 people lost their lives. Following these incidents, engineers warned that safety risks were frequently disregarded and inspections were not adequately carried out.\n\nphoto: protesters gather in Denizli against mining massacre (Evrensel)\n\nImprisoned MP Can Atalay loses MP status\n\nTurkey’s parliament revoked the status of the jailed opposition MP today after the judicial crisis between two of the country’s top courts.\n\nCan Atalay was elected to parliament as an MP for Hatay from TIP in the May 2023 elections. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison in the Gezi trial.\n\nAtalay’s applications for his release to perform his MP duties were rejected by the Court of Cassation despite a Constitutional Court ruling that his rights to be elected were violated.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Appeals had referred its own verdict to the parliament that Atalay should be stripped of MP status, alleging that the Constitutional Court exceeded its authority.\n\nAtalay lost his status as a member of parliament during the General Assembly of the Parliament today, which saw protests from DEM, TİP, EMEP and other opposition deputies.\n\nphoto credit: Evrensel\n\nAKP Government’s Discriminatory Policies Fuel Islamic Extremism and Violence\n\nThe discriminatory policies of Erdogan’s AKP government have created a hostile environment that led to the unfortunate armed attack during the Sunday mass at the Saint Maria Italian Catholic Church in Sarıyer district of İstanbul on January 28, where one person died.\n\nThe Islamic State jihadists claimed responsibility for the attack. The organisation stated that the attack was carried out in response to the call of ISIS leaders to target Jews and Christians everywhere.\n\nThe hate speeches propagated by President Erdogan and the discriminatory actions of the AKP party have undeniably played a significant role in inciting the attack. Their divisive language and policies have created an environment of hostility and intolerance, leading to the rise of extremism and violence. Erdogan and the AKP Party must recognise the consequences of their words and policies.\n\nphoto credit: Pi István Tóth\n\nSolidarity with Ozak Textile Workers\n\nWe once again call for solidarity with the Özak Textile workers, whose hearts beat with courage in different countries around the world!\n\nÖzak Textile workers have been exercising their right to choose a union in the face of oppression, mobbing, and slave-like conditions at the workplace since the 27th of November.\n\nThe voices of these workers have been attempted to be silenced through pressure, bans, gas, rubber bullet and baton attacks, and mass detentions.\n\nThose who turn a deaf ear to the Özak workers, drowning in oppression, will hear our voice!\n\nOur demands are clear:\n\nRehire all dismissed workers!\n\nRespect the workers’ right to choose a union, and end the pressure to change unions!\n\nPay the wages for the days spent in the protest!\n\nÖzak workers will prevail through solidarity!\n\nSaturday, 20 January 2024\n\n2pm\n\nLevi’s Regent Street\n\n176 Regent Street, London W1B 5TJ\n\n#LevisTakeAction #ZaraTake Action\n\nUPDATED: Is Erdogan’s one-man rule the end of democracy in Turkey?\n\nAs in previous years, the SPOT conference will discuss a range of issues generated by the experiences and struggles of workers and campaigners in Turkey. It will address the most recent attack on trade unions, women’s rights, LGBT+ people and climate activists.\n\nIt will seek to put this in a wider context of the drive to win greater equality, democratic freedom and justice globally.\n\nSPOT is an umbrella group made of progressive organisations, campaign groups and trade unions in Britain. It aims to support those struggling for democracy and fundamental freedoms in Turkey. You can visit its website at spotturkey.co.uk\n\nThere will be a broad range of speakers from Britain, Turkey and internationally at the conference (more TBC).\n\nClick here to register your interest.\n\nFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!\n\nSPOT stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine and calls for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the siege of Gaza. We condemn the killing of Israeli civilians by Hamas and the response of the Israeli government to collectively punish the Palestinian people.\n\nFollowing the attacks on the 7th of October, Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was now at war with Palestinians, but the reality is that Israel has been waging a decades-long war, enacted to enforce a system of occupation, apartheid and colonisation.\n\nThe current assault on Gaza has included the bombing of hospitals, schools and other public buildings. The total blockade has prevented the entry of food, water, fuel and medical supplies. These acts of collective punishment and indiscriminate killing are prohibited under international law. The Israeli government has said it plans a weeks-long brutal assault on the Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million residents, including a ground invasion.\n\nIsraeli politicians and military leaders are using genocidal language and threats. The Tory UK Government is backing the Israeli Government. Shamefully, Labour under the leadership of Keir Starmer has not demanded an immediate ceasefire. We call for this, and the opening of a humanitarian corridor to allow vital humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nAs SPOT we are also concerned about the absence of international action and assistance for the Palestinian people. Turkey and other nations need to reassess their trade and political relations with Israel right away to demonstrate their actions rather than words. Erdoğan needs to act immediately and stop trying to mislead the political arena with crocodile tears.\n\nThere was hardly $1 billion in trade between the two nations in 2002 when Erdogan took office. This trade volume rose under Erdogan. This sum increased to $6 billion in 2014. While Israel was purchasing more raw materials and oil products from Turkey, Turkey was purchasing tanks and other armaments from Israel. Erdogan temporarily cut off ties with Israel. However, business relations persisted even throughout this time.\n\nWe are concerned by the rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia following the escalation of hostilities. We must work to build unity between people and oppose racism wherever it happens.\n\nWe support any workers and their unions who refuse to make or supply arms to the Israeli state. SPOT recognises that only through the achievement of the rights of the Palestinian people will a lasting peace be achieved.\n\nphoto credit: think0\n\nSPOT urges solidarity with Rojava amid ongoing attacks\n\nThe Turkish government’s bombardment of the autonomous Kurdish administration in northeast Syria (Rojava), which began two days ago, amounts to the collective punishment of the Kurdish people in the region.\n\nErdogan’s Islamist regime is targeting infrastructure facilities and civilian settlement areas in Rojava.\n\n“The infrastructure in the north and east of Syria is a legitimate target for the security forces, the military, and the intelligence service,” said Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of the country on Wednesday.\n\nFidan was known for his leaked recording of a discussion of a possible military action in Syria back in 2014 when he was the head of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT). Back then, he was saying that if there is a need for justification to attack Syria, “the justification is, I will send four men to the other side. I get them to fire eight missiles into empty land. That’s not a problem. Justification can be created.”\n\nThis time, Fidan justified the recent bombardments after the attack on the interior ministry in Ankara on the first of October, just hours before Parliament was set to reopen after its three-month summer recess with an address by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) claimed responsibility. Fidan alleged that the militants who conducted the attack had trained in Syria. The Kurdish-led autonomous administration in Rojava and the PKK denied the allegation and said that militants did not enter Turkey from Syria.\n\nFollowing Fidan’s allegations and a fierce declaration of war, Turkish drones conducted multiple strikes in northeast Syria, and one of the unmanned aircraft reportedly operated by Turkey’s intelligence (MIT) was shot down by US forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish government is increasing its crackdown on dissidents, including prominent journalists and politicians, allegedly for conducting “terrorist propaganda” and having “terror links.”\n\nAs SPOT, we demand an end to these attacks on Syria and call for solidarity with the Kurdish people.\n\nMerdan Yanardag arrested in latest attack on opposition media\n\nThe arrest of TELE 1 editor-in-chief Merdan Yanardag is the latest intimidation operation by the Turkish government against the opposition press.\n\nIn a televised speech over the weekend, Yanardag said: “[PKK leader Abdullah] Öcalan is the longest-serving political prisoner in Türkiye. If normal execution laws were applicable, he should actually be released… The isolation imposed on Öcalan has no legal basis.”\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s administration and the Directorate of Communications, RTÜK – which is under Erdogan’s thumb – took swift action and claimed that Yanardag’s comments praised terrorism and crime.\n\nFor a long time in Turkey, criticism of the government’s politics has been criminalised, and lawyers and journalists who report and comment on it are treated as criminals.\n\nThe government aims to punish, silence and intimidate Merdan Yanardag as well as all opposition media platforms by criminalising dissent and eradicating voices that do not align with its views.\n\nWe must not allow Erdogan and the AKP government to normalise such acts and eradicate the democratic rights of the people of Turkey.\n\nAs SPOT, we call on trade unions, including the National Union of Journalists, and labour organisations to stand with the people of Turkey by opposing the one-man regime’s actions through their international relations.\n\nPhoto: still taken from Tele 1 broadcast\n\nTurkey: Before and after the elections\n\nThis panel is organised by SPOT and Day-Mer and is a part of the 34th Day-Mer Culture and Arts Festival.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nLabour MP Kate Osamor\n\nBir-TEK Sen general secretary Mehmet Turkmen\n\nEMEP MP Iskender Bayhan\n\nUnison international officer Mark Beacon\n\nDay-Mer MCM Ceren Sagir\n\nTo register your interest, visit: eventbrite\n\nInternational observers visit the trial of trade unionists in Ankara\n\nOn Monday 5th June a delegation of ten international observers, four from UK trade unions, attended the hearing of eight trade unionists in Ankara, Turkey. This is the sixth trial and details of the allegations and people charges are below.\n\nOne of the defendants Gonul Erden joined remotely as she is still being held under house arrest and Selma Atabey who has been imprisoned since July 2022 was brought to the courthouse from prison.\n\nThe defendants all had an opportunity to speak and their legal team also addressed the court.\n\nThe key issue being raised was that evidence against the group has come from an anonymous witness who was not in court to be cross examined and whose claims are completely unsubstantiated. In fact, the legal team had produced evidence that showed the allegations could not be substantiated but this seemed to be ignored. The anonymous witness has apparently made similar witness statements about 80 other people.\n\nThere was also an issue about books that were found in their homes, yet these same books were freely available to buy in local stores.\n\nThe key requests from the legal team were for Selma to be released from prison, Gonul’s house arrest to be lifted and administrative control orders to be removed.\n\nAt the end of the hearing there was a ten-minute adjournment. When we returned it was announced that Selma was to be released but in to house detention. All other restrictions would remain in place for all the trade unionists.\n\nFollowing the case, we returned to the KESK offices for a press briefing.\n\nThis started with a briefing from the lawyers and was then followed by solidarity messages from various organisations. We then had the privilege of meeting Selma when she was released from jail.\n\nThe next hearing will be in October 2023 and all impositions on the defendants will stay in place until then.\n\nIt was deeply concerning to witness a complete lack of justice where an anonymous witness statement can lead to people facing imprisonment, house arrest and other restrictive measures even where evidence is clearly presented to show the lack of truth and inconsistencies.\n\nIn the lawyers summing up of the case they stated that ‘“the judiciary is used as an instrument to suppress trade unions.” This certainly seemed to be the case from our observations.\n\nDetails of the case:\n\nOn 25 May 2021, anti-terror unit police raided SES leaders’ houses and arrested them. They were taken to the anti-terror unit of the security department in Ankara.\n\nAfter 4 days, they were referred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Ankara. The public prosecutor accuses the SES executives of membership (Turkish Penal Code Article 314) and leadership of an armed illegal organisation (Turkish Penal Code Article 220). Not surprisingly, there is no concrete evidence about these accusations.\n\nThe following colleagues face leadership accusation:\n\n1) Ms Selma Atabey, co-president 2) Ms Gonul Erden, former co-president, 3) Ms Bedriye Yorgun, former president, 4) Mr Fikret Calagan, former executive committee member, 5) Ms Belkis Yurtsever, former executive committee member,\n\nThe following colleagues face membership accusation; 1) Ms Rona Temelli, former executive of the SES Branch in Ankara, 2) Mr Ramazan Tas, former executive of the SES Branch in Ankara, 3) Mr Erdal Turan, former executive of the SES Branch in Ankara\n\nThe public prosecutor asked the judge to declare confidentiality on the file. The judge immediately approved the prosecutor’s demand. The legal team had no access to the details about the file until the court approved the indictment.\n\nThe judge who examined imposed a travel ban on all colleagues. In addition to the travel ban, the first 5 colleagues (the group that faces the leadership accusation) have to go to the police station once a week. Unfortunately, the public prosecutor appealed the release of 8 colleagues. As a result of the appeal, Ms Gonul Erden who is the former co-president of SES was arrested by police officers on 22 September. She has been in prison since 22nd September 2021. Gonul Erden was released on 13 March 2023.\n\nSelma Atabey, the successor of Gönül, was arrested on 3 July 2022 and has been in prison since.\n\nErdogan turned illegitimate elections in his favour!\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has been managing Turkey like his own family business for 21 years, will remain in power for another five years after the recent elections.\n\nErdogan, who received 49.5 per cent of the votes in the first round, secured 52 per in the run-off elections last month. Main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was close behind at 48 per cent.\n\nNo matter how one looks at it, Erdogan’s victory was based on a grossly unfair election.\n\nAll the means of the state, which are largely under Erdogan’s control, were used to strengthen and hold onto his position of power. Public resources were spent for Erdogan and his party, the AKP, to win. These include the use of funds and bodies such as councils, the police and even the army. All were forced to act as Erdogan’s representatives.\n\nIn addition, 90 per cent of the media, the Directorate of Communications, the government-owned Anadolu Agency (AA), and broadcaster TRT were mobilised for propaganda in favour of Erdogan. While this allowed his speeches to be aired over 30 channels simultaneously, the main opponent could only use one or two alternative channels, which regularly face threats from the government, and self-made YouTube videos from his kitchen to get his voice heard by the public.\n\nLying, plundering, slander, pressure, blackmail, and unimaginable games. These are the methods Erdogan and those who “served” with him used. They wanted to benefit from the subsidies of the power they held, and so they corrupted and used religion without hesitation.\n\nWhen Erdogan fell behind in the polls ahead of the elections, he and his agents circulated fake and manipulated videos showing his opponents working with so-called “terrorists.”\n\nAt many ballot stations, there were reported attempts of people to vote under false identities or even more than once. Most of those caught red-handed were members and supporters of Erdogan’s AKP party or his fascist allies, the MHP.\n\nBallot officials, including presiding officers, were attacked, and witnesses and officials from all opposition parties were threatened and even beaten. Many of the main opposition party officials from the CHP party had to leave the ballot boxes and counts due to threats made to their lives. International observers and other independent bodies responsible for monitoring elections were restricted to the main cities.\n\nIt is no surprise that a system which enriches a handful of pro-capitalists and Erdogan’s family with the taxes of the people, and that only considers those who pledge allegiance to this government as citizens, does not refrain from stealing votes.\n\nAnd despite the constitutional laws that require ministers to resign during an election, all ministers refused to step down and continued to work for Erdogan.\n\nErdogan also pumped out vile propaganda against LGBT+ people in an effort to split the opposition. Regrettably, the main opposition went along with, and even went further than, Erdogan’s assaults against refugees. This weakened the movement against Erdogan.\n\nIt is important to note that throughout this, Western countries that raise their voices against Erdogan only do so for their own interest.\n\nWhile refusing Nato membership for Sweden and Finland, Erdogan has maintained a good relationship with Vladimir Putin and Russia. At the same, by working with the EU to stop migrants from crossing over to European countries, he has kept the EU and other Western countries quiet on all of the injustices that took place.\n\nFollowing the results, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared that he was eager to work with Erdogan. The UK government is happy to work with such authoritarian leaders as long as it suits them. But this is not representative of the people of the UK which has seen the highest number of Turkish citizens voting against him in the elections.\n\nThe past 21 years of Erdogan’s rule have seen thousands of young and skilled people leave Turkey to emigrate to many European countries, including the UK. The way this election has been won and threats made by Erdogan during his acceptance speech have led many people in the opposition, young people, women, and LGBT+ members in particular, to fear for their lives.\n\nFollowing this, it has been reported the most Googled term in Turkey was “how do I go abroad.”\n\nAt SPOT, we want to appeal to the entire UK public. Erdogan will continue to increase his oppression and cruelty. We call on the UK public, political parties, trade unions, campaign groups, charities and all organisations to show greater solidarity with all those who will fight for democracy.\n\nphoto: CHP\n\nJihadist “Political Party” Supports President Erdogan\n\nHuda-Par (Free Cause Party), a radical jihadist “political party” in Turkey, has announced its support for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his People’s Alliance (the religious and nationalist alliance) in the upcoming May 14 elections.\n\nHuda-Par has roots in the outlawed Kurdish-Hezbollah which is responsible for the horrific executions in southeast Turkey during the 1990s. At the time, they were called “Hezbocontras” and allegedly were being trained in the Diyarbakir headquarters of the Turkish police force.\n\nTheir victims, including journalists and leading Kurdish political figures, were found in a network of torture chambers.\n\nA Month After the Earthquake: Humanitarian Situation Worsens\n\nMillions of people are living in tents and informal settlements across earthquake-hit areas in Turkey. It has recently emerged that the Turkish Red Crescent sold tents to the earthquake victims after the quake. As a result, there are thousands of people who could not find any shelter, even a tent, in freezing weather conditions.\n\nAmong them are hundreds of unaccompanied children rescued from collapsed buildings whose parents are dead or missing. Radical Islamist networks are exploiting these children with the help of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s regime at a time when they most need support and protection. Erdogan’s government is also trying to break the solidarity efforts of the progressive organisations and block volunteers’ access to the region as they have been providing shelter and aid to the victims.\n\nHeavy rainfall and storms on 15 March resulted in flooding in Adiyaman and Sanliurfa, which were already devastated by the tremors, aggravating the situation for vulnerable people living in the region.\n\nAlmost 50 days after the catastrophe, people are still desperately looking for their loved ones whether alive or dead and it is believed that there are still tens of thousands of corpses under the rubble.\n\nPhoto ©European Union, 2023 (Begum Iman)\n\nCorruption and misrule made Turkey’s earthquake deadlier\n\nVideos of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, taken during a campaign stop of Turkey’s March 2019 local elections, have resurfaced showing him boasting about the amnesty programme in the earthquake epicentre that allowed contractors to ignore the safety codes and forgave faults in millions of buildings across Turkey.\n\nWhile campaigning ahead of local elections in 2019, Recep Tayyip Erdogan told rallies in the southern provinces that legislation passed by his party had allowed buildings with construction violations to be certified without developers bringing them up to code.\n\nErdogan’s government approved 7.4mn applications within a year and a half, providing legal status to buildings that had breached a broad set of basic licensing, design and safety rules. The scheme raised TL 24bn, at the time about $4.2bn, in building registration fees, according to the environment ministry.\n\nThe Turkish government has been criticized for failing to enforce building regulations, fuelling corruption, and misspending special taxes levied after the last big quake in 1999 in order to make buildings more resistant.\n\nBirtek-Sen calls on workers for international solidarity\n\nWe, United Textile Workers Union (BIRTEK-SEN), with our members, executives and numbers of volunteers have been mobilized, day and night, to relieve the injuries caused by the earthquake chiefly in central Gaziantep and its districts as well as other affected cities such as Maras, Adiyaman and Malatya.\n\nIn collaboration with Nar Art Society, we set up a coordination and relief distribution centre in Gaziantep. And we have relief distribution teams in other cities. We deliver life-sustaining materials to thousands of people such as food, clothes, blankets, tents, heaters, and personal hygiene items, especially for women and children in these areas.\n\nThe catastrophic earthquake has already inflicted deep wounds in millions of lives. It will take a very long time for these wounds to be attended, for such a major grievance to disappear.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of workers living in this region hit by the quake, majority of whom are working in the textile industry. They work for poor wages, under irregular, insecure and extremely heavy working conditions, living in poverty, so they are one of the social sectors most affected by the destruction of the quake. This includes migrant/refugee workers and their families as well, who have been exposed to racist, xenophobic and discriminative practices. Despite all these violations they face, migrant/refugee workers quickly became a part of local solidarity networks we set up in the field.\n\nBIRTEK-SEN puts in special effort to reach out to workers and their families. Bosses in the region, specifically in the Organised Industrial Zone in Gaziantep dared to call workers whose houses were hit by the quake, who lost many members in their families back to production on the sixth day. And in the middle of such pain workers feel that they are obliged to work in order to survive. Our union tries hard to organize workers around the collective demands for an additional paid leave for another week, one-month-pay quake relief, housing benefit for 6 months, a ban on termination of labour contracts at least for 6 months, and an increase in wages at 70 per cent.\n\nAll the work we have achieved so far we could manage thanks to our members, organisations and people that are our friends.\n\nWe call on all workers in Turkey and other countries, all the unions and democratic organisations, all of our friends for sustaining and strengthening solidarity.\n\nLong live international solidarity among working people!\n\nBIRTEK-SEN\n\nUnited Textile Weaving and Leather Workers Union\n\n📞+90 554 771 82 27\n\nTwitter : @birlesiktekstil\n\nWeb : birteksen.org\n\n📧 birlesiktekstilsendikasi@gmail.com\n\nDonations can be made to Birtek-Sen at:\n\nBİRLEŞİK TEKSTİL DOKUMA VE DERİ İŞÇİLERİ SENDİKASI\n\nZiraat bankası\n\nIBAN: TR 8100 0100 1156 9761 6266 5003\n\nSwift Kod : ZKBATRIS\n\nTurkey Earthquake: A preliminary report from the ground\n\nThe Chamber of Mining Engineers of Turkey has participated in the search and rescue operations in the earthquake zone and published the “Preliminary Investigation Report for the Earthquakes of February 6, 2023” on February 11, 2023.\n\nThe report from the ground points out that the poor disaster response of the government and organisational structure of the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) magnified the death toll and scale of destruction and the region is facing severe challenges in the aftermath of the tremors.\n\nThe report says: “The first 36 hours, which are extremely important in search and rescue efforts, were lost, and rescue efforts only began in the earthquake zones, especially in the districts, from the afternoon of the second day.”\n\nEngineers specify that “AFAD’s method of reaching the person by drilling a hole from the top of the wreckage” caused additional loss of life and the Disaster Authority also intervened with the miners’ rescue methods in the debris. As a result, the miners were not able to save more people. It was underlined that AFAD also prevented the participation of civil society’s post-disaster assistance efforts. The report indicates that tents and toilets availability is currently the biggest problem in the region.\n\nThe death toll of the earthquake which hit Turkey and Syria on Monday has now surpassed 33,000 people.\n\nTurkey Earthquake: “The main reason for this catastrophe is Erdogan”\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), yesterday said in a statement: “I saw the state of our people with my own eyes. I refuse to accept that this situation is above contemporary politics and I refuse to align with the government (discourse).”\n\nKilicdaroglu stressed that this catastrophe is exactly the result of the systematic corruption and greedy policies of the ruling political power and President Erdogan personally.\n\n“I will not align with Erdogan or his palace (politics) or the gangs of profiteers on any ground. I will fight for my people’s struggle. Up until the end,” he said.\n\nThe main opposition leader also called for acts of civil disobedience against Erdogan’s State of Emergency ruling. He added that the detention of journalists and blocking of aid activities by the opposition councils cannot be accepted and urged for solidarity: “Either arrest us all or release the young people and journalists you have arrested. We have a lot of work to do. (…) We will remove this debris.”\n\nTurkey Earthquake: Access ban on social media\n\nTurkey’s government officials have waged a war on the media.\n\nFahrettin Altun, Turkey’s Presidential Communications Director, yesterday proudly announced that a smartphone application called “Disinformation Reporting Service” is available to report people who are sharing “fake news” or “disinformation” online. The Directory also banned “nonaccredited” journalists’ access to the disaster area.\n\nTwitter – which has become a vital public communication application for rescue activities in the region – has also been restricted. Prof. Dr Yaman Akdeniz from the Freedom of Expression Association said the restriction was made by narrowing the bandwidth. Netblocks, a non-governmental organisation which follows global internet access, also confirmed the ban saying: “Confirmed: Real-time network data shows Twitter has been restricted in #Turkey; the filtering is applied on major internet providers and comes as the public comes to rely on the service in the aftermath of a series of deadly earthquakes.”\n\nTurkey’s Information and Communication Technologies Authority did not comment on the issue.\n\nCountries close their consulates in Turkey due to terror threats\n\nIt is known that terrorist incidents are frequently seen at the beginning of every election period in Turkey. In previous elections, the Erdoğan government received the electorate’s support through such events.\n\nThis week, the Consulate of Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland in Istanbul were closed due to a new terrorist threat.\n\nTurkish elections to be held on May 14\n\nTurkey’s general elections, which were supposed to be held on 18 June, will be held on 14 May. According to the election law, a person can only be president for a maximum of two terms. But President Erdoğan is looking for ways to take on the role for the third time by using a constitutional amendment made in 2018.\n\nThe following three alliances will participate in this election:\n\n1. The People’s Alliance (Turkish: Cumhur İttifakı) – the racist and fascist coalition led by Erdoğan;\n\n2. The Nation Alliance (Turkish: Millet İttifakı) – made up of 6 opposition parties led by the CHP;\n\n3. The Labour and Freedom Alliance (Turkish: Emek ve Özgürlük İttifakı), a coalition of six left-wing parties, with the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP).\n\nWhile some claim that Erdoğan has no chance of winning this election, the opposition has warned that he will try using many pressures and tricks, including declaring war on Syria.\n\nTurkey launches deadly attack on Kurds\n\nTurkey has launched deadly airstrikes on the Kurds in Kobani, and various areas of North Eastern Syria.\n\nThese latest aerial attacks on Kobani and various other places in North East Syria are yet further examples that radical Islamists and their ideology are favoured and supported by Erdogan regime.\n\nThe Kurdish groups in the region previously defeated the jihadists who were responsible for multiple crimes against humanity in Syria and Iraq. Despite this, Erdogan’s regime in Turkey has been targeting the Kurds and has falsely pointed the finger at the Kurds following last weeks terror attack in Istanbul, Taksim. Contrary to the statements of Minister of Interior Süleyman Soylu, the findings related to the terrorist attack in Taksim point to Turkey-backed jihadist groups in Syria. Yet Turkey is using this as an excuse to attack Rojava. The ministry of defence of Turkey announced the war by saying that “now is the time for revenge.”\n\nThe HDP also made a call to the Turkish Government, saying that “the Kurds are not a threat to Turkey. It is ISIS and associated groups that are getting rich by occupying the areas in which the Kurds live.”\n\nIt is long known that the Islamist-nationalist regime in Turkey wants to attack the Syrian Kurds before the elections in order to stop its loss of power by provoking nationalism. The jihadists in Syria were also looking forward to such a battle in the search for new areas of domination.\n\nSPOT urges the UK Government to take immediate steps to stop these deadly attacks against the Kurds.\n\nWe are also calling the international community to stand up for Kobani and against Erdogan’s regime.\n\nSPOT Conference: Life & Resistance Under Erdogan’s Turkey\n\nStarting as Prime Minister and cementing his premiership through rigged elections, referendums and an executive presidency, Tayyip Erdogan has managed to demolish the fundamental apparatus required for the rule of law and democracy since 2002. He is responsible for Turkey’s economic, cultural, political and ecological demise.\n\nAt its 4th conference, SPOT invites you to join us to discuss what life and resistance under such a turbulent dictatorship looks like, and what difference internationally solidarity makes to democratic forces fighting back.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nErcument Akdeniz, Leader of the Labour Party of Turkey\n\nLindsey German, Convener of the Stop the War Coalition\n\nBaroness Christine Blower\n\nElif Gorgu, Journalist, Evrensel\n\nJeremy Corbyn MP\n\nIlke Isik, Lawyer for the Ankara Bombing\n\nErtugrul Kurkcu, HDP\n\nSeyit Aslan, Disk\n\nUnison International\n\nBook your place here\n\nPrisoners denied fundamental rights and access to a fair trial\n\nMakbule Ozer, an 80 year-old mother is in prison in Turkey on so-called charges of “aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation”. She has been denied an application for release made by her lawyers on grounds of her serious illness and deteriorating health. Ozer’s case was not reviewed at Forensic Medicine Institute (ATK) on the grounds of no Kurdish language translator being avaliable. Her family are fighting for her release and are concerned for her welfare behind bars, where she is denied the care she needs.\n\nOzer’s case is the latest example of increasing rights violations in Turkish prisons where the release of political prisoners are deliberately suspended. Some human rights advocates say that these are indeed “de-facto death sentences” on Kurdish political prisoners especially. They say that the numbers of prisoners who either die in the prisons or are released shortly before they die is growing in recent years.\n\nThe advertisement bans on Evrensel must end!\n\nEvrensel Daily, a Turkish daily workers’ newspaper which has been subjected to considerable harassment from the establishment since it first went to print in 1995, recently received Press Advertising Agency (BIK) decision revoking its right to receive public ads. BIK is the authority in Turkey responsible for the distribution of state advertising and which is under the tight control of the Islamist AKP government.\n\nThe suppression of Evrensel is part of the ongoing crackdown on independent media outlets that are not pro government and is meant to forbid publications writing stories about workers’ rights.\n\nThe right of Evrensel to receive public advertisements has been suspended since September 2019 and the recent move which was prompted by alleged bulk buying that distorted Evrensel’s distribution figures against which the advertising levels are set. With the latest decision, this suspended right was completely cancelled.\n\n“This newspaper will not bow down to those who are paid to silence it. Never!” says Fatih Polat, Editor-in-Chief of Evrensel about the cancellation of the newspapers right to publish official advertisements by BIK.\n\nThe International Press Institute (IPI) and 17 press freedom, freedom of expression and human rights organisations call upon the BIK to withdraw the decision to revoke ad revenues for Evrensel.\n\nSignatories of the call say that: “Media freedom in recent years has been deteriorating in Turkey in light of the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in 2023. We are concerned about the state of remaining independent media outlets, the repercussions it will have on the right to access information for the residents of Turkey who will need to rely on the existing media outlets to make informed decisions in the election calendar, and how this will contribute to an already-shrinking civic space in the country. Hereby we once again call upon the Press Advertising Agency (BİK) in Turkey to withdraw the decision to revoke ad revenues for Evrensel.”\n\nReaders of the newspaper are also sharing solidarity messages under the #EvrenselSusturulamaz hashtag across the globe and we as SPOT are calling for the advertising bans on Evrensel which threaten the survival of the newspaper and the journalism in Turkey to be lifted with immediate effect.\n\nTurkish Pop Star’s arrest over joke on religious schools sparks outrage\n\nA Turkish pop star, Gulsen was jailed on Thursday in relation to a joke she made on stage about religious schools in Turkey. She was jailed for commenting about one of her musicians, in particular saying that he is a pervert since he graduated from a “imam hatip” school (a type of islamic religious school).\n\nThe mentioned schools recently came into focus due to allegations of their graduates being involved in the sexual abuse of children.\n\nDissidents on social media spoke out in support of Gulsen and say that the video of the singer’s comment was deliberately circulated by “trolls of AKP” on social media and she was already being targeted for her stance about secularism and women’s rights.\n\nOmer Celik, the Justise Minister of the Islamist AKP Government argued that this is “a hate crime and a disgrace to humanity” and also said that “there is no doubt of judicial independence in Turkey” .\n\nThe arrest sparked an outrage among the public calling for Gulsen’s immediate release.\n\nTurkish Finance Minister “Sticks Two Fingers Up” to the Public Over Inflation\n\nNureddin Nebati, Minister of Treasury and Finance, said in a live broadcast that while chatting with a foreign country’s minister about the rocketing inflation in Turkey, he told him that “I can go out and mingle with the public even with this high inflation rate while you cannot do it with 10%”.\n\nNebati’s remarks have become a political issue in itself and immediately led to a public outcry all over social media.\n\nTurkey’s unofficial consumer inflation rate rose by 176% in July compared with a year earlier according to ENAG, a credible independent research group. TUIK (official statistics agency) put the figure at 79.6%.\n\nSect leader’s funeral reveals close links government officials\n\nAccording to various Turkish outlets hundreds of thousands of men have attended a so-called cleric’s funeral in Turkey on 24 June.\n\nMahmut Ustaosmanoglu, a notorious Islamic sect leader was mostly known for his hostility towards women. He wouldn’t want women in his funeral and his sect said “please obey his wishes” in a press release.\n\nTaliban sent a condolence message for Ustaosmanoglu saying that “Afghanistan considers the death of this great scholar an irreparable loss.”\n\nAlmost every high ranking Turkish government official and some opposition figures attended the funeral of the bigot who argued publicly that girls should not go to school. President Erdogan also attended the funeral and said that Ustaosmanoglu was “one of the spiritual guides of Turkey” and “had devoted his life to Islam.”\n\nMahmut Ustaosmanoglu who died at age of 93 had an imperious power on Turkish politics.\n\nFemicide in Turkey: Another Family is Fighting for Justice\n\nPinar Gultekin (27), was brutally killed by Cemal Metin Avci on July 21, 2020. The charge filed for the murderer Cemal Metin Avci was “killing with monstrous feeling or by tormenting”. There were also other collaborators charged with “destroying, hiding or tampering with criminal evidence” in the case, namely murderer’s brother Mertcan Avci, his mother Ayten Avci, his father Selim Avci, his ex-wife Eda Karagun and his friend Sukru Gokhan Orhan.\n\nA Turkish court in Mugla reduced an aggravated life sentence jail term to 23 years in prison for Cemal Metin Avci on the basis of “unjust provocation”. The Court also acquitted the collaborators in the final hearing.\n\nIt has been proved by forensics that murderer Cemal Avci put Pinar Gultekin’s body in a barrel while she is unconcious and set fire to her while she was still alive and then filled the barrel with concrete.\n\n“This murderer will be released from prison after 14 years and 4 months if the decision is finalised at the appeal” says Rezan Epozdemir, the solicitor of the Gultekin Family.\n\nHuman rights organisations and feminist activists including “We Will Stop Femicide Platform” (KCDP) and “The Federation of Women Associations of Turkey” (TKDF) have protested the court’s decision.\n\nMassive Crackdown on Kurdish Journalists\n\nIn Diyarbakir, a Kurdish-majority south-eastern province of Turkey, 20 journalists who were working in various media outlets such as Dicle Firat Journalists Association (DFG), Mesopotamia News Agency and Jin News have been under arrest since 8 June. No official charges have been pressed.\n\nErol Onderoglu, the Turkey representative for Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said that “As the RSF, we are astonished at the extensity of an investigation based on ‘terrorist propaganda’ targeting of so many media workers. Evidence must be disclosed as soon as possible by the law.”\n\nGulnoza Said, Program Coordinator of Europe and Central Asia program of Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also commented on the crackdown on the Kurdish journalists and said that “Turkish authorities arbitrary detention of journalists (…) marks another dark day for the press in the country. Authorities should be ashamed of their raids on newsrooms and journalists’ homes. The journalists targeted for detention should be released immediately and without charge.”\n\nThe criminalisation of journalism is unacceptable. SPOT stands in solidarity with the journalists who are under attack in Turkey.\n\nErdogan calls protestors sluts\n\nPresident Erdogan once again used cheap words to insult the dissidents in Turkey. On the 9th anniversary of the Gezi protests, the fiercest anti-government unrest in Turkey for years, he branded the protestors as “sluts”, “terrorists” and “rotten”.\n\nErdogan, who is known as the “most insulted” head of state, did not hesitate when using offensive terms to refer to the gezi protestors. Ironically, thousands of citizens are subject to lawsuits for insulting the president.\n\nThe President also repeated his allegation -which yet needs to be proven true- about people drinking beer at a nearby mosque during the unrest.\n\n“These terrorists and bandits had contaminated the inside of the mosque with beer bottles. These are rotten, these are sluts” Erdogan said in his speech at the parliament.\n\nErdogan’s comments sparked a public outcry. #sürtük (slut in Turkish) hashtag has become a trending topic with fiercely comments on Erdogan.\n\nKurdish Culture Banned\n\nKurdish musicians and actors are being banned from performing in Turkey.\n\nProminent Kurdish singer and composer Aynur Dogan – who recently performed at the Barbican as part of the London Jazz Festival- was one of the banned artists. An Islamist-Nationalist municipality in Kocaeli cancelled Dogan’s concert without specifying any reason.\n\nSoon after leading Kurdish duo Metin and Kemal Kahraman’s concert was also cancelled by the order of the Mus Governor for being “inappropriate”.\n\nAnother Kurdish band Sterka Karwan’s concert which was part of the youth spring festival in Bitlis State University was also banned.\n\nAmed City Theater’s Kurdish “Don Quixote” play was also banned by another municipality in Kocaeli held by Islamist AKP.\n\nImposed bans mark the ideological Turkish state policy on Kurdish culture and underlines the repressive character of the AKP regime.\n\nSPOT stands in solidarity with the Kurdish people and artists in Turkey.\n\nCrossroads for Opposition in Turkey\n\nCanan Kaftancioglu, a leftwing leading Turkish politician who challenged the ruling Islamist AKP’s power during 2019’s mayoral campaign has been banned from politics.\n\nKaftancioglu has been sentenced to 4 years 11 months in prison for insulting “the President of Turkey” via her tweets in 2013 and 2014.\n\nKaftancioglu was expecting this sentence for sometime since she is a key figure in the Republican People’s Party (CHP) as a chair. She said that it is time to raise the hope (political promise) which can be achieved through organising and this sentence will act as another challenge for Erdogan and his circles.\n\nThis political ban for Kaftancioglu is no doubt a reprisal for the regime which lost the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) to the opposition.\n\nJudicial crackdown on political opponents will make Erdogan’s job easier in the coming presidential elections.\n\nIn response CHP has called for an urgent executive board assembly to decide the political roadmap. Analists and leading progressive figures argue that opposition is at a historical crossroad.\n\nStatement of Solidarity with Imprisoned Gezi 8\n\nSignatories of a petition released today in Turkey sent a message of solidarity with the Gezi 8.\n\n“Whatever they said or did during the Gezi movement, we did the same, we said the same words. If they are convicted, we must be convicted too. If they are considered guilty, we are guilty too. We are reporting ourselves to the prosecutor’s office by declaring that we are in agreement with their ideas and actions” said the 888 signatories of the petition.\n\nYou can access to the list of the signatories making the call for solidarity with the Gezi 8 though the link:\n\nhttps://m.bianet.org/english/human-rights/261608-in-protest-of-8-convictions-in-gezi-trial-888-people-file-report-themselves-to-prosecutors\n\nPROTEST – Free the Gezi 8!\n\nSaturday 7 May 2022 at 11am / Turkish Embassy, London\n\nJoin the protest against Turkey’s criminalisation of Gezi and help strengthen the call for the Gezi 8 to be released.\n\nOn 25 April, a Turkish court sentenced Osman Kavala to life imprisonment for allegations of “attempting to overthrow the government by force” during the 2013 Gezi Park protests.\n\nA further 7 activists were also given 18-year sentences and were immediately imprisoned. Those imprisoned are Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Hakan Altınay, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Yiğit Ali Ekmekçi and Tayfun Kahraman.\n\nThe criminalisation of the Gezi resistance is unacceptable. The right to protest and provide democratic opposition must be defended.\n\nAll those imprisoned in connection with Gezi, those imprisoned for exercising their right to free speech and for defending democracy must be freed immediately.\n\nPegasus Sacks Workers for a Drinking Post\n\nPegasus Airlines – a privately owned economy airline in Turkey – sacked their workers due to a shared photo of a social gathering.\n\nWorkers from the airline shared a photo on social media showing them drinking alcoholic beverages with a note saying “may God accept” and a tag related to a holy Islamic day.\n\nThe Nakliyat-Is Union, which the dismissed flight workers are organised under, said “According to the current labour law, this cannot be grounds for dismissal for any workers.”\n\nPegasus Airlines argued that this kind of a post is “an insult to religious belief” and said that the company finds its sharing unacceptable.\n\nA Public prosecutor in Istanbul also found the post unacceptable and took legal action against the workers on the grounds that they had committed a crime of “inciting the people to hatred and hostility or humiliating them” via the tagged photo.\n\nUnder the ruling of the Islamist-nationalist coalition many religious duties are gradually becoming imposed as a way of ordinary life in Turkey. In most cases people who do not adhere to the strict rules become subject to social harassment and some are being prosecuted. The most visible of these incidents are the ones related to alcohol consumption and womens rights.\n\nSPOT Supports The Gezi Resistance\n\nA Turkish court in Istanbul has sentenced Osman Kavala to aggravated life imprisonment on the account of allegedly “attempting to overthrow the government” in 2013. The court also sentenced seven activists to 18 years imprisonment with an order for their immediate detention for “aiding the attempt. ”\n\nThe trial, widely referred to as the Gezi trial, accused Kavala and a wider group of activists, journalists and individuals of organising the Gezi protests with the aim of overthrowing the government. The Gezi Park protests started in 2013,"
