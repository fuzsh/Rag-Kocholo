        "text": "It's no surprise that HBO's recent hit adaptation of the video game, The Last of Us, drew in 4.7 million viewers for its series premiere. The post-apocalyptic setting of the show triggers our primal fears; yet, the humanity shown by its characters gives us grounding and hope to persevere no matter the outcome of looming threats. While haunting post-apocalyptic themes—whether it’s nuclear fallout or zombies ravaging the human world —are having boom times on TV and movies, they have long enthralled readers.\n\nFrom the genre’s origins with Mary Shelley's The Last Man, to its surge during the Cold War's threat of annihilation, to the current wave of cli-fi, the post-apocalyptic genre continues to evolve. We've put together a curated selection of post-apocalyptic books that will engage the mind, challenge and captivate the imagination, and perhaps leave you pondering what truly matters when all else falls away.\n\n1. The Road by Cormac McCarthy\n\nAs a post-apocalyptic book that has reached icon status, The Road is the perfect title to kick off this list. In a desolate and burned America, a father and his son journey to the coast, armed with only a pistol, the clothes on their backs and a cart of scavenged food. The Road is a harrowing story that explores the dichotomy of human nature, examining the depths of destruction, desperation and the tenderness that can still exist amid utter devastation. McCarthy is a master of beautiful prose in the most bleak realities of this national bestseller and winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Like other McCarthy books All the Pretty Horses and No Country for Old Men, this novel that has been turned into a hit film. But we highly recommend reading the book first.\n\n2. Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel\n\nIn a recent conversation with The New York Times, author Emily St. John Mandel mentioned how the COVID-19 pandemic inspired a jump in sales as her readers found a kind of catharsis in the idea that “there is life afterward, and there’s joy afterward, and a lot of things that are worth living for in the aftermath.” See if the novel strikes the same chord as you follow Kirsten Raymonde from the night a catastrophic flu pandemic begins and leads to the civilizational collapse, to 20 years later when she’s traveling with The Traveling Symphony, a group dedicated to preserving art and humanity. Following the trend of post-apocalyptic books adapted for TV, a Station Eleven mini-series was recently launched on HBO Max.\n\n7. Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell\n\nRegularly quoted (Maybe “travel far enough, you meet yourself” sounds familiar?) and having attracted a huge cult following since it was published in 2004, Cloud Atlas is regularly acknowledged as one of the best post-apocalyptic books of all time. It was adapted into a film by the creators of The Matrix trilogy and features Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. This multifaceted novel interweaves six stories across time and space, ranging from 1850 to a post-apocalyptic future, revealing interconnected characters and themes as the narrative boomerangs back to its starting point and explores how souls drift across time like clouds across the sky. Often compared to Umberto Eco and Haruki Murakami, David Mitchell combines philosophy, mind-bending concepts and scientific speculation into one unforgettable novel."
