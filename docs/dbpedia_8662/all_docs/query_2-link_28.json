        "text": "Yes, it is SF because it's set in the future, much like Mad Max.\n\nNot really, I suppose. I guess there is hope for that one boy, but not for mankind as a whole.\n\nI didn't really think it was saying anything especially new. In desperate times, people become desperate and turn on each other, and it's a rare and good person who doesn't. This is true, but it's been said better and more enjoyably elsewhere.\n\nI thought it was rather over-rated. I loathed the lack of punctuation in dialogue (this is a pet hate of mine) and I disliked the writing style, which seemed pretentious, as if McCarthy was trying to imitate the prose of an old bible. Like a lot of SF by \"literary\" writers, it seemed to be doing much the same thing that \"genre\" writers had done before.\n\nI can understand both sides of the argument. Is it fiction? Yes, but there's not exactly much 'science' in there. Havng said that, a definition of 'science fiction' includes 'major social or environmental changes', so dystopias like 1984, The Road, Farenheit 451 etc. all qualify.\n\nThe movie version was well done, but it didn't feel as though it served any purpose. There was little entertainment, and by the end you felt a little like 'what was the point of that?' There are much better ways of telling a similar story - in movie version 'The Book of Eli' was similar, but much better done (imho).\n\nI have yet to read the Road, but a lot of his work is very similar, I believe.\n\nOuter Dark is quite apocalyptic in tone and a pretty depraved 'road novel' but set in Appalachia at the turn of the century (1900s not 2000s!). Child of God is another good one if you like him, it's got a nice horror with no supernatural elements story. I have The Road and Blood Meridian in my to read pile. Just to complete, I've also read Suttree, which is a lot lighter and moments of comedy.\n\nI do like his writing style - it's different - when you get into the flow of not using any punctuation, I find it 'morish'.\n\nI have yet to read the Road, but a lot of his work is very similar, I believe.\n\nOuter Dark is quite apocalyptic in tone and a pretty depraved 'road novel' but set in Appalachia at the turn of the century (1900s not 2000s!).

Chilling film if your a parent.\n\nafter that I never wanted to read the book.\n\nI haz questions.\n\nIs it Sci-Fi?\n\nYes. McCarthy is vague about the cause of the apocalypse, but it seems to stem from man-made disasters. I suspect McCarthy, old enough to remember the end of WWII, the bombing of Hiroshima and especially the long, traumatic Cold War that left an indelible mark on at least one generation, probably was drawing on those memories and extrapolating what the fall of civilization would look like.\n\nDoes the ending give anyone else hope?\n\nYes. Of a sort. Throughout the father is shown as timid. In trying to protect his son, he avoids other people, and tries to buffer his son from the world as it is. The son is actually less timid. It could have cost him his life with the cannibals, but their isolation eventually kills the father. At the end, the son looks to have been adopted in by someone less paranoid. Maybe he'll become a family's meal, but that isn't the tone of the man's approach to the boy. Still, McCarthy doesn't commit, so you have to draw your own conclusions.\n\nWhat in your opinion was the author trying to convey about people with all the dark themes?\n\nDid you like it? I did.\n\nI liked it -- it is beautifully written -- but it's not an easy read and not one I'd tackle again without much forethought.\n\nI'd call it sf, sure, but have no problem with someone wanting to uphold a more restrictive definition of sf than mine that would exclude this. But if I were still teaching, and were putting together a science fiction elective, I might well include this as an assigned text.\n\nIt's a while since I've read it, but my memory is that the father talks to the son about being a person of the fire, meaning some spiritual principle or inner presence. The sense I got was definitely not of a Christian outlook, but of a Gnostic one: there are fleshly people, not redeemable, and who belong in a dark world like this; but here and there, there are spiritual people who do not belong in this wretched material world in which they are \"caught.\" The task of the spiritual is to realize what they are and endure this dark world till they are reunited with the world of light from which their being derives. There's nothing in the book that spells all this out, and I don't mean I think McCarthy is a Gnostic plain and simple; but that, it seems to me, is the character of his imagination in this novel at least. If I'm right about this tendency, then the \"hope\" in the book is not that somewhere people will start civilization over again, etc., but that the boy has found other bearers of the light, his proper people, and whether they live for years yet or not is not really the point. They know they are creatures who do not eat people.\n\nThe sense I get is that the catastrophe of the \"shear\" effects an apocalypse in the literal sense of that word, i.e. a revealing, an unveiling, of the way things really are."
