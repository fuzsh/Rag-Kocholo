        "text": "Tylerankarlo’s Comments (group member since Nov 18, 2010)\n\nTylerankarlo’s comments from the The Road by Cormac McCarthy group.\n\nShowing 1-8 of 8\n\nDec 09, 2010 01:20PM\n\nThrough allusions and imagery to Christianity and the Bible in \"The Road\", Cormac McCarthy has written this novel as a Christian allegory. McCarthy makes this a Christian allegory through the post-apocalyptic world, when the clocks stop at 1:17, the Boy's innocence, and God like characteristics in the Boy.\n\nThe first allusion to the Bible comes from the post-apocalyptic world. This post-apocalyptic world that the Father and Boy are living in can be paralleled to the world described in the book Revelations. In Revelations there is catastrophe that hits the world when Jesus is returning. The world they live in is barren and had been destroyed by an apocalypse. In the Bible, the story of Christ's return is usually portrayed with fire everywhere. In \"The Road\" the world the story is set in is burnt and ash covered. This implies that McCarthy is paralleling the world in \"The Road\" to the world after the apocalypse in Revelation.\n\nThe second allusion to the Bible is when the clocks stops at 1:17. \"The clocks stopped at 1:17. A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions\"(52). This quote shows that the apocalypse is happening or about to happen. McCarthy purposely has the clocks stop at 1:17 because this is a Bible verse that is significant to the novel. The verse 1:17 can be interpreted from two different books of the Bible with two separate authors. The first interpretation comes from the book of James. \"all good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no alternation or shadow caused by change.\"(James 1:17). This Bible verse is explaining that everything God has given is perfect. For the novel it can be interpreted in two ways: the apocalypse is from God and good will come from it, or that this perfect gift is the Boy who has not yet been born, but will be soon after. The second interpretation of the clocks stopping at 1:17 is from Colossians. \"He is before all things, and in him all things hold together\" (Colossians 1:17). This verse has sense of hope to it. For \"The Road\", this is a foretelling of the Boy being the hope after the apocalypse. Although, he has not been born yet.\n\nThe third allusion to the Bible is the Boy's innocence. This comes from the book of Genesis and the Creation Story. The Boy's innocence is like that of Adam, before the serpent tempts Eve and she gives the forbidden fruit to him. Adam was given the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge from his wife Eve. Adam did not know what tree the fruit came from, he was innocent. He took the fruit because he trusted his wife and didn't have second thoughts of the consequences. The boy was born in a post-apocalyptic world which is a disaster and he did not know any better of what he was to expect or how he was supposed to understand anything from the past. Like Adam, the boy was naive and did not know any better of what to expect of this \"fruit\". The \"fruit\" to the Boy would be the post-apocalyptic world and its lack of anything.\n\nThomas Schaub of Marquette University agrees that McCarthy is alluding to Adam and Eve in the novel, but it is a consequence for corrupting Adam's innocent. \"In describing the beginning of their journey on the road, McCarthy gives his narrator a Miltonic cadence in ironic echo of Adam and Eve departing Paradise\" . \"Then they set out along the blacktop in the gunmetal light, shuffling through the ash, each the other's world.\"(McCarthy, 6).\n\nThe fourth allusion to the Bible is through God like characteristics in the Boy, which is shown from three quotes. Throughout the novel, McCarthy associates the Boy with either fire or light. In the Bible, the Holy Spirit often appears to people in a flame or bright light. For example, the Holy Spirit appears to Moses as a burning bush. The Boy says to his father, \"Because we're carrying the fire\" (83). This quote shows that nothing bad will happen because they are carrying the fire, which in this case is the Boy. \"Yes I am, he said. I am the one.\" This quote shows that the Boy has Christ like qualities because he knows that he is the one. In Revelations 1:17* Jesus says, \"...I am the First and the Last\" (Revelations 1:17). Here Jesus is saying that he is the One, like the Boy. Also, this ties back to the clock stopping at 1:17. This is another interpretation for why they stop on that time. \"There was a light all about him\" (277). This quote is discussing that the Boy was glowing when he brought his Father back a glass of water during his illness. This is like when Jesus is is resurrected and is glowing. Through the Boy, McCarthy is alluding to God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.\n\nRon Charles from the Washington Post says, \"...can't help but be read as a Christian allegory, especially when the boy is referred to as a tabernacle...\"\n\n\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy was written as a Christian allegory. The novel is a Christian allegory because of how McCarthy had alluded to the book of Revelations and other books in the Bible, as well as giving characters qualities that represent Christ or God. These allusions were achieved through the post-apocalyptic world, the Boy and clocks.\n\nAndrew Dansby has this to say about \"The Road\" in a review, \"Both the book and especially the film are full of religious imagery and themes.\"\n\nDec 03, 2010 10:41AM\n\n\"The clocks stopped at 1:17. A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions.\"page 52. Do you guys think that 1:17 has a specific significance? The only thing that I could think of was possibly a reference to a Bible verse. I found that James 1:17 says \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning\".\n\nWhat are your guys' thoughts on this?\n\nDec 03, 2010 10:24AM\n\nI see where you are coming from now Johanna. We were just looking at it in different aspects. Maybe it is a possibility we are both right, because we truthfully don't know what the answer is. It is arbitrary.\n\nDec 03, 2010 10:18AM\n\nI think that he does not acknowledge the afterlife because the Father has been through a lot of things in his life. I think that at one point he did believe in God and trust in Him, otherwise how would the son know about Him? I think that because of the new world they live in and how the father has been effected he does not believe in God.\n\nDec 03, 2010 10:11AM\n\nGoing off what Burns said, I also think that this \"thing\" is a god or a deity or something. But also Westra with a god comes hope. Therefore I think that it could be both a god and hope.\n\nDec 03, 2010 10:07AM\n\nInteresting point Johanna, I agree with you about the boy being some sort of deity in the book. He is so innocent and naive about his world now but he knows right from wrong and good from bad. What I take from it is that the son has been brought up by a good man with good ethics, his father. The father wants the very best for his son even though he knows that he will die. I also agree with you Burns about how the father's long time goal is to set something promising up for his son.\n\nNov 19, 2010 10:30AM\n\nI also agree with Burns that the lack of names is very appropriate for this book, it would just complicate things if everyone had names. Also, I think no names is what makes the book so suspenseful and a good read. At first it is confusing without the names, then you get to know what kind of things each character would say and it gets easier to interpret who is speaking.\n\nNov 19, 2010 10:28AM\n\nI think that the way the book was written is very unique. I realized that McCarthy doesn't use apostrophes in contractions and when there is a dialogue there are no quotations. Maybe this is a way that he gives the reader a feeling of the setting in the book, a vast nothingness lacking color and anything exciting."
