        "text": "John Davis\n\nAllison Rose\n\nHonors English III\n\n16 April 2018\n\nLiterary Analysis of The Road by Cormac McCarthy\n\nWithin the past few decades, humans have found increasing interest in imagining their survival following an apocalyptic event. One can find this fascination in a plethora of movies, television shows, and works of literature. Included in this phenomenon is Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road, in which the author depicts a charred wasteland that used to be the United States. Following an unnamed mass extinction event that renders the American landscape ashen and cold, two characters, the nameless man and his son, struggle to survive daily life while constantly on the move. Their ultimate destination is the East Coast, at which the man hopes to find warmer weather and a better life for his son. Along the journey, the man struggles to maintain his morality in a world in which some survivors have resorted to cannibalism and a clear view of ethics has disappeared. The man and his son depend on the prospect of a better future on the coast, which is evident in the repeating motifs of the road, light, and the boy’s messiah-like qualities. Cormac McCarthy’s usage of both ethical and optimistic themes and motifs within the post-apocalyptic world of The Road reflects the primal behavior of humans in a crumbled society.\n\nIn the novel, a large theme that illustrates humanity’s primitive instincts is its struggle for morality. To emphasize this idea, McCarthy repeatedly uses a motif that creates much of the novel’s conflict: cannibalism. Following an apocalyptic event, the most crucial materials are food and supplies necessary for daily survival. Survivors must abandon superfluous items that may overburden them. In some instances, this includes old-world morals. It becomes apparent that some survivors in the world of The Road have abandoned their morals in exchange for survival when McCarthy’s first introduces the reader to one of the many cannibal groups that travel the roads in search for potential prey. One night, the sound of a truck rouses the man from sleep on the side of a road. He looks over his shoulder to see hooded men clad in canister masks and biohazard suits marching in front of a diesel truck on the road. Immediately, the man recognizes them as a group of cannibals and flees into the woods with his son (McCarthy 60). With the majority of American homes and stores already stripped of food and supplies, some groups in The Road have reverted to life without ethical restrictions by consuming other humans (Lawrence). The moral implications associated with this concerns the value of human beings as a species. Civilized society views animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep as viable to consume. With cannibalism, the disconnect between human and animal becomes unclear (Cooper). Despite the constant struggle to locate food for himself and his son, the man never considers the practice an option due to his instincts to maintain the ethical organization with which he has been accustomed to. Without a doubt, McCarthy includes cannibalism as a recurring motif in order to contrast the man and boy’s preservation of their morality with the degradation of society.\n\nAn additional motif that emphasizes humanity’s moral conflict in The Road includes the man’s skewed definitions of right and wrong. His moral standings are shaped around his and his son’s survival at all costs. This becomes apparent when the two pass the blackened body of a man who has fallen victim to a lightning strike (McCarthy 49). The boy, whose morality has not been corrupted in the name of survival, pleads to his father to help the person. However, the father refuses because of their limited amount of food and supplies (McCarthy 50). In simple terms, he explains to the boy, “He’s going to die. We can’t share what we have or we’ll die too” (McCarthy 52). To the man, the act of benevolence to the lightning strike victim threatens the survival of him and his son, so kindness is not an option (Kane). In a similar situation, the man and boy are searching houses in a suburb for food when the boy spots a lone child hiding behind a house across the street (McCarthy 84). Naturally, the boy wants to find help for the child, which sparks an argument with his father: “We cant [sic]. / And I’d give that little boy half of my food. / Stop it. We cant [sic]. / He was crying again. What about the little boy? he sobbed. What about the little boy?” (McCarthy 86). In this situation, the man’s shifted ideas of right and wrong are prominent: to keep the food and supplies between the two is right, whereas to share with the abandoned child is wrong (Kane). Though behavior such as this can be considered wrong or cruel using today’s standards, the desolate world of The Road has forced the man to revert to his primal instincts of survival and preservation of his offspring. The man conceives these new versions of right and wrong to accommodate his and his son’s survival in a country reduced to anarchy.\n\nAn additional primitive theme that is evident in The Road is humanity’s tendency to hope for a better future in order to escape a bleak present. Furthermore, Cormac McCarthy uses the actual road that the man and boy travel on as a motif for the prospect of a better life on the coast (McDonald). Without this road, both literal and symbolic, the man’s efforts to reach the coast for his son would be futile and his life would be without meaning. Throughout the novel, the man creates a sense of urgency to the arrival at the coast. Whether it be due to the debilitating effects of the nuclear winter or the man’s recognition of his own failing health, his primal instinct to move can be likened to those of sharks, which need to be in constant motion to survive (Esposito). After all, why is it necessary to keep moving unless there is a destination to be reached? Offering an optimistic future in the midst of this catastrophe, the road facilitates the man and boy’s travels to the supposed sanctuary of the coast. For both main characters, the road is a motif that McCarthy uses in the novel as a passageway to a better location.\n\nCormac McCarthy includes light as an additional motif in The Road for the man and boy’s continuity of moral ways of life surrounded by a world of darkness. The author has constructed a barren landscape that is “stripped of meaning” in efforts to contrast the optimism of the two characters with the charred wasteland (Edwards). From early in the novel, the man instills in his son the concept that they are “carrying the fire.” One night, the boy cannot sleep because he is troubled by the uncertain future. He asks his father, “We’re going to be okay, arent [sic] we Papa? / Yes. We are. / And nothing bad is going to happen to us. / That’s right. / Because we’re carrying the fire. / Yes. Because we’re carrying the fire” (McCarthy 83). In this exchange, the man comforts his son by reassuring him that nothing can harm them as long as they keep their proverbial flame lit. This fire represents a desire to rekindle the flame of civilization and overcome the darkness of the apocalypse. However, McCarthy suggests with the inclusions of the lightning strike victim that light can still have devastating consequences. The lightning, which had struck the victim in the eye and crippled him, demonstrates that possessing excessive hope or optimism can be as deadly as having none at all (Collado-Rodríguez). In a literal sense, the mention of a passing of fire in The Road alludes to a Celtic tradition in which a grown child would pass the flame from their parent’s hearth to their new home. Both The Road and Celtic culture treat the idea of “carrying the fire” as a way to revere customs from the past and to live in remembrance of them (Cooper). The figurative light that the boy and his father carry into the future is the will to live with goodness.\n\nIn multiple sections of the novel, the boy acts as a messiah-like figure that is untainted by the horrors around him. His natural assumption that humans are deserving of goodness highlights the optimism of the youth. At the beginning of the novel, the man demonstrates that he believes his son is divine in goodness as he watches the boy as he sleeps: “He knew that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke” (McCarthy 4). McCarthy epitomizes the boy’s innocence in this way in order evoke a sense of divine aura that surrounds him (Wilhelm). In multiple encounters with other survivors that are less fortunate than he is—such as with the lightning strike victim and the lone child in the suburb—the boy attempts to aid them. This indicates that the boy’s outlook on life is significantly different from that of his father’s. To the boy, life in this post-apocalyptic world is more than a cycle of struggling to survive; it is also for charity and acts of goodness (Sanchez). When he asks his father what their long-term goals are, the man is taken aback (McCarthy 160). In this question, the boy thinks of their objectives for the distant future instead of daily survival (Sanchez). The question illustrates the boy’s ability to see past the atrocities along the road and focus on humanity’s survival. Additionally, McCarthy demonstrates the boy’s peculiar innocence in his hatred for breaking promises. When the boy notices that his father has broken their promise of sharing food when the man gives his son an entire packet of cocoa mix, he explains, “If you break little promises, you’ll break big ones. That’s what you said” (McCarthy 34). In a godless world reduced to ash and rubble, the boy believes that lying is impermissible because it allows for further wrongdoing in the future (Wielenberg). McCarthy’s portrayal of the boy as a messiah exemplifies the primitive tendency of young children to believe in the overall goodness of the world.\n\nIn The Road, Cormac McCarthy uses themes and motifs to explore a post-apocalyptic world stripped of its morals in which the survivors must resort to the most primitive human behaviors. Under the theme of a constant struggle for morality, McCarthy includes the recurring motifs of cannibalism and the father’s ambiguous beliefs of right and wrong as an analysis of the human psyche as a whole. In addition, the novel includes the theme of hope for a better future in order for the man and boy as well as humanity to continue life with meaning. This theme manifests itself in the actual road that leads the two characters to the coast, the figurative fire that the two carry, and the messiah-like qualities of the boy. It is with the ethical struggles and prospects of a better future that makes The Road a raw commentary on human nature and the behavior of humans without civilization.\n\nWorks Cited"
