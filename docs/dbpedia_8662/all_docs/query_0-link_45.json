        "text": "Throughout the novel “The Road by Cormac McCarthy, it displays the tale of survival, a world infested with murder, crime, and despair. However, the author conveys that although cruelty may arise in the world, love overcomes violence and that humanity has not been completely lost. Within the book, violence is shown in a great depth, thus because humans are thrown into a world filled with thievery, murder, and cannibalism as the result of a post-apocalyptic landscape. Despite the crimes that occur, altruism has been explored within the novel. Altruism is best described as the “willingness to do things that bring advantages to others, even if it results in disadvantage for yourself” (Dictionary Cambridge, 2017) Furthermore, two lessons that McCarthy conveys to his readers is that although one may help\n\nMccarthy creates a bleak post apocalyptic society through the use of imagery. He describes a world where there is no wildlife and all that’s left are the ashes. “The road was gullied eroded and barren. The bones of dead creatures sprawled in the washes. Middens of anonymous trash”(177). While the man and the boy travel the road, they rarely come across other living things. The boy even shows a lack of knowledge about animals, constantly asking his father questions about them. They always have to keep moving due to the constant threat of danger. Their nomadic lifestyle prevents them from becoming attached to anything. This gives the feeling of absolute isolation. Throughout the novel, the man often has dreams of life before. His dreams are described in vivid colors, \"walking in a flowering wood where birds flew before them he and the child and the\n\nHeros… We hear on the news all the time that, this person is a hero for doing xyz, or this person is a hero of doing a different xyz; Well one author decided to write about a hero, a made up hero. This hero isn’t superman, or batman, nor does this hear even have a hero sounding name, to some people they can’t imagine this person ever being a hero because they don’t know him. This hero is Papa from the novel The Road by Cormac McCarthy.\n\nIn The Road by Cormac McCarthy, a boy and a man battle the unforgiving voyage of a world where an apocolypse has occoured. They leave everything they have to go and try to find some safety and refuge. The two battle to stay alive versing hunger, dehydration, and cannibalism. There are many points in the book where I didn’t think they were going to make it, where I thought they were going to just lay down and give up. Yet they don't give up at all, they keep going until they cannot go anymore.\n\nCurrently, it seems that popular literature is filled with post-apocalyptic novels. These books sometimes venture into the fantasy and sci-fi genres, but always they portray the author’s idea of what humanity could look like after the world as we know it has ended. More importantly, they serve as mirrors for the vices currently plaguing society, demonstrating how these faults metastasize into major forces of evil when placed in the context of desperate circumstances. The Road, Cormac McCarthy’s harrowing description of a father-son pair slogging through the desolation of an unknown apocalypse, is no exception. McCarthy sets himself apart by emphasizing the nature of good and evil, utilizing flawless prose, and relentlessly confronting the reader with the inescapability of mortality. Truly, The Road is a brutally honest commentary on humanity’s capacity for cruelty and the never-ending struggle towards goodness.\n\nIs it possible that Freedom is something that can be given? No, freedom is not given, it is a right. America, the beautiful, a country that practices freedom, equality, and liberty as a right. America is a first world country that strives for development and prosperity. It is a world where miracle and magic occurs through hardwork and perseverance. As a result, America is represented in many artistic projects: poems, films, novels, etc. For instance, the two authors Cormac McCarthy, The Road, and Jack Kerouac, On The Road, implement the theme of America in their novel. As a result, the two novels critique America, praise America, and supports the American Dream. In addition, America’s culture and society is revealed through the two novels’ theme, road.\n\nThe Road is a story where is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where the date and location is unnamed. The author of the novel Cormac McCarthy doesn 't describe why or how the disaster has demolish the earth. But after reading the novel, I can sense that the author wanted to present a case of mystery and fear to the unknown to the reader. By the author 's exclusion I think that the story gains a better understanding of what the author wanted to express to the reader. An expression of a man and his son surviving in a post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nThe Road takes place in post-apocalyptic America after an unknown disaster occurs. The novel centers around a boy and his father, both of whom are never given names. In an analepse, the reader learns that the mother of the boy kills herself with “a flake of obsidian” as she fears that she would be raped and murdered (McCarthy 30). “[The man] hadn’t kept a calendar for years” and the reader is left unsure what year or month it is (McCarthy 2). The man is sure, however, that winter is approaching and it would be best for him and the boy to travel south where it is warmer. They have nothing but a pistol, their clothes, and a cart with food they scavenged for. The world is barren with “dust and ash everywhere” (McCarthy 3). The story chronicles the man and boy’s journey to the south while they look for food, supplies, and shelter. The pair must fend off “bad guys” during their journey as well (McCarthy 39). When one of these “bad guys” puts his knife at the boy’s throat, the man is left with no other option than to shoot the “bad guy” leaving a “hole in his forehead” (McCarthy 34). Another gruesome event occurs when the man and boy are looking for food in a house they found. While walking down a cellar’s stairs, they smell an “ungodly stench” (McCarthy 56). In the cellar, there are “naked people” who are whispering “help us” and a maimed man on a mattress with his “legs gone to the hip and the stumps of them blackened and burnt” (McCarthy 56). These people are being kept to be eaten eventually and the man and his son\n\nThe man and the boy rely on each other for more than just survival; the father’s sole motivation to continue living is his son. He cannot leave his son to die in the world, and he cannot take his son’s life along with his own. The boy acts as a beacon of hope for the man. Given the horrific conditions, the boy remains morally right, and that inspires the father to continue to fight for both of their lives. The idea that the man and his son are “carrying the fire” is recurrent throughout the novel (83). This fire represents the hope that they hold which allows them to continue on their journey. The nights that they must sleep without a fire are marked by gloom, and whenever a fire is present the reader experiences a more sanguine mood. Often in the novel, the boy’s physical wellness is compared to a flame. In one of the scenes, the man is worrying about the weakness of his son. “He didn’t think the boy could travel much more… the stillness and the sparks rose and dimmed and died in the eternal blackness” (96). The fire dying down into “eternal blackness” is referring to the boy in danger of dying of exhaustion."
