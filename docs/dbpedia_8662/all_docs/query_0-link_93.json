        "text": "I haven't read it, but The Road by Cormac McCarthy is getting rave reviews, not in the least from Stephen King. It's his top pick for best book of the year.\n\nSimple, stripped to the bare bones, this story of a man's effort to keep his son alive and to find any place of refuge in the wake of a great disaster is the finest achievement of McCarthy's career. I thought it was almost the perfect narrative â€” spare in its beauty and constantly driven forward by its own interior urgency. Impossible to put down, in other words.\n\nI quite liked Armageddon's Children by Terry Brooks.\n\nThe only cautionary note is that it is the first book in a news series that is going to be some sort of bridge between his Word and Void and Shannara series' (serieses? ). It also leans heavily towards the fantasy end of the spectrum.\n\nI haven't read it, but The Road by Cormac McCarthy is getting rave reviews, not in the least from Stephen King. It's his top pick for best book of the year.\n\nThe Road was very good!\n\nI'd also strongly recommend Wyndham's Re-Birth (a.k.a. The Chrysalids). Given the way so many look at the possibility of the apocalypse's religious overtones, this is perhaps an even more timely book today than in the period in which it was published.\n\nIt's a rich field, but these days it's a good deal harder to pull off, as it's an idea that's been done so much that it's become more the subject of parody than of serious stories. However, for those who'd like a look at some ideas on the sub-genre:\n\nApocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAnd this one gives a fairly good list, with various subdivisions:\n\nSF: Cosy Catastrophe Biblio\n\nwhereas this one lists those in the \"Dying Earth\" sort of tale (not restricted to Vance's stories....)\n\nDying Earth subgenre - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"
