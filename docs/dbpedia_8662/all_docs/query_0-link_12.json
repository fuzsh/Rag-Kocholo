        "text": "The wholesale embrace of genre fiction by contemporary literary writers is currently reorganizing the literary field. This essay looks at the role that genre has played in Cormac McCarthy’s fiction since his turn to the Western with Blood Meridian (1985). It assesses his genre fiction vis-à-vis Mark McGurl’s influential study of the importance of creative writing programs for postwar US fiction in The Program Era (2009). In contrast to the modernist aesthetic institutionalized in program era fiction, I argue that the recent genre turn significantly changes the relationship of literary fiction to reality as well as to institutions. I suggest that the turn to genre should be considered the formal response to a crisis in reality, triggered by twenty-first-century reconceptualizations of the world and our place in it, which requires new ways of representing reality. By reading McCarthy’s The Road (2006) alongside Colson Whitehead’s Zone One (2011), I argue that the genre turn in contemporary literary fiction also marks a turn toward institutions, one that both rejects the anti-institutionality of the program era and a return to the modern disciplinary institution in favor of rethinking a value basis for future institutions.\n\nThis study investigates the role of human nature and morality which underlay humanity’s obsession with (post-)apocalypse and the fiction concerned with it. It also examines human nature and morality in The Road in the light of Literary Darwinism, also known as Evolutionary Literary Study which its theoretical underpinning is evolutionary psychology. By adopting literary Darwinist approach and apocalyptic thinking, this research examines the (post-)apocalyptic genre and The Road in the light of models of human nature and behavior brought together by evolutionary psychology. The third chapter discusses the importance, history, roots, and meaning of (post-)apocalyptic fiction and its ability to reveal human dreams, anxieties, and fear. It is shown that by playing on universal (natural) and constructed (cultural) fears in their futuristic worlds, serious (post-)apocalyptic authors question human nature and morality when survival is in question. Moreover it demonstrates that (post-)apocalyptic fiction is crucially dependent on evolved properties of the human mind. The imaginative scenes depicted in suchlike novels are products of the human mind, and such scenes ought to be able to reveal something about the minds that produce them and their motives and ethos. The discussions on literary Darwinism and post-apocalyptic genre are practiced in the chapter on Cormac McCarthy’s post-apocalyptic The Road. Drawing on theories posited by Joseph Carroll provides the ground to analyze The Road as a construct emanating from McCarthy’s particular world view by using evolutionary conception of human nature as a basic framework within which to define the character of McCarthy’s world view. In addition to assessment of the manner in which McCarthy accords with or runs in tension with basic conception about human nature and morality, this chapter also discovers McCarthy’s basic elemental features of human nature, but in ways channeled and limited by the author’s cultural context and the author’s personal needs and the reason for creating such a post-apocalypse. The influence of McCarthy’s post-apocalyptic world on an audience and the author’s ethos and beliefs are also examined. Based on the analyses presented in this thesis, it is concluded that by drawing a line between culture and nature through lens of Literary Darwinism, and also by emphasizing evolutionary psychology’s conception of human nature and cultural context of the period, this thesis finds that the genre of (post-)apocalypse and McCarthy’s The Road are deeply affected by morality traits, human nature, and universal human fears and needs. Every genre and work of fiction can be analyzed in the light of literary Darwinism. Although a work of fiction is the construct of author’s imagination and it has abundant cultural elements, but the roots of every story traces back to human mind and human nature which in turn are the result of gene-culture coevolution. Key Words: Evolution, Cormac McCarthy, The Road, literary Darwinism, evolutionary psychology, human nature, morality, culture, (post-)apocalypse, fear.\n\nMcCarthy’s The Road is frequently described as a gloomy dystopia in which the redemption of humanity is impossible. This essay adopts a different perspective and focuses on the impact of the novel’s symbolism on the shifts in its overall message. The analysis leads to uncovering certain oppositions, apparent dichotomies and paradoxes incorporated in the novel’s recurring images and motifs, with particular emphasis on the motif of dream vision. McCarthy’s ascetic style is also considered in terms of its iconicity and functionality. In other words, this essay argues that the symbolically charged elements of The Road, due to their persistence in the text characterised by minimalism, form an intricate pattern which holds the novel’s allegorical message. The point advocated is that McCarthy’s literary symbolism leaves room for redemption in the world presented and signals the possibility of rebirth. It thus has the potential to gradually undermine and eventually subvert the initial perce...\n\nPopular culture in the western world is becoming increasingly enthralled by the apocalypse myth, which now appears in everything from film and television, to novels, to athletic events. This honours thesis seeks to discover the reason behind the human obsession with the apocalypse by tracing the history of the myth from its first known iterations, to the modern spectacles of destruction that dominate the silver screen. This thesis investigates why these narrative are so compelling, and suggests that the cause may be evolutionary. These findings are tested against two of the apocalyptic Golden Age’s more recent texts, Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Zak Hilditch’s These Final Hours, using a semiological analysis to determine what these texts are saying about life and death, and how these messages may be influencing contemporary human behaviour.\n\nThe people of the twenty-first century have become so dazed with technology and consumption that they senselessly severed their bond with the natural world. The only friction we see today between man and nature is in the images of pollution and consumption. Nevertheless, envisioning the repercussions of these issues has become a literary trend that endeavors to raise awareness about nature. The success of these literary works in evoking a sense of a dead planet shatters our illusion of a secured future. Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (2006) is an example of such success. His bleak vision of America’s future in the novel won him the Pulitzer Prize for \"distinguished fiction by an American author\". This research examines how McCarthy’s post-apocalyptic scenario could propel humans to review their current transgressions against nature. It applies the ecocritical theory to reveal the possible reasons behind the dark representations of nature in The Road. The first analytical part implements ecocriticism to study the futuristic representations of nature in the novel as it tests their compatibility with the current environmental issues. The second part investigates under an eco-Marxist lens the images of consumerism and capitalism in the post-apocalypse and their role in environmental destruction. The third part provides a scope of the various circumstances that led to the birth of the post-apocalyptic genre and highlights the role of its futuristic scenarios in environmental activism.\n\nThis paper attempts to study the experimental narrative structure to explore postmodern new humanism in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. The study focuses on three inextricable narrative elements, namely, the characters, narrative descriptions, and the novel’s spatial setting. It will demonstrate how McCarthy’s uses postmodern narrative experimentation to accentuate the necessity of halting the danger lurking behind the sustainable safety of the natural environment. Therefore, the study first examines the nameless characters of the novels as an exemplification of people who are devoid of their identity and sense of belonging due to natural catastrophes. Second, it identifies the narrative descriptions of the devastated environment ensuing gigantic disasters that obliterate the vast majority of the human civilization. Third, it looks into the conditions of the remaining survivors as the embodiment of the remains of the human civilization, and these survivors will be explored as the litera..."
