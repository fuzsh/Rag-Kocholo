        "text": "It only seems fitting to use the most obscure celebratory adjective imaginable to title an essay in adulation of a Cormac McCarthy novel. McCarthy largely broke from his Faulknerian gothic inspiration when he relocated from Tennessee to Texas, but he could never quite relinquish his affinity for the occasional esoteric curio or turn of phrase. Still, it would be impossible to dispute that it was in Texas that he definitively established his own voice; juiced on sun-hardened leather and rattlesnake venom McCarthy’s relentless observation of America’s fetid underbelly found its territorial match in the desert. Blood Meridian, his first novel written after he’d settled in Texas, was a watershed for McCarthy because it was a watershed for American literature, and also for the larger concept of American mythology, so deeply nestled in the mythmaking of the Old West and Manifest Destiny.\n\nHarold Bloom wasn’t being hyperbolic when he argued that Blood Meridian is “the ultimate Western” because pushing the boundaries of the genre further to expose what it truly means to “play Cowboys and Indians” isn’t functionally possible. McCarthy’s insider-outsiders’ point of view, as a Tennessee native moved to Texas 150 years too late to assume the mantle of “native Texan,” may have granted him the specific insight necessary to look past the hagiographic settlers’ memory while maintaining cultural kinship with the gruff white Appalachian people that wrangled the territory from the Native Americans once living there. He captures the particular mindset of these marauders and brigands and narrates it in their own voice, the voice that speaks of evil born of desperation. Regardless as to the sociological inspiration for Blood Meridian, the fact that he had the capacity to write a book so singular in ambition, scope, and perspective marked his permanent reservation in the American canon.\n\nBlood Meridian is, perhaps, the most significant piece of American literature in the postwar era. It’s almost universally lauded as the achievement of McCarthy’s career, and rightly so. As a kind of American Old Testament, Blood Meridian is an unsparing survey of the country’s original sin: not slavery, but the ceaseless cycle of betrayal and slaughter necessary to “settle” the “unclaimed” bounty of the open country, the birth of America as recognizable today. McCarthy ditches the lexical extravagance and cheeky wordplay of Suttree for a sparse, hardscrabble poetry reminiscent of a century’s old oral tradition printed for the first time. Desiccated scrubland, desolate mesas, and sun-bleached bones are the canvas for Blood Meridian’s internecine tableau of savage violence, imagery that could reasonably be mistaken for a blood rite summoning a descent into hell. The hard-won wisdom he delivers with backcountry prose is written with an easy familiarity. Never once does the stylistic approach McCarthy takes read artificially or grandiloquent; this is a language that the reader always believes is native to its author despite the variance from his previous work. The total effect is staggering, rivalled only in achievement by Thomas Pynchon’s Mason & Dixon as a work of fabricated historicity.\n\nDespite Blood Meridian’s modern stature, it was largely unnoticed upon release in 1985. Critical and academic acclaim failed to translate into a popular readership, as had always been the case for McCarthy. Popularity only came with his next book: All the Pretty Horses, a more straightforward romantic Western written in an even more terse McCarthyan style. Described as the “accessible” McCarthy novel — a label that necessarily does a disservice to his ability as an idiosyncratic but eminently lucid prose stylist — the press caught on and All the Pretty Horses was a hit. It’s a fine novel, albeit a shallow one in thematic or poetic comparison to Blood Meridian. Forbidden love in the last vestige of the Old West is the kind of premise that never fails to deliver a satisfying narrative, but also never challenges readers or revolutionizes a genre as many had come to expect from America’s new poet laureate of southern gothic violence. All the Pretty Horses is a book to change a reader’s week, Blood Meridian is a book to change a reader’s life.\n\nThe true literary import of All the Pretty Horses does not reside in the book itself, but in its role setting up the second installment of McCarthy’s Border Trilogy, The Crossing. John Grady Cole’s ill-fated sojourn into Mexican caballero country with his friend Lacey Rawlins in All the Pretty Horses establishes the setting and the tone for the loosely affiliated Border Trilogy. Contrasted with Blood Meridian’s acid western aesthetic, realized in a stygian spatter of blood reds and coagulated blacks, All the Pretty Horses and The Crossing are earthy and somatic, focusing on grounded characters and their immediate survival needs on the harsh, free frontier. (Tortillas and beans in a dried-out arroyo, anyone?) “The Kid” is used as a functional avatar for the balance of wild brutality and civilizing sadism, the figurehead for the bloody baptism of western settlers. John Grady and The Crossing’s Billy Parham are distinct personalities with desires unmoored from basic narrative utility. All of the Pretty Horses sets these different expectations so that The Crossing has no need to. The prose style and general narrative parameters are established, allowing Billy Parham’s story more freedom to test the limits of that style and the narrative convention of a literal border crossing doubling as a temporal passage backward into a romanticized “west.”\n\nPushing those boundaries means excavating the subconscious assumptions that serve as the foundation for all such Westerns and examining the more unsavoury characteristics of western settlement and expansion. Contrasting the perils navigated by John Grady and by Billy uncovers a marked distinction between the fantasy and the reality of Western freedom. John Grady’s passage into adulthood in Mexico is marred by misfortune and a series of well-intentioned missteps, but in every troubling situation he’s able to escape because he is presented as a fearless Renaissance Man of the West; he is hyper-competent in all things cowboy. John Grady’s convictions are never subject to doubt because his physical abilities and his heroic instincts never limit his capacity to maneuver through consequences of his actions. He is John Wayne at 16, an indestructible romantic idol of the West shielded by his courage and preternatural skill. Billy Parham, by comparison, is a resourceful but entirely limited young man persistently wracked by self-doubt and guilt. His intuitions and his inclinations are just as well-meaning and just as naïve as any of John Grady’s, but they are always punished, and far more harshly. Billy’s bravery always doubles as temerity and his patience as cowardice. A lack of experience and maturity is not a hurdle to clear with heroism but an obstacle to stumble through painfully. Even this understated world of the West is uglier, nastier, and far deadlier than anything John Grady is forced to confront, a notion that encourages the reader to sympathize more with Billy; our world is nothing like the one we were promised either.\n\nThe Crossing is not an anthology story. It’s a tragedy in substitute of All the Pretty Horses’ romantic hero’s journey. Billy’s perspective is the inverse of John Grady’s, he is the sidekick, the young man with the heart of a hero but the body of a bystander and the mind of a mere mortal. Instead, it’s Billy’s younger brother Boyd that serves as the obvious analog for John Grady in The Crossing, wild-eyed and willful. The comparison between the two is fairly striking: from the sudden destruction of the future embodied in the loss of the homestead, McCarthy’s ruthless liquidation of all available parental figures, and to the whirlwind infatuation with a beautiful, laconic Mexican girl foreshadowing doom. John Grady and Boyd both comport themselves with a kind of gumption and verve that Billy cannot muster. Their first instinct becomes action without hesitation, while Billy is bewildered and torn by the total array of paths available to him and the moral implications inherent to each one. Confidence and carelessness constitute John Grady and Boyd. Billy is handcuffed to Boyd, he only possesses the ability to bear witness, he exists as a passenger fettered to a more primal spiritual force of nature in Boyd who features as a kind of executor for the West’s final will.\n\nTragedy in All the Pretty Horses is confined to the discovery that there is no place left for John Grady to perform his American birthright as a cowboy. Like most of the great Westerns it is a reckoning with the end of a rustic American ideal of freedom and inexorable acquiescence to the codes of easterners that do not know this country — only in this case the story is played out in Mexico, America’s frontier has already been fully colonized. The Crossing quite literally concludes with the actualization of that tragedy, a final, cruel blow delivered against Billy to close a narrative of suffering and loneliness. Tragedy in The Crossing plays out as a perverted mirror to All the Pretty Horses, one in which the actions of the protagonist do have consequences, including the loss of every person, place, or thing that Billy holds dear. He undertakes a series of major “quests” that perform as the narrative arc of the book, and his minutest of decisions regarding the tiniest of details in each endeavour cost him absolutely everything. Billy’s decision to return the injured wolf mother to Mexico results in her torture and death because he chose the wrong moment to cross a river. His prolonged return from Mexico, ragged and starving, most likely cost his parents any shot at survival during an unseen raid on the family farmstead. His misbegotten plan to find and requisition the family’s stolen horses is a debacle at every turn because Billy can never quite figure out when to be forceful and when to retreat, his bravery and his attempted sagacity are always punished. Boyd is nearly killed, the horses are never recovered, and his baby brother abandons him precisely because Billy is not John Grady, because there is no cosmic force decisively intervening to make him “right.”\n\nBilly’s only consolation at the end of The Crossing is his life. Boyd isn’t so lucky. All that is left of the romantic hero in The Crossing is his ramshackle remains in an unmarked grave, found by his hapless brother years later, and then beset upon and desecrated by bandits. The mark of the romantic hero doubles as the mark of the dead man in this West, the West of consequence and bad blood. Billy can do nothing to repress this fate because his own fate is that of the ineffectual spectator, doomed to live in perdition while the romantic hero dies free. McCarthy’s final ruling for the romantic hero is a sentence to a life that is nasty, brutish, and short — that’s what it means to be free in the final peninsula of the West. Boyd’s bones are to serve as a memento mori: John Wayne does not live here. He never could.\n\nThe Crossing wouldn’t be worth writing about if it didn’t hold water as a discrete text of its own, though. Meta-textual conversation with Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses, or with Westerns generally, is not essential to the quality of the book. Rather, its thematic depth and emotional resonance are the most profound in McCarthy’s entire bibliography. With regard to the thematic foundation of the novel, the recurring McCarthyan motif of a brutal and violent freedom as the lone alternative to sadistic civil spectacle is once again essential in The Crossing, but here it’s woven so seamlessly into the narrative that it may hold its most power among his novels. For McCarthy, inveterate reactionary that he is, violence is an inevitable by-product of man’s ineluctable nature, resultant from his being a part of nature and the natural world of violence. Mankind’s agency is exerted only in the outward shape and expression of that violence. This theme serves as the symmetrical narrative capstones for The Crossing, inciting Billy’s growth into manhood. Billy’s story is bookended by an inverse quest to return a thing of the wild to its “rightful” cosmic position in the world. The tragedy of the lost and tortured wolf mother that inspires Billy’s first trip into Mexico finds its antipode in the reclamation of Bandito Boyd, returned a final time to the United States as a bag of bones. In trying to save the wolf mother from a quick, bloody death at the behest of the American hunters Billy attempts to assert a kind of Platonic order to the forms around him, to return a creature of essence to its correct place, but in doing so he subjects that creature to the possibility of immense pain and humiliation. Billy’s reclamation of Boyd is a final, desultory attempt to impose that same order, a doomed effort nonetheless undertaken in the name of some morbid duty to family and to the forms. Naturally, McCarthy cannot allow this, and the despoliation of Boyd’s body marks a revelation for Billy: the imposition of control, particularly over things wild, does not curtail violence but instead invites the savagery inherent to the civilizational impulse.\n\nBoyd and the wolf mother finish The Crossing as bones in makeshift graves, returned home but without recourse or meaning. Their bodies belong to the correct cartographic spaces, but their essences are domain of the void.\n\nMcCarthy uses the inevitability of violence and its relationship with freedom to explicate the second major theme of The Crossing, a theme that had to this point in his bibliography remained adumbrate, or at least ambiently implicit: faith not as comfort but as conspiracy in the world of ubiquitous violence and natural destruction. Billy repeatedly crosses paths with itinerants and anchorites that relay biographical anecdotes or autobiographical monologues about the fates of men and the arbitrary events that dictated the contours of their lives. These tales of preservation, suffering, and occasional redemption are largely unrelated with the exception of the key theme, the persistence of a vengeful and conspiratorial God as the architect of personal hardship. The story that the lone Mormon convert to Catholicism narrates is quite obviously the keystone encounter used to clarify the theme. Spiritually broken by the violent death of his family in a natural disaster, a Mexican villager becomes a heretical hermit that challenges and insults the omnipotence of God’s will by taking refuge under a precarious ruined church belltower, the iconic landmark of his village. It becomes clear that the possibility of a grand design, even a malignant one, is far more comforting to the hermit than the alternative, that he was made to suffer because the universe does not operate according to human emotional expectation, that a completely random act unknowable to anybody robbed him of his family.\n\nThat basic premise is repeated multiple times, notably by a blind mendicant and his wife. Conspiracy of the malevolent God as a psychological bulwark against the more horrifying possibility that there is no meaning to this violence and to this destruction, and that man weathers this burden waiting for brief fragments of grace that the cosmos may never bequeath is an epiphanic conclusion for McCarthy. The Crossing marks the realization of a long-held belief finally expressed as desired.\n\nFrom a writing perspective The Crossing is also a highlight of McCarthy’s career. McCarthy is clearly more confident and exacting in the use of this style than in All of the Pretty Horses, leading to some of his finest analogs and bizarrely effective similes. Again, the prose is more grounded than Blood Meridian and less gothic than Suttree, but this imbues the narrative with a kind of immediacy unique to The Border Trilogy. And it also means that The Crossing packs an unprecedented emotional gut punch. The trademark hyper-masculine prose is naturally still intact but it’s slightly more limber with the stripped-down stylistic choice he’s made, allowing him to take his stories in directions other than “inescapable nightmare realm consumes the souls of morally-compromised rubes.” Not only is audience sympathy for Billy imperative for the effectiveness of The Crossing, but it seems clear that McCarthy himself also feels quite deeply for his characters this time around; it’s preferable to avoid any armchair psychology in suggesting that McCarthy sees himself in Billy, but it’s certainly possible that it was his intent to foster that type of personalized connection with all readers.\n\nThe audience is made to sympathize with Billy because the labours he sets for himself are noble ones. McCarthy is assiduous in bringing the reader to the same conclusion that Billy does regarding the fate of the wolf — sure it’s killed a number of cattle, but it cannot be held responsible for behaving in accordance with its essence as a wolf. Does the wolf truly deserve to die, and its brood along with it, simply because it became lost and entered a territory now alien to its kind? How wise is the reader and how strong is their will? Could they be the one to pull the trigger and kill the last living wolf in this territory or would they saddle themselves with the same responsibility to return it home? Ultimately, the wolf’s fate would have been no different under our aegis because we too are limited beings. Forcing Billy to confront the result of his good intentions and to make the difficult decision to kill the wolf rather than to watch her continue to suffer is doubly devastating because the reader must also confront their own benevolent instinct. Unscrupulous nobility is a liability in this country.\n\nFurther, how is the reader not to sympathize with Billy’s crossing to find and bring Boyd back to New Mexico? Burying a family member close to home is a final consolation, that solitary morsel of closure needed to keep moving forward with the knowledge that person will never be with us again. What are we if not an agglomeration of our customs and rituals, passed down from parents and local circumstances? Leaving Boyd to disintegrate in the land that killed him is instinctually unfathomable to the reader, making Billy’s ignominious last crossing not only relatable but emotionally essential. Ripping that consolation from Billy in order to teach him a final lesson about the futility of ceremony or formality in establishing order is a kick in the teeth for the audience, too. (McCarthy is, at least, kind enough (for once) to spare Billy’s long-time equine companion after it is stabbed by the petty thieves that desecrate Boyd.) Billy has no divine calling but to clean up the mess, most likely the one that he’s already made by extending himself beyond his own powers. Still, he is alive. That mythic elan or Byronic will to adventure he desperately wants — and that we, too, also want — is what gets you killed.\n\nThere are no heroes that make it out alive. John Wayne died here a long time ago. There are no real lessons to learn either; part of the will to freedom is the acceptance of violence as the ruling principle in a state of nature, arbitrary endings and all. There is no grand or divine meaning in the West, only rough and tumble liberty and the sadistic impulse to civilize, expropriate, and to spoil the final habitat of those unfit for the shackles of civilization.\n\nBlood Meridian is inarguably Cormac McCarthy’s most significant work and now certainly the most influential. Its place in the American canon is undisputed as popular discussion and academic scholarship continue to proliferate exponentially, a major win for McCarthy’s great fans and supporters. But Blood Meridian is not his best novel. The Crossing is the definitive McCarthy book as the most profound distillation and expression of everything that its author has intended to communicate across his 50-year career, and it’s time that it received the recognition that it deserves. It’s highly unlikely that The Crossing will ever match the stature of Blood Meridian, but a reappraisal of the book is necessary because its current reputation as “the boring sequel to All the Pretty Horses” is so dismally unfit for such a phenomenal piece of writing. There are unquestionably a loyal band of The Crossing-heads (myself among them) proselytizing and fighting that good fight, and eventually the book will receive its due. McCarthy readers will have to contend with more than Suttree, Child of God, and All the Pretty Horses after they’ve completed Blood Meridian, and they’ll have to think about what they’ve read even more purposefully, too. Until that time, essays like this one will have to continue to nag and prod those readers that want to pass over The Crossing. There are no heroes left alive in the West, but The Crossing will carry on as McCarthy’s best book, unassuming and unheralded just like it’s non-hero."
