        "text": "Find your next great read for National Reading Month by exploring my reviews of these engrossing apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books.\n\nMost of my reading and reviews is contemporary YA fiction, but when I want something thrilling and non-stop action, I turn to apocalyptic fiction. Not fantasy or pure science fiction, but sinister, dark worlds where society as we know it has ended. Everything has changed. I love seeing characters with grit who struggle with epic and seemingly impossible conflicts. Yet in the end, they triumph.\n\nI don’t know about you, but that gives me hope about right now.\n\nHere are my reviews of the most engrossing apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books. Be prepared to stay up half the night reading. You won’t be able to put them down.\n\nNot a Drop to Drink by Mindy McGinnis\n\n“There's different ways of doing things wrong, Lynn, and not all of it is choosing to hurt others. Sometimes it's the things you don't do that make you feel the worst.” ― Mindy McGinnis, quote from Not a Drop to Drink\n\nSet in an apocalyptic future where drinking water is scarce and people fight for survival in a wild frontier, Lynn is a young woman in rural Ohio defending a pond and her homestead. Her mother raised her to distrust, to fight, and to live, and that's what she intends to do.\n\nI enjoyed watching Lynn's fierce character evolve into a person who was willing to allow others into her life, to trust and even love. Despite her hardness, she had a kind heart. There were some interesting scenes in interactions with other people, like the stranger on the road, that tested her humanity.\n\nNot a Drop to Drink was also a fast, thrilling YA book about survival, and its sequel, In a Handful of Dust, follows Lynn and her adopted daughter Lucy into the unknown after a mysterious plague drives them away from their home and community and into the wilderness.\n\nIf you’re looking for engrossing apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books, give these two a try. In fact, Mindy McGinnis is so awesome she’s on my list of Best YA Authors to Binge on Kindle Unlimited.\n\nThe Razorland Trilogy: Enclave, Outpost, Horde by Ann Aguirre\n\nThe Razorland Trilogy were the first apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books that I read, and from the very first pages, I was hooked! The novels are set in a dark future where the cities are ruined by plague, war, “tunnel monsters,” and ongoing skirmishes between the surviving gangs that roam in this world. In the first book, Enclave, we meet the heroine, a fifteen-year-old girl named Deuce who lives in the New York subway in a community called an enclave. Life is hard. It becomes even harder when she and another teenage Hunter are exiled from their enclave and must go to the surface to live.\n\nThe next two books, Outpost and Horde, follow Deuce in her new life above ground, and all three novels are fast-paced, engrossing reads that I couldn’t put down. Each book was as good as the last, very immersive, and Deuce is a well-drawn, fighting heroine that I rooted for every step of the way.\n\nCheck out these books. You will love them.\n\nZ for Zachariah by Robert O’Brien\n\n“I am afraid. Someone is coming.” ― Robert C O’Brien, quote from Z for Zachariah\n\nI remember reading this book in our school library in high school, and it was chilling. Now an adult, decades later, I bought a copy of it to see if it was really as good as I remembered.\n\nYes, yes it is!\n\nYoung adult fiction wasn't even \"a thing\" when this book was written, and yet, it's a thrilling, roller-coaster true YA novel about a 15-year-old girl (who turns 16 during the events) who believes she's the last person alive after a nuclear war. She's resilient, resourceful, wary, hopeful, and that mix of both childlike and wise that you would expect from a teen in this situation.\n\nWhen a stranger arrives in the valley, a man, she is cautious, but as events unfold and he becomes sick, she lets her guard down to help him. This turns out to be a mistake.\n\nThe Hollywood movie version gets this book wrong: the female is older, and there are two men. If you love dystopian YA novels and haven't picked this one up, I highly recommend it!\n\nUnwind by Neal Shusterman\n\n“You see, a conflict always begins with an issue - a difference of opinion, an argument. But by the time it turns into a war, the issue doesn't matter anymore, because now it's about one thing and one thing only: how much each side hates the other.” ― Neal Shusterman, quote from Unwind\n\nUnwind is Book #1 in a 5-part dystopian YA series in which teens may be sent to \"Harvest Camps\" to be chopped up for parts if their parents sign the papers. No part is wasted.\n\nSome, like Connor, are signed over because of behavior problems. Others, like Risa, are wards of the state who simply don't make the cut in terms of protegee status. Lev begins as a religious tithe, a willing victim, but after being kidnapped and freed by Connor, he also changes.\n\nThe concept of this series and the plotting are great, and I'm interested to see where the rest of the books go. There were moments, though, where I thought the book fell short of greatness. For example:\n\nIf a parent is able to bring all the parts of their child back together again, can they recover their child?\n\nWhere do the souls of these children go?\n\nThere are some attempts at these questions, but I wanted the book to go deeper. The fact that I keep thinking about the unwinding process means that something important is being covered here.\n\nYou definitely want to add Unwind to your TBR pile of apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books.\n\nThe Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins\n\nThere’s a reason that The Hunger Games always appears at the top of lists for apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books. This series has everything: a relatable and flawed heroine in Katniss, a love triangle, life-and-death adventure, good and evil, a stark world of intense poverty contrasted against ridiculous gluttony, and deeper themes about society at large.\n\nThis series is amazing. I could read it multiple times and still find new things to love. I have seen the movies multiple times, but there are things in the books that are just wonderful.\n\nDon’t miss these lovely books.\n\nDivergent by Veronica Roth\n\n“…we’ve learned that all we can do is look after our own. Reese and Byatt, they’re mine and I’m theirs.” ― Rory Power, quote from Wilder Girls\n\nI wanted to read Wilder Girls for many years on the basis of its cover alone. It’s one of my top-10 YA favorite covers of all time. It’s so beautiful and intriguing, without even knowing what the story is about.\n\nAn all-girls school on an island is quarantined because of a mysterious plague that has killed a significant portion of both the student and faculty population, as well as animals, and the remaining people are infected. This disease does terrible things to them. Now, they’re waiting for a cure. It’s been promised. They just have to stay alive until it comes.\n\nThe pacing is fast, and I was drawn into the relationships between the girls. They are gritty heroines. I couldn’t wait to discover what was truly going on and how this situation would ultimately be resolved.\n\nIf you’re looking for some apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books and missed this one, give it a try. Wilder Girls definitely meets the criteria for this list.\n\nBonus Round: The Stand by Stephen King\n\n“Love didn't grow very well in a place where there was only fear, just as plants didn't grow very well in a place where it was always dark.” ― Stephen King, quote from The Stand\n\nIn addition to these young adult apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian novels, one book stands above the crowd: Stephen King’s The Stand. It’s my all-time favorite book. I’ve read it at least 7 times. I read it first in high school, so while it may not be a YA book in the strict definition of the category, teen readers can handle it. Trust me. I wrote my senior thesis about the themes in this book.\n\nIn this sweeping apocalyptic novel, a man-made virus named Captain Tripps kills almost everyone on earth. There are a handful of remaining viewpoint characters who become the focal point for this epic story. Their storylines run concurrently. At first they seem disconnect, but slowly they begin moving and coming together. There are some truly terrifying scenes, and a supernatural element pops up because—remember—it’s Stephen King. At the end of the world, the heroes must make a final stand against evil.\n\nIf you never read this book, check it out. I bet you’ll add it to your list of favorite post-apocalyptic books, too!\n\nBonus Round #2: The Road by Cormac McCarthy\n\n“You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.” ― Cormac McCarthy, quote from The Road\n\nTo qualify as a young adult novel, the book must be in the viewpoint of a teen, and part of The Road is in the viewpoint of the father. Don’t let that stop you. This dystopian, post-apocalyptic book is gripping from the very first page. A man and his son are on the road, and something truly awful has happened. What?\n\nThe story unfolds at a crawl. You can feel the agony and terror of their situation. There are a couple of scenes that are truly chilling. The horror of them has remained with me forever.\n\nThere’s a reason this novel won a Pulitzer Prize. Pick it up. You won’t regret it.\n\nOther Apocalyptic, Post-Apocalyptic, and Dystopian YA Science Fiction Books\n\nIf you are looking for some other apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian YA science fiction books, check out the YA Dystopian Books list on Goodreads.
