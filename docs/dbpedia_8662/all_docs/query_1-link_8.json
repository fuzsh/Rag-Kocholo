        "text": "Cormac McCarthy, who died on Tuesday at the age of 89, was renowned for stark and violent novels of the American South and West that were distinguished by a merciless vision and nearly biblical prose. From the start his writing drew comparisons to novelists as different as William Faulkner and Mark Twain, but his themes were always and recognizably his own: justice, despair, the futile but urgent need for hope in a fallen world.\n\nJerome Charyn’s description of “Suttree,” in The Times’s 1979 review, could well be about any of McCarthy’s novels. “The book comes at us like a horrifying flood. The language licks, batters, wounds — a poetic, troubled rush of debris,” Charyn wrote. “It is personal and tough, without that boring neatness and desire for resolution that you can get in any well-made novel. Cormac McCarthy has little mercy to spare, for his characters or himself. … ‘Suttree’ is like a good, long scream in the ear.”\n\nThese seven novels comprise the best of McCarthy’s work.\n\nSuttree (1979)\n\nMany scholars consider this to be McCarthy’s greatest Southern novel. It traces the title character’s life along the Tennessee River in the spirit of a “doomed Huckleberry Finn,” as The Times wrote of the book. Having left behind a life of privilege, Suttree spends his days fishing, trawling Knoxville’s seedy underbelly and mingling with drunks, grifters and misfits. His attempts to connect more meaningfully with others invariably end in disaster. At nearly 500 pages, this whipsawing picaresque is McCarthy’s longest (and perhaps most autobiographical) novel and reflects the height of his sardonic humor.\n\nBlood Meridian (1985)\n\nThis scorched-earth epic is widely hailed as McCarthy’s masterpiece, a challenging (some might say impenetrable) and breathtakingly violent tale of a teenage wanderer known as “the kid,” who heads across the American South and into Mexico in the mid-19th century. Along the way, he joins the psychotic Glanton gang, scalp hunters who were originally committed to fending off Apache attacks but turned instead to indiscriminately murdering nearly every Indian or Mexican they met. The novel’s heavyweight themes — Manifest Destiny, nihilism’s triumph over morality — are complemented by unforgettable imagery and sentences as expansive as desert skies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
