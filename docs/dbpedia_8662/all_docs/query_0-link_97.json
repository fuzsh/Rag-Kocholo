        "text": "When the gods do it, it is horrific and epic in scale. But when characters in post-apocalyptic fiction are driven to it by circumstances, it is almost always laughably unbelievable.\n\nSpoilers for Bodeen’s The Compound, McCarthy’s The Road, and a few other things follow, if you care. Post also contains unapologetic and practical considerations of cannibalism with no moral/ethical judgment on those who eat others to survive.\n\nReading S.A. Bodeen’s YA post-apocalyptic novel The Compound, I was annoyed at how poorly handled and unrealistic one of the central horrors of the story was. It’s an otherwise decent read (though with a predictable “twist”), but it is bogged down with a central motif that just doesn’t make a damn bit of sense.\n\nThe author sketches a somewhat preposterous scenario where survivors of a supposedly apocalyptic event, confined to a well-stocked compound, eventually begin to run low on food stores and contemplate killing and eating their “surrogates” to survive. These surrogates are genetic clones of our survivors and have been bred through in-vitro fertilization by way of the evil genius science guy antagonist and brought to term (rapidly) by a quasi-surrogate mother (she’s their real genetic mom too–the horror!). The lurid situation and moral quandary, then, is supposedly that these surrogate babies are not just real people, but also siblings/children.\n\nIt’s kind of a silly set-up, but it could be played reasonably well under other initial conditions if there weren’t a huge logical problem under these conditions. Matter, energy, and therefore food, doesn’t just pop into existence because people have babies. The babies need to eat, which means either they are consuming food directly out of the existing, limited stores or via a nursing mother who needs more energy/food in order to nurse and thus more rations. And the human body isn’t that efficient of a system, which means some of the food energy consumed by the surrogate babies is lost to things like playing and breathing and the like. So by even breeding and feeding these surrogates (which is totally unnecessary to the story for any reason other than to provide potential food sources and a bit of horror at the extremes people will go to to survive), the survivors are actually wasting food they can never hope to recover. To say that another way, the premise of eating people to preserve yourself is predicated on those people eating food you have no opportunity to eat directly. So the genius science guy is obviously not all that smart and the scenario comes across as stupid.\n\nI guess this is sort of forgivable since it’s a YA novel playing on specific horrors/fears of being a kid while employing the furniture of post-apocalyptic fiction and an old motif of one of our greatest taboos–people eating. But it is just one of many examples of this motif being deployed poorly in this kind of fiction. In fact, I can think of few post-apocalyptic stories where cannibalism comes in and actually seems well-done. Where the custom of the sea has been used rather deftly in many realistic tales of survival, it turns into either an absurd and obvious attempt to shock or a logically flawed plot device (or both) in almost all post-apocalyptic fiction.\n\nOne of the most critically and commercially successful post-apocalyptic novels is an obvious example of this: Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. The setting is perfect for cannibalism: all the food is gone besides what canned goods remain stashed away in bunkers or the like. No new food grows, and consuming another human being makes sense in the context of the novel (though it is the thing the protagonists will not do because it would remove them from the tribe of “good guys”). McCarthy actually handles this well early on: the man and the boy rightly fear very believable cannibals and encounter what the reader sees as dangerous people-eaters.\n\nHowever, McCarthy’s doing justice to need-based cannibalism falls apart in two of the most horrific and famous scenes in the book. First, the man and boy break into a locked basement to discover people being held alive for use as food–one man’s leg has been amputated (presumably eaten) and cauterized badly. The implication is that these people have been abducted by a group of cannibals who captured them off the road. So, in this way, the situation makes sense because they are immediate victims who had their own supplies of food–not depleting the stores of their captors. But, why keep them alive? I suppose they are not fed by the cannibals, but whatever food energy is in their bodies is decreasing with ongoing starvation and atrophy (not to mention they must need water, which is also somewhat scarce in this world). A smarter group of cannibals would have killed them immediately and found a way to preserve the meat. There is no shortage of firewood, and, given that this is their subsistence strategy, you’d think they would have worked out a way to smoke and dry the only meat available. But, no, the scene isn’t that thought through and the horror of the discovery seems expected to overshadow any objections to the lack of realistic and practical considerations.\n\nFar more egregious than this is the scene where the man and boy see a group including a pregnant woman. They later discover the group’s camp, hastily abandoned with a newborn’s body spit-roasted for great horrific effect. The atrocity of this scene carries it through for most readers I’m sure, but I can’t get over how obviously flawed it is. One, this is a world where everyone is pretty much starving–women don’t usually get pregnant, much less bring a child near term, under such circumstances. Two, even if the young lady could conceive and successfully bring a child to even a month or two near full-term, the increased caloric necessity of a mother with child would far outweigh whatever caloric value the child would have for these resourceful and vile cannibals.\n\nIt just doesn’t make sense to include cannibalism in a realistic (ie, not fantastic in the sense of magic and such) scenario if the motif isn’t worked through in a plausible fashion. A far better portrayal of cannibalism than these is found in the oft-maligned Harlan Ellison story/novella, “A Boy and His Dog” (and the film adaptation with Don Johnson as Vic, which is fun if you are watching it as the black comedy it really seems to be). There it is obviously used in a lurid, metaphorical, and absurd manner, but it passes without objection from me on realistic grounds because it is entirely plausible from a survival perspective . . . if one can stomach it.\n\nMaybe I’m just selecting a few poor examples, but I’m having a tough time thinking of much fiction in this genre where the motif is handled well. Chime in if you think there are examples that can disprove my general feeling on this."
