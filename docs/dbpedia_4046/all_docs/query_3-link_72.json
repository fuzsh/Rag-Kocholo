        "text": "No. 1: The Beach\n\nLess than one mile from campus, the beach is where our students go to surf, soak up the sun, and relax with friendsâand some are even lucky enough to see the waves crashing from their residence hall adjacent to the boardwalk.\n\nNo. 2: Our Mascot\n\nEnergetic and fun-loving, Shadow the Hawk can always be spotted shaking a tail feather at sporting events and campus celebrations.\n\nNo. 3: Our Trailblazers\n\nThirty-three percent of current undergraduate students are the first in their family to pursue a college degree, and Monmouthâs personalized approach to serving them has earned the University national designation as a First-gen Forward Institution by the Center for First Generation Student Success.\n\nNo. 4: Our Championship Culture\n\nMonmouthâs small-school feel belies the big-school vibes of its Division I athletics program, which has won 152 regular season championships, compiled 45 NCAA Tournament appearances, and produced 127 professional athletesâall while competing against some of the biggest programs in the country.\n\nNo. 5: Location, Location, Location\n\nSituated in idyllic West Long Branch, New Jersey, less than one mile from the Atlantic Ocean and one hour from New York City, Monmouthâs coastal campus offers easy access to a host of cultural and recreational opportunities, from the boutique shops and eateries lining the streets of Long Branch to the upscale offerings of Pier Village to nature hikes in nearby Atlantic Highlands and Sandy Hook. Our unrivaled location also impacts and enhances learning experiences. Students study marine and environmental biology at sea. They intern at Fortune 500 companies in New York City. They perform and pursue their artistic passions in Red Bankâs renowned theater district and Asbury Parkâs legendary music and arts scene.\n\nNo. 6: Our Beautiful Campus\n\nMonmouthâs picturesque, 170-acre campus is home to state-of-the-art labs and learning spaces, multiple theaters and art galleries, Division Iâlevel athletic facilities, ample green space, and two historic buildings. Itâs no surprise ours has been named one of the 10 most beautiful campuses in the world.\n\nNo. 7: No Lecture Halls\n\nWith class sizes capped at 35, no classes taught by graduate students, and a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1, Monmouth gives students more opportunities to engage in meaningful dialogue with their professors. Itâs what a highly personalized educational experience should look like.\n\nNo. 8: Peaceful Pursuits\n\nMonmouth was the first college in New Jersey to offer the Peace Corps Volunteer Preparatory Program, which helps students build the competencies needed to serve as an agency volunteer, and ranked No. 5 in the nation on the Peace Corpsâ most recent list of the top certificateâissuing schools.\n\nNo. 9: Our Palace of Books\n\nThe opulent building into which generations of Monmouth students have withdrawn in search of a quiet place to study originally served as the summer retreat of Murry and Leonie Guggenheim, American socialites known for their extravagant wealth and philanthropy. Modeled after the Petit Trianon, which stands on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles, the Guggenheim Memorial Library was conveyed to Monmouth in 1960 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nNo. 10: Our 10th Prez\n\nHeâs a perennial inclusion on lists of the top influencers in higher education, so weâd be remiss if we left Monmouthâs 10th president, Patrick F. Leahy, off our list. While guiding us through the COVID-19 pandemic, Leahy has helped Monmouth achieve its highest-ever ranking in U.S. News & World Report, usher in a new era in athletics by joining the Colonial Athletic Association, launch a five-year strategic plan, bring Commencement back to campus, and continue to set new benchmarks in the diversity and academic preparedness of its incoming classes.\n\nNo. 11: The NEST\n\nSeeing an uptick nationally in the number of college students who reported being food insecure, the Student Government Association created this student-run food pantry to support Monmouth students who are food insecure by providing nonperishable food items, beverages, and personal hygiene items donated from the community.\n\nNo. 12: Apt Descriptors\n\nCited as one of the stateâs âgrandest campus buildings,â the Great Hall at Shadow Lawn is a registered National Historic Landmark and serves as the iconic centerpiece of campus. Built in 1929 as the private residence of former F.W. Woolworth Co. president Hubert Templeton Parson and his wife, Maysie, the interior design was led by Julian Abele, one of the countryâs first professionally trained African American architects. The mansion, which boasts 130 rooms and 50 varieties of Italian marble, has served as the setting for weddings, private events, and movies, most notably Annie. But perhaps the buildingâs greatest role is its recent return to a central campus hub for students, who get to study and collaborate within its walls.\n\nNo. 13: Our Remington\n\nThe library has on permanent display one of Frederic Remingtonâs most famous sculptures, âThe Bronco Busterâ No. 35. The iconic sculptureâof which an earlier casting of the same work has been a longtime fixture in the Oval Officeâwas donated to the University by the Guggenheim family in 1989.\n\nNo. 14: Womenâs Rowing\n\nThe newest addition to Monmouthâs athletics program made a splash by winning multiple medals during its first year of competition.\n\nNo. 15: Not-So-Pedestrian Passages\n\nEven bridge and tunnel traffic will bring a smile to your face here, whether youâre traversing the Arthur M. Greenbaum Bridge (above left), which connects Pozycki and Bey Halls and offers a unique view of beautiful Torcivia Common below, or passing friends in the Swannack Gateway (aka, âthe tunnel,â above right), the subterranean passageway that links the north and south sides of the main campus.\n\nNo. 16: The Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music\n\nHousing close to 35,000 itemsâincluding Springsteenâs written works, photographs, periodicals, and other artifactsâthe Archives is literally the Promised Land to scholars, authors, and fans who have a serious interest in the singerâs life and prolific career. The Archives also creates traveling exhibits, educational conferences, public programs, teacher workshops, and scholastic field trips aimed at exploring the American music tradition and furthering academic discourse in various fields of American music. This spring, it hosted its inaugural American Music Honors event, and in 2025, it will open an exhibition space in Springsteenâs hometown, Freehold, New Jersey.\n\nNo. 17: Student Scholarship Week\n\nHeld yearly every April, this weeklong series of events showcases and celebrates student achievement in research, writing, the arts, service learning, clinical experiences, and leadership development.\n\nNo. 18: The Number 18\n\nWhatâs the significance, you ask? Thatâs Monmouthâs ranking on U.S. News & World Reportâs Best Regional Universities North listâthe Universityâs highest everâ and the number of consecutive years Monmouth has been named one of the nationâs best institutions for undergraduates by The Princeton Review.\n\nNo. 19: Our Poll Position\n\nMonmouthâs Polling Institute has been called âfreakishly accurate,â âthe gold standard of polling in New Jersey,â and âone of the most respected and highly regarded measures of public opinion in the nationâ by various media outlets. Its recent A rating from FiveThirtyEight only reaffirms its standing as one of the countryâs most accurate polling operations.\n\nNo. 20: Our Coastal Crusaders\n\nSince its founding in 2005, the Urban Coast Institute has been making the regionâs coastal communities more resilient to the impacts of storms and climate change, and the regionâs waterways cleaner and healthier, while working to ensure that future ocean management actions and policies are based on the best available science.\n\nNo. 21: The Parton Broadcasting Center\n\nCanât make it to a game? You can still catch all the action from home thanks to the ultramodern Parton Broadcasting Center, which enables the award-winning (and primarily student-composed) Monmouth Digital Network team tobroadcast Hawks athletics contests on the YES Network, SportsNet New York, and NBC Sports Philadelphia and stream it to FloSports.\n\nNo. 22: Our Big Bird\n\nTwenty-twoâthatâs the wingspan (in feet) of The Hawk at Brockriede Common, the gargantuan bronze sculpture depicting a real-life version of our mascot. Sculpted by world-renowned artist Brian Hanlon â88, the Hawkâs larger-than-life proportionsâ15 feet tall and weighing 29,000 poundsâsymbolize the outsize spirit, energy, and enthusiasm of Monmouthâs students, staff, alumni, and supporters.\n\nNo. 23: So Sweet A Cat Field\n\nDespite its feline implication, the name of Monmouthâs field hockey field comes from a racehorse once owned by the late Jane Freed â81, whose gift helped make the field turf possible.\n\nNo. 24: We âDIGâ Diversity\n\nMonmouthâs Diversity Innovation Grants provide funding for campus initiatives that encourage conversation, learning, and connection across race, religion, class, immigration status, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability, and nationalityâhelping to make the University a more inclusive, affirming, and equitable community.\n\nNo. 25: Asbury Park\n\nNamed one of the top 25 best beach destinations in America by Travel & Leisure, the historic shore town is just a 15-minute drive from campus and is home to unique shops, eclectic bars and restaurants, and iconic music venues. Whether our students head to Asbury to enjoyâor perform atâa show at the Stone Pony, take in the historic architecture and iconic art scenes along the boardwalk, or grab a bite to eat with friends, this cultural hub is an unofficial extension of campus that canât be beat.\n\nNo. 26: Entrepreneurship Thrives Here\n\nThereâs a history of innovation at Monmouth, where in the past, business students have brought products ranging from pasta sauce to perfume to market. With the recent launch of a reimagined Center for Entrepreneurship, there is a renewed focus on fostering opportunities for entrepreneurism, innovation, and creativity for all members of the campus community, as well as the surrounding state and regional communities.\n\nNo. 27: Open Ears\n\nEstablished in May 2020 to meet the growing need for counseling services to support people through the COVID-19 pandemic, Monmouthâs award-winning Community Care Telehealth Clinic is still going strong, providing free, online therapeutic support for adults across New Jersey and real-world field internship opportunities for our clinical graduate students.\n\nNo. 28: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Abound\n\nFrom studying the effects of harmful algal blooms to the psychology behind pickup lines, our undergrads collaborate on research projects, coauthor publications in leading journals, and present at regional, national, and international conferences thanks to the research opportunities that are available to them beginning their first year.\n\nNo. 29: Spreading Social Justice\n\nEstablished through a $2 million grant from the Grunin Foundation, Monmouthâs Social Justice Academy fosters equity beyond campus by training regional Kâ12 educators how to model, coach, and teach about social justice in their respective school districts.\n\nNo. 30: The Big Event\n\nA tradition for more than two decades, Monmouthâs largest single-day community service project is a chance for students to give back. Every fall, hundreds of students (as well as faculty and staff members) fan out across the region to help local neighbors, social service agencies, and community organizations through service projects ranging from painting and yard work to community cleanups to working with the elderly.\n\nNo. 31: Our Grammy Partnership\n\nMonmouth was one of the first universities nationwide to partner with the Los Angeles-based Grammy Museum, which provides our students, faculty, and staff access to the museumâs content for educational purposes, curriculum resources, professional development seminars, unique student internship opportunities, and more.\n\nNo. 32: The Linda Grunin Simulation Lab and Learning Center\n\nBuilt in partnership with Monmouth Medical Center with funding from the Jay and Linda Grunin Foundation, this state-of-the-art health care education and training facility enables Monmouthâs nursing, physician assistant, and occupational therapy students to learn in a realistic simulation environment, ensuring theyâre prepared to deliver quality health care to the region once they graduate.\n\nNo. 33: Our Faculty\n\nAward-winning authors. Fulbright recipients. Grant-funded researchers. Our faculty are leaders in their respective fields whom youâll see quoted in the New York Times and Washington Post and spot on the National Geographic channel. But above all, our professors are mentors who are committed first and foremost to their studentsâ success.\n\nNo. 34: The Best View in College Soccer\n\nIs there a more serene setting for soccer than Hesse Field on The Great Lawn? We think not.\n\nNo. 35: Our Picture-Perfect Peristyle\n\nThe picturesque center of campus, Erlanger Memorial Gardens include two unique features: a peristyle, or a row of covered columns that encloses one side, and a âwater organâ fountain that is modeled on the Colonnade at Versailles. Between the unique architectural design and lush landscape, the space is one of the most photographed spots on campus.\n\nNo. 36: Our Floating Classroom\n\nAt 49 feet, the R/V Heidi Lynn Sculthorpe is Monmouthâs largest research vessel, enabling faculty and students to conduct research at sea. With the capacity to take classes of 20 students out on the water, the R/V is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and can sleep up to eight researchers for overnight, around-the-clock operations to support experiential learning and discovery.\n\nNo. 37: Science on Display\n\nAt $40 million, the renovation and expansion of Edison Science Building was the largest academic construction project in University history. Completed in 2018, the state-of-the-art building includes 12 faculty research labs, a tissue culture lab, seven prep labs, nine instrument labs, 15 write-up rooms, a herbarium and vivarium, large exterior windows, and glass walls throughout the interiorâwhich truly puts the work of our faculty and student researchers on display.\n\nNo. 38: Finding Your Niche\n\nWith more than 125 student clubs and organizations to choose from, our students can explore their passion, whether itâs cleaning local beaches, leading a campus governing body, or competing nationally and internationally with the Debate Hawks and Model UN teams against such schools as Georgetown, Cornell, Oxford, and Cambridge.\n\nNo. 39: Hawk TV\n\nFor more than 25 years, Hawk TV has been giving students hands-on, immersive television production experience. Students from any major can crew the stationâs shows, which are broadcast 24/7 from the Monty Television Studio.\n\nNo. 40: WMCX\n\nAs its slogan proclaims, Monmouthâs student-run radio station has been âRockinâ the Shore Since â74ââsave for an 11-month period in the mid-1980s when a fire destroyed the original studio. Originally broadcasting at 88.1 before moving to 88.9 in 1988, the stationâs mix of music, news, and special events is now heard around the world through streaming.\n\nNo. 41: Thereâs an App for Us\n\nLooking for something to do? The Experience Monmouth App, which is available on the Apple and Google Play stores, helps you stay in the know on a variety of campus happenings throughout the year.\n\nNo. 42: Hawk Capital\n\nMonmouthâs student-managed investment fund gives finance students real-world security analysis and portfolio management experience by having them oversee an actual portfolio valued at over $300,000.\n\nNo. 43: Parson CafÃ©\n\nLocated on the first floor of the Great Hall, the new go-to spot for students, faculty, and staff looking to get their caffeine fix serves up local fav Booskerdoo Coffee.\n\nNo. 44: The Kislak Real Estate Institute\n\nLaunched in 2006, the institute was the first credit-bearing academic real estate program in New Jersey, and thanks to a recent $2 million pledge from the Kislak Family Foundation, it is well positioned to continue providing Monmouth students with the skills needed for successful careers in commercial real estate.\n\nNo. 45: OceanFirst Bank Center\n\nLocated in the heart of campus, the Center is home to the bookstore, fitness center, Leon Hess Championsâ Hall, the Athletic Hall of Fame, an indoor track, the Dr. Marilyn A. McNeil Arena, andâfor a brief period in 2013âabout 1,000 area residents who sought shelter there during Superstorm Sandy.\n\nNo. 46: Rare Books\n\nJames Joyce once said, âLife is too short to read a bad book.â Weâre certain heâd approve of the selections in the Libraryâs Rare Books Collection, which includes works from such important writers as John Milton, Virginia Woolf, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, William Shakespeare, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Thereâs even a Paris and Company first edition of Joyceâs own masterpiece, Ulysses.\n\nNo. 47: Tuesday Night Record Club\n\nA book club but for records, this event series is a fan favorite for music lovers who get together throughout the semester to listen to and talk about some of the greatest records of all time.\n\nNo. 48: The Lois Blonder Sculpture Garden\n\nNamed in memory of the 1973 alumna, who was an artist, art collector, and benefactor of the arts, this charming patch of campus features a koi pond, walking paths, a plethora of exotic plants, and a unique cast of sculpted characters including gargoyles, cows, and dinosaurs.\n\nNo. 49: Big Ideas\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. The Dalai Lama. Joyce Carol Oates. Monmouth has a long history of welcoming visionaries and thought leaders whose words have had a lasting impact on our students for generations.\n\nNo. 50: Charming Chimes\n\nHoused in the Plangere Center clock tower, Fellsâ Bellsâdedicated to Monmouth by the late Gilbert Fell, a professor of philosophy and religion studies at Monmouth for 35 years, and his wife, Janet, a longtime employeeâring out across campus hourly.\n\nNo. 51: Our Fight Song\n\nThe man behind Fellsâ Bells also gave Monmouth its fight song. Gilbert Fell came up with the lyrics and tune, but since he couldnât read or write music, he enlisted help from William Alexander Wollman, emeritus associate professor of music, to commit the music to paper. (Wollman, incidentally, had written the previous version of the schoolâs Alma Mater.) Fellâs fight song debuted at the menâs basketball game on Feb. 3, 1997, and has been heard at countless Hawks athletics competitions since then.\n\nNo. 52: The Hawk Family\n\nNumbering more than 57,800 strong, with members living and working in all 50 states and the District of Columbia as well 53 countries around the world, Monmouth alumni help the next generation of Hawks to soar through their generous support, volunteerism, and mentorship. Fly Hawks!\n\nNo. 53: The Sea Sharps\n\nWhether performing on campus or competing at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, Monmouthâs student a cappella group is always pitch perfect.\n\nNo. 54: Learning from the Pros\n\nA full-service production company, Monmouth University Production Services pairs students with award-winning industry professionals to produce high-quality video and digital content for regional and campus clients. Its recent feature-length documentary, Drift, which was featured in the Fall/Winter 2021 issue of this magazine, won Best New Jersey Film at the 2022 Indie Street Film Festival.\n\nNo. 55: The Outlook\n\nThe award-winning student-run newspaper has been the go-to source for news, sports, entertainment, and opinions on campus and world events since the University was founded in 1933, launching countless students into successful journalism careers through the years.\n\nNo. 56: Springfest\n\nHosted annually by SGA, Springfest brings all of our students together before finals week for a day of music, food, games, and activities. Itâs the perfect sendoff for our graduating seniors.\n\nNo. 57: The Wishing Well\n\nLocated just inside the gates of the main entrance to campus, this oft-overlooked, one-story hut houses a wishing well that was designed for the Parsonsâ estate. The gnome-like structure with its concrete, triangular roof is an enduring symbol of well wishes for all who enter our campus.\n\nNo. 58: Our Pet Cemetery\n\nNear the well lie two modest gravestones that mark the eternal resting spots of what were believed to be the Parsonsâ pets: Fluffy, who shuffled off this mortal coil on Nov. 8, 1924, and Girlie, who followed on Nov. 28, 1926.\n\nNo. 59 Our Students\n\nHola. Bonjour. Ni hao. However our students choose to say âHello,â we think itâs pretty cool that they hail from 34 states, one territory, and 31 countries around the world including Costa Rica, France, and China.\n\nNo. 60: How It Started â¦ How Itâs Going\n\nMore than three-quarters of Monmouth seniors complete an internship during their first three years, and within nine months of graduation, 93% of Monmouth graduates are already engaged in their next stepâa job or a graduate program. Thatâs far above the national average.\n\nNo. 61: Kessler Stadium\n\nThe home field for more than half of Monmouthâs student-athletes was made possible by a generous seven-figure gift from two ardent Hawks supporters, Henni Kantor Kessler â68 and her late husband, John â69. If you ask us, thereâs no better place to be on a crisp Saturday afternoon in the fall than sitting in the stands and cheering on the Hawks among a sea of blue and white.\n\nNo. 62: The Center for the Arts\n\nThroughout the year, the Center hosts hundreds of events that enrich and inspire the campus and surrounding communities. Offerings include both the Metropolitan Opera and National Theatre performances live in HD; gallery exhibitions; an array of live music, dance, and theater performances; and lectures from visiting artists and writers.\n\nNo. 63: Homecoming\n\nThe biggest party of the year brings alumni and students together to celebrate their Hawk pride and cheer on the football team. Weâll see you on Sept. 30!\n\nNo. 64: Our Hess Toy Truck Collection\n\nLeon Hess, the visionary entrepreneur and oil magnate for whom Monmouthâs Business School is named, introduced the replica toy version of his companyâs trucks in 1964, and they have been bringing smiles to children (and collectors) every year since. Monmouthâs collection is on the second floor of Bey Hall, home of the Business School.\n\nNo. 65: Hollywood Loves Us\n\nMonmouthâs campus enjoyed starring roles in the 1982 movie Annie and the recent feature film Mirandaâs Victim, and through a little Hollywood magic had a blink-and-youâll-miss-it cameo in the film Blinded by the Light. With Netflix planning to open a major production studio a few miles up the road, we think weâll be seeing movie stars on campus again soon.\n\nNo. 66: Waves of Change\n\nLocated in the Leon Hess Championsâ Hall in OceanFirst Bank Center, âWaves of Change: An Interactive Exhibit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.â memorializes Kingâs visit to campus on Oct. 6, 1966, and includes the lectern and microphone from which he addressed approximately 2,600 Monmouth students, faculty, administrators, and community members in what is now Boylan Gymnasium.\n\nNo. 67: Career Treks\n\nHosted by the Universityâs Career Development office, these daylong excursions enable students to visit companies that employ Monmouth alumniâsuch as Sirius XM/Pandora, Bloomberg L.P., and the New York Giantsâto tour facilities and talk with industry professionals about their respective fields.\n\nNo. 68: Our Alleys, Past and Present\n\nMonmouth is home to the Ciniello Family Bowling Center, a four-lane bowling alley located inside Boylan Gymnasium thatâs used by our womenâs bowling program as well as the larger campus community. But thatâs not the only bowling alley on campus: There are remnants of a two-lane Brunswick bowling alley on the lower level of the Great Hall that was built forâbut reportedly never used byâthe Parsons.\n\nNo. 69: Silent Beauty\n\nAlthough its sounds havenât been heard in decades, the four-manual Aeolian opus 1677 organ that stands at the top of the Great Hallâs central staircase is still a sight to behold. It is reportedly the only remaining residential stereophonic surround sound Aeolian in existence today.\n\nNo. 70: Blue Hawk Records\n\nMonmouthâs student-run record label has been churning out a new album every semester since it was founded a decade ago. This spring marked the release of Exit 22, the labelâs 22nd record. Students from all majors can join to get hands-on experience in all aspects of running a current-day music label, from finding the talent and recording the songs to branding the labelâs artists and marketing and distributing the final product.\n\nNo. 71: Blue and White and Going Green\n\nThe Universityâs solar-powered buildings, refillable water stations that reduce plastic waste, and award-winning broad-based recycling program are part of a concerted effort to make Monmouth a more sustainable institution. Itâs working: The Princeton Reviewâs 2023 Guide to Green Colleges named Monmouth one of the nationâs most environmentally responsible colleges.\n\nNo. 72: Woods Theatre\n\nOnce the carriage house for the Guggenheim estate, the Lauren K. Woods Theatre is today an intimate 140-seat venue housed in the Department of Music and Theatre Arts. Although itâs newly renovated, you can still see remnants of the horse stables in the buildingâs features, such as the theaterâs makeup booths, which were built inside the still-standing solid brass horse stalls where each horseâs name is spelled out in custom mosaic tiles on the back walls.\n\nNo. 73: Monmouth Matches\n\nIn nature, hawks are monogamous, so itâs no surprise that many of our students find their forever partner while pursuing their studies here. In fact, there are more than 1,400 alumni couples, many of whom participated in the first-ever vow renewal for our Monmouth Matches at this yearâs AlumniFest.\n\nNo. 74: Cultivating Town-Gown Relationships\n\nThrough the Virginia A. Cory Community Garden, members of the campus and neighboring communities come together to grow produce that supports local organizations and Monmouth County individuals and families dealing with food insecurity. The garden also hosts festivals, garden-to-table cooking classes, and educational lectures throughout the year.\n\nNo. 75: Our Core Values\n\nThey guide our actions and reflect our aspiration to be a national leader at integrating excellence and access.\n\nÂ» Excellence in Teaching and Learning\n\nÂ» Personal and Professional Integrity\n\nÂ» Caring Campus Characterized by Mutual Respect\n\nÂ» Empowerment of the University Community\n\nÂ» Diversity\n\nÂ» Service\n\nNo. 76: Birds of Prey\n\nItâs not on every college campus that one might spot the actual animal on which the schoolâs mascot is based (weâre looking at you, Princeton). But at Monmouth, itâs easy to spot the hawks that call campus home, as well as other birds of prey (ospreys and bald eagles) that also forage, roost, and nest on our grounds.\n\nNo. 77: Commencement on Campus (Again)\n\nLast spring marked the formal return of Commencement to campus for the first time in nearly 20 years, allowing students to celebrate the capstone event of their college years on the picturesque campus upon which their student experience was anchored.\n\nNo. 78: Winter Ball\n\nFor decades, students have been dressing to the nines and dancing the night away in a decked-out Great Hall at this time-honored tradition. Complete with themed decor, the event is open to all students and includes music, food, drinks, and entertainment.\n\nNo. 79: Shadow Lawn\n\nLong before Monmouth was founded, the area upon which a portion of todayâs campus stands was part of an estate called Shadow Lawn. Named for the long shadows cast by the many tall trees that dotted the park-like grounds, the area remains a lush tree-lined landscape where students gather to study, soak up the sun, and enjoy the special celebrations and gatherings held in the serene setting.\n\nNo. 80: Unique Career Combos\n\nWhat do software engineering and history have in common? At Monmouth, students can combine interdisciplinary studies like these to obtain an accelerated bachelorâs plus masterâs degree that satisfies both their career goals and passions. With more than 200 combinations, our Bachelorâs + Masterâs program is a no-brainer for high-achieving students who want the freedom to explore what inspires them while accelerating their future.\n\nNo. 81: Puppies and Ice Cream â¦\n\n… and goats, oh my! These are just a few of the offerings at the various distress events happening throughout the year. Goat yoga? Check. Need to hug a therapy dog? We got you. College can be stressful, so thereâs never a shortage of funâand often scrumptiousâways to unwind between studies.\n\nNo. 82: All the Pretty Pictures\n\nAnyone seeking a moment of quiet contemplation would be wise to stroll through one of Monmouthâs three art galleries (DiMattio, Rotary Ice House, and Pollak), which feature rotating exhibitions from regional, national, and international artists whose works challenge public perceptions of civil, social, and aesthetic issues affecting society. The University also has an extensive permanent collection, and many of those works have been digitized and can be viewed online.\n\nNo. 83: Our Iconic Gates\n\nA remnant of the Guggenheim estate, the gates were moved down the road from their original location on Cedar Avenue, widened, and now serve as the picturesque entryway to the residential side of campusâa threshold for first-year students arriving on Move-In Day, a welcome sight to returning visitors, and one of the most photographed spots on campus.\n\nNo. 84: Alma Mater\n\nWhen Monmouth attained University status in 1995, it needed a new Alma Mater. After a section of Beethovenâs Ninth Symphony (âOde to Joyâ) was selected for the musical portion, a call went out to the campus community seeking lyrical submissions. The winner: Louis Nappen â90, â92M, whose words were first sung at Foundersâ Day Convocation on Oct. 11, 1995.\n\nNo. 85: Ornate Beauty\n\nItâs everywhere you look on campus, but perhaps nowhere as colorful as when youâre standing below the Great Hallâs 100-foot-long Venetian stained glass skylight, which bathes our iconic building in amber light by day and is lit up by 156 LED bulbs at night.\n\nNo. 86: Monmouth Magazine\n\nSure, weâre a bit biased, but this award-winning magazine has been keeping the Hawk family engaged and connected for more than four decades.\n\nNo. 87: Financial Markets Lab\n\nComplete with a real-time trading room ticker, the Tom Byer â67 & Susie Byer Financial Markets Lab gives our students hands-on experience analyzing market and financial data by employing the same technology and techniques used by Wall Street professionals.\n\nNo. 88: Partying with a Purpose\n\nThe Gala at the Great Hall unites the Monmouth community amidst the grandeur of the Great Hall for a celebration like no other while raising vital support for the Access Fund, which helps fund scholarships for students with unmet financial need. Last yearâs event raised nearly half a million dollars.\n\nNo. 89: Withey Chapel\n\nNamed for a pundit of poultry pathology and composed with materials imported from a 16th-century Tudor abbey, the chapel, which is on the lower level of the Great Hall, originally served as the Parsonsâ âEnglish lounge.â Its namesake, Clarence âWaltâ Withey, worked for them in the 1930s, during which time he saved the coupleâs turkeys from a life-threatening disease. Years later, when Withey returned to what was then Monmouth Junior College to serve as bursar, he restored the space, which had fallen into disrepair after the Parsons were forced to sell the mansion. On Nov. 22, 1969, the chapel was dedicated in Witheyâs honor.\n\nNo. 90: Years of History\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a junior college that was founded to serve as a stepping stone for local students whose families were impacted by the Great Depression to today, a nationally recognized, Division I, private institution dedicated to making an exceptional education accessible to all, Monmouth University revels in the accomplishments of its students, faculty, staff, and alumni and looks with promise to the years ahead.\n\nTell Us What We Missed."
