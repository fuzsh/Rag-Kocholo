        "text": "What is a Raleigh Historic Landmark?\n\nA Raleigh Historic Landmark is the local historic designation of an individual building, structure, site, area, or object that is recognized by an official local ordinance for its historic significance. The Raleigh Historic Development Commission (RHDC) must find the property to be of historical, prehistorical, architectural, archaeological, and/or cultural significance, and to possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or association.\n\nLocal landmark designation is different from being in a local historic overlay district or being listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A property can be designated in multiple ways, but the designation processes are unrelated. The incentives and regulations associated with each type of designation also vary.\n\nThere are many steps to the historic landmark application process. Check out this brochure to learn more.\n\nHistoric Landmark Applications\n\nApplications for Raleigh Historic Landmark designation are reviewed, and recommendations are made by the RHDC. However, the final decision is made by City Council.\n\nApplications are also reviewed by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). Applications include a report on the history of the property as well as photographs.\n\nPending landmark applications are listed below.\n\nCase # Address and Proposed Name Status Contact HLD-0001-2022 2501 Glenwood Avenue\n\nWilliam Henley and Elizabeth Deitrick House At City Council 12/5/23 for adoption of designation ordinance.
