        "text": "Virginia is known as the Mother of Presidents since eight presidents have been born within her borders, the most of any state in the union. You can see many of the presidential sites in Virginia in a week-long road trip, which would be perfect for spring break! Your little presidential scholar will be fascinated with seeing the places where these great men (and their wives) lived, and it will be a hands-on educational trip they won’t forget.\n\nBe sure to download the Virginia History Trails app before your visit!\n\nMany of these historical sites have been reviewed on The History Mom. Links will take you to my reviews and/or the website of the historical destination.\n\nDay 1: Visiting the Original\n\nFly into Washington’s Reagan National Airport and rent a car. Travel just 12.5 miles south of the airport to George Washington’s Mount Vernon. The home of the father of our country, this is one of my favorite sites for families. There is so much to do and see, so plan to spend at least 3 hours here. Read my extensive review to plan your day.\n\nEat: Grab lunch before you leave at the Mount Vernon Inn Restaurant or visit the food court; both are near the shops as you leave Mount Vernon. If you have time, head back to Old Town Alexandria for lunch at one of my favorite spots – Val’s Dockside Grill right on the Potomac River or Southside 815.\n\nDo: Besides Mount Vernon, you can see George Washington’s church in Alexandria (Christ Church Episcopal) and his parish church nearer to Mount Vernon on your drive south (Pohick Church).\n\nKids will love the National Museum of the US Army and the National Museum of the Marine Corps, both of which you’ll pass on the drive south. They’re free and easy to visit with lots of hands-on activities.\n\nAs you drive south, you’ll pass Gunston Hall, home of George Mason who was an architect of the American Revolution and the primary author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Virginia Constitution. His home is a fascinating stop.\n\nContinue one hour south to the historic town of Fredericksburg where you will spend two nights.\n\nStay: Downtown Fredericksburg is full of cute shops and restaurants so make it your home base. The family-friendly option is the downtown Courtyard by Marriott but there are also some historic options as well. Check out the tourism website for more recommendations.\n\nEat: There are some great restaurants in downtown Fredericksburg. We loved our huge pizza slices at the casual Benny Vitali’s. We also love Sedona Taphouse and Capital Ale House, and the local Casey’s looks great too. You can check out the other options here.\n\nDay 2: Fredericksburg Fun\n\nThe little town of Fredericksburg was home to two of our earliest presidents, George Washington and James Monroe. Start your day across the river at George Washington’s childhood home called Ferry Farm. This is where George spent the formative years of his youth and where the apocryphal story about him chopping down a cherry tree was set. It’s a really neat place!\n\nHead back across the river to other Washington sites including his sister’s home (Kenmore) and his mother’s home (Mary Washington House).\n\nIn the afternoon, visit the James Monroe Museum where you can see many items owned by President Monroe and his wife, Elizabeth. Kids will especially love seeing the clothes they wore during their time in France representing the new United States of America!\n\nDo: If you are a Civil War enthusiast, take the time to see part of the Fredericksburg National Military Park (I recommend taking in the visitor center and walking the Sunken Road.\n\nFor non-history fun, visit Funland, a kids’ dream of rides and games.\n\nEat: There are a ton of restaurants near Funland including one of our favorite chains, BJ’s.\n\nDay 3: Birthplace of Presidents\n\nCheck out of the hotel and drive to Virginia’s Northern Neck, the area of land between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. During colonial times, this was called the “Athens of the New World” since it had so many landed gentry interested in culture and education. No wonder it’s the birthplace of three of our country’s first five presidents! Check out my extensive review of these sites here.\n\nDrive about one hour east of Fredericksburg to the George Washington Birthplace National Monument. This lovely site along the Potomac River gives you a greater appreciation for Washington’s desire to remain at Mount Vernon. It’s a great place for a short hike!\n\nGet back in the car and drive just 15 minutes to the James Monroe Birthplace Park and Museum. The foundation has recreated President Monroe’s childhood home on the site, and it has a fun nature walk as well.\n\nEat: Head into Colonial Beach for a quick lunch on the water. We liked our lunch at Docksides, but there are many options.\n\nDrive just thirty minutes south to the birthplace of our nation’s fourth president, James Madison. His birthplace home is no longer standing, but you can visit Belle Grove, a beautiful bed and breakfast now on the site. While the home is different from Madison’s time, the view across the river is the same.\n\nDo: Just south of Belle Grove on Route 301 are several historical markers about John Wilkes Booth’s escape and capture which happened nearby.\n\nDrive one hour south to Richmond where you’ll spend one night.\n\nStay: I love the historic Jefferson hotel, but it’s definitely a splurge! For a more family-friendly option, check out The Graduate or the Hilton.\n\nDo: Richmond has tons of fun things to do outside of history. Kids will like stopping by the Kings Dominion theme park as you drive down I-95. Or learning about science at the amazing Science Museum of Virginia or visiting the animals at Maymont.\n\nEat: For dinner, I recommend Tarrant’s Cafe or Bar Solita, both walking distance from the downtown hotels.\n\nDay 4: Journey along the James\n\nStart your morning at the picturesque Hollywood Cemetery where you can visit the graves of Presidents James Monroe and John Tyler along with their first ladies. Kids will love wandering its paths and the early morning hours are the perfect time to view the roaring James as it runs past the cemetery, giving it a tranquil atmosphere.\n\nDrive 45 minutes east to two presidential plantations along the James River, Berkeley Plantation and Sherwood Forest. I recommend touring Berkeley, the birthplace of President William Henry Harrison and a site full of important colonial and Civil War history as well. John Tyler’s Sherwood Forest is a good place to see just the grounds with the house tours being 1.5 -2 hours long! There was a little boy on my tour, however, and he loved all of the details, but it may be a bit too much for most kids. Visit the grounds and especially the pet cemetery!\n\nEat: Have a lovely lunch at Upper Shirley Vineyards. Sit outside along the James if it’s a nice day!\n\nDo: If you have an extra day (or two or three!), add in a visit to the Historic Triangle, just a 30 minute drive from Sherwood Forest. See my Virginia Road Trip itinerary for more details on this option!\n\nIf you have a specific interest in first ladies, nearby New Kent County has many Martha Washington sites (see this review for more details). You can also visit the grave of Letitia Tyler, who died as first lady in the White House, near Sherwood Forest (see my visit reviewed here).\n\nDrive one hour west to Historic Tuckahoe to see where Thomas Jefferson went to school! It’s a lovely home, and the gardens are beautiful, especially in the spring.\n\nContinue west one hour to Charlottesville, the stomping ground of three presidents. Note that Charlottesville is a college town so be sure to check the University of Virginia’s academic calendar to avoid graduations and other events.\n\nStay: Get a hotel for two nights in Charlottesville with its plethora of options. A luxurious child-friendly resort is the Boar’s Head Resort. The Graduate is also a good option.\n\nEat: Have dinner downtown along the pedestrian mall, checking out the fun toy store and New Dominion Bookshop. We love the burgers at Jack Brown’s or Citizen.\n\nDay 5: Land of Jefferson\n\nCharlottesville is best known for being the land of Thomas Jefferson. He was born here and built his masterpiece plantation, Monticello, on a mountain top overlooking the town. It is a must-see place, and you need to buy your tickets in advance to ensure a tour. Plan to spend 2-3 hours at Monticello, so I recommend starting out your day here.\n\nEat: Have lunch at the next-door Michie Tavern. It’s a home cooking restaurant set in an authentic 18th century tavern. It’s very atmospheric!\n\nAfter lunch, drive just ten minutes up the mountain to James Monroe’s Highland. If you can’t catch a tour of the house (which isn’t the Monroe house), the grounds are worth visiting.\n\nIf you’re up for a 1.5 hour drive and want to be a Jefferson completist, visit Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest, his retreat in the country. Or stay closer to home and walk around the university and visit the famous Rotunda and Jefferson statue.\n\nEat: Head back to the hotel for dinner and pool time.\n\nDay 6: From the War of 1812 to WWI\n\nCheck out of the hotel and drive 45 minutes west to the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum in Staunton, his hometown. This is one of the coolest presidential museums for kids with its WWI trench exhibit and presidential car!\n\nEat: Have lunch in quaint downtown Staunton. It’s such an adorable town! There is a downtown pedestrian walk with cute shops and restaurants. Check out this list for options or ask for a recommendation at the museum.\n\nDo: Shakespeare enthusiasts will want to take a peek at the American Shakespeare Center with its recreated Shakespearean theatre.\n\nDrive 1.5 hours east to the rolling hills of Orange County which two presidents called home. James Madison lived here most of his life and his plantation, Montpelier, is a must-see. There is also the small but informative James Madison Museum dedicated to him. The museum also has a small display on the other Orange County president, Zachary Taylor, who was born here in 1748.\n\nStay: Orange is one of the most beautiful places in Virginia, especially in the spring and fall. The historic Inn at Willow Grove is one of my favorite hotels in Virginia, and it would make a great place to spend your last night in the Old Dominion. Reserve one of the cottages for your family!\n\nEat: Vintage Restaurant at the Inn at Willow Grove is excellent for older kids. For a more casual dinner, I recommend driving just a short distance down Route 15 to The BBQ Exchange in quaint Gordonsville for an unforgettable BBQ experience.\n\nAnother option: First Lady enthusiasts will love to visit the Edith Bolling Wilson Birthplace Museum in Wytheville (2.5 hours southwest of Staunton). It’s out of the way but an option, especially if you don’t want to head back to Washington to fly home. You could visit it by spending an additional night in Charlottesville and flying out of there or Richmond.\n\nDay 7: Back to the Seat of Power\n\nFor your last day, head back to Washington, DC (a 1.5 hour drive from Orange). Take your pick of presidential sites here. You could spend another week visiting all of these!\n\nIf you only have one day, I’d stick to the National Mall, seeing the monuments and the American History Museum while getting an iconic family picture in front of the White House. With two days, add on Ford’s Theatre and Arlington Cemetery. To get around easily, I recommend taking a hop on/hop off trolley that kids love! See my Washington guide for suggestions.\n\nWhite House (tickets needed) and its visitor center (no tickets required)\n\nNational Museum of American History – extensive collection of presidential and first lady historical artifacts\n\nNational Mall Monuments and Memorials – many presidents are honored here\n\nNational Portrait Gallery – paintings of each president and some first ladies\n\nPresident Lincoln’s Cottage (my favorite hidden gem!)\n\nFord’s Theatre – my favorite tour in Washington!\n\nOctagon Museum – home to President Madison and Dolley after the White House burned in the War of 1812\n\nWilson House Museum – where President Wilson lived after the presidency\n\nWashington National Cathedral – where Woodrow and Edith Wilson are buried\n\nArlington National Cemetery – where Presidents Taft and Kennedy are buried\n\nMeridian Hill Park – site of President John Quincy Adams’ home after the presidency\n\nFirst Lady specific sites:\n\nDolley Madison Historical Sites\n\nElizabeth Monroe Historical Sites\n\nLouisa Catherine Adams Historical Sites\n\nDay 8: Fly home!\n\nSpend more time in the nation’s capital where there are monuments to many presidents or head home!\n\nThis covers all of the Virginia presidents and leaves just two remote presidential sites to be seen (the 4-mile hike in Shenandoah National Park to President Hoover’s Rapidan Camp and Theodore Roosevelt’s retreat, Pine Knot, open only by appointment). If you have a family that loves to hike, these would make great additions to your stay in Charlottesville above.\n\nThis is a jam-packed itinerary but one that presidential history enthusiasts will love! Kids will find the sites fascinating as well, especially if you throw in some of the fun activities mentioned. You could even plan a similar itinerary in your own home state – check out my list of presidential and first lady sites to create your own presidential road trip!\n\nHelpful hints:\n\nWeather: Virginia has four full seasons. Summer can be very HOT, especially in the Northern Neck and Richmond. Drink lots of water, and plan for pool time at the hotel!\n\nTraffic: Traffic shouldn’t be a huge problem in Richmond, Charlottesville, or Staunton. The worst traffic will be on I-95 between Washington, DC and Richmond. It can get very crowded so plan accordingly. Alternate options are Routes 301 and 15.\n\nCrowds: Mount Vernon and Monticello are the main places where you will run into crowds. Reserve tickets in advance and plan accordingly. I recommend getting the first tour of the morning before the large crowds.\n\nTransportation: Reagan National Airport is fairly easy to navigate. To do this tour, you will need a car.\n\nTo prepare for your trip, be sure to check out our local NBC station’s podcast, How We Got Here. It’s fabulous and would be a perfect listen on this road trip!\n\nBooks to Read:\n\nI’ve compiled lists of my favorite books about Virginia and presidential history at my Bookshop.org shop (affiliate links).\n\nAll links below are Amazon affiliate links.\n\nAdults/Young Adults:\n\nVirginia Presidents: A History & Guide\n\nThe Virginia Dynasty: Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation\n\nPatriot Hearts: A Novel of the Founding Mothers\n\nGeorge Washington’s Mount Vernon : At Home in Revolutionary America\n\nMount Vernon Love Story: A Novel of George and Martha Washington\n\nThomas Jefferson: Architect: The Built Legacy of Our Third President\n\nMonticello: A Daughter and Her Father\n\nJames Madison’s Montpelier: Home of the Father of the Constitution\n\nJames Monroe: A Life\n\nGallop Toward the Sun: Tecumseh and William Henry Harrison’s Struggle for the Destiny of a Nation\n\nJohn Tyler, the Accidental President\n\nZachary Taylor: The American Presidents Series: The 12th President, 1849-1850\n\nWilson\n\nThe President’s Wife: A Novel\n\nMiddle Grade:\n\nVirginia is for Adventurers\n\nSpies at Mount Vernon (The Virginia Mysteries Book 7)\n\nEscape from Monticello (The Virginia Mysteries Book 8)\n\nThe Great Little Madison\n\nDolley Madison and the War of 1812: America’s First Lady\n\nWho Was Woodrow Wilson?\n\nPicture Books:\n\nThis Is The House George Built!
