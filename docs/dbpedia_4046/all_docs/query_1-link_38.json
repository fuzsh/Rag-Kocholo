        "text": "We hope you plan to visit our school!\n\nFew American universities are located in a region as historically and culturally diverse as the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Just steps from the monumental civic architecture of our nation’s capital and a short distance from the historically rich urbanism of Baltimore and Annapolis, the University of Maryland’s School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation offers unparalleled opportunities for study, exploration, and practice.\n\nThe School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation is located only seven miles from downtown Washington, D.C. Considered one of the most architecturally rich cities in the world, Washington, D.C. is a vibrant, living laboratory for the study of architecture, urbanism, and historic preservation. The city’s monumental architecture, museums, libraries, theatres, eclectic neighborhoods, and cultural institutions, all easily accessible by Metrorail or bus, are unlike anywhere in the United States. Close partnerships with government agencies, organizations, and firms bring expertise to our programs while providing hands-on experiences outside of the classroom.\n\nNearby Baltimore's mix of high-rise buildings and unique neighborhoods is an example of the quintessential American city, with perhaps the largest collection of buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the United States. Baltimore's diverse economic and social fabric offers essential case studies in sustainability, gentrification, and revitalization.\n\nMaryland's capital city, Annapolis, features pristine examples of the red-brick Colonial, Victorian, and Georgian-style buildings that defined 18th- and 19th-century architecture. With its preserved cobblestone streets and historic city center, Annapolis is the epicenter of the U.S. historic preservation movement.\n\nThe University of Maryland’s mid-Atlantic location offers close proximity to some of the country’s best national parks, hundreds of miles of coastline, historic gems, and bustling cities. Within a few hours drive, students can explore the small towns of Maryland's Eastern Shore, the rugged landscape of Western Maryland and Appalachia, the concrete urbanism of Philadelphia and New York, and the architectural masterpieces of Thomas Jefferson, Frank Lloyd Wright, Paul Cret, and Louis Kahn.\n\nOur Location:\n\nSchool of Architecture, Planning and Preservation\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\n3835 Campus Drive\n\nArchitecture Building #145\n\nCollege Park, MD 20742\n\nPhone: (301) 405-8000\n\nFax: (301) 314-9583\n\nThe School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation is located on the western edge of the University of Maryland at the intersection of Mowatt Lane and Campus Drive.
