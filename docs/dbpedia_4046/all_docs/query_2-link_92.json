Before you head out the door, don’t forget to pack a pen and small notebook, your questions, and a bag to hold all the college brochures and information you will collect.\n\nREGISTER FOR A BARCODE AT STRIVEFAIR.COM.\n\nSo you can easily provide your information to the colleges you meet at the fair. When you register, you get a barcode that colleges can scan at the fair to get your information.

Check out the \"Questions to Ask College Reps\" for suggested questions to ask college reps if you're stumped! After you visit a college’s booth, take a few minutes to write down what you’ve learned. Try to leave time at the end just to browse through some of the booths that you didn’t get to—you can stumble upon a great college that you hadn’t previously considered.\n\nQUESTIONS TO ASK COLLEGE REPS\n\nAFTER THE FAIR:\n\nHere are some post-fair dos and don'ts to keep you on track:\n\nDo: Relax when you get home.
