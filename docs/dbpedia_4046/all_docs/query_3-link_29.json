        "text": "The LSU Campus Mounds are among the oldest human-made edifices in the Americas. They were here long before LSU existed and were a major point of interest in the early 1900s for planners seeking a perfect setting for an expanded LSU campus.\n\nThe reasons for that drawing power are numerous. The mounds are beautiful, culturally significant, mysterious, and ancient – archaeological treasures that have stood proudly for thousands of years.\n\nOur limited understanding of the mounds comes from both scientific research and Native American traditions and accounts handed down over generations. Excavations have revealed the northern mound is composed of hard clay dirt, while the southern mound is more porous. A few artifacts have been discovered in the mounds, including a small pebble that was used as a tool, found during an excavation in 1985.\n\nAlso cloaked in mystery are the Native American builders of these sacred structures. Experts believe the hunter-gatherers who constructed the mounds met there periodically for ceremonial activities and secular events. Originally built at a point where the Mississippi River made a turn to the south, the mounds would've been a prominent landmark to anyone traveling on the river. The river has since shifted, but the mounds’ landmark status remains strong.\n\nIn 1918, in search of a more spacious campus than the downtown location, LSU officials began the process of acquiring land south of downtown, settling on the former Williams tract, also known as Gartness.\n\nOn May 22 of that year, to solidify public support, lawmakers and other prominent leaders were invited to a barbecue at the site of a unique feature on the property, two side-by-side Native American mounds.\n\nThe eventual purchase of the site initiated the process of planning the new campus. While the design revolved around a classroom core composed chiefly of two intersecting quadrangles, planners also took great care to highlight the mounds, which were left untouched out of respect and a desire to preserve the intriguing structures.\n\nLater, while helping plan a portion of the campus, Louisiana Gov. Huey P. Long, who served from 1928 to 1932, circled the mounds on a map, labeling the area as an \"Indian Reservation\" to emphasize his insistence that they be protected.\n\nOver the years, as the campus grew beyond that original design, those early wishes have been respected. The mounds have maintained their prominent presence as a testament to the rich cultural past of the site.\n\nThe mounds were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\n\nMuch has been learned about the mounds over years of research and exploration. But many mysteries remain.\n\nThe first known excavation of the site, conducted by \"relic hunters\" around 1940, uncovered no artifacts that could shine light on the mounds' origins. At that time, LSU geologists estimated the mounds to be from 800 to 1,000 years old and likely used as a burial ground.\n\nIn 1982, campus scientists conducted the university's first in-depth study of the mounds. They took six core samples to try to date the mounds and analyze the make-up of the soil deep within. That group initially estimated the mounds' age to be about 2,000 years old.\n\nFurther core sampling in 1985 and 2009 produced no evidence to suggest the site was a burial ground, and it helped archaeologists revise the mounds' estimated age to 5,500 to 6,200 years old.\n\nHowever, new research by LSU geology professor Brooks Ellwood, based on his analysis of the material taken from within the mounds in 2009, has found evidence that led him to conclude the mounds are substantially older than previously thought, some parts as much as 11,000 years old, which would make the mounds the oldest known human-made structures in the Americas.\n\nAs LSU was considering the purchase of a plot of land for an expanded campus, people were already gravitating to the new location's most distinctive feature, the pair of Native American mounds rising from the property. Photos from an on-site barbecue in 1918 to promote the purchase show a large number of attendees lounging on the mounds.\n\nWhat was happening then continued to happen for decades to come as students, sports fans, and other members of the community made the mounds their personal playground, study space, or preferred vantage point for a view of the campus.\n\nFor years, little thought was given to the sacred aspects of the mounds, as well as the fragile nature of the ancient structures. Gathering, tailgating, sliding, sledding, and simply sitting on the mounds for so many years took a toll.\n\nAnd there were tragic consequences as well. In two separate incidents in the 1980s, students were struck by vehicles driving over the mounds, fatally injuring one student and leaving another with serious injuries. Those incidents led to the installation of vehicle barriers, but people still came to climb and frolic on the mounds.\n\nIn recent years, fences, landscaping, and posted rules have been used in attempts to keep people off the mounds, with various levels of success. The current effort to preserve the mounds will use these tools, along with education and understanding, to change this mindset and give the mounds the respect and protections they deserve."
