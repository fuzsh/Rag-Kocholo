        "text": "Nashville is one of the nation’s most-visited cities and ranks among the top destinations for music fans. There’s so much to see and do, planning a trip can frankly get a little overwhelming. Music City has a whole array of places to visit based on what you’re interested in doing. Here are our top picks for places you need to see on your next visit to Nashville.\n\nMust-Hear Musical Destinations\n\nMusic City overflows with places to enjoy music. Whether it’s attending a live performance or learning about music history, Nashville is the place to enjoy music of all genres. While there are many places to go, here are some of our favorite music destinations in the city.\n\nRyman Auditorium\n\nToday, Ryman Auditorium is known as one of the most famous music venues in the country, but did you know it wasn’t originally built for concerts at all? In fact, the Ryman was constructed in 1892 as a church called the Union Gospel Tabernacle. Captain Tom Ryman had the church constructed after he attended a Christian tent revival in downtown Nashville that inspired him.\n\nThe tabernacle opened its doors and quickly established itself as not only a place of worship but a cultural epicenter for the city. It hosted famous performers and lecturers, including Susan B. Anthony and Booker T. Washington, and even played a role in the Fisk Jubilee Singers’ rise to fame. When Captain Ryman died in 1904, the Union Gospel Tabernacle was renamed Ryman Auditorium in his honor.\n\nIn 1943, the Grand Ole Opry relocated to the Ryman from its former home in War Memorial Auditorium earning the Ryman a nickname that has stuck to this day: The Mother Church. The Grand Ole Opry was performed live at the Ryman until 1974, when the show moved to its current home, the Grand Ole Opry house.\n\nToday, the Ryman is a top destination for performers and music fans of all genres. The original church pews, stained-glass windows, and architectural acoustics make it a one-of-a-kind venue to take in a concert.\n\nAddress: 116 5th Ave N, Nashville, TN 37219\n\nWebsite: Ryman.com\n\nGrand Ole Opry\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry is the home to the famed Grand Ole Opry radio show – the longest-running radio show in the world.

Opry members include country greats, like Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, and Bill Anderson, as well as a younger generation, like Kelsea Ballerini and Josh Turner. To be inducted as an Opry member, an artist must be invited by a current member based on the artist’s career accomplishments and commitment. There are only 200 artists and groups throughout history who’ve been named Opry members.\n\nThe Opry House is open for concerts and tours, including a guided backstage tour that gives you a behind-the-scenes peek at the venue’s dressing rooms and stage. It’s a must-see for any country music fan.
