        "text": "May was National Historic Preservation Month!\n\nHistoric Preservation Month is celebrated annually during the month of May across the country. Public agencies and nonprofits use the month of May to celebrate and promote historic buildings, sites, landscapes, and neighborhoods. McMinnville’s extensive inventory, which includes numerous buildings and sites, provides ample opportunity to highlight the important historic resources that exist throughout the city. The McMinnville Downtown Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and includes many of the most prominent historic buildings in McMinnville, however, a vast majority of our historic resources are located in other historic areas of the city and include numerous resources that date as far back as 1853!\n\nFirst established and observed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1973, this nonprofit organization is dedicated to protecting America’s historic buildings, landscapes, and neighborhoods. The City’s Historic Landmarks Committee is the appointed body that is involved in the practice of historic preservation and serves as the managing body for the City’s Historic Resources Inventory including the review or alterations to existing historic landmarks. The City's Historic Resources Inventory is a locally adopted list of protected structures, buildings, and sites.\n\nBeginning in May, and throughout the summer months, we hope to highlight some of our favorite historic sites and promote their important (and interesting) historic significance. You will see posters distributed throughout the town and located on the signs of identified properties. Check back here for access to historic (and current) photos, as well as the stories that these resources tell of our incredible City!\n\nThank you to everyone for your encouragement and support of the Uncover McMinnville program. We are hopeful to secure future grants to bring you all more exciting programs celebrating the history of the city!"
