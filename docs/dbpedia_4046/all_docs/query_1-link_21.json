Within each community, historic districts are listed first in alphabetical order. Districts are followed by a list of individually listed properties arranged alphabetically by their street address. The date marks when the property was listed in the National Register. The NHL date marks when the property was named a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe list is not final nor absolute. You can also look up National Register properties in Rhode Island by searching the RI-Historic Property Search. The Search tool lists every address in National Register Historic Districts. For more information about listings, contact Joanna Doherty."
