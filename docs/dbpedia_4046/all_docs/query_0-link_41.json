In keeping with the lyrics he often sang in life, “Now I want to bury my body, ‘way down in Jackson, Tennessee,” Williamson’s body was conveyed to the city of his birth. For forty-two years, his body rested in an unmarked grave, sheltered by the deep shadows of the Jackson woods and covered with a verdant blanket of kudzu. In 1990, RCA Records, whose corporate history includes the Bluebird and Victor labels on which Williamson became famous, presented a rose granite gravestone to mark the resting place of the forgotten blues great.\n\nBritton Lane Battlefield\n\n4707 Steam Mill Ferry Road, Medon\n\nOn September 1, 1862,Confederate Gen.

The community gathered here at the church to watch the new soldiers muster before they left for Camp Beauregard in nearby Jackson.\n\nOn the eve of the Battle of Britton Lane on August 31, 1862, the 20th and 30th Illinois Infantry Regiments commanded by Col. Elias S. Dennis camped in a grove of mulberry trees near the church. After the battle, Confederate Gen. Frank C. Armstrong’s cavalry brigade spent the night in Denmark on its return south. The Confederates kept their prisoners on the church’s second floor, which was a Masonic Lodge. Inscriptions believed to have been written by these Federal soldiers can still be seen along the bottoms of the walls.\n\nBy 1863, the Union army controlled much of West Tennessee. Local Confederates returning to Denmark on leave had to be careful. During one Sunday service here, a Federal patrol burst into the church and two visiting Confederates had to hide under their girlfriends’ hoop skirts to avoid capture.\n\nhttps://www.tnvacation.com/local/denmark-denmark-presbyterian-church\n\nNew Southern Hotel\n\n112 East Baltimore Street\n\nThe New Southern Hotel was built in 1927 and was considered not only a showplace for downtown Jackson, but also the center of social life for the area.

He served five terms in the state senate, one term in Congress, and was an influential member of the 1835 constitutional convention. Despite losing his leg, he never lost his sense of humor. It was an essential ingredient in his political writings and speeches, sprinkled with Biblical references and selections from Aesop’s Fables. It brought him personal popularity in courtrooms and on the campaign trail, where he never lost a race for public office.\n\nCivil War battlefield-Here on December 19, 1862, Confederate forces under the command of General Nathan B. Forest fought Union forces commanded by Colonel Adolph Englemann. Approximately 1,500 men were engaged in the four hour battle.

The exact number of casualties is unknown, but it is estimated that Confederate losses were 65 killed, wounded, or missing. Federal losses were 2 killed and 6 wounded. Except for the paving of Cotton Grove Road, all of the natural features, and the road itself, remain unchanged from the time the battle occurred in 1862.\n\nhttps://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/salem-cemetery-battlefield\n\nSkirmish at Carroll Station (Civil War battle)\n\nAshport Road & Cooper Anderson Road\n\nHere, on the bitterly cold morning of December 19, 1862, while General N.
