        "text": "The University of Tennessee Southern (UT Southern) is thrilled to announce and welcome Dr. Linda C. Martin as Interim Chancellor beginning July 1, 2022.\n\nDr. Martin joins UT Southern as an expert leader and accomplished innovator in higher education with an esteemed career that stretches beyond 35 years. She earned her undergraduate degree in Animal Science from The Ohio State University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Animal Breeding and Genetics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University and Colorado State University, respectively.\n\nPrior to her most recent position as Vice President of Academic Affairs and Student Success at The University of Tennessee, Dr. Martin served as the Associate Dean and Director of Academic Affairs in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences at Ohio State University (2007-2017) and Assistant Dean for Academic Programs in the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University (2002-2007) following 15 years of successful teaching and advising at Kansas State University.\n\nDuring her 10 years of service at Ohio State University, Dr. Martin was named the Sanford G. Price and Isabelle P. Barbee Chair in Teaching, Learning, and Advising in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) and was appointed Director of the University’s Second-year Transformational Experience Program. Her responsibilities at Ohio State included providing leadership for CFAES student recruitment, student development, faculty development, teaching excellence, academic advising, first-year experience, study abroad, undergraduate research, multicultural student services, and career development. Under her leadership, undergraduate enrollment in CFAES grew by over 25%; undergraduate participation in study abroad reached nearly 50%; and the 4-yr graduation rate has climbed to over 70%.\n\nAt Oklahoma State, she provided leadership for faculty development in the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (CASNR), worked with the CASNR Effective Teaching Committee to enhance teaching effectiveness college-wide, and served in an advisory role to the OSU Institute for Teaching and Learning Excellence.\n\nIn her Vice President role, Dr. Martin works closely with campus chief academic and student affairs officers to oversee academic and student affairs for the UT System. She coordinates the development of academic strategic plans, academic policy, new academic programs, admission and retention standards, faculty handbook revisions, and system-wide student success efforts. Most recently (2021-22), Dr. Martin served as the Interim Senior Vice Chancellor and Senior Vice President of the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture.\n\nThroughout her career, Dr. Martin has received over 25 different colleges, regional and national awards for teaching excellence, including the North American Colleges and Teachers of Agriculture Distinguished Educator Award (2007), American Society of Animal Science Distinguished Teacher Award (2006), North American Colleges and Teachers of Agriculture (NACTA) Teaching Award of Excellence (2001); and the National USDA Excellence in College and University Teaching in Food and Agriculture Sciences Award (1998). She is also, with distinction, the first woman inducted into The Ohio State University Animal Science Hall of Fame (2005).\n\nDr. Martin will begin her role as the Interim Chancellor of UT Southern on the one-year anniversary of the historic acquisition that resulted in the UT System’s newest undergraduate institution. Having overcome many challenges and welcomed many changes over the last two years, UT Southern laid a strong foundation for a brilliant future for the students, the community, and beyond. Coming in with exceptional strengths and experience, Dr. Martin’s addition to the UT Southern campus will enforce this foundation and enhance UT Southern’ goals and values, bringing the institution to new heights.\n\nThe University of Tennessee Southern does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, handicap, or veteran status in the provision of educational opportunities or employment opportunities and benefits.\n\nThe University of Tennessee Southern, formally known as Martin Methodist College, was originally named after Thomas Martin, who established a school for girls in Giles County by giving the original endowing gift of $30,000 through a provision in his will in 1870. His legacy was the fulfillment of a dream of his daughter Victoria who, before her death at the age of twenty, requested that her father establish such a school for young women.\n\nThomas Martin, the son of a Methodist minister, was born in 1799 and moved to Pulaski, Tennessee, while he was a young man. He possessed unusual business acumen and made his mark in the business world early in life, becoming a millionaire. Martin was a friend of President James K. Polk of nearby Columbia, Tennessee, and was once offered the position of United States Treasurer. He served as president of the Nashville and Decatur Railroad, a local savings bank president, an influential political figure in the region, and a loyal member of the Methodist Church in Pulaski.\n\nThe college moved to its current location in 1875 on seven acres purchased from Governor John C. Brown for $16,000. For many years the college was operated as a four-year boarding college for women, with an elementary division for the children and young people of Pulaski. Many persons of influence are numbered among its illustrious graduates. Its first building stood near the site of Martin Hall. As the college grew, new facilities were added, and the campus site expanded.\n\nIn 1908, an agreement was reached whereby the Board of Trustees transferred the property of the college into the hands of the Tennessee Conference of The Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The name was changed from Martin Female College to Martin College, and financial support for the institution and its influence began to increase. In 1938, the College became coeducational. The number of male students has grown until the student body shows a ratio of approximately half women and half men. As the College grew, the adjoining property was purchased and added to the campus.\n\nIn 1983, the College constructed the Robert E. Curry Christian Life Center from the proceeds of a capital funds campaign. UT Southern College students, faculty, and staff, as well as persons from the community and the churches of the Tennessee Conference, use the center.\n\nIn April 1986, the Board of Trustees added the word “Methodist” to the college’s name. This addition affirms Martin’s strong ties to The United Methodist Church and clearly states the values of the Wesleyan tradition, which undergird the college.\n\nMartin Methodist College became a four-year institution beginning with the 1993-94 academic year. The decision by the Board of Trustees to become a baccalaureate-degree granting institution was one of the most far-reaching decisions in the history of the school. It was implemented to expand and enhance the school’s opportunities to achieve its objectives.\n\nIn 1998, the college purchased 44 acres 1.5 miles east of the main campus and completed the East Campus Athletic Facility construction in 2013. The East Campus is the home for UT Southern’s Men and Women’s Soccer, Baseball, and Softball programs. The complex is home to Grissom Pitch, the Firehawk Men and Women’s Soccer teams, and the Carylon and JB Baker Practice Field, used by the soccer teams and other intramural sports.\n\nIn January 1999, the Board of Trustees of Martin Methodist College made the momentous decision to seek growth in the size of the student body to at least 1,000 students. This decision set into motion a 10-year plan, Martin 2010, necessary to accommodate the projected 2010 enrollment of 1,000-1,200 students. This plan includes the ability to offer expanded programs and services for students.\n\nIn April 1999, the Center for Church Leadership was established by Martin Methodist College as part of its mission as a church-related institution of higher education. The center assists in the training and support of lay and professional church leaders and has begun to provide an ambitious level of service to the region’s churches.\n\nThe college purchased the stately antebellum home of former Governor John C. Brown in 1995. The property is located on the east side of the campus adjacent to the men’s dormitory. Damaged by age, fire, and winds, the home has been removed from the property. The College has reconstructed the historic home, now known as Herbert and Grace Grissom Colonial Hall, using as much of the original material from the old structure as possible. The building houses the administrative offices, reception and meeting rooms, and the Senator Ross Bass Archives.\n\nA new chapter began in 2021. Martin Methodist College merged with the University of Tennessee Systems and became The University of Tennessee Southern.

Any student, employee, or job applicant with a complaint or grievance regarding this matter should contact the Office of Academic Affairs.\n\nThe provisions of this catalog are not to be regarded as an irrevocable contract between The University of Tennessee Southern and the student. The College reserves the right to change any provision or requirement in the catalog at any time. A corrected copy for changes and/or the 2023-2024 catalog is in the online version. All changes will be made by October 1, 2024."
