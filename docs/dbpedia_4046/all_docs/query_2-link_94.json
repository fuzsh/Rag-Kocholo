        "text": "JACKSON, Tenn. (July 28, 2021) – Lane College has been approved by the Tennessee State Board of Education as an Educator Preparation Provider (EPP).\n\nAspiring Tennessee educators must complete an approved educator preparation program and Lane’s new program includes a variety of pathways. Each pathway includes student teaching, internships, and job-embedded clinical practice.\n\n“Lane has a long history of creating outstanding teachers and our approval as an EPP is the result of a community of scholars who are committed to educational leadership,” said Dr. Cell Waller, Director of Teacher Education at Lane. “This accomplishment comes as the result of our entire Lane community being focused on our goal to have new educators prepared on day one to serve the needs of the State of Tennessee and school districts across the nation.”\n\n“We only have to look at each of our own lives to understand the transformative power that a teacher can have,” said the Reverend Daryll Coleman, Vice President of Academic Affairs. “Lane College is committed to recruiting, supporting and training teachers who will continue to make that noble and cherished difference in the lives of others.”\n\nIn addition to Lane’s new approval as an EPP for prospective teachers, the college offers over a hundred career-ready pathways and credentials to help students succeed"
