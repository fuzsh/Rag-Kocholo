Additionally, Middle College is a way for high school students to earn a degree and a diploma at the same time.\n\nIf you prefer to go to class online, we offer that too. Providing convenient access to higher learning is one of our most important missions.\n\nTransfer ready\n\nRoane State's graduates have transferred to colleges and universities in almost every state, and are well-known for being academically prepared for transfer.\n\nWhether you want to transfer in-state to colleges such as Tennessee Tech or the University of Tennessee – or even venture out-of-state to places such as Purdue or Virginia – our exceptional faculty will help you succeed.\n\nRoane State: a place for growth\n\nâI was so alive those three weeks. My soul... the freedom... I just felt like I was really living, not just existing.â\n\nHaley Russell, on the\n\nSouthwest Field Trip Course\n\nCourse Numbers: SSC 211 and MSC 261\n\nVisit the SWFT website!\n\nRoane State: a place for results\n\nâI was beyond shocked when my name was called. Being so young, and the only Middle College student up on stage, I felt as if I didnât have a chance. Itâs an honor to be presented this award because of how hard I worked. I chose pharmacy to help others through my prior experiences. I will always be grateful for the opportunities Middle College allowed me. In two years, Iâve obtained over 80 hours to get my prerequisites for pharmacy.â\n\nLeah Cobble\n\nWinner of the Presidentâs Award, Roane Stateâs highest student honor\n\nRead more about Leah"
