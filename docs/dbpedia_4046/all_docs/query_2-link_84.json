        "text": "The Chickasaws lived close to nature, but they were by no means a primitive people. Law and religion governed them, and they lived in highly developed towns. Each family had a summer home that kept them cool and a winter home that stayed incredibly warm. The women farmed extensively and created a highly developed system called “three sister farming” for growing corn, squash, and beans together in small mounds. They also grew sunflowers and pumpkins. Some of the foods we think of as Southern, such as cornbread, are actually borrowed and adapted from Native American culture.\n\nThese were the same people that explorer Hernando DeSoto first encountered in December of 1540. He and his men spent that winter squatting in an abandoned Chickasaw village, but tensions came to a tipping point the following spring when DeSoto demanded that 200 Chickasaw men and young women be handed over. Many Spaniards were killed as a result of those demands, and DeSoto himself barely survived the resulting attack. Afterward, there would be no more encounters between this tribe and the Europeans for over a century.\n\nIn the 1700s and 1800s, the Chickasaws began entering into treaties with the United States. The first was called the Treaty of Hopewell, which created boundaries, promised the tribe that Americans would stay off their lands, and swore friendship and perpetual peace between the Chickasaws and the Americans. The next was a treaty signed at the Chickasaw Bluffs (near present-day Memphis) in October of 1801. It gave the Americans permission to build a road called the Natchez Trace through the Chickasaw lands to accommodate wagons.\n\nA decade later, in 1811, a great earthquake shook the land, sending the waters of the Mississippi River flowing backward and creating what is now called Reelfoot Lake in the northern part of West Tennessee. Many natives from various tribes saw this as a sign that the native people needed to return to their ancestral ways and to stop giving away their lands to the endless stream of incoming settlers. The Chickasaws, however, had cooperated with the United States since its founding and refused to join this uprising many tribal leaders were calling for. The Chickasaws did not band with the other tribes as Tecumseh tried to unite them for one last stand against the people who kept taking their lands. Many sources say Tecumseh prophesied that earthquake, speaking in various towns to convince others to join this movement and declaring that when he arrived back at his home in Detroit, he would stomp his foot and cause the ground to shake in Chickasaw territory. On December 11, 1811, the same day as the New Madrid earthquake, he finally arrived in Detroit. Seven years later, Chickasaw would give up claim to all of West Tennessee.\n\nAfter the Chickasaw signed the treaty of 1818, the document that officially ceded their claims to the lands we now call West Tennessee, the ancient hunting trails were widened to make them easier to travel with wagons and supplies. Settlers, mostly from North Carolina, quickly rushed in to claim these lands, replacing the ancient names of things with new ones. The river that had been called Okeena was given the name Forked Deer; ancient mounds that were built by a native people dating from around the time of Christ were named for a surveyor named Pinson.\n\nThe last great Chickasaw war chief was named Tishomingo. He served under Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 and was the principal signer of the 1818 treaty. When the Indian Removal Act finally resulted in the people being forced out along the Trail of Tears in the 1830s, Tishomingo accompanied his people on the journey. The people were being forced to leave using the same Natchez Trace the 1801 treaty allowed the Americans to build. They were destined for the reservation in Oklahoma 600 miles away, but Chief Tishomingo did not survive the trip. He, like so many others, died of smallpox on the journey that came to be known as the Trail of Tears.\n\nAs those events unfolded, the deer silently witnessed the official end of an age. They saw the ancient trails being created by centuries worth of footsteps. They saw them being purposely widened for an influx of settlers and wagons in the 1820s. In the decade that followed, they saw the Chickasaw people being forced off the lands they had always known as home, the lands where they and their ancestors had lived and farmed and hunted for as long as they could remember.\n\nSometimes it’s easier to pretend that local history officially began when those settlers arrived from the East, dividing up the land into plots and creating new towns and settlements. After all, we don’t hear much about Madison County’s connection to Native American history except in reference to the ancient mound builders at Pinson. Perhaps it’s more comfortable to ignore the prominent role that Andrew Jackson, our city’s namesake, played in the Indian Removal Policy that turned out to be one of the darkest chapters in our nation’s history. But just a decade before Madison County was founded in 1821, these lands were as they had always been in what seems like an unbroken chain, going all the way back into a history long forgotten.\n\nWhen I see deer in my family’s suburban backyard eating the lilies and hostas, I don’t always stop them. I don’t feel like they’re invading my space because I realize how much we’ve encroached upon theirs. As the forests continue to get smaller and smaller, animals are running out of places to go where they are safe from human expansion. This story has been in the making for two centuries now and it continues playing out with each new development project that gets rolled out.\n\nIt’s important that we have protected areas where wildlife can go to be mostly safe from humans. Chickasaw State Park, just south of Madison County, is one of those places, and it’s fitting that it was named in honor of the Chickasaw people. I’ve camped there many times, and each time I go, I’m reminded of how easy it is to reconnect with the various elements of nature while walking the earthen trails, sitting by the still water, feeling the wind dance across my skin, and resting beside a campfire after the sun has disappeared in the evening. And truth be told, from the Mississippi River to the Tennessee River, West Tennessee is filled with places where connecting with nature comes, well, naturally."
