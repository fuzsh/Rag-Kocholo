        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this technical assistance manual is to present the ADA's title III requirements in a format that will be useful to the widest possible audience. The guidance provided in the Department's regulations and accompanying preambles has been carefully reorganized to provide a focused, systematic description of the ADA's requirements. The manual attempts to avoid an overly legalistic style without sacrificing completeness. In order to promote readability and understanding, the text makes liberal use of questions and answers and illustrations.\n\nThe manual is divided into nine major subject matter headings with numerous numbered subheadings. Each numbered heading and subheading is listed in a quick reference table of contents at the beginning of the manual.\n\nIII-1.0000 COVERAGE\n\nRegulatory references: 28 CFR 36.102-36.104.\n\nIII-1.1000 General.\n\nTitle III of the ADA covers –\n\nPlaces of public accommodation;\n\nCommercial facilities; and\n\nExaminations and courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes.\n\nThe obligations of title III only extend to private entities. State and local government entities are public entities covered by title II of the ADA, not by title III.\n\nTitle III also covers private entities primarily engaged in transporting people. The Department of Transportation has issued regulations implementing that section of title III.\n\nIs the Federal Government covered by title III because it is not a \"public entity\" under title II?\n\nThe operations of the executive branch of the Federal Government are not covered by title III of the ADA. They are covered, however, by sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which prohibit disability discrimination in programs and activities conducted by Federal Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service, and by the Architectural Barriers Act, which requires that the design, construction, and alteration of Federal buildings be done in an accessible manner. The activities of the legislative branch, including Congress, on the other hand, are covered under title V of the ADA.\n\nAre places of public accommodation and commercial facilities subject to the same requirements?\n\nNo. Both places of public accommodation and commercial facilities (which include many facilities that are not places of public accommodation) are subject to the title III requirements for new construction and alterations. In addition to these requirements, places of public accommodation must be operated in accordance with the full range of title III requirements, such as nondiscriminatory eligibility criteria; reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures; provision of auxiliary aids; and removal of barriers in existing facilities.\n\nIII-1.2000 Public accommodations.\n\nThe broad range of title III obligations relating to \"places of public accommodation\" must be met by entities that the Department of Justice regulation labels as \"public accommodations.\" In order to be considered a public accommodation with title III obligations, an entity must be private and it must –\n\nOwn;\n\nLease;\n\nLease to; or\n\nOperate a place of public accommodation.\n\nWhat is a place of public accommodation?\n\nA place of public accommodation is a facility whose operations –\n\nAffect commerce; and\n\nFall within at least one of the following 12 categories:\n\nPlaces of lodging (e.g., inns, hotels, motels) (except for owner-occupied establishments renting fewer than six rooms);\n\nEstablishments serving food or drink (e.g., restaurants and bars);\n\nPlaces of exhibition or entertainment (e.g., motion picture houses, theaters, concert halls, stadiums);\n\nPlaces of public gathering (e.g., auditoriums, convention centers, lecture halls);\n\nSales or rental establishments (e.g., bakeries, grocery stores, hardware stores, shopping centers);\n\nService establishments (e.g., laundromats, dry-cleaners, banks, barber shops, beauty shops, travel services, shoe repair services, funeral parlors, gas stations, offices of accountants or lawyers, pharmacies, insurance offices, professional offices of health care providers, hospitals);\n\nPublic transportation terminals, depots, or stations (not including facilities relating to air transportation);\n\nPlaces of public display or collection (e.g., museums, libraries, galleries);\n\nPlaces of recreation (e.g., parks, zoos, amusement parks);\n\nPlaces of education (e.g., nursery schools, elementary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate private schools);\n\nSocial service center establishments (e.g., day care centers, senior citizen centers, homeless shelters, food banks, adoption agencies); and\n\nPlaces of exercise or recreation (e.g., gymnasiums, health spas, bowling alleys, golf courses).\n\nCan a facility be considered a place of public accommodation if it does not fall under one of these 12 categories?\n\nNo, the 12 categories are an exhaustive list. However, within each category the examples given are just illustrations. For example, the category \"sales or rental establishments\" would include many facilities other than those specifically listed, such as video stores, carpet showrooms, and athletic equipment stores.\n\nWhat if a private entity operates, or leases space to, many different types of facilities, of which only relatively few are places of public accommodation? Is the whole private entity still a public accommodation?\n\nThe entire private entity is, legally speaking, a public accommodation, but it only has ADA title III obligations with respect to the operations of the places of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION: ZZ Oil Company owns a wide range of production and processing facilities that are not places of public accommodation. It also operates a large number of retail service stations that are places of public accommodation. In this case, ZZ Oil Company would be a public accommodation. However, only its operations relating to the retail service stations are subject to the broad title III requirements for public accommodations. The other facilities, however, are commercial facilities and would be subject only to the requirements for new construction and alterations.\n\nDo both a landlord who leases space in a building to a tenant and the tenant who operates a place of public accommodation have responsibilities under the ADA?\n\nBoth the landlord and the tenant are public accommodations and have full responsibility for complying with all ADA title III requirements applicable to that place of public accommodation. The title III regulation permits the landlord and the tenant to allocate responsibility, in the lease, for complying with particular provisions of the regulation. However, any allocation made in a lease or other contract is only effective as between the parties, and both landlord and tenant remain fully liable for compliance with all provisions of the ADA relating to that place of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION: ABC Company leases space in a shopping center it owns to XYZ Boutique. In their lease, the parties have allocated to XYZ Boutique the responsibility for complying with the barrier removal requirements of title III within that store. In this situation, if XYZ Boutique fails to remove barriers, both ABC Company (the landlord) and XYZ Boutique (the tenant) would be liable for violating the ADA and could be sued by an XYZ customer. Of course, in the lease, ABC could require XYZ to indemnify it against all losses caused by XYZ's failure to comply with its obligations under the lease, but again, such matters would be between the parties and would not affect their liability under the ADA.\n\nIs a bank that acquires ownership of a place of public accommodation through foreclosure subject to title III?\n\nYes. Any owner of a place of public accommodation is covered as a public accommodation regardless of the intended or actual duration of its ownership.\n\nCan a place of public accommodation be covered by both the ADA and the Fair Housing Act (FHA)?\n\nYes. The analysis for determining whether a facility is covered by title III is entirely separate and independent from the analysis used to determine coverage under the FHA. A facility can be a residential dwelling under the FHA and still fall in whole or in part under at least one of the 12 categories of places of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION: LM, Inc., a private, nonsectarian, nonprofit organization operates a homeless shelter permitting stays ranging from overnight to those of sufficient length to result in coverage as a dwelling under the FHA. Because it permits short-term, overnight stays, the shelter may also be considered a place of public accommodation as a \"place of lodging,\" and covered by title III of the ADA. In addition, if the shelter provides a significant enough level of social services, such as medical care, meals, counseling, transportation, or training, it may also be covered under title III as a \"social service center establishment.\"\n\nDoes title III apply to common areas within residential facilities?\n\nAlthough title III does not apply to strictly residential facilities, it covers places of public accommodation within residential facilities. Thus, areas within multifamily residential facilities that qualify as places of public accommodation are covered by the ADA if use of the areas is not limited exclusively to owners, residents, and their guests.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A private residential apartment complex includes a swimming pool for use by apartment tenants and their guests. The complex also sells pool \"memberships\" generally to the public. The pool qualifies as a place of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A residential condominium association maintains a longstanding policy of restricting use of its party room to owners, residents, and their guests.\n\nConsistent with that policy, it refuses to rent the room to local businesses and community organizations as a meeting place for educational seminars. The party room is not a place of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: A private residential apartment complex contains a rental office. The rental office is a place of public accommodation.\n\nAre model homes places of public accommodation?\n\nGenerally, no. A model home does not fall under one of the 12 categories of places of public accommodation. If, however, the sales office for a residential housing development were located in a model home, the area used for the sales office would be considered a place of public accommodation. Although model homes are not covered, the Department encourages developers to voluntarily provide at least a minimal level of access to model homes for potential homebuyers with disabilities. For example, a developer could provide physical access (via ramp or lift) to the primary level of one of several model homes and make photographs of other levels within the home as well as of other models available to the customer.\n\nCan a vacation timeshare property be a place of public accommodation?\n\nYes. Whether a particular timeshare property is a place of public accommodation depends upon how much the timeshare operation resembles that of a hotel or other typical place of lodging. Among the factors to be considered in this determination are –\n\nWhether the timeshare offers short-term ownership interests (for instance, stays of one week or less are considered short term);\n\nThe nature of the ownership interest conveyed (e.g., fee simple);\n\nThe degree of restrictions placed on the ownership (e.g., whether the timeshare owner has the right to occupy, alter, or exercise control over a particular unit over a period of time);\n\nThe extent to which the operations resemble those of a hotel, motel, or inn (e.g., reservations, central registration, meals, laundry service).\n\nIf a public accommodation operating two geographically separate facilities serves clients or customers at one location and has only administrative offices at another, are both sites places of public accommodation?\n\nNo. Only the facility in which clients or customers are served is covered as a place of public accommodation. The geographically separate, employees-only facility is a commercial facility, but any activities undertaken in that facility that affect the operations of the place of public accommodation are subject to the title III requirements for public accommodations.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A medical care provider owns one building in which patients are seen, and another building in a different location that contains only administrative offices. At the building housing the administrative offices, no services are provided (no patients go there, only employees). The building where patients are treated is a place of public accommodation. The geographically separate administrative offices are a commercial facility, not a place of public accommodation. However, any policies or decisions made in the administrative offices that affect the treatment of patients would be subject to the requirements for public accommodations. For example, a protocol for the provision of auxiliary aids that is issued as a directive to medical staff by the administrative office must comply with the effective communication requirements for public accommodations.\n\nBUT: If patients receive medical services in the same building where the administrative offices are located, the entire building is a place of public accommodation, even if one or more floors are reserved for the exclusive use of employees.\n\nIII-1.3000 Commercial facilities.\n\nThe requirements of title III for new construction and alterations cover commercial facilities, which include nonresidential facilities, such as office buildings, factories, and warehouses, whose operations affect commerce. This category sweeps under ADA coverage a large number of potential places of employment that are not covered as places of public accommodation. A building may contain both commercial facilities and places of public accommodation.\n\nIII-1.3100 Exceptions.\n\nCommercial facilities do not include rail vehicles or any facility covered by the Fair Housing Act. Residential dwelling units, therefore, are not commercial facilities. In addition, facilities that are expressly exempted from coverage under the Fair Housing Act are also not considered to be commercial facilities. For example, owner-occupied rooming houses providing living quarters for four or fewer families, which are exempt from the Fair Housing Act, would not be commercial facilities.\n\nEven though private air terminals are not considered to be places of public accommodation, are airports covered as commercial facilities?\n\nYes, private air terminals are commercial facilities and, therefore, would be subject to the new construction and alterations requirements of title III. Moreover, while a private air terminal, itself, may not be a place of public accommodation (because the ADA statutory language exempts air transportation), the retail stores and service establishments located within a private airport would be places of public accommodation. (In addition, private airports that receive Federal financial assistance are subject to the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities of recipients of Federal funds. Airline operations at private airports may also be subject to the nondiscrimination requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act.) Air terminals operated by public entities would be covered by title II of the ADA, not title III; but any private retail stores operated within the terminal would be places of public accommodation covered by title III.\n\nIII-1.4000 Examinations and courses.\n\nPrivate entities offering examinations or courses covered by title III are subject to the requirements discussed in III-4.6000 of this manual. If the private entity is also a public accommodation or has responsibility for a commercial facility, it would be subject to other applicable title III requirements as well.\n\nIII-1.5000 Religious entities.\n\nReligious entities are exempt from the requirements of title III of the ADA. A religious entity, however, would be subject to the employment obligations of title I if it has enough employees to meet the requirements for coverage.\n\nIII-1.5100 Definition.\n\nA religious entity is a religious organization or an entity controlled by a religious organization, including a place of worship.\n\nIf an organization has a lay board, is it automatically ineligible for the religious exemption?\n\nNo. The exemption is intended to have broad application. For example, a parochial school that teaches religious doctrine and is sponsored by a religious order could be exempt, even if it has a lay board.\n\nIII-1.5200 Scope of exemption.\n\nThe exemption covers all of the activities of a religious entity, whether religious or secular.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A religious congregation operates a day care center and a private elementary school for members and nonmembers alike. Even though the congregation is operating facilities that would otherwise be places of public accommodation, its operations are exempt from title III requirements.\n\nWhat if the congregation rents to a private day care center or elementary school? Is the tenant organization also exempt?\n\nThe private entity that rents the congregation's facilities to operate a place of public accommodation is not exempt, unless it is also a religious entity. If it is not a religious entity, then its activities would be covered by title III. The congregation, however, would remain exempt, even if its tenant is covered. That is, the obligations of a landlord for a place of public accommodation do not apply if the landlord is a religious entity.\n\nIf a nonreligious entity operates a community theater or other place of public accommodation in donated space on the congregation's premises, is the nonreligious entity covered by title III?\n\nNo. A nonreligious entity running a place of public accommodation in space donated by a religious entity is exempt from title III’s requirements. The nonreligious tenant entity is subject to title III only if a lease exists under which rent or other consideration is paid.\n\nIII-1.6000 Private clubs.\n\nThe obligations of title III do not apply to any \"private club.\" An entity is a private club for purposes of the ADA if it is a private club under title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin by public accommodations.\n\nCourts have been most inclined to find private club status in cases where –\n\nMembers exercise a high degree of control over club operations.\n\nThe membership selection process is highly selective.\n\nSubstantial membership fees are charged.\n\nThe entity is operated on a nonprofit basis.\n\nThe club was not founded specifically to avoid compliance with Federal civil rights laws.\n\nFacilities of a private club lose their exemption to the extent that they are made available for use by nonmembers as places of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A private country club that would be considered a \"private club\" for ADA purposes rents space to a private day care center that is also open to the children of nonmembers. Although the private club would maintain its exemption for its other operations, it would have title III obligations with respect to the operation of the day care center.\n\nIII-1.7000 Relationship to title II.\n\nPublic entities, by definition, can never be subject to title III of the ADA, which covers only private entities. Conversely, private entities cannot be covered by title II. There are many situations, however, in which public entities stand in very close relation to private entities that are covered by title III, with the result that certain activities may be affected, at least indirectly, by both titles.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A State department of parks provides a restaurant in one of its State parks. The restaurant is operated by X Corporation under a concession agreement. As a public accommodation, X Corporation is subject to title III of the ADA. The State department of parks, a public entity, is subject to title II. The parks department is obligated to ensure by contract that the restaurant will be operated in a manner that enables the parks department to meet its title II obligations, even though the restaurant is not directly subject to title II.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: The City of W owns a downtown office building occupied by W's Department of Human Resources. The first floor is leased as commercial space to a restaurant, a newsstand, and a travel agency. The City of W, as a public entity, is subject to title II in its role as landlord of the office building. As a public entity, it cannot be subject to title III, even though its tenants are public accommodations that are covered by title III.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: A private, nonprofit corporation operates a number of group homes under contract with a State agency for the benefit of individuals with mental disabilities. These particular homes provide a significant enough level of social services to be considered places of public accommodation under title III. The State agency must ensure that its contracts are carried out in accordance with title II, and the private entity must ensure that the homes comply with title III. Where public and private entities act jointly, the public entity must ensure that the relevant requirements of title II are met; and the private entity must ensure compliance with title III.\n\nILLUSTRATION: The City of W engages in a joint venture with T Corporation to build a new professional football stadium. The new stadium would have to be built in compliance with the accessibility guidelines of both titles II and III. In cases where the standards differ, the stadium would have to meet the standard that provides the highest degree of access to individuals with disabilities.\n\nIII-1.8000 Relationship to other laws\n\nIII-1.8100 Rehabilitation Act.\n\nTitle III is intended to provide protection to individuals with disabilities that is at least as great as that provided under title V of the Rehabilitation Act. Title V includes such provisions as section 504, which covers all the operations of Federal Executive agencies and programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Title III may not be interpreted to provide a lesser degree of protection to individuals with disabilities than is provided under section 504.\n\nIII-1.8200 Other Federal and State laws.\n\nTitle III does not disturb other Federal laws or any State law that provides protection for individuals with disabilities at a level greater or equal to that provided by the ADA. It does, however, prevail over any conflicting State laws.\n\nIII-2.0000 INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES\n\nRegulatory references: 28 CFR 36.104.\n\nIII-2.1000 General.\n\nTitle III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against any \"individual with a disability.\" People commonly refer to disabilities or disabling conditions in a broad sense. For example, poverty or lack of education may impose real limitations on an individual's opportunities. Likewise, being only five feet in height may prove to be an insurmountable barrier to an individual whose ambition is to play professional basketball. Although one might loosely characterize these conditions as \"disabilities\" in relation to the aspirations of the particular individual, the disabilities reached by title III are limited to those that meet the ADA's legal definition – those that place substantial limitations on an individual's major life activities.\n\nTitle III protects three categories of individuals with disabilities:\n\nIndividuals who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;\n\nIndividuals who have a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of the individual's major life activities; and\n\nIndividuals who are regarded as having such an impairment, whether they have the impairment or not.\n\nIII-2.2000 Physical or mental impairments.\n\nThe first category of persons covered by the definition of an individual with a disability is restricted to those with \"physical or mental impairments.\" Physical impairments include –\n\nPhysiological disorders or conditions;\n\nCosmetic disfigurement; or\n\nAnatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs (which would include speech organs that are not respiratory such as vocal cords, soft palate, tongue, etc.); respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine.\n\nSpecific examples of physical impairments include orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, HIV disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism.\n\nMental impairments include mental or psychological disorders, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.\n\nSimple physical characteristics such as the color of one's eyes, hair, or skin; baldness; left-handedness; or age do not constitute physical impairments. Similarly, disadvantages attributable to environmental, cultural, or economic factors are not the type of impairments covered by title III. Moreover, the definition does not include common personality traits such as poor judgment or a quick temper, where these are not symptoms of a mental or psychological disorder.\n\nDoes title III prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation?\n\nNo. The phrase “physical or mental impairment” does not include homosexuality or bisexuality.\n\nIII-2.3000 Drug addiction as an impairment.\n\nDrug addiction is an impairment under the ADA. A public accommodation generally, however, may base a decision to withhold services or benefits in most cases on the fact that an addict is engaged in the current and illegal use of drugs.\n\nWhat is illegal use of drugs?\n\nIllegal use of drugs means the use of one or more drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act. It does not include use of controlled substances pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses that are authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other Federal law. Alcohol is not a \"controlled substance,\" but alcoholism is a disability.\n\nWhat is \"current use\"?\n\n\"Current use\" is the illegal use of controlled substances that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem. Therefore, a private entity should review carefully all the facts surrounding its belief that an individual is currently taking illegal drugs to ensure that its belief is a reasonable one.\n\nDoes title III protect drug addicts who no longer take controlled substances?\n\nYes. Title III prohibits discrimination against drug addicts based solely on the fact that they previously illegally used controlled substances. Protected individuals include persons who have successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program or have otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and who are not engaging in current illegal use of drugs. Additionally, discrimination is prohibited against an individual who is currently participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is not engaging in current illegal use of drugs. Finally, a person who is erroneously regarded as engaging in current illegal use of drugs is protected.\n\nIs drug testing permitted under the ADA?\n\nYes. Public accommodations may utilize reasonable policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug testing, designed to ensure that an individual who formerly engaged in the illegal use of drugs is not now engaging in current illegal use of drugs.\n\nIII-2.4000 Substantial limitation of a major life activity.\n\nTo constitute a \"disability,\" a condition must substantially limit a major life activity. Major life activities include such activities as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\n\nWhen does an impairment \"substantially limit\" a major life activity?\n\nThere is no absolute standard for determining when an impairment is a substantial limitation. Some impairments obviously or by their nature substantially limit the ability of an individual to engage in a major life activity.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A person who is deaf is substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing. A person with a minor hearing impairment, on the other hand, may not be substantially limited.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A person with traumatic brain injury may be substantially limited in the major life activities of caring for one's self, learning, and working because of memory deficit, confusion, contextual difficulties, and inability to reason appropriately.\n\nAn impairment substantially interferes with the accomplishment of a major life activity when the individual's important life activities are restricted as to the conditions, manner, or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most people.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A person with a minor vision impairment, such as 20/40 vision, does not have a substantial impairment of the major life activity of seeing.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A person who can walk for 10 miles continuously is not substantially limited in walking merely because, on the eleventh mile, he or she begins to experience pain, because most people would not be able to walk eleven miles without experiencing some discomfort.\n\nAre \"temporary\" mental or physical impairments covered by title III?\n\nYes, if the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The issue of whether a temporary impairment is significant enough to be a disability must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration both the duration (or expected duration) of the impairment and the extent to which it actually limits a major life activity of the affected individual.\n\nILLUSTRATION: During a house fire, M received burns affecting his hands and arms. While it is expected that, with treatment, M will eventually recover full use of his hands, in the meantime he is substantially limited in performing basic tasks required to care for himself such as eating and dressing. Because M's burns are expected to substantially limit a major life activity (caring for one's self) for a significant period of time, M would be considered to have a disability covered by title III.\n\nIf a person's impairment is greatly lessened or eliminated through the use of aids or devices, would the person still be considered an individual with a disability?\n\nWhether a person has a disability is determined without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable modifications, auxiliary aids and services, services or devices of a personal nature, or medication. For example, a person with severe hearing loss is substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, even though the loss may be improved through the use of a hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, that, if untreated, would substantially limit a major life activity, are still individuals with disabilities under the ADA, even if the debilitating consequences of the impairment are controlled by medication.\n\nIII-2.5000 Record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited a major life activity.\n\nThe ADA protects not only those individuals with disabilities who actually have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, but also those with a record of such an impairment.\n\nThis protected group includes –\n\nA person who has a history of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity but who has recovered from the impairment. Examples of individuals who have a history of an impairment are persons who have histories of mental or emotional illness, drug addiction, alcoholism, heart disease, or cancer.\n\nPersons who have been misclassified as having an impairment. Examples include persons who have been erroneously diagnosed as mentally retarded or mentally ill.\n\nIII-2.6000 \"Regarded as.\"\n\nThe ADA also protects certain persons who are regarded by a public entity as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, whether or not that person actually has an impairment. Three typical situations are covered by this category:\n\nAn individual who has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities, but who is treated as if the impairment does substantially limit a major life activity;\n\nILLUSTRATION: A, an individual with mild diabetes controlled by medication, is barred by the staff of a private summer camp from participation in certain sports because of her diabetes. Even though A does not actually have an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, she is protected under the ADA because she is treated as though she does.\n\nAn individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others towards the impairment;\n\nILLUSTRATION: B, a three-year old child born with a prominent facial disfigurement, has been refused admittance to a private day care program on the grounds that her presence in the program might upset the other children. B is an individual with a physical impairment that substantially limits her major life activities only as the result of the attitudes of others toward her impairment.\n\nAn individual who has no impairments but who is treated by a public accommodation as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. ILLUSTRATION: C is excluded from a private elementary school because the principal believes rumors that C is infected with the HIV virus. Even though these rumors are untrue, C is protected under the ADA, because he is being subjected to discrimination by the school based on the belief that he has an impairment that substantially limits major life activities (i.e., the belief that he is infected with HIV).\n\nIII-2.7000 Exclusions.\n\nThe following conditions are specifically excluded from the definition of \"disability\": transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, other sexual behavior disorders, compulsive gambling, kleptomania, pyromania, and psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs.\n\nIII-3.0000 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nRegulatory references: 28 CFR 36.201-36.213.\n\nIII-3.1000 General.\n\nA public accommodation may not discriminate against an individual with a disability in the operation of a place of public accommodation. Individuals with disabilities may not be denied full and equal enjoyment of the \"goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\" offered by a place of public accommodation. The phrase \"goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\" applies to whatever type of good or service a public accommodation provides to its customers or clients. In other words, a public accommodation must ensure equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities.\n\nSeveral broad principles underlie the nondiscrimination requirements of title III. These include –\n\nEqual opportunity to participate;\n\nEqual opportunity to benefit; and\n\nReceipt of benefits in the most integrated setting appropriate.\n\nThe specific requirements discussed below in III-4.0000 are all designed to effectuate the general requirements. The specific provisions furnish guidance on how a public accommodation can meet its obligations in particular situations and establish standards for determining when the general requirement has been violated. Where a specific requirement applies, it controls over the general requirement.\n\nILLUSTRATION: Public accommodations are only required to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities if removal is \"readily achievable\" (see III-4.4200). If making the main entrance to a place of public accommodation accessible is not readily achievable, the public accommodation can provide access to the facility through another entrance, even though use of the alternative entrance for individuals with disabilities would not be the most integrated setting appropriate.\n\nIII-3.2000 Denial of participation.\n\nThe ADA prohibits discriminatory denial of services or benefits to individuals with disabilities. Just as under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a restaurant cannot refuse to admit an individual because of his or her race under the ADA, it cannot refuse to admit an individual merely because he or she has a disability.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A theater cannot refuse to admit an individual with mental retardation to a performance merely because of the individual's mental disability.\n\nIII-3.3000 Equality in participation/benefits.\n\nThe ADA mandates an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods and services offered by a place of public accommodation, but does not guarantee that an individual with a disability must achieve an identical result or level of achievement as persons without disabilities.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: Persons with disabilities must not be limited to certain performances at a theater.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: An individual who uses a wheelchair may not be excluded from an exercise class at a health club because he or she cannot do all of the exercises and derive the same result from the class as persons without disabilities.\n\nIII-3.4000 Separate benefit/integrated setting.\n\nA primary goal of the ADA is the equal participation of individuals with disabilities in the \"mainstream\" of American society. The major principles of mainstreaming include the following:\n\nIndividuals with disabilities must be integrated to the maximum extent appropriate.\n\nSeparate programs are permitted where necessary to ensure equal opportunity. A separate program must be appropriate to the particular individual.\n\nIndividuals with disabilities cannot be excluded from the regular program, or required to accept special services or benefits.\n\nIII-3.4100 Separate programs.\n\nA public accommodation may offer separate or special programs necessary to provide individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from the programs. Such programs must, however, be specifically designed to meet the needs of the individuals with disabilities for whom they are provided.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: Museums generally do not allow visitors to touch exhibits because handling can cause damage to the objects. A municipal museum may offer a special tour for individuals with vision impairments during which they are permitted to touch and handle specific objects on a limited basis.(It cannot, however, exclude a blind person from the standard museum tour.)\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A private athletic facility may sponsor a separate basketball league for individuals who use wheelchairs.\n\nIII-3.4200 Right to participate in the regular program.\n\nEven if a separate or special program for individuals with disabilities is offered, a public accommodation cannot deny an individual with a disability participation in its regular program, unless some other limitation on the obligation to provide services applies. See, e.g., III- 3.8000 (direct threat); III-4.1000 (eligibility criteria).\n\nILLUSTRATION: An individual who uses a wheelchair may be excluded from playing in a basketball league, if the recreation center can demonstrate that the exclusion is necessary for safe operation.\n\nIndividuals with disabilities are entitled to participate in regular programs, even if the public accommodation could reasonably believe that they cannot benefit from the regular program.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A museum cannot exclude a person who is blind from a tour because of assumptions about his or her inability to appreciate and benefit from the tour experience. Similarly, a deaf person may not be excluded from a museum concert because of a belief that deaf persons cannot enjoy the music.\n\nThe fact that a public accommodation offers special programs does not affect the right of an individual with a disability to participate in regular programs. The requirements for providing access to the regular program still apply.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A public accommodation cannot exclude a person who is blind from a standard museum tour, where touching objects is not permitted, if he or she prefers the standard tour.\n\nIndividuals with disabilities may not be required to accept special \"benefits\" if they choose not to do so.\n\nILLUSTRATION: ABC theater offers reduced rate tickets for individuals with disabilities and requires appropriate documentation for eligibility for the reduced rates. ABC cannot require an individual who qualifies for the reduced rate to present documentation or accept the reduced rate, if he or she chooses to pay the full price.\n\nIII-3.4300 Modifications in the regular program.\n\nWhen a public accommodation offers a special program for individuals with a particular disability, but an individual with that disability elects to participate in the regular program rather than in the separate program, the public accommodation may still have obligations to provide an opportunity for that individual to benefit from the regular program. The fact that a separate program is offered may be a factor in determining the extent of the obligations under the regular program, but only if the separate program is appropriate to the needs of the particular individual with a disability.\n\nILLUSTRATION: If a museum provides a sign language interpreter for one of its regularly scheduled tours, the availability of the signed tour may be a factor in determining whether it would be an undue burden to provide an interpreter for a deaf person who wants to take the tour at a different time.\n\nBUT: The availability of the signed tour would not affect the museum's obligation to provide an interpreter for a different tour, or the museum's obligation to provide a different auxiliary aid, such as an assistive listening device, for an individual with impaired hearing who does not use sign language.\n\nIII-3.5000 Discrimination on the basis of association.\n\nA public accommodation may not discriminate against individuals or entities because of their known relationship or association with persons who have disabilities.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A day care center cannot refuse to admit a child because his or her brother is infected with HIV, even though the child seeking admission does not have a disability.\n\nThis prohibition applies to cases where the public accommodation has knowledge of both the individual's disability and his or her relationship to another individual or entity. In addition to familial relationships, the prohibition covers any type of association between the individual or entity that is discriminated against and the individual or individuals with disabilities, if the discrimination is actually based on the disability.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: The owner of a building may not refuse to lease space to a medical facility because the facility specializes in treatment of individuals with HIV disease.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: If a theater refuses to admit K, an individual with cerebral palsy, as well as L (his brother) because K has cerebral palsy, the theater would be illegally discriminating against L on the basis of his association with K.\n\nIII-3.6000 Retaliation or coercion.\n\nIndividuals who exercise their rights under the ADA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A restaurant may not refuse to serve a customer because he or she filed an ADA complaint against the restaurant or against another public accommodation.\n\nProtection is extended to those who assist others in exercising their rights.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A dry cleaner may not refuse to serve an individual because he encouraged another individual to file a complaint, or because he testified for that individual in a proceeding to enforce the ADA.\n\nAny form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere with the exercise of rights under the ADA.\n\nILLUSTRATION: It would be a violation for a restaurant customer to harass or intimidate an individual with a disability in an effort to prevent that individual from patronizing the restaurant.\n\nIII-3.7000 Maintenance of accessible features.\n\nPublic accommodations must maintain in working order equipment and features of facilities that are required to provide ready access to individuals with disabilities. Isolated or temporary interruptions in access due to maintenance and repair of accessible features are not prohibited.\n\nWhere a public accommodation must provide an accessible route, the route must remain accessible and not blocked by obstacles such as furniture, filing cabinets, or potted plants. Similarly, accessible doors must be unlocked when the place of public accommodation is open for business.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: Placing a vending machine on the accessible route to an accessible restroom in a bowling alley would be a violation if it obstructed the accessible route.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: Placing ornamental plants in an elevator lobby may be a violation if they block the approach to the elevator call buttons or obstruct access to the elevator cars.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: Using an accessible route for storage of supplies would also be a violation, if it made the route inaccessible.\n\nBUT: An isolated instance of placement of an object on an accessible route would not be a violation, if the object is promptly removed.\n\nAlthough it is recognized that mechanical failures in equipment such as elevators or automatic doors will occur from time to time, the obligation to ensure that facilities are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities would be violated, if repairs are not made promptly or if improper or inadequate maintenance causes repeated and persistent failures. Inoperable or \"out of service\" equipment does not meet the requirements for providing access to a place of public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: It would be a violation for a building manager of a three-story building to turn off an elevator during business hours in order to save energy.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: Deactivating accessible automatic doors because of inclement weather would not be permitted.\n\nIII-3.8000 Direct threat.\n\nA public accommodation may exclude an individual with a disability from participation in an activity, if that individual's participation would result in a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The public accommodation must determine that there is a significant risk to others that cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable modifications to the public accommodation's policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of appropriate auxiliary aids or services. The determination that a person poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others may not be based on generalizations or stereotypes about the effects of a particular disability; it must be based on an individual assessment that considers the particular activity and the actual abilities and disabilities of the individual.\n\nThe individual assessment must be based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical evidence, or on the best available objective evidence, to determine –\n\nThe nature, duration, and severity of the risk;\n\nThe probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and\n\nWhether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate or eliminate the risk.\n\nSuch an inquiry is essential to protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to legitimate concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others to significant health and safety risks. Making this assessment will not usually require the services of a physician. Sources for medical knowledge include public health authorities, such as the U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nILLUSTRATION: Refusal to admit an individual to a restaurant because he or she is infected with HIV would be a violation, because the HIV virus cannot be transmitted through casual contact, such as that among restaurant patrons.\n\nIII-3.9000 Illegal use of drugs.\n\nDiscrimination based on an individual's current illegal use of drugs is not prohibited (see III-2.3000).Although individuals currently using illegal drugs are not protected from discrimination, the ADA does prohibit denial of health services, or services provided in connection with drug rehabilitation, to an individual on the basis of current illegal use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such services.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A hospital emergency room may not refuse to provide emergency services to an individual because the individual is illegally using drugs.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A medical facility that specializes in care of burn patients may not refuse to treat an individual's burns on the grounds that the individual is illegally using drugs.\n\nBecause abstention from the use of drugs is an essential condition for participation in some drug rehabilitation programs, and may be a necessary requirement in inpatient or residential settings, a drug rehabilitation or treatment program may deny participation to individuals who use drugs while they are in the program.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A residential drug and alcohol treatment program may expel an individual for using drugs in a treatment center.\n\nIII-3.10000 Smoking.\n\nA public accommodation may prohibit smoking, or may impose restrictions on smoking, in places of public accommodation.\n\nIII-3.11000 Insurance.\n\nInsurance offices are places of public accommodation and, as such, may not discriminate on the basis of disability in the sale of insurance contracts or in the terms or conditions of the insurance contracts they offer. Because of the nature of the insurance business, however, consideration of disability in the sale of insurance contracts does not always constitute \"discrimination.\" An insurer or other public accommodation may underwrite, classify, or administer risks that are based on or not inconsistent with State law, provided that such practices are not used to evade the purposes of the ADA.\n\nThus, a public accommodation may offer a plan that limits certain kinds of coverage based on classification of risk, but may not refuse to insure, or refuse to continue to insure, or limit the amount, extent, or kind of coverage available to an individual, or charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of a physical or mental impairment, except where the refusal, limitation, or rate differential is based on sound actuarial principles or is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience. The ADA, therefore, does not prohibit use of legitimate actuarial considerations to justify differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A person who has cerebral palsy may not be denied coverage based on disability independent of actuarial risk classification.\n\nCan a group health insurance policy have a pre-existing condition exclusion?\n\nYes. An individual with a pre-existing condition may be denied coverage for that condition for the period specified in the policy. However, the individual cannot be denied coverage for illness or injuries unrelated to the pre-existing condition.\n\nCan an insurance policy limit coverage for certain procedures or treatments?\n\nYes, but it may not entirely deny coverage to a person with a disability.\n\nDoes the ADA require insurance companies to provide a copy of the actuarial data on which its actions are based at the request of the applicant?\n\nThe ADA does not require it. Under some State regulatory schemes, however, insurers may have to file such actuarial information with the State regulatory agency, and this information may be obtainable at the State level.\n\nDoes the ADA apply only to life and health insurance?\n\nNo. Although life and health insurance are the areas where the ADA will have its greatest application, the ADA applies equally to unjustified discrimination in all types of insurance, including property and casualty insurance, provided by public accommodations.\n\nILLUSTRATION: Differential treatment of individuals with disabilities, including individuals who have been treated for alcoholism, applying for automobile insurance would have to be justified by legitimate actuarial considerations.\n\nBUT: An individual's driving record, including any alcohol-related violations, may be considered.\n\nMay a public accommodation refuse to serve an individual with a disability because of limitations on coverage or rates in its insurance policies?\n\nNo. A public accommodation may not rely on such limitations to justify exclusion of individuals with disabilities. Any exclusion must be based on legitimate safety concerns (see III- 4.1200), rather than on the terms of the insurance contract.\n\nILLUSTRATION: An amusement park requires individuals to meet a minimum height requirement that excludes some individuals with disabilities for certain rides because of a limitation in its liability insurance coverage. The limitation in insurance coverage is not a permissible basis for the exclusion.\n\nBUT: The minimum height requirement would be a permissible safety criterion, if it is necessary for the safe operation of the ride.\n\nIII-3.12000 Places of public accommodation located in private residences.\n\nWhen a place of public accommodation is located in a home, the portions of the home used as a place of public accommodation are covered by title III, even if those portions are also used for residential purposes.\n\nCoverage extends not only to those portions but also includes an accessible route from the sidewalk, through the doorway, through the hallway and other portions of the home, such as restrooms, used by clients and customers of the public accommodation.\n\nILLUSTRATION: J, a family day care provider, is having a new home built. J intends to use two of the rooms as a family day care center. In addition, the children will be using the master bathroom. Even though the two rooms and bathroom will be used for residential purposes when the children are not present, all three rooms are covered by the title III new construction requirements, because the rooms are not being used exclusively as a residence. Moreover, J must assure that there is an accessible route to the day care rooms and bathroom.\n\nIII-4.0000 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS\n\nRegulatory references: 28 CFR 36.301-36.310.\n\nIII-4.1000 Eligibility criteria\n\nIII-4.1100 General.\n\nA public accommodation may not impose eligibility criteria that either screen out or tend to screen out persons with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, privileges, advantages, or accommodations offered to individuals without disabilities, unless it can show that such requirements are necessary for the provision of the goods, services, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A restaurant has an unofficial policy of seating individuals with visible disabilities in the least desirable parts of the restaurant. This policy violates the ADA because it establishes an eligibility criterion that discriminates against individuals with certain disabilities and that is not necessary for the operation of the restaurant. The restaurant may not justify its policy on the basis of the preferences of its other customers.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A parking garage refuses to allow vans to park inside even though the garage has adequate roof clearance and space for vans. Although the garage operator does not intend to discriminate against individuals with disabilities, the garage's policy unnecessarily tends to screen out people with certain mobility impairments who, in order to have enough space for mobility aids such as wheelchairs, use vans rather than cars.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: A cruise ship subject to the ADA discovers that an individual who uses a wheelchair has made a reservation for a cruise and plans to travel independently. The cruise line notifies the individual that she must bring a \"traveling companion\" or her reservation will be cancelled. Requiring a traveling companion as an eligibility criterion violates the ADA, unless the cruise line demonstrates that its policy is necessary for some compelling reason.\n\nILLUSTRATION 4: A committee reviews applications from physicians seeking \"admitting privileges\" at a privately owned hospital. The hospital requires all applicants, no matter their specialty, to meet certain physical and mental health qualifications, because the hospital believes they will promote the safe and efficient delivery of medical care. The hospital must be able to show that the specific qualifications imposed are necessary.\n\nIII-4.1200 Safety.\n\nA public accommodation may impose legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation. However, the public accommodation must ensure that its safety requirements are based on real risks, not on speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A wilderness tour company may require participants to meet a necessary level of swimming proficiency in order to participate in a rafting expedition.\n\nIII-4.1300 Unnecessary inquiries.\n\nThe ADA prohibits unnecessary inquiries into the existence of a disability.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A private summer camp requires parents to fill out a questionnaire and to submit medical documentation regarding their children's ability to participate in various camp activities. The questionnaire is acceptable if the summer camp can demonstrate that each piece of information requested is needed to ensure safe participation in camp activities. The camp, however, may not use this information to screen out children with disabilities from admittance to the camp.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A retail store requires applicants for a store credit card to supply information regarding their physical or mental health history. This policy violates the ADA because such information is not relevant to a determination of credit worthiness.\n\nIII-4.1400 Surcharges.\n\nAlthough compliance may result in some additional cost, a public accommodation may not place a surcharge only on particular individuals with disabilities or groups of individuals with disabilities to cover these expenses.\n\nILLUSTRATION: The ABC pharmacy is located on the second floor of an older four- story building that does not have an elevator. Because the pharmacy's owner has determined that providing physical access to the pharmacy for those unable to climb stairs would not be readily achievable, she has chosen to provide home delivery as a readily achievable alternative to barrier removal. The pharmacy may not charge an individual who uses a wheelchair for the cost of providing home delivery.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: In order to ensure effective communication with a deaf patient during an office visit, a doctor arranges for the services of a sign language interpreter. The cost of the interpreter's services must be absorbed by the doctor.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: A community civic association arranges to provide interpreting services for a deaf individual wishing to attend a business seminar sponsored by the organization in rented space at a local motel. The interpreting service requires the organization to provide payment in full prior to the seminar. Due to a business emergency, the individual is unable to attend. The organization may not charge the deaf individual for the cost of the unused interpreting services.\n\nIII-4.2000 Reasonable modifications\n\nIII-4.2100 General.\n\nA public accommodation must reasonably modify its policies, practices, or procedures to avoid discrimination. If the public accommodation can demonstrate, however, that a modification would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations it provides, it is not required to make the modification.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A private health clinic, in collaboration with its local public safety officials, has developed an evacuation plan to be used in the event of fire or other emergency. The clinic occupies several floors of a multistory building. During an emergency, elevators, which are the normal means of exiting from the clinic, will be shut off. The health clinic is obligated to modify its evacuation procedures, if necessary, to provide alternative means for clients with mobility impairments to be safely evacuated from the clinic without using the elevator. The clinic should also modify its plan to take into account the needs of its clients with visual, hearing, and other disabilities.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: Under its obligation to remove architectural barriers where it is readily achievable to do so, a local motel has greatly improved physical access in several of its rooms. However, under its present reservation system, the motel is unable to guarantee that, when a person requests an accessible room, one of the new rooms will actually be available when he or she arrives. The ADA requires the motel to make reasonable modifications in its reservation system to ensure the availability of the accessible room.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: A retail store has a policy of not taking special orders for out-of- stock merchandise unless the customer appears personally to sign the order. The store would be required to reasonably modify its procedures to allow the taking of special orders by phone from persons with disabilities who cannot visit the store. If the store's concern is obtaining a guarantee of payment that a signed order would provide, the store could, for example, take orders by mail or take credit card orders by telephone from persons with disabilities.\n\nIII-4.2200 Specialties.\n\nIt is not considered discriminatory for a public accommodation with a specialty in a particular area to refer an individual with a disability to a different public accommodation if –\n\nThe individual is seeking a service or treatment outside the referring public accommodation's area of expertise; and\n\nThe public accommodation would make a similar referral for an individual who does not have a disability.\n\nILLUSTRATION: An individual who is blind initially visits a doctor who specializes in family medicine. The doctor discovers that the individual has a potentially cancerous growth. The family practice physician may refer the blind individual to a cancer specialist, if he or she has no expertise in that area, and if he or she would make a similar referral for an individual who is not blind. The cancer specialist who receives the referral may not refuse to treat the individual for cancer-related problems simply because the individual is blind.\n\nIII-4.2300 Service animals.\n\nA public accommodation must modify its policies to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration or jeopardize the safe operation of the public accommodation.\n\nService animals include any animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. Tasks typically performed by service animals include guiding people with impaired vision, alerting individuals with impaired hearing to the presence of intruders or sounds, providing minimal protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, or retrieving dropped items.\n\nThe care or supervision of a service animal is the responsibility of his or her owner, not the public accommodation. A public accommodation may not require an individual with a disability to post a deposit as a condition to permitting a service animal to accompany its owner in a place of public accommodation, even if such deposits are required for pets.\n\nILLUSTRATION: An individual who is blind wishes to be accompanied in a restaurant by her guide dog. The restaurant must permit the guide dog to accompany its owner in all areas of the restaurant open to other patrons and may not insist that the dog be separated from her.\n\nA number of States have programs to certify service animals. A private entity, however, may not insist on proof of State certification before permitting the entry of a service animal to a place of public accommodation.\n\nIII-4.2400 Check-out aisles.\n\nIf a store has check-out aisles, customers with disabilities must be provided an equivalent level of convenience in access to check- out facilities as customers without disabilities. To accomplish this, the store must either keep an adequate number of accessible aisles open or otherwise modify its policies and practices.\n\nILLUSTRATION: PQR Foodmart has twenty narrow, inaccessible check-out aisles and one wider, accessible aisle. The accessible aisle is used as an express lane limited to customers purchasing fewer than ten items. K, who uses a wheelchair, wishes to make a larger purchase. PQR Foodmart must permit K to make his large purchase at the express lane.\n\nIII-4.2500 Accessible or special goods.\n\nAs a general rule, a public accommodation is not required to alter its inventory to carry accessible or special products that are designed for or easier to use by customers with disabilities. Examples of accessible goods include Brailled books, books on audio tape, closed-captioned video tapes, specially sized or designed clothing, and foods that meet special dietary needs.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A local book store has customarily carried only regular print versions of books. The ADA does not require the bookstore to expand its inventory to include large print books or books on audio tape.\n\nOn the other hand, a public accommodation may be required to special order accessible goods at the request of a customer with a disability if –\n\nIt makes special orders for unstocked goods in its regular course of business, and\n\nThe accessible or special goods requested can be obtained from one of its regular suppliers.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A customer of a local bookstore begins to experience some vision loss and has difficulty reading regular print. Upon request by the customer, the bookstore is required to try to obtain large print books, if it normally fills special orders (of any kind) for its other customers, and if large print books can be obtained from its regular suppliers.\n\nThe ADA does not require that manufacturers provide warranties or operating manuals that are packed with the product in accessible formats.\n\nIII-4.2600 Personal services and devices.\n\nA public accommodation is not required to provide individuals with disabilities with personal or individually prescribed devices, such as wheelchairs, prescription eyeglasses, or hearing aids, or to provide services of a personal nature, such as assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.\n\nAlthough discussed here as a limit on the duty to make reasonable modifications, this provision applies to all aspects of the title III rule and limits the obligations of public accommodations in areas such as the provision of auxiliary aids and services, alternatives to barrier removal, and examinations and courses.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"services of a personal nature\" is not to be interpreted as referring to minor assistance provided to individuals with disabilities. For example, measures taken as alternatives to barrier removal, such as retrieving items from shelves or providing curb service or home delivery, or actions required as modifications in policies, practices, and procedures, such as a waiter's removing the cover from a customer's straw, a kitchen's cutting up food into smaller pieces, or a bank's filling out a deposit slip, would not be considered \"services of a personal nature.\" Also, if a public accommodation such as a hospital or nursing home customarily provides its clients with what might otherwise be considered services of a personal nature, it must provide the same services for individuals with disabilities.\n\nILLUSTRATION: An exclusive women's clothing shop provides individualized assistance to its customers in selecting and trying on garments. Although \"dressing\" might otherwise be considered a personal service, in this case the store must extend the same service to its customers with disabilities. However, a \"no frills\" merchandiser would not be required to provide assistance in trying on garments, because it does not provide such a service to any of its customers.\n\nIII-4.3000 Auxiliary aids\n\nIII-4.3100 General.\n\nA public accommodation is required to provide auxiliary aids and services that are necessary to ensure equal access to the goods, services, facilities, privileges, or accommodations that it offers, unless an undue burden or a fundamental alteration would result.\n\nWho is entitled to auxiliary aids?\n\nThis obligation extends only to individuals with disabilities who have physical or mental impairments, such as vision, hearing, or speech impairments, that substantially limit the ability to communicate. Measures taken to accommodate individuals with other types of disabilities are covered by other title III requirements such as \"reasonable modifications\" and \"alternatives to barrier removal.\"\n\nILLUSTRATION: W, an individual who is blind, needs assistance in locating and removing an item from a grocery store shelf. A store employee who locates the desired item for W would be providing an \"auxiliary aid or service.\"\n\nBUT: If G, who uses a wheelchair, receives the same retrieval service, not because of a disability related to communication, but rather because of his inability to physically reach the desired item, the store would be making a required \"reasonable modification\" in its practices, as discussed in III-4.2000 of this manual.\n\nIII-4.3200 Effective communication.\n\nIn order to provide equal access, a public accommodation is required to make available appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effective communication. The type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with the length and complexity of the communication involved.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: H, an individual who is deaf, is shopping for film at a camera store. Exchanging written notes with the sales clerk would be adequate to ensure effective communication.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: H then stops by a new car showroom to look at the latest models. The car dealer would be able to communicate effectively general information about the models available by providing brochures and exchanging notes by pen and notepad, or perhaps by means of taking turns at a computer terminal keyboard. If H becomes serious about making a purchase, the services of a qualified interpreter may be necessary because of the complicated nature of the communication involved in buying a car.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: S, an individual who is blind, visits an electronics store to purchase a clock radio and wishes to inspect the merchandise information cards next to the floor models in order to decide which one to buy. Reading the model information to S should be adequate to ensure effective communication. Of course, if S is unreasonably demanding or is shopping when the store is extremely busy, it may be an undue burden to spend extended periods of time reading price and product information.\n\nILLUSTRATION 4: S also has tickets to a play. When S arrives at the theater, the usher notices that S is an individual who is blind and guides S to her seat. An usher is also available to guide S to her seat following intermission. With the provision of these services, a Brailled ticket is not necessary for effective communication in seating S.\n\nILLUSTRATION 5: The same theater provides S with a tape-recorded version of its printed program for the evening's performance. A Brailled program is not necessary to effectively communicate the contents of the program to S, if an audio cassette and tape player are provided.\n\nWho decides what type of auxiliary aid should be provided?\n\nPublic accommodations should consult with individuals with disabilities wherever possible to determine what type of auxiliary aid is needed to ensure effective communication. In many cases, more than one type of auxiliary aid or service may make effective communication possible. While consultation is strongly encouraged, the ultimate decision as to what measures to take to ensure effective communication rests in the hands of the public accommodation, provided that the method chosen results in effective communication.\n\nILLUSTRATION: A patient who is deaf brings his own sign language interpreter for an office visit without prior consultation and bills the physician for the cost of the interpreter. The physician is not obligated to comply with the unilateral determination by the patient that an interpreter is necessary. The physician must be given an opportunity to consult with the patient and make an independent assessment of what type of auxiliary aid, if any, is necessary to ensure effective communication. If the patient believes that the physician's decision will not lead to effective communication, then the patient may challenge that decision under title III by initiating litigation or filing a complaint with the Department of Justice (see III-8.0000).\n\nWho is a qualified interpreter?\n\nThere are a number of sign language systems in use by persons who use sign language. (The most common systems of sign language are American Sign Language and signed English.) Individuals who use a particular system may not communicate effectively through an interpreter who uses another system. When an interpreter is required, the public accommodation should provide a qualified interpreter, that is, an interpreter who is able to sign to the individual who is deaf what is being said by the hearing person and who can voice to the hearing person what is being signed by the individual who is deaf. This communication must be conveyed effectively, accurately, and impartially, through the use of any necessary specialized vocabulary.\n\nCan a public accommodation use a staff member who signs \"pretty well\" as an interpreter for meetings with individuals who use sign language to communicate?\n\nSigning and interpreting are not the same thing. Being able to sign does not mean that a person can process spoken communication into the proper signs, nor does it mean that he or she possesses the proper skills to observe someone signing and change their signed or fingerspelled communication into spoken words. The interpreter must be able to interpret both receptively and expressively.\n\nIf a sign language interpreter is required for effective communication, must only a certified interpreter be provided?\n\nNo. The key question in determining whether effective communication will result is whether the interpreter is \"qualified,\" not whether he or she has been actually certified by an official licensing body. A qualified interpreter is one \"who is able to interpret effectively, accurately and impartially, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary.\" An individual does not have to be certified in order to meet this standard. A certified interpreter may not meet this standard in all situations, e.g., where the interpreter is not familiar with the specialized vocabulary involved in the communication at issue.\n\nIII-4.3300 Examples of auxiliary aids and services.\n\nAuxiliary aids and services include a wide range of services and devices that promote effective communication. Examples of auxiliary aids and services for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing include qualified interpreters, notetakers, computer-aided transcription services, written materials, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, closed caption decoders, open and closed captioning, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), videotext displays, and exchange of written notes.\n\nExamples for individuals with vision impairments include qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, Brailled materials, large print materials, and assistance in locating items.\n\nExamples for individuals with speech impairments include TDD's, computer terminals, speech synthesizers, and communication boards.\n\nIII-4.3400 Telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDD's).\n\nIn order to ensure effective communication by telephone, a public accommodation is required to provide TDD's in certain circumstances. Because TDD relay systems required by title IV of the ADA (which must be operational by July 26, 1993) will eliminate many telephone system barriers to TDD users, the auxiliary aids requirements relating to TDD's are limited in nature.\n\nIII-4.3410 Calls incident to business operations.\n\nA public accommodation is not required to have a TDD available for receiving or making telephone calls that are part of its business operations. Even during the interim period between the effective date of title III and the date the TDD relay service becomes available, there is no requirement that public accommodations have TDD's. Of course, the ADA does not prevent a public accommodation from obtaining a TDD if, for business or other reasons, it chooses to do so.\n\nIII-4.3420 Outgoing calls by customers, clients, patients, or participants.\n\nOn the other hand, TDD's must be provided when customers, clients, patients, or participants are permitted to make outgoing calls on \"more than an incidental convenience basis.\" For example, TDD's must be made available on request to hospital patients or hotel guests where in-room phone service is provided. A hospital or hotel front desk should also be equipped with a TDD so that patients or guests using TDD's in their rooms have the same access to in-house services as other patients or guests.\n\nIII-4.3500 Closed caption decoders.\n\nHospitals that provide televisions for use by patients, and hotels, motels, and other places of lodging that provide televisions in five or more guest rooms, must provide closed caption decoder service upon request.\n\nIII-4.3600 Limitations and alternatives.\n\nA public accommodation is not required to provide any auxiliary aid or service that would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods or services offered or that would result in an undue burden.\n\nHowever, the fact that providing a particular auxiliary aid or service would result in a fundamental alteration or undue burden does not necessarily relieve a public accommodation from its obligation to ensure effective communication. The public accommodation must still provide an alternative auxiliary aid or service that would not result in an undue burden or fundamental alteration but that would ensure effective communication to the maximum extent possible, if one is available.\n\nILLUSTRATION: It may be an undue burden for a small private historic house museum on a shoestring budget to provide a sign language interpreter for a deaf individual wishing to participate in a tour. Providing a written script of the tour, however, would be an alternative that would be unlikely to result in an undue burden.\n\nWhat is a fundamental alteration?\n\nA fundamental alteration is a modification that is so significant that it alters the essential nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations offered.\n\nWhat is an undue burden?\n\n\"Undue burden\" is defined as \"significant difficulty or expense.\" Among the factors to be considered in determining whether an action would result in an undue burden are the following –\n\nThe nature and cost of the action;\n\nThe overall financial resources of the site or sites involved; the number of persons employed at the site; the effect on expenses and resources; legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation, including crime prevention measures; or any other impact of the action on the operation of the site;\n\nThe geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site or sites in question to any parent corporation or entity;\n\nIf applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity; the overall size of the parent corporation or entity with respect to the number of its employees; the number, type, and location of its facilities; and\n\nIf applicable, the type of operation or operations of any parent corporation or entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of the parent corporation or entity.\n\nDoes a public accommodation have to do more or less under the \"undue burden\" standard than under other ADA limitations such as \"undue hardship\" and \"readily achievable\"?\n\nThe definition of undue burden is identical to the definition of undue hardship used in title I of the ADA as the limitation on an employer's obligation to reasonably accommodate an applicant or employee. Under both limitations, an action is not required if it results in \"significant difficulty or expense.\" The undue burden standard, however, requires a greater level of effort by a public accommodation in providing auxiliary aids and services than does the \"readily achievable\" standard for removing barriers in existing facilities (see III-4.4200).Although \"readily achievable\" is therefore a \"lesser\" standard, the factors to be considered in determining what is readily achievable are identical to those listed above for determining undue burden.\n\nIII-4.4000 Removal of barriers\n\nIII-4.4100 General.\n\nPublic accommodations must remove architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in existing facilities, when it is readily achievable to do so.\n\nWhat is an architectural barrier?\n\nArchitectural barriers are physical elements of a facility that impede access by people with disabilities. These barriers include more than obvious impediments such as steps and curbs that prevent access by people who use wheelchairs.\n\nIn many facilities, telephones, drinking fountains, mirrors, and paper towel dispensers are mounted at a height that makes them inaccessible to people using wheelchairs. Conventional doorknobs and operating controls may impede access by people who have limited manual dexterity. Deep pile carpeting on floors and unpaved exterior ground surfaces often are a barrier to access by people who use wheelchairs and people who use other mobility aids, such as crutches. Impediments caused by the location of temporary or movable structures, such as furniture, equipment, and display racks, are also considered architectural barriers.\n\nWhat is a communication barrier that is structural in nature?\n\nCommunication barriers that are \"structural in nature\" are barriers that are an integral part of the physical structure of a facility. Examples include conventional signage, which generally is inaccessible to people who have vision impairments, and audible alarm systems, which are inaccessible to people with hearing impairments. Structural communication barriers also include the use of physical partitions that hamper the passage of sound waves between employees and customers, and the absence of adequate sound buffers in noisy areas that would reduce the extraneous noise that interferes with communication with people who have limited hearing.\n\nHow does the communication barrier removal requirement relate to the obligation to provide auxiliary aids?\n\nCommunications devices, such as TDD's, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening devices, and digital check-out displays, are not an integral part of the physical structure of the building and, therefore, are considered auxiliary aids under the Department's title III regulation. The failure to provide auxiliary aids is not a communication barrier that is structural in nature. The obligation to remove structural communications barriers is independent of any obligation to provide auxiliary aids and services.\n\nWhat is a \"facility\"?\n\nThe term \"facility\" includes all or any part of a building, structure, equipment, vehicle, site (including roads, walks, passageways, and parking lots), or other real or personal property. Both permanent and temporary facilities are subject to the barrier removal requirements.\n\nIII-4.4200 Readily achievable barrier removal.\n\nPublic accommodations are required to remove barriers only when it is \"readily achievable\" to do so.\" Readily achievable\" means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.\n\nHow does the \"readily achievable\" standard relate to other standards in the ADA?\n\nThe ADA establishes different standards for existing facilities and new construction. In existing facilities, where retrofitting may be expensive, the requirement to provide access is less stringent than it is in new construction and alterations, where accessibility can be incorporated in the initial stages of design and construction without a significant increase in cost.\n\nThis standard also requires a lesser degree of effort on the part of a public accommodation than the \"undue burden\" limitation on the auxiliary aids requirements of the ADA. In that sense, it can be characterized as a lower standard. The readily achievable standard is also less demanding than the \"undue hardship\" standard in title I, which limits the obligation to make reasonable accommodation in employment.\n\nHow does a public accommodation determine when barrier removal is readily achievable?\n\nDetermining if barrier removal is readily achievable is necessarily a case-by-case judgment. Factors to consider include:\n\nThe nature and cost of the action;\n\nThe overall financial resources of the site or sites involved; the number of persons employed at the site; the effect on expenses and resources; legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation, including crime prevention measures; or any other impact of the action on the operation of the site;\n\nThe geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site or sites in question to any parent corporation or entity;\n\nIf applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity; the overall size of the parent corporation or entity with respect to the number of its employees; the number, type, and location of its facilities; and\n\nIf applicable, the type of operation or operations of any parent corporation or entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of the parent corporation or entity.\n\nIf the public accommodation is a facility that is owned or operated by a parent entity that conducts operations at many different sites, the public accommodation must consider the resources of both the local facility and the parent entity to determine if removal of a particular barrier is \"readily achievable.\" The administrative and fiscal relationship between the local facility and the parent entity must also be considered in evaluating what resources are available for any particular act of barrier removal.\n\nWhat barriers will it be \"readily achievable\" to remove?\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question because determinations as to which barriers can be removed without much difficulty or expense must be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Department's regulation contains a list of 21 examples of modifications that may be readily achievable:\n\nInstalling ramps;\n\nMaking curb cuts in sidewalks and entrances;\n\nRepositioning shelves;\n\nRearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display racks, and other furniture;\n\nRepositioning telephones;\n\nAdding raised markings on elevator control buttons;\n\nInstalling flashing alarm lights;\n\nWidening doors;\n\nInstalling offset hinges to widen doorways;\n\nEliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative accessible path;\n\nInstalling accessible door hardware;\n\nInstalling grab bars in toilet stalls;\n\nRearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space;\n\nInsulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns;\n\nInstalling a raised toilet seat;\n\nInstalling a full-length bathroom mirror;\n\nRepositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom;\n\nCreating designated accessible parking spaces;\n\nInstalling an accessible paper cup dispenser at an existing inaccessible water fountain;\n\nRemoving high pile, low density carpeting; or\n\nInstalling vehicle hand controls.\n\nBusinesses such as restaurants may need to rearrange tables and department stores may need to adjust their layout of racks and shelves in order to permit wheelchair access, but they are not required to do so if it would result in a significant loss of selling or serving space.\n\nThe list is intended to be illustrative. Each of these modifications will be readily achievable in many instances, but not in all. Whether or not any of these measures is readily achievable is to be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular circumstances presented and the factors discussed above.\n\nAre public accommodations required to retrofit existing buildings by adding elevators?\n\nA public accommodation generally would not be required to remove a barrier to physical access posed by a flight of steps, if removal would require extensive ramping or an elevator. The readily achievable standard does not require barrier removal that requires extensive restructuring or burdensome expense. Thus, where it is not readily achievable to do, the ADA would not require a public accommodation to provide access to an area reachable only by a flight of stairs.\n\nDoes a public accommodation have an obligation to search for accessible space?\n\nA public accommodation is not required to lease space that is accessible. However, upon leasing, the barrier removal requirements for existing facilities apply. In addition, any alterations to the space must meet the accessibility requirements for alterations.\n\nDoes the ADA require barrier removal in historic buildings?\n\nYes, if it is readily achievable. However, the ADA takes into account the national interest in preserving significant historic structures. Barrier removal would not be considered \"readily achievable\" if it would threaten or destroy the historic significance of a building or facility that is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C.470, et seq.), or is designated as historic under State or local law.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: The installation of a platform lift in an historic facility that is preserved because of its unique place in American architecture, or because it is one of few surviving examples of the architecture of a particular period, would not be readily achievable, if the installation of the lift would threaten or destroy architecturally significant elements of the building.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: The installation of a ramp or lift in a facility that has historic significance because of events that have occurred there, rather than because of unique architectural characteristics, may be readily achievable, if it does not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building and is within appropriate cost constraints.\n\nDoes the ADA permit a public accommodation to consider the effect of a modification on the operation of its business?\n\nYes. The ADA permits consideration of factors other than the initial cost of the physical removal of a barrier.\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: CDE convenience store determines that it would be inexpensive to remove shelves to provide access to wheelchair users throughout the store. However, this change would result in a significant loss of selling space that would have an adverse effect on its business. In this case, the removal of the shelves is not readily achievable and, thus, is not required by the ADA.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: BCD Hardware Store provides three parking spaces for its customers. BCD determines that it would be inexpensive to restripe the parking lot to create an accessible space and reserve it for use by persons with disabilities. However, this change would reduce the available parking for individuals who do not have disabilities. The loss of parking (not just the cost of the paint for restriping) can be considered in determining whether the action is readily achievable.\n\nIII-4.4300 Standards to apply.\n\nMeasures taken to remove barriers should comply with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) contained in the appendix to the Department's rule. Barrier removal in existing facilities does not, however, trigger the accessible path of travel requirement (see III-6.2000). Deviations from ADAAG are acceptable only when full compliance with those requirements is not readily achievable. In such cases, barrier removal measures may be taken that do not fully comply with the standards, so long as the measures do not pose a significant risk to the health or safety of individuals with disabilities or others.\n\nILLUSTRATION: As a first step toward removing architectural barriers, the owner of a small shop decides to widen the shop's 26-inch wide front door. However, because of space constraints, he is unable to widen the door to the full 32-inch clearance required for alterations under ADAAG. Because full compliance with ADAAG is not readily achievable, the shop owner need not widen the door the full 32 inches but, rather, may widen the door to only 30 inches. The 30-inch door clearance does not pose a significant risk to health or safety.\n\nAre portable ramps permitted?\n\nYes, but only when the installation of a permanent ramp is not readily achievable. In order to promote safety, a portable ramp should have railings and a firm, stable, nonslip surface. It should also be properly secured.\n\nIII-4.4400 Continuing obligation.\n\nThe obligation to engage in readily achievable barrier removal is a continuing one. Over time, barrier removal that initially was not readily achievable may later be required because of changed circumstances.\n\nIf the obligation is continuing, are there any limits on what must be done?\n\nThe obligation is continuing, but not unlimited. The obligation to remove barriers will never exceed the level of access required under the alterations standard (or the new construction standard if ADAAG does not provide specific standards for alterations).\n\nILLUSTRATION 1: A 100-room hotel is removing barriers in guest accommodations. If the hotel were newly constructed, it would be required to provide five fully accessible rooms (including one with a roll-in shower) and four rooms that are equipped with visual alarms and notification devices and telephones equipped with amplification devices. A hotel that is being altered is required to provide a number of accessible rooms in the area being altered that is proportionate to the number it would be required to provide in new construction.\n\nA hotel that is engaged in barrier removal should meet this alterations standard, if it is readily achievable to do so. It is not required to exceed this level of access. Even if it is readily achievable to make more rooms accessible than would be required under the ADAAG alterations standards, once the hotel provides this level of access, it has no obligation to remove barriers in additional guest rooms.\n\nILLUSTRATION 2: A grocery store that has more than 5000 square feet of selling space and now has six inaccessible check-out aisles is assessing its obligations under the barrier removal requirement. ADAAG does not contain specific provisions applicable to the alteration of check-out aisles, but, in new construction, two of the six check-out aisles would be required to be accessible. The store is never required to provide more than two accessible check-out aisles, even if it would be readily achievable to do so.\n\nILLUSTRATION 3: An office building that houses places of public accommodation is removing barriers in common areas. If the building were newly constructed, the building would be required to contain areas of rescue assistance. However, the ADAAG alterations standard explicitly specifies that areas of rescue assistance are not required in buildings that are being altered. Because barrier removal is not required to exceed the alterations standard, the building owner need not establish areas of rescue assistance.\n\nIII-4.4500 Priorities for barrier removal.\n\nThe Department's regulation recommends priorities for removing barriers in existing facilities. Because the resources available for barrier removal may not be adequate to remove all existing barriers at any given time, the regulation suggests a way to determine which barriers should be mitigated or eliminated first. The purpose of these priorities is to facilitate long-term business planning and to maximize the degree of effective access that will result from any given level of expenditure. These priorities are not mandatory. Public accommodations are free to exercise discretion in determining the most effective \"mix\" of barrier removal measures to undertake in their facilities.\n\nThe regulation suggests that a public accommodation's first priority should be to enable individuals with disabilities to physically enter its facility. This priority on \"getting through the door\" recognizes that providing physical access to a facility from public sidewalks, public transportation, or parking is generally preferable to any alternative arrangements in terms of both business efficiency and the dignity of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe next priority is for measures that provide access to those areas of a place of public accommodation where goods and services are made available to the public. For example, in a hardware store, to the extent that it is readily achievable to do so, individuals with disabilities should be given access not only to assistance at the front desk, but also access, like that available to other customers, to the retail display areas of the store.\n\nThe third priority should be providing access to restrooms, if restrooms are provided for use by customers or clients.\n\nThe fourth priority is to remove any remaining barriers to using the public accommodation's facility by, for example, lowering telephones.\n\nMust barriers be removed in areas used only by employees?\n\nNo. The \"readily achievable\" obligation to remove barriers in existing facilities does not extend to areas of a facility that are used exclusively by employees as work areas.\n\nHow can a public accommodation decide what needs to be done?\n\nOne effective approach is to conduct a \"self-evaluation\" of the facility to identify existing barriers. The Department's regulation does not require public accommodations to conduct a self-evaluation. However, public accommodations are urged to establish procedures for an ongoing assessment of their compliance with the ADA's barrier removal requirements This process should include consultation with individuals with disabilities or organizations representing them. A serious effort at self-assessment and consultation can diminish the threat of litigation and save resources by identifying the most efficient means of providing required access.\n\nIf a public accommodation determines that its facilities have barriers that should be removed, but it is not readily achievable to undertake all of the modifications now, what should it "
