And there are things you share with the people you hold closest. They aren’t always big things; they can be as simple as a knowing glance, or a peal of laughter. But they’re the best things, because you wouldn’t trade them for the world.\n\nWe know you can’t just go out and create these things. But we’ve done our very best to bottle them. Spirits well worth gathering over. Meticulously crafted for the best of friends.\n\nLocated in the charming and picturesque town of Thompson’s Station, H Clark Distillery became Company Distilling in 2020. We craft our spirits in the same building local farmers used to house grains before loading them on the railroad for sale generations ago. It’s only fitting that our distillery is located in the same old building, using grains to create high quality spirits to Gather AroundTM.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, Middle TN, Historic Franklin\n\nAddress:\n\nCompany Distilling\n\n1557 Thompson’s Station Rd W\n\nThompson’s Station, TN 37179\n\nTelephone: 615-478-2191\n\nEmail: info@companydistilling.com\n\nWebsite: CompanyDistilling.com\n\nCorsair Distillery\n\nChildhood friends Darek Bell and Andrew Webber began home brewing beer and wine in Darek and Amy Lee Bell’s garage. They hit a snag while working on a prototype bio-diesel plant, causing Andrew to remark that making whiskey would be much more satisfying. The idea stuck, and the two soon found themselves studying distilleries and spirits. Soon after, Corsair Distillery was founded. Today, Corsair operates two distilleries in Nashville, Tennessee along with a craft malting facility, and a third distillery in downtown Bowling Green, Kentucky. Corsair focuses on producing a range of products including whiskeys, gins, absinthe, rum, vodka and brandy. Corsair’s spirits feature the use of smoked barleys, alternative grains and unusual brewing techniques not typically found in the distilling community. These innovative and adventurous spirits have been praised in publications from across the globe and have won over 150 medals at international spirits competitions.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, Middle TN, Urban Getaway\n\nAddress:\n\nCorsair Distillery & Headquarters\n\n601 Merritt Ave\n\nNashville, TN 37203\n\nCorsair Brewstillery Taproom & Tasting Room\n\n1200 Clinton St #110\n\nNashville, TN 37203\n\nTelephone: 615-200-0320\n\nEmail: info@corsairartisan.com\n\nWebsite: corsairdistillery.com\n\nCascade Hollow Distilling Co. – Home of George Dickel\n\nCascade Hollow Distilling Co. is hidden away in the Tennessee hills, surrounded by 600 protected acres of forest and crystal-fresh springs.

So, they decided to do it their way, and invest in their own abilities to select single barrels. They bought their first batch of barrels in 2018 and as word got out, groups were calling from all over the country to pick a barrel with them. In March 2021, they opened their own distillery to house it all, and now get to enjoy sharing their craft with friends, enthusiasts and TN Whiskey Trail visitors.

Our quality rums and whiskeys are distilled in copper pots and stored in 15-gallon to 53-gallon charred white oak barrels to allow for the best possible flavor.\n\nCrafting our Tennessee whiskey and rum products is a hands-on process that is a delicate mix of science and art. There are many benefits to artisan distilling in small batches. We craft our spirits in small batches, so we have complete control over each and every bottle of Prichard’s that leaves our distillery. Fermentation, distilling, aging, blending and bottling are all completed under the direct supervision of the master distiller. This type of oversight can only be maintained in small batches. It allows us to deliver the perfect flavors for our whiskeys and rums.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, Middle TN\n\nAddress:\n\nPrichard’s Distillery\n\n11 Kelso Smithland Rd\n\nKelso, TN 37348\n\nTelephone: 931-433-5454\n\nEmail: info@prichardsdistillery.com\n\nWebsite: prichardsdistillery.com\n\nShort Mountain Distillery\n\nShort Mountain has a long history in the production of some of the finest moonshine and Tennessee Spirits in the country. After the Civil War there were 18 legal distilleries in Cannon County. Distilleries were the pinnacle of the local agricultural framework, providing added value to surplus crops. In 1920, prohibition shut down the relationship between farming and distilleries, but the heritage of whiskey making lived on, no where more so than Short Mountain, Cannon County Tennessee. During this time famous Moonshiners like Cooper Melton used our farm’s cave spring to make moonshine that is said to have supplied Al Capone’s speakeasies throughout the North East.​\n\nVisitors to Short Mountain Distillery get a close up view of how real authentic Tennessee spirits are made and can taste and purchase our products as well as expect to learn about the local history of the area and our heritage of whiskey making. Visitors will also learn about our organic permaculture farm practices and also take the Cooper Cave Spring trail to see how we preserve our natural resources for generations to come.

We serve coffee in the morning and cocktails at all times at our tasting room, which has a long bar incorporating the original 1800’s horse stable from the building and numerous, cozy seating areas and tables throughout.\n\nWe offer a regularly expanding line of award-winning spirits that includes our rye whiskey, rye-based bourbon, wheated bourbon, and special single barrels.

Darrel was raised farming and building houses with his late father, Steve Lee Miller, and mother, Patsy Miller. Although his father wasn’t in the “making shine” business, he instilled the work ethic and perseverance in his children that you needed to be successful. Sadly, Steve Lee Miller passed after helping his son construct the small distillery that they use today. He never got to see his son sell a single jar legally. Darrell’s mother works by his side as often as she can and is frequently seen at Bootleggers Distillery. Although Steve didn’t have a passion for the then, illegal trade, Patsy’s family knew of nothing else. The McCoy’s were from the Jones Cove, Whilhite area of Cocke and Sevier counties. Their heritage can be traced as shiners all the way back to the Mayflower.\n\nBootleggers Distillery is as what is believed to be the smallest batch distillery in the nation. Bootleggers Distillery continues to do it the way they have for hundreds of years. We do not brew in hundred or even thousand gallon tanks. We brew in 25 gallon pot stills so that we can maintain a closer more regulated quality. “The smaller the batch, the more control you have over the product. I will never do it any other way.” says Darrell Miller.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, East TN, Moonshine Mayhem, Outdoor Adventurer\n\nAddress:\n\nBootleggers Distillery\n\n3567 Hartford Rd\n\nHartford, TN 37753\n\nTelephone: 865-323-5444\n\nEmail: darrell@darrellmiller.net\n\nWebsite: bootleggersdistillery.com\n\nBrushy Mountain Distillery\n\nBrushy Mountain held some of the country’s most dangerous criminals. But the one thing that struck fear into their heartless souls was the day they heard that colossal iron gate slam shut behind ’em! For that day, they knew they’d reached the “end of the line.” What better name to give our Historic Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary distilled and bottled spirit… than End Of The Line Tennessee Moonshine.\n\nWe know you’ll find it downright enjoyable, so raise a glass to the End Of The Line with us. None have the rather dark and colorful history associated with their name. And not a one of ’em is distilled and bottled on the grounds of a former maximum-security prison. Not to mention the foreboding and hair-raising tales that haunt these stone-cold prison walls.\n\nGiven Brushy’s history and the historic backwoods, one-step-ahead-of-the-law reputation of Moonshine, we knew this was the perfect backdrop to begin producing “End of The Line” Moonshine. From farm to still, we use local grains and water from the mountains’ natural springs found right behind the prison’s walls.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, East TN, Moonshine Mayhem\n\nAddress:\n\nBrushy Mountain Distillery\n\n9182 Hwy 116\n\nPetros, TN 37845\n\nTelephone: 423-324-8687\n\nWebsite: brushymoonshine.com\n\nChattanooga Whiskey Distillery\n\nLocated in the heart of downtown Chattanooga, the Chattanooga Whiskey Experimental Distillery is the first legal distillery in Chattanooga in over 100 years.

The US Government did not respond to this cession and the residents of this area decided that they would secede from North Carolina with the intent of becoming the 14th state in the new United States of America. From 1784 to 1788 the unrecognized state existed, known as the State of Franklin, until it was reclaimed by North Carolina.\n\nLike the State of Franklin, Lost State Distilling aim to break away from industrialized spirit production and focus on crafting small batch spirits using locally sourced ingredients. Lost State Distilling is located on State Street in downtown Bristol Tennessee next to the iconic Bristol TN/VA sign, producing Rum, Gin, and Tennessee Whiskey.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, East TN\n\nAddress:\n\nLost State Distillery\n\n200 State Street\n\nBristol, TN 37620\n\nTelephone: 423-797-4432\n\nEmail: info@loststatedistilling.com\n\nWebsite: www.loststatedistilling.com\n\nOld Forge Distillery\n\nNestled in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, Old Forge Distillery hand forges small-batch Tennessee spirits including award-winning moonshines, cream liqueurs, bourbon, vodka, barrel aged gin, and rum. Located in the heart of the historic Old Mill Square in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Old Forge crafts spirits using stone-ground grains from The Old Mill, one of the oldest continually operated gristmills in America.\n\nInside the distillery, Head Distiller Keener Shanton uses freshly ground grain from the mill and pure mountain spring water to craft his award-winning small batch spirits including 1830 Original Moonshine, named after the year The Old Mill was built. Keeping true to the area, Shanton draws his inspiration for his flavored moonshines, like Chocolate, French Toast, Coffee and Peach, from the nearby Old Mill Kitchens.\n\nKnown for its heritage and focus on innovation, Old Forge Distillery is more than just moonshine.

With one foot firmly planted in the past and the other in these modern times, the Still House is where our delicious Sugarlands Shine is made.\n\nOur artisanal stone mill grinds grains like corn and rye into meal that is then mixed with pure Smoky Mountain water and is then moved to our giant cooker. From there, the liquid is transferred to the fermenter to simmer for a few days. When the time is right that “mash” is pumped into the copper pot still where it is heated and distilled. The alcohol vapor filters through the copper pipes and rises up through the plates of the distillation column, down through the chilling column to cool and is finally poured out of the Spirit Safe.\n\nTrip Ideas Featuring this Distillery: Complete Trail, East TN, Moonshine Mayhem\n\nAddress:\n\nSugarlands Distilling Co.\n\n805 Parkway\n\nGatlinburg, TN 37738\n\nTelephone: 865-325-1355\n\nEmail: info@sugarlandsdistilling.com\n\nWebsite: sugarlandsdistilling.com\n\nTennessee Legend Distillery\n\nGrowing up in the Smoky Mountains, we spent our whole lives hearing stories.
