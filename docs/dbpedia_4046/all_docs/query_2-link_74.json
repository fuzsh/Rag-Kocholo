Policy guidance for this plan came from the 2002 Prince George's County Approved General Plan. The approved plan updates the 1992 Historic Sites and Districts Plan by including additions to historic sites and resources and a set of goals, policies, and strategies to guide future preservation planning efforts. The plan also contains an initial set of implementation priorities and a proposal for a strategic plan of implementation. Appendices provide updated county and community histories; a summary of historic themes; and lists of cemeteries, organizations, and sources of additional information."
