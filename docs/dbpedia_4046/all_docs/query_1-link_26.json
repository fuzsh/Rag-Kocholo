The district is especially notable for its collection of native stone commercial buildings, although it contains examples of other construction materials as well. The 47 elements of the district are all buildings constructed during the past 130 years. They are arrayed along Main Street and adjacent streets in downtown St. Helena. Nearly all are in retail use, though some have auxiliary uses as well. The district includes 34 elements that contribute to its historic character and 13 that do not contribute. The integrity of the district is high due to the concentration of resources, the size and importance of the contributors, and the inconspicuousness of non-contributors.\n\nThe district centers on Main Street, which extends northwest and southeast for two blocks. All but eight of the district’s buildings front the street. The terrain of the district is flat. The west side of Main Street appears as one expanse of commercial buildings because of a narrow walkway rather than an intersection separates the blocks. Trees line the street. They share the sidewalk with a set of three-globed cast-iron streetlamps that were installed in 1914.\n\nSimilarity of function helps to define the visual character of the district. Retailing provides the main use of nearly all the buildings in the district. About four-fifths are used exclusively to provide goods and services to retail customers. A few have only office space, and the rest mix retail use on the ground floor with offices, apartments, or other uses above. The design of the buildings attracts customers on foot. Except for a gas station and the alley building, all extend to their lot lines on each side and front the sidewalk directly with no intervening setbacks. Some buildings share commons walls. Most have only one story, and none reaches above two. Generally, roof lines are not conspicuous, because roofs are flat or hidden by parapets. Most of the storefronts contain recessed entrances and flanking display windows. Two of the buildings along Railroad Avenue originally had industrial uses and were later converted to offices.\n\nWithin the overall uniformity of the district, the individual buildings vary in several respects. Many types of walls and wall finishes are visible: stone, brick, stucco, terra cotta, corrugated metal, and board. Stucco is probably the most popular, especially on non-contributors. Detailing on contributing buildings varies from profuse to minimal. The most common motifs have classical inspiration and include bracketed cornices, dentil and belt courses, and pilasters. Parapets run from plain and rectangular to stepped and ornamented.\n\nThe district provides few examples of architectural styles. Some of the buildings with classical ornamentation allow categorization as Italianate, Colonial Revival, and Second Renaissance Revival. Most buildings are without stylistic aspirations. They represent their periods of construction or remodeling through detailing, especially window treatment.\n\nStone construction characterizes many of the district’s buildings. Fifteen use cut native stone for some or all their walls. With rare exceptions the stones making up a wall have different sizes and shapes. They seldom form regular courses and often are not aligned at all. The stones are usually pitch-faced rather than smooth. Some buildings combine masonry techniques, using standard bricks for the walls on the street elevations and stone elsewhere.\n\nMany buildings have undergone alterations over the years. The first story porches, which once covered the sidewalks on Main Street, have disappeared. Many original storefronts have been modernized. Often this change has involved the use of metal framed windows instead of the original wood and the covering or remodeling of clerestory bands. In addition, many parapet walls have received stucco coatings. About a dozen buildings, notably those in the 1200-block of Main Street, have lost all or nearly all their historic detailing.\n\nThe district’s contributors retain historic materials and design elements above the storefront. Usually these are original, though some represent alterations made before 1948. Contributors are larger and more conspicuous than non-contributors. Of the district’s eleven two-story buildings, ten contribute to its historic character. Non-contributors are nearly always old buildings that have suffered severe alterations. Only three structures in the district date from after World War II. By the same token, nearly all the buildings within the district in 1947 remain today. The major losses are a retail building on Main Street, two automobile facilities on Railroad Avenue, and a streamline modern gas station that was located at the corner of Main Street and Adams Street.\n\nThe district has major contributors distributed throughout. At the south edge of the district are the William Tell Hotel, listed in the National Register, and the Noble Building, which features a classical entrance portico with stone columns. Up the block is the Hunt Building, which displays the use of stone for ornamentation as well as walls. Across the street is the Hotel St. Helena, the district’s largest wood-frame building. Further north is the Richie Block, the district’s most elaborately detailed building, which features a central tower and a second story balcony that connects a trio of box windows. It faces the carefully composed classical facade of the St. Helena Star Building. To the north is the Italianate Odd Fellows’ Hall, which like the Richie Block uses brick on the front elevation and stone for the side and rear walls. On the corner of Main Street and Adams Street the brick Kellewell Building with its high stepped parapet marks the edge of the district. On Railroad Avenue are two large stone buildings that originally had industrial uses.\n\nAreas of distinctly different character bound the district. To the south a scattering of recent commercial buildings continues Main Street for several blocks. Oak Avenue on the west has a collection of detached buildings in a variety of uses. Among them is the Carnegie Library, already listed in the National Register. The eastern boundary is clearly marked by Railroad Avenue and the railroad tracks beyond. On the north is another mix of buildings leading to a residential area. The boundaries follow (with one exception) contiguous parcel lines and encompass nearly all of St. Helena’s pre-1948 commercial buildings.\n\nThe district retains a high degree of integrity. Contributing to the feeling of a traditional downtown area the arrangement of the buildings, which are immediately contiguous and front the sidewalk, the predominance of retail uses, the uniformity of scale, and the retention of original design and fabric, especially above the storefronts. Despite substantial remodeling to several buildings, the district has maintained its historic character.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\nThe St. Helena Historic Commercial District represents the development of commercial architecture in the City from around 1870 to after the end of the Second World War. The district provides Napa County’s largest collection of commercial buildings constructed before 1948. It is notable also for the uniformity of scale of the buildings, none of which exceeds two stories, and the widespread use of stone construction. Although the district has changed its appearance somewhat since 1947, it retains a high degree of architectural integrity and maintains its associations to the historic period.\n\nCommercial construction proceeded in four phases. The earliest coincided with the settling of the town in the 1850s. J.H. Still, who owned much of what became downtown St. Helena, put up the first store in 1853. To promote the new town, he offered free lots to other merchants. As white settlement moved up the Napa Valley, a small but growing group of businessmen saw that St. Helena had excellent long-term prospects as a commercial center. They took Still up on his offer and began construction buildings for retail goods and services. The first may have been John Kister, who put up two stores at the corner of Main and Spring Streets in 1855. The town’s first hotel opened the same year. By 1860 St. Helena had two general stores, a saddlery, a blacksmith shop, and a shoe repair business. The early commercial buildings were not built to last, however. With milled lumber rare and expensive and expert builders unavailable, merchants could only put-up buildings that were crudely constructed of rough redwood. None of these buildings remain today.\n\nIn the next twenty years the district expanded Main Street. It also took on a neater and more prosperous appearance as skillfully constructed buildings replaced earlier structures. This phase of commercial construction marked the arrival of one- and two-story buildings framed and sided with milled redwood. They usually had gable roofs, flat parapets, and porches that covered the sidewalks in front. Storefronts featured clerestory bands, recessed entrances, and flanking display windows. The expansion and improvement of the district reflected the growth of local agriculture, which was spurred by the arrival of the railroad from Napa in 1868. Local ranches, whether they specialized in grain, orchard crops, or dairying, used St. Helena as a shipping point and shopping center. By 1880 the town had a wide array of retail businesses and had established itself as the second most important commercial center in Napa County. Over a dozen buildings from this period remain in the district, although all have undergone stuccoing, storefront changes, or other modifications. One of them, the William Tell Hotel, is already listed in the National Register.\n\nThe use of native stone defined the third phase of commercial construction, which lasted from the mid-1880s to after the turn of the century. Stone gained popularity not only because it was more fire-resistant and visually imposing than wood, but because it was less expensive as well. Its appearance within the district coincided with the development of local viticulture and the establishment of major wineries near St. Helena. Winemaking made the community more prosperous and the business district more profitable. The vineyards also pioneered the use of stone, especially for storage facilities. Local immigrant stonemasons transferred their skills to commercial buildings. To keep costs low they usually made no attempt to square the sides of the stones, smoothly dress their surfaces, or lay them in straight courses. The two stone buildings on Railroad Avenue and Adams Street’s, constructed in 1884 and 1906, provided early and late examples. When a client wanted a more uniform look, as in the Richie Block (1892), standard bricks were used on the street elevations. In the hands of skillful designers, however, stonework enhanced the authenticity of classical references. William H. Corlett’s St. Helena Star Building (1900) provided the clearest example. Although the new stone buildings were usually larger than wood structures nearby, they did not change the pedestrian orientation of the district, which continues to be characterized by an uninterrupted expanse of adjacent storefronts.\n\nTwo trends marked the final phase of construction in the district, which extended from around 1910 to 1947. One was continued replacement of earlier buildings with more modern structures. About a dozen new buildings appeared in the district. The design was not much different, with parapets, clerestory bands, recessed entries, and display windows. Standard bricks were used in construction. The new buildings, all one-story, fit seamlessly into the district. The second trend was façade modernization. The most typical changes involved the removal of front porches, the stuccoing of parapets, and the replacement of storefront windows. An early alteration to several storefronts was the installation of metal widow frames embossed with a fretwork design. The comparative lack of construction in this period reflected the stagnancy of the local economy, hit first by prohibition, then the Great Depression, followed by World War II.\n\nThe district’s period of significance includes the time during which the developments discussed above occurred and from which resources remain. The opening date of 1870, an approximation represents the construction of the district’s earliest remaining buildings. The closing date in 1947 indicates that architectural developments of the historic period, especially storefront remodeling, have continued to the present time but have no exceptional significance. The district reflects the period through a large collection of contributing buildings that retain their architectural integrity and were constructed between 1870 and 1947.\n\nThe district retains historic and architectural cohesiveness in several ways. First, it contains a high proportion of contributing buildings, with nearly two-thirds of the total falling in this category. Second, as a group, contributors are larger and more conspicuous than non-contributors. Only one two-story building falls in the latter category, for example. Further, the contributors on Main Street, although constructed over 75 or 80 years, share two important characteristics. They extended to the parcel lines in the front and on the sides, and they have storefronts with recessed entrances and flanking display windows. None has more than two stories. In addition, because many non-contributors share these attributes, the district retains an overall coherence that is greater than might be expected through an analysis of its components. Although the southern border has eroded somewhat, the historic commercial area is clearly bordered by newer buildings and other uses. Also, the street pattern has remained unchanged since around 1890, although the alley west of Main was straightened after 1947. The streetlamps (electroliers) were installed in 1914 and add a pleasing touch.\n\nSome aspects of the district intrude upon its historic character. Several buildings, although they still fit downtown, have lost much of their original detailing that they no longer convey their historic associations. In addition, several contributors have undergone storefront modifications out of keeping with their original designs. The ambience has also changed somewhere since 1947 with the arrival of trendier businesses (restaurants, upscale shops, antique stores) that appeal to “wine country” visitors. Despite the changes, the district has retained the feeling of a pedestrian-oriented retail center.\n\nThe architectural importance of the district is clear when compared with commercial areas of other cities in Napa County. The downtown area of Napa, which is larger than St. Helena’s, has lost much of its historic character through new construction and redevelopment. The commercial areas of Calistoga and Yountville, while dating from the nineteenth century are much smaller than the one in St. Helena and contain far fewer buildings of architectural distinction. Although statewide importance is not claimed for the district, few commercial areas in the state are likely to retain such coherence of scale or include so many stone buildings. The St. Helena Historic Commercial District is architecturally significant because it maintains its association with the development of the City’s commercial architecture from the 1870s to the 1940s and retains its essential appearance from 50 years ago."
