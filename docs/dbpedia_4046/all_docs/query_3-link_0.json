        "text": "The National Park Service administers the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official Federal list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. National Register properties have significance to the history of their community state, or the nation. Nominations for listing historic properties come from State Historic Preservation Officers, from Federal Preservation Officers for properties owned or controlled by the United States Government, and from Tribal Historic Preservation Officers for properties on Tribal lands. Private individuals and organizations, local governments, and American Indian tribes often initiate this process and prepare the necessary documentation. A professional review board in each state considers each property proposed for listing and makes a recommendation on its eligibility. National Historic Landmarks are a separate designation, but upon designation, NHLs are listed in the National Register of Historic Places if not already listed.\n\nYou can find more information in our What is the National Register of Historic Places section. You can find more information on the National Historic Landmarks program at their website.\n\nUnder Federal Law, the listing of a property in the National Register places no restrictions on what a non-federal owner may do with their property up to and including destruction, unless the property is involved in a project that receives Federal assistance, usually funding or licensing/permitting.\n\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c5a07c14e9b695af2ef0cae29b4b4f23&mc=true&node=pt36.1.60&rgn=div5\n\nThere may be state or local preservation laws that a property owner should be aware of before they undertake a project with a historic property. We recommend you, or the property owner contact the State historic preservation office (SHPO) before an action with a listed property is taken. The SHPO is the state agency that oversees historic preservation efforts in their state.You can find contact information for the SHPOs here.\n\nIf Federal monies are attached to the property then any changes to the property have to allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (www.achp.gov) to comment on the project.You can also read a copy of the National Register of Historic Places code of Federal regulations at: https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c5a07c14e9b695af2ef0cae29b4b4f23&mc=true&node=pt36.1.60&rgn=div5\n\nYou can also find general information for owners here.\n\nMore information about historic preservation including additional laws and regulations\n\nMany sites listed in the National Register arrange for a commemorative plaque. Unfortunately the National Register of Historic Places does not issue plaques as a result of listing; rather we leave it up to the individual owners if they are interested in having one. If you do not have a local trophy/plaque store that you prefer, we know of several companies that advertise in Preservation Magazine that offer the type of plaques that you may be interested in. We recommend that you contact your State historic preservation office to see if they have a preferred plaque style or wording. We are not endorsing, authorizing, recommending, or implying any connection to any one company over another, including any company not listed here. We are merely aware that these companies sell plaques. Properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are not required to have plaques.\n\nAll-Craft Wellman Products, Inc.\n\n4839 East 345th Street\n\nWilloughby, OH 44094\n\nwww.all-craftwellman.com\n\nPhone: 800-340-3899\n\nFax: 440-946-9648\n\nAmerican Sign Letters\n\n8140 Evernia St, Unit 1\n\nMicco, FL 32976\n\nhttps://americansignletters.com\n\nPhone: 877-704-5170\n\nArista Trophies & Awards\n\n25 Portland Avenue\n\nBergenfield, NJ 07621\n\np 201 387-2165\n\nf 201 387-0955\n\nhttp://www.aristatrophies.com/\n\nAtlas Signs and Plaques\n\nEnterprise Drive\n\nLake Mills, WI 53551\n\n920-648-5647\n\nhttp://www.atlassignsandplaques.com\n\nArtistic Bronze\n\n13867 NORTHWEST 19TH AVENUE\n\nMIAMI, FLORIDA 33054\n\n800.330.PLAK (7525) 305.681.2876 FAX\n\nhttp://www.artisticbronze.com/\n\nBlue Pond Signs\n\n4460 Redwood Hwy #9\n\nSan Rafael, CA 94903\n\nPhone: (415) 507-0447\n\nFax: (415) 507-0451\n\nhttp://www.bluepondsigns.com/custom-plaques.html\n\nCerametallics a divison of Meridian Tile Products\n\n101 S. 30th Street Phoenix AZ 85034\n\n602-237-6401\n\nwww.cerametallics.com\n\nClassic Bronze Resources, LLC\n\n4628 Whispering Oak Trail\n\nCincinnati, OH 45247\n\nPhone: 513-600-9048\n\nwww.classicbronzeresources.com\n\nEagle Sign & Design Inc.\n\n901 E.
