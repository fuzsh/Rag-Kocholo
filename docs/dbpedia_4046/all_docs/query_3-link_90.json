        "text": "Apply now to submit your F-1 visa international application. Once submitted, supporting documents can be scanned and emailed. An international admissions advisor will contact you via email within four business days of your application submission\n\nNote: You must be at least 18 years old by the first day of class.\n\nAdmission to FSCJ as an international student does not guarantee admission into a selective/limited access program or a bachelor's program. Additionally, students must have earned an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree or an Associate in Science (A.S.) degree (60 college-level credits) from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university or, if foreign, the equivalent of an associate degree from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university, prior to applying for a bachelor's degree program. Please consult International Student Services for a list of eligible selective/limited access or bachelor’s programs for F1 international students.\n\nNote: International students are not eligible to apply for all of the programs of study. Please ask International Student Services staff before you select your program of study.\n\nWhat is an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree?\n\nThe Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree is a two-year degree in general education. Students who complete this degree often transition into a bachelor’s degree program. Students must choose a major/program of study while completing their first two terms of the A.A. degree. The major/program of study will help an advisor determine which courses a student will need before they can transition in a bachelor's degree program either at FSCJ or a university.\n\nFor example, a student majoring in business will need to complete the general education part of the A.A. degree, plus the required courses of Business Calculus, Statistics, Economics 1 and 2, Accounting 1 and 2, and a computer course.\n\nFor international students, the Associate in Science (A.S.) degree is not as flexible as the A.A. degree. There are fewer A.S. degrees at FSCJ that are open to international students because many are offered mostly online and in 7-week sessions. International students are required to take the majority of their courses in a face-to-face environment and in a 15- or 12-week format.\n\nSubmit the Certificate of Financial Responsibility and Affidavit of Support with the required acceptable financial documentation to demonstrate that you can cover estimated living expenses (listed below) while you’re attending school.\n\nGuide to acceptable financial documentation Acceptable Evidence of Financial Support:\n\nUnacceptable financial documents:\n\nBank statements on letterhead with required signature/stamp\n\nScholarship letters\n\nLines of credit\n\nGovernmental funding\n\nChartered accountant statements\n\nPayroll reports/expected income\n\nTax statements and W-2s\n\nProperty assessments\n\nCredit cards\n\nBank statements lacking currency amounts\n\nOther statements of non-liquid assets\n\nImportant Note Regarding Financial Documentation\n\nAll financial documentation must be less than six months old. Financial support may be from your own resources or from a sponsor.\n\nEstimated Living Expenses for an International Student\n\nInternational students are admitted with the understanding that adequate finances are available during their period of study in the United States. The support may be from the individual’s own sources or from sponsors in this country or from abroad. In general, scholarships are not available to international students. The College may require, based on certain conditions or circumstances within a country, that a predetermined amount of money be on deposit in the United States to cover a student’s expenses for one year.\n\nAverage cost estimated for one year for an A.A. or A.S. degree (effective Fall Term 2019):\n\nTuition (30 credit hours X $401.27)\n\n$12,000\n\nTotal Estimated Tuition\n\n$12,000\n\nBooks (30 credit hours X $40)\n\n$1,200\n\nElectricity (12 months X $75)\n\n$900\n\nApartment Rent (12 months X $600)\n\n$7,200\n\nFood (12 months $150)\n\n$1,800\n\nTransportation (monthly student bus pass)\n\n$450\n\nHealth Insurance (Amount varies on coverage)\n\n$450\n\nTotal Estimated Living Expenses\n\n$12,000\n\nTotal Estimated Cost\n\n$24,000\n\nAdditional cost per dependent is $6,000.\n\nNote: Tuition and fees are subject to change without prior notice. Students on an F-1 student visa are NOT eligible for in-state tuition rates."
