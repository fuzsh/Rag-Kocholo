Seven young victims of the occupation. Three Israeli settler children, who have never known any life but that of settlers at the religious-nationalist settlement of Itamar on the West Bank, killed by an armed Palestinian breaking in. Four Palestinian children, born into life under occupation at Jenin, killed by the shell of an occupying Israeli tank. Two societies locked in a terrible struggle: Israelis, living under the shadow of the sucide bombings, feeling little and no empathy for the Palestinian suffering; an Israeli cabinet launching once again a massive invasion of the Palestinian cities, with the very ministers who voted for the measure knowing it to be futile; desperate Palestinians regarding suicide bombings as the one way of getting back at their oppressors - despite the obvious way these bombings play into Sharon's hands, despite the increasingly vocal opposition to the bombings inside the Palestinian society itself. The present situation is eroding and destroying two societies. [2] Without peace, death reigns supreme [Gush Shalom in weekly ad] WITHOUT PEACE, DEATH REIGNS SUPREME Peace has a price. We all know it: ending the occupation, dismantling the settlements and establishing the Palestinian state. But the price of the occupation is far higher: blood and bereavement without end. A band of bankrupt politicians, generals and police commanders is trying to hide their failure by inventing new tricks every week: fences, obstacles, trenches, incursions, executions, closures, blockades, Jerusalem Envelope. After the failure of Defensive Shield, they now propose Defensive Shield Plus. Tricks will not help: without the hope of peace, death will continue to reign.

Gush Shalom ad published in Ha'aretz, June 21, 2002 [3] Stop Suicide Bombings (the appeal by Palestinian public figures) ------- Forwarded message follows ------- Date sent: Thu, 20 Jun 2002 15:15:24 +0200 From: \"MIFTAH\" <miftah at miftah.org> Urgent Appeal to Stop Suicide Bombings We the undersigned feel that it is our national responsibility to issue this appeal in light of the dangerous situation engulfing the Palestinian people. We call upon the parties behind military operations targeting civilians in Israel to reconsider their policies and stop driving our young men to carry out these operations. Suicide bombings deepen the hatred and widen the gap between the Palestinian and Israeli people. Also, they destroy the possibilities of peaceful co-existence between them in two neighboring states. We see that these bombings do not contribute towards achieving our national project that calls for freedom and independence. On the contrary, they strengthen the enemies of peace on the Israeli side and give Israels aggressive government under Sharon the excuse to continue its harsh war against our people. This war targets our children, elderly, villages, cities, and our national hopes and achievements. Military action is viewed are not assessed as positive or negative exclusively out of the general context and situation. They assessed based on whether they fulfill political ends. Therefore, there is a need to re- evaluate these acts considering that pushing the area towards an existential war between the two people living on the holy land will lead to destruction for the whole region. We do not find any logical, humane, or political justification for this end result.

(res.) Guy Rozin, (Military ID 3777618) was sentenced on June 16 to 28 days. Guy Rozin (28), an independent caterer from Tel Aviv, is the brother of refusenik Eyal Rozin; he is married with 2 children. Guy was called to duty in the April emergency call-up. On reporting, he told his superiors he refused to serve in the territories, and was sent home. Some days later, his officers contacted him and tried to talk him into joining the unit at Psagot. Guy reiterated his refusal to serve in the territories, though adding that he'd consider an alternative posting. Last Thursday his unit made contact to notify him he was a deserter and would stand trial for that offence. At his trial on Sunday, Guy did not admit the desertion charge, but was found guilty and sent to jail. He has appealed his sentence but has received no reply to date. Also sentenced to 14 days in Military Prison 4 on June 17 was R.B.N. (at his request, his name and particulars are withheld). Guy's address: First Sgt. (res.) Guy Rozin, (Military ID 3777618) Military Prison 4 Military Postal No. 02507, IDF, Israel Guy can also be contacted via: daphna_r at zahav.net.il Currently serving prison sentences are 9 refuseniks of different categories. This is a significant number, though it marks a reduction from the record total of 69 jailed in April, when \"Operation Defensive Shield\" involved a massive emergency call-up of reservists. After a series of contradictory statements by IDF spokesmen, it now seems that the current offensive in the occupied territories does after all involve a renewed call-up of reserve units, and a further wave of refusals can be expected.

It began with aerial bombing from Apache helicopters followed by shelling from approximately 50 tanks that lasted until 7am June 19th. The Israeli army proceeded from house to house, making arrests, looting and vandalizing stores, and trashing and exploding houses. Caoimhe Butterly from Ireland saw injuries from severe beatings, including of children as young as 13. Men were bound hand and foot. Caoimhe herself was beaten twice, called a \"Nazi Cow\" and an \"Arab fucker\" for \"helping Palestinian terrorists.\" Late on the 19th, the Army announced from the tanks that all men between 15-50 years of age were to report to a school in Jenin. Between 2000-2500 men went to the school where soldiers detained, strip searched, and left them under guard on the main street. Among those detained were:! a man in a wheelchair, a blind man, a man on crutches, a man with severe mental illness, and several children under 15 years of age. Many detainees were never given time to get their ID papers; they are in a very precarious situation as a result. Soldiers took these men to Salam military base and released some of them to Romnaneh and Burkeen, telling them not to return to Jenin until Saturday. The Army is still in Jenin destroying houses. They have exploded 12 houses after evacuating the families. Five bulldozers are at the outskirts of the city and have already damaged a school. The camp's population is now women, children, and elderly. Ambulances are being blocked. The Israeli Army has cut water, electricity, and telephone lines in the camp. The Army is beginning to repeat in Jenin city what it has doen in the camp, going house to house and rounding up the men as well as shelling sporadically. One so! ldier is walking the streets beating people with a baton. The Army also invaded Bethlehem this morning at 4am, imposed a curfew, and is starting to go house to house.

NO PRECEDENTIAL DECISION REGARDING ISRAEL'S RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS HEALTH CARE IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES WAS REACHED. On June 11th, 2002, the High Court ruled in the case of four and a half year old Shams A-Din Tabia from Jericho who is in dire need of medical treatment that cannot be obtained in the Occupied Territories. The Court decided that an Israeli hospital would accept the Palestinian Authority's commitment for payment for the boy's life-saving medical treatment in Israel. Once the commitment is received the boy can begin treatment for his disease at the Sha'are Zedek Medical Center in West Jerusalem. (Please see previous press release below for further details) Over the past few days arrangements for the provision of the commitment for payment by the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah were impeded due to the curfew that has been imposed upon the city. The commitment did arrive today, June 17th, from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. We wish the best for Shams A-Din and hope for his speedy recovery. While this case has helped one little boy, it has not solved the larger issue at hand. The High Court of Justice refused to take this opportunity to make a precedential ruling that would determine the nature of Israel's responsibility for the well-being of Palestinians under its control. Israel's approach towards provision of healthcare to the Palestinian population has been inconsistent at best, and the crucial question remains: what are the moral ramifications when Israel maintains control over the Palestinian community in the Occupied Territories but at the same time shrugs off its responsibility to ensure provision of services to the occupied population? For further analysis of this case please see Gideon Levy's article in Ha'aretz, June 16th, 2002. www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=176667&contrassID=2&subC ontrassID=4&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y *** PHRIsrael in an Urgent Appeal to the High Court of Justice: The State of Israel is Obligated to Provide Medical Care for a Palestinian Child with a Life-Threatening Disease. PRESS RELEASE June .9th, 2002 Four and a half year old Shams A-Din Tabia from Jericho suffers from a life threatening disease for which he cannot receive medical treatment in the Occupied Territories. Suffering from x-linked limphoproliferative disorder, the same kind of cancer from which his brother died nine years ago at the age of three, Shams must receive chemotherapy treatment promptly. There exists no hospital in the Occupied Territories that can provide adequate treatment for a child with this rare and dangerous disease. Prof. Abrahamov from the Children's Oncology Department at the Sha'are Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem is willing and able, after having examined the child, to provide him with the necessary medical treatment. But who is to pay? PHR-Israel, having approached the Civil Administration on June 5th, 2002 and having received no satisfactory reply, has today, June 9th, 2002, filed a petition to the High Court of Justice to cover medical expenses that will be accrued during treatments, Shams will not receive treatment if his expenses are not covered. In its petition, PHR-Israel quotes section 16 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and High Court ruling 2936/02 which states: \" However, the State emphasizes that the IDF sees itself as committed to fulfilling the rules of Humanitarian Law not only because these ensue from the rulings of International Law, but also for moral and utilitarian considerations\" (transl. PHR-Israel) It is PHR-Israel's belief that Israel is responsible for the well-being of this child as an occupying power and that it has a moral and legal obligation to provide this child with the necessary medical treatment, particularly in a case such as this, where the treatment is a life-saving one . We await the Court's ruling. [10] Two exhibitions at Givat Haviva ----- Forwarded message follows ------- From: \"Mohammad Darawshe\" <dovergh at inter.net.il> Date sent: Tue, 18 Jun 2002 05:51:23 +0200 Exhibition -Conclusion of Two Projects \"The Language of the Land\" & \"Through Others' Eyes\" 25 June 2002 at 17:00 at The Arts Center, Givat Haviva Under the Auspices of: Ms. Yvonne Silverman - Chair of the Board of Givat Haviva Educational Foundation - USA Arab and Jewish Mayors and dignitaries * \"The Language of the Land\" is a unique educational project which deals with encounters between Jewish and Arab youth through the arts. Art in all its forms is a direct means and tool for bridging gaps and cultures, and bringing people together through joint activity. In this project, a meetinghouse based on a geodesic dome with walls of earth was built by the youth. The issue of \"land\" is a key issue, symbolizing disagreement in the Middle East conflict, but on the other hand, in this project, it comprises a good connection and means of fostering dialogue. The meetinghouse will serve as a hut to host encounters between Arabs and Jews seeking dialogue and understanding, working to build a common future built on acceptance, justice, and cooperation. * \"Through Others' Eyes\" exhibit reflects the cooperative work of Jewish and Arab youth, from Kafr Qare' and Mevo'ot Irron schools. They used cameras to learn photography while documenting the lives of the other. At the beginning the youth photographed each other, and then each other's homes and environment. This gave them anopportunity to get aquainted with the families and lives of what was previously considered a hostile community. The project helped the students to learn first hand how to perceive the other.

The following provisory translation is therefore my own - rh. 90% Ready to leave (Akiva Eldar, Haaretz [hebrew only], 18.6.2002) Minister Affe Eitam accused the other day the initiators of the security fence of \"forsaking the security of 200.000 Israelis\" living on its eastern side. But a research conducted in the past year may actually imply that it is Eitam and a negligable minority of \"ideological settlers\" who forsake the security of most of the Israeli citizens living in the West Bank. According to the research, which is due to be published in the coming weeks, less than 10% of the settlers in the territories, i.e. less than 5,000 families, replied negatively to the question whether they would be ready to return to Israel for a reasonable compensation. What is meant is a sum of money that will enable them to purchase a reasonable flat in central Israel. When this research is published, the Israeli public will understand that the government holds hostage more than 180.000 people. At the end of 1993, short after the signing of the Oslo accord, Knesset Member Yossi Katz (Labour) initiated a compensation plan for settlers who expressed their wish to evacuate their homes. Katz says it was a reaction to the requests of many families who had moved to the territories for reasons of \"quality of life\". Thanks to Katz plan, several hundred familis who then returned to the Green Line received 800 NIS [$200] a month as rent aid. In 1999, after a big Knesset majority had vetoed law proposals to compensate the settlers, KM Anat Maor [Meretz] decided to try once more. She got the idea from an approach of the settlers of Rimonim. KM Chaim Ramon, initiator of the idea of evacuating the settlers who live outside the \"blocks\" near the Green Line, as well as the rest of his colleagues of Labour, did not give a hand to Maor's proposal. Ramon says that private law proposals are not a suitable airstrip for this kind of initiatives. Nevertheless, he would bless his representatives in the cabinet if they initiate a plan to rehabilitate settlers that the only thing keeping them in the territories is the mortgage on a house that no one wants to buy from them. A letter sent last month to research institutes that seek solutions for the problem of Palestinian refugees and Israeli settlers indicates that the issue bothers the American administration too. In her letter, Meredith Lobel [sp.?] of the research department of ASHOKA, specialising in social and communital initiatives world-wide, writes that \"senior government officials who deal with the peace process\" asked the head of the institute, William Driton [sp.?], to present helpful ideas. ASHOKA is now working on a sort of \"rehabilitation package for the heroes of peace\". Alongside with assistance in housing, education andemployment, the plan suggests turning the refugees and the settlers from the victims of peace to its flagbearers.
