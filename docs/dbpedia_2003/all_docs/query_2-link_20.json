        "text": "GAZA CITY -- Two Palestinians, one a 13-year-old boy, were killed Friday during an Israeli incursion in the Gaza Strip, and a Palestinian journalist died of wounds received the day before in the West Bank, officials said.\n\nIsraeli forces shot and killed a 25-year-old policeman and seriously wounded two other security men during an overnight attack on a police station near Deir el Balah, south of Gaza City, Palestinian security sources said.\n\nMuween al-Udani, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who was in a nearby home, died after a bullet struck him in the head.\n\nIsraeli forces for two hours stopped an ambulance from reaching him, Dr. Ahmed Rabah, Director of Deir el Balah Hospital, told AFP, adding that he was dead by the time it arrived, though it was not certain he would have survived anyway.\n\nSecurity officials said Israeli troops, including some in armored vehicles, entered the area around 1:30 A.M. (2203 GMT Thursday) and opened fire with heavy machine guns on the police post.\n\nHospital officials said the dead policeman, Khaled al-Khatib, was hit in the chest and head.\n\nThey said two other security men wounded in the same attack were transported in serious condition to Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, while four civilians were also wounded.\n\nThe Israeli army said it had no information about the events in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, a Palestinian journalist died Friday of his wounds after he was shot during an Israeli incursion on Thursday in the center of Jenin in the northern West Bank, Jenin Hospital officials said.\n\nImad abu Zahra, 35, from Jenin, who worked both as a freelance writer and photographer for a Palestinian publication, bled to death after a bullet severed an artery, according to hospital officials.\n\nColleagues said he was wearing a jacket with the word \"Press\" stamped on it in English.\n\nA photographer wounded in the same incident on Thursday, said Dahla, was in fair condition, hospital officials said. Colleagues said he was also wearing a jacket marked \"Press\".\n\nPalestinian security sources said the shooting erupted after the army announced that a curfew had been lifted, but an Israeli military spokesman denied that the lockdown had been suspended.\n\nThe Palestinian sources said five tanks and 10 Jeeps had entered Jenin.\n\nOn Friday, the army conducted house-to-house searches of Jenin, ordering all boys and men between 13 years old and 50 years old out of their homes, security sources said.\n\nAnd in Bir Zeit, near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli soldiers arrested five Palestinians, including two with the Palestinian Authority's intelligence service, security sources said.\n\nThe army has almost completely reoccupied the West Bank for the past three weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli military radio said that 22 Palestinians were arrested overnight Thursday in different parts of the West Bank."
