        "text": "The following is a partial list of civilian casualties in the Second Intifada.\n\nAccording to the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, 887 (78 percent) of the 1,137 Israelis killed in attacks from September 2000 – 2005 were civilians.[1] Another 8,341 Israelis were wounded during this period, including 5,676 civilians and 2,665 security forces personnel.[2] The majority of casualties were caused by suicide bombings, though Israelis have also been killed by planted bombs, shootings, stonings, stabbings, lynchings, rockets, and other methods of attack.[2]\n\nAccording to B'Tselem, in the ten years from 2000–2010, of the 6371 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces, at least 2996 did not participate in hostilities when killed, and 1317 were minors. Out of 1083 Israelis killed, 741 were civilians (124 minors).[3]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nA 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings that took place from September 2000 through August 2005 found that 39.9 percent of the suicide attacks were carried out by Hamas, 25.7 percent by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), 26.4 percent by Fatah, 5.4 percent by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and 2.7 percent by other organizations.[4] The youngest victim of the Second Intifada was an Israeli infant who was nine hours old. Several pregnant women have also been killed.[5][6]\n\nIsraeli civilians' deaths do not show a high regularity in their age or gender distribution, as Palestinian militants chose to attack whichever civilian targets were accessible. The targets included the Dolphinarium discotheque massacre, a place frequented by Israeli youth, and open-air markets and public buses, which are disproportionately used by women and the elderly.[1] A number of attacks against Israeli civilians have been considered massacres[7][8][9] while others, such as the murder of a pregnant woman and her four young daughters, have been called crimes against humanity.[10]\n\nIsraeli non-combatant casualties\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a partial list of Israeli civilian casualties of the Second Intifada. The International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (IPICT) puts civilian deaths at 78% and Israeli combatants at 22%, between 27 September 2000 and 1 January 2005. According to B'tselem between the start of the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead, 731 Israeli civilians and 332 members of the Israeli security services have been killed.[11][2] The Israeli civilians' deaths do not show a high regularity in their age or gender distribution, as Palestinian militants chose to attack whichever civilian targets were accessible. The targets included the Dolphinarium disco attack, a place frequented by Israeli youth, and open-air markets and public buses, which are disproportionately used by women and the elderly.[1] A number of attacks against Israeli civilians have been considered massacres.[12][13][14]\n\nDate Incident Location Responsible party Deaths Injured Refs October 1–9, 2000 October 2000 events Northern Israel

Second Intifada. The portion of the killed since the beginning of the Second Intifada that were civilians is disputed.[124] According to B'Tselem, in the decade from 27 September 2000 to 27 September 2010, 6371 Palestinians were killed at least 2996 of whom did not participate in hostilities when they were killed.[3]\n\nA study conducted by Israel's International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) concluded that 1,099 were non-combatants, or 35 percent.[125] According to the study, 103 (9 percent) were female and 996 (91 percent) were male.[125] Professor and historian Benny Morris came to a similar conclusion in his 2009 retrospective book One States, Two States, saying that about one third of the Palestinian deaths had been civilians.[126]\n\nThe portion of the 4,281 Palestinians killed since the beginning of the Second Intifada that were civilians is disputed. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem, 2,038 were civilians.[127] Israeli historian Benny Morris estimated that about one third of the Palestinian deaths had been civilians.[128]\n\nAnother 609 Palestinian fatalities were inflicted by other Palestinians.[129][130]\n\nDate Incident Location Responsible party Deaths Injuries References September 30, 2000 Shooting
