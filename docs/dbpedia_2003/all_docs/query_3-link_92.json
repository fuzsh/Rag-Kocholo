        "text": "This summer marks the fifth anniversary of the attack on Gaza in 2014 which lasted for seven weeks. During the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, 2,104 Palestinians were killed, including 1,462 civilians, among them 495 children and 253 women. Five years after that bloody attack, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip continue to suffer under blockade, isolated from the rest of the world, and with no hope for imminent solutions in the horizon. There is an entire generation of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip that knew nothing but living under blockade and witnessed more than one war. Yet people in the Gaza Strip continue to live despite the blockade with hope as their only companion. In the fifrth anniversary of a war that left the Gaza Strip devastated, made mothers bereaved and turned children into orphans, and led to the vanishing of entire families from the civil registry, we remember the names of those who were killed so that their memory may serve as a reminder for all people of concious that a lot still needs to be done to bring about justice and peace.\n\nTotal Palestinian killed in the month of July: 1,254"
