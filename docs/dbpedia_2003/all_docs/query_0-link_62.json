        "text": "Product Specific Information\n\nNOTE: R960-25 was previously sold under product #46-0705. When re-ordering, please use #R960-25.\n\nR960CUS was previously sold under product #46-1157. When re-ordering, please use #R960CUS.\n\nThis antibody recognizes amino acid sequence: -Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn-Pro-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser-Thr-.\n\nThis antibody is functionally tested against 20 ng of an E. coli expressed fusion protein containing a V5 epitope using a chemiluminescent substrate at a 1 minute exposure. This antibody has also been tested in Western blot against 25 ng of recombinant Positope™ protein. The Positope™ control protein is a 53 kDa recombinant protein that contains seven epitope tags, including His (C-term), HisG, c-myc, and V5. Low background was observed using chemiluminescent or alkaline phosphatase reagents for detection. For Western blot, dilute in PBS or Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat, dry milk (PBSTM or TBSTM).\n\nUsing chemiluminescence as the detection method, no cross-reactivity has been observed in bacterial lysates. In mammalian lysates, a few cross-reactive proteins have been observed upon overexposure of blots.\n\nThis antibody has also been used successfully to immunoprecipitate fusion proteins that contain theV5 epitope.\n\nTarget Information\n\nEpitope tags provide a method to localize gene products in a variety of cell types, study the topology of proteins and protein complexes, identify associated proteins, and characterize newly identified, low abundance or poorly immunogenic proteins when protein specific antibodies are not available. The V5 epitope tag is derived from a small epitope (Pk) present on the P and V proteins of the paramyxovirus of simian virus (SV5). The V5 tag is usually used with all 14 amino acids (GKPIPNPLLGLDST), although it has also been used with a shorter 9 amino acid sequence (IPNPLLGLD)."
