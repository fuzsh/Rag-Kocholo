        "text": "[PDF version available here]\n\nLPHR has long-documented systematic and widespread violations of Palestinian children’s human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory. An enormously intensified upsurge in grave violations against and affecting Palestinian children have been inflicted in 2023, and are ongoing into 2024.\n\nGrave violation incidents and patterns are outlined in this Child Rights Annual Report 2023, which additionally covers the opening ten weeks of 2024. An overview immediately below clarifies the scope of exceptionally serious violations against Palestinian children:\n\nAs of 12 March 2024, at least 31,184 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023, with at least 12,550 of those killed being children, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health figures. 36 Israeli children have been killed, according to Israeli authorities, the majority on 7 October. LPHR has consistently stated that the scale, speed and specific location of Palestinian civilian casualties raises extreme alarm that Israeli military forces are instituting a targeting policy in Gaza which clearly appears to violate the international humanitarian law principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack, amounting to apparent atrocity crimes.\n\nChildren in Gaza are starting to die from malnutrition, dehydration and hunger, according to UN experts. As of 12 March 2024, at least 23 children are reported to have died of starvation and dehydration in Gaza. As the risk of famine rises, according to humanitarian officials, all children under five (335,000 children) are at high risk of severe malnutrition, with serious adverse impacts on their development and right to health. LPHR outlined in a legal briefing on 13 October that the Israeli government’s announcement of a siege policy on Gaza clearly appears to constitute the war crime of starvation against a civilian population.\n\nChildren in Gaza have been maimed at a devastating rate. UNICEF reported in December that after ten weeks of conflict around 1,000 children in Gaza had lost one or both of their legs.\n\nUNICEF reported that as of 2 February 2024, at least 17,000 children are estimated to be unaccompanied or separated from their parents in Gaza.\n\nAt least 90% of children under five are affected by one or more infectious diseases, and 70% have diarrhoea. Most water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed or are otherwise non-operational or accessible, according to UN OCHA, putting children at increasing risk of deadly diseases.\n\n144 children were killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank between 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024, the majority shot by Israeli forces using live ammunition, including a two-year-old boy, four-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy. A report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published on 13 February 2024 and examining the period between 1 November 2022- 31 October 2023, found that 84 children, 81 boys and three girls, were killed by Israeli security forces in the West Bank. At least 28 were hit above the waist, including 14 in the head, raising concerns that lethal force may have been used intentionally. The UN report found that in the vast majority of cases, use of force by Israeli security forces did not comply with the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality. LPHR’s Child Rights Bulletins have consistently documented the clearly apparent unlawful use of live ammunition against Palestinian children by Israeli forces with effective impunity.\n\nFour Palestinian children, aged between 11 and 15 years old, were killed when Israeli forces fired a missile from an Apache attack helicopter at a group of Palestinian civilians, most of them children, during a military incursion into Nour Shams refugee camp in the West Bank.\n\nPalestinian children detained by Israeli forces continue to report being subject to physical abuse, strip searches, threats and other ill-treatment. In July 2023, LPHR and Save the Children announced a landmark call for an immediate moratorium on Israeli authorities arresting, detaining and prosecuting Palestinian children, due to severe and pervasive harm being perpetrated against children within Israel’s military detention system.\n\nTwo schools were destroyed by Israeli authorities in the West Bank, 140 schools have been destroyed or sustained major damage in Gaza, and access to education has been deprived to 625,000 children in Gaza since 7 October.\n\nIn 2023 alone, a total of 1,152 Palestinians, including 575 children, were displaced in the West Bank when Israeli authorities demolished or forced them to demolish their homes citing lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain.\n\nThe key incidents and statistics outlined in this bulletin span a range of violation categories: ‘Fatalities’, ‘Injuries’, ‘Settler Violence’, ‘Arrests and Detention’, ‘Interference against Education’, ‘Displacement and Demolitions’. They are collated from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) and local human rights organisations: Defence for Children International-Palestine (DCIP), Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights, Yesh Din, Military Court Watch (MCW) and B’Tselem.\n\nThis bulletin outlines the specific rights of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) that apply to the key incidents affecting Palestinian children in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). As the occupying power, Israel has legal responsibilities under international conventions, including the UNCRC, for the safety, welfare, and human rights protection of civilians living in the oPt.\n\nFor previous child rights bulletins, please see the Children’s Rights Project page of LPHR’s website.\n\nLPHR gives special thanks to Zaynab Ali and Jude Heneidi of LPHR’s Student Network for their excellent work preparing this bulletin.\n\nFATALITIES\n\nIn Gaza, the vast majority of the 31,184 Palestinians reported to have been killed since 7 October 2023 and as of 12 March 2024 are women and children. The number of children killed is at least 12,550. Hundreds of thousands of children are at risk of death from starvation, dehydration and disease. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, 144 Palestinian children were killed by Israeli forces or settlers between 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024. 36 Israeli children have been killed, according to the Israeli authorities, the majority on 7 October.\n\nFatality incidents in Gaza:\n\nSince 7 October 2023, UN OCHA has reported on thousands of children being killed and maimed due to and missile strikes against family homes and shelters for internally displaced persons. We are unable to include these incidents in this report due to its sheer scale. The enormity of civilian casualties raises deeply grave concern that Israeli military forces are instituting a targeting policy in Gaza which violates the fundamental international humanitarian law principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack, amounting to clearly apparent atrocity crimes.\n\nUN experts and the Director General of the World Health Organisation report that at least 10 children have died of starvation in Northern Gaza, and there are fears that the figures could be higher in other hospitals. UN OCHA reports that the majority of the population in Gaza’s Middle Area and southern governorates are in extreme hunger.\n\nUN experts report that in January 2024, one in six infants (children under two) in northern Gaza were found to be acutely malnourished, leading to wasting.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 10 February 2024, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) found the body of a six-year-old girl along with two PRCS workers who had been sent to rescue her after the vehicle she was in was struck and her family killed on 29 January. PRCS attribute the strike on the vehicle to Israeli shelling. Media reports identify the girl as Hind Rajab.\n\nDCIP reports that 12-year-old Dunia Abu Mohsen was recovering from losing her leg in an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and siblings in Naser Hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, when an Israeli tank-fired shell hit the hospital and struck her in the head on 17 December 2023.\n\nDCIP reports that on 27 January 2023, 10-year-old Nayef Khaled Nayef Al-Odat died of his injuries by an airstrike that struck near Khan Younis, Gaza in August 2022. The missile caused shrapnel injuries to Nayef’s head.\n\nFatality incidents in the West Bank:\n\nAt least 144 Palestinian children were killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank during the reporting period of 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024. DCIP reports that in 2023 alone, Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank shot and killed 121 children, 103 of them with live ammunition, 13 in drone strikes, four children by missiles fired from a U.S.-sourced Apache attack helicopter, and one in an airstrike.\n\nIncidents include:\n\nDCIP reports that on 4 March 2024, 10-year-old Amr Mohammad Ghaleb Najar was shot in the head by Israeli forces during a military incursion into the Palestinian town of Burin. Amr was sitting in the front seat of his father’s car with his younger brother as his father drove through the village of Burin during the daytime. As they entered the village, an soldier fired shots towards their vehicle from a distance of approximately 20 metres, penetrating the front windshield with two bullets, at least one of which struck Amr in the head.\n\nDCIP reports that on 2 March 2024, 13-year-old Mohammad Khaled Taher Zaid was shot in the back by Israeli forces in Jalazoun refugee camp. Mohammad was standing with a friend in front of a UN-run school, near the entrance to Jalazoun refugee camp and the Israeli settlement of Beit El. Israeli forces deployed around 20–40 metres away fired live ammunition at the boys. Mohammad sustained three gunshot wounds to his back and thigh, dying hours later.\n\nDCIP reports that on 2 March 2024, 15-year-old Mohammad Murad Hassan Ghnaim was shot in the head by Israeli forces during a military incursion into the Palestinian town of Kafr Ni’ma. Mohammad and a few other friends stood in front of a shop, awaiting the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the neighbourhood. When news spread that Israeli forces had left the area, Mohammad and the others headed to their car to return home. Reportedly, Israeli forces ambushed them, firing live ammunition from about 30 metres away, striking Mohammad in the head.\n\nDCIP reports that on 29 February 2024, 17-year-old Bashar Nihad Abdulatif Hanani was shot in the back by Israeli forces during a military incursion into the Palestinian town of Beit Furik.

Two Israeli drone-fired missiles struck a car driven by a Palestinian man wanted by Israeli forces, who was also killed in the attack. Said sustained shrapnel wounds all over his body, dying hours later. At least five other children were wounded in the drone strike.\n\nDCIP reports that on 21 February 2024, Israeli forces shot 15-year-old Fadi Said Kamel Suleiman in the back during an Israeli military incursion into the Palestinian town of Azzun. Fadi, while standing on the roof of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society building, is alleged to have thrown stones toward a heavily armoured Israeli military vehicle. An Israeli soldier near the military vehicle shot Fadi from a distance of about 150 metres. After shooting him, Israeli forces prevented anyone from accessing the child for around 30 minutes.\n\nDCIP reports that on 14 February 2024, Israeli forces shot 16-year-old Neehel Ziad Mohammad Bregheith in the head during an Israeli military incursion into the Palestinian town of Beit Ummar.

At least 28 were hit above the waist, including 14 in the head, raising concerns that lethal force may have been used intentionally. The report found that in the vast majority of cases, use of force by Israeli security forces did not comply with the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality.\n\nDCIP reports that on 11 February 2024, Israeli paramilitary border police officers shot 15-year-old Mohammad Tariq Salim Abu Sneineh several times from a distance of approximately 10 meters near Al-Wad Street in the old city of Jerusalem.

DCIP reports that after being shot, Wadea Shadi Sa’d Elayan ran about five metres before falling to the ground, and being shot a second time by an Israeli soldier. Israeli forces confiscated Wadea’s body after killing him. The Israeli authorities’ policy of withholding the bodies of killed Palestinians, including children, compounds the pain of bereaved families and amounts to collective punishment.\n\nDCIP reports that on 29 January 2024, 17-year-old Abdulrahman Abdulrahim Suleiman Hamed was shot in the chest and the waist by Israeli forces at around midday, during an Israeli military incursion into Silwad. Israeli forces fired tear gas canisters toward Palestinian residents and their homes. Palestinians confronted Israeli forces.

Under international law, lethal application of force can only be used as a last resort when there is a direct and imminent threat to life or serious injury. Israeli forces have long been documented to consistently apply lethal application of force where there is lack of evidence to suggest any direct and imminent threat to life. Violations of this legal requirement resulting in an unlawful extrajudicial killing should entail individual criminal responsibility. Indeed, part of providing meaningful protection under the UNCRC involves investigation of, and accountability for, child deaths caused by unlawful application of force. To fulfil its obligations under international law, it is necessary that the Government of Israel thoroughly and transparently investigate the circumstances of the above-mentioned fatal shootings and ensure legal accountability and justice is delivered where there is criminal wrongdoing. However, there is strong evidence indicating that Israel is systemically failing to provide genuine accountability for child deaths, with data collected by the Israeli human rights organisations, B’Tselem and Yesh Din, clearly demonstrating that Israeli soldiers who harm or kill Palestinians are very rarely indicted.\n\nIsrael’s policy of withholding bodies of Palestinians, including children, who have been killed by Israeli forces, appears to amount to collective punishment against families, which is prohibited under international humanitarian law. It may also constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of the families of the deceased, a violation of international human rights law, including Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because of the mental distress it inflicts on the family.\n\nINJURIES\n\nUN OCHA reports that 71,920 Palestinians have been injured in Gaza between 7 October 2023- 4 March 2024.

UN OCHA reports that between 1 January 2023- 9 February 2024 (latest figures available) 1,949 Palestinian children were injured across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. The real figure may be significantly higher, as thousands of cases have not been categorised by age. Injuries were caused by tear gas inhalation, live ammunition, rubber bullets, physical assault, air launched explosives, tear gas canisters (hit by) and unspecified means. UN OCHA has reported an increase in the number of injuries caused by live ammunition.\n\nDue to the sheer scale of injury incidents in Gaza since 7 October, the incidents cited below relate only to the occupied West Bank.\n\nData collected by UN OCHA records that the majority (1,907) of the total child injuries during this bulletin’s reporting period were caused by Israeli forces. Of these, 545 boys and 68 girls were injured by Israeli forces during military search and arrest operations. 389 children were injured during protests.\n\nUN OCHA reports that, Israeli security forces put Palestinians in the West Bank, including children, in danger, including by appearing to use them as human shields.\n\nDCIP reports that on 4 February 2024, Israeli forces unleashed an attack dog on a four-year-old Palestinian boy in the northern occupied West Bank. Israeli forces released the military dog into a family home, after carrying out an arrest operation in Balata refugee camp. The dog attacked the four-year-old after knocking him out of his mother’s arms, and repeatedly bit him.\n\nDCIP reports that on 25 January 2024, Israeli forces severely beat a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in Hebron on his way to buy bread. Three Israeli soldiers approached the boy and began beating him at around 14:40 near his home in Hebron. The soldiers were chasing another child, who fled, before grabbing the 15-year-old and punching, slapping, and verbally abusing him. The boy reports temporarily losing his vision during the prolonged assault.\n\nUN OCHA records that in Gaza between 1 January 2023- 6 October 2023, 86 boys and 25 girls were injured by Israeli forces, the majority by air-launched explosives and live ammunition.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the UNCRC provides that states shall ensure children the protection and care necessary for their well-being. The enormous number of children injured by Israeli forces prima facie violates both the letter and the spirit of Article 3(2).\n\nSETTLER VIOLENCE\n\nUN OCHA reports that 2023 saw the highest number of settler attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in any year since UN OCHA started recording incidents in 2006. Incidents in which Israeli soldiers escorted armed settlers invading Palestinian homes were documented; at least 403 children were injured in settler related incidents between 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024. At least 38 children were directly injured by settlers.\n\nIncidents of settler violence between 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024 include:\n\nB’Tselem reports that on 11 October 2023, a five-year-old Palestinian girl was shot in the shoulder by Israeli settlers, after settlers threw stones and fired shots at the girl’s family home. Reportedly, Israeli soldiers standing nearby did not intervene.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 1 September 2023, the single remaining Palestinian household in the herding community of Al Baqa’a (Jerusalem), comprising eight people, including five children, left the community following a series of settler attacks.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 4 August 2023, a Palestinian child was run over and injured by an Israeli settler in the H2 area of Hebron city.\n\nUN OCHA reports that in two separate incidents, on 7 and 10 July 2023, two Palestinian children were run over by settlers near the entrances of Beit Ummar (Hebron) and Huwwara (Nablus).\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 2 July 2023, a Palestinian child was injured when Israeli settlers blocked a road next to Yasuf village in Nablus and threw stones at Palestinian vehicles.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 28 June 2023, settlers physically assaulted and injured two Palestinian children while thy were grazing their livestock in Al Mu’arrajat East (Ramallah).\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 10 May 2023, a group of Israeli settlers, some armed, shot and injured two Palestinians and physically assaulted a Palestinian child in Deir Dibwan (Ramallah).\n\nUN OCHA reports that settlers injured six children between 28 March -17 April, including a nine-year-old girl, who was injured when stones were thrown at Palestinian vehicles.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 14 – 27 March 2023, Israeli settlers injured two children in separate attacks.\n\nUN OCHA reports that an eight-year-old boy was injured when Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian property by throwing stones and empty bottles in Tal Rumeida and Wadi Al Hussein (Hebron) on 7 and 8 March 2023.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 6 March 2023, a two-year-old Palestinian child was injured when Israeli settlers entered Huwwara and threw stones at Palestinian houses and vehicles.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 14 – 27 February 2023, three children were among the 13 Palestinians injured by Israeli settlers and people known or believed to be settlers.\n\nUN OCHA reported that between the end of 2022 and August 2023, 12% of 63 Palestinian herding communities (home to around 10,000 people, 51% of them children) had been displaced as a result of settler violence and settlers preventing access to grazing land. Four communities had been completely displaced. Six had over 50% of their residents leave. In seven other communities, more than 25% of the community had left.\n\nUN OCHA subsequently reported in February 2024 that at least 1,539 Palestinians were displaced during 2023, citing Israeli settlers’ violence and shrinking access to grazing land as the main reasons, compared with 774 people in 2022. Of them, 1,208 (81 per cent) were displaced in the aftermath of 7 October, amid a significant increase in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, including physical attacks and death threats. Those displaced have moved to towns or other rural areas that they consider safer. Most of those displaced were in the governorates of Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron, which also have the highest number of Israeli settlement outposts. At least fourteen Palestinian communities were completely displaced during 2023 and now stand empty. In some of these communities, Israeli forces demolished the remaining structures, including at least two schools.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the UNCRC provides that states should ensure the protection and care of children, as is necessary for their wellbeing. The ongoing violent attacks on children by Israeli settlers strongly indicates that Israel is in breach of Article 3(2). The Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din reports that incidents of violence by Israeli civilians against Palestinians and their property are a daily occurrence throughout the West Bank and that these incidents are rarely investigated properly by Israeli law enforcement. Moreover, only 3% of the investigations into complaints filed by Palestinians injured by settlers lead to convictions.\n\nThe low rate of investigations into attacks by Israeli settlers suggests that Israel is in violation of its obligations under Article 39 of the UNCRC, which stipulates that states should take all appropriate measures to promote the physical and psychological recovery of a child victim of abuse, and that such recovery should take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.\n\nARRESTS AND DETENTION\n\nBetween 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024, UN OCHA reports that Israeli forces conducted thousands of search-and-arrest operations across the West Bank. The total number of Palestinian children arrested by Israeli forces is not known. Children continued to be arrested during night-time raids on their family homes. As of 31 December 2023, Military Court Watch reports that there are 137 Palestinian children (12 – 17 years old) being held in Israeli military detention facilities, 49 of them under administrative detention (detention without charge or trial, which can be renewed indefinitely). Military Court Watch reports that since 7 October, a marked deterioration in prison conditions has been reported, with children being punched and beaten with batons, attacked with dogs and denied medical attention.\n\nArrest and detention incidents in the reporting period include:\n\nDCIP reports that on 19 January 2024, Israeli forces burned a 17-year-old Palestinian prisoner with cigarettes after severely beating him.\n\nDCIP reports that on 10 January 2024, a Palestinian child recently released from administrative detention was attacked by an Israeli military dog while detained.\n\nMilitary Cout Watch reports that Palestinian child detainees released as part of a prisoner exchange deal in November 2023 were replaced with a fresh supply of child detainees by December 2023.\n\nDCIP reports that a 17-year-old Palestinian child who was repeatedly beaten and held in solitary confinement for 31 days, was released in November 2023. Israeli forces first detained the boy on 21 March 2023, before isolating him in solitary confinement for 31 days. The boy reports that he was interrogated on an almost daily basis during solitary confinement. He reports that on 21 October 2023, Israeli forces stormed his cell and strip-searched and beat him. The boy reports that he and other children were repeatedly and severely beaten. He reports having water poured over his clothes in extremely cold weather, and having his mattress and blanket confiscated.\n\nMilitary Court Watch reports that on 10 August 2023, a 13-year-old boy from Bethlehem was arrested by Israeli soldiers. In sworn testimony, the boy describes being repeatedly assaulted, strip-searched, left in an outdoor cage overnight and having to use the toilet in front of Israeli soldiers.\n\nMilitary Court Watch reports that on 10 August, a 16-year-old boy was arrested during a night-time raid at his grandmother’s home. In sworn testimony, he reports being beaten and verbally abused by soldiers, strip-searched, left in an open cage, and threatened with a two year prison sentence if he did not confess to stone throwing, before being released without charge.\n\nMilitary Court Watch reports that on 8 August 2023, a 17-year-old boy was arrested during an Israeli night-time raid on his home. In sworn testimony, he reports that four soldiers in his bedroom aimed their guns at him, being repeatedly physically assaulted and left with a fractured hand. The boy reports that his interrogator shouted at him to confess to stone-throwing, threatened to keep him in prison for a long time, and told him that he’d had his father’s work permit revoked.\n\nMilitary Court Watch reports that on 8 August 2023, a 16-year-old from Aida Camp was arrested by Israeli soldiers from home during the night. In sworn testimony, the boy reports being held in solitary confinement for three days, strip-searched and kept in an outdoor cage. He was released without charge a week later. He reports that his father’s work permit was revoked.\n\nMilitary Court Watch reports that on 18 April 2023, a 14-year-old boy from Beit Ummar was detained by Israeli soldiers from home. In sworn testimony, the boy reports waking to find ten masked Israeli soldiers in his bedroom. He reports not being informed of the reason for his arrest, being strip-searched, and physically and verbally abused. He reports being blindfolded during his interrogation. The boy was pressured into signing a document in Hebrew and confessing to stone throwing. He was released from prison on 2 August 2023.\n\nFurther children’s testimonies of their arrest, ill-treatment and detention during the reporting period can be found here.\n\nArticle 37(a) of the UNCRC states that no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 19 of the UNCRC provides that State Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence while in the care of any person who has the care of the child. In its General Comment No. 8, the Committee on the Rights of the Child indicated that “There is no ambiguity: ‘all forms of physical or mental violence’ does not leave room for any level of legalized violence against children”. Frequently documented acts of systematic ill-treatment of children, possibly rising to torture, during Israel’s military detention process, has led independent legal experts – funded by the UK Government – to conclude that Israel is in breach of Article 37(a) of the UNCRC.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the UNCRC obliges states to ensure that: ‘In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration’. Further, Article 37(b) of the UNCRC states that no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily and that it shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. The continued arbitrary arrests of children, and the physical abuse of children who have been detained, suggest that Israel is in breach of both the spirit and the letter of Article 3(1) and 37(b).\n\nPlease see LPHR’s briefing on Israel’s military of Palestinian children for an accessible analysis of material legal and human rights issues arising from Israel’s military detention of Palestinian children. In July 2023, LPHR and Save the Children announced a landmark call for an immediate moratorium on Israeli authorities arresting, detaining and prosecuting Palestinian children, due to severe and pervasive harm being perpetrated against children within Israel’s military detention system.\n\nINTERFERENCE AGAINST EDUCATION\n\nInfringements on education in the reporting period of 1 January 2023- 4 March 2024 include:\n\nUN OCHA reports that 625,000 students in Gaza had no access to education and over 5,000 students and 240 teachers had been killed as of 13 February 2024.\n\nUN OCHA reports that 60% of Gaza’s schools (350 out of 563) have been damaged.\n\nUN OCHA reports that 92% of all school buildings in Gaza are being used as shelters for IDPs and or have sustained damage. Some 390 schools (78.8% of the total school buildings in Gaza) sustained damage, including 140 schools that sustained major damage or were fully destroyed. Combined, these schools previously served some 433,000 children and more than 16,200 teachers.\n\nSave the Children reports that hundreds of teachers have been killed and about 75% of schools, colleges, and universities have been completely destroyed or damaged in Gaza, as of 24 January 2024.\n\nAs mentioned in the fatalities section above, DCIP reports that Israeli forces destroyed parts of the Al-Baraem Kindergarten in Nour Shams refugee camp in the West Bank on 27 December 2023.\n\nB’Tselem reports that on 7 August 2023, about three months after residents of ‘Ein Samia were forced to abandon their homes and lives in the community which lies northeast of Ramallah, Civil Administration personnel arrived with a military escort, proclaimed the site a closed military zone and demolished the school that community residents built in early 2022. The forces confiscated all the equipment inside the school as well. On 22 May 2023, the last remaining residents of the community, which numbered 200, were forced to leave their homes after Israel had made their lives unbearable, in part through settler violence. According to UN figures, the ‘Ein Samia community school was one of 44 schools in the West Bank under threat of demolition, eight of them in East Jerusalem. About 4,800 students attend these schools.\n\nB’Tselem reports that on 7 May 2023, at around 4:00 A.M., Civil Administration personnel arrived with a military escort, a digger, a bulldozer, trucks and a crane, to the school in the community of Jub a-Dib. The forces demolished the school, which serves 42 students, and confiscated a structure used as a storage room as well as furniture, appliances and electronics: 40 chairs, 10 desks, two office desks, two refrigerators, a computer, a TV and a printer. On Wednesday, 10 May 2023, at around 4:30 P.M., Civil Administration personnel returned to the wreckage of the school with a military escort and confiscated two tents local residents had set up as temporary classrooms and about 40 chairs and declared the school a closed military zone. The Civil Administration demolished the community’s school once before on 22 August 2017, and it was rebuilt by community residents.\n\nB’Tselem reports that on 3 Jan 2023 Some of the forces then went on in a jeep to the community of Khirbet a-Safai al-Foqa, which lies in Masafer Yatta within the area the military designated “Firing Zone 918”, and confiscated a folded tent. The tent, which teachers put up and took down daily to use as a classroom, was donated by the Red Crescent after Israel demolished the community school on 23 Nov. 2022 and confiscated tents donated to serve as classrooms on 6 Dec. 2022.\n\nB’Tselem reports that on 7 May 2023, at around 4:00 A.M., Civil Administration personnel arrived with a military escort, a digger, a bulldozer, trucks and a crane, to the school in the community of Jub a-Dib. The forces demolished the school, which serves 42 students, and confiscated a structure used as a storage room as well as furniture, appliances and electronics: 40 chairs, 10 desks, two office desks, two refrigerators, a computer, a TV and a printer. On Wednesday, 10 May 2023, at around 4:30 P.M., Civil Administration personnel returned to the wreckage of the school with a military escort and confiscated two tents local residents had set up as temporary classrooms and about 40 chairs and declared the school a closed military zone. The Civil Administration demolished the community’s school once before on 22 August 2017, and it was rebuilt by community residents.\n\nArticle 28 of the UNCRC stipulates that education should be accessible to all children on the basis of equal opportunity, obliging Israel to ensure that children in the oPt have unrestricted access to education. Attacks on schools in Gaza and the demolition of schools in the West Bank strongly appear to breach both the spirit and the letter of Article 28.\n\nDEMOLITIONS & DISPLACEMENT\n\nHome demolitions and displacement remain a matter of huge concern. As of early March 2024, over 60% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged (over 70,000 housing units destroyed). UNICEF reports that at least 17,000 children are estimated to be unaccompanied or separated from their parents in Gaza. In the West Bank, UN OCHA reports that 2023 saw the highest number of displacements – about 4,000 Palestinians – due to demolitions since recording began in 2009. Data collected by UN OCHA records that at least 1,256 children (603 girls and 653 boys) were displaced by the demolition of 1398 structures (111 of them donor funded) in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, during the reporting period of this bulletin.\n\nIncidents of demolitions and displacement during the reporting period include:\n\nUN OCHA reports that since 7 October 2023 and as of 4 March 2024, 711 Palestinian children have been displaced. 343 of these children were displaced following the demolition of their homes in Area C and East Jerusalem, due to lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain, or due to a punitive demolition order.\n\nUN OCHA reports that in 2023 alone, a total of 1,152 Palestinians, including 575 children, were displaced when the Israeli authorities demolished or forced them to demolish their homes citing lack of Israeli-issued building permits.\n\nUN OCHA reports that in 2023, at least 1,539 Palestinians, including 756 children, were displaced from their homes or communities in Area C of the West Bank amid Israeli settler violence, access restrictions, and shrinking access to grazing land.\n\nUN OCHA reports that in 2023, 200 Palestinians, including 82 children, were displaced from H2 area and Masafer Yatta in Hebron, citing increased movement restrictions imposed on their communities by Israeli forces as the primary reason.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 1 September 2023, Israeli forces raided Aqqaba (Tubas) and surrounded a Palestinian house. An exchange of fire with Palestinians ensued, and Israeli forces shot live ammunition; six children were displaced due to the damage caused to their homes.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 5 – 18 September 2023, eight children were displaced when the Israeli authorities in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 23 structures, including seven homes, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 22 August – 4 September 2023, Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 14 structures in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank, including seven homes, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits.

Also, on 28 July, following the establishment of an Israeli settlement in the Palestinian community of Al Baqa’a (Jerusalem) on 20 June, one of the two remaining Palestinian households, comprising eight people, including five children and a pregnant woman, left the community. Similarly, On 4 August, 12 households in Ras al Tin (Ramallah) comprising 89 people, including 39 children, dismantled their residential and livelihood structures and left their communities and relocated to safer places. According to the families, they left after increased settler violence and harassment following the establishment of new farming settlement outposts.\n\nDCIP reports that in July 2023, Israeli forces entered the houses of Palestinian families in Jenin refugee camp, aiming weapons at children and terrifying families before demolishing the walls of the homes, during a military incursion.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 5 – 24 July 2023, 66 Palestinians, including 34 children, were displaced when Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 54 structures in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank, including 20 homes, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain.

According to the families, they left after increased settlement activities following the establishment of new settlement outposts.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 20 – 24 June 2023, 25 Palestinians, including 12 children were displaced when Israeli settlers injured 19 Palestinians and caused damage to Palestinian properties in 46 instances in four consecutive days, between 20 and 24 June, throughout the northern and central West Bank. In total, 41 Palestinian-owned houses were damaged. Five Palestinian-owned houses were fully burnt in Turmus’ayya village (Ramallah) and 36 were damaged or burnt in Huwwara, Al Lubban ash Sahrqiya, ‘Urif, Turmus’ayya, Umm Saffa and Sinjil. Most of the damage occurred to windows, shattered with stones by settlers.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 30 May – 12 June 2023, the Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 14 structures in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank, including five homes, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain. As a result, 44 Palestinians, including 19 children, were displaced.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 23 May 2023, Israeli forces raided Ni’lin village (Ramallah) in Area B of the West Bank and demolished on punitive grounds the multiple-story home of a family whose member killed one Israeli and injured two others in an attack in Israel on 9 March 2023. One household, comprising 14 people, including eight children, was displaced.\n\nUN OCHA reports that between 16- 29 May 2023, 56 Palestinians including 33 children were displaced when the Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 43 structures in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank, including eleven homes, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain.\n\nUN OCHA reports between 2 – 15 May 2023, 50 Palestinians, including 23 children, were displaced when the Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 42 structures in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank, including 17 homes, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain. Nine of the structures were provided by donors as humanitarian assistance, including a school. More than half of the affected structures (26) were in Area C, including the donor funded school. The remaining 16 structures were demolished in East Jerusalem, including two residential structures demolished in Wadi Qaddum area of Silwan.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 2 and 3 May 2023, Israeli forces raided Hajja (Qalqilya) and Haris (Salfit) villages, in Area B of the West Bank, and demolished on punitive grounds two multiple-story homes of families whose members killed four Israelis and injured others. Three households, comprising 14 people, including eight children, were displaced. Nine others, including three children, were otherwise affected.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 26 March 2023, Israeli settlers threw a Molotov cocktail at a Palestinian house in Sinjil (Ramallah), setting it on fire, according to local community sources. As a result, a Palestinian family of six, including four children, were displaced, and lost most of their belongings.\n\nUN OCHA reports that on 28 February – 13 March 2023, 74 Palestinians, including 32 children, were displaced when the Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced people to demolish 35 structures in Area C and East Jerusalem, in the West Bank, including 13 residential structures, citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain.

The UNCRC further adds that State Parties are responsible for taking appropriate measures to provide assistance in respect to nutrition, clothing and housing. The actions of the Government of Israel in rendering children and their parents homeless and disrupting families’ livelihoods through demolitions of homes, clearly violates both the letter and the spirit of the UNCRC.\n\nArticle 18(2) of the UNCRC obliges State Parties to give appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities. Demolitions and subsequent forced displacement violate this right as it harms parents and legal guardians’ ability to fulfil their responsibilities of looking after and providing shelter for their children.\n\nArticle 16(1) of the UNCRC protects children’s rights to not be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family and home and Article 16(2) entitles children to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Demolitions affect this right as it physically displaces children from their family homes without first giving them access to a legal system through which they could challenge such actions.\n\n[PDF version available here]"
