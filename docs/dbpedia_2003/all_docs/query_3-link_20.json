        "text": "On October 7th 2023, Hamas militants breached the heavily-fortified fence separating Israel and the Gaza Strip, attacking numerous towns and villages. More than 1,000 people in Israel were reported killed, with more than 250 taken hostage in Gaza. In response Israel launched its largest military assault in decades. By April 2024, more than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza had been reported killed by Israeli strikes.\n\nDespite the scale of harm, reliable information on specific civilian harm incidents in Gaza has been sparse. Many Palestinian journalists and human rights workers have fled their homes, while international journalists have been unable to enter the territory. Online, disinformation has flourished.\n\nThis resource presents Airwarsâ€™ documentation of civilian harm allegations. Six months into the war, our research team had already monitored more than 4,000 allegations, but each one is only published following a rigorous multi-stage process. This means each week we might release incidents dating back to October, as well as more recent cases. Our overall aim is to publish every single event, though this will take many months."
