        "text": "For Iowa native and former Hawkeye wrestler Matt McDonough, the excitement surrounding his move back home was less about a specific opportunity in the wrestling world and more about being able to make an impact on those trying to achieve their dreams in the sport.\n\nMcDonough’s route to his current position as an assistant wrestling coach at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, grew organically. There was always something about wrestling in the Hawkeye State, however, that beckoned him back even when he was living what he thought was his dream.\n\n“I just love the community of wrestling in Iowa,” McDonough told FloWrestling. “It really is one of a kind, so it was a pretty cool chance to coach for a historic program that I have personal connections to.”\n\nAn aspiring medical doctor entering college, McDonough’s love for wrestling grew to what he calls a “fanatical” level through his time wearing the Iowa singlet, and by the time his collegiate career was over he knew he wanted to stay connected to the sport.\n\nDivision I was his goal, and like so many others his ambitions were aiming toward a head coaching gig. After two years as an assistant at Wisconsin, however, his mind was focused back on a smaller level of competition.\n\n“I had the fortunate opportunity of working for a youth wrestling club here in Eastern Iowa for a couple years post-collegiately before I went to Wisconsin, and I actually found a really strong passion for youth wrestling,” McDonough said. “When I left Wisconsin that was something I wanted to be involved in and being back in Iowa seemed like a natural place to do that.”\n\nHe is influenced by those who coached before him. From his dad, former Iowa wrestler Mike McDonough, all the way up through Tom and Terry Brands, coaches at every level have made their impact on him.\n\nRemembering those mentors that he had throughout his career is what pushes him to shift his goals. Of course, he wants to win and push athletes to be their best on the mat, but there’s so much more.\n\n“The most meaningful goal to me is that I’m remembered by those who I coached, and that the relationships that I created are lasting with the people that I get to be around and have the pleasure of mentoring and leading, that I can have an impact on them the way my mentors had an impact on me,” McDonough said. “That’s what I hope that comes of any coaching and leadership that I have on these athletes, that I can instill in them values and give them values that will carry over the rest of their life.”\n\nThe way to build those relationships and making an impact is simple for McDonough. He cares about the wrestlers he coaches, whether it be on the mat or off the mat, during their time as a wrestler or years after.\n\nIn that way, by making an impact and being a mentor, he has an opportunity to give back to the state of Iowa and the wrestling culture that grew him into the person he is.\n\n“It means the world to me. I have a lot of love for the state of Iowa — it’s my home, somewhere that made me who I am and the values that I hold,” McDonough said. “Being a presence in the state of Iowa and the wrestling community and helping youth wrestlers as well as at the college level coaching at Cornell is something that I see as natural for me and really is a blessing.\n\n“I hope people can continue to do great things in high school and college and beyond in Iowa and continue to produce incredible talent that lets the whole world know that our wrestling culture is second to none.”"
