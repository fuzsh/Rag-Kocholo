        "text": "Our History\n\nIn1977, William “Bill” J. McDonough and his brother-in-law Robert L. Potterfield III, saw the need for a new funeral home in Leesburg, Virginia. A funeral home that would put great emphasis on the service aspects of the industry and serve each family without regard to race, creed or station in life, with the highest quality of professional service and sincerity.\n\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held and after 11 months of construction, our family was able to offer the families of Loudoun County a funeral home that was built just for funeral services, all on one floor with a formal chapel and rooms large enough to accommodate most families' needs.\n\nThis was the first time that families of Leesburg had a choice in funeral homes for their final tribute to their loved one.\n\nBill and Robert were partners in the business for 12 years before Robert sold his interest to Bill and Shirley in 1989.\n\nOver the next ten years, the McDonough children, Kathy, Bill, and Mark, were educated and devoted to continuing the business."
