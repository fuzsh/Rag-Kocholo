        "text": "MADISON, Wis. – It was sometime last fall in the weeks after the World Championships when Matt McDonough stepped on the mat inside the Iowa wrestling room and sparred with Tony Ramos.\n\nNeither can remember the exact circumstances that led to their practice pairing that day — something that was once a normal occurrence when they occupied the first two spots in the Hawkeye lineup — but they haven't squared off since.\n\n\"We don't work out together, we don't practice together,\" Ramos said. \"It's kind of one of those things where I don't think either of us wants to give the other guy a feel or any sense of an advantage anywhere, so we try to stay away from each other.\"\n\nIt's an odd set of circumstances. McDonough and Ramos are still teammates as members of the Hawkeye Wrestling Club. They're friends.\n\nThey're also both Olympic hopefuls who are best suited to contend in international freestyle wrestling's 125.5-pound weight class, which alters the competitive side of their relationship.\n\n\"We're not going to not talk, not be friends and not hang out just because we're competing with one another,\" Ramos said. \"At the same time, we both have the same dreams and same goals, but only one person can succeed.\"\n\nWhich is why sometimes Ramos grabs one of Iowa's All-American lightweights as a practice partner while McDonough tangles with another. They train with the same set of workout partners but rarely even drill together.\n\n\"In the end, you want to beat that guy,\" McDonough said last month. \"I'm sure some guys (at the same weight train together) and it's not a big deal to them, but I know some guys don't. … You're training to ultimately beat him, but we're going through the same workouts.\n\n\"But I'm not just thinking about beating that guy in the room next to me, I'm thinking about beating the best guys in the world. In the end, you're not going to train with guys you're ultimately competing against.\"\n\nRamos is the reigning American king of the weight class. In his debut on the Senior level last May, he claimed the crown at the World Team Trials and hasn't relinquished it since.\n\nHe's 13th in the latest United World Wrestling rankings and he's coming off a dramatic last-second win against Andrew Hochstrasser in the finals of last month's U.S. Open. The victory provided Ramos with an automatic pass into Saturday night's best-of-three championship series at the World Team Trials inside the Alliant Energy Center.\n\nLike Ramos, Brent Metcalf, a two-time NCAA champion at Iowa, will also have the luxury of sitting out until the finals. Two wins Sunday night at 143 pounds will put Metcalf on the World Team for the fourth time.\n\nJake Varner, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist and two-time NCAA champion for Iowa State, is also bidding to make the World Team for the fourth time. He'll need to win the challenge tournament at 214 pounds to set up a Sunday night rematch with 19-year-old Kyle Snyder, who upset Varner last month at the U.S. Open.\n\nTo set up a championship series against Ramos, McDonough will need to get through a challenging tournament bracket that includes former Northern Iowa star Joe Colon and Iowa State assistant Angel Escobedo.\n\n\"If that's what it comes down to,\" Ramos said of a possible Saturday night series against McDonough, \"it's awesome for Iowa and it's awesome for the Hawk fans.\""
