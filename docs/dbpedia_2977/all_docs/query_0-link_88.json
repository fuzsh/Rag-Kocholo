I am using the following Vue versions within a webpack build along with Vue Dev Tools 3.1.6.\n\n\"vue\": \"^2.1.0\", \"vue-router\": \"^2.7.0\", \"vuex\": \"^2.3.1\"\n\nThe Vuex icon is totally unresponsive (ie you can't click on it) although Vuex is working fine within the context of the application. The component icon within Vue Dev Tools works fine. I should note that occasionally Vuex (the Vuex icon is clickable) will work within Dev Tools (about 10% of the time).\n\nI've tried reinstalling Vue dev tools but no change noticed.\n\nVery frustrating so any help appreciated!"
