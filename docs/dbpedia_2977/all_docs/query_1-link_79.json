Formed in 1996, Mudvayne became popular in the late-1990s Decatur, Illinois underground music scene. The band released an EP, Kill, I Oughtta, in 1997 and a successful debut album, L.D. 50, in 2000. They had global success with The End of All Things to Come, Lost and Found and The New Game.\n\nSince 2010, the band has been inactive, with its members performing in other projects and making guest appearances. Chad Gray is the vocalist for the heavy metal supergroupHellyeah, of which Greg Tribbett was also a member until 2014. Gray founded an independent record label, Bullygoat Records, which produces heavy-metal albums. In early 2015, Chad Gray noted that the band's return seemed very unlikely, unless \"everybody licked their wounds and got over it\".\n\nHistory\n\nMusical style and influences\n\nAppearance\n\nBand members\n\nDiscography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n[/paste:font]"
