Firstly, Rugged Data, powered by The Hub, provides a two-way flow of information which means that you can enter data into The Hub and it will automatically appear in the mobile app. That could be information such as, site address, contact information, asset details and loads more. What this means for you is that technicians have less manual data entry to do at the mobile end and this reduction of effort simplifies the job and saves you bags of time. Want to take a look at how a process app like Rugged Data could help your business? We'd love to show you.
