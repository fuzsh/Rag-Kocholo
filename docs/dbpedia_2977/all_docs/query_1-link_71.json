        "text": "Squire Patton Boggs and California-based Carroll, Burdick & McDonough today announce that they have reached a definitive agreement to combine firms.\n\nThe combination will create the world's premier product quality, brand protection and compliance practice, joining together Squire Patton Boggs’ leading global platform of over 1,500 lawyers spanning 45 offices in 21 countries in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, with Carroll Burdick, a complex litigation and products risk management powerhouse with over 50 lawyers on three continents.\n\nCarroll Burdick will operate as an integrated part of Squire Patton Boggs, offering clients a robust level of service in a range of corporate, compliance and dispute-related disciplines, as well as deep roots representing the transportation industry. Founded in San Francisco in 1948, where its main office remains, Carroll Burdick also has offices in Böblingen (near Stuttgart), giving the combined firm a significant presence in the center of Germany’s industrial powerhouse of Baden-Württemberg. This office will complement Squire Patton Boggs’ offices in Berlin and Frankfurt, and further solidify its long-term commitment to serving premier German clients with worldwide business. Carroll Burdick also has offices in Hong Kong and Los Angeles, which complement those of Squire Patton Boggs and strengthen the combined firm’s presence in California and the Pacific Rim.\n\n“From the outset of our discussions with Carroll Burdick, it was clear that our firms shared common values, a complementary mix of practices and clients who would mutually benefit from what the other firm brought to the table,” said Squire Patton Boggs’ Global Chairman Mark Ruehlmann. “The needs of our clients have always been the central focus of our firm’s strategic vision. In an increasingly regulated and inter-dependent global economy, our clients rely upon us now more than ever for compliance solutions across virtually all industries. With this combination, and the new relationships that come with it, we have even greater opportunities to better serve our clients with strong and developing global businesses.”\n\n“As we looked to grow and expand the range of services we could offer clients, particularly our premier practice in global product risk coordination, joining a firm with the scale, practice breadth and global reputation of Squire Patton Boggs was a logical step,” said Dr. Matthew Kemner, Chairman of Carroll Burdick, who has been asked to serve as a member of Squire Patton Boggs’ Global Board. “For a global firm of this size, we were impressed with their high level of integration and ability to mobilize client teams across virtually any area of law and geography for the better service of our outstanding global clients. This is a very exciting day for our clients and us.”\n\nThe combination is subject to a limited number of conditions and is expected to become effective in March 2016.\n\nAbout Squire Patton Boggs:\n\nSquire Patton Boggs is one of the world’s strongest integrated legal practices. With 45 offices in 21 countries, the firm is renowned for its local connections and global influence, delivering comprehensive legal services across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.\n\nAbout Carroll, Burdick & McDonough:\n\nA leader in global product risk management and global litigation coordination, Carroll Burdick has over 50 lawyers on three continents, speaking more than 16 languages including German, English, Mandarin Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), French, Italian, Latvian, Malay, Romanian, Russian and Spanish, with over 20 percent of the firm’s lawyers having legal educations in two or more countries. This unparalleled experience provides the cultural insights necessary for effective global legal service that helps our international clients reach their global business goals."
