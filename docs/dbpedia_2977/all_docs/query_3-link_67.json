        "text": "A proposed budget that maintains all Village services and continues work under the Village’s five-year capital improvement program will be presented by the Babylon Village Board this week. The Village’s current budget is $11.8 million, and the proposed budget is $11.04 million.\n\nIf approved, the Village will pass along a tax rate increase of 42 cents, which represents a proposed annual increase for Village taxes of $21 on a home assessed at $5,000.\n\nMost of that increase will go to filling the $846,000 gap in revenue the Village sustained this year as a result of the pandemic, said Mayor Mary Adams\n\n“We worked very hard, going over the budget line by line, with the budget committee, to see what we could cut, what we wanted to keep and what services residents need. We definitely did not want to cut services.\n\nThe losses were primarily due to reductions in fees from the railroad and the court. “People were not going into the city so we did not collect a lot of money from the meters, and the court revenue was down.”\n\nThe Village did see some savings in its annual costs for Worker’s Compensation, as it was put into a better category because of its history of claims. That is likely the result of the safety procedures the Village put into place, said officials.\n\nThe budget hearing will be held virtually on Tues., April 5, 7 p.m. (See budget document below)\n\nIn other business, Mayor Mary Adams announced that the Village has appointed Matthew T. McDonough, the founding member of McDonough PLLC, to serve as the Babylon Village Attorney. McDonough was recently sworn by Mayor Mary Adams. He succeeds Gerard Glass who resigned the position at the end of 2020, and will be paid an annual salary of $75,000.\n\n“It is an absolute honor and privilege to serve as the Village Attorney for Babylon,” stated Village Attorney McDonough. “I look forward to working with the Village Board and village residents to continue to make Babylon Village a great place to own a business and raise a family. I thank the Village Board for their confidence in me.”\n\n“We are excited to have Mr. McDonough as a part of our village team,” said Adams. “I know he will help us continue moving the village forward, while maintaining our village traditions. The quality of life that all residents here in Babylon Village enjoy finds its foundation in our Village Code, and the Board and I have every confidence in Mr. McDonough to strengthen that foundation. I also want to thank Mr. Glass for his outstanding service to the Board and the village.”\n\nPrior to his appointment, McDonough founded McDonough PLLC, a Long Island law firm focusing on counseling and representing clients in sophisticated matters involving corporate law, tax and bankruptcy. He received his B.A. degree from New York University and his J.D. degree from the City University of New York School of Law. Prior to entering private practice, McDonough served as a judicial law clerk to a New York State Supreme Court Justice. McDonough also serves as a Board Member of Jovia Financial Credit Union and was formerly the Chief Executive Officer of the Town of Babylon Industrial Development Agency.\n\nThe Village’s next regular meeting will be April 13. A workshop meeting begins at 7 p.m., followed by the regular board meeting. Both will be available for public review virtually.\n\nFor information on how to access these meetings, go to villageofbabylon.gov."
