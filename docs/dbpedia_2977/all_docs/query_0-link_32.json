        "text": "McDonough has been a leading supplier of band mills for more than 100 years. With knowledge and experience dating back to the 1880s, McDonough’s band mills are built with time-tested features to meet ever-evolving customer and industry needs.\n\nAffectionately known around the shop as 'Zoom Zoom', Austin Legacy has been with McDonough Canada since 2019. Currently the plasma table operator, Austin's nickname comes from the speed at which he zooms around the shop, and his infectious energy and positivity toward his work.\n\nPeter Grant is a man of many talents. Having been with us at McDonough Canada since our launch in 2017, Peter is the painter responsible for applying the trademark McDonough yellow and green to our equipment. One of Peter’s greatest strengths is his versatility; in addition to painting, he can operate every machine in our shop, and works on the assembly of our equipment before helping load it onto the truck and sending it out the door. Enjoying variety in his work, Peter embraces and enjoys the new challenges that he faces each day.\n\nMcDonough Canada recently welcomed Todd Lavingne as the new Production Manager in our Mactaquac, New Brunswick location. A native of New Brunswick, Todd brings with him extensive experience and knowledge in the manufacturing industry, and is happy to be back home after 26 years in Ontario.\n\nA Minute with Matt - the Importance of Cast Iron Wheels is the second video in our new vlog series. McDonough Manufacturing has been building quality sawmill machinery in the U.S. since 1888! Watch this video to learn why Cast Iron Wheels are so important to your saw mill operation.\n\nMcDonough Canada recently welcomed new electrical engineer, Thomas Ryan, to the team. Learn more about his interests, his time in Cyprus as part of a military family, and his role at McDonough.\n\nThe Sterling YieldBoss Hybrid Edger System is a revolutionary new approach to edging that combines the benefits of optimized saw placement with the simplicity of a manual edger system. An affordable system in a whole new class of edgers created by McDonough, a Sterling YieldBoss Hybrid Edger fits in the space between our line of McDonough fully optimized edgers that return the highest yields, and manual edgers that leave everything up to your operator.\n\nRyan Hemauer is a machinist in our Eau Claire shop, who brought a wealth of experience, education and a strong work ethic along with him. Learn more about his work experience and advice to future machinists in our one-on-one interview."
