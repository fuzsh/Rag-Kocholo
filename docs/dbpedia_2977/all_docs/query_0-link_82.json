        "text": "Tell us, who is Roger Moss?\n\nI’m originally from Chattanooga, but I’ve lived in Savannah for the past 20 years.\n\nAfter high school I moved to Chicago to pursue a bachelor degree in Interpersonal Communications at Wheaton College. I’ve held many titles: assistant human resources director, a radio and camera tech on Capitol Hill, an insurance underwriter, and a malpractice insurance underwriter...I also have over 20 years of experience in advertising, and I’m an actor and a singer.\n\nSince my time in Savannah, I’ve founded the Coastal Youth Choir in Bluffton, co-founded the Savannah Children’s Choir, and I’m currently the Chief Operations Officer for the Savannah Exploratory Charter Academy.\n\nSo what brought you to Savannah?\n\nMy career brought me here. At the time, I was working in radio advertising back in Chattanooga and I was actually recruited to relocate to work for a competitor here and I haven’t looked back since.\n\nI remember calling a friend of mine after I had just moved here saying that I felt like I was at summer camp. Savannah’s just a natural community and it’s stunningly beautiful.\n\nMy career may have brought me here, but it was the combination of those two things that sold me to stay.\n\nYou’ve co-founded quite a few organizations in the Savannah area, what made you want to pursue those ventures?\n\nWell, two of my biggest passions are music and education. As part of my continuous commitment to music and education, I wanted to put my two biggest passions together and also help the children in the community.\n\nWhat has been the most rewarding thing about working with children?\n\nSeeing them thrive! I’m no longer with the Savannah Children’s Choir but it’s a really great organization that I continue to support.\n\nThey have an academic requirement and when I was with the choir, 99% of the kids that went through the program went to college.\n\nDuring my time there, I traveled with the kids and saw them become absolute incredible performers. That was very rewarding for me!\n\nWhat made you want to become a singer?\n\nThe American Songbook! Which is interesting because I moved to Savannah, the home of Johnny Mercer and the “God” of American Songbook.\n\nDo you have a personal mantra?\n\nI do. I always say “If I can do something I’d rather do something.” I’m a doer and a dreamer...I’m constantly dreaming of solutions to problems and following through with them.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about performing in Savannah?\n\nWell I love that there’s a very active audience for music here. The music scene has also really grown in the 20 years that I’ve been here and it’s been fascinating to see. I’ve been lucky enough to perform with both the Savannah Symphony Orchestra and the Beaufort and Hilton Head Symphony Orchestras\n\nWhat’s your latest musical venture?\n\nAbout four years ago I partnered with piano player Kim Steiner, and we started a Cabaret set. We’ve been performing together since and I’ve also been able to bring in some of my friends from Broadway to perform with us. It’s been great.\n\nIf you could only spend one night in Savannah, what would you do?\n\nThere’s so many great restaurants here, so I can’t narrow it down to one. I think if I only had just one night...I’d like to have a nice dinner somewhere, listen to some great musi, and relax.\n\nWhat was the last song you had stuck in your head?\n\n“Moon River” by Johnny Mercer!\n\nIf people could remember one thing about you, what would you want that to be?\n\nThat I cared and that I did.\n\nCelebrate Roger’s birthday with The Great American Songbook, Broadway, Pop, Soul & Jazz, on Thurs., Oct. 7, 7 p.m. at Billy’s Place at McDonough's, 20 E. Perry St., 2nd floor. $35"
