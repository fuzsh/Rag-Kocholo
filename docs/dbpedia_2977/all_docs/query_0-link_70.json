        "text": "“I told you all I wanted to stay here for the remainder of my career,” he said, harkening back to a conversation he had with reporters at the start of training camp. “Obviously, that would equal more [years]. But I only have one year left. I mean, I think with more years would come more money. That’s usually how contracts work. But it’s not up to me.”\n\nJudon was asked if there was a comparable contract that the sides could use as a potential framework. He acknowledged that based on last year — when he was injured and played only three-plus games — the current market is probably not going to be favorable. What he does believe is that he deserves a bump.\n\n“We have a market, it’s set by the highest guy, and everybody falls in line until the next person is up to break that contract,” he said. “Coming from the season I had, I was injured, mostly all season. That’s really not where my market is. Like I said, I don’t think it’s 6.5.”\n\nJudon is in his fourth season with the Patriots. The 31-year-old pass rusher has 32 sacks in 38 career games with New England.\n\nSince the end of last season, the Patriots have doled out several contracts to returning players. It’s a group that includes defensive linemen Christian Barmore and Davon Godchaux, linebacker Joshua Uche, safeties Kyle Dugger and Jabrill Peppers, offensive lineman Mike Onwenu, running back Rhamondre Stevenson, and tight end Hunter Henry. Many of those players have advocated for Judon to be next in line.\n\n“I still want to see my brother Matthew Judon get his contract,” Godchaux said after his new deal was finalized recently. “As we all know, it’s a business. But he deserves to have a new contract. We’re all pulling for him, because he’s been a relentless pass rusher for us for the last three years.”\n\nJudon has drawn plenty of attention over the first 10 practices of the summer. There was his public pronouncement on the first day of camp. And last Monday — the first day in pads for the Patriots — Judon was at practice but was sitting off to the side as a nonparticipant. He left after animated conversations with head coach Jerod Mayo as well as team executives Eliot Wolf and Matt Groh.\n\n“We had a conversation,” Judon said. “I didn’t want to be a distraction to the team, so I went inside. I wasn’t participating in those drills that day. So I went inside. Then I got a message, so I came back and talked to the GM. Our GMs. Then I went back inside.”\n\nMayo sounded a positive note after Judon’s departure, saying that they had a “great meeting” and everyone was moving forward.\n\n“I feel like that’s every conversation, regardless of the emotions that are involved,” Judon said. “You try to get to an understanding. Just because we don’t agree doesn’t mean we don’t understand each other’s side.”\n\nAfter the flap last Monday, the linebacker was not present at practice Tuesday. After the off-day Wednesday, he returned last Thursday.\n\nAs was the case earlier this summer, Judon cited Wolf and Groh, saying they’re the ones holding all the cards.\n\n“I’ll be telling you, they come out here every day,” he said. “You all just don’t ask them questions. You all don’t ask them questions.\n\n“You got to talk to them, man. Like I told you all before, I would pay myself and we would never talk about it. It’s not up to me.”\n\nJudon is usually a high-energy presence at practice, but the last week, he’s been unusually low-key, coming up the back way and not engaging nearly as much as he has in the past. Asked about the change, Judon shrugged and said that’s his usual approach when the pads go on.\n\nAsked about his current level of frustration and whether that might relate to his contract status, he was quick to answer.\n\n“I got to play,” he said. “I didn’t say [anything] about practice. I have to go out there and play. I have to play the game. I have to do what I’m contracted and obligated to do so I don’t lose money.\n\n“I told you all, man. There’s football and there’s the football business. They’re two different things. I love playing football. I love my teammates. I don’t like the business of football.”"
