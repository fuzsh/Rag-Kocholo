        "text": "Yesterday, Congress enacted Statute #14.671/2023 amending Statute #6.437/1977 to include article 28-A. Statute #6.437/1977 set forth the violations to the food and drug legislation and the procedure under which the Agency will impose respective penalties. Article 28-A expressly sets the possibility of entering into an agreement with Anvisa and the other relevant authorities to reach a compromise in respect to penalties due to food and drug violations. Theoretically, entering into those type of agreements was already a possibility under article 26 of Statute #4.657/1942, but Congress felt that inserting a clear provision in the statute dealing with violations to the food and drug would be better. Besides establishing the necessary requirements to enable the settlement of the agreement and a 90-day deadline for the request to be reviewed, the new provision establishes the day of the filing of the request as the starting point for the stay of penalties (if the agreement is signed, naturally). Penalties applied prior to the filing of request will continue to be enforceable. Article 28-A also states that the settlement of the agreement must be executed \"in the form of a regulation\", which possibly will be issued in the near future. A clear provision allowing such agreements within the context of food and drug violations is good news if taken as a sign of a real change in Anvisa`s approach towards the matter. In a piece published in 2021 we criticized the fact that Anvisa had signed some agreements such as this within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, but none related to food and drug violations (https://lnkd.in/d4FTg4JR).\n\nFDA #Waiver or Alteration of Informed #Consent for Minimal #Risk #Clinical Investigations #NEWS This final rule implements the statutory changes made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by the Cures Act to allow for a waiver or alteration of informed consent when a clinical investigation poses no more than minimal risk to the human subject and includes appropriate safeguards to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects. The rule will permit an IRB to waive or alter certain informed consent elements or to waive the requirement to obtain informed consent, under limited conditions, for certain minimal risk clinical investigations.\n\nFDA Announces Open Registration for Fifth Online Controlled Substances Summit On July 25-26, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in partnership with the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, will host FDA‚Äôs fifth ‚ÄúOnline Controlled Substances Summit,‚Äù a two-day virtual public meeting that will focus on identifying innovative solutions to reduce the illegal availability of controlled substances online. The illegal sale of controlled substances over the internet poses significant health risks to consumers of all ages. We are deeply concerned about the continued availability of controlled substances, such as opioids, benzodiazepines and stimulants‚Äîthrough social media, websites and other online platforms. This availability increases our public health concerns due to the heightened risks associated with the combined use of these products. https://lnkd.in/gRXV9zHS\n\nThe Department of Justice (‚ÄúDOJ‚Äù) proposes to transfer mj from schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (‚ÄúCSA‚Äù) to schedule III of the CSA, consistent with the view of the Department of Health and Human Services (‚ÄúHHS‚Äù) that mj has a currently accepted medical use as well as HHS's views about mj's abuse potential and level of physical or psychological dependence. The CSA requires that such actions be made through formal rulemaking on the record after opportunity for a hearing. If the transfer to schedule III is finalized, the regulatory controls applicable to schedule III controlled substances would apply, as appropriate, along with existing mj-specific requirements and any additional controls that might be implemented, including those that might be implemented to meet U.S. treaty obligations. If mj is transferred into schedule III, the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of would remain subject to the applicable criminal prohibitions of the CSA. Any drugs containing a substance within the CSA's definition of ‚Äúmj‚Äù would also remain subject to the applicable prohibitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. DOJ is soliciting comments on this proposal thru July 22.
