First-up, he takes a look at Matt McDonough . . .\n\nMatt McDonough profile\n\nBorn: 26/1/94\n\nHeight: 180cm\n\nWeight: 84kg\n\nRecruited from: Flinders Park (SA),/Woodville-West Torrens (SANFL)\n\nDraft history: Selected by Richmond at pick 42 overall in the 2012 National Draft\n\nAFL debut: Round 21, 2013 v Carlton, MCG\n\nAFL games: 1\n\nAFL goals: 0\n\nTim Clarke says: “He came to us as a small forward, but ended up playing more midfield than forward.\n\n“His best game, he had 13 or 14 clearances and over 30 touches, so he can really find the ball.\n\n“His ability to use it is second to none at the Club . . . he’s got a really good leg on him.\n\n“He kicks goals and marks the ball really well, so he’s a really exciting prospect . . . probably a Paul Chapman type of player, who’s hopefully going to have an impact at senior level next year.”"
