        "text": "He might be a leading heartthrob in Hollywood, but Matthew McConaughey checks all the boxes of a laid-back Southern gent, and these quotes prove it. He's a Texas-born mama's boy and die-hard Longhorn fan with a signature syrupy drawl, a penchant for whiskey, and love for his Lone Star community, which he shows in fun ways like crashing a virtual meeting of 900 Texas teachers. His charismatic spirit is enough to make anyone want to be his friend. His best quotes on living, loving, being a parent, why he loves the South, and his relationship with his equally charming Southern mother whom he calls K-Mac really convince us why.\n\nRead on for 75 quotes by Matthew McConaughey that show why he'll always be one of our favorite Southerners.\n\nMatthew McConaughey on His Mother\n\nWhen Matthew McConaughey speaks about his mother, Kay McConaughey aka \"K-Mac,\" the source of his quirky humor is clear. But Kay is more than the life of the party—this no-nonsense Texas mom imparts plenty of wisdom on living your best life.\n\n\"I do not remember the last time when we partied when she didn't go to bed after me and get up before me.\"\n\n\"One day, I said, 'Mom no one forgives themselves quicker than you. Do you ever have any regret, or do you ever at the end of the day say, \"I could work on that?\" She goes, 'Honey, every single night when I go to bed, I have a long list of those things. But the thing is, when I wake up in the morning, I've forgot them all.'\"\n\n\"I got a mother who, you know, knows that all of my talents came from her, and she needs to be up there, and she didn't get her chance to be in the Golden Girls. So now is her chance, so come on with it.\"\n\n\"Mom prepared me to be an actor long before my first audition. ...She'd say, 'You don't walk into a room like you want to buy the place. You walk in like you own it.'\"\n\n\"She was a typical Texan mom. She would stand no nonsense. If I woke in a grumpy mood she'd come up to me and—wham!—hit me on the side of the head.\"\n\n\"I answered to Matt one time when I was in kindergarten, when my mom was my teacher. ...Next thing I know I feel a hand on my shoulder pull me back and body-slam me to the ground—and it was my mother. ...Then she said 'Don't you ever answer to that again—I named you Matthew on purpose.'\"\n\n\"My mom was 77 when we moved [to Austin]. She's 85 now. I realized that is fourth quarter stuff, so I said, 'Let's get down closer to mom.' So now, we see her every weekend instead of twice a year. That was important to the kids, important to Camila and I, and important to my mom.\"\n\n\"I was set for law school at the University of Texas, but then decided I wanted to go to film school. Believe me, I was dreading telling my mother and father... So when I summoned up enough courage to tell them, there was long silence. Then they asked, 'Is that what you want?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'You had better go and do it, then.'\"\n\n\"She's a woman that says I'm going to before she can, I would before she could, and I'll be there before she's invited.\"\n\n\"She's a true baller, living proof that the value of denial depends on one's level of commitment to it. She beat two types of cancer on nothing more than aspirin and denial.\"\n\nMatthew McConaughey Texas Quotes\n\nIs there any question that the Texas Longhorns superfan and UT minister of culture is from the Lone Star State? Matthew McConaughey might have spent a few years in L.A., but now that he's home he has plenty to say about the state where he was born and raised. Hook 'em, Horns.\n\n\"Steinbeck says it's a state of mind...In Texas, there is a certain honor of being a Texan that is a measure of doing something the best that you can.\"\n\n\"You have your name—McConaughey...You have your nation—because you're American. You have, if you're a believer, because of God. And in Texas, you have a fourth measure. It's because you're a Texan.\"\n\n\"But there is a real independence in Texas.
