        "text": "Think about how the 3 principles of Universal Design for Learning are related to activation of each of the 3 areas of the brain identified in the diagram. The 3 principles are:\n\nMultiple Means of Representation\n\nMultiple Means of Action and Expression, and\n\nMultiple Means of Engagement.\n\n4. Explain how the definitions of the regions of the brain in the first diagram relate to the 3 regions of the brain in the second. (Maximum 100 words)\n\nThe first diagram gives the basic labels of the brain and the major functions they control. The second diagram shows how different parts of the brain are related to learning. For example, the frontal lobe which controls thinking, memory, and behavior relates to the “how” of learning. The parietal lobe which controls language and touch relates to the “what” of learning, or how students demonstrate information and content in different ways. The “why” of learning spreads to the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes and relates to how the student is stimulated and motivated to learn.\n\n5. Given the information in the two diagrams above, explain the 3 Principles of Universal Design (Multiple means of Representation, Multiple Means of Action and Expression and Multiple Means of Engagement) in terms of how they relate to brain function. (Maximum 300 words)\n\nThe first of the three principles is “multiple means of representation” and it is largely represented in the parietal lobe (language and touch), occipital lobe (sight), and also the temporal lobe (hearing, learning and feeling). The first principle covers multiple parts of the brain because each student learns differently whether that be a visual learner, physical learner, or aural learner. This first principle ensures that all types of learners have diverse options of material to learn from. The second principle, “Multiple means of action” relates to the frontal lobe of the brain. This lobe is responsible for planning and performing tasks. Also, it controls how we organize and express our ideas. The third principle, “multiple means of engagement” is slightly different because it is represented by all three major parts of the brain. It controls how students become engaged and stay motivated to learn which requires the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. The videos on the CAST sight explain that how we learn is as unique as our fingerprints. UDL is meant to include all of these various learning styles to ensure that no one type of learner is left behind.\n\n6. How does this help you understand the 3 principles of UDL? Given this information, how you might structure each principle in the classroom? (Maximum 400 words)\n\nKnowing how the different parts of the brain apply to how students learn, makes implementing UDL in a classroom more effective. It is common knowledge that students learn in different ways. By understanding how the brain functions, educators better understand the importance of diversifying how information is presented so that all types of learners benefit. To effectively implement the three principles of UDL, one must create a curriculum that centers around the different ways of how information can be learned and retained. The first principle, “Multiple means of representation” can be implemented by providing several ways of presenting information. For example, in my classroom I would have a video, a workbook activity, a “hands-on” activity, and perhaps audio (podcast) that would all focus on the main objective to be learned. For the second principle, “multiple means of action” I would provide different activities that would allow students to express what they have learned whether that be a verbal discussion (group work) and quizzes. Not all students are best suited to writing what they have learned, but instead are stronger at verbally discussing a topic among peers rather than demonstrating in on a written test. For the third principle, “multiple means of engagement” I would create as many group activities that I could because many students prefer to work with others. I could also create individual assignments that would cater to those students who are introverted and learn best on their own. It really comes down to gaining students’ interest and keeping them engaged through various activities.\n\n7. Extend your thinking. Recall what you have learned about the similarities and differences among children from ITL404 or ITL604. Explain 2 ways UDL can be an effective means for addressing the learning needs of both typical and atypical students. (Maximum 200 words)\n\nFirst of all, I do not believe that there is such thing as a “typical” learner because everyone learns differently. However, UDL can be effective for students with general-education students AND students with learning disabilities. For example, UDL focuses on creating as much diversity in activities and information as possible so that all types of learners have equal opportunities to learn. Jake, a special-ed student and Rebecca, a general-ed student are both visual learners. Presenting the desired information to be learned in the form of a video will help both of them to process and retain that information better than giving each of them a packet containing the same information. Although both students might not process the information the same, they both have a better chance of being successful if their learning types are catered to. UDL is designed to ensure that no matter what type of student “typical and atypical”, all will have equal opportunity to learn the information in the way that best fits them.\n\n8. How easy or difficult do you think it will be to effectively implement the principles of UDL in your own classroom? Why do you think so; provide rationales? (Maximum 150 words)\n\nPersonally, I do not think it will be difficult to implement the three principles of UDL in my classroom. Given modern technology and the continuing research on how different students learn in different ways, most curriculums are designed specifically to implement the three principles of UDL. Making it effective might be more difficult because it will take a lot of trial and error to figure out the needs of each individual student. Over time, teachers begin to see results of various activities stretching across the three principles and then are able to determine what type of learner each student is. Teachers also figure out students’ strengths and weaknesses based on test scores and the student’s overall success on classroom activities. I would like to give the students multiple options on an assignment so that all types of learners will have a chance to demonstrate their knowledge in the way they are best able to"
