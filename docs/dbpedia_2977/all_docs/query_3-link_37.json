        "text": "D\n\nDenise cobb posted a condolence\n\nMatt and I go way back. He and I met at Win Records & Video. I trained him to be a sales rep. He and I became very close,but in this last year lost touch. I see why now. I loved him so much and he will always be forever in my heart. God Bless his family. RIP my friend.\n\nR\n\nRichard Baker posted a condolence\n\nMatty, what can i say, you were and are one of a kind. Always a gentlemen and a friend to many. Incredible zest for life, a true family man. When i ran into u recently , all my troubles went away,cause you turned my saddness into a smile. Happy to know you and call you my friend. Amen brother\n\nC\n\nChet & Dawn Tozzi posted a condolence\n\nRIP MATTY! You were one of a kind & truly loved. My sincerest condolences to your family. I didn't get to see you often but when I did you always put a smile on my face.\n\nM\n\nMadelyn O'Boyle posted a condolence\n\nI haven't seen Matt since shortly after we graduated from St. Rose of Lima in 1973, but I remember him fondly. A sweet guy, with a ready smile and the ability to brighten your day just by running into him. My deepest sympathy to the McDonough family. You are in my prayers. Matty you will be missed. Warm regards, Madelyn Buckley-O'Boyle\n\nT\n\nTerry Cusmano posted a condolence\n\nI will always love him for the way he called me his chick. We laughed our asses off many times at our get togethers. He was Matty the fire inspector when he played that part to scare the crap out of my daughter and her friends. Or, when he and I, at a block party jumped into Susan's pool with our cloths on to play beer pong with Anthony Susan's son. What a blast. He was larger than life nd always made me feel so good. He could make a bad situation a good one with his knowledge and wit. I will surely miss him. My family will miss him. Love you Matty.\n\nD\n\nDonna Swan posted a condolence\n\nI cannot believe Matty is gone. We met when I was 4 yrs old, and up until last week he was my morning text burst. He was very strict about the days of the week and their appropriate attire and greetings. Toga Tuesday and Thong Thursday were our favorites. I will miss him but I will continue to hold him close to my heart. I loved him dearly. Matt Monroe, International Superstar, till the end. Eddie and Mr. McDonough, I'm sorry for your loss doesn't even begin to touch how I feel. I hope knowing that Matty isn't suffering anymore can bring some comfort.\n\nP\n\nPatty Mulligan Gorman posted a condolence\n\nMy heart goes out to the family and friends of Matty. He was a lifelong friend of my daughter's, Grace Crehan and Patti DiTomasso. May he rest in peace and may God comfort everyone concerned. He is no longer suffering and rests in God's arms.\n\nS\n\nSusan Napoli Russo posted a condolence\n\nTo my best friend in this world, my world will never be the same without you in it. I am blessed to have had you as my friend. The fun, laughter, tears and secrets we shared are in my heart forever. The memories of you will go on and on, and you will once again make us all laugh. Laughing through the tears now thinking of the crazy fun we had. We love you and miss you terribly. Love, (your family in a box) Susan, Mike, Michael, Anthony and Michelle. Polly too (even my dog, would pee with excitement when she saw you). Love you forever\n\nM\n\nMike posted a condolence\n\nMatty, from the moment you burst into 773 while Diana and I were sitting there, on maybe our third visit, we have been among your biggest fans. And I use the word \"fans\" in the truest sense if the word. You were celebrity, we were fanatics. Your love of life, sense of humor and strict, but benevolent rule over you kingdom left no o room in our hearts for anything but love for you. Thank you for not banishing Diana and I from your illustrious, fantastic kingdom. To your family and long-time friends, please know that you Uncle Mattu is lived and has touched more lives than you will ever know. We love you Matty. -Mike and Diana\n\nM\n\nMarie G posted a condolence\n\nTo all of Matt's friends and family, May his memory live on in your hearts forever so you will never really lose him May he be in the arms of the angels and may God comfort you here on earth."
