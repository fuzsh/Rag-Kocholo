        "text": "FitFlop x Habitat for Humanity\n\nI moved to my flat in Notting Hill three years ago, after a short but tumultuous period of bouncing around from house to flat, and at one point, hotel room to friend’s sofas. Although still an ongoing process, slowly making this little one-bedroom flat, with its creaky black floor boards and New York loft style exposed brick and sky lights, my own, has been a total joy. Saving up for things has taken time, and in some cases, some extreme willpower (fixing windows over buying new shoes, for instance, takes the strength of an ox…!) and the arrival of my long-lusted after jade velvet sofa of dreeeeeams this month, just in time for my impending hibernation, has been a triumph.\n\nMy bathroom is covered in Matthew Williamson for Osborne and Little butterfly wallpaper, my wardrobe, in House of Hackney colobus monkeys, and Jo Malone candles and photographs of my beloved niece Safari Willow and nephew Zac cover most of the surfaces. Monkey book ends, giant coral prints, a Rosanna Lonsdale zebra lamp, and my framed Guy Malin leopard balloon photograph all remind me of where I’m from in Africa. Stepping into my flat after a crazy day whizzing around London, throwing off my boots, popping on my slippers and attacking some Jaffa Cakes, makes me feel calm, cosy, and safe…\n\nBasically, I feel at home.\n\nI know, the word LUCKY springs to mind. Especially when one in five people across the world are living in slums or substandard housing, propelling them into a grinding cycle of poverty. When someone lacks a home, their health, well-being, educational prospects and ability to earn a living all become affected.\n\nWith this in mind, FitFlop are supporting Habitat for Humanity this year, a global non-profit organisation which helps build homes for families in need around the world, offering them strength, stability and self-reliance through much-needed shelter. 20% from each purchase of a pair of FitFlop House Slippers, in all their cloud-like double shearling and fluffy pom pom glory, is made to Habitat for Humanity.\n\nSince 1976, Habitat for Humanity has worked tirelessly to provide access to decent housing for families in over 70 countries. From building homes and providing villages with clean drinking water, to natural disaster relief and micro-finance, this organisation have amazingly helped over 10 million people worldwide.\n\nThe FitFlop House Slippers are available in two different colour ways, and I was immediately drawn to the charcoal grey pair with midnight blue pom poms. Not only have I practically not taken them off, but several of my friends have already gone and bought themselves a pair after seeing mine. With Christmas fast approaching, these make the perfect ‘Buy to Give’ present… Even if that present miiiight be to yourself… Hey, no one’s judging here!\n\nOh, and if that wasn’t enough, this pair of beyond comfortable, limited edition LOVE Slippers also see 20% from each sale go to support Habitat for Humanity’s life-changing work. What’s not to LOOOOOOVE, huh?!\n\n“At FitFlop, people put their hearts and souls into making the world’s best ergonomic footwear, because they believe that if you want to live an inspired life, you’ve got to start with a great foundation. And while a great pair of shoes will improve your life, a safe decent home is the ultimate foundation.”\n\nMarcia Kilgore, Founder of FitFlop.\n\n“We’re really excited to be partnering with FitFlop on this venture. Both of our organisations are passionate about making a sustainable difference and FitFlop’s vision for solid foundations aligns perfectly with ours.”\n\nNaomi Rothwell, Habitat for Humanity GB Corporate Partnerships Manager\n\nIn collaboration with FitFlop\n\nPhotography: Francis Davison\n\nHair and Makeup: Secret Spa\n\n#FITFLOPxHABITATFORHUMANITY\n\nKiki McDonough's Jemima Collection\n\nIf there is one thing I share in common with London-based jeweller Kiki McDonough, aside from us both clearly being magpies, its our love of COLOUR. Kiki’s kaleidoscopic use of gemstones, coupled with her amazing eye for detail, result in the most stunning statement pieces you’ll triumphantly treasure for maaaaany years to come.\n\nWith a father and grandfather both involved in the antique jewellery industry, jewellery design might have seemed an obvious route for Kiki McDonough to have taken. However, at this time, there were very few people designing everyday investment pieces, ones which could be worn everyday, and for any occasion. Designing show-stopping yet wearable designs soon became Kiki’s aim, and this more modern view of jewellery, alongside her love of unique, bold colour combinations, soon placed Kiki at the forefront of British jewellery design, a pedestal where she has comfortably perched for over thirty years.\n\nThe idea of wearing your most precious jewels, your ‘Sunday Best’ sparklers, on a random Tuesday, with jeans and a ‘just ‘cos’ attitude, appeals to me hugely. Not to be too fatalistic, but given we never know what is just around the corner, why save the enjoyment of wearing our most beloved possessions for such rare occasions? I used to save certain dresses and shoes for special events, and now I basically do the washing up in ball gowns! Likewise, Kiki McDonough’s spectacular jewels are without doubt meant to be cherished, but they are also meant to be worn – and on all occasions!\n\nThe theme of this contemporary opulence has extended into Kiki McDonough’s latest Jemima Collection, designed in collaboration with their ambassador, Jemima Jones. Inspired by their mutual love of Rome, taking inspiration from the city’s beautiful architecture, culture, style and history, this collection is characterised by the the Ancient Roman’s everyday use of striking patterns and colourful gemstones.\n\nBeing able to adorn myself one afternoon in Kiki McDonough's striking Jemima Collection was beyond a pleasure! The designs comprise four chunky rings, six chain bracelets, six pairs of earrings, and nine pendants, all in beautifully contrasting and unique gemstone variations, including Lemon Quartz, Green Amethyst, Lavender Amethyst, Blue Topaz and White Topaz. There is definitely a style to suit everyone, but being the maximalist I am, I couldn’t just stop at just one… My initial response was to stack various combinations of these beauties all together, which I wore for a sunny afternoon wander about my Notting Hill neighbourhood, to Albert’s Club (below) later that evening, and for some very bleary eyed meetings the next day…! The results were all equally as breath taking.\n\nYes, these Kiki McDonough pieces do push the usual self-imposed spending boundaries of my ‘treat ‘yo’self’ guidelines (the Jemima Collection is upwards of £1900.00) but when you consider the amount of wear (and compliments) each piece will garner over the years, I feel decidedly more confident of recommending these investments. So yeah, go on, treat yo’self (and me, please...?! Merci, mon cheri!)\n\nThe Jemima Collection is available to buy online, and from Kiki McDonough’s flagship Chelsea shop.\n\nIn Collaboration with Kiki McDonough\n\nNotting Hill Photographs: Ella Sadika\n\nSouth Kensington Photographs: Eva Salvi\n\nHair: Taylor Taylor London\n\nNails: Sophie Gass\n\nShop TLC's Look...\n\n(Click on the images for direct links)\n\nFriday Feathers with Matthew Williamson\n\nThere is nothing, nooothing, that can put you in more of a party mood than one of Matthew Williamson’s signature cocktail dresses. From the intricate, sparkling embellishment, to their ostrich-feather trimmed skirt, these show stopping, conversation starting, razamatazz inducing, form-fitting dresses are unashamedly feminine and oodles fun. Some of my most frivolous and fanciful nights in London have been spent shimmying around in one of these fancies. Ohhhh, the stories they could (but thankfully won’t) tell…!\n\nI recently enjoyed the most unashamedly girly morning with the ‘Gown Gang’ playing dress up in Matthew Williamson’s new Belvoir Collection (see more here). With Brown’s Hotel acting as our lavish host, Charlotte Tilbury’s team on hand to make us look our best, and an army of Jimmy Choo beauties standing to attention, I couldn’t help but try the Matthew’s latest, one-of-a-kind, Rose Lace Feather delight on to share with you. Friday - Watch out, buddy!\n\nAbove: Wearing the 9ct Gold Satao (RRP. £140.00) and the Silver Shina (RRP. £50.00) bracelets from my Tembo Collection with Auree Jewellery (100% profits of entire collection go to For Rangers and wildlife conservation across Africa - See More Here) and an Assya London Oriental Cross Ring (RRP. £195.00)\n\nShop TLC's Look...\n\nTLC LOVES...

Charlotte Tilbury’s amazing team were on hand to give us all gorgeous make-overs.\n\nAfter each choosing one of the show stopping dresses to wear, and grabbing a pair of Cinderella worthy Jimmy Choo's, we braced the chilly streets of London for our multi-coloured Sun Dance (a little like a Rain Dance but with less stomping, and a lot more of our signature swooshing!)\n\nNow, we don’t want to compleeeeetely take credit for the recent heavenly rays shining through the grey… But I don’t want to fully discount this theory either.

I thought I would also share the answers with you here on TLC…\n\n‘We are excited to be collaborating with Kelly Eastwood on our first charity collection. As major advocates of travel, flair and colour – we’ve long been fans of The London Chatter, which is why its been a delight to create The Tembo Collection to raise money and awareness in the fight against Elephant poaching. So a second first for The Auree Journal, we thought a good chance for a cuppa and a Q+A. Move over Parky...'\n\nWhat was it like to grow up in Africa and how has it influenced you?\n\nIt was really magical; the animals, the epic landscapes, the beautiful beaches, the amazing mix of cultures. From an early age I was always aware of ‘the bigger picture’ and as such, however exciting and frivolous the whirlwind I sometimes find myself in, I always feel pretty grounded.\n\nTell us how the collaboration with Auree came about?\n\nHaving worn a personalised Auree bracelet rather religiously for about a year before finally meeting Amelia, we decided to meet for breakfast so I could learn more about the brand. It became apparent we both wanted to do a charity collection, and over avocado and eggs we not only decided to collaborate, but had already started sketching designs before the bill had even arrived. Amelia was very supportive over my plea to support the conservation efforts for elephants in Africa, a huge passion of mine. We agreed that neither myself or Auree would make a bean out of the collaboration, with all profits going directly to For Rangers, a wonderful campaign started by friends of mine back home.\n\nHow did your Kenyan roots inspire the Tembo collection?\n\nSince I was a child, I’ve always been absolutely in awe of elephants; rather than Nellie the Elephant it was Kelly the Elephant! As well as going on safari regularly, I would frequently visit the orphaned ele’s at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust near where I grew up in Nairobi, which allowed me from an early age to be acutely aware of the heartbreaking effects of poaching. As I’ve got older, many of my friends now work in conservation, and I’ve learnt so much more through them.\n\nI love Maasai beads and the design of our bracelets were inspired by the single white Maasai bead bracelet I usually wear. The beads are so synonymous with the tribal, nomadic cultures back in Kenya, that it seemed an obvious element to incorporate into the jewellery, through the textured circular bead effect. I also now have permanent Maasai beading around my ankles, put on by the Samburu mamas at Ol Malo, a family-run ranch in Laikipia, which I regularly flaunted at London Fashion Week – paired with some good old Jimmy Choos naturally!\n\nYou are a frequent wildlife campaigner, what attracts you most about the important work For Rangers and Tusk carry out?\n\nI think it’s the urgency, and the respect. Make no mistake, this is ultimately a war – a battle to save some of the most iconic wildlife before it’s too late, and it’s the rangers who are on the front line of this fight, daily risking their lives for these animals. For this reason, they deserve our recognition and support. Earlier this year I visited Kenya’s beautiful Lewa conservancy, where I saw Edward Ndiritu (who was awarded with Tusk’s inaugural Wildlife Ranger Award, presented by Prince William in 2015) and his team awarded with silver pins of honor for their outstanding work, and the pride was tangible.\n\nFor Rangers is a really small, grass roots campaign, with no overhead costs. It’s headed by passionate, knowledgeable people who have taken on extraordinary challenges to raise both money and awareness (including the Marathon de Sable and the Peruvian Jungle Run). Given that I’m hardly renowned for my athleticism (I’ve not moved quicker than a strut since the mid-90’s), I thought I would be better suited to help the cause accessorising not exercising…!\n\nWhat has been your most memorable experience in Africa?\n\nI’m having a stream of flashbacks of both the most exhilarating and also peaceful moments. Aside from my sister’s week long beach wedding near our home, and regularly visiting the Giraffe Manor’s endangered Rothschild giraffe after school when I was young, I would say anytime I’ve been lucky enough to go on safari. Watching a sensational African sunset, G&T in hand (obviously), with that buzz of wildlife around you, is beyond humbling, and for me, completely calming\n\nWhat are your little black book entries and insider advice for anyone looking to visit Kenya?\n\nin Nairobi. If you’re not staying as a guest at this beautiful house, I would definitely try and book in advance to have afternoon tea there amongst the endangered Rothschild giraffe that live at the sanctuary. I would obviously recommend you go on safari to enjoy the exceptional wildlife we’re so desperately trying to preserve, and Richard’s Camp in the Maasai Mara is really great fun. For unforgettable experiences with the nomadic Samburu communities, both Ol Malo and Sasaab offer unbeatable opportunities. I would also head to the coast. Some of Kenya’s long, white sandy beaches are rated amongst the best in the world. Watamu, a pristine marine reserve, is perfect for a family holiday, and not too far from Mombasa, where you can spend an evening sailing along the twinkling lit coast on the Tamarind Dhow.\n\nWhat are your must have items that you pack in your suitcase for a trip to Kenya?\n\nInside my vintage-style Brics Suitcase, I always carry my Ali Lamu safari bag so I can decant and travel light from within Kenya at a moment’s notice. A good pair of Penelope Chilvers safari boots are imperative, and I love my massive Winser London massive cashmere for both the airplane and for enveloping myself in on those chilly early morning game drives on Safari. When the suns up, I’m always prepared with a good straw trilby from Jess Collett Milliner, my tortoiseshell Taylor Morris Zero sunglasses, a bikini or two from Beach Cafe, a Pitusa kaftan, my Sisley Paris Factor 50 and a kikoi bought locally from a beach stall. Rae Feather does some great personalised beach baskets and I throw everything haphazardly into one of those.\n\nTell us about your most treasured piece of jewellery and the story behind it.\n\nA Victorian pearl and sapphire heart-shaped locket in the shape of a heart. My childhood best friend passed away when we were eighteen, and her mother gave it to me. There are flowers in the the back of it which my friend pressed and helped put in there when she was four. It’s my treasure of treasures.\n\nWhat do you love most about your job?\n\nIn or out of London, I love the variety of the people I meet in such different fields, and being witness to such differing creativity. This platform has not only given me the ability to talk about and share the things I love, but also to champion the causes that are close to my heart, which is something I really focus on.\n\nHow would you describe your personal style?\n\nAlways colourful, always with lipstick (Tom Ford’s Plum Lush) and always with a touch of leopard print.\n\nBy Day: Topshop boyfriend jeans, Rose Rankin sneakers, over sized Boden linen shirts and Chinti and Parker cashmere (I particularly love their new Miffy collaboration – too cute!) I carry all my work and laptop in the tortoiseshell Aspinal of London Editor’s Bag – it’s so chic and even charges my phone – next level!\n\nBy Night: Jimmy Choo heels or L.K Bennett boots, Hill & Friends Tweency bag, and a swooshing Matthew Williamson dress. A blow dry or ethereal braids by Clo and Flo ups my glam game considerably.\n\nWhat are your style tips for wearing jewellery?\n\nI love stacking and mixing metals, which is why I particularly love the Tembo Collection – you can mix and match the colours and stack them together which looks great, yet still unfussy.\n\nShop the entire Tembo Collecton HERE.\n\n#TLCxAuree\n\nMatthew Williamson x USA Pro\n\nThis summer Matthew Williamson released a twenty-piece capsule collection of active and yoga wear with sportswear specialists USA Pro and I attended the collaboration’s launch at the South Kensington Club.\n\nThe distinctive collection of leggings, zip-up jackets and sport's bra tops, combine USA Pro’s in depth technical active wear knowledge, with three of Matthew’s signature vibrant and exotic prints. The results are super stylish, yet practical - perfect for the gym, the mat... and more likely for me, the sofa... \"Doing absolutely nothing in my (*Matthew Williamson) active wear...!\"\n\n“I view active and loungewear as a key component of our expansion into lifestyle in 2016.

Upon returning from New York last week, I attended a summer party thrown by Matthew and the President and Co-Founder of RewardStyle and LIKEtoKNOW.it, Amber Venz Box.\n\nHeld at the heavenly Clifton Nurseries, amidst great music, bongo drums and mahoosive bubbles (yup!) we celebrated Matthew’s high-summer 2016 collection, Mirage.

With the London sunshine fiiiinally playing ball and putting its very own hat on, Jess’ summer styles, from her neon, pom pom adorned straw trilbies to her beyond creative, dramatic headpieces, are ready to take centre stage. Whether you have upcoming weddings, races, regattas or are simply heading to the beach, this Notting Hill Mad Hatter has got your back… or, you know, head!\n\nAs you may remember I organised a competition to find an illustrator to create some backgrounds for some of Jess’ most event-worthy pieces. Thank you to every one for your wonderful submissions, I’m thrilled to announce Parisian illustrator Habile Buston has won a Jess Collett made-to-measure summer trilby worth £220.00 after designing these fabulous and vibrant interpretations of my impending summer fun!\n\nMake Up: Charlotte Cowen\n\nDresses: Matthew Williamson Archive.\n\nPhotographer: Janie Airey\n\nTLC VACATION: Puente Romano Beach Resort and Spa, Marbella\n\nAfter the most depressingly long hibernation, and several bouts of rotten flu, the shiniest of tickets came my way; an invitation to stay at the Puente Romano Beach Resort & Spa on Spain’s Golden Mile, Marbella, where the sun shines for 320 days a year! HOORAY!\n\nGrabbing my friend Charlotte Cowen en route, I arrived at the most luxurious of hotels. Designed to recreate an Andalusian village, the beachfront Puente Romano, with its endless array of restaurants, three swimming pools, Six Senses Spa and newly opened nightclub, La Suite, had everything both our mischievous and holistic desires required.\n\nAbove: Bellagio 4-Wheel 55cm Cabin Suitcase in Panna by BRICS.\n\nOur room was found amongst the white-washed walls and baskets of geraniums of the grounds, and we were thrilled to find we had a gorgeous little balcony (room service locaaay sorted!) and adorable beach baskets and towels as gifts.\n\nWearing: Daisy Mini Crop Set by Mochi.\n\nOh, I should also mention the giant plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries – soooo spoiling!\n\nWearing: Raspberry Mother Amazon Slip Dress and Sunrise Sunglasses by Matthew Williamson.\n\nWearing: Lime Beam Printed Silk Crepe Playsuit by Asceno and Traveller by TOMS sunglasses.\n\nThe heavenly Six Senses Spa offers an array of treatments, and Charlotte and I were generously treated to a hugely relaxing Couple’s Massage (hilarious!) in one of the spa’s nine treatment rooms.\n\nThe blue-tiled swimming pool, with its view of the ocean, has amazing waterfall-style windows, and the spa also features a hydrotherapy pool; a cold plunge pool; heat and ice experience showers with different types of water flow and mood lighting; herbal steam room; sauna and hammam. UTTER heaven, and you can see why people travel the distances they do to unwind and spend time being pampered there.\n\nWearing: Seafolly Coast to Coast Swimsuit from Beach Cafe.\n\nWearing: Anna Kosturova (name to watch!) Dreamcatcher Halterkini from Beach Cafe.\n\nThere is a gym and a tennis court on site, and the resort is also very close to Marbella’s old town, but given that there are nine (yes, nine!) restaurants throughout the resort, it is quite possible to spend your entire stay hopping from one to the other… I can think of worse ways to pass the time! The Sea Grill (above) is right on the beach and where we were treated to an array of fresh seafood and sushi on our first night.\n\nTwo-Michelin-star-holding chef Dani Garcia’s playful concept restaurant Bibo was where we spent most of the next afternoon (I’m not even kidding, we feasted for for what seemed hours – NOT that any of us were complaining!) With an imaginative menu and Alice in Wonderland’esq touches in abundance (even the list of cocktails were presented in the form of Tarot Cards, which I made each of our party choose from - best game ever?! #EveryonesAWinner) the beyond imaginative tasting menu left us defeated, but amazed (I’d fly back merely for another portion of his INSANE New York-inspired cheesecake!)\n\nWearing: Gold Diamond Moon Charm Necklace and Gold Diamond Horseshoe Necklace by Missoma.\n\nMid-way through our amazing meal, Dani surprised us with the most amazing truffle treats in his kitchen...\n\nWe also enjoyed a delicious evening of sushi at UNI, several Turkish Delight smoothies at Rachel’s Organic Cafe (above, also my favourite spot at the hotel for sun bathing and reading) and a very healthy lunch at Celicioso, Marbella’s only 100% gluten-free restaurant (below).\n\nEnjoying the sunset with Charlotte and our friend, the Fashion Director of Marie-Claire, Tanya Philipson. The last time I was in Marbella was actually for Tanya's wedding, so it was great to see her, and this time with her gorgeous new son Archer! Would you just look at those CHEEKS!! Beyond edible.\n\nWearing: Dia White 70's Maxi Dress by Lily and Lionel.\n\nYou also might not expect to find Marbella’s hottest new club amongst the sub-tropical gardens of Puente Romano, but this hotel is full of surprises as well as palm trees. La Suite held its glamorous launch party on our last night, and launch it we certainly did…! With a mixture of old Roman architecture and ultra-modern touches, the club is the perfect addition to the resort and will no doubt, be well frequented by guests and local revellers alike.\n\nThe next morning Charlotte and I were treated to breakfast (pancakes, naturally) on our balcony (I mean, this entire stay was such a romantic friend-moon!) and coconut water and lavender scented eye masks were brought to us to assist with our much needed R&R… I mean, next level thoughtful!"
