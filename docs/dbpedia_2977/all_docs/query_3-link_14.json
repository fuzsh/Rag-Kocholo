McDonough was a two-time NCAA champion in 2010 and 2012 at 125 pounds. He also won back-to-back Big Ten titles as a sophomore and junior. He was also a member of the Iowa National Championship team in 2010.\n\nIn international competition, he earned a university world bronze medal for Team USA in Hungary.\n\nHe was a National Team member in 2014 at 57kg as well as a University World Bronze Medalist in 2014.\n\nMcDonough excelled off the mat as an Academic All-American for the Hawkeyes. He graduated from the University of Iowa with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Health and Human Physiology in 2013.\n\nHe resides in Madison with his wife Cori, daughter Everly and son Logan.\n\nBono on McDonough:\n\n\"When I first got the job at SDSU, I tried to hire him six years ago when he was fresh out of college and winning national championships at Iowa,\" Bono said of McDonough. \"It's the mentality of the work ethic and how he's thinking. We're on the same page for how we should train athletes and how the recruiting goes.\n\n\"Everything about Matt is what I think about in a wrestling program, so it was a no-brainer to go after him. He comes very highly recommended by a lot of people and I'm excited to get him here.\""
