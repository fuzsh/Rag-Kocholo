        "text": "Re: Welcome Matthew McDonough at pick 42\n\nSmoking Aces said:\n\nMatt McDonough\n\nPlayed a really solid game, starting forward and then moving into the midfield. Had 25 touches and used the ball extremely well. Stoppage and contested work again were features of his performance.\n\nHas produced this sort of form the last few weeks. Surely a call up to the team is near at the expense of at least Nahas.\n\nIt's interesting.\n\nMcDonough is doing as much or more than Nahas before call up.\n\nHelbig, Arnot are doing as much or more than Lonergan before call up to seniors.\n\nDimma seems to be playing it a bit too safe perhaps worried about consequences if we don't make finals. Would rather he bloods these kids over the more deficient senior equivalents.\n\nRe: Welcome Matthew McDonough at pick 42\n\nBarnzy said:\n\nIt's interesting.\n\nMcDonough is doing as much or more than Nahas before call up.\n\nHelbig, Arnot are doing as much or more than Lonergan before call up to seniors.\n\nDimma seems to be playing it a bit too safe perhaps worried about consequences if we don't make finals. Would rather he bloods these kids over the more deficient senior equivalents.\n\nThis. Helbig and Arnot were way ahead of Lonergan. Dimma is digging a grave. McDonough is playing good footy. And then people wonder why FJ doesn't pick any good 2nd/3rd rounders. It's because they rot at Coburg and don't develop.\n\nRe: Welcome Matthew McDonough at pick 42\n\ntigs2010 said:\n\nThis.

It should come with a health warning to any player who puts on that jumper.\n\nRe: Welcome Matthew McDonough at pick 42\n\nBarnzy said:\n\nIt's interesting.\n\nMcDonough is doing as much or more than Nahas before call up.\n\nHelbig, Arnot are doing as much or more than Lonergan before call up to seniors.\n\nDimma seems to be playing it a bit too safe perhaps worried about consequences if we don't make finals. Would rather he bloods these kids over the more deficient senior equivalents.\n\nNahas consistently plays well for Coburg, kicked 4 a couple of weeks ago something McDonough hasn't done yet . I am all for him coming in this week but his form was not better than Nahas at Coburg. The reason to play him is that he a 19 year old kid with promise and Nahas has had enough chances but it's not because he had better form at Coburg, nahas was actually picked on form.\n\nLonergan was picked with a specific role in mind which failed badly. Helbig and Arnot have not been better than Lonergan at Coburg either but should be pushed forward for the same reason as McDonough. Helbig for Lonergan would be a good selection this week.\n\nI am all for giving kids a chance but I don't agree that their selection was warranted on form ahead of others.\n\nRe: Welcome Matthew McDonough at pick 42\n\nSintiger said:\n\nNahas consistently plays well for Coburg, kicked 4 a couple of weeks ago something McDonough hasn't done yet .

He's had a 3 goal bag in a team that got flogged. His work rate and contested work is far and away ahead of Nahas. Nahas took the spot of a midfielder so swap him out for McDonough who has been better in the middle.\n\nCan you tell me how Lonergan has been better than Arnot/Helbig? Lonergan had 6 effective possessions out of 20 before being promoted. Helbig regularly hits targets."
