        "text": "the minnesota review is a journal featuring creative and critical work from writers on the rise or already established. We accept and review creative work from August 15 to October 15 and from January 15 to March 15. We review critical submissions year-round.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the minnesota review is not based in Minnesota. The journal was founded in 1960 in Minnesota and was stationed there for about 10 years before moving to various locations across the country.\n\nWe are currently based at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, and are published by Duke University Press."
