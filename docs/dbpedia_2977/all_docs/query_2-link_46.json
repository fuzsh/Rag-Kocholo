        "text": "Matthew McConaughey's relationship with his wife, Camila Alves, is more than just \"alright, alright, alright.\"\n\n\"We have a love that we never question,\" the Oscar winner told PEOPLE of his bond with Alves, who is a model, entrepreneur and philanthropist.\n\nBut before meeting Alves in 2006, McConaughey wasn't sure he would ever find the \"unconditional love\" they now share. The actor felt like he was running out of time to find the love of his life and start a family.\n\n\"I mean, the clock was ticking — I was about to be 40 and my plan was to be married and have kids by that age,\" McConaughey recalled in 2018. \"But I didn't want to play the game of starting to feel anxious because, with too much anxiety, you can't find a mate. And then you make a hasty decision.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I knew men who had made hasty decisions and women who had done the same thing. But at that point, I wasn't hunting. And then this amazing woman walked across my field of vision and I thought, 'Who is that?' And it was Camila.\"\n\nFrom meeting in a Los Angeles nightclub to welcoming three children, here is everything to know about Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves' relationship.\n\n2006: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves meet at an L.A. club\n\nMcConaughey first laid eyes on Alves at the West Hollywood nightclub Hyde in 2006 — and the connection was instant.\n\n\"She showed up, and she moved right to left in front of my eyes across that club,\" the actor told PEOPLE of their first meeting. \"It was as if she was floating. And I did not say, 'Who is that?' I said, 'What is that?' And then introduced myself. Since that evening, I have not wanted to spend time with any other woman.\"\n\nAlves, though, remembered their initial meeting going differently. \"We had two interactions at the bar,\" she recalled. \"The first interaction, I did not know who he was … He was all covered up and I didn't really realize who he was.\"\n\nLance Armstrong — who was with McConaughey at the club that evening — helped clear things up. Three nights later, McConaughey and Alves had their first official date.\n\nOctober 2007: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves' relationship is confirmed\n\nNearly a year after the pair first met, PEOPLE confirmed their romance in its October 2007 cover story. Since their first encounter in the nightclub, Alves had been by McConaughey's side — following him to Australia, where he filmed Fool's Gold, and to the Bahamas, where he shot the comedy Surfer, Dude.\n\n\"She likes roughing it,\" a source said. \"She doesn't complain when they go hiking for 10 days without clean clothes or a shower.\"\n\nJanuary 30, 2008: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves make their red carpet debut at the Fool's Gold premiere\n\nMcConaughey and a pregnant Alves hit the red carpet together for the first time at the L.A. premiere of Fool's Gold.\n\nAlves later reminisced about the evening in an Instagram post. \"I was so nervous, we had already been dating for a while and I had been to movie premieres with him but always sneaking in thru the back to keep our privacy,\" she wrote. \"This was the first time going 'here we go' the minute I stepped into the carpet the WIND picked up like crazy and this flowing knee length dress pretty quickly became crotch high!\"\n\nShe added, \"I laugh the whole way because if you can't fix it may as well laugh right!!\"\n\nJuly 7, 2008: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves welcome their first baby\n\nAfter three days of labor and an emergency cesarean section, McConaughey and Alves welcomed their first son, Levi Alves McConaughey, on July 7, 2008.\n\n\"A healthy baby boy was born,\" McConaughey said in a statement. \"Camila and I were side-by-side the entire time. We are both tired and elated, and are so happy to have created the greatest miracle in the world — having a child and making a family. Now comes the greatest adventure — raising one, together.\"\n\nAlves shared more of her birth story years later in the Ellen DeGeneres Show segment \"Lady Parts\" with Sarah Hyland. \"We tried to go as natural as we could in a hospital setting,\" Alves said. \"We really wanted to go through without taking [medication]. We wanted to have that experience, and that was what we planned on.\"\n\nBut after trying to push Levi out unsuccessfully, \"the doctor was like, 'That's it — emergency C-section.' \"\n\nAugust 7, 2008: Matthew McConaughey supports Camila Alves at the launch of her handbag line\n\nMcConaughey, Alves and 1-month-old baby Levi enjoyed a family night out at the launch party for Muxo, a luxury handbag collection designed by Alves and her mother. Levi spent the evening in a private room with his nanny, while McConaughey applauded his wife's new venture.\n\n\"Camila and her mom have been working on putting [Muxo] together for years, and then all of a sudden it's like ka-boom,\" McConaughey told PEOPLE. \"It's great. Tonight's just about celebrating.\"\n\nJune 21, 2009: Matthew McConaughey reveals Camila Alves is pregnant\n\nMcConaughey revealed on Father's Day that the couple were expecting their second child.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day. It's my first, and the last 11 months with Levi and Camila have been the most rewarding adventure to date,\" McConaughey wrote on his website. \"We have more blessed news to celebrate this Father's Day that makes this time next year double the fun. Levi is going to be a big brother … Yeah, we pulled off the greatest miracle in the world one more time.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Camila and I are expecting our second child, bringing more life into the world, making more to live for. The future looks bright as the family grows and we thank you for all the well wishes you send our way. Viva la evolucion, naturally, and in the mean times and all time, just keep livin, Matthew and Camila.\"\n\nJanuary 3, 2010: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves welcome their second baby\n\nMcConaughey and Alves welcomed daughter Vida Alves McConaughey just after midnight on Jan. 3, 2010, weighing in at 7 pounds, 7 ounces.\n\nThe couple chose not to find out the sex prior to delivery, as they did with Levi. \"'Vida' is Portuguese for 'life' and that's what God gave us this morning,\" McConaughey said of her name.\n\n\"Camila's recovering wonderfully and we are both truly honored to welcome this little lady into our family,\" he added. \"Thanks for all of your well wishes and prayers along the way, another blessed day, we give thanks.\"\n\nOne month later, Alves opened up to PEOPLE about her daughter. \"I'm very excited to have a girl,\" Alves said. \"I'm happy and it's a big blessing. Vida's definitely a beautiful and peaceful girl. We are so lucky!\"\n\nDecember 25, 2011: Matthew McConaughey proposes to Camila Alves\n\nMcConaughey made Christmas Day extra merry when he got down on one knee and proposed to his love of nearly five years.\n\n\"Just asked Camila to marry me,\" the actor announced. \"Merry Christmas!\"\n\nMcConaughey shared more details of the romantic proposal with PEOPLE. The actor proposed with a rose-cut Cathy Waterman engagement ring that he hid within boxes of varying sizes, so Alves wouldn't suspect anything.\n\n\"It was the last gift to be opened and I wrapped it in seven different boxes so Camila would have to keep unwrapping,\" McConaughey said. \"She got the ring, I took a knee and asked her to marry me and take my name. After a bit, she conceded … thankfully.\"\n\nJune 9, 2012: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves get married\n\nAfter a six-month engagement and six years together, McConaughey and Alves tied the knot in a three-day celebration held at their home in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe sunset ceremony was held in front of 120 guests, including Reese Witherspoon, Kenny Chesney and Woody Harrelson. McConaughey looked like an \"old Hollywood movie star\" in a Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo, while Alves — who officially took her groom's last name — was \"glowing and beautiful\" in Stuart Weitzman heels and a custom gown by her favorite Brazilian designer, Ducarmo Castelo Branco.\n\nThe couple's children, Levi and Vida, served as ring bearer and flower girl for the special day. \"[They] seem to understand what we are doing on a spiritual level,\" Alves told PEOPLE.\n\n\"We decided to embrace the ritual of marriage as an opportunity and adventure we'll take together,\" McConaughey added.\n\nJuly 4, 2012: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves announce third pregnancy\n\nJust one month after marrying, McConaughey and Alves announced that their family would be growing once more: Alves was pregnant with the couple's third baby.\n\n\"Happy birthday America, more good news, Camila and I are expecting our 3rd child,\" McConaughey tweeted. \"God bless, just keep livin.\"\n\nJuly 2012: Camila Alves supports Matthew McConaughey as he loses weight for Dallas Buyers Club\n\nAt a party celebrating Alves as the face of a Macy's campaign, McConaughey debuted his dramatic weight loss for his upcoming role in Dallas Buyers Club.\n\n\"He's losing weight for his new movie and he still has to lose more,\" Alves said on the red carpet. \"But I'm very supportive. I'm usually the one right there saying, 'You can't eat this, you can't eat that,' but he's very disciplined. He's really great at it.\"\n\nDecember 28, 2012: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves welcome their third baby\n\nChristmas week was extra special for the McConaughey clan: The couple welcomed a baby boy, Livingston Alves McConaughey, on Dec. 28, 2012. Livingston joined big brother Levi and big sister Vida, who was days away from her third birthday.\n\n\"Camila gave birth to our third child yesterday morning. Our son, Livingston Alves McConaughey was born at 7:43 a.m. on 12.28.12. He greeted the world at 9lbs. and 21 inches,\" McConaughey tweeted, according to CBS News. \"Bless up and thank you for your well wishes.

In his moving acceptance speech, the actor said he wants to make his family proud.\n\n\"To my wife, Camila, and my kids Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone: the courage and significance you give me every day when I go out the door is unparalleled,\" McConaughey said. \"You are the four people in my life I want to make the most proud of me.\"\n\nThe actor concluded his speech with his trademark quip: \"Whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasing, to that I say, 'All right, all right, all right.' To that I say, 'Just keep living.' \"\n\nNovember 17, 2014: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves attend Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony\n\nMcConaughey's biggest supporters were present to reveal his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Alves and the couple's three children were all in attendance for the actor's big day.\n\n\"It's a family affair today…the stars are aligned!!\" Alves tweeted prior to the event.\n\nMcConaughey previously shared how much he appreciated Alves' willingness to take their family wherever his career led him.\n\n\"When I go to work, she says, 'All right, kiddos, we're all going.' No discussion. She has things she does in her own life that she's willing to drop, put in second place,\" he said. \"[She says,] 'You're the primary breadwinner … We're going with you. This is your career. We're going.' That's a huge privilege.\"\n\nAugust 4, 2015: Matthew McConaughey congratulates Camila Alves on becoming a U.S. citizen\n\nMcConaughey and his three children posed for a family picture alongside Alves as she received her U.S. citizenship.\n\n\"Congratulations Camila on getting your U.S. citizenship today – another fellow and great American,\" McConaughey wrote alongside the photo, which he posted to Facebook.\n\nAlves, who moved to the U.S. from Brazil as a teen, shared in her husband's excitement on Twitter.\n\n\"Happy to say I now hold an American passport!

The model and handbag designer shared that everyone in her family, from her husband to her three children, helped get the company off the ground.\n\n\"All of our kids were right there helping choose every single flavor, testing, telling us what they did and didn't like,\" Alves said. \"We were all working together.\"\n\nIn addition to her tiny taste testers, Alves shared that McConaughey also helped over the two years it took to get the company up and running.\n\n\"I couldn't have done it if I didn't have his support because I had to work very long hours seven days a week,\" Alves said of her husband. \"If my family wasn't there to be able to hold the ball when I wasn't there and be able to really support me, then I couldn't have done it.\"\n\nNovember 2016: Matthew McConaughey reveals Camila Alves encouraged him to ditch rom-coms\n\nIn an interview with Esquire, McConaughey opened up about changing the course of his acting career, leaving behind his leading roles in romantic comedies for more serious films. The actor credited the risky shift in part to Alves.\n\nAfter starring in films like The Wedding Planner and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, McConaughey realized he had reached a tipping point. \"All of a sudden. I understood, whoa, that's become my brand,\" the actor recalled.\n\nIt was then he made the decision to \"unbrand\" with Alves' support — even turning down $14.5 million for another rom-com in 2010.\n\n\"A good woman gives a man courage and confidence — the courage to have the confidence to go and do it, to not be worried as much or consider as much what the rest of the world thinks,\" he said.\n\nOctober 2017: Camila Alves shares how she and Matthew McConaughey keep the spark in their marriage\n\nIn an interview with Ocean Drive, Alves opened up about how she and McConaughey kept their five-year marriage feeling fresh. Despite having three kids and busy careers, the couple always make time for date night — even if it is just a quick night away.\n\n\"Sometimes it's just a staycation, taking one night at a hotel that's 15 minutes away from your house,\" she said. \"But you pack a backpack. You go to dinner. You get to have talks and sleep in the next day. Walk around, have breakfast and lunch together.\"\n\nAugust 23, 2019: Matthew McConaughey invests in a soccer team, inspired by Camila Alves\n\nMcConaughey became a part owner of Major League Soccer team Austin FC — a decision largely influenced by his wife's passion for the sport, the actor later revealed.\n\n\"I played a little bit of soccer as a youngster but soccer was not my game,\" McConaughey told Entertainment Tonight ahead of the team's debut in 2021. \"But then I marry this woman and she is from Brazil. If you are going to marry a Brazilian woman, soccer is not something you talk about, soccer is something in your blood.\"\n\nHe continued, \"So my kids pick it up, so I pick it up … It became important to me that way. And then a friend opened up an opportunity for me to come on as a co-owner with them and I said yes.\"\n\nAlves also shared her excitement about the team before their first game. \"I grew up playing soccer, I was a goalie believe it or not!\" she wrote on Instagram. \"SOCCER is in our blood in Brasil and now to see our family being part of a team honestly is beyond words!\"\n\nApril 2020: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves deliver masks to frontline workers during COVID-19 pandemic\n\nMcConaughey and Alves personally delivered masks to frontline workers in Austin and New Orleans during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. Along with their three children, the couple — working with Bethenny Frankel's BStrong initiative — dropped off around 80,000 surgical and KN95 masks to hospital workers, fire stations and police stations.\n\n\"I think that finding a purpose of helping also helps people get through this time,\" Alves told PEOPLE. \"If you have the ability to donate, you can still make a difference and go to BStrong and help there. If you don't have the means of donating dollars, but if you have the means of donating your time or volunteering or calling people, that's okay too … It's finding ways that we can all help each other.\"\n\nMcConaughey and Alves continued to give back throughout the pandemic. The pair hosted a virtual bingo night for a senior living home, whose residents had to self-isolate in the living facility, and donated 110,000 masks to hospitals across rural Texas.\n\nJanuary 17, 2021: Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves adopt two puppies\n\nThe McConaughey crew grew by two four-legged friends in January 2021: Alves shared that they adopted two puppies from the Humane Society within two days of each other.\n\n\"If you thought...what was I thinking with a 4 month old puppy...well how about with another one that's 2 months old!!\" Alves wrote alongside a selfie with one of the pups.\n\n\"Yep, got work cut out for me in the next months!\" she added. \"3 kids, 2 older dogs, 2 pups, 1 cat and my mother in law😉.\"\n\nMcConaughey previously shared how the couple still manages to find alone time.\n\n\"We're getting a little bit better at creating some structure,\" he said. \"Not only for the kids but for us and saying, 'Hey, from this time to this time don't come knocking on the door. We're gonna have our time.' \"\n\nNovember 2021: Matthew McConaughey named philanthropist of the year for his and Camila Alves' foundation\n\nMcConaughey was honored as philanthropist of the year by the Hollywood Reporter for his work with his and Alves' Just Keep Livin' Foundation. The couple founded the organization in 2008 with the mission to help low-income high school students lead more active lives and make healthy choices. In March 2021, the foundation raised $7.7 million for victims of Texas' winter storm Uri.\n\nFor McConaughey and Alves, the foundation is a top priority — and a family affair. \"Me and Camila wanted to be in this thing. I was always going to be hands-on,\" he told THR. \"It's always a forethought, never an afterthought. I want this to be a legacy.\"\n\nHe added, \"My family understands because we usually do it together, and more and more we're incorporating our children and saying, 'Hey, don't just watch what Mom and Dad are doing from the outside, get your butt in the ring, we need you to handle this.' \"\n\nDecember 13, 2021: Matthew McConaughey, Camila Alves and their three children attend Sing 2 premiere\n\nThe whole McConaughey family stepped out for a rare red carpet appearance at the Sing 2 premiere.
