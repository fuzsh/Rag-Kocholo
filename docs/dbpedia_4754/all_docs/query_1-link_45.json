        "text": "OPEN THE DOOR, RICHARD\n\nBy Marv Goldberg\n\n© 2016 by Marv Goldberg\n\n[NOTE: The song title is usually spelled \"Open The Door, Richard\", but it could also be \"Open The Door Richard\" or \"Open The Door, Richard!\". I'll try to spell it the way it is on the label when talking about a specific record. It'll be \"Open The Door, Richard\" when it's just the general title. Record information (label and number) will be found in the discography section.]\n\n[I NEED YOUR HELP - I've attempted to hear and to visually document all the versions of \"Open The Door, Richard\" that I could find. However, there are several labels that I don't have scans of, several musicians and singers that I couldn't find photos of, and several versions that I've never heard. A list of these appears at the very end of the article, after the discography. Hope some of you can provide them.]\n\nA PHENOMENON\n\n\"Open The Door Richard\" was a true phenomenon. It's had a long journey and I'll be documenting the first 25 years of recordings, as well as its history prior to those. Amazingly, artists are still recording the song 70 years later and the phrase \"open the door, Richard\" is still understood (or at least used) by millions.\n\nThe chorus goes like this:\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nOpen the door and let me in\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nRichard, why don't you open that door?\n\nWith the staccato \"open the door\" (which mimics someone knocking furiously), a catchphrase was born. (Note that I'll constantly be referring to that chorus as the \"Vocal Refrain\" and \"Open the door, Richard\" as the \"catchphrase\".)\n\nI have to be honest, I don't remember a single version of \"Open The Door, Richard\" from 1947. I'm sure I heard them on the radio, but I was kind of young at the time. My first memory of the song is hearing my Aunt Jennie singing the \"open the door, Richard\" line around the house. In fact, that line was heard on countless comedy programs for years. It was also featured in political cartoons, unrelated advertisements, and even an announcement for a Sunday church sermon. And, because Warner Brothers cartoons were always looking for popular culture icons to demolish, Richard made it to two of them. The first was \"Crowing Pains\", released in July 1947. In it, Foghorn Leghorn has just stuffed Henery Hawk into a phony egg. When Henery starts stumbling around, unable to see, Foghorn tells him: \"Open the window, Richard, that's what it's there for.\" Then there was \"High Diving Hare\", a 1949 Bugs Bunny film. (This was two years after things had seemingly quieted down.) Yosemite Sam pounds and demands that Bugs \"open up that door!\" before turning to the audience and saying: \"You'll notice, I didn't say 'Richard'.\"\n\nAnd, a year before any of the recordings appeared, here's an ad for the grand opening of Detroit's Club Three Sixes (sometimes also billed as Club Three 666). And no, I have no idea who \"Sneed\" was.\n\nIn fiction, Richard himself is what's termed a \"McGuffin\", a motivator (object, person, or idea) that drives the plot without being terribly important in itself (think of the statue in \"The Maltese Falcon\"). At the beginning of the craze, we didn't see Richard, we knew nothing about him (other than he wouldn't get up), and it didn't matter. (Of course, that would change as singers began to run out of ideas about dealing with an unseen person.)\n\nThe craze began in the early days of 1947, but the catchphrase had been around for a long while before that and had already embedded itself in the vocabulary by the early 1940s (we'll see why in a bit).\n\nWHAT'S A CATCHPHRASE?\n\nAlmost everyone uses jargon to some extent. It's a set of words and phrases unique to a specific group of people (accountants, policemen, programmers, card players, auto mechanics, etc.). Jargon is exclusionary; that is, using these words and phrases marks you as a member of the group, to the exclusion of all others (who probably don't know what you're talking about).\n\nA catchphrase, on the other hand is inclusionary. It's a word or phrase that everyone seems to understand and, by using it, people feel that they're \"with it\" and fit in with mainstream society (of course, the phrases will differ from country to country). American examples are:\n\n23-Skiddoo\n\nWhat's up, Doc?\n\nSock it to me\n\nD'oh\n\nHere's looking at you, kid\n\nMr. Dillion, Mr. Dillon\n\nNanu-Nanu\n\nGo ahead, make my day\n\nI'll be back (but only if said with an Austrian accent)\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nWhereas jargon requires you to be part of a group, catchphrases are spread by mass media: books, newspapers, radio, movies, television, and, nowadays, the Internet. They have currency for some period and then are used less and less (but usually never completely fade from the culture).\n\nRICHARD'S BIRTH\n\nWhere did Richard come from? For the beginning of the answer, we have to get ahead of ourselves for a while and look at a 1948 deposition given by John Mason when he was suing Duchess Music (publisher of \"Open The Door Richard\") for an accounting of royalties. (Yes, boys and girls, it will all boil down to money, as most things do.) In 1930, John Mason was in a musical called \"Brown Buddies\" (with Ada Brown, Bill Robinson, Adelaide Hall, and Red & Struggy). In it, he played a character called \"Spider Bruce\", a nickname he'd use for the rest of his career. Here's a summary of his deposition:\n\nMason had been an actor and comedian since 1910 (he said); in addition, he wrote sketches for himself and others. In 1918, he wrote a sketch called \"Open The Door, Richard\" that depicted a drunk trying to hustle free drinks at a bar until being thrown out by the bartender. He staggers home, but finds that his roommate, Richard, has the only key. Knocking and pounding on the door produces no result, so he finds a ladder and tries to climb in a window. His climb is halted by a passing policeman, which results in some comic banter. Mason claimed that the skit, with straight man Richard Perry, was first presented in a show called \"Dixie Beach Girls\" in 1919.\n\n[\"Dixie Beach Girls\", which Mason owned, toured for several years. I can find mentions of it in the March 19, 1921 Billboard, as well as newspapers from Dallas in 1922 and Louisville in 1926. No review, however, mentioned a skit about a drunk (or, to be fair, any other specific skit). An April 29, 1922 Billboard review mentioned Richard Perry as Mason's straight man and even talked about the sketches, but there was nothing about a drunk. They called it \"... clean, classy, well costumed and snappy\" (in other words, no drunk act). I have to point out, though, that \"Dixie Beach Girls\" was the name of Mason's stock company and had segments that changed over the years.]\n\nRichard Perry (the eponymous \"Richard\") was replaced by Douglas \"Slim\" Henderson for a couple of years, and then by Clinton \"Dusty\" Fletcher. [The February 9, 1929 Philadelphia Inquirer reviewed a musical called \"The Jazz Regiment\" and had this to say: \"... Fletcher and Mason offer a drunk scene on the swaying deck of a yacht tumbling and rolling to their own mild comments on the potency of the 'likker'.\"] Later on, after Mason and Fletcher had split up, Dusty Fletcher continued to use the \"Open The Door, Richard\" routine. At some point, bandleader Jack McVea saw the skit and added some music to it.\n\nMcVea subsequently recorded the song/routine and it became a hit. However, the writer credit only went to Jack McVea and his bassist, Frank Clarke [Mason claimed not to know who Clarke was]. When Dusty Fletcher then recorded the song, his was the only name in the writer credits.\n\nIn mid-January 1947, Mason contacted Duchess Music, the publisher of the song, and convinced them that he had originated the skit. From then on, his name (along with McVea's and Fletcher's and Clarke's) was a part of the credits. [Clarke's name would soon disappear in favor of Dan Howell's. We'll get to him in a bit.]\n\nThere was a nice article about John Mason's career in the January 27, 1940 Afro-American, but it never mentioned \"Richard\" at all. The week of March 7, 1947, Mason appeared at the Apollo Theater (which he did on a regular basis, mostly as \"Spider Bruce\"). However, this time, the billing read: \"John Mason in his original skit 'Open The Door Richard'.\"\n\nThat's the bare bones of the Richard saga, according to Mason. However, Mason \"forgot\" to mention that he probably got a lot of the routine from Bob Russell, an earlier black performer whose career had started around the time of the Civil War and continued into the 1920s. (But, since Russell had died in August 1925, there was no need to confuse the matter further.) For an article in the February 15, 1947 Afro-American, Mason told a reporter the origin of some of the gags (and you know how cynical I am about these things): \"It actually happened to me,\" Mason said. \"If my partner and me had two suits and his was the good one, I'd wear his and he'd stay home while I attended to business.\" [If that doesn't make much sense to you yet, it will in a bit.]\n\nIn the 1930s and early 40s, Mason's comedy act usually included Johnny Vigal and Edna \"Yak\" Taylor, but \"Richard\" is never mentioned. What's really surprising to me is that, after securing part of the rights to the piece, Mason never recorded it himself. One of several black blackface comedians, Mason continued to perform until his death in 1952.\n\nNow we turn to Mason's former partner, Clinton \"Dusty\" Fletcher. (Supposedly he picked up his nickname when he played a porter in 1925's \"Charleston Revue\".) There are many mentions of Dusty Fletcher performing the routine. Sadly, one of those mentions wasn't in the blurb about the opening of the Apollo Theater on January 26, 1934. (The Apollo had been a white burlesque house, but that night it switched over to \"all-colored productions\".) On the stage for the opening, along with Dusty, were Aida Ward, Mabel Scott, the 3 Rhythm Kings, the 3 Farmer Boys [they meant the 3 Palmer Brothers; the ad got it right; the write-up got it wrong], Norton & Margot, Ralph Cooper's band, Bennie Carter's orchestra, and Troy Brown. (Strangely, although Dusty's name was mentioned in the accompanying write-up, his was the only name missing from the Apollo's ad itself.) In spite of this, there's every reason to believe that Apollo audiences saw Dusty do the \"Richard\" routine that night. I'd like to think that it must have gone over big, because he was held over for the next week's show. However, the February 3, 1934 New York Age panned his performance, saying that he (and Troy Brown) will \"soon be back numbers if they don't give their public new gags and comedy....\" From that, I have to conclude that if he did the Richard skit, it was already considered an old, familiar routine.\n\nIt looks like Fletcher and Mason reunited for a while. The July 27, 1934 show at the Apollo advertised \"Dusty Fletcher and John Mason\", linking their names together (but notice whose name is now first). The August 4 New York Age noted that headliner Tiny Bradshaw, as well as Dusty Fletcher and John Mason, had been held over. (Also on that show was a new group, the 4 Ink Spots. Wonder whatever happened to them.) Fletcher and Mason did so well that they were held over, week after week, through August 30. However, not everyone was pleased. Theater critic Vere E. Johns had this to say in the September 1, 1934 New York Age:\n\nDusty Fletcher and John Mason should take a vacation, they seem so tired they can't even put over stale gags anymore. Go down to Belmar, N.J. boys, and sit by the lake and try to think up some new and funny jokes. Or better still, don't go - give the money to someone here who will write some for you. No, I don't want it, my jokes can't be smeared with burnt cork. [He's telling us that Fletcher and Mason were still appearing in blackface and he wasn't happy about it.]\n\nAn article about Dusty in the December 19, 1936 Pittsburgh Courier talked about how good he was and how funny his sketches were, but didn't mention the theme of any of them.\n\nIn a blurb in the December 28, 1939 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Dusty Fletcher is called the \"originator of the comedy scene, 'Open That Door Richard'.\" A January 2, 1940 article in the Pittsburgh Press said that Fletcher had performed \"Open That Door, Richard\" as far back as 1930, when he (and it) were in the 1930 edition of Lew Leslie's \"Blackbirds\" (along with Ethel Waters, Mantan Moreland, Jimmy Baskette, the Berry Brothers, and Eubie Blake). However, I've looked through the entire program for that show when it played the Royale Theater in New York and he was never separately named, nor was there any routine that could have been \"Richard\". His name appears in the show's program when it transferred to the Chestnut Street Opera House (Philadelphia) in January 1931, but I can't see the skit listings in that one. Actually, since the February 21, 1931 New York Age said (talking about the new \"Lucky To Me\" revue at the Lafayette Theater): \"This cast includes .... Dusty Fletcher (who succeeded Flournoy Miller as the main comedian of Lew Leslie's Blackbirds)....\", it's possible that he did the routine in Philadelphia, but wasn't even in the in New York production.\n\nSeveral 1940 ads for Pittsburgh's Casino Theater mention Dusty Fletcher and \"Open That Door Richard\" appearing in different revues: \"Black And White Revue\" (January 1940), \"Boogie Woogie\" (May 1940), and the \"Hit Waves Of 1941\" (November 1940). The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette of November 26 said: \"... Dusty Fletcher, well-known colored comedian whose 'Open That Door, Richard' sketch has been a favorite at the Diamond Street house [the Casino] for several seasons.\"\n\nFletcher's name appears in conjunction with the routine through 1943. The Pittsburgh Courier of February 3, 1945 says, \"Mirthful Dusty Fletcher, comedian deluxe, using a ladder for a prop, gave a side-splitting performance.\" It doesn't specifically mention Richard, but a ladder was one of the gags in the Richard routine. The New York Age of June 15, 1946 talks about his drunk act when he played Harlem's Club Baron (with Ethel Waters), again without mentioning the name of the skit. But the Pittsburgh Courier of October 5, 1946 had this to say about a show at the Club Zanzibar in New York: \"It was a tough audience, though, 'cause even Dusty Fletcher couldn't get more than a snicker here and there, which may or may not mean that 'Richard' had better open that door and let Dusty find a new act.\" [Sorry, guys, wasn't gonna happen.] The Pittsburgh Courier finished out the year with this (in the December 21, 1946 edition): \"Dusty Fletcher, who flopped all over the Z-bar floor when he first opened there, is so sensational now, Joe Howard is just about ready to give him a lease on the place.\" Subtract the hype and we know his act is, once again, doing better, after only a couple of months. Why? You'll see in a short while.\n\nTHE FILM\n\nFortunately, Dusty Fletcher made a film of the Richard routine for All American News in January 1947, so we can get an appreciation of what theater audiences saw. (There's no music, it's just his straight comedy routine.) The scene is a small, bare stage with an \"audience\" sitting around it at tables. Here's the gist of it, with some lines that found their way into subsequent recordings (interestingly, there's no mention of a key):\n\nA bartender throws a drunken Dusty out into the street. He'd been trying (and obviously succeeding) to hustle free drinks all night. (The bartender was probably played by Dusty's straight man at the time, Fred Winn.) Dusty is wearing long clown shoes, a beat-up swallow-tail coat, and a top hat that's seen better days.\n\nDusty mumbles (while lying on the ground) \"Ain't no use in me buyin' when everyone else is buyin'. I'm gonna keep on drinkin' to everyone's health until I ruin my own.\"\n\nDusty is mad enough to go back inside and break up the bar, but he finds that it won't be that easy. \"I'll go back in there. [tries to stand up; falls down] Well, I ain't going back today, but I'm gonna try and make it tomorrow.\"\n\n[lying on the ground] \"I'm goin' on home and try to get me some sleep.\" [This is where the familiar routine really starts.] \"I got to get off the street 'cause I don't want my pastor to see me like this. You have to be so careful these days 'cause people is so quick to scandalize your name. And I don't think my name would stand any more scandalizin'.\"\n\n[trying to stand] \"So I'm gonna get on in the house and get me some sleep.\" [he stands; he falls] \"I know I ain't drunk. The whiskey is heavy, that's all.\"\n\n\"Gettin' drunk makes you act so common. And I know I ain't common 'cause I got some class I ain't never used yet.\"\n\n[stands; teeters; sits down] \"It ain't no use.\" [realizing he'll never be able to stand up, he crawls to the \"door\" of his house, which is the side panel of the stage] \"Yes, I'll get in the house here and wake up everybody so I can go to sleep.\"\n\n[Gets to his knees and starts knocking] \"Open the door, Richard\" [said in a reasonable speaking voice] \"That's the boy I rooms with. Now what's the matter with him. [knocks louder; speaks louder] Hey, open that door, Richard. Now I know he ain't gone out nowhere, 'cause I got on the clothes. [pounds and yells] Hey, open the door, Richard.\"\n\n\"That's why I don't like to room with nobody. He don't wanna open the door for me. And I owe just as much rent up there as he do. I think I'm gonna move next Saturday cause this old woman she charges too much rent anyhow. [mumbles] Three dollars a month. An' got the nerve to be mad 'cause we're 'leven months in arrears. Why, she come askin' me this mornin', she said 'When you boys gwine give me some of my back rent?' I jes tol' her she'd be lucky if she got any front rent outta me. [yells] Aw, why don't you open the door, Richard?\"\n\n\"Man, she come askin' me when I'se gwine to work and I ain't thinkin' 'bout no work. I don't want no job. I'm goin' back on relief Monday. I was on relief last summer, but I don't know ... they got short of help and they couldn't send the checks out and you hadda go get 'em and all that, so I put it down. [yells] What'cha gonna do 'bout the door, Richard? I don't think he's gonna do nothin'.\"\n\n\"But I'll get in. So I'll go around through the back and come around through the alley. I don't need no Richard to open no door. I just didn't wanta be walkin' in no dark alleys this time of night. [crawls to center stage; gets up; falls down] Now you know I ain't never drank no whiskey before that won't let you go nowhere.\"\n\n[the bartender reappears carrying a painter's ladder that's about seven feet long; Dusty is still lying on the ground] \"Now here's another thing, you keep this ladder out of that bar. And you stay out too.\" The bartender then asks, \"What did you do with the paint I had in that bottle?\" \"Paint? Was there paint in that bottle? You put paint in a whiskey bottle and set it in front of ME? Well then, get me some paint remover.\"\n\nThe bartender asks, \"Why don't you get yourself a job and go to work?\" \"Me? Go to work? Have you ever known me to work? Have you ever known anybody who's known me to work? Well, don't worry, you won't.\" [the bartender leaves]\n\n[on his knees fiddling with the ladder, he looks up] \"Now ain't this somethin'. That old woman across the street, she sees everything that happens in the neighborhood. Now she's done called her sister to the window to witness; she wants to make sure it's me. [yells] Yes, this is me and I'm drunk again.\" [Whenever Dusty Fletcher played the Apollo, Vivian Harris appeared as the old woman in the window. Known as the \"Voice Of The Apollo\", she'd announced all the acts for around 20 years. It's probable that when John Mason or Pigmeat Markham performed \"Richard\" there, she did the same for them.]\n\n[yells, still on his knees fiddling with the ladder] \"Don't open that door, Richard. Don't open no door. I don't want you to get hurt. I'm gonna take my ladder and climb up on top. I don't need no Richard. I'll get in by myself. [Stands up. I find what follows to be truly amazing: in the middle of the stage, he opens the 7-foot ladder about six inches at the bottom, stands it upright, and starts to climb (the two sides should be around four feet apart at the bottom to be stable). His balance is fantastic, considering that he's wearing those long clown shoes and pretending to be drunk. He had to have spent many, many hours practicing this routine.] I'm coming on up there, Richard. [continuing to climb - there are seven steps on the ladder] I don't think I'm gonna be here long, Richard. [He puts his foot on the sixth step, thinks better of it] I'm high as a Georgia pine. But it ain't no use in bein' too high up. [he climbs down]\n\n[he gets off the ladder and lurches around holding it horizontally; it's a miracle that it doesn't hit anyone in the \"audience\"; he finally collapses with the ladder] \"Aw, why don't you open that door, Richard?\" [I assume that there was a lot more to the stage routine, but this is where the movie ended. The whole film was around nine and a half minutes long.]\n\nBut things didn't always go well with the ladder. The December 28, 1946 Billboard reviewed a show at New York's Zanzibar and had this to say about Dusty:\n\nDusty Fletcher had trouble with his ladder. He handles it better in a theater than on a nitery floor. But he had no trouble with his lugubrious chatter and his pleas to Richard to let him in. Boy managed to get some fancy laughs, which was something with customers scattered and trying to gobble.\n\nTHE STRUCTURE\n\nThese are the various musical parts of the recordings (that is, not the spoken dialogs); they were all in the original 1947 sheet music. I'll give them names, since they're found in multiple versions and it'll make them easier to identify.\n\nThe European Intro (used as an introduction in some European versions)\n\nRaindrops down my collar\n\nStanding in the street\n\nRaindrops down my collar\n\nMisery in my feet\n\nI'd give my last dollar\n\nIf I could pick this lock\n\nListen to me holler\n\nListen to me knock\n\nI'll talk about this more in \"The European Intro - What Is It?\" (below)\n\nThe Vocal Refrain (in every version, even if just musically)\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nOpen the door and let me in\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nRichard, why don't you open that door?\n\nJordan's Refrain (in many versions, with varying wording)\n\n'Cause I'm standin' here scratchin' in my pants pocket\n\nand standin' here gropin' in my coat pocket\n\nand standin' here feelin' in my shirt pocket\n\nand I can't find the key\n\nI'll talk about this more in \"Jordan's Refrain - Another Piece Of The Pie\" (below)\n\nLET THE RECORDINGS BEGIN\n\nOkay, I've put it off long enough, we've discussed the history, now let's dive into the recordings.\n\nPossibly the first time Richard hit wax was in a March 1, 1944 Louis Jordan Decca recording, \"How High Am I?\" It's a song about being drunk and it contained the following spoken lines: \"Hey, Richard, come on down here and open this door, man. Don't you see I can't find nothin' down here.\" He also mentions Richard in a couple of other lines without giving any clue as to who Richard is. While Decca never released the tune, Jordan re-recorded it, substantially unchanged, for a V-Disc that was issued in February 1945. Here's a mystery: in a recording called \"Louis' Oldsmobile Song\" (recorded in Los Angeles in early July 1944, probably for a radio show), Jordan begins with \"This is Louie Jordan. I'm happy to be here at Decca, recordin' 'Open Up That Door, Richard'\" and launches into what seems like an Oldsmobile commercial before singing the 1905 oldie, \"In My Merry Oldsmobile\". However, he didn't record \"Richard\" that day, (and wouldn't for another two and a half years), so why did he bring it up?\n\nIn \"Slim's Jam\", a May 1946 Slim Gaillard Bel-Tone release (recorded in December 1945 and also issued on Majestic), he utters the line \"Open up the door, Richard\" immediately before introducing tenor sax player Jack McVea (as \"Jack McVouty and his tenor\"). We'll meet Jack again very soon. (Because McVea was under contract to Apollo Records at the time, he's referred to on both labels as \"Jack Mack\".)\n\nNone of these insertions would make any sense at all unless target audiences knew what the singers were talking about. However, other than ads for Dusty Fletcher doing his \"open that door, Richard\" routine in 1939 and the early 40s, the phrase doesn't seem to appear anywhere in print. Still, I suppose enough black audiences had seen Fletcher perform it so that the phrase had entered the vocabulary. On the other hand, Slim Gaillard was very popular at Billy Berg's integrated jazz nightclub in Hollywood (from which there was a weekly radio broadcast), so maybe whites were also starting to pick up on the term. (Berg's employees fielded a baseball team called the \"Cement Mixers\", after Slim's early 1946 hit song.)\n\nBut this was just the tiny tip of an iceberg that no one spotted floating towards an unsuspecting record-buying public.\n\nJack McVea & His All Stars (Open The Door Richard!)\n\nThis is the first waxing of a \"musical\" version. Recorded for Paul Reiner's Black & White label during the summer of 1946 and released in late September, it features an interchange between Jack and two of his musicians, Robert \"Rabon\" Tarrant (drums) and Joe \"Red\" Kelly (trumpet). McVea had been a member of Lionel Hampton's Orchestra in the early 1940s (he's the baritone sax on Hampton's \"Flying Home\"), and, because Hampton and Fletcher appeared together often, McVea had seen Fletcher's drunk act night after night, since the band would play Dusty's intro and outro. When McVea formed his own band in 1944, he adapted the skit and added music to it. Remember, on the December 1945 \"Slim's Jam\" session, Slim Gaillard says \"Open up the door, Richard\" right before introducing Jack McVea. This tells me that McVea had been incorporating Richard into his West Coast act for a while at that point, although there doesn't seem to be any written evidence of that.\n\nThe story is told that McVea's band was finishing up a recording session for Black & White and had done such a perfect job that there was time left over. Session producer Ralph Bass suggested that they do \"Open The Door, Richard\". This, like most other stories of the kind, is pure fiction. They recorded eight sides at that session, and the master numbers indicate that \"Richard\" was the fifth, not the eighth.\n\nIt starts with the speaker leaving a bar. He tells us:\n\nMcVea: Whole band's been out at the club havin' a little ball tonight. My friend Richard went home early, y'know. He's got the only key to the house. I'll have to knock on the door to see if I can get in. [knocks] Open the door, Richard. Richard sleeps in the back room. It's kinda hard to hear. [knocks louder, voice is more pleading] Open the door, Richard. I don't think Richard heard me yet. [knocks louder; now, for the first time, we hear the Vocal Refrain, sung by the band]\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nOpen the door and let me in\n\nOpen the door, Richard\n\nRichard, why don't you open that door?\n\nMcVea: [knocks even louder] Richard, open up the door, man. It's cold out here in this air. Look, there's that woman across the street, lookin' out the window every time I'm late. [spoken in a normal voice:] Yes, it's me and I'm late again.\n\nTarrant: [this is the first we're aware that the narrator isn't alone] Did you hear what the lady said, Jack?\n\nMcVea: No, what'd she say, Rabon?\n\nTarrant: She said \"Oh, boy, if he was only mine.\"\n\nMcVea: Open up the door, Richard. Red, you got a key to my front door?\n\nKelly: No, I don't have a key, Jack. I don't have a key. [As you read through the various dialogs that I'll present, notice how many times phrases are repeated for no particular reason. I have no explanation for this.]\n\nMcVea: Well, somebody's got to get in the house some kinda way.\n\nTarrant: I know he's in there.\n\nMcVea: How you know he's in there?\n\nTarrant: I can hear him breathing.\n\nMcVea: Oh. Let's knock one more time [really pounds on the door] I know I got on the suit; he's got to be in there. [pounds louder; the Vocal Refrain is repeated and fades out]\n\nNote that the narrator, while using the basic structure of Fletcher's routine, doesn't appear to be drunk. This was pointed out in Billboard's October 12, 1946 review:\n\nAnyone who has seen Dusty Fletcher do his Open the Door routine will get a bang out of Jack McVea's version. Tale of the locked-out drunk is altered for waxing purposes, deleting all references to liquor. Instead of pie-eyed, McVea's Richard is just 'late'. Novelty side divided between comical dialog and singing, packs plenty of chuckles for the listener. Rhythm section sustains the moderate but contagious beat. Only weakness, side ends on a fade-out instead of building to a climax.\n\nWhile they misidentify the narrator as \"Richard\", they're telling us that Fletcher's routine was very well-known at this time, although they say nothing about McVea himself performing \"Richard\".\n\nAs I said, this was released in September 1946, but doesn't seem to have set the world on fire at the time. It's barely mentioned at all in Billboard in 1946: there's a September 14 listing in the Advance Record Releases column and the above October 12 review. The only other mentions for the rest of the year are in two Black & White ads (November 2 and December 14), and those just list it along with their other releases. However, by the end of its run, it had risen to #3 on the Pop charts and #2 on R&B. And, it was the 16th most played jukebox record of 1947.\n\nActually, I did find one early mention in the press. In Owen Callin's \"Record Rendezvous\" column (Metropolitan Pasadena Star-News, October 20, 1946): \"One of the best novelty tunes heard in many a moon has Rendezvous members in a chuckling mood these days. The title is 'Open The Door, Richard' and it's done par excellente [sic] by Jack McVea and his All Stars on a Black and White record.\"\n\nHere's a nice review from the February 9, 1947 Chattanooga Daily Times:\n\n... with Jack McVea and His Orchestra, with what is possibly the original - though no one can be sure - rendition of the ditty that has swept everything before it. We can recommend the particularly plaintive cry for Richard by the vocalist in charge.\n\nJANUARY 1947\n\n1947 started off with a whimper: not a mention of the song at all in the January 4 Billboard. However, the January 11 edition had an ad for the new Dusty Fletcher version, released on National Records. They called it \"The Sensational Novelty That Is Sweeping The Country\" although the trades seemed to be oblivious to it at this point.\n\nDusty Fletcher (Open The Door, Richard!)\n\nHearing his routine being done by someone else, Dusty decided to record his own version. Waxed for National Records on January 4, it was released a short time later. Dusty had been semi-retired after a long career, but this was about to catapult him to real fame. He'd continue working until his death in 1954. However, in the February 9, 1947 Sunday Morning Star (Wilmington, Delaware), Dusty was quoted as saying \"I've got a new and different routine. I can dance and I can sing and I'm tired of 'Open the door, Richard'.\" We can sympathize, but audiences wanted what they wanted. (In fact, Dusty became so famous that the April 13, 1951 Brooklyn Eagle told us that \"Dusty Richards [sic] of 'Open The Door, Richard' fame will head the new burlesque bill starting Sunday at the Hudson Theater, Union City, N.J.\" How fleeting is fame!)\n\nAn article in the March 15, 1947 Baltimore Afro-American said that Jack McVea's version had sold so quickly on the West Coast that there were no copies to ship East. \"Waxie Maxie\" Silverman, owner of Quality Music in Washington, DC was one of those who couldn't get any product to push. So, when Herb Abramson, of National Records, phoned Maxie and asked him for a hot tip on something that could be recorded, Silverman suggested that National contact Dusty and ask him to record the tune. It took less than a week from recording session to Silverman having records in his hands. [I'm sure you all know by now that I have lots of trouble believing most of what's in articles like this one.] Soon, both Abramson and Silverman would be partners with Ahmet Ertegun in Atlantic Records (although Silverman was of the \"silent\" variety).\n\nDusty's version had two parts, with side one mirroring his stage routine. I won't go through the whole thing again, just point out the differences.\n\nTo begin with, this time he doesn't seem to be a fall-down drunk (although he's just been thrown out of the saloon). Then, he wonders what Richard did with the key; maybe he went to sleep with it. After a while, the band comes in with McVea's Vocal Refrain (and continues to do so at various times during the record). There's no bartender in this one, so in Part 2 Dusty just remembers that there's a ladder lying around. Now a policeman enters (probably played by Fred Winn):\n\nCop: Hey boy what are you doing up on that ladder?\n\nDusty: Open the door, Richard, here's The Man out here.\n\nCop: What are you doing up on that ladder?\n\nDusty: I live up here.\n\nCop: You live up there? Well why don't you come down and go in the door?\n\nDusty: I don't live in the door; I live on the second floor.\n\nCop: Come on down off that ladder.\n\nDusty: This is my ladder, officer.\n\nCop: I don't care whose ladder it is, you come down.\n\nDusty: You mean to tell me a man can't sit on his own ladder?\n\nCop: No, a man can't sit on his own ladder.\n\nDusty: That must be a new law just come out. 'Spose I don't come down, then what's gonna happen?\n\nCop: Then I'm gonna whoop you until you get sober. [there ensues a fight in which the cop hits Dusty's bunion, all the while, Dusty is screaming for Richard to open the door]\n\nDusty: Ain't this a shame. Let me come on down. You act like one of them police ain't never arrest nobody before. [Vocal Refrain] What you say you gonna do now?\n\nCop: I said I'm gonna whoop you until you get sober.\n\nDusty: Wait a minute, let's get some understanding here. You're gonna whoop who?\n\nCop: I'm gonna whoop you.\n\nDusty: Oh no you ain't. [they fight; Dusty continues to beg Richard to open the door]\n\nDusty: [as the cop hauls him off while the band sings the Vocal Refrain] Man, I'll be seein' you. Richard, you done me dirty. Aw why don't you open that door, Richard.\n\nThis is actually a good translation of the stage routine into a record (although watching Dusty's \"drunk\" stumble around is hilarious). Dusty's version rose to #3 on the Pop charts and #2 on R&B. It was the 15th most played jukebox record of 1947.\n\nEver wonder why Dusty recorded it? This (nearly) factual explanation appeared in the February 7, 1947 Buffalo News:\n\nWhen Dusty Fletcher was recording a group of six tunes with the Jimmy Jones band, the boys suddenly discovered they'd forgotten to bring the arrangement for the final tune, so they filled in with \"Open The Door, Richard\". Now you can't tune in a program without somebody yelling \"Richard!\". Of such is fame.\n\nThe January 13 Cash Box had this to say about Dusty's version: \"'Open The Door, Richard!' is showing up big in various parts of the country, according to reports. This version, done by Dusty Fletcher, is bound to score heavily, since the lad has been using it in his routine for the past fifteen years, and reports have it that it originated with him. Both sides of the platter are devoted to 'Richard', which is, in effect, a comedy skit interspersed with a few musical bars and choral effects from the crew. Catchline of the entire piece are the words 'Open The Door, Richard!' So catchy is that refrain that it may catch on and become another 'Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop' or 'Cement Mixer'.\"\n\nThe January 25 Billboard reviewed Dusty's version:\n\nWith everyone asking Richard to open the door, the label [National] scored a scoop in grabbing off Dusty Fletcher to put his comedy specialty, \"Open The Door, Richard\", on wax. For it was Fletcher who has been kicking around the routine for almost two decades on the stage, in niteries and in burly temples. And while Fletcher's mugging accompaniment can't be transposed on the spinning grooves, he gives a good account of his alcoholic attempts to get roommate Richard to \"open the door\" before that policeman gets the best of him, which he does. To give the grooving a song structure, Jimmy Jones and his small band improvise a riff refrain around the title, adding piano tinkles under Fletcher's storytelling of the specialty, which takes both sides of the disk. Of course, it all makes little sense for those not familiar with Fletcher's stock specialty. But for the many others, it's a desired disking.\n\nAssociation of Dusty Fletcher with a catch-phrase now sweeping the country should find many putting in two nickels to take in both sides of the specialty.\n\nThe February 14, 1947 Buffalo Evening News had a large article about Dusty and Richard, in which he recounted its history. It contradicts John Mason's account, but there's absolutely no way to know how much of this is true.\n\nDusty can't explain Richard's sudden popularity, but he can give you his early history. And since most of the people now shouting for Richard don't know what all the shouting's about, it seems only fair to set it down here.\n\nRichard was born, but not christened, in a Charleston, S.C. speakeasy. In those days Dusty was a straight dramatic player with the stock company called the Luke A. Scott Players. The gin mill's proprietor gave an after-theater party for the cast, and succeeded in shooing out all the previous customers but one. \"This one fellow was sort of drunk,\" says Dusty, \"and he wanted to stay. Finally the bartender threw him out in the alley. We just stood around and pitied him. But pretty soon he got up. And the first thing he said was 'I'm going back in there.' Then he started talking to himself and telling what he was going to do.\n\n\"A few weeks later we decided to switch from straight plays to musical comedy. I insisted on putting in the bit about this fellow standing out in the alley and talking to himself. That's how the act started.\n\n\"I developed it and changed it. At first I just used any name when I called up for my roommate to come down and open the door so I could go to bed. Then, in Philadelphia - in '28 I think it was - I had a little tab show with Bessie Smith, the famous blues singer. Her husband was the ticket-taker. His name was Richard Morgan.\n\n\"I got so I'd use his name. I'd see him out there at the back of the house and I'd yell\" 'Open the door, Richard!' He'd smile and wave at me. And I got a big laugh using his name . At first, I thought they were laughing because they knew Bessie's husband. He was pretty well known around there. But pretty soon, all over town, they were saying, 'Open the door, Richard. Open the door, Richard.' So I left the name in.\"\n\nWhile I can find references to the Luke A. Scott players, there are no mentions of them in South Carolina, nor is Dusty (or even Clinton) Fletcher ever associated with them (at least in print). On top of that, between 1924 and 1932, Bessie Smith was never advertised in Philadelphia.\n\nFinally, some recognition. The January 18, 1947 Billboard said that Jack McVea was \"riding the charts\" and was scheduled to appear on the Bing Crosby radio show (Philco Radio Time) on January 22. Actually, the song had taken off quickly and quietly, seemingly behind Billboard's back. We know this because Crosby's show had been pre-recorded on January 6. According to a statement McVea later made, Crosby was given some lines in that performance.\n\nThe January 13 Cash Box's \"Around The Wax Circle\" column tried to explain the song's burgeoning popularity:\n\n\"Open The Door, Richard!\" seems a likely subject with which to open this week's column. So here goes. As many members of the trade are by now well aware, \"Richard!\" appears to be enjoying a lush sale in most every territory where it has appeared. Fortunately, or unfortunately, (as you like it), the number has not as yet made its appearance in New York, but it is certainly getting lots and lots of attention from just about everybody with claims to membership in our wax circle. One thing might be said about it. Among the Eastern lads in the business who were quizzed as to an opinion on the worthiness of the number, the greater majority of those quizzed by this department were of the conviction that the number is strictly a stiff.\n\nIs it?\n\nAll the fanfare and big wind the ditty raised on the West Coast is in absolute denial of such criticism. Still, after listening to several versions of it, we couldn't help but side with the majority who gave it the heave-o. What has it got ? A few bars of catchy melody and refrain? Okay. Maybe it has. At any rate, we found out that practically all of the big majors are working like mad to get out a platter of \"Open The Door, Richard!\" So, because we are very curious and like to know what we don't know, we grabbed an expert on the telephone. We called Milt Gabler of Decca, the lad who has lots to do with artists and music for that label, and who, incidentally, is one of the authors of \"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie.\"\n\n\"Dear Milt,\" said we. \"Pray tell, why is everybody so hepped up about this 'Richard' which we, and lots of other folks, can't see for anything but a two-ton turkey. Could it be that the public is putting good money into the phonos to hear a couple of guys holler 'Open The Door, Richard!'? All the rest of it is just so much chin-chin.\"\n\nSaid Milt: \"Aha! And that's it! That's what they're paying for, the comedy of it. The monologue, the skit,\" implying, did Milt, that what melody and chorus there was to it was just so much accessory after the fact.\n\nOkay. We hung up. We had the opinion of an expert. And we couldn't find so much as a single representative of the Great American Public to confirm or deny it.\n\nBut there will be.\n\nNow things start to heat up quickly. Smelling money, the lawyers pounced. There was a big article in Billboard on January 25 headed \"'Open The Door, Richard' And Let All The Lawyers Come In\". It said that Jack McVea had sold over 200,000 copies on the West Coast and that Dusty's version was big in New York, Baltimore, and Washington. National Records claimed that Dusty's routine had been copyrighted by him and (conveniently) transferred to National Music Publishing Company. The McVea tune, it went on to say, had been written by McVea, Frank Clarke, and Dan Howell. They (conveniently) turned the copyright over to Leeds Music. They admitted that McVea's version was based on Fletcher's routine, but there was a question of \"personal property copyright, not song copyright\" (I have no idea what that means and I'm probably happier for it). The article went on to say that, in spite of these problems, the song was doing so well that Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and the 3 Flames were all about to release versions.\n\nI've already said that, in mid-January, John Mason contacted Duchess Music and made his case for authorship. (Since I've mentioned Duchess and Leeds, you should know that both publishing companies were owned by Lou Levy, manager of the Andrews Sisters. Duchess was BMI-affiliated and Leeds was ASCAP-affiliated. Levy made Duchess the official publisher and Leeds its selling agent. This means that Duchess owned the copyright and collected the money for the authors and that Leeds was authorized to handle licensing agreements. This duality appears to have been triggered by a fight Levy was having with ASCAP.) When the dust had settled, the official writers were: words by John Mason and Dan Howell; music by Jack McVea and Frank Clarke. At least that's what it said on the initial 1947 sheet music published by Duchess. When Leeds put out the sheet music a short time later, poor Frank Clarke had disappeared, to be replaced by Dusty Fletcher. Then, it became: words by Dusty Fletcher and John Mason; music by Jack McVea and Dan Howell. (This might have been a sop to ASCAP, since Howell was one of their members.) Duchess' sheet music credits were soon changed to match Leeds'.\n\nHere's a Tune-Dex card for \"Open The Door, Richard\". This was an index card with copyright information on one side and the basic structure of the song on the other. Armed with one of these, bands could perform the tune and know to whom royalties should be paid. Note that this was an early version, since the writer credits were: music by Jack McVea and Frank Clarke; words by John Mason and Dan Howell (mirroring the original Duchess sheet music).\n\nWHO WAS DAN HOWELL?\n\nThe name of Frank Clarke (bassist in McVea's band) quickly disappeared from the writer credits, to be replaced by \"Dan Howell\". So, of course, we have to ask \"Who was Dan Howell?\" The common answer is that it was just a made-up name, used by the publishers in order to siphon off some of McVea's royalties to their coffers.\n\nHowever, although \"Dan Howell\" was a made-up name, the man himself was very real. In fact \"Dan Howell\" turns out to be one of the songwriting pseudonyms of David Kapp, future owner of Kapp Records and brother of Decca president, Jack Kapp. At this time, David Kapp was a Vice President of Decca.\n\nToday, BMI has the song registered to Kapp, not Howell. More important, I own a copy of the 1952 edition of \"The ASCAP Biographical Dictionary\", which mentions David Kapp as being a writer of \"Open The Door, Richard\". (At least one other song in Kapp's biography had originally been credited to \"Dan Howell\".) And, when you enter Howell's name into ASCAP's database, the results you get are for David Kapp.\n\nBACK TO THE JANUARY RELEASES\n\nThat same January 25 Billboard warned that it's going to skyrocket and then fizzle, as hits like this usually do. It announced that Count Basie's version will soon be available on Victor, Decca will likely assign it to Louis Jordan (they did; he'd already recorded it on January 11 and re-recorded it on January 23, although it wasn't released until February), Columbia had the 3 Flames, and Mercury's version featured Bill Samuels and the Cats 'n Jammer Three.\n\nOf course, every version had to be a little different (and why not, there was plenty to work with).\n\n[NOTE: Jack McVea and Dusty Fletcher had the first two recordings. I can usually narrow all the others down to a particular month, but I don't know their release order. Fortunately, it isn't really important.]\n\nCount Basie & His Orchestra (Open The Door, Richard!)\n\nBasie's version featured vocals by trumpeter Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and trombonist Bill Johnson. It starts with sounds of people talking in a bar. Over the noise you hear:\n\nEdison: The whole band's having a party at the club tonight. Ol' Richard went home early; he's got the key to the house. I'm gonna knock on the door and see if I can get in. [knocks] Open the door, Richard. Y'see, Richard sleeps in the back room; it's kinda hard to hear. Maybe I'd better knock a little louder. [knocks] Open the door, Richard. I don't think Richard heard me yet. Knock one more time, let's see what's gonna happen. [knocks] Richard, open the door please. [Vocal Refrain] Richard, open the door, man, it's kinda cold out here in this air. Now look, there's that old woman across the street lookin' out the window.\n\nJohnson: Who's that with her, Sweets?\n\nEdison: That must be her sister, I guess. She wants to make sure this is me. She's tryin' to find out what's happenin' Yes it's me and I'm late again.\n\nJohnson: Sweets did you hear what the lady said?\n\nEdison: No, what did she say?\n\nJohnson: She said you sure look common out here in the street.\n\nEdison: Common? Man, I got class I ain't never used yet. I'm gonna knock again, Richard's got to get up. [knocks] Open the door, Richard. Have you got a key to the house?\n\nJohnson: No, Sweets, I don't have a key. I don't have a key.\n\nEdison: Somebody's got to get in the house. Can't climb in the front, but I know he's in there.\n\nJohnson: How you know he's in there?\n\nEdison: I can hear him breathin'. Let's knock one more time. [knocks] Richard, open that door, man. Maybe Richard's gone. [knocks; Vocal Refrain] I know I got on the only suit. Ain't got but one suit between us That's the reason why I don't like to room with nobody. Richard, why don't you open the door, man? [fades out]\n\nA blurb in the January 22, 1947 St. Louis Post-Dispatch said, \"The song about an inebriate may go big, but musically this is Basie's worst record.\" In spite of that less-than-stellar review, the Count's version made it to #1 on the Pop charts (the only #1 record he'd ever have) and #2 R&B. It was the 19th most played jukebox record of 1947.\n\nThe 3 Flames (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nThe 3 Flames, with a vocal by George \"Tiger\" Haynes, added to the mix with their Columbia version.\n\n[knocks] Open the door, Richard.\n\n[knocks] Open the door, Richard.\n\n[louder knocking and speaking] Open the door, Richard.\n\n[he knocks and yells] Hey, Dick, open that door!\n\n[Vocal Refrain]\n\nNow here I am standin' diggin' in my hip pocket.\n\nHere I am standin' scratchin' in my pants pocket.\n\nI'm out here gropin' in my coat pocket.\n\nI don't know; I just can't find that key.\n\n[NOTE: that last part is what I'll be referring to as \"Jordan's Refrain\". You'll see why shortly.]\n\nI don't know.\n\n[Vocal Refrain]\n\nNow here it is four o'clock in the morning and I'm just getting' home. I had the chance. I shoulda been home eleven o'clock. I know I left the key at home, I know that. So, I'm gonna have to wake up Richard; he's my roommate. He's a real great cat. I gotta wake him up. I know that.\n\n[lot of very indistinct wording here]\n\nRichard, open the door. Y'know, I'll tell ya somethin', Jack, when he sleeps, he sleeps, man. He's what we call a 20th Century Rip van Winkle. That cat falls asleep and he dies. Richard, open the door; it's getting' kinda cold out c'here. Open, Richard.\n\n[Here, he goes in to a strange routine about Richard and he having gone to California. There's a part about a mouse sitting in the middle of the bed eating an onion and crying like a baby.]\n\nRichard, open up the door, it's getting' cold out c'here. Gettin' cold, Richard. Richard. Richard, open the door.\n\n[Vocal Refrain]\n\n[some indistinct words] open that door 'cause I have so much to tell him.\n\n[more indistinct words] Now, why didn't Richard open that door?\n\nThe song was reviewed in the February 15, 1947 Billboard, calling it a \"bright bounce version.... As long as Richard refuses to open that door, that's the side to show up in the music boxes.\" This one also hit #1 on the Pop charts and #3 on R&B. The group's stage routine ended with a well-received and well-reviewed 10-minute version.\n\nBill Samuels and the Cats 'N Jammer Three (Open Up That Door, Richard)\n\nTheir Mercury version has vocals by bassist Sylvester Hickman and pianist Bill Samuels. It's mostly an instrumental, featuring the Vocal Refrain and minimal lyrics:\n\nHickman: [knocking] Open the door, Richard. Man I know you're there 'cause I got on all the clothes and I know you ain't gone nowhere. [Vocal Refrain] Guess I better go 'round and get this ladder. [hic] I had me a fifth of port wine. [hic] I'm so high, I'm up in the sky. High as a Georgia pine. [Vocal Refrain] Open the door, Richard. Open up that door, man. Now ain't that a shame; won't let me in and I owe just as much rent as he does. [Vocal Refrain]\n\nSamuels: Say, brother Hickman\n\nHickman: Yeah, brother Bill?\n\nSamuels: Where's your wife, man?\n\nHickman: Oh, man, she's inside the house. Where do you think she's supposed to be?\n\nSamuels: Well, where's Richard???\n\nHickman: Man, he's in ... OH, RICHARD! [pounds on the door] Open that door!\n\nTosh (One-String Willie) & His Jivesters (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nGeorge Paxton, using the stage name of Tosh Hammed, released a calypso version on Maceo Pinkard's Empey label in late January. The other voice on the record was Dorothy Chappelle, with Virgil Van Cleve plunking the ukulele. Tosh Hammed played a one-stringed violin (hence the \"One-String Willie\" nickname). He'd been around since the early years of the Twentieth Century and you can see him in a Soundie called \"Dance Your Old Age Away\". I haven't heard this one.\n\nThe record was reviewed in the March 1, 1947 Billboard: \"... this one has Tosh (One-String Willie) giving the saga in West Indian lingo, making for a calypso creation. And for added verbal novelty, dips into an Irish brogue with Dorothy Chappelle, having designs on entering her house until Dickie decides to open that door. Virgil Van Cleve keeps up a rhythmic pace with his uke strums. .... The calypso version of 'Richard' makes a strong bid for the coin [jukebox] market.\"\n\nDick Peterson & His Vocal Yokels (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nA group made up of former Spike Jones musicians (Peterson was a drummer), their version was on Enterprise. (Note that this is sometimes, incorrectly, credited to Spike Jones, himself, recording as the \"Vocal Yokels\".) The January 25, 1947 Billboard starts its review by telling us \"Dick Peterson, ex-Spike Jones drummer, fronts a group consisting of remnants of the reorganized Jones crew.\" They go on to pan the song, saying \"Yokel's version of Open The Door is pretty sad compared to Jack McVea's original waxing. Dialog in Swedish accent is too far out of character to be funny.\"\n\nI have to agree with the reviewer. bandleader Peterson, using a Swedish accent, is sent to find Richard, a horn player who didn't show up for band practice. They give him the address and he leaves with \"You keep the yoint a-yumpin' until I get back here\". He then proceeds to misremember the address, pounding on a couple of doors and waking up people who aren't Richard. He finally finds Richard, who sounds like an idiot, and that's basically the end of the song. At least it has the Vocal Refrain.\n\nOn January 31, 1947, Dusty Fletcher (\"creator of 'Open The Door, Richard') appeared with Count Basie's band at the Paradise Theater in Detroit. That must have been one fantastic routine they did together.\n\nON THE RADIO\n\nOn January 26, 1947, the \"Showtime With Frankie Masters\" program (from San Antonio, Texas) broadcast a version of \"Open The Door, Richard\". The lyrics talk about the band being at a club and Richard going home early and, of course, he's got the only key to the house. If they could only get in. They do the Vocal Refrain and talk about the old woman, the fact that they can hear Richard breathing, and that one of them has on the only suit. This is just one example of probably hundreds of on-air performances.\n\nI imagine that every radio comedian managed to sneak the catchphrase into some routines. For example, on the Fred Allen Show, Fred knocks on a door and one of his characters, Mrs. Nussbaum, says \"Nu, you expecting maybe Richard?\" It was reported that, during a serious radio drama, a character knocked on a door and someone in the audience yelled out \"Come in, Richard\". That was enough to get the whole audience roaring with laughter. (Not really what you want from a drama.)\n\nThere was even a Yiddish version by Molly Picon, called \"Effen Die Door, Yonkel\". It seems to have been a transcription (presumably from or for a radio show) on a 10\" Electro-Vox Studio Recordings one-sided disc. I have no idea when it was from, but I'm certain it would have been 1947. I doubt I'll ever get to hear this one.\n\nEven Gilbert & Sullivan got into the act. On February 17, there was a birthday party for President Truman's daughter, Margaret. One of the acts was singer John Charles Thomas, who did a number from G&S's \"HMS Pinafore\". As the Argus-Leader (Sioux Falls, South Dakota) reported: \"At one point during the performance of 'Pinafore,' when he was called back for several encores, the baritone, feigning exhaustion, stumbled over to a prop door, knocked sharply, and cried, 'Open the door, Richard.'\" The February 23 edition of the same paper had an ad for an Open The Door, Richard Dance at the New Arkota Ballroom. All men named Richard would be admitted free.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Courier of February 15 mentions some of the radio programs that have embraced Richard: \"Practically every big radio show, including those of Jack Benny, Fred Allen, Fibber McGee & Molly, Red Skelton, Phil Harris and others, have at some time during the past few weeks implored the obdurate Richard to crack the portal. And while the mythical man stubbornly refuses to comply, he has nevertheless opened a lot of mouths around the country, as their owners laugh over this latest bit of tomfoolery peculiar to America. .... Of course, it's only wonderful while it lasts, the only trouble being that it doesn't last too long. Heretofore whenever a novelty has had such a wildfire sweep, it has been played to death for a couple of weeks until it becomes the number one hit on the nightmare parade and nobody cares if they never hear it again.\" Others who exploited Richard on the air were Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Al Jolson, and Eddie Cantor.\n\nFEBRUARY 1947\n\nNow, get ready for the February explosion: there were over a dozen versions and answer records released (since huge potential profits were clearly in sight). Note that there was something called the \"Record Of The Month Club\" that somehow issued important records with their own \"Honor Award\" logo around the original label. McVea's was the choice for February 1947.\n\nLouis Jordan (Open The Door, Richard!)\n\nThe lyrics of Jordan's Decca version don't make much sense (although who says they have to?). He goes from talking about a drunk named Zeke to talking about himself, while he shouts \"open the door, Richard\", at odd intervals, for no particular reason. (We're never told who Richard is or why he should open the door. Jordan assumed that everyone knew - remember, he'd first recorded that line back in 1944.) The UK release was on Brunswick.\n\n[Vocal Refrain followed by call-and-response with the band]\n\nI met old Zeke standin' on the corner the other day,\n\nThat cat sure was booted with liquor!\n\n[He was what?]\n\nHe was abnoxicated!\n\n[He was what?]\n\nHe was inebriated!\n\n[He was what?]\n\nWell, he was just plain drunk!\n\n[Well all right, then!]\n\nHe sure was salty with the bartender. The bartender was tryin' to make him buy another drink. Zeke told the bartender \"Ain't no need of me buyin' no drinks when everybody else is buyin' 'em. I'm goin' to drink to everybody's health 'til I ruin my own.\" Open the door, Richard.\n\nWhy, he don't know who he's throwin' out of that joint! [Did someone throw someone else out? There are gaps in his narrative. Notice that Zeke has disappeared and now he's talking about himself.] Why, I'll go back in that joint and take a short stick and bust it down to the ground! Open the door, Richard.\n\nBut I hate to be caught out on the street like this 'cause it makes you look so common. And I know I ain't common 'cause I got class I ain't never used yet.\n\nBut I guess I better get on in the house 'cause I don't want my pastor to catch me out like this. Hey Richard, open the door.\n\nNow look at that old woman 'cross the street, done stuck her head out of the window, callin' her sisters. Look at a bunch of her sisters sayin' \"Ain't that him? Ain't that him?\" Yes, it's me, and I'm drunk again! Open the door, Richard.\n\nI know he's in there 'cause I got on the clothes. [Here, he goes into the bit about the rent he owes his landlady.] Open the door, Richard. Hey, Richard, open the door.\n\n[sings] 'Cause I'm standin' here scratchin' in my pants pocket; and standin' here gropin' in my coat pocket; and standin' here feelin' in my shirt pocket; and I can't find the key. Hey, open the door, Richard. **\n\n[Vocal Refrain]\n\n** I'll be referring to the part about feeling around for the key as \"Jordan's Refrain\" in order to make it easier to talk about (see \"Jordan's Refrain - Another Piece Of The Pie\", below).\n\nThose lyrics reflect his January 23 recording of the tune. He'd originally recorded it on January 11, but there was a big problem with that version: he wasn't talking about some fictional \"Zeke\", he specifically named Dusty (\"I met old Dusty Fletcher standin' on the corner the other day talkin' to some guy named Richard. Old Dusty sure was booted with liquor.\"). Decca asked Dusty for a release for the use of his name, but Dusty refused and threatened to sue. He may have been celebrated for playing a drunk onstage, but it's a different matter to be called one. So it was back into the studio, goodbye Dusty, hello Zeke.\n\nThe song was reviewed in the March 1, 1947 Billboard: \"Even if Richard ever does open the door, this disking by Louis Jordan will still be a wax delight.\" It rose to #2 on the R&B charts and was the 14th most played jukebox record of 1947. (Note that, of the top 34 most played jukebox records of 1947, Jordan had 10 of them. A true superstar.)\n\nThe Charioteers (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nTheir Columbia version has the main vocal by Billy Williams. Some of the new lyrics were:\n\nWilliams: Say, I don't like your friends, man, and I don't think they like me either.\n\nSecond voice: Who's that, man?\n\nWilliams: Those two brothers, Haig & Haig. [a brand of whiskey]\n\n[He then takes the others to meet his friend, Richard, with the usual results. Lots of knocking and lots of yelling. After the Vocal Refrain, they go into the woman across the street routine and add the following:]\n\nSecond voice: Did you hear what she said?\n\nWilliams: Wha'd she say?\n\nSecond voice: She said \"Look at him, there he comes home late again. I sure wish he was mine.\"\n\nWilliams: And I wish you were mine and I'd come back \"Double Indemnity\". [While I've seen that movie many times, I can't say I understand the reference.]\n\nSecond voice: Say, look here, man, maybe Richard ain't alone. Perhaps you should say \"ouvre la porte\".\n\nWilliams: Ouvre la devil. I'm gonna knock on this door one more time and try to get Richard up from there.\n\n[A policeman enters; Billy Williams responds to him, but the cop never speaks]\n\nWilliams: Hiya officer. Breakin' in? Why, man, I live here. If I had a key, I wouldn't be bangin' on the door. My draft card? Now ain't that somethin', here's a man askin' for a draft card two years after the war is over. If you want to see it, though, I got to show it to ya. I know it's on me 'cause I carried it for four years and I was in 4-F all the time. I ain't got but one suit so it's got to be on me somewhere... Somewhere... Somewhere. [pounds on the door] Come on, Richard, open the door; The Man wants to see my draft card, man.\n\n[Vocal Refrain]\n\nWilliams: I know he's in there 'cause I hear the radio jumpin'.\n\nThe song was reviewed in the March 8, 1947 Billboard: \"This is a more sober Richard, without the violent supplications that the door be opened.\" However, they actually liked the flip better (\"You Can't See The Sun When You're Cryin'\"). This one rose to #6 on the Pop charts.\n\nBig Sid Catlett (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nCatlett released a really strange version on Manor, with main vocal by pianist Bill Gooden. It starts with a bizarre affected British accent, which, after the Vocal Refrain, morphs into a West Indian accent (even though he's speaking to \"SeÃ±or Richard\") and then, after the next Vocal Refrain, changes to a Harlem accent, none of this for any apparent reason. They do the \"he lives in the back\" routine, the \"landlady\" routine, the \"only suit\" routine, and the \"lady across the street\" routine. Other than the strange accents, it brings nothing new to the table and is one of the weakest entries in the series.\n\nBill Osborne & His Heptet (Open The Door Richard)\n\nOsborne's version, on Continental, starts with a long sax solo, followed by the Vocal Refrain, Jordan's Refrain, and the Vocal Refrain again. Osborne then launches into some dialog, starting with the standard knocking, asking to be let in, and the woman across the street. This time, they can hear him snoring, rather than breathing. In all, it would have been a better record if it had just been an instrumental. The review in the February 22, 1947 Billboard says that the sax work is by Arnett Cobb, piano by Milt Buckner, and guitar by Bill Makel. They also said that \"While Osborne displays good voice, it's too even-tempered to make this back-biting wordage count.\" Others on the January 1947 recording were Joe Morris (trumpet), Jackie Kelso (reeds), Charlie Harris (bass), and Curley Hamner (drums). I don't know who Bill Osborne was; several musicians shared the name (a drummer, a trumpeter, and a pianist, none of which he would have been on this record).\n\nGeorge Washington & Band (Open The Door Richard)\n\nTrombonist George Washington's version featured a vocal by trumpeter Harry Parr Jones. (Jones had been with Johnny Otis in 1945; Washington would be with Otis in 1950.) This one came out on Roy Milton's Los Angeles-based Ace Records and had one of William Alexander's beautiful drawings on the label. Truer to the Fletcher routine, it starts with him being thrown out of the bar and claiming that he's not supposed to buy drinks because everybody else is buying them. \"I'm gonna drink to everybody else's health until I ruins my own.\" He staggers home and encounters the woman across the street. He then realizes that he can't find his key and has to wake Richard up. This time, however, Richard is \"kinda hard of hearing\" rather than sleeping in the back room. Less accepting than most, he ends with \"Never mind, I'll kick it in\" [and does]. It's not a slick rendition and I like it because of that.\n\n\"Lips\" Page (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nOran \"Hot Lips\" Page was Apollo's entry into the fray. Again, no real surprises here, but some of the dialog is rhymed, including \"Every time I wear the suit, he starts actin' cute\" and the whole landlady routine. Then, someone suggests that Page blow his trumpet to wake up Richard.\n\nThe song was reviewed in the March 8, 1947 Billboard with the overall comment: \"While 'Richard' is still not amenable, that side will stand up in the phonos.\"\n\nWhile all the versions up until now have been by black artists (except for the Vocal Yokels), there was too much money involved to keep it in the black community. This led to a Country & Western version and a couple in the Pop field.\n\nHank Penny (Open The Door Richard)\n\nHis C&W version was on King (and listed in Billboard's Advance Record Releases column as a \"Folk\" record). The vocal isn't terribly clear, as pointed out in its March 8 Billboard review: \"Talking is discerned only by some ardent listening.\" They're going home because it's late and, of course, no one has the key. They knock, tell us that Richard sleeps in the back room, and knock some more. The old lady is there too, but they tell her to shut up because it's none of her business. One suggests that they rent a hotel room, but Hank is broke. Finally, they realize that \"Richard ain't here\"; he's left a note on the door telling them that he's gone on tour with Kilroy.\n\n[For those who don't know, \"Kilroy\" was itself a phenomenon of World War 2. Another shadowy character like Richard, he's usually depicted as a simplistic drawing of a face peeking over a fence. You can see his hands, his eyes, and his long nose hanging down. It's always accompanied by the legend, \"Kilroy was here\" and was found wherever GIs went during the war. Many, many radio comedy routines incorporated Kilroy and it seemed only natural that, since many, many comedy routines were now incorporating Richard, the two of them should get together.]\n\nThe Pied Pipers (Open The Door Richard)\n\nTheir Pop version was on Capitol, and the music is much more robust (as you would expect from a Pop rendition). This one starts off with the bunch of them having just gotten into town. The hotels are all full, but Richard said they could stay with him. So they knock, with the usual results. They go through the Vocal Refrain and Jordan's Refrain (which makes no sense, since they're not supposed to have the key). After the standard yelling, they decide to throw a pebble at his window to wake him up. Would it surprise you to learn that they break the window? Finally, \"Hey, did anybody think of trying the doorknob?\" \"Gee, it isn't even locked.\" The door creaks open (reminiscent of the \"Inner Sanctum\" radio show), there's a scream, and one of them says, \"Oh, pardon me.\" The Pied Pipers' version made it to #8 on the Pop charts.\n\nThe Merry Macs (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nTheir Majestic recording is the other Pop version. It starts with the Vocal Refrain, Jordan's Refrain, and the Vocal Refrain again. Then, they sing the jivey \"break it up and wake up and open the door.\" This is followed by the Vocal Refrain again and \"It ain't no use to holler, ain't no good to knock. I'd give my last dollar if I could pick the lock. If we don't get no action, we're gonna count to ten. And boy will you be fractured when we bust it in.\" [they musically count to nine; the door opens; a voice says] \"Come in. Glad to see you.\" [This is said in a slight accent of some sort, leading me to believe that it was another catchphrase, but, if it is, I can't identify it.] In all, in spite of their fine voices, it's a very poor entry in the series. However, this is the only American recording that used a version of the European Intro. (See \"The European Intro - What Is It?\".)\n\nNote that it was fine for black and \"hillbilly\" performers to stagger home drunk, but not white Pop groups.\n\nTranscriptions (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nKnown transcriptions were by the Freddy Martin orchestra (on Standard), pianist Barclay Allen (on C.P. MacGregor), and the Jan Garber orchestra on Capitol. Transcriptions were for radio broadcasts, and not meant to be released to the public. I haven't heard these.\n\nJ. Lawrence Cook (Open The Door, Richard!)\n\nI didn't know it was still being done in 1947, but Cook recorded a player piano roll of the song, released by QRS. (Shows you what I know. QRS is still turning out piano rolls in 2016.) It sounds pretty much as you'd expect a piano roll to sound.\n\nWalter Brown (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nBacked by the Tiny Grimes Sextet, this Signature recording was the version that nearly destroyed the entire franchise. Judge for yourself (I have no idea which voice is Brown's, although it's probably \"Richard\"):\n\nFirst voice [rhyming]: Now I've been listening to all this talk about this character they call 'Richard'. But I can't seem to find old Richard around. So I figured I'd better come down by Richard's place and see what old Dick's puttin' down. You know one thing? Richard must be up there breakin' the law. There must be some reason he won't open that door.\n\nSecond voice [rhyming]: Yeah, I'm late for a date an' you know I'm gonna wait. See Richard [indistinct] here when he opens that gate.\n\nChorus: Hey, Dick. Hey, Dick. Come out and open that door.\n\n[Vocal Refrain, occasionally saying \"Open the door, Dickie\"]\n\nRichard: OK, OK, what's all the excitement about down there, man?\n\nFirst voice: Say, who are you up there with your head stuck out the window?\n\nRichard: I'm Richard.\n\nFirst voice: You're Richard? Well get away from that window and come on down here and open that damn door.\n\nRichard: Now listen here, I'm in here havin' myself a ball. I got me a fine, mellow little chick and the blue lights are on and my old wife's way down in Birmingham, Alabama. Everything is groovy. What happens? Everybody starts hollerin' for me to open the door. Phil Harris wants me to open the door. Bing Crosby wants me to open the door. Jack Benny wants me to open the door. If I don't open up for them, damned if I'll open up for you. Why can't you give a man a little peace?\n\nFirst voice: That's what you been gettin'. You come out here and open that door and give us a little piece [play on words].\n\n[Vocal Refrain]\n\nFirst voice: Hey, wait a minute. Man, this door ain't even locked. Hey, look out, Richard, here we come.\n\nThis one caused an uproar. Drunkenness and stupidity the establishment could somehow handle; cursing and sex they couldn't. There was this, in the March 8, 1947 Billboard: \"... the Signature pressing of the novelty number cut by Walter Brown and the Tiny Grimes Sextet, is being recalled from sale because of some allegedly blue lyrics. Bob Thiele, Signature president [and future husband of Teresa Brewer], said he couldn't estimate the loss involved in view of pressings already sold.\" The record had already been on the market for a month, however, the Mutual Broadcasting System (with around 400 affiliates) had banned Brown's version; Thiele had no choice.\n\nBing Crosby (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nDer Bingle recorded it for Decca in February (possibly done with Dick Haymes), but it was never released. This is one I'd really like to hear.\n\nCharlie Spivak (Open The Door, Richard)\n\nAccording to a February 1, 1947 Duchess Music ad, trumpeter/orchestra leader Charlie Spivak had recorded it for RCA Victor. This is another one that was never released.\n\nBut covers are one thing. In order to become a phenomenon, you've got to have answer records and other recordings that prolong the series. These were the additional February entries:\n\nThe 4 Aces (Richard Ain't Gonna Open That Door)\n\nA new group on the scene, the 4 Aces had been recording for Trilon Records for less than two months. \"Richard Ain't Gonna Open That Door\" was led by George Smith. It starts with knocking and the pleading voice \"Open up this door, Richard. It's cold out here in this air.\" This is followed by train whistle noises for some reason. Richard appears: \"This is Richard and I'm very much in clothes. .... I ain't gonna open that door. No, no. .... They think I'm gonna open that door, but they're wrong. No, no. I ain't gonna open that door. Them cats is shockin' my modesty.\" He ends with \"Keep on knockin', just keep on knockin'.\" His refrain is: \"Them cats keep a-knockin' [repeated a few times] and I ain't gonna open that door.\" Much of his speech is garbled and it's not a great record by any standards.\n\nThe 4 Aces (Richard's Jam)\n\nThe flip of \"Richard Ain't Gonna Open That Door\" is an instrumental based on the melody to the Vocal Refrain and is, to me, much more enjoyable than the spoken side.\n\nRusty Gill & The Prairie Ramblers (Open Up That Door, Hiram)\n\nThis is a Hillbilly tune, on Mercury, from February 1947. Clearly influenced by Richard, Ralph \"Rusty\" Gill sings about a guy who's desperate to get into the outhouse, but Uncle Hiram is in there and won't answer or open the door. He says \"Open that door, boy it's cold out here (cain't be very warm in there, neither).\" As a bow to Richard, he says: \"You're just like that other fella I know. Well, he never opened the door, did he?\" A cute song.\n\nReedum & Weep (My Name Ain't Richard, Part 1 & 2)\n\nThis answer record was on bandleader Ben Pollack's Jewel label. You'd think, with a name like \"Reedum & Weep\", they'd have been documented playing theaters, but there's nothing at all about them. Fortunately, Jewel Records was purchased by Savoy in May 1951, and the Savoy discography shows the master number for \"My Name Ain't Richard, Part 1\" (JRC 261) to have been recorded by the Two Black Crows on January 14 (although no titles were given for either side). Strangely, Part 2 has a lower master number (JRC 260).\n\nSo who were the Two Black Crows? I initially thought that would be an easy question to answer: they were an old vaudeville act, a white duo that appeared in blackface. Naturally, it got more complicated quickly. The Two Black Crows were originally Charles Mack and John Swor. When Swor left the act, he was replaced by George Moran. From that point on, they were known as both the \"Two Black Crows\" and \"Moran & Mack\". The Crows were extremely popular until they were supplanted by Amos & Andy (originally another white duo). In 1927, John Swor teamed up with Jack Goode and their blackface act was called the \"Two Black Aces\". By the early 40s, Charles Mack had died and George Moran was mostly retired (although at the time of his death in 1949, Moran and his new partner Rade \"Pie\" Sadler had implausible plans to bring the act to television). Swor and Goode, however, were still going strong and had renamed their act the \"Two Black Crows\". Under that name, they entertained at USO shows in the Los Angeles area, appeared at L.A. theaters, and made this record. We'll probably never know whose decision it was to rename the \"Two Black Crows\" to \"Reedum & Weep\".\n\nThe routine itself probably mirrored their stage act for the most part (they just threw in some references to \"Richard\"). I imagine that it would have been a real knee-slapper around 1920, but it must have been hopelessly out of date by 1947; judge for yourself. Note: Since I don't know which voice belongs to whom, I'll just label the parts \"R:\" and \"W:\".\n\n[music, followed by knocking]\n\nR: Open that door, Richard. [more knocking] Open that door, Richard.\n\nW: Stop making that noise. What does you want?\n\nR: I wanna see Richard.\n\nW: Now you better go someplace else; Richard ain't here.\n\nR: Well, he's gotta be here; this is where I left him. What's your name?\n\nW: Willis. [?]\n\nR: Well, have you seen Richard?\n\nW: Well, I thought I seen him 'cross the street yesterday and he thought he seen me, but when we got up close to each other, it wasn't neither one of us.\n\nR: You don't suppose he's got in jail, does you?\n\nW: I don't think so, 'less he was the Richard I saw in court this mornin'. They was 'vestigatin' a little fracas that happened last night.\n\nR: Well, did they find anything?\n\nW: Yeah, they fined him.\n\nR: Where did he go after that?\n\nW: I don' know where he went after. He don' live here.\n\nR: Well, I was here last night with Richard. I borrowed his suit.\n\nW: That suit don't belong to Richard. It belongs to me.\n\nR: That's what you say.\n\nW: Ah, you've been drinkin'. I smelled it on your breath.\n\nR: I been eatin' frogs' legs. What you smell is the hops.\n\nW: Yeah, well you better hop out c'here, man, because you is disturbed.\n\nR: You ain't very friendly. Seems like the only friend I have is my dog.\n\nW: Well, if that ain't enough, why don't you get some more dogs.\n\nR: Well, I thought I heard him breathin' in here, though.\n\nW: That was me. I breathes all the time. Look, I'm even breathin' now.\n\nR: Why?\n\nW: I dunno. Some kind of a habit I got into. I can't break myself.\n\nR: You was asleep when I was hollerin' \"open the door, Richard\".\n\nW: I was not. I was readin' and learnin'.\n\nR: Learnin' about what?\n\nW: About alligators.\n\nR: Alligators?\n\nW: Yeah, does you know how many eggs do a hen alligator lay from one settin'?\n\nR: A hen alligator?\n\nW: Mmm-hmm. You doesn't 'spec a rooster alligator to lay eggs, does you?\n\nR: And how many, how many eggs do a hen alligator lay?\n\nW: 4414.\n\nR: Some hen. 4414. Is the eggs round like a hen egg?\n\nW: Mmm-hmm. Does you know how many eggs do a rooster alligator eat?\n\nR: And is they pointed on one end and kinda round and flat on t'other?\n\nW: Mmm-hmm. Does you know how many eggs do a rooster alligator eat? [I get the feeling that the question was asked too soon the first time]\n\nR: How many does a rooster alligator eat?\n\nW: 4414.\n\nR: Who cares how many eggs a alligator lays or how many do he eat?\n\nW: Well, you better, else you gonna be up to your hips with alligators. C'mon, now, get out c'here. I got some more studyin' to do. [door slams; knocking]\n\nR: C'mon Richard, open that door.\n\nW: I tol' ya, my name ain't Richard.\n\n[guitar music; end of part 1]\n\n[part 2 starts with freight train noises]\n\nR: What you doin' at the depot? Lookin' for a job?\n\nW: Uh-uh. I'm gone up to see the governor.\n\nR: Er, whatcha gonna see him for?\n\nW: Well, I went to see the mayor, and he won't do nothin'. So I'm goin' up to see the governor.\n\nR: Well, he's a pretty busy man. Ever'body sees him. He don' hardly get no sleep.\n\nW: Well, neither does I. That's what I wants to see him 'bout.\n\nR: Well, he don' care about your business.\n\nW: Well, somebody's got to stop that man that keeps knockin' on my door and keeps hollerin' \"let me in, Richard\".\n\nR: Why don' you let him in?\n\nW: My name ain't Richard and the government knows it.\n\nR: How do he know that your name ain't Richard?\n\nW: Well, I was born.\n\nR: Then prove it.\n\nW: Well, the governor [indistinct] spoke to my doctor.\n\nR: Well, you better see his doctor.\n\nW: Ah, he's mad with me 'cause I ain't paid my bill.\n\nR: You ain't paid your bill since you was born?\n\nW: Ah, no, not my bein' born bill. This is from curin' me from suckin' my thumb.\n\nR: Well, did he cure ya?\n\nW: Hmm-hmm.\n\nR: Well, then, why won't you pay the man? How long you owed him?\n\nW: 'Bout 'leven years. I ain't in no hurry to pay him.\n\nR: What makes you that you ain't in no hurry to pay that doctor?\n\nW: Took him 20 years to cure me.\n\nR: You sucked your thumb for 20 years?\n\nW: Not all the time.\n\nR: I wanna look at that thumb.\n\nW: Yeah, take a good look there.\n\nR: Hmm-hmm.\n\nW: Almost white, ain't it?\n\nR: Well, if you're gonna see the governor, you better be gettin'.\n\nW: Hmm-hmm. I'm a little bit worried 'bout gettin' on that train, y'know.\n\nR: But I don't blame ya. A man tol' me that the last car was always gettin' smashed up.\n\nW: Well why don't they leave the last car off, then?\n\nR: Well, if they took the sleeper off, the diner would be the last car and that would be very bad.\n\nW: Hmm-hmm. You know about the best luck any man can have is to never be born.\n\nR: Yeah, but that don't very often happen to nobody.\n\nW: Y'know why I think you would see the governor?\n\nR: Hmm-hmm.\n\nW: He said tell that Mister Governor to tell the man that keeps knockin' and hollerin' \"open the door, Richard\" to g'wan and go someplace else and make that noise.\n\nR: Ah you can't talk to the governor like that.\n\nW: I don' think I want to ride on that train nohow. Ever' bone in my body aches.\n\nR: You oughta be glad you ain't a herring.\n\nW: I know.\n\nR: Well, if you wanna see the governor, you better be gettin'. [more train noises]\n\nW: Y'know, if they left the last car off, there would only be the engyne left and I knows I don't wanna ride on no engyne.\n\nR: Well, then, if you don't wanna ride on no engyne, how you gonna talk to the governor?\n\nW: I'll phone him.\n\nR: Thass a great idea. Phone the governor. [more train noises] 'Cause you done missed your train.\n\n[fades out with train noises]\n\nInterestingly, Milton Berle mentioned them, in a quite different context, in an article he wrote for the January 24, 1987 TV Guide:\n\nSteamer trunks stood flush against the wall [in cramped Vaudeville dressing rooms], one often piled on the other, because there was so little space. A class act had an H&M trunk. Manufactured by Charlie Mack of Moran and Mack, \"The Two Black Crows,\" the H&M trunk had room for shirts and blouses on one side. Suits and dresses could be hung from the high bar at the top of the other half. My mother bought me an H&M trunk when I was 15.\n\nJORDAN'S REFRAIN - ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PIE\n\nI've been calling the following lyrics \"Jordan's Refrain\":\n\n'Cause I'm standin' here scratchin' in my pants pocket\n\nAnd standin' here gropin' in my coat pocket\n\nAnd standin' here feelin' in my shirt pocket\n\nAnd I can't find the key.\n\nHowever, Jordan had changed them a bit; my 1947 Duchess sheet music actually says:\n\nI'm standing here digging in my hip pocket\n\nAnd I'm standin here scratchin in my pants pocket\n\nAnd I'm standing here gropin in my coat pocket\n\nAnd I just can't find that key.\n\n(Notice that they couldn't make up their minds whether it was \"standing\" or \"standin\".)\n\nAll the other acts that initially used them (the 3 Flames, Bill Osborne, the Pied Pipers, and the Merry Macs) took the lyrics directly from the sheet music. However, none of those acts had anywhere near the success and appeal of Louis Jordan, so I'll continue to call it \"Jordan's Refrain\". Several other versions used it (with variations, of course), so it can be considered a staple of the song.\n\nTHE EUROPEAN INTRO - WHAT IS IT?\n\nThis is what, for lack of a better term, I'll call the \"European Intro\":\n\nRaindrops down my collar\n\nStanding in the street\n\nRaindrops down my collar\n\nMisery in my feet\n\nI'd give my last dollar\n\nIf I could pick this lock\n\nListen to me holler\n\nListen to me knock\n\nI'll go out on a limb here and say that Dan Howell (Jack Kapp) wrote this. It doesn't have the \"feel\" of the rest of the musical lyrics; it sounds, to me, more like what a white lyricist would write. It's certainly not what a fall-down drunk would say at 4:00 in the morning. (Not only that, but nowhere in any of the songs does anyone say it's raining, so why does it mention \"raindrops down my collar\"? Note, though, that sheet music covers all seem to have a drawing of a man standing in the rain. That was probably more acceptable than someone being thrown out of a bar.)\n\nAlthough those words are in the original sheet music, the only American recording using them (although in highly-altered form) is the one by the Merry Macs. That's why I call it the European Intro. After MCA purchased both Leeds and Duchess in 1964, the words disappear from the sheet music..\n\nWE'RE IN THE MONEY - THE FEBRUARY UPROAR\n\nThe February 1, 1947 Pittsburgh Courier talked about the conflict over writer credit, as well as how much they didn't like Dusty Fletcher's recording:\n\nPigmeat Markham [another disciple of Bob Russell] is acting like a press agent for John Mason, who is out not only to keep 'Richard' from opening the door for Dusty, but throw him out altogether. Everybody is saying (that is, around here) that it's John's act and Dusty has no business in it. The statute of limitations will probably play the star role in the pending fight which will undoubtedly drag on for years. [It had already been settled by the time this blurb was printed.] The tune seems to be on its way to national fame, which makes us crazy 'cause we don't get it. It's degrading and typical of the Uncle Tom era when a Negro had to not only wear a bandana on his head but wave one with his voice to make his way on the stage. This type of buffoonery highlighted by the recording of \"Open The Door, Richard\" has no place in the modern world of entertainment and should not be accepted any more from a colored man than it is from a white. We can't win any battles against bigotry and misunderstanding in this manner because it gives those who are against us an excuse for the way in which they want to keep on treating us. So for many reasons we send this week's hosannas on to Fred Robbins, who refused to give the tune airing on his radio show.\n\nOn the other hand, the January 28, 1947 Afro-American said, \"Dusty is keen and sensitive about his race. At no time, has he ever attempted any routine that would degrade him. He is quick to point out that his acting the part of a drunk in the 'Open The Door, Richard' routine does not slur the race.\"\n\nAn article in the February 3, 1947 Iowa City Press-Citizen said that, by the end of January, sheet music sales had topped 100,000 and the estimate was for 500,000 eventually. The combined gross revenue for all the companies that had recorded the song to date was expected to come close to $2 million ($21,500,000 in 2016 dollars). It went on to say that:\n\nAs 'Open The Door, Richard' became popular and prosperous, the number of people claiming to have written it increased proportionately..... The Leeds Corp. leaped at the chance to copywright [sic] it and then narrowed the field of rival royalty claimants down to four: Dusty Fletcher, John Mason, Jack McVea, and Dan Howell. As the publishers tell it, this is Richard's history. Fletcher and Mason used the drunk and the locked door business for a vaudeville skit as far back as 20 years ago. But after being knocked around for two decades, the idea didn't come into big money until last December. At that time, West Coast Band Leader McVea thumped out the basic melody for the line 'Open The Door, Richard', and recorded it. Leeds stepped in with Dan Howell to round out the melody with a middle part and lyrics. For now, the royalty distribution stops there. Leeds figures four people squeezing through one money-lined door is enough.\n\nWell, aside from McVea's recording being off by a few months, a lot of that is correct. They're implying that McVea wrote the music and Dan Howell (David Kapp) wrote the words to the Vocal Refrain. We'll probably never know exactly what Howell/Kapp's contribution actually was.\n\nA headline in the February 3 Atchison [Kansas] Daily Globe proclaimed: \"News Story: Mr. Groundhog Trotted Out Of Hole Yesterday, Took One Look Around And Yelled 'Open The Door, Richard'\".\n\nThe February 5 Mansfield [Ohio] News-Journal said \"A controversy is now on as to who wrote the nutty number, 'Open The Door, Richard', which is reported to be 'sweeping the country', but guilt has not yet been established.\" Everyone's a critic.\n\nAlso on February 5, the ultimate version of \"Richard\" hit the airwaves, courtesy of Kay Kyser's \"Kollege Of Musical Knowledge\" radio show. That night the song was done, operatically, by Danish Metropolitan Opera tenor Lauritz Melchior. The following week, columnist Jay Kaye had this to say in the Waco [Texas] News-Tribune of February 12:\n\nThis to me, is one of the most ridiculous things that goes on around radio - not only on Mr. Melchior's part, but on the part of all classical singers who have a name and choose to run down that name by the kind of tripe that is fitting to those far less cultured, musically. [I guess that includes anyone reading my article.] Mr. Melchior's singing of \"Richard\" is comparable to an Alice Faye version of the Jewel Song from \"Faust\" and frankly, I can't see the point in it. Surely, Mr. Melchior doesn't need the cash and what other reason could drive him to do a number such as this? [Maybe he had a sense of humor, Jay?]\n\nWhat Jay possibly didn't know is that Melchior had also sung Slim Gaillard's \"Cement Mixer (Putti Putti)\" on a Frank Sinatra show the year before and, on February 2, had done \"Open Up Them Pearly Gates\" as a hillbilly number on the Fred Allen Show. On March 8, the Cincinnati Enquirer noted that there would be an opera broadcast that day: \"Lauritz Melchior (of 'Open The Door, Richard' fame) and Helen Traubel sing the roles of Sigmund and Brunhilde when Wagner's 'Die Walkyrie' is presented by the Metropolitan Opera.\" [That's more like it. Remember the old newspaper adage: \"I don't care what you say about me; just spell my name right.\"]\n\nActually, Melchior might have to share the \"Ultimate Version\" award. On February 12, on the Henry Morgan Show, \"Richard\" was done as an \"Italian opera\". It was sung by operatic tenor Charles Haywood (born Samuel Cibulsky in Grodno, Belarus), a professor of musicology at Queens College (New York), who specialized in singing popular songs in foreign languages for comic effect. (Jay Kaye is definitely unhappy at this point.) Considering that Arnold Stang was part of Morgan's cast and was probably in on the skit, this is another performance I'd really like to hear.\n\nOK, we've got a hit song, so why not get it scientifically analyzed? On February 7, 1947, a headline in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch blared: \"Richard's Door Is Opened - It's 'Perseveration' Says Psychologist\". [\"Perseveration\" is the pathological, persistent repetition of a word, gesture, or act, often associated with brain damage.] Dr. David P. Boder, a professor of psychology at Chicago's Illinois Institute Of Technology, said that the song was an expression of post-war readjustment. \"It's a mood nursed by a period of unsettled conditions.... The words of the song aren't the important thing. In fact, the repetition of the nonsensical lyrics gives people the chance to read into the song any meaning they wish [like you're doing, prof?], whether it be a complaint against the housing shortage, lack of automobiles or any problem they can do nothing about. .... Songs such as this one gain popularity in times when moods are weary and conditions are unsettled.\" And they wonder why we have trouble taking psychologists seriously.\n\nNot to be outdone, the following day the Brooklyn Daily Eagle found another Chicago psychologist to interview: Prof. Robert Seashore, head of the psychology department at Northwestern University. This headline said, \"Richard's Fans Have Cruel Streak\". \"Most people like to laugh at others' misfortunes.\" [Yes, it's called schadenfreude and helps to explain the popularity of the minions in the \"Despicable Me\" cartoons.] \"Richard's fans are likely to be frustrated, likely to be victims of inferiority complexes and may have a tendency to be revengeful.\" [I'm sure there's a term for the inflated self-worth that psychologists have. Remember, guys, as Freud said on many occasions: \"Manchmal ist ein Sketch Ã¼ber einen betrunkener nur ein Sketch Ã¼ber eine betrunkener\" (\"sometimes a skit about a drunk is just a skit about a drunk\").]\n\nOn February 8, Billboard talked about \"Open The Door, Richard\" shattering all records for the number of plugs on radio shows. However, unlike most records, the plugs weren't from the spinning of the various discs, but from gags inserted into shows. (In this case, \"plug\" meant any kind of mention, whether playing the records themselves or just using the catchphrase.)\n\nAnother February 8 article (Indiana Gazette) was of the absurd Press-Agent-Has-Nothing-Else-To-Fill-Up-His-Time variety. It concerned Richard, the largest Kodiak bear in captivity, who lived in the Audubon Park Zoo in New Orleans (he really existed). When attendants put food in his cage, they yell \"Open The Door, Richard\" and the bear does so. (Great story; shows you how much real news there was that day.)\n\nThe February 9 edition of the Jefferson City [Missouri] Sunday News And Tribune had this article (as did several other papers). It's so obvious a fabrication that I'll print the entire thing for amusement purposes:\n\nHAMILTON, ONT - Feb. 8 - Radio Announcer Paul Hanover, paraphrasing the song title \"Open The Door, Richard\", quipped \"Open The Winda, Linda\".\n\nShortly after the broadcast today Hanover received a phone call from Mrs. W. Smith who thanked him for saving her life and that of her daughter, Linda.\n\nMrs. Smith explained that she had been sleeping when Hanover urged Linda to open the \"winda\". The little girl ran to her mother's room and asked \"which window Mummie?\"\n\nThe query wakened Mrs. Smith who discovered that escaping gas had filled the apartment.\n\nThe week beginning February 14, John Mason appeared at the Paradise Theater in Detroit. \"In his original skit\", said the advertisement, \"Open The Door, Richard\". He was, the ad assured us, \"America's Most Talked About Star\", although it's probable that few white people had ever heard of him. Others on the bill were Dizzy Gillespie, Illinois Jacquet, and Erskine Hawkins. If you liked bands, this was the show for you.\n\nIt all became so newsworthy that the February 17, 1947 issue of Life Magazine, had a multi-page spread on Dusty Fletcher. You see him knocking, with the old lady, and then with Richard, who finally opened the door. (Dressed in a nightshirt and nightcap and holding a candle, he's played by Georgie Vann, of the Spirits Of Rhythm.)\n\nAn article in the February 18, 1947 Lead, South Dakota Daily Call was entitled \"Every Knock Is Boost For Dusty\". It's a long article in which Dusty gives his version of how the sketch came to be. It's nice that he's getting a lot of publicity after so many years in the theater, but, since it's mostly a bunch of flights of fancy, I won't dwell on it. He doesn't mention John Mason, so that puts its entire trustworthiness in doubt.\n\nSpeaking of John Mason, on February 21, he appeared at the Paradise Theater in Detroit. The February 15 Detroit Tribune had a piece about it (written by a press agent, of course). It's really an attempt to take ownership away from Dusty and transfer it to John.\n\n\"America's Greatest Comedian\", John Mason, will present his original skit \"Open The Door, Richard\" on stage at the Paradise theater, week starting Friday, Feb. 21. Also on stage will be Erskine Hawkins and his orchestra, plus an all-star stage revue. [Remember, \"all-star\" in passages like this, has no meaning whatever.]\n\nJohn Mason has presented \"Open The Door, Richard\" for the past 20 years throughout the United States and in Detroit at the Temple theater. Mamie Smith was on the same bill. He also showed it at the Koppin theater and Vaudet theater. Many of the old timers will remember the act. Ask your dad, mother or grandpa.\n\nMason was featured in many other Broadway productions, including \"Brown Buddy's\" [sic] starring Bill Robinson, Leslie's \"Blackbirds\", \"Born Happy\" and \"Deep Harlem\".\n\nIn the \"Open The Door, Richard\" skit, Richard WILL open [the] door. It will be a terrific ending. Be one of the first to see this great act starring John \"Open The Door, Richard\" Mason and company, week starting Friday, Feb. 21.\n\nBecause there were big bucks to be made, we got this: the February 22 Billboard reported that someone named Jack McRae, had had an Indianapolis concert on the 14th, billing himself as the \"originator and author\" of the song. Duchess Music immediately sought an injunction. I suppose he stopped; there's no further mention of him.\n\nHere's something I don't understand. Another phenomenon was \"knock-knock jokes\", which had really taken off in the mid-1930s. [If you've been hiding out all these years, this one, from 1934, shows the structure: \"Knock, knock\", \"Who's there?\", \"Rufus\", \"Rufus who?\", \"Rufus the most important part of your house.\" Everyone groan!] What I don't understand is why knock-knocks and Richard never made it to the same joke. (In truth, I'm sure that they did, on radio. It's just that no one ever bothered to write about it at the time.)\n\nOn February 16, 1947, the Detroit Free Press said: \"The National Association Of Door Manufacturers met here Saturday. Their theme song was 'Open The Door, Richard'.\" It should have been the National Door Manufacturers Association, but, whether or not it actually happened, some press agent figured out that it would make a cute story.\n\nRemember the Dusty Fletcher short film of \"Open The Door, Richard\" that I outlined near the beginning of this article? It was released to 42 New York City area Loew's theaters on February 24. It was also integrated into the Cab Calloway film, \"Hi-De-Ho\" (released in early May), although it was subsequently removed at some point and doesn't seem to be in any of today's copies.\n\n[Here's another Dusty Fletcher film that bears mentioning: \"Killer Diller\". Released around May 1948, it has wonderful performances by Andy Kirk's Orchestra, the King Cole Trio, Frankie Manning & 4 Congaroos, and the tap-dancing Clark Brothers. Dusty, in his usual down-and-out costume, plays a (sober) magician who's auditioning to be in a show. It turns out he can disappear and reappear at will. He explains this ability as follows: \"You see - enterin' the room without comin' through the door - that's just a sample of my abilities. I developed that trick because I had difficulties in gettin' someone to open the door. Say, your name ain't Richard, is it?\" At one point, frustrated because a trick isn't working, he says, \"I ain't never had no luck with doors nohow\". At the end of the film, he needs to get his suitcase so that he can go off and marry Butterfly McQueen. Unfortunately, the door is locked and he ends up pounding on it and yelling \"Open The Door, Richard\". (At this point, it would no longer be amusing to have him teleport himself inside.) He, and the four \"Keystone Kops\" that chase him throughout the film, are actually quite funny. Note that the short \"sergeant\" is played by Freddie Robinson, of the comedy team of Freddie & Flo\".]\n\nThe February 28, Franklin (Pennsylvania) News-Herald had one of those absurd phony press agent blurbs that I love: \"The powder room at Rogers' Corner now has an illuminated sign on its entrance flashing the following warning: 'D"
