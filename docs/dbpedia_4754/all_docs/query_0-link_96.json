        "text": "Indiana Quick Quiz\n\nHow well do you know the movie HOOSIERS?\n\n1. The name of the fictional Indiana town is a/ Hickory b/ Hillsdale d/ Henderson d/ Highland\n\n2. The new coach is a/ Coach Donovan b/ Coach Downey c/ Coach Dale d/ Coach Don\n\n3. The player who makes the winning shot in the final game is a/ Johnny b/ Jimmy c/ Jersey d/ Jonesy\n\nAnswers Below\n\n1860 Henry Lane (left) and Thomas Hendricks, both running for Governor, had a debate in Kokomo. Lane went on to win the election. He served as Governor for only two days before being elected to the United States Senate. The Lieutenant Governor, Oliver P. Morton, became Governor. Hendricks, who had earlier been in Congress, won a United States Senate seat in 1862. He served a term as Indiana Governor from 1873 - 1877. In 1884, he was elected Vice President of the United States.\n\n1902 Howard Hawks was born in Goshen, Indiana. He moved with his family to California just as the motion picture industry was coming into its own. Beginning in silent films, he became known as a versatile director who was comfortable with all types of movies, from comedies to dramas to gangster films and westerns. Some of his most memorable work includes Red River, Sergeant York, Big Sky, and Gentlemen Prefer Blonds.\n\nHoosier Quote of the Week\n\n\"They're moving pictures. Let's make 'em move!\" - - - Howard Hawks (1896-1977)\n\nWith 47 films to his credit, Howard Hawks was one of the most respected directors in Hollywood.\n\nDid You Know? Hollywood is a long way from Indiana, but an impressive number of Hoosiers have found their way to California to establish careers as movie directors. In addition to Howard Hawks, the list includes Sydney Pollack, from Lafayette, whose hits include Out of Africa, Tootsie, and The Way We Were. Ray Enright, from Anderson, was a very busy director in the 1930s, turning out a score of movies, including China Clipper, Alibi Ike, and Golden Dawn. One of the biggest names on the silver screen was Robert Wise, from Winchester. His filmography practically defines the golden era of movies. His credits include The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Sand Pebbles, West Side Story, and The Sound of Music. Perhaps the director most near and dear to the hearts of Indiana basketball fans is David Anspaugh, from Decatur. He has done a lot of work in television, including Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice. On the big screen, he won awards in 1993 for Rudy. But it was the picture he filmed in the small towns of Indiana in 1986 that will forever enshrine him in the Indiana Movie Hall of Fame. That was, of course, Hoosiers, which so well captures the spirit of high school basketball in Indiana.\n\n1902 The English Opera House in Indianapolis was packed as the audience was treated to readings by Hoosier authors. The purpose of the event, introduced by United States Senator Charles Fairbanks, was to raise funds to build a statue of President Benjamin Harrison, who had died the year before. The program included Lew Wallace (Ben Hur,) Charles Major (Bears of Blue River,) George Barr McCutcheon (Brewster's Millions) and James Whitcomb Riley (Out to Old Aunt Mary's)\n\n1922 Lillian Gay Berry (left) and Juliette Maxwell became the first women to be named full professors at Indiana University. Berry taught Latin for 40 years at the school and was a noted classical scholar. Maxwell, on the faculty for 35 years, served as Director of the Department of Physical Training for Women.\n\n1942 The first official order was issued from the new Camp Atterbury Training Center near Edinburgh. The facility was named for General William Wallace Atterbury from New Albany, Indiana. He had served as a staff member to General John G. Pershing in World War I.\n\n1961 As Speedway drivers prepared to start the Indianapolis 500 Mile race, Ray Harroun, the first Indy 500 winner, drove around the track on the 50th anniversary of his victory. He was behind the wheel of the original yellow-and-black Marmon \"Wasp\" which had taken the checkered flag in 1911 at an average speed of 74.6 mph.\n\nABE MARTIN SEZ:\n\nIt don't make no difference how well you kin write if you kin just think of a catchy title.\n\n(Kin Hubbard, The Indianapolis News, June 3, 1924)\n\nANSWERS: 1. a/ Hickory 2. c/ Coach Dale 3. b/ Jimmy\n\nYou are invited to take a \"Virtual Tour\" of the Indiana Statehouse.
