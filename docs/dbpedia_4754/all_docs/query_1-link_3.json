        "text": "''I HAD A FARM IN AFRICA, AT THE foot of the Ngong Hills'' - that famous opening sentence of Isak Dinesen's ''Out of Africa'' has daunted some of the most enterprising of modern film makers. Orson Welles, who made an hourlong film of Dinesen's ''The Immortal Story,'' never realized his hopes of adapting her classic African memoir. Nor did David Lean's thoughts of filming the book ever materialize. In the early 1970's, Nicolas Roeg thought of directing a film with Julie Christie as the Danish-born author and Ryan O'Neal as the Swedish Baron whom she married. But if the book, which Dinesen's biographer Judith Thurman has called ''a landscape from the air,'' has a keen sense of character and place that have made it alluring from the film maker's standpoint, it also has an uneventfulness that has kept it well out of reach. So it eluded them all.\n\nThe man who finally filmed ''Out of Africa,'' as a $30 million Christmas movie opening Dec. 18, is at first glance an unlikely aspirant. Sydney Pollack is best known for big-name Hollywood romances (like ''The Way We Were'') and, most recently, for a comedy (''Tootsie'') about a man in a dress. Born in Indiana, he had never been to Africa before beginning work on the Dinesen movie in 1983. Though he has directed films based on novels, he had no major experience with literary adaptation. Nor had Pollack ever at-tempted anything this physically taxing or complicated. ''Out of Africa,'' which he also produced, is a sweeping costume drama made in Africa with intricate sets, imported lions (flown in specially from California) and thousands of extras, some equipped with special $15-a-pair drooping latex ears.\n\nBut Pollack may have been uniquely well-equipped to convey the material's innate contradictions. The memoir's rarefied, controlled tone - in contrast with the author's more passionate letters covering the same period in her life - masks exactly the kinds of ambivalence, regret and longing to which Pollack has always been drawn. In the words of his close friend, Robert Redford, whose appearance with Meryl Streep in ''Out of Africa'' is his sixth starring role in a Pollack film, ''Sydney sees both sides of everything, he really does. If he's committed to anything, it's to a center line. He lives in the gray zone.''\n\nEven physically, the 51-year-old Pollack combines seemingly incompatible qualities. If it is his Hollywood habit to appear almost anywhere, even in the poshest Manhattan hotels, wearing blue jeans, then it is his polite Indiana instinct to make sure the jeans are neatly pressed. He jogs and follows the Pritikin diet while shooting his films, and the rest of the time has a hobby of cooking. (''But as you're eating, he'll lift up the plate and clear off the crumbs,'' Redford recalls.) He is tall, articulate and an enthusiastic talker. (''He's a manager and a teacher, and when he talks, he likes to lecture,'' Redford says.) He is also an inveterate worrier. ''But I had faith in him,'' Meryl Streep says. ''The director who tells you everything is fine is the one you're not happy being in the hands of. Sydney worried so much that I knew he'd tie up the loose ends.'' POLLACK'S WORRYING IS PART OF A larger attraction to unresolvable problems, and to the sorts of stories that give his work its unobtrusive consistency. Despite his broadly commercial instincts and penchant for all-star casts, he also has a constitutional inability to film happy endings. He favors intelligent, articulate characters who simply cannot get along. Even ''Tootsie,'' his biggest hit, ends on a note that, although optimistic, is also uncertain. ''I don't know whether they get together, but at least I didn't leave them apart,'' he says, although in other films, like ''Absence of Malice'' and ''Three Days of the Condor,'' he has done just that. ''What happens with me is that I get interested in a film as an argument between two points of view, so that the picture becomes a way of giving both sides equal weight. And sometimes I wind up digging a ditch between the two people that's so wide it seems false to try to reconcile them. Besides, I sense something that's true or satisfying in the separation.''\n\n''There's a melancholia that hangs heavy over his stuff, but there's also an eye to the commercial,'' says Redford. That places Pollack squarely between mainstream and art-house sensibilities. His visual style has grown less obtrusive over the years, and his favorite things in his own films - like the cut in ''Tootsie'' from Dustin Hoffman's first having the thought of masquerading as a woman to the sight of him walking down the street in drag, a jump accomplished without explanation or transition - are often the things that aren't there. So his work has no obvious directorial signature, which Redford says is something of a sore point. Indeed, Pollack sometimes speaks wistfully of ''the French,'' who recognize him as a much more distinctive auteur.\n\nPollack does see distinct patterns in his own work. He can muse convincingly about the similarities between his ''Out of Africa'' heroine and Katie Morosky, the Depression-era character played by Barbra Streisand in ''The Way We Were.'' (''Now this is an elegant, aristocratic woman as opposed to Katie, who is kind of a mad, radical peasant in a way - but they're both women who want something so much and have to deal with the quiet, sad fact that it won't work and get on with their lives.'') Or he can see Denys Finch Hatton, whom Redford plays in the new film, as sharing a certain key quality with both Hubbell Gardiner of ''The Way We Were'' and the lone woodsman in ''Jeremiah Johnson.'' (''He's a man who does not engage, but he doesn't do it out of fear, he does it out of real choice.'') And so for Pollack, ''Out of Africa'' took shape as a film about love and possessiveness, preservation and progress, the irreconcilability of differences between lovers, and typically and finally, about loss.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
