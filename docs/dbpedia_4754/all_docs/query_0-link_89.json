        "text": "Even after he was a well-established, Oscar-winning Hollywood director and producer, he would pop up out of the blue in films by colleagues and friends. Only last year he played George Clooney's morally ambivalent boss in the excellent legal thriller Michael Clayton, which Pollack also produced. And he appears as Patrick Dempsey's much-married father in the recently released comedy, Maid of Honor.\n\nIn fact, Pollack might well have stuck with the acting if it hadn't been for Hollywood legend Burt Lancaster...\n\nBorn to first generation Russian parents in Lafayette, Indiana, on July 1, 1934, Sydney Irwin Pollack was raised in South Bend and developed an enduring love of drama at the local high school. So much so that when he left school he took the unusual step of ignoring college and heading straight for the Neighborhood Playhouse theatre school in New York.\n\nHe studied there for two years under Sanford Meisner, and subsequently spent another five years working as Meisner's assistant. It would be hard to think of a better way of finding out how actors think.\n\nCurly-haired, over six feet tall and of striking rather than handsome appearance, Pollack began getting decent parts on the Broadway stage in the late 1950s, before turning more to TV acting.\n\nHe secured a reasonably big role in John Frankenheimer's TV production of For Whom The Bell Tolls in 1959, and when Frankenheimer moved to Hollywood he asked Pollack to join him as a voice coach on his 1961 feature, The Young Savages. Among the cast was Burt Lancaster, and he and Pollack instantly hit it off. And it was Lancaster who told Pollack he had the instincts of a film director, and should pursue it.\n\nWhile he learnt his trade directing half-hour TV dramas like Dr Kildare (thanks initially to Lancaster's contacts), Sydney kept up the acting, and in 1962 he appeared in a film called War Hunt alongside a handsome Californian who was to become a lifelong friend. Robert Redford was then an unknown young player, but he and Pollack would go on to make six pictures together.\n\nPollack made his first feature film, The Slender Thread, in 1965. A tense drama in which Sidney Poitier's social worker tried to keep a suicidal Anne Bancroft talking on the phone until help could reach her, the film was competently made and fairly zipped along.\n\nMore movie work followed. His first collaboration with Redford was This Property is Condemned, in 1966, a handsome if slow-moving film based on a short play by Tennessee Williams. Burt Lancaster threw more work Pollack's way in 1968 when he asked that he be allowed to direct segments of his experimental film The Swimmer.\n\nBut Pollack attracted far more attention with his next film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They? A moody melodrama based around a Depression-era marathon dance competition, the film has not dated well, but its strong emotional content and ensemble acting made it a surprise box office hit.\n\nPollack also managed to coax a fine performance out of Jane Fonda, earning her more serious roles and him a reputation as a master handler of difficult stars.\n\nHis working relationship with Robert Redford blossomed in the 1970s, and as the actor's star rose so did Pollack's. After the underrated and beautifully made ecological western Jeremiah Johnson, in 1972, the two scored a huge hit a year later with the romantic weepie, The Way We Were. The story of an ill-fated 1950s romance between Redford's arrogant, WASP-ish man and Barbra Streisand's nice Jewish girl, it was pretty unsubtle stuff, but box-office wise it was on the money. Pollack and Redford used their increased clout to make the brilliant conspiracy thriller Three Days of the Condor, in 1975. And Pollack won his first and only Best Film Oscar with their next collaboration, Out of Africa (1985).\n\nIn many ways, Out of Africa perfectly illustrates Pollack's strengths and weaknesses as a director. Beautifully shot and flawlessly told, the film suffered nevertheless from a kind of emotional and visual blandness that prevented it from reaching beyond the merely superficial. Pollack freely admitted to not having any particularly distinctive or original visual style, and as a director he felt he was a traditionalist. \"I think my films are conventional in form,\" he once said, \"but not necessarily in point of view\".\n\nBut through the '80s and '90s he grew to specialise in making solid and undemanding Hollywood fare -- The Firm (1993), Random Hearts (1999), and a dodgy remake of Sabrina (1995).\n\nIf that last film was a failed comedy, his only other foray into that genre was an unqualified success. Though he later claimed he hated every second he spent making it, the 1982 comedy Tootsie was a huge hit, and personally earned Pollack up to $20m. He found the mercurial Dustin Hoffman extremely difficult to work with, and the two spent most of the time fighting. But Hoffman also persuaded Pollack to resume acting after a 20-year break, playing a cynical agent.\n\nPollack was an exceptionally skilful character actor, and flexed his thespian muscles more frequently in later life, most notably in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1994). He was absolutely outstanding in that film as a married man going through a midlife crisis, but in real life nothing could be further from the truth. He was happily married for 50 years to Claire Griswold, with whom he had three children.\n\nIn recent years Pollack devoted most of his energies to producing, collaborating with George Clooney and the late Anthony Minghella. And of all the tributes that flowed in after his death, Clooney's was among the most affecting. \"Sydney made the world a little better, movies a little better and even dinner a little better,\" the actor said. \"A tip of the hat to a class act.\"\n\npwhitington@independent.ie"
