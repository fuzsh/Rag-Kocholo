        "text": "Outside of France, little critical writing exists on the work of Hollywood director Sydney Pollack. Yet Pollack's work reveals a compelling, personal vision and a distinctive visual style. Within the space of nine years he has created a body of work which bears his individual stamp and which demonstrates a consistent, though constantly developing, philosophic stance. With the release of three days of the condor, Pollack's ninth Hollywood feature, it seems appropriate to reassess his past creative achievement.\n\nPollack was born in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1934 and grew up in South Bend, where his father practiced pharmacy. He first became interested in theater in high school, and at seventeen he took off for New York, where he enrolled in Sanford Meisner\"s Neighborhood Playhouse. Pollack studied under Meisner (whom he credits for influencing his work as both actor and director) from 1952 to 1954, and then served as Meisner's assistant until 1960.\n\nWhile teaching at the Neighborhood Playhouse, Pollack also acted in several Broadway productions and did a heavy load of television work. Among Pollack's plays were Harold Robbins' A Stone For Danny Fish'er and Christopher Fry's The Dark is Light Enough. After a two year stint in the U.S. Army, Pollack accepted a job in Hollywood as dialogue coach for John Frankenheimer on the young savages. The film featured Burt Lancaster and Shelley Winters, two starts whom Pollack would later cast in his own work. Encouraged by Lancaster, Pollack stayed in Hollywood, landing an acting job in Denis Sanders' low-budget war hunt (1962). Also appearing in his first film was a young actor named Robert Redford. Although both men subsequently chose separate professional paths, the two have remained close personal friends and have joined forces on several projects. Redford has starred in four Pollack films: this property is CONDEMNED, JEREMIAH JOHNSON, THE WAY WE WERE, and THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR.\n\nFollowing war hunt, Pollack continued acting and directing for television. To his credit are episodes of The Naked City, The Defenders, and Chrysler Theater. Along the way he picked up an Emmy for a special with Kim Stanley. In 1966 Pollack was given an opportunity to direct his first film, THE SLENDER THREAD.\n\nAs a group, Pollack's films are informed by a pervasive skepticism..."
