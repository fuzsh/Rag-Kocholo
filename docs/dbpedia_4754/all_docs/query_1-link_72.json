A very fine musical programme had been arranged and the vocal selections were rendered tenderly and feelingly.

Salmon. Mrs. Salmon had not been ill a great while. Hers was a complication of diseases but inflammation of the stomach and bowels seemed to be the most serious difficulty. Dr. Britts was the attending physician and faithfully performed his duties. Dr. John Kimbrough of St. Louis was in attendance at his sister's bedside during the last days of her illness. Mrs. Salmon was a daughter of Uncle Johnny Kimbrough and was born in Springfield, Mo. in 1850, making her 44 years of age. She came with her parents to Clinton in the fall of 1869 and was educated at Christian College in Columbia. She has been a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church for 25 years. In 1871, Uncle Johnny Kimbrough gave his daughter, Kate in marriage to Harvey W. Salmon and their married life has been spent in congenial happiness. Five children, four boys and one girl, made merry music in their home until death chilled the heart of one baby boy, a remarkably bright little fellow. At her death, Mrs. Salmon's oldest child, Harvey, Jr., was 21 and he will miss his gentle mother sadly. Merritt, Louise and Warren are too young to fully realize their loss but as they grow older they will know that the dearest, best thing in the world has been denied them - the tender love and watchful care of a Christian mother. To Mr. Salmon, her loss is irreparable. Also three sisters and four brothers are deeply grieved over the loss of what to them was a second mother. And, in tenderest pity, we speak of what her loss is to her aged father. Seventy-five years have come and gone since he entered this life and it seemed that, in his feeble old age, he would be the first to return to the life from whence he came. He had grown to depend on her for the brightness and sunshine of his old age. Funeral services were held at the elegant home of the deceased on East Green Street.\n\nSALMON, Milburn Tutt\n\n1884-1896\n\nEnglewood Cemetery (S), Clinton, Henry Co, MO\n\nClinton MO, Nov 7 1896 - Fatal Accident at Republican Rally - A sad, sad incident of the Republican demonstration last Saturday was the fatal accident to Master Milburn Salmon, whose neck was broken by the crash of the speaker's stand at the arbor, at night, occurring just as Mr. Lewis had made a short address. It seems that the little fellow and several companions were caught in the jam and were evidently trying to get out by crawling under the timbers, when the crash came, catching his neck on a crossbeam and breaking it. He was found sometime after and taken to Jackson's undertaking, where he was recognized as the son of E. W. Salmon, lately of Marshfield, and the sad news was communicated to grief-stricken relatives. His remains were interred at Englewood on Sunday. Milburn would have been 12 in a few days and, with his 7 year old sister, made his home with their grandmother, Mrs. W. W. Salmon on East Green. Their mother died some three years ago.

As the shades of eve were drawing to a close last Sabbath, after three weeks illness, Will H. Salmon breathed his last, and the once happy home now mourns the loss of one whose bright smiles never failed to win loving friends. He was just merging into his 24th year and if his life, so full of hope, could have been spared, our society and business relations would be better by having such a noble young man among us. For two years he had been connected with the bank of Salmon and during that time, Mayor Carter, who had stood beside him, says he never saw a more gentle and willing disposition to do what was right than Will H. Salmon possessed.
