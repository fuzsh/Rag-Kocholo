        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Sydney Pollack, the Academy Awardwinning director of Out of Africa who achieved acclaim making popular, mainstream movies with A-list stars, including The Way We Were and Tootsie, died Monday. He was 73.\n\nPollack, who also was a producer and actor, died of cancer at his home in the Pacific Palisades district of the city, according to Leslee Dart, his publicist and friend.\n\n\"Sydney Pollack has made some of the most influential and best-remembered films of the last three decades,\" film scholar Jeanine Basinger told the Los Angeles Times recently.\n\nIn looking at Pollack's films, she said, \"what you see is how he kept in step with the times. He doesn't get locked into one decade and left there. He hada very sharp political sensibility and a keen sense of whatthe issues of his world were, and he advanced and changed as the times advanced and changed.\"\n\nAfter launching his showbusiness career as an actor and acting teacher in New York City inthe 1950s, Pollack moved west in the early '60s and began directing episodic television before turning to films.\n\nBeginning with The Slender Thread, a 1965 drama starring Sidney Poitier and Anne Bancroft, Pollack was credited with directing 20 films, including They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, a 1969 drama about Depression-era marathon dancers starring Jane Fonda that earned Pollack an Oscar nomination for best director.\n\nKnown for what New York Times film critic Janet Maslin once described as \"his broadly commercial instincts and penchant for all-star casts,\" Pollack directed seven movies with Robert Redford, beginning with This Property Is Condemned (with Natalie Wood) in 1966.\n\nThe Pollack-Redford collaboration also produced The Way We Were (with Barbra Streisand), Jeremiah Johnson, Three Days of the Condor (with Faye Dunaway), The Electric Horseman (with Fonda), Out of Africa (with Meryl Streep) and Havana.\n\nOut of Africa, the 1985 drama based on Danish author Isak Dinesen's experiences in Kenya during the early part of the 20th century and her romance with English big-game hunter-adventurer Denys Finch Hatton, earned Pollack two Academy Awards: as director and as producer of the film, which won the best picture Oscar.\n\nPollack also received a best director Oscar nomination - and a New York Film Critics Circle Award -- for Tootsie.\n\nThe son of a pharmacist, Pollack was born July 1, 1934, in Lafayette, Ind., and later moved with his family to South Bend.\n\n\"I think of it with great sadness,\" he said of his experiences in South Bend in a 1993 interview with The New York Times. \"It was a real cultural desert. There weren't many Jews like us, and it was real anti-Semitic.\"\n\nHis parents divorced while he was growing up, and his mother, who \"had emotional problems and became an alcoholic,\" died when Pollack was 16. Although his father envisioned him becoming a dentist, Pollack left home after graduating from high school and moved to New York to become an actor.\n\nIn 1966, he won an Emmy for his direction of \"The Game,\" an episode of Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre.\n\nHe married his wife, Claire, in 1958 and had three children, Rebecca, Rachel and Steven. Steven died in a plane crash in 1993. Pollack is also survived by six grandchildren and a brother, Bernie, a Hollywood costume designer."
