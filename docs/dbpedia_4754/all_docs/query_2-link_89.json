        "text": "US film director and producer Sydney Pollack has died of cancer, aged 73.\n\nHe won producing and directing Oscars for the epic romance Out of Africa, starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep, in 1985.\n\nHe also directed Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, plus The Way We Were, in which Redford partnered Barbra Streisand.\n\nHe died on Monday, surrounded by family members, at his home in Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles. He had been diagnosed with cancer 10 months ago.\n\n\"Sydney made the world a little better, movies a little better and even dinner a little better,\" said George Clooney, on whose latest film, Leatherheads, Pollack was executive producer.\n\n\"A tip of the hat to a class act. He'll be missed terribly.\"\n\nDIRECTORIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\n1993 - The Firm\n\n1985 - Out of Africa\n\n1982 - Tootsie\n\n1973 - The Way We Were\n\n1969 - They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\n\nActress Sally Field, who was directed by Pollack in Absence of Malice, also paid tribute.\n\n\"Having the opportunity to know Sydney and work with him was a great gift in my life,\" Field said in a statement.\n\n\"He was a good friend and a phenomenal director and I will cherish every moment that I ever spent with him.\"\n\nBorn in Indiana on 1 July 1934, Pollack started out as an actor, although he was best remembered as a director.\n\nHe developed a love of drama and opted to enrol at drama school in New York - where he studied for two years under Sanford Meisner - rather than going to college.\n\nHe continued performing throughout his career, appearing in his last film, Made of Honor, opposite Patrick Dempsey earlier this year.\n\nFrom the start, Pollack's career was identified with the big names and big studios of Hollywood.\n\nThe Slender Thread, his first feature film, starring Sidney Poitier and Anne Bancroft, was released by Paramount Pictures in 1965.\n\nMusic producer Quincy Jones, who scored that movie, said: \"Sydney Pollack's immense talents as a director were only surpassed by the compassion that he carried in his soul for his fellow man.\"\n\nIn later years, Pollack collaborated with the likes of Burt Lancaster, Jane Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Al Pacino, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford and Nicole Kidman.\n\nHe compared the Hollywood greats to working with thoroughbred horses, saying they were temperamental and he sometimes got thrown - but when they performed, the experience was thrilling.\n\nBut critics said as well as working with crowd-drawing stars, he also produced passionate and intelligent films which respected their audiences.\n\nPollack worked with Hollywood's leading stars for four decades\n\n\"Called the quintessential 'actor's director', Sydney let the dialogue and the emotion of a scene speak for itself,\" said Michael Apted, president of the Directors Guild of America.\n\n\"Not given to cinematic tricks, his gentle and thoughtful touch and his focus on the story let us inhabit the world he created in each film.\"\n\nLater in his career Pollack teamed up with British film-maker Anthony Minghella, who died in March, at production company Mirage Enterprises, to become a prolific producer of independent films.\n\nTheir releases included Cold Mountain and Sketches of Frank Gehry, a 2007 documentary which was the last film Pollack directed."
