        "text": "Michael Jacksonâs Journey from Motown to âOff the Wall leads the list of high profile films screening at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Created by director Spike Lee, the documentary details Michael Jacksonâs rise from child sensation to international pop star, revisiting his storied family life and career long partnership with Quincy Jones. The Michael Jackson film is one of 122 feature-length films and 72 short films that have been selected to screen at Sundance from the 12,793 films that applied from around the world.\n\nThe 2016 Sundance Film Festival runs January 21 through 31 and includes world premiere films, filmmaker panels, celebrity-filled parties, late night rock concerts, and film fans from around the world. For the second year in a row, the festival has been pushed back a week so Park City can enjoy the skiing revenue from the Martin Luther King holiday weekend.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival was started in 1978 as the Utah/US Film Festival in Salt Lake City to attract more filmmakers to Utah and highlight American independent film. Inaugural chairman Robert Redford helped attract major films like Mean Streets, Deliverance, and Midnight Cowboy the first year. In 1981, Redfordâs friend Sydney Pollack suggested moving the festival to Park City in January to attract more Hollywood brass. The Sundance Institute officially took over with the 1985 festival and has run it for the 30 years since.\n\nAs the first US festival in the calendar year, Sundance serves as the unofficial kick-off of the film festival season. More movie deals are made, careers launched and stars born at Sundance than any other US festival. Oscar winner and four-time nominee Jennifer Lawrence was discovered in the Sundance film Winterâs Bone. And, writer/director Ryan Coogler was given the green light for Creed only after he won Best Dramatic Feature at Sundance for his film, Fruitvale Station.\n\nFor the sixth year, I am travelling to Sundance with deadCENTERâs Director of Programming, Kim Haywood. We watch 4-5 films each day, meet with filmmakers, check out emerging festival technologies, and promote deadCENTER to all of the filmmakers so they will bring their films to Oklahoma. We also work with the Oklahoma Film and Music Office to promote Oklahoma as a destination for producing films.\n\nSeveral of the biggest films to play at deadCENTER over the past few years applied because they met our team at Sundance, including Best of Enemies, The Overnight, The Trip to Italy, The Kings of Summer, and The Queen of Versailles. Even the Oscar nominated animated film Shaun the Sheep applied and played at deadCENTER because we began a relationship with the distributor at Sundance. Sundance films help bring bigger crowds, national press, and more attention to the world premieres and Oklahoma films that make our deadCENTER program so unique.\n\nIn addition to the Michael Jackson documentary, there are several celebrity driven dramas and highly anticipated films about Norman Lear, Maya Angelou, Mike Nichols, and Robert Mapplethorpe that should make this another fantastic year at Sundance. Weâll give you all the details next week from the slopes."
