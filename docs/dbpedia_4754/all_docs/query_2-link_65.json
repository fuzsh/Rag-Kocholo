        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Academy Award-winning director Sydney Pollack, a Hollywood mainstay who achieved commercial success and critical acclaim with the gender-bending comedy \"Tootsie\" and the period drama \"Out of Africa,\" has died. He was 73.\n\nPollack died of cancer yesterday afternoon at his home in Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles, surrounded by family, said agent Leslee Dart. He had been diagnosed with cancer about nine months ago, said Dart.\n\nPollack, who occasionally appeared on the screen himself, worked with and gained the respect of Hollywood's best actors in a long career that reached prominence in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nLast fall, he played Marty Bach opposite George Clooney in \"Michael Clayton,\" which Pollack also co-produced. The film received seven Oscar nominations, including best picture and a best actor nod for Clooney.\n\nPollack's last screen appearance was in \"Made of Honor,\" a romantic comedy now in theaters, where he played the oft-married father of star Patrick Dempsey's character.\n\nIn recent years, Pollack produced many independent films with filmmaker Anthony Minghella and a production company Mirage Enterprises.\n\nThe Lafayette, Ind. native was born to first-generation Russian-Americans.\n\nIn high school, he fell in love with theater, a passion that prompted him to forego college and move to New York and enroll in the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater.\n\nStudying under Sanford Meisner, Pollack spent several years cutting his teeth in various areas of theater, eventually becoming Meisner's assistant.\n\nAfter appearing in a handful of Broadway productions in the 1950s, Pollack turned his eye to directing.\n\nPollack is survived by his wife, Claire; two daughters, Rebecca and Rachel; his brother Bernie; and six grandchildren. *"
