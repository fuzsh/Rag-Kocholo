        "text": "Frank Perry (born August 21, 1930, New York City, New York, U.S.—died August 29, 1995, Manhattan, New York) was an American director of wide-ranging films who was best known for David and Lisa (1962), Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970), and Mommie Dearest (1981).\n\nPerry worked as a stage manager and producer before moving into television and film. He studied directing under Lee Strasberg and applied what he had learned in his first feature, the low-budget David and Lisa (1962), an independently made film about two mentally ill teenagers (played by Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin) who develop an emotional connection while in a home for disturbed youths. The sensitive drama was written by Perry’s wife, Eleanor, who dramatized a case history from a book by Theodore Isaac Rubin. A surprise box-office success, the film also received critical acclaim, and Perry earned an Academy Award nomination for best director.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nPerry’s next films, which also featured scripts by Eleanor, were less successful. The fact-based Ladybug, Ladybug (1963) was a rather heavy-handed drama about a group of rural children who seek shelter after an air-raid siren is accidentally sounded, and the existential allegory The Swimmer (1968) starred Burt Lancaster as an ad man who confronts his past while swimming from pool to pool in a wealthy Connecticut town. The latter film was ably adapted from a story by John Cheever, but The Swimmer had little box-office success. Last Summer (1969) was a provocative adaptation of Evan Hunter’s coming-of-age novel about three teenagers (Richard Thomas, Bruce Davison, and Barbara Hershey) who aimlessly drink and engage in sexual experimentation, but things take a cruel and violent turn when a shy, vulnerable girl (Catherine Burns) joins their group.\n\nPerry’s greatest success may have been Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970), a chilling black comedy (adapted by Eleanor from the novel by Sue Kaufman) about the inexorable descent of a suburban mother (the Oscar-nominated Carrie Snodgress) whose self-centred husband (Richard Benjamin) and ungrateful children drive her into the arms of a self-involved writer (Frank Langella). The film was the last collaboration between the Perrys, who separated that year (divorced 1971). Perry next directed “Doc” (1971), a debunking of the Wyatt Earp–Doc Holliday legend. The western, which was written by Pete Hamill, starred Stacy Keach, Harris Yulin, and Faye Dunaway. Next was Play It As It Lays (1972), an adaptation of a novel by Joan Didion, who cowrote the script with her husband, John Gregory Dunne. The dramedy featured Tuesday Weld as an actress who suffers a nervous breakdown after a series of traumatic incidents, including the suicide of her close friend (Anthony Perkins).\n\nAfter the muddled thriller Man on a Swing (1974), Perry directed Rancho Deluxe (1975), which was scripted by Thomas McGuane. The offbeat contemporary western centres on two cattle rustlers (Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston) who set their sights on a wealthy rancher (Clifton James). Perry, who occasionally worked in television, then made Dummy (1979), an acclaimed TV drama that dealt with the true case of a handicapped young black man (LeVar Burton) who is defended on a murder charge by a court-appointed attorney (Paul Sorvino). It received a Peabody Award."
