        "text": "The film-maker Sydney Pollack, who has died of cancer aged 73, entered Hollywood as dialogue director on John Frankenheimer's The Young Stranger. He was just 25, and within a few years was on course to be one of the most influential players in the history of Tinseltown, as a prolific producer, an Oscar-winning director and as actor in many of his own movies, alongside those by Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Stanley Kubrick.\n\nHis biggest success was Tootsie (1982), which earned him a reputed $14m (Â£7m) within a year of its release. He later told fellow director John Boorman that he would return every cent, \"If I could get back the 18 months of my life spent making it, which were total misery.\" By then he was an integral part of Hollywood's fabric, working with the elite of his profession, fine technicians and popular actors, notably Robert Redford on seven occasions.\n\nAs producer, he moved from control of his own films to numerous projects. including The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), The Talented Mr Ripley (1999), The Quiet American (2002), Cold Mountain (2003) and Michael Clayton (2007).\n\nPollack became the prime example of producer as director, with an extraordinary talent for choosing sympathetic collaborators (with the notable exception of Tootsie). He offered glossy middlebrow entertainment, seldom displaying great originality, and liberalism without causing ripples. He never insulted an audience's intelligence, if on occasion he strained their patience. He declared that he enjoyed preparing a movie and the more solitary task of editing but hated the actual shoot. \"It is like being a surgeon at a train wreck, except that I am trying to stop a haemorrhage of money.\"\n\nBorn in Lafayette, Indiana, to first-generation Russian-American parents, he went to high school in South Bend, where he fell in love with theatre. Rather than going to college, he went straight to the Neighbourhood Playhouse school of the theatre in New York - the great rapport he always had with actors stemmed from that early experience. He paid his debt to his mentor there with his 1984 documentary, Sanford Meisner - The Theatre's Best Kept Secret.\n\nArmy service interrupted his youthful career, including a modest Broadway debut, but he returned to teach drama and began acting in the burgeoning television market of the 1950s, also directing episodes of Ben Casey, The Defenders, Dr Kildare and The Fugitive. He graduated to the big screen with War Hunt (1962), which fortuitously marked Redford's debut, playing an army private to his future director's sergeant. Co-acting with Redford and the film's equally handsome lead, John Saxon, may have influenced Pollack's career as he realised that fame and fortune was better assured behind the camera, rather than as a character actor.\n\nHis first feature, The Slender Thread (1965) was a two-hander with Sidney Poitier and Anne Bancroft on the phone to each other as, respectively, a social worker and a potential suicide. The factually based story moved at a brisk pace, often lacking in Pollack's later movies. Its successor, This Property is Condemned (1966), derived from a playlet by Tennessee Williams. With James Wong Howe's fine cinematography it set a precedent - works that were easy on the eye. Pollack was called in to shoot a section of The Swimmer (1968), an oddity about a man (Burt Lancaster) \"swimming home\", via the Los Angeles pools of his friends. This led to an enjoyable western, The Scalphunters (1968), an uncharacteristically lighthearted work which led to a flop - the pretentious second world war drama Castle Keep, one of many films of the period influenced by European art cinema.\n\nPollack compounded the trend with They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (also 1969). Set within a depression era dance marathon, it was let down by a superficial recreation of the period, but salvaged by the cast and a melodramatic energy that ensured international success.\n\nTwo more Redford collaborations followed. The handsome, leisurely docu-western Jeremiah Johnson (1972) and the massive box office hit, The Way We Were (1974). That unlikely romance, starred Barbra Streisand as a gawky, Jewish leftwinger colliding with a conservative, handsome gentile. The theme song, engaging leads and glossy veneer made it popular and years later it came ninth in an audience poll of the Top 100 Movies - four above Pollack's Out Of Africa.\n\nTwo intelligent thrillers followed. The Yakuza marked his first work as producer-director and Paul Schrader's screenplay suited his contemplative style. It was dominated by Robert Mitchum's sleepy-eyed performance, in fine balance to the edgy one from Ken Takamura. Despite a mesmerising climax, it was not as commercially successful as the political thriller Three Days Of The Condor (also 1975), with Redford wrongfooted and unwittingly drawn into a world of murder and CIA intrigue. It made demands on its blandly self-conscious star as he battled against unseen forces and quirky action, turning it into a minor classic of the genre.\n\nOn the back of that hit, Pollack produced and directed another European-influenced drama, Bobby Deerfield (1977) with Pacino's moody and reckless racing driver in love with an unsurprisingly mournful Marthe Keller, as a terminally ill heiress. The theme of imminent death did not appeal to audiences or critics despite Pollack's skilful race track work and the attractive scenery.\n\nHe returned to the practised charms of Redford as a rodeo rider in The Electric Horseman (1979), then moved to a social drama, Absence Of Malice (1981), with Paul Newman as a dodgy businessman pursued by investigative reporter Sally Field. The director, marooned in ho-hum land, bounded free with Tootsie, which received 10 Oscar nominations and came second to ET at the box office. Dustin Hoffman's gaspingly over-the-top performance as a frustrated actor who successfully poses as a woman to get a job in a television soap was a tour de force. The actor allegedly demanded that Pollack take the supportive role as his agent - one which he fulfilled with wry brilliance.\n\nThree years later Pollack won two Oscars - best director and best film - for Out Of Africa, starring Redford opposite a strenuously accented Meryl Streep as the Danish author Karen Blixen. It was exactly the style of handsome, overtly serious movie that the Academy loved and Pollack's status allowed him to put muscle behind Presumed Innocent, White Palace, King Ralph and Sliding Doors, among other productions, before he returned to direction with Havana (1990).\n\nDespite a stunning recreation of Cuba during the 1958 revolution, the blend of old-fashioned Hollywood romance and politics failed to ignite. It proved an expensive flop and his last movie with Redford. He moved to safer ground with a gripping version of John Grisham's thriller The Firm (1993), starring Tom Cruise as a young lawyer seduced into working for a Memphis law firm, murderously in bed with the Mafia.\n\nThe film was dominated by fine ensemble playing, but Pollack frequently proved himself a match for his actors, including cameos in his own movies. Notably, he took over when Harvey Keitel exited Stanley Kubrick's old-fashioned piece of erotica Eyes Wide Shut (1999). He was even better as the wayward husband in Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives, and in Robert Altman's The Player (both 1992). With seemingly tireless enthusiasm he moved increasingly to production, including Cold Mountain, directed by Anthony Minghella, his partner at Mirage Films, Iris (2001) and even a television series, Fallen Angels. He was equally energetic in promoting his films and his craft in numerous documentaries and television programmes, and turned up in television series such as Will And Grace.\n\nAs a director he shot a redundant remake of Billy Wilder's Sabrina Fair where only the title Sabrina (1995) was snappier than the original. He stalled again with the little seen Random Hearts (1999), despite Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. Commercially, at least, he was on form with The Interpreter (2005) - harking back to his most successful genre, the political thriller. The less than credible plot line was compensated for with twists and turns to the narrative and a characteristically stylish surface - utilising New York locations - and the formidable talent of Sean Penn.\n\nAlthough then into his 70s, Pollack showed little sign of giving up as a Hollywood force, even if the style of film which he had made his own - Three Days of the Condor, for example - was by then less fashionable. He continued to use his considerable muscle to help other talented directors continue working.\n\nIn his case a final directorial credit was also a labour of love. A documentary - his only sortie into the genre - about the famed architect Frank Gehry, which was shot over an extended period and released in 2007.\n\nSketches of Frank Gehry was as much a study of the man's work and working methods as an affectionate portrait of Gehry, using interviews with collaborators and admirers, held together by the bantering conversation between the director and his subject. Pollack had endeavoured to produce as well as direct his work since 1974 with The Yakuza, and during the last decade of his life he notched up well over 20 credits, working with fellow movie makers, Anthony Minghella, Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney and a formidable team of collaborators.\n\nThe films included the final work by Anthony Minghella before his death last March, The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (2008); Michael Clayton, in which Pollack gave one of his charactistically forceful cameos as Marty Bach; and Clooney's most recent directorial effort, Leatherheads (2007). Films on which Pollack also shared a production credit included the as yet unseen Margaret and The Reader (both 2008).\n\nHis death from cancer while still so active robs the American movie industry of a seemingly tireless creator, whose role as director, producer and actor was complemented by scores of television and film documentary appearances discussing his work and that of his fellow actors and directors.\n\nInevitably he will best be remembered as the director of Tootsie, a movie oddly dubbed as the \"second funniest film of all time\" but it is certainly just one great credit among dozens.\n\nPollack married Claire Griswold in 1958 and they had three children: Steven, who was killed in an air crash in 1993, Rebecca and Rachel.\n\nDavid Hare writes: I started writing the film of Bernard Schlink's best-known novel early last year for Stephen Daldry to direct. Our three producers were Scott Rudin, Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack. Two of the three are now dead.\n\nFor the eight years since publication, The Reader had been Minghella's pet project, so it was generous of him to hand it over. At script meetings Anthony was courteous, fluent and analytical. By contrast, Sydney spoke very little, belying his reputation as a self-described \"script Nazi\". He wrapped up most of our meetings by directing our attention to what he correctly identified as the single most important problem of the day. The rest, he would say, \"You guys will sort it out.\"\n\nIt's rare to meet anyone of Sydney's intelligence, discernment, or taste in the film industry. Already a brilliant actor, he developed his third life as a producer at Mirage purely because he thought his experience could help other people. He was right. He was utterly devoid of what Ingmar Bergman called \"the hoopla and the malice\". His documentary about the architect Frank Gehry is all the more moving for the identification of the film-maker with the subject: two artists doing personal things in a public form.\n\nTypically, Sydney's last film was to have been RecountÂ¸ about Florida's hanging chads, by a 30-year-old actor writing his first screenplay. I knew Sydney for years, and never left his company without feeling cheered.\n\nSydney Irwin Pollack, film producer, director and actor, born July 1 1934; died May 26 2008."
