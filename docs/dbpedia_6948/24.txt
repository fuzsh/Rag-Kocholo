Origin of the Eckbach in "Little France" near Carslberg-Hertlingshausen and beginning of the Eckbach-MÃ¼hlenwanderweg.

The Eckbach rises here in the northern part of the Palatinate Forest near Carlsberg-Hertlingshausen and leads from here with a length of 39 kilometers through the Leiningerland and the Deutsche Weinstrasse region to the Upper Rhine Plain, before finally flowing into the Rhine at Worms.
