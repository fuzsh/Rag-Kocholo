        "text": "Our hiking tips\n\nPfälzer Weinsteig (wine trail)\n\nIt is 172 km long and gives a completely new meaning to the concept of charming scenery and diversity. Along with the Pfälzer Höhenweg and the Pfälzer Waldpfad, the Pfälzer Weinsteig is one of the three highest ranking long-distance hiking paths in the Palatinate. From the Haus der Deutschen Weinstraße in Bockenheim, it leads in 11 stages to the German Wine Gate in Schweigen-Rechtenbach on the French border.\n\nLeininger Klosterweg (monastery trail)\n\nFrom the Naturfreundehaus Rahnenhof, the Leininger Klosterweg leads via the Frauental to the old Sauhäuschen. The path then climbs up to the Kieskautberg and continues to the Schlüsselstein. Via the Leuchtenberg, you will head to the monastery village of Höningen. Here, you can stop and enjoy refreshments. On the return path towards Altleiningen, the path runs parallel to the forest trail in the Eckbachtal. After leaving the forest and passing Biobauernhof Neuhof along the Eckbach, you will return to Hertlingshausen and the Naturfreundehaus.\n\nLeininger Burgenweg (castle trail)\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Leiningen counts were an important ruling dynasty in the Palatinate. The Leininger Burgenweg connects their ancestral castle, Altleiningen castle, with the Neuleiningen and Battenberg castles. Idyllic Neuleiningen, the lush high plateau of the Nackterhof, magnificent panoramic views, and seemingly endless stretches of forest - no matter which castle you start from, awaiting you is a wonderful hike through the most northern point of the Palatinate Forest biosphere reserve."
