        "text": "In her 1882 book A Sister’s Memoir, Asia Booth Clarke, sister to the assassin of America’s 16th president, wrote that her father Junius Booth attended synagogue and was considered Jewish: “In the synagogue, he was known as a Jew, because he conversed with rabbis…and joined their worship in the Hebraic tongue. He read the Talmud, also, and strictly adhered to…its laws.” Mrs. Clarke wasn’t the only member of the family to make this claim; her older brother Edwin Booth, also reportedly told Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise that their father was Jewish. (See: The Forward, Apr. 3, 2015)\n\nHow many Americans are aware that the Jewish Secretary of the Confederate States, Judah P. Benjamin, was a close confidant of both John Surratt — a man accused of plotting Lincoln’s murder in partnership with John Wilkes Booth — and the Rothschild family of Europe? Surratt was Benjamin’s most trusted courier; his mother was implicated in the plot to kill Lincoln and was hanged.\n\nWhen Booth’s belongings were searched by Union troops on April 15, 1865, a cipher was found at the bottom of a trunk that was identical to the official Confederate ciphers found by U.S. Asst. Secretary of War Charles Dana in the offices of Judah P. Benjamin just one week earlier. At the trial of the conspirators, the cipher was entered into evidence as Exhibit 7. Benjamin fled to England before the trial and lived out his days as an affluent lawyer, suspected by some of having looted the Confederate treasury before he escaped.\n\nEvery time a deep investigative dive is done into history’s most world-altering events it seems a unique group of conspirators turn up in disproportionately large numbers. Could this be merely coincidence, or does it signify something much more sinister? In this article I will examine three of the most earth-shaking events of the modern era — namely the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, and the terror attacks of 9/11 — and expose the hidden hand that mainstream investigators dare not name.\n\nStage Managing the Patsies\n\nJFK\n\nIn the weeks and months leading up to November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was under the sway of some very interesting people. One of them was George de Morhenschildt, a prominent CIA asset and longtime associate of former president George H.W. Bush, who was a roommate of de Mohrenschildt’s nephew while a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts from 1937 – 1942.\n\nMohrenschildt had a whole host of colorful friends and associates; among them CIA director Allen Dulles, FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, D. Harold Byrd, Clint Murchison, Janet Lee Bouvier and her daughter, the future First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. The Bouviers and de Mohrenschildt were so close, in fact, that even after John Kennedy’s assassination, Oswald’s friend was still welcome in the Bouvier home.\n\nGeorge de Mohrenschildt was introduced to Oswald in the summer of 1962 by an oil accountant with ties to the CIA named George Bouhe. He assisted Oswald in his move from Fort Worth, Texas to Dallas in October of the same year and helped him find employment at a photography firm called Jaggars-Chiles-Stoval. In June 1963, de Mohrenschildt introduced Oswald to Ruth Paine, relocated to Haiti, and never saw him again.\n\nIn the spring of 1977 George de Mohrenschildt was found dead from a shotgun blast to the head after publicly complaining that “the Jewish mafia” was trying to kill him for writing a memoir about his former friend Lee Harvey Oswald titled I Am A Patsy! I Am a Patsy!\n\nShortly before his death he mailed a letter to his old pal, now director of the CIA, George H.W. Bush, in which he sought assistance for “the hopeless situation” he found himself mired in:\n\n“You will excuse this hand-written letter. Maybe you will be able to bring a solution to the hopeless situation I find myself in. My wife and I find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes; our phone bugged; and we are being followed everywhere. Either FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my complaints. We are driven to insanity by the situation. I have been behaving like a damn fool ever since my daughter Nadya died from [cystic fibrosis] over three years ago. I tried to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H Oswald and must have angered a lot of people — I do not know. But to punish an elderly man like myself and my highly nervous and sick wife is really too much. Could you do something to remove the net around us? This will be my last request for help and I will not annoy you any more. Good luck in your important job. Thank you so much.”\n\nBush responded with a letter of his own, claiming his staff had “been unable to find any indication of interest in your activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years” and suggested that “The flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren Commission has long subsided. I can only speculate that you may have become “newsworthy” again in view of the renewed interest in the Kennedy assassination, and thus may be attracting the attention of people in the media. I hope this letter had been of some comfort to you, George, although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.”\n\nThe lady to whom de Mohrenschildt relinquished control of Oswald, the aforementioned Ruth Paine, is herself an intriguing figure.\n\nKnown to history as a converted Quaker, she would tell the Warren Commission in 1964 that before moving to Dallas she had been a “leader of the Jewish community at Indianapolis” and had worked with a group which “consisted of people over the age of 60, all of them Jewish” who “spoke Yiddish in conducting their business meetings.”\n\nIt was Ruth Paine who arranged for Lee Harvey Oswald’s employment at the Texas School Book Depository shortly before November 22, 1963, putting him in an ideal position to take the fall for the assassination just a few short weeks later. Oswald even spent the night of November 21, 1963 at Ruth Paine’s house, John Kennedy’s last on earth.\n\nIt’s obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of intelligence operations that George de Mohrenschildt and Ruth Paine were shepherding Oswald into the role of patsy, perhaps at the behest of those de Mohrenschildt would later suspect of trying to kill him.\n\n*In an August 2, 2023 article, The Times of Israel reported on the identity of another spy hovering around Oswald in the lead up to November 22, 1963: “For decades, armchair analysts scrutinizing the mysteries of former US president John F. Kennedy’s assassination have fixated on who, exactly, opened his future assassin’s mail while he was under CIA surveillance ahead of the shooting…Last month, a new document dump in the ongoing declassification of Kennedy documents revealed the identity of the CIA screener: Reuben Efron, a lieutenant colonel in the US Army and a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania.” Efron lived in Israel for many years.*\n\nRFK\n\nSomething similar can be said of Sirhan Sirhan, the man accused of murdering JFK’s brother, Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe most immediately striking feature of Sirhan Sirhan is his Palestinian background.\n\nIt’s well-documented that the Kennedys were engaged in fierce battles with the State of Israel over its illegal Dimona nuclear program, and with Jewish organized crime bosses in America. In one notable instance, the fearless Attorney General Bobby Kennedy had the Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen tried for tax evasion and sent to Alcatraz prison in 1961. Cohen was mob boss Meyer Lansky’s west coast lieutenant and the man who supposedly introduced JFK to Marilyn Monroe. (Monroe’s psychiatrist, a Jew named Ralph Greenschpoon, was the first to arrive on the scene after the actresses’ suspicious death.)\n\nAlong with their struggle against Ben-Gurion’s nuclear ambitions and organized crime, the Kennedys were busy curtailing Jewish power by attempting to pass legislation that would require the powerful American Zionist Committee, a forerunner to AIPAC, to register as a foreign agent. For these reasons it has long been suspected by some researchers that Israel played a leading role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. If so, the choice of a Palestinian patsy to take the blame for the murder of Robert Kennedy while on the campaign trail in 1968 seems highly suspicious.\n\nAlmost everybody today who’s familiar with the facts of the case, including RFK’s son Robert Kennedy Jr, acknowledges that Sirhan Sirhan was under the influence of hypnosis when Bobby Kennedy was killed and couldn’t possibly have fired the fatal shot which came from directly behind Bobby at point-blank range. At no time was Sirhan behind Kennedy. This was confirmed by witnesses at the scene as well as by Los Angeles Coroner Dr. Thomas Noguchi who conducted the official autopsy.\n\nThe 1960s were a time when the CIA’s MK-Ultra program just so happened to be working on creating mind controlled assassins via hypnosis. Most people aren’t aware of how overtly Jewish the MK-Ultra program was. Directed by Hungarian Jew Sidney Gottlieb, almost all of the Agency’s prominent mind-control experts were Jews, including Louis Jolyon West, John Gittinger, Harold Abramson, Harris Isbell, Ray Treichler, James Keehner, Charles Geschickter, Eugene Saenger, Lauretta Bender, Chester Southam, Albert Kligman and Robert Lashbrook.\n\nIn his 2018 best-selling book Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations, Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman reveals that Israeli Military Intelligence had been working on a program the month before Robert Kennedy’s assassination to hypnotize and program Palestinian prisoners to kill PLO leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nCiting Bergman’s book and the Israeli plan to mind control a Palestinian patsy, French author Laurent Guyenot (The Unspoken Kennedy Truth), writes:\n\nThe idea was proposed by a Navy psychologist named Binyamin Shalit, who claimed that, “if he was given a Palestinian prisoner — one of the thousands in Israeli jails — with the right characteristics, he could brainwash and hypnotize him into becoming a programmed killer. He would then be sent across the Jordan, join the Fatah there, and, when the opportunity arose, do away with Arafat.” The proposal was approved. Shalit selected a 28-year-old Palestinian from Bethlehem, whom he deemed easily suggestionnable (sic). The operation failed, but it proves that, in 1968 precisely, Israel was practicing a method of assassination identical to the one used against Robert Kennedy.\n\nAt midnight on June 6, 1968, a seriously bewildered Sirhan Sirhan was allowed to loiter in the kitchen service pantry of the Ambassador Hotel for a half hour with an eight-round revolver in his pocket while Robert Kennedy gave a speech in the adjacent room. (13 shots were later accounted for.) It was an odd place to wait as Bobby Kennedy usually walked through his crowd of supporters after concluding his speeches and there was no plan to lead him through the kitchen. However, on this night, according to a campaign volunteer who was present at the scene, Robert’s Press Secretary Frank Mankiewicz insisted he go through the kitchen where Sirhan lay in wait. Frank Mankiewicz just so happened to begin his career “as civil rights director for the western branch of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith,” as he mentions in his autobiography, according to the late Michael Collins Piper.\n\n9/11\n\nSimilar to the way Oswald and Sirhan were manipulated by forces beyond their understanding, so too were the 19 Arab ‘hijackers’ blamed for the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nTake, for example, Hani Hanjour, who is alleged to have flown AA Flight 77 into the Pentagon, the most secure airspace in the entire world, while performing miraculous aerial maneuvers impossible for the world’s best pilots to achieve.\n\nAnd Hanjour was far from a competent pilot.\n\nIn fact, just one month before 9/11 he went to the Freeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland and tried to rent a small single-engine Cessna 172. Doing so required him to complete an evaluation proving he was a capable pilot before he could rent the plane. As former military/commercial pilot Dan Hanley wrote: “Over the course of two days, Hanjour flew three separate evaluation flights with two instructors, Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner, who both independently reported to the chief flight instructor, Marcel Bernard, that he could not handle the aircraft with a recommendation that he be denied rental, which is what occurred. In essence, Hanjour could not fly.”\n\nHanjour’s aerial ineptitude was well known. He had been banned from the first two flying schools he attended in Oakland, California and Scottsdale, Arizona, and the owner of the latter said afterwards he was a “weak student” who was “wasting our resources.” Hajour then enrolled at Sawyer Aviation with similar results. According to Sawyer instructor Wes Fults, when Hanjour attempted to use the flight simulator “He had only the barest understanding of what the instruments were there to do.” One month after 9/11, the Washington Post (Oct. 15, 2001) ran a story titled ‘Hanjour: A Study in Paradox’ which confessed that where and how Hanjour obtained a pilot’s license was “a lingering question that FAA officials refuse to discuss.”\n\nSo how was Hanjour able to acquire the necessary bona fides to cast him as a believable patsy?\n\nAccording to Hanley:\n\nHe went down the road to another fixed base operator, Congressional Air Charter, and supposedly flew with an instructor named Eddie Shalev who claimed that Hanjour was a “good pilot”. After 9/11, both the FBI and a staffer from the 9/11 Commission interrogated Baxter, Conner, Bernard and Shalev. Conner later claimed that he was expecting to receive a call to testify before the commission. The call never came. The 9/11 Commission final report totally ignored the testimony of Baxter, Conner and Bernard and only mentioned Shalev’s testimony that Hanjour was a “good pilot” and his name once in a small end note.\n\nSo…who was Eddie Shalev?\n\nHe was an Israeli who came to the states shortly before 9/11 who had previously served in the Israeli Defense Force.\n\nWas he a Mossad agent?\n\nWe will never know as he was never vetted by the 9/11 Commission and has disappeared. Some believe that he may have returned to Israel.\n\nIntel legends were created for the other alleged hijackers too.\n\nIn Hollywood, Florida duplicate passports were issued for a number of the supposed hijackers who were living there, including ‘ringleader’ Mohammed Atta. This is why reports abound of these ‘radical Muslims’ frequenting strip clubs, snorting cocaine, and leaving Korans wherever they went. Clearly a trail was being left for investigators to pick up, as described by Jean le Carre in his 1983 spy novel The Little Drummer Girl. In fact, Israeli Military Intelligence officer Hanan Serfaty rented an apartment at 4220 Sheridan Street in Hollywood, Florida while Mohammed Atta was living at 3389 Sheridan Street. Similar ‘coincidences’ in living proximity existed between Israeli intelligence officers and the alleged hijackers in six additional urban centers in the lead up to 9/11. In an article for Counterpunch magazine (Mar. 7, 2007), journalist Christopher Ketcham reported that, “All five future hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77…maintained addresses or were active within a six-mile radius of towns associated with the Israelis employed at Urban Moving Systems. Hudson and Bergen counties, the areas where the Israelis were allegedly conducting surveillance, were a central staging ground for the hijackers of Flight 77 and their fellow al-Qaeda operatives.”\n\n*Urban Moving Systems was the Mossad front company that employed the ‘5 Dancing Israelis’ who were seen filming and cheering as Flight 11 struck the North Tower.*\n\nFinally, there is the strange case of Ali al-Jarrah, a cousin of alleged hijacker Ziad al-Jarrah who is said to have stormed the cockpit and taken control of UA Flight 93 on the morning of 9/11. According to the New York Times (Feb. 18, 2009), Ali al-Jarrah had been a Mossad spy operating in Lebanon and Syria for 25 years! Friends and family were reported by the Times to be stunned once his Israeli intelligence connections were revealed because al-Jarrah had always presented himself as an earnest supporter of the Palestinian cause.\n\nControl of the Crime Scenes\n\nDealey Plaza\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 while his presidential motorcade rolled down Elm Street in Dallas, Texas in a district known as Dealey Plaza. The murder was blamed on a 24-year-old CIA informant named Lee Harvey Oswald, who, two days later, would be shot and killed on live T.V. by a Jewish gangster named Jacob Rubenstein aka Jack Ruby.\n\nOswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy from behind while perched in a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository where he was employed. You will recall that he got the job shortly before November 22, 1963 via a handler named Ruth Paine who befriended the young Oswald after being introduced to him by George de Mohrenschildt, a CIA agent and longtime associate of George H.W. Bush. Although his employment at the Texas School Book Depository put him in position to take the fall, it’s unlikely the shots which pierced Kennedy’s skin came from that building. Serious investigators suggest the Dal-Tex Building, located across from the Texas School Book Depository on the northeast corner of Elm and North Houston streets, is a more plausible location from which a majority of the shots were fired.\n\nThe Dal-Tex Building was owned by Morris Jaffe and David Weisblat. In the 1950s Jaffe was a leading member of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA), the biggest Israel fundraising body in America, and Weisblat was a big-time financial supporter of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith. The building was home to an inordinate number of Jewish businesses, including Morty Freedman’s Marilyn Belt Company and Abraham Zapruder’s Jennifer Juniors. Oddly enough, before establishing Jennifer Juniors, Zapruder worked alongside George de Mohrenschildt’s future wife Jeanne at a company called Nardis Sportswear, owned by a Russian Jew named Bernard “Benny” Gold.\n\nAside from being part-owner of the Dal-Tex building, Morris Jaffe also controlled two fashion companies, Miller-Cupaioli and Edward-Barry, which took up the entire third floor of the building. This is relevant because Jack Ruby is rumored to have called Morty Freedman in October 1963 and told him he had a “designer friend” who needed to rent a small office on the third floor looking out over Dealey Plaza. Many notable JFK assassination researchers, including Jim Garrison, Lawrence Brown, Josiah Thompson, Richard Sprague and L. Fletcher Prouty, have used audio, video and ballistics studies to prove the Dal-Tex Building had to have been one of the locations from which shots were fired, pointing specifically to the third and fourth floors. Abraham Zapruder, who would ‘document the event’ of John Kennedy’s murder with a remarkably steady hand, had his offices on the fourth floor. Zapruder sold his film to Time Magazine founder Henry Luce for $150,000, the equivalent of $1.5 million today.\n\nKennedy’s trip to Dallas was sponsored by a group called the Dallas Citizens Council, the head of which was Julius Schepps, “a wholesale liquor distributor, member of every synagogue in town, and de facto leader of the Jewish community,” according to Bryan Edward Stone’s book The Chosen Folks: Jews of the Frontiers of Texas. A notable member of the group was the ubiquitous Abraham Zapruder.\n\nChairman of the “host committee” inviting Kennedy to Dallas was Sam Bloom, another leading figure of the Dallas Jewish community. Writing in his 2014 book JFK-An American Coup d’ Etat: The Truth Behind the Kennedy Assassination,British intelligence officer Colonel John Hughes-Wilson claims it was Bloom who, after Oswald’s arrest, suggested to police “that they move the alleged assassin from the Dallas police station to the Dallas County Jail in order to give the newsmen a good story and pictures.” This, of course, allowed Jewish gangster Jack Ruby to shoot and kill Oswald during the transfer, thus preventing a trial from ever taking place. According to Col. Hughes-Wilson, “when the police later searched Ruby’s home, they found a slip of paper with Bloom’s name, address and telephone number on it.” While incarcerated for the murder, Ruby informed both his lawyer William Kunstler and his rabbi Hillel Silverman that he had killed Oswald “for the Jews.” (See: The Forward, Nov. 17, 2013). Kunstler would later write in his memoir ‘My Life as a Radical Lawyer’ that the last time he visited Ruby in jail, Oswald’s assassin handed him a note which reiterated his motive for killing Oswald was to “protect American Jews from a pogrom that could occur because of anger over the assassination.”\n\nAfter John Kennedy’s assassination, Lyndon Johnson removed Bobby as Attorney General and replaced him with Nicholas Katzenbach, a man who was instrumental in setting up the seriously flawed Warren Commission Report. This investigative committee would adopt the ludicrous ‘magic bullet theory,’ confected by the young Jewish attorney Arlen Specter to explain away blatant anomalies contradicting the government’s narrative about how John Kennedy was killed and by whom. Specter’s ‘magic bullet’ is alleged to have caused seven wounds to JFK and Senator John Connally before being found in immaculate condition on a stretcher in Parkland Memorial Hospital later that day.\n\nAmbassador Hotel\n\nThe upscale Los Angeles hotel where John Kennedy’s brother was killed contained a similar ethnic dimension to the Dal-Tex building.\n\nThe Ambassador Hotel was owned by Jewish businessman Junius Myer Schine, father-in-law of Lester Crown, whose father, Henry Crown (born Krinsky), the largest shareholder of General Dynamics, illegally sent an aircraft manufacturing plant to Israel in the 1950s. This operation became the original Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), a company closely connected to the Mossad and suspected by some researchers of being involved in international drug running through its branches in Panama and Columbia. Henry Crown’s lawyer, Albert Jenner, was the Warren Commission’s assistant counsel who personally conducted the interrogations of George de Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne. Throughout the course of the proceedings, Jenner studiously avoided any mention of Kennedy’s investigation into General Dynamics, a topic of JFK’s final speech on the morning of November 22, 1963.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Junius Schine’s Ambassador Hotel had been the headquarters for Mickey Cohen’s gambling operations, the same Mickey Cohen that Attorney General Robert Kennedy had sent to Alcatraz for tax evasion in 1961. Cohen was a close associate of Jack Ruby and Israeli terrorist and future Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and was connected to Sirhan Sirhan through his involvement with the Santa Anita Racetrack where Sirhan worked and gambled on horses. Due to this control over the crime scene, the Ambassador Hotel was the perfect place to murder the man who would have in all likelihood become president and opened a legitimate investigation into his brother’s murder.\n\nThe location may also have been selected as a macabre nose-thumbing to Robert’s and John’s father, Joseph Kennedy, who was ambassador to England during WWII and was despised by the Jews for his perceived appeasement of Adolf Hitler. Could this also be the reason Louis Steven Witt repeatedly pumped a black umbrella into the air just seconds before John Kennedy’s head was blown all over Dealey Plaza? Neville Chamberlain, another “appeaser” of Adolf Hitler and a close friend of Joseph Kennedy, was famous for carrying a black umbrella. Witt testified to the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978 that a colleague had told him the gesture would “annoy the president.”\n\nWorld Trade Centers\n\nAs with the crime scenes wherein the Kennedy brothers met their demise, ‘Ground Zero’ in New York City was also controlled by Jewish gangsters.\n\nFrom the day they opened in 1972 the Twin Towers had been state-owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But by 2000, city officials were eager to dump the outdated asbestos-riddled properties which would’ve cost billions of dollars to restore. Ronald Lauder was the man who headed Governor Pataki’s New York State Commission of Privatization and the New York State Research Council on Privatization and it was he who ultimately decided that WTC 1 and WTC 2 would become privately owned for the first time. Lauder is the longtime head of the World Jewish Congress and has been described as the man most responsible for Benjamin Netanyahu’s rise to political prominence.\n\nThe privatization of the WTC complex paved the way for ultra-Zionists Larry Silverstein and Frank Lowy to purchase a 99-year lease on the property in July 2001 which included a reworked insurance policy doubling their coverage in the event of a terrorist attack. The buildings were insured by Ace Limited and Marsh McLennan, both owned by Jules Kroll and Maurice Greenberg, who shortly thereafter sold on the liability to various other companies that would very soon take the hit. After the attacks, Silverstein would be awarded a $4.55 billion insurance payout despite only putting up $14 million of his own money to purchase the properties. It was a classic case of what our forefathers would’ve called ‘Jewish lightning.’\n\nChairman of the New York Port Authority who negotiated the deal with Silverstein and Lowy was Lewis Eisenberg. Both Eisenberg and Silverstein were board members of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA), the same group that Morris Jaffe, owner of the Dal-Tex Building, presided over in the 1950s, and Eisenberg’s senior advisor at the time, Michael Glassner, was the Southwest Regional Political Director of AIPAC. In addition to holding the lease for WTC 1 & 2, Larry Silverstein owned WTC 7, the ‘Solomon Brothers Building,’ that mysteriously collapsed into its own footprint at free fall speed at 5:20 in the afternoon on 9/11 despite not being hit by a plane. During a September 10, 2002 PBS broadcast of America Rebuilds, Silverstein seemed to admit the building was brought down with the use of pre-planted explosives, recalling: “I remember getting a call from the fire department commander and they said they weren’t sure they were going to be able to contain the fire. I said, you know, we’ve had such a terrible loss of life the smartest thing to do is pull it. And they made the decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.” FDNY chief Daniel Nigro, the aforementioned commander on duty, says he never spoke to Silverstein that day and doesn’t know of anyone who did: “I am well aware of Mr. Silverstein’s statement, but to the best of my recollection I did not speak to him on that day and I do not recall anyone telling me they did either.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThe parallels between these three seismic events are difficult to ignore. How is it possible that Jewish extremists are found at so many key points necessary for the successful realization of these high profile crimes when Jewish people account for only 2.5% of the U.S. population? The same hand can be found pulling the strings to the investigations after the fact as well. From the ridiculous Warren Commission Report to NIST’s ‘Final Report of the World Trade Center Disaster Investigations’ and Philip Zelikow’s ‘9/11 Commission Report,’ Jewish Zionists repeatedly direct the investigation away from the guilty.\n\nEqually bizarre is their apparent desire to ‘document the event.’ Is it really a coincidence that Abraham Zapruder just so happened to be in Dealey Plaza with his 8mm camera ready to capture the murder of America’s 35th President on tape? Similarly, what do we make of the so-called ‘5 Dancing Israelis’ who were detained by New Jersey police after being seen filming and celebrating the first attack on the World Trade Center on the morning of 9/11? Upon their return to Israel after 71 days in U.S. custody, three of the five men appeared on Yair Lapid’s television show and spoke about their time in America. When asked what they were doing in such close proximity to the scene of the crime, Oded Ellner replied: “Our purpose was to document the event.”\n\nIf documenting world changing crimes is a Jewish mitzvah, it could explain why German TV presenter Richard Gutjahr was in position to film the terror attacks in both Nice, France and Munich, Germany in the summer of 2016. The attacks occurred one week and 500 miles apart, yet Gutjahr happened to be present and filming at both. Gutjahr’s wife, Einat Wilf, is a former Israeli intelligence operative of Unit 8200 and a member of the Knesset. She’s worked for both Ehud Barak and Shimon Peres (the father of Israel’s nuclear program), and ran for President of the World Jewish Congress in 2007.\n\nConsidering all of this we’re left to wonder if perhaps somewhere there exists a 19th century daguerreotype of John Wilkes Booth, firing his .44 caliber Henry Deringer pistol into Abraham Lincoln’s skull, stored away in a dusty vault in some Jew’s attic.\n\nSources:\n\nGuyenot, Laurent: The Unspoken Kennedy Truth (2021)\n\nPiper, Michael Collins: Final Judgement: The Missing Link in the JFK Assassination Conspiracy (1998, first published in 1994)\n\nBollyn, Christopher: Solving 9/11 and Solving 9/11: The Original Articles (2012)\n\nBaker, Russ: Family of Secrets (2009)"
