        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThis book is a pioneering study of politics in the early middle ages, based on the middle Rhine valley. Whereas it is believed widely that the source materials for early medieval Europe are too sparse to allow sustained study of the workings of social and political relationships on the ground, this book focuses on a uniquely well-documented area to investigate the basis of power. Topics covered include the foundation of monasteries, their relationship with the laity, and their role as social centres; the significance of urbanism; the control of land, the development of property rights and the organisation of estates; community, kinship and lordship; justice and dispute settlement; the uses of the written word; violence and the feud; and the development of political structures from the Roman Empire to the high middle ages. Although a local study, the book offers persuasive and challenging generalisations about the nature of power in the early middle ages. It places its findings in an explicitly comparative perspective, identifying the peculiarities of the early medieval west and their implications for the broader sweep of European history.

I have silently standardised personal names, where possible using modern forms: thus Hruadpertus, Rodbertus, Hrutbertus and so on, all become Rupert. Where a particular form has become normal in the historiography, I have adopted this. On occasion this can lead to inconsistency: thus the eighth-century landowner Otakar and the ninthcentury archbishop of Mainz, Otgar, in fact shared a name. In particular, the Germanic name-forms corresponding to Rupert and Robert were identical, as in the case of the man known to posterity as Robert the Strong. I have endeavoured throughout to ensure that the identity of individuals is easily traced, and have been guided by this in my use of name-forms. Unidentified medieval place-names are given in italics; otherwise I have modernised silently. Place-names are given in the form of the modern country in which they lie, where no standard English form exists: thus Cologne not Köln, but Wissembourg not Weissenburg. When citing editions of acta and charters, I have indicated the charter number, not a page reference. Throughout, I have given readers only the relevant prosopographical information for the current argument, in an effort not to leave them snowed under with names. The tables in particular are designed as aids in negotiating the text, not as statements of the findings of research. In citing four of the key narrative sources, I have silently rested on excellent modern translations: namely P. Dutton, Charlemagne’s Courtier: The Complete Einhard (Peterborough, Ontario, ) for Einhard’s Translatio and his letters; J. L. Nelson, The Annals of Saint-Bertin (Manchester, ); and T. Reuter, The Annals of Fulda (Manchester, ). This is the appropriate point to acknowledge my debt to them.\n\nxiii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe debts built up in the completion of a work of this kind are inevitably legion, and in what follows I can only acknowledge a few specific and particularly important gratitudes. I must begin by acknowledging the constant encouragement and guidance of Rosamond McKitterick, who first stimulated my interest in Carolingian history and supervised the thesis out of which this book grew. Jinty Nelson and Chris Wickham, who examined that thesis, have been generous with advice and support, as has Mayke De Jong. In addition to their comments, drafts of various sections of this book have also been improved immeasurably thanks to Marios Costambeys, Paul Fouracre and Guy Halsall. The trustees of the Seeley Prize and Prince Consort Medal stimulated the speedy completion of this work by adjudging an earlier draft worthy of an equal share in their award for . William Davies and the staff at Cambridge University Press have been a model of efficiency. Thanks for financial support are due to the British Academy, a postgraduate award from whom supported the first two years of my research; and to the Master and Fellows of Peterhouse, Cambridge, for electing me to a Research Fellowship which allowed me to continue my work over the next three years. Subsequently I have been lucky enough to work in the Department of Medieval History at the University of Birmingham and the Department of History at the University of York. Much that is in this book has been presented and discussed both formally and informally with very many friends and colleagues: I am happy to be working in an environment in which early medieval history is flourishing. Particular thanks are due to colleagues in the Cambridge History Faculty, the School of Historical Studies at the University of Birmingham, and the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of York. Karin and Werner Grüber and family hosted a memorable stay in the Odenwald. Finally, I must thank my family for their support and encouragement, and particularly my wife, Jayne, for helping me see this project to completion. xiv\n\nI\n\nA\n\nS\n\nI\n\nR F\n\nUtrecht\n\nNijmegen\n\nDorestad\n\nine Rh\n\nS\n\nA\n\nX\n\nO\n\nN\n\nY\n\nPaderborn\n\nGhent Geismar\n\nD\n\nS\n\nhn La\n\nA\n\nNE\n\nEIFEL lle\n\nN\n\nÜ\n\nI\n\nH\n\nN\n\nR\n\nE\n\nhin e\n\nV O S G E A LSA S CE R\n\nL\n\nO\n\nT\n\nNeckar\n\nH\n\nar\n\nA\n\nOD\n\nVerdun\n\nin\n\nS\n\nR\n\nN\n\nU\n\nC\n\nK\n\nG\n\ne os\n\nRHEINGAU\n\nRheims\n\nErfurt\n\nHESSE St–Goar Milz Frankfurt Rethel Hammelburg Bingen Mainz Ma Echternach NAHEGAU Trebur Seligenstadt Trier Ingelheim e h WORMSGAU Würzburg W Na Lorsch A L D Tholey Worms Mettlach Ladenburg Tauberbischofsheim Altrip Sa Speyer LOBDENGAU Mosbach Metz SPEYERGAU Wülflingen Hornbach Gorze Heilbronn Heidenheim Wissembourg Sölnhofen Eichstätt Monheim Esslingen Donauwerth Strasbourg Prüm\n\nM\n\nus\n\nA\n\nMe\n\nR\n\nE\n\nN\n\nHersfeld GRABFELD Hünfeld Fulda\n\nBonn\n\nT H U R I N G I A\n\ne\n\nLiège\n\nFritzlar\n\nCologne\n\nMaastricht Aachen\n\nI\n\nSt–Trond\n\nH E S B AY E\n\nu Dan\n\nReichenau\n\nMurbach\n\nA\n\nL\n\nE\n\nM\n\nM\n\nA\n\nI\n\nN\n\nSt–Gallen\n\nB\n\nA\n\nR I A V A Freising\n\nA\n\nConstance\n\n The Carolingian Rhineland\n\nxv\n\nbe\n\nSalzburg\n\nSt–Goar Frankfurt\n\nKÖNIGSSUNDERA Mainz\n\nW\n\nN A H E G AU\n\nKönigstadt Roden Trebur Wallerstadt\n\nStockstadt\n\nA\n\nIngelheim\n\nSeligenstadt\n\nM\n\nBingen\n\nDREIEICH Baumerlenbach\n\nI\n\nO\n\nSPESSART Nierstein Dienheim Umstadt Dalheim Gernsheim Dolgesheim Flonheim Pfungstadt Eimsheim Schafhusun RHEINGAU Alzey Zullestein Wattenheim Schwanheim Ilbesheim Lorsch Bensheim Michelstadt Rockenhausen Worms Heppenheim Bürstadt Amorbach Munster-Dreisen Göllheim Lampertheim Weinheim Birkenau ODENWALD Mannhe im Oppau Leutershusun Ilvesheim Edingen Ladenburg WI NG Weiblingen Seckenheim A Dossenheim Altrip Deidesheim BD Schwetzingen EN\n\nN\n\nR\n\nKreuznach\n\nG\n\nA\n\nG A U M S\n\nU\n\nE\n\nMosbach\n\nAU\n\nHeilbronn\n\nS\n\nP\n\nY\n\nA\n\nE\n\nIB\n\nU\n\nG\n\nTE\n\nA\n\nR\n\nR\n\nHornbach S G\n\ne im rgh L O Be heim l t pe stad Ep lank P\n\nSpeyer\n\nB L I E\n\nGA U\n\nWissembourg\n\n The Carolingian middle Rhine valley\n\nxvi\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n,     On the morning of  January  an earthquake hit the middle Rhine valley. One local observer recorded this prodigy for posterity in his account of his time. Disruption occurred ‘at St Nazarius and in the regions of Worms, Speyer and Ladenburg’.1 The geographical focus of this study coincides neatly with the epicentre of the  earthquake, and, just as tremors must have been felt well beyond this immediate area in , so on occasion in what follows we will also move beyond the Rhine valley. Our observer, probably writing at Mainz, identified the region in terms of four important centres. Worms and Speyer were both seats of bishops, under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of nearby Mainz: all three bishoprics stood on the site of Roman cities on the Rhine’s west bank; Mainz and Worms were vibrant urban centres already in the ninth century, although Speyer remained a backwater until royal patronage in the eleventh century effected a transformation. East of the river, Ladenburg likewise stood on a Roman fortified site, but lacked a bishop. It was, nonetheless, an important local centre which was described by some Carolingian observers as a city: hence in the description of the  earthquake it was acknowledged as a central place which supplied an identifying label for its rural hinterland.2 The final place mentioned as being affected by the earthquake was the resting-place of St Nazarius, the royal abbey of Lorsch, which was situated around  kilometres east of the Rhine, opposite Worms. Its inclusion here reminds us of the living power of dead saints, and the significance of monasteries as social centres, in the Carolingian world. This region – the Rhine valley between Bingen and Speyer – is 1 2\n\nAF, s.a. , p. . The choice of labels in the  annal coincides with the basic geographical units into which the region was divided, each styled a pagus. See below, pp. –.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages referred to by German historians as the middle Rhine. Its current division between three Länder mirrors its fate through much of its history, but in spite of the recurrent utility of the Rhine as a geographical and on occasion political boundary, in social terms the region can be seen as a historical unity. Topographically, it was dominated by the Rhine itself. The fertile lands of the valley were the social, political and economic heartland of the surrounding areas. To both west and east, the valley is bounded by escarpments which rise dramatically. On the eastern bank, a strip of between  and  km in width – much of which is still heavily wooded today – leads abruptly to the forested hills of the Odenwald. From the Rhine, the natural routes east lie along the Main and the Neckar: in the early middle ages the valleys of both rivers were tendrils of population and communication reaching eastwards. To the west of the Rhine valley lies, similarly, a fertile band bounded by sharply rising wooded uplands, which form a natural barrier between our area and the Moselle valley. The Nahe, which meets the Rhine at Bingen, cuts into this block, which was also traversed in the early middle ages by the old Roman road from Metz to Worms. Despite this, westwards contacts in the early middle ages were limited, perhaps even more so than those with the regions to the east: the main thoroughfare was the Rhine itself, the journey downriver leading northwards to the political and economic centres of the Frankish world. The cities of the river’s banks, the villages in its valley, and even those settlements perched in the woods and hills, all looked towards the Rhine. The middle Rhine is a viable region for study thanks to the monks of the abbeys of Lorsch and Fulda. Lorsch, which we have already visited, was both wealthy and politically significant, the mausoleum of the east Frankish kings in the ninth century. Fulda, although situated around fifty kilometres east and a little north of our region, likewise enjoyed rich holdings in the middle Rhine and an intimate and important relationship with Mainz: it was, after all, the resting-place of Mainz’s first archbishop, Boniface. Extensive compilations of legal deeds detailing the acquisition of rights over land in the middle Rhine in the eighth and ninth centuries survive from both Lorsch and Fulda. These monastic riches – over , Carolingian charters are transmitted in total – make the region uniquely well documented.3 To them can be added material from other abbeys with interests – albeit less extensive – in the region. The monks who preserved these legal deeds also recorded the payments and services extracted from the peasants who worked monastic land, in documents known in historian’s jargon as polyptychs. The most precious of all these registers 3\n\nFor full references to the sources discussed in this section, see the bibliography of primary sources.\n\n\n\nIntroduction outlines the burdens imposed on the inhabitants of royal estates in the area; compiled in the middle decades of the ninth century, it was blithely copied amongst a series of surveys of monastic property by a twelfthcentury scribe.4 This vast documentary database is complemented by the survival of a portion of what was clearly once a much larger epistolary tradition. The selection of the correspondence of Boniface, collected at Mainz after his death, is the best-known letter collection from the region. More valuable for the social historian are the surviving letters of Charlemagne’s biographer, Einhard, most concerning the affairs of his monastery at Seligenstadt on the Main; they give a priceless glimpse of the social and political life of the region in the s and s. There is relatively little from the middle Rhine in the way of narrative sources, either historiographical or hagiographical. The account of ninth-century politics known as the ‘Annals of Fulda’, from which the description of the  earthquake with which we began was taken, gives a regional perspective on the great political events of the ninth century, and the occasional local insight. There is also a series of saints’ lives associated with the circle of Boniface. The most useful and vivid narrative undoubtedly comes, again, from the pen of Einhard. Like his letters, his account of the coming of the relics of Marcellinus and Peter from Rome to the Main valley and eventually to Seligenstadt puts flesh on the bare bones of social structure evident from the charters. Archaeology, both the traditional fare of cemeteries with grave-goods, and more recent excavations of settlements, likewise adds to our understanding of early medieval society. For the historian of the early medieval middle Rhine, scarcity of sources is hardly a problem. It is vital, though, to realise that the surviving evidence has an essentially Carolingian horizon, and preserves the interests and perspectives of a small but closely knit elite. We must remain acutely aware of the influence that these sources – and those who wrote them – have over our image of the society which they both record and represent. A society which has left primarily documentary sources, like the Carolingian middle Rhine, will look dramatically different from one which has left literary narratives, but the difference may be more apparent that real.5 In that received views of early medieval society still largely 4\n\n5\n\nCL–, whose true nature was first demonstrated by K.

Wackerfuß (ed.), Beiträge z ur Erforschung des Odenwaldes  (Neustadt, ), which argues on philological grounds that the polyptych dates from the middle of the eighth century. Even if the name-forms used are early, there are real historical problems in assigning the document as a whole to such an early date. Cf. T.

This book takes the opportunity the richness of the middle Rhine offers to study social power in the early middle ages. The results are of global significance because they demonstrate that the familiar sources to which scholars habitually turn, the well-thumbed products of the royal court, are in need of radical reinterpretation.   :      If we are to interrogate our sources successfully, it is vital to pose the right questions. There is a range of issues about politics and power in the early middle ages on which extant scholarship, addressing the canon of standard sources, has been unable to elicit a meaningful response. How was royal power articulated and exercised in the localities? What was the relationship between kings and local power? In a world where kings were dependent on local elites to carry out their will, what can we identify as constituting royal power? How can we differentiate royal power from aristocratic power?6 The very act of posing these questions underlines the peculiarity of early medieval polities. Nonetheless, a long tradition of scholarship has sought to describe early medieval politics in familiar terms, delineating the roles of officials whose power rested on wholesale delegation from the centre. Thus nineteenth- and early twentieth-century pioneers attempted to reconstruct the ‘Germanic’ constitution.7 In reaction to this, German scholarship of the inter-war period and later argued that aristocratic power was autogenous, originating in neither delegated royal powers nor popular institutions, but in relationships of personal dependence between lord and man. Lordly rights over dependants – so they argued – were the basis of the Frankish polity, and kings enjoyed jurisdiction over royal land and royal dependants alone.8 This approach has exerted a deep influence, and offers a fascinating perspective on the 6\n\n7 8\n\nCf.

It has not, however, dealt a fatal blow to legal-constitutional approaches to political structures, because it involved a championing of the Germanic heritage of early medieval institutions which cannot find support in the surviving evidence; the counts and counties of the Carolingian world cannot be derived from allegedly archaic forms of personal lordship whose very existence is shadowy and open to question. As a result most research has turned towards something not unlike nineteenth-century constitutionalism, often without being fully aware of the fact.9 When scholars have gone hunting Carolingian government, they have had a clear idea of the kind of beast they were tracking: a hazy silhouette. glimpsed from afar, but recognisably of the same species as the modern state. F. L. Ganshof, the doyen of twentieth-century Carolingian history, used royal decrees (capitularies) to fill in the details of tangible and centralised governmental institutions. Despite the enduring value of his work as a guide to Carolingian legislation, his picture of Frankish institutions can be challenged. This is not only because of the inevitable messiness of actual practice when compared with royal wishes. Ganshof ’s Frankish state was built up of local institutions (counts, counties and so on) which were defined by the delegation of regalian prerogative. His reading was based on an interpretation of the term bannus, found in the capitularies, as a right of command which was invested in royal officials. The actual uses of the term are relatively rare, and tend to concern obedience to specific royal orders, making it difficult to see the bannus as a fundamental constitutional principle.10 We cannot assume that the basic structures of politics were either brought into being, or legitimated, by kings, even in theory. Ganshof ’s picture of an institutionalised governmental hierarchy nonetheless remains more or less unchallenged as a representation of what Carolingian rulers wanted to do. Those historians who have bravely stalked the thickets of local documentary evidence seeking Carolingian government have used it as a guide. Tracking a beast resembling the modern state, they have returned empty handed, unable 19\n\n10\n\nA good recent example of modern criticism of the Germanist thesis, and the return to constitutionalism which has tended to follow, is A. C. Murray, ‘The Position of the Grafio in the Constitutional History of Merovingian Gaul’, Speculum  (), –. F. L. Ganshof, Frankish Institutions under Charlemagne (Providence, ), esp. pp. –, where the bannus as a legal principle is extrapolated from far more specific uses in the sources. For more recent views of political theory as far more concerned with the moral and personal, see J. Fried, ‘Der karolingische Herrschaftsverband im . Jahrhundert zwischen “Kirche” und “Königshaus”’, Historische Z eitschrift  (), –; H.-W. Goetz, ‘Regnum. Zum politische Denken der Karolingerzeit’, Z SRG GA  (), –.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages even to point to a strong scent or a footprint. Rather than halting to reconsider their assumptions about their quarry, they have tended to see Carolingian government as a rare, short-lived and soon extinct import prematurely introduced into a harsh and hostile landscape.11 In other words, the basic assumptions which inform the Ganshofian view from the capitularies remain unquestioned. Indeed, they thrive in certain historiographical traditions, particularly those which have eschewed the study of the localities in their own right. In one strand of recent Francophone scholarship, for example, the evident power and effectiveness of Carolingian kings has been taken as a tell-tale sign of the existence of a highly institutionalised state infrastructure, inherited from the Roman Empire (using similar logic, historians of tenth- and eleventh-century England have argued from the evident organisational strength of royal government for a ‘maximum view’ of structured state power).12 Both optimists and pessimists share the assumption that the Carolingians were attempting to forge a unitary polity run via the routine delegation of royal power through administrative institutions. They reach differing conclusions largely because they study different sources, but they share a similar view of the Carolingian state, while disagreeing over whether it was hale and hearty or pale and pathetic. Both often share an almost Prelapsarian image of a Carolingian Eden, where peaceful peasants frolic freely under the protection of strong justice-loving kings and deep-rooted public institutions. In such a scheme of things, the Carolingian period ultimately becomes little more than an interesting blip in the long run of European history, a short-lived predecessor to, and antithesis of, the ‘feudal’ age of private, normatively brutal, aristocratic power.13 This is not to deny that there have been important developments in our understanding of Carolingian politics in the past half-century. Broadly speaking, the most innovative work on early medieval politics has proceeded on two fronts. First, prosopography – the identification of networks of kinship – has allowed a much deeper understanding of the 11 12\n\n13\n\nA position exemplified by J.-P. Poly and E. Bournazel, The Feudal Mutation (New York, ). For French scholarship on the Carolingians, see J. Durliat, Les finances publiques de Dioclétian aux Carolingiens (–), Beihefte der Francia  (Sigmaringen, ). For England, see J. Campbell, ‘The Late Anglo-Saxon State: The Maximum View’, Proceedings of the British Academy  (), –. As is evident in such high-quality work as H. Keller, ‘Zum Charakter der “Staatlichkeit” zwischen karolingischer Reichsreform und hochmittelalterliche Herrschaftsausbau’, Frühmittelalterliche Studien  (), –; or T. N. Bisson, ‘The “Feudal” Revolution’, P&P  (), –. The classic statement of the ultimate insignificance of the Carolingian period was that of Bisson’s teacher, J. R. Strayer, On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State (Princeton, ), pp. –.\n\n\n\nIntroduction interests and motivations of the aristocracy.14 Second, and more recently, political ritual has been shown to have played a central role in the transmission of political rules and the mobilisation of political support: kings used ritual to manipulate early medieval ‘consensus politics’. In the most challenging recent work, these two strands of research have come together to put our reading of high politics on a new level of fluency: the rich and complex lexicon of early medieval public life is beginning to be decoded.15 We are now far more aware of the importance of the interaction between the royal court and local politics, and the processes of group formation which created the basic units of early medieval society.16 Nonetheless, we are no closer to explaining how armies were equipped and put in the field, and tribute and services extracted from rural society. In fact, even in the best current scholarship, something not unlike the Ganshofian institutionalist approach holds the field by default.17 This is shown most clearly in the flourishing series of local studies, whether written in the German tradition of Landesgeschichte, or the French regional thèse inspired by the Annales school’s championing of history ‘from the bottom up’. In that such work provides a local perspective it has the potential to qualify the view from the royal court. Indeed, regional studies have played an important role in further underlining the centrality of local elites to the political system, thus merging with the work of the prosopographers.18 But the empirical data local studies 14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\nWhere I have used the term ‘aristocracy’, it is in recognition of the social fact of a dominant group which was born powerful and was conscious of the fact; I do not mean to suggest in my use of the term that the early medieval elite was closed, static or defined legally, merely that it was based on the inheritance of extensive landholdings. For more on the problems of definition, see pp. –. Compare two recent biographies of early medieval rulers, J. L. Nelson, Charles the Bald (London, ) and G. Althoff, Otto III (Darmstadt, ); see also the work collected in Nelson, Politics and Ritual in Early Medieval Europe (Woodbridge, ) and The Frankish World, – (Woodbridge, ) and in Althoff, Spielregeln der Politik im Mittelalter.

French scholarship has concentrated on France and the Mediterranean and, following Duby, on the post-Carolingian period (partly because of the relative lack of Carolingian documentary evidence in France at least): the classics\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages have uncovered have continued to be processed within an institutionalist understanding of royal power. This is clearly evident in a series of recent works which investigate the key figures in the Frankish polity, the counts. In  H. K. Schulze, working from the charter evidence from the provinces east of the Rhine, pointed to the ubiquity of counts, and of territorial divisions into geographical units styled pagus and roughly equivalent to the later English county; here were the royal institutions and officials which constituted the Frankish state. Ulrich Nonn’s  study of the upper reaches of the Rhine similarly investigated pagus-labels and the appearance of counts in the charter evidence, arguing that the Carolingians divided up regional political units led by duces, and implemented a system of pagi and counts. Both works were based upon constitutionalist assumptions about the nature of local power: both Schulze and Nonn saw understanding Frankish government as a matter of identifying administrative institutions through which royal agents exercised delegated royal power. Once they found counts and pagi, they made no attempt to investigate what royal officials actually did.19 Michael Borgolte’s controversial work on Carolingian Alemannia (roughly modern Switzerland and that area of southern Germany immediately to the north) marked an important attempt to get closer to the realities of early medieval society. The system of regular pagi run by counts which can be identified in parts of Alemannia was not, he argued, a reflection of an unchanging Frankish polity, but a state of affairs consciously created by Carolingian rulers in the course of eighthcentury reconquest. In some outlying areas, complexes of aristocratic power which looked very much like autogenous lordship rights could be identified as late as the ninth century, whilst elsewhere efforts to reshape society in terms of counts and counties could be detected. In spite of heavy criticism, the broad outline of Borgolte’s work is convincing. Yet even Borgolte ultimately fails to explain how political power was exercised on a local level. Despite accentuating the importance of aristocratic kinship networks – something which his predecessors had also Footnote  (cont.) are P. Bonnassie, La Catalogne du milieu du Xe à la fin du XIe siècle (Toulouse, ) and P. Toubert, Les structures du Latium médiéval (Paris, ); the best Carolingian local study is C.

Although his work has placed our understanding of counts on a new footing, we still have little idea about what being a count actually involved; here we once again turn back to Ganshof ’s reading of the capitularies.20 In other words, in spite of much important new work on early medieval politics, the basic framework within which findings are assimilated and interpreted has remained remarkably stable.21 Yet this framework is based on assumptions about the delegation of power from the top down, and the ruler as the sovereign source of legitimate power, which are looking increasingly dated. What is needed is a shift of paradigm, the creation of a new interpretative framework to replace the often unspoken institutionalism which underpins our thinking about early medieval politics.22 Rather than searching for insitutions, we need to study the generation and transmission of power: that is, to examine the structures of social action, and the political strategies which it was possible to pursue within these structures (remembering, of course, that even the most basic structures were not static but were reproduced and so subtly altered over time).23 A series of recent studies which have exploited the potential of the documentary evidence to analyse the exercise of power in the localities point the way forward. So far, this kind of local documentary work 20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nSee M.

But for all the recent stress on agency and the renegotiation of the social process over time, we should not underestimate the extent to which action is historically delimited.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages has concentrated on illuminating the workings of early medieval society, although the obvious implications for our understanding of political structures have been highlighted.24 By examining the ways in which societies handle conflict, we can observe the surge of currents of power; the documentary evidence allows us to plot the connections through which power flowed, and the objectives for which that power was harnessed. This study investigates the circuits of power in the ‘small worlds’ which made up the Carolingian Empire as a means of reformulating our views of political power in the early middle ages. Local power was problematical, something that needed constant maintenance, and if we ignore this basic fact we inevitably misunderstand the Frankish polity. The more we look at local leaders, the more it becomes clear that legalistic constitutional ideas about delegated rights of command simply do not explain the realities of power. In the localities, we meet forms of political leadership which were inherently personal, resting on one-to-one obligation and the recognition of transcendent moral qualities. Power, deeply unequal in its distribution within a profoundly hierarchical society, rested in reciprocity. It depended on informal channels of moral obligation and social pressure, not constitutional positions.25 In such a world, power could only be negotiated and shared; only when power is institutionalised can it be delegated and controlled. One central concern of this study is the process by which power came to be presented in formal, legal terms, separated from the web of personal relationships involved in its exercise. In analysing the transformation of power there is a series of diagnostic questions which must be borne constantly in mind. Were political leaders more than particularly influential social actors, their power immersed in normal patterns of social action? Could they exercise 24\n\n25\n\nCf. W.

Was the act of ruling seen as something separate and distinct from the everyday functioning of society?26 The political structures of the early middle ages need to be analysed in their own right and on their own terms. We cannot go on seeing early medieval polities as simply inchoate or less developed forms of the ‘perfected feudalism’ of the high middle ages, or degenerate and messy continuations of ancient society. On the most general of levels, European society throughout the first millennium AD was traditional and agrarian, and so political power was closely tied to control of the land and those who worked it. Generalisations of this scale, however, do not make for penetrating analysis, and the moment we try to be more specific about the construction of political power, we are faced with manifest and important changes. In the Roman world, political power was mediated through the infrastructure of the state, and in particular through the city and the nexus of administrative and fiscal law. By the twelfth century, political power was rooted in jurisdictional rights which were understood as a form of property, the legal and proprietorial combining to define control of land and people.27 The intervening period cannot satisfactorily be reduced to either a hangover from antiquity or a melting-pot out of which high medieval society emerged. In both schemes there is more than a hint of the Dark Ages paradigm which has not quite been exorcised yet – for is not the characterisation of five centuries of gradual synthesis an effective writing off of any independent value to those centuries? Historical development cannot be seen as a simple progression from chaos to order, irrational to rational. Unless we recognise that the early middle ages have their own legitimacy as a historical period we fall victim to a self-fulfilling teleology, describing it in terms of what came before and after and thus positing a natural and seamless transition from one to the other. In other words, we must take care before we characterise the early middle ages in terms of a simple polarity between the heritage of the ancient world and the birth of a new, medieval society – a polarity prolonged by the tendency of specialists to discuss the period in 26\n\n27\n\nCf. K. Polanyi, ‘The Economy as Instituted Process’, in Polanyi, C. M. Arensberg and H. W.

Eisenstadt, ‘The Study of the Process of Institutionalisation’, in Eisenstadt, Essays on Comparative Institutions (New York, Sydney and London, ), pp. –. If one defines ‘feudalism’ as a system of social organisation, in which power is articulated in terms of a hierarchy of proprietorial and jurisdictional rights, here we have it – and it has no necessary or causal connection with the prevalence or otherwise of specific forms of tenure, personal lordship or military organisation. On account of the confusion caused by the different senses of the word ‘feudalism’, I have not used it in this study.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages terms of unreflective and one-dimensional categories of ‘continuity’ and ‘change’.28 The early middle ages were both dynamic and distinct, characterised by a particular relationship between ‘state’ and ‘society’ which was radically different from what went both before and after. The peculiarity of this relationship, indeed, was such that our modern categories of ‘state’ and ‘society’ tend to collapse into each other when encountering with early medieval evidence.29 What follows is divided into two parts. In the first, consisting of chapters –, I adopt a broadly ‘horizontal’ approach, focusing on the ‘sourcerich’ Carolingian period and analysing the fundamentals of social and political organisation. I begin by attempting to explain precisely why the Carolingian period is so well documented, examining the relationship between monasteries and lay society. I go on to examine the nature of landownership and the relationships between kinship, social status and the land; the texture of power, the places at which collective action took place, and the activities of those who ruled this society; and, finally, the ability of the political centre to impinge on the locality, to raise armies and tap the agrarian surplus. None of these discussions, however, stays wholly rooted in the Carolingian period, or presents a picture of stasis; they glance forward and back, and attempt to locate the vivid Carolingian evidence in longer patterns of development. I then present a diachronic analysis of the process of political change. Within this analysis, I offer a history of middle Rhenish politics from the late Roman period to the eleventh century – not a conventional political narrative so much as an analysis of changing political structures and the key points in their evolution. In conclusion, I identify the key characteristics of the political structures of the early medieval west, and trace the implications of those structures and their peculiarities. 28\n\n29\n\nSee G. Halsall, Settlement and Social Organisation: The Merovingian Region of Metz , – (Cambridge, ). Hence it is only in my concluding analysis that I reintroduce the term ‘state’: to do otherwise would be to court confusion. I should underline that I am not claiming to discover ‘the state’ in my period, but analysing the peculiarities of the organisation of political power in the early middle ages, as the conclusion makes clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nMONASTICISM, SPIRITUAL PATRONAGE AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE\n\n    :    ‘Total history’ is an impossibility, because in studying any historical society we are totally reliant on the highly selective and carefully selected views transmitted to us by that society and its successors. Any serious attempt at reconstructing a past society must therefore begin by confronting the problem of the representativeness or otherwise of the surviving sources. The evidence which survives from the early medieval period is only a tiny subset of what once existed, but its survival is not necessarily random. Those documents which were transmitted were not just lucky enough to avoid the random variables of destruction and loss; most were copied because of conscious decisions made to preserve them by later generations.1 In the Carolingian middle Rhine, documents were copied in large numbers because they recorded an important process of social change, which saw monasteries acquiring rights over land on an unprecedented scale. If we consider what is lost, it is clear that more or less random destruction through decay, war or natural disaster played a part: hence the absence of Carolingian material from the archives of the cathedrals of Mainz, Worms and Speyer. Similarly, the abbey of Hersfeld preserved the originals of its royal grants, but not documents recording its dealings with non-royal individuals. The odd non-royal documents that do survive from Hersfeld are, essentially, lucky: three ninth-century charters were used as bookbindings in the tenth century and thus preserved and later rediscovered.2 But the majority of the documents which made this study possible did not owe their transmission to such happy chances. In 1\n\n2\n\nThese issues have recently begun to attract the attention they deserve: the classic medieval study is P. J.

Whilst only a handful of original charters survive, none earlier than the ninth century, large collections of copies of documents – cartularies – were made in the Carolingian and post-Carolingian periods.3 This makes the middle Rhine, in terms of the charter evidence, the best-documented part of Carolingian Europe north of the Alps. A full-length cartulary from Lorsch, copied in the twelfth century, records over , transactions, the vast majority dated between  (the abbey’s foundation) and the end of the ninth century.4 The credentials of the material as overwhelmingly genuine are unchallenged and unchallengeable. The inclusions and omissions within the Lorsch material show that we are reliant on the active choices made by monastic archivists: a record of dispute settlement (placita) only made it into the cartulary where no written act of donation for the property concerned survived, and written records of lettings of monastic land were consciously excluded. Two sides of Lorsch’s relations with its neighbours were thus almost totally obscured.5 The compilers of the Lorsch cartulary, moreover, did not copy out surviving documents willy-nilly: rather, they were consciously organised by geographical units, first of all by the pagus, then by individual settlement units, each called a villa, within the pagus; for each villa the documents were ordered chronologically. This suggests that much of the twelfth-century cartulary which survives is actually a copy of an earlier Carolingian compilation: pagus units were redundant by the twelfth century, but we know that Carolingian archives and cartularies elsewhere organised documents pagus by pagus. One might suggest a compilation date of c. , given the more or less total absence of material after that date, other than in the introductory cartulary-chronicle.6 3\n\n5\n\n6\n\nOn the rarity of non-royal originals from east of the Rhine in this period see H. Breßlau, Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien,  vols. (nd edn, Leipzig, –), II, p. . See A. Bruckner and R. Marichal (eds.), Chartae Latinae Antiquiores:Facsimile Edition of Latin Charters prior to the N inth Century,  nos. ,  for the only two non-royal originals from the area from 4 before . Codex Laureshamensis, ed. K. Glöckner,  vols. (Darmstadt, –). On precarial grants, see the explicit statement in CL. That placita were similarly excluded is my explanation for the often-noted lack of such documents in CL. Certainly placita were only transmitted where no ‘better’ document with no hint of dispute about the estate in question was available: CL, CL are both fine examples. (Other placita are not strictly speaking court proceedings but record boundaries, and are thus more likely to be preserved and on occasion interpolated: CLa is the classic example.) On its compilation and transmission more work is needed, but see Glöckner’s comments in CL I, pp. –. See also F. Staab’s important discussion of the organisation of the Lorsch archive before the compilation of CL, ‘Aspekte der Grundherrschaftsentwicklung von Lorsch vornehmlich aufgrund der Urbare des Codex Laureshamensis’, in W. Rösener (ed.), Strukturen der Grundherrschaft im frühen Mittelalter, VMPIG  (Göttingen, ), pp. –.\n\n\n\nMonasticism, spiritual patronage and social structure Cartulary-compilers did not, however, blindly copy what lay before them. Most of the non-royal charters were severely abbreviated, precisely because vital details for the social historian such as the names of witnesses and scribes, and the places at which documents had been enacted, were of little interest to later generations of monks, whose interests centred on the specific pieces of property being given and the identity of the donors. At the abbey of Fulda fragments of Carolingian cartularies, organised pagus by pagus, survive, most usefully for us one dealing with the Mainz area.7 This Carolingian material is complemented by a series of twelfthcentury registers of donations. On one hand, random decay and destruction played a role in determining what survives, in that we have only parts of a once larger Carolingian compilation; on the other, the active institutional agency of the monastery was crucial, for it was a matter of choice that these compilations were made, preserving records of monastic land dealings over preceding generations, and that further efforts at archival preservation were made in the twelfth century. The other diplomatic sources – above all the evidence from Wissembourg, from which two sections of a Carolingian cartulary survive, preserving documents from two particular pagi – confirm this picture.8 Whilst it cannot be denied that the evidence is ‘pretty laconic in its present form’, the real challenge is to understand the mind-numbingly formulaic tradition of the documents and thus open up a vast database.9 The surviving charters are, in a sense, wholly unrepresentative. The interests of the cartulary-compilers, and of the compilers and keepers of monastic archives, edited the material. The surviving documents tell us about pious gifts to the church, and a little about later challenges to these transactions, but stand in an uncertain relationship to the wider field of social intercourse. Little is known about transactions not involving the new rural monasteries of the eighth and ninth centuries. We can rest 7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nOn the transmission of the Fulda material see E. E. Stengel, Abhandlungen und Untersuchungen z ur Hessischen Geschichte, Veröffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission für Hessen und Waldeck  (Marburg, ), pp. –. The corpus was edited by E. F. J. Dronke in Codex diplomaticus Fuldensis (Aalen, ) and Traditiones et antiquitates Fuldenses (Fulda, ); a systematic re-edition was planned by Stengel, but he was only able to publish a modern edition for the period up to : Urkundenbuch der Kloster Fulda, ed. E. E. Stengel, Veröffentlichungen der historischen Kommission für Hessen und Waldeck ,  vols. (Marburg, –). The completion of Stengel’s project is a desideratum. K. Schmid et al.

In recent years some historians have acknowledged the problems of the evidence, attempting to place it in a fuller context by posing questions about the uses of writing, the factors encouraging gifts of land to the church, and the nature of landownership.12 By asking why some documents survive we can avoid being misled by the provenance of the surviving evidence into accepting a partial view of social interaction at face value. Whilst we obviously cannot work outside the transmitted evidence, we can avoid the main pitfall facing the historian of early medieval Europe, that of being ‘source-driven’. Once we have understood the contemporary function of the documentation, and the factors determining its survival, we are in a stronger position to pose questions about social change.13 The surviving documentary evidence is concerned first and foremost with the interaction between church and society. From the middle Rhine, we have several thousand charters transferring rights over land to the church – or rather, to a small number of particularly popular monastic communities. Each pious gift can be understood as an individual transaction in terms of the family exercising and transferring property rights, and in the context of the relationship between the donors and the recipient monastery. But when we look at pious gifts in aggregate, clear patterns of distribution across time and space also emerge. We have one hundred times more documents from the s than from the s, and virtually no documents after the s. As well as this long chronological 10 11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nSee p. . Cf. the discussion of changing forms of documentation by P. Johanek, ‘Zur rechtlichen Funktion von Traditionsnotiz, Traditionsbuch und früher Siegelkunde’, in P.

Barthélemy’s criticisms of French historians of the tenth and eleventh centuries, who, he claims, have been misled by changing patterns of documentation into exaggerating the scale of the social changes taking place at the time: ‘La mutation féodale a-t-elle eu lieu?’, Annales ESC  (), –; also P. Stafford, ‘La mutation familiale: A Suitable Case for Caution’, in J. Hill and M. Swan (eds.), The Community, the Family and the Saint (Turnhout, ), pp. –.\n\n\n\nMonasticism, spiritual patronage and social structure tide, shorter and more local eddies and currents can be detected: gifts ebb and flow in particular localities, or from particular kin groups, at particular dates. Of course, we must allow for the random loss of some documents, but this cannot explain the patterns in the surviving evidence. The cartularies which preserve the evidence were composed in precisely that period in which the tide of gift-giving had very visibly gone out – the middle decades of the ninth century. The chronological patterning of gifts cannot thus be explained by the existence of a cut-off date after which documents were not preserved, because the gradual going out of the tide of giving is apparent over the decades pre-dating cartulary compilation. Moreover, if we concentrate on areas for which there is a good transmission from one or more institution, there is no reason why documents from a particular decade or a particular locality should be more susceptible to random loss on a sufficient scale to explain the patterns of pious gifts. The broad chronological profile is consistent across different institutions whose different archives had very different histories, and at Fulda the picture of the cartularies can be checked against, and confirmed by, the evidence preserved in twelfth-century registers. These waves of pious giving are thus challenging phenomena which were at once both universal and highly local. They were universal as, at broadly similar dates, a similar dynamic can be detected across a vast area of Europe, down the Rhine and in the provinces to its east, in the Moselle and Saar valleys, even into Italy. The tide gathered momentum in the middle of the eighth century, but was in retreat by the first decades of the ninth.14 They were local as ultimately each donation can only be understood in its specific social, chronological and geographical context. They are challenging as each donation was simultaneously a legal act transferring rights over property, a social act involving kin, lords and neighbours, and a spiritual act patronising the church. Above all, they are invaluable, as each donation concerns land and rights over the exploitation of land, the basic resource in this society, and thus relates to the most significant social relationships, providing insight into the fundamentals of power. Gifts of land to the church were ‘total occasions’: social, legal and spiritual factors were simultaneously operative. There is thus no need to debate the relative merits of ‘religious’ versus ‘materialist’ explanations. To draw attention to the social logic of giving to the church is not to 14\n\nIn the region between the Loire and Seine a different pattern is apparent, with a very gradual and more or less continuous increase in the number of surviving gifts from the seventh century through to the high middle ages. See R. Le Jan, Famille et Pouvoir dans le Monde Franc(Paris, ), p. , for figures. Whether this pattern is to be explained in terms of genuine social difference or differences in the process of transmission is clearly an important issue. In Italy, we have a similar distribution, with a gradual and continuous increase in the number of surviving documents, but one also marked by a shift from gifts to leases in the course of the ninth century.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages argue that those who gave land were calculating self-interest in the absence of any spiritual motivation; similarly, to insist that the religious motives stated by the charters must be taken seriously is not to assert that those who gave land were simply particularly pious individuals.15 To argue that the best way to explain the startlingly concentrated chronological and geographical distribution of pious gifts is to look for local social, economic and political factors avoids the obvious danger of ignoring the fact that gifts of land were transfers of power: it should not involve reducing religious motivation to a superstructural epiphenomenon. But we cannot afford to forget that pious gifts of land were acts with legal, social and political significance, and that they take on a very particular pattern in their distribution in space and time.          The best starting-point for any study of gifts of land to the church in the middle Rhine is the foundation of the abbey of Lorsch by the powerful landowner Cancor and his widowed mother Willeswind in , on their portions of an important family centre.16 Cancor and Willeswind gave their abbey to their kinsman Chrodegang, bishop of Metz, monastic reformer, papal legate in Francia and the driving force behind the reform of the Frankish church.17 Lorsch was staffed with monks from Chrodegang’s foundation at Gorze, led by Guntland, Chrodegang’s brother, who became abbot. A stress on contemporary Roman usage lay at the heart of Chrodegang’s reform agenda; Chrodegang was responsible for one of the earliest translations of Roman martyrs to Francia in  when he acquired the relics of Gorgonius, Naborius and Nazarius from 15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nC. B. Bouchard, Sword, Miter, and Cloister:N obility and the Church in Burgundy, – (Ithaca and London, ) seems to me to stress religious motivation at the expense of practical implications. Both Wickham’s ‘patronage’ model and Rosenwein’s ‘association’ model acknowledge the many layers of pious giving: see, respectively, The Mountains and the City, pp. –, –, –, and To Be the N eighbor, passim.

Gorgonius and Naborius found their way to Gorze and Chrodegang’s other foundation near Metz, St Avold, respectively, whilst Lorsch was dedicated to Nazarius.18 The twelfth-century cartulary chronicle preserves what may be a Carolingian description of the crowds, Cancor at their head, who welcomed the Roman saint to his new home.19 The charter evidence confirms that locals really did welcome Nazarius; Lorsch received over a hundred donations of land each year in the first five years of its existence. In giving land to the new Roman saint brought to the middle Rhine by Chrodegang and Cancor, donors were buying into a network of spiritual patronage: in one donation charter a benefactor refers to ‘my peculiar patron, St Nazarius’.20 Concerns about prestige and local position informed the early waves of donations. Things really took off in March . From  to  March we have ten donations, all bar one of land at Mannheim and neighbouring settlements, most made at Weinheim. These gifts were made before the local elite, the great and good of the area just south of Lorsch on the lower Neckar. They were very public acts. Being seen to patronise the new saint expressed social status. After this wave of gifts, the urge to buy into Nazarius’ charisma was felt by another elite grouping which dominated a different locality, across the Rhine from Lorsch: on  March we have three donations from Oppenheim and two from nearby villages, on  and  March further donations from Oppenheim. The men who gave were not just buying into saintly patronage and expressing their local position by doing so: they were also associating themselves with Cancor and Chrodegang, the two political patrons par excellence in the area. After all, Lorsch was staffed with monks from Chrodegang’s Gorze, run by Chrodegang’s brother, funded by Cancor and his kin. Giving to the new foundation not only expressed and confirmed social status, it also claimed a link with the wider political world via Cancor and Chrodegang. (See fig. , overleaf) Nazarius made a huge and immediate impact on middle Rhenish 18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nSee Annales Laureshamenses, ed. G. H. Pertz, MGH SS , pp. –, s.a. , ,  respectively.

It would be possible to examine the material in very great detail, outlining a pattern of waves such as that we have already seen in March , with local eddies and ripples. Substantial donations continued for three-quarters of a century, but their volume fell off, in a gradual but perceptible process. Both the scale and immediacy of Lorsch’s impact were unparalleled. Of course, there were other monasteries which had a wide appeal and generated similar waves of pious gifts. The closest comparison with Lorsch is Fulda, founded in  under the aegis of Boniface, the Anglo-Saxon missionary active under Frankish protection in the provinces east of the Rhine. The written accounts of Fulda’s foundation depicted an isolated spot in a remote wilderness, but archaeology shows that the monastic complex actually overlay an important site, probably a centre of Frankish lordship over the Grabfeld.21 Fulda made a slow start in terms of attracting benefactions: non-royal gifts only really began after  and slowly reached a high-tide mark in the decades around . Although Fulda stood over  km to the east of the middle Rhine valley, its early benefactors were from the Mainz and Worms areas; indeed, gifts made by ‘easterners’ of more local estates only really began in the s, and this regional catchment area only eclipsed the middle Rhine as the focus of the abbey’s interests in the first decades of the ninth century. By  the tide of giving was going out in the middle Rhine, although the abbey never lost its connections with the area. The tide of giving to Fulda turned slightly later in Fulda’s other catchment areas, the upper Main and the Grabfeld, but it was retreating even there by the middle of the ninth century.22 Given sufficient contextual knowledge, it is possible to be very specific about the social mechanics of patronage. In the Fulda donations a number of discrete and definable groups of benefactors are immediately apparent. Many of the earliest patrons of Fulda were involved in one way or another with Lull, Boniface’s disciple and successor as bishop of Mainz. Most of them must have known Boniface: one donation, by Otakar, was made as the body of Boniface, killed in Frisia in  and 21\n\n22\n\nSee H. Hahn, ‘Eihloha – Sturm und das Kloster Fulda’, and K. Heinemeyer, ‘Die Gründung des Klosters Fulda im Rahmen der bonifatianischen Kirchenorganisation’, Fuldaer Geschichtsblätter  (), –, –, respectively. For the background, W. Levison, England and the Continent in the Eighth Century (Oxford, ) and T. Schieffer, Winfrid-Bonifatius und die christliche Grundlegung Europas (Freiburg, ), remain fundamental. On Fulda see most recently G. Schrimpf (ed.), Kloster Fulda in der Welt der Karolinger und Ottonen, Fuldaer Studien  (Frankfurt, ). E. Friese, ‘Studien zur Einzugsbereich der Kloster von Fulda’, in Klostergemeinschaft, II:iii, pp. – is fundamental. See also F. Staab, ‘Der Grundbesitz der Abtei Fulda bis zur Mitte des . Jahrhundert und seine Stifter’, in W. Böhne (ed.), Hrabanus Maurus und seine Schule: Festschrift der Rabanus-Maurus-Schule (Fulda, ), pp. –, with useful maps.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages proclaimed a martyr, was moved from Mainz, where it had lain for some time, to its final resting-place at Fulda. Here is a documentary counterpart to the written accounts which depict pious well-wishers rushing to glimpse the martyr’s body as it went east.23 Boniface’s contacts and patrons and their descendants continued to provide the backbone of Fulda’s middle Rhenish benefactions into the ninth century. The children of Otakar and his brother, and some of their descendants, maintained the links made in the time of Boniface by keeping up a steady flow of gifts, some large, some small, and thus reaffirming their relationship to Boniface’s foundation at Fulda.24 If initial gifts to Fulda were from Otakar and his kin and contacts, by the s more gifts were coming, many on a less elevated social level. There may have been an element of emulation at work here: if the powerful Otakar and his kin were Fulda’s patrons par excellence, imitating them and giving to Fulda was a way of expressing status, and aligning oneself with this potent patron, on a more local level. Certainly by the s members of very local elites were active patrons of Fulda, including some men whose social horizons may have barely extended beyond the immediate neighbourhood and who were well-todo peasants. Lorsch had enjoyed a similar profile in the middle Rhine since its foundation. For a case study, the villa of Dienheim on the Rhine is probably the most richly documented rural settlement in Carolingian Europe. Here one faction of local landowners identified itself, from the late s, by its patronage of Fulda. This settlement was politically split. The series of gifts to Fulda from one group of landowners can be compared with a parallel series of gifts to Lorsch, made by a different group of landowners which showed very little overlap with the Fulda benefactors. The pious donations recorded by the charters were part of a very local political game of patronage and conspicuous display, two local factions expressing their opposition by making benefactions to different saints, and aligning themselves with different patrons beyond the village by doing so.25 A fascinating series of donations to Fulda made in January  illustrate precisely how gifts of land were central to local networks of patron23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nWillibald, Vita Bonifatii, ed.

Gifts of Dienheim land to Fulda were made, at Dienheim, on  and  January; the bulk of the witnesses to these two donations were the well-to-do landowners who dominate charter witnessing at Dienheim. But in a remarkable piece of detective work, Eckhard Friese has also identified a handful of witnesses from outside Dienheim in each donation, who are part of a larger group of thirty-three men who witnessed Fulda charters across the region, from the middle Rhine to the Saale, right through the period –. The two Dienheim donations from January  can be related to a series of others from the middle Rhine in the same month, tied together by the activity of these outside witnesses: at the monastery of Fischbach, north of Mainz, on  January; at the doors of the monastery of St Alban’s, Mainz, on the th; then, after the Dienheim gifts of the th and th, at Wackernheim, just south of Mainz, on the th; at the unidentified Marahabergen on the th; and at Altheim near Worms on  February. This was precisely the period at which a great reform council was held at Mainz, and the revivalist tenor of the church’s leaders obviously percolated down to local elites. The charter witness-lists show laymen in the service of Abbot Ratgar – a powerful and controversial figure – actively priming the abbey’s patronage network, applying social pressure to solicit further gifts.26 (See fig. ). Lorsch and Fulda were by no means the only churches in the eighthcentury middle Rhine: we need to ask why it was these particular monastic foundations at this particular date which attracted such enthusiastic patronage. Christianity had a continuous history in the middle Rhine, in spite of the dislocation of the fifth and sixth centuries and the transition from Roman to Frankish rule. Judging by episcopal lists, bishops may have briefly disappeared in this period, but the archaeological record demonstrates that Christian communities and churches continued to exist in the cities of Mainz and Worms, and in Roman forts such as Alzey, Bad Kreuznach and Bingen. But this Christian continuity remained very much tied up with former Roman sites: in the middle Rhine in the sixth 26\n\nFriese, ‘Einzugsbereich’, pp. –. The Dienheim charters are CDF, ; the others are CDF, , , , , . Friese is surely correct to link the peculiar visibility of this group in the charters to Abbot Ratgar’s controversial managerial style, and particularly his use of trusted laymen in key offices (see the complaints voiced in Supplex Libellus, ed. J. Semmler, in K. Hallinger (ed.), Corpus Consuetudinum Monasticarum I (Siegburg, ), pp. –, at cc. , , pp. , ); but the existence of such a group would be more normal (e.g. Abbot Hraban’s legates in CDF).

In the seventh century the first rural monasteries were founded. By the eighth century, monastic foundations were increasingly favoured by the elite. By the time of Lorsch’s foundation the surrounding countryside was dotted with small family monasteries, nunneries and proprietary churches (to the extent that the three can be clearly distinguished). The charters also witness a growing number of small basilicas in the rural communities, often built of wood but sometimes of stone, in the eighth and ninth centuries, the earliest dating back to the seventh century.27 These processes supply an important context in which the charters of pious gifts can be placed. A society in which rural elites were increasingly prepared to invest in a local church or a family monastery was one in which they might also be prepared to make donations to large-scale monastic foundations to build up their local prestige. Most aristocratic church foundations were foci of family identity, the points around which kin groups crystallised; many were little more than ‘house’ monasteries, little bigger than the average elite household, with perhaps a dozen inmates, led by a family member.28 Daughters and widows often found themselves at the head of such communities, under the protection of a lay relative, a father, brother or son; in the charters such women are frequently styled deo sacrata, implying that they had sworn to live by a set of precepts including celibacy. This made sense in view of the importance of women as conduits of family memory. In the early Lorsch and Fulda charters we see a series of tiny foundations, 27\n\n28\n\nK.

See Bosl, Franken um , pp. –, –. Friese, ‘Einzugsbereich’, p.  notes the contrast between foundations like Lorsch and Fulda, which attract wide-scale patronage, and more familyoriented abbeys such as Schäftlarn in Bavaria. Certainly the landholdings of Amorbach in the eleventh century, or even Seligenstadt in the tenth century, suggest that they were attracting patronage on a very different scale to Lorsch. See W. Störmer, ‘Die Reichskirche im SpessartOdenwald-Gebiet von der Karolinger bis zur Salierzeit’, Jahrbuch für fränkische Landesforschung  (), –.\n\n\n\nState and society in the early middle ages notably convents at Baumerlenbach and Roden, each headed by a daughter and given to Lorsch in the s; Fulda received similar communities such as the nunnery at Milz, headed by the redoubtable Emhild.29 That is, these early monastic structures were shaped by familial relationships, as they in turn offered elite families new strategies for the reproduction of power. In the eighth century, they contributed to a distinctive religious culture which has left traces in the record of manuscript production, and in texts such as the nun Huneburc of Heidenheim’s Lives of her relatives, Willibald of Eichstätt and Wynnebald of Heidenheim.30 By the ninth century, the kind of small, familial establishment in which women could play an important role was no longer so prominent. Already at Chrodegang’s Gorze, Carolingian reform emphasised large-scale, ordered, male monasticism focused on the liturgy of the mass, an emphasis which was to be redoubled by the triumph, with royal backing, of Benedict of Aniane’s brand of monasticism in the first quarter of the ninth century.31 The gifts of family houses to the monks of Lorsch and Fulda, visible in the charters, mark the start of the process by which an edifice of discipline and jurisdiction was constructed, with resultant changes in religious culture as a whole, and in the role of women in particular. By the s the Fulda monk Rudolf, in his Life of Leoba (a relative of Boniface’s who had headed a small nunnery at Tauberbischofsheim on the Main), presented a sanitised version of earlier tradition designed not to conflict with the decrees of Carolingian reformers.32 Even eighth-century foundations were not wholly female, but they represented monasticism on a different scale, and with a different rationale, from that offered by the great all-male houses of the Carolingian 29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\nCL , , also ; UBF ().

The type of structure that the charters describe can be envisaged in more detail thanks to the excavation of the monastic cella built by one Hafti and his family in the middle of the eighth century at Esslingen on the upper Neckar. The complex was based around a stone nave approximately . by . m, under which eighteen burials, sixteen adults and two children, were found. Just as Lorsch had initially been given to Chrodegang, so Esslingen was given by Hafti to Abbot Fulrad of SaintDenis.33 Given the intense pressure on family resources that even such a modest foundation created, the giving of such a community to the likes of Fulrad or Chrodegang, or to a great abbey such as Lorsch or Fulda, made sense. After all, these local churches continued to exist, and maintained their links with the families of their founders, but now they were part of a wider and more potent network of prayer centred upon a great abbey. Only the grandest foundations were able to continue as selfsufficient entities for more than a couple of generations. Hornbach, for example, was founded at a strategic site on the Blies by a powerful local family in co-operation with St Pirmin in the early eighth century, but throughout its existence housed tens rather than hundreds of monks; its inmates and patrons were predominantly associates of the founder’s family.34 Because they were larger, Lorsch and Fulda took in far more child recruits, thus relating to more communities and kindreds.35 They offered spiritual patronage to wide, and relatively well-defined, catchment areas. It is remarkable that Lorsch received donations primarily in the middle Rhine and the region immediately east of the Rhine from Hesse to Alemannia, but only limited gifts in the Moselle and Liège areas, where its founders also had kin, interests and contacts. This neatly complemented the interests of Chrodegang’s Gorze: whereas Gorze received land which lay mainly in the Moselle and the area to the west, Lorsch’s holdings began on the other side of the Hunsrück, in the Rhine valley, and spread east and south-east from there.36 The scope of Lorsch’s eastern holdings was defined by the interests of its founders and their contacts. Cancor was active as a Frankish agent in Alemannia in the middle of the 33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\nSee G. P. Fehring and F.

He was active alongside Ruthard, the Frankish agent in the newly conquered duchy. Ruthard was, like Cancor, close to Chrodegang. He granted estates in the Moselle valley to Gorze and founded monasteries at Amorbach, close by Lorsch on the Main, and at Gengenbach on the east bank of the upper Rhine, the latter like Lorsch given to Chrodegang and staffed by Gorze monks.37 Lorsch’s acquisition of holdings along the upper Rhine and the lower Neckar underlines the importance of Cancor’s contacts, particularly those with Ruthard, for the new foundation.38 The abbey’s extensive holdings further to the north, but still east of the Rhine, above all in Hesse, owed more to Cancor’s own family interests. Here the key figures may have been Cancor’s mother, and another relation, Swicgar, active as a Frankish agent in Hesse – perhaps the same Swicgar who had extensive interests on the Bavarian frontier and who worked hand in hand with Boniface’s follower, Willibald, in establishing the landed base for the diocese of Eichstätt.39 The mechanisms by which these landholdings east of the Rhine were acquired are suggested by the activities of another of Cancor’s contacts, Abbot Fulrad of Saint-Denis. Fulrad was one of the key figures in Frankish politics in the east in the mid-eighth century, and was close to Cancor’s father and to Ruthard. His will, drawn up in , indicates that he had inherited substantial estates in the Alsace–Alemannia borderlands, estates which he had supplemented by attracting gifts both in the vicinity of his inherited estates and east of the Rhine from local men eager to receive his patronage, including, indeed, Hafti, who handed the church at Esslingen over to Fulrad. Esslingen was one of a series of monastic cells which were the focal points of Fulrad’s property, and which Fulrad, in turn, in his will, handed on to the monastery of SaintDenis in Paris. These property links facilitated the political and ecclesiastical integration of Alsace and Alemannia into the Frankish realm.40 Whether those who gave him land and monastic cells expected them to end up in the hands of Saint-Denis is unclear: t"
