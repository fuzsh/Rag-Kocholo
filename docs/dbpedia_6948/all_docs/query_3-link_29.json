        "text": "\"Until the 19th century, Freinsheim had two entrances, the Eisentor in the north-east of the city and the Haintor in the south-west. The name Haintor probably comes from its orientation towards a small chestnut grove in front of the gates of Freinsheim. The gate system originally built also included a front gate with a kennel and two towers, which were demolished in the 19th century due to dilapidation.The tower is 15 m high and had one more storey before the Palatinate War of Succession.A drop gate, which is not today functional and only attached for decoration, was in earlier times an important component to protect the residents at night and from possible attacks The gates were already closed From this event, the phrase is still known to us today, but it is seen more in the sense of the fear of not getting to know the desired partner in time. If you leave the city through the Haintor in a westerly direction, you have a view of the Bismarck Tower and the almost 500 m high Peterskopf in the Palatinate Forest. Not far from there is the \"Lindemannsruh\", a tourist restaurant that was named after the former head forester Lindemann. We owe it to him that the chestnuts that the Romans brought to this region are still in such large numbers.\"\n\nSource: pfalz.de/de/sehenswuerdigkeit/freinsheim-haintor"
