        "text": "There are many different ways available from beginners up to hiking pros – all offering spectacular views into the Alps. Drive to B308/Jochstraße and turn right. After you passed the sign “Oberjoch” you will shortly see the chairlift “Iselerbahn”. Take this to the top station. (There is also a bus operating from near the hotel to Oberjoch)\n\nShort course:\n\nDuration: 50 min by foot (one way), level: easy to moderate\n\nStarting at the top station there is a very idyllic hiking path to the top of the mountain. Enjoy the stunning view (there are about 400 mountain peeks to be seen).\n\nNice start into hiking season\n\nDuration: 3 hours by foot, level: moderate\n\nStarting point not finishing point (public transportation available) You are starting at top station in the direction of the top of the mountain. Not far beneath the peek, about 50 m after the sign “Startpunkt Standard Abfahrtslauf” there is a path (direction Zipfelsalpe) on the right hand side. (about 1 ½ h). Take this until you reach “Zipfelsalp” (alpine hut). Relax and enjoy food and something to drink. After that you take the serpentines to Hinterstein (1-2 h). In Hinterstein you can take the bus to Bad Hindelang (switch at final station). Then switch to the bus “Bad Hindelang – Oberjoch” (stop: Iselerbahn). This is the place you parked your car (if you did!)\n\nIt is possible to walk from Hinterstein to the hotel, if you still have energy left. Basically you walk at the bottom of Iseler. Take the small street at the church “Sangenweg”, follow it to “Bärenweg” which will lead to “Pfad der Liebe/Vaterlandsweg” which leads all the way back to the hotel. (1-1 ½ h). Please always take a map with you.\n\nUphill there are two alternative routes:\n\na) Walk along the hotel area in the direction of the outdoor pool and follow the path uphill (“Liebespfad”). Turn left at the small bridge (to “Schleierfall”). You can follow the path to end and see a nice waterfall or take the first branch left on the “Bergwachtweg” in the direction of the “Gailenberg”. Cross the little canyon named “Hirschbachtobel” and follow the path. Above Hindelang, before reaching Gailenberg, take the uphill path to “Steinköpfle” in the direction of “Hirschberg”.\n\nb) Leave the hotel through the main entrance and follow the path on the righthand side (some metres behind our parking lot) along the “Hirschbachtobel” to the “Hirschberg”. This is a stunning trail, but you should have a good head for heights and be sure-footed. Do not take this path in case of rain or shortly afterwards - in the winter months this path is closed.\n\nDownhill there are also two alternative routes:\n\nc) Duration: 4 hours (up and down), level: moderate (partly very steep)\n\nWalk route a) backwards or take the nice path from Hirschberg to the mountain hut “Hirschalpe”. From here a steep road leads in the direction of Bad Oberdorf.\n\nd) Duration: 5 to 6 hours (up and down), level: moderate\n\nWalk from “Hirschberg” to “Klankalpe” which offers excellent cakes and hearty snacks. From here you can take the path directly down to Bad Hindelang - either return via the path „Kellerwandweg“ to „Hirschbachtobel“, or a little lower via „Luitpoldhöhe“ and the panoramic „Cafe Polite“. At „Klankalpe“, if you did not get enough yet, you can continue the path to Hirschalpe and continue as in „c“.\n\nBoth descents are quite steep and hiking poles are a blessing for you knees.\n\nDuration: 2 hours by foot starting in Hinterstein. Level: easy\n\nThis is a perfect walk to experience our flowery meadows, our mountains and our wild nature.\n\nDrive to Hinterstein and park your car at the parking lot at the end of town. There is a small path downhill (coming from Hinterstein town it is to the right hand side). You will cross a street „Im Schlauchen“ and turn right. After a few meters you will see - on the left hand side - a little path into a meadow (there is a little kiosk as well). Follow this path until its end and turn left. The walk follows the river „Ostrach“ upstream. Please cross this river at the first bridge „Vorsäßbrücke“ you reach. Follow the signs in the direction of „Hölle Rundweg“. This leads you uphill, the path is becoming steeper later on. There is a small creek alongside you on the way up. You will reach the very idyllic place called the „Eckbacktobel“. Steep metallic stairs take you on the bridge to cross the stream. At this point you can see lady’s-slipper (an orchid) in May or June. Looking back you will see the face of a devil in the stony wall: “Hölle” means hell after all. Follow the path out of the ravine. Now you are walking through a forest and passing an old massive landslide. The way leads you back to the Eckbach and to Hinterstein.\n\nAn idyllic trail passing a ridge with blue berries and moorlands. There are capercaillies and black grouses around. Feels like far away from civilization. Enjoy the mountain view and relax.\n\nDuration: 2-5 hours, level: easy to moderate.\n\nDepending on planned route you might not end up at your starting point.\n\nDrive in the direction of Bad Hindelang/Sonthofen. Turn right at Tiefenbacher Straße (signs to Reckenberg/Tiefenbach) and follow this streeton the lefthand side. The road goes steadily uphill. On the way there is a machine to collect your „Maut“ (fee to pass the rest of the street, looks like a parking machine). Collect a ticket an put it behind your front shield and follow the street further uphill. Park your car at the parking space (there is a sign showing you that you are not allowed to drive any further).\n\nNow you can hike uphill the paved road (1/2 h) or take the little path through the forest (no sign available). This is starting at the left-hand side of the parking lot and is visible from there. Both ways take you through a forest up to „Tiefenbacher Eck“. Take a rest there and enjoy the nature around you. There is a way down to „Hirschalpe“ via „Steinpassattel „to „Unterjoch“, which we do not recommend. Take the same way back (which brings you to your car) or turn north in the direction of „Wertacher Hörnle (which is a small mountain). This way is not signed but mostly visible. 50 minutes later you can take a shortcut down to Unterjoch passing alpine meadows (sign saying „Unterjoch“). We like the latter way best, which brings you the whole way to Wertacher Hörnle (40 min), because it offers a stunning view. Follow the path downhill passing alpine meadows and follow it further on when it turns to a gravel path. At the end there is a steep road to Unterjoch „Buchelalpe“ (approx. 1 h). If your hike takes you to Unterjoch: We recommend to take a cab to Breiten (at the beginning) or have a second car at the hotel (to pick up the first one at Breiten). This way you can take the bus from Unterjoch to Sonthofen or Bad Hindelang (stop: DAV Jubi which is close to the hotel). Please take the bus timetable and a map with you.\n\nThis short and romantic walk, starting directly at the end of our outdoor spa area will lead you to an impressive waterfall called „Schleierfall“. We like it best during or after a rainy day.\n\nWaterfall (both ways)\n\nDuration:: ¾ -1 hour, level: beginner\n\nStart at our outside gate (after the outdoor pool) and follow the path. After a while there is a brigde, turn left here. In case of doubt there are signs showing the way.\n\nWaterfall and „Hirschbachtobel“ (ravine)\n\nDuration: 2 ½ hours , level: moderate\n\nTo get to the waterfall follow the instructions above. Afterwards walk the same way back until you see a path on the right hand side. Follow this in the direction of Cafe Polite. You will reach the Wildbachtobel and follow the path streight on across the bridge. In order to get to the Hirschbachtobel you need to cross a street (Jochstraße). After a while you reach Hirschbachtobel and follow the path downhill. Now you have to read the signs. We recommend visiting Cafe Polite and returning to the hotel through the Hirschbachtobel (downhill) afterwards. The easiest way to do so is to turn left when you reach another street and follow it until you see our sign. The nicer way is walking through Bad Oberdorf.\n\nPlease take good care especially after rainfalls the path might by slippery.\n\nA nice hike to a plateau – passing a highmoor, walking by several mountains. In the end you will be rewarded by an inviting terrasse, Bavarian bread and cheese/sausages or something to drink.\n\nShort route for beginners\n\nDuration: 1 – 1 ½ hour by foot (both ways), level: easy\n\nDrive by car from Bad Hindelang in the direction of Sonthofen (B308). Before Sonthofen there is a branch off to „Imberg“ on the left hand side. Take this and follow the street. You will have to pay some Euro to follow it further on (Mautstraße). There is a blue machine to pay the fare on the right hand side. Close to the end of the road you see one building uphill and one parking place downhill. Take the branch off (right hand side) downhill and park your car. From there it is an approx. ½ hour walk on a street (without cars). The last 300 metres it is more stony an slightly uphill to Straußbergalpe. Apart from these last meters the trail is suitable for baby buggys as well.\n\nLonger route, more advanced\n\nDuration: 2-3 hours by foot, level: easy to a bit advanced.\n\nDrive from the Hotel in the direction of Bad Hindelang and further on until the roundabout. Take the 4th exit in the direction of Hinterstein. Shortly afterwards you will see the „Hornbahn“ (cable car). Park your car there and take the cable car up the mountain „Imberger Horn“. The cable car is a 30 minutes walk from the hotel so you do not need the car, really. There is a hiking path which brings you to Straußbergalpe (very nice hut in the middle of nature, between the mountains.) If you take a detour up to Imberger Horn the trip will take up to three hours.\n\n*Please check opening hours and timetable of Hornbahn in advance (expecially important to not miss the last cable car back to Bad Hindelang).\n\nTake a short walk to one of the most beautiful alpine huts with a sunny terrasse which is offering Bavarian specialties like bread, cheese, butter, milk and cake, all home made (they do have their own cows).\n\nDuration 45 minutes, level: easy to moderate.\n\nIt is possible to park at the alpine hut directly (2 minutes walk) Drive via Bad Hindelang to Sonthofen and follow the signs to „Gunzesried“ from there. Park your car at the parking lot at the beginning of Gunzesried. Pass the little gate that seems to lead nowhere and cross the meadow to the very nice path along the Aubach and its ravine in the direction of „Stausee“- water reservoir. After that take the branch off to „Alpe Derb“. It is the same way to return (takes longer!) or you take the street in the direction of Gunzesried (not a lot of traffic).\n\nIdeal for familys with small kids or nature lovers with special needs (parking lot at hut available).\n\nOur thought:\n\nSee Neuschwanstein from outside and Hohenschwangau from inside.\n\nWe admit: Neuschwanstein castle (the original of Disney’s Cinderella castle) is very impressive, from inside and outside. And we do understand if you like to see it no matter what. But it can be very crowded, especially at rainy days. So if you really would like to visit it, please book tickets in advance. You need to do so 2 days in advance (3pm): https://www.hohenschwangau.de/765.0.html Personally we recommend to visit Hohenschwangau Castle from the inside and Neuschwanstein from the outside. Hohenschwangau was built by Max II based on original plans to replace a broken castle named „Schwanstein“. He built it neo-Gothic. Ludwig II was raised here and used it later on during summertime and added his own taste later on. It offers a stunning view on Neuschwanstein castle. You can book tickets at the same link (see above) or even use the combi ticket for both castles.\n\nHow to get there:\n\nIt is about 1 hour to Füssen, where both castles are (at least close to): Turn right at B308/Jochstraße and follow the signs to „Füssen“ (310, OA8, 209, 310). Drive throuqh Füssen in the direction of Schwangau „Schloss Hohenschwangau“ or follow the signs to „Schloss Neuschwanstein“.\n\nBy the way:\n\nFüssen itself is a nice town with old center. There is a lake „Hopfensee“ which offers nice views on Neuschwanstein. But like the castle itself it is quite crowded.\n\nWalk into the ravine (well prepared, secure path) and see waterfalls, deep canyons and stony walls around you. It is most impressive during or after rain. But beware: it might be slippery.\n\nThere are different ways to get back:\n\ntake the same way downhill\n\nwe like roundtrips best i.e. we take the path to “Dornachalpe” at the top of the ravine. There you can eat and drinks something and enjoy the nice view. From there it is a short trip downhill back to your car. Do not forget water resistant clothing and hiking shoes.\n\nHow to get there (30 min by car):\n\nDrive up the Andreas-Gross-Str. and turn left to B308, in the direction of Bad Hindelang/Sonthofen. Follow this street until you see signs to B19 Oberstdorf and follow them until close to Oberstdorf. Just before the Mc Donalds there is a street (right hand side) in the direction of “Tiefenbach”. Follow this street and follow the signs to “Breitachklamm”.\n\nOur tip: Be early on rainy days because it will be quite crowded. Please check opening hours and prices before leaving the hotel.\n\nThis is the only cave in the Allgaeu you can walk through – a real adventure. Over 300 steps bring you down to the inner chamber, where you can see very special stone formations, built in millions of years. There are many myths told about this place Guided tours available regularly. Temperature all year long about 4 degree Celsius.\n\nHow to get there (about 25 min):\n\nDrive up the Andreas-Gross-Str. and turn left to B308, in the direction of Bad Hindelang/Sonthofen. Follow this street until you see signs to B19 Oberstdorf and follow them until Fischen. In Fischen you will see a sign to „Obermaiselstein“. Follow this sign until you reach „Obermaiselstein“ and park your car at „Haus des Gastes“ (left hand side). Walk back some meters to the fire departement. There you will see a sign, which leads you directly to „Sturmannshöhle“. Walking distance about 30 min. Or try to get a parking space (only few available) directly at the cave.\n\n* Please check opening hours before departure.\n\nDuration: 1-2 h walking time.\n\nBeautiful walk through a forest (holds back some rain) with small waterfalls and idyllic nature.\n\nHow to get there:\n\nDrive Andreas-Gross-Str. uphill and turn left at B308 in the direction of Bad Hindelang/Sonthofen. Drive through Sonthofen and Bihlerdorf and turn left at the sign which leads you to “Gunzesried”. Drive through Gunzesried and park at the big parking space shortly before “Gunzesried Säge”. Walk some metres on the street, cross the little bridge and turn left at the first street. You will see a little archway on the left hand side. This is the entrance to the ravine. Follow the path as long as you like and take the same way return or until “Buhls Alpe” and following the way there back to the parking space. Please take hiking shoes with you. It might be slippery.\n\nThere are many ways to enjoy a rainy day in Kempten. Especially the city centre offers some nice little corners and some interesting sights. The space around city hall and the pedestrian area invites you to stroll around and do some shopping.\n\nThe “Residence” is worth a visit.\n\nOriginally it was built by the Benedictines and destroyed during the war in the 17th century. 1652 it was rebuilt as one of the first monumental monastery buildings. The interior is magnificent and special due to its religious and non-religious elements. It can be visited during opening hours.*\n\nIf it is raining too much to stay outside you can visit the “Heimatmuseum” (museum of local history), which is situated in a nice baroque building.\n\nVery special:\n\nKempten was founded 2000 years ago and might be the oldest German city (there is a friendly debate between Kempten and the much larger Trier which is the oldest German city – we know Kempten is older and so do you, now). “Cambodunum” is an archaeological park showing what is left from Roman times (partly open space, partly in buildings)\n\nHow to get there: 30 min\n\nDrive Andreas-Gross-Str. uphill. Turn left in the direction of Bad Hindelang/Sonthofen. Follow this street until there is a right turn on B19 in the direction of Kempten. Stay on B19 and follow the signs to Kempten city center. Park your car at one of the parking spaces.\n\n* Please check opening hours at the hotel reception.\n\nDuration: 2 1/2 hours, Level: moderate with some alpine parts.\n\nWalk to the entrance of our parking space and follow the road approx. 50 meters straight (do not turn left). There is a little path on the right hand side, just before a bridge. Follow it uphill, alongside the creek. Enjoy the green light breaking through the leaves and all the birds chirping. In order to not miss the path bringing you to the most beautiful part of the tour, please always follow the signs to \"Wildbachtobel\" which will impress you with its beautiful waterfalls. There are a couple of more alpine parts, so please mind your step. Once you reach the paved road, we recommend to use this to walk downhill back to our hotel. If you are still up for more hiking, there is a wonderful alpine hut \"Ochsenalpe\" just 20 Minutes uphill - to the right. Please do not walk the \"Wildbachtobel\" downhill as it is far more dangerous.\n\nDuration: 1 ½ h or 3-5 h on foot, level: moderate\n\nNice tour to enjoy winter feelings and as a reward some sledding. Start at the parking space at Hinterstein and drive by bus to Giebelhaus . First thing at Giebelhaus: enjoy the view. It is amazing. Afterwards walk uphill following the signs to “Schwarzenberghütte”. You can rent a sledge their, we recommend to take it from our hotel. And then: take your sledge and drive downhill. This is really fun.\n\nHow to get there: 10 min drive\n\nTurn left at the end of the parking space (Luitpold-Str.). Follow this street until „Kurze Gasse“. Turn left there. Follow it until its end and turn left on„Hintersteiner Str.“. Follow this street until its end and turn left in the direction of Hinterstein. Drive through Hinterstein and park you car at the big parking space “Auf der Höhe”. Walk or take the bus from there to Giebelhaus. Signs will show you the way.\n\nFor all who love sledding. It is offering 3km sledding paths on 3 different routes, which makes it a lot fun. We do have some sledges to let (free of charge). There are some at the cable car sation as well (with charge).\n\nOur tip:\n\nEspecially during German school holidays it might get crowded. It makes sense to be quite early to reduce waiting time. But do not worry: The cable car is quite efficient. Usually even long lines are not too bad.\n\nHot to get there (5 min by car)\n\nDrive Andreas-Gross-Str uphill and turn left to B308. Drive through Bad Hindelang and take the 4th exit at the roundabout (sign to Hinterstein). Follow this road until you see the cable car station on the right hand side).\n\nIt is a beautiful low cost sledding trip (you only buy the bus ticket). The “old Jochstraße” which is parallel to the new B308/Jochstraße is a very popular sledding road for locals (no cars aloud). It offers amazing nature and a lot of fun. The end of the sledding road is very close to the hotel (at Andreas-Gross-Str. close to the little bridge).\n\nIf you feel like more exercise: Certainly you can walk the same way uphill (which you will drive downhill later on). Walk from the hotel on Andreas-Gross-Str. cross the little bridge, walk about 100m and take the road on the right hand side uphill. Our hotel has some sledges for you free of charge. Just ask at the reception.\n\nHow to get there: (15 min drive by bus)\n\nTake the regular bus to Oberjoch which starts at the end of Andreas-Gross-Str. (where it meets B308/Jochstraße, 5 min walk). Buy a ticket from the driver. Our reception team will gladly give you advice on timings. Get of at the station “Oberjoch” and walk back some metres along the street until you see a little path. Take this path and the sledding fun will start soon afterwards. Please ask for snow conditions before departing.\n\nDrive towards Unterjoch from Oberjoch. Shortly after the „Spieserlifte“, you will find a small hiking parking lot on the left side. That's where our excursion begins.\n\nTake a leisurely walk of about 40 minutes along the gentle switchbacks towards Buchelalpe. Beneath the snow, there's a road that you'll later sled down. Don't worry, the route is moderate, both uphill and when sledding. For those who prefer not to pull sleds, there are shortcuts through the forest marked by little elves that can lift your spirits, especially the ones of the smaller participants.\n\nUpon reaching the top, you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking view. Enjoy the sustainable and delicious food on the sun terrace. Our personal highlight is the vegan curry, but of course, the choice is yours.\n\nAnd then, it's time to head back down!\n\nOur recommendation:\n\nBe there early or in the late afternoon. Parking can be challenging as early as 10 AM. You can borrow sleds for free from us.\n\nOpening hours, please check in advance\n\nNov/De/Mar/Apr: Sat/Sun, 11:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\n26the Dec – Mid March: Fri/Sat/Sun/Mon, 11:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nIn the Allgäu region, there are not only many ski slopes but also wonderful cross-country skiing trails. We find cross-country skiing from the valley of Bad Hindelang to Hinterstein (in the Allgäuer Hochalpen Nature Park) to be particularly scenic.\n\nIn the high-altitude area of Oberjoch, you have access to the Allgäu-Tirol Ski Trail with 90 km of freestyle and double-track trails.\n\nOur recommendation:\n\nCross-country skiing at the Hornbahn Hindelang. They now have artificial snow and evening illumination, allowing you to pursue your hobby at unconventional times.\n\nYou can receive a printed overview map of the surrounding cross-country skiing trails from the reception at our hotel. We are also happy to help you find a provider for rental equipment.\n\nThe Moor Loop, including the additional \"Kögls Hütte\" loop, is also open until 9:00 PM on Thursdays.\n\nEvery Thursday: Night skiing at the Iselerbahn and Idealhanglift from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM."
