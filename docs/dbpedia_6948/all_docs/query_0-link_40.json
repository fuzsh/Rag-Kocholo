        "text": "Start of dialog content\n\nHow guest reviews work\n\nEach review score is between 1-10. To get the overall score that you see, we add up all the review scores we’ve received and divide that total by the number of review scores we’ve received. We are currently testing a weighted review system in Malta and Iceland (excluding hotel and vacation rental chains). For properties in these countries, the more recent the review, the bigger the impact on the total review score calculation. In addition, guests can give separate ‘subscores’ in crucial areas, such as location, cleanliness, staff, comfort, facilities, value for money and free Wi-Fi. Note that guests submit their subscores and their overall scores independently, so there’s no direct link between them.\n\nYou can review an Accommodation that you booked through our Platform if you stayed there or if you arrived at the property but didn’t actually stay there. To edit a review you’ve already submitted, please contact our Customer Service team.\n\nWe have people and automated systems that specialise in detecting fake reviews submitted to our Platform. If we find any, we delete them and, if necessary, take action against whoever is responsible.\n\nAnyone else who spots something suspicious can always report it to our Customer Service team, so our Fraud team can investigate.\n\nIdeally, we would publish every review we receive, whether positive or negative. However, we won’t display any review that includes or refers to (among other things):\n\nPolitically sensitive comments\n\nPromotional content\n\nIllegal activities\n\nPersonal or sensitive information (e.g. emails, phone numbers or credit card info)\n\nSwear words, sexual references, hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, or references to violence\n\nSpam and fake content\n\nAnimal cruelty\n\nImpersonation (e.g. if the writer is claiming to be someone else)\n\nAny violation of our review guidelines.\n\nTo make sure reviews are relevant, we may only accept reviews that are submitted within 3 months of checking out, and we may stop showing reviews once they’re 36 months old – or if the Accommodation has a change of ownership.\n\nAn Accommodation may choose to reply to a review.\n\nWhen you see multiple reviews, the most recent ones will be at the top, subject to a few other factors (what language a review is in, whether it’s just a rating or contains comments as well, etc.). If you like, you can sort and/or filter them (by time of year, review score, etc.).\n\nWe sometimes show external review scores from other well-known travel websites. We make it clear when we’ve done this.\n\nGuidelines and standards for Reviews\n\nThese guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly without limiting expression of strong opinions. They are also applicable regardless of the sentiment of the comment.\n\nContributions should be travel related. The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.\n\nContributions should be appropriate for a global audience. Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include 'hate speech', discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, and the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.\n\nAll content should be genuine and unique to the guest. Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.\n\nRespect the privacy of others. Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and similar details.\n\nThe opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.\n\nBy default, reviews are sorted based on the date of the review and on additional criteria to display the most relevant reviews, including but not limited to: your language, reviews with text, and non-anonymous reviews. Additional sorting options may be available (by type of traveller, by score, etc.).\n\nTranslations disclaimer\n\nThis service may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.\n\nEnd of dialog content"
