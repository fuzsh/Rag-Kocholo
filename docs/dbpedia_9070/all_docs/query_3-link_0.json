        "text": "See also: Alesha (album)\n\nAlesha (born Alesha Marie Grafton; March 14, 1982) is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. She is noted for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production and songwriting. Alesha began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights in the Manchester area. She secured a record deal with breathemusic in 2003, followed by the release of her debut album Look Out Below (2003). Alesha was voted Best New Artist at the 7th Urapopstar Awards, although her early career was marked by varying levels of success. A series of hit singles from Buried Underneath (2005) transitioned Alesha into global recognition.\n\nAlesha Is the Queen (2007) is widely considered Alesha's true commercial breakthrough, sparking controversy with a string of banned music videos. She followed it with a series of successful records, including Urapopstar Award winners Bigger Than God (2009) and Alesha (2014) and double diamond best-sellers afterhours (2015) and The White Album (2016). Alesha amassed more number one singles in her career than any other artist, including the diamond hits \"The Last Temptation\", \"In Love Today\", \"Winter\", and \"Mortal\" and signature songs such as \"Fashion Kills\", \"Disciplinary\", \"Apocalypse City\", \"Number One\", and \"Dove\". Famed for her songwriting, both individually and alongside recurring collaborator Shell Ruin, Alesha also composed hits for a number of artists.\n\nAlesha's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as Prime Cut (2011), Exile in Nashville (2016), and A Problem (2019). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in A Problem. She made her directorial debut with Putanovska and Shell Ruin's music video \"Burning the Candle (At Both Ends)\" (2020). As a businesswoman, Alesha co-founded Holy Trinity Entertainment in 2010; it includes Holy Trinity Music Group, one of the most successful artist-run labels in history. Her other ventures include fashion brands, memoirs, and miscellaneous television work.\n\nHaving sold an estimated 300 million records worldwide, Alesha is one of the best-selling music artists in history. With a revenue of over U.S. $1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time. Alesha's accolades include 28 Urapopstar Awards, including a special merit award for \"Artist of the Decade\" in 2010, and induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She has also been included in several Forbes power rankings and ranked number one on VH1's Greatest Women in Music (2012). Aside from music and acting, Alesha is noted for her political views, philanthropic endeavors, sexual fluidity, and social activism, including LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS prevention.\n\nLife and career[edit | edit source]\n\n1982-2006: Beginnings and breakthrough[edit | edit source]\n\nAlesha Grafton was born in Trafford, England, on 14 March, 1982. She is the youngest daughter of Dennis Grafton and Louise Grafton (née Veronica). Her mother abandoned the family while Alesha was still an infant. Alesha has one sibling, Maria Grafton (born 1982). Their father married Patricia Hearst when Alesha was seven. Her stepsister, Phoebe Hearst, rose to prominence on her own accord as a member of the all-female band Innocent. The Grafton family was lower-middle class and frequently attended church as devout Anglicans.\n\nAccording to an official biography, Alesha first became interested in singing after she saw a Karlie Minogway music video on TV at the age of three. She started attending lessons with a vocal coach, as well as taking part in ballet, jazz, and modern dance classes. At the private Christian school Alesha attended, she began developing a rebellious attitude and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behaviour. Over the next few years, Alesha had already begun to involve herself in the Manchester club scene. Alesha has revealed that she first started doing drugs when she was only thirteen. In 2001, at the age of seventeen, Alesha moved to a bedsit in downtown Manchester and became the singer and face of underground dance-rock act Soho Kills. The band was approached by multiple independent record labels in 2002. Unhappy with the musical direction and stylistic choices of Soho Kills, Alesha left the band to pursue a solo music career. She toured a number of Manchester clubs, singing her own compositions as well as Sophie Ellis-Beckham and Hailey Klass covers.\n\nAlesha was approached by a breathemusic representative after being sighted performing at open mic nights and smaller venues across Manchester. Alesha signed a two-album record deal with the label in the summer of 2003. Alesha released her debut album Look Out Below (as Alesha Grafton) in October 2003. She wrote all of the album's lyrics herself, enlisting breathemusic's in-house producers and Mars/Venus member MC Labels for production. The lead single \"Predictable\" was a surprise success, peaking at number six; however, the album failed to enter the top ten. Alesha released duets with 4tune and Larynx Trasher; the latter became Alesha's first top five single. Alesha was named Best Newcomer at the 7th Urapopstar Awards. As the public became more aware of Alesha, her private life began to receive media attention. In January 2004, Alesha and Ben Parker announced their engagement and confirmed that Alesha was four months pregnant. In May 2004, Alesha, then 20, gave birth to her first child Ana-Marie Roxanne Parker. Alesha wed Parker the following month and assumed his surname.\n\nIn August 2004, Alesha released her second studio album Hungry for More with a more sexualized image. Hailey Klass, Ivy, MC Labels and Tasha contributed their penmanship to the album. The album was an initial success, nearly outselling Alesha's debut record in half of the time. Both the album and its lead single \"Let Me Take You There\" peaked at number two. However, promotion of the record came to a halt following the poor reception of second single \"It Sucks to Be Me\" (later famously covered by Gingers+Jesus). Alesha starred in the low–budget film Let Me Tell You How I Died, a teen thriller based on the novel of the same. Alesha featured on Kandi’s risqué hit “Midweek Sex\" alongside CeCe Winston. Alesha began writing and recording material for her new album, signing with Ensemble Entertainment.\n\nAlesha's third studio album Buried Underneath (2005) marked a clear change in direction for Alesha with its guitar-oriented sound. Its singles \"Infernal Superstar\" and the Neyssa duet \"Close the Door\"/\"He's Done It Again\" became Alesha's first number one singles, helping the album to peak at number one. Buried Underneath eventually outsold Alesha's first two albums combined. After months of tabloids reporting marital problems, Ben Parker filed for divorce in July 2005. It was speculated and later confirmed that Alesha and Neyssa were a gay couple. The pair co-hosted the 12th Urapopstar Awards, a controversial choice by producers. In May 2006, Alesha and Neyssa welcomed their first child, Maribba Nikia Kurdadze, carried by Alesha and conceived via sperm donor (Neyssa's biological brother). Alesha released her first greatest hits collection, Chic/Freak, and took part in the first ever Tango Challenge.\n\n2007-2009: Alesha Is the Queen, The Second Coming and Bigger Than God[edit | edit source]\n\nAlesha released her fourth studio album Alesha Is the Queen in 2007, representing a departure from her earlier work. As executive producer, Alesha wrote and produced a large portion of the album autonomously, while enlisting songwriting from mentor Buffi and peer Kati as well as guest vocals from Josie Matthews and Neyssa. These efforts resulted in a primarily pop record that also displayed electroclash, hip-hop, and indie influences. The album explores lyrical themes of fame, fashion, partying, and wealth, as well as heartbreak and love. The recording of the album and its launch was chronicled by MTV in a documentary of the same name. The album debuted at number one and was eventually certified diamond (a first for Alesha), selling 1.75 million copies. Alesha Is the Queen was awarded Best Album at the 14th Urapopstar Awards.\n\nThe album's lead single \"Fashion Kills\", inspired by Giorgio Moroder, became Alesha's third number one single after an extensive promotional campaign. It has been said that it \"heralded a new era of success\" for Alesha by The Guardian. Alesha cultivated an increasingly provocative image while promoting the record, marked by a brief stint in rehab, a banned music video for \"London Brat\" and the controversial single \"Power Power\" with Buffi, Shell Ruin and Taylor Brookes. Despite initial hype, the release of \"Power Power\" suffered extreme setbacks as all four artists received criticism for controversial behavior, such as emulating the appearance of Myra Hindley. The song failed to even enter the top ten. Alesha targeted a new audience with the fifth single from Alesha Is the Queen. \"The OH in Ohio\", inspired by crunk music, and \"Candy Cigarettes\", a darker electro-ballad, were chosen. Alesha performed \"The OH in Ohio\" at the 14th Urapopstar Awards and created a clothing line for high street chain River Island.\n\nWhile recording her fifth studio album, Alesha released The Good That Won't Come Out, a collection of demos, outtakes and rarities to celebrate Alesha's five years in the industry. The album was accompanied by \"Diamonds & Dollar Bills\", a collaboration with Putanovska. Both the single and the album entered the charts at number one. Alesha also performed a live acoustic Unplugged concert for MTV to accompany The Good That Won't Come Out. Furthermore, Alesha and Neyssa finally married on June 22, 2008 in Los Angeles, after same-sex marriage was (briefly) legalized in California. Alesha assumed Neyssa's surname, Kurdadze, although continued releasing music under the mononym Alesha.\n\nAlesha released her fifth studio album The Second Coming in 2008, taking aspects of religious iconography and fashioning them into secular, often sacrilegious pop songs such as \"Jesus Christ Supermodel\", \"Original Sin\" and \"Crucify\". Alesha was condemned by the Vatican, particularly for referring to herself as the Messiah. Written and produced in collaboration with Shell Ruin, Rolling Stone hailed the album as being \"as close to art as pop music gets\". Male soloists Ryan Dawson, Jon Farley (uncredited) and Jack Stevens each feature on a track. The Second Coming was nominated for Best Album at the 16th Urapopstar Awards, while the Ruin-penned lead single \"Tsunami of the Soul\" was nominated for Best Single and Best Video. Alesha and Ruin headlined Glastonbury with a twenty-six song set that spanned nearly three hours, a precursor to Alesha's 2009 worldwide arena tour, the Jesus Christ Supertour. Alesha earned three more number one singles with \"Original Sin\", \"Disciplinary\"/\"Guerrilla”, and a collaboration with duo Indigo Peak. The Crucify EP, featuring four album tracks and two previously unreleased songs, was also released.\n\nAlesha began working on a sixth studio album with Ruin in the final months of 2008, readied for release by spring 2009. Bigger Than God received universal acclaim from contemporary critics, who noted that it was her most alternative and introspective release to date. Pitchfork Media suggested that \"it feels like one of the landmark pop albums of the century so far.\" Bigger Than God and its number one lead single \"Apocalypse City\" earned Best Album and Best Single at the 17th Urapopstar Awards respectively. In June 2009, Alesha embarked on her first stadium tour, Apocalypse City Live. Following the release of \"Bear Dance\", Alesha exhibited strange behavior, such as being interviewed in her bikini, in a live television program called Being Alesha (as part of ITV's Tonight series). Alesha was involved in a hit-and-run incident, having crashed her car into a house and casually left the crime scene on her way to Los Angeles International Airport. Spurred by press, albeit negative, \"Bear Dance\" reached number one. Alesha also released Wanderlust, a collection of covers.\n\nAlesha and Ruin collaborated on their first \"proper\" duet, \"Delusions of Grandeur\", released in October 2009. Self-hyped as one of their best singles yet, the song received widespread acclaim from music critics. The song's video was filmed at Chile's Cape Horn and portrays Alesha and Ruin as immortal warriors. \"Delusions of Grandeur\" topped the singles chart upon its release. Alesha and Ruin also hosted the 17th Urapopstar Awards, where they performed the single together. After the awards ceremony, Ruin was involved in a serious car accident outside of London's Earls Court. Accompanied by Alesha, Ruin and her assistant were airlifted to The Royal London Hospital, where Saunders died and Ruin was treated for serious head injuries. Ruin was pronounced dead hours later. Alesha released \"Good Mourning\" as a tribute to Ruin, in addition to organizing a benefit concert in her honor. Labeled \"the official soundtrack to the nation's mourning\", \"Good Mourning\" became Alesha's first single to sell over 400,000 copies (a feat she would accomplish numerous times in later years, due to sales inflation). \"Delusions of Grandeur\" won Best Collaboration at the 18th Urapopstar Awards, while \"Good Mourning\" was nominated for Best Single and Best Video.\n\n2010–2013: Last Judgment, The Martyr and hiatus[edit | edit source]\n\nIn spring 2010, Alesha announced that she was expecting her third child and intended to retire from the music industry. She released her second greatest hits collection Last Judgment. The album's first disc chronicled the last three years of Alesha's career, while the second disc featured seven new songs (eight following a reissue). The release was met with critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone declaring Alesha \"the finest singles artist Britain has produced this decade\". Last Judgment became Alesha's seventh number one album; the lead single, \"Heavens Above Me\", also reached the pole position. Alesha embarked on The Reckoning, a brief, worldwide stadium tour with Putanovska. The tour reached a number of venues across the globe, causing a media frenzy and a worldwide phenomenon. Alesha soon announced the release of \"The Last Temptation\", marketed as her final single. Backed by an intense promotional campaign and an acclaimed music video, the single spent two weeks at number one and ultimately received a double platinum certification. Both the song and video received multiple accolades and awards nominations, including the gong for Best Single at the 19th Urapopstar Awards. A box set edition of Last Judgment was released alongside the video collection Theology. Alesha also released an autobiography Líf and the incredibly lucrative documentary film Ragnarök.\n\nOn June 12, Alesha performed a sold-out gig at London's Wembley Stadium, joined by a number of close friends and fellow musicians. The show, Judgment Day, was billed as Alesha's final concert. She gave a show-stopping performance at the 18th Urapopstar Awards on 7 August, where she paid tribute to Shell Ruin with \"Good Mourning\", recreated her iconic awards performances, and closed with \"The Last Temptation\". Alesha was honored with reputable awards such as Best Overall Artist and Best Songwriter, but most notably she was given the prestigious title of Artist of the Decade. On 24 October 2010, Alesha and Neyssa welcomed twin sons into the world, their first male children. The babies were conceived through in vitro fertilization. The sons were bizarrely named Rafiki and Zazu Kurdadze after characters from The Lion King.\n\nDespite having announced her retirement half a year earlier, Alesha announced the release of a new album in December 2010. Months earlier, international media outlets reported that Shell Ruin had in fact faked her own death and had been living in hiding. Upon her return to the public eye, Alesha was questioned about Ruin during several interviews but refused to comment. After increasing pressure for her to discuss the situation, a representative for Alesha issued a statement stating that Alesha was not aware that Ruin's death was fake and that the pair hadn't spoken. Alesha's seventh studio album, The Martyr, was released in January 2011. It contained themes of anger towards Ruin, as well as pondering themes of fame and its effects on lifestyle, privacy and relationships. The Martyr peaked at number one, earning Alesha her highest first week sales frame for an album at the time; however, it became her first studio album since 2005 to fall short of a diamond certification. The album was promoted with the singles \"Silent Holocaust\", \"The Hunted\" and \"Sister\" and a worldwide stadium tour, the Heathen Tour. Following tabloid reports of martial problems, Alesha and Neyssa separated in the New Year. Alesha officially filed for divorce weeks later as she began seeing Just Ginger. Alesha hosted the 19th Urapopstar Awards alongside Putanovska and Ginger in February.\n\nIn July 2011, Alesha made another foray into film with the motion picture Prime Cut, which stars Alesha as a prostitute and Putanovska as her matron. The soundtrack, released alongside the film, featured songs from the movie as well as songs inspired by the movie. In August, Alesha released God Save the Queen: The Best of Alesha, a collection of Alesha's greatest hits and favorite songs from throughout her career. Alesha took an unofficial musical sabbatical beginning in August 2011, seldom making public appearances. She attended the 84th Academy Awards in February 2012 where she and Putanovska performed Best Original Song winner \"Who Do You Think You Are\". Alesha later revealed that she had suffered from severe depression directly before, during and after the promotion of The Martyr. In 2013, while on a \"spiritual journey\" in Bali, Alesha met and married American publishing mogul Austin Roosevelt.\n\n2014–2015: Resurgence with self-titled and afterhours[edit | edit source]\n\nIn February 2014, Alesha announced that she would be returning to the music industry with a new album. The promotional single \"Renaissance\" and \"budget\" greatest hits compilation Essential Alesha were released in April. Alesha starred in an eponymous two-part documentary series for MTV that followed her as she re-established her career. She also appeared on the covers of Elle UK, i-D and Rolling Stone. In May, Alesha released her eighth studio album Alesha and its lead single \"Witch\", featuring guest vocals from The Uraps Factor winner and breakout success Malaya. In May, Alesha took part in the charity single \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", arranged by Nicola. \"Japan\" was released as the second single from Alesha in July, preceding the launch of Alesha: Renaissance Live (with support from Nicola and Amy-Jayne). The single returned Alesha to the top two, while the headlining world tour created immense success at the box office and many venues were instantly sold out.\n\nFollowing a show-stopping 2014 MTV Video Music Awards performance, Alesha and Paulo Araujo announced the single release of \"Opulence\" and \"Unbeknownst\", duets taken from Alesha and Araujo's Profanities respectively. The popularity of the single earned Alesha her 15th number one hit – and her first since returning to the charts in 2014. The follow-up single, \"Number One\", aptly became Alesha's 16th number one, tying Emily Henning's record of most number one singles for a female solo artist. It sold over 800,000 copies during its first ten weeks on the chart. Alesha also appeared on Jean-Luc's number one single \"Black Hole Supernova\". Alesha released the Gianni EP in February 2015. Following the EP's release, Alesha finally peaked at number one on the albums chart, 43 weeks into its chart run. The album sold over 3 million copies, making it Alesha's first album to be certified diamond two times over and one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Alesha notched up a massive 16 nominations at the 26th Urapopstar Awards, winning Album of the Year, Collaboration of the Year (\"Opulence\"), Best Live and Best Songwriter. She also performed a medley of \"Japan\", \"Mermaids\" (released as a promotional single) and \"Number One\". On March 2, Alesha fainted midway through a concert in Bogota, Colombia. The singer was hospitalized for exhaustion and canceled the remainder of her world tour.\n\nJust weeks after being forced to cancel the remainder of her tour, Alesha announced a series of festival gigs across the world, beginning with Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City on June 5. Dubbed the Black Leather Festival Tour, Alesha and concert organizers announced appearances at Bonnaroo, Glastonbury, Eurockéennes and Lollapalooza among others. On April 13, 2015, it was announced that Alesha had signed to Syd Wolfe owned record label and media empire Fusion Records in \"an unprecedented deal.\" On May 23, 2015, Alesha premiered \"In Love Today\", the lead single from her ninth studio album, with lyrics that are an \"ode to the freedom to love.\" The single was released on June 22, days before the United States Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples had the constitutional right to marry. \"In Love Today\" spent two weeks at number one, ultimately selling over 1 million copies to become Alesha's first diamond single. Alesha formally announced her ninth studio album afterhours on July 20 with the premiere of second single \"M4M\". afterhours is a synthpop album drawing sonic inspiration from varying 1980s and 1990s pop trends. Lyrically, Alesha explores themes of acceptance, equality, sexuality and social stigma and alludes to historical occurrences, placing herself in the queer counterculture of the time. It received widespread acclaim from contemporary music critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian says the album \"is a lovingly done reboot of the kind of early 90s dance-pop sung by the Pet Shop Boys, New Order and Madonna.\" The album was released alongside \"M4M\" on August 31, 2015. For the first time in her extensive career, Alesha held the top spot of the albums, singles, digital singles and airplay charts simultaneously.\n\nIn September 2015, Alesha's close friend and frequent writing partner Shell Ruin staged a pop comeback with \"Feel Alive\", penned by Alesha, and the new album Play. Alesha and Ruin co-wrote and co-produced the album. Alesha provided guest vocals for tracks appearing on new albums by Ruin, Paul and Syd Wolfe respectively. On October 25, 2015, Alesha hosted the 27th Urapopstar Awards – her fourth time hosting the Urapopstar Awards – alongside Aurora Reed. As well as winning Best Female and Best Single, Alesha unveiled \"Rogue Smoke\" as the third single from afterhours in a performance with Aurora Reed. The single remix of the song features new verses performed by Reed, who wrote the song, and a trap-influenced beat. Both artists co-starred in the music video for Fusion labelmate Ashley!'s \"See The World\", as did Lady Lou and Syd Wolfe. \"New York Cab\" and \"Cruising\" followed as the fourth and fifth singles from afterhours, with the latter topping the charts following the release of its controversial music video. afterhours ultimately became Alesha's second album to sell over 3 million copies.\n\n2016–2020: The White Album, Visible Light and film roles[edit | edit source]\n\nAlesha starred in the film Exile in Nashville, directed by Gus van Sant with a screenplay written by Alan Ball. Filmed in between touring duties and promotional commitments in 2015, Exile in Nashville was released to theaters in July 2016. It was accompanied by an original soundtrack, for which Alesha released the Shell Ruin-penned number one single \"How to Disappear\" and contributed four other songs. Alesha's experiences while filming Exile in Nashville would influence the recording of her tenth studio album. Frequent smoke breaks with her driver led Alesha to develop an appreciation for the country genre. During a stint in Las Vegas, Alesha became infatuated with the Southwest.\n\nThe White Album was released in October 2016. After living between Britain and the United States for years, Alesha and her family permanently relocated to the U.S. In a presidential election year, Alesha became more aware of U.S. politics, denouncing the Republican nominee, President Donald Trump. The White Album has been perceived simultaneously as Alesha's most personal and most political work to date. Alesha aimed to create her \"most textural\" record by incorporating a wide variety of influences and fashioning cohesive, textured soundscapes. Recorded in California, New York and Tennessee, the album explores genres (or sub-genres) as varied as dream pop, folk rock, neo-psychedelia, outlaw country and soul. \"Petroleum\", the lead single from the LP, spent two non-consecutive weeks at the top of the singles chart.\n\nUnlike with previous releases, Alesha did not make any television or radio appearances to promote The White Album. An exclusive photoshoot appeared in Billboard magazine alongside interviews with musicians who worked on the album and Alesha's manager, as well as quotes from Ruin and Fusion CEO Syd Wolfe. In December, Alesha and multnational entertainment company Netflix announced a partnership that included exclusive rights to a documentary (Alesha: The White Album) and an original concert special (Midwinter). Alesha also had a minor role in Shell Ruin’s Netflix series Died Blonde. “Winter”, the second single lifted from The White Album, became 2017's Christmas number one (and Alesha's record-breaking 22nd number one). Alesha followed the single's success with two more number ones, \"Outlaw\" and \"Fire + Jade\".\n\nAlesha embarked on a worldwide stadium tour, Ceremony, beginning on June 30, 2017. Despite a divisive political atmosphere across the globe and the political nature of The White Album, Alesha wanted to create a \"celebratory\" show that would allow people to \"escape and have a good time\". The decision was criticized by some progressive media outlets in the U.S. for \"endorsing complacency\", but the tour received generally positive reviews from fans and music critics. In addition to the tour, Alesha released a dance remix of album track \"Llorona\" and the Shell Ruin duet \"Sandman\". In December 2017, Alesha released the compilation album Number Ones, which featured the previously unreleased single \"When the Sky Fades\".\n\nIn 2019, Alesha filed for divorce from her husband Austin Roosevelt. Later that year, she starred in David Fincher's psychological horror A Problem. Alesha was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Alesha released her eleventh studio album Visible Light in 2020, working closely with French-Algerian record producer Henri Mohammed. Largely written and recored while in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, Visible Light includes influences of Eurodance and French house, as well as disco and funk. The album's lyrical topics include collectivism, liberation, and relationships. Its lead single \"Dove\" became the best-selling single of 2020.\n\n2021-present:[edit | edit source]\n\nArtistry[edit | edit source]\n\nSongwriting and production[edit | edit source]\n\nAlesha has been heavily involved in writing and producing most of her own music. Rolling Stone named her \"an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.\" In the later 2000s, Alesha became famous for the \"Shellesha\" sound forged by herself and collaborator Shell Ruin, noted for its unique, wordy lyrical style and indie- and electronic-inspired pop productions. The pair diverged from that style as they entered the next decade. Henri Mohammed, one of her past collaborators, said that \"You don't produce Alesha, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it.\"\n\nAlesha's songwriting is often autobiographical over the years, dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment. Alesha questioned religion with the agnostic and existential themes of Bigger Than God (2009) and has since included socially and politically conscious messages in much of her later career. Her single \"In Love Today\" has been viewed as an \"anthem for marriage equality\", with its parent album afterhours (2015) engaging in queer counterculture. The White Album (2016) was perceived simultaneously as Alesha's most personal and most political work. More introspective songs discussed loneliness, selfishness and identity crisis, while politically charged tracks touched on environmentalism, immigration and poverty.\n\nThroughout her career, Alesha has composed hits for a number of artists, including number one singles by Ana Simpson, Candi, Emily Henning, Jack Stevens, and Violetta DiNozzo. Alesha wrote and produced he entirety of Josie Matthews' second studio album Resurrection (2007). In 2009, Alesha and Ruin co-wrote and produced Emily Henning's third studio album Only Human, which spawned a string of number one hits. Alesha was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nMusical themes and genres[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen first emerging as an artist, Alesha employed a radio-friendly rhythmic pop sound similar to much of the music dominating the charts. Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that her debut album features shades of UK garage and R&B. Her second album Hungry for More (2004) capitalized on the revival of dance-pop. After experiencing glimpses of success but mostly commercial failure, Alesha opted for guitar-driven approach to her third album Buried Underneath (2005), combining pop, rock and soul. In 2007, Alesha released her breakthrough album Alesha Is the Queen, which blended dance, electropop and hip-hop. \"Fashion Kills\" is a disco song, while \"The OH in Ohio\" has crunk inspirations. Alesha expanded on these leanings with The Second Coming (2008), which included uptempo electronic \"bangers\", indie ballads and combinations of the two. Alesha continued to compose ballads and uptempo electronic songs for Bigger Than God. New songs written for Alesha's seventh studio album, disc two of the greatest hits collection Last Judgment (2010), were inspired by baroque pop and industrial music. Alesha explored more alternative and experimental sounds with The Martyr (2011), incorporating influences from avant garde and minimalist music.\n\nIn 2014, after a three-year hiatus, Alesha released her self-titled eighth studio album, a return to her pop roots. With an overarching dance-pop sound, the album explores electronic dance music and alternative R&B. Her ninth studio album, 2015's afterhours, draws influence from the music of the 1980s and '90s. afterhours is a synthpop album with strong New Wave and house influences. The White Album (2016) explores modern, electronic styles, drawing inspiration from such subgenres as dream pop and neo-psychedelia. Inspired by Alesha's experiences filming Exile in Nashville (2016), the record also incorporates folk rock, soul and even country influences.\n\nInfluences[edit | edit source]\n\nIn 2003, Alesha commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was \"Express Yourself\" by Madonna; she said it summed up her own \"take-charge attitude\". During her childhood, Alesha was inspired by '90s actresses, such as Drew Barrymore, Julia Roberts and Winona Ryder. An Ace*Teens show was the first concert Alesha ever attended. Alesha has cited Madonna and David Bowie as her largest influences, crediting their knack for reinvention with sustaining her own career. Alesha's third studio album Buried Underneath (2005) drew from \"the Lilith Fair crowd\" and female singer-songwriters like Alanis Morissette, Jewel, and Liz Phair. Alesha was heavily influenced by the work of electronic hip-hop artist M.I.A. during the recording of Alesha Is the Queen (2007) and The Second Coming (2008). Alesha also incorporated religious motifs into her music with The Second Coming, making \"sacrilegous\" allusions to Jesus Christ, Judas, the crucifixion and original sin in lighthearted pop songs. Alesha had previously come under fire from the Vatican in 2007 with her and Neyssa's B-side \"Banned in the Vatican\", which critiqued the Catholic Church's stance on homosexuality. Alesha's lyrics have cited poetry from Robert Louis Stevenson and W.B Yeats.\n\nWith her sixth studio album Bigger Than God (2009), Alesha sampled artists like Bowie, Thom Yorke, and New Wave band Siouxsie and the Banshees as she diversified her range of influences. Lyrics contained themes of agnosticism and existentialism, while Alesha also drew from dystopian literature, most notably George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. The lead single \"Apocalypse City\" samples David Bowie's \"We Are the Dead\" from his own glam-tinged, post-apocalyptic eighth studio album Diamond Dogs (1974), which was also inspired by Orwell's classic novel. The likes of Björk, Kate Bush, and Grace Jones became heavy influencers as Alesha continued experimenting with alternative, sometimes experimental sounds.\n\n2014's Alesha sampled Gil Scott-Heron & Jamie xx and The Weeknd, while \"Ghosts\" drew its bassline from New Order's \"Blue Monday\". Another song, \"Opulence\", featured dialogue from the 1990 documentary film Paris Is Burning, a landmark LGBTQ film that showcases New York's ball culture at its zenith. Alesha also referenced drag or ball culture with the songs \"White Naomi\", \"Read the House Down\" and \"Kiss of Death\" from the Gianni EP (2015). '80s synthpop and queer counterculture continued to inspire Alesha with her ninth studio album, drawing inspiration from musicians like Depeche Mode, New Order and the Pet Shop Boys whilst discussing equality, love, sexuality and stigma. Alesha cited the Cocteau Twins, Mazzy Star, and Tame Impala as her \"musical crushes\" when recording The White Album (2016).\n\nAwards and recognition[edit | edit source]\n\nWith 28 wins to her name, Alesha has received more Urapopstar Awards than any other artist. With three Best Album and Best Single wins to her name, she has also won awards in those major categories more than any other artist. Her Best Album winners include Alesha Is the Queen (2007), Bigger Than God (2009), and Alesha (2014).

She was also nominated for Best Actress in a Drama at the Golden Globes.\n\nAlesha declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2010, and turned down a damehood in 2013. Alesha later stated \"I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for.\" In 2019, Alesha was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.\n\nLegacy[edit | edit source]\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, Alesha \"remains one of the greatest pop acts of all time.\" Alesha has, at various points in her career, been \"the world's highest earning female singer\" and was the best selling female singer of 2007 and 2008.

It was argued by a 2010 piece in Vanity Fair that Alesha \"transformed the art of modern pop music\". She was characterized as \"an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the tools to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power.\" Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley called her an \"extremely important figure in the history of popular culture\" and a \"genius\". Her total lifetime earnings from royalties on her solo recordings and music videos, revenue from concerts and endorsements, and work for other artists have been estimated at $600 million. As one of the world's most famous figures, Alesha's highly publicized personal life, coupled with her successful career, have made her a staple of popular culture.\n\nIn 2010, Alesha was named Artist of the Decade at the 18th Urapopstar Awards.

She made the decision to merge the label with Andrea Twain's Baa.Music, which was later renamed Visionary Music (and ultimately became Alias Records). Alesha left when Twain decided to override a business decision of hers (dropping Ellen Fitzpatrick from the label's roster); she was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 2005. Alesha subsequently signed with Ensemble, where she remained until its closure in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, Alesha, Putanovska, and Shell Ruin founded the entertainment company Holy Trinity. With headquarters in New York City, the company serves as an umbrella for the three entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The company was featured in the reality television series N.Y. Life (2013–15). In 2011, Alesha also purchased a 30% share of Saturdays Records; the label quickly hemorrhaged money and was dissolved. Alesha continued to release music and multimedia under the Holy Trinity moniker.
