So it's based on a website I ran back in 2001 and is VERY EARLY 2000s. I used to dream up popstars all the time and make fake album tracklists for them, so I turned that into a website.

If you want to play, you promote your artist and then people vote on the campaign they liked best.

This could flop very badly but I thought I'd give it a go!

WHAT WEBSITE WAS THAT PLEASE?

URAOPSTAR! It ran for about 15 years. You can see lots of the charts and stats here. It took on a bit of a life of its own for a select group of internet gays!

I think I may have made it sound more DAUNTING than it is. You can do any old shit and post three times and you'll probably do all right

My pop star will not be in any way marketable or talented but experience has taught me that’s no impediment to becoming a Moopy icon.

Good question.

The first number 1 after 9/11 was called The Cucumber Song.

The Christmas number 1 that year was called Die For You by the Ace*Teens (@AcerBen I believe) so I feel there was some correspondence to 9/11 there.

If I flop in this after playing the real thing for a DECADE than I might just kill myself.

I have just been informed by @Soldi that it is still running! Apparently it was resurrected during lockdown. I hope they don't sue me for rehashing my own idea

Never knew anything about THIS

I assume non-competitors will be able to vote? I probably won’t take part but look forward to doing that!

The more the merrier, in any way you want to take part.

I think we'd probably need 10 participants to make it work, ideally more but we'll see. I think we have 9 already (a couple of people have said yes but not voted in the poll).

I'm going to do a reveal on Friday! So send them to me but don't reveal them now.

It's not the end of the world if you do reveal them, but I thought a reveal might be fun!

One idea I have been given by a very excited poster is that if you do want to play, you're allowed to enter more than once act. Only if you wanted to!

I used to do imaginary bands and tracklistings when I was wee, before I could even play an instrument.

My thinking cap is ON .

I am glad I wasn't alone! It was quite 'only child' of me to do I think, but I really enjoyed coming up with the tracklists!

I used to do fake football teams and then evolved onto fantasy bands and chart their career. Most of it was broadly based around ABBA and 90s dance music.

Interesting that a few of us has these kind of games! Definitely an outlet for the creative mind
