The guy behind Edna was from Texas but was OBSESSED with shit British culture. He was a huge fan of Eastenders, Martine McCutcheon and Kym Marsh.

I think they once revealed that they'd been a big fan of Kym but hadn't heard her name spoken out loud so for years thought she was called KIME(?)

Spears, Sparez... That literally only works in an Aussie/Kiwi accent.

I’ve literally sat here for nigh on twenty minutes saying them both back to me and still can’t tell the difference

But to me bear, beer and bare are all pronounced exactly the same which my British mates cannot comprehend...

It doesn't ring a bell But I don't remember many!

I was Holly and I believe I gave myself a number 1 at some stage There was a weekly chart vote though so I probably only slightly exploited my position

Good lord I just remember my girls did a duet with you to get us back in the hotly contested top five after they fell out of favour.

Bring this shit back ASAP

No, you created a popstar/group, made up song titles, created artwork (or got someone to make it for you) and then promoted on the forum banging on about them like it was TOTP magazine in order to get votes. Was very surreal looking back but somehow worked back in 2001.

Oh my God! I had forgotten that but it all just came flooding back! We were a chart force to be reckoned with

Look at the list of no.1s. Nick Edwards...

WTAF?! Was this actually me? I am struggling to remember this...

I basically did this myself with all the names of all my classmates, in my bedroom, on some 1995 version of Excel as well... with some randomising algorithms to work out charts... man I was so cool.

Must have had very front loaded 'sales' as it wasn't even in the top 40 of the year. Guess those first few weeks were easy to get a number 1 in...

OMG at all this

this like a Moopy equivalent of Lost, everyone will turn out to have interacted in the past somehow

I feel like I’ve heard the name but sadly no.

all I had was the Chart Show/Twix fantasy chart league (which I won a shit cheap record bag from)

It's a long time ago but if I recall, you signed up, posted for a week then never checked back. So I don't think you even knew you reached number 1. Nick Edwards became a bit of an enigmatic urban legend in the early days as a result. Epitome of one hit wonder

The trouble with it always was that it was a bit of WORK though and we're not teenagers with lots of free time any more (except @Soldi)

NO Honestly some people are so jealous because they can’t win POTW with ease!

I actually bought a nice pair of earphones (Apple ) last night via the Amazon link. I’m a giver not a taker dear!

WTF? That's such a great story that I didn't even know I was part of.
