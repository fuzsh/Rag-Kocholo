        "text": "There is a scene in the 1954 classic movie On the Waterfront that, one can argue, introduced the world to the art of modern, naturalistic acting. Terry Malloy (played by Marlon Brando) is talking with Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint) in a park in the city. He clearly enjoys her company–they only recently met. But she isn’t sure about him, especially because they met in part due to the death of her brother. Not exactly an auspicious way to start a relationship.\n\nAnd Edie, at this point in the film, has no intention of starting a relationship with Terry. But as they walk together, he talks a mile a minute, engaging her, trying to break the ice. At one point, fiddling with a fashionable pair of white gloves, Edie drops one on the ground. Terry quickly picks it up . . . but doesn’t give it back to her. Instead, he caresses it, explores it, and then puts it on his own hand, all the while continuing with the conversation. Edie doesn’t acknowledge it, though she shows through her glances and body language that she is very aware he now wears her glove.\n\nTerry continues to fiddle with the glove as they talk, even as it’s wrapped around his hand. The message is clear–Edie is not prepared yet to hold his hand. But Terry simulates that action by wearing her glove. It is a subtle, romantic gesture. Eventually, Edie says she has to go, and she reaches for the glove and pulls it off his hand, reclaiming it. They go on talking, as if nothing has happened. It is a remarkably natural scene.\n\nBut what makes it more remarkable is . . . none of it was scripted! Sure, the dialogue was. But not the glove. The actress, Eva Marie Saint, did not drop one of her gloves on purpose. It was an accident. Undoubtedly, she thought the director, Elia Kazan, would yell, “Cut!” And they would need to reshoot the scene.\n\nBut Brando reacted with lightning-quickness. Without missing a beat, he, completely on his own, picked up the glove and proceeded to do everything just described above. Nowhere in the script did it say, “Edie drops her glove, and Terry places it on his own hand to simulate holding her hand.” That was 100 percent Brando ad-libbing in the moment, so invested in his role that he simply responded naturally and had the instincts to understand his character, his motivations, and the dynamics of the scene.\n\nEva Marie Saint responded with aplomb as well. She had no idea Brando was going to do that–neither did he, until it happened! But she played off of him, without a script, perfectly. And then when she reached to retrieve her glove from him–all in one fluid motion, without mentioning it–just 100 percent natural–that, too, was obviously unscripted. Just pure instinct.\n\nFor his part, screenwriter Budd Schulberg wrote a first-rate script. But he can’t take credit for this scene. It was all the actors ad-libbing and playing off each other.\n\nOf course, even beyond a scene like this one, where the actors, literally, create something out of thin air, a screenwriter is dependent on the cast delivering their lines well. A movie script is words on a page. It is designed to come alive on the silver screen (or on your TV, or on your smartphone). It requires the actors to do their part. The best script can fall flat in the hands of untalented actors. And a so-so script can resonate and move an audience to tears if the performers on-screen bring it to life and make the words sing.\n\nEither way, a screenwriter is dependent. Their words are not enough. In the hands of a Marlon Brando or an Eva Marie Saint, a scriptwriter can appear to be a genius. And Schulberg deserves plenty of credit for his script. But let’s not kid ourselves. On the Waterfront is one of America’s all-time great movies because of the actors.\n\n************************************\n\nFor a novelist (or short story writer, or any writer who relies exclusively on the written word), there are no Brandos or Saints to weave their alchemy and turn the words on the page to gold. If you intend for a character’s dialogue to be funny, the words need to convey the humor on their own. There are no gifted actors to deliver the lines and make them their own. It is all on you–the author.\n\nCreating mood, character, subtleties, innuendoes; depicting sarcasm, tone of voice, disbelief. These are things an author needs to do through the crafting of a scene on the page, through the dialogue itself, the setting, the narrative, and a few well-placed and strategic descriptions–as much by showing as possible, keeping the telling firmly in check.\n\nIt is an enormous challenge. If you don’t come right out and tell a reader, “Character X is sad” (and you shouldn’t), you have to show the reader–and, again, you need to do it exclusively through your words. There are no shortcuts, no actors to bail you out. No director whose unique camera angles and visual storytelling technique lift your words to the stratosphere. It is all, and only, your words.\n\nThat is both the blessing and the curse of writing for the written page. You have 100 percent ownership of the material and the characters. It is your creation; no one else’s.\n\nAnd, when you think about it . . . that’s pretty exciting. Much more a blessing than a curse. The opportunities are as endless as your imagination.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nTerry Malloy\n\nEdie Doyle\n\nBefore the start of fifth-grade, I was afraid. Granted, I never wanted summer vacation to end, but that year, I was filled with an unusual dread. My teacher that year would be Mr. Bansbach. He’d been teaching the fifth grade since the time of Confucius, or so it seemed to my ten-year-old sensibilities. He was old-school, even when old-school was still in vogue–this was the 1980s. He was tough. He was no-nonsense. But, more than anything, he was strict.\n\nNot that I was a troublemaker. Shy to the core, I said little at school and was a good student. But I still worried. Stories about Mr. Bansbach circulated through the school. He was as feared as any teacher I ever had. I dreaded that first day.\n\nWhen it arrived, Mr. Bansbach introduced himself and, standing at the front of the class in his suit and tie, his thick glasses reflecting the fluorescent overhead lights, his thinning, dyed-black hair combed back on his head, he called us “preteens.” “You’re not ‘kids,'” he said. “A ‘kid’ is a baby goat. You are preadolescents, you are growing up, and you will take responsibility in my class.” Great, i thought. The rumors were true. This guy was going to be a nightmare.\n\nOne day, about a week into the new school year, I finished an in-class assignment early. Not sure what to do, I just sat there, hands folded, waiting for the other students to finish.\n\nMr. Bansbach was not impressed.\n\n“Class,” he said. “I want to direct your attention to this young man.” He pointed at me. “He finished his assignment early.” That was good, wasn’t it? I was on the ball! Evidently not. “Don’t do what he just did. Ever. When he finished, he sat there, blankly, wasting time. Next time, young man”–he stared right at me–“take out a book and read. Make use of your time. Understand?”\n\nI did.\n\nAnd I didn’t like Mr. Bansbach.\n\nA few weeks later, before class, Mr. Bansbach pulled me aside in the hallway, just outside his classroom. I stiffened. What had I done now? Finished my homework too early the night before? Did he have some way to monitor me at home?\n\n“That was an impressive victory last night,” he said. “Maybe your Steelers will win a fifth Super Bowl this season.”\n\nAnd he patted me on the shoulder and winked. Then he went into the classroom and I followed.\n\nWhat had just happened? And how did he know I was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan? And why did he care? Was he a sports fan, too?\n\nHe was. Throughout that fall, he would talk to me about the Steelers games. Win or lose, he always took a few minutes early in the week to go over their previous game with me. I didn’t say much. I was still nervous around him. But it impressed me that he was so in tune with his students.\n\nAs the year rolled on, I genuinely learned to like Mr. Bansbach. And he seemed to like me. He congratulated me on several homework assignments, when I went above and beyond the parameters of the assignment. The following year, when I entered sixth grade and had a new teacher, Mr. Bansbach would still seek me out in the hallways on Monday mornings and talk about the most recent Steelers game.\n\nAnd while I learned to like him more and more as my fifth-grade year progressed, it was that first kind gesture, that initial time he talked to me about my favorite football team, that stuck with me. I can still remember it–the way he stood there, outside his classroom, waiting for me. His way of letting me know we were okay. That I was okay.\n\nYou might call it a moment of epiphany, a realization, that the rumors were false, and that Mr. Bansbach was different from his reputation. Oh, he was strict. You definitely did not want to slack off in his class. That part was true. But no one ever said he was nice, that he cared. That he would take the time to learn about his students and show them he was on their side. I had to learn that for myself.\n\nThere are moments like that throughout literature and film–moments of awakening, when a character learns something about him- or herself, or someone else. Indeed, The Eye-Dancers and The Singularity Wheel are chock-full of such moments–Joe Marma learning that he doesn’t even like football, a sport he pursues with reckless abandon, but only plays it to best his brother; Mitchell Brant finding out that his long-distance (a multiverse away!) relationship with Heather doesn’t mean what he’s thought the past five years; or Marc Kuslanski coming to grips with his guilt over the accident he feels responsible for with his little brother. The characters realize these things in a moment of revelation, a tipping point in the symphony of their lives. Epiphanies are real. But they are also hard to pull off in literature or on film.\n\nYou want to say so much without, well, saying so much. You want the scene to speak for itself. You want the reader or the viewer to feel it right along with the character.\n\nLike the performance of “Suddenly Seymour” in the 1986 remake of the musical Little Shop of Horrors. Throughout the film, Seymour (Rick Moranis) and Audrey (Ellen Greene) work together at a florist shop. Seymour is shy and awkward, but clearly carries a torch for his coworker. She, however, is in a relationship with someone she, herself, describes as a “semi-sadist” (an outrageous dentist played by Steve Martin). Audrey thinks lowly of herself, and she gets involved with abusive men like the dentist. Throughout the movie, she speaks in a squeaky, mousy voice, almost as if she doesn’t even feel she is worthy to say anything.\n\nBut then this scene happens. Seymour encourages her, praises her, and expresses his true feelings for her. He stands, and sings “Suddenly Seymour.”\n\nAudrey is touched, listening to him. Then she joins in the song. At first, her singing voice matches her speaking voice–timid, lacking in confidence, unsure. But then, when she hits her own “Suddenly Seymour” note, there is a transformation, an awakening. An epiphany. Audrey finds her voice, literally, and she belts out the rest of the song in an astonishingly strong, beautiful, and full-throated rendition. Before our eyes, without any speeches, without any blaring announcement, she and Seymour have changed. They have awakened. It is a cinematic performance for the ages.\n\nAnd that’s how epiphanies work–in life, and in story. They hit you with the force of a tidal wave, but, counterintuitively, they also do so quickly, quietly, in a moment, without any narrator making a bold, big proclamation. There is no need to tell or exclaim or pontificate. There is only a moment, the moment, when everything becomes clear.\n\nEven just a moment in a song, or a moment when your fifth-grade teacher shows you–rather than tells you–that he’s had your back all along.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nI freely admit, over the years, I have often gone with the flow on Halloween, watching scary movies, creepy episodes of The Twilight Zone, reveling in ghost stories and monster yarns. This year, though, I will go against the grain. Maybe it’s the state of the world, the precarious position of our institutions and structures, the downright disturbing events that we’ve all had to deal with on a national and global level. Whatever the reason, I am going to go with lighter fare this All Hallows Eve.\n\nAfter all, there will be more than enough people watching horror movies. Who needs Michael Myers when you can have Ralph Kramden? Who needs Jason Voorhees when you can tune in to Forrest Gump? And who needs Rick Grimes when you can watch Cary Grant or Johnny Carson?\n\nI remember one Halloween when I was a teenager, I invited some neighborhood friends over (some of whom were inspirations for the protagonists in The Eye-Dancers), and we had a horror marathon, watching Psycho, Halloween. and Dawn of the Dead back-to-back-to-back. It was well past midnight when we were through. No one wanted to leave that night–the wind was blowing, the temperature dropping, and we all knew the ghosts and goblins of the season were lurking out there in the dark. So they stayed and slept over. The next morning, with the clear, crisp light of day bringing in the month of November, we all felt better. The sun was up, you could see up and down the neighborhood streets–the spooky atmosphere of the previous night had passed, evaporating like smoke on the wind.\n\nThis year, though, I am vowing not to have to recover from anything. Why scare myself with ghosts or killer dolls or axe murderers? Why not break the ghoulish tradition and play for laughs instead?\n\nI don’t mean to discourage you from filling up on frightful movies this Halloween. If that’s your preference, drink deeply! Enjoy. Tune in to a Vincent Price masterpiece or a Hitchcock thriller, or a classic horror film from yesteryear. Turn off the lights and dare yourself to watch in the dark.\n\nBut not me. Not this year. This year, I’ll watch an episode of Cheers, the “old” Cheers with Shelley Long as the costar–when the show was at its best. I’ll watch The Honeymooners–maybe the episode where Ralph is being investigated by the IRS, and employs Norton to help him figure out what he might have done wrong with his income taxes. And then? Maybe an old Happy Days or an Everybody Hates Chris episode. Maybe an old Cary Grant classic where Cary climbs buildings, dodges crop dusters, or saves the world–all without breaking a sweat. In short, I will keep it light, corny, and optimistic.\n\nBecause, when you come right down to it, the world can use a little optimism right now . . . even on Halloween!\n\nEnjoy the holiday! And enjoy the coming of November.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nIt’s no secret that Vermont can be a harsh place to live during the winter months, and this winter is no exception. While we have not seen massive amounts of snow to date here in the hills of east-central Vermont (“only” 25 inches so far), the temperatures have been bone-chilling. Of course, it’s always cold here in the Green Mountain State in January. Thaw? What thaw? The earth is buried under a blanket of snow for months. But for the past three weeks, multiple days have topped out in the single digits, and a good chunk of nights have dipped well below zero degrees. And when the wind whips, on top of all that? It is best to be remain indoors.\n\nGiven all of this, it is natural to wonder what can possibly be meant by a “soft side.” A soft side to ten below zero? But, in fact, there is one.\n\nWith such inhospitable conditions outside, and with evening still descending early (though it is slowly starting to get lighter)–this is a season for reflection. For stillness. For unwinding. The frenetic warmer months are looked forward to, of course. Who wants it to be ten below zero for long? But during this dark, cold season, there is the opportunity for long nights in front of a fire, hot chocolate on the desk beside me, getting lost in story and wonder.\n\nAnd on these cold, cold nights, after finishing the day’s work, the call of an old movie beckons. Or an old television show. Or a good book. Below-zero nights are made for The Honeymooners or It’s a Wonderful Life, or The Wizard of Oz.\n\nOr maybe an old Hitchcock thriller, something slow and unrushed, like Rear Window. Or perhaps Forrest Gump or a long, epic-length documentary. It doesn’t so much matter what–just that it happens, that there is a chance to escape the blistering pace of the workaday world, at least for a while. Sherlock Holmes and a cup of tea, enjoying the warmth inside, the quiet of a winter night enveloping the house like a soft, thick glove.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the reminder we all need as we begin another year, a year with challenges and struggles and deadlines and political upheaval and setbacks and frustrations and joys and triumphs. There is always so much to do.\n\nBut sometimes, even in the midst of it all, we just need to be.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nWe’ve reached that time of the year again–All Hollows Eve–when ghosts and goblins roam the earth. (Of course, if you’re like me, you’re convinced they roam the earth every day, regardless of what the calendar says.) Particularly here in the hills of Vermont, it’s a time of thinning trees, plummeting temperatures, and hard nighttime frosts as the days shorten and the wild animals forage for any and all food they can acquire before the onset of the interminable New England winter.\n\nHalloween is also, of course, a day when many people revisit scary movies from their past. Even folks who may not be horror fans reason that, just this one day out of the year–they ought to tune in to a fright fest. Longtime readers of this blog will know that I am a fan of the classics–from vintage comic books to old TV shows to old movies. And so it will likely come as no surprise that five of the scary films I recommend all date from decades ago.\n\nFive Horror Classics for Halloween . . .\n\nHouse of Wax (1953)\n\nIf there is one name that is synonymous with classic horror movies, it is Vincent Price. From his brooding features to his unmistakable voice, Price was the perfect leading man for scary films. Nowhere is that more evident than in House of Wax. Price is at his spooky best in this atmospheric period thriller directed by Andre DeToth, playing a disfigured sculptor who goes to extreme and horrific measures to repopulate his wax museum, which is decimated by fire early in the movie. The film is a period piece–with the setting turn-of-the-20th-century New York, and the suave and morose Price gives a performance to elicit nightmares.\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was known as the Master of Suspense, not the Master of Horror, but he took a decided turn with Psycho. To modern eyes, the violence in this film is nothing extraordinary, but in 1960, it was shocking. The infamous “shower scene” scared countless millions–my own mother included! The scene lasts only a minute on film, but it took a week to shoot. But for me, the genius of Psycho isn’t in the murder of Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) but in the psychological makeup of the villain–Norman Bates, played superbly by Anthony Perkins. While most remember the shower scene, I always loved the scene directly before it–when Bates and Marion have a conversation in the motel parlor. Norman at first turns on the charm, but eventually a dark and troubled personality emerges, culminating in the line, delivered with chilling effectiveness by Perkins, “We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven’t you?” Halloween shivers all around.\n\nDawn of the Dead (1978)\n\nWho needs The Walking Dead when you have Dawn of the Dead? Considered by some horror enthusiasts as the best pure horror film of all time, George A. Romero’s Dawn of the Dead, like Psycho, was shocking in its day for the graphic violence it portrayed–again, nothing over the top by 2020s standards (which says something about our societal tastes today, perhaps?) but in 1978, it was a gut punch to moviegoers. An apocalyptic story line, with zombies taking over the world, Dawn of the Dead grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The movie is well known for its abandoned shopping mall setting, pitting a small core of survivors against a horde of the undead who populate the mall. Creepy stuff.\n\nHalloween (1978)\n\nIt seems fitting that the teenage daughter of Psycho‘s own Janet Leigh would make her film debut in one of the classic horror films of the 1970s. In Halloween, Jamie Leigh Curtis plays Laurie Strode, a high school student who becomes embroiled in psychotic killer Michael Myers’s rampage. John Carpenter’s edge-of-your-seat film took audiences by storm in the late 1970s, introducing an entire genre of slasher films that would dominate the next decade (think Friday the 13th). Halloween, though, is different in that it is light on blood and gore (much of it implied rather than graphically shown) and heavy on suspense and thrills. The first of its kind, in many ways, the original Halloween holds up remarkably well over forty years after its release. Watch it alone, with the lights off.\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nStephen King wrote the novel, of course, and he didn’t like Stanley Kubrick’s cinematic adaptation–but, taken on its own, Kubrick’s The Shining is a movie masterpiece. Moody, atmospheric, and haunting, the movie starts slow, developing the mood and theme and characters, and then, literally, about halfway through, all hell breaks loose. Jack Nicholson plays the tortured Jack Torrance, and no one plays “tortured” like Nicholson. The movie is chock-full of creepy, atmospheric, ghostly effects, and Danny, the boy with “the shining,” often steals the show. Incidentally, The Shining has what I consider to be the most terrifying scene in cinematic history, when Danny, racing down the empty hallways of the haunted Overlook Hotel, is confronted by two murdered ghost girls. “Come and play with us, Danny,” they tell him. And he then sees them as they were when they were murdered, hacked to pieces. For me, this scene is especially haunting because the ghost girls–identical twins–greatly resemble two other girls (also twins) I knew growing up. Gets me every time.\n\n**************\n\nAnd there you have it–a quick trip down horror movie memory lane. I hope you watch (or rewatch, as the case may be) a few!\n\nHappy Halloween and thanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nThere is a scene, early in the 1989 drama Dead Poets Society, where the new English teacher at the Welton Academy prep school, John Keating, has one of his students read aloud from a 17th-century Robert Herrick poem. The stanza reads:\n\nGather ye Rose-buds while ye may,\n\nOld Time is still a-flying:\n\nAnd this same flower that smiles to day,\n\nTo morrow will be dying.\n\nKeating and his class are standing in a hallway, beside the school’s trophy case. Old team photographs of long-ago academy sports teams are hung inside the case, the students from a different time staring out at the onlookers, their expressions locked in place across the chasm of decades.\n\nKeating asks his class what the verse means. What was Herrick getting at? “Carpe diem,” he tells them. “Seize the day.” But why? Why “seize the day”?\n\n“Because we are food for worms, lads,” Keating goes on. “Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room, will, one day, stop breathing. We’ll die.”\n\nHere, Keating asks the students to step forward to look at the photographs of the old sports teams.\n\n“They’re not that different from you, are they?” Keating says to his class. “Same haircuts. . . . Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they are destined for great things, just like many of you do. . . . But you see . . . these boys are now fertilizing daffodils.”\n\nKeating then has them lean in close, tells them to listen, listen to the voices, the murmurs of the ghosts before them. Do they hear it? Keating whispers in a voice meant to sound like the grave: “Carpe . . . diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.”\n\nThis scene is memorable for many reasons, not the least of which is the remarkable performance of Robin Williams, who plays Keating. But what of the message? What of carpe diem? Is it wise counsel?\n\nAs with anything, if misunderstood or taken to the extreme, it can harm more than help. After all, I may want to “seize the day” by climbing Mount Everest, even though I have no training and no preparation. Or I may want to drop everything and experience life to the full by walking across America, leaving all my responsibilities and cares behind me. That might feel good in the moment, but doubtful it would lead anywhere beneficial.\n\nWhat, then, is carpe diem, and how should we apply it? How about with writing or creativity? Is there a literary version of carpe diem? And if so, what does it look like?\n\nI don’t know about you, but when it comes to anything creative–a story idea, a scene from a novel, an inspiration–I cannot force things. If I say, “I want to write a short story today,” but have no workable idea to write about, try as I may, I won’t produce anything of value.\n\nOn the other hand, my best ideas always come unasked for, unplanned. I can be doing anything–mowing the lawn, taking a walk, lying in bed–and boom! It hits. Where does it come from? We may never know. But it comes. And it comes in its time and its choosing. What to do then?\n\nCarpe diem, of course! It’s not every day an inspired idea strikes. Whether it’s a novel idea, a short story, a poem, a song . . . it doesn’t matter. When that idea strikes, in the white-hot fire of the creative epiphany, that is the time to act.\n\nIf it’s a poem, write it. Right then and there, if possible. Same with a song. If it’s a short story, maybe jot a few notes if you can’t write it immediately. Capture the details lest you forget them, and then, at the first opportunity, write the story. If it’s a novel, again, jot down plot points, character traits, perhaps even make an outline. However you work, whatever preparations you need to do before undertaking a long-form creative endeavor . . . do what you must. And then begin writing the actual novel as soon as you can.\n\nBecause . . . why wait? Why wait and allow apathy or indifference to seep into the picture? Carpe diem. Seize the literary day! Take advantage of that gift–that new idea–while it’s fresh and you are fired up.\n\nWrite. Create. Make your words sing.\n\nAnd make your (literary) life extraordinary.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nI’ve lived in the remote east-central hills of rural Vermont for quite a while now. It’s a beautiful land with four distinct seasons, replete with dense woodlands and interspersed with dairy farms and the rare but intrepid vegetable farm, as growers do their best to cultivate crops from the hardscrabble and stony soil. But for the first half of my life, I grew up and lived in Rochester, New York. The Eye-Dancers and The Singularity Wheel are both set in western New York, in the Rochester area. It is a region I will always carry with me and write about. So it was with a sense of pride that I learned, years ago, while I still lived there, that the legendary film director Frank Capra sought inspiration from upstate New York.\n\nIn 1945, as the Second World War came to an end after six interminable and deadly years, Capra was looking for just the right model for his next movie. The world had been through hell and back, and he wanted to make a film that would uplift, inspire, and celebrate the best in humanity. He was preparing to make It’s a Wonderful Life–still my all-time favorite movie. The movie would be based on Philip Van Doren’s story “The Greatest Gift,” and set in the fictional town of Bedford Falls, New York.\n\nCapra intended to keep the small-town New York State setting, but he didn’t want to create a fictional town without first seeing the real thing with his own eyes. His search brought him to the town of Seneca Falls, a small, pastoral town about an hour east of Rochester and already famous for its Women’s Rights Convention from the summer of 1848. While strolling through the town, Capra knew he had his model. Bedford Falls would be based on Seneca Falls.\n\nIndeed, many aspects of the fictional town were, in actuality, replicas of the real-life Seneca Falls–from the grassy median along Main Street, to the Victorian architecture, to the distinct upstate New York feel, complete with a row of old shops located in the center of town. Seneca Falls at the time even had a real-life version of Old Man Potter, the crusty, wealthy villain in It’s a Wonderful Life.\n\nAnd now, during the holiday season, when millions watch It’s a Wonderful Life each year, I am, well, inspired by Capra’s inspiration. Much as things were in 1945, we, today, are at the end of a deadly and treacherous year. No doubt, 2020 is one for the ages, and not in a good way. We can all use some inspiration this yuletide.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t have to be It’s a Wonderful Life (though it will be for me). It can be anything. Maybe you have another holiday film favorite, or a particular TV episode that you love this time of year. Watch it. Enjoy it. Laugh and cry along with it. Or perhaps there’s a favorite book, or a tradition you keep. Or a song you sing. Maybe you want to take a long walk along a quiet country road or drive through town, just observing the sights and sounds of late December. Perhaps the night will be clear, and, bundled up against the cold, you head outside, look up, contemplate the cosmos, the vastness, and count the stars, which glitter like diamonds across the canvas of the sky.\n\nWhatever it is, hopefully we can all find our inspiration at the end of this challenging year. And then look ahead to what has to be, what must be, a far better year in 2021.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year, and, like Frank Capra all those decades ago, may we all discover something “wonderful.”\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nIt is indisputable. We live in historically stressful times. While a worldwide pandemic rages on, growing worse by the day, while crises arise in both far-flung places and close to home, and while perhaps the most consequential election in American history approaches, people everywhere feel a sense of anxiety, a tightening of the chest, a species of fear. When will the pandemic end? How will we get out of this? When will we feel safe again? When can we return to a sense of normalcy? Stressful times, indeed.\n\nAnd while it is important to engage, to tackle the issues and problems of our time head-on, to speak out for truth and common sense–there is also something else that is important: our well-being, our state of mind. Our sanity itself. One thing is certain–too much stress and anxiety, especially over a protracted period of time, can have a deleterious effect on our health.\n\nSo, what to do? Well, there is much we can do. Go out for a jog, get the heart pumping. Write a poem, or a novel. Or a song. Read a book. Do Pilates or Tai chi. Volunteer in the community. Mow the lawn. Meditate. Take a night and go to bed early–regardless of what you have to do. But one thing I try to do when the pressures of life seem too great, when the vice pinches tighter, when the clouds darken and multiply in a bruised sky the color of gunmetal is–to seek out something fun.\n\nI am a proponent of the serious, the studious, the deep, and multilayered as much as anybody. But in times like these, when the world is collectively holding its breath, there is also much to be said about lighthearted, airy entertainment. Do you have a “guilty pleasure”? Perhaps a silly movie or absurd TV show that you love? Does a certain sitcom make you laugh, even as you realize how ridiculous it is? What do you enjoy that is fluff, light on substance but high on laughs? There must be something.\n\nSeek it out. Take an evening and stream some episodes or, to go old school, break out a DVD and pop it in. But give yourself permission to enjoy something frivolous. Are you a Seinfeld fan? The Golbergs? Modern Family? What about The Big Bang Theory? Or maybe it’s a movie. Maybe it’s an old movie–perhaps a golden oldie like Caddyshack or Trading Places or The Seven-Year Itch. Maybe it’s all of them and more.\n\nFor me, when I’m in need of something to make me laugh and forget about the strains and the struggles for a while, I turn to Cheers, The Honeymooners, and–though not exactly a comedy, and certainly not altogether lighthearted–Forrest Gump. Or maybe I’ll seek out a classic 1970s sitcom like Sanford and Son or Happy Days. Or something really old like The Philadelphia Story, or, my all-time favorite, It’s a Wonderful Life. Again, not all of these are pure fluff. The point is, they take me away on a pleasant journey. They allow me to disengage for a time. They make me laugh. They sometimes make me cry (but in a good way; the climax of It’s a Wonderful Life gets me every time). They enable me to step away from the insanity and the craziness and the deadlines and the worries and the anxieties and the strife, and they provide a moment of respite, a safe space, an oasis overflowing with elixirs for the soul.\n\nYour places of fun-filled and lighthearted refuge may be different from mine. But you have them. You have your go-to sources for comfort. We all do. So, on this Halloween weekend, I hope you have the chance to dip your toe in, if only for a while, to settle in and relax and laugh. Laugh at something silly. Laugh at some corny, dated sitcom produced in the years before you were born or a contemporary comedy that never fails to amuse.\n\nStressors are all around us. And real problems need to be tackled and overcome. But we can all benefit from taking a brief detour in a friendly neighborhood bar where “everybody knows your name” or a lively and song-filled jaunt down the Yellow Brick Road. I know I can.\n\nAnd, maybe, just maybe, this weekend I will.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nBack in the 1980s, when I was in junior high, I asked my older brother John if he could sneak me in to the old Waring Theater in Rochester, NY. Why would I need to go to the theater on the sly? The Waring was replaying the classic horror film Halloween that week, nearly ten years removed from the movie’s debut. Since I was just a toddler when Halloween was originally released, I hadn’t yet seen it–and I dearly wanted to. I enjoyed feeling scared at the movies, and who was scarier than Michael Myers? I had to see this movie. And John was my ticket in.\n\nI was still a few years shy of seventeen at the time, and so, by law, the only way I’d be permitted into the theater to watch Halloween–and R-rated movie–would be if my parents accompanied me and stayed with me throughout the duration of the film. I didn’t want that! So I went to John for help. He was friends with the guy at the ticket booth, and he assured me he could get me in.\n\nHe did. It was easy. The guy–a recent college grad, just like my brother, just shrugged when John asked for the tickets. “Sure, why not,” he said, barely acknowledging my existence, then asked my brother what he was doing next Friday night. Maybe they could get together. And that was that. I was on my way in, ready for a good scream-fest. But it wouldn’t be just John and me. A couple of his friends came with us, and if they felt uneasy or burdened by sitting beside a minor at an R-rated movie, they didn’t show it. They made me feel like one of the guys. It was a good start to what I hoped would be a memorable evening.\n\nWhen the movie started, the audience quieted. I figured most people in the audience had seen the movie before. It was a replay, after all. It was my first time, though, and I wasn’t disappointed. I’d seen other horror movies, of course, but this one was different. It made me fidget in my seat as no other movie ever had. Where was Michael Myers? You could never tell from one scene to the next. He would jump out, unexpected, sudden, and the audience would gasp. I realized, maybe many in the audience hadn’t seen the movie. Or, if they had, they had forgotten just enough to be scared again.\n\nA few times during the first hour of the film, my brother, seated beside me, asked me how I was doing. I both appreciated and felt annoyed at the questions. It was nice he cared. But what was I–a baby? I was fine! Scared but fine. On my other side, though, Mark, one of my brother’s friends who accompanied us to the theater, continually looked away during frightening scenes.\n\n“Just thought I lost a contact,” he said when he caught me eyeing him at one juncture. “But I didn’t. Just had a speck in my eye.”\n\nMmm-hmm. I guess he hadn’t seen the movie before either. Who knew?\n\nAbout an hour and fifteen minutes in, the tension on-screen reached a fever pitch. The movie’s star, Jamie Lee Curtis, in the role of Laurie Strode, suspicious over the mysterious events of the evening, decides to cross the street and search her neighbor’s house, where some of her friends are staying. Unbeknownst to her, these same friends have just been murdered by the film’s villain, Michael Myers. And all we, in the audience of the old Waring Theater, knew was that Myers was hiding somewhere in that house.\n\n“Don’t do it!” someone several rows behind us shouted. “Don’t go in that house!”\n\nBut Laurie, on-screen, does not heed the moviegoer’s warning. She enters the house, unaware that the killer is in there, somewhere, waiting.\n\nShe soon discovers her butchered friends, and panic rises. She knows a maniac is at large. She knows she is in danger, and she, and everyone in the theater, is on high alert.\n\nAs I watched the scene unfold on the big screen, I’m not sure I breathed. What would happen next? Would Laurie survive? She was the protagonist, the hero! She had to survive. Right? I wasn’t so sure. Neither, evidently, was anyone else in the audience. No one spoke. The tension was thick enough to bite into and chew.\n\nAnd that’s when, as the scene tested the limits of my fright-stamina, it all suddenly came crashing to a halt.\n\nLet me back up. Neither my brother, his friends, nor I knew that another of my brother’s friends, Ricky, was in the audience that night. Ricky had graduated high school with my brother half a decade earlier, and he was known for his carousing, wild antics and no-holds-barred personality. He once told me, on a visit to our house, that he spent more time in the principal’s office than the classroom. He was the class clown, the prankster, the guy who was fun to hang around, but at a safe distance.\n\nAnd that night, though none of us knew it, he was seated about a dozen rows in front of us. As we watched the climactic scene play out on the screen, as the suspense rose still higher, Ricky decided that now was the time to make his presence known.\n\nHe stood up, turned around, faced the audience, cupped his hands around his mouth, and shouted, “He’s in the closet!” Immediately, groans emanated from the throng of moviegoers. Popcorn flew, hurled in Ricky’s direction. He quickly sat back down as the popcorn continued to pelt him. And sure enough, seconds later, there was Michael Myers emerging from the closet . . .\n\nThis memory, as with so many others, is crystal clear in places and blurry in others. While I can see that popcorn flying through the air, striking Ricky in the face, the hair, the shoulders as if it were yesterday, while I can hear his “in the closet” shout like a firecracker in my head, even today, I cannot remember the drive to and from the theater, the trips to the concession booth, or what we did before and after the movie. I can’t even remember seeing Ricky after the movie. Likely he bolted as fast as he could to avoid the wrath of the crowd. But the night lives on, the experience endures, and fragments of it swirl around like pieces of confetti through the chasm of thirty years.\n\nAs a writer, I sometimes think back to that night, and remind myself not to inject any “in the closet” moments into my stories. After all, if something is meant to surprise, it should surprise. There’s a fine line between telegraphing and foreshadowing.\n\nI’d prefer the popcorn doesn’t fly in my direction.\n\nThanks so much for reading!\n\n–Mike\n\nThis year, Christmas just isn’t the same for me. All my life, especially growing up, Christmas represented the most treasured, the most special time of the year. And now, looking back, it’s clear what the glue was that held it all together, the one indispensable person who made the holidays something the entire family could enjoy and look forward to. (Not that it wasn’t clear before, but sometimes loss hones the focus, makes you see things with a crystalline clarity made pointed and sharp from the stiletto blade of absence.)\n\nMy mother loved Christmas. She started preparing for it weeks in advance. The first Sunday in December, in that long-ago world of the 20th century, she would round up the family, and we’d head over to Wambach Farms (a family-owned Rochester, NY-area market that, after serving the community for generations, sadly, closed its doors earlier this year) to buy our Christmas tree–and choosing just the right tree was no small task! We’d examine them all, until we found the one we all agreed on; then my father would load it into the trunk and tie it down, and we’d head back home and decorate for hours.\n\nMom also spread Christmas cheer to non-family members. She baked cookies for scores of friends and neighbors, invited people to the house all through December, and invented participatory games each year the visitors could enjoy.\n\nFor the past two decades, I’ve lived in Vermont–having moved away from my hometown at the dawn of the 2000s. But Christmas was no less special, even then. Until this year.\n\nLast winter, my mother passed away from lung cancer. It was sudden, unexpected, undiagnosed until the very end. And now, at Christmastime, I find it’s hard to want to celebrate. For me, and what this time of year has always meant to me, the essence, the guts, have been ripped out. There is a part of me that wants to fast-forward a fortnight, bypass the holidays, and emerge on the other side of 2019.\n\nBut then I pause, catch myself. And think of my mother’s all-time favorite Christmas movie . . .\n\n*********************\n\nWhen It’s A Wonderful Life debuted in movie theaters in 1946, it wasn’t the box-office hit its producers and director, Frank Capra, hoped for. It seemingly had everything going for it–a rousing, feel-good message on the heels of a nightmarish, horrific world war, a first-rate cast and crew, and the return of popular actor James Stewart to the Silver Screen after five years away, during which time he’d served with distinction in the war. But, despite being nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (losing out to The Best Years of Our Lives), the movie fell flat with audiences that year. It was only decades later, when television audiences were re-introduced to it every holiday season, that its star rose.\n\nEven for all that, there are, and always have been, critics of It’s A Wonderful Life specifically and Frank Capra more generally. His films are too mawkish, the naysayers argue. They view life through rose-colored glasses. Long before It’s A Wonderful Life graced the Silver Screen, Capra had made his mark with pictures such as It Happened One Night and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, among many others. His detractors coined the term “Capricorn” in response to his movies, brushing them off as “sentimental hogwash,” as old Mr. Potter himself grouses in It’s A Wonderful Life.\n\nCapra responded with his motion pictures and successful career as a film director, and with quotes like this one: “My films must let every man, woman, and child know that God loves them, that I love them, and that peace and salvation will become a reality only when they all learn to love each other.”\n\nAnd of course no Capra movie, perhaps no movie, period, embodies this sentiment more than It’s A Wonderful Life. Most are familiar with the story of George Bailey, the character played by Stewart, an “everyman” who falls on hard times and sees his fortunes dwindle to the point where he is facing jail time for a mistake his uncle has made with their family-owned bank’s finances. George, upon learning and coming to grips with his dire situation, returns home on Christmas Eve after a fruitless day searching for the lost money. Frustrated, fed up with his life, he rails, throws a tantrum, berates the kids and the “drafty old house” they live in. “It’s like living in a refrigerator,” he yells. And when he reaches for the cap on the newel post of the staircase banister, about to head upstairs, it comes off, loose–as it has always done. But this time, this time . . . He motions to throw it, but, pulling himself back together–at least for the moment–he puts it back in place.\n\nLater, he leaves, heads to a bridge in a blizzard, and considers jumping off, into the cold water, ready to end it all. Just as he is about to take the plunge, Clarence, his guardian angel, who has been observing the entire sad tableau, dives in first. He knows George will be compelled to jump in after him and rescue him to safety, which is exactly what happens. It is at this point that the true magic of this Capra classic reaches its apogee. Clarence ultimately shows George what the world would be like if he’d never been born, how much worse off people would be, how things George has always taken for granted would be wiped away, gone, as if stricken by a sorcerer’s spell. This causes George to realize he’s really lived “a wonderful life,” and he begs Clarence to take him back, to allow him to return to his old life with all the problems and trials and jams.\n\nWhen George does return, he’s a new man, grateful for the very things he had been cursing before the experience with Clarence began. He runs home, hugs his wife and children, even kisses the loose newel cap when it comes off the post again. And then, of course, we learn that George won’t be going to jail, after all. His wife has set in motion a miracle. The town, his town, is coming to the rescue. And as his brother, Harry, proclaims, amidst the gathering throng of family and friends, George is “the richest man in town.”\n\nCorny? You bet. Sentimental? Gushing! But it’s pure cinematic gold. And every time I watch it, I feel better for the experience.\n\nThis year, more so than ever. Because, for all its contrivances and old-fashioned saccharine qualities, It’s A Wonderful Life emphasizes the good things in life, and reminds us that, even amidst pain and loss and hard times, we have things to be thankful for. Yes, it’s true. For me, Christmas will never be the same. There is an absence there that can never be filled again. But watching George Bailey kissing his broken staircase and laughing over his bloodied lip helps me to see that if I feel loss this Christmas season, it means there is something in my life, in my past, that is special enough and pure enough and loving enough to elicit this feeling in the first place. It’s something to embrace, not flee from. To appreciate and value. And remember.\n\nSo, during this holiday season, I don’t care what the critics say.\n\nPass me the Capricorn.\n\nThanks so much for reading, and I hope you all have a blessed and joyous holiday.\n\n–Mike"
