When a longshoreman is murdered before he can testify about Friendlys control of the Hoboken waterfront, Terry teams up with the dead man’s sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint) and the streetwise priest Father Barry (Karl Malden) to testify himself, against the advice of Friendlys lawyer, Terry’s older brother Charley (Rod Steiger).\n\nSpecial introduction to the film and a Q&A following with John DiLeo, prominent film historian, critic, and author of seven books about classic movies.\n\nThe Milford Theater Bar will be open one hour before the show, serving wine, beer, cocktails, and concessions!"
