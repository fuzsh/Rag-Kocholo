Rod Steiger is his elder brother, torn between loyalty to union and love of family. Lee J. Cobb is the powerful union boss, while Eva Marie Saint is the girl with whom Brando falls in love.\n\nWinner of 8 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay, this devastating film has, in the 70 years since its release, become one of the movie greats.\n\nScreening in a stunning 4K restoration."
