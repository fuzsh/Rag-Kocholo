        "text": "If you were to go to the dictionary and look up \"Cool Guy\" you wouldn't find anything—not a single thing at all—because it's not in the dictionary, you idiot. But if you were to find anything, you'd find a picture of Marlon Brando back in the '50s. The guy was so cool he practically brought the T-shirt to the mainstream. He didn't just wear clothes, he became them: If you wanted to be like him all you had to do was throw on a white T-shirt, a black jacket, slick your hair back a bit, and brood. (That kind of behavior still works today, quite frankly.) The point being: he made simple and effortless and minimal look cool.\n\nBrando won an Oscar for his performance in On the Waterfront, a gritty drama about labor unions in the rough and tumble days of '50s-era Red Hook, Brooklyn. You may know it for being the one where Marlon Brando goes \"I coulda been a contender! I coulda been somebody!\" Now, y'see, for like 9/10th of that movie, he's wearing a simple black jacket—the exact same as most any dock worker in that era would have worn—and he makes it look insanely cool. Proving once again that it's not what you wear; most of the time, it's how you wear it.\n\nThe Real McCoy's and Bench & Loom teamed up to make the exact same jacket that Brando wore right here ($725, limited edition of 30). Wool lined and with a shearling collar, it's perfect for winter. It's also made out of Jungle Cloth (a WWII era cloth used by the military) on vintage Japanese looms, which means that it's tear-resistant, water-repellant, and warm as hell. It's masculine and minimal and tough as leather. Even if you're not built like a slice of toast like Marlon was, it'll make you look ten feet tall."
