        "text": "Marlon Brando is the longshoreman who finds himself increasingly isolated when he challenges the might and power of the tough New York City dockers' union. Rod Steiger is his elder brother, torn between loyalty to union and love of family. Lee J. Cobb is the powerful union boss, while Eva Marie Saint is the girl with whom Brando falls in love.\n\nWinner of eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Support Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay, this devastating film has been acknowledged as one of the cinematic greats since its very first screening."
