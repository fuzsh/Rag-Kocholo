        "text": "Starring : Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Pat Henning and Eva Marie Saint\n\nDirector : Elia Kazan\n\nDuration Running Time : (approx) 1 Hour 48 Minutes (108 Mins)\n\nDistribution : (1954) Horizon Pictures, Columbia Pictures Corporation, (2024) Horizon Pictures, Columbia Pictures Corporation, Park Circus Limited\n\nCertification Rating Certificate : (1954) 'A'. (2024) PG - Parental Guidance\n\n'ON THE WATERFRONT' is in fact an American dramatic film originally released in 1954, and starring Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Pat Henning and also Eva Marie Saint in her film debut.\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan, the movie in question, explores the world of corrupt dockworkers as well as union violence amongst the longshoremen, while also detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and also the racketeering on the waterfronts, that are originally situated in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nThe original screenplay was written by Budd Schulberg, who originally drew the inspiration from the 'real-life' waterfront corruption scandals that plagued the docks during the 1940's and also the 1950's.\n\nThe movie in question features one of Marlon Brando's most memorable movie performances in his film career, and was nominated for 'TWELVE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS' - AND WON 'EIGHT ACADEMY AWARDS' - including 'BEST ACTOR' - Brando, 'BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS' - Eva Marie Saint - this was in fact 'her film debut' - 'BEST DIRECTOR' - Kazan - and 'BEST PICTURE'.\n\nOn its original release back in 1954, the film in question, was a critical and also a commercial success - and is also considered as 'ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE', by 1997, 'forty-three' years after its original release, the American Film Institute - 'AFI' - as 'THE EIGHTH-GREATEST AMERICAN MOVIE OF ALL TIME' -but 'ten years later' - 2007 - the film in question - was ranked as 'NUMBER NINETEEN' in 'AFI's film list of 2007, - but also that the film composed by Leonard Bernstein - was in fact - 'his only original film score' that isn't 'adapted' from a stage production with songs.\n\nNow the film that's originally shown in 'BLACK AND WHITE' was inspired by 'CRIME ON THE WATERFRONT' by Malcolm Johnson, this was in fact based on a series of articles that was originally published back in 1948, during the months of November/December in the 'NEW YORK SUN' - and which also won Johnson the 'PULITZER PRIZE' in 1949 for 'local reporting' - but the screenplay by Schulberg, in question - was in fact directly 'based on his original story - and also 'six years earlier' before the film was originally released in 1954.\n\nThis film in question, happens to be widely considered as Kazan's answer to those who criticized him for identifying at least 'EIGHT COMMUNISTS' in the film industry before the House Committee of Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, and it turns out that Arthur Miller, the noted playwright and also one of his critics which turned out to be his friend and also a collaborator, but as it turns out, it was Miller who had earlier written the script that was originally titled as 'THE HOOK', and that Kazan had also agreed to direct it - but in 1951, 'one year earlier' they met with Harry Cohn, co-founder, president and also a production director - based at Columbia Pictures, a renowned film studio about making the picture.\n\nHowever, Cohn, agreed in principle to make 'THE HOOK' - but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.\n\nBut when Cohn asked that 'the antagonists' be changed to 'communists', Miller had simply refused, so then Cohn had then sent a letter telling Miller 'it was interesting' that he had resisted Columbia Pictures desire to make the 'picture' as '' pro-American '' and that Kazan asked Miller to ''rewrite the script'', however Miller then declined - due to his disenchantment with Kazan's ''friendly testimony'' before the 'HUAC' - and that Kazan had replaced Miller - with - Schulberg.\n\nAnd now in 2024, 'ON THE WATERFRONT' the film in question, is finally returning to movie theaters by celebrating its 'milestone' 70th Anniversary - and has also been reissued in a brand new restoration 4K film print, but also that Brando in question - 2024 - would have celebrated - his milestone 100th birthday, having been born on April 4, 1924.\n\nThe plot of the movie in question, begins by introducing a 'small group of racketeers' that run 'the docks' of Hoboken, New Jersey, and also revolves around Terry Malloy, (Brando), a former prizefighter in his late twenties and who now works as 'an errand boy' for Johnny Friendly, (aka Michael J. Skelly - his real name - Cobb), as a longshoreman, and also a union head.\n\nBut then Terry, in question, is coerced into luring Joey Doyle, (Ben Wagner), a fellow worker onto a rooftop, and where he believes that Friendly's ''henchmen'' in question, want to talk to Joey out of testifying to the 'WATERFRONT CRIME COMMISSION'.\n\nBut when they instead murder Joey - by simply throwing him off the roof, Terry, in question, is naturally upset, by what has happened, and confronts Friendly, but is soon threatened by Friendly, and also 'bribed' into acquiescence.\n\nThe film in question, then follows Terry who by now, is struggling with his conscience, his romantic relationship with Edie, (Saint), and also his eventual decision to 'stand up' against 'the corrupt union bosses'.\n\nJust for the record, a 'longshoreman', which is also known as a 'docker' or even a 'stevedore' is in fact 'a waterfront manual laborer' who is involved in loading and also unloading ships.\n\nThe term 'longshoreman' is originated from the word ''shore'' - which in turn refers to the 'land' or even 'shoreline', - and also ''man'' - indicating - 'a person' - or even 'a worker'.\n\nThe prefix ''long'' is added to emphasise the 'geographical length' of the dock or even shoreline.\n\nAlso, the name '' longshoreman'' accurately describes the role of these workers that are located in the maritime industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the history of 'longshoremen' dates back to ancient times. Dockworkers in question, especially, have been essential to maritime trade since ancient times.\n\nThe Phoenicians, Greeks and also Romans, all relied on the dockworkers, to load and also unload cargo from ships that are situated from bustling 'port cities' such as Carthage, Athens, and also Ostia.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, many dockworkers played a crucial part in the 'trade networks' of Europe.\n\nHowever, The Industrial Revolution, brought significant changes to the roles of dockworkers.\n\nAfter the 'shipping container' revolution of the 1960's, the required dockworkers, in question, had declined by over 90%.\n\nAlso, for the record, 'THE WATERFRONT CRIME COMMISSION' - SITUATED IN 'NEW YORK HARBOR' - in question - is indeed associated with the movie of 'ON THE WATERFRONT'.\n\nThe 'COMMISSION' in question was originally set up in August 1953, a year before the film was released in 1954, and that the movie featuring Marlon Brando, depicted the corruption, extortion, and also the organised crimes that were situated on the waterfronts of the port of New York and Jersey.\n\n'THE WATERFRONT COMMISSION' in question - was in fact originally created as a 'bi-state' agency by New York and also New Jersey these issues.\n\nIts unique mission, was to investigate, deter, combat, and also remedy 'the criminal activity' and also the influence in the port district - and also ensure the fair hiring as well as the employment practises.\n\nThe commission's efforts in question - also led to the conviction of organised-crime members and also the associates for various crimes - as well as its investigations which had also led to the exclusion as well as the removals from the Port workforce of individuals - who were convicted of serious crimes - or were even associated with organized crime.\n\nThen in 2023, the United States Supreme Court ruled that New Jersey in question could unilaterally exit 'THE WATERFRONT COMMISSION'.\n\nBut that despite this, that the influence of organized crime - remains as a significant threat in the 'NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA' - particularly in 'THE PORT'.\n\nAlso 'THE NEW YORK WATERFRONT COMMISSION' was enacted in 2023, basically to carry on the unique mission - situated in the Port Of New York.\n\nSo in fact, that both 'ON THE WATERFRONT' - the movie - as well as - 'THE REAL-LIFE WATERFRONT COMMISSION OF NEW YORK HARBOR' - are in fact - both connected - as both of these - deal with the many issues involving corruption and also organized crime - that are situated on the waterfronts of both 'THE PORT OF NEW YORK AND ALSO NEW JERSEY', and also that the 1954 movie - had helped to raise 'public awareness' about these important issues, while the 'COMMISSION' in question - was -'established' to combat them - in real life.\n\nJust for the record, 'ON THE WATERFRONT' was filmed entirely on location in Hoboken, New Jersey, at various places including 'the docks', 'workers slum dwellings', 'bars', 'littered alleys', and also 'rooftops' in just 'thirty-six days', but also that 'the church' that was originally used for 'the exterior scenes' that was used in the movie - was in fact - 'the historic - Our Lady Of Grace - this is in fact a 'ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH', situated in Hoboken, New Jersey, and originally built in 1874, while the 'interiors' were originally shot 'entirely on location' at the Church of St Peter and St Paul, originally situated at 400 Hudson Street, Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nNow the legacy of the movie, which by the way in 2024, celebrates its 70th anniversary, is significant in many ways such as a cultural impact, an influence in the history of cinema, the social impact, and also the historical context, for this is without doubt a unique film that should be seen as a masterpiece of classic cinema - which it certainly is - and is regarded by many - including yours truly as a great film - and is one film - that has been shown on tv many times - but that the only way to see this timeless masterpiece - is at your movie theater - situated in your establishments throughout the world - the editing, the photography, the music score, and most important the performances by all involved are quite outstanding - and that if you see one masterpiece of a movie -complete with the greatest quotes that were delivered on the big screen - then make sure - that this is the one to see - on the big screen - because this is without doubt classed as :\n\n'THE MAGICAL MASTERPIECE OF A MOVIE CLASSIC IN CINEMATIC HISTORY'\n\nDon't Miss It !\n\nDavid M.G.Mitchell."
