        "text": "Hope College Knickerbocker Theatre's Marlon Brando-themed “One Night Only” series will return this Monday.\n\nBrando is considered one of the greatest actors of all time. He was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning two. He also won four Golden Globes.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m. Monday, April 30, Knickerbocker will show, “The Wild One.” It is a 1953 film starring Brando, Mary Murphy and Lee Marvin. After causing trouble in Carbonville, Calif., Johnny Strabler, played by Brando, and his biker gang head to the small and quiet town of Wrightville. After one of the bikers gets into an accident, the gang is forced to remain longer than anticipated and proves disruptive to the town while Johnny falls for Kathie, the daughter of a police officer. The situation grows worse when a rival biker gang, led by Chino (Marvin), arrives.\n\nThe series will conclude the following week, on May 7 with “On the Waterfront,” a 1954 crime drama starring Brando, Rod Steiger, Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint. Brando plays ex prize-fighter Terry Malloy, who works for Johnny Friendly (Cobb), a corrupt boss who has control of the waterfront union. After witnessing a murder commissioned by Friendly, Terry meets Edie Doyle (Saint), the sister of the man who was murdered. Terry feels obligated to testify against Friendly after meeting Edie and the priest Father Berry (Malden). However, Terry struggles to testify against his threatening boss, whose right-hand man is Terry’s brother, Charley Malloy (Steiger). The film won eight Academy Awards.\n\nThe Knickerbocker Theatre’s “One Night Series” features one actor or genre, with some of the past highlights being Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and Westerns.\n\nTickets are $5, with admission free for Hope students. Tickets will be sold at the door but are also available in advance at the Events and Conferences Office downtown in the Anderson-Werkman Financial Center, 100 E. Eighth St. The office is open 8 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays and can be called at 616-395-7890.\n\nKnickerbocker Theatre is in downtown Holland at 86 E. Eighth St."
