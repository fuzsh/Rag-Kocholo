        "text": "• 100% perfect replica of the jacket worn by Marlon Brando in \"On the Waterfront\"\n\n• 1950s style\n\n• Relaxed fit\n\n• Zip closure\n\n• High grade knitted waistband and cuffs\n\n• Made from 100% ‘hard wool’ woven in the UK and exclusive to Aero\n\n• Available in Green and Black or Red and Black\n\n• Pictured left in Red and Black Buffalo Check wool\n\nAero Waterfronts in Red and Black ready to order from stock. If you cannot find your size or want an alternative lining, you can order one via the main listing.\n\nFor many years we've been making \"The Waterfront\", a reproduction of the 1950's Buffalo checked work jacket worn by Brando in \"On The Waterfront\". Like everyone else, we believed Brando's jacket was Green & Black, until some rare colour footage was discovered a few years ago showing the film jacket was, in fact, Red and Black.\n\nConsequently, we now offer a 100% perfect replica of the film jacket, in both Green and Red. The cloth is woven by a British Mill capable of replicating the look and feel of a wool cloth typical of pre-WW2 utility wear, something that these days is rarely found outside vintage clothing stores.\n\nThe jacket is hand-made in Scotland in our Galashiels factory and it's fitted with 100% wool knit in black, a heavy black cotton drill lining as standard and a period style zipper. It has been drawn to our attention that the checks on our version match perfectly, while the jacket used in the film was very badly matched. Sorry, but we just can't bring ourselves to send out a mismatched version, it's just not Aero!!!!\n\nThis jacket is a 1950s inspired design which offers a fit with quite a bit of room around the body which was typical of the more relaxed fitting styles of this era.\n\nThe perceived ‘correct’ fit of the 1950s was generally more ‘oversized’ than modern sizing, so we typically recommend either selecting your usual size for this style to achieve the intended ‘1950s’ relaxed fit, although many choose to size down for a more modern fitted look.\n\nFor further general sizing information, please see our sizing FAQ section. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for there, please get in touch.\n\nDon’t worry, all sizing information displayed here is only a guide. Every order placed is checked over by a member of our production team who will confirm your size selection against your measurements or recommend any necessary changes that need to be made. If you have any specific queries, you can note these in the special instructions box on the ‘measurements’ page when placing your order."
