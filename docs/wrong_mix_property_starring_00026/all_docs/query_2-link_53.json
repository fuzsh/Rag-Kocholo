        "text": "Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Elia Kazan’s elegy to American corruption, redemption, and missed opportunity returns in a brand new restoration.\n\nBrando stars as Terry Malloy, a former boxer turned longshoreman. Feeling guilt over his involvement in the death of a fellow worker, Terry finds himself increasingly isolated when he challenges the power of local union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb).\n\nThe screening will be introduced by film academic Ed Jackson.\n\nDuration includes trailers, adverts and any Q&A/panel. For events such as NT Live, Colour Box and Reel & Meal there will be minimal advertising. We do not admit latecomers after the main feature has started and we have a limited food & drink policy.\n\nMAC’s cinema programme has been generously supported by BFI Film Audience Network and Film Hub Midlands."
