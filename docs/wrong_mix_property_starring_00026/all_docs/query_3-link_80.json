        "text": "been portrayed in numerous movies over multiple decades. I personally prefer the 1950’s version starring Marlon Brando as Antony over the 1970’s version starring Charlton Heston as Antony instead. The 1970’s version did have the advantage of being in color, but the 1950’s version acting had much more passion. The difference between the two actors as Antony was like day and night for me. Marlon Brando’s acting had heart compared to Charlton Heston’s which felt as if he were reading it straight off\n\ndirected by Francis Ford Coppola. The lead character is played by Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), with supporting actors Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone), James Caan (Sonny Corleone), Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen), Kay (Diane Keaton) The story of this movie is about the book Mario Puzo \"The Godfather based on one of the most powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). And when the youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), begins to join the family Mafia, a business he becomes more involved\n\n1. The Godfather, placed among the topmost videos in American movie theater, starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Adam Caan and Robert Duvall arrived in 1972. It had been made by Albert S. Ruddy and aimed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film predicated on the time course of 1945 to 1955, portrayed the main actors as market leaders of a criminal offense group in NY. The storyline revolves around the type Michael Corleone, enjoyed by Pacino, and shows how a typical man turns to be an underworld gangster\n\nsaturday evening post, so that his perception of gender equality could be exposed to all members of the general public in the hope to break national stereotypes. Another work by Sid Avery can be seen in plate 2, where we see a realistic photograph of Marlon Brando taking\n\nWhile it was developed years ago, and became a prominent style back in the 1930’s here in the States, to this day, it endures and continues to prove it’s worth. Many high profile actors still swear by it, including Daniel Day Lewis, Robert DeNiro, Marlon Brando, Nicholas Cage, Jim Carrie, Leonardo DiCaprio and even Johnny Depp. The list goes on and on, but there are two that stand out for their performances and styles presented in opposing roles of the same movie. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger played\n\nand conflicts. At the heart of the narrative is Terry Malloy, played by Marlon Brando, a dockworker torn between loyalty to his corrupt union and his conscience. Through Terry and other key characters, the film explores themes of loyalty, corruption, and the quest for individual integrity amidst societal pressures. Terry Malloy serves as the focal point of the narrative, a conflicted protagonist struggling to find his\n\nGodfather and Apocalypse Now, both are great movies, and both are the first windows, through which I first saw America. At the first sight, these two movies seem to have a lot of similarities: both are one of the best hits in history, both starred by Marlon Brando and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, both slow-paced and 3-hour long, and both had a deep influence in the American society. On the other hand, two movies have so little in common: one is talking about the Mafia in New York, yet the other is demonstrating\n\nthat they used oil and wax on. An extreme Greaser was called a Stone Greaser. They rode motorcycles and wore leather jackets. They also wore white t-shirts, jeans with rolled up cuffs, and motorcycle boots. The were influenced by Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando, and James Dean. Socs was an abbreviation for socials. They were known as the social butterflies and the rich kids. They had nice clothes and cars. They were high in social status as well. They wore buttoned up t-shirts, ties,\n\nThe idea of company man turned savage, of a brilliant and successful team-player, being groomed by \"the Company\" for greater things, suddenly gone native, is perfectly realized in both novella and film. In the film, Kurtz is portrayed by Marlon Brando, the father of American method actors, who lends weight (both physically and dramatically) to the figure of the megalomaniacal Kurtz. Brando's massive girth is all the more ironic for those familiar with Heart of Darkness who recall Conrad's description:\n\nis anything but a romantic love story. Last Tango In Paris is an intellectual sexual drama that bases itself on the sexual union of two very different people in the bohemian setting of Paris during the post-sexual liberation era of the 1970s. Marlon Brando plays a troubled middle aged American, Paul, who rents an apartment with an attractive and confident Parisian, Jeanne (Maria Schneider). It is in this room that the two pursue a sordid affair where Paul insists that neither of them know each others"
