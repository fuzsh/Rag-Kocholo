        "text": "In Elia Kazan’s crime-drama classic ON THE WATERFRONT (1954) legendary actor Marlon Brando gave one of the seminal performances of his career as Terry Malloy a boxer who could’ve been a champion but turned into just another palooka because he got paid to take falls for the short end money. We get to know Terry in the midst of a tough personal dilemna when the police begin trying to bust up the underworld influence on the longshoreman’s union which he happens to be a part of. A ruthless mob boss named Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) controls the waterfront and the workers along with Charley (Rod Steiger) Terry’s older brother which makes his troubles even more dire. Terry also falls in love with a local girl (Eva Marie Saint) but their relationship becomes strained in the midst of the turmoil surrounding his problems with the mob. The depiction of the working class people has been noted by Director Martin Scorsese as being extremely authentic and based in a reality he knew. It remains both an emotionally powerful urban tale and a cinematic time capsule of what life was like in that rough and tumble world.\n\nFor classic cinema fans this upcoming release from Criterion Collection is a must own. It will be on sale February 19th.\n\nSpecial Features:"
