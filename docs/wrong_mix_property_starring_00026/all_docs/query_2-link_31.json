        "text": "Newsdesk\n\nShare with:\n\nTo celebrate the 70th anniversary of cinematic masterpiece, On the Waterfront, Park Circus is re-releasing a 4k restored version of the film from 5th April 2024 across the UK, Ireland and selected international territories. This re-release also marks the joint 100th anniversary of Columbia Pictures and the birth of the film’s star Marlon Brando. It is also available to Rent or Buy on Digital.\n\nOn The Waterfront was a critical and commercial success and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. It received twelve Academy Award® nominations and won eight, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brando, Best Supporting Actress for Saint, and Best Director.\n\nMarlon Brando stars as Terry Malloy, a washed-up prizefighter who, through the influence of his brother, Charley (Rod Steiger), a lawyer for a corrupt waterfront union, is employed as an errand boy for the mob. After luring a fellow dockworker and friend to his death to keep him from testifying against labor boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the appeals of the dead man's sister (Eva Marie Saint) and a crusading priest (Karl Malden) awaken Terry's guilty conscience. Despite a brutal beating at the hands of Friendly's goons, love prompts Terry to seek redemption by cooperating with a crime commission's investigation into the corrupt waterfront union.\n\nThis re-release forms part of a wider year-long celebration of 100 Years of Columbia Pictures, with further UK/Eire Park Circus re-releases to follow throughout the year.\n\nColumbia Pictures was founded by brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and best friend Joe Brandt on January 10, 1924. After Capra’s It Happened One Night swept the Oscars, Columbia Pictures established itself as an elite studio, responsible for numerous films from award-winners and timeless classics to pop-culture phenomenon including: It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, You Can't Take it With You, Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner, From Here to Eternity, On The Waterfront, Lawrence of Arabia, To Sir With Love, Funny Girl, Taxi Driver, Tootsie, The Karate Kid, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Men In Black, Ghostbusters, Boyz n the Hood, Groundhog Day, A League Of Their Own, The Social Network, Jumanji, Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, Little Women, Spider-Man, and many more."
