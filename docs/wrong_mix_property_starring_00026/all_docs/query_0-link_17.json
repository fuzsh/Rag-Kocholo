        "text": "The 1954 classic, On the Waterfront, is hailed for its gripping storyline and its star-studded cast. From Marlon Brando’s dedicated method acting to Eva Marie Saint’s beautiful portrayal of Edie Doyle, it is no wonder this film was and continues to be a big success. However, this Old Hollywood gem’s story and fame is much more complicated than most may expect.\n\nOn the Waterfront was one film of many produced during the first decade of the Cold War in America. This period of time saw large distrust of all things Russian and Communist. The HUAC, or the House of Un-American Activities Committee, was tasked with rooting out all members of the Communist party and blacklisting them from society. More often than not, though, any accused member called before the board would see the total destruction of their reputations and careers, regardless of their party loyalty. This “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” narrative had a devastating impact on writers, directors, and actors in Hollywood during this time, and many felt trapped by their current political climate.\n\nElia Kazan, director of On the Waterfront, was no exception. In the decade prior, Kazan had been involved in an actors guild entitled the Group Theatre. This group of arti sts was mainly Communist, and Kazan had subscribed to their ideas in his youth. Although he had moved toward political moderation in his later years, nonetheless he was summoned in front of HUAC and coerced to give names of his co-conspirators. At this moment, Kazan made a choice that would forever impact the rest of his career: he confessed. He gave HUAC the names of eight members of his Group Theatre troupe, and he himself faced no condemnation from the board. However, this act did not save him from the condemnation from his peers.\n\nOne key dissenter to Kazan’s actions was famous playwright Arthur Miller. Although Miller himself never identified as a Communist, he had many friends in the Hollywood community that had their reputations destroyed because of their political beliefs. Shortly after his marriage with Marilyn Monroe and further rise to fame and recognition, he was called before HUAC to testify. Unlike Kazan, though, he did not give up any names or betray his friends’ identities . Although he was blacklisted and his career took a significant blow, Miller was able to bounce back out of peoples’ respect for his honor and fortitude. Because of this, Miller took Kazan’s actions as a personal offense and abruptly ended their friendship. Miller’s refusal to associate with Kazan any further would prove to be pivotal to both of their careers for the next decade.\n\nAlmost directly following Kazan’s trial, Miller wrote the 1953 classic, The Crucible. This play takes place during the Salem Witch Trials–another period of history where people were condemned due to speculation and reputation–, and emphasizes the importance of fortitude, names, and identity. When viewed in its historical context, it is clear that The Crucible directly reflects Miller’s resentment toward Kazan and his cowardice.\n\nAnother project that served as collateral for this action was On the Waterfront. The film was originally entitled Red Hook, written by Arthur Miller, intended to be directed by Kazan, and following the true stories of longshoremen from New Jersey. However, this script was abandoned once the pair cut ties with each other. Rather than scrapping the film entirely, Kazan radically changed the storyline to fit his ideals.\n\nTerry Molloy, played flawlessly by the ever-talented Marlon Brando, is shown standing up against the oppressive Mafia forces in his town and confessing to the police in order to help rid his society of corruption. Although Molloy is initially outcast from society due to his “stool-pigeoning”–a term commonly used in the 1950s to connote and label snitches–, eventually the townspeople forgive him and learn to realize that honesty is the best policy. This film–along with an exten sive, apologetic New York Times column published by Kazan–served as justification for his actions, and a plea to his fellow Hollywood citizens to forgive him for his alleged transgressions.\n\nAlthough the film swept the Academy awards in 1955 and received eight Oscars, its messages were not well-received by its viewers–especially Arthur Miller. Shortly after, Miller wrote “A View from the Bridge”: another play condemning cowardice and reinforcing themes of honor, identity, and personal strength. Miller sent the final draft of the play to Kazan as an attempted jab at the director for his deplorable actions several years prior. However, rather than recognizing Miller’s animosity, Kazan believed that this was the playwright’s attempt at reconciliation, and he sent a telegraph back noting his eagerness and excitement to direct a film version of the play. Miller later sent back a telegraph for further clarification, reading, “I only sent you the script to let you know what I think of stool-pigeons.”\n\nIn tumultuous periods of history like these, it is important to note just how much an environment can impact a piece of art. No play or film is made in a vacuum, and each work is influenced by its auteurs and their perspectives. At the same time, though, it is important to note that the reverse is just as true. Both Kazan and Miller significantly impacted Hollywood’s perspective on the Cold War through their art, and the world will be forever changed because of their contributions."
