There is a huge counter space where we were able to serve food, a large fridge and freezer we used to store the food and drinks until it was time to serve them. Our guests loved the foosball table and shuffleboard games! We played music on huge smart tv and it was spacious enough that all of us were very comfortable. Highly recommend!!!”\n\n– Jenny P.\n\n“Overall we enjoyed our time at The Residences of Auburn Hills. The staff was always polite and all service requests were handled promptly. My only issue was some amenities weren’t always available due to renovation but that being said once completed the amenities were phenomenal. They even have a dog wash, such a unique feature!!!”\n\n– Melissa G.\n\n“The Residences of Auburn Hills us a great place to live. They are super pet friendly! The office works with you to fix things in the apartment. Also, they are working on updating the halls. We love ❤️ our apartment. They have also added a pet wash and treat store.”\n\n– Michelle H."
