        "text": "I wish I could give it 20 stars!! This beautiful park has summer and winter sports, gorgeous scenery year around. I encourage everyone to come and enjoy, even if aren’t able to walk, take a drive, have a picnic. You can sit and read, lay in a hammock, walk, run, bike, fish, play on a beach, walk through wooded areas and paved trails. There’s a nature center, a farm area, horse back riding, golf, canoeing, kayaking, boating, water park, beaches, picnic shelters and bathrooms everywhere, there is so many. A golf course, disc golf? ( not sure if that’s what it’s called!! I can’t list it all but I can say i absolutely find solace, peace and happiness here!!!!\n\nWanting to ride only on the paved section, we hopped on in Hamburg and headed toward Pinckney. There is plenty of parking for the trail just kitty-corner from the Hamburg Pub. There is a lot of intermittent shade which helped on this 86 degree day. The trail is extremely well- maintained and we were on the paved section for about 8 1/2 miles till we started going through Pinckney. Then it turned to gravel so we turned around and headed back. We planned to eat at the Hamburg Pub but the Trump 2024 lawn sign at the pub was a turn-off so we instead headed a couple miles down the road to Zukey Lake Tavern. It was beautiful up on the deck. The food was OK and the cold draft beer was perfect.\n\nThe longest single connected trail I've ridden in Michigan so far. If you ride it all the way from Jackson to Brighton it's about 40 miles, but there's plenty of places to stop by in-between that show up about every 6 miles. Gregory is about halfway through and offers some good food options for anyone looking to make the full trek.\n\nThe trail from Hamburg MI going into Brighton is completely paved and beautiful. Everything from Hamburg going into Jackson is unpaved crushed limestone, and while there's beautiful wildlife around every corner the path can wear you out do the crushed limestone path. Still gives you a beautiful look at different Michigan biomes along the way and is in the middle of nature and away from the busy cityscape for most of the ride.\n\nI live in Lake Orion and ride this trail often. It is well maintained and very scenic.It does get a little crowded on the weekend. La pumas is a get stop to power for the ride back to Lake Orion."
