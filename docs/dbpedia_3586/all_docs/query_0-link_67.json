The population was 19,837 at the 2000 census. The 2008 census estimate places the population at 20,931. The city was formed in 1983 when Pontiac Township became the City of Auburn Hills.\" - from Wikipedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Hills,_Michigan\n\nWhen I contacted the city [2008 or 2009] it didn't have a flag. Later [in 2011] they adopted a white flag with city logo on it: www.flickr.com/photos/auburnhills/5407737750/sizes/z/in/photostream\n\nOfficial website: www.auburnhills.org\n\nValentin Poposki, 10 July 2011\n\nLogos\n\nimage located by Masao Okazaki, 10 December 2023\n\nSource: https://www.facebook.com/photo\n\nPrevious logo\n\nimage located by Paul Bassinson, 9 September 2019"
