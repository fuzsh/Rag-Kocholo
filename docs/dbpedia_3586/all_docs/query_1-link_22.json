        "text": "City in Michigan, United States\n\nRochester Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 76,300.[4] It is the 14th-largest city in Michigan.[5] It has also ranked as the safest city in Michigan for the past seven years.[6]\n\nThe area was first settled by European Americans in 1817, and organized as Avon Township in 1835. The City of Rochester incorporated in 1967, while the remaining area of Avon Township was incorporated and renamed the City of Rochester Hills in 1984. Considered a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, Rochester Hills is about 12 miles (19.3 km) north of Detroit.\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nStony Creek is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with Rochester at .[7]\n\nYates is on the boundary with Rochester and Shelby Township, Oakland County ( ; Elevation: 669 ft./204 m.).[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to European settlement, the area now known as Rochester Hills was inhabited by Native Americans, namely the Potawatomi.[9] The Potawatomi depended on the area's abundant water sources, such as the Clinton River and Paint Creek, to grow crops, fish, and travel.[9][10] They resided here until the 1807 Treaty of Detroit caused them, along with the Odawa, Wyandot, and Ojibwe peoples, to cede their land in Southeast Michigan.[11][12]\n\nThe first European settler was James Graham who arrived in 1817. Graham and his family reached the area by following trails created by the Sauk Native Americans.[13][14] Avon Township was organized in 1835. Rochester incorporated as a village within the township in 1869. The township adopted a charter in 1948 under the Home Rule Act. Also in 1948 a post office was established under the name of Brooklands for the area between Auburn Road and Hamlin Road just to the west of Dequindre Road.\n\nIn 1966, village residents voted to become the City of Rochester, effective in February 1967. As a result, Rochester residents no longer had to pay property taxes to the township, as it was now a separate municipality.\n\nIn 1967, Avon Township filed a petition to become a city. In January 1968, township voters approved the petition to move forward with seeking city status. Three proposed city charters were voted down by residents, the first in March 1969, the second in May 1970, and the third in September 1971. The city of Rochester then sought to annex all of the township, which was unanimously denied by the Michigan Boundary Commission. In 1972, petitions were filed to consolidate Avon Township and Rochester. In April 1974, the consolidation petition lost by 350 votes in the township, while passing by four votes in Rochester. In May 1974, Rochester's petition to annex 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2) of Avon Township was approved by the Michigan Boundary Commission, depriving Avon Township of its largest taxpayer.[16] The township became Avon Charter Township in August 1978. Court challenges to the 1974 annexation continued until November 1981, when the township was ordered to surrender the annexed property. An impending annexation request from the City of Troy, due south, for 300 acres of southeast Avon Township brought the cityhood question to a crisis.[16]\n\nIn May 1984, township voters approved a city charter. On November 20, 1984, Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills. The name of the new city was put to a vote, with the other choice being \"Avon Hills.\" The name \"Rochester Hills\" won by a landslide with voters, based on the area's historical ties to Rochester and the rolling hills in the area. Township Supervisor Earl E. Borden became the first mayor of Rochester Hills.\n\nIn June 2024, there was a mass shooting in the city.[17][18]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 32.91 square miles (85.24 km2), of which 32.82 square miles (85.00 km2) is land and 0.09 square miles (0.23 km2) (0.27%) is water.[19]\n\nRochester Hills is bordered to the north by Oakland Charter Township along Dutton Road, to the south by the city of Troy along South Boulevard, to the east by Shelby Township in Macomb County along Dequindre Road, and to the west by the city of Auburn Hills along part of Adams Road. Rochester Hills is also partially bordered by the city of Rochester to the east. Elevations in the city range from 690 feet (210 m) above sea level in the southeastern portion of the city to 1,032 feet (315 m) in the northwestern section.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 199061,766—200068,82511.4%201070,9953.2%202076,3007.5%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2020 census,[21] there were 76,293 people, in 28,766 households, residing in the city. The population density was 2,359.9 inhabitants per square mile (911.2/km2).

The gender makeup of the city was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nRochester Hills has a mayor-council government. The Rochester Hills City Council consists of seven Council Members: four district members and three at-large members. They are elected to four-year terms and, due to term limiting, can serve no more than two terms for a maximum of eight years. However, there are no limits on how many times the mayor can run for re-election as a write-in candidate.\n\nRochester Hills does not have a police department, so the city's police services are provided by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office. The 52nd District Court Division Three is also located in Rochester Hills.\n\nIn the 2020 United States presidential election in Michigan, 23,173 (50.67%) votes went to Joseph Biden and 21,680 (47.4%) votes were cast for Donald Trump.[25]\n\nFederally, Rochester Hills is split between Michigan's 8th congressional district, represented by Democrat Elissa Slotkin, and Michigan's 11th congressional district, represented by Democrat Haley Stevens. However, as of 2023, Rochester Hills will be appended to the Macomb County-centered Michigan's 10th congressional district.[26]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nRochester Community Schools serve most of the city. Rochester Adams High School, Rochester High School, and Stoney Creek High School are in Rochester Hills. The city also hosts college and graduate-level programs in various disciplines at Oakland University and Rochester Christian University.\n\nSome portions of the city, however, are in the Avondale School District. Much of the ASD portion of Rochester Hills is zoned to Deerfield Elementary School, also within the city. Other portions are zoned to Auburn Elementary School in Auburn Hills and Woodland Elementary School in Troy. All ASD residents are zoned to Avondale Middle School in Rochester Hills and Avondale High School in Auburn Hills. The Meadows School, Avondale Academy, and the ASD transportation department are all in Rochester Hills.[27]\n\nCity services include Rochester Hills Public Library. (The neighboring City of Rochester and Oakland Township contract with the City of Rochester Hills to permit their residents' use of the library.)\n\nThe Japanese School of Detroit, a supplementary school for Japanese citizens of school age, at one time had its administrative offices in the former Oakland Steiner School in Rochester Hills.[28]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: People from Detroit\n\nThis list includes people from Rochester and Rochester Hills:\n\nMike Bishop, politician\n\nTommy Clufetos, professional drummer\n\nPaul Davis, professional basketball player\n\nEric Fisher, professional football player\n\nHal Foster, artist and writer\n\nAmy Frazier, professional tennis player[29]\n\nJay Gibbons, professional baseball player[30]\n\nAndrew Good, professional baseball player\n\nIdris Goodwin, playwright, poet, activist, professor\n\nShawn Hare, professional baseball player\n\nEminem, rapper\n\nGreg and Tim Hildebrandt, fantasy artists and painters of the original Star Wars movie poster\n\nRude Jude, television and radio personality\n\nGeorge Jamison, professional football player\n\nBob Keselowski, NASCAR driver\n\nBrad Keselowski, NASCAR driver\n\nBrian Keselowski, NASCAR driver\n\nWalt Kowalczyk, professional football player\n\nJana Kramer, country music singer and actress\n\nMadonna, pop singer and actress\n\nAlec Martinez, professional hockey player\n\nCraig Owens, lead singer of Chiodos and Cinematic Sunrise\n\nRoxy Petrucci, drummer of Vixen\n\nBrian Sell, marathoner\n\nHaley Stevens, politician\n\nRon Teachworth, educator, artist, writer and filmmaker\n\nDita von Teese, burlesque artist, model and actress[31]\n\nJacob Trouba, hockey player\n\nPeter Vanderkaay, Olympic gold medal swimmer[32]\n\nJason Varitek, professional baseball player\n\nRobert Simpson Woodward, physicist and mathematician[33]\n\nGeorge Zamka, NASA astronaut and Marine Corps pilot\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nRomig, Walter (October 1, 1986) [1973].
