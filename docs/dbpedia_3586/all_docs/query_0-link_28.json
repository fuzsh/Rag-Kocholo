        "text": "It is a very family friendly environment and close-knit community. From the restaurants to the local parks, it is a very loving feeling. One of my favorite functions is the bands that come to play in Riverside Park. It is great energy and spirit!\n\nAuburn Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Auburn Hills is a smaller but beautiful upcoming tourist destination that is worth a visit. Auburn Hills roughly follows the course of Interstate 75 and is home to a prosperous business community. The Oakland Technology Park was approved by the city in 1985, with Comerica, EDS, and Chrysler to build campuses there. Great lakes mall is the best shopping place. There is sea world and rainforest cafe within great lakes mall. Hoops bar is famous local bar. There is dogpark nearby in orion township. It has oakland university, emerging educational institute. The LEGO model of Detroit was fabulous at great lakes mall. A peaceful play to stay. Many grocery shops available at 10 min drive Walmart, Meijer, Costco.Auburn Hills Skate Park- A skateboard, inline skate and BMX bike park open to all ages and skill levels.\n\ndowntown area is clean, safe, and enjoyable with many family friendly events throughout the year. outskirts of downtown have high traffic volume and not as clean and kept up as the downtown area. as far as I know, there are no public schools in auburn hills.\n\nSo many things to do, such as a the mall or even top golf! If you want a bite to eat, thereâ€™s fast food and name brand restaurants on every corner! Also, Oakland Univeristy lives right in Auburn Hills, perfect if you want to finish a degree!"
