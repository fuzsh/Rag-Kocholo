        "text": "All four of these areas are easily within 30 minutes of Auburn Hills during rush hour, have a downtown retail/entertainment section and include walkable streets and neighborhoods.\n\n[1] the Village of Rochester (not to be confused with Rochester Hills)\n\n[2] the Village of Lake Orion (not to be confused with Orion Township)\n\n[3] the Village of Oxford (not to be confused with Oxford Township)\n\n[4] the Village of Clarkson (not to be confused with...err...Springfield Township ).\n\nThe following observations are based on my opinions; I know more about Lake Orion and Oxford than Rochester and I know even less about Clarkston than the other three villages.\n\nRochester has the the biggest downtown area of the three (six or eight streets north/south by two or four streets east/west) and a good school system. It has better housing stock than Lake Orion or Oxford. It's also closest in to the rest of Metro Detroit. South of Rochester is Oakland University which gives the town a younger feeling. North Rochester is Oakland Township, home to the up-and-coming self-made millionares and sports stars (other places may have McMansions, but Oakland Township has a lot of newly-built actual Mansions) which gives the area a slightly wealthy feeling. Down side to Rochester is housing prices right in the village can be high while the housing stock is usually older.\n\nLake Orion has the next biggest downtown area (four streets by two two or three streets) and is not as busy or as nice as Rochester, but the schools are just as good as Rochester, the streets are emminently walkable and the local community is just as active. While the housing directly in the village is sub-par, there's a newer subdivision just north of the village along Franklin Wright Blvd; you can buy a house there for less than $200K or if you have $400K you can buy a nice 4000 sq foot McMansion right on Long Lake. The downsides are the commute along Lapeer Road (15-20 minutes to go 6 miles) and the road block that is any event at the Palace of Auburn Hills (plan to drive for miles to get around the road obstacles set up by Auburn Hills Police for the benefit of the Palace paying customers).\n\nOxford's downtown is basically a four block stretch along both sides of Lapeer Road (aka Main Street in town). The downtown is not as good as Rochester's but slightly better than Lake Orion's (but no where as good as the Franklin Wright subdivision north of Lake Orion); however, there's an actual movie theater in the downtown area. Downside is that the school system lags behind both Rochester and Lake Orion, it's the farthest commute to Auburn Hills and shares Lake Orion's issue with Palace event detours.\n\nClarkston's downtown is even smaller than Oxford's being only two blocks along both sides of Ortonville Road (again, aka Main Street). However, you'll probably find the best housing stock and the better schools here. Downside are that it's not as walkable, the housing will be pricier, and the I-75 commute can, on occassion, get pretty well jammed up. Still, both my sister and my sister-in-law drove this stretch of I-75 for years for their job commutes to Rochester Hills and didn't seem to mind it.\n\nBasically:\n\nThe housing stock is better in Clarkston, Rochester and that one subdivision just north of Lake Orion.\n\nThe downtowns of Rochester and Oxford are more walkable.\n\nThe downtowns of Rochester and Lake Orion are bigger.\n\nThe stores and restuarants in Rochester and Clarkston are nicer/\"trendier\".\n\nThe schools are better in Rochester, Lake Orion and Clarkston (the school system in Oxford is good, but a step below).\n\nThe communities listed above are all west, north or east of Auburn Hills.\n\nAdd three more communities south of Auburn Hills and within a 45 minute commute:\n\n[5] Birmingham. It's everything you want - and you'll pay top dollar for it. Fantastic seven block by five block downtown area that people from New York City are amazed to find in the Midwest. Excellent school system, hard to find one much better. But living within walking distance of downtown means anywhere from $250K to one million - and the lower priced homes will be 3 bedroom 1 bath aluminum-sided Cape Cods.\n\n[6] Royal Oak. Some like the city, some don't. But the seven block by six block downtown is better than Rochester's. Royal Oak's downtown is a twenty-something bar scene on the week nights from Wednesdays to Saturdays, so it's not family oriented at those times. The school system is said to leave much to be desired. Royal Oak is also large - you will want to concentrate on neighborhoods west and northwest of the downtown area.\n\n[7] Berkley. This is the affordable choice with a good school system. The downtown area runs on both sides of 12 mile for half a mile and down Coolidge Highway for another 3/4 of a mile. As you can guess, Berkley's downtown is very linear, but it's better than Clarkston's downtown but while not as good as Rochester's. I live in Berkley and have worked in Auburn Hills - my commute times were 30 minutes in the morning and 45 minutes in the evening. Berkley suffers from post WW2 aluminum cookie-cutter bungalows so pick your neighborhood carefully. The best neighborhood in Berkley is just west of Woodward Avenue between 12 Mile Road and Wiltshire - but don't go too far past Mortenson Blvd on the west of this neighborhood. The housing in this area tends to be built in the 1920's and 1930's, more square footage, on larger lots and more mixed homes. The other neighborhood in Berkley to look at is called St John's Woods - it's located west of Coolidge Hwy, north of 12 Mile Road and south of Webster. Again, the farther west you go the less desirable the housing stock. St John's is just north of the Berkley downtown area. St John's is mostly brick colonials and bungalows built in the 1920's and the housing quality is very nice. Another factor in St John's favor is that a lot of residents at Beaumont Hospital tend to buy their first houses in that neighborhood - this ensures a ready demand when the time comes to sell."
