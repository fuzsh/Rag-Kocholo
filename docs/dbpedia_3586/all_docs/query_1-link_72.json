        "text": "Planning assistance funds empower communities to address local and regional priorities\n\n“Effective planning is essential for the success of all communities in Southeast Michigan,” said Amy O’Leary, Executive Director of SEMCOG. “Previous investments in planning assistance have resulted in projects actually being completed, and it is exciting to see these grants spur successful implementation throughout our region,” said O’Leary.\n\nThe 14 FY2025 projects demonstrate a variety of areas in which local communities are planning investments:\n\nTransportation and Infrastructure Equity Planning\n\nVillage of Romeo: $40,000 for Asset Inventory and Capital Improvement Planning – Develop an asset inventory and CIP for the Village assets, in order for the village be able to continue to provide affordable, sustainable, reliable, efficient, and safe facilities to the residents.

Hackel. “The planning assistance grant will allow the Department of Roads to review Macomb County’s existing transportation and community assets and develop comprehensive, strategic and mindful approaches that will ensure transportation infrastructure is designed and operated to enable safe use and support of multiple modes of mobility,” Hackel said.\n\nScio Township: $40,000 for Jackson Corridor Complete Streets and Safety Implementation Plan – Conduct a corridor operational and safety study and complete streets strategic plan along the Jackson Road corridor.

The end result will be a plan to reduce traffic congestion, improve traffic flow, and in time make this area within our central business district more walkable and bikeable.\n\n“We are so grateful to be the recipients of such a generous grant,” said Patricia Odette, Mayor, City of Woodhaven.\n\nTrails and Greenway Planning\n\nCity of Monroe: $40,000 for Orchard East Greenway Trail Plan – Planning and schematic design for the development of the Orchard East Greenway Trail, which would include the removal of blighted, obsolete manufacturing and processing buildings, environmental remediation, installation of walking paths, paved trails, benches, public art and landscaping and would begin near First Street, just south of the River Raisin and would continue south towards Plum Creek.\n\n“As a Justice40 community, the City of Monroe continues to prioritize the economic and community development of the Orchard East Neighborhood and the River Raisin Heritage Corridor,” said Robert Clark, Mayor, City of Monroe. “Needed improvements will include the removal of blighted, obsolete manufacturing and processing buildings, environmental remediation, and a revitalization with the installation of community walking paths, paved trails, benches, public art and landscaping to an historic and culturally diverse neighborhood of Monroe,” said Clark.\n\nWaterford Township: $35,000 for Township Trail Connector Project Planning – Develop a plan for a multi-use pathway connecting several communities to major existing trail systems, Clinton River to, Polly Ann, to Iron Belle rails through Waterford Twp.\n\n“Many of Waterford’s residents have expressed interest in non-motorized recreation and improved walkability in the Township,” said Mark Monohon, Trustee, Waterford Township. “During our community outreach efforts while drafting the Township’s 2044 Master Plan, several themes emerged with a large emphasis on sidewalks being added to connect residential neighborhoods to commercial districts, as well as other large-scale recreation opportunities beyond the Township’s boundaries. Participants also noted a need to improve travel safety for pedestrians and bicyclists,” said Monohon. “The Planning Assistance Program grant award through SEMCOG will help expedite and improve the accuracy of the ultimate goal of providing safe, enjoyable walkability and economic benefits to Waterford’s and the surrounding communities’ diverse population,” Monohon said.\n\nEast China Township: $10,000 for River Park Route Planning along Bridge to Bay Regional Trail – Planning, design, and public engagement for the renovation of River Park and development of a trailhead with connections to the Bridge to Bay Trail. A trailhead will benefit multiple communities that are located along or connected to the trail.\n\nCity of Inkster: $40,000 for Inkster Greenway Trail, Phase III Planning – Planning and design for Segment 3 of the Lower Rouge Greenway.

With this Stormwater Management Plan, the City of Auburn Hills will be able to effectively manage and budget stormwater improvements well into the future.\n\n“Addressing stormwater challenges is a growing concern for the Auburn Hills community.” said Brian Marzolf, Mayor, City of Auburn Hills. “We look forward to utilizing these funds to generate a responsible and cost-effective stormwater management plan that prioritizes our needs and identifies necessary short and long-term improvements that we can accomplish,” said Marzolf.\n\nPlacemaking along Corridors and Active Transportation Planning\n\nCity of Eastpointe: $40,000 for Placemaking along Corridors Strategy – Develop an Economic Development + Placemaking Strategy for the city that will utilize extensive community engagement across various constituency groups and organizations, as well as chart a course for sustainability, equity, and prosperity. Eastpointe envisions a strategy that will beautify and catalyze investment and new development along and adjacent to major commercial corridors: Gratiot, Kelly, and Eight, Nine, and Ten Mile Roads.\n\n“I want to thank SEMCOG for selecting Eastpointe to receive a Planning Assistance Grant. The opportunity to create an Economic Development & Placemaking Strategy comes at the perfect time because it will complement the coming updates to our city’s Master Plan and our Joint Recreational Master Plan,” said Michael Klinefelt, Mayor, City of Eastpointe. “Eastpointe is a small town so grants like this really go a long way in a community like ours. We are excited to develop a plan that will help us seize every opportunity for economic growth and community development,” said Klinefelt.\n\nCity of Berkley – $10,000 for Dorthea Street Public Placa and Placemaking Strategy – Develop three conceptual plans showing different ways to activate the Dorthea Road street stub. These concepts will be shared with a committee composed of residents, business owners, elected and appointed officials, school district staff and, city and DDA staff for selection of a final concept.\n\n“We are very thankful for this funding opportunity as we work to implement the vision of our community laid out in Berkley’s Master Plan and Downtown Master Plan,” said Kristen Kapelanski, Community Development Director, City of Berkley. “Both plans encourage the development of more public gathering spaces in our downtown, with specific support for a pocket park or urban plaza. The SEMCOG planning grant will allow our staff to develop concepts for a vibrant community space in a dead-end street area that would otherwise remain underutilized,” said Kapelanski.\n\nProjects that received Planning Assistance funding awards were selected by SEMCOG’s Regional Review Committee, comprised of local elected officials in Southeast Michigan."
