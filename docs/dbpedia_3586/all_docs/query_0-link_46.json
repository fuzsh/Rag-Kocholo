        "meta_description": "1 review and 4 photos of CITY OF AUBURN HILLS \"The Crimson Tide keeps destroying Auburn, over and over and over again. They're in a lot of pain now. They're wounded. They're mourining their many losses. So I won't be going back there until the City of Auburb Heals. Get it. Auburn. Heals.\n\nBut this is nowhere near Alabama. A world away, you might say. And way colder.\n\nThis is a quaint little suburb in the far Northwestern corner of the Detroit area which is so far from downtown Detroit that I can't imagine how people living here can actually commute to the downtown area but they actually do. Quite a few of them in fact. But then if people in The Woodlands can commute to Houston, and if people in freaking Santa Barbara can commute to LA, I guess anything goes.\n\nIf you live out here you have to have a decent amount of money, and it's attractive to wealthy because it's far away from all the poor areas and the infamous crime of Detroit. There's not a huge amount of things that I come up here for except the little bubble tea shop that I like.\n\nMy other review said - Auburn Hills is a pretty remote little suburb with a decent bubble tea shop and some good Suburban fare, but definitely not one of the most exciting or busy of the many Northwestern Rochester suburbs. I do like coming up here though and it's nice to get away from the city for a while.\"",
