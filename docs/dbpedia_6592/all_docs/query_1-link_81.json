        "meta_description": "If it&apos;s true that the film isn&apos;t shown much in Germany, I can think of a couple of possible reasons.  It might inflame sentiment against the continued presence of American servicemen on German soil, and the Germans might feel that it shows them in a bad light.  Not only do people eventually turn on Christine Kaufman, but when the soldiers are first arrested, one German official politely suggests that the death penalty would be appropriate.  Germany no longer has a death penalty, and America still does, so the film might offend some Germans.  The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) had abolished the death penalty before the film was made, and here&apos;s a German asking an American military court to impose a penalty on Americans for rape that was too barbaric to be imposed on Germans -- even for murder.\r<br>\r<br>But this is a very good film.  It&apos;s a fascinating film for its time, because it looks at the crisis of youth versus the larger society in a more real way than American potboilers like &quot;A Summer Place&quot; were doing, and in a more journalistic way than, say, the James Dean films.  And it stands up for sex: Kaufman is entitled to be a sexual being, to desire her boyfriend, and even to tempt him.  In that way, it resembles the plays of William Inge.  Kaufman goes from victim to villain simply by virtue of Douglas&apos;s effort to paint her as a seducer.  But also, the desire to extract the last drop of blood from every one of the soldiers, from the least to the most repentant, forces Douglas to his expedient.\r<br>\r<br> --------------\r<br>***You must be old and wrinkled to have that type of reaction. - Liana***",

        "text": "Exactly, morgana-31.\n\nRemember that Major Garrett (Douglas) caught Karin and her boyfriend Frank in a couple of lies about that day: not mentioning that Karin wanted to have sex with Frank, that she had left him in a huff because he was a \"mama's boy\" who wouldn't make love to her, and that she had taken off her bikini before being raped. Although these were lies, they were hardly material to the issue of rape. Even Karin's initial claim that the men had torn off her bikini, when she was in fact already nude, was largely irrelevant. Is Garrett inferring that the men would have had no interest in assaulting her had they only seen her wearing a wet bikini instead of being naked? His claim that her desire to make love with her boyfriend was somehow tanatmount to her wanting any man (which he says in so many words) is really pretty disgusting. Again, it's the timeworn \"she was asking for it\" argument.\n\nGranted, Garrett is the defense attorney. He has a duty to his clients to defend them as strongly as possible. What's distressing is to realize that as recently as 1960 the tactics and arguments he used were acceptable. Even exposing the teens' essentially trivial lies is made into a major point, when they were of small if any relevance. But here they served to seriously discredit them, almost as if they had made up the entire rape.\n\nEven Colonel Pakenham (E.G. Marshall), who should have objected to much of Garrett's cross-examination, was largely silent on such key factors, as though he viewed the \"she asked for it\" defense as having at least some legitimacy. The townspeople, too, scorned Karin as a slut who had it coming (hence, \"Town Without Pity\"), indicating little outrage on the part of the community -- which is even more shocking, especially since the perpetrators were foreigners, with that added stigma attached.\n\nThings may be far from perfect today but a lot has changed for the better, both in court and in society's attitudes at large.\n\nreply share"
