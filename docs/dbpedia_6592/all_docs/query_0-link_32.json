        "text": "There was a time when it seemed like you could count on movies supplying some of the greatest music in any given year. It doesn’t seem that way anymore (with a few notable exceptions). That was the idea behind your aging blogger putting together a list of his fave songs that share the title of the movie they appear in since we just had the Academy Awards. This year’s Oscar winning song from Barbie didn’t move me but I think modern composers aren’t trying to appeal to ancient Caucasian males anyway. Maybe down the road a sequel will follow with movie songs that are titled differently than the movie. One caveat is that the song actually had to appear in the film which unfortunately disqualifies Gene Pitney’s great epic “(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance” which inexplicably didn’t make the cut for that movie. That song, by the way, was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David who appear in the far right photo in our intro. There are some painful omissions which again inspires me to ask for your comments of your personal faves.\n\n1.Theme from Murder At The Gallop – Ron Goodwin\n\nThe MGM 45 uses this title while the Capitol record calls it “Murder She Said” which is another one of these movies that I enjoyed back in the ’60s. Either way this is one of your blogger’s favorite pieces of music as it just makes me smile with its jaunty harpsichord/string olio stirring the senses. It was written and conducted by Brit Ron Goodwin for the four Miss Marple movies that starred Margaret Rutherford in the early ’60s. For my taste there was no better actress who ever played Agatha Christie’s eccentric dowager sleuth. Producer George Martin worked alongside Goodwin on a great many of his records. He scored several British films including Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines and Frenzy. His life spanned Feb. 17, 1925 to Jan. 8, 2003. He is in the middle picture in our intro.\n\n2.Skyfall – Adele\n\nThe James Bond movies have generally had notable theme songs and for my money this is by far the best which I know rocknrollbro-inlaw Matt agrees with me on (sorry, rocknrollsister Cheryl). While being the most modern song on our list, it is still respectful of the genre it represents. It is to Adele’s credit that it isn’t trendy or out of place as it feels of a piece with Monty Norman’s “James Bond Theme” from the first Bond film Dr. No – 1961. This is from the 2012 movie of that name and received the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Brit Adele Adkins remains one of the most popular singers in the world.\n\n3.The Big Country Main Theme – Jerome Moross\n\nHoly cow – when those epic strings fire out the intro to this song you have to get goosebumps. Composer Jerome Moross was nominated for an Academy Award for his score to this 1958 adult-themed Western. Burl Ives won the Oscar for best supporting actor while appearing with Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston. Moross said that he was inspired to write the main theme for the movie by recalling an earlier trek he took on land near Albuquerque, New Mexico. He passed in 1983, a week before his 70th birthday. Prog-rock fans of the band Yes will recognize this as being part of a song from their second record Time & A Word (1970) as mixed with the Richie Havens song “No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed”.\n\n4.Help! – The Beatles\n\nWell if you have read my other posts you had to figure The Beatles would appear eventually. This was from the second Beatles movie (1965) which was more slapstick than ’64’s A Hard Day’s Night (and frankly my favorite of all their films contrary to most reviewers). Mostly written by John Lennon (with some help from Paul McCartney), he claimed years later that he was crying for actual help at that time as he felt depressed. John said it was one of his most honest lyrics. By the way, this concert version shows how good they sounded live and endears John to me even more as once again he managed to forget his own lyrics which he often did.\n\n5.The Theme from “A Summer Place” – Percy Faith & His Orchestra\n\nThis was a sweeping #1 U.S. hit early in 1960 for the conductor from Toronto, Canada. Faith’s instrumental is a classic example of a record that took a while to find its audience. Columbia released the single in September of 1959. It took till January 1960 for it to hit the charts then it began a nine week run at the top near the end of February. The most successful vocal version was by The Lettermen who in 1965 hit #16 in the U.S. with their version. Lyrics were by Mack Discant and music was by Max Steiner who is often referred to as the father of film-music scoring. He won three Academy Awards plus scored such movies as Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and King Kong.\n\n6.Ghostbusters – Ray Parker, Jr.\n\nThis has to be one of the most recognized theme-songs of all-time. Heck, everybody knows the answer to who “you gonna call?” “Ghostbusters” of course (“I can’t hear you”). Parker had been the guiding force behind the hit group Raydio (“Jack and Jill”) till going solo in 1981. This song hit #1 in 1984 and generated controversy when Huey Lewis decided it sounded too much like his 1974 song “I Want A New Drug”. Lewis received compensation one assumes because Parker and/or his lawyers decided to end it, but to me the tune is different with only the riffs being akin. For years courts have ruled that riffs aren’t necessarily subject to copyright, so who you gonna blame? It is still a very catchy song from a fun movie no matter who wrote it.\n\n7.The Magnificent Seven – Al Caiola & His Orchestra\n\nGuitarist Caiola only had two chart hits: “Bonanza” from the TV show (#19 U.S. 1961) and this stirring theme at the tail end of 1960 (#35). He was mainly a studio guy and to have a rock hit was a relatively old 40 when he recorded this instrumental. He passed at age 96 in 2016 having recorded with artists as diverse as Elvis and Tony Bennett. Elmer Bernstein wrote the film score and, no, he wasn’t related to Leonard Bernstein the conductor. He scored a diverse group of movies including The Ten Commandments, True Grit and Animal House. The movie depicts seven men protecting a Mexican town and starred Yul Brenner and Steve McQueen among others. It was a Western remake of Akira Kurosawa’s classic 1954 Japanese film Seven Samurai. He is pictured far left in our intro.\n\n8.Jailhouse Rock – Elvis Presley\n\nElvis movies were generally just excuses to get the kids to the theater, sell more popcorn and soda, throw in some songs and then get those kids to buy the records. A few of his movies were actually pretty good, however with this 1957 film being one of the better ones. Keeping in mind that movie reviewers in the ’50s were never going to be in sync with teenagers or in love with rock and roll music, the reviews were pretty much negative. Presley played an ex-convict which didn’t sit well with those folk to begin with as they saw him as a bad influence on their kids. The movie was a huge success at the box-office. This song was written by legendary tunesmiths Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (“Kansas City”, “Youngblood”) who also added the songs “(You’re So Square) Baby I Don’t Care” (which Elvis is said to have played the bass on) and “Treat Me Nice” for the movie. Together or apart, Leiber and Stoller were responsible for at least 70 U.S. chart hits.\n\n9.Having A Wild Weekend – The Dave Clark Five\n\nWith the huge success of the first Beatles movie A Hard Day’s Night (1964), it was inevitable that other British Invasion groups would be cast in films as well to draw in the teen market. For a time The Dave Clark Five were seen as rivals of The Beatles and indeed they did chart 24 singles here from 1964 till 1968, but they were just a great rock and roll band and not trendsetters like the Fabs. One of the biggest problems with casting musical acts in movies is not every member was necessarily a great actor or even very interesting. That was the biggest strength of The Beatles – they were all four compelling and different individuals. The other problem with most teen movies was trying to find a plot. This movie didn’t get much of an audience as it wasn’t really a teen diversion, but more serious in tone. It marked the screen debut of British director John Boorman who went on to such successes as Deliverance and Excalibur. The soundtrack album on Epic was one of the first records in my collection as mom and dad let me get it from their Columbia Record Club order back in 1965 (thanks folks!). In the U.K. the title of the movie was Catch Us If You Can which was the hit single from the album (#4 U.S.).\n\n10.Let It Be – The Beatles\n\nI decided to restrict it to only two songs by one artist so Let It Be wins out over Magical Mystery Tour, A Hard Day’s Night and Yellow Submarine – but just barely. If “Help!” was mostly a John song, “Let It Be” was mostly Paul. The movie back in 1970 showed a band breaking up though they managed to pull together long enough to record the classic Abbey Road album. While this was recorded earlier than Abbey Road, it became their last album of new material in 1970 spawning this #1 single (plus “The Long & Winding Road” which also hit #1). The single version with production credited to George Martin downplayed the orchestra and used a mellow guitar lead break from George Harrison. The album version (included here) was produced by Phil Spector and for me was far superior punching things up and using a hot lead part from George. To me this is the birth of the power ballad. My late pal Chuck Davis and I used to crank this sucker up in his dorm room on Friday after class at the University Of Colorado while blasting out Chuck’s electric guitar likely to the annoyance of fellow students.\n\n11.The Monkey’s Uncle – Annette Funicello + The Beach Boys\n\nHere is yet another 1965 teen movie and it was a big success though the single didn’t chart. By 1965 Annette was several years removed from charting records which is a pity as this 45 is great. The song was written by Richard and Robert Sherman who had composed nifty tunes for movies such as Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book. The film starred Annette and Tommy Kirk. It was pretty silly beginning with Kirk’s character adopting a chimpanzee named Stanley.\n\n12.Exodus – Ferrante & Teicher\n\nThis stirring song is from the 1960 Paul Newman star vehicle about the founding of the State of Israel. Otto Preminger directed and the film reportedly earned over five times its production budget. Ernest Gold won the Academy Award for Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture while Art Ferrante and Lou Teicher nabbed the hit piano duet version getting to # 2 in the U.S. in 1961. Gold scored a great many films including Judgment at Nuremberg and On The Beach. Ferrante and Teicher made a career out of songs from movies it seemed, including “Tonight” and “Midnight Cowboy”. Teicher passed in 2008 (three weeks before his 84th birthday) and Ferrante succumbed in 2009 (two weeks after his 88th birthday).\n\n13.Xanadu – Olivia Newton-John + The Electric Light Orchestra\n\nJeff Lynne of The Electric Light Orchestra wrote this nifty pop confection for the horrid roller-disco film Xanadu in 1980. It got to #8 in the U.S. for the pairing of ELO backing Olivia Newton-John on lead vocal. One can only speculate how the great dancer Gene Kelly felt acting in this his last screen movie about a silly craze that didn’t have wheels – roller-disco. The much beloved ONJ sadly passed in the summer of 2022 of cancer at the age of 73.\n\n14.The Good, The Bad & The Ugly – Hugo Montenegro His Orchestra & Chorus\n\nClint Eastwood came to success on the big screen with the trio of so-called Spaghetti-Westerns directed by Sergio Leone. This Christmas 1966 film was the third of those Italian Western shows (it was released a year later in the U.S.). Music was by Ennio Morricone though the hit was by Hugo Montenegro who charted at #2 in 1968. Hugo was from New York City and started as a recording artist before he moved to scoring music for films including Lady In Cement and The Wrecking Crew. He passed in February of 1981 at the age of 55. As I commented in my June 2020 Arcane Instruments Of Rock blog post, the main riff was played on an ocarina. Feel free to click on that link (and all the others) at your leisure.\n\n15.That Thing You Do! – The Wonders\n\nIf your Dentist could talk to Tom Hanks it wouldn’t be about his wonderful film career, but rather about our apparent shared love of the music of the ’60s (gimme a shout Tom). This 1996 movie was his lovingly accurate representation of a one-hit-wonder band (hence The Wonders) from what for us Boomers was the golden age of music. The song was composed by Adam Schlesinger the bassist from The Fountains Of Wayne who passed from COVID-19 at the age of 52 in 2020. Lead vocals where by Mike Viola who has worked on other movies such as Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. As a fun homage to The Beatles, the song ends the same way that “I Saw Her Standing There” ends.\n\n16.What’s New Pussycat – Tom Jones\n\nWoody Allen’s debut on the big screen was this screwball comedy in 1965. He had previously been a comedic gag writer and stand-up comic. The song itself was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David (“Walk On By”, “Magic Moments”) and was a #3 hit for Welsh singer Tom Jones – his second U.S. success. Thomas Jones Woodward was born June 7, 1940 and first hit here with “It’s Not Unusual” before settling in to a long run in Las Vegas. It starred the two Peters (Sellers and O’Toole) and reviews were mixed with the title song getting the most acclaim. Allen wasn’t happy with how it turned out and from then on directed his own films.\n\n17.April Love – Pat Boone\n\nThe movie was a hit with the teen dating audience and depicted Boone as a parolee who had been convicted of joyriding in a stolen car. It had the usual boy meets girl on the farm plot twists. Pat successfully dished up sanitized Caucasian versions of Black rock and roll songs and was so clean it is a bit hard to see him as the law-breaker he played in the film (but that’s acting, right?). Reportedly Boone didn’t kiss the actress playing his love interest (Shirley Jones) so as not to cause discord with his wife also named Shirley. Sammy Fain composed the music while the lyrics were by Paul Francis Webster and it became a #1 U.S. hit for Boone in 1957.\n\n18.The Pink Panther Theme – Henry Mancini & His Orchestra\n\nThe first Pink Panther movie was released in 1963 and introduced bumbling French Inspector Jacques Clouseau played by Peter Sellers. Sellers’ character was only secondary in the first movie then became the focus of the next ten films. The animated title panther became popular enough that it spun off a kiddie cartoon as well. The theme was written by one of the most prolific and best-known composers of movie songs Henry Mancini (real name Enrico Mancini). His RCA Victor single peaked at #34 in 1964 with the sax played by Plas Johnson. Mancini is probably best known for songs like “Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet”, “Moon River” and “Love Story”. He started playing the piccolo at a young age then studied piano. Growing up near Pittsburgh, he first attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology then transferred to the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. In 1943 at the age of eighteen he enlisted in the Army and in ’45 was sent to France. When he was discharged he first joined the new version of The Glenn Miller Orchestra (Miller had died during WW II) then went to work in the movie industry. From then on he was involved with scoring countless movies and TV shows till his passing in 1994 at age 70.\n\n19.Town Without Pity – Gene Pitney\n\nYour Dentist loves the music of Gene Pitney, but he would like an explanation from the R&R Hall Of Fame how Gene got inducted (2002) while acts seemingly more deserving such as Neil Sedaka and Jethro Tull still wait for the call. At any rate, this was a #13 U.S. hit in 1961 from the shockingly tragic drama it accompanied. It is about a German teen who is gang-raped by U.S. servicemen and goes through a horrific trial only to drown herself at the movie’s end – yikes. Kirk Douglas and E. G. Marshall starred as the competing attorneys. The song was written by Dimitri Tiomkin with lyrics by Ned Washington – two composing heavyweights. Tiompkin lived from 1894 till 1979 and as he was Jewish, moved to Berlin then the U.S. following the Russian Revolution. He scored many films including High Noon and The Alamo. Washington passed in 1976 at the age of 76. One of the duo’s best remembered songs is the theme from the TV show Rawhide. Ned worked with others as well including Leigh Harline who wrote the song “When You Wish Upon a Star” for which they won and Oscar .\n\n20.Mrs. Brown You’ve Got A Lovely Daughter – Herman’s Hermits\n\nDisclaimer – your Dentist admits this to be a bit of a cheat as the hit song that lent its title to the movie came out three years before the film. Stop complaining – this in my blog after all and while the first Hermits movie Hold On! is better remembered, that song was not as good as “Mrs. Brown…”. The tune was a cover of a ’63 popular U.K ditty by Trevor Peacock and sung by Tom Courtenay in The Lads – a British TV play. Peter Noone’s band recorded the track as filler for an album only to see it become one of their biggest hits at #1 in ’65 when released in the U.S.. The other hit from the January 1968 movie was “There’s A Kind Of Hush”, their last top 10 U.S. single (1967). The plot of the movie is pretty dicey involving Peter/Herman getting a greyhound dog named Mrs. Brown plus falling for a girl named Judy Brown. No Academy Awards were awarded for the film (but the music was good). Herman’s Hermits were a charming pop band that in the wake of The Beatles 1964 invasion became far bigger stars in the U.S. than in their native England. The seemingly ageless Noone continues to put on a fun show at the time of this writing.\n\n21.Ferry Cross The Mersey – Gerry & The Pacemakers\n\nHailing from Liverpool with the same manager as The Beatles (Brian Epstein) and producer (George Martin), for a short time the music of Gerry Marsden’s band was hugely popular. In the wake of the success of the first Beatles movie A Hard Day’s Night, Gerry and company were given their own movie which was titled after the River Mersey that empties into Liverpool Bay. It came out in Dec. of 1964 in the U.K. and Feb. 1965 in the U.S. though The Pacemakers were certainly not the equal of The Beatles personality-wise. The title track proved to be the last big hit for the band in the U.S. at #6. Marden wrote the song which was great as was the other hit he wrote for the movie – “It’s Gonna Be Alright” (only a #23 hit here, but your blogger’s fave track by Gerry). Marsden ferried off our planet in 2021 at the age of 78. By the way, what passed as a plot had the band playing themselves pre-hits trying to win a music competition while losing (and ultimately finding) their musical instruments. It was not Citizen Kane.\n\n22.Ballad Of Easy Rider – The Byrds\n\nIn the summer of 1969 just before my senior year at Broomfield High, this seemed like a most excellently cool film to this teen with great period music and spiffy looking motorcycles. Well folks, in 2023 it seems stupid and mostly self-indulgent (feel free to quibble, but that’s my opinion in my 70s) but it did make a boatload of money on a ridiculously small budget. It feels like mostly an excuse for Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson to take drugs (allegedly), ride motorcycles and canoodle with hippy chicks (one of which was played by Toni Basil who in 1982 had a big hit with “Mickey”). The shocking ending where they have the run-in with the rednecks not-withstanding, it’s hard to remember much more than the image of Fonda as “Captain America” on his long-handlebar bike – an image that sold a ton of posters. Roger McGuinn of The Byrds reportedly received help from Bob Dylan on the title track. The version in the movie was simply McGuinn on acoustic guitar and Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The full band version was far superior appearing on The Byrds’ album of that same name though the single only hit #65 in the U.S. back in ’69.\n\n23.The Sound Of Music – Julie Andrews\n\nOh my would this have made my mom happy to see it on my list – rest in peace mom and dad. This 1965 soundtrack on the RCA Victor label seemed to be on nearly continuous rotation on the old KLH stereo in our West 7th Ave. Dr. Broomfield abode. For that reason it feels like comfort food for the ears and fills me with happiness/sadness remembering the good old days. Julie Andrews burst in to the big time with this movie and the earlier Mary Poppins. There could have been no better choice to play Maria it seemed in the highly fictionalized story of how she came to win the hearts of Captain Von Trapp and his children (not to mention escape the Nazis by walking some 200 miles over the Alps with unsuitable clothing, sensible shoes and a song on their lips). The movie is corny but very charming with instantly memorable music by the incomparable team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (lyrics). Rodgers originally had a successful partnership with Lorenz Hart but broke with him shortly before his 1943 passing due to alcoholism and depression. The new team had some great successes including Oklahoma, Carousel, South Pacific, etc. before Hammerstein passed in 1960 at the age of 65. Rodgers died in 1979 at the age of 77. The soundtrack sold over 20 million copies with the movie being one of the most successful of all-time. Note the cut after the sweeping opening shot as Andrews was getting so buffeted by the downdraft of the passing helicopter which held the camera that she could barely stand upright. Memo to sister Cheryl – hopefully this makes up for including Adele at #2.\n\n24.Georgy Girl – The Seekers\n\nBack in 1966 when your Dentist was in the thrall of rock bands like Paul Revere & The Raiders, The Dave Clark 5 and The Rolling Stones, music like this was WAY too poppy and non-rockin’. Now it sounds fun and cheerful to my older ears – go figure. The version of the song included here from the movie is very different lyrically than the #2 hit version by The Seekers but has the same whistleworthy tune. The music was composed by Tom Springfield (brother of singer Dusty Springfield) and the lyrics were from actor Jim Dale who had earlier worked as a singer with producer George Martin (who of course later worked with The Beatles). The British rom-com had an all-star cast of Lynn Redgrave in the lead role with support from Charlotte Rampling, Alan Bates, and James Mason. It did nearly 17 million at the box office on a budget of under half a million bucks.\n\n25.Born Free – Roger Williams\n\nAs with all these posts it becomes hard to leave out great songs to choose the final selection – in this case “Singin’ In The Rain”, “Steppin’ Out With My Baby” and “Where The Boys Are”. This 1966 movie was based on Joy Adamson’s non-fiction book about how she and her husband George had raised the orphaned lion cub Elsa to then release it back in to the wilds of Kenya. The Oscar-winning title track was written by John Barry with lyrics by Don Black(stone). This same team wrote the title music for several James Bond films including “Thunderball” and “Diamonds Are Forever”. Barry passed in 2011 at the age of 77. There are two hit versions of the song with pianist Roger Williams having the biggest take peaking at #7. Your Dentist assumed that the other chart version was by Andy Williams however that was not the case. In 1968 the R&B group The Hesitations took the song back in to the U.S. charts peaking at # 38 with a gospel-inflected version. Andy’s version was the title track to his 20th studio album (1967 on Columbia Records). To confuse things further, the movie version was by Brit singer Matt Monro with it becoming his signature song though it didn’t chart in the U.K. – go figure. Roger Williams who passed in 2011 a week after his 87th birthday had previously topped the U.S. charts in 1955 with “Autumn Leaves”."
