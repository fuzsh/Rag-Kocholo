        "text": "This second batch of three songs reaches back into the ’50s and ’60s, and revisits the work of the amazing John Barry, joined by two other great composers of the era, Dmitri Tiomkin and Victor Young. Film scores have been an inestimable part of my love affair with music, and though it all begins with a composer at a piano and a few sheets of paper, the film score grows through fanfare and refrain to reach into many parts of our lives, both real and imagined.\n\nYOU ONLY LIVE TWICE\n\nNANCY SINATRA\n\nI was a child of the 60s, and became a huge fan of the movies then. To this day there is a certain quality of 60s films that appeals to me, whether the slightly grainy quality or the color saturation. Similarly, there is a certain quality of 60s film scores that I cannot clearly define, but I know it when I hear it, like the voice of an old friend. James Bond of the movies grew up in the 60s along with me, and the James Bond theme songs, played to opening credits often with a psychedelic mixture of scantily clad women, guns, and various liquids to drip or plunge into, are seared into my memory. My favorite of the James Bond songs is You Only Live Twice, music by the amazing John Barry, lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, and gloriously sung by Nancy Sinatra.\n\nYou Only Live Twice is the 5th film featuring Sean Connery as British secret agent James Bond. The film takes place in Japan, and it is the 4th Bond film to be scored by John Barry. Barry makes no use of traditional Japanese tunes or instruments in his score, but Barry’s score nevertheless is one of the highlights of the film, and especially the title song. Several singers were possible choices to do the title number, including British singer Julie Rogers, who produced a more Asian­ sounding piece; Jazz singer Lorraine Chandler; Aretha Franklin, who was wanted by Barry; and Frank Sinatra, main choice of producer Cubby Broccoli. Sinatra suggested his daughter Nancy, who had just had a hit single with “These Boots Are Made for Walkin.” The song was recorded at the CTS Studios in Bayswater, London on 5/2/67. Dave Ehrlich of Rolling Stone deemed this the third best of the James Bond title songs, and it was another hit for Nancy. Several artists later did cover versions of the song, including Little Anthony and the Imperials, Coldplay, and Bjork.\n\n“You Only Live Twice” opens with climbing notes immediately joined by Barry’s famous strings in high octaves, reminiscent of Alexander Tcherepnin’s Piano Concerto No. 1, (Op. 12.) Nancy comes in with the opening line, accompanied by soft horns and a lulling tempo. It is a gentle melody, haunting, and immediately accessible. Nancy does well with the piece’s many held notes, making the song her own, though she later relates that during the recording she was very nervous, and it took some thirty takes to do, Barry ultimately using parts of two dozen of them for the final product. Regardless, Nancy’s voice matches the song wonderfully, and there are several elements to the performance that I adore, such as her note by note clear enunciation of the line “this dream is for you.” For me, it is easy to get lost in this song, again and again.\n\n“You Only Live Twice” — Lyrics\n\n“You Only Live Twice” — About the Film\n\nTOWN WITHOUT PITY\n\nGENE PITNEY\n\nI found Gene Pitney’s 1961 song “Town WIthout Pity” one day, after listening to his other iconic 60’s hit, “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.” The movie of the same name as the song is a harsh drama about rape and anger in a small town in post-World War 2 Germany. Before knowing any of this, the song to me evoked a certain feel, an epoch both real and imagined, the time between doo-wop and rock and roll, a time of West Side Story, Route 66 and the unsettling of the 50s. Even beyond the lyrics it still speaks to me of something cool and confident, sexy, sad and haunting, something not yet aware of the turbulence that drugs and protest and war and disillusionment would bring in the decade to come.\n\n“Town Without Pity” was written by composer Dmitri Tiomkin and lyricist Ned\n\nWashington. It was recorded by Gene Pitney for the 1961 movie. The song later went on to receive a Golden Globe for “Best Motion Picture Song.” It was nominated for an Academy Award. Pitney was the first pop singer to perform at the Oscars in 1962. Ned Washington had worked with Dimitri Tiomkin before on the oscar-winning song “High Noon” from the 1953 movie, and on the nominated “The High and the Mighty” from the 1955 film of the same name. “Town WIthout Pity” was recorded again many times, by such diverse artists as Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass in 1967, The Stray Cats in 1990, and Los Straitjackets in 2004.\n\n“Town Without Pity” starts with a drum intro, followed quickly by the full back-up of guitar, sax, and female singers, fading down scale to meet Pitney’s arriving voice. I’ve heard other versions of this song, and for my money Pitney nails it from the start, “When you’re young and so in love as we…” At first his gentle sultriness is accompanied only by the soft drum beat and base, and later piano, the sax, guitar and female voices again. He matches the sexy melancholy of the song, adding his own playful defiance, accenting the “bad” in “people talk about how bad we are.” There is an increase of Pitney’s power in the song as it near the ends, but it is subtly so. He never lets go of the core of the song, one that matches sadness with sexiness, pain with regret, passion with resignation. The song remains one of my top ten picks from the 60s.\n\n“Town Without Pity” — Lyrics\n\n“Town Without Pity” — About the Film\n\nCALL OF THE FARAWAY HILLS\n\nVICTOR YOUNG\n\nI can’t recall when I first saw the movie “Shane,” the story of a drifting gunslinger who comes to befriend a homesteading family in the Old West, battling against ruthless landowners and his own troubled conscience. Like Brandon DeWilde’s character in the film, a young boy who idolizes Shane as everything he wishes that his father was, I was awed by Shane’s prowess with a gun, his quiet demeanor thinly veiling the threat of death by lightning. I am not sure if the movie’s theme song had an impact upon me as a child in the way that Shane did, but since those early days it now effectively evokes the sweep of the film, and the heart of the lonely wanderer who gives all to defend for someone else what he himself will never have.\n\nThe movie Shane was nominated for Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Brandon deWilde), Supporting Actor (Jack Palance) Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay for the 1954 Academy Awards. It won for Best Cinematography. Victor Young’s score for Shane is memorable, but was never nominated for an Oscar. “The Call of the Faraway Hills” was used as the theme song for the 1966 television series “Shane”, starring David Carradine. There was a song released after the film with lyrics by Mack David. It was originally recorded by Ken Curtis, and followed by other versions, including Izumi Yukimura, Clint Bradley, and a wonderful rendition by Dolores Gray.\n\nThe Main Theme from Shane, Call of the Faraway hills, opens with a brief fanfare of horns, like the feeling of suddenly coming across a spreading vista of open hills and mountains. It settles down into a gentle prelude before revealing the lyrical majesty of Victor Young’s strings tugging at us with that haunting call of those distant hills. The gentle music of the prelude rolls along beside the beautiful main theme, like a rolling stream beside a lonely horseman who must answer that call. The strings refrain, and then comes the wistful notes of a waltz, the peaceful lure of a fire in the hearth, of family, of love, of working the land and seeing your kids grow up brave and strong. But that is only a vision. It cannot last. For a man who has lived his life by the gun is destined to die by it, no matter the redemption he has gained, and for Shane, the call is stronger than even those dreams of building a life in the new West. The faraway hills give their siren cry, and the horseman must ride on alone.\n\n“Call of the Faraway Hills” — Lyrics"
