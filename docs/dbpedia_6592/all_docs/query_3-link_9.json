        "text": "Few European countries saw as much political turmoil and change in the 20th century as Germany. One of the aftereffects of this is an extraordinary cultural output.\n\nOf course, keeping track of everything that's shaped and reshaped German history over the last century or so can be tricky business, which is why that cultural output is so important now.\n\nAnd if you're still confused over the differences between East Germany and West Germany, there are plenty of movies that'll help you get to grips with that, too.\n\nCan watching German movies help you learn the German language?\n\nYou can learn German by watching movies in German. For many people, it's the easiest way to pick up the language skills you need to have conversations with native speakers.\n\nPlus, you can learn about the various regional dialects and slang of natives through watching German-speaking films.\n\nLike Netflix for language learners, Lingopie has a stacked line-up of the best German movies and TV shows, all of which can be viewed with or without subtitles in any language.\n\nWe've picked out 20+ of our favorites, which are suitable for intermediate learners and above – or for beginners with the help of subtitles.\n\nThe Best German Movies To Learn German Language\n\nOttilie von Faber-Castell (2019)\n\nOne of the newer German films on our list, this made-for-TV biopic is about 16-year-old Ottilie, whose grandfather – the head of the famous Faber-Castell pencil company – must prepare her to take his place in the family business.\n\nSet around the turn of the 20th century, it's a sumptuous period drama that'll give you insight into German culture before the First World War.\n\nAnd the best part? It's available on Lingopie, so you can watch it and learn German stress-free.\n\nBarbara (2012)\n\nEast German nurse Barbara is transferred from her job at a prestigious Berlin hospital to a small coastal town after angering the Stasi.\n\nThe film follows her secret escape plans, as well as a slow-burning love story and some pivotal relationships with patients, shedding a poignant light on life in a divided Germany.\n\nParadies: Liebe (Paradise: Love) (2012)\n\n\"Paradies: Liebe\" is part of a trilogy focusing on three German women looking for the perfect life.\n\nIn this installment, a middle-aged Austrian woman travels to Kenya to participate in sex tourism, only to discover that she's being manipulated for her money by the young man.\n\nThis is a great movie to watch if you want to improve your understanding of natural dialogue in the German language because much of it is unscripted.\n\nInstead, the director set up scenarios and asked his actors to improvise, giving it a very true-to-life feel.\n\nDer Baader Meinhof Komplex (2008)\n\nThis German film hones in on the generation after World War II.\n\nSet in the 70s, amid the division of West and East Germany, it follows the radicalized offspring of those who lived through the war, and their fight to keep fascism at bay in this new regime.\n\nIn doing so, though, they unwittingly become the harbingers of terror themselves.\n\nThis thrilling German movie sheds light on West Germany's Red Army Faction, helping you hone your knowledge of Germany's complex modern political history while you learn your new language.\n\nDownfall (“Der Untergang”) (2004)\n\nSet in the final days of Hitler's life in Berlin's Führerbunker, this critically acclaimed drama was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards.\n\nIts controversial but fascinating portrayal of Adolf Hitler can make for uncomfortable viewing, as the film focuses its attention on the dictator as a complex, multilayered character.\n\nThis makes it a great film to watch with fellow language learners. It's also a great way to gain familiarity with the Austrian dialect, as actor Bruno Ganz studied it closely before filming this Second World War drama.\n\nHead-on (2004)\n\nThis unconventional love story centers around Sibel, the daughter of a Turkish family in Hamburg, who meets 40-something addict Cahit in hospital after both attempt to take their own lives.\n\nThey embark on a marriage plot to try to improve their lot in life, with unexpected results.\n\nGoodbye Lenin (2003)\n\nGerman superstar Daniel Brühl made his major breakthrough in this tragicomedy, which takes place as the Berlin Wall falls.\n\nAs the film begins, committed socialist Christiane Kerner suffers a heart attack and slips into a coma after spotting her son, Alex, taking part in a protest against the celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary.\n\nWhile she's unconscious, the wall falls – but after she awakens, Alex is warned by her doctors that any sudden shock could kill her.\n\nSo, he embarks on an elaborate ruse to recreate a facsimile of the German Democratic Republic and hide the truth from his mother.\n\nThe Lives Of Others “Das Leben der Anderen” (2006)\n\nSet in a divided Germany, Das Leben der Anderen is a historical drama that sheds some light on what life in East Berlin was like.\n\nPlaywright Georg Dreyman, a secret Communist, attempts to publish anonymous articles, leading him to become a target of the Stasi, East Berlin's secret police.\n\nThis seminal watch marked the feature film debut of Florian Henchel von Dommersmarck.\n\nThe Edukators (2004)\n\nThis cult classic has a particularly DIY feel to it because it was filmed with a limited budget and on handheld cameras.\n\nIt centers around three anti-capitalist activists in Berlin who decide to educate the wealthiest residents of the city by breaking into their houses, rearranging their furniture, and leaving cryptic notes warning of the coming of a new age.\n\nIt's a fascinating insight into how a century of political turmoil influenced a new generation of revolutionary spirits.\n\nDas Experiment (2001)\n\nInspired by the true story of the Stanford prison experiment in the 70s, this chilling film is about a social experiment in which civilians are put into a prison simulation. Half play prisoners, while the other half become guards.\n\nAlthough they're sent into the simulation with the order to follow seemingly mild rules, before long, all shreds of human decency are discarded as the experiment descends into physical violence.\n\nNirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa) (2001)\n\nBased on an autobiographical novel, this movie offers an alternative viewpoint of the Jewish experience during World War II.\n\nIt follows the Redlichs, a Jewish family who escape from Germany in 1938 and emigrate to Kenya to start a new life on a farm.\n\nIt features three languages – German, Swahili, and a bit of English – and offers the rare chance to see the refugee experience from a different angle.\n\nLola Rennt (Run Lola Run) (1998)\n\nA sort of Sliding Doors-style thriller, Lola Rennt follows three alternate timelines, all starting from the moment she receives a phone call from her boyfriend, who has lost 100,000 German marks on the subway and now needs to replace the cash in 20 minutes or risk being killed by his criminal boss.\n\nIn each scenario, a small change completely alters how the storyline unfolds.\n\nDie Welle (The Wave) (2008)\n\nAnarchist schoolteacher Rainer Wenger sets up an experiment to prove to his disbelieving students how easily a dictatorship can take root, even in the modern-day.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, what follows is a terrifying descent into pseudo-fascism that'll leave you ruminating on its finer points for days afterwards.\n\nOstwind – Zusammen Sind Wir Frei (Eastwind – Together We Are Free) (2013)\n\nEvery country has horse girls, and so every country needs horse girl movies.\n\nYou know the drill: a teenage girl is sent to live at a riding stable, where she discovers a previously untapped talent as a rider.\n\nThis is a family-friendly choice with an easy-to-follow plot and dialogue.\n\nDas Boot (The Boat) (1981)\n\nOne of the all-time cinema classics, Das Boot takes place on board the German submarine U-96 during the Second World War's Battle of the Atlantic.\n\nThe final scenes are some of the most memorable – and claustrophobia-inducing – in movie history.\n\nIt offers the chance to learn military-related phrases through its numerous World War II references.\n\nThe Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (“Die Bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant”) (1972)\n\nThis classic film is a great introduction to German cinema and is set up almost like the stage play it originated from.\n\nSet over four acts and almost exclusively in the titular Petra von Kant's bedroom, the all-female film follows a fashion designer in Bremen and her destructive relationships with the women around her – and the bitter tears that follow.\n\nIt cemented director Rainer Fassbinder as one of the great auteurs of New German Cinema.\n\nAguirre, the wrath of God (Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes) (1972)\n\nAnother German classic, this '70s arthouse piece focuses its attention on a group of conquistadores as they head down the Amazon river in search of El Dorado.\n\nWith its simple plot and sparse dialogue, it's an easy movie to follow if your German comprehension skills still need some fine-tuning.\n\nDie Vorstadtkrokodile (The Crocodiles) (1977)\n\nThough it's been remade multiple times, the original 1977 version is the best of this franchise, which is about a group of teenagers who witness a burglary and decide to apprehend the criminals responsible.\n\nIt's a family-friendly option, perfect if you're watching movies with kids.\n\nThe Best German Series To Learn German Language\n\nUnorthodox (2020)\n\nThis four-part miniseries made waves when it debuted in 2020, and for good reason. It follows Esty, a 19-year-old woman in an ultra-Orthodox community in New York City, as she escapes her home for a new life in Berlin.\n\nThough much of the series is in Yiddish, the Berlin scenes make great use of German dialogue. And, the compelling plot will have you binging the whole series in one sitting.\n\nCriminal: Germany (2019)\n\nWant a German thriller series to binge-watch? The procedural drama series Criminal will tick all your boxes.\n\nSet in a police interrogation room, it's full of psychological trickery and clever use of language, so it's perfect if you want to take your grasp of spoken language to the next level.\n\nThis series is most appropriate for intermediate or advanced German learners.\n\nBabylon Berlin (2017)\n\nIf you're trying to learn German, the TV show \"Babylon Berlin\" is an excellent choice. The show has some great features that can really help you improve your German language skills.\n\nThe thing that makes it so good is the way the show really pulls you into the story. The writing is so rich and detailed, you feel like you're right there in the world of 1920s Berlin along with the characters. And speaking of the characters, they come from all different backgrounds, so you get exposed to all kinds of German vocabulary and dialects.

So you're learning the way real people actually talk. And the show is just so compelling - the plot is really gripping and the production value is top-notch.\n\n4 Blocks (2017)\n\nThe TV show \"4 Blocks\" is an excellent resource for learning German slang and informal speech. The dialogue features realistic, conversational language that reflects the diverse backgrounds of characters in modern-day Berlin. This exposes viewers to a wide range of accents, colloquialisms, and idiomatic expressions used in everyday German.\n\nThe compelling storylines and strong performances, particularly by actor Kida Khodr Ramadan, keep viewers engaged. So generally, watching this series makes the process of picking up new slang and conversational skills enjoyable and effective.\n\nHow To Sell Drugs Online Fast (2019)\n\nHow to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)\" is a great show for learning contemporary German slang and casual language. The dialogue uses fast-paced, realistic teenage speak, exposing viewers to the way Germans actually talk in everyday life.\n\nThe engaging, funny storyline keeps you interested, so you're picking up new slang and conversational skills without it feeling like work. Overall, the show provides German learners with a fun and effective way to develop a better understanding of modern, casual German usage.\n\nKleo (2022)\n\n\"Kleo\" is an excellent choice for learning German, as it provides learners with exposure to a rich and diverse range of vocabulary and language usage.\n\nThe series' dynamic and engaging storyline, which blends action, comedy, and intrigue, requires characters to employ a variety of speech patterns and expressions. From intense confrontations to lighter, humorous exchanges, the dialogue in \"Kleo\" showcases the versatility of the German language.\n\nAdditionally, the show's historical and contemporary references create opportunities for learners to expand their knowledge of German cultural context and idiomatic usages. The narrative's shifting between East and West Germany also introduces viewers to regional linguistic variations.\n\nDie Discounter (2021)\n\n\"Die Discounter\" is a fantastic resource for learning German. The show's use of colloquial language and contemporary references provides learners with exposure to authentic, everyday spoken German.\n\nThe dialogue is filled with common expressions and slang, giving you a real-world understanding of how the language is used in casual conversations.
