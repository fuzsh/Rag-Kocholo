        "text": "Deutsches Kino - Germany\n\nBy Lesley Stevenson\n\nLed by Dusseldorf’s Der Kinematograph (1907–1935) and Berlin’s Die Lichtbildbühne, German trade papers of the early 1900s chronicled the art form’s growth and its eventual emergence as an industry through the late Wilhelmine and Weimar periods. Much like the films they explored and critiqued, German-language trade publications showcased an impressive range of aesthetic choices, from dramatic photographs and illustrations to striking typefaces typical of German Expressionism, a genre that took shape through the 1920s. These film magazines played an important role not only in documenting German cinema’s particular history and values but also in legitimizing film in the country as a medium worthy of the same respect as live theatre.\n\nOther trade papers shortly following the successful debut of Kinematograph—notably, Erste Internationale Filme-Zeitung in addition to Lichtbildbühne. Early trade papers and magazines focused on bridging communication gaps between different parts of the growing trade. Beginning in 1909, critic Paul Lenz-Levy published some of the first German film criticism in Die Lichtbildhühne, though his opinions centered more on exhibition and technology than artistic choices. Publications of the 1910s and 20s instead debated the cultural merits of cinema and sought to theorize standards of evaluation that would elevate the rudimentary practice to a genuine art form. By this time, film critics were borrowing elements from drama, philosophy, and literature to critique the films themselves rather than the exhibition or viewing experience, according to Sabine Hake and Helmut H. Diederichs. Several titles in this collection also reflect the rise of Universum Film-Aktien Gesellschaft (UFA), Germany’s dominant production company, including catalogs for documentaries (Kulturfilme UFA) and season offerings (UFA Verleih-Programme 1924-25, UFA Katalog der Saison 1929/30).\n\nBesides emerging as Germany’s earliest film trade magazines, Der Kinematograph and Die Lichtbildbühne also share a dark history: the rise of the Nazi Party led to the ousting of their chief editors and, in the case of the former, his murder. The Nazis forced Alfred Rosenthal and Karl Wolffsohn, both Jewish, to give up their top positions as the film industry consolidated under the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Wolffsohn fled the country and returned following World War II, but Rosenthal was captured, held in the Theresienstadt ghetto, and ultimately murdered in 1942.\n\nThank you to Michael Cowan, the Department of Film Studies at the University of St Andrews, and Mikrofilmarchiv der deutschsprachigen Presse for their collaboration in making these scans available. The Media History Digital Library proudly dedicates this collection to the memory of Alfred Rosenthal."
