        "text": "Are you tired of missing out on your favorite Netflix shows and movies when traveling abroad? It can be frustrating to discover that the content you love is restricted based on your current location. The good news is that you can change your Netflix region and regain access to a wider variety of content, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen you travel from one country to another, you may notice a significant difference in the available Netflix catalog. Certain regions have a limited selection of shows and movies, which can be disappointing for avid streamers. For example, if you’re from the US and find yourself in Spain, you’ll quickly realize that the content options are much more limited. Fortunately, by changing your Netflix region, you can bypass these restrictions and access your home library.\n\nFrom experience, we have found that the easiest and most effective way to change your Netflix region is by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN routes your internet traffic through a server in your chosen country. By doing so, it masks your actual IP address and replaces it with one from your selected country. This effectively tricks Netflix into thinking you’re streaming from that location. This means that you can easily access your home library even when you’re away from home.\n\nStay tuned as we walk you through the step-by-step process of changing your Netflix region using a VPN, ensuring you can enjoy your favorite content anytime, anywhere. Let’s get started!\n\nHow to change Netflix region with a VPN\n\nSign into a Netflix account or sign up for one.\n\nDownload and install a VPN that works for changing Netflix regions. We recommend NordVPN – the most reliable VPN for accessing other Netflix regions after vigorous testing.\n\nConnect to a VPN server in the country you want to change to. For example, for Netflix US, you will need a VPN with servers in the United States.\n\nGo to the Netflix website and you should see the country site for the location of your selected server.\n\nSelect a movie or TV show from that countries Netflix library and enjoy!\n\nNote: If you encounter any issues, you should try clearing your cookies and cache. If problems persist, you will need to reach out to customer support for technical help.\n\nCan I watch Netflix in other countries?\n\nYes, this method will allow you to watch Netflix anywhere abroad and is popular with people who travel frequently. For example, Americans visiting the UK will be able to securely stream American Netflix, and British travelers in the US can watch Netflix UK.\n\nHere’s our summary of the best VPNs to change location on Netflix:\n\nNordVPN: The most reliable VPN for switching Netflix countries. #1 in our Netflix tests for 6 years running. Very high speeds, strong security, and a 30-day money-back guarantee. TIP In our testing we found that the cheapest NordVPN plan (Standard) works perfectly for changing Netflix region.\n\nSurfshark: Our favorite service for changing Netflix regions and accessing geo-restricted content on a budget. Strong on security, with steady speeds and unlimited connections.\n\nIPVanish: A no-logs provider capable of accessing multiple Netflix libraries from abroad. Fast enough for 4K streaming, with powerful security tools, and no connection limit.\n\nExpressVPN: A premium VPN service. Works well with Netflix and a host of other streaming services. Fast connection speeds and a strong security offering.\n\nCyberGhost: Thousands of international servers to access any Netflix region on almost any device. Provides access to content on hundreds of Netflix libraries.\n\nPrivateVPN: Great up-and-coming VPN which works well with Netflix and beats geographical restrictions other streaming services.\n\nPrivate Internet Access: Quick and great for Netflix UK, US, and more. Has plenty of advanced security features.\n\nPureVPN: Great for streaming Netflix thanks to fast speeds and unblocking ability. Budget-friendly with plenty of security features.\n\nProtonVPN: A secure VPN with 256-bit encryption, a no-logs policy and a choice of protocols. Works reliably with Netflix.\n\nBear in mind that Netflix is aware that subscribers are using this tactic to access different libraries and is cracking down. When it discovers that a particular IP address belongs to a VPN provider, it will block traffic from that address. In this case, you’ll see a proxy error stating:\n\n“Whoops, something went wrong. Streaming error. You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy. Please turn off any of these services and try again.”\n\nMany providers are committed to providing a workaround and maintaining servers that offer reliable VPN access to various Netflix libraries. Even so, not all of these providers offer a comparable service. For streaming, you need to ensure your VPN is fast and reliable. And you also want to know that your chosen provider values security and privacy to the utmost degree.\n\nCriteria for the best VPNs for changing Netflix location\n\nWith the above in mind, we’ve put together a list of the best VPNs for watching any country’s version of Netflix based on the following criteria:\n\nWorks well with the most popular Netflix country catalogs like Netflix US, UK, Canada, Japan, and Australia (bonus points for working with other catalogs)\n\nHas a large selection of server locations worldwide\n\nProvides fast and reliable connections for HD streaming without interruption\n\nUses strong encryption backed by additional security features\n\nKeep no logs of user activity or IP addresses, with no exceptions\n\nOffers knowledgeable and accessible customer support (preferably live chat)\n\nSupports simultaneous device connections so you can watch on any streaming device\n\nEach VPN in this article has been subject to first-hand, thorough testing and analysis. We discuss how we analyze and rank VPNs in more detail later in this article.\n\nBest VPNs for changing Netflix region – Our hands-on review\n\nWe’ve compared the most important features for the top VPNs here. Prefer to read the in-depth reviews? Start with NordVPN – our #1 choice for changing Netflix region.\n\nThe best VPNs to change region on Netflix\n\nHere’s a list of the best VPNs for changing your Netflix region in 2024:\n\n1. NordVPN\n\nAug 2024 works with NetflixTested Aug 2024\n\nNordVPN is the best VPN for changing Netflix regions and one of the best VPNs for streaming on the market (see how NordVPN compares to ExpressVPN on streaming). It offers a huge network of streaming servers, comprising over 5,000 in over 60 countries. It is known for its ability to securely access Netflix and works with a host of libraries, including the US, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Spain, UK, Australia, Brazil, Italy, India, and Germany. What’s more, this service is among the fastest we’ve tested, meaning it’s well-suited for high-resolution streaming.\n\nThis VPN can also provide secure access to many other popular streaming sites, such as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, and BBC iPlayer. Some of NordVPN’s servers are even optimized specifically for video streaming. If you have any issues, you can ping customer support.\n\nNordVPN is another strong player in terms of privacy protection and security. It keeps no logs whatsoever, not even bandwidth data caps. Security is in the form of 256-bit banking-grade encryption with perfect forward secrecy. DNS leak protection and a customizable kill switch help ensure your data never leaves the encrypted tunnel. One more unique security feature is that certain dedicated servers are optimized to protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nYou can install NordVPN on up to six devices simultaneously. It has desktop clients for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, as well as apps for iOS and Android.\n\nNordVPN speed test data\n\nBEST FOR NETFLIX:NordVPN is our first choice since it’s versatile and works with so many different Netflix libraries from abroad. Strong online privacy and security credentials. Try it risk-free thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full review of NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN Coupon\n\nUp to 73% off + 3 months Free\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n2. Surfshark\n\nworks with NetflixTested Aug 2024\n\nSurfshark works with US Netflix and a host of other libraries, including Netflix UK, Japan, Netherlands, India, and France. If you try to access an unsupported library securely, Surfshark will redirect you to the US Netflix library. That means every server works with Netflix regardless of where you connect. Best of all, Surfshark is the sole provider on this list to allow unlimited simultaneous connections. It’s a great option for a family or group of housemates.\n\nIf your streaming device doesn’t support VPN apps, such as a game console or Apple TV, Surfshark has you covered. Like ExpressVPN, every Surfshark subscription comes with a standalone smart DNS service. Setting this up allows you to watch US Netflix on devices that allow you to modify DNS settings. Note that the smart DNS proxy is not as secure as the normal VPN, which uses strong encryption and automatic kill switch protection to prevent data leaks. If you encounter any problems, consult with 24/7 live chat support. Surfshark keeps no logs and allows torrenting.\n\nSoftware is available for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux.\n\nSurfshark speed test data\n\nBEST BUDGET PICK:Surfshark is a great low-cost option for watching Netflix abroad. Comes with strong security, speedy connections, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full Surfshark review.\n\nSurfshark Coupon\n\nSave 86% on a 2 year Starter plan + 3 months free\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n3. IPVanish\n\nworks with netflixTested Aug 2024\n\nIPVanish has significantly improved its streaming abilities of late. Platforms that troubled it before, such as Netflix, no longer pose any issues. In fact, we’ve had great results accessing several popular catalogs, including Netflix UK and the US. Better still, this provider offers average speeds of more than 300 Mbps and can secure every device you own simultaneously. As if that wasn’t enough, it provides 24/7 assistance over live chat and is one of the most novice-friendly services on the market\n\nThere’s a lot to like from a security perspective as well. To begin with, this VPN keeps you safe using uncrackable encryption, a kill switch, and automatic leak protection. Just recently, it introduced split tunneling functionality and the ability to block ads and trackers. Additionally, it’s possible to scramble OpenVPN traffic, hiding the telltale signs of VPN usage (which is particularly helpful when you’re dealing with stubborn streaming services like Netflix). This provider follows a strict no-logging policy, something that has been verified by external auditors.\n\nIPVanish has apps for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Amazon Fire TV. It also provides manual installation instructions for several types of router firmware.\n\nIPVanish speed test data\n\nQUICK AND CAPABLE:IPVanish makes it as easy as possible to stream your favorite Netflix shows while traveling. Boasts blazing-fast speeds, a strong security toolkit, and a 30-day money-back guarantee on annual and two-year plans.\n\nWhy not read over our full IPVanish review?\n\nIPVanish Coupon\n\nSAVE 83% on the 2 yr plan\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\n4. ExpressVPN\n\nworks with NetflixTested Aug 2024\n\nExpressVPN is an extremely reputable provider based in the British Virgin Islands. Its more-than-ample network of over 3,000 servers in 94 countries gives you access to a huge choice of Netflix libraries. Indeed, ExpressVPN reliably works with Netflix versions in the US, UK, Japan, Canada, and France, among others. If a chosen server doesn’t work, you can contact a live customer support agent to determine which is the optimal server to connect to.\n\nBesides Netflix, ExpressVPN can grant you secure access to many other streaming services, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and HBO Max. All servers are optimized for speed, and this, coupled with a reliable service, means you can stream shows and movies seamlessly.\n\nAs we mentioned, privacy and security are top concerns to prevent ISPs, government agencies, or hackers from snooping on your online activity or viewing your personal information. ExpressVPN delivers on this front with 256-bit AES encryption (considered military-grade) and perfect forward secrecy. These features are further supported by an automatic kill switch — which drops the internet connection if the VPN connection is lost — and DNS leak protection. ExpressVPN doesn’t monitor user activity and won’t record your IP address.\n\nSoftware is available on Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and certain wifi routers.\n\nExpressVPN speed test data\n\nGREAT FOR STREAMING:ExpressVPN is a speedy, security-conscious provider that reliably works with Netflix from any location.

PureVPN\n\nWorks with NetflixTested Aug 2024\n\nPureVPN is an excellent VPN choice for home internet users primarily preoccupied with accessing streaming services. In our recent tests, it performed flawlessly to access a wide choice of international streaming services in the US, the UK, Europe, and elsewhere. In terms of Netflix, we were able to access the large US catalog and regional catalogs in Canada, the UK, Japan, and Germany.\n\nThe VPN is fast thanks to its WireGuard implementation, providing average global download speeds of around 400 Mbps across the server we tested. This is impressive considering that PureVPN is one of the cheapest premium VPNs available.\n\nIn terms of security, the VPN has strong AES encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak protection, and a solid no-logging policy. This makes it a secure option for bypassing blocks to watch Netflix at work, preventing ISP tracking, and keeping you safe against hackers on public Wi-Fi. The biggest disappointment was the VPN’s live chat support, which, although 24/7, was a bit slow to respond.\n\nAll things considered, however, this VPN is a highly impressive all-rounder that you can compare to any other VPN risk-free using its 31-day money-back guarantee.

But we’d have to advise you to steer clear for several reasons. Providing full access to Netflix requires a lot of effort on the part of a provider, and free services aren’t profitable enough to justify the use of these resources on an ongoing basis. A free VPN might let you explore another country’s Netflix catalog, but when it comes time to watch, you’ll almost certainly encounter the proxy error.\n\nWhat’s more, these services typically provide users with a limited selection of servers, which means you’re less likely to be able to access the Netflix library you’re looking for. Even if you do get access, you’ll probably be frustrated with slow connection speeds and even having to wait in a queue for some servers. You may also find free VPNs don’t offer unlimited bandwidth, making it difficult to stream HD content. This type of monthly data cap isn’t an issue when using any of the premium VPNs recommended above.\n\nPracticality isn’t the only issue with free services. We’ve put a heavy emphasis on privacy and security above because it’s important for users to know what’s happening with their data. The providers of free VPN services need to make money somehow and often do so through questionable methods. Some interrupt your experience with annoying ads, log your activity and sell data to third parties, or even carry malware.\n\nWhich country versions of Netflix are available?\n\nNetflix started out slowly and solely operated in the US for its first decade or so. It finally expanded internationally with Canadian Netflix in 2010, and then there was no stopping. After a massive 2016 expansion, Netflix is now available in most countries, except China, Crimea, Syria, Russia, and North Korea. When it comes to China, not wanting to miss out on this massive market, Netflix has pushed for licensing deals instead of having an actual presence in the country.\n\nAlthough Netflix is available in most countries, the catalog of shows and movies varies greatly depending on your region. Aside from having different titles available, some regions have a very small selection. This is due to the different licensing agreements in each region. Here are the top twelve international Netflix libraries in terms of the number of shows and movies available (source: JustWatch.com).\n\nOur own Netflix library study showed a big difference in cost and available titles depending on where you live. There is a map on Netflix’s website that shows where the service is currently available.\n\nRelated: Best VPNs for accessing Netflix US, Netflix UK, Netflix Japan, Netflix Spain, Netflix Brazil, Netflix France, Netflix Italy.\n\nHow to access US Netflix\n\nUsing a VPN to access US Netflix on vacation is easy no matter where you go in the world. The only caveat is that you must pick a VPN that works, and in 2024 there are very few left that can access Netflix reliably.\n\nIn this guide, we have done the hard work by recommending the world’s best VPNs for streaming Netflix abroad. To make things even easier, we have included a short setup guide below.\n\nHere’s how to access US Netflix while traveling abroad:\n\nPick a VPN that works for changing Netflix regions. We recommend NordVPN because it represents superb value, outstanding security, and fantastic speeds for streaming US Netflix and many other services.\n\nSubscribe to the VPN. Thanks to our automated coupon, you can use our link to get the VPN at the best possible cost.\n\nDownload the VPN software. Our recommendations have apps for all platforms that are easy to install and use on any of your devices.\n\nInstall the VPN and log in using your credentials.\n\nPick a VPN server in the US and click to connect. If your VPN has servers labeled for US streaming, select one of these.\n\nAs soon as the VPN connection is established, your real location is concealed, and you appear to have a valid IP address in the US. That means you can launch your Netflix app or log in via the website to watch US-only shows and movies.\n\nHow to change Netflix region on iPhone\n\nTo access different Netflix libraries on your phone, you’ll need to use a VPN to spoof your location. Don’t worry, it’s not as complex as it sounds.\n\nHere’s how to change Netflix region on iPhone:\n\nSubscribe to a reputable VPN provider with an easy-to-use mobile app. We recommend NordVPN.\n\nOn your iPhone, go to the App Store and download and install your VPN app.\n\nLog into the app using your VPN provider credentials.\n\nConnect to a server location that corresponds to the Netflix library you want to watch. For example, use a US server to access Netflix US.\n\nNow open your Netflix app, and you should have access to the library you want.\n\nNote that even if a VPN works with the country you want, you might find that not all servers in that location will work. If you run into issues, contact your VPN’s customer support team for help with troubleshooting.\n\nHow to change Netflix region on an Android phone\n\nAccessing a different country’s Netflix library on your Android phone is possible if you use a VPN, which is quite simple to set up.\n\nHere’s how to change Netflix region on an Android phone:\n\nSign up with your chosen VPN provider (choose one with a good Android app like NordVPN).\n\nOn your Android phone, go to the Google Play Store and download the app for your VPN.\n\nOnce installed, log into the app with your new VPN credentials.\n\nSelect a server in the correct location for the Netflix library you want to watch. For example, to access Netflix UK, connect to a UK server.\n\nNow, launch your Netflix app, and you should be able to watch content from your desired library.\n\nAlthough many VPNs work with Netflix, not all work with every library, and even for the libraries they do work with, not every server will work. Netflix regularly adds new blocks, and VPN providers introduce workarounds in a cat-and-mouse game. As such, you may need to contact your VPN’s customer support team for assistance, as they can provide specific instructions.\n\nHow to change Netflix region on PS4\n\nPS4 does not support native VPN apps, but there are still a couple of ways you can change Netflix region on your PS4. One is to use a VPN router, which will provide VPN coverage for every device that’s connected to that router. Another method involves connecting your gaming console to a VPN-connected computer via an ethernet cable, but this is fairly cumbersome.\n\nIf you’re looking for the simplest way to change Netflix region on your PS4, ExpressVPN’s MediaStreamer may be your best bet. This comes free with every ExpressVPN subscription, which is worth considering when choosing the most suitable VPN for your needs. The one issue with MediaStreamer is that it’s a DNS service versus a VPN. This means it doesn’t encrypt data so won’t protect your connection.\n\nIf you wish to try MediaStreamer, here are the steps:\n\nSign up for an ExpressVPN account and submit payment.\n\nSign in to the ExpressVPN website and go to the ExpressVPN DNS settings page.\n\nGo to IP address registration, select Register my IP address, and toggle Automatically register my IP address to the on position.\n\nHead to the ExpressVPN setup page and locate your MediaStreamer DNS server IP address.\n\nOn your PS4, go to Settings > Network > Set Up Internet Connection.\n\nUnder How do you want to connect to the network?, choose Use Wi-Fi or Use a LAN cable. If prompted to use your existing wifi settings, select Yes.\n\nUnder How do you want to set up the Internet connection?, choose Custom.\n\nSelect your wifi connection and enter your password.\n\nChoose the following settings: IP Address Settings – Automatic; DHCP Host Name – Do Not Specify; DNS Settings – Manual. Then select Primary DNS.\n\nEnter your MediaStreamer DNS server IP address (found in step 4) and click Done then Next.\n\nFinally, select the following settings: MTU Settings – Automatic; Proxy Server – Do Not Use; Internet settings updated – Test Internet Connection.\n\nNote you will have to restart your PS4 for these changes to take effect.\n\nHow to change Netflix region on Roku\n\nRoku is another system that does not support native VPN apps, but if you’re willing to make some effort, you can change the Netflix region on Roku.\n\nHere’s how to change Netflix country on Roku:\n\nSet up a VPN router and connect your Roku to it.\n\nCreate a VPN-protected Wi-Fi hotspot on your laptop computer and connect your Roku to it.\n\nScreencast to the Roku using a VPN-protected Android smartphone or tablet.\n\nWe go into more detail about these options in our Best VPNs for Roku post.\n\nFinding the best VPNs for changing Netflix region: our methodology\n\nTraveling abroad can be frustrating and finding you can no longer access your usual Netflix library from home. Unfortunately, few VPNs work well with Netflix, but the good news is that we’ve found those that do! Below, we’ll go over our methodology for finding the best VPNs for changing your Netflix region:\n\nNetflix-compatible servers: With so many VPNs unable to help you access Netflix from abroad, it can be difficult to find the right one to use. Our international team of researchers has tested a wide range of VPNs across dozens of Netflix libraries. That way, you can be sure those we recommend are the best available.\n\nGlobal network: Netflix is available in most countries worldwide. With this in mind, it’s important to have a VPN with a global network of servers. These should be available across dozens of countries including the USA, UK, and Canada to name a few. In the case of most VPNs listed, thousands of servers are at your disposal.\n\nSpeed: At the very least, Netflix recommends a connection speed of 25 Mbps for streaming in 4K. All of the best VPNs for changing Netflix region are more than fast enough to support this. Thanks to the added benefit of unlimited bandwidth, you’ll be able to stream Netflix without lag or buffering, regardless of your location.\n\nSecurity: If you want to be able to access Netflix securely, you’ll need a VPN that uses 256-bit AES encryption. It should also provide DNS leak protection and a kill switch. We test each VPN for leaks and look for those that offer extra protection, be it through Double VPN servers, an ad-blocker, or a password manager.\n\nPrivacy: Just like not every VPN changes your Netflix region, not every VPN protects your privacy. Having looked at over 140 VPN logging policies, we’ve been able to identify those that don’t keep any identifying logs of users. In many cases, you’ll even be able to pay for the VPN subscription anonymously in Bitcoin.\n\nApps and devices: Netflix is available across a range of devices, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and more. We recommend VPNs offering simultaneous connections and apps across all major operating systems to maximize compatibility.\n\nEase of use: One of the advantages of testing so many VPNs is that we can discover which VPNs have the best apps. With the VPNs in this post, you’ll find apps that are easy to install and navigate. Furthermore, each VPN even has 24-hour live chat and email support should you have any questions.\n\nValue for money: Ironically, some VPNs fail to offer much of the above yet cost significantly more than the VPNs found here! Of course, it helps that for each and every one, we offer a discount coupon. Better still, all of the best VPNs for changing your Netflix region come with a risk-free money-back guarantee.\n\nTake a look at our VPN testing methodology post to learn more about how we test each VPN in categories such as speed and security."
