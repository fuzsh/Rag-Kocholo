        "text": "Last updated on May 23, 2024\n\nAs a rising field within Germanistik, Asian German Studies has been a hotspot for recent scholarship on postcolonialism, orientalism, gender and sexuality studies, area studies, migration studies, and more. Asian German films, along with literature, television series, and new media, have increasingly become desirable teaching materials for courses that explore transnational aspects of German culture, history, and society. This concise Asian German filmography, compiled by Qingyang Freya Zhou (UC Berkeley), Zach Ramon Fitzpatrick (U of Wisconsin-Madison), and Qinna Shen (Bryn Mawr College), aims to provide a teaching guide not only to Germanists, but also to scholars in neighboring academic disciplines. For those who are interested, a longer list of Asian German films can be accessed here.\n\nThis filmography includes fifty critically acclaimed, aesthetically creative, and/or thematically interesting Asian German films produced by filmmakers in both the larger German-speaking world and in Asia, focusing mainly on East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. We prioritize films that are available on VHS, DVD, and online streaming platforms. The list is organized geographically and chronologically. The countries represented are listed in descending order based on the size of the corresponding immigrant groups in Germany (see the figure below for exact numbers). Each entry includes both a short description that highlights unique features of the film and selected works of secondary literature—listed chronologically—that may be assigned as course readings. When scholarly literature is not available, we opt for journalistic articles, interviews, and blog posts, with the intention of inviting more further research.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that classifying transnational films by country could be problematic. Indeed, some of the films listed complicate this practice. For example, Der schweigende Stern has Asian characters with three different nationalities; Drachenfutter has both Pakistani and Chinese characters; and the titular character from Tschick is a multiracial Russian national but “looks Mongolian” and is played by an actor of Mongolian descent. Nevertheless, we eventually decided to keep national categories for two reasons. First, such a practice will provide clearer reference for instructors who want to quickly search for the specific materials for their courses. Second, listing the films based on the countries referenced reveals some underlying patterns in Asian German film production. For instance, the relatively small number of Japanese immigrants in Germany and the comparatively large number of Japan-themed films can reveal both a specific form of orientalism at play in the history of the German film industry and contemporary processes of Japanese-German film distribution and exhibition, which aim more for an international audience than for a domestic ethnic audience. By contrast, the considerable sizes of Indian, Pakistani, Thai, Filipino, and Sri Lankan immigrants in Germany and the relative dearth of accessible films that portray these groups might suggest continued marginalization against some South Asians and Southeast Asians.\n\nThe list is intended to serve as an introduction to a rich and diverse repertoire of films that focus on histories of entanglement, contact zones, processes of exchange, modes of translation, and moments of physical and symbolic border crossings. The authors will periodically update this teaching guide to reflect new productions and secondary literature. A longer list of Asian German films, which includes lesser-known titles and lost films, is available here. For suggestions and comments on this teaching guide or the longer filmography, please contact Qingyang Freya Zhou (qingyangzhou@berkeley.edu).\n\nThe three editors have also been working on the anthology Charting Asian German Film History: Imagination, Collaboration, and Diasporic Representation (under contract with Camden House, forthcoming in 2025), with twelve exciting chapters that will add to the growing body of scholarship on Asian German film studies.\n\nSource: https://www.bpb.de/apuz/antirassismus-2020/316771/antiasiatischer-rassismus-in-deutschland\n\nVietnam\n\nGeschwader Fledermaus (The Bat Squadron, Erich Engel, 1958), available on DVD; order from the DEFA Film Library\n\nAn early German feature film about the First Indochina War, featuring two Vietnamese actors.

The characters navigate school, friendships, family, mental health, and love without resorting to tragic coming-out narratives. The series also heavily integrates social media, with characters’ own Instagram pages (Fatou and Kieu My), and an official Instagram fan account with more content. This 10-episode season would lend itself to courses on 21st century Germany, especially those focusing on social media, queer, and/or BIPOC topics.\n\nSecondary criticism:\n\nLe, Nhi. “The Female Gaze: Es werden zu wenig realistische Geschichten über nicht-weiße Menschen erzählt.” Jetzt.de.

As a form of damage control, the organization brings in a panel of women of color, including a character played by Minh-Khai Phan-Thi, the first Vietnamese German TV personality.

Though overshadowed by the protest of the Chinese student club in Berlin, May’s film was the first in German cinema to cast an amateur ethnic Chinese actor, Henry Sze, as one of the two male leads. This revolutionary casting decision, however, does not save the film from racist clichés typical of the era. We advocate preserving and restoring the film, given its historical and cinematic importance.\n\nSecondary criticism:\n\nLenssen, Claudia. “Rachedurst und Reisefieber.

Lead actor and co-producer Himansu Rai wanted to use the film to provide an alternative to German orientalist films, such as Joe May’s Das indische Grabmal (The Indian Tomb, 1921).

The first adaptation by Joe May (1921) is available on YouTube (Parts I & II combined). The second adaptation by Richard Eichberg (1938) is available on YouTube (Part II only). The third adaptation by Fritz Lang (1959) is available in two parts on MUBI (part I only), Amazon (Part I: Der Tiger von Eschnapur / The Tiger of Eschnapur; Part II: Das indische Grabmal), and Tubi (Part I; Part II)\n\nAs prime examples of German cinematic Orientalism and brownface acting, all three films adapt the novel in different ways, reflecting the spirit of their respective times (the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, and Cold War West Germany). The plot is largely centered around the figure of the exotically handsome but vicious Maharaja, who invites a German architect to realize a major construction project. Abhorred by the sadistic Indian ruler, who attempts to punish his unfaithful wife through live burial, the German protagonists navigate a series of obstacles in order to return to Europe. Each film adaptation features sensuous dance scenes (especially in Eichberg’s and Lang’s versions) that generated much buzz and controversy during their release.\n\nSecondary criticism:\n\nShedde, Meenakshi, and Vinzenz Hediger. “Come on, Baby, Be My Tiger: Inventing India on the German Screen in Der Tiger von Eschnapur and Das indische Grabmal.” Rogue Press (2005). http://www.rouge.com.au/7/tiger.html.\n\nTratner, Michael. “Lovers, Filmmakers, and Nazis: Fritz Lang’s Last Two Movies as Autobiography.” Biography 29, no. 1 (2006): 86-100.\n\nLembke, Gerrit. “Thea von Harbou-Fremdbilder in den Erzähltexten der Frühen Moderne: Der unsterbliche Acker, Frau im Mond und Das indische Grabmal.” In Habitus und Fremdbild in der deutschen Prosaliteratur des 19. und 20.

Despite its questionable representational methods, the film does intend to be anti-racist. However, most remember the film for its rebellious second half, where Dschingis and one of his former bullies steal a sailboat together and try to escape their problems.\n\nSecondary criticism:\n\nGollub, Christian-Albrecht and Dagmar Stern. “Hark Bohm: Films Addressing Questions.” New German Filmmakers: From Oberhausen Through the 1970s, edited by Klaus Phillips.

The film is a moving tribute to Steyerl’s deceased friend, Andrea Wolf. It also touches on many other topics: the 1968 generation and RAF (Rote Armee Fraktion); the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) and Kurdish nationalism; oppression and violence; Kurdish people in Germany; export of GDR-era ammunitions; Bruce Lee and martial arts; women in media; sex and violence. It is also a brilliant aesthetic experiment: the self-reflexive and compact narrative structure of the film, the traveling image, and the relationship between fact and fiction provide rich topics for classroom discussions.\n\nSecondary criticism:\n\nLafuente, Pablo. “For a Populist Cinema: On Hito Steyerl’s November and Lovely Andrea.” Afterall: A Journal of Art, Context and Enquiry 19 (2008): 64-70.\n\nDemos, T.
