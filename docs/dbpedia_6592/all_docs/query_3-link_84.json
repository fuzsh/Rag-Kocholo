The director, Vikas Bahl, took a crew of 25 people from India to shoot the movie in about 145 locations in just 40 days.\n\nThe locations were just booked a couple of hours before the crew would hurry to go to another shooting location. They often shot three to four locations in a day. The crew would also eat their meals at nearby restaurants. Actors would also sometimes change clothes in public toilets and in restaurants.\n\nThe film was made on a budget of $2.2 million, and it grossed $18 million globally—a major commercial success. It was also one of the highest-grossing Bollywood film with a female protagonist.\n\n#14 Premam (2016)\n\nLocation(s) in Europe: Western Norway\n\nPremam is a coming-of-age romantic drama film about a college lecturer whose first love turns out to be a failure. He rekindles his love interest and this journey takes him through many stages in his life to find his real purpose in this world. The plot shows the protagonist’s life from his teenage years to adulthood.\n\nThis film is a remake of the 2015 Malayalam-language film of the same title.\n\nThe best thing about this film is that it was shot in the greatest and mostly untouched locations in Western Norway such as Oslo’s central station, the barcode buildings, and the waterfront area—not to mention the urban Oslo.\n\nPremam is indeed an awaited Bollywood movie in 2016, however, it was also subjected to trolls and hatred by the fans of the original Malayalam film—which is expected as it happens in most remake films.\n\nThey were criticized for not recreating the magic of the original music. Fans also criticized the performance of the leads as overacting and that they failed to remake the film according to their standards.\n\nBut despite all the backlash and trolls that the film has received, that trailer alone crossed over 2 million views on the day of its release. The final box office collection of the film reached $9.8 million.\n\n#15 Tamasha (2015)\n\nLocation(s) in Europe: Corsica, France\n\nTamasha follows the story of a boy and girl who meets in Corsica and they have decided not to let each other know their real names or personalities.

Some flashbacks that show the younger version of the lead actor were shot in Shimla, India.\n\nCorsica is a lesser-known island in the Southern portion of France.
