        "text": "My mother wouldn’t let me see this movie in 1961 when it was in theaters because I was gang raped myself in 1960. Finally, after all these years, I know why. Well, actually, I know a lot of reasons why, but some of them would constitute spoilers.\n\nFor one thing, I know I would have been upset that this girl’s rape was treated as a very serious matter, and in fact the four soldiers who raped her faced the death penalty. She was 16; I was 13, and my rapists were charged with statutory rape: that is, the grand jury concluded that I had not fought. In those days, stat rape was a “boys will be boys” minor offense. None of them even got jail time, only probation.\n\nBut this really isn’t about me, it’s about a young German girl raped by four American soldiers. (Or maybe three, with one somewhat questionable.) She was the town’s banker’s daughter, and had been swimming in a brief 2-piece bathing suit (not really a bikini, as it was described in court) with her boyfriend. They quarreled, and she swam across the river to where she had left her clothes while he pouted on the other shore. Unfortunately, as she was changing her clothes, the half-drunk soldiers were spying on her, and came out of the bushes to rape her.\n\nThe basic facts were there from the start, although of course the soldiers claimed she wanted it. There was a rule that the death penalty could not be imposed unless she held up throughout the trial, including all cross-examination, and so all the defense attorney even tried to do was to rattle her so badly that she withdrew from the trial. He had offered to settle the case for sentences at hard labor before the trial began, but the prosecution was not willing to deal. So nobody believed there was really a question of guilt, except perhaps of the degree of guilt.\n\nIt’s a pretty good movie overall, although the rather insipid theme song is played way too much, including coming from the juke box at the Florida Bar even before the rape took place. Some of the secondary actors are a bit over-played, but both Kirk Douglas and E.G. Marshall are their professional best, and very believable.\n\nNOTE: Normally I review movies I have rented from Netflix. I had this one on my wish list for a very long time when I finally saw it for sale on Amazon. So if you want to see it and you can’t find it, email me and I’ll arrange to loan it to you.\n\nStatements in this review do not necessarily express the thoughts or opinions of the Ethical Society of St. Louis or its leadership."
