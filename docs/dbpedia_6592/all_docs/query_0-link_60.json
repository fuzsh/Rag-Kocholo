Concrete Utopia (2023)\n\nWho’s in it: Lee Byung-hun, Park Seo-joon, Park Bo-young\n\nRun time: 130 minutes\n\nDirected by Um Tae-hwa, this thoughtful disaster thriller follows the survivors of a deadly earthquake that occurrs in Seoul. They all seek shelter at a single apartment complex, but when resources start to dwindle, a new leader gets elected and outsiders get evicted, leading to total chaos. In my review, I wrote, \"Concrete Utopia is so much more than a disaster film. The wreckage and corpses mostly serve as a backdrop while Tae-hwa zeroes in on social ethics and the mystery of human nature.\"\n\nYong Film\n\n3.

I wanted the audience to have a very specific cinematic experience where they go inside a movie theater, sit down and sort of feel this movie as they watch it.\"\n\nLJ Film\n\n5.

Director Lee Chang-dong told The Metrograpgh, \"My films can be said to be stories about individuals fighting to find the meaning of their lives. They are the weak, yet they engage in a reckless and foolish fight with the absolute strong.\"\n\nHB Entertainment\n\n10.
