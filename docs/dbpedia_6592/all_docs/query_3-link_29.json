        "text": "Matthias Glasner’s epic dysfunctional family drama Dying has won the top prize for best film at the 2024 German Film Awards, the Lolas.\n\nDying was one of the critical favorites at this year’s Berlin Film Festival, where Glasner won the Silver Bear for best screenplay. The film stars Lars Eidinger as a classical conductor with an extremely dysfunctional family.\n\nIn addition to the top prize, Corinna Harfoch won the best actress Lola for her role in Dying, where she plays Eidinger’s sharp-tonged and cold-hearted mother. Her Dying co-star Hans-Uwe Bauer took best supporting actor, and the film also took the Lola for best film music for composer Lorenz Dangel.\n\nAyşe Polat took best director and best screenplay for In the Blind Spot, her twisty documentary-style conspiracy thriller set in modern-day Turkey. The film, which premiered in Berlin’s Encounters section last year, won the top prize at the Oldenburg Film Festival, the German Independence Award. It follows a German film team shooting a documentary in a remote Kurdish village who begin to witness mysterious happenings and become entwined in a sinister conspiracy. The film also made it to the best film podium, winning the best film Lola in bronze.\n\nSimon Morzé took the best actor Lola for the lead role in Adrian Goiginger’s WW2 film The Fox, in which he portrays a young German soldier who saves a wounded fox cub and takes it with him into occupied France. The film, which is based on a true story, also took the runner-up best film Lola in silver.\n\nThe best supporting actress nod went to Adele Neuhauser for her turn in 15 Years, Chris Kraus’ sequel to his 2006 drama Four Minutes, which co-stars Hannah Herzsprung and The Zone of Interest lead Christian Friedl.\n\nTimm Kröger’s experimental sci-fi feature The Universal Theory, a black-and-white drama about the multiverse, was a big winner in the technical categories, winning Lolas for best cinematography (for Roland Stuprich), best visual effects (Karlem Saleh, Adrian Meyer) and best costume design (Cosima Vellenzer, Anika Klatt). The film premiered in Venice last year and won the Venice Independent Critics’ Prize.\n\nThe recreation of the 1980s pop music world in Milli Vanilli’s biopic Girl You Know It’s True also won over the German academy, with Ingken Benesch winning the Lola for best costume design and Alisza Pfeifer and Christina Baier taking the prize for best hair and makeup.\n\nThe best documentary prize went to Steffi Niederzoll’s Seven Winters in Tehran, a harrowing first-hand account of a young Iranian woman convicted of killing her would-be rapist.\n\nIn addition to being Germany‘s top cinema prize, the German Film Awards are also the most lucrative, coming with some $3.25 million (€3 million) in prize money for the winners and nominees, which they can use to finance future projects.\n\nA highlight of the evening came when German cinema legend Hanna Schygulla turned her acceptance speech for her honorary Lola for lifetime achievement into a freewheeling combination of personal recollections, political speech and stand-up routine. “People call me an icon,” said the Lilli Marleen and The Marriage of Maria Braun actress. “Well, why not?”\n\nSee the full list of winners below.\n\nBest Film\n\nIn The Blind Spot dir.
