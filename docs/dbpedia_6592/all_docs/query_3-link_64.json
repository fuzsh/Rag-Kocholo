        "text": "10 weird German words\n\nLike any language, German has its own strange and peculiar words and phrases. Here are ten weird German words and their meanings:\n\nOhrwurm (ear worm)\n\nThis German word refers to having the melody and/or lyrics of a song stuck in your head for an extended period.Anybody who has ever experienced this can attest to just how annoying the Ohrwurm can be.\n\nWeichei (soft egg)\n\nIn German, a \"soft egg\", means someone who is a coward or weak-minded – they’ll just go with the crowd or what is easy instead of standing up for what they think is right, but with the right person and intent, it can have a lighter, more humorous meaning.\n\nBackpfeifengesicht (slap face)\n\nBackpfeifengesicht describes someone who you feel needs a slap in the face. You may want to be careful if and when you use this one: it's best used among good friends unless you’re wanting to cause tension!\n\nErklärungsnot (explanation poverty)\n\nErklärungsnot describes the state you might find yourself in when no excuse will get you out of the trouble you're in. No sufficient explanation for not doing your homework or lying to your wife? That’s Erklärungsnot.\n\nPurzelbaum (tumble tree)\n\nEvery child in Germany knows all about this one. It may sound like it's part of the plant kingdom, but, a Purzelbaum describes a somersault on the ground, often landing in the dirtand usually resulting in dirty knees.\n\nZungenbrecher (tongue breaker)\n\nZungenbrecher is much less gruesome than it sounds. It means \"tongue twister\" or a phrase that’s very hard to pronounce due to its sequence of similar sounding letters. A very well-known one is: Blaukraut bleibt Blaukraut und Brautkleid bleibt Brautkleid. Can you say it ten times, quickly?\n\nSchattenparker (shadow parker)\n\nThis is actually an insult for men who are seen to be engaging in unmanly behavior; for example looking for shaded parking, according to the literal translation. Similar in meaning, a Warmduscher is someone who showers with warm water.\n\nKuddelmuddel (muddled mess)\n\nKuddelmuddel describes mess, chaos, or hodgepodge arrangements or scenes. Clever alternatives which mean the same include Tohuwabohu, Wirrwarr, Mischmasch, and Kladderadatsch\n\nLuftschloss (air castle)\n\nThis refers to an impossible or unrealistic dream-- like building a castle in the air -- and is used to describe that which, sadly, just cannot be achieved.\n\nKopfkino (head cinema)\n\nThe word Kopfkino refers to mentally playing out an entire scene in your mind, as if in a movie theater.\n\n5 German words that only exist in German\n\nSome words are unique to the German language. See these and exemplifying the original thinking and culture of the German nation:\n\n1. Schnapsidee\n\nThis is a quirky German word that means, \"schnaps idea\" or \"booze idea\". It's often used to indicate an idea so incredibly stupid, unwise, or pointless that it's originator must be slightly (or very) inebriated. It's generally used to refer to any idea that seems foolish, stupid or improbable.\n\n2. Weltschmerz\n\nWeltschmerz or \"world pain\" is used to sum up a feeling of melancholy due to unknown reasons. In short, sadness even when everything is going well.\n\n3.Verschlimmbesserung\n\nIf you tried to comfort yourself with ice-cream and it fell on the ground, it can only be described as Verschlimmbesserung. While this German word doesn't have a simple literal translation, it describes an attempt at improving a bad or hopeless situation, but this attempt only makes things worse.\n\n4. Fernweh\n\nFernweh describes the feeling of wanting to be somewhere else. Fernweh is not quite homesickness, but more a longing for a distant place, the best remedy being, probably, a vacation.\n\n5. Zeitgeist\n\nSimply put, Zeitgeist, which is now often used in English too, refers to the mood of contemporary culture and society or an understanding of the \"spirit of the times\".\n\nFind Your Perfect Match\n\nSearch by city, major, or field of study and find your dream study program in Germany.\n\nFind a Course\n\nWant to study in Germany?"
