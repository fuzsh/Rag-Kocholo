        "text": "Do you ever feel like you should be more productive while binge-watching Netflix?\n\nThe good news is, you can be!\n\nWith a few smart viewing choices, you can improve your German language vocabulary and comprehension while you watch. German movies on Netflix are packed with real-world conversations, slang and regional dialects to help you develop an ear for spoken German outside the classroom.\n\nGerman kino (cinema) has a long history dating back to the late 19th century. Whether you’re at one of Berlin’s premiere art-house cinemas or at a chain, you can expect an intermission during long movies to stretch your legs and buy tiny ice creams, sweet popcorn, or bier from an attendant.\n\nToday, of course, you can create your own German movie experience on the small screen at home. In the past few years, Netflix has amassed an impressive collection of 17,000 international titles in over 60 languages in its content library. While French, Spanish and Korean titles have captured the spotlight, German titles represent a small but mighty contingent of these.\n\nFrom independent films to German Netflix series, you’ve got plenty of choices to help boost your German learning, from comedy to drama to thrillers.\n\nCan I learn German by watching German movies?\n\nWhile movies shouldn’t be your only language-learning strategy, they’re certainly a good supplement to move you toward fluency or maintain your level if you’re no longer in the classroom. Here are a few recommendations to get the most out of your viewing:\n\n1. Use German language audio only\n\nWhile you can switch almost any movie or show into German dubbing, we recommend watching content with German as the original language. Having the audio match up with the actors’ mouths helps you hear and understand the words better.\n\n2. Use subtitles as an aid.\n\nListening to an all-German film can leave you lost if you’re just starting out. If you’re a beginner, use English subtitles to help you follow the plot. If you’re an intermediate or advanced learner, switch to German subtitles to help you follow the story in German and reinforce German spelling and writing.\n\n3. Use playback.\n\nUnlike in a movie theater, if you didn’t catch a phrase or sentence the first time, you can rewind and watch it again.\n\nHow to find German movies on Netflix\n\nFinding German-language movies on Netflix is simple on a web browser thanks to the ‘Browse by Languages’ tab on the upper navigation bar. Click ‘Browse by Languages’ then search by setting your original language to German.\n\nIn the Netflix app, you can simply search for ‘German language’ or ‘Deutsch’ in the search bar.\n\n8 best German movies on Netflix\n\nReady for the list?
