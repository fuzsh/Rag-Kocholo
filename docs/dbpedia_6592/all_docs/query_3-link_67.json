        "text": "Author: Justyna Cyrankiewicz ‚Äî Last update: 18 April 2024\n\nEurope is a hub for cinematic excellence, boasting a rich history of film and cinematographic production. The continent‚Äôs schools have educated many of the world‚Äôs most influential filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Susanne Bier, etc.\n\nAs you probably know, Europe also hosts some of the most renowned film festivals, making for quite a robust environment to pursue cinematography in.\n\nStudy Film & TV: Find Bachelors & Masters in English\n\nüèÜ Top Film Schools in Europe\n\nWhile there are no official rankings for the best film schools in Europe, several institutions consistently appear on league tables by, for example, QS or the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHere are some of the top universities and schools offering Film degrees or training courses:\n\nUniversity Country Degree Type Academy of Performing Arts, Film and TV School (FAMU) Czechia Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs Catalyst Berlin Germany Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, Short courses La F√©mis France Workshops, Summer courses Lodz Film School Poland Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs Macromedia University of Applied Sciences Germany Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs MetFilm School (London, Berlin) United Kingdom, Germany Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs National Film School of Denmark Denmark Bachelor‚Äôs National Film School, Italy Italy Three-year training courses Norwegian Film School Norway Master‚Äôs Royal College of Art (RCA) United Kingdom Master‚Äôs\n\nKnowing what interests you the most in cinematography can help you choose an institution by browsing through degrees and specific courses.\n\nüéûÔ∏è Degrees Related to Film & TV\n\nThere are many English-taught degrees related to Film & TV; some more practical, some more theory-focused.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nCinematography ‚Äî MetFilm School Berlin\n\nCreative Media Production ‚Äî Prague City University\n\nFilmmaking ‚Äî Macromedia University of Applied Sciences\n\nScreenwriting ‚Äî Catalyst Berlin\n\nCinema Studies ‚Äî Stockholm University\n\nFilm ‚Äî American University of Rome\n\nFilm and High-End Television Production ‚Äî University of Derby\n\nFilm and Motion Design ‚Äî SRH Berlin University of Applied Sciences\n\nDigital Direction ‚Äî Royal College of Art\n\nComparative Literature and Film ‚Äî University of Kent\n\nüèõÔ∏è Film Schools vs Universities\n\nBoth film schools and universities offer valid paths to a career in Film. The most important factor, of course, is to acquire the skills you need for your future job.\n\nFilm schools often provide a more specialised and hands-on approach, focusing on practical skills and filmmaking techniques.\n\nConversely, universities tend to offer a broader educational experience that combines film with other academic disciplines, providing a multidisciplinary perspective.\n\nSome private universities, such as Metfilm or Catalyst, have larger budgets and offer equipment and studios to support student projects.\n\nOkay, once you‚Äôve got this, it‚Äôs time to discuss the practical aspects of studying in Europe.\n\nüí∏ Tuition at Top Film Schools\n\nOn average, tuition fees for Film degrees in Europe are between ‚Ç¨10,000 and ‚Ç¨20,000 a year for Bachelor‚Äôs degrees and between ‚Ç¨15,000 and ‚Ç¨25,000 for Master‚Äôs degrees.\n\nThese costs can vary depending on the subject, country, and level of study. Private universities‚Äô tuition fees can go up to ‚Ç¨30,000 or more.\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to consider the cost of living, as many top schools are located in expensive cities such as London, Milan, Berlin, and Copenhagen.\n\nAdditionally, you need to keep in mind the gear cost, which in Film is an essential part of studying. Good universities provide equipment to be borrowed for student use, but you still might need to invest in personal materials for practice.\n\nThe good news is that some tuition-free options or alternatives with low tuition fees exist in countries like Germany or Austria, especially for EU/EEA citizens. However, admission to tuition-free Film programs can be highly competitive.\n\nüìù Are There English Requirements at Film Schools in Europe?\n\nIf courses run in English, students are usually required to provide evidence of their English language proficiency.\n\nThe most common tests accepted are IELTS or TOEFL iBT; however, some universities might also accept Duolingo English Tests, Cambridge Certificates, or even completing a university-specific English test.\n\nFor example, at the Royal College of Art, if a student has yet to reach the required English language level to begin the program, the College offers an online Pre-Sessional course.\n\nTo get specific information, browse through the website of the institution you are interested in or contact their admissions office.\n\nüé¨ Other admissions requirements\n\nIn addition to a high level of English, there are other standard admission requirements, such as a motivation letter, a CV, past grade reports, and references.\n\nA film portfolio is not always required, but - as always in the art world - it does add value. Depending on the course you are applying to, it might be a video, a story, or even proof of participating in contests or being active in the industry.\n\nThe exact admission requirements vary, so it‚Äôs necessary to check the specific university or school application process. Some universities, like Lodz Film School, may require an entrance exam for international students.\n\nüìπ Facilities at Top Film Institutions\n\nTop Film institutions in Europe often provide state-of-the-art facilities to support student projects.\n\nHere are things that you should look for when choosing where to study:\n\nmultiple film studios\n\nat least one green screen studio\n\ndubbing studios for audio\n\nmixing studios\n\ncomputers and software for post-production and VFX\n\nopportunity to borrow equipment and props\n\nüìΩÔ∏è Career Outcomes\n\nWhile a degree in Film & TV is most commonly associated with becoming a film director, it may also open the door to other career paths related to movie production, such as:\n\nCinematography\n\nScreenwriting/playwriting\n\nFilm editing\n\nSound production\n\nCinematic production\n\nLighting\n\nAnimation\n\nVisual effects\n\nAnd it is also possible to pursue roles that are part of the film industry but without direct involvement in the filmmaking process, such as:\n\nFilm theory\n\nFilm history\n\nFilm criticism & festival curation\n\nOnce you know more or less what path you‚Äôre interested in, you can narrow down your search of institutions by picking between film schools and universities.\n\nüéÄ Wrapping up\n\nIn conclusion, Europe offers a plethora of exceptional film schools that can ignite your creativity, hone your skills, and provide a solid foundation for a successful Film career.\n\nWhether you choose a renowned institution with a long-standing reputation or a lesser-known gem with a unique approach, immersing yourself in Europe‚Äôs rich cinematic history and cultural diversity will kick-start your filmmaking journey.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nFind Bachelors & Masters in Film & TV\n\n262 Film & TV Programmes in Europe"
