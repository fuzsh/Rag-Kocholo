        "text": "When German filmmaker Andreas Dresen was looking to cast the lead in his compelling WWII biopic From Hilde, with Love, one person stood out: Babylon Berlin star Liv Lisa Fries.\n\n\"I have always had the feeling, when I saw her acting, that you could look straight into her soul through her eyes. And this is very interesting for a character like Hilde, who is, in the beginning, very naive and then gets stronger and stronger,\" he says.\n\nBased on the story of real-life medical assistant Hilde Coppi, the film shows how she met her future husband Hans while running interference with a group of young Berliners appalled by the rise of the Nazi regime. Their resistance cell was dubbed the Red Orchestra, after their communist connections.\n\nThey would risk life and limb to paste stickers over anti-Soviet propaganda posters and relay messages from German prisoners of war communicating with family members via the Voice of Russia aka Radio Moscow.\n\nWhen the Gestapo closed in on their ranks, a pregnant Hilde held her head high and refused to forsake her beliefs as she was sent to Plötzensee prison.\n\nThis is a tragic but inspiring tale of love, hope and resistance against the odds — the perfect subject for the opening night movie of this year's German Film Festival, following its global premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) in February. (It was nominated for the highest award at the festival, the Golden Bear.)\n\nOriginally, Hilde's story was to be part of a TV series highlighting various German women who became resistance fighters in the Red Orchestra.\n\nScreenwriter Laila Stieler focused on Hilde's story as a proof-of-concept episode. It soon became apparent there were legs for a feature.\n\n\"Hilde's destiny hit me very hard, because she is a kind of shy hero who wouldn't necessarily call herself a resistance fighter. But she was so brave,\" Dresen says.\n\nA divided Germany\n\nDresen was born in Gera, East Germany, three hours' drive south of Berlin, in 1963. It was the same year US President John F Kennedy gave his historic speech in Berlin on the West German side of the wall.\n\nDuring the Cold War years, the Red Orchestra were mythologised on either side of the divide — portrayed as either titanic warriors or villainous traitors to the cause.\n\n\"The reason was to protect or to fight against the East German system,\" Dresen says.\n\n\"We heard a lot of cliches about the so-called resistance fighters who were always superheroes who were so big and so strong, and I felt always so small in comparison.\"\n\nFrom Hilde, with Love reveals a more realistic side of Hilde and her idealistic friends. \"For me, it was very interesting to show them as human beings; as young people falling in love with each other, who wanted to have families,\" Dresen says.\n\nDresen says Stieler was interested more in this angle than historical cliches: \"We also wanted to show characters who are part of the Nazi system in a more human way. They were not always dangerous animals.\"\n\nThis includes a steely warden at Plötzensee (Lisa Wagner), who gradually softens towards Hilde after she gives birth, and Dresen regular Alexander Scheer as real-life pastor Harald Poelchau.\n\nThe prison chaplain helped people escape as the Nazis seized power, comforted those sentenced to be executed by the regime, and later wrote a book about his experiences.\n\n\"In a way, even if he was a part of the system, he brought a lot of humanity to these situations and helped a lot of people, including Hilde,\" Dresen says.\n\nLest we forget\n\nDresen wanted the film to feel current, with production designer Susanne Hopf paring back the period details, Birgitt Kilian's costume design drawing heavily on the city's op shops and Uta Spikermann's hairstyling not entirely dissimilar to young Berliners today.\n\n\"We tried to create an atmosphere for the movie which brings it a little bit closer to our present,\" Dresen says.\n\nIn this way, From Hilde, with Love feels like a clarion call and a warning all in one.\n\n\"In my opinion, it's better to make characters comparable to our time instead of a historical dimension where you can say, 'This happened a long time ago and has nothing to do with my world,'\" Dresen says.\n\nHilde's actual son, Hans, was one of the film's first viewers during a private screening in Berlin.\n\n\"It was very moving, because he could deal with a time in his life that he was a part of, but cannot remember, because he was only eight months old when he left his mother,\" Dresen says of the screening.\n\n\"He was touched very deeply.\"\n\nNow aged 81, Hans was a great help to the production.\n\n\"He became a historian researching the Red Orchestra… and he helped us so much in making the movie,\" Dresen says.\n\nHans also attended the Berlinale premiere.\n\n\"He went on stage and raised his fist like a resistance fighter and had a standing ovation,\" Dresen says.\n\n\"This was kind of like closing a circle of his life, which began so horrifying because he lost his parents and, after 81 years, they came back to him.\""
