Marshall\n\nTown Without Pity is a 1961 American, Swiss, and West German international co-production drama film directed by Gottfried Reinhardt. Produced by The Mirisch Corporation, the film stars Kirk Douglas, Christine Kaufmann, and E. G. Marshall. Coincidentally, this movie came out the same year that John A.
