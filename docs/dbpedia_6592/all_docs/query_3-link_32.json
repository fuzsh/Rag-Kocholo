The selection screener must also be provided within the respective deadline.\n\nHow do I submit my film to Berlinale?\n\nYou need to register your film by completing the film application form. Afterwards, you can upload the film via the website into the Berlinale Media Service.\n\nMay I submit more than one film?\n\nYes, you may submit more than one film but you will need to complete the application form for each film individually.\n\nDo you accept documentaries? For which sections?\n\nYes, the Berlinale accepts documentaries in all its sections.\n\nMay I apply to more than one section?\n\nYes, you can submit to multiple sections with only one application, but check the guidelines of the respective sections to make sure that your film is eligible.\n\nFor which sections can I submit short films?\n\nShort films can be be submitted to Berlinale Shorts (max. 30') and to Generation (max. 20').\n\nWhere can I submit a film to the European Film Market?\n\nIf you want to submit a film to the European Film Market please use the EFM Film Entry.\n\nI have already registered my film but want to apply for an additional section. Do I need to fill in another application form?\n\nNo, please contact the until the respective submission deadline either by sending an email or by using the respective link under My Film Entry. They will add the section to your application.\n\nI would like to add/correct the information given in my application. How can I do that?\n\nPlease send the updated information, by stating the title of the film, either per email to the or by using the corresponding link under My Film Entry.\n\nDo you accept re-submissions?\n\nNo, the Berlinale does not accept films that have already been considered for past Berlinale editions.\n\nCan I submit through “Withoutabox” or “FilmFreeway”?\n\nNo, you can only submit directly via www.berlinale.de.\n\nAre the Berlin Independent Film Festival and/or the Woche der Kritik (Berlin Critic’s Week) part of the Berlinale?\n\nNo, both are festivals on their own and are not connected to the Berlinale programme.\n\nDo I get a confirmation on the submission of my film?\n\nYes, you will get a confirmation by email.\n\nMy selection screener is in a technical format that is not mentioned on your list of accepted screening formats for selection. What can I do? Can I send it nonetheless?\n\nNo, please do not send selection screeners in technical formats that do not comply with the accepted formats. The accepted formats are: upload via My Film Entry (mp4 format - H.264, AAC, Stereo) as well as DCP in exceptional cases. An additional handling fee of 200 euro (7 % VAT included) will be charged when submitting a DCP for selection purposes.\n\nIf your film is available only in a different format (e. g. Blu-ray, HDCAM, QT ProRes file), please convert it into one of the two accepted technical formats before you submit it. See Technical Specifications for Selection Screeners. If you have any additional technical questions, please contact the Berlinale .\n\nMay I send a link (e. g. Vimeo) as selection screener?\n\nNo. The Berlinale works with neither Vimeo nor any other external streaming links during film selection, but exclusively uses her proprietary internal streaming system for selection screenings instead. But you can take the same data file that is provided on the Vimeo platform and upload it as your selection screener onto Berlinale's internal online streaming service during the online film application or later on via My Film Entry.\n\nDo you accept trailers for selection purposes?\n\nNo, the Berlinale does not accept any trailers for selection purposes but only accepts complete versions of the registered films.\n\nDo you accept rough cuts/works in progress for selection?\n\nThe film version that is submitted should at least have reached the stage of picture lock. Rough cuts are accepted only in rare and exceptional cases. If in doubt, please get in touch with either the festival’s or with the section(s) you are submitting to.\n\nCan I send an updated version of my selection screener at a later date?\n\nNo, please do not send any updated version(s) of your already submitted selection screener – unless the festival explicitly asks you for it.\n\nDo you need a subtitled version for the selection screenings?\n\nYes, the Berlinale requests an English subtitled version for the selection screenings (except if the film’s original version is English). For Berlinale Shorts and Generation films in German can be submitted in their original versions without subtitles. In case of selection for the festival English subtitles will be required.\n\nWhen do I have to send/upload my film?\n\nThe selection screener of your film should be received by the festival within the aforementioned respective deadlines (November 1, 2023 / November 15, 2023).\n\nPlease note: German productions and co-productions have to be world premieres in order to be eligible for Competition, Encounters and Berlinale Shorts. For Panorama, Forum and Generation a European premiere is required. Films may neither have been presented in Europe nor in Germany beforehand (no presentation at any festival/online festival, no release, no public presentation in any form in Germany beforehand).\n\nMy film has been presented at an online festival. Is it still eligible?\n\nFor the sections Competition, Encounters and Berlinale Shorts an international premiere is the minimum requirement. A presentation at an online festival will be tolerated as long as the streamings are only accessible in the country of origin (geoblocked).\n\nFor Panorama, Forum and Generation an European premiere is the minimum requirement. A presentationat an online festival will be tolerated as long as the streamings are only accessible outside of Europe/in the country of origin (geoblocked). However, please note the special rule that German films may not be presented at any online festival before the Berlinale.\n\nMay I still submit my film even though it has been broadcast on television?\n\nIf the film was broadcast only in its country of origin and nowhere else, it is still eligible for Panorama, Forum and Generation. Neither Competition, Encounters, nor Berlinale Shorts accept films with previous TV broadcasts.\n\nMay I still submit my film even though it has previously been published on the internet?\n\nIf the film’s availability on the internet was restricted to the country of the film’s origin, it may still apply for Panorama, Forum and Generation. Neither Competition, Encounters nor Berlinale Shorts accept films that have been available on the internet or via VOD.\n\nMy film has already been released on DVD or Blu-ray. May I still submit it?\n\nNo, it is then no longer eligible for any of the Berlinale’s sections.\n\nA trailer of my film is already available on the internet. Is the film still eligible?\n\nYes, it is. A trailer does not present any breach of our regulations.\n\nWhat exactly does „year of production“ mean?\n\nThe year of production is the year when the film was completed (and does not refer to the period of shooting).\n\nWhat is the maximum duration for short films?\n\nDuration limits differ from section to section: the maximum duration for films in the Berlinale Shorts competition is 30 minutes, for Generation 20 minutes.\n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the eligibility of your film, please contact the festival’s via email.\n\nWhat is the fee for processing a film submission?\n\nThe processing fee for feature-length films is 175 euros, for short films 75 euros, no matter for how many sections you apply. Please check the correct currency exchange rate with your bank and note that debit cards are not accepted.\n\nAre there any early bird discounts or additional late fees?\n\nNo, for films applying for the festival programme, there are no early bird discounts/late fees.\n\nWill I get the processing fee refunded if it turns out that my film is not eligible?\n\nNo, you cannot get a refund in case your film is not eligible. Therefore, please carefully check the guidelines of the section(s) if the film is eligible or not prior to submitting the film!\n\nCan I get a refund in case the festival does not take place?\n\nThe fee is requested to cover administrative costs and will not be reimbursed under any circumstance.\n\nI am having trouble paying with my credit card. What might be the problem?\n\nPlease note that your credit card must be authorised to make online payments (with 3D secure authentication). Prepaid or debit cards are not accepted.\n\nEnsure that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows. Ideally, you should use the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Please do not refresh the webpage for around 1 minute during the payment process and do not repeatedly press the “Pay” button. You may experience some delay during payment, especially for international transactions.\n\nIf you continue to encounter problems during your credit card payment, please email the festival’s web support team.\n\nWhy does PayPal show that my payment is going to KBB GmbH?\n\nThe Berlinale is a division of Kulturveranstaltungen des Bundes in Berlin GmbH (Cultural Events of the Federal Government in Berlin Ltd), KBB for short. Payments are therefore made to the KBB GmbH account.\n\nI neither own a credit card nor do I have a PayPal account. What can I do?\n\nPlease get in touch with the via email. They will arrange for you to pay via wire transfer.\n\nI’m a student. What are the special conditions?\n\nIt is possible to submit up to ten short films for 250 euros and/or up to six feature films for 350 euros. Queries about collective submissions can only be made by the responsible film school employee to the Berlinale’s via email. Unfortunately, no discounts can be granted for individual submission by students.\n\nI want to submit my film to more than one section. Do I have to pay a processing fee for each single section?\n\nNo, for each film the processing fee is payable only once, regardless of the number of sections it is submitted to. See also “General”.\n\nWhen will I be notified of the Berlinale’s decision regarding my film?\n\nPlease do understand, that selection is a very careful and sensitive process which needs time. Generally, notifications will not be sent out before the end of the year (2023) - the final decisions are usually made in the January immediately preceding the festival.\n\nIn case of urgency – e. g. invitation(s) to (an)other festivaI(s) –, please get in touch with the or the section(s) you are submitting the film to in time(!), and they will do their best to deliver an earlier decision.\n\nHow will I be informed about the decision?\n\nAs soon as the decision has been made by all the sections involved, the official submitter of the film(s) is informed by email. Since everyone submitting a film generally wants to receive the result as quickly as possible within a very short timeframe, rejections are usually sent in the form of a standardised notification.\n\nIf my film is not selected, may I get an explanation on the decision or any other feedback?\n\nPlease understand that the Berlinale cannot provide individual comments on their decisions as the choice of films ultimately selected has been the subject of detailed discussions under manifold criteria.\n\nIf my film is selected, when do you need the festival version?\n\nThe film’s version for presentation in the festival should arrive at the Berlinale Film Office no later than by January 31, 2024. During January/February 2024, however, some sections of the festival (except Competition) will be offering advanced press screenings of selected films in their programmes, and it may therefore become necessary for you to provide the final version of your film some time before the above mentioned deadline. Please coordinate delivery dates directly with the section you are invited to.\n\nWhat kind of subtitles do you request?\n\nIn general, non-English language films have to be subtitled in English at least – BUT: every section has its own policy of subtitles, which can be found in the respective guidelines. In any case, please get in touch with the team of the section your film has been invited into."
