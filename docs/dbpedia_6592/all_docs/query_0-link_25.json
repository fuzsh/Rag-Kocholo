        "meta_description": "In a small German university town in 1933, a birthday celebration for Professor Viktor Roth is interrupted by the news that Hitler has been appointed chancellor. Roth, who is non-Aryan, his daughter Freya, and Martin Breitner, a family friend who loves Freya, are apprehensive about Hitler's rise, but Roth's stepsons, Otto and Erich Von Rohn, and Fritz Marberg, Freya's new fiancé, are enthusiastic. The town's Nazis soon begin to inflict violence on their ideological adversaries and on non-Aryans, and Roth's stepsons leave his house. Freya breaks with Fritz and comes to return Martin's love, but the lovers are separated when Martin, who has helped a non-Aryan friend leave the country, is stranded in Austria. For refusing to acknowledge a difference between Aryan and non-Aryan blood, Roth loses his teaching position and is interned in a concentration camp, and his family's frantic efforts to locate him result only in a brief visit before his mysterious death. On their way to Austria,",

According to an article in LAEx on 10 Sep 1941, Senator Gerald P. Nye wanted to summon Saville to testitfy before a sub-committee investigating \"British agents operating in the film industry.\" In the modern article, Saville claims that he directed parts of the film; however, another modern source, that includes interviews with James Stewart, Robert Stack and Gene Reynolds, indicates that those actors refute Saville's claim that he worked as a director on the film. Modern sources credit Henry S. Noerdlinger as technical director and Bronislau Kaper with additional music for the film.
