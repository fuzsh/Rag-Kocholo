        "text": "Back in 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president, Pamela Rose was “so scared and shocked about what was going to happen to women’s rights and everything else,” she did what’s she’d done for decades during difficult times.\n\nShe turned to music.\n\nNot just any music, but the blues and the women who brought the heartfelt songs of the South into mainstream American consciousness: Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and so many others who never got the recognition they deserved.\n\n“When you see how much these women went through to rise above what was really pretty much a real dead-end life, see how scared they must have been, but also how resilient they were, it imparts joy and empowerment,” Rose said.\n\nA veteran of Bay Area stages (Rose sang with the ZaSu Pitts Memorial Orchestra in the 1980s), she channeled her emotions into a theatrical concert honoring American blueswomen.\n\n“Blues Is a Woman: From Ma Rainey to Bonnie Raitt,” coming to the Sebastiani Theatre Friday, traces the roots of the blues to West Africa, through slavery and Jim Crow oppression to the women’s movement of the 1970s and ultimately to the 21st century.\n\nThe all-women band includes virtuoso guitarist and singer Pat Wilder, bassist Ruth Davies, drummer Daria Johnson, Kristen Strom on saxophone and pianist and musical director Tammy Hall.\n\nThe Sonoma performance is part of the Sonoma Valley Music Festival, a fundraiser for Music in Place, which launched during the pandemic to help support musicians and bring culturally relevant performances to local communities.\n\nRose found community through blues music, and the joy that all the band members feel is clearly evident during every performance.\n\n“We all love doing the show, and we love hanging out together,” she said. “We’re very good friends. It’s really fun for us.”\n\nWhile the 90-minute, one-act show is exuberantly entertaining, Rose and her band are on a mission.\n\n“The intent of this show is to correct a sort of cultural amnesia, that women in blues are an aberration,” she said. “It was women who powered the popularity of the blues by being the first recording and stage superstars.”\n\nThe “incredible voice these women gave us helped shape, in large part, how we feel about ourselves today,” she said.\n\n“These women seemed fearless, independent, sexually free, resilient. ... Blues speak of rapture, despair, heartache, but I think there is a special fiery joy and power when a woman tells that story.”\n\n“Blues Is a Woman” is stitched together by a mysterious muse, “this mystical woman who ... inspires different people,” Rose said.\n\nAlthough Rose had an earlier show called “Wild Women of Song: Great Gal Composers of the Jazz Era,” she said, “I’ve always loved blues and started out as a blues singer.”\n\nGrowing up during the 1960s, she heard the British blues of the Animals and the Rolling Stones, “then followed that tide back to Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf and then went back to Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey and those really early women.”\n\nHer love of the blues is rooted in “the urgency and unvarnished nature of that music. It’s simple, but so direct and so real, that it has always moved me.”\n\nRose wants people to understand that superstars such as Elvis Presley were inspired by the gritty blues of women musicians such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe. Chuck Berry, she said, was by “his own admission, one long Sister Rosetta Tharpe imitation.”\n\nPart of Rose’s goal is to shine a light on lesser-known musicians, such as Ida Cox, a blues singer and vaudeville performer, who recorded “Wild Women Don’t Have the Blues” in 1923 and was known as “The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues.”\n\nAs passionate as she is about the blues, Rose recognized, “that because I’m a white woman, it really wasn’t my story to tell,” and that she “needed to do it in a very different way.”\n\nRose put together an ensemble cast of Black and white members and they developed the show together.\n\n“We had some lively discussions about cultural appropriation,” she said, for example about whether to include the music of Sophie Tucker, a white Jewish blues singer and star of the 1920s and beyond.\n\nRose noted that Tucker stood up for Black musicians. “She would champion certain artists” to come and play venues, such as Miami Beach’s Fontainebleau, Rose said.\n\n“People would be picketing because they didn’t want to see Black artists there like Josephine Baker, who wanted to come. And (Tucker) had a lot of power, so she strong-armed some of these club owners, saying, ‘You’ve got to let them in; they are the legitimate deal, and we’re just imitating them.’”\n\nThe “Blues Is a Woman” cast share other fascinating stories about blueswomen, just enough to intrigue the audience.\n\nThe hope, Rose said, is to “have people be more curious, to go home and do some of their own research and exploration.”\n\nRose is continually amazed that so many early American blueswomen — who sang so powerfully about freedom and not suffering in silence — were teenagers.\n\nThe songs were “mostly written by very young Black women coming out of the Southern Delta,” Rose said. “They were 15 and 16 years old. And they’re writing these fierce, independent songs. That became what every blueswoman sang about, and that message changed audiences.”\n\nAnother force highlighted in “Blues Is a Woman” is Ruth Brown, who sold so many records for Atlantic Records that the company became known as “the house that Ruth built.” Yet Brown was working as a dishwasher and living hand to mouth.\n\nBrown took on Atlantic and won a 20-year legal battle to get record companies to pay overdue royalties to her and many of her fellow musicians.\n\n“So she’s a big hero in our show,” Rose said.\n\nBy the close of “Blues Is a Woman,” Rose hopes audience members no longer instantly think of the blues as “a man and his guitar,” that they understand it was courageous women who turned the music into “America’s most enduring art form.”\n\n”I want to reclaim this as women’s music and celebrate not only the evolution of the blues, but the evolution of women in the blues,” Rose said. “I think it’s a profound story.”\n\nMichael Shapiro writes about the performing arts and is author of “The Creative Spark,” www.michaelshapiro.net."
