        "text": "Grammy-nominated and BMI “Million-Air” award-winning singer-songwriter Pam Rose conveys the sounds of life’s heavenly qualities in the empowering ten-track project, Sacred Song. Dropping on all major streaming platforms on Friday, October 8, fans can pre-order the release on iTunes by clicking HERE.\n\n“Sacred Song was not intended to be a religious album. And, although I’ve been on a spiritual journey for the better part of my life, I don’t consider myself a religious person, in the conventional sense of the word.” says Pam. “But I’ve always been fascinated about how people connect with whatever it is that they consider ‘bigger than themselves,’ and with how faith and inspiration help so many of us get through the trials and tribulations of being human.”\n\nGrieving the loss of nine loved ones over two and a half years, this multifaceted tunesmith banded together with writers Cathy Majeski (Reba McEntire, Wynonna Judd, Ricochet, Lorrie Morgan), Melissa Manchester, and Terry Burns, all of whom experienced losses in their lives, to start the idea for this project. Empowered by this common thread tying them together, Pam began pairing herself with some of the industry’s most celebrated songwriters. Each track delicately unravels the heavenly qualities of our uniquely human journeys and grounding itself in the belief that music possesses the ability to heal and comfort.\n\nAudiences around the globe and at film festivals are already being impacted. The track, So Many Angels, is featured in the gripping documentary “Invisible,” which captured the audience award for “Best Documentary” at the Frameline San Francisco International LGBTQ Film Festival. In addition, as a sneak peek gift to the community during the pandemic, the soft launch of Pam’s contemporary rendition of Schubert’s “Ave Maria” has landed over 11,000 views on YouTube.\n\nFull details on the project are below:\n\nAve Maria (Franz Schubert)\n\nBetween The Worlds (Terry Burns, Cathy Majeski, Pam Rose)\n\nForevermore (Pam Rose, Kristen Wilkinson)\n\nSo Many Angels (Terry Burns, Cathy Majeski, Pam Rose)\n\nThe Offering (Catt Gravitt, Gerald O’Brien, Pam Rose)\n\nHoly Child (Terry Burns, Cathy Majeski, Pam Rose)\n\nThe Everlasting (Chuck Canon, Chuck Jones, Pam Rose)\n\nEverything (Terry Burns, Cathy Majeski, Pam Rose)\n\nOne Flesh to Wound (Chuck Jones, Pam Rose\n\nStill Myself (Melissa Manchester, Pam Rose)\n\nThe songwriter has collaborated with prolific industry veterans including, Art Garfunkel, Neil Young, Randy Sharp (Clay Walker, Patty Loveless, Reba McEntire, Dixie Chicks), Emmylou Harris, and more. She has also made appearances on the hit records “How Do I Live” by LeAnn Rimes and “Independence Day” with Martina McBride. With two Grammy nominations, this social justice activist, LGBTQ performer, and avant-garde songstress hopes to uplift fans worldwide with her spiritually interrogative upcoming album, Sacred Song.\n\nKeep in touch with Pam Rose by visiting the following links:\n\nWebsite: pamrosemusic.com\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/pamrosemusic\n\nYouTube: youtube.com/channel/PamRose\n\nAbout Pam Rose\n\nPam Rose is a Chattanooga, Tennessee native, currently residing in Music City. In her adolescence, she relocated to Atlanta, then to the East Coast of Florida, where she spent her formative years. Rose enrolled at Florida State University and studied music theory, with a principal focus in voice and classical guitar. She eventually returned to Atlanta to study under her mentor and long-time friend of Ramsey Lewis, jazz musician Paul Mitchell.\n\nWith the launch of her harmonic duo Kennedy Rose with Mary Ann Kennedy, Rose propelled through the industry to achieve two Grammy nominations for Song of the Year – “I’ll Still Be Loving You” (Restless Heart) and once again for “Ring On Her Finger, Time On Her Hands” (Lee Greenwood). The duo also won over the ears of international megastar Sting, who praised them for their “uncategorizable music.” While signed to Sting’s private label Pangaea Records, they completed two acclaimed studio albums. Her undeniable songwriting talent has landed her numerous cuts by Art Garfunkel, Peter Cetera, Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Crystal Gayle, Patty Loveless, Lee Greenwood, Restless Heart, Carlene Carter, and more. Hits like the aforementioned pair that secured the Grammy nominations alongside staples like “Safe In the Arms of Love” and “You Will” would rack up six BMI “Million-Air” Awards. Rose also achieved the BMI Pop Award for two consecutive years for Restless Heart’s “I’ll Still Be Loving You.” Her most prominent live performances include The Nobel Peace Prize Presentation, President Bill Clinton’s presidential inauguration ceremony and “Interdependence Day Think Tank and Peace Conferences” in the Los Angeles, Mexico City, Istanbul, and Berlin.\n\nPam has previously released two self-penned albums in addition to the two releases under Kennedy Rose. On the small screen, this LGBTQ performer has been featured on PBS TV shows, “Tommy Emmanuel & Friends,” “Austin City Limits,” and NBC’s “Dolly Parton 50th Anniversary.” Presently, Pam’s forthcoming album, Sacred Song, has already garnered exposure in a documentary currently on the festival circuit titled Invisible. Rose is also featured in the documentary. Sacred Song will feature the songwriter’s signature heartening lyrics and powerhouse vocals, premiering to all online retailers on Friday, October 8. Below you will find praise from prominent peers in the music industry:\n\n“On Pam Rose’s exquisite new album Sacred Song, she tells us ‘there are angels everywhere’. Whether you believe that or not, it is certainly true she has the voice of one, and sometimes that is enough”\n\n– Emmylou Harris (Fourteen Time Grammy Award Winner / Country Music Hall of Famer)\n\n“Pam Rose makes room to go deep when she writes. Pam Rose is a sculptor of songs. I am honored to have been one of her many collaborators”\n\n– Melissa Manchester (Grammy Award Winner / NARAS Governor’s Award Recipient)\n\n“Pam Rose was already well respected in Nashville when I was just starting out. I looked up to her as a consummate writer, musician, and vocalist. Her voice moves me as much now as it ever did. I’m sure that Sacred Song will be a balm for whoever hears it in these very trying times.”\n\n– Pam Tillis (Grammy Award Winner / CMA Female Vocalist of the Year)\n\n“Pam writes from real life, from the joy and pain that all of us can relate to. Her songs are deep and her soul comes shining through like an early morning sunrise. Listen with your heart and feel the healing that comes from her music. Oh, and she’s one hell of a singer.”\n\n– Tommy Emmanuel (Australian Master Guitarist / 2 time Grammy Nominee)"
