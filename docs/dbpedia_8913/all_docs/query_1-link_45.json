        "text": "Our family mourns the passing of Pamela Rose Smith, who gained her wings and joined our Heavenly Father on November 24th, 2020. Born in Albion, New York on April 4th, 1960, Pam was the fourth child of Charles and Johnnie Mae Smith.\n\nPam throughout her life would often find employment helping others and loved working with children at a few daycare centers in Batavia, New York. In search of more diverse career opportunities, Pam moved with her children to Akron, Ohio in the summer of 1997. Raising them on her own, Pam worked tirelessly as a state tested caregiver in a few nursing facilities. After purchasing a large home on her own, Pam enjoyed decorating, renovating, and gardening. An avid reader, every week Pam would dive into a different mystery book.\n\nComing from a large family, Pamela is survived by daughter, Ebony Yolanda (Brandon): son, Malcolm Mandela; grandson, Ishmael Kashmir and her siblings: Veronica, Charles Jr., (Penny), Robert, David (Charlese), and Debra Smith and a whole host of nieces, nephews, cousins, an aunt, uncle, and many friends.\n\nAt the request of Pam’s children, no services will be held at this time, but a Celebration of Life will be announced at a later date to be determined. They’d also like to extend extra gratitude to David and Charlese Smith."
