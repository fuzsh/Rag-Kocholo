        "text": "Pamela Rose is known for representing her clients fearlessly and with unwavering dedication and commitment. She has extensive experience in all areas of criminal law, animal welfare and public order law.\n\nPamela’s criminal practice and experience includes all ranges of violent offences, drugs, firearms and sexual offences. Pamela’s practice has included the full spectrum of cases from trials, abuse of process submissions, breach of orders, issues as to costs and of confiscation proceedings, applications to the High Court by way of case stated or Judicial Review and appeals to the Crown Court and Court of Appeal.Pamela believes in making justice accessible for all from representation in the Court of Appeal to undertaking work in the Magistrates’ Court where some allegations preclude jury trial or where a client chooses not to elect trial by jury.\n\nPamela’s extensive and specialist experience in animal welfare and dogs cases ranges from representing protesters against various animal cruelty sports, including fox hunting before it became unlawful, to representing dog owners or their keepers since the introduction of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Her practice in dog cases has resulted in many decisions in the Court of Appeal and High Court. Her instructions have included a case where death was caused by a number of dogs and necessitated cross examination regarding teeth marks to identify which dog caused the injury and her client’s dog was found not to be responsible based upon forensic and evidential facts.\n\nPamela has significant experience in public order law and offences arising out of protests, having represented miners during the 1980s, anti BNP protesters, anti-poll tax cases and anti war protestors."
