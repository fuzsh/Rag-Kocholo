        "text": "About Wild Women of Song (2009):\n\n\"She brings to light many of the songs of the 20's, 30's and 40's written by women. (\"Wild Women of Song\") ...a great CD, and great session...filled with life and fun.\" - KCSM, Melanie Berzon\n\n\"By the third song I was hooked. Your performance of songs written by women such as \"I Don't Know About You\" by Peggy Lee, \"A Fine Romance\" by Dorothy Fields, and \"Down Hearted Blues\" by Alberta Hunter thrilled me. I recommend my readers purchase two copies; .If they wear out the first one, they will have a back up copy'.- I Dig Jazz: Charles Latimer's Jazz Journal\n\n\"You never know where that tinkering is going to come from that separates good from great, but when it comes, it's unmistakable. Bay area jazz vocal mainstay immersed herself in the works of jazz era women composers and something has really clicked . Rose... really plants the flag, and it just takes off from there. The band is on point and performance is spot on ... a stone cold killer that jazz vocal fans shouldn't miss. Simple as that\". - www.midwestrecord.com\n\nBuy now!\n\nAbout Just for a Thrill (2006):\n\n\"Song after song features Rose at her finest. Intimate, at times hushed, deepy romantic...these are fully absorbed pearls and phrasings of a singer and composer who now knows she needs no improvement. And the band can't be beat!\" -- Bruce Kelley, Editor, San Francisco Magazine\n\n\"This Bay Area singer/songwriter has hit her stride...\" -- Paul Liberatore, Marin Independent Journal\n\n\"In Pamela Rose's latest, we are treated to sultry seductive tracks that deftly weave a tapestry of bluesy jazz...a musician who's at the height of her powers.\" -- Miles Forman, SF Station\n\nBuy now!\n\nAbout You Could Have it All (2001): An all original soul-jazz session, featured on NPR's All Things Considered\n\n\"Rose delivers the goods, blending her love of music with a romantic sensibility to create one fine and soulful jazz disc. Each track is absolutely true to the song. Sassy, saucy...stellar!\" -- Ben Fong Torres, Gavin Report\n\n\"Intelligent, hip songs for grownups...penetratingly soulful\" -- Paul Libertore, Marin IJ\n\n\"Pamela Rose has a sound as black and soulful as her hair is fiery red.\" -- BAM Magazine\n\nBuy now!\n\nAbout Every Time I'm With You (1996)\n\n\"She sings with a confident, soul drenched style, downright sassy, with attitude to spare\" -- Jazz Now Magazine (cover story)\n\nBuy now!\n\nAbout On the Jazzy Side of Blue (1992):\n\n\"Pamela Rose & The Nate Ginsberg Trio...a pleasure in every regard...old chestnuts from early Nat King Cole and Sinatra to Cab Calloway and Joe Turner played to perfection.\" -- David Plotnikoff, San Jose Mercury News\n\n\"Lots of sexy, soulful swing...with a dash of Dinah Washington thrown in...the Jazz crowd should pay attention to Pamela Rose!\" -- Phil Elwood, San Francisco Examiner"
