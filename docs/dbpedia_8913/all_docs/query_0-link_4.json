She was a pioneer working head-to-head with ‘the boys who make the noise on the 16th Avenue’ carving her own niche and earning both respect and formidable success. PLA is honored to have her on our roster!”\n\n“I’ll never forget where I was when my lifetime writing and duo partner Mary Ann Kennedy played a me cassette tape of an unknown artist from Oklahoma that Pam Lewis was considering managing,” recalls Pam Rose. “Pam did say ‘yes’ and that artist was none other than Garth Brooks. Ever since then, I have known her instincts to be impeccable. I’m so pleased to be working with Pam, Mark and PLA to escort my newest project into the world. I really look forward to this exciting collaboration and a successful launch to Sacred Song.”\n\nPrior to the launch of her solo career, the Chattanooga native first gained notoriety in the internationally acclaimed duo, Kennedy Rose, with singer/songwriter Mary Ann Kennedy.
