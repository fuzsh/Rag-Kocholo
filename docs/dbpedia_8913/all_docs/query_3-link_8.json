        "text": "Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Pam Rose is releasing a new ten-track project, Sacred Song, on all major streaming platforms on Friday, Oct. 8.\n\nThe impetus for the new project was a season of grief as Rose lost nine loved ones over two and a half years. She banded together with writers Cathy Majeski, Melissa Manchester, and Terry Burns–all of whom experienced losses in their lives–to initiate the project. Empowered by this common thread, Rose began pairing herself with some of the industry’s most celebrated songwriters to create Sacred Song.\n\n“Sacred Song was not intended to be a religious album. And, although I’ve been on a spiritual journey for the better part of my life, I don’t consider myself a religious person, in the conventional sense of the word.” says Rose. “But, I’ve always been fascinated about how people connect with whatever it is that they consider ‘bigger than themselves,’ and with how faith and inspiration help so many of us get through the trials and tribulations of being human.”\n\nThroughout her career, Rose has collaborated with industry veterans, including Art Garfunkel, Neil Young, Randy Sharp, Emmylou Harris, and more."
