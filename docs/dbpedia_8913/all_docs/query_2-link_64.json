        "text": "As senior vice president of key partnerships, Ashley Crawford, together with her team, leads Covenant House International’s strategic partnerships with companies and private foundations to advance our mission to help young people overcome homelessness.\n\nAshley came to CHI in 2009, working in direct marketing. Inspired by the Covenant House culture, she went on to play a critical role in launching our peer-to-peer movement, Sleep Out. In 2015, Ashley led the development of CHI's first corporate partnerships unit, resulting in new opportunities for young people and new funding for programs.\n\nPrior to Covenant House, Ashley served two years with City Year New York, where she helped develop and implement a service learning and leadership program for middle school students in Long Island City, New York.\n\nAshley holds a bachelor’s degree in human resource management from Michigan State University and an MPA in public and nonprofit management and policy from New York University.\n\nWhen Ashley is not at Covenant House, you can find her with her husband and two daughters (likely on the lakes or slopes!) in Michigan, where they reside.\n\nPrior to joining Covenant House International in February 2023, Bill served as the CEO of Covenant House California since 2014, leading the site to quadruple in size in those eight years. Bill’s passion for working with youth came from his parents, who have been foster parents for over 30 years and have adopted 8 of his 11 siblings through the child welfare system.\n\nBill began his career doing street outreach, residential care, and therapy in Chicago. He subsequently spent 13 years with the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services, where he helped reduce the number of children in out-of-home care by close to 75% through an emphasis on risk mitigation, family and community support, and faith-based engagement. In 2010, Bill became the executive director at Olive Crest’s Southern California operations overseeing the agency’s foster care, adoption, group home, transitional living, mental health services, and family support operations.\n\nBill has a bachelor's in business administration and finance from Taylor University and a master's of social work from Loyola University in Chicago. Bill lives in California with his wife and two children and he is an avid Philadelphia sports fan.\n\nCarlette Mack started her career at Covenant House Alaska as an intern 25 years ago. She is a second-generation Covenant House employee; her mother worked at Covenant House Alaska as a case manager for 13 years. Carlette's passion and dedication for serving youth led her to positions such as Rights of Passage program coordinator, chief operating officer, and, at Covenant House Washington, director of external affairs. In 2017, Carlette served as interim executive director of Covenant House Illinois, helping to establish Covenant House’s then newest site, in Chicago.\n\nCarlette is a trained clinical therapist primarily focused on therapy with children and teens. She received her bachelor’s degree in psychology and her master’s in counseling psychology, both, from Alaska Pacific University. Carlette is recognized for innovative program development and implementation, strategic planning, collaboration with local partners, and for her management and leadership skills. She has a strong sense of integrity and a passion for ensuring the well-being and quality of life of young people experiencing homelessness.\n\nCarolyn joined Covenant House International in April 2023 as senior vice president for Latin America. Previously, she worked for Lutheran World Relief for 14 years, including 10 years as senior regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. Carolyn led the organization's strategic direction and programming in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, and Haiti. Her regional portfolio included economic development, climate change adaptation, gender and youth empowerment, agri-enterprise development, and emergency response.\n\nCarolyn has a dual master's in Latin America Studies and Public Affairs from the University of Texas at Austin and a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies from Vassar College. She was named a 2018 Bowe Fellow by the World Trade Center Institute. Carolyn is fluent in Spanish and French and has lived and traveled throughout Latin America. She currently lives in Baltimore, MD, with her Peruvian husband, her creative 13-year-old, and her 2 chunky dogs.\n\nCourtney Underwood joined Covenant House International in 2023. Prior to joining CHI, she served as chief human resources officer at By the Hand Club for Kids, an afterschool program in Chicago, where she led recruitment, retention, employee engagement, benefits management, training, and compliance.\n\nA proud Chicago native, Courtney graduated from DePaul University. She is an award-winning thought leader, noted public speaker, published author, SHRM senior certified professional, and a Gallup-certified strengths coach. Before serving at By the Hand, she founded a management consulting firm, Kassar Consulting. After serving domestic and international clients across various industries, Courtney knew she had to bring the proven strategies she created to heart-centered organizations with purpose.\n\nCourtney has over 21 years’ experience in human resources and leadership development. In her role as senior vice president of people and culture, she oversees all aspects of the employee experience, including building strong collaboration among CHI employees and at our affiliates.\n\nOutside her professional commitments, Courtney spends quality time with her family, mentors youth, and travels extensively.\n\nDaniel Karp joined the staff of Covenant House International in 2019. For nearly 20 years, he has partnered with domestic and international agencies to help save lives, lift communities out of poverty, promote human rights and the arts, and safeguard health.\n\nDaniel comes to Covenant House from the USO, where, as vice president for direct response, he helped connect the men and women of the U.S. armed forces to family, home, and country throughout their service. With a strong foundation and personal commitment to social justice, Daniel joins Covenant House to be part of an organization that addresses the immediate and longer-term needs of young people experiencing homelessness. He envisions a world where no child is without a home.\n\nDaniel grew up in Connecticut. He and his wife have two children.\n\nEdda Santiago joined Covenant House International in 2021 and assumed her current post in 2024. She provides counsel on legal matters, including contracts, employment law, governance, planned giving, and intellectual property, and legal support for CHI’s efforts to build and maintain affordable housing for youth.\n\nEdda has nearly a decade of legal experience. She began her career at an international law firm, where she advised on the acquisition and financing of commercial properties. She has advised tax-exempt organizations on real estate matters, counseled clients on estate planning and tax matters, and, at The Legal Aid Society, defended low-income New Yorkers facing eviction.\n\nEdda earned her J.D. from St. John’s University School of Law, where she was associate managing editor of the New York Real Property Law Journal. She completed an advanced professional certificate in taxation from NYU School of Law, earned a bachelor’s in political science from Florida International University, and completed graduate work at American University’s School of International Service.\n\nEdda is fluent in Spanish and serves on the board of the Hispanic National Bar Association VIA Fund.\n\nA graduate of Seton Hall University, Gina Butler-VonDerHeide began her career as a real estate paralegal at Sills Cummis in Newark, New Jersey. During her tenure at the firm, she acquired her master’s degree in public administration at Rutgers University, where a referral from a professor to Covenant House changed her life. Gina made a phone call to inquire about an internship she needed to complete her degree and never looked back!\n\nGina started at Covenant House New Jersey in 2008 as a development manager, learning the ropes of fundraising and strategic planning. She found herself inspired and motivated then by both the staff and youth she worked with, and she still does. In 2011, Gina had the opportunity to lead an initiative called peer-to-peer fundraising at Covenant House International. Then, in 2018, after years of countless Sleep Outs and Home Team races, she moved into the role of senior vice president for development operations.
