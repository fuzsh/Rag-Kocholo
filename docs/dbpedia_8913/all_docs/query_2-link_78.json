        "text": "Cybill Shepherd, James Brolin and Pam Grier have signed on to star in Rose, written and directed by Rod McCall, which starts shooting this month in New Mexico.\n\nThe dramatic comedy follows Rose (Shepherd), a recently disabled and widowed woman with a short time to live, taking a solo road trip through the “land of enchantment” in an effort to reconcile with her estranged son and make her peace with life. Along the way, she fends off surly predators, makes new friends, and finds love.\n\nShepherd is well known for her early work in The Last Picture Show and The Heartbreak Kid. She went on to an award-winning TV career with shows like Moonlighting and Cybill. Brolin currently stars as the patriarch in CBS’s Life In Pieces which is in its second season. His notable film credits include Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Traffic directed by Stephen Soderbergh. Grier is perhaps best known for starring in 70s blaxploitation films like Coffy, and Foxy Brown. She also played the title role in Quentin Tarantino’s Jackie Brown.\n\nMcCall past films include Paper Hearts starring Brolin, and Lewis & Clark & George with Rose McGowan. Executive producers are J. Todd Harris and Eric A. Williams."
