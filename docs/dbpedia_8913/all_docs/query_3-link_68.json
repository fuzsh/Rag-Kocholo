        "text": "Teff Ayral is a multi-talented individual who has spent her entire life dancing and playing music. Her love for dance started at the age of 4 when she began taking ballet and tap classes. Since then, she has explored various dance forms including hula, tahitian, salsa, flamenco and belly dance. Her dedication and hard work as a student of dance earned her the opportunity to study under Angelica Nemeth while living in Los Angeles for nine years.\n\nIn addition to her passion for dance, Teff was a competitive gymnast for many years. Her athletic prowess, combined with her love for dance, has given her a unique perspective on movement and performance.\n\nTeff’s commitment to supporting local non-profit organizations is a reflection of her dedication to making a positive impact in her community. She serves as a project management institute mentor and a toastmaster, using her skills to uplift and coach others.\n\nTeff works as a consultant, where her expertise in project management and her passion for community-building are put to good use. She is also on the board of directors for Rhythmix Cultural Works, where she volunteers at their events and can often be found behind the snack bar, serving up delicious treats and chatting with patrons.\n\nTeff Ayral is a true force of nature, driven by her passion for dance, music, community, and giving back. Her commitment to excellence in all aspects of her life is an inspiration to all who know her.\n\nLynda Gutierrez moved from Colombia to Alameda at the age of 5. The culture shock was intense at times, but connecting to the creativity and discipline of dance at a local dance studio really helped her have an outlet from bullying and have a way to express herself in ways that didn’t depend on spoken word.\n\nLynda earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance and Choreography at UC Santa Barbara. She has performed for various choreographers and companies in the Bay Area, from modern to folkloric dance. Lynda has also worked offstage in administrative, management, and marketing positions for local dance companies. With the birth of her son, Lynda shifted her work from dance to fitness.\n\nToday, Lynda runs her independent business as a fitness instructor, accountability wellness coach, and business mentor to others who work in the fitness industry. Rhythmix holds a very special place in Lynda’s heart as it is the place where she first started teaching a decade ago! It’s been a wonderful journey contributing in all ways possible to all the great work happening at RCW. If you ever ask Lynda about Rhythmix, you’ll probably hear about the incredible events offered…and how she hopes to be like Janet and Bean when she grows up.\n\nYo Arms Too Short to Box With Gawd, 2008\n\nOil on linen, panel, 36×60\n\nwww.nyamebrown.com\n\n“This work explores scenes and characters form my allegory New Black Myths. I articulate my personal history and African Diaspora-multi-threaded history, not precluding the Western cannon of art, locating myself in art history strategically, deploying it anachronistically, and creating new connections and associations. My storytelling functions culturally, the tradition calls for expanding the idiom through improvisation, riffing and rupturing. Within hip-hop and the blues there is use of allegory, metaphor and the modernist persona, like Kool Keith aka Dr. Octagon, Howlin Wolf and Sir Nose of Parliament Funkadelic. Classic literature and hip hop share the trait of veering between folk and the epic instantaneously, from line to line – even within a single line. This is how I build my narratives – like scaffolding around the art history of painting, the cultural history of hip-hop and my personal history. The goal of my work is to make new Black myths and lore that are born of tradition, yet transcend pre-existing archetypes that diminish the Black-imagination.”\n\nNyame O. Brown was born in San Francisco and lives in Oakland. Brown received his BFA from The Art Institute of Chicago (1993), and MFA from Yale school of Art and Architecture (1997). He has been in residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts, the Joan Mitchell Center in New Orleans, Black Artist Retreat, and the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts. While in Omaha Nyame milled the dirt from the iconic African American social activist Malcolm X. He was in the Frequency exhibition at the Studio Museum of Harlem (2006) and is a recipient of the Joan Mitchell Painters and Sculptors grant (2003). His solo show, Classroom in Neveryon, exhibited in 2016 at the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco.\n\nSometimes a tree grows in Brooklyn and sometimes a rose grows through the concrete sidewalk and sometimes an artist flourishes in the darkest terrain and a friendship begins between very different people who accidentally meet in an art class in Birmingham, Alabama and lasts almost a lifetime. I was a student at the University of Alabama in Birmingham when I signed up for a painting class under art teacher Martha Johnson. Another student named Jessica also signed up for the class. I had just moved back to Birmingham with my then husband, Tancan Ayral, and our new born baby, Teff. The world seemed new and I vowed to take some classes while working a full time job. I have been an artist ever since.\n\nLast year my daughter invited me to Rhythmix to participate in Art Jam while she took drumming classes. I met a great group of people and when the pandemic struck, I continued with the group to go to Sip N Sketch. I enjoy the class and Bill Jeng is a great artist and teacher. He demonstrates many different techniques and we have painted a variety of subjects. Everyone has a good time, we share our art, our lives and we have a creative community. ayralartandpoetry.weebly.com\n\nFirst off, I would like to thank Ginny Parsons and Rhythmix Cultural Works for this opportunity to exhibit recent paintings in such a supportive milieu. They have generously opened their vibrant artistic community’s doors to a new resident and he is wholeheartedly revitalized by it. Although I lived in San Francisco from 1986 to 2006 I did not have chance to explore Alameda as I might have, so my return to the “familiar” has been amazingly brand new.\n\nThere’s nothing like a global pandemic to reinforce any artist’s sense of retrospection, and in my case it comes hard upon the heels of Hurricane Irma’s furious destruction of my studio space in the Florida Keys in 2017. Returning to the Bay Area was bittersweet as my newly rekindled loving relationship took root here in Alameda, as the fires filled the air with acrid smoke and we watched so many people seek refuge from a different catastrophe.\n\nThe Keys and Key West are brimming with the kind of inspiration that keeps me afloat.\n\n(okay, no more nautical descriptors.) I have always been drawn to the power of water and its transforming and healing characteristics. So it was that I was drawn to that part of the world to paint, where one can often mistake the horizon lines, where light dances above and below and around you and the colors keep shifting throughout the day. Where stepping into the shallows and snorkeling to the reef will reveal countless mysteries. And where one more significantly notices that the waters do not recede as they used to, where the ground is losing ground, and the king tides will soon reign unchecked.\n\nGinny Parsons sees that same thing happening here as she circumnavigates in her kayak, and she inspires me in her kinship of vision. I haven’t been on the water lately but I walk everywhere and am inspired by the lagoons and vistas from South Shore and the wetland areas and the city skylines. My aesthetic sensibility is rooted in capturing my emotional responses to what I see. Here, let me cut and paste from an earlier statement which still rings true:\n\n“The plasticity of resin as a painting medium has afforded me the opportunity to paint through the surface of nature, which as my primary source of inspiration in these recent works becomes the captured moment of energy-infused visual phenomena. Rather than paint the object, I paint the emotional response created within me by that-which-appears-before-my-eyes.”\n\nWorking in this medium since the ‘90s, I constantly discover new ways of portraying things that other mediums have never satisfied me with: the color saturation, resin’s ability to overlay imagery, the ways it can be carved, sculpted, polished, and manipulated. I have found a material that allows me to paint what I need to see, which is often through the assumed object or surface to the way it has been created for me to observe it. To sum it up: “why is this so beautiful, and how can I paint it?”\n\nSo our exhibition’s theme of Immersion is one of Water, but is also one of Culture and one of Society and of Friendship and mutual Admiration and Support and hopefully one of Healing the planet upon which we continue to survive.\n\nThis year sucks. My dad died and the pandemic hit. But my mom taught me to “look for the good,” so I’ve been kayaking every day and making art using everything from seaweed to leftover Crisco.\n\nThe large water paintings with peanut butter and Borax were started before the virus hit. I added cardboard cutouts that represent infection, since the shapes rub against the surface and some become greasy while others stay healthy and pristine. (Shout out to my neighbors Heidi Prutton for the cutouts and Chris Fetzer for the Crisco.)\n\nI’ve also been making landscapes of San Leandro Bay painted on chunks of old drop cloths. I enjoy using leftovers and I’m worried about global warming.\n\nI’ve been picking up trash from the Bay and when I find a ball, I wrap it with seaweed. As sea levels rise, Alameda will need to adapt and Josie Iselin’s book “The Curious World of Seaweed” has been teaching me about the mysteries of seaweed and their ability to survive.\n\nFinally, I’ve been painting watercolors of the natural world of Alameda because that is where I find solace. If I had to be sheltered in place, there’s nowhere I’d rather be.\n\nI dedicate this exhibit to Colin Brooks Morris (7) who I’ve seen nearly every day since Covid-19. As I pull my kayak past his house, he pops out to say hello. As I sign off with “have a good day,” his reply is, “it already is a great day, Ginny, all my days are awesome.” If we adopt Colin’s attitude, we’ll get through this pandemic with a greater appreciation for nature and the value of staying close to home and family.\n\nPresented by artpaul cartier\n\nSea of Stories, 20-minute audio loop\n\nThe podcasts you hear in this collection were written and recorded by San Francisco youth, ages 12-18, during field trips to 826 Valencia’s Tenderloin Center. 826 Valencia is a nonprofit dedicated to supporting under-resourced students with their writing skills, developing their confidence as writers and amplifying their powerful voices. Many of our students are recent immigrants or first-generation Americans. With the support of volunteer tutors, students wrote podcasts exploring the elements that influence their identities and beliefs. Vibrant and varied, their podcasts are grounded in reflection on culture, community, challenge and celebration. In many, students describe the diverse places they are “from.” They are from “my home back in Kuwait, where the people were chargers with energizing attitudes”; from “rice that’s left over in your bowl”; from “Canada, Korea, and thoughts passed down for generations”; from “Narnia and Hogwarts”; from “music spiraling through my bones.” These brief sonic journeys showcase the writers’ backgrounds and origins, while pointing to the inspiring places they’re headed.\n\nartpaul cartier is a photographer and artist who compiled and presented this installation. He recounts: “As I have been volunteering as a recorder with 826 Valencia Tenderloin podcast project I have been struck by the beauty of students’ writing and performances in this medium. As many of the students come from the San Francisco Unified School District, there is a wide variety of perspectives on topics ranging from food and sports to learning English and relating stories of immigration – and their after-effects. Culled from hundreds of podcasts taken over the last three years, this presentation assembles a loop of a selection of the students’ stories and poems.”\n\nCrossing the Aegean, 2019\n\nOil on canvas, 48×36\n\n“My current series, 68.5 Million, follows the river of tears from the millions of forcibly displaced people around the world. My family left Russia long ago and were given an opportunity to make a new home, strive and succeed in safety. This is not the world we live in now. I refuse to look away from the suffering that rips our world apart. It motivates every mark I make. The paintings are windows into the unthinkable and unseen stories of innocent people. This series bears witness to the humans, all of whom could be us, who are being told to disappear. Where can they go? For a moment they can rest across my canvas, lost and found, defined and undefined. It’s time to notice.”\n\nJennifer Berkowitz worked for many years as a creative director and designer of motion graphics for television and film. She created award-winning productions and taught at the University of California, Los Angeles before she decided to dive into a submersive exploration of painting. The psychological and emotional challenges of life fuel her work, which follows a thoughtful and introspective thread. Her paintings are primarily figurative, exploring dislocation, rites of passage and coming of age. Jennifer lives and works in San Francisco, where she is actively involved with the homeless community — another displaced population.\n\nIndigenousness, 2019\n\nRice paper, bees wax on panel, 20×16\n\n“I am interested in creating visual language that is engaged in individual and collective identities and the history, culture, economies and geographies that they are tethered to. This piece is from a larger body of work that I call the Belonging series. Indigenousness is an identity portrait comprised of the countries and continents of my own heritage. The maps range from historical to satellite imagery and include “outdated” versions with countries that no longer exist or illustrate first nation territories in what would become the United States of America. It is a visual exploration of my interest in the instability of place in regard to notions of nativism and identity. The first nation peoples offer an understanding of identity as connected to seven generations before and seven generations forward. When I consider this in terms of the geography and nationalism of my own ancestry, it is more accurate to understand my indigenousness as a journey. A path that meanders through time and place with changing borders, political systems, names and dates that are determined by exploration, conquest, colonialism, opportunity, greed, benevolence, lust and love.”\n\nCynthia Brannvall is a California native of African American and Swedish descent. A multimedia artist and art historian, her artwork has been selected for juried group exhibitions in Berkeley, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, San Rafael, Palo Alto, San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles. She teaches Art History at various community colleges in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWebsite\n\nFree Will Is An Illusion, 2018\n\nArchival inkjet print, 37×25\n\nKacy Jung is a Taiwanese visual artist working with digital photography and ceramic sculpture. Throughout her art career, she investigates the construction and reassembles of identity during socialization, as well as the relationship between an individual and the current capitalist society. The subject intertwines with her immigrant experience and the anxiety of being part of the disappearing middle class. Her current works are a series of self-portraits and quirky sculptures of everyday objects such as mobile phones that are inspired by her struggles of living in a capitalist society. With this work she intends to intrigue the viewers’ own experience and internal dialogue: what is this system becoming now? What are the American dreams we believe?\n\nKacy’s works have been shown in galleries and museums internationally, including the United States and Taiwan. She is the recipient of the 2016 SFAI Harlan Jackson Diversity Scholarship, the 2018 SFAI nominees of Graduate Fellowship at Headlands Center for the Arts and the annual International Sculpture Center Student Award in contemporary sculpture. She received her MFA in photography at San Francisco Art Institute after an MS in biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area and practices her art at the Root Division Studios Program.\n\nThe Healing Garden of Asparagus, 2019\n\nDigital illustration, archival print on aluminum, 20×20\n\n“The Healing Garden of Asparagus” is inspired by The Herbal, a twelfth century manuscript from Andalusia, Spain. This piece evokes the memories of my childhood in the Southern city of Shiraz, Iran, known for its herbal medicine tradition. As a child I spent ample time shopping at the traditional drugstores in Shiraz with my grandmother who firmly believed in the healing power of herbal medicine for all kinds of minor ailments. The plants are designed after the original images from the manuscript and printed on metal medallions to evoke the Persian decorative tiles. The Healing Garden of Asparagus showcases an introspective representation of my early memories of connection to nature and personal place between the worlds of reality, science and imagination.”\n\nPantea Karimi is a multidisciplinary artist with an interest in the taxonomy of image-text relationships. She researches visual representations in medieval Persian and Arab and early modern European scientific manuscripts in five categories: mathematics, medicinal botany, anatomy, optics/astronomy and cartography. Karimi’s works collectively highlight the significance of visual elements in early science and invite the viewer to observe science and its history through the process of image making. Her fine arts have been exhibited in Iran, Algeria, Germany, Croatia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States. She is the recipient of the 2019 Arts and Cultural Exchange Grant in San Jose; the 2019 Silicon Valley Artist Laureates Award; the 2016-2017 Kala Fellowship Award; and the 2011 Multicultural Arts Leadership Initiative Fellowship. Pantea Karimi is an Adjunct Faculty at the College of San Mateo and maintains a studio in Cubberley Artist Studios in Palo Alto, California.\n\nSaddlebag (From When We All Got Along) Morocco, 2019 Archival acrylic ink, paint on canvas, 16×16\n\nThis image is from the town of Ait Ben Haddou, Morocco. Before the state of Israel was established, the town had an equal mix of Jews, Muslims and Christians all living peacefully together. After 1948 most of the Jews migrated to Israel. The saddlebag pictured is a relic from that time.\n\nLong time Bay Area Professor Emeritus (from CCA) Elizabeth Sher works in both 2 and 4D. Her films and artworks have garnered awards and been shown nationally, internationally and on TV (her films.) Her work focuses on women, art, healthy aging and the environment mixing digital and analog (handwork) modalities. Over the past decade her artwork has been inspired by residencies she has attended out of the country – most recently in Morocco.\n\nDiaspora is a part of her background and her life. Sher’s family migrated from two shtetls in Lithuania to escape the pogroms. They settled in Minnesota and Wisconsin: equally cold and anti-Semitic areas – just like home. Says Sher, “Fiddler on the Roof is me!” Many of her mother’s family moved to Israel and stayed. While in Wisconsin, her dad was offered a job in FDR’s New Deal so her family migrated to Washington, DC where she was raised. Sher came to study at the University of California, Berkeley, and then stayed and raised her family. She now works and resides in Oakland, California. She is a member of Mercury 20 Gallery on 25th Street and will have a show Morocco Seen and Unseen from September 12th to October 19th, inspired by the sights, sounds tastes and smells from her residency in Tetuoan in 2018.\n\nPeace Out, Patriarchy!, 2017\n\nGouache on handmade hemp paper, 17×21\n\nRupy C. Tut is an Oakland based visual artist working with two traditional art forms: Indian miniature painting (an 18th century Indian art form) and calligraphy. Rupy’s work is particularly remarkable for her strict practice with traditional materials and methods associated with these art forms. She creates work with intricate brushwork on handmade hemp paper using stone and organic pigments made in her studio. Being connected to traditional art making while innovating within its constraints, Rupy reaches back to a visual language that is centuries old but has relevance today. Her work dissects historical and contemporary narratives to portray the modern mix of influences from both the West and the East.\n\nIn Peace Out, Patriarchy!, Rupy challenges norms of identity and belonging as a first generation Punjabi Sikh immigrant. In this painting, she comments on post-migration trauma associated with gender roles imposed on women. This piece is centered on Heer, a famous character from Punjabi folklore who defies norms and stands up against social authorities. As the central character, Heer is a heroine who echoes the sentiments of many first generation girls around gender roles that become more strictly enforced in diasporic communities versus communities “back home.” For Rupy, this painting reiterates her role and responsibility as a traditional maker to capture the resilience of women who shaped history but have not been mentioned in history books.\n\nBaila Conmigo Bolivar, 2019\n\nLaser cut wood, 38×24\n\nCamilo is a Colombian artist who utilizes his creative practice as a visibility platform. He is committed to unveil oppressive systems to recreate alternative communities. His love for craft and performance intersect in order to communicate symbolic narratives that encourage conversation about the role of art within social justice. He is currently working on the Baila Conmigo project, which invites queer Latinx people to occupy iconic public spaces of cities to the rhythm of Latin beats. Besides livening the daily routine of citizens, this project aims to create community through dance, a non-verbal bodily language that brings people together. The dance is documented though video and photographs that are then translated into vibrant posters, stencils, collages and laser cut wooden pieces of the dancers.\n\n“This work represents a sub community within a community; the queer community within the Latinx culture. Many of us flee our countries in search of a safer place where we can be who we are meant to become without fear of being persecuted. While we are still living in our home countries, gay clubs become our haven, where dance becomes an act of liberation. The Baila Conmigo series captures the moments where the dancers allow themselves to shine in joy and no longer in struggle, fear or rejection. These works are meant to uplift our community with the use of vibrant colors and dynamic shapes. It is important to flip the narrative of victimization that often falls upon our community, and instead start empowering the representation of queer Latinx people so that the younger generations feel positively represented in art and the media.”\n\nTurbo’s Dream (D.E.K.Y.), 2015\n\nPhotography, 37×53\n\n“As a visual artist and woman of color, I am drawn to the beauty, brilliance and resilience of Black people across the diaspora. Turbo’s Dream (D.E.K.Y.) is the cover image from my self-published coffee table book entitled Black Joy and Resistance. The book highlights Black and Brown people at cultural celebrations, festivals and “safe spaces” where we can proudly express ourselves without fear of reprisal. While making this work, I traveled throughout the diaspora to capture “The Souls of Black Folks” and the majesty that happens when we tap into our authentic selves. By focusing on the seemingly simple premise of Black joy, I create an entry point for conversation around our inalienable right to that pursuit.”\n\nAdreinne Waheed is a photographer, photo editor and archivist based in Berkeley, California. An Oakland native, her love of photography begin at age thirteen and she has been committed to image making ever since. Ms. Waheed is an accomplished photo editor who has researched, produced and directed numerous shoots for publications including Vibe and Essence magazines. Her work has been published by The New York Times, National Geographic and Photo District News. In 2010, she created the Waheed Photo Archive, a collection of found photographs of African-Americans from Civil War to the present. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) acquired the archive in 2015. Adreinne’s first solo show, Black Joy and Resistance: The Exhibition, enjoyed a successful four month run at Betti Ono Gallery (Oakland, California) and closed June 20, 2019.\n\nIt Wasn’t a Dream, 2016\n\nMixed media, 12×12\n\nEllen Bepp is a mixed media artist and taiko musician who has aspired to give voice to her Japanese cultural roots through visual and musical expression. Growing up as a third generation Japanese American in the Japantown community of San Jose, California soon after World War II, she was surrounded by Japanese art and textiles. As a child she was greatly influenced by her immigrant grandmother, who taught traditional flower arranging and kimono making, and her grandfather who was a photographer, calligrapher and painter. She was raised with the philosophy that spiritual forces are “alive” in all objects. For her, that force emanates from each scrap of fabric or paper like a metaphor for identity at the core of her art. She reveals her cultural/political legacy as she strives to evoke personal and collective memory, addressing broader experiences of injustice and historical displacement of people.\n\nSince 1980 she has exhibited nationally, including at the Oakland Museum of California, Berkeley Art Center and Euphrat Gallery. Her work has spanned various media including wearable art, theatrical design, mixed media and hand cut paper. She also developed a kinship with pre-Columbian art and weaving traditions of Latin America, which inspired projects in Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Nicaragua and Cuba. In 1974 she began taiko training under Grand Master Seiichi Tanaka of San Francisco Taiko Dojo and went on to perform with San Jose Taiko. In 1999 she co-founded Somei Yoshino Taiko Ensemble, allowing her to realize her multi-disciplinary aesthetic vision. Today she continues to explore the political connection between art, culture and humanity as it informs her identity as an Asian American woman artist.\n\nAurora Cascade, 2018\n\nWoodcut, 22×15\n\n“My current project examines the visual legacy of “Carl Breuer and Sons” (CB&S) my Jewish family’s former textile printing business in Bohemia. In 1897 my great-great-grandfather Carl began the business, which included a factory in Bohemia. In 1939, the company, along with all other Jewish-owned property in German-occupied areas, was seized and sold to Nazi-approved owners, my family members were killed and the product of their work was lost. When my father was born in 1944 in Los Angeles his parents were not yet citizens of the United States. They were part of a relatively small amount of asylum-seeking refugees to have gained entry to the United States during the thirties and part of a larger Jewish diaspora displaced by the War.\n\nThrough my visit to both the CB&S factory, its archive of fabric samples and designs at the nearby Czech Textile Museum, I have acquired a rich digital collection of primary source material in the form of scans and photographs. My research has opened a window to the material world of my lost European family and allowed me to create a physical connection to the past which only art can provide.”\n\nNoah Breuer is an American artist and printmaker born and raised in Berkeley, California. He holds a BFA in Printmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design, and an MFA from Columbia University. He also earned a graduate research certificate in traditional woodblock printmaking and papermaking from Kyoto Seika University in Japan.\n\nA Family History 5, 2016\n\nPhotography, 20×30\n\nIn this work you see my father’s Polish passport and The Amsterdam, which is the ship on which he immigrated to America (probably in steerage), in 1920. He told me that, as a Jew, he had to stand well back from the desk of the official from which he would obtain the document so as to not accidentally touch him. Then he could step forward and place the fee on the desk, then step back while the official took it, and then go through the procedure again to pick up the actual passport. The family didn’t know that the holocaust was just over the horizon but they knew that things couldn’t possibly be worse in America.\n\nI have been a working photographer since the 1980’s. I usually work in projects. This project, A Family History, attempts to give a narration of immigration and Jewish culture in America. I have been involved in various San Francisco photographic institutions over the years, including Eye Gallery Collective, Media Alliance and Camerawork. I’ve studied at City College of San Francisco and Columbia University. I was an instructor of photography at the University of California, Berkeley, Extension for twenty two years. My current project, called Truth, is a meditation on the fungibility of photographic and philosophical truth using photography, painting and a written essay. It was started before the dawn of the post-truth society but seems even more apropos now.\n\nFor more information visit: DavidGoldbergImages.com\n\nAsset Abscission, 2018\n\nUV cured acrylic print on Acrylite, gold metal leaf, panel, 32×32\n\n“My works are inspired by brush painting from the Asian diaspora. Traditionally used by monks and scholars as a means to meditate on nature, I echo that sentiment by considering the role of nature in contemporary society. Compositions of flora and fauna are juxtaposed against a gilded backdrop of stock indexes. What do we value? What do we prioritize? And what are we willing to sacrifice for one or the other?”\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1979, Phillip Hua was raised in the city that would eventually become the heart of Silicon Valley. As a child, he spent his days wandering the many fields and creeks now replaced with redevelopment, fueled by the tech industry. He eventually received his BFA from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.\n\nHua’s work has been exhibited in galleries, museums and art fairs nationally and internationally. In 2016, he was awarded a public art commission from the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) for the redesign of the 19th Street Oakland BART station and a public art commission from the San Francisco Arts Commission in 2018. His work has been featured by Art Practical, The San Francisco Chronicle, SFWeekly, California Home + Design magazine, White Hot Magazine of Contemporary Art, Huffington Post, Interior Design magazine and 7×7 magazine, among others. Hua lives and works in San Francisco and is adjunct faculty at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco where he teaches Digital Media.\n\nEquanimity Series, Draw Thoughts, 2018\n\nAcrylic, resin on panel, 12×12\n\nBorn in Poland, Andrzej grew up during the years of political oppression and era of communist Poland. There, he attended the School for the Arts and Literature. Andrzej moved to New York in 1984 and received BFA in painting. He then received Master Degree from University of Pennsylvania in the field of Urban Architecture. His artistic direction began to take shape after integrating Eastern spirituality into his artworks. His recent paintings have become Cosmocentric. Andrzej’s artistic philosophy lead him to California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco where he received, in 2011, Masters in Integral Psychology and Certification in Expressive Art Therapy. His paintings are exhibited in LA, SF Bay Area, Chicago, New York, Paris, London and Hong Kong.\n\n“My work strives to find balance between western and eastern concepts through the duality of the identity of man with the way I perceive the role of man within the cosmos. My paintings extend beyond the individual to intentionally embrace nature as inclusive of man and art. With each work, there is a push and pull that develops in my paintings, one color, image, text or textile at a time. Each step is an inspiration for the next. My composition develops freely allowing my paintings to form from the depths of the creative process. The essence of each work carries its own unique direction.”\n\nHome – Reflection, 2019\n\nInk, tempera on cotton paper, 16×12\n\n“My work is based on my personal history; it explores the idea of home and the theme of displacement that was present in my family for several generations. Since leaving my country, the postwar Croatia, I moved to sixteen different places before establishing what I now call my home in Alameda, California. It is not always the case that we feel at home where we came from, or where we are living. I am exploring the definition of home as not being a single place. Is our definition of home evolving? Our physical home is just one of the spaces that define us. Is home space, a place or a feeling?”\n\nAnita Sulimanovic is a visual artist known for her site-specific sculptures and installations made with recycled materials and found objects. Born in Croatia, she graduated in sculpture at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts. In 2002 Anita moved to Scotland, United Kingdom to pursue an MFA in Sculpture at the Edinburgh College of Art, graduating in 2004. She also won the competition to design the Planet Award sculpture for BBC World Music Awards. She has created public sculptures and shown her work in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Anita immigrated to the United States in 2008, and in 2014 she permanently moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and founded Studio 1.6 Art School in Alameda, where she teaches fine art disciplines and continues her studio practice. Anita recently had a solo show at Pro Arts, Oakland, and has been selected for NYFA Mentoring Program Oakland.\n\nGuests Missed, 2019\n\nMixed media, 48×36\n\nThe main theme in my art is alienation and assimilation of the immigrant in a foreign culture. As a Korean woman in the United States, I have confronted the challenges associated with race, language and geography that most immigrants encounter. But what has shaped my perspectives even more is my struggle with the cultural conflict that exists for women born in Asian cultures who must learn to cope with a new startling social model in the West.\n\nThis struggle is a consistent undercurrent throughout my work. Many of my pieces use calligraphic – and at times unintelligible – characters to convey both the frustration of incomprehension and the beauty and universality of understanding. The words should resonate on a very subtle and deeply personal level. My intention is to use the power of the art to soothe the mind. Recently I was one of seven artists of, In-Between Places: Korean American Artists in the Bay Area. The artists featured during In-Between Places reveal the reality and complexities of being a Korean American artist in the Bay Area – a location that has served as a gateway for Korean culture and a bridge between Korea and the West.\n\nIn-Between Places acknowledges the infinitely evolving and nuanced ways Korean Americans interpret and express history, culture and art. Reflecting on the relationship of Korean American artists to art making in the Bay Area, the exhibition offers fresh considerations on the intricacies of cultural identity.\n\nJulie Johnson is the winemaker and owner of Tres Sabores, a winery nestled into the western Rutherford bench land of the Napa Valley. Passionate about food, wine, and the land, for the last 30 years Julie has lived on a certified organic farm, growing wine grapes, pomegranates, lemons and olives, raising her children, not to mention Golden Retrievers, Guinea Hens, and sheep.\n\nA native of California, Julie graduated from Columbia as a P.H.N. after receiving a B.A. from Bowdoin College. Relocating to the Napa Valley in 1980, she practiced nursing even as she founded Frog’s Leap Winery (with her first husband, John Williams and partner, Larry Turley) in 1981. In 1990 she joined with Michaela Rodeno, past CEO at St. Supery Winery, and founded “Women for Wine Sense, a vital national organization whose “vision is to support the appreciation for and responsible consumption of wine”. Julie started Tres Sabores in 1999 as a single vineyard estate and soon began making her own wine. She speaks and participates in seminars on the subjects of Women in Wine and Regenerative Farming for a variety of clients and at educational venues around the country. She is currently active in C.C.O.F (California Certified Organic Farms), Wild Farm Alliance and the Rutherford Dust Society. At the end of the day, she sleeps best if she feels that she has been a thoughtful and energetic steward of the land and has capped off the day with a good glass of wine!\n\nTres Sabores: Celebrating the “three flavors” in each glass of wine: those of the vine, the terroir, and the spirit of the good company around the table.\n\nCary Quintana, winemaker/owner of Cary Q Wines, was born and raised in Miami, Florida, (of Cuban descent) and set off on her winemaking journey to beautiful Northern California in 2013. UC Davis alumni and equally self-taught, Cary Q was fueled by an innate love for the fermented grape and aims to highlight Grenache in its truest essence. The East Bay, specifically in the historic building of Camelia Street, near the corridor on 4th street in Berkeley, California is home to Cary Q Wines.\n\nA minimalist at heart, Cary Q believes in keeping it simple, with a focus on the fruit source, intentionally sticking to small lots and getting out of the wine’s way. This marks a distinction of place, climate and varietal. She likes the idea and philosophy of working with unique vineyards that are conscientious and practice meticulous and organic farming. The soils are what she believes to be the start of the real story to a varietally expressive wine. She also believes in being fully hands-on by hand harvesting and hand sorting her fruit, being fully transparent throughout her winemaking process. Throughout the year, Cary’s time is spent patiently watching, being sensorially vigilant, and witnessing the beautiful development of must to wine, and vineyard to bottle without intervening or adjusting its natural evolvement. For Cary, the most important part of this journey is finding that balance and always remembering the land and vines that brought us this wine.\n\nAs a photographer, visual artist, designer and storyteller, Josie Iselin has been investigating the secret world of seaweed for many years. The marine algae of the California coast are a treasure that few realize is there, not far from our busy lives in the city.\n\nWith floor-to-ceiling larger-than-life-size images of iconic California seaweed and kelp, Iselin’s seaweed curtains serve as a reminder to drop one’s phone. Iselin invites the viewer to go out and look, explore an unfamiliar zone, and give it one’s considered attention, along with some empathy perhaps.\n\nUsing a flatbed scanner, Iselin creates these images by pushing light through the algal specimen as the scan is captured to create seaweed portraits that glow and vibrate. The dye-sublimation printing process allows light to come through the fabric/image much as sunlight filters through the ocean waters and is captured by photosynthesizing seaweed and kelp.\n\nThese spectacular and odd organisms speak to us; they compel us to think about our oceans and the richness of a world just off our shores. They allude to evolution in extreme environments, to ingenuity and resilience. The world of kelp and seaweed is so visually striking and so at odds with our assumptions, that one cannot help to perk up and take notice.\n\nEwart (Red) was born and grew up in the Yorkshire town of Wetherby, England. He served a brief tour of duty in the Royal Navy, before emigrating to Canada, where he earned a B. Arch. degree at the University of British Columbia in 1954. Red was captivated by the field of architectural acoustics — he consulted with Bolt, Beranek and Newman for more than 25 years and taught at numerous universities in North America. He was universally acknowledged by his colleagues as a deep and original thinker, publishing numerous technical papers and continuing to consult and write until the end of his life.\n\nRed and his wife Jinny moved to Alameda in 1985, where he vigorously engaged in community affairs, most notably as the President of the Citizens League for Airport Safety and Serenity, as a member of the Alameda Citizens Task Force Steering Committee, as an Alameda Land Use Commissioner, and as a member of both the Mastick Senior Center Advisory Board and the Rhythmix Cultural Works Community Advisory Board.\n\nRed’s dry wit and sense of humor were legendary among all who knew him, as were his modesty, warm generosity, and intellectual curiosity. He was a champion for the arts and will be greatly missed.\n\n“My path has humbly lead me to wanting to help other women find their “voice” through the power of rhythm.”\n\nElaine N.
