        "text": "President General Pamela Rouse Wright is excited to lead the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution forward as it prepares the groundwork for the 250th anniversary of the United States in 2026. Her administration theme, “Celebrate Stars & Stripes Forever! and Rejoice in our DAR Ties of Service and Friendship,” aims to bring Daughters together to sparkle as they celebrate our country’s unique and rich history at the national level and within their own communities.\n\nMrs. Wright brings extensive leadership experience to her role as President General, and she understands the hard work that goes into local chapter operations and how that impacts the experiences members have. Mrs. Wright has been involved with DAR since her mid 20s, where she re-energized the National Society’s Junior Membership programs in Texas and at the national level. She joined the Lady Washington Chapter—one of the largest in the National Society at more than 600 members—and served in several leadership roles, including Centennial Chapter Regent. Mrs. Wright held state chairmanships and was an active participant in a variety of different committees and special initiatives before leading with distinction as State Regent. As State Regent, she led her team to propel Texas membership to more than 18,000 members.\n\nThese experiences prepared her to serve at the national level as Chair and Vice Chair of several committees and also as an appointed member of the Long Range Planning Commission. Mrs. Wright then served as the Chaplain General during the Dillon Administration and First Vice President General during the VanBuren Administration. Serving as Chaplain General helped her understand the importance of valuing and continuing communications with members aged 90 and above.\n\nAn accomplished businesswoman and jewelry designer, Mrs. Wright is the founder and owner of a jewelry and luxury goods business in Houston. She has designed and created jewelry for First Ladies and wives of cabinet members, and her designs have even been featured on television shows. Combining her love for Texas with her expertise, Mrs. Wright created the Texas Front Porch pin selected by First Lady Anita Perry to benefit the Texas Governor’s Mansion Restoration Fund. The National Society has greatly benefited from Mrs. Wright’s business knowledge, expertise and creative talents in transitioning the DAR Insignia Store from an outside commercial vendor to an in-house operation. Her keen business sense has also earned her many professional accolades and awards.\n\nMrs. Wright, a DAR member for more than 35 years, credits the friendships she has made in the National Society to her success within the organization. One major goal of her administration is to promote belonging by acknowledging each member and expressing gratitude for her dedication to service. Mrs. Wright is no stranger to service. Her own diverse philanthropic endeavors have been recognized through numerous awards in her local community. She has also devoted her time and energy by serving in leadership roles in various business associations and nonprofit organizations. Her many awards include Houston Treasure, ABC-13 Woman of Distinction, Citizens for Animal Protection Hall of Fame, STEM Role Model, 50 Most Influential Women in Houston and 25 Most Beautiful Houstonians. She was recently commissioned a Yellow Rose of Texas by the governor for her exceptional volunteerism and charitable contributions of time, talent and treasure.\n\nShe is encouraging DAR’s nearly 190,000 members to embrace their membership and celebrate their own special bonds through participation, whatever their life situation, age or abilities. She recognizes that each member is capable of contributing to DAR in her own unique way and has challenged each chapter to identify opportunities to propel membership growth by welcoming all descendants of American Patriots. Mrs. Wright traces her own lineage to 14 Patriot ancestors who were soldiers or provided material aid for the cause of freedom during the American Revolutionary War. She is also very proud to be the great-granddaughter of a late 19th-century Italian immigrant.\n\nMrs. Wright is a magna cum laude graduate of Ouachita Baptist University and she attended graduate school at the University of Arkansas. She holds certification through the Gemological Institute of America and the International Society of Appraisers.\n\nShe and her husband of 40 years, Jack Wright, are members of Second Baptist Church in Houston. They have two children and eight grandchildren who are life members of Children of the American Revolution. While growing up, Mrs. Wright was inspired to appreciate her family heritage by her parents and grandparents, and she is a third-generation DAR member. She and her grandmothers joined during Mrs. Fleck’s administration. Her mother, sister, and daughter-in-law are also DAR members."
