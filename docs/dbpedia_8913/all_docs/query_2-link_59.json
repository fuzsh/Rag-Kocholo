As catalysts, we cultivate and advance the breakthrough ideas that will shape our collective future.\n\nTo learn more about Barr's work and our partners, explore our retrospective of the past two years.\n\nWatch the following video where Barr's president and trustee, Jim Canales speaks about the Foundation's mission.\n\nSince September 2017, the board has grown from three members to nine. It is anticipated that the board will continue to include others to share in the governance of the Foundation.\n\nOur board chair’s blog post about the evolution of the Foundation’s governance is available here.\n\nPictured from left to right: Vanessa Calderón-Rosado, Jim Canales, Mark Edwards, Barbara Hostetter, Amos Hostetter, Sue Tierney, Lee Pelton, Caroline Hostetter Walsh.
