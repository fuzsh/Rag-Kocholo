        "text": "DES MOINES — An Iowa man suspected in the 1991 murder of a woman and her unborn baby in Spring Hill has been arrested and is pending extradition to Tennessee.\n\nClark Perry Baldwin, 59, was taken into custody Wednesday at his Waterloo, Iowa, home, according to a news release from the office of Brent Cooper, attorney general of the 22nd Judicial District in Tennessee.\n\nBaldwin, a former truck driver, will face two charges of first-degree murder of Virginia native Pamela \"Rose\" Aldridge McCall, 33, and her unborn child. He is suspected of committing two additional homicides in the 1990s.\n\nBaldwin is expected to also be charged with two counts of murder in Wyoming, the release stated.\n\n\"I’m sure he thought it had been forgotten about,\" said Brent Cooper, attorney general of the 22nd Judicial District in Tennessee. \"He certainly hoped it had.\"\n\nReopening the Pamela Aldridge McCall cold case\n\nCooper's office helped relaunch the investigation last April that led to Wednesday's arrest.\n\nMcCall was found strangled to death on March 10, 1991, in Spring Hill, according to the release. She was pregnant and last seen with a truck driver, police learned at the time.\n\nShe was born in Cedar Rapids and had family in Iowa, according to a 1991 obituary published in the Newport News Daily Press in Virginia.\n\nMcCall was described by her mother as free-spirited and transient, often hitchhiking through Virginia and Tennessee, according to the Daily Press. Marsha Lyell in 1991 told the newspaper her child's killer should be executed by the state. Capital punishment is legal in Tennessee.\n\n\"I give her birth and air, and he takes the air out of her,\" Lyell said in April 1991. \"That's what makes me mad — he's still breathing.\"\n\nHer cold case was reopened in April 2019 when Spring Hill police approached the district attorney's office for help investigating the crime.\n\n\"Fortunately for us, the Spring Hill Police Department still had all of the evidence and the original file,\" Cooper said. \"That’s usually the first roadblock we run into with cold cases is that departments over the years ... tend to clean house, and sometimes that means getting rid of old evidence.\"\n\nDNA found at the scene of McCall's death was submitted to a Tennessee crime lab and a suspect profile was built, the release states.\n\nWhen put into a national database, the DNA came back as a match for a suspect in two unsolved homicides in Wyoming. Those deaths occurred in March and April 1992 and bore similarities to McCall's death, the release says.\n\n\"This is only the second serial killer that I’ve seen in my 20-year experience,\" Cooper said.\n\nHis office has not yet decide whether it will seek the death penalty in this case, he said.\n\nBaldwin tied to Wyoming killings\n\nIn Wyoming, Baldwin is charged in the deaths of two unidentified women whose bodies were found in 1992 roughly 400 miles apart.\n\nA female trucker discovered the nude body of the first victim in March 1992 near the Bitter Creek Truck turnout on Interstate 80 in southwestern Wyoming, according to the Associated Press. An autopsy determined the woman suffered head trauma consistent with strangulation and her body had likely been in the snow for weeks.\n\nA month later, Wyoming Department of Transportation workers found the partially mummified body of a pregnant woman in a ditch off of Interstate 90, near Sheridan in northern Wyoming.\n\nAn autopsy didn’t determine the cause of death but found the victim had an injury potentially consistent with suffering a blow to the head.\n\nInvestigators never identified the women and referred to them as “Bitter Creek Betty” and “I-90 Jane Doe.” Both were believed to be in their late teens or early 20s, Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation Cmdr. Matt Waldock told the AP.\n\nHow DNA led to Clark Perry Baldwin's arrest\n\nFederal authorities used forensic genealogy, the practice of using genetic information in online databases, and looked at similar cases, which Cooper said eventually led them to Baldwin. Last month in Iowa, the FBI secretly collected DNA from Baldwin’s trash and a shopping cart he used at a Walmart and testing revealed that it was a match, according to the AP.\n\n“They were able to collect some items ... without him knowing about it, and we submitted those items to the lab and got a hit,\" Cooper said. \"The same DNA that we had at our three murder scenes was on those items that Mr. Baldwin had touched.\n\n\"That’s what got us to Iowa, and today was the day that we knocked on his door.”\n\nCourt documents say that Baldwin allegedly raped a female hitchhiker in Wheeler County, Texas, at gunpoint in his truck in 1991, the AP reported. The 21-year-old woman told police that Baldwin struck her on the head, bound her hands and mouth and tried to choke her to death. He allegedly admitted to the assault but was released pending grand jury proceedings.\n\nCooper said the charges were dropped after the victim, who lived out of state, refused to return to Texas.\n\nMcCall's mother reacts\n\nLyell, now 79 years old, was unaware that police were once again looking into her daughter's case until a few weeks ago, Cooper said.\n\n\"We didn’t want to give her hope if there wasn't anything to be hopeful about,\" he said.\n\nWhen notified that police were nearing an arrest, Lyell broke down on the phone, Cooper said.\n\n\"She thought that she would go to her grave never knowing who killed her daughter and grandchild,\" he said.\n\nCooper said federal authorities are looking into other cold cases to see if there is a link to Baldwin.\n\n\"I heard a number at one time — I can’t recall it right now — but a number of similar unsolved murders across the country that may be attributed to him,\" he said.\n\nBaldwin, who has previously lived in Nashua, Iowa, and Springfield, Missouri, was a cross-country truck driver for Marten Transport at the time, the AP reported.\n\nHe is being held at the Black Hawk County jail pending extradition proceedings to Tennessee.\n\n— Associated Press reporter Ryan J. Foley contributed to this story."
