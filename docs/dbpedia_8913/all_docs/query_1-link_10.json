        "text": "With longtime writing partner Mary Ann Kennedy, Rose has been nominated for two GRAMMY Awards and has won praise for her powerful alliance with Mary Ann as the acclaimed duo Kennedy Rose. The twosome won the ear of rock star Sting and recorded two CDs for his private label Pangaea Records, a label he founded for “uncategorizable music”. As an added treat, they were asked to open for him on one of his World Tours. As special guests of Emmylou Harris, Kennedy Rose also performed twice for President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and later at the Nobel Peace Prize Presentation in Oslo, Norway.\n\nFor the better part of 2016, Kennedy & Rose reunited with Emmylou Harris to tour as an acoustic trio, spotlighting the duo and treating the crowds to their impressive 3-part blend with Harris.\n\nAs a solo artist, she has recorded CDs, “Morpheus”, “Fly”, and most recently “The Temple Sessions”. Since 2006, she has enjoyed a vibrant life of touring, rejoining Mary Ann Kennedy and touring as an acoustic trio with Emmylou Harris in North America and Europe, and traveling the world as a solo artist with Australian guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel.\n\nPam’s collaboration with acoustic guitar master Tommy Emmanuel landed her a spot on the PBS TV show “Tommy Emmanuel & Friends”, which has been featured as the National Pledge Drive special since 2011. On the show, she performs one of her Grammy Nominated songs, “I’ll Still Be Loving You” and a co-written composition with Emmanuel, “Haba Na Haba”. The latter is the story of a Tanzanian woman whose work with AIDS orphans prompted her to live her life by a Swahili proverb, for which the English translation is “Little By Little, we fill the cup”. It is a story about Hope, and of taking long and sometimes arduous journeys one step at a time”. The duet with Pam and Tommy is on his most recent solo CD, “Little By Little”.\n\nPam’s song “Walls” (co-written with Kennedy and Randy Sharp) has become the signature song for the multi-national Interdependence movement, and she has performed it at peace events in Istanbul, Indonesia, Belfast, Berlin, Moscow, and Mexico City.\n\nShe has recently enjoyed hit record status of her own in Sweden, having appeared on the most successful TV series in that country’s history, “Jill’s Veranda” with longtime friend and Swedish icon Jill Johnson. Her song “Never You” (co-written with Swedish icon Marit Bergman) soared in the Scandinavian charts and was a favorite on the “Jill’s Veranda” soundtrack CD."
