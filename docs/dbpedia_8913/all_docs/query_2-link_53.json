Find out here!\n\nDescription\n\nI came across this nest hole and its three little residents in a dead palm tree while driving up a country road. I was amazed at how patiently the three young flickers were…they often waited a long time for one of their parents to arrive. This tree was also the home of European Starling babies and a young ground squirrel. I hope it doesn’t get cut down!"
