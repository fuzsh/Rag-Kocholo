        "text": "Few voices have the power to cut to the bone like Pam Rose’s. Layer that over her profound songwriting gift and her consummate musicianship on an assortment of instruments, and you begin to get a glimpse of a real artist.\n\nWith longtime writing partner Mary Ann Kennedy, Rose has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, and has won praise for her powerful alliance with Mary Ann as the acclaimed duo Kennedy Rose. The twosome won the ear of rock star Sting and recorded two CDs for his private label Pangaea Records. As an added treat, they were asked to open for him on one of his World Tours. As special guests of Emmylou Harris, Kennedy Rose also performed twice for President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and later at the Nobel Peace Prize Presentation in Oslo, Norway. As a solo artist, she has been touring with guitar virtuosos John Jorgenson and Tommy Emmanuel, and has recently rejoined Mary Ann Kennedy and Emmylou Harris to do an acoustic tour of Europe and North America in 2006 and 2007.\n\nPresented by Tidewater Friends of Acoustic Music\n\nSponsored by\n\nNO DISCOUNTS OR COUPONS ARE VALID FOR THIS SHOW"
