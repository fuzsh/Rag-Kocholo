        "text": "Ruby Rose was already famous when she moved to the United States six years ago. But we didn’t know it.\n\nShe was a model, having risen from runner-up in a nationwide model search in her home country of Australia to becoming the face of Maybelline New York there. She was a VJ on MTV Australia. She was a prominent DJ and a clothing designer. She guest-judged Australia’s Next Top Model. But few in America knew who she was until they met her as the tattooed heartthrob Stella Carlin on Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black in 2015.\n\nIn the two years since, Rose has rocketed from relative obscurity to posting Instagram photos with Taylor Swift and Zendaya and representing brands like Urban Decay and Nike. She’s emerged as an LGBTQ icon who tweets frequently about equal rights issues to more than 1.3 million followers. Having landed her first major movie role last year (in the latest of the Resident Evil franchise), she’s in three this year—action flicks xXx: Return of Xander Cage and John Wick: Chapter 2 came out in January, and this month she has a supporting role in the comedy musical Pitch Perfect 3. Next year she’ll appear alongside Jason Statham in the summer thriller The Meg.\n\nOn a Wednesday afternoon in early November, over Brussels sprouts and baba ganoush at the Soho House in West Hollywood, Rose reflected on the harsh and distorting glare of the spotlight, the convoluted responsibility of being both a spokesmodel and a role model, and the fits and starts in her rise to fame—starting with that time she accidentally got her big break.\n\nAs a 20-year-old acting student in 2007, Rose wasn’t supposed to nail her audition at MTV Australia. She only went as a class assignment. She'd never watched the channel—she didn't even have cable. Then something unexpected happened: She got the job.\n\nIt put her in a predicament. “I had to go to acting school and say, ‘OK, this happened and then that happened, and then I got the job so now what do I do?,’” she tells SELF. Spoiler alert: She took it. The decision set her on a course for fame, but it would be a decade before she’d end up where—and who—she actually wanted to be.\n\nIn the final, televised audition for the MTV role, Jackass star Bam Margera had Rose chugging 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes and kissing strangers on the street. It was a fitting test. Rose says she spent the next few years “drinking and being wild,” coming into her own as a known personality and navigating the treacheries and temptations of show business. Though she says her rise to television fame helped her grow a thick skin and learn to weather harsh criticism—including the hate mail she got after chopping her hair from below her shoulders into the short-cropped look she'd come to be known for—the time marked what Rose now considers the least healthy period of her life.\n\n“I was drinking, never sleeping enough, eating really terrible food, I was stressed out,” she says. She contracted SIBO, a bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, and got mercury poisoning.\n\nShe knew she had to take control. She went from vegetarian to vegan and got sober, a decision she says was more preventive than reactive, particularly because she knew her family had a history of heavy drinking. “I felt like I had to choose between drinking and being social, or being fit and doing the best I could at work. And everything changed when I quit drinking,” she says. “I got more work opportunities, I felt healthier, my body was better, my brain was better, my relationships were better, and it sort of felt like there were all these miracles.”\n\nRose also got back into boxing, a sport she’d taken up as a teenager (and which would serve her well later in her career while training for action roles). She won her first—and last—amateur fight at 25. “I felt pretty confident during the fight, and yet, the scream of my mother in this whole huge massive fighting venue…will traumatize me forever,” she recalls. “She was like, ‘Congratulations, you were amazing, never do that again’ and I was like, ‘I won’t.’”\n\nHealthy, strong, and forging her own better path, Rose set out to redefine herself professionally. At the end of 2011, she left the stability of friends, family, and a steady income from television and modeling and moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of making the leap to film. But the talent agents she met with didn't envision her expanding much beyond the career she'd established in Australia.\n\n\"I didn't want to become a brand. I wanted to become an actor.”\n\n“I thought that because I had done so many things in Australia, I’d have an easier entrance into the field,\" she says. \"But I met with all the agents. I met with everybody and they all passed. I wanted to act and they were all willing to take me on, but they wanted me to be a host or a DJ or an influencer, or the biggest thing that they wanted me to do was reality TV. And I really, really didn’t want to do that.”\n\nAfter two years of unemployment in Los Angeles, in between trips back and forth to Australia for modeling, DJ'ing and TV hosting gigs, Rose began to wonder if she’d made a mistake in turning down all those agents who might have at least gotten her consistent work as a television personality.\n\n“Part of the reason I didn't want to be a host or especially didn't want to do something on reality TV is I was sick of always being Ruby Rose and being on as this character of yourself when I wanted to be different people,” Rose says. “You become a brand. I didn't want to become a brand. I wanted to become an actor.”\n\nWith no parts to play, she made her own. In 2014, she wrote, produced, and starred in the short film “Break Free,” which she released online. At roughly five minutes long and with no dialogue, the film shows Rose’s character undergoing a full transformation from hyperfeminine to ultra-masculine. In it, she sheds a long blonde wig, skintight bandage dress, makeup, and heels in favor of a chest binder, men’s clothing, a prosthetic penis, and her signature buzzed 'do, which has drawn doppelgänger comparisons to Justin Bieber.\n\nThe film is loosely inspired by Rose’s own struggle to figure out her gender identity. She came out as a lesbian to her mother at age 12, but says that when she was younger she’d thought about wanting to transition from female to male—she didn’t know there were other options. “When I was really young, my own understanding was that you had to be either a boy or a girl and I didn't feel like I fit the mold of a girl,” she says, crediting celebrities like Annie Lennox, David Bowie, Prince, and Madonna for helping to expand her own perceptions of gender as a spectrum. Today she identifies as gender fluid.\n\nIssues of gender and identity were beginning to enter the mainstream media zeitgeist when “Break Free” came out and quickly went viral—it has since amassed more than 32 million views on YouTube. Two months earlier, Time magazine had declared the culture was at a “transgender tipping point,” when it put Orange Is the New Black actor (and Rose’s future costar) Laverne Cox on its cover. Two months later, the Amazon TV series Transparent would weave transitioning into a family dramedy.\n\n“It was a really beautiful moment and serendipitous timing that you just really trust in the universe that things sort of happen when they’re meant to,” says Rose, a self-described spiritual person who makes manifestation lists, sets intentions, and reads Tarot.\n\n“When I was really young, my own understanding was that you had to be either a boy or a girl and I didn't feel like I fit the mold of a girl.”\n\nRose says the video caught the attention of Jennifer Euston, a casting director for Orange Is the New Black, who hired her for a recurring role in the third season. Rose still didn't have a manager, and her agent back in Australia hadn’t even heard of the hit Netflix show. And despite the viral success of her video, she was still an unknown in the States. But by the time the season premiered, in the summer of 2015, nearly everyone with a Netflix subscription was talking about Ruby Rose, the gorgeous tattooed Aussie who came out of nowhere.\n\n“Being Australian, and being not the 'norm' when it comes to Hollywood actresses, I can really relate to Ruby's journey in the industry,” Rose’s Pitch Perfect 3 costar Rebel Wilson tells SELF via email. “I think people probably don't know how hard she's worked to get to where she is.”\n\nUltimately, Rose says, it was a blessing in disguise that American audiences had no idea who she was when she got here. Her breakout role on OITNB came at a point in her life when she was secure in her own identity, confident in her lifestyle choices, and ready to embrace her newfound influence as a role model, particularly for young women and LGBTQ youths.\n\n“I definitely always keep in mind that what I do is going to influence other people, young or old, whatever, I want to make sure that the person they look up to is the same person that they looked up to in the beginning,” says Rose.\n\nWhich is why she takes it very seriously when the media cast aspersions on her body or make insinuations about her health. She has learned to handle criticism; what she worries about is the effect such talk can have on her fans.\n\nWhen accusations swirled that she looked too thin at a Vogue charity event this fall, Rose wondered if it was irresponsible of her to share the offending midriff-baring photo with her nearly 12 million Instagram followers. But after giving it some thought, she decided not only to keep the photo up, but to set the record straight. In a note posted to her Instagram story in October, Rose defended her appearance, explaining that she trains daily and doesn't consume alcohol, processed food, meat, or dairy.\n\n“What’s upsetting to me is that I’ve never posted a picture—I don’t think anybody posts a picture—to say, 'This is what you should look like.' I’m just posting a picture of what I’m doing and what I look like in my day,” says Rose, who, looking back, allows that perhaps she does look especially slim in the photo—a fact she attributes to the camera flash, adding that her weight fluctuates weekly depending on her workouts. She says she eschews some intense cardio workouts for fear of dropping weight too fast. “So for them to think that I was promoting a certain body type, it’s not,” she says. “I was just promoting the fact that I’d gotten invited to go to this cool Vogue thing and [got to] meet Anna Wintour, which I was excited about.” (Wintour is the artistic director at Condé Nast, SELF's parent company.)\n\nAfter the Sydney premiere of Pitch Perfect 3 in November, Rose again drew unwanted attention. Fans left comments on social media speculating on her weight and health, and the Daily Mail detailed the scrutiny in a story online. Rose responded sharply on Instagram stories, calling the paper “reckless” for selecting photos in which she looked thinnest and for publishing a story that could be triggering to readers who may deal with disordered eating or body image issues.\n\n“I always keep in mind that what I do is going to influence other people. I want to make sure that the person they look up to is the same person that they looked up to in the beginning.”\n\nShe’s got a point. Though the Daily Mail avoided any direct mentions of eating disorders, the insinuation is clear (and more explicit language has been bandied about before). The National Eating Disorders Association warns that “you can’t tell whether someone has an eating disorder just by looking at them.\" And as SELF has written before, it’s irresponsible and inappropriate to speculate about a person’s weight or health—and frankly, it’s nobody’s business.\n\nBut we’re living in a 24-hour-news-cycle social media world, so there’s little chance that people are going to keep their mouths shut. To shield her fans from further exposure and make her Instagram “a safe place,” Rose disabled comments on her Instagram photos.\n\n“From the bottom of my heart I am sorry if those stories triggered anything in anyone. This is the problem with believing tabloids or any news without research,” she wrote on Instagram. “So when the dailyfail resorts to making new stories compiled purely of people’s comments on my page...it’s time to take that away from them to protect everyone.”\n\nThat’s not the only way she has scrubbed her Instagram posts—from red carpet moments to photos of her three rescue Chihuahuas and (until recently) her girlfriend, Jessica Origliasso—of unsavory material. One thing she tries not to show is the one vice she can’t seem to kick: smoking.\n\n“I hate the smell of it, I hate the fact that I do it, I hate everything about it,” she says, explaining that she picked up the habit on the set of film and photo shoots as an excuse to take a break and get some fresh air in between takes. (She’s been reading Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking in her latest attempt to quit.) “I would never ever smoke in a place that I knew I’d be photographed, because I’d never want the fans to see that and think that I thought smoking was cool because I don't think it’s cool.”\n\nWhether she asked for it or not, she feels a duty to set an example for her fans. And the power of influence swings both ways. Rose is both accountable to the legions who follow her every move and indebted to them for holding her to higher standards than she sometimes holds herself. “[Fans think] it must be a big responsibility or a lot of pressure and it’s like, no. If anything, I thank them more because they keep me in line,” she says. “When you've got people that you know believe in you for you and love you, you stay true to who you are authentically.”"
