All swinging!\"\n\nMultiple-Award winning Jazz guitarist Terrence Brewer called upon jazz and blues vocalist Pamela Rose to lovingly rejoice in the vocal/guitar duo work of Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass. Mellifluous, swinging and intimate, Ella and Joes partnership on Pablo Records created four incomparable records, treasured by a generation of music lovers.\n\nBrewer and Rose discovered that those recordings had been deeply influential to them both and embarked on a journey of rediscovery which has resulted in a new recording Dont Worry Bout Me Remembering Ella & Joe."
