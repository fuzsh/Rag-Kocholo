Starting Thursday, investors grew worried about a slowing U.S. economy. They pointed fingers at the Fed for waiting too long to cut rates and sold shares of technology companies that had ridden a frenzy around artificial intelligence to lofty stock market valuations. For individual investors, experts say it’s not time for rash decisions, but a moment to make sure their investments are properly diversified. We provide additional context on financial markets. Find the latest Localize It guides.\n\nUS--EDUCATION-HEAD START-LOCALIZE IT: Over the last decade enrollment has taken a steep dive in federal Head Start programs, which have provided early education and other services for families in poverty dating back to the 1960s. In 2013, more than 1.1 million people were served by Head Start (mostly children, but also some pregnant people). By 2022, that number had fallen to around 786,000. That’s according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which analyzed federal data. Some have closed after they lost a building lease, faced a rent hike or because interest in the program dropped when free prekindergarten was introduced. But Head Start operators say the decline owes also to a difficult labor market, with employees leaving for the retail and service sectors where they often can earn higher wages. We provide context for the closures and resources for viewing Head Start enrollment trends in your area, along with suggestions for local reporting. Find the latest Localize It guides.\n\nUS--CAMPUS PROTESTS-ARRESTS-LOCALIZE IT: More than 3,200 people were arrested on campuses this spring during a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments protesting the war in Gaza. Many students have already seen those charges dismissed. But the cases have yet to be resolved for hundreds of people at campuses that saw the highest number of arrests, according to an analysis of data gathered by The Associated Press. In addition to the legal limbo, those students face uncertainty in their academic careers. We list schools with more than 100 arrests, provide a map with arrest numbers around the country and offer reporting suggestions. Find the latest Localize It guides.\n\nUS-MED-LISTERIA-DELI-MEATS-LOCALIZE IT: A deadly food poisoning outbreak has led to the recall of more than 7 million pounds of Boar’s Head deli meats made at a plant in Virginia. U.S. health officials are continuing to investigate the outbreak of the bacteria listeria that began in May. Two people have died and nearly three dozen were hospitalized in 13 states. The meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said. We list the 13 states impacted, link to a list of the recalled items and provide reporting suggestions.
