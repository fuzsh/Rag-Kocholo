Ben Chapman was 79 when he died according to an old article in 2008 that I just happen to find when surfing the net for creatures of the black lagoon.\n\nAnyone in love of pulp movies from the 50´s and 60´s should quickly get hold of a movie of it. Dont get a crappy copy of it from a dodgy place on the net, instead go to the video/DVD store and rent it or buy a proper movie DVD with hopefully extra material in honour of the man and those who made it in the 50´s. And you will enjoy.\n\nArticle in the NY Times >\n\nFilmbuffonline>\n\nFound this seemingly private website with pictures of Ben Chapman at a party >\n\nEnjoy!\n\nStefan Lindblad\n\nIllustrator & artist"
