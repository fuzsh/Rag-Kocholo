        "text": "Name: William Benjamin “Ben” Chapman\n\nPosition: Outfielder\n\nBorn: December 25, 1908 (Nashville, TN)\n\nDied: July 7, 1993 (Hoover, AL)\n\nYankee Years: 1930-36\n\nPrimary number: 7\n\nYankee statistics: 910 G, .305/.379/.451, 209 2B, 64 3B, 60 HR, 184 SB, 119 wRC+, 26.5 rWAR, 25.5 fWAR\n\nBiography\n\nBen Chapman burst onto the MLB scene in 1930 as a 21-year-old. He quickly showed he had the bat to stick in the big leagues, along with a great set of wheels. Defensively, he was ill-suited for his initial position at third base and, before long, found himself relocated to the outfield where he was at least a marginally better defender."
