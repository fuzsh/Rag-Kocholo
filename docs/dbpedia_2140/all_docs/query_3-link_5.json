        "text": "In his senior season of high school Ben Chapman helped his team win the Alabama state baseball championship. He was proficient enough as a pitcher and infielder that the Yankees made him a contract offer.\n\nChapman initially declined, opting instead to follow his mother’s wishes by enrolling at Purdue University on a football scholarship. After a month, he left the school and started a career in pro baseball.\n\nChapman hit a robust .336 for the Class B Asheville Tourists in his first pro season. After duplicating that mark in ’29 at Double-A Saint Paul, Chapman made his Yankee debut in 1930.\n\nIn his first big league campaign Chapman played third base and led the league in errors. The following season he switched to the outfield where his speed and strong arm made Chapman an ideal fit.\n\nFrom 1931-1938, Chapman led the league in stolen bases four times and triples once. During that time he hit .309, averaging 104 runs and 90 RBI per season. Chapman made the All Star team in each of the first four years of the game’s existence.\n\nBy the time he retired in 1946, Chapman amassed 1,958 hits, 1,144 runs, 287 steals, a .302 average, and a .383 on-base percentage.\n\nIn the collection is this letter from American League president William Harridge to Hall of Fame executive Ed Barrow. Dated August 16, 1928, the correspondence is regarding the contract status of nine Yankee players. Among them is Chapman.\n\nThe document notes that the 19-year old Chapman is an optional player from Asheville. The information here predates Chapman’s MLB debut by 20 months.\n\nHall of Fame catcher Bill Dickey is also mentioned. The Yankee backstop made his debut the day before the date on the letter.\n\nChapman later managed the Philadelphia Phillies. Despite his stellar playing career, he’s best remembered today for his racist taunts directed at Jackie Robinson as Phils skipper in 1947.\n\nDid Babe Ruth call his shot in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series against the Cubs? Ben Chapman, the Yankees starting right fielder that day was undecided really. Chapman hit seventh in the New York lineup that day and wrote, “He was pointing at Charley (sic) Root who had knocked him down.”\n\nHowever, Chapman wasn’t entirely certain. Later in the letter he writes, “In my opinion, he did not call the sit, but he could have.”\n\nNo wonder the debate continues eight decades later. Click here to read letters from other men who were there including Cubs Woody English and Guy Bush as well as New York players Joe Sewell, Frank Crosetti, and Chapman.\n\nFour-time stolen base champion Ben Chapman played in the first four All Star Games from 1933-1937. He holds the distinction of being the first American League batter in All Star play.\n\nThe inaugural Mid Summer Classic was played in Chicago’s Comiskey Park as part of the city’s centennial celebration. The Windy City also played host to the World’s Fair that year.\n\nChapman joined teammates Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Lefty Gomez in the starting lineup. Yankee catcher Bill Dickey and shortstop Tony Lazzeri brough the total of New Yorkers on the roster to six.\n\nGomez retired Pepper Martin, Frankie Frisch, and Chuck Klein in order in the top of the first. The American League came to bat. Up stepped Chapman who swung on the first pitch and grounded out to Cardinals third baseman Martin.\n\nIn 1973 Major League Baseball planned a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the first Mid Summer Classic. All surviving players and coaches of the battle in ’33 were invited to Kansas City to participate. Stars from ’33 game mingled with the stars of ’73 and were introduced before the game. Chapman participated in the festivities.\n\nIn the collection is National League president Chub Feeney‘s invitation to Hank Aaron to play in the ’73 contest. Aaron’s did his part to help the National League win the contest. In the top of the 6th inning, hit a single off of Minnesota’s Bert Blyleven to score Joe Morgan and give the Senior Circuit a 2-1 lead.\n\nHis squad never looked back, winning the game 7-1. Aaron’s base hit saddled Blyleven with the loss in his first All Star appearance."
