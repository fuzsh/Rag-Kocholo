        "text": "Ben Chapman, a former New York Yankee outfielder whose quickness of temper matched his quickness afoot and at bat over a 15-year major league career, died yesterday at his home in Hoover, Ala., a suburb of Birmingham. He was 84.\n\nThe cause of death apparently was a heart attack, a family member said.\n\nA .302 career hitter, Chapman, who stole 287 bases during a period in baseball when base-stealing was not the weapon it is today, often spoke his mind on the field. He was contentious with teammates, opponents and umpires, and was temporarily banned from organized baseball in 1943 after striking an umpire. At the time, Chapman was player-manager manager of the Richmond team in the Piedmont League.\n\nIn April 1947, while managing the Philadelphia Phillies, Chapman was chastised by the baseball commissioner, Happy Chandler, for racist-baiting of Jackie Robinson at Ebbets Field soon after Robinson broke the big leagues' color barrier.\n\nAs the center fielder for the Yankees next to Babe Ruth in right field, Chapman once told Ruth, then baseball's highest paid player at $80,000 a year, \"If you were paid as much as you're worth you'd be making less than I am.\"\n\nChapman's major league career began in 1930 with the powerful Yankees and ended in 1948 when he was dismissed as manager of the forlorn Phillies. During the war years of 1944 and 1945, he compiled an 8-6 record as a right-handed pitcher for the Dodgers.\n\nHe also played the outfield for the Washington Senators, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox and the Phillies, whom he managed for nearly four seasons with a 196-276 record.\n\nAs a Yankee from 1930-35, Chapman never batted lower than .289. For three straight seasons, from 1931-33, he led the American League in stolen bases, something he did again in 1937. He stole 61 bases for the Yankees in 1931.\n\nPartly to allow Joe DiMaggio to become their regular center fielder, the Yankees traded Chapman to Washington in 1936.\n\nChapman played for the American League in the All-Star Game four times.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ola, and two sons, William and Robert, of Birmingham."
