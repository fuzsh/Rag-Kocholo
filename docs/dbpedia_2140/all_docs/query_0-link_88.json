        "text": "This year, because of the length of the post, I decided to split the real and fictional events of Christmas Day up.\n\nDecember 25, in the 753rd year since the founding of the city of Rome – or so Dionysius Exiguus, working in AD 525, would have us believe – Yeshua ben Yoseph was born in Bethlehem, in what is now the West Bank, Palestinian Territories.\n\nIn Greek, his name (of which Joshua and Isaiah are also derivatives) became \"Jesus.\" \"Christ\" is also a Greek word: \"Christos\" means \"the anointed one.\"\n\nBased on historical and astronomical evidence, and even passages in the Gospels themselves, this date is almost certainly incorrect. Besides, Jesus appears to be one of the last people in human history who would be concerned about people remembering his birthday. He'd rather we were good to each other.\n\nDecember 25, 274: Christmas is still a minor celebration in Rome, not an official holiday. Instead, Emperor Aurelian dedicates a temple for Sol Invictus: \"The Unconquered Sun.\" Previously, the Romans had called the god of the Sun \"Apollo,\" and the Greeks had called him \"Helios\" -- although, in modern pop culture (such as on the Star Trek episode \"Who Mourns for Adonais?\"), even when he's depicted as a Greek god, he's usually called Apollo.\n\nThe name Sol Invictus has passed into history, although in 1888, British poet William Ernest Henley published a poem titled \"Invictus,\" with its classic closing lines, \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\" Which would seem to fly in the face of any religion.\n\nDecember 25, AD 336: The 1st recorded Christmas celebration in Rome occurs. Emperor Constantine the Great had legalized Christianity with the Edict of Milan in 313, and called the Council of Nicaea in 325.\n\nDecember 25, AD 597: Augustine of Canterbury -- considered the 1st Archbishop of Canterbury, the founder of the Catholic Church in England, and not to be confused with St. Augustine (Augustine of Hippo) -- leads priests to baptize more than 10,000 Anglo-Saxons in Kent.\n\nDecember 25, AD 800: Charles the Great (a.k.a. Charles Le Magne, Charlemagne and Carolus Magnus) is crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome. Not that there was much about him that was holy.\n\nDecember 25, AD 820: Emperor Leo V of the Byzantine Empire is assassinated inside the Hagia Sophia, the cathedral in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), by supporters of a rival, who becomes Emperor Michael II.\n\nThe new Emperor also orders the exile of Leo's mother and wife, and the castration and exile of Leo's 4 sons, to end Leo's family line and prevent descendants from trying to retake the throne. One of the sons dies soon thereafter, while the others live out their lives in exile.\n\nDecember 25, 1000: The Kingdom of Hungary is founded by King Stephen I.\n\nDecember 25, 1065: Westminster Abbey is consecrated in London. But the King of England, Edward the Confessor, who ordered and funded its building, is too ill to attend, and dies early the next year. Which leads us to…\n\nDecember 25, 1066: William, Duke of Normandy, a.k.a. William the Bastard and William the Conqueror, is crowned King William I of England at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAs the saying goes, never go into battle with a man called \"the Bastard,\" because he's probably got a chip on his shoulder. And never go into battle with a man called \"the Conqueror,\" because, chances are, he earned that nickname.\n\nDecember 25, 1184: In Santa Claus, A Biography, historian Gerry Bowler notes that the Yule Log was one of the most widespread Christmas traditions in early modern Europe, with the first recording of its appearance dating to this time.\n\nBowler notes that the tradition's roots are debated -- some saying it is an \"enfeebled version of the ancient Celtic human sacrifices\" and others saying it's simply related to a feudal obligation of acquiring firewood.\n\nNevertheless, the log was a huge block, lasting for the Twelve Days of Christmas, and it was not burned completely its first year: part of it was saved to light the following year's Yule Log. While the mostly burned wood waited for its duty to light a new Yule Log, it was kept around the house to ward off a range of misfortunes, including toothaches, mildew, lightning, housefires, hail and chilblains (an inflammation of small blood vessels brought on from exposure to cold).\n\nDecember 25, 1492: La Santa María de la Inmaculada Concepción -- The Holy Mary of the Immaculate Conception -- runs aground in what's now Cap-Haïtien, Haiti.\n\nSeeing that his flagship is irretrievably damaged, Christopher Columbus orders his men to strip the timbers from the ship. The timbers were later used to build a fort which Columbus called La Navidad (Nativity, or Christmas), at Limonade. Today, it is part of Université D'Etat D'Haiti, Campus Roi Henri Christophe.\n\nDespite several claims over the last 500 years or so, the wreck of the Santa María has never been found. The Pinta would also be wrecked on the return voyage. TheNiña made it back to Spain, and made a trading voyage to Venezuela in 1501, but nothing further is recorded of her.\n\nDecember 25, 1526: King Henry VIII orders that the main course of his Christmas feast be not a goose, which was traditional in England, but a turkey, a bird first brought to England that year. The 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII, with Charles Laughton in the title role, popularized the image of the Tudor monarch as a fat old guy gorging himself, with a turkey leg in his hand, even though he would have been just 35 at this point.\n\nTurkeys became popular feast meals in England because they didn't have the usefulness of traditional English livestock: Cows for milk and chickens for eggs. But up until the 1950s, a goose remained the traditional bird for the feast. A Christmas Carol, published in 1843, had Ebenezer Scrooge include as part of his redemption the ordering of the biggest goose in a butcher shop to be sent to the Crachit family. There's also an old song, going back at least that far:\n\nChristmas is coming.\n\nThe goose is getting fat.\n\nPlease put a penny\n\nin an old man's hat.\n\nIf you have no penny\n\na ha'penny (half-penny) will do.\n\nIf you have no ha'penny\n\nthen God bless you!\n\nOther countries have their variations on Christmas dinner. Some English-speaking countries serve ham, which is also popular (as \"hamón\") in Spanish-speaking countries, including Mexico and the Philippines. Some use chicken: India, and the Japanese began a tradition of going to Kentucky Fried Chicken on Christmas Day in the 1970s. Northern Italy uses poultry, while Southern Italy uses lamb or fish.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, including Poland (where the meal is held on Christmas Eve and is known as Wigilia, \"vigil\") and Austria, fried fish is often the meal of choice. Seafood is also common in French-speaking places, including Québec and New Orelans: The meal is called réveillon, or \"waking,\" because you stay awake until midnight on Christmas Eve, and then the meal is served after midnight, when it's the 25th. Portuguese-speaking places, including Brazil, also tend to use fish.\n\nAnd in Britain, the meal ends with a pudding -- but it's not what Americans call \"pudding,\" be it chocolate, rice or tapioca. Whether black pudding, white pudding, Yorkshire pudding, bread pudding, blood pudding, or, celebrated in song, figgy pudding, it's a cake -- often recognizable to Americans as a \"fruitcake.\"\n\nAnd if you don't like fruitcake -- especially if you remember Johnny Carson's joke that there is only one fruitcake, and it gets eternally passed around -- well, do what I did when confronted with that other English classic, fish and chips, as an adult: Presume that you didn't like it as a child because you'd never had it prepared and served the right way, and try it. You'll like it.\n\nDecember 25, 1584: Princess Margaret of Austria is born in Graz, later to be the hometown of Arnold Schwarzenegger. She married King Philip III of Spain, and was thus Queen of Spain from 1598 until her death in 1611, from complications of childbirth, her 8th.\n\nShe was the mother of King Philip IV of Spain, Anne of Austria (later Queen of France under King Louis XIII, and mother of King Louis XIV), and Maria Anna of Spain (later Empress of Emperor Ferdinand III of the Holy Roman Empire).\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1620: The Plymouth Pilgrims spend their 1st Christmas Day in the New World building their 1st structure in the New World, thus demonstrating their complete contempt for celebrating the birth of Jesus. To the Puritans, in America and in England, it was the death and Resurrection that mattered, not the birth.\n\nDecember 25, 1635: Samuel de Champlain, the explorer known as \"the Father of New France,\" dies from the effects of a stroke, at the city he founded, Québec -- which is still a capital, of the Province of Québec. He was 61.\n\nDecember 25, 1642: Isaac Newton is born in Wolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, in the north of England. And, from what I've heard of his personality, Sir Isaac could be considered, as they say in English \"football,\" a Dirty Northern Bastard. In other words, if you messed with him, clearly (Don't say it, Mike!) you didn't understand (Don't say it!) the gravity of the situation. (He said it... )\n\nActually, since England had not yet adopted the Gregorian Calendar, Newton spent his whole life believing that he was born on December 25, 1642, but science (which he did so much to advance) now shows him to have been born on January 4, 1643.\n\nDecember 25, 1643: Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean is found and named by Captain William Mynors of the English East India Company vessel, the Royal Mary.\n\nDecember 25, 1647: The Puritan-led English Parliament bans the celebration of Christmas, considering it \"a popish festival with no biblical justification,\" and \"a time of wasteful and immoral behavior.\" They replace it with a day of fasting, although no one seems to have had the guts to tell Oliver Cromwell, \"Um, yeah, real quick? That sounds like Yom Kippur. A Jewish holiday.\"\n\nProtests followed, as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities. For weeks, Canterbury was controlled by rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans.\n\nThe bookThe Vindication of Christmas, published in 1652, argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions: Dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with \"plow-boys\" and \"maidservants,\" carol singing, and old Father Christmas, the English version of St. Nicholas, who still bears as much of a resemblance to an old bishop as he does to the figure we have come to know as Santa Claus.\n\nDecember 25, 1659: Christmas observance is outlawed in Boston. By this point, New Amsterdam (present-day New York) was a fully-functioning Dutch city, and, though also Protestant, celebrated Christmas. This is not the source of that classic New York phrase \"Boston sucks,\" but, if the New World Dutch knew what was going on up in Boston, they would have understood the sentiment.\n\nDecember 25, 1660: The Restoration of King Charles II ends England's ban on celebrating Christmas. Poor Robin's Almanackcontained these lines:\n\nNow thanks to God for Charles' return\n\nWhose absence made old Christmas mourn\n\nFor then we scarcely did it know\n\nWhether it Christmas were or no.\n\nDecember 25, 1681: The Puritan ban on Christmas in Boston is finally revoked, by the English-appointed governor, Edmund Andros. However, it would not be until the middle of the 19th Century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1717: Giovanni Angelo Braschi is born in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The son of a count, in 1775 he was elected Pope, taking the name Pius VI. He was Pope throughout the War of the American Revolution, and oversaw the establishment of the 1st Archdiocese in the new nation, that of Baltimore, as Maryland, named for St. Mary, was the one State founded by Catholics. (Most of the places in this country founded by Catholic Frenchmen and Spaniards did not become States until taken by the English or the post-independence Americans.)\n\nPope Pius VI condemned the French Revolution, for suppressing the Gallican Church. This did not please Napoleon Bonaparte, and he sent troops to occupy the Papal States in 1796. Pius refused to renounce the throne, and in 1798 he was arrested, brought to France, and imprisoned in Valence, dying there a year later.\n\nOddly, despite what can be argued was having been martyred for his faith, the Church has made no move to canonize him.\n\nDecember 25, 1719: \"Joy to the World\" debuts. Isaac Watts wrote the lyrics, and Georg Friedrich Händel wrote the melody.\n\nDecember 25, 1739: \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" debuts. It was written by Charles Wesley, brother of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, and both brothers were prolific composers of hymns.\n\nCharles' original opening lines were, \"Hark! how all the welkin rings / Glory to the King of Kings.\" Eventually, he changed this to, \"Hark! the herald angels sing / Glory to the newborn King.\"\n\nDecember 25, 1744: John Francis Wade debuts his carol, written in Latin: \"Adeste Fidelis.\" In 1841, an English priest named Frederick Oakeley wrote English lyrics: \"O Come, All Ye Faithful.\"\n\nDecember 25, 1757: Benjamin Pierce is born in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, outside Lowell. A hero of the American Revolution, he served as Governor of New Hampshire twice between 1827 and 1830. His son, Franklin Pierce, served New Hampshire in both houses of Congress, and was the 14th President of the United States (serving from March 4, 1853 to March 4, 1857). Benjamin died in 1839, having lived long enough to see Franklin elected to the Senate.\n\nIt is unknown if, when naming the character based on himself \"Benjamin Franklin Pierce,\" Dr. Richard Hornberger (writing the book M*A*S*H: A Novel About Three Army Doctors under the name Richard Hooker) knew that Franklin Pierce's father was named Benjamin, although as a native of neighboring Maine, he might have known. (Franklin Pierce did go to Bowdoin College in Maine.)\n\nDecember 25, 1760: \"God Rest You, Merry Gnetlemen\" (or \"God Rest Ye... \") debuts in print, with lyrics by James Nares, although the melody goes back to at least the 16th Century.\n\nDecember 25, 1776: George Washington, under cover of darkness, leads the Continental Army across the Delaware River. The next morning, when he's gotten all his troops across to the New Jersey side, he marches them 9 miles down the road, over which State Route 29 would eventually be built, and attacks the Hessians, German mercenaries fighting for Britain, who are sleeping off their Christmas revelry. Thus is won the Battle of Trenton, thus keeping the Patriot cause alive in the War of the American Revolution.\n\nThis crossing is memorialized in an 1851 painting by, with some irony, a German-born American, Emmanuel Leutze. In a further irony, the British got their revenge: In World War II, the Royal Air Force destroyed the original painting, by bombing its location, the Kunsthalle art museum in Bremen. Leutze also painted a copy that hangs in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nBut, like Jacques-Louis David's portrait of Napoleon, on a horse rearing back, leading his troops over the Alps, the painting is factually incorrect and logistically ridiculous. Just as Bonaparte, a brilliant military tactician, would have ridden a mule over the mountains (and there is a painting depicting that), a smart military veteran like Washington would never have stood up in his boat. It would have made him too easy a target, and it might have made the boat tip over.\n\nThe Pennsylvania location of the start of the crossing, then known as Taylorsville, is now known as Washington Crossing, in the Township of Upper Makefield. The New Jersey location where it finished is now known as Ewing, after one of Washington's aides, General James Ewing.\n\nAmong those who took part in the crossing were some future legends of American statecraft:\n\n* Alexander Hamilton, Washington's Secretary of the Treasury and, in a way, the father of American conservatism.\n\n* Henry Knox, Washington's Secretary of War, for whom the Kentucky army base and gold depository Fort Knox and the seat of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is named.\n\n* John Marshall, the longest-serving and most influential Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n* And James Monroe, 5th President of the United States, and who, under 4th President James Madison during the War of 1812, had the unenviable task of serving as Secretary of State and War (Defense) at the same time, probably doing his country a greater service in that war than he did in the Revolution or his Presidency.\n\nMonroe, who was 25 at the time, is often cited as the young man sitting behind Washington in the painting, holding the flag. That's another error: If any flags made the crossing, they would have been kept hidden, so as not to give their bearers away. Washington was a big believer in the element of surprise, hence the night crossing.\n\nDecember 25, 1777: British Captain James Cook visits an island that he names Christmas Island. This is not the same place cited in the 1643 entry. The U.S. takes possession of it in 1856, but it goes back to Britain. In 1979, it becomes part of the newly independent nation of Kiribati -- pronounced \"Kiribass\" in the natives' language. The island is renamed \"Kiritimati,\" but it is still pronounced \"Christmas.\"\n\nDecember 25, 1799: Augustinam Hejnek is born in Germany, although it's not clear where. In 1870, at age 70, \"Augusta\" Hejnek moved to Chicago. Eventually, she moved to Casimir, Wisconsin, where she died on March 1, 1908, at age 108. She is believed to have been the last surviving person born in the 18th Century.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1806: A riot occurs in Lower Manhattan -- or what would have been considered \"Midtown\" at the time. Fifty members of the Hide Binders, a nativist gang of apprentices and propertyless journeyman butchers, gathers outside St. Peter's Church at 22 Barclay Street, to taunt Catholic worshipers leaving Midnight Mass.\n\nThe watch prevented a serious disorder on the Eve, but on Christmas Day, Irishmen fearing a Hide Binder attack armed themselves with cudgels, stones and brickbats. A skirmish breaks out, a watchman is killed, and the Hide Binders invade the Irishtown. The riot only ends when magistrates are able to restore order.\n\nThe only people to get arrested were Irish -- a far cry from the post-Civil War era, by which point the vast majority of the NYPD was Irish, and it remained so well into the 20th Century.\n\nTraditionally, new groups have always been viewed suspiciously by the establishment in America. The Irish, the Germans, the blacks, the Jews, the Italians, the Chinese, the Hispanics, and in more recent times the Arabs and South Asians have all, against their will, taken their turns as the targeted group.\n\nIn the early days of the United States, Irish Catholics were particularly targeted and barred from holding office through a series of laws and requirements, such as a 1777 naturalization clause. The 1806 Christmas Riots occurred less than a year following the election of the 1st Irish Catholic member to the New York State Assembly.\n\nDecember 25, 1815: The Handel and Haydn Society, the oldest continually operating performing arts organization in America, hosts its 1st performance, at King's Chapel in Boston. Given that Handel had written \"Joy to the World,\" this is appropriate.\n\nDecember 25, 1818, 200 years ago: \"Silent Night\" is first performed, at (appropriately enough) the Church of St. Nicholas in Oberndorf, a town outside Salzburg, on the Galzach River which separates Austria from Germany. (If you don't count Salzburg as a major city, the closest is Munich to the west, not Vienna to the east.)\n\nFather Joseph Mohr (1792-1848) wrote the lyrics (in German: \"Stille Nacht\"), and Franz Gruber (1787-1863) composed the melody. That's Franz Gruber -- not Hans Gruber, the German terrorist played by Alan Rickman in Die Hard, a film that took place on Christmas Eve 1988.\n\nDecember 25, 1821: Clara Barton is born in Oxford, Massachusetts, outside Worcester. She goes on to found the American Red Cross. She lived on until 1912.\n\nDecember 25, 1822: Clement Clarke Moore, a theologian in New York, is asked by his children if there are any books about Santa Claus. He decides to find out, but discovers that no bookstore in town has any such book.\n\nSo he writes his own version of the story, \"A Visit from St. Nicholas,\" which establishes so much of the Santa Claus legend that we know today. The story is published the following year. Moore was born in 1779 and lived until 1863.\n\nDecember 25, 1823: \"The First Noel\" makes its debut, written by Davies Gilbert.\n\nDecember 25, 1826: The Eggnog Riot, a.k.a. the Grog Mutiny, takes place at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Among the cadets who took part, but was not punished, was Jefferson Davis, future U.S. Senator from Mississippi. He later served as Secretary of War under the aforementioned Franklin Pierce, and President of the Confederate States of America. Twenty cadets were court-martialed.\n\nNo. I am not making that up. There was an Eggnog Riot at West Point.\n\nDecember 25, 1831: The Great Jamaican Slave Revolt, also known as the Baptist War or the Christmas Rebellion, begins, led by the Reverend Samuel Sharpe. Up to 20 percent of Jamaica's slaves, 60,000 of them, mobilize. By January 4, British forces under the control of the inaptly-named Sir Willoughby Cotton put the rebellion down.\n\nThe \"plantocracy\" retaliates by killing 207 slaves during the revolt, and over 300 more through executions, including some for minor offenses such as theft. This infuriated the colonists' masters back in London, and the process of emancipation began. In 1838, slavery was banned in Jamaica.\n\nDecember 25, 1835: Orville Elias Babcock is born in Franklin, Vermont. He went to West Point, and graduated 3rd in the Class of 1861. He was an aide to General Ulysses S. Grant during and after the American Civil War, and when Grant became President, he named Babcock his Secretary -- in modern terms, his White House Chief of Staff.\n\nThis was a mistake. He was indicted in 1875 as part of the Whiskey Ring, and again in 1876 as part of the Safe Burglary Committee. Both times, Grant's testimony gained him an acquittal, but damaged Grant's reputation. But the acquittals enabled him to serve as Inspector of Lighthouses in Florida under succeeding Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield and Chester Arthur. He died in 1884, still holding that job.\n\nDecember 25, 1837: The Battle of Lake Okeechobee is fought in Florida, as part of the Second Seminole War. The Seminoles, under the command of Holata Micco (known to the U.S. government as Billy Bowlegs), defeats U.S. troops under the command of Colonel Zachary Taylor.\n\nThe problem was that Taylor's subcommander, Colonel Richard Gentry, was too timid to face the enemy, and was one of the American soldiers killed. Taylor's report back to Washington said so, and he was promoted to Brigadier General, and won the nickname \"Old Rough and Ready.\" Though he lost the battle, it put him on the path to become the leading U.S. hero of the Mexican-American War of 1846-47, and to be elected President in 1848.\n\nEventually, the U.S. Army would win the war, and force the resettlement of the Seminoles to \"the Indian Territory,\" present-day Oklahoma. Nonetheless, the name survives in Florida's Seminole County, and in the name of the sports teams at Florida State University, the Seminoles.\n\nHolata Micco would live on until 1859, long enough to visit Washington, and to see a portrait of Taylor, who died in office in 1850, in the Capitol Building. Recognizing his old opponent, he pointed and said, \"Me whip!\"\n\nDecember 25, 1843, 175 years ago: With Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol having debuted earlier in the year, art shop owner Henry Cole prints up the first Christmas cards, costing one shilling each -- rather expensive by the standards of the time. But the debut in 1840 of the penny post -- a stamp costing 1 penny, 1/240th of a pound sterling at the time, could get your letter sent anywhere in the United Kingdom -- made the mailing, and thus the popularization, of Christmas cards possible.\n\nDecember 25, 1847: \"Minuit, Chretiens\" debuts, written in French by Adolphe Adam. In 1855, Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight wrote English lyrics, making it \"O Holy Night.\"\n\nIn 1973, Harry Chapin would write \"Mr. Tanner,\" and his bass guitarist, John Wallace, would sing the song as the title character -- as Harry wrote, \"He did not know how well he sang, it just made him whole\" -- even though the song \"Mr. Tanner\" makes no mention of Christmas itself.\n\nDecember 25, 1849: \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\" debuts, written by Edmund Sears, pastor of a Unitarian Church in the Boston suburb of Wayland, Massachusetts.\n\nAlso on this day, James Rees, a Christian missionary from Philadelphia, publishes the short story \"A Christmas legend.\" This is the 1st literature to explicitly say that Santa Claus has a wife.\n\nTwo years later, the Yale Literary Magazine prints a story that gives Mrs. Claus a name -- sort of. She's listed as simply \"Mrs. Santa Claus.\" In 1889, Katharine Lee Bates, composer of \"American the Beautiful,\" published the poem \"Goody Santa Claus On a Sleigh Ride\" -- \"Goody\" being short for \"Goodwife,\" an old New England term with the same meaning as \"Mrs.\" This fleshed out her character as a bespectacled, chubby old woman.\n\nShe has since become part of the legend, helped by the Rankin-Bass TV specials, from 1964 and Rudolph onward. Yet she is rarely given a first name. In Rankin-Bass' 1970 special Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, she is Jessica. In 1985's Santa Claus: The Movie, she is Anya. In the 2011 animated Arthur Christmas, she is Margaret.\n\nDecember 25, 1851: James J. Thomson is born in Annan, Dumfries, Scotland. A halfback, he was one of the founding players for Glasgow soccer team Queen's Park, who stood as the Scotland national team in the 1st international soccer game, against England, at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground at Hamilton Crescent, in the Partick section of the west side of Glasgow. The game ended in a 0-0 draw. Thomson lived until 1915.\n\nDecember 25, 1852: Henry Tifft Gage is born in Geneva, in Central New York, grows up in Saginaw, Michigan, and becomes a lawyer in California. He was the State's Governor at the turn of the 20th Century, serving from 1899 to 1903, as a Republican. This included the founding of baseball's Pacific Coast League. He died in 1924.\n\nDecember 25, 1853: \"Good King Wenceslas\" debuts, written by John Mason Neale, who took it from a 13th Century song. The song takes place \"on the feast of Stephen.\" St. Stephen's Day is actually the day after Christmas, December 26, a.k.a. Boxing Day.\n\nDecember 25, 1856: James Francis Galvin is born in St. Louis. The Hall of Fame pitcher was nicknamed \"Pud\" because he was said to have \"reduced hitters to pudding.\" No word on whether it was figgy pudding.\n\nHe won 365 games -- a total topped by only 4 pitchers ever -- for the Buffalo Bisons (who went out of business in 1885) and the Pittsburgh team that would be renamed the Pirates before he retired, in a career that lasted from 1875 to 1892. That career curiously stopped right before the distance from home plate to the pitcher's mound was extended from 50 feet to the now-traditional 60 feet, 6 inches, thus making it harder on pitchers.\n\nA 2006 National Public Radio article refers to Galvin as \"the first baseball player to be widely known for using a performance enhancer.\" The Washington Post reported that Galvin used the Brown-Séquard elixir, which contained monkey testosterone, before a game in 1889. However, no one then seemed bothered by his use of the elixir, and the Post practically endorsed it after the game, saying that Galvin's performance was \"the best proof yet furnished of the value of the discovery.\"\n\nHe was poor, and couldn't afford to take care of himself, and died in 1902. He was only 45 years old. I can't find a reference to the cause of his death, so I can neither confirm nor deny that the steroid he took had anything to do with it.\n\nDecember 25, 1857: The most familiar Christmas song of all debuts, even though its lyrics have nothing to do with Christmas, and it was originally intended for the earlier holiday of Thanksgiving. James Lord Pierpoint, of the Boston suburb of Medford, Massachusetts, published it under the title of \"One Horse Open Sleigh\" -- not \"Shay,\" as my mother always told me was correct. By 1859, it was better known as \"Jingle Bells.\"\n\nAlso debuting is \"We Three Kings,\" written by the Rev. John Henry Hopkins Jr., the rector of Christ Episcopal Church in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He wrote it for a Christmas pageant in Manhattan.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1862: Two of the most familiar Christmas songs debut. One is \"Angels We Have Heard On High,\" written by James Chadwick, then Bishop of Hexam and Newcastle in the North-East of England.\n\nThe other is \"Deck the Hall,\" which later became \"Deck the Halls.\" The melody dates to 16th Century Wales, and was written in the Welsh language, Cyrmraeg. The English lyrics were written by Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant.\n\nDecember 25, 1864: Thomas W. Cahill -- I can find no record of what the W stands for -- is born in Manhattan, and grows up in St. Louis. He loved baseball and track, but when a soccer team from Toronto visited St. Louis, he got hooked on the sport.\n\nOn April 5, 1913, at the Astor House hotel in New York, Tom Cahill founded the United States Football Association, which later became and remains the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), the governing body of American soccer. He served as its 1st Executive Secretary, until 1921, when he left to merge 2 regional leagues into the American Soccer League. The Great Depression killed it in 1931, and he died in 1951, forgotten.\n\nHe would later be elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, and should be remembered as the father of American soccer.\n\nDecember 25, 1865: William Chatterton Dix writes Christmas-themed lyrics to the familiar song \"Greensleeves,\" turning it into \"What Child Is This?\"\n\nThis was also the Christmas season featuring the debut in published form of \"Go Tell It On the Mountain,\" an African-American spiritual, included in a book of songs published by John Wesley Work Jr. (He did not claim authorship for himself, suggesting that it predates his own lifetime.) His son, John Wesley Work III, was also a well-known black songwriter in his time. Neither, though, was related to a popular white folksinger and writer of the time, Henry Clay Work.\n\n\"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" would also be the title of James Baldwin's 1st novel, published in 1953. The song would regain popularity in 1963, when it was recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary. Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel would include it on their all-acoustic 1st album in 1964, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\n\nAlso on this day, Fay Templeton is born in Little Rock, Arkansas. She was a prominent American stage actress of the turn of the 20th Century.\n\nDecember 25, 1868: In one of his last official acts as President, Andrew Johnson pardons all Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War, for any crimes they may have committed against the United States.\n\nThis date is also the Christmas debut of \"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\" written by Phillips Brooks, then rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Philadelphia.\n\nDecember 25, 1870: This was the 1st year in which December 25 was officially a federal holiday in America, thanks to a bill passed by Congress, and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nAlso on this day, Chaja Rubinstein is born in Krakow, Poland. Better known as Helena Rubinstein, she becomes a cosmetics tycoon, and lives on until 1965. Those of us who grew up on PBS' childrens' programming in the 1970s and '80s know her name from the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which contributed funding for Sesame Street, The Electric Company, et al.\n\nDecember 25, 1871: Reading Football Club is founded in Reading, Berkshire, England. They played at Elm Park from 1896 to 1999, and since then at the 24,161-seat Madejski Stadium.\n\n\"The Royals\" have not been particularly successful. They have won England's 4th division once, its 3rd division 3 times, and its 2nd division twice, but their best 1st division finish has been 8th place in 2007. Their best finish in the FA Cup has been the Semifinals, in 1927 and 2015, although they've gotten to at least the Quarterfinals 6 times, including 4 times since 2010. Their best finish in the League Cup is the Quarterfinals in 1996 and 1998.\n\nThey won the Football league Third Division South Cup in 1938, the London War Cup in 1941, and the Full Members Cup in 1988. This was a competition created after English clubs were banned from European play after the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, to give them some extra competition. It lasted a little longer than the ban did, until 1992.\n\nDecember 25, 1875: \"Young Tom Morris,\" an early golf legend, and the son of an early golf legend known as Old Tom Morris, dies in his native St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland. He is only 24. He had recently played a match in terrible weather, and probably caught pneumonia.\n\nAlthough it would be a Scotsman, Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, it would be decades before it could have saved Young Tom, who had also recently lost his wife and child in childbirth, and, between his grief and his illness, may have lost the will to live.\n\nOld Tom Morris, born in 1821, lived on until 1908. St. Andrews, home of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and the site of 27 British Opens (but never, as yet, a Ryder Cup), is still \"the Home of Golf,\" partly because of the legacy of the Tom Morrises.\n\nDecember 25, 1876: Muhammad Ali Jinnah is born in Karachi, British India. He becomes the founder of the nation of Pakistan in 1947, but lives only a year after its establishment.\n\nDecember 25, 1877: Henry Judah Trihey is born in Berlin (now Kitchener), Ontario. A center, Harry Trihey won the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Shamrocks in 1899 and 1900. Regarded as the best forward of his era, he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and died in 1942.\n\nDecember 25, 1878, 140 years ago: Louis Chevrolet is born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. A pioneer of auto racing, he founded the car company that bears his name. Which may also make his company the source of Eartha Kitt's Christmas 1953 request: \"Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue.\" He did not live to hear that song, dying in 1941.\n\nDecember 25, 1882: \"Away in a Manger\" debuts. Its composer is William J. Kirkpatrick.\n\nDecember 25, 1884: Evelyn Nesbit is born outside Pittsburgh in Tarentum, Pennsylvania. She became a popular Broadway actress after getting on the \"casting couch\" of architect, and friend of theater producers, Stanford White.\n\nAfter marrying playboy Harry Thaw, a fellow Pittsburgher, she saw Thaw murder White, in the roof garden of the second Madison Square Garden (which White had designed), on June 25, 1906, resulting in \"the Trial of the Century,\" making her the most familiar woman in America thanks to the era's \"yellow journalism.\"\n\nHer life was a disaster after that. Before her death in 1967, she said of the only man she truly loved, \"Stanny White died. My fate was worse: I lived.\"\n\nDecember 25, 1886: According to club legend, a meeting of workers of the Dial Square Shop of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, Kent (now part of Southeast London) is held at the nearby Royal Oak pub. The men involved had played football under the name Dial Square 2 weeks earlier, on December 11, defeating Eastern Wanderers 6-0 at Millwall's ground on the Isle of Dogs.\n\nNow, the legend says, they formalize themselves, calling themselves Royal Arsenal Football Club. They will play their home games at the Manor Ground in nearby Plumstead.\n\nWe now know, thanks to research by the Arsenal History Society, that this story is not true. They uncovered a publication dated January 2, 1887, with an advertisement seeking matches under the Dial Square F.C. name, meaning that the change of name to Royal Arsenal had not occurred. But on January 8, just 6 days later, they used the Royal Arsenal name in a 6-1 win over Erith at Plumstead Common, not far from the Royal Arsenal itself.\n\nThey would turn professional in 1893, necessitating a name change, since a professional sports team was not permitted to have \"royal\" in its name. So they renamed themselves for their locality: Woolwich Arsenal. In 1913, they moved across the River Thames to the Highbury section of North London, and became simply Arsenal Football Club.\n\nWhen they play at home right before Christmas, their fans are known to sing, \"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! Santa is an Arsenal fan, and at Highbury today!\" This is despite the fact that, in 2006, they moved from the old Arsenal Stadium, nicknamed Highbury, and into the Emirates Stadium. When their last game before Christmas is on the road, the fans sing, \"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! Oh what fun it is to see The Arsenal win away!\"\n\nDecember 25, 1887: Conrad Nicholson Hilton is born in Socorro County, New Mexico Territory -- it wouldn't become a State until 1912. Sadly, the hotel icon, who lived until 1979, is now best known for his socialite great-granddaughters, Paris and Nicky. He was recently played by Chelcie Ross on Mad Men. (You may remember Ross as the hypocritical grizzled veteran pitcher in Major League.)\n\nAlso on this day, Glenfiddich single malt Scotch whiskey is first produced. Merry Christmas, indeed. Of course, this may also bring us back to the subject of the Hilton sisters.\n\nDecember 25, 1889: Royal Arsenal play on Christmas Day for the 1st time, at the Manor Ground. They defeat Preston Hornets 5-0.\n\nAlso on this day, Lila Bell Acheson is born in Virdon, Manitoba, Canada. In 1921, she married DeWitt Wallace, born 6 weeks before she was. In 1922, they founded Reader's Digest magazine. He lived until 1981, she until 1984.\n\nDecember 25, 1890: Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical College is founded in Stillwater, a year after the former Indian Territory was taken over and settled by white people. In 1907, with the coming of Statehood, it became Oklahoma A&M. In 1958, the name was changed to Oklahoma State University.\n\nThe school was known for a basketball team that won the 1944 and 1945 National Championships under coach Henry Iba, and for building perhaps the greatest college wrestling program. Its football team has been considerably less successful.\n\nOSU athletes have included: Baseball players Allie Reynolds, Joe Horlen, Jerry Adair, Gary WArd, Robin Ventura, Mickey Tettleton, Pete Incaviglia, Jeromy Burnitz, Matt Holliday, Josh Fields, and Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell; football players Sonny Keys, Walt Garrison, Jim Turner, Jerry Sherk, Dexter Manley, Thurman Thomas, Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders, Leslie O'Neal, Charlie Johnson, Jason Gildon and Dez Bryant, and coach Buddy Ryan (Rex' father); basketball players, Bob Kurland, John Starks, Bryant Reeves and Joey Graham, Kansas coach Bill Self, and Don Haskins, coach of the 1966 National Champion Texas Western (now Texas-El Paso) team; and the current wrestling coach, Olympic Gold Medalist John Smith. And, if you count golf, Bob Tway, Rickie Fowler and Scott Verplank.\n\nOther alumni include: Oklahoma Senators Henry Bellmon, Don Nickles and Tom Coburn; Governors Bellmon and Mary Fallin; astronaut Stuart Roosa; oilman T. Boone Pickens, who donated enough money to the school to get the football stadium named after him; law professor and political figure Anita Hill; Dick Tracy creator Chester Gould; singers Hoyt Axton and Garth Brooks; and actors Gary Busey and James Marsden. It's also the alma mater of fictional character Ellie Bishop, part of the Special Agent team on CBS' drama NCIS.\n\nAlso on this day, in Lancashire, England, soccer hooliganism, if not \"invented,\" is first exposed to a wide audience. Blackburn Rovers play a home match at Ewood Park against nearby team Darwen. Rovers were due to play West Midlands club Wolverhampton Wanderers the following day, Boxing Day, and so they field a weakened team. This infuriates the Blackburn fans, particularly as ticket prices had been increased for the game.\n\nWhen the Darwen team appears, the fans urge them to leave the pitch, which they do, later re-emerging with their second eleven. Eventually, Blackburn and Darwen fans invade the pitch, pulling up the goal posts and threatening to wreck the press box. The police intervene, and finally manage to control the situation.\n\nAlso on this day, Robert LeRoy Ripley is born in Santa Rosa, California. Yes, he was born on a Christmas Day – believe it or not!\n\nActually, a lot of the items he put in Ripley's Believe It Or Not were stone-cold lies that he just liked. But some of them were true. He died in 1949.\n\nDecember 25, 1891: Royal Arsenal come from a 3-0 deficit to draw 3-3 with Sheffield United, at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, Yorkshire.\n\nDecember 25, 1893, 125 years ago: The newly-professional, newly-in-the-Football-League, newly-renamed Woolwich Arsenal host Burslem Port Vale, later just \"Port Vale.\" Today, they are the only 2 teams in the 92-team Football League who are not named after a specific locality. Arsenal win, 4-1.\n\nDecember 25, 1894: In a manner of speaking, the 1st holiday-season college bowl game is played on this day. Certainly, it was the 1st game between teams from 2 different parts of the country. And it was the 2 men most responsible for the development of American football who set it up and opposed each other in it.\n\nWalter Camp had been one of the 1st great college football players, at Yale University in the late 1870s. In 1888, he became Yale's head coach, and one of his players on that great team was Amos Alonzo Stagg. Between them, they invented pretty much every feature that turned American football from a game resembling soccer and rugby to the game that became so popular in the 20th Century.\n\nBoth men went West to start college football programs, Stagg at the University of Chicago, Camp at the newly-founded Stanford University in the San Francisco Bay Area. They played at the Haight Street Grounds in San Francisco. Chicago beat Stanford 24-4.\n\nThe Haight Street Grounds stood from 1887 to 1895. It was actually not at Haight Street, but at the southeastern corner of Stanyan and Waller Streets, in the Haight-Ashbury district that would become the seat of the Hippie movement in the 1960s, at the southeastern corner of Golden Gate Park, about a block from where Kezar Stadium would later be built.\n\nAlso on this day, Woolwich Arsenal again host Burslem Port Vale, and win 7-0. Patrick O'Brien scores 3 goals -- not yet known as a \"hat trick\" in either ice hockey or association football.\n\nDecember 25, 1895: The legend of \"Stagger Lee\" is born. Lee Shelton, a black pimp known as \"Stack\" or \"Stacker\" Lee, ran an, um, entertainment venue called the Four Hundred Club in St. Louis. He and William Lyons, also involved in the St. Louis underworld, were drinking in the Bill Curtis Saloon. They began to argue, and Lyons took Shelton's Stetson hat off his head. For this offense, Shelton shot Lyons, killing him. Shelton was convicted, served 12 years for murder, was imprisoned again for robbery, and died in prison in 1912.\n\nAs early as 1897, during Shelton's trial, the 1st song about the murder was performed. It spread throughout American music, black and white alike, and, depending on the singer's accent, the perpetrator (and thus the title) could be \"Stack-o-Lee,\" \"Stag-o-Lee,\" \"Stacker Lee,\" \"Stagger Lee,\" and so on. The legendary New Orleans pianist Mac \"Dr. John\" Rebennack claimed that there were so many versions, he could sing the song for half an hour and never repeat a verse.\n\nEventually, \"Stagger Lee\" became the best-known version. But the song, as most people know it now, gets the details wrong: In most versions, \"Stagger Lee\" and \"Billy\" are shooting dice in an alley late at night, and Billy, having already won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat, tries to cheat him. So Stagger Lee goes home, gets his gun, goes to the bar, and, despite Billy pleading for his life -- \"I got three little children and a very sickly wife\" -- shoots him.\n\nFred Waring & His Pennsylvanians became the 1st white act to record it, in 1923. Lloyd Price hit Number 1 with it in 1959, but there was a problem: It was on ABC-Paramount Records, and ABC not only owned the label, but aired American Bandstand. That show couldn't have the Number 1 song in the country played for teenagers, on live national daytime television, with the words, \"Stagger Lee shot Billy, oh, he shot that poor boy so bad, 'til the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass!\" (How did it get past 1950s censors in the first place?)\n\nSo they had Lee record a cleaned-up version, in which Billy stole Stagger Lee's girlfriend, but he feels bad and gives her back, and the guys make up, and are both alive at the end. The way to tell the difference at the beginning: In the original version, Price sings, in his New Orleans accent, \"The night was Claire,\" while in the cleaned-up version, he sings it straight, \"The night was clear.\" In both versions, \"the Moon was yellow, and the leaves came tumbling down.\"\n\nAlso on this day, Woolwich Arsenal again host Burslem Port Vale, and win 2-1.\n\nDecember 25, 1896: Woolwich Arsenal host Lincoln City, and win 6-2.\n\nDecember 25, 1897: Actually, the \"Yes, Virginia\" editorial was published in the New York Sun on September 21 of this year. Laura Virginia O'Hanlon was then 8 years old. She married briefly, keeping the name Laura Douglas after her divorce. She had a daughter with her brief husband, got a doctorate from Fordham University, taught in New York's public schools from 1912 to 1935, was a principal from then until 1959, and lived on until 1971, always answering letters from kids who asked about the story.\n\nAlso on this day, Arsenal lose on Christmas for the 1st time. It is against Tottenham Hotspur, then in Middlesex -- the Tottenham area wouldn't be brought into London, North or otherwise, until the municipal boundaries were redrawn in 1963, effective 1965. Until Arsenal moved to North London in 1913, they considered \"Spurs\" to be just another opponent. This time, though, Spurs win, 3-2 at the Manor Ground.\n\nDecember 25, 1899: Humphrey DeForest Bogart is born in Manhattan. Listen, sweetheart, if you don't show some Christmas spirit, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.\n\nBogie died from smoking in 1957, but he may still be the most beloved actor in American history. \"Here's looking at you, kid.\"\n\nAlso on this day, Woolwich Arsenal travel to Lincoln City, and lose 5-0.\n\n*"
