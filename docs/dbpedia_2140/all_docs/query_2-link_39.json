        "text": "A 34-year-old Cheyenne woman is facing a felony charge after allegedly punching her juvenile daughter.\n\nAccording to a booking sheet, police were called to an undisclosed location in Cheyenne around 8:30 p.m. on Monday for a report of child abuse.\n\nCheyenne Woman Accused of Punching Her Juvenile Daughter\n\nAfter speaking to several people on the scene, the responding officer had probable cause to believe Leton Bonificia Cheatham punched her daughter, a child under the age of 18 years.\n\nThe officer says the child had minor injuries to her face which were described as being caused by Cheatham.\n\nCheatham was arrested and subsequently charged with child abuse, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and interference with an emergency call, a misdemeanor.\n\nCheatham made her initial appearance in Laramie County Circuit Court the following morning, during which her bond was set at $3,000 cash and her preliminary hearing was scheduled for Aug. 16, 2024, at 9:45 a.m.\n\nAll suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law."
