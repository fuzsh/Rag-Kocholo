        "meta_description": "In case you were wondering, I definitely listen to a fair bit of mainstream country these days. I try to hear it clearly — my ideological leanings are way over on the left, but there’s a strain of modern country that tempers its love of country life with the kind of hard-won wisdom that you can only get by living in the big, bad city. The March 27 installment of singer Ben Chapman’s multi-artist show Peach Jam features a crew of what you might call exponents of quasi-mainstream country. I’m a fan of the Kentucky-born singer and songwriter Elvie Shane, whose new album Damascus is an immaculately produced and performed look at how living in the pressure cooker of the New New South can, well, screw you up. Producer Oscar Charles gives Shane a deep, ominous sound that’s as innovative as anything I hear in mainstream country, and the songwriting — check out something titled “215634” — matches the sonics. Meanwhile, Chapman channels the Grateful Dead and the eternal verities of hippie country on his 2022 release Make the Night Better. The shadow of novelty country hangs over Corey Smith’s 2023 album Suburban Drawl, which includes two songs about the allure of football. You can hear traces of 1970s soul on Dee White’s 2019 full-length Southern Gentleman, and Dan Auerbach and David Ferguson’s production gives tunes like “Rose of Alabam” a pop-country sheen. Rounding out the bill is South Carolina-born singer Ashland Craft, whose 2021 album Travelin’ Kind combines Southern rock and soul. EDD HURT",
