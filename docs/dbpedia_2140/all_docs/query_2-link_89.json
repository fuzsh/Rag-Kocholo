        "text": "Dear friends and family, My beloved son Peter died from suicide on Thursday (1/26/23). He was 17 years old. We ask that you please pray for our family, neighbors, Riverton High School students and anyone else grieving Peter's death. We are heartbroken beyond words. We pray for the miracle of peace and understanding that can only come from seeking the healing power of Christ's atonement. Peter was extremely intelligent, witty, funny, deep thinking, gifted in the arts, drawing, piano, singing, rapping, and Minecraft. He was a straight A student at Riverton High school, soloist with the Madrigal and A Cappella choirs, an Eagle scout, and more loved and admired than he could ever know or feel. His list of accomplishments is more admirable when you learn that he did this while suffering the extreme pain of mental illness. This interfered with his ability to feel positive or hopeful emotions for most of his life, as well as his ability to sleep, feel motivation, and process social interactions (among other things). My family and I are experiencing grief like we've never known and that will change us forever. Additionally, I find it difficult to write my thoughts, feelings, and floods of emotions as they are so real and raw at this time. I love you Peter, more than you could ever feel or understand. You are surrounded by friends and family that love you. We will always and forever cherish you. May you find peace and love in heaven my beautiful child. Please join with us this Friday and Saturday (February 3-4) to celebrate the life of our dear son Peter. For those who are unable to attend in person, there will be a live stream of the services at this obituary link. Please also share with us your favorite memories and pictures of Peter through this link. https://lnkd.in/gJEPMqSR There are several additional touching links on Facebook. We love you and greatly appreciate your support through this difficult time."
