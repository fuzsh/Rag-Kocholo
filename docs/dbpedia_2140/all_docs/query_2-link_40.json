        "text": "Sherry was a graduate of Weir High School, Class of 1982. She fell in love with and married the love of her life Benjamin S. Chapman in 1989 in Weirton. Before her mom’s passing, Sherry and Peggy enjoyed playing the slot machines in downtown Weirton. Sherry was a member of Christian Assembly of Follansbee.\n\nSherry had a love for the outdoors and traveling. She and Ben would travel in their camper to dirt auto races in Tennessee and Kentucky. They often attended the Dirt Track World Championship in Pennsboro, WV.\n\nSherry enjoyed camping and fishing for catfish and walleye, which she developed a taste for later in life. When Ben returned home with wild game, his “city girl” would roll up her sleeves and help him butcher and prepare the meat.\n\nSherry worked for 18 years in Weirton Steel in the Blast Furnace and Tin Mill. Later she worked at Mountaineer Casino as a Poker Dealer. Finally, she worked for Hancock County Schools in the kitchen of Weir High School.\n\nSherry was a headstrong woman who was kind to everyone. After her developing illness in 2018, she remained strong and lived life to the fullest with Ben.\n\nShe is survived by her loving husband of 35 years, Benjamin S. Chapman; sister, Patricia “Patty” Jenkins (late Ralph); nephews, Ian Jenkins (Emily) and Shawn Jenkins (Ashley); several great-nieces and great-nephews; and Aunt Tilly Markanton (late Chris).\n\nPer Sherry’s wishes, there will be no visitation at this time. A celebration of life will be held at a later date. Cremation arrangements have been entrusted to Steel & Wolfe Funeral Home & Cremation Services, Weirton, WV.\n\nwww.steelandwolfe .com"
