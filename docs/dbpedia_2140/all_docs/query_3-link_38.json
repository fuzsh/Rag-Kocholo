        "text": "Guided by audiophilic tendencies and an old soul, Ben Chapman found his way to Nashville after spending his adolescent years with self-taught guitar lessons and local VFW gigs. After signing his first publishing deal in 2021 with hit-songwriter Hillary Lindsey’s Hang Your Hat Music, a creative joint venture with Concord music, Chapman launched a monthly, year-long residency at the top of 2022 called “Peach Jam”, a name paying ode to his north Georgia roots. Hosted on the 2nd Wednesday of the month at Nashville’s beloved venue The Basement, the residency became a place for musicians, friends, and music lovers alike to turn on, tune in, and drop out for an evening of community, musicianship, transcendent southern rock, with an array of special guests including Brent Cobb, Drake White, Joshua Ray Walker, Lainey Wilson, Daniel Donato, Elizabeth Cook, Ashley Monroe, Angelina Presley, Caylee Hammack, Aaron Raitiere, Vince Herman, Brit Taylor, Hayes Carll, and more.\n\nInspired by the honky-tonk influence of Roger Miller and the genre-blending enterprises of The Grateful Dead, Chapman released his debut project Make The Night Better in March of 2022 exhibiting “not only his strength as a candid storyteller but also his poise as a quickly emerging artist” (American Songwriter). Produced by publisher-turned-producer Jake Gear (Hailey Whitters, Flatland Cavalry), and featuring fellow North Georgia native, and personal mentor to Chapman, Channing Wilson, the debut record found support from radio channels like WMOT and SiriusXM’s Outlaw Country as well as Spotify’s Indigo playlist, Fresh Finds: Folk, Apple Music’s New Music Daily, Country Risers, and beyond. The debut was well-received, with a slew of acts adding Ben to their shows including Flatland Cavalry, Drake White, Marshall Tucker Band, Hailey Whitters, Joshua Ray Walker, William Clark Green, Muscadine Bloodline, The Cadillac Three, and Corey Smith.\n\nHe kicks off 2023 as direct support on Lainey Wilson’s Country With A Flare Tour with a new self-produced project in the pipeline, with the first track “Georgia Dreamin’” releasing on January 27, 2023."
