        "text": "SAN DIEGO\n\nOut-of-control car kills heroic mom\n\nA 21-year-old woman has died of her injuries after pushing her toddler son away from an out-of-control car.\n\nRelatives took Deysi Araux off life support Wednesday at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego.\n\nShe was struck Tuesday and rolled onto the hood of a Ford Mustang in the parking lot of her apartment complex. The driver tried to stop the car after the brakes failed.\n\nHer 2-year-old son Steven was also injured but was released Tuesday from Rady Children’s Hospital.\n\nPolice investigators say they believe the Mustang wasn’t properly maintained and may file manslaughter charges against the driver.\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nJackson home is\n\nin, out of default\n\nPublic documents show Michael Jackson has repeatedly failed to make mortgage payments on a Los Angeles home that has been used for years by his family.\n\nDocuments filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office indicate the reclusive pop star was most recently in default last month on the property in Encino in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe singer had $153,910 in missed payments as of Jan. 17 on a $4 million loan serviced by Pasadena-based mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp. Documents dated Feb. 7 show the notice of default was withdrawn. Documents also show Jackson previously faced possible default over missed payments on the home in April and August.\n\nJackson’s Neverland property in Los Olivos, is set to be auctioned off March 19 because of missed payments on a $24.5 million loan.\n\nORANGE\n\nWould-be rescuer of cat dies in fall\n\nA 27-year-old Orange County man climbed a 50-foot Italian cypress tree to rescue a cat, then fell to his death while reaching out to grab the stranded feline.\n\nPolice in the city of Orange say Scott Buehler climbed up the tree around 1 p.m. Wednesday after the cat got stranded.\n\nSgt. Dan Adams says the man managed to grab hold of the cat, but lost his grip and fell to the sidewalk.\n\nThe cat fell to the ground with Buehler, was taken to an animal care facility, treated for minor injuries and returned to its owner, Leslie Meader of Animal Care Services told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHAWAII\n\nHorror classic actor is dead\n\nHONOLULU – Ben Chapman, a decorated Korean War veteran and real estate executive best known for playing the title character in the 1954 horror film “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” died last week. He was 79.\n\nChapman’s role as the Gill Man – the quintessential 1950s monster in Universal Pictures’ black-and-white film in 3-D – made him a darling on the collectibles and sci-fi circuit throughout the world.\n\n– From news services"
