        "text": "Beaufort-en-Vallée Castle is a castle located at Beaufort-en-Anjou, in Maine-et-Loire, 30 km south-east of Angers. It was built on a limestone mound already occupied by the Romans. A defensive castle was built in the 11th century by the Count of Anjou Foulque Nerra then rebuilt in the 13th and 14th centuries. Dominating the Authion valley, which it can thus monitor, the castle also protects the population of the village which has developed at its feet.\n\nThe site is appreciated by King René d'Anjou and his second wife, Jeanne de Laval, who stay there regularly. Jeanne de Laval lives there permanently after the disappearance of her husband.\n\nThe castle is very affected by the Wars of Religion. Its ruins are then used to strengthen the city's defense and build the Récollets convent.\n\nThe remains were acquired by the town in 1832.\n\nThe site, protected as historical monuments, exudes a romantic atmosphere and you can still admire the foundations of what was the mighty castle.\n\nIt is today a place of historic and bucolic walk. Information panels line the route. Free access every day. Information on +33 2 41 79 74 60."
