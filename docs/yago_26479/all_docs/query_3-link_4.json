        "text": "A European prince\n\nKing René is a historical character present in many regions of France: in Lorraine, in Provence, and in Anjou of course, where he was born in 1409!\n\nHe was the son of Yolande of Aragon and Duke Louis II of Anjou. Great-grandson of King Jean II Le Bon, he is part of the family of the kings of France. Supposed companion of Joan of Arc, he was very close to the dauphin Charles VII with whom he was raised and whose brother-in-law he became.\n\nIn Anjou, René is a duke. But this is not the only territory he owns: he is also Count of Provence, Duke of Bar and Lorraine.\n\nHe also inherited the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily and the title of king of Jerusalem . His daughter Marguerite became queen of England.\n\nIn the 15th century, René was a key figure in the political history of Europe!\n\nThe last of the Dukes of Anjou\n\nWhat Shakespeare says about him in his play Henry VI is in fact not far from the truth...\n\nDespite his many titles and territories, René struggled to exercise his power. In Italy, King Alfonso V of Aragon contested his possessions: these incessant campaigns would eventually ruin him.\n\nEven in Anjou, his \"reign\" ended in failure: with no legitimate descendants, René had to cede the duchy to his nephew, King Louis XI of France, in accordance with the tradition of the apanage . He was forced to leave Anjou in 1471 for his county of Provence where he died in 1480.\n\nIt will take all the ingenuity of his second wife Jeanne de Laval to exfiltrate Rene under the nose and the beard of the Provençals, and to bring back his heart and his body to Angers, according to his last will.\n\nA \"patron\" before his time\n\nThe History retains especially today of Rene his love for the arts.\n\nAuthor of a treatise on tournaments and novels, the last Duke of Anjou was indeed a literate prince and a collector. He owns many books, scientific objects or from the East, a large princely menagerie...\n\nThis known taste for arts was sometimes the object of caricatures. A historian of the XVIIth century will thus describe René as more busy painting a partridge than listening to his advisers who report the capture of Naples...\n\nIn truth, René did not engage in such artistic activities himself. As was common in the great princely courts of that time, and even if we do not yet speak of \"patronage\", he commissioned works of art and made artists work.\n\nIn Angers, in the heart of his private apartments in the royal dwelling, he welcomed the painter Barthelemy d'Eyck.\n\nThe king is dead, long live the king!\n\nIn Anjou and Provence, where the remains of the deceased king were disputed, the death of René was synonymous with the loss of the status of principality, and therefore of prestige.\n\nIn the castle, the death of this prince marked the end of the Angevin court: after René, the site would only serve as a prison or garrison. What a feeling of nostalgia ! 50 years after his death, the historian Jean de Bourdigné describes René as \"a lover of peace and harmony\" whom the \"poor Angevins\" still mourn.\n\nScoffed at or celebrated, the memory of this character will be reactivated according to the political changes. Under the Restoration For example, the old monarchic figures, victims of the revolutionary iconoclasm, were glorified The destruction of the mausoleum of René in 1794 in the cathedral of Angers had marked the Angevins.\n\nDiscover the history of the monument\n\nThe making of the \"good King René\n\nDespite the reservations of some historians of the time who judged the Duke of Anjou severely, the 19th century definitively established the figure of \"Good King René\".\n\nIn 1845, the complete works of the sovereign were republished. The profits are used to finance a statue project. The sculptor David d'Angers, a famous Republican who paradoxically had a passion for this king, was one of the artists solicited. The statue was inaugurated in Angers in 1853.\n\nIt is still today one of the emblematic images of the city and a spatial landmark for the inhabitants. The young and proud René, who sits at the foot of the castle, has a square haircut, totally anachronistic, borrowed from the fashion of the time of Saint Louis (13th century).\n\nLike the expression \"Good King René\", it perfectly illustrates the fantasy of the Middle Ages that was popularized by the Romanticism of the 19th century."
