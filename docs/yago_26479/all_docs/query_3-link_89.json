        "text": "In the last part of this series we read that Henry IV was a usurper. He deposed Richard II and that there were many other members of the royal family that held a better claim to the throne than Henry. However, it seems that the majority of the descendants of Edward III were either content with being King or powerless to challenge him. Henry IV died in 1413 was succeded by his eldest son as King Henry V of England. Henry, a very tall king at 6 foot 3 is remembered for his battles during the 100 years war with France. He even was able to secure the French succession for his eldest son. But that topic is for another series. This is a complex episode in English history. I will cover this period in a couple of blog entries.\n\nHenry V died in 1421 and his eldest son inherited the throne as King Hnery VI of England. It is with his reign we see the repercussion of the usurpation of Henry IV as the descendants of Edward III that held a better claim, began to fight with the descendants of Henry IV. These battles for the throne is known in history as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nRichard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, 6th Earl of March, 4th Earl of Cambridge, and 7th Earl of Ulster was descended from two older son of Edward III and had a better claim to the throne than Henry VI. The Duke of York rose to power and eventually became Lord Protector during the times when Henry VI became metally ill. The Duke of York had no desire to usurp the throne but did want to be recognized as Henryâ€™s legal heir. During his bout with mental illness Henry VI wife, Margaret of Anjou, gave birth to their only son, Edward, Prince of Wales. This event still did not deter Richard, Duke of York from obtaining the throne."
