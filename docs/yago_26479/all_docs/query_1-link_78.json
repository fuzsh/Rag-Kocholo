        "text": "Under the Middle Ages, the Neolithic !\n\nIdeally located on a promontory which dominates the Maine river a few kilometers upstream of its confluence with the Loire, the site of the castle of Angers knew how to seduce the builders well before the Middle Ages!\n\nThe oldest constructions on this site date back to prehistoric times ! The site was also favored by the Gauls for defense, then by the Romans who installed the heart of the ancient city there.\n\nThe site of the castle testifies in fact to the oldest origins of the city of Angers!\n\nDiscover the most beautiful panorama of Angers\n\nBeware Vikings!\n\nIn the 9th century, Angers was threatened from the north, and by boat... The Vikings! With their famous drakkars, commanded by their leaders Ragnar Lodbrok and Bjorn Cote de Fer, they had already taken the city several times.\n\nTo resist them, the French king Charles the Bald decided in 851 to install a count on the promontory: this was the birth of the castle!\n\nThese representatives of the king will gradually take their independence. They founded powerful dynasties which exceeded the only territory of Anjou. One of them, Foulque V, will even become king of Jerusalem!\n\nThe forgotten palace of the Plantagenet kings of England\n\nLast but not least: the Plantagenets are the last of the counts of Anjou. By happy matrimonial alliances, they became in the twelfth century ... kings of England !\n\nYes! Richard the Lionheart and John the Lackadaiser, popularized by the legend of Robin Hood, were above all Anjou princes! These sons of the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine ruled over a territory stretching from Scotland to the Pyrenees.Attached to the region, some of them rest near here, at the Royal Abbey of Fontevraud.\n\nTheir count's palace in Angers, of whichimpressive remains remain inside the castle, was one of the most sumptuous in the West.\n\nAngers, border of the kingdom of France\n\nSuch a powerful neighbor is not to please the king of France Philippe Auguste. The Capetian kings lead sieges and battles to recover the western lands from the Plantagenets. For Angers, it was done in 1206.\n\nUntil then the heart of the empire of the kings of England, Anjou was now the border of the kingdom of France. A border that had to be protected!\n\nQueen Blanche of Castile, who was regent of the kingdom for her son Louis IX, the future Saint Louis, ordered in the 1230's the construction of a gigantic fortress.\n\nThe castle of the \"princes of the flowers of lily\n\nIn the XIVth and XVth century, the castle is inhabited by powerful princes of the royal family of France: the dukes of Anjou. They had splendid buildings built in the flamboyant Gothic style in the center of the castle, which they renovated.\n\nLovers of the arts, they commissioned works such as the gigantic tapestry of the Apocalypse and established a flourishing court life in Angers.\n\nDiscover the tapestry of the Apocalypse: the essential in 2 minutes\n\nA family at the heart of the Hundred Years War\n\nTheir artistic legacy is more impressive than their political achievements. For in war, the dukes are not in luck! Heirs to the kingdoms of Naples, Sicily and Jerusalem, the Anjou family tried to control these distant lands, but in vain.\n\nLouis I lost his life and King René his fortune.\n\nOften less known than the men of their family, the duchesses of Anjou and their daughters nevertheless restore the family coat of arms! It was Yolande d'Aragon, King René's mother, who organized the epic of Joan of Arc and put an end to the Hundred Years War by allowing the coronation of her son-in-law, King Charles VII!\n\nDiscover René the Magnificent, from history to legend\n\nRenaissance and last lights of the stronghold\n\nAfter the attachment of Anjou to the crown and the departure of king Rene for Provence, the castle became again a simple place of royal garrison. It was once again the target of attacks at the end of the 16thcentury. But this time, the enemy was within...\n\nThe Wars of Religion agitated the kingdom and the castle was taken twice by the Huguenots The king of France Henri III did not make a fuss: he ordered to raze the fortress!\n\nIt is finally reorganized by its governor Donadieu de Puycharic: the archways are widened to become gunboats, the towers are removed and artillery platforms are created.\n\nIt is this drastic update that gives the castle of Angers the look we know today!\n\nGo to the dark side of the fortress...\n\nExcept for an episodic visit of François I in 1518, this time, the life of the castle is well over!\n\nFrom Louis XIV to Napoleon III through the French Revolution, the fortress was used essentially as a barracks or prison.\n\nSome of those imprisoned remained famous, such as Nicolas Fouquet. This minister of Louis XIV was imprisoned in Angers in 1661, under the leadership of a certain... D'Artagnan!\n\n1945: a monument under construction\n\nThe castle was classified as a historical monument in 1875. While it is still under authority of the Army, it is decided in 1936 that it will be transferred to the administration of the Fine Arts. But the war delayed its opening to the public.\n\nOn August 4, 1944, the Liberation of Anjou had begun: Allied bombs rained down on the city. In the castle, which housed a German base, the damage was considerable.\n\nThen, as everywhere in France, it was necessary to rebuild. The site was developed for walking, gardens were planted and buildings were restored.A phenomenal project was also launched: a monumental contemporary gallery dedicated to exhibiting and preserving a work of art that is just as monumental: the tapestry of the Apocalypse by Duke Louis I.\n\nIn 1948, the monument welcomed its first visitors. The Gallery of the Apocalypse opened 6 years later. It had been nearly 500 years since the tapestry had left the castle!\n\nA place dedicated to art and culture\n\nIn addition to the tapestry of the Apocalypse, which is on display all year round, the castle houses the tapestry treasure of Angers Cathedral.\n\nIn the royal dwelling, spaces of interpretation of the heritage with models and videos, as well as temporary exhibitions await you.\n\nAs a national domain of the Centre des monuments nationaux network, the castle welcomes more than 260,000 visitors per year, to whom it offers events and activities throughout the year, to learn, marvel... and dream big!\n\nConsult the agenda"
