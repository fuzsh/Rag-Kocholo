        "text": "History\n\nThe uncertain origin of the calisson dates back to the 12th century where a Medieval Latin text mentions 'calisone', an almond and flour cake similar to marzipan. This treat is found in Crete with the 'kalitsounia', made with almond paste, nuts and spices.\n\nThe word 'calisson' appeared in France during religious ceremonies where priests distributed blessed calissons to protect the population from the plague which raged in 1630. The priests pronounced the phrase: \"venite ad calicem\" in Latin, \"venez au calice\" (come to the chalice), which the people of Aix translate as \"venes touti au calissoun\" in Provençal.\n\nBrother Bonaventure, a Capuchin monk from Six-Fours, gives another explanation in his book 'Festes d'églises et coutumes de missions en Provence': 'these kinds of biscuits, very tender with almond paste, drawn from a large vessel in the shape of a calisse, are called \"calissons\".' It was later used in Provençal literature, notably by the poet Claude Brueys (1570-1636).\n\nLegend\n\nThe story goes that it was the confectioner of King René d'Anjou who created the first Aix-en-Provence calissons for his marriage to Jeanne de Laval. The future queen had the reputation of being austere, but when she tasted a calisson, it is said that her face lit up with a pretty smile. She then asked the confectioner what these sweets were called, he replied: \"di câlin souns\", \"des câlins\" in Provençal. The name has remained and the shape of the calisson represents the smile of the queen...\n\nThe Question on Everyone's Mind\n\nIs there really only one recipe for calisson?\n\nIn fact, no! The melon-based recipe is the first and most famous, but today the calisson comes in different flavours: lemon, raspberry, fig, orange, caramel, chocolate/hazelnut and almond. Try them all to find out which is your favourite!\n\nWhere to Buy Them\n\nLa boutique du Roy René, 380 Route d'Avignon - Quartier la Calade - RD7N, Aix-en-Provence\n\nYou can visit the calisson museum there!\n\nAt la chocolaterie de Puyricard, La Plantation, quartier Maliverny, avenue Georges de Fabry, Puyricard\n\nVisits to the production workshop and training courses are organised there. Come and taste the calissons straight from the oven!\n\nAt la Maison Brémond, 10 espace Saint-Pierre, Peyruis\n\nAix-en-Provence Calisson Events\n\nA blessing ceremony has taken place every year since 1995 on the first Sunday of September in the Saint-Jean-de-Malte church in Aix-en-Provence. It brings together several thousand participants and gives rise to a large Almond and Calisson Festival in the centre of Aix, with dances and concerts throughout the day."
