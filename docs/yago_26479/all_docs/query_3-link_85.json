        "text": "AUTHOR: ROHAN MASTER\n\nLANGUAGE: LATIN\n\nDATE: 1435\n\nPAGE #: 317\n\nREPRODUCTION DIMENSIONS: 11.75 X 7.75 IN\n\nHISTORY/DESCRIPTION: THIS BOOK OF HOURS WAS WRITTEN AROUND 1435−36 IN THE WORKSHOP OF THE ROHAN MASTER IN PARIS FOR RENÉ OF ANJOU (1409−80), THE SECOND SON OF LOUIS II OF ANJOU. THE PORTRAITS OF LOUIS II AND RENÉ ARE TO BE FOUND ON FOLIOS 61 AND 81 RESPECTIVELY, ALONG WITH RENÉ’S COAT OF ARMS AND EMBLEMS. THESE ARE DEATH WEARING A CROWN, THE EAGLE HOLDING THE CROSS OF LORRAINE (IN REFERENCE TO HIS FIRST WIFE, ISABELLE OF LORRAINE, FROM WHOM HE INHERITED THE DUCHY IN 1431), AND THE SAIL IN THE WIND WITH THE MOTTO EN DIEU EN SOIT (ACCORDING TO GOD’S WILL). THE PORTRAIT OF RENÉ OF ANJOU SUGGESTS THAT HE WAS A PRINCE DESIROUS OF DYNASTIC GLORY, A LOVER OF LUXURY, AND A PATRON WHO WAS SENSITIVE TO THE ART OF HIS TIME AND DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTH OF HIS DEVOTIONS. THE MASTER OF ROHAN (FLOURISHED 1410−40) IS KNOWN FOR A STYLE WHICH, COMPARED TO THE WORK OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES, IS MEMORABLY EXPRESSIVE. IT IS THOUGHT THAT HE BEGAN HIS CAREER IN CHAMPAGNE, WORKED FOR A TIME IN PARIS, AND LATER RETURNED TO CHAMPAGNE. SCHOLARS HAVE LINKED THE ROHAN HOURS WITH ANGERS AND THE ANGEVIN COURT.\n\nREPRODUCTION DETAILS: OUR HARDCOVER BOOKS ARE MADE WITH REAL WOOD FOR THE INTERIOR OF THE FRONT AND BACK COVERS AS WELL AS THE SPINE. THE LEATHER IS A 4 OZ COWHIDE, FROM A SMALL SUPPLIER IN NORTH CAROLINA. THE LEATHER IS ADHERED TO THE COVERS WITH GLUE AND MOLDED INTO THE SHAPE AT THE HAND OF OUR LOCAL ARTISANS. THE SIGNATURES/PAGES ARE HANDSEWN USING A LIBRARY BINDING METHOD. THE SEWN BOOK IS BOUND WITH A STRONG ADHESIVE GLUE THAT MAKES THE BINDINGS LAST, ESPECIALLY FOR THE LARGER BOOKS. WE ALSO ADD A THICK MULL CLOTH TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BINDING, DRYING IN BETWEEN EACH LAYER, A TRADITIONAL WAY TO MAKE THE BINDING STIFF, STRONG, AND RESILIENT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME."
