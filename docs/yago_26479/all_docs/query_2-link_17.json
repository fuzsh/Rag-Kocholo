        "text": "EDIT: after some delibiration I have decided to make this thread Plausibility Check instead of What If as it originally was. Probably the updated describtion fits much better to what I want this thread to be compared to the original one.\n\nDisclaimer 1: the idea of the PoD does not belong to me, although most of its possible consequences described here are my thoughts (and of course I asked for the PoD’s author permission to post it here). Here is a link to original discussion (which I also participate in) for those interested and willing to read in Russian.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I am interested to explore what events will be plausibly altered as a direct consequence of the PoD and thus will prefer not to consider random butterflies. So, while I will be happy to discuss anything, changing the outcome of Civil War in Grand Duchy of Moscow or butterflying away the Fall of Constantinople because Mehmed Fatih is born after PoD will not be extremely productive for the purpose of this PC.\n\nSources: my main source for the political part is Richard Vaughan’s tetralogy on the dukes of Burgundy. For military content I mostly rely on recent Alexandr Lobanov’s PhD thesis on Anglo-Burgundian Military Cooperation, 1420-1435 (link, I highly recommend this source: while it is limited in scope, it is amazingly detailed), relevant parts from Juliet Barker’s “Conquest. The English Kingdom of France 1417-1450” as well as a few primary sources (mostly for names of smaller places taken on some of campaigns). I also of course use bits and pieces from various other books and papers clarifying some specific moments.\n\nIf anyone could recommend something other that can be relevant, I will be grateful.\n\nMaps: Here is a map of IOTL territorial expansion of Philip the Good\n\nHere is an extremely detailed map of France in 1429-1430 (though the military situation on this map is a bit imprecise, but the feudal holdings are shown really well)\n\nHaving said this let’s talk about the possible PoD\n\nPhilp the Good’s first wife was Michelle of France. She was a good wife, who loved her husband and was loved by his subjects, but she was not particularly healthy and was able to give birth only to one daughter Agnes who died in infancy. IOTL, she died in 1422.\n\nApparently, Michelle also was reasonably close to her brother, future dauphin Charles. The murder of her father-in-law on Charles orders hit her particularly hard, but of course she had a lot to stress about during earlier years of Armagnac-Burgundian civil war too.\n\nThe PoD is that Michelle dies sometime in 1417 e. g. shortly after hearing that her other brother dauphin John died on April 5th 1417 thus making another round of civil war inevitable.\n\nSo, Michelle dies in early 1417 and Philip needs another wife. As you may have guessed from the name of the thread, the proposed wife if Isabella of Lorraine. Let’s try to analyze how plausible her marriage to Philip the Good is.\n\nIsabella of Lorraine is the eldest daughter of Charles of Lorraine and is set to inherit the duchy of Lorraine (by late 1410-s it is unlikely the Charles will have a male heir: his wife is in her forties, but is of good enough health). Lorraine of course is a reasonably wealthy duchy, it borders the county of Burgundy and while its acquisition does not as of late 1410s provide a land connection between north and south territories of Burgundy, it is a very important step in that direction (and both Brabant-Limburg and Luxemburg are while not yet Burgundian territories, are reasonably firmly in the Burgundian sphere of influence by late 1410s).\n\nMoreover, Charles of Lorrain himself is a firm Burgundian partisan: in 1408 he made an agreement with John the Fearless to participate in his military campaigns in return for an annual pension, which he faithfully did at least several times during a period of 1408-1415 thus earning himself a reputation of “perfect Burgundian”. IOTL, he seems to have stopped actively participating in the warfare after 1415 and in late 1410s and 1420s he became much friendlier with Dauphinists (as is evidenced by OTL Isabella’s marriage to Rene the Good and by Charles not participation in Lancastrian campaigns in eastern Champagne), but this was presumably because he wanted to save Lorraine for his descendants and thus from being annexed by Burgundians. But marrying his eldest daughter to Philip allows him both to save Lorraine for his grandchildren and to preserve his close ties with Burgundy. So I don’t see a reason why Philip the Good would be a less desirable groom than Rene of Anjou (who in 1410-1420s is only a count of Guise and future duke of Bar, is almost 10 years younger than Isabella and of the family who are firm Armagnacs i. e. exactly the people who headed by Louis of Orleans tried to conquer the duchy of Lorraine from Charles in 1407).\n\nSo, we have established that Philip is a desirable groom for Isabella and Charles. Is Isabella a desirable bride for Charles and John though? While the value of Lorraine is described in previous paragraph, the duke of Lorraine’s daughter is a bit of a mesalliance for Philip. After all his first and third wives were princesses and Charles of Lorrain is almost John the Fearless’s vassal. Moreover, during his reign, John was almost completely preoccupied with improving his chances of effectively ruling France and Isabella is simply not the best bride to improve his standing in that regard (e. g. Philip’s IOTL second wife Bonne of Artois probably fits better for this role as she is half-sister of Charles Bourbon).\n\nHowever specifically in 1417-1418 John is determined to become a master of France by military means (which he of course successfully accomplished IOTL). Thus, securing help of a successful general (who made himself a name participating in many John’s campaigns before) and his troops can become a priority. Presumably Charles was not ready to do it just for money (I strongly doubt that John didn’t offer him money in 1417-1418 like he did many times before) so securing a marriage alliance could be a way to entice him (Philip IOTL had a similar second marriage to Bonne of Artois which served a purely tactical purpose of securing a truce with Charles Bourbon). Of course, if Isabella was not a reasonably wealthy heiress of duchy bordering Burgundian domains, she would not be considered no matter what, but thankfully she is.\n\nTo sum up: overall Isabella is not ideal bride for supporting John the Fearless policy for most of his life. However, specifically in 1417-1418 she becomes much more valuable and thus can be chosen as Philip’s second wife if Michelle dies in this period.\n\nWhat are the most obvious consequences of PoD? The initial purpose of the PoD was to butterfly away Charles the Bold which coupled with the fact that Lorrain is by 1470 Burgundian for half a century completely alters Burgundian Wars (if they happen at all which is uncertain to put it mildly more than 50 years after the PoD) . As a consequence the House of Valois-Burgundy doesn’t become extinct. However of course there are a lot of important consequences much much earlier, which I will talk about below.\n\nFirst let’s talk about Isabella herself.\n\nFirst of all, she was extremely fertile. IOTL she gave birth to 10 children (4 of which survived till adulthood) which is even more impressive considering the fact that effectively her martial life with Rene lasted for 11 years: before 1424 Rene was below 15 and unlikely to sire a child, in 1431-1432 and again in 1434-1437 Rene was in Philip the Good’s captivity (he was captured at the battle of Bulgenville in the summer of 1431, was released in 1432 in exchange for his sons, but requested back in 1434 when Philip got furious with Emperor Sigismund’s decision confirming Rene’s possession of Lorrain), in 1435 Isabella went to Naples and was joined by Rene only in 1438, and finally 1440 Isabella left to France and Rene followed her only in 1442, after which Isabella was well over 40.\n\nWith Philip the Good Isabella would have at least twice as much time to bear children (including her years from 18 till 24 which, she effectively missed with Rene because he was too young) and of course Philip himself was extremely virile and fathered at least 20 children himself (this are his children we know by name; some sources say he had at least 50 bastards).\n\nSo presumably Isabella and Philip’s marriage would be extremely fruitful with up to 10 surviving children which has two important consequences. First one is that the extinction of Valois-Burgundy House becomes much less probable. The second is that Philip himself would be able to employ the marital policy of his father and grandfather (IOTL after he ran out of sisters, he actively used his nieces and other reasonably close female relatives; but of course having plenty daughters of his own is much better for this purpose).\n\nAnother important fact about Isabella is that her style of being consort is much closer to Philip’s grandmother's and especially mother's than that of any of his wives IOTL (which is pretty ironic given the fact that she was a bitter rival of Philip IOTL). The difference is most striking with his third wife Isabella of Portugal. Like Philip’s mother Margaret of Bavaria (and to lesser extent Margaret of Flanders), Isabella of Lorraine firmly ruled by herself large territories over extended periods of time (in case of Margaret, she ruled Flanders for several years after 1405 and the Two Burgundies from 1409 till 1424; in case of Isabella she ruled Lorraine and Bar between 1431 and 1435, Naples from 1435 till 1438 and Lorraine an Bar again from 1440 till 1445 and was involved in their government till her death in 1453). Both ladies were efficient administrators, dealt with unruly vassals and were even involved in military matters (Isabella IOTL was even able to raise and lead feudal levy on least 2 occasions: in 1431-1432 and again in 1441 both times against her cousin Antoine de Vaudemont, her cousin and rival claimant to the duchy of Lorraine; Margaret was similarly responsible for an effective defense of Two Burgundies on several accounts during her long reign). So, the blueprint for the role of Isabella in Burgundy already exists and thus the can basically seamlessly inherit the role of the governor of the Two Burgundies and later Lorrain from her mother-in-law, maybe even immediately after the latter's death.\n\nIsabella of Portugal was of course not without talents of her own. She was an intelligent woman, a patron of arts and a skilled diplomat, but unlike Margaret and Isabella (and even Michelle of France for a short period of time) she did not govern on her own.\n\nIronically it is her most important talent, that of diplomat, that backfired the most IOTL: she played an extremely important role in the conclusion of Treaty of Arras in 1435, which is considered a massive blunder on Burgundy's part by most historians. Philip the Good had great doubts whether to sign a separate peace with Charles VII, thus betraying his alliance with England and Lancastrian France. His advisors were equally split: while there was a powerful pro-reconciliation faction among his council, pro-war party was also quite strong. It was Isabella of Portugal’s diplomatic skill that shifted the balance in favor of making peace with Charles. Isabella received a yearly pension of 2000 pounds for this from the king of France and while I have little doubt that she sincerely believed the peace of Arras was beneficial for her husband, I also doubt that Isabella of Lorraine would be as suspensible to bribes. And even if she does support the reconciliation with Dauphinists, she may lack diplomatic skill to make her opinion as decisive.\n\nSo another important possible consequence down the road is the absence of Treaty of Arras.\n\nI also think that there are other factors that reduce the possibility of betraying the alliance with England:\n\n1. A greater animosity of HRE towards Burgundy and thus a less antagonizing policy towards his English allies in 1430s (ITTL Philip swallows yet another HRE member-state; while this acquisition is more legitimate than any of IOTL Philips acquisitions, all his expansion combined may create a stronger backlash than IOTL; and of course Sigismund was extremely hostile to Burgundy for most of his reign and even declared a HRE war in Philip in 1434, but had to back down because of low enthusiasm of HRE member-states)\n\n2. A better course of war with France. I have a specific possible scenario in mind, but before writing about it in detail, I would like to receive feedback about earlier possible major divergencies and PoD itself. To provide you a little spoiler, while butterflying away Joan of Arc can be done in several a reasonably plausible ways, I would prefer to avoid doing it since it would make the situation too wanky for my liking for Burgundians end Lancastrians.\n\nIn my next post I would try to enumerate the most obvious possible divergencies in late 1410s-1420s and provide my arguments why I believe they would not alter the general picture all that much.\n\nBut before doing it I’d like to hear what you all think about the plausibility of the PoD itself and about other major points mentioned in this post.\n\nBefore talking about specific divergencies that could happen in 1410s-1420s, let’s discuss alternative marriages that follow directly from PoD.\n\n1. Let’s start with the lady first: Isabella of Portugal. IOTL she married Philip really late: she was already 30 when she received Philip’s offer in 1428. While Philip was considering her as his second wife, I doubt her father was waiting for Burgundian offer and refused to consider other proposals. So presumably the alternative marital status of Philip in 1420s doesn’t change much for Isabella: if there was an attractive proposal her father would have taken it IOTL instead of waiting for Philip and since she was still single IOTL in 1428 she would also be ITTL. Thus, Isabella is likely to never marry ITTL and will become a nun. Alternatively, she could probably marry some Iberian noble, but the only one I could think about is infante Peter of Aragon, who IOTL died unmarried. Probably though, if Peter would be suitable, she would have married him IOTL (by 1428 he was 22 already and thus had more than enough time to marry her)\n\n2. The more important one is Rene the Good of Anjou who married Isabella of Lorraine IOTL.\n\nIn early to mid-1420s (when he probably should be engaged or married) he is count of Guise, he co-rules duchy of Bar with his grand-uncle (and is set to inherit it). He also is first in line for his brother Louis's many titles, but his brother is young and may still have heirs of his own (he didn’t IOTL and barring random butterflies probably won’t ITTL but there is no way to know this in 1420s). Anjou are of course important Armagnac supporters, Rene’s sister Mary will become dauphin Charles’s wife in 1422 (they were betrothed several years before the PoD, so this marriage will definitely happen ITTL), his younger brother Charles is dauphin’s close childhood friend and most importantly his mother is an extremely influential figure in Dauphinist France in 1410s-1430s (arguably the most influential).\n\nSo sum up, Rene is an important and well connected prince of blood, but not quite first-tier. I have a few possible brides for him, but no one fits him perfectly:\n\na. Joan of Valois, daughter of Charles of Orleans is the same age as Rene (IOTL she married John of Alencon and died without issue). She is an extremely desirable bride: her father is first in line of succession of France (according to Dauphinists of course and until future Louis XI is born; but even after that her father is second in succession), while her mother is a daughter of a king and a widow of a king. Joan is Charles’s only daughter (and is likely to remain such for a long time since Charles is in English captivity since the battle of Agincourt) and is set to inherit at least a decent number of his multiple titles in case of her father’s death without another heir (other titles would probably go to her uncles and/or would be restored to crown). In fact, she is so desirable that perhaps she is a bit out of Rene’s league. While arguably the same could be said about her OTL husband John of Alencon, his titles (duke of Alencon, count of Perche) are more prestigious than what Rene is certain to have in 1420s. Also, unlike Rene who in 1420s is not motivated to fight Burgundians even when they conquered his own county of Guise, Alencon is fighting Lancastrians since the first half of 1420s even if not particularly successfully (IOTL he was captured at battle of Verneuil in 1424, spent 5 years in captivity and had to sell basically all his possessions in order to ransom himself).\n\nThus marrying Joan to Alencon who lost most of his domains to English attack by the time of the marriage serves an important political message: remain faithful and you will be rewarded (and also provides a guarantee that Alencon would not switch his allegiance to Lancastrians in lieu of restoration of some of his titles however unlikely this possible scenario is).\n\nTo sum up, while Joan of Orleans marrying Rene instead of Alencon is possible, her OTL marriage seems to look a bit more plausible from my perspective.\n\nb. John of Alencon himself has a sister Charlotte 4 years younger than Rene (who IOTL died unmarried in 1435). John is an important Armagnac prince of blood (and thus marrying his sister would improve both Rene’s and Angevines in general standing among Dauphinists), moreover in mid to late 1420s Charlotte is John's heir, while he himself is in English captivity (and as Agincourt prisoners demonstrate such a captivity can last for decades).\n\nThis possible inheritance is not without a caveat: John’s domains are conquered by Lancastrians (and also confiscated by Lancastrian government which Dauphinists naturally did not recognize) and in case of John’s death without an heir a substantial part of his titles would probably be reverted to the crown. Charlotte would still probably receive some part of his inheritance such a scenario (if we look at the fate of John of Berry’s appanage as a precedent, a likely outcome would be Charlotte inheriting either county of Perche or duchy of Alencon while the other one coupled with smaller titles such as Domfront, Fougeres etc. going to the crown) and even such a conditional inheritance is valuable especially considering that both Alencon and Perche border the block of Angevine lands centered around Anjou and Maine. And if John’s lands were not conquered Charlotte probably would once again would be a top-tier bride a bit out of Rene’s league.\n\nc. Isabella of Brittany is 2 years younger than Rene. IOTL, she married Guy de Laval in 1430s, but Rene is a more high-profile groom and thus if Angevines are interested in improving relationship with John of Brittany it is a better match (and Guy de Laval can in such a scenario marry Isabelle’s sister Catherine who IOTL died after 1444 unmarried). The main blocker for such an arrangement is John’s double-faced policy at this stage of Hundred Years’ War (he switched sides at least 4 times). However, in 1425-1427 he is reconciled with the dauphin and this is probably the most appropriate time to wed Rene and Isabella in terms of age.\n\nd. Bonne, daughter of John of Armagnac who IOTL died unmarried in 1430s. However, her father pledged allegiance to king of Castille in 1425 and remained rather hostile to dauphin until late 1440s. Bonne, who was born in 1416 would not be in time to marry Rene before this event: at best she and Rene can be betrothed and I am not sure this betrothal can survive John Armagnac’s political maneuver.\n\ne. Rene can try to engage Philip’s rivals in the HRE.\n\nI don’t really have a good candidate here. A decent variant would be some close relative of Antoine de Vaudemont (IOTL Philip supported Antoine against Isabella and Rene; ITTL Antoine would still claim the duchy of Lorraine and thus become Philip’s rival). ITTL Antoine would presumably be recognized as a duke of Lorraine by Emperor Sigismund (IOTL he supported Isabella to spite Philip, ITTL he can do the same for another candidate). However, Antoine didn’t have daughters until much later and both his sisters are already married at the time of PoD (his sister Margaret would become widow in 1431, but marrying a widowed second daughter of a count is definitely below Rene’s status however important an ally Antione ITTL is)\n\nAnother important adversary of Philip in HRE is Frederick the Empty Pockets of Tyrol (who IOTL had quarrels with Philip over county of Ferrette in Upper Alsase which eventually led to war in 1430-1431). But he, once again, had no daughters that survived childhood. He had a number of nieces by Ernest the Iron though and was a regent after his brother’s death, so perhaps Rene can marry one of them.\n\nPhilip had other rivals in HRE, but most of them became active after Philip inherited Brabant and Limburg (i. e. after 1430) and by this time Rene should probably at least be betrothed.\n\nI personally think that either option b or option c are the most plausible, but IMHO none of these seem perfect. So I will be really gratefull for other suggestions (or for comments on the suggestions above)\n\n3. The absence of marriage between Rene the Good and Isabella of Lorraine leads to Henry VI not having OTL bride. IOTL Henry married in mid 1440s, so a lot will be changed by that time ITTL.\n\nIf Lancastrian-Burgundian alliance stands, one of Philip and Isabella’s daughters is a nice possible option (so to speak an ITTL shadow of Margaret of Anjou), but there are many other possible variants.\n\nThe choice of wife for Henry depends too much on how exactly HYW will play out in 1420s and 1430s, so probably finding a specific bride for him is a bit premature at this point. But it will be interesting to see some options.\n\nWhat about Rene marrying Jacquetta of Holland instead.\n\nHer betrothal to Antoine of Brabant happened almost immediately after the PoD and she remained married until the end of 1420s (married twice over for most of this time period). She will not be able to do her stunt with second marriage while her husband is alive with Rene while he is still a preteen and thus her marriage to Gloucester probably happens as IOTL. After her marriage to Gloucester is definitevely annulled (which finally happens only in 1428), she will not be able to marry Rene for another reason: she is on her last legs in the war against Philip (in 1428 he laid siege to her last major stronghold Gouda). IOTL as soon as she realized that English will definitely not support her, she had no other option than to sign the Reconciliation of Delft (one of the most important conditions of which that she had to obtain Philips permission to another marriage) and I don't really see what can be changed ITTL\n\nSo while Rene would probably not mind marrying Jacqueline, I don’t see much chance for that.\n\nThis post was entirely devoted to alternative marriages ITTL. I will try enumerate the other possible divergencies in late 1410s-1420s in my next post.\n\nThanks for your opinion!\n\nThen in true Burgundian fashion the bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne and more importantly duke of Bar can instead be swayed to sell the duchy of Bar (or the right to the succession of the duchy) to the duke of Burgundy and his wife the duchess of Lorraine.\n\nDo you mind sharing a source on the sale of Bar IOTL (please don't feel offended by me being nitpicky, but this is extremely important for the purpose of the possible consequences)? I have seen the fact mentioned here on ah.com a couple of times, but the literature I have seems to support another version i. e. that Rene was simply the closest relative of Louis of Bar (along with Louis of Anjou of course but supposedly the duke of Bar didn't want his duchy to be managed by an absent duke).\n\nE. g. Margaret Kekewich writes in her The Good King: \"Yolande of Aragon’s childless uncle, cardinal Louis, bishop of Châlonssur-Marne, was duke of Bar. The last of his nephews had been killed at Agincourt so the field was clear for Yolande to persuade him to adopt his great-nephew René as his heir. René was already count of Guise, which he had inherited from his father two years previously. It was agreed that the ten-year-old would go and live in Bar where he was made a member of the Order of Fidelity in which forty knights swore to protect him from all dangers.31 In a ceremony on 13 August 1419, the old cardinal formally ceded his duchy and the marquisate of the adjacent lands of Pont-à-Mousson to René. \"\n\nHowever if there is a good source proving that Louis of Bar did indeed sell Bar, this changes the overall situation quite a bit. Philip does defenitely has both the incentive to do it as well as the means (after all, he bought Namur in 1421; presumably the duchy of Bar will be a better purchase). Louis, being a moderate Burgundian supporter wouldn't probably mind too much (that is if in fact he was selling the duchy; if he wanted to leave it to his relatives Philip doesn't work at all) and Bar being firmly Burgundian in 1420s changes the situation quite a bit\n\nBesides a house like the house of Bourbon, of royal Capetian descent sure, but not that important yet were also considered (probably as a proxy, but still).\n\nThat is not quite the case. They have inherited Duchy of Auvergne and related titles in 1416 which immediately made House of Bourbon top 4 landholder in France other than king with domains inside the kingdom comparable to that of Dukes of Brittany, Dukes of Burgundy and Dukes of Anjou (and the gap between these 4 and the next one is quite large). Of course, dukes of Bourbon don't have the lands out of kingdom of France unlike Angevins and Burgundians, but still they are really, really important as far as French internal politics go.\n\nThe house of Burgundy was not averse to marrying heiresses, Philip the Bold has married Margaret of Male (last of the house of Dampierre), heiress to the counties of Flanders, Artois and Nevers and the county palatine of Burgundy.\n\nJohn the Fearless was married to Margaret of Bavaria-Straubing, potential heiress of the Netherlandic possessions of the house of Bavaria-Straubing (successor of the house of Avesnes), the counties of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland. Through her, Philip the Good can trace his claim on those.\n\nIsabel of Lorraine, heiress to Lorraine and key to potentially acquire the duchy of Bar, IMHO would not be a misalliance at all. It will also greatly help to bring prince-bishoprics Metz, Toul and Verdun in the Burgundian sphere of influence, like IOTL Liege (Luik), Utrecht and Cambrai.\n\nAlso don’t forget, that Philip the Good still hasn’t made his great acquisitions in the Low Countries (the duchies of Lothier, Brabant and Limburg, the counties of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland etc.) yet in 1417.\n\nSo no, Isabel would be a good strategic match, since it brings the duchy of Lorraine.\n\nWell Isabella is a heiress yes, and yes members of Valois-Burgundy were more than fine marrying a suitable heiresses, but to be fair Isabella is a much poorer heiress than either Margaret of Flandres or even Margaret of Bavaria (Holland that is).\n\nI don't have a good population estimate for duchy of Lorraine, at least not in 1419s borders (that is without Bar and Vaudemont), but I would assume that it should be comparable to the county of Burgundy. The inheritance of Margaret of Flandres brought Philip 5 times more (even if we discount Rethel and Nevers which we really shouldn't), Hainaut, Zeeland and Holland are at least twice as popoulus. In terms of wealth the discrepancy is of course even higher (according to Vaughan's Philip the Good Flandres+Artois gave around 7.5 times more yearly aides than Two Burgundies and Holland+Zeeland+Hainaut gave 5 times the amount; and these are two Burgundies, Lorrain is at best half of that)\n\nHaving said that, I don't intend to prove that the marriage between Philip and Isabella is a bad idea, just that it is somewhat of a mesalliance, possible only in specific circumstances (like those of 1417-1418)\n\nThanks for your opinion!\n\nDo you mind sharing a source on the sale of Bar IOTL (please don't feel offended by me being nitpicky, but this is extremely important for the purpose of the possible consequences)? I have seen the fact mentioned here on ah.com a couple of times, but the literature I have seems to support another version i. e. that Rene was simply the closest relative of Louis of Bar (along with Louis of Anjou of course but supposedly the duke of Bar didn't want his duchy to be managed by an absent duke).\n\nE. g.

Moreover there are several options, buy the duchy directly (unlikely), buy the right of succession more likely; alternatively the duchy of Bar was claimed by duke Adolf of Berg (house Jülich-Berg, he later also became duke of Jülich), but he failed to conquer it (he was invested with the marquisate of Pont-a-Mousson, so Philip could also buy his claim, not to mention the house of Lorraine also had a distant claim. I find some contrasting dates, about the capture of duke Adolf, some it varies from 1417 to 1422, OTOH IOTL duke Louis (also a Prince-Bishop) gave Bar to René of Anjou.\n\nIMHO this narrows that window to 1415 - 1419, also the period in which marrying Isabella of Lorraine is most interesting for duke Philip the Good. Also buying Bar does not exclude Burgundy buying the margraviate of Namur.\n\nMoreover TTL marriage with the heiress of Lorraine, within the right window, is needed to really spark an interest in this region, while Namur already fits in the Burgundian ambitions in the Low Countries.\n\nThat is not quite the case. They have inherited Duchy of Auvergne and related titles in 1416 which immediately made House of Bourbon top 4 landholder in France other than king with domains inside the kingdom comparable to that of Dukes of Brittany, Dukes of Burgundy and Dukes of Anjou (and the gap between these 4 and the next one is quite large). Of course, dukes of Bourbon don't have the lands out of kingdom of France unlike Angevins and Burgundians, but still they are really, really important as far as French internal politics go.\n\nIt was more a hyperbole, to prove that Valois-Burgundy did not need to marry into royalty as some suggested.\n\nWell Isabella is a heiress yes, and yes members of Valois-Burgundy were more than fine marrying a suitable heiresses, but to be fair Isabella is a much poorer heiress than either Margaret of Flandres or even Margaret of Bavaria (Holland that is).\n\nI don't have a good population estimate for duchy of Lorraine, at least not in 1419s borders (that is without Bar and Vaudemont), but I would assume that it should be comparable to the county of Burgundy. The inheritance of Margaret of Flandres brought Philip 5 times more (even if we discount Rethel and Nevers which we really shouldn't), Hainaut, Zeeland and Holland are at least twice as popoulus. In terms of wealth the discrepancy is of course even higher (according to Vaughan's Philip the Good Flandres+Artois gave around 7.5 times more yearly aides than Two Burgundies and Holland+Zeeland+Hainaut gave 5 times the amount; and these are two Burgundies, Lorrain is at best half of that)\n\nMargaret of Male was an exceptional good catch, not around that often. Margaret of Bavaria-Straubing-Holland/Hainaut wasn't even a guaranteed heiress, that was part of a double marriage, William of Bavaria-Straubing-Holland/Hainaut (her brother) married Margaret of Burgundy (the sister of John the Fearless), in a way they resolved the rivalry between the Dampierres (now Burgundy) and the Avesnes (now Bavaria-Straubing-Holland/Hainaut). The double marriage first was a high price to pay for Philip the Bold, but that was resolved by the ageing childless duchess of Lothier*, Brabant and Limburg (*= highly prestigious, but mostly titular by this point, also the Brabantian chancellery kept using Lower Lotharingia/Lorraine), close to both the dynasties in Flanders and Holland, that Valois-Burgundy would also succeed in Brabant-Limburg.\n\nEven Brabant-Limburg was indirectly, Brabant-Limburg first past to a younger brother of John the Fearless, Anthony, count of Rethel.\n\nTheir youngest brother Philip, received the county of Nevers in appanage from John the Fearless (he had been count of Nevers before becoming duke of Burgundy etc.), Anthony would also grant the county of Rethel to Philip, after he succeeded in Brabant-Limburg.\n\nIn other words Philip the Good was only duke of Burgundy, count of Flanders and Artois and count palatine of Burgundy by this point, between 1415-1419, far from certain to succeed in the duchies of Brabant & Limburg and the counties of Hainaut, Holland & Zeeland, even when they were within the Burgundian sphere.\n\nYes, Isabella is no Margaret of Male, but unlike Margaret of Bavaria-Straubing-Holland/Hainaut, she does bring something direct to the table, the succession to the duchy of Lorraine.\n\nI too have wealth and population figures for the Burgundian Lands (from a number of sources), sadly I lack these for Lorraine too. One nitpick, technically the county of Vaudemont, unlike Bar, was still of fief of Lorraine (for a while they had a conection to Bar, then it passed again to a younger son of the duke of Lorraine, the progenitors of the house of Habsburg-Lorraine).\n\nHaving said that, I don't intend to prove that the marriage between Philip and Isabella is a bad idea, just that it is somewhat of a mesalliance, possible only in specific circumstances (like those of 1417-1418)\n\nHere I have a a nuance.IMHO there's a difference between Isabella of Lorraine, heiress to the duchy of Lorraine and Isabella, just the daughter of the duke of Lorraine. IMHO Isabella would only be a misalliance, if she does not bring the duchy of Lorraine to the table. That IMHO changes a lot, and then she will be more valuable than a Bourbon (or Angevin) bride, which do not bring such a direct territorial expansion.\n\nThing is Margaret of Male’s are rare, Isabella of Lorraine, in a strategic region for Burgundy and next door, besides IOTL Philip ended up marrying Bonne of Artois as a second wife, not the best option either. Without the duchy of Lorraine on the table, Isabella wouldn't be that great either, but that gives her an edge.\n\nEDIT: after some delibiration I have decided to make this thread Plausibility Check instead of What If as it originally was. Probably the updated describtion fits much better to what I want this thread to be compared to the original one.\n\nDisclaimer 1: the idea of the PoD does not belong to me, although most of its possible consequences described here are my thoughts (and of course I asked for the PoD’s author permission to post it here). Here is a link to original discussion (which I also participate in) for those interested and willing to read in Russian.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I am interested to explore what events will be plausibly altered as a direct consequence of the PoD and thus will prefer not to consider random butterflies. So, while I will be happy to discuss anything, changing the outcome of Civil War in Grand Duchy of Moscow or butterflying away the Fall of Constantinople because Mehmed Fatih is born after PoD will not be extremely productive for the purpose of this PC.\n\nSources: my main source for the political part is Richard Vaughan’s tetralogy on the dukes of Burgundy. For military content I mostly rely on recent Alexandr Lobanov’s PhD thesis on Anglo-Burgundian Military Cooperation, 1420-1435 (link, I highly recommend this source: while it is limited in scope, it is amazingly detailed), relevant parts from Juliet Barker’s “Conquest. The English Kingdom of France 1417-1450” as well as a few primary sources (mostly for names of smaller places taken on some of campaigns). I also of course use bits and pieces from various other books and papers clarifying some specific moments.\n\nIf anyone could recommend something other that can be relevant, I will be grateful.\n\nMaps: Here is a map of IOTL territorial expansion of Philip the Good\n\nHere is an extremely detailed map of France in 1429-1430 (though the military situation on this map is a bit imprecise, but the feudal holdings are shown really well)\n\nHaving said this let’s talk about the possible PoD\n\nPhilp the Good’s first wife was Michelle of France. She was a good wife, who loved her husband and was loved by his subjects, but she was not particularly healthy and was able to give birth only to one daughter Agnes who died in infancy. IOTL, she died in 1422.\n\nApparently, Michelle also was reasonably close to her brother, future dauphin Charles. The murder of her father-in-law on Charles orders hit her particularly hard, but of course she had a lot to stress about during earlier years of Armagnac-Burgundian civil war too.\n\nThe PoD is that Michelle dies sometime in 1417 e. g. shortly after hearing that her other brother dauphin John died on April 5th 1417 thus making another round of civil war inevitable.\n\nSo, Michelle dies in early 1417 and Philip needs another wife. As you may have guessed from the name of the thread, the proposed wife if Isabella of Lorraine. Let’s try to analyze how plausible her marriage to Philip the Good is.\n\nIsabella of Lorraine is the eldest daughter of Charles of Lorraine and is set to inherit the duchy of Lorraine (by late 1410-s it is unlikely the Charles will have a male heir: his wife is in her forties, but is of good enough health). Lorraine of course is a reasonably wealthy duchy, it borders the county of Burgundy and while its acquisition does not as of late 1410s provide a land connection between north and south territories of Burgundy, it is a very important step in that direction (and both Brabant-Limburg and Luxemburg are while not yet Burgundian territories, are reasonably firmly in the Burgundian sphere of influence by late 1410s).\n\nMoreover, Charles of Lorrain himself is a firm Burgundian partisan: in 1408 he made an agreement with John the Fearless to participate in his military campaigns in return for an annual pension, which he faithfully did at least several times during a period of 1408-1415 thus earning himself a reputation of “perfect Burgundian”. IOTL, he seems to have stopped actively participating in the warfare after 1415 and in late 1410s and 1420s he became much friendlier with Dauphinists (as is evidenced by OTL Isabella’s marriage to Rene the Good and by Charles not participation in Lancastrian campaigns in eastern Champagne), but this was presumably because he wanted to save Lorraine for his descendants and thus from being annexed by Burgundians. But marrying his eldest daughter to Philip allows him both to save Lorraine for his grandchildren and to preserve his close ties with Burgundy. So I don’t see a reason why Philip the Good would be a less desirable groom than Rene of Anjou (who in 1410-1420s is only a count of Guise and future duke of Bar, is almost 10 years younger than Isabella and of the family who are firm Armagnacs i. e. exactly the people who headed by Louis of Orleans tried to conquer the duchy of Lorraine from Charles in 1407).\n\nSo, we have established that Philip is a desirable groom for Isabella and Charles. Is Isabella a desirable bride for Charles and John though? While the value of Lorraine is described in previous paragraph, the duke of Lorraine’s daughter is a bit of a mesalliance for Philip. After all his first and third wives were princesses and Charles of Lorrain is almost John the Fearless’s vassal. Moreover, during his reign, John was almost completely preoccupied with improving his chances of effectively ruling France and Isabella is simply not the best bride to improve his standing in that regard (e. g. Philip’s IOTL second wife Bonne of Artois probably fits better for this role as she is half-sister of Charles Bourbon).\n\nHowever specifically in 1417-1418 John is determined to become a master of France by military means (which he of course successfully accomplished IOTL). Thus, securing help of a successful general (who made himself a name participating in many John’s campaigns before) and his troops can become a priority. Presumably Charles was not ready to do it just for money (I strongly doubt that John didn’t offer him money in 1417-1418 like he did many times before) so securing a marriage alliance could be a way to entice him (Philip IOTL had a similar second marriage to Bonne of Artois which served a purely tactical purpose of securing a truce with Charles Bourbon). Of course, if Isabella was not a reasonably wealthy heiress of duchy bordering Burgundian domains, she would not be considered no matter what, but thankfully she is.\n\nTo sum up: overall Isabella is not ideal bride for supporting John the Fearless policy for most of his life. However, specifically in 1417-1418 she becomes much more valuable and thus can be chosen as Philip’s second wife if Michelle dies in this period.\n\nWhat are the most obvious consequences of PoD? The initial purpose of the PoD was to butterfly away Charles the Bold which coupled with the fact that Lorrain is by 1470 Burgundian for half a century completely alters Burgundian Wars (if they happen at all which is uncertain to put it mildly more than 50 years after the PoD) . As a consequence the House of Valois-Burgundy doesn’t become extinct. However of course there are a lot of important consequences much much earlier, which I will talk about below.\n\nFirst let’s talk about Isabella herself.\n\nFirst of all, she was extremely fertile. IOTL she gave birth to 10 children (4 of which survived till adulthood) which is even more impressive considering the fact that effectively her martial life with Rene lasted for 11 years: before 1424 Rene was below 15 and unlikely to sire a child, in 1431-1432 and again in 1434-1437 Rene was in Philip the Good’s captivity (he was captured at the battle of Bulgenville in the summer of 1431, was released in 1432 in exchange for his sons, but requested back in 1434 when Philip got furious with Emperor Sigismund’s decision confirming Rene’s possession of Lorrain), in 1435 Isabella went to Naples and was joined by Rene only in 1438, and finally 1440 Isabella left to France and Rene followed her only in 1442, after which Isabella was well over 40.\n\nWith Philip the Good Isabella would have at least twice as much time to bear children (including her years from 18 till 24 which, she effectively missed with Rene because he was too young) and of course Philip himself was extremely virile and fathered at least 20 children himself (this are his children we know by name; some sources say he had at least 50 bastards).\n\nSo presumably Isabella and Philip’s marriage would be extremely fruitful with up to 10 surviving children which has two important consequences. First one is that the extinction of Valois-Burgundy House becomes much less probable. The second is that Philip himself would be able to employ the marital policy of his father and grandfather (IOTL after he ran out of sisters, he actively used his nieces and other reasonably close female relatives; but of course having plenty daughters of his own is much better for this purpose).\n\nAnother important fact about Isabella is that her style of being consort is much closer to Philip’s grandmother's and especially mother's than that of any of his wives IOTL (which is pretty ironic given the fact that she was a bitter rival of Philip IOTL). The difference is most striking with his third wife Isabella of Portugal. Like Philip’s mother Margaret of Bavaria (and to lesser extent Margaret of Flanders), Isabella of Lorraine firmly ruled by herself large territories over extended periods of time (in case of Margaret, she ruled Flanders for several years after 1405 and the Two Burgundies from 1409 till 1424; in case of Isabella she ruled Lorraine and Bar between 1431 and 1435, Naples from 1435 till 1438 and Lorraine an Bar again from 1440 till 1445 and was involved in their government till her death in 1453). Both ladies were efficient administrators, dealt with unruly vassals and were even involved in military matters (Isabella IOTL was even able to raise and lead feudal levy on least 2 occasions: in 1431-1432 and again in 1441 both times against her cousin Antoine de Vaudemont, her cousin and rival claimant to the duchy of Lorraine; Margaret was similarly responsible for an effective defense of Two Burgundies on several accounts during her long reign). So, the blueprint for the role of Isabella in Burgundy already exists and thus the can basically seamlessly inherit the role of the governor of the Two Burgundies and later Lorrain from her mother-in-law, maybe even immediately after the latter's death.\n\nIsabella of Portugal was of course not without talents of her own. She was an intelligent woman, a patron of arts and a skilled diplomat, but unlike Margaret and Isabella (and even Michelle of France for a short period of time) she did not govern on her own.\n\nIronically it is her most important talent, that of diplomat, that backfired the most IOTL: she played an extremely important role in the conclusion of Treaty of Arras in 1435, which is considered a massive blunder on Burgundy's part by most historians. Philip the Good had great doubts whether to sign a separate peace with Charles VII, thus betraying his alliance with England and Lancastrian France. His advisors were equally split: while there was a powerful pro-reconciliation faction among his council, pro-war party was also quite strong. It was Isabella of Portugal’s diplomatic skill that shifted the balance in favor of making peace with Charles. Isabella received a yearly pension of 2000 pounds for this from the king of France and while I have little doubt that she sincerely believed the peace of Arras was beneficial for her husband, I also doubt that Isabella of Lorraine would be as suspensible to bribes. And even if she does support the reconciliation with Dauphinists, she may lack diplomatic skill to make her opinion as decisive.\n\nSo another important possible consequence down the road is the absence of Treaty of Arras.\n\nI also think that there are other factors that reduce the possibility of betraying the alliance with England:\n\n1. A greater animosity of HRE towards Burgundy and thus a less antagonizing policy towards his English allies in 1430s (ITTL Philip swallows yet another HRE member-state; while this acquisition is more legitimate than any of IOTL Philips acquisitions, all his expansion combined may create a stronger backlash than IOTL; and of course Sigismund was extremely hostile to Burgundy for most of his reign and even declared a HRE war in Philip in 1434, but had to back down because of low enthusiasm of HRE member-states)\n\n2. A better course of war with France. I have a specific possible scenario in mind, but before writing about it in detail, I would like to receive feedback about earlier possible major divergencies and PoD itself. To provide you a little spoiler, while butterflying away Joan of Arc can be done in several a reasonably plausible ways, I would prefer to avoid doing it since it would make the situation too wanky for my liking for Burgundians end Lancastrians.\n\nIn my next post I would try to enumerate the most obvious possible divergencies in late 1410s-1420s and provide my arguments why I believe they would not alter the general picture all that much.\n\nBut before doing it I’d like to hear what you all think about the plausibility of the PoD itself and about other major points mentioned in this post.\n\nThis marriage would certainly help Philip politically and personally.\n\nThe house of Valois-Burgundy did indeed buy the margraviate of Namur later also the duchy of Luxembourg and eventually most contested the duchy of Gelre (aka Guelders, including the county of Zutphen), in all those cases there were other claimants and distant heirs. Moreover there are several options, buy the duchy directly (unlikely), buy the right of succession more likely; alternatively the duchy of Bar was claimed by duke Adolf of Berg (house Jülich-Berg, he later also became duke of Jülich), but he failed to conquer it (he was invested with the marquisate of Pont-a-Mousson, so Philip could also buy his claim, not to mention the house of Lorraine also had a distant claim. I find some contrasting dates, about the capture of duke Adolf, some it varies from 1417 to 1422, OTOH IOTL duke Louis (also a Prince-Bishop) gave Bar to René of Anjou.\n\nIMHO this narrows that window to 1415 - 1419, also the period in which marrying Isabella of Lorraine is most interesting for duke Philip the Good. Also buying Bar does not exclude Burgundy buying the margraviate of Namur.\n\nMoreover TTL marriage with the heiress of Lorraine, within the right window, is needed to really spark an interest in this region, while Namur already fits in the Burgundian ambitions in the Low Countries.\n\nDid I get you right that there is no evidence that Louis of Bar has IOTL sold his inheritance in Bar to Angevins, but you believe that he could potentially sell it to Burgundians ITTL?\n\nI have a slightly different spin on it:\n\n1. Presumably in 1417-1419 Burgundians have their attention and resources focused on establishing and maintaining their power in Paris (and France in general) and cannot really allow themselves to be distracted from it. Burgundians may have discussions with Louis about selling his claim but they cannot really pressure him: he is a Burgundian party supporter and forcing him to give up his inheritance to John/Philip instead of his relative is not the best move politically (IOTL John did employ heavy-handed tactics to take counties of Macon, Tonnerre and Boulogne but in these cases he acted either against royal domain or against his own vassals who became Armagnac supporters; Louis de Bar is neither Burgundy’s vassal nor Armagnac )\n\n2. In 1419 Louis of Bar finally decides to name Rene his heir. IOTL the ceremony happened in August 1419, less than a month before the assassination of John the Fearless. ITTL this may happen on schedule (and in this case Burgundians will have no time to react before the assassination even if they would like to) or to be a bit delayed (if Louis of Bar is less motivated to name Rene his heir without the perspective of inheriting Lorraine). I think though that the death of John the Fearless should be the final straw for the Louis even if he would have more doubts than IOTL.\n\nPhilip might wish to punish Louis, but the duke of Burgundy has a lot on his plate and it is not the smartest tactics to antagonize a man who is neutral in war and may still join Burgundians (IOTL Louis has recognized the treaty of Troyes in 1428 and even participated in that year’s campaign in Eastern Champagne)\n\n3. Duke Adolf of Berg who has a claim to Bar through his wife (younger sister of Louis) tries to take Bar by force as IOTL. IOTL he was captured in 1422 and as a part of ransom he had to renounce his rights to Bar. ITTL however Louis and Rene don’t have Lorraine on their side. While I still don’t believe in Adolf’s victory, his defeat would not be nearly as crushing and he might not be captured.\n\n4. In 1423 a first cousin once removed of Adolf, Reinald of Julich and Guelders dies. Julich and Guelders are much closer to Bar and naturally would be a priority for Adolf. He has to fight Arnold of Egmond for these duchies who is supported by Philip the Good. As per OTL Adolf manages to get Julich, but not Guelders.\n\n5. In 1429 Rene and Louis switch to Dauphinists and in 1430 Rene participates in Armagnac campaigns in Champagne and Duchy of Burgundy. Louis also dies in 1430 so all the reasons to limit Burgundian activity towards Bar is gone.\n\n6. IOTL in 1431 Adolf has signed a treaty where he promised to support Philip’s acquisition of Luxemburg (he and Philip also promised each other mutual defense and security). ITTL Adolf may receive a larger sum of money but also agree to sell his son’s rights to Bar (which he has no realistic way of enforcing given the prominence of Rene in Champagne and Dauphinist France in general), but probably Philip doesn’t need this to claim Bar (see below).\n\nPhilip also has another claimant to Bar under his sway: Jeanne of Bar (countess of Soisson, Marle etc. etc.) who is a stepdaughter of John Luxemburg, the most important Philip’s general and a bride of John’s nephew and heir Louis, son of count of Saint-Pol and Brienne (and thus also Philip’s vassal). Jeanne’s claim is much stronger than Adolf’s as she is a daughter of the eldest son of the eldest son of duke of Bar and her father has agreed to cede his claim to Bar only with a clause that in case both his uncles die without male issue (which is exactly what happened) he would get his claim back.\n\nIOTL John of Luxemburg has conquered from Rene the county of Guise but was unable to conquer Bar and in 1433 made a deal with Rene in which Jeanne ceded her claim to Bar in exchange for Guise.\n\nITTL Philip can buy the rights to Bar from Jeanne (i. e. John). Maybe as part of the deal John’s own county of Ligny can be expanded to include larger part of French Bar (and organize the conquest of this territory), but the title of duke should go to Philip so that Jeanne and her husband Louis can still be Philip’s vassals.\n\nThus in 1430-1431 Philip has an opportunity to buy the rights to Bar from two sides. He probably only needs Jeanne since her claim stronger (and in the end of 1431 the rights of Adolf to Bar expire since his only son by Yolande of Bar dies without heir)\n\nWhat do you think about this consequence of events? Does it look plausible or do you still think John the Fearless or Philip will try to push their claim to Bar earlier?\n\nIn other words Philip the Good was only duke of Burgundy, count of Flanders and Artois and count palatine of Burgundy by this point, between 1415-1419, far from certain to succeed in the duchies of Brabant & Limburg and the counties of Hainaut, Holland & Zeeland, even when they were within the Burgundian sphere.\n\nA small nitpic: of course Philip had also a bunch of smaller titles including Mechelen (Malines) and Salins. But your main point stands\n\nHere I have a a nuance.IMHO there's a difference between Isabella of Lorraine, heiress to the duchy of Lorraine and Isabella, just the daughter of the duke of Lorraine. IMHO Isabella would only be a misalliance, if she does not bring the duchy of Lorraine to the table. That IMHO changes a lot a would, and then she will be more valuable than a Bourbon (or Angevin) bride, which do not bring such a direct territorial expansion.\n\nThing is Margaret of Male are rare, Isabella of Lorraine, in a strategic region for Burgundy and next door, besides IOTL Phliop ended up marrying Bonne of Artois as a second wife, not the best option either. Without the duchy of Lorraine on the table, Isabella wouldn't be that great either, but that gives her an edge.\n\nI stand corrected as probably mesalliance is not the most fortunate wording.\n\nWhat I meant is that for most of John's life Isabella though she is a top-tier bride (as a direct heiress of a reasonably large and prestigious duchy) is not the best choice to advance John’s main agenda (i. e. establish political dominance over France). In 1417-1418 though she will both bring Burgundians an adjacent duchy, but will also serve well to further John’s goals at this juncture (i. e. take Paris by military means).\n\nThus while e. g. in 1416 or 1419 John may have preferred another bride for Philip (he might still have preferred Isabella but at least there are solid arguments for alternatives), in 1417-1418 she seems optimal both tactically (i. e. getting John what he needs now) and strategically (securing Lorrain for Burgundy).\n\nI don’t think there is much point in debating whether John would have preferred some other bride for his son if he wasn’t resolved to take Paris by force in 1417-1418, if we both agree that at least under specific circumstances Isabella seems a pretty ideal bride for Philip.\n\n2. The more important one is Rene the Good of Anjou who married Isabella of Lorraine IOTL.\n\nIn early to mid-1420s (when he probably should be engaged or married) he is count of Guise, he co-rules duchy of Bar with his grand-uncle (and is set to inherit it). He also is first in line for his brother Louis's many titles, but his brother is young and may still have heirs of his own (he didn’t IOTL and barring random butterflies probably won’t ITTL but there is no way to know this in 1420s). Anjou are of course important Armagnac supporters, Rene’s sister Mary will become dauphin Charles’s wife in 1422 (they were betrothed several years before the PoD, so this marriage will definitely happen ITTL), his younger brother Charles is dauphin’s close childhood friend and most importantly his mother is an extremely influential figure in Dauphinist France in 1410s-1430s (arguably the most influential).\n\nSo sum up, Rene is an important and well connected prince of blood, but not quite first-tier. I have a few possible brides for him, but no one fits him perfectly:\n\na. Joan of Valois, daughter of Charles of Orleans is the same age as Rene (IOTL she married John of Alencon and died without issue). She is an extremely desirable bride: her father is first in line of succession of France (according to Dauphinists of course and until future Louis XI is born; but even after that her father is second in succession), while her mother is a daughter of a king and a widow of a king. Joan is Charles’s only daughter (and is likely to remain such for a long time since Charles is in English captivity since the battle of Agincourt) and is set to inherit at least a decent number of his multiple titles in case of her father’s death without another heir (other titles would probably go to her uncles and/or would be restored to crown). In fact, she is so desirable that perhaps she is a bit out of Rene’s league. While arguably the same could be said about her OTL husband John of Alencon, his titles (duke of Alencon, count of Perche) are more prestigious than what Rene is certain to have in 1420s. Also, unlike Rene who in 1420s is not motivated to fight Burgundians even when they conquered his own county of Guise, Alencon is fighting Lancastrians since the first half of 1420s even if not particularly successfully (IOTL he was captured at battle of Verneuil in 1424, spent 5 years in captivity and had to sell basically all his possessions in order to ransom himself).\n\nThus marrying Joan to Alencon who lost most of his domains to English attack by the time of the marriage serves an important political message: remain faithful and you will be rewarded (and also provides a guarantee that Alencon would not switch his allegiance to Lancastrians in lieu of restoration of some of his titles however unlikely this possible scenario is).\n\nTo sum up, while Joan of Orleans marrying Rene instead of Alencon is possible, her OTL marriage seems to look a bit more plausible from my perspective.\n\nb. John of Alencon himself has a sister Charlotte 4 years younger than Rene (who IOTL died unmarried in 1435). John is an important Armagnac prince of blood (and thus marrying his sister would improve both Rene’s and Angevines in general standing among Dauphinists), moreover in mid to late 1420s Charlotte is John's heir, while he himself is in English captivity (and as Agincourt prisoners demonstrate such a captivity can last for decades).\n\nThis possible inheritance is not without a caveat: John’s domains are conquered by Lancastrians (and also confiscated by Lancastrian government which Dauphinists naturally did not recognize) and in case of John’s death without an heir a substantial part of his titles would probably be reverted to the crown. Charlotte would still probably receive some part of his inheritance such a scenario (if we look at the fate of John of Berry’s appanage as a precedent, a likely outcome would be Charlotte inheriting either county of Perche or duchy of Alencon while the other one coupled with smaller titles such as Domfront, Fougeres etc. going to the crown) and even such a conditional inheritance is valuable especially considering that both Alencon and Perche border the block of Angevine lands centered around Anjou and Maine. And if John’s lands were not conquered Charlotte probably would once again would be a top-tier bride a bit out of Rene’s league.\n\nc. Isabella of Brittany is 2 years younger than Rene. IOTL, she married Guy de Laval in 1430s, but Rene is a more high-profile groom and thus if Angevines are interested in improving relationship with John of Brittany it is a better match (and Guy de Laval can in such a scenario marry Isabelle’s sister Catherine who IOTL died after 1444 unmarried). The main blocker for such an arrangement is John’s double-faced policy at this stage of Hundred Years’ War (he switched sides at least 4 times). However, in 1425-1427 he is reconciled with the dauphin and this is probably the most appropriate time to wed Rene and Isabella in terms of age.\n\nd. Bonne, daughter of John of Armagnac who IOTL died unmarried in 1430s. However, her father pledged allegiance to king of Castille in 1425 and remained rather hostile to dauphin until late 1440s. Bonne, who was born in 1416 would not be in time to marry Rene before this event: at best she and Rene can be betrothed and I am not sure this betrothal can survive John Armagnac’s political maneuver.\n\ne. Rene can try to engage Philip’s rivals in the HRE.\n\nI don’t really have a good candidate here. A decent variant would be some close relative of Antoine de Vaudemont (IOTL Philip supported Antoine against Isabella and Rene; ITTL Antoine would still claim the duchy of Lorraine and thus become Philip’s rival). ITTL Antoine would presumably be recognized as a duke of Lorraine by Emperor Sigismund (IOTL he supported Isabella to spite Philip, ITTL he can do the same for another candidate). However, Antoine didn’t have daughters until much later and both his sisters are already married at the time of PoD (his sister Margaret would become widow in 1431, but marrying a widowed second daughter of a count is definitely below Rene’s status however important an ally Antione ITTL is)\n\nAnother important adversary of Philip in HRE is Frederick the Empty Pockets of Tyrol (who IOTL had quarrels with Philip over county of Ferrette in Upper Alsase which eventually led to war in 1430-1431). But he, once again, had no daughters that survived childhood. He had a number of nieces by Ernest the Iron though and was a regent after his brother’s death, so perhaps Rene can marry one of them.\n\nPhilip had other rivals in HRE, but most of them became active after Philip inherited Brabant and Limburg (i. e. after 1430) and by this time Rene should probably at least be betrothed.\n\nI personally think that either option b or option c are the most plausible, but IMHO none of these seem perfect. So I will be really gratefull for other suggestions (or for comments on the suggestions above)\n\nApparently, Isabella of Brittany (option c in my list) was engaged to Rene's elder brother Louis over an extended period of time until 1430 when the engagement was broken on Charles VII and his favourite (and main Angevine adversary among Dauphinists) Georges de la Trémoille's insistence, so she could marry Guy de Laval. This move on Charles’s part although brought Brittany a bit closer to him, strained the relationship with Angevins quite a bit (Yolande of Aragon was reportedly absolutely furious).\n\nI don’t see the reason why it all could turn up differently ITTL and maybe even try to explore the more permanent split between Angevines and Charles ITTL (especially considering the fact that Arthur de Richemont was both close to Angevines and happily married to Philip’s sister; IOTL during the split Arthur even participated in siege of Pouance in 1432 with his brother and in alliance with English).\n\nBut probably ITTL Philip will in 1430s try to grab Bar (see our discussion with @Janprimus above) suggested which should prevent the Angevin-Burgundian alliance from emerging (ITTL Philip had every chance to be magnanimous to Rene after he was captured, but preferred to squeeze every franc from his ransom). And of course, even if Philip for whatever reason is less greedy ITTL and if Burgundy has better relationship with Angevins and Charles VII has worse, I don’t see Angevins fully going over to Lancastrians: Mary of Anjou is still Charles VII’s wife, Charles of Anjou is his childhood friend, Yolande although pissed off is still really important figure at his court and above all Bedford is invested with Anjou and Maine and unlikely to relinquish this claim.\n\nThis means that Isabella is definitely not a possible bride for Rene and thus from my perspective Charlotte of Alencon (option b from my list) seems like a clear favorite.\n\nWhat do you guys think? @isabella , @Valena , @Kellan Sullivan, @Janprimus (sorry if forgot to tag someone). Would also be extremely grateful if you had any comments not related to this specific question.\n\nDid I get you right that there is no evidence that Louis of Bar has IOTL sold his inheritance in Bar to Angevins, but you believe that he could potentially sell it to Burgundians ITTL?\n\nRené of Anjou was IIRC his grand-nephew, but as an ordained bishop, Louis of Bar was pressured to release the rule of the duchy of Bar to someone else.IOTL his niece convinced him to make her son René his heir, so IMHO Burgundy has a change.\n\nI have a slightly different spin on it:\n\n1. Presumably in 1417-1419 Burgundians have their attention and resources focused on establishing and maintaining their power in Paris (and France in general) and cannot really allow themselves to be distracted from it. Burgundians may have discussions with Louis about selling his claim but they cannot really pressure him: he is a Burgundian party supporter and forcing him to give up his inheritance to John/Philip instead of his relative is not the best move politically (IOTL John did employ heavy-handed tactics to take counties of Macon, Tonnerre and Boulogne but in these cases he acted either against royal domain or against his own vassals who became Armagnac supporters; Louis de Bar is neither Burgundy’s vassal nor Armagnac )\n\nIMHO Burgundy could definitely make an offer, during the process, when the niece of Louis, was still convincing her uncle.\n\n2. In 1419 Louis of Bar finally decides to name Rene his heir. IOTL the ceremony happened in August 1419, less than a month before the assassination of John the Fearless. ITTL this may happen on schedule (and in this case Burgundians will have no time to react before the assassination even if they would like to) or to be a bit delayed (if Louis of Bar is less motivated to name Rene his heir without the perspective of inheriting Lorraine). I think though that the death of John the Fearless should be the final straw for the Louis even if he would have more doubts than IOTL.\n\nPhilip might wish to punish Louis, but the duke of Burgundy has a lot on his plate and it is not the smartest tactics to antagonize a man who is neutral in war and may still join Burgundians (IOTL Louis has recognized the treaty of Troyes in 1428 and even participated in that year’s campaign in Eastern Champagne)\n\nDepends on the date of TTL marriage between Philip and Isabella , this could be earlier than the assassination, and thus any potential sale of Bar.\n\n3. Duke Adolf of Berg who has a claim to Bar through his wife (younger sister of Louis) tries to take Bar by force as IOTL. IOTL he was captured in 1422 and as a part of ransom he had to renounce his rights to Bar. ITTL however Louis and Rene don’t have Lorraine on their side. While I still don’t believe in Adolf’s victory, his defeat would not be nearly as crushing and he might not be captured.\n\nI agree.\n\n4. In 1423 a first cousin once removed of Adolf, Reinald of Julich and Guelders dies. Julich and Guelders are much closer to Bar and naturally would be a priority for Adolf. He has to fight Arnold of Egmond for these duchies who is supported by Philip the Good. As per OTL Adolf manages to get Julich, but not Guelders.\n\nDeep in their heart Burgundy wasn't really supporting the Van Egmonds, they wanted the duchy of Gelre (and county of Zutphen) for themselves. The duchy of Jülich/Gulik would have surrounded the imperial Imperial Town of Aachen, but more importantly Jülich was the birthright of Adolf.\n\n5. In 1429 Rene and Louis switch to Dauphinists and in 1430 Rene participates in Armagnac campaigns in Champagne and Duchy of Burgundy. Louis also dies in 1430 so all the reasons to limit Burgundian activity towards Bar is gone.\n\nI agree.\n\n6. IOTL in 1431 Adolf has signed a treaty where he promised to support Philip’s acquisition of Luxemburg (he and Philip also promised each other mutual defense and security). ITTL Adolf may receive a larger sum of money but also agree to sell his son’s rights to Bar (which he has no realistic way of enforcing given the prominence of Rene in Champagne and Dauphinist France in general), but probably Philip doesn’t need this to claim Bar (see below).\n\nI again agree.\n\nPhilip also has another claimant to Bar under his sway: Jeanne of Bar (countess of Soisson, Marle etc. etc.) who is a stepdaughter of John Luxemburg, the most important Philip’s general and a bride of John’s nephew and heir Louis, son of count of Saint-Pol and Brienne (and thus also Philip’s vassal). Jeanne’s claim is much stronger than Adolf’s as she is a daughter of the eldest son of the eldest son of duke of Bar and her father has agreed to cede his claim to Bar only with a clause that in case both his uncles die without male issue (which is exactly what happened) he would get his claim back.\n\nIOTL John of Luxemburg has conquered from Rene the county of Guise but was unable to conquer Bar and in 1433 made a deal with Rene in which Jeanne ceded her claim to Bar in exchange for Guise.\n\nITTL it might not be unlikely that Jeanne may keep Guise now as a compensation for Burgundy-Lorraine keeping Bar.\n\nITTL Philip can buy the rights to Bar from Jeanne (i. e. John). Maybe as part of the deal John’s own county of Ligny can be expanded to include larger part of French Bar (and organize the conquest of this territory), but the title of duke should go to Philip so that Jeanne and her husband Louis can still be Philip’s vassals.\n\nThus in 1430-1431 Philip has an opportunity to buy the rights to Bar from two sides. He probably only needs Jeanne since her claim stronger (and in the end of 1431 the rights of Adolf to Bar expire since his only son by Yolande of Bar dies without heir)\n\nI wouldn't expand Ligny directly, but give the count of Ligny also a or some additional fiefs in Bar, if needed.\n\nWhat do you think about this consequence of events? Does it look plausible or do you still think John the Fearless or Philip will try to push their claim to Bar earlier?\n\nIMHO there are two windows an early one and a late one, as you described. I'm very grateful you elaborated on the matter.\n\nA small nitpic: of course Philip had also a bunch of smaller titles including Mechelen (Malines) and Salins. But your main point stands\n\nAs a native of the Burgundian Netherlands I plea guilty to oversimplification, but I stand by the remark that it still is a smaller Valois-Burgundy.\n\nI stand corrected as probably mesalliance is not the most fortunate wording.\n\nWhat I meant is that for most of John's life Isabella though she is a top-tier bride (as a direct heiress of a reasonably large and prestigious duchy) is not the best choice to advance John’s main agenda (i. e. establish political dominance over France). In 1417-1418 though she will both bring Burgundians an adjacent duchy, but will also serve well to further John’s goals at this juncture (i. e. take Paris by military means).\n\nThus while e. g. in 1416 or 1419 John may have preferred another bride for Philip (he might still have preferred Isabella but at least there are solid arguments for alternatives), in 1417-1418 she seems optimal both tactically (i. e. getting John what he needs now) and strategically (securing Lorrain for Burgundy).\n\nWell John the Fearless also had a couple of daughters, which can and will be used instead, either by him or their brother Philip. IMHO at least one IOTL English match will be axed.\n\nI don’t think there is much point in debating whether John would have preferred some other bride for his son if he wasn’t resolved to take Paris by force in 1417-1418, if we both agree that at least under specific circumstances Isabella seems a pretty ideal bride for Philip.\n\nI agree.\n\nBTW sorry for the late response, I had some busy days.\n\nIMHO there are two windows an early one and a late one, as you described. I'm very grateful you elaborated on the matter.\n\nThank you very much for your response.\n\nRené of Anjou was IIRC his grand-nephew, but as an ordained bishop, Louis of Bar was pressured to release the rule of the duchy of Bar to someone else.IOTL his niece convinced him to make her son René his heir, so IMHO Burgundy has a change.\n\nIMHO Burgundy could definitely make an offer, during the process, when the niece of Louis, was still convincing her uncle.\n\nYes, I agree that there are two windows of opportunities for acquisition and I do think John and Philip would probably try to offer to buy out Bar from Louis in 1417-1419. However I don't see many reasons for Louis to accept this offer other than his general alignment closer to Burgundians than to Armagnacs (and perhaps also his desire for ending rivalry with Lorraine) and I don't think John or Philip can realistically pressure Louis.\n\nI can see Louis choosing one of his other close relatives (i. e. either Adolf who is married to Louis younger sister or Jeanne de Bar who is daughter of his eldest brother’s son as opposed to Rene who is a son of Louis's eldest sister's daughter), but probably not someone who has no real connection to Louis.\n\nSo I personally think that the later opportunity (via buying of Jeanne with money and or land grants) looks more plausible\n\nDepends on the date of TTL marriage between Philip and Isabella , this could be earlier than the assassination, and thus any potential sale of Bar.\n\nI think about the following timeline: Michelle dies in spring 1417 shortly after her brother John of Touraine. Philip and Isabella are betrothed sometime in the summer and marry probably in 1418 (either before the Paris campaign of John or reasonably soon after that).\n\nThus the marriage happens quite a while before Louis names his heir, he may even truly consider John and Philip's offer to buy Bar. However I think he will chose Rene either immediately before the bridge of Montereau incident or shortly after it (the assassination may serve as a final push for Louis to pick Angevines)\n\nDeep in their heart Burgundy wasn't really supporting the Van Egmonds, they wanted the duchy of Gelre (and county of Zutphen) for themselves. The duchy of Jülich/Gulik would have surrounded the imperial Imperial Town of Aachen, but more importantly Jülich was the birthright of Adolf.\n\nSure, but probably above all he didn't want a united duchy Julich-Berg-Guelders as unlike smaller holdings it could become a truly independent player. This strategy even worked: both Guelders and Julich-Berg (as well as Cleves) became highly dependent on Burgundy even ifGuelders while tried to combat this influence (which in the end led to duchy being annexed by Charles the Bold). Presumably making the same with united Julich-Berg-Guelders would be much much more difficult\n\nITTL it might not be unlikely that Jeanne may keep Guise now as a compensation for Burgundy-Lorraine keeping Bar.\n\nI don't think that would work since under the framework of Lancastrian France John of Luxemburg already was a legitimate count of Guise since 1422 (when Henry V officially confiscated the county from Rene and invested John with it; Henry VI government i. e. Bedford confirmed this grant in 1423).\n\nWhile IOTL John was willing to negotiate with Rene to remove his claim (in the end it didn’t work as Charles VII confiscated Guise no matter what, he simply didn’t return it to Rene), Philip almost certainly needs something else to buy out his vassal, presumably some combination of money and additional fiefs in Bar.\n\nI wouldn't expand Ligny directly, but give the count of Ligny also a or some additional fiefs in Bar, if needed.\n\nAgreed, giving John/Jeanne additional fiefs in Bar is probably a better legal framework for compensation than expanding the county of Ligny directly.\n\nWell John the Fearless also had a couple of daughters, which can and will be used instead, either by him or their brother Philip. IMHO at least one IOTL English match will be axed.\n\nSure, and IOTL Philip used his sisters for advancing his political agenda really effectively (and when he ran out sisters, he used his nieces from Cleves and great-nieces from Guelders). But marring younger daughters (later sisters) of duke of Burgundy does not have nearly as powerful effect as marrying the only heir of the duke or the duke himself.\n\nStill with Philip the Good married to Isabel of Lorraine ITTL, this will have effect on the marriages of his sisters, which will have to make up for a bit for relative misalliance of Philip ITTL.\n\nIOTL Marie of Burgundy was married to duke Adolf of Cleves; Margaret of Burgundy was first married to Dauphin Louis of Valois (who died in 1415, she only remarried in 1423), then the mentioned Richard of Richemont; Anne of Burgundy was married to John of Lancaster, duke of Bedford; and Agnes of Burgundy married duke Charles I of Bourbon.\n\nThis might mean ITTL Burgundy might be looking for a more advantageous second husband for Margaret of Burgundy.\n\nSo she may be on the list?\n\nIMHO she, Margaret, seems to be the most obvious one to look for a better match ITTL. Cleves, Bedford (as a proxy for England) and Bourbon aren't too bad as marriage alliances. The earldom of Richmond not so much, especially since Richard of Richemont only became duke of Brittany after the OTL death of Margaret.\n\nIMHO Philip chose husbands for all his sisters really, really well.\n\nAnne simply has to marry Bedford since this marriage is an important part of Burgundian-English alliance. I we don't butterfly away John's murder and this alliance, the marriage is a must. Also, it could potentially be really profitable since Bedford made Philip his heir in the kingdom of France in case he had no direct descendants (and he didn't have them IOTL)\n\nAgnes who married Charles of Bourbon was a pillar of the truce first with Bourbon and later with Dauphin himself (which Philip absolutely needs in order to combat Humphrey ambitions in Netherlands). Also duke of Bourbon is among top 4 non-royal lanowners in France, so realistically she couldn't do that much better.\n\nI agree that if one marriage has to go, it has to be Margaret’s. However, Arthur de Richemont (his name was Arthur, not Richard) is not an earl of Richmond (it was a titular earldom). He is brother of duke of Brittany though and he was necessary for the triple alliance of Bedford, Philip and John of Brittany (treaty of Amiens of 1423). This treaty is what defined Burgundian-English cooperation in 1420s-1430s and is really important for Philip's policy. Additionally, Arthur was not a peasant himself, he was granted the duchy of Touraine by English which he forfeited after his switching back to Dauphin (so when Margaret was marrying him, he was a duke) and recieved quite a few titles from Dauphin after that as well as the position of Constable of Dauphinist France (which Arthur held for more than 30 years).\n\nMoreover while the whole Arthur switching sides (which he presumably did after asking for advice from Philip) presumably didn’t work for duke of Burgundy all that well (although it was a decent safety net against English which Philip desperately needed in 1424-1425: it did serve as a reminder to Bedford that Philip can go to Dauphin himself and was probably one of the reasons why Bedford continuously supported Philip against his own brother Humphrey), Arthur became the leader of pro-Burgundian party at the court of Charles VII and improved Philip’s relationship with Angevines, who also had good relationship with Arthur (which Philip later screwed with his treatment of Rene in 1430s)\n\nSo Arthur is a pretty perfect way for Philip hedge his bets a little bit in regards to Dauphinists and Lancastrians and arguably Philips really needs this in the period when Humphrey is trying to wrestle Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland from Philip.\n\nHaving said all that, Margaret herself was not thrilled with the candidature of Arthur for her hand (she was, after all a widow of dauphin and she considered Arthur below her statue). IOTL Philip has convinced Margaret to marry Arthur, but if any one marriage has to go it is this one. However I don’t see a lot of candidates for Margaret of better standing than Arthur.\n\nIf anyone has a better groom for Margaret, I'd be happy to hear about it (although I do think that while her OTL marriage had its flaws, he did serve quite a few important purposes really well)"
