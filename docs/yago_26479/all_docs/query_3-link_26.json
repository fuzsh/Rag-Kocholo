        "text": "Isabella (1400 – 28 February 1453) was suo jure Duchess of Lorraine, from 25 January 1431 to her death in 1453. She was the first wife of Duke René of Anjou, King of Naples, and the mother of his children, which included Margaret of Anjou, Queen consort of England as the wife of Henry VI. From 1435 to 1442, Isabella was Queen consort of Naples, and from 1442 until her death she was the titular queen consort. During her husband's absences, she acted as regent for his domains.\n\nLife[]\n\nShe was the eldest daughter of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine and Margaret of the Palatinate. Her paternal grandparents were John I, Duke of Lorraine and Sophie of Wurttemberg. Her maternal grandparents were Rupert of Germany and Elisabeth of Nuremberg, daughter of Burgrave Frederick V of Nuremberg and Elisabeth of Meissen.\n\nIsabella inherited the duchy from her father upon his death, and ruled jointly with her husband, Duke René of Anjou, also Duke of Bar and King of Naples, whom she had married in 1419. During his absence, she acted as regent for his domains. She led an army to rescue her husband from Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, who held René in captivity from 1434 until 1436. The mid-16th century Chronicle of Gaspare Fuscolillo records that Isabella arrived in Naples on 15 October 1435.[1] René and Isabella had the following children:\n\nThat lived to adulthood:\n\nJohn II of Anjou and King of Naples (1425 – 16 December 1470), married Marie de Bourbon, daughter of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, by whom he had issue. He also had several illegitimate children.\n\nLouis (16 October 1427 – between 22 May and 16 October 1444[2]), Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson and Lieutenant General of Lorraine. At the age of five, in 1432, he was sent as a hostage to Dijon with his brother John in exchange for their captive father. John was released, but Louis was not and died of pneumonia in prison.\n\nYolande of Anjou (2 November 1428 – 23 March 1483), married Frederick of Lorraine, count of Vaudemont; mother of duke René II of Lorraine, by whom she had issue.\n\nMargaret of Anjou (23 March 1430 – 25 August 1482), married King Henry VI of England, by whom she had a son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales.\n\nThat died in childhood:\n\nIsabelle (born between 1420 and 1425)\n\nNicolas (2 November 1428 – 1430), twin with Yolande.\n\nCharles (1431–1432), Count of Guise.\n\nRené (born 1426)\n\nLouise (1436–1438)\n\nAnne (1437–1450, buried in Gardanne)\n\nIsabella died on 28 February 1453 at the age of about 53 years. Her son John succeeded her as Duke of Lorraine. She was buried in Angers Cathedral.[1] René then married, on 10 September 1454, Jeanne de Laval, but this marriage was childless.\n\nSee also[]\n\nDukes of Lorraine family tree\n\nReferences[]\n\nSalmonson, Jessica Amanda (1991) The Encyclopedia of Amazons.
