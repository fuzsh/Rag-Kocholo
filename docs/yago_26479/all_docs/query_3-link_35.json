Margaret as a king's daughter would be even more attractive to people pulling the rule in England instead of Henry. Louis might forfeit Anjou on the grounds of Rene being sovereign king and sovereign kings were forbidden from having any holdings in France (as example of Charles the Bad of Navarre shows us). If Rene himself is released earlier, this means that his second son, Louis, marquis of Pont-a-Mousson is not held captive by Burgundians, thus does not catch pneumonia and could be made heir to Anjou by Rene, preventing one person holding Anjou and Naples at the same time. I think his male heir wouldn't die, the same way, Louis being not imprisoned would not contract pneumonia, and actually having resources of Naples to rely on, Jean might be more succesful in his bid for Aragonese crown. I think Nicolas would marry Anne of France, as it was planned OTL. @Kellan Sullivan @VVD0D95 @isabella @Jan Olbracht\n\nWhy not?

John’s wedding to Marie of Bourbon also would be in doubt if his father is already King of Naples in 1444 (when he married her).\n\nIf John still married Marie and they had their OTL children is quite possible who Nicholas’ siblings lived (he had an older brother René (born 1446) and two older sisters Isabella (born 1445) and Marie (b 1447) and possibly another brother Jean)\n\nNicholas as heir of Naples will likely marry Ippolita Sforza not Anne of France (unless the Anjou were particularly close to the Orléans)\n\nWhy not have Yolande of Anjou marry Louis XI as well...\n\nWould he like to marry her?\n\nThe daughter of Rene who surely will marry differently than OTL is Yolande who as daughter of a King would surely marry much better...

A son and daughter of Anjou (Marie and Louis) married to a son and daughter of Aragon (Alfonso and Maria) - just updated. Blanca and Carlos IV to Yolande/Marguerite and Jean? Leonor of Aragon can marry either Enrique IV of Castile or Henry VI of England\n\nMaybe René if was able to take Naples before 1440 we can see a sort of peace with the Trastamaras with his son John marrying Eleanor of Navarre?\n\nYolande as daughter of a King would be a good option for Louis XI, specially if she has some chances to eventually bring Anjou to her husband/son\n\nI think it's not so much probable, if Rene can be king of Naples why can't he run also for Aragonese crown to which he has valid claims? So OK, Louis would probably marry Yolande in this scenario. Who would Antoine de Vaudemont, her OTL husband, marry ITTL?\n\nWhy not have Yolande of Anjou marry Louis XI as well...\n\nWould Rene of Anjou have liked Louis XI, Rene was on the side of Charles VII and he had a difficult relationship with his son, Louis would also still be married to margaret of scotland at the time 1444 (she dies in 1445). HE was also very disrespectful of agnes sorel who worked for Rene's wife for a time. By the time his wife died Louis was kicked out of the royal court.\n\nI think it's not so much probable, if Rene can be king of Naples why can't he run also for Aragonese crown to which he has valid claims?

With France support yes but why did this not happen in OTL if possible. Would Rene focus on getting Bosnia as a vazzal to gain it's silver mine income? (meanwhile Stephen Tomašević would have subsisted of salt incomes )\n\nWould he have had the finances? With France support yes but why did this not happen in OTL if possible.

(meanwhile Stephen Tomašević would have subsisted of salt incomes )\n\nBosnia was a vassal of Hungary/Ottomans and both states were richer than Naples, so I suspect that this would be big no-no for Rene. Naples was quite rich on it's own, and if Louis XI married Rene's daughter, he'd feel obligated to help his father-in-law in his struggle, also it'd mean that France would be surrounded by French-friendly states.\n\nBosnia was a vassal of Hungary/Ottomans and both states were richer than Naples, so I suspect that this would be big no-no for Rene.

Ivaniš Pavlović, sent by King Thomas, attacked Stjepan Vukčić. Thomas had at the same time been recognized by the Hungarian regent John Hunyadi. Stjepan turned to King Alfonso V of Aragon, who made him \"Knight of the Virgin\", but did not give him troops. On 15 February 1444, Stjepan signed a treaty with the King of Aragon and Naples, becoming his vassal in exchange for Alfonso's help against his enemies, namely King Thomas, Duke Ivaniš Pavlović and the Republic of Venice. In the same treaty Stjepan promised to pay regular tribute to Alfonso instead of paying the Ottoman sultan as he had done until then.\n\nFor someone with financial worries and having won his crown by battle it would not have been a bad deal something to consider at least\n\nand if Louis XI married Rene's daughter, he'd feel obligated to help his father-in-law in his struggle, also it'd mean that France would be surrounded by French-friendly states.\n\nWhen Louis became avaible he was cast out by his father and later living with the burgundians, ...what a price.\n\nAlphonso didn't support Stjepan and why Rene should support him? He's not going to need much more money than Alphonso.\n\nThe ottomans could be a threat for the kingdom of naples a strong Bosnia could have aided with that, Aragon does not necesairly needs to be a enemy and will be in civil war, better to wait and see and skoop up catalonia afther this potential cival war, also there was a economic crisis (Great Bullion Famine). It would also promote cristianity wich would please the pope this would be in the intrest of naples. I can probably think of more reasons\n\nThe ottomans could be a threat for the kingdom of naples a strong Bosnia could have aided with that, Aragon does not necesairly needs to be a enemy and will be in civil war, better to wait and see and skoop up catalonia afther this potential cival war, also there was a economic crisis (Great Bullion Famine).

It didn't help it. The best thing for Bosnia would be removing idiots known as Kotromanichi from power.\n\nSo Byzantium is a dead man walking full of very crafty people where are they going to go if Byzantium falls? Naples isn't that far off, His grandchildren might earn the title of emperor. Byzantium surviving would be great for rene Byzantium falling would perhaps be even better (for naples)..\n\nAbouth the idiots who knows a strong common enemy? I'm not saying they will survive but they might try."
