        "text": "The Château de Tarascon, located in the Bouches-du-Rhône department not far from Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, is in a remarkable state of conservation, thanks to the restoration work carried out by the architects of the historical monuments. It is one of the most magnificent medieval castles in France. Built at the beginning of the 15th century on a rocky islet, this monument is made up of two distinct parts: to the north, a farmyard dedicated to the staff and soldiers, and to the south, the dwelling. Its location on the banks of the Rhône was strategic, as it served as a monumental sentinel controlling the political border. The terrace of the Château de Tarascon offers a panoramic view of the river, the Alpilles and the Montagnette.\n\nThe story of the castle\n\nIn the 13th century, a first castle stood on the present site of the Château de Tarascon.\n\nThe castle was rebuilt by the two Dukes of Anjou between 1400 and 1435 with the help of the architect Jean Robert. The materials used for the construction of the building were taken from quarries in Beaucaire. King René I, heir to the county of Provence, made some modifications to the building between 1447 and 1449 with the help of Jean Serocourt and Regnault de Serocourt in order to make the castle more habitable. In the main courtyard, he had a niche built to display his bust and that of Queen Jeanne de Laval. During his many stays, he organized prestigious parties and made the castle a privileged meeting place. After his death, the monument was used only occasionally.\n\nThe Château de Tarascon would be used very early as a place of detention. Already in 1480, a Catalan prisoner, supporter of the King of Aragon, enemy of King René I, was locked up in the dungeons. On the wall, he engraved representations of warships, merchant ships, but also religious and secular motifs. From the 17th century until 1926, when the prison was definitively closed, the prison function was accentuated, and modifications were made to transform the rooms into collective or individual dungeons. During the French Revolution, Robespierre’s supporters were executed there.\n\nThe damage caused by the transformation of the castle into a prison would be repaired by the architects of the Historical Monuments from 1932. The partitions in the rooms were removed and the windows were reopened. From 1940 to 1980, the numerous restoration works allowed the Château de Tarascon to regain the look it had in the time of the Dukes of Anjou.\n\nA medieval fortress in Gothic and Renaissance style\n\nTo enter the Château de Tarascon, you have to cross a bridge which spans a moat.\n\nThe stately home is surrounded by a 4-meter thick wall, with two round towers to the east and flanked by two square towers on the Rhône side. In the center, the main courtyard stands out for its elegant architecture in contrast to the austere facade of the castle. It features Gothic-style arches and ribbed vaults resting on consoles with animal sculptures: chimeras, eagles, bats, etc. It connects the different ceremonial, service, and residence rooms of the princes of Anjou. The niche that housed the busts of King René I and his wife is still present on the south façade of the main courtyard. A magnificent staircase with 19 windows gives access to the terrace and the three floors of the residence. The first two have French ceilings while the last one has vaults.\n\nThe outbuilding houses an incredible collection of pharmacy pots, ewers and urns that belonged to the former hospital of Tarascon. These objects are displayed in a paneling dating from the 18th century.\n\nGraffiti dating from the time when the castle was transformed into a prison can be seen in all the rooms of the castle. The architects of the Historical Monuments wanted to preserve them, because they retrace an important part of the history of the building."
