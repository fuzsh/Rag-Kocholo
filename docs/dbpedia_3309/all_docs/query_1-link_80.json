        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg is setting the record straight. The View host was recently interviewed by Raven-Symoné and her wife Miranda Maday. The Disney alum claimed that the EGOT winner gave her “lesbian vibes.”\n\nBefore Goldberg responded, Maday added that, “I think she just wants everybody to be gay and she’s just really hoping you’ll come out right here, right now.”\n\n“Women have been asking me this for as long as I’ve been around, I am not a lesbian,” Goldberg responded. The Sister Act actress added that she’s played them on television but it does not reflect her personal life.\n\nThe actress has been married three times. From 1973-1979 she was married to drug counselor Alvin Martin who was from England. She later tied the knot with Dutch cinematographer and director David Claessen in 1986 and they divorced two years later. Lastly, she got married to actor Lyle Trachtenberg in 1994 and the two split the following year.\n\nGoldberg spoke about her past marriages earlier this month on an episode of The View.\n\nRELATED: The Best Hip-Hop Couples Of 2023\n\n“I always knew, I always thought, ‘You didn’t want to do this, and you knew you didn’t want to do it, and you did it anyway,’ so shut up and move on,” she said per Decider. She added, “I kept doing what everyone kept saying I was supposed to do and then I was like, ‘this is getting expensive and boring.'”\n\nThe other hosts also chimed in with their experiences surrounding divorce. “As somebody who’s been divorced, I just want to say that there’s a special type of rage involved when you get divorced,” Joy Behar, who split from her first husband in 1981, explained. “You’re murderous. You’re homicidal.”\n\nShe continued, “There’s something about — even if you want the divorce — there’s something about that wrenching that makes you homicidal.”\n\nAlyssa Farrah Griffin, whose parents got divorced when she was a child, added that it is “the hardest thing to get over” for some people.\n\nThe View airs on weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.\n\n50 Celebrities You Didn't Know Are LGTBQ+\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
