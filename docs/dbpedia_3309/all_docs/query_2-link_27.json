        "text": "BRAINERD — Rachael Kline wouldn’t say she’s a saint but she acts like a nun.\n\nThe Little Falls resident plays Deloris the \"nun\" in Brainerd Community Theatre’s production of \"Sister Act,\" a musical comedy based on the 1992 movie starring Whoopi Goldberg.\n\n“It’s probably one of my favorite movies,” Kline said of her first role as a leading actress in a community theater production.\n\nThe 33-year-old is a freelance social media and digital content creator, mother and engaged and a veteran of the stage, having acted last year in Brainerd Community Theatre productions of “Elf: The Musical” and “Xanadu: The Musical,’ which were also based on movies.\n\n“I found a lot more of the jokes funnier as an adult,” Kline said of “Sister Act” the movie. “Obviously, as an adult, I can understand where she's coming from.”\n\nThe musical comedy centers around disco diva Deloris Van Cartier, who witnesses a murder and is put in protective custody — as a nun in a convent, where supposedly she will be safe.\n\n“It’s the biggest role that I've ever taken on,” Kline said. “And I've never been the sole focus of a show, which has been a little anxiety-inducing but also super, super fun.”\n\nFeaturing original music by Tony and Oscar winner Alan Menken (“Newsies,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “Little Shop of Horrors”), “Sister Act” the musical was nominated for five Tony Awards, including best musical.\n\n“In the original Broadway production, Deloris is played by Patina Miller, who was one of my, like, all-time Broadway inspirations, so when I heard that Brainerd was potentially doing ‘Sister Act,’ I got pretty excited,” Kline said.\n\nDisguised as a nun but not an actual nun, Deloris Van Cartier soon finds herself at odds with both the rigid lifestyle and uptight Mother Superior played by Sharon Hartley.\n\n“The musical, while it follows the plot of the movie, it's a little different, so, initially, I was listening to the Broadway musical soundtrack, just to see if it was something in my range that I could be comfortable singing. … And the show is very funny, and it's a really fun time,” Kline said.\n\nAccording to a synopsis: “Using her unique disco moves and singing talent to inspire the choir, Deloris breathes new life into the church and community but, in doing so, blows her cover.”\n\n“I would say if you loved Church Basement Ladies, you'll love ‘Sister Act,’” Kline said. “Church Basement Ladies does really well in our area because there's a very large Lutheran population in Minnesota … but there's still a large Catholic population and there's a lot of jokes in there.”\n\nAmy Borash is the choreographer and director of Brainerd Community Theatre’s production of “Sister Act,” which will take place at 7 p.m. July 26-28 and Aug. 2-4 at Central Lakes College’s Chalberg Theatre in Brainerd.\n\n“It’s (about) a nightclub singer who is dating a mob boss and she witnesses a murder accidentally and then has to go into witness protection so that her mob boss boyfriend doesn't kill her, and she gets put into a convent and hilarity ensues,” Borash said.\n\n“Sister Act” was one of the more financially successful comedies of the early 1990s, grossing $231 million worldwide, and was followed by the 1993 sequel “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit” and the musical adaptation that premiered in 2006.\n\n“The movie music had kind of a Motown feel to it,” Borash said. “Now the stage version does not have the same music. It is completely new music written for the show, but it still has that kind of disco, Motown sort of a feel to it.”\n\nThe 53-year-old wife and mother of two from Baxter teaches dance at Music General and works part time at a boutique in the winter.\n\nBorash said, “Staging a full-scale musical that has a lot of movement in a community theater setting is always a challenge just because you are working with people that this is just not what they normally do.’\n\nAuditions for the production took place in May with rehearsals following soon after.\n\n“We had three weeks of vocal rehearsal because that's the other challenging thing for this show is the music, which is really challenging,” Borash said. “In this show, there's some pretty heavy-duty harmonies and such.\n\n“I think its appeal is just the nature of people learning to accept each other's differences, learning to find common ground, not giving up on yourself, not giving up on, you know, your dreams. A lot of themes like that run through the show.”\n\nWhat: “Sister Act,” a musical comedy by Brainerd Community Theatre.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. July 26-28 and Aug. 2-4.\n\nWhere: Central Lakes College, Chalberg Theatre, Brainerd.\n\nCost: $17 for adults, $15 for seniors, $10 for those under 18 and CLC students.\n\nMore info: www.clcperformingarts.com or 218-855-8199."
