        "text": "As someone who has sparkled in classic films and TV shows for decades, Abbott Elementary’s Sheryl Lee Ralph knows a thing or two about aging with flair. In fact, the Emmy-winning actress reminisced about being in 1993’s Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit with costar Whoopi Goldberg on The View this week. Although they were both stunned that the film recently hit its 30-year anniversary, it’s clear that they’ve maintained a close relationship since then. “First of all, it was so good that it was not the last time we would work together,” Ralph said before walking down memory lane.\n\nThen Goldberg shocked her with two requests: “The producers here at The View are working on putting together a reunion,” Goldberg said, referring to how the show plans to honor the film’s 30th anniversary. “And we’re gonna try to get as many cast members on and to share memories from the movie. Would you do us the honor of coming back? And as soon as we know when it is, we’ll do that. But I will also do this: You know, we’re in the process of putting together [Sister Act] 3. Will you come be part of it, whatever it is?” Tune in to the clip below to see how Ralph reacted to these thoughtful invitations.\n\nIt’s clear that the film franchise holds a special place in both of their hearts. And this isn’t the only time Goldberg has mentioned a third Sister Act film. She has about it over the years, mentioning other celebs she’d love to join the cast. Goldberg also teased it online during an international trip to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican last fall. In 2020, Disney officially announced that the third film was in development, with Tyler Perry as a producer, and Goldberg as both a producer and a cast member. It will be released on Disney+."
