        "text": "Folks at the Cape Fear Regional Theatre have some news for you.\n\n“The show will have you ready to rejoice in your seat!” They’re promoting “Sister Act,” the musical currently underway at the old playhouse on Haymount Hill.\n\nIf you are hearing about home runs down the hill along Hay Street at Segra Stadium, where our minor league baseball Fayetteville Woodpeckers perform, you may want to know that Alexis Tidwell, Danette Holden, Alessandra Antonelli, Kelsey Wilson, Shirley Proctor, Joshua Walker, Juan Calix and the talented all-star cast of “Sister Act” is hitting grand slams one after another.\n\n“We wanted to go out with a bang and brought in an incredible team to make this show possible,” Mary Catherine Burke, the theater’s artistic director, says about the season finale before construction begins on renovation of the theater, circa 1962. “From the cast to the designers to the incredible creative team.”\n\nEvery show has been a sellout since “Sister Act” opened May 2, and so successful, Burke says, the production is being extended another week through June 2.\n\n“We are so lucky to have actors like Alessandra ‘Ally’ Antonelli, Danette Holden and Joshua Walker return to CFRT,” Burke says. “Ally was Wednesday Addams in ‘The Addams Family,’ Danette Holden was in our dance piece of ‘The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical’ that we did during Covid with The Cape Fear Botanical Garden and Joshua Walker was Jack the Bear in last season’s ‘Jelly’s Last Jam.’ These returning alumni are a testament to the work that is happening at CFRT. And we are delighted that Alexis Tidwell joined us for the first time this year. They are a remarkable company.”\n\nTidwell is the lead, and an actor with a singing voice that resonates throughout the theater.\n\nLet there be no question about her stage presence, either.\n\nTidwell is a showstopper, and she’s not the only showstopper. Actor after actor has his or her moment to the delight of each audience.\n\n“Sister Act” is under the direction of West Hyler, a longtime friend of Burke. Hyler succeeded Burke as director at the New York Musical Festival, when Burke took the reins as artistic director for CFRT.\n\n“West and I have known each other for probably 15 years or so,” Burke says. “We met back in New York City. He recently moved to South Carolina, so, I was delighted that he was right in our back yard and could join us.”\n\nThere’s no other way to say it — “Sister Act” is a hit on Haymount Hill as CFRT embarks on a $20 million redesign of the playhouse.\n\n“Audiences are rejoicing!” the vivacious Burke says. “So far, all 10 of our 10 performances have been sold out. Audiences are loving it, and not only did we add a Sunday, May 19, performance, but we also added a whole week of shows. We are now running through June 2.”\n\n‘Bo Thorp looking down with a hugh smile’\n\nWhile playgoers are rocking in their seats for each performance and marveling at this hide-away nun from gangsters in a parish where the choir can’t sing a lick, so is the CFRT board of directors — which include Bill Hedgepeth, Karen Tisdale, Zach Pritchett, Rollinda Thomas, Lauren Allred, Al Aycock, SarahMarie Barbour, Carol Briggs, Cheryl Y. Burns, Judy Chavis, Carolyn Dawson, Meghan Engle, John Holmes, Lucy Jones, Marilyn Kiser, Juelle McDonald, Antoine McGill, Tiffany Pennink, Charles Pimble, Marie Runkle, Darsweil Rodgers, Taylor Whitley and Jenny deViere\n\n“I am thrilled with the success of Sister Act,” says deViere, the board president since January. “We have sold out every performance, which is why the theatre decided to extend the run. All of the shows this year have just built on the success of one another. ‘The Play that Goes Wrong’ last fall was the highest grossing non-musical in the history of the CFRT, only to beat itself with the encore of ‘The Play that Goes Wrong 2.0,’ as we have penned it.\n\n“In a time where many theatres across the country are shutting their doors post-Covid, our theatre is thriving. I give credit in large part to Mary Kate and Ella Wrenn (CFRT’s managing director) for their forethought in planning the renovation project to begin during Covid, when most other theaters were dark and losing money. Our directors found a way to raise money, which I think is not only because of Mary Kate and Ella, but also the passion our givers have to support entities and ideas that strengthen the fabric of our community like theatre and the arts.\n\n“I could go on and on about the CFRT,” deViere says. “As a child, I spent a large part of my life performing in shows at the CFRT. To be able to play a small part in its continued growth and success is incredibly fulfilling. Everyone who was lucky enough to have known Bo Thorp believes she is looking down with a huge smile at the work being done at her little theatre and giving Mary Kate and Ella a big ol’ ‘atta girl.’”\n\nOlga “Bo” Thorp is the theatre’s founding artistic director and actress, who died at age 89 on Oct. 14, 2022.\n\n“We have some pretty great talent from near and far,” deViere says. “It’s an exciting time to be a part of the arts community in Fayetteville.”\n\nEpilogue\n\nThe face of old Haymount Hill and its landscape is about to change with the redesign of Cape Fear Regional Theatre, replete with the tall, glass windows, interior renovations of the lobby and a second-tier terrace, and not to forget additional parking across the street at the vacant Belmont House purchased by CFRT.\n\n“The theatre proper will stay exactly the same, but everything on the corner and to the Highland Avenue side is expanding, going from around 22,000 feet to 40,000 feet,” Burke says. “This means we will have two classrooms and a studio. Right now, all of our programming takes place in one studio, and interest in our education programs exceeds the capacity of our space by 25%. This expansion will allow us to continue to produce the exceptional theatre you love, with more space for education opportunities and additional cultural offerings. It’s really the whole team that’s amazing — the board, the steering committee, the staff, the audiences and the artists.”\n\nAnd, for heaven’s sake, don’t miss out on Sister Act and the musical’s cast that will have you rejoicing in your seats.\n\n***\n\nBill Kirby Jr. can be reached at billkirby49@gmail.com or 910-624-1961."
