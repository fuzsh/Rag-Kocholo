Morin passed away unexpectedly after a brief bout with pneumonia at Midcoast Hospital in Brunswick on Friday, December 29, 2023.\n\nRichard was born in Brunswick, Maine to Michel and Edith Black Morin. On the first day of high school, he met Glenna Connors who would become his wife of 59 years.

They have been to at least 40 states, including two long trips through the western states with their son, Michael. They went to Europe twice, and visited Quebec's Winter Carnival for 15 consecutive years.

KD was predeceased by her husband Reg Heron, in 2012.\n\nBorn on D-Day, June 6, 1944 in California, she was the first of five children of her late parents James R. and Alice (Carter) Vitelli of Bowdoinham. She attended schools in Easton, PA and graduated from the College of Wooster, Ohio, in 1966, having spent her junior year in the College Year in Athens program. KD went on to study archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania and to take part in excavations in Greece and Turkey. She received her PhD in 1974 and taught first at the University of Maryland, later joining the faculty of the Program in Classical Archaeology at Indiana University, becoming Chair in 1987. Under her guidance, the Program gained international recognition for its innovative approaches to teaching, fieldwork, and publication. KD’s teaching and research provided a unique perspective into the study of ancient ceramics by focusing on the production process as a way of understanding the lives and cultures of the people who made them. KD taught popular experimental pottery courses, both in the U.S. and Greece, prompting her students to ask larger questions about gender roles, the division of labor in early societies, specialization and household production.\n\nAs a professor of archaeology, KD was the author of many scholarly publications and monographs on her research in Greek Neolithic pottery. In addition, she contributed and edited columns in the Journal of Field Archaeology (1976–1983) and later edited a book, Archaeological Ethics, geared towards a broader audience to highlight the impacts that looting and irresponsible collecting practices have on the loss of cultural heritage. Most recently, she published a book entitled Do I Really Want to be an Archaeologist? Letters from the Field, 1968–1974, in which letters sent home convey not only her early ambivalence about a career in archaeology, but also shine a light on a time of social and political upheaval in Greece.\n\nVitelli retired from teaching in 2005 and moved with her husband Reg to Dresden, ME to be closer to her family. KD was an active community member, participating in and often organizing the Dresden Conservation Commission, the annual Bridge Academy Library plant sale, the Wiscasset Garden Club, and helping to maintain the gardens at the Pownalborough Courthouse and the Nickels-Sortwell house in Wiscasset. KD developed a loyal fan club as the monthly columnist of “Seen in Dresden”, reporting on local natural history sightings and events with contributions from other community members. She was an avid gardener and enjoyed the diverse bird life that frequented her neighborhood.\n\nShe was recently predeceased by a brother, Jefferson B Vitelli, of Bethlehem, PA just 3 weeks ago, who left behind his wife Carole and daughter Chandra Bleice and family in Bethlehem. KD is survived by her two sisters, Eloise Vitelli and her husband Robert Kalish of Arrowsic, with sons Samuel Reitman (Arrowsic) and William Kalish and his wife Alexa McRoberts (Colorado), and Lillie Vitelli, with husband Donald Mansius, and son Alexander Mansius, of Appleton.

We knew from your diagnosis of cancer 2 years ago that this would some how happen, but our hearts would never be ready for it. Randall Arlen Griggs, born August 28, 1954, and raised in Salem, Ohio, has lost his battle with cancer at the young age of 68, on August 22,2023. He lived with his wife of almost 50 years in the town of Topsham, ME. Their love started not far away, in the Town of Lisbon Falls.\n\nRandy and Gail began a life in Lisbon Falls, soon stationed in Presque Isle, where Randy left the Navy and started his career at the bustling shipyard of BIW as an electrician. Randy continued his career at General Dynamics, and retired at the age of 62, after working with the establishment for 34 years. He saw many a ship go in and out of port, and really enjoyed all the people he worked with along the way.\n\nAfter 2 years of marriage, they had a daughter, Erica Jean Griggs. She was welcomed by the family along with her older step brother Peter Fjeld. The now family of four continued on, living in Bowdoin for 4 years, and finally moving to their forever home in Topsham. There Erica grew up and moved to Brunswick and started a family. Erica, with her husband Leon Brillant II, had 2 handsome boys, Leon Brillant III (aka Trey) and Maxton Brillant. Randy’s 2 grandsons were the light his life, with his youngest picking up his love of fishing.\n\nIf anyone knew Randy, they knew his love of the outdoors. In his younger years, he filled his spare time with hunting; birds, deer, moose, pretty much whatever moved. But this never held a torch to his true passion of fishing. He will forever be known as the Fish Master and teaching his art and technique to his youngest grandson, otherwise known as the Fish Whisperer.\n\nRandy also loved to cut wood. Why he never had a wood splitter, was beyond me. But any chance he had he would cut wood. For a short time they had a camp built in Rangeley, where he and his wife would frequently ride around and look for moose and wood. Before each ride they would call their daughter and ask her if she needed wood. Nope, haven’t even burned the last 5 cords of wood you brought me before. One can never have enough wood when you are related to Randy. Randy loved his beautiful and peaceful camp in Rangely, but unfortunately had to be sold due to his health issues.\n\nRandy leaves behind his wife Gail, his daughter Erica and son in law Leon, and their 2 boys. Randy was predeceased by his stepson Peter.\n\nRandy also leaves behind a brother in Ohio, Thomas Griggs (aka Butch) and his wife Carol, and his brother David in Idaho. Randy also leaves behind his loving sister Karen Griggs Cawthon, and her husband Mark, residing in King George, Virginia. Randy was predeceased by his brother Loren Michael Griggs. The Griggs family shared many memories in their home in Ohio. Randy also leaves behind many nieces and nephews. Randy truly loved ALL of his family.\n\nThe Griggs/Brillant family welcomes you to a Masonic graveside service to be held on September 23, 2023, at 11:00 in the morning. Location at Hillside Cemetery in Lisbon Falls, Maine.\n\n> Add a comment >\n\nBrunswick-At 94, while suffering deeply from the loss of his beloved wife Merry, George Hermans decided to start piano lessons, an act emblematic of so much of the wonderful spirit he brought to his life: love, courage, curiosity, respect, creativity, and joy. He brought to the world uncountable small acts of kindness, a hand held, a smile given, a supportive word, a bike fixed, a repair made, an accurate suggestion, a timely and even untimely joke. He possessed the ability to make a person smile, to make one feel recognized, to appreciate the goodness in others, to listen and to learn. Then, George’s superb memory often allowed him to remember more about another person than that person knew about themselves. George could make you feel heard while he allowed you to enter his world. He passed these gifts along to his children and those who knew him and loved him.\n\nGeorge was born on June 9, 1927 in East Rochester, New York the fifth of six children of John and Jeannette Hermans. He loved his now deceased siblings Chuck, Jeanetta, Marie, Marguerite, and Gertrude. Growing up during the depression, he survived deep and stinging poverty and childhood illnesses. He recalled the early death of his youngest sister, his own severe sickness, and the loss of his family’s home and car notwithstanding his efforts delivering papers and groceries, and washing windows at the Five and Dime.\n\nAnd yet, he benefited greatly from his high school vocational education where he overcame his rejection for a position in the auto mechanic school to enroll in the carpentry and craftsmen program where he learned about the workings of radio mechanics, the machine shop, welding and carpentry. His high school yearbook from the 1944 Edison Technical and Industrial High School of Rochester, New York noted that “Herman” enjoyed his participation in the Lady of Victory Shop, the Engineering Club, the Aviation Club, the Glee Club, Dramatics, the Baseball team, and the Service Corps.\n\nAt age 17, George enlisted in the United States Navy where he was told that he was too young to die on a submarine. Instead, the Navy made him part of the force training for the imminent land invasion of Japan. When World War II ended he toiled building quonset huts in Okinawa until his discharge.\n\n> Add a comment >\n\nHallowell- Lee Drake McKenney, of Hallowell, Maine, died July 14, 2023 at Woodlands Senior Living of Hallowell surrounded by her family.

Dear friends Dianne Andrews and Helene Palmer would sneak into her backyard and play whenever they could. She was a huge Elvis and Dolly Parton fan. Some of her favorite past times were oil painting, crocheting, sewing, collecting Beanie Babies and going to Bluegrass Festivals. She has crocheted many baby beanies, blankets and booties that she delivered to Miles Hospital over the years. There wasn’t a craft she hadn’t tried and loved making homemade gifts for her family. She loved all things sparkly and shiny from jewelry to accessories. In the 70’s she was a Girl Scout Leader when her girls were of age and in the 90’s she and Dedee were co troop leaders of her granddaughter in Westport. In the 80’s she inherited the name “Gadget” from her Bluegrass friends. If anyone had forgotten or needed any item they could always go to “her” camper and she would have at least one spare-it didn’t matter what it was. Many friends were made at these festivals. One of her Bluegrass favorites were the Gibson Brothers-she was able to go to Branden VT festival with Eben last fall and, with the help of Shellie and Arden Williams, Eric Gibson came into the audience to sit and talk with them. She has raised multiple sets of cockatiels from the nest and even taught a few to talk. You could usually find her and Eben at the R/C race track or Wiscasset Speedway, where they raced in the 60s, watching their friends, grandson, and grandson in law.\n\nIn her 60’s Robbie got her motorcycle license and travelled the roads of Maine with Eben, family and friends. Lake George NY was a favorite during Americade motorcycle rally week in June.\n\nRobbie was able to stay home where she passed away peacefully in her sleep on Jan 5, 2023. A huge “Thank you” to all of Hospice, the many volunteers, family and friends that helped fulfill her wishes to keep her at home.
