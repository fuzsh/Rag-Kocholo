        "text": "“Sister Act,” a delightful and informative program on Margaret Walker and Eudora Welty, was presented by Dr. Carolyn Brown March 18 at the Welty Education and Visitors Center. Brown’s carefully researched talk, complete with illustrations, may be downloaded here.\n\nThe achievements of these two remarkable authors, who were contemporary Jacksonians, were highlighted, along with the parallels and differences in their lives, careers, and works. The discussion was followed by a reception.\n\nBrown is the author of the first published biography of Walker, Song of My Life, as well as A Daring Life: A Biography of Eudora Welty. Both books were published by University Press of Mississippi.\n\nBrown is a writer, editor, and independent scholar who has taught at Elon University, the University of North Carolina, and Millsaps College.\n\nDr. Robert Luckett, director of the Margaret Walker Center at Jackson State University, introduced Brown. The centennial of Walker’s birth is being celebrated this year in a series of programs and special events."
