        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg and Stage Entertainment produce the production, which features 24-year-old U.S. actress Patina Miller (Hair at the Delacorte) in the lead role of Deloris Van Cartier. Goldberg played that role in the original film.\n\nMiller is joined by Sheila Hancock (Olivier Award winner for Cabaret) as Mother Superior, Ian Lavender as Monsignor Howard, Chris Jarman as Shank, Ako Mitchell as Eddie, Katie Rowley Jones as Sister Mary Robert, Claire Greenway as Sister Mary Patrick, Julia Sutton as Sister Mary Lazarus, Thomas Goodridge as TJ, Nicolas Colicos as Bones and Ivan De Freitas as Dinero.\n\nThe ensemble comprises Vanessa Barmby, Amy Booth-Steel, Julian Cannonier, Ben Clare, Helen Colby, Kate Coyston, Jennie Dale, Jaymz Denning, Nia Fisher, Alison Harding, Paul Kemble, Debbie Kurup, George Long, Hugh Maynard, Jo Napthine, Aysa O’Flaherty, Landi Oshinowo, Verity Quade, Helen Walsh and Emma Woods.\n\nIn a previous statement producer Goldberg said, \"I am proud to announce that we've finally found you an amazing girl to play Deloris. It wasn't easy, but we did it. And boy, can she sing (unlike some people we know – me!). And in order to match her, we went for the best and we got the brilliant… Sheila Hancock is our Mother Superior, a legend and not just in my mind. I think together they will reinvent Sister Act and bring it to a whole new level…can you tell I'm excited?\"\n\nPeter Schneider — former President of Animation and Chairman of the Studio for the Walt Disney Company for 17 years who also spearheaded producing the stage version of The Lion King and bringing Disney's Aida to Broadway — directs. Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics by Glenn Slater and book by Cheri and Bill Steinkellner. Sister Act, according to press notes, is described as such: \"When disco diva Deloris Van Cartier witnesses a murder, she is put in protective custody in the one place the cops are sure she won't be found - a convent! Disguised as a nun she quickly finds fans amongst her fellow 'sisters' but makes the wrong impression on the convent's strict Mother Superior. When she turns her attention to the convent's off-key choir, helping the nuns to find their true voices and breathing new life into the rundown neighbourhood, her cover could be blown for good. With the gang giving chase, is time running out for Deloris? Or have they underestimated the power of her new found Sisterhood?\"\n\nThe creative team also includes musical supervisor Michael Kosarin, choreographer Anthony Van Laast, set designer Klara Zieglerova, costume designer Lez Brotherston, sound designer Mick Potter, lighting designer Natasha Katz and musical director Nick Skilbeck.\n\nSister Act — based on the 1992 movie that cast Goldberg in the role of the singer-turned-sister — has played engagements at the Pasadena Playhouse and Atlanta's Alliance Theatre.\n\nShow times are Monday-Saturday at 7:30 PM with matinees Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 PM.\n\nThe London Palladium is located in London on Argyll Street. Tickets are available by calling 0844 412 2704 or by visiting www.sisteractthemusical.com."
