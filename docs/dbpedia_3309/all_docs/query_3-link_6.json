Set up in the guise of a nun in a California convent, Deloris proceeds to upend the quiet lives of the resident sisters. In an effort to keep her out of trouble, they assign Deloris to the convent's choir, an ensemble that she soon turns into a vibrant and soulful act that gains widespread attention.\n\nSister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the sequel, Las Vegas performer Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is surprised by a visit from her nun friends, including Sister Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Lazarus (Mary Wickes). She soon finds out that she is needed in her nun guise as Sister Mary Clarence to help teach music to teens at a troubled school in hopes of keeping the facility from closing at the hands of Mr. Crisp (James Coburn), a callous administrator.\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nPossible remake (TBA)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 3, 2015, a remake was confirmed to be in the works with Legally Blonde screenwriters Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah writing.[1]\n\nSister Act 3: Kicking the Habit (TBA)\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen asked in a 2013 appearance on Watch What Happens Live about acting in a sequel, Whoopi Goldberg initially refused,[2] citing the passing of so many of her nun co-stars, stating \"it's not Sister Act without them.\"[2] But during a 2015 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, she changed her stance to a maybe,[3] stating:\n\nI generally say no to that, because so many of the nuns have passed and it just wouldn't feel right for me. I'm kind of old for it now. That's not to say I wouldn't do it, but it feels like there's a new generation for Sister Act and so maybe I can be a nun now.[3][4]\n\nAfter a Broad City cameo in 2016, Goldberg expressed doubts about a sequel based on missing cast members, but said she thought it would be fun and likable.[5] In May 2017, she affirmed her desire for the third film to happen,[6] adding in July that she would like to direct it and had confidence it would be made.[7] On December 7, 2018, it was confirmed that Regina Y. Hicks and Karin Gist were hired to write the script to Sister Act 3 with it being planned for a release on Disney+.[8] Goldberg confirmed again on October 7, 2020, during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden that she is working on the sequel and wants to bring as many of the original cast back for it as possible.[9]\n\nIn December 2020, it was revealed that Goldberg had officially signed on to return as Delores and that Tyler Perry would be producing and directing the film.[10][11][12]\n\nReworked musical\n\n[edit]\n\nA reworked version of the musical is expected to debut at the Curve, Leicester starring Brenda Edwards and produced by Whoopi Goldberg and Jamie Wilson.[13]\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nMusical\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sister Act (musical)\n\nThe musical Sister Act, directed by Peter Schneider and choreographed by Marguerite Derricks, premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California on October 24, 2006 and closed on December 23, 2006.[14] It broke records, grossing $1,085,929 to become the highest grossing show ever at that venue.[15] The production then moved to the Alliance Theater in Atlanta, Georgia, where it ran from January 17 to February 25, 2007.[16]\n\nThe musical then opened at the West End at the London Palladium on June 2, 2009, following previews from May 7. The production was directed by Peter Schneider produced by Whoopi Goldberg together with the Dutch company Stage Entertainment, and choreographed by Anthony Van Laast, with set design by Klara Zieglerova, costume design by Lez Brotherston, and lighting design by Natasha Katz.[17][18] Following a year-long search, 24-year-old actress Patina Miller was cast as Deloris, alongside Sheila Hancock as the Mother Superior, Ian Lavender as Monsignor Howard, Chris Jarman as Shank, Ako Mitchell as Eddie, Katie Rowley Jones as Sister Mary Robert, Claire Greenway as Sister Mary Patrick, and Julia Sutton as Sister Mary Lazarus.[19] The musical received four Laurence Olivier Awards nominations including Best Musical.[20] On October 30, 2010, the show played its final performance at the London Palladium and transferred to Broadway.[21]\n\nThe musical opened at the Broadway Theater on April 20, 2011, with previews beginning March 24, 2011.[22] Jerry Zaks directed the Broadway production[23] with Douglas Carter Bean rewriting the book.[24] Patina Miller, who originated the role of Deloris in the West End production, reprised her role, making her Broadway debut. She was later replaced by Raven-Symoné, also making her Broadway debut. The original Broadway cast featured Victoria Clark (Mother Superior), Fred Applegate (Monsignor), Sarah Bolt, (Sister Mary Patrick), Chester Gregory (Eddie), Kingsley Leggs (Curtis), Marla Mindelle (Sister Mary Robert), and Audrie Neenan (Sister Mary Lazarus).[25] The musical received five Tony Award nominations including Best Musical.[26]\n\nThe musical closed in August 2012 after playing 561 performances.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nS indicates an appearance as a character's singing voice.\n\nCharacters Films Musical (2006–present) Sister Act (1992) Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993)\n\nWest End (2009)\n\nBroadway (2011)\n\n1st UK Tour (2011)\n\n1st US Tour (2012)\n\n2nd US tour (2014) 2nd UK tour (2016) Manchester (2022) London (2022) 3rd UK tour (2022) Deloris Wilson/Delores Van Cartier/Sister Mary Clarence Whoopi Goldberg Isis Carmen Jones Whoopi Goldberg Patina Miller Patina MillerRaven-Symoné (replacement)[27] Cynthia Erivo Ta'Rea Campbell Kerissa Arrington Alexandra Burke Sandra Marvin Beverley Knight Sandra Marvin Reverend Mother Superior Maggie Smith Sheila Hancock Whoopi Goldberg (replacement)Sally Dexter (replacement) Victoria ClarkCarolee Carmello (replacement) Denise Black Hollis ResnikLynne Wintersteller (replacement) Maggie Clennon Reberg Karen Mann Jennifer Saunders Lesley Joseph Sister Mary Patrick Kathy Najimy Claire Greenway Sarah Bolt Laurie Scarth Florie Bagel Sarah Michelle Cuc Susannah Van Den Berg Keala Settle Catherine Millson Sister Mary Robert Wendy MakkenaAndrea Robinson Katie Rowley Jones Marla Mindelle Julie Atherton Lael Van Keuren Emily Kay Schrader Sarah Goggin Lizzie Bea Sister Mary Lazarus Mary Wickes Julia Sutton Audrie J.
