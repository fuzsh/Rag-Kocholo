        "text": "Do you remember the hit film “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit“? Get ready for another dose of nostalgia as Whoopi Goldberg reunites the original cast of the 1993 comedy film to perform the iconic “Oh Happy Day” on “The View” to celebrate its 30th anniversary.\n\nThe song, originally a 1755 hymn, holds special significance in the movie. The stirring performance of “Oh Happy Day” was what convinced the school authorities to let the choir compete in the All-State Choir Championship – a competition they ultimately won!\n\nThe movie featured singers like Erica Campbell (of the group, Mary Mary), Ryan Toby, and Tanya Trotter who were all part of the film’s choir. Sheryl Lee Ralph, who played the on-screen mother of Rita (played by Lauryn Hill), was also present at the reunion.\n\nThe performance was an emotional one, even bringing tears to Whoopi Goldberg’s eyes.\n\nWatch here:"
