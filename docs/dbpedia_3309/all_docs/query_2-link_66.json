        "text": "I’ll own it, I’m a Millennial; for better or for worse. I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg as Sister Mary Clarence in “Sister Act”. It was one of those “safe movies” that everyone’s mom could put on at a sleepover and no one would get a call the next morning saying, “What did you let my kid watch?!” I know all of the latin songs they sing in the movie by heart. I know that Sister Mary Clarence is Doloris Van Cartier, a Vegas lounge singer that gets hidden away in a convent after she witnesses her boyfriend kill someone. I know that Deloris hates the convent and the Mother Superior for a while, but then realizes she can make the choir amazing and wraps it all up in a neat bow when they all become friends at the end.\n\nI wasn’t expecting Whoopi Goldberg’s “Sister Act” when I made my way to “Sister Act: The Musical” at the Mac-Haydn Theatre, but I was expecting to have some fun. I wish I could report that this adaptation of the 1992 comedy film held up to its predecessor, but, I would be issued a few “Hail Marys” at my next confession for that sin.\n\nThe second offering in Mac-Hayden’s 2024 repertory season promises some comedic relief, sandwiched between “West Side Story” and “Rent”, but relies too heavily on upbeat choral tunes to drive the show that, when they fade, what’s left is a bland story of a woman reformed.\n\nStaying mostly true to the source material, just moving leading lady Deloris Van Cartier (Laiya Parker) to Philly. The musical starts off with Deloris and her back-up singers (Ana Viveros, Tzintli Cerda) trying out their new song, “Take Me to Heaven” in front of Curtis (Taye Martin), Deloris’ boyfriend and his gangster goons (Anthony Valez, Jake Koch, Fernando Flores), who, would be intimidating, with a comedic edge, if not for playing overused Italian stereo-types for laughs. Curtis decides the song is not enough for him to warrant Deloris singing at his club and passes. Deloris fires back with a number, showcasing how wonderful she is with “Fabulous, Baby!”. Alan Menken (Music) and Glenn Slater (Lyrics) have penned two tunes that cry-out for tenacity and fortitude and, while Parker’s voice shines at various other parts of the production, here, it lacks luster.\n\nDeloris is forced to confess to witnessing a murder, after a series of unfortunate events, and reunites with her high school friend/town nerd Eddie “Sweaty Eddie” Souther, now the town police officer, who hatches a scheme to hide her in the local convent. In this role, Josh Walker, brings heart, empathy and warmth to a character who could easily be forgettable support; truly the star of the production. They also get to have some of the most fun costume changes, too!\n\nYou can guess what happens from there, convent, nuns, choir singing, the end. Here, it isn’t the\n\ntalent that’s the problem, it’s the show.\n\nThe supporting cast out-shines, with Monica M. Wemitt’s brilliant Mother Superior, Samantha Rhea Parrish’s channeling of Kathy Najimy as Sister Mary Patrick and the wonderful character arc given to Sister Mary Robert by Cydney Gleckner.\n\nTodd Underwood’s direction makes great use of the Mac-Hayden’s thrust stage, but his choreography leaves something to be desired. The band was bright and full the night I was in attendance and I caught Matt Levinstein conducting from off-stage, always something to be applauded. Of particular note was the costumes. Daniel Hewson performs some magic on that stage that, to go off without a hitch, certainly has some divine intervention.\n\nAs I was sitting in the Mac-Haydn during intermission, I couldn’t help but notice how the arc of the ceiling reminded me of the arc of so many churches I have found myself in in my lifetime and what a beautiful sign that was to sit back and enjoy the rest of the show, like an old- fashioned barn raising.\n\nCAST: Laiya Parker as Deloris Van Cartier, Monica M. Wemitt as Mother Superior, Cydney Gleckne as Sister Mary Robert, Judith Wyatt as Sister Mary Lazarus, Samantha Parrish as Sister Mary Patrick, Belle Babcock as Sister Mary Martin-Of-Tours, Amber Mawande-Spytek as Sister Mary Theresa, Taye Martin as Curtis Jackson, Josh Walker as Eddie Souther, Brian Wagner as Monsignor O’Hara, Anthony Velez as TJ, Jake Koch as Joey, Fernando Flores as Pablo, Ana Viveros as Michelle/Nun, Tzintli Cerdaas Tina/Nun, Ariellys Reynoso as Ensemble/Nun, Cece Morin as Ensemble/Nun, Addie Trivers as Ensemble/Nun, Allie Seebode as Ensemble/Nun, Griffin Wilkins as Ernie/Ensemble, Alex Agaliotis as Altar Boy & Others,\n\nChris Agaliotis Alter Boy & Others.\n\nCREATIVE: Director: Todd Underwood, Music Director: Eric Shorey, Associate Director/Choreographer: Clint Hromsco, Set Designer: Alivia Cross, Lighting Designer: Andrew Gmoser, Costume Designer: Daniel Hewson, Sound Designer: Sean McGinley, Props Designer: Clay Cates, Wig and Makeup Designer: Emily Allen."
