Metta World Peace said on his twitter that he would join the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), playing for Yao Ming's team.

"I'm going to play for Yao Ming's team in China!" the player tweeted. "I can't wait to arrive in Shanghai!"

The Los Angeles Lakers waived Metta World Peace via the amnesty clause on Thursday night, making the 14-year veteran a free agent.
