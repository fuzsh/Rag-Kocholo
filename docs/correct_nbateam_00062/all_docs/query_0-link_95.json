        "text": "Metta Sandiford-Artest (née Metta World Peace, née Ron Artest) played nearly two decades of pro basketball, suiting up for six NBA teams as well as one in Italy and another in China late in his career. He was named the NBA’s 2003-04 Defensive Player of the Year, made that season’s All-Star Game, and later won a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010. The next year, he was awarded the league’s Citizenship Award—ultimately turning around the infamous reputation he’d earned after storming into the crowd and throwing punches at fans during the 2004 Malice at the Palace.\n\nSOTI 2021: Join Us at State Of The Industry on March 24 & 25—It's Virtual and Free\n\nSince retiring after the 2016-17 season, Metta World Peace has become a vocal advocate for mental health awareness, worked as a player development assistant with the Lakers, taken more classes to prepare for a business career and, as of last year, had changed his name yet again—he’s now Metta Sandiford-Artest.\n\nSandiford-Artest recently launched a new app, XvsX, that is essentially AirBnB for pickup hoops. XvsX can also help players learn about local tryouts and showcases. There are plans to create a pro-am league in the future, with other former NBA players such as Baron Davis, Brandon Armstrong, Chris Copeland and Larry Sanders. Users can also create profiles to share highlights, track stats and more.\n\nOn becoming a tech entrepreneur . . .\n\nWhen you're trying to build a company in innovation and technology, it's a positive thing. So, anybody that's doing technology or any business, it’s all positive.\n\nIf anybody's an entrepreneur, one would say, ‘You're doing too much.’ But as an entrepreneur, you must do too much. Literally, if you don't do it, the company's not going to just get up and start walking on its own. My mom used to say, ‘Put your clothes in the laundry. It's not going to just walk and wash itself.’ It was a lot of work, and I'm really excited. It is way more than technology, especially because I’m a founder, chairman, CEO.\n\nOn ending his hoops career overseas . . .\n\nWell, the initial passion came from when I played 18 years in the NBA. I wanted to play for 20 years. Then, my last couple of years, I was more mentoring the young players, like my guys, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, D'Angelo Russell. That was my last couple of years with the Lakers, but I really wanted to play 20 years.\n\nSo, I had to change my mindset to, ‘Listen, you’re here as a mentor.’ So, with that being said, I was hoping I could go out for 20 years, but that didn't happen. I said, ‘OK, I'm going to go back and do what I wanted to do when I was 23 years old.’ I actually put in retirement papers at 23 because I was going through a lot at that time as a professional player. Then, when I was 29, right before I was going to the Lakers, my first choices were the Houston Rockets, the Indiana Pacers, Detroit Pistons, and then it was actually Greece to go overseas.\n\nI always wanted to play overseas in my prime, and one of the reasons was because I was such a detrimental player to the team during my professional career. I'd never gotten invited to the Olympics, and you're talking about a Defensive Player of the Year, All-Star. I never got invited to the Olympics. I kind of knew why, because my attitude as a player.\n\nSo I said, you know what, I'm going to try to go to Greece now. The reason I wasn't in Greece and why I was a Laker was because the teams in Greece didn't believe I wanted to come. It was like, ‘There's no way that this guy in his prime who just averaged 22 against the Lakers in the playoffs wants to go to Greece.’ For me, it was never about the money. I knew they couldn't pay what the NBA can pay, but I just wanted to be overseas in Europe in my prime.\n\nOn the origin of the idea for XvsX . . .\n\nI initially built this app to travel to play in different countries, for myself. The reason I built that was because I was like, ‘How am I going to go to Croatia, Serbia, all these great countries with great basketball minds and [play these] great basketball players? How am I going to go and just, what, do PR?’ So I said, if I can do an app, I can actually just get people signed up to these games early, while I’m just traveling on vacation to play basketball.\n\nWell, it wasn't as easy as I thought. I'm like, ‘Oh my goodness, how am I going to pay for this stuff?’ Technology is expensive. So I said, you know what, I'll just make it a platform for everyone to accomplish that, and then start here in America and in Los Angeles, particularly in the valley of Sherman Oaks, while building this app. Then it's like, OK, how are we going to monetize? How are we going to grow? So all these questions started to be asked to me, and I'm just like, OK.\n\nMy first pitch deck is really funny. So, my first pitch deck was actually a binder with paper that I wrote on. I'd never done a pitch deck, right? So, I'm writing on this pitch deck, and this is maybe about six or seven years ago when I wanted to start. So, I literally take meetings with Sequoia [Capital]. I'm like, ‘Hey, I got a plan. I want to do this.’ I'm literally reading from a binder written with a pen. And they're like, ‘You know what, come back next time.’\n\nOver the years, I was continuing to take meetings. I humbled myself. I'm stepping into a new industry and just starting to do things differently. So, I went back back to school for digital analytics. I was actually a math major in college. I was pursuing math, but between math and basketball, it was too difficult. I knew I had some things to work with. So, it's a lot that goes into this. I was like, if I want to build this company, I literally have to figure this out because I can't keep hiring outside marketing agencies, CEOs, product managers, CTOs. You're talking about a $300,000 budget.\n\nOn resuming his coursework after retiring from basketball . . .\n\nWhen I officially retired, I was really worried. I was like, ‘What am I going to do?’ I've been playing basketball for 18 years. So, I went to apply for UCLA in digital marketing. I also applied for social media and digital analytics. That was on Mondays and Wednesdays, and then on Saturdays, I did business analytics with Professor McClatchy from Concordia in Irvine. After I did those sessions, I did a course in Google Analytics in Vancouver because as an athlete, we have so much traffic that people come [through on Google]. People are going to our websites, and I'm like, ‘How do you monetize all this stuff?’ And then not only monetize it, ‘How do you sell it?’ That's why I picked digital analytics and then also business analytics, just to kind of figure it out. It got me here. Then, I kept learning, learning, learning.\n\nOn his early love of pickup hoops . . .\n\nI remember playing basketball, just walking from Long Island City to 45th Road, which is the basketball park with the baseball field [at Murray Park]. I remember going outside, everybody's playing. I can't get on the court sometimes, so I'd walk to 45th Road or I'd even walk to Astoria. Some days, I'd just have a bag of chips and cookies and literally forget to drink water. Like, I know my mouth is white, dry. I'm just like, ‘Buddy, you need to drink water.’ I actually went to the hospital one day. I was 13 years old in Queensbridge, played from 7 a.m. in the morning to 7 p.m. I got home in chills, caught pneumonia in the summertime. My body, I was dehydrated. I was sick. I was in a hospital, I think, for a week. I just loved the game.\n\nOn targeting different levels of players . . .\n\nThe higher-end game could definitely benefit. In building the app, there were a couple of groups that I wanted to bring together that I thought was a win-win. One is the recreational player. Sometimes a recreational player wants to just play his level. They don't want to play higher. Sometimes, they want to play against high competition, but they're not trying to go to the NBA. That's an important group because the ones that are trying to go to the NBA, sometimes they can't find games because all the games are overseas, in college, or in the NBA. Now, if you don't have a job, November is basketball season. If you're working at Starbucks or Target, you still want to play basketball. So, this recreational group is really important to us. So, we actually cater to the recreational group a lot.\n\nWhen you get older, maybe 50 or 60, you're not trying to play against young guys who are just going to tear your knee up. So, you're still considered recreational because you’re not trying to hurt yourself at that age. Then, you have another group of people that's trying to make it to the NBA. The people that are just trying to make it need competition. They need knowledge. They need to be playing with guys like myself, who they can ask questions. And not only people like myself who played in the NBA—anybody with experience. So, we often mix this new group of players who are trying to gain experience and get better with guys like myself.\n\nThe other really interesting group are the influencers that can play. You have two types of influences. One is the influencer, a recreational player who wants to play pro, but really can't. Then, the other one is really solid. J. Cole is a really good player. The Game was a really good player. I actually played one time with Leonardo DiCaprio—he’s a different level. I did play one time at his house, I think. These are different levels of players, but when you got a guy like Trinidad James, who can actually come off a screen and roll and make a drop pass … he's the type of player that I look for to play in our games. So, he's happy because he's playing against good competition, good cardio. In basketball, you lose a ton of weight. I'm happy because I'm overweight. So, I'm losing weight. Then, the other players that are trying to make it are happy because they get a chance to play with us, [put it on] Instagram, and now they get more exposure. Everybody's happy. That's kind of our elite games.\n\nOn breaking Michael Jordan’s ribs . . .\n\nThat was actually Michael Jordan's pickup game. It was called “Hoops in Chicago.” Obviously, we idolize Michael Jordan. I'm an extremely aggressive player. Some people will say in the NBA, ‘Man, you're playing too rough.’ But, literally, I was playing like that since I was 10. I know no other way.\n\nSo, Michael Jordan was actually posting me up—and I love Michael Jordan—and I was trying to deny him because this is after [his first] retirement. He was coming back and he was looking extremely well. He was playing so well. So, in order to stop Michael Jordan, you cannot let him touch the ball. So, I was denying him. He was holding, and then his referee called the offensive foul like this. As I was denying him, my elbow hit him in the ribs. So, I accidentally broke his ribs.\n\nTo his credit, he came back the next play down the court. It was tied 6-6. I remember it because I'm a fan. Mike might not remember it because he’s a superstar. He came in and hit the game winner and went off the court like this [holding his side]. I was like, ‘Man, Michael Jordan’s really good.’ The next day, in the media, it said, Ron Artest body slammed Michael Jordan and beat up Michael Jordan. The guy who wrote it was Sam Smith.\n\nI literally didn't leave my house for two days—my apartment in Chicago. The Chicago Bulls were calling me, and I'm like, ‘Oh my goodness. I hurt Michael Jordan.’ Then, Michael Jordan calls me. My agent Mark Bartelstein called me first at the time. I said, ‘I broke Michael Jordan’s ribs, and I don't know what to do.’ So he called me, and said Michael was going to call me. Michael called me and said, ‘Hey, don't worry about it. Things happen, and I really enjoyed playing against you.’ That's what Michael Jordan said. Then I went back to playing basketball.\n\nOn his sons playing college basketball . . .\n\nIt's great. I've got one son at CSUN [Cal State University-Northridge]. My other son is at UC-Irvine. They're in the same conference. Go watch their games. Please go watch my sons play because they don’t get a lot of views. So my one son is Ron Artest III at CSUN, a 21-year-old.\n\nMy son Jeron, my 19-year-old, he’s at Irvine. He's a computer science developer. He actually develops video games. So he’s on a basketball scholarship, a straight-A student, video game developer, specializes in sound design, and also has a fund called the Sunday Fund, which had a 10x return. Literally, the kid's a genius, graduated at about 15 and a half and was done with high school. He's a really good shooter.\n\nI’m sorry, LaMelo Ball, you’re my boy, but my son was playing for Bella Vista, a prep school—and I think DeAndre Ayton went there, actually—so he was playing for that school. He wasn't starting, but in the last game against LaMelo Ball, they started my son Jeron Artest to guard LaMelo Ball. He had 21 points, and they won the championship, LaMelo’s last high school game. It was really exciting because LaMelo is going to be a superstar. My son got defensive player of the tournament.\n\nOn defending the NBA’s best . . .\n\nYou got to bring your A game out. I tell people all the time that when I played against Kobe or LeBron, and they would score 25, 30 or whatever—literally, that was my best. If I didn't bring my best, LeBron would get 50. LeBron never scored 50 on me. Nobody ever scored 50 on me in the NBA, which is great. If I didn't bring my A game, LeBron has 55 points.\n\nOn the future of XvsX . . .\n\nI often don't like to talk about the future because investors always tell you to focus, but then they ask about your future plan. Do you want me to focus, or do you want my future plan? We want to go to other sports eventually. We want to test it with basketball, and if it goes well, we would love to get into other sports and get our players playing other sports. So, that is the future plan. We have a lot of other great plans if things go well. With our roadmap, we really think we have a shot to do something really special."
