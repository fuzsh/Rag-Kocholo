        "text": "PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. -- Late in the first quarter of a high school girls basketball game, the 6-7 man dressed in black appears in an entryway, quietly makes his way across the gym and takes a seat on the the home team's bench.\n\nIt is Metta World Peace, and no one is making a fuss.\n\nHis 15-year career in the NBA included not only a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers and accolades as one of the league's top defenders, but also flagrant fouls, ill-timed shots and disruptive behavior that frustrated coaches. Now he is one — a member of the coaching staff at Palisades Charter High School who's been working with the team since June.\n\n\"Only way he'd do it is if I gave him the title of coach,\" Torino Johnson, the team's head coach, says with a grin.\n\nFrom all appearances, World Peace has earned the title.\n\nHe worked with the team during the preseason, kept up with the coaches by email during a three-month playing stint in China and rejoined the coaching staff following his recent return to Southern California.\n\nRunning late because he was with his son — a member of the high school's team that was playing across town — World Peace shows up sporting a T-shirt with the outline of a Panda, a name he adopted for himself while playing in China. But the player who helped spark a infamous brawl during an NBA game in 2004, later changed his name from Ron Arest to Metta World Peace and once showed up to meet with the Los Angeles Lakers staff wearing a blue Cookie Monster T-shirt, did nothing else to call attention to himself during the game.\n\nHe confers with the coaches only when they turn to him for advice, twice calls over players after getting permission from Johnson and offers instruction in a voice that could barely be heard a row behind the team bench.\n\n\"Don't worry if you make a turnover,\" World Peace tells a player who'd hesitated on the court. \"Don't think about it. Once your mind tells you to do it, do it.\"\n\nHe has imparted his defensive skills and inspired the team, according to the Johnson, the 32-year-old head coach, who says World Peace deserves some credit for the team's winnning streak that reached 15 games last week. He is also responsible for the team's uniforms, having designed them himself.\n\n\"I was terrified it was going to be some design out of his hair when he was with the (Houston) Rockets,\" Johnson says. \"I didn't know what to expect.''\n\nInstead, the white uniforms with the blue trim feature a tasteful dolphin, the team's mascot, on the back of the jerseys. In an exclusive interview with USA TODAY Sports, World Peace talked about a host of topics last week, including uniform design.\n\n\"If it was up to me, I'd have everybody's jersey different,\" he says. \"Each player would have their separate one. I think the game should be a joy, I think the game should be colorful.\n\n\"I wanted to design them a little bit different. I wanted to be a little more risky. Hopefully next year I can.\"\n\nTHINKING AHEAD\n\nWorld Peace last appeared in the NBA a year ago when he played in 29 games for the New York Knicks, averaging 4.8 points per game in 13.4 minutes. At 35, he says he hopes to catch on with an NBA and plans to play again next year in China, where he appeared in only 15 games due to a knee injury.\n\nBut his long-term goal is to become a coach. In addition to serving as an assistant on the girls team, World Peace says he is informally helping with the boys team at Palisades Charter High, coaching four men's adult teams and, in the summer, managing three youth teams, including a squad of 17-year-olds.\n\n\"I believe in order to coach, you've got to start at the ground level,\" World Peace says. \"The same way I learned how to play basketball.\n\n\"I've learned a lot from (Johnson, Palsides' girls coach) in how to deal with players and different personalities. He's very good. It's been perfect.\"\n\nTurns out World Peace's reserved personality on the team bench is not simply deference.\n\n\"At times you don't want to say too much, because as a player I don't want too many coaches talking to me,\" he says. \"So I just kind of sit back and give some pointers. I try to help them individually and give them confidence to do more on the court. I don't want them to play like a robot.\"\n\nPERSONAL GROWTH\n\nAlmost three months removed from the 10th anniversary of the so-called Malice at the Palace — a wild brawl during a game between the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers where World Peace went into the stands — he says he is a different person. That his personal evolution continued after he changed his name from Ron Artest to Metta World Peace in 2011.\n\n\"It's weird, the evolution of a person,\" he says. \"You understand yourself, you understand your surroundings. Then when you understand who came before you, once you understand that about yourself and the energy that you came to this planet with, you understand more about yourself.\n\n\"I continue to learn about myself, about my past, understanding energy between people, understanding my own energy, being healthy. I feel so much more connected to my environment, the Earth. I feel so much more connected than I was ever.\"\n\nWorld Peace says he still sees psychologists and embraces Buddhist ideas he learned from former Lakers coach Phil Jackson.\n\n\"I was amazed at how he could be so driven but so calm,\" World Peace says. \"Because back in the day, when I'm driven, my energy's at a high level and I could never bring it down. Positive energy or negative energy, I couldn't bring it down. …\n\n\"I've learned a lot and I feel like I've got a lot to offer. I would like to get a psychologists' type certificate so I can mentor more and get even more involved.\"\n\nLAKERS DRAMA\n\nYes, World Peace says, he heard about Magic Johnson teeing off on Jim Buss, the Lakers' executive vice president of basketball operations who Johnson criticized for the Lakers' slide. Grinning, World Peace says that was between Johnson and Buss.\n\n\"The Lakers are getting better,\" World Peace says. \"I tell people all the time, 'People expect their teams to win, but what they don't understand is the league is tough. It's tougher than it's ever been. The players are so good.\n\n\"The Lakers are going to be fine. It's just not the Lakers' year this year. But they've got the fortitude to get back to the top. They're going to do it.\"\n\nWorld Peace says he'd love to rejoin the Lakers — or join any NBA team, for that matter.\n\n\"There's been stories out there I'm not in shape,\" he says. \"That's getting old. I tell my agent, if teams don't really understand the shape that I'm in and the drive that I to win another title, don't force it, don't worry about it.\n\n\"People think I'm coaching all these different teams and I'm not playing. I'm practicing a lot and I'm in great shape. If I had a playing job in the NBA, I would still be on the staff.\"\n\nBy which he was referring to his current gig — the one-time tormenter of coaches now among them."
