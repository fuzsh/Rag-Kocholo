        "text": "Even with Kobe Bryant ending a storied 20-year NBA career, the Lakers have kept another player connected to their successful past.\n\nVeteran forward Metta World Peace will join the Lakers for training camp. The Lakers would not confirm the agreement, but a league source familiar with the situation said World Peace will return on a one-year, non-guaranteed deal. The Lakers, however, announced that they signed free-agent forward Thomas Robinson to what is believed to be a one-year deal.\n\nAfter serving as mostly a mentor toward the Lakers’ young roster and playing occasional minutes, the 36-year-old World Peace will be expected to fill the same role.\n\nThe Lakers currently have 19 players signed on their roster. But they will soon reach the NBA-maximum 20 players for training camp with the expected signing of World Peace. The Lakers must trim their roster to at most 15 players before the regular season starts in late October.\n\nAfter the Sacramento Kings drafted him fifth overall in the 2012 NBA Draft, Robinson has played four NBA seasons with the Kings (2012-13), Houston Rockets (2012-13), Portland Trail Blazers (2013-15), Philadelphia 76ers (2015) and Brooklyn Nets (2015-16). The 25-year-old Robinson has averaged 4.9 points and 4.8 rebounds in 13.8 minutes per game.\n\nRobinson will face stiff competition amid a Lakers frontline that also includes Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr, Luol Deng and Tarik Black.\n\nAs for World Peace, he attempted striking a balance last season between supporting then-Lakers coach Byron Scott and providing positive reinforcement for the team’s young players, most notably Randle. World Peace also never lamented his declining role — he averaged 5.0 points on 31.1 percent shooting and 2.5 rebounds in 16.9 minutes through 35 games.\n\nWhether World Peace stays on the roster through the entire 2016-17 season remains another question. The Lakers could put more value this year on investing in a younger roster than retaining a veteran player not expected to provide significant minutes. Still, World Peace could become an extra conduit for new Lakers coach Luke Walton, who were former teammates from 2009 through 2012 and won an NBA title together in 2010."
