        "text": "The Building Industry Association of Southern California (BIASC) announced that former NBA champion Metta World Peace will serve as keynote speaker for the upcoming Building Industry Show, a highly anticipated two-day event featuring the largest building industry trade show in Southern California while celebrating the centennial anniversary of the BIASC and the 85th anniversary of the BIA of San Diego (BIA-SD).\n\n“We are honored to welcome such a renowned and deeply respected celebrity to our event,” said Craig Foster, Chief Operating Officer/Executive Vice President for BIAS. “World Peace is not only a basketball legend, but he is also an entrepreneur, actor, author, philanthropist, and mental health leader––he exemplifies what being a true champion is all about. The opportunity to experience his speech and the takeaways that follow it will be one of the most inspiring highlights of the evening.”\n\nMetta World Peace, who was born Ronald William Artest, Jr., earned a world champion ring with the LA Lakers during his 18 seasons in the NBA. During his career, he was also signed by the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, Sichuan Blue Whales, Pallacanestro Cantù, New Orleans Gators and San Diego Kings. Today, World Peace advocates for mental health awareness in underserved communities. He is Chief Impact Director of OOTify, a mental health platform, and is founder and chairman of Artest Management Group. He is also author of “No Malice: My Life in Basketball or: How a Kid from Queensbridge Survived the Streets, the Brawls, and Himself to Become an NBA Champion.”\n\nThe Building Industry Show will kick off with an anniversary celebration aboard the USS Midway on October 25, while the trade show will take place on October 26 at the Marriott Marquis San Diego in San Diego, California. The show expects upwards of 2,000 attendees, including 65 builders and their operations and purchasing staff. The Show will also feature the largest “Meet the Builder” experience in Southern California, including ample one-on-one opportunities for both members and builders. In addition to the “Meet the Builder” experience, the Show will also feature an impressive agenda of events, including roundtable discussions with other guest speakers and elected officials on important topics ranging from housing to expediting entitlements.\n\nRegistrations are currently underway for show floor exhibitor booths, sponsorships, general attendees, and the USS Midway Celebration for the 2023 Building Industry Show.
