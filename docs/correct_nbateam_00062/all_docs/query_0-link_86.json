        "text": "Ron Artest (Metta World Peace) was so underrated on the Indiana Pacers.\n\nIn fact, he was so underrated that many people probably would not realize he won Defensive Player of The Year in 2004 and was an NBA All-Star.\n\nHis 2004 season was incredible with him averaging 18.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.1 steals per game.\n\nHe was also doing it for a Pacers team that finished the season 61-21 and went all the way to Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals (which they lost to the Detroit Pistons).\n\nUnfortunately, the season after, \"Malice At The Palace\" happened, and Artest was suspended for the entire season after starting the year so hot (see Tweet below from StatMuse).\n\nArtest did continue to have a solid career after that point with the Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks, but never was an All-Star again.\n\nIn total, Artest played part of five seasons with the Pacers from part of the 2001-02 season through part of the 2005-06 season.\n\nArtest's 2004 season gets forgotten about too much.\n\nRelated stories on NBA basketball"
