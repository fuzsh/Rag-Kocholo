        "text": "The HooperVision alternate broadcast is back tonight at 8 ET, only on the NBA App, as Kevin Durant returns to break down Warriors-Thunder and chop it up with NBA veterans Quentin Richardson, Dorell Wright and Metta World Peace.\n\nDurant’s an old friend of the show, having dropped in during each of the last two seasons. Tune in to hear high-level analysis and some great behind-the-scenes stories about life in the Association!\n\nRichardson, a 13-year-veteran, played on some of the most memorable teams in recent NBA history, including the Seven Seconds Or Less Phoenix Suns. He won the 2005 Three-Point Shootout, leading the league in 3s made over the course of the season.\n\nWright, an 11-year-veteran, won a championship in 2006 with the Miami Heat. He offered reliable shooting for a number of teams, knocking down 37% of his 3-pointers over 549 games with the Heat, Warriors, Blazers and 76ers.\n\nWorld Peace, an 18-year NBA veteran, was one of the greatest defenders of his generation, earning the 2004 Defensive Player Of The Year award. He won a ring with the Lakers in 2010 and averaged 13.2 ppg over 991 career games, spending time with the Bulls, Pacers, Kings, Rockets, Lakers and Knicks.\n\nThey’ll be checking out a choice matchup between two talented Western Conference teams as the inaugural In-Season Tournament begins!\n\nThe Thunder boast an array of young talent, including silky-smooth scorer Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and interior presence Chet Holmgren. The Warriors’ championship core is ready to make another run – Klay Thompson’s already started their campaign off with a bang.\n\nWatch the stream in the “Games” section of the NBA App, beginning at 8 PM ET!"
