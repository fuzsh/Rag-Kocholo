        "text": "I have been thinking a lot about Metta World Peace lately (you may know him better by his previous name, Ron Artest, but I guess I just believe that a man deserves to be called what he wants, however ridiculous.) Some of this has been prompted by the pervasive nature of this video clip, in which World Peace, coming off of an emphatic slam drunk against Western Conference rivals the Oklahoma City Thunder (formerly the Seattle Supersonics, for those wondering where my loyalties lie), in a moment of adrenaline fueled jubilation, brutally elbows the Thunder’s James Harden in the head, sending him crashing to the floor. World Peace, of course, denied any intentionality in this action, claimed it was unfortunate, a heat of the moment sort of reaction that often explains away many of the brutally physical acts that some claim exist only as outliers of athletic expression. But World Peace has a history of such acts, or at least a brutish, violent streak. Maniacal, effective, Artest (before the name change, and the team change, and the number change) was as known for his antics and outbursts as we was for his defensive prowess and his lauding of psychotherapy as essential to the mental stability of the modern celebrity athlete.\n\nThe issue is that I like Metta World Peace, or Ron Artest, or Ron Ron, or the CEO of Tru Warier Records (he is all of those things). Sports represent a wonderful departure from the mundane realities of real life. Sports exude drama, artistry, and chance, things that are rarely present in the monotony of telephone hold music, the sorting of laundry, or the nerve-wracking decision of which type of pasta sauce to buy; these being the sort of things that have come to define adulthood for so many of us. And within the arena of sports, there exists an even smaller arena for those who are truly, legitimately, and wonderfully crazy. I find it somewhat comforting that if sports are supposed to represent a mirror to the world in which we live, that even those who are a little off (Delonte West, Dennis Rodman, et. al) can succeed, sports representing a gorgeous sense of capitalism in which skill, rather than appearance and reputation, matter most of all. You can be as crazy as you want, so long as you can do something no one else can. In this way, sports are the antidote to politics, a place where substance truly is substantive, rather than simply shiny.\n\nIt is because of this that I’ve wanted to revisit World Peace’s previously infamous violent outburst, the brawl at the Palace at Auburn Hills. While the actual event that would come to define his career as a player in the National Basketball Association lasted only a few minutes, the effects of Ron Artest’s (what he was named at the time) involvement in the infamous brawl at The Palace at Auburn Hills, involving both players and spectators, has followed him for the rest of his career, and has been highlighted even more recently with his attempt to leave James Harden concussed post-dunk. Scuffles and fights, while not encouraged and not entirely common in the NBA or other professional sports, are a reality of the competitive and charged environment in which professional athletes practice their occupation. However, what occurred on the night of November 19th, 2004, was something entirely different, and ultimately changed not only the course of Artest’s career, but of the other players involved. Additionally, this particular incident deeply affected both the NBA and general attitudes towards fan safety both in the U.S. and internationally. It’s worth an effort to mine the context of Metta World Peace’s life and playing career in an effort to try to understand his involvement in the Auburn Hills brawl. Additionally, World Peace’s recent violent episode serves as good a purpose as any to revisit the effect that the brawl had on Artest/World Peace, the NBA, and general attitudes towards fan security in professional sports. More than anything though, it is my hope to stimulate the discourse surrounding one of the most divisive professional athletes in recent memory, whose defensive prowess is lauded almost as much as his emotional instability is feared (and his rap music generally ignored).\n\nDespite quickly becoming one of the most gruesome brawls in NBA history, the brawl at Auburn Hills started out as most fights in sports do, as a dispute between two players. Ben Wallace, the center for the Detroit Pistons, pushed Artest violently following the end of a play in which Artest fouled Wallace from behind. This sent Artest flying towards the scorer’s table, and caused his teammates to rush to separate Wallace from Artest (Wallace being no small human being himself, like most professional basketball players). In a rare act of restraint (at least for a player like Artest, who often found himself near the top of the list of technical fouls received on a perennial basis), instead of retaliating against Wallace, Artest removed himself from the growing commotion and instead reclined on the surface of the scorer’s table. At this point, the fighting had grown from just being between Wallace and Artest, with fellow Pacer Stephen Jackson joining in alongside a growing number of other Pacer and Piston players. Artest seemed to be content with removing himself from the fracas, an extremely uncharacteristic move given Artest’s penchant for in-game physicality and a well-documented reputation for generally being unable to control his emotions on the court. However, after laying on the scorer’s table for roughly a minute, a fan hurled a plastic cup towards Artest, hitting him squarely in the abdomen as he laid supine. While the scuffle continued to take place around him, Artest jumped up from the scorer’s table and entered the crowd where he proceeded to throw punches at the fan whom he believed threw the beer at him. At this point, all hell broke loose, for lack of a better term, and the available video of the event makes it difficult to fully discern what happened. However, what is clear is this: upon seeing Artest enter the crowd, several Pacer players followed him, presumably in an attempt to restrain him. Due to the fact that they were already embroiled in a brawl on the floor, the Pistons players followed the Pacers players into the crowd, effectively combining the larger on-court brawl with the smaller one that Artest had started in the crowd. Fans spilled onto the court, presumably to try to escape from the fight in the stands, and when all was said and done, the remaining seconds of the game were forfeited, with officials citing safety concerns as fans threw cups, debris, and even metal folding chairs at the Pacers players as they exited the Auburn Hills arena under a crescendo of boos and jeers.\n\nWhile arguably the most horrifying brawl in NBA history for both its size, duration, and involvement of spectators, the 2004 Auburn Hills brawl was not the first time that fighting had seized the collective attention of those around the NBA. In 1977, Kermit Washington, a player for the Los Angeles Lakers, threw a punch at Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston Rockets during a brawl that occurred during a regular season game. Commonly referred to as simply “the punch,” Washington’s punch broke many of the bones in Tomjanovich’s face and jaw, leaving him with life-threatening head injuries and sidelining him for five months. Ultimately, Tomjanovich was never able to return to his pre-punch form and was forced to retire. Washington was suspended for sixty days and fined $10,000, a remarkable sum for 1977. The NBA responded by implementing mandatory suspensions for players who threw punches while on the court, regardless of whether or not those punches actually landed. When asked about the rationale, NBA Commissioner David Stern, who served as legal counsel for the league at the time of the Washington/Tomjanovich fight, stated “One thing was obvious, you couldn’t allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other.” As a result, fighting became much less common in the NBA, as players feared the financial consequences of losing valuable game checks (financial responsibility not generally being a value championed by the players union at that time).\n\nAt the time of the Washington/Tomjanovich punch, one of the most shocking aspects of the melee were the people involved; by all accounts, these were two of the NBA’s more well-behaved and well-respected players. The same cannot be said about Ron Artest. Long considered a volatile player, Artest led the league in flagrant fouls with ten in 2003. In that season alone, Artest, according to Jon Wertheim (writing forSports Illustrated) “committed an assortment of crimes and misdemeanors ranging from smashing the Mavericks’ Raja Bell to smashing a $100,000 television camera, which have added up to $45,000 in NBA fines.” Indeed, many have argued that Artest’s actions are “embarrassing for the team and the league and probably hurt his chances to be an All-Star.” However, behind the initial impressions that his outbursts often leave is a man seemingly beloved both by teammates and fans. Anecdotes such as Artest applying for a job at Circuit City during the NBA regular season (he claimed he spent so much money there that he needed the employee discount), openly admitting that he consumed alcohol during halftimes of NBA games, and openly thanking his therapist on live television (as well as forcing Craig “and the Technicolor Sportcoat” Sager to say “Queensbridge”) after winning the 2010 NBA Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers have both endeared him to fans while providing his critics with more than enough ammunition against him. For a generation that follows their favorite athletes on Twitter and expects access to them on and off the court, Artest’s admitted fallibility has been, paradoxically, his most marketable and damaging trait.\n\nDespite Artest’s penchant for erratic and at times violent behavior, the Auburn Hills Brawl used up whatever small amount of goodwill the league had for Artest. NBA Commissioner David Stern suspended Artest indefinitely the next day, and ultimately decided to suspend him for the remainder of the season, amounting to an unprecedented seventy-three games and roughly five million dollars in lost income. While Artest wasn’t the only player involved in the brawl, the next longest suspension, Stephen Jackson’s, was only for thirty games, less than half the length of Artest’s suspension. David Stern and the NBA were attempting to send a two-fold message: one, that player/fan altercations would not be tolerated under any circumstances, and two, that the combined effects of Artest’s transgressions and his reputation were ultimately coming back to haunt him.\n\nThe Auburn Hills brawl also ignited a larger debate about fan safety and the responsibility of sports leagues to protect the spectators that pay to consume their product. Often overlooked by fans, the ticket license printed on the back of an admission ticket waives certain fan rights in order to decrease liability on the part of ownership. In the aftermath of the Auburn Hills Brawl, however, the largest question that loomed was that of responsibility. With two fans being forced to go to the hospital due to the events of the brawl, some pointed fingers at the players, while others felt that the NBA and the team organizations should be responsible. A 2009 article entitled “Spectator Safety and the Liability of Governing Bodies” profiles a court case that determined that it is the responsibility of the league to take steps to provide adequate player safety. While this ruling came after the Auburn Hills brawl, it illustrates the difficult position that leagues find themselves in providing safeguards against uncontrolled variables (like Ron Artest entering the crowd to throw punches at a fan who may or may not have been over served ) when there is a definite need for clearly defined rules and regulations regarding spectator safety. While sports like baseball and hockey can analyze the statistical probability of a spectator being injured by an errant puck or foul ball, incidents such as the Auburn Hills brawl are decidedly more difficult to predict. The NBA did take steps to increase both player and fan security, however; after the brawl, Commissioner David Stern mandated that three security guards stand between the team benches and the fans, and instituted limits on the size and number of alcoholic drinks that fans could purchase during NBA games (much to the chagrin of fans of $12 Miller Lites nationwide).\n\nArtest returned to the Pacers the following year, only to demand a trade early in the season. Artest was placed on the injured reserved list until January, when he was traded to the Sacramento Kings. Artest made an immediate impact with the Kings, helping them go on a 14-5 run and secure a playoff spot. In 2008, Artest was traded to the Rockets, where his services were similarly needed, helping the Rockets advance past the first round of the NBA playoffs for the first time in eleven seasons. However, despite Artest’s clear value to his teams, his physical style of play did not diminish. Artest was still commonly called for flagrant fouls and ejected from games, however one is left to wonder whether some of Artest’s flagrant fouls and ejections were due more to the fact that he was seen as problem player by the league and its officials as opposed to actually being warranted.\n\nIn 2009, Artest signed a five-year, thirty-three million dollar contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. Having proven himself with both the Kings and the Rockets, as well as having maintained good behavior for the most part, the Lakers felt confident that with the established leadership of Kobe Bryant and coach Phil Jackson that Artest could fill a desperately needed role of being a defensive enforcer without succumbing to his penchant for impropriety that had colored much of his earlier career. They were right. While Artest lost none of his personality in his trade to the Lakers (he reportedly chose thirty-seven as his jersey number in honor of Michael Jackson’s Thriller spending thirty-seven weeks atop the Billboard Charts), Jackson (Phil, not Michael) (who had previously dealt with infamous NBA troublemaker Dennis Rodman during his tenure in Chicago) was able to control Artest, eventually culminating in the Lakers winning the 2010 NBA Finals (largely due in part to Artest’s extremely improbable three-point shot that has forced me to question my own lack of religious beliefs from time to time, ironically).\n\nWhile Artest’s talent on the basketball court has rarely, if ever, been challenged, he has often been criticized for allowing his transgressions and non-basketball related offenses overshadow his on-court abilities. While Artest’s actions during the night of the Auburn Hills brawl are certainly inexcusable, one must admit that he paid for them, and did so dearly. Post Auburn-Hills Artest seemed to be, for lack of a less effusive term, a changed man. While he’s lost none of the spark, desire, and tenacity that have made him such a valuable player on the court throughout his career, the menacing, violent individual that many people purported him to be is largely absent. Or at least it was. For a while, Artest had, above all else, proven that second chances, while difficult to come by, are certainly worth giving.\n\nThen he elbowed James Harden in the head, and we all remembered, at least for a moment, why said second chances are so difficult to come by. Should Artest return from his seven game suspension and the Lakers make a run deep into the playoffs, however, I’m certain that all will be forgotten (save for the dull, throbbing pain that probably still emanates from James Harden’s temple). After all, this is America, where victory is the most effective form of cleansing one’s public reputation. The stain has certainly gotten deeper, but that’s not to say he couldn’t get it out, some day. And frankly, it might be sooner than we think."
