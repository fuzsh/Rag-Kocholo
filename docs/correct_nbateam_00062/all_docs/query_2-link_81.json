        "text": "Only Metta World Peace.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers forward has done it again, crossing the line and drawing a technical foul for a smack across the face of Houston Rockets point guard Jeremy Lin. The hit, with his forearm, brings to mind his egregious elbow last season to the face of James Harden, then with the Oklahoma City Thunder and now Lin's teammate.\n\nWorld Peace, formerly Ron Artest, received a seven-game suspension for that foul.\n\nIf it were any other player, the foul would be chalked up as inadvertent. But a Ron Artest foul by any other name is still a Ron Artest foul. World Peace has a reputation that he constantly lives up to.\n\nLin seems stunned and had a small cut near his eye that needed treatment. World Peace does make a move to grab and stabilize Lin, but that came after the blow.\n\nWhat would you do? Was the the technical foul enough? Is a suspension in order? Was this all a big accident? Tell us in the comments."
