        "text": "EL SEGUNDO – The two players stood at opposite ends of the Lakers’ practice court. Their presence partly explained how they survived various roster cuts.\n\nAfter practice ended, Thomas Robinson worked on free throws and post-up moves. His hustle and efficiency left Lakers coach Luke Walton “shocked” the former No. 5 draft pick lasted briefly in Sacramento (2012-13), Houston (2012-13), Portland (2013-15), Philadelphia (2014-15) and Brooklyn (2015-16).\n\n“You assume once you get to a more structured setting, you’d see some reasons why he hasn’t stuck. Bur he was great,” Walton said. “He earned his spot by bringing it every day, competing and playing with a ton of energy.”\n\nAfter practice, Metta World Peace worked on shooting and running drills. The 16-year NBA veteran, who turns 37 next month, was scoreless in a combined 11 minutes during preseason play this month. But World Peace secured a spot on the Lakers for the second consecutive season on a non-guaranteed deal because of his mentorship with a young group.\n\n“He’s somebody I trust and somebody I can talk to,” said Walton, who played with World Peace on the Lakers from 2009 to 2012. “He gives us an edge and a toughness.”\n\nThose qualities gave Robinson and World Peace an edge over Chinese center Yi Jianlian and second-year forward Anthony Brown, both of whom were waived Monday. The Lakers enter their regular-season opener against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday at Staples Center with the league-maximum 15 players, seven of whom are 25 or younger.\n\nYi, 28, averaged only 3.6 points on 36.8 percent shooting in 12.2 minutes as a backup center. That marked a far cry from his career average of 7.9 points on 40.4 percent shooting during previous stops in Milwaukee (2007-08), New Jersey (2008-10), Washington (2010-11) and Dallas (2011-12).\n\nWalton conceded Yi would “have to outplay everybody to get big minutes because of the players we need to develop.” Before it reached that point, though, Yi asked the Lakers on Sunday to release him. Yi had a veteran’s minimum deal that could have reached $8 million in incentives. It is unclear if he will play again with the Guangdong Southern Tigers in his native China or join another NBA team.\n\n“Yi was productive in practices and games with us, and was a consummate professional both on and off the court,” Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said in a statement. “However, he felt that the minutes and opportunities he’d be afforded here were not in line with his goals and ambitions, and that he’d be better off in a different situation. We appreciate his efforts and wish him great success as he goes forward with his career.”\n\nBrown played 20.7 minutes per game as a rookie last season, but he faced limited playing time this season behind veteran Luol Deng and rookie Brandon Ingram, and the unexpected emergence of Nick Young after two inconsistent seasons did not help his situation. Brown (Ocean View High) averaged only 3.16 points on 46.6 percent shooting in 8.3 minutes during preseason play, and the Lakers had concerns about his shooting consistency after selecting him 34th overall in the 2015 NBA draft out of Stanford. Brown was in the last year of a guaranteed contract worth $2 million.\n\n“It was tough to find him opportunities,” Walton said of Brown. “But as much as I like him and how he was playing, Metta World Peace and (Robinson) were bringing it every single day.”\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Robinson, 25, did that by averaging 2.8 points and 3 rebounds in only 7.6 minutes per game while shooting 55.6 percent from the field. Despite receiving positive feedback in recent days, Robinson said he did not sleep much Sunday night. He found out he made the team once he arrived at the Lakers’ facility on Monday.\n\n“I made the team, but nothing is done yet,” said Robinson, who has a non-guaranteed deal. “I shouldn’t have been in that position. But things happen the way they happen. I worked my way out of it. Now I have to keep going.”\n\nWorld Peace also wants to keep going for at least three more seasons, either in the NBA or overseas.\n\n“At the end of my career, I feel (like I’m) at the beginning,” said World Peace, who has played 16 seasons in the NBA and one overseas. “In order to reach those goals, I have to take care of my body.”"
