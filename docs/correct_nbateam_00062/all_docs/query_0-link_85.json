        "text": "Houston trailed by as many as 14 in the first half, but used a pair of runs in the third quarter to go on top and build a big lead.\n\nWorld Peace had a season-high 24 points for the Lakers, who were playing without their top three big men: Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol and Jordan Hill – who are all out with injuries.\n\nBryant added 20 points for the Lakers and Nash had 16 points and 10 assists to become only the fifth player to surpass 10,000 career assists, joining John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Mark Jackson and Magic Johnson.\n\nThe Lakers, who lost their fourth straight to fall to 15-19, are in 11th place in the Western Conference.\n\n“I thought we had the better team,” World Peace said. “We definitely had the better team, but every night we have the better team and it’s just not translating to wins.”\n\nThe Rockets have rallied from double-digit deficits for their last three wins. As usual, they did it on Tuesday night behind the strong play of Harden, who has scored at least 25 points in 13 straight games.\n\n“They were short-handed, but they are still tough,” Harden said of the Lakers. “We knew we couldn’t take them lightly. They did a great job in the first half of really getting easy shots on us. In the second half we started to pick it up defensively. We got out in transition and made some easy shots.”\n\nHoward has a torn labrum in his right shoulder, Gasol has a concussion and Hill a right hip injury. All three are out indefinitely. Rookie centre Robert Sacre made his first career start due to the injuries, and finished with 10 points, four blocked shots and three rebounds.\n\nJeremy Lin chipped in 19 points with six rebounds and five assists for Houston, and Carlos Delfino also scored 19.\n\nThe Rockets led by nine midway through the fourth quarter and used a 5-0 run highlighted by a three-point play by Lin to make it 112-98. Lin drove to the basket and made the layup as he fell to the court after being fouled by Sacre.\n\nLos Angeles led 62-59 at halftime.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Timberwolves coped with the absence of head coach Rick Adelman and All Star forward Kevin Love to beat Atlanta 108-103, ending a near seven-year winless run against the Hawks.\n\nAdelman missed the game for personal reasons, while Love is out indefinitely after reinjuring his right hand last week, but the home team still had enough to beat the Hawks for the first time since April 2006.\n\nNikola Pekovic scored 25 points and had 18 rebounds, Andrei Kirilenko added 21 for Minnesota (16-15), who had lost 11 straight to the Hawks before Tuesday’s game.\n\n“We were really motivated,” Pekovic said. “I think everyone wants to step up and show more.”\n\nMinnesota led 100-89 with four minutes remaining but Atlanta managed to cut the deficit to one in the final minute. Minnesota’s Dante Cunningham made a crucial jump shot with 15 seconds left and the Timberwolves added free throws to put the game away.\n\nMinnesota’s Ricky Rubio returned from a four-game absence with back spasms and had eight assists in just 19 minutes of action.\n\nJosh Smith and Louis Williams each scored 21 for the Hawks (20-13), who have lost three straight.\n\n“If this doesn’t change there’s going to have to be some changes, that’s plain and simple,” said Hawks’ coach Larry Drew."
