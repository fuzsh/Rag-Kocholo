        "text": "METTA WORLD PEACE BIOGRAPHY\n\nMetta World Peace, an NBA Champion and All-Star is best known for scoring the winning shot in the 2010 NBA Championship Game with the Los Angeles Lakers. As one of the NBA’s premier defenders, he won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2004. His career is also marked by controversy, particularly for receiving the longest suspension in NBA history due to his involvement in the Malice at the Palace brawl during a game between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons. Despite these challenges, Metta has become a leading advocate for mental health awareness, sharing his personal struggles with depression and anxiety and inspiring many with his recovery journey.\n\nGrowing up in a neighborhood plagued by drugs and violence, Metta World Peace found solace in basketball, using the sport as a means to escape his environment. In 1997, he began his college basketball career at St. John’s University, quickly making a name for himself in notable New York City tournaments such as the Nike Pro City, Dyckman Basketball Tournament, and Hoops in the Sun. In 1999, he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, where he played 175 games over two and a half years. His defensive prowess later took him to several esteemed teams, including the Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, Sacramento Kings, Los Angeles Lakers, and Indiana Pacers, as well as international teams like the Sichuan Blue Whales and Pallacanestro Cantù.\n\nMetta World Peace gained widespread admiration when he publicly thanked his therapist after his game-winning shot in the 2010 NBA Finals, a moment that played a significant role in destigmatizing mental health issues. Demonstrating his commitment to giving back, he raffled off his championship ring to benefit mental health charities and advocated for the Mental Health in Schools Act before Congress. In recognition of his efforts, he was honored with the NBA’s Citizenship Award and the Mental Health Hero Award.\n\nIn addition to his advocacy, Metta World Peace has made regular media appearances, starring in the Emmy-nominated Showtime Sports documentary, “Quiet Storm: The Ron Artest Story,” which featured NBA luminaries like Lamar Odom and Kobe Bryant. He is also the bestselling author of “No Malice: My Life in Basketball,” where he recounts his life and career. Transitioning into entrepreneurship, Metta founded the Artest Management Group and is currently in the process of raising $1 billion to support his portfolio companies.\n\nMetta’s journey from the projects in Queensbridge, New York, to NBA stardom is a testament to his resilience and determination. Through his speaking engagements, he shares his fascinating story and candidly discusses his public journey with mental health, inspiring audiences with his message of hope and redemption."
