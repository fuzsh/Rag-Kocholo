        "text": "Best known for the highs (making the shot that won the 2010 NBA Championship for the Lakers) and lows (the infamous “Malice in the Palace” brawl) of his career and his openness in discussing his struggle with depression and anxiety; Metta World Peace was awarded the “Mental Health Hero” award for his advocacy and activism. An authentic and inspirational speaker, he shares his journey from the projects in Queensbridge, NY to NBA superstardom.\n\nLong before Michael Phelps, Simone Biles and others brought the mental health struggles of professional athletes out of the shadows, basketball superstar Ron Artest (nka Metta World Peace) publicly thanked his therapist after making the shot that won the 2010 NBA Championship for the Los Angeles Lakers. To this day, fans continue to comment on the impact this public acknowledgement had on them. In turning to therapy, not only did he overcome a long family and personal history of anxiety and depression, he was a key player in breaking down the stigma commonly associated with mental health issues.\n\nInfamously associated with the “Malice in the Palace” incident between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons, Metta went on to find redemption and commit himself to helping others, earning the NBA’s citizenship award.\n\nNow an entrepreneur, mental health advocate and inspirational speaker, he shares his very public journey with mental health, as profiled in the award-winning and Emmy-nominated Showtime Sports documentary, Quiet Storm: The Ron Artest Story, featuring teammates Kobe Bryant, Lamar Odom and other NBA legends."
