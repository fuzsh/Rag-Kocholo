        "text": "LOS ANGELES – In between sobs, hugs and screaming expletives, Metta World Peace struggled to find some serenity.\n\nHow could he when Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others died in a helicopter crash on Sunday morning? How could he when Bryant’s wife Vanessa and three other daughters, 17-year-old Natalia, 3-year-old Bianka and newborn Capri, had suffered such unspeakable loss?\n\n“There is no way you can wrap your head around it,” World Peace told USA TODAY Sports. “It’s (expletive) unreal.”\n\nWorld Peace discovered some moments of brevity, though.\n\nHe has spent the past two days reflecting on Bryant’s 20th and final season with the Los Angeles Lakers, nearly four years ago. Bryant spent that season fielding tributes from teammates, opponents and other public figures. Before then, World Peace rarely had any private moments with Bryant despite playing together previously for five seasons (2009-2013). Artest re-joined the Lakers in 2015.\n\n“We got some dinner,” World Peace said. “We had never had dinner together. But we were getting old. It’s such a great feeling. We had some drinks. We took some shots that night. I was like, ‘Wow, it was great to see Kobe vulnerable.' \"\n\nBryant became vulnerable during his farewell tour for two reasons. He became humbled with the gifts and tributes to commemorate his 20-year NBA career with the Lakers that spanned five championships and saw him become the franchise’s all-time leading scorer (33,643 points). Bryant also eventually accepted he had no chance to win another NBA championship after nursing three season-ending injuries in consecutive years. Before that, though, World Peace only saw Bryant take shots with a basketball.\n\n“We would chat sometimes. But for the most part, on the bus, Kobe was just focusing on trying to win championships, studying games or getting some rest,” World Peace said.\n\n“During that whole time, we weren’t getting no lunch or dinner. When Kobe’s coming to practice, he’s thinking, ‘I’m coming to practice and I’m not [messing around]. When I’m coming to that game, I’m coming to go hard.’ Kobe didn’t give a [bleep] about all the other [stuff].”\n\nBryant made exceptions occasionally. In 2012, World Peace once invited Bryant to a recording studio. Apparently, Bryant had advanced as a hip-hop artist after once recording a panned song with Tyra Banks called \"K.O.B.E.\" that was released just before the 2000 NBA All-Star game.\n\n“He wouldn’t leave. He kept rapping and was trying to get me to rap,” World Peace said. “I said ‘I rap, but you’re a writer. You’re way better than me.’ Finally, we were just talking. It was amazing.”\n\nThe two often sparred when the player, formerly known as Ron Artest, was with the Chicago Bulls (1999-2002), Indiana Pacers (2002-2006), Sacramento Kings (2006-08) and Houston Rockets (2008-09). When the Lakers played the Rockets in the 2009 Western Conference semifinals, Bryant and World Peace exchanged elbows throughout the series. During one exchange, World Peace confronted Bryant and made a slashing gesture at his own throat after Bryant delivered an inadvertent elbow.\n\n“He called me the greatest defender ever to play the game,” World Peace said of Bryant. “That said it all right there -- respect. I remember him never backing down. I was able to wear people out, mentally and physically. I remember not being able to get under Kobe.”\n\nWorld Peace soon did not need to worry about that. In his first season with the Lakers, World Peace and Bryant beat the Boston Celtics in seven games of the 2010 NBA Finals. In the decisive Game 7, Bryant passed the ball to Artest for a clutch 3-pointer. Afterward, Artest thanked Bryant in a memorable post-game press conference.\n\n“That moment hasn’t crossed my mind until you just said it,” World Peace said. “The only thing that crossed my mind with Kobe is Vanessa and the kids. The championship hasn’t really crossed my mind. The things that crossed my mind is the time we spent and had times to talk to each other.”\n\nSo World Peace has been grieving in other ways. He has fielded calls from Lakers fans and mourned with them. He has spent time with Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss, their executive director of special projects (Linda Rambis) and the team’s senior basketball advisor (Kurt Rambis). And he has grieved with family members.\n\nAmong those who share his grief are his father, Ron Artest Sr. He first crossed paths with Bryant during the 2009 NBA playoffs. Then, Bryant would not even acknowledge him because World Peace played for the Rockets. A year later, Artest Sr. saw a different side of Bryant. Bryant gave Artest Sr. warm hugs any time he saw him after games. When Artest Sr. waited Bryant out during his final game in Washington D.C. in 2016, the Lakers’ star complimented World Peace’s father that he had not aged.\n\n“Now I understand the Kobe mentality,” Artest Sr said. “If you’re not a Laker, you’re his enemy. If you are, you’re his family.”\n\nAll of which left the Artest family feeling like they lost one of their own siblings.\n\n“He’s my favorite player right now. I’ll miss him,” Artest Sr. said of Bryant. “ ... I still can’t believe Kobe died in a helicopter crash. I expected him to live until 80 or 90 years old and then he would pass away at old age. But not now.”\n\nWorld Peace also has struggled with that issue. So in between the occasional laughs when sharing stories, World Peace spoke the thoughts of many on whether he can ever find closure.\n\n“There’s no way to cope with this,” World Peace said. “There’s not one thing, except your family.”"
