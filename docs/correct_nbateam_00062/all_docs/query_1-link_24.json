        "text": "Back in July, when Metta World Peace signed with New York Knicks after the Los Angeles Lakers used the amnesty provision to cut him, the veteran small forward said, \"I don't care if I'm starting or sweeping the floors, you hear me? I want to win.\"\n\nThese days, World Peace isn't starting — he's barely playing — and the Knicks aren't winning.\n\nHe hasn't played in three games this season, he played more than 25 minutes just once since Nov. 11 and has scored in double figures just twice since Nov. 11. And World Peace is taking it all in stride, saying over and over he is ready to play when called upon.\n\n\"I'm ready for whatever's presented,\" he said. \"I had a pretty good preseason, and I was playing really consistent. I felt I was doing enough to prove that I was ready. Not to prove, because I don't have anything to prove anymore. This team is stacked. I knew that. I knew I was going to play behind (Carmelo Anthony). I didn't expect to play as much as four. I thought they'd be playing 'Melo a little bit more. I knew coming into the season that it wasn't going to be the same but I was ready.\"\n\nHe held court in the middle of the visitor's locker room at the Boston Celtics' TD Garden. He said over and over he was ready when the Knicks needed him.\n\n\"I remember going to (the) Houston (Rockets in a 2008 trade). I knew it wasn't going to be the same. But then Tracy (McGrady) goes down, then I have to average 20. It was like that simple. Gotta stay ready,\" World Peace said.\n\nIs he patient, considering he's barely played in the last five weeks?\n\n\"Patience is a weapon, man. Patience is weapon,\" World Peace said. \"I learned that from my Laker days. I work hard. I'm ready. I stay patient because I know that (through) patience and persistence good things happen to me on the side. I'm in no rush to get to feel a certain way. I'm in no rush to react. I just like to stay ready for whatever presents itself.\"\n\nWorld Peace said he wasn't chasing a ring when he decided to join the Knicks. But would he be willing to play on a rebuilding team.\n\nHe gave a classic answer.\n\n\"Listen, whatever team I'm on is never rebuilding,\" he said. \"When you get Metta World, you're officially championship mentality. So like here, officially championship. I remember talking about division (championship). I hear that a lot. But that's not what Metta World brings. Metta World brings championship mentality. That's it. One thing. That's what I do.\"\n\nEarlier in the season, he scored 18 and 17 points in consecutive games. He thinks he still has something left.\n\n\"You know you're getting respect when you're still getting double-teamed a little bit. That's how you can tell. The main thing for me is to stay in shape, stay ready,\" World Peace said.\n\nHe's not complaining.\n\n\"When you're taking the challenge, some things are out of your control,\" he said. \"That's not something you worry about. You can't worry about if you're going to work and your boss moves your desk. It is what it is. He wants you to work on this side. It's a similar situation. My desk has been moved from playing to on the bench. It's OK.\"\n\nHe's not worried about being traded either.\n\n\"There's nothing to deal with,\" he said. \"What am I dealing with? Getting paid, is all I'm dealing with here. I know some guys take trade rumors a little more personal. What am I dealing with? I work hard. I can still play and I love challenges.\n\n\"All the teams that called me last year, I wanted something that was going to be an adventure. Something different. China, Knicks and arena football. That was it. What else is an adventure? You know what I'm saying? This is the adventure I'm talking about. Sometimes it's good to be ready for the unpredictable. I'm glad that I can go through unpredictable situations. It's a good thing.\"\n\nThat is World Peace."
