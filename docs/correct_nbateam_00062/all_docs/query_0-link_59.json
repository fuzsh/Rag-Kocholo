Haffey/Getty Images\n\nVeteran forward Metta World Peace is waiting for a free-agent market to develop for his services, but he's still planning to play during the 2016-17 season.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nWorld Peace Waiting for NBA Interest\n\nThursday, Aug. 4\n\nIan Begley of ESPN.com spoke with the Queens native in New York City this week, and he confirmed his intention to keep playing. He also noted he's serving as a life coach for a couple of unnamed NBA players while he's waiting for an opportunity to arise.\n\n\"But it's not a thing where I'm going to hide and be that perfect mentor,\" he said. \"I just give them the best advice I can and live my life accordingly. I'm doing that now, and one day I would love to coach.\"\n\nAs for his playing future, the small forward previously known as Ron Artest believes he can still make a significant impact if he has a meaningful role. The 36-year-old former All-Star felt he could have \"averaged 15 or 20\" for the Los Angeles Lakers last season.\n\n\"I'm waiting for teams. I can still play. I can play, it's not even a question, man,\" World Peace told ESPN.com. \"But, you know, sometimes you don't get in the game, man. What are you going to do? I'm not going to be upset, I'm going to support.\"\n\nHe posted just 5.0 points and 2.5 rebounds while shooting 31.1 percent from the field in 35 games for the Lakers last season. It marked his first NBA action since the 2013-14 campaign, with time playing in China and Italy sandwiched in between.\n\nWorld Peace's last big year came with the Houston Rockets in 2008-09. He averaged 17.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists while connecting on 39.9 percent of his three-point shots. Those days are a thing of the past, however, even if he remains confident in his own ability.\n\nHe still possesses value as a bench asset and a veteran leader, a role he's starting to embrace at this stage of his career. He's gone through a lot over the past few decades, including the infamous Malice at the Palace, so he can provide young players with valuable advice.\n\nThat said, it's hard to imagine him receiving more than 20 minutes per game, assuming he does find another NBA opportunity for next season. And that playing time will be even less should he land with a contender."
