        "text": "Lakers forward Metta World Peace spent Friday in Washington D.C. talking with members of Congress about the Mental Health in Schools Act, which would provide funding for more therapy services in schools. The former Ron Artest also did the same thing two years ago. “We need to build confidence in kids and have a stronger support system for them,” World Peace said. “It’ll make them stronger with education.”\n\nNBA commissioner David Stern said Thursday that despite suggestions to the contrary, Royce White’s recent dispute with the Rockets does not represent the first time the league has been involved with mental health issues. “Of course it’s not. We’ve been dealing with this situation for years,” Stern said during a meeting with local media on the opening day of the NBA Jam Session at the George R. Brown Convention Center. “Does anybody remember (Metta World Peace, the former Ron Artest) thanking his therapist at the Finals when the (2010 Lakers) won the championship? Dealing with mental health issues or problems as part of our player programs’ agenda goes back, well, two decades.”\n\nLet’s finish off with you. What does the future hold for Metta World Peace in terms of basketball? Metta World Peace: I want to be a Los Angeles Laker for life. I want the purple and gold forever. I won a Championship there. We haven’t been in the best situation the last couple seasons, but I want to be part of the solution. I want to help them fight out of this foxhole, and get back to what we do, take back what is ours. I want to stay right here. I take this losing personally.\n\nLakers coach Mike D’Antoni believes the punishments stem more from World Peace’s reputation. World Peace has a well-documented behavior history, most notably drawing an 86-game suspension after he – then known as Ron Artest – rushed into the stands after a fan threw a drink at him in an infamous brawl eight years ago in Auburn Hills, Mich. World Peace also drew a seven-game suspension last season after throwing an elbow at former Oklahoma City guard James Harden. “I’m sure that goes into it,” D’Antoni said. “They look at the play and look who did it with past experiences.”\n\nNext stop is Detroit on the Lakers’ seven-game trip, and Metta World Peace was trying to meet up with guy who threw cup at him back when he was Ron Artest and the “Malice in the Palace” was a national controversy in 2004, John Green. “He’s cool,” World Peace said Friday night. “He’s good people.” It turns out their schedules aren’t working out, but World Peace said they’ve met once previously and get along well. “I’ve spoken to him quite a few times,” World Peace said.\n\n“I came to L.A. for this,” World Peace told ESPNLA 710 Radio’s “Max & Marcellus Show” on Thursday. “I could have went to Memphis or New Orleans where the media market is low and you’re not going to get as crucified. “I came here for this. You don’t come to L.A. not to want to be crucified when you lose. You come to L.A. for that pressure and that’s why we’re here. You got to really enjoy it. This is a beautiful time, like I kept telling my teammates. We can’t be in a better situation. We can write world history. This is world history that we can write and we have the chance to do it.”"
