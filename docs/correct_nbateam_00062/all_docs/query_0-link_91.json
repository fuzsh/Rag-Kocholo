I know i have a current bulls series, for the people following i will be posting on that soon, i was just rushing into it and got burned out with playing with that team.\n\n2. there might be some historical incorrect things, but for most things i will try to give a reasonable explanation because as you might expect, putting a historical team into the regular nba, might cause confusion.\n\n3. i hope you enjoy, and like i said if there are any confusions or you got any tips for me, just let me know! i am very open to criticism as long as it isnt just pure hatred. Thanks\n\nThe 07' - 08' Houston Rockets\n\nA team that couldve been amazing, if it wasnt for injuries. Lead by 7'6'' Giant Yao Ming from China, and Incredible Shooting Guard Tracy McGrady, the rockets were set up to succeed.\n\nHistorical Changes\n\nNow obviously by putting in an entire different rockets team into the NBA, one might ask, Where did all the current rockets players go? heres an explanation.\n\nJames Harden You probably guessed it, he stayed with the Thunder, didnt break out quite when he did though, he will keep his remaining 2K stats, as this year is the breakout season for him, signing a 3 year deal worth $85,26Million with the thunder. He takes place for Kyle Singler, who gets deleted from NBA History.\n\nLou Williams Stayed in LA, cuz kobe asked him to ISO way too much in honor of himself. RIP metta world peace, as he takes an early retirement (except hes 37 so is it really early?)\n\nClint Capela Got drafted by the Phoenix Suns, as the rockets drafted Alec Brown, who never made it to the NBA anyway, and so gets deleted in NBA history. He takes the place of Ronnie Price, who decided to retire early (Yea i forced him)\n\nPatrick Beverley Stays in the team, same history as in real life\n\nEric Gordon Resigned with Pelicans, as Boogie was an off-season signing for them, sees real potential in NO now. takes place of Axel Toupane.\n\nNene Takes place off Jason Smith in washington, unfortunately he had to retire because i said so.\n\nTrevor Ariza Also decides to sign with the Pels back again, believing in the whole Cousins-Davis combo. takes place of Quinn Cook.\n\nRyan Anderson, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell all stay on the team, same storyline as usual.\n\nBobby brown, Isaiah Taylor, Troy Williams Will be deleted\n\nChinanu Onuaku i like this kids freethrow, so hes dropped into free agency\n\nAnderson, Dekker, Harrell, Beverley take spots off John Davis (Created by 2k) John Jones (Created by 2k) Steve Novak (Still on current NBA as FA) Aaron Brooks (Still on current NBA as Pacer) Current Luis Scola will be made a 55 Overall with a changed name (So he wont be picked up) and Carl Landry will be replaced by 23 year old Leandro Barbosa from the 04'-05' phoenix suns, as the team desperately needs a backup SG. backstory for him later.\n\nALL THE CURRENT ROSTER BACKSTORIES AND REALLIFE STORYLINES WILL BE EXPLAINED IN NEXT POST.\n\nIm excited.\n\nall Jokes aside though, ill try to remain as realistic as possible.\n\nJaiveer likes this.\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2014\n\nRe: What should have been - The 07' - 08' Houston Rockets\n\nHow every player got into this team!\n\nKeep in mind im not going into specifics for every single player, i just want to get the big picture out there\n\nThe Team\n\nto be clear, we have sucked, no playoffs since Hakeem and Yao as their only hope for a better future, it looked grim.\n\nPoint Guards\n\nPatrick Beverly(28yrs, 78ovr) Still Got Drafted R:2 P:12 (2009)\n\nBobby Jackson (36yrs, 75ovr) Undrafted, got taken from overseas 10 years ago by the kings, signed with houston this year on a 2 year minimum deal.\n\nSteve Francis (31yrs, 73ovr) Always been a rockets legend, \"The Franchise\" got drafted R:1 P:3 in the 2006 NBA Draft\n\nShooting Guards\n\nTracy McGrady (30yrs, 90ovr) Always been playing for the raptors with his Nephew DeMar DeRozan, Tracy decided it was time to team up with Yao Ming to lead his own team. Joining the Rockets last year, unfortunately we couldnt see if it would work, as they both struggled with major injuries.\n\nLeandro Barbosa (23yrs, 71ovr) (yes, his current NBA version doesnt exist anymore) got drafted R:1 P:26 in the 2015 NBA Draft\n\nSmall Forwards\n\nShane Battier (30yrs, 79ovr) Drafted by Grizzlies, Signed by Rockets two years ago. two years left on 16 million dollar deal\n\nSam Dekker (23yrs, 73ovr) Same history as current NBA, drafted by rockets R:1 P:18 in 2015 NBA Draft\n\nPower Forwards\n\nRyan Anderson (29yrs, 77ovr) Same History as Current NBA\n\nMontrezl Harrell (23yrs, 75ovr) Same history as Current NBA\n\nLuis Scola (29yrs, 75ovr) Picked up by houston this year (Undrafted) Rockets paid buyout to Saski Baskonia and signed him to three years $9.15M deal.\n\nChuck Hayes (26yrs, 70ovr) Undrafted in '13, been a defensive benchwarmer for rockets ever since.\n\nCenters\n\nYao Ming (28yrs, 88ovr) Multiple All-Stars on his name, Yao has never seen a second of a playoffs matchup, being the lone wolf after being drafted R:1 P:1 by the rockets in 2010 (Wall, Turner, Favors, Johnson, Cousins all move down one spot). Yao definitely wants more, and it seems now he got it with Tracy, and also the only reason he resigned to a 24M a year contract over 4 years.\n\n[i]Dikembe Mutombo (43yrs, 74ovr)/I] Played his last 4 years on the rockets, not his former self ofcourse, being 43 years old, still a valid defensive option off the bench.\n\nIs there anything wrong that i missed? tell me!\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2014\n\nRe: What should have been - The 07' - 08' Houston Rockets\n\nROCKETS TRADE FOR CP3, FORMING BIG 3 WITH YAO, TRACY AND PAUL\n\nPaul (30) who has been reportedly frustrated with the situation in LA, told the clippers if they wanted value out of him they better trade him now, as he wasnt going to resign.\n\nClippers acquire Beverley, Anderson and Harrell, as they wanted to \"Re-Tool\" instead of rebuild. They also receive some picks. Full Trade down below\n\nClippers trade: Chris Paul, Diamond Stone, Alan Anderson\n\nRockets trade: Patrick Beverley, Ryan Anderson, Montrezl Harrell, '18 1st Round (Top 10 Protected), '18 2nd Round\n\nWhy this is good/bad for the Rockets\n\nObviously they are the winners in this trade, they get their third star whos hungry for his first title, Paul fits perfectly into the rockets system though, they run a ton of screens and paul is a perfect pick and roll point guard to pair up with yao. He also gives tracy some room as they cant double team him as easily anymore plus he can let tracy play offball more, which is great too. You are also getting a great playmaker and defender. In the trade they also got Diamond stone, whos a rookie this year and can definitely grow into something. Alan Anderson is a 34 year old veteran that can shoot some three's for you, but was just really there to make sure the clips wouldnt have too many players. Its bad because you gave up depth, Ryan Anderson was there stretch 4 and Scola (Who will now probably be starting at 4) wont be that, also you lose a great Rebounder and big talent in Harrell, and to top it off, a great defender in beverley, but Houston did clearly win this trade, as paul wanted to leave, his value dropped.\n\nWhy this is good/bad for the Clippers\n\nThe obvious losers in this trade, or are they? lets look at it this way, Paul wanted to leave, and you only had until the trade deadline to get something for him unless you were going to let him walk away for free. Now you get Anderson, whos a great floor spacer (Something desperately needed in LA), Beverley who is basicly the perfect 3 and D guy, fitting into basicly every system. Harrell who looks very very promising into the future, and Two Picks , even though the 1st Round 2018 pick is top 10 Protected, this rockets team isnt looking to lose, so you still have some good value in those picks. Also now finally blake gets to Control the offense, something hes wanted for a long time."
