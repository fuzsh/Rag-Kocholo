        "text": "IT'S a refreshing sight to see NBA players express their activism inside the NBA bubble.\n\nPlayers not only wore \"Black Lives Matter\" warmers and kneeled during the national anthem, but also had statements placed on the backs of their jerseys. (Well, most of them, anyway.)\n\nThe league and the NBA Players Union agreed on a list of social justice messages these players can choose to put on their backs and a lot chose that right.\n\nThe most popular of the terms used was \"Equality\" â€” with Serbian guard Luka Doncic (\"Enakopravnost\") and Latvian big man Kristaps Porzingis (\"Vienlidziba\") of the Dallas Mavericks choosing to use the message in their native tongue.\n\nBut almost a full decade since these social justice messages were allowed in the players' uniforms, one player proved to be ahead of his time.\n\nIn 2011, Ron Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.\n\n\"Changing my name was meant to inspire and bring youth together all around the world,\" he said in a statement then as he aimed to shed his troublesome past.\n\nArtest chose Metta as his first name as it was the traditional Buddhist word that meant \"loving kindness and friendliness towards all.\"\n\nWorld Peace played in the NBA until his retirement in 2017, spending time between the Los Angeles Lakers and the New York Knicks as well as brief runs in China and Italy.\n\nThat capped off a 18-year career that saw him play for the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, as well as the Lakers and the Knicks.\n\nHe hung his sneakers as a one-time NBA champion with the Lakers in 2010 and the 2004 Defensive Player of the Year with the Pacers.\n\nThis May, World Peace said that he had changed his name once again, this time to Metta Sandiford-Artest.\n\nThree decades back, Lloyd Free, who played in the NBA from 1975 to 1988, also legally changed his name to World B. Free.\n\nWorld was the nickname he was given when he was in junior high school.\n\n\"They just started calling me 'all-world', because all-city and all-county and things like that weren't good enough,\" he said in an old USA Today interview back in 1981.\n\nFree had stints in Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers, Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Rockets.\n\nIn his time with Golden State, he was named as All-Star back in 1980.\n\nSpin fans unite at the Spin Viber Community!
