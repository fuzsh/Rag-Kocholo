        "text": "Metta World Peace has agreed to return to the Los Angeles Lakers on a one-year deal, he told ESPN.\n\n\"I'm excited about everything. I'm prepared to help the young guys grow. To play, everything,\" he said.\n\nAfter playing in China in 2014, World Peace returned to the NBA last season, appearing in 35 games and averaging 5.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in limited action. Much like last season, the Lakers added the popular veteran to their training camp roster to provide leadership with their young players, whom he'd been working out with at their facility over the summer.\n\nWorld Peace, 36, is also a former teammate of new Lakers coach Luke Walton.\n\n\"Luke's always been like a coach, even when he was playing,\" World Peace said.\n\nThe Lakers already have 14 guaranteed contracts, not including the partially guaranteed contract they have out to Yi Jianlian, the 7-foot star of the China's national team. World Peace said his deal was \"the same as last year,\" when he played his way onto the roster with an non-guaranteed contract.\n\nThe agreement was first reported by TheLead Sports."
