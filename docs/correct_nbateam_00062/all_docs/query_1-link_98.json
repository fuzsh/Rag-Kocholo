        "text": "Former Indiana Pacers forward Metta World Peace joined ESPN's Zach Lowe on \"The Lowe Post\" podcast Friday.\n\nThe show discussed World Peace's new app, XvsX Sports, described as an AirBNB for pickup basketball games. The app goes live at the end of March.\n\nLowe also spent plenty of time going down memory lane with the former NBA star.\n\nWorld Peace, better known to many Pacers' fans as Ron Artest, started by discussing his time with the Los Angeles Lakers and winning a NBA championship with Kobe Bryant.\n\nInsider: These Pacers starting to peak at right time\n\nReport: Pacers, Lance Stephenson discuss reunion\n\nMalcolm Brogdon: Indiana Pacers will soldier on without PG again\n\nLowe wondered how World Peace coped with Bryant's death.\n\nHe recalled being on a plane to Europe with his wife on Feb. 26. The in-flight movie ended with someone's death. Suddenly, he was overcome with tears.\n\n\"I couldn't control my crying because I've been suppressing it,\" World Peace said. \"It comes in waves. On the plane, I'm like, 'What am I crying for?' It's something you don't cope with. I'm not trying to make it better. I don't want it to get better. Time heals all wounds.\"\n\nLowe wondered if that Lakers squad was the best team with which World Peace had ever played.\n\nWorld Peace felt his Indiana Pacers team was pretty good and the Houston Rockets team with Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady was decent, as well.\n\n\"But Kobe would argue that it was no way those teams were better,\" World Peace said.\n\nThe conversation turned toward the \"Malice in the Palace\" and World Peace leaving the Pacers. Lowe noted how the situation left World Peace feeling like a coward.\n\n\"Ego is one thing and then saying I don't want to play with you guys, that's a coward,\" World Peace said.\n\nHe referenced requesting a trade from the Pacers and not taking the situation head on. World Peace discussed becoming more direct over the years, but he couldn't come at the Pacers directly at the time.\n\n\"I feel like those guys supported me and had my back. I don't feel like I was as supportive as I should have been,\" World Peace said.\n\nSo why did World Peace request the trade?\n\nSimply put, he didn't have a choice. Returning to Indiana and playing in a Pacers jersey after the brawl was more than he could mentally handle.\n\n\"I didn't know how to approach that. I needed something different because it was way too much pressure,\" World Peace said.\n\nLowe asked if there was moment World Peace could freeze and do anything different?\n\n\"Not really,\" World Peace said. \"You can't really control your destiny.\"\n\nHe said you can't predict the future, and you can't really prepare for someone to throw beer on you.\n\nHaving moved on, World Peace is even friends with the man who threw beer on him that night, John Green. He referred to Green as a \"cool guy\" and said they talked a few times.\n\n\"To him and me, it was like a fight. He threw something at me, we fight and it was over,\" World Peace said. \"To the public, it was a black eye on the sport, which I get. To me, it was just an incident I had with one person.\"\n\nWorld Peace mentioned an interview with former Pacers teammate Jermaine O'Neal for a Netflix documentary on the incident.\n\nHe had never really watched the brawl until O'Neal showed him the footage.\n\n\"I didn't know somebody threw a chair at my teammate. It was so many angles,\" World Peace said. \"I was like, 'Wow, this is what happened.' He catches me on tape with my first time reactions.\"\n\nVisit espn.com to listen to Lowe and World Peace talk more about his time with the Lakers, the Tim Floyd-era Bulls, rapping with a 78-year-old woman and more."
