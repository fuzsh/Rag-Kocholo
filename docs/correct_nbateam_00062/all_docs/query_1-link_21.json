        "text": "Metta World Peace, the ex-NBA star formerly known as Ron Artest, will join the Sichuan Blue Whale Basketball Club of China Basketball Association (CBA), it was announced on Monday.\n\nThe 34-year-old former NBA All-Star forward, who once played with Yao Ming on the Houston Rockets, has become the latest high-profile former NBA player to bring his high tops to China, following Stephon Marbury, Tracy McGrady and others.\n\n\"I'm excited to announce I am officially a member of the Sichuan Blue Whale Basketball Club! Big season ahead for us!\" World Peace posted on his Twitter account.\n\nWorld Peace is known in China as \"Ci Shiping\", which is a literal translation of \"Metta World Peace\". A source close to the CBA said his one-year contract will make him one of the highest- paid CBA players in history.\n\nThe highest-paid to date is Kenyon Martin who earned more than $2.7 million per year with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers.\n\nWorld Peace played a key role in winning the NBA Championship for Los Angeles Lakers in 2010. In his last full NBA season, he averaged 12.5 points and 5 rebounds per game for the Lakers in 2012-2013.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with the New York Knicks in 2013, but was waived by the team after they bought out his contract in February."
