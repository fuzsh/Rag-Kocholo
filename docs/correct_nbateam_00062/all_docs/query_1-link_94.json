        "text": "Metta World Peace Makes Bold Prediction For Lakers, Rockets' 'New Guy'\n\nBy Brian Josephs, Complex Sports\n\nSome of the casualties of Dwight Howard's move to Houston include: a few burnt Lakers jerseys, a Shaquille O'Neal diss, and a Twitter unfollow from Kobe Bryant. It's madness, and situations like these call for a voice of reason. A voice like Metta World Peace, who took to Twitter make some predictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep. Howard is simply \"the new guy\" because Omer Asik is going to be that big of a deal. It should be noted that Asik isn't willing to play with Howard.\n\nThe Rockets to the conference finals? That's not too farfetched of a prediction, but James Harden as next year's MVP? That's hard to believe. What if the stars align and Linsanity starts to spark for the whole season? What if Brandon Knight goes on an insane revenge trip on all who wronged him? That LeBron James dude is pretty good too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Lakers fans are so salty about Howard that you'd think otherwise.\n\nFor Howard's sake, let's hope not.\n\nIt's also worth noting that World Peace said Howard was staying in LA because he had his balls. He clearly was a bit off with that prediction.\n\nRELATED: Rockets Get Dwight Howard; Fans Get Delirious With Glee\n\nRELATED: Gallery: The Many Crazy Sides of Metta World Peace\n\n[via Metta World Peace]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
