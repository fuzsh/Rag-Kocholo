        "text": "Former NBA player Metta World Peace’s campaign for the Knicks head coaching job didn’t last very long.\n\nWorld Peace, formerly known as Ron Artest, said in a since-deleted tweet Friday, “if the @nyknicks is available, I definitely want to be head coach there,” following the firing of David Fizdale.\n\nAt the time of the tweets, the Knicks had yet to name Fizdale’s replacement.\n\nWorld Peace, according to ESPN, added: “I will absolutely bring that street mentality to the garden. Red brick , hard nose , let’s get it popping. QB (sic) . This would be epic for all people like me. Straight from the jungles to win a title in NYC. Blaat.”\n\nA series of tweets relating to World Peace’s interest in the Knicks job was taken down by Saturday morning, likely in response to the Knicks promoting assistant Mike Miller to interim head coach.\n\n“Love Mike Miller. He dope!” World Peace later tweeted.\n\nWorld Peace, the former St. John’s star who the Knicks passed on in the 1999 NBA draft to the disapproval of fans, has limited coaching experience, having served only as a player development coach for the Lakers’ G League affiliate.\n\nBut that didn’t stop him from laying out his strategy for saving the Knicks, who Fizdale led to a 21-83 record in one-plus seasons.\n\n“If I ever got the @nyknicks job , my first message would be direct to fans and media,” said the 40-year-old, who won a championship with the Lakers in 2010 and spent one season with the Knicks in 2014. “It wouldn’t be nice.But I’m a straight shooter.Pinpoint straight. I’m not happy how you guys put pressure on every coach and star.Shut up and enjoy the game. Be supportive and let’s win a title.”\n\nWorld Peace retired in 2017, and this summer also said on Twitter he was interested in the St. John’s head coaching job, which eventually went to Mike Anderson."
