        "text": "Lunar New Year at Warwick: Chinese Year of the Dragon\n\nFriday 9th Feb 2024\n\nMany people around the world celebrate the start of the New Year in Spring. Join us for a Lunar New Year festival, in an afternoon of snacks, craft and performance incorporating several regional traditions. The festival is known by many names, including the Chinese Spring Festival, Korean Seollal, Vietnamese Tet and Tibetan Losar.\n\nExperience Lunar New Year in Virtual Reality!\n\n4pm - 5pm\n\nFAB Agora\n\nThe VR Club invite you to come and experience Lunar New Year in the VR universe through their Meta Quest Pro Headsets. NO Registration, just drop in and have a go!\n\nWhat can I expect from the event?\n\nWe're still finalising details, but you can find photos from last year's Lunar New Year festival hereLink opens in a new window.\n\nI'm running my own event\n\nFantastic! If you'd like your event to appear on the Warwick Presents calendar, and on this page, please submit your content through our formLink opens in a new window.\n\nWhy are we calling it Lunar New Year?\n\nWithin our university community, we have students, staff members and alumni from a wide range of backgrounds, many of whom also celebrate this festival in different ways and often with different names including Spring Festival, Seollal, Tet and Losar.\n\nAhead of organising the celebrations, we have consulted a wide range of cultural societies around the naming convention for this festival including several of the Chinese societies, and many students favour the inclusivity of the term ‘Lunar New Year’ to reflect the wide variety of backgrounds and traditions encompassed in this celebration. Therefore, in an attempt to increase inclusivity, the University is referring to this festival as the ‘Lunar New Year’, while also referencing the ‘Chinese’ year of the dragon, to acknowledge the broad consensus around the Chinese origins of the zodiac animals.\n\nIt is also clearly understood that individual societies, students, staff members and our alumni community will use the naming convention that feels most authentic to them. We hope this helps to explain why we reference the Lunar New Year alongside the Chinese Year of the Dragon within our University communications.\n\nI have ideas for the event\n\nThat’s great! We want to make sure this event is inclusive for all members of our community. We primarily do our consultation work with relevant cultural societies, so a good way to get feedback to us is by engaging with them."
