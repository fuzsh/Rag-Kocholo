        "text": "If you were to take a stroll through Beijing’s bustling streets in 2011, you may have encountered a similar sign above a rather battered fast food restaurant. I imagine your initial response would be one of mirth; a smile and a shaking of the head at the ludicrous juxtaposition of American politics and fried chicken. But in the context of modern Chinese society, this sign perfectly encapsulates a way of thinking that is widespread throughout China. It is known as Shanzhai.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase is “mountain fortress”, portraying an image of freedom and being outside centralised control. Shanzhai’s modern definition of counterfeit or copyright infringing products harks back to this theme of freedom; manifesting itself as a casual disregard of intellectual property laws and rebellious attitude towards authority. While the phrase may be old, its adoption as a term for knock-off goods is recent. In 2005 a large number of small factories across China started manufacturing cheap copies of popular branded phones, leading to the creation of bastardised brands such as Nokir, Samsing and Suny-Ericcsun. These Shanzhai handsets were to be the first in a wave of copycat technology products that gained significant traction in the domestic market. Through bypassing the need to expend funds on research and development, Shanzhai firms could pass the cost efficiency onto the consumer and manufacture vastly cheaper handsets (as low as one fifth of the cost) in comparison to the authentic brands. Even by China’s lax intellectual property laws, this was illegal. Yet the penalties for the crime are low and China’s justice system was ill suited to handle such legal breaches. So their manufacture continued, causing considerable disruption in the market and cut into the margins of legitimate technology firms. With no effective legal protection, foreign firm’s IPs are exploited and used for economic gain. Thus the amalgamation of Obama flogging fried chicken, the local Chinese owner of the business trading on the familiarity and high health standards of the brand.\n\nThis economic facet of Shanzhai is not unique to China. Numerous countries with weak copy right protection laws experience this form of brand name appropriation (although the scale in which it is carried out China is impressive in its own right). However, what is unique is the way in which Shanzhai has seeped into other aspects of Chinese society and formed an ambiguous counter-cultural movement that playfully subverts existing cultural mediums to create original content. The most clear example of this Shanzhai culture is the annual CCSTV New Year’s Gala. The gala is a 3 hour low budget production broadcast during the Chinese Lunar New Year and performs the role of the jester to the state supported CCTV New years Gala, which has the largest audience for an entertainment show in the world. While still a popular production, the state supported gala has become increasingly political in nature since the 1990s, featuring a montage segment glorifying communist party leaders and a retrospective of the previous years national achievements. This method of propaganda to certain Chinese citizens is grating, these bored individuals forming the grassroots of support for the Shanzhai gala, which although has a vastly smaller budget, is very popular with the younger generation. In 2008, an online survey conducted by major Chinese portal Tianya showed that 73 percent of its 12,350 respondents were looking forward to the Shanzhai show and almost half of those polled said they were tired of the state version.\n\nShanzhai is not just disrupting the market by offering counterfeit goods, it is also disrupting Chinese culture itself by offering alternatives were none previously existed. As Chinese society further evolves alongside the nations economy, Shanzhai will play an instrumental role in the development of a new national identity. While Shanzhai philosophy is somewhat predicated on lack of enforcement of intellectual property laws, for a time at least it will have a significant influence, and despite its moral and legal dubiousness, Obama’s smiling face selling me chicken is undeniably amusing."
