        "text": "Much has been written about how digital technologies transformed contemporary festivals, yet the festival participants’ perceptions and experiences are less examined. Understanding mediated festivals as events of intertwined mediation processes, this paper explores the perception and practices of mediated festivals in contemporary China. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 Chinese young people to understand their motivations and experiences of festival participation. The paper finds that emerging mediated festivals provide a space for individuals to explore their interests. Further, mediated festivals are perceived as a liberating force for young people through choice-making and self-presentation in convivial and hybrid festival environments. Developing Dayan and Katz’s conception of ‘media events’, we argue that contemporary Chinese mediated festivals can be understood as ‘my events’ through hybrid and networked selfrepresentations. Our study contributes to understanding the Chinese mediated festivals, emphasizing how networked individuals (re)negotiate the festival production.\n\nLike every major culture, Chinese has its set of “keywords”: pivotal terms of political, ethical, literary and philosophical discourse. Tracing the origins, development, polysemy, and usages of keywords is one of the best ways to chart cultural and historical changes. This volume analyzes some of these keywords from different disciplinary and temporal perspectives, offering a new integrative study of their semantic richness, development trajectory, and distinct usages in Chinese culture. The authors of the volume explore different keywords and focus on different periods and genres, ranging from philosophical and historical texts of the Warring States period (453-221 BCE) to late imperial (ca. 16th-18th centuries CE) literature and philosophy. They are guided by a similar set of questions: What elevates a mere word to the status of “keyword”? What sort of resonance and reverberations do we expect a keyword to have? How much does the semantic range of a keyword explain its significance? What kinds of arguments does it generate? What are the stories told to illustrate its meanings? What are political and intellectual implications of the keyword’s reevalution? What does it mean to translate a keyword and map its meaning against other languages? Throughout Chinese history, new ideas and new approaches often mean reinterpreting important words; rupture, continuities, and inflection points are inseparable from the linguistic history of specific terms. The premise of this book is that taking the long view and encompassing different disciplines yield new insights and unexpected connections. The authors, who come from the fields of history, philosophy, and literature, explore keywords in different genres and illuminate their multiple dimensions in various contexts. Moreover, despite their different temporal focus, they take into consideration the development of selected keywords from the Warring States to the late imperial period, sometimes adding excurses that extend to contemporary usage.

Using Kachru’s Caliban dynamic as a metaphor, I examine how China attempts to send an ideologically loaded, Sinocentric English back to the ‘colonisers’. The careful construction of language (linguistic engineering) for political purposes is discussed in its various forms of officialese and fixed formulations as peculiar to the Chinese political tradition. The paper concludes by suggesting that due to its limited interest to global society in general, and other reasons, the language of China’s politicised English outreach (i.e. Zhonglish, Xinhua English, New China Newspeak) will continue to retain only a marginal global media presence until ideological divides can be bridged.\n\nThis paper is a sociolinguistic view of China's English language media and its attempted penetration of the global language community.

Recognized for his fluent Mandarin skills and expert delivery, Da Shan (lit. Big Mountain) quickly become China’s biggest foreign celebrity, frequently appearing on national television and performing the highly skilled comic art of crosstalk (xiangsheng). Since Da Shan’s trailblazing appearance, foreign performances of Chinese language and cultural art forms have become common on China’s small screen. Using a combination of content analysis, informal interviews with producers and directors, as well as our own reflections on our experiences as participants on two televised Chinese language and culture competitions, this chapter investigates the political and discursive patterns underlying these spectacles of foreigners performing Chineseness and reflects on how these shows position China, its culture, and its place in the world. We begin by introducing the two programs – the 2010 and 2011 Chinese Bridge Mandarin Proficiency Competitions shown on the nationally popular Hunan Satellite Television (HSTV) and the 2009 Global Chinese Storytelling Competition, broadcast on China Central Television’s Mandarin-language international channel CCTV-4 – and discuss their institutional and political contexts. We examine the organizational roles of Radio Beijing Corporation (RBC) and Hanban, the State Council-affiliated education body behind the world’s Confucius Institutes, and situate the programs in the context of China’s “soft power” push and its often-overlooked domestic nation-building dimensions. We then analyze the shows' key themes, drawing on insights from a broader literature on the role of foreigners in the production of Chinese national identity, in particular the intertwined concepts of self-Orientalism, Occidentalism, and ‘Middle Kingdom mentalities.’ We argue that the two programs deploy foreign performances of Chineseness to present to domestic audiences the image of a powerful, modern and unified Chinese nation, firmly at centre of world civilization. In the process, these shows proclaim the success of China's \"soft power\" initiatives in attracting global validation of this vision of a revitalized Middle Kingdom."
