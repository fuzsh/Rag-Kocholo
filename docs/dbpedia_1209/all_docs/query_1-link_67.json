        "text": "It was a bright and colourful evening filled with music, dance, magic and splendour when the local Chinese community and Batswana convened for the Chinese New Year concert at the Gaborone International Convention Centre.\n\nWhen welcoming the guests host He Liehu, Chairperson of Touchroad International Holdings Group expressed his opinion on the importance of the relationship between China and Botswana citing that his family started business here as far back a 1999 hence the inherent need to bring the festival to Botswana. Liehu also stated that this year Batswana dance students will be awarded scholarships to study in China.\n\nThe Guest speaker of the occasion Former Vice President Dr Ponatshego Kedikilwe stated that celebrations like this were an embodiment of the clich├® that ‘We live in a global village. This embodiment emphasises the collective responsibility emanating from our oneness in the world, Kedikilwe went on to explain the importance of working in unison citing mitigation of global warming and protection of the environment.\n\nAside from culture Kedikilwe went to state that different communities across the globe stand to benefit lot from exchange in other fields of expertise like technology thus resulting in promotion of international trade causing a ripple effect comprised of a series of activities which will ultimately result in employment creation and a better haring of the economic cake.\n\nAnd then the festivities began, there was an illusionist who was very interactive with audience having them hide things from him and then later revealing them. As a parting gift the magician turned a whole scarf into tiny bits of confetti by simply fanning himself and rubbing his fingers together.\n\nUp next came the band, the instruments were mostly string and percussion, resembling flutes, oboes, cellos and pianos and dated back to being over 2000 years old. Right in the middle of the concert two young girls cut in with a bridge and started some kind of synchronised drumming which looked so complicated yet immaculately done.\n\nThere were other traditional Chinese performances like the face changing show followed by a few more solo performances to draw towards the end of the evening.\n\nABOUT THE CHINE NEW YEAR\n\nChinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival in China, is China’s most important traditional festival. It is also the most important celebration for families, and a week of official public holiday. Although there are many HYPERLINK “http://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/festivals/chinese-new-year-legends.htm” interesting legends and stories explaining the start of the Chinese New Year festival, the main two reasons for the festival are:\n\nTo celebrate a year of hard work, have a good rest, and relax with family and to wish for a lucky and prosperous coming year.\n\nChinese people believe that a good start to the year will lead to a lucky year. Chinese traditionally celebrated the start of a new year of farm work, and wished for a good harvest (when most were farmers). This has now evolved to celebrating the start of a new business year and wishing for profits and success in various vocations.\n\nThe main traditional celebrations of the festival include eating reunion dinner with family, giving red envelopes, firecrackers, new clothes, and decorations. More modern celebrations include watching the CCTV Gala, instant message greetings, and cyber money gifts.\n\nChinese New Year is a time for families to be together. Wherever they are, people come home to celebrate the festival with their families.\n\nThe New Year’s Eve dinner is called “reunion dinner”, and is believed to be the most important meal of the year. Big families of several generations sit around round tables and enjoy the food and time together.\n\nSource: http://www.chinahighlights.com/"
