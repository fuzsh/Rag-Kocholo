        "text": "Happy Chinese New Year!\n\nToday marks the first day of the new Lunar Calendar and people around the world will be celebrating the arrival of the Year of the Ox.\n\nChinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is traditionally a 15-day celebration, with most workers getting up to 12 days off to celebrate with their families.\n\nNew Year’s Day is considered the most important of the holiday. Traditionally people use this time to visit parents and grandparents to pay their respects.\n\nOther traditions include abstaining from eating on New Year’s Day and avoiding cleaning or washing as it’s considered unlucky.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Chinese New Year 2021:\n\nWhat is Chinese New Year?\n\nThe festival celebrates the first day of the Lunar calendar. The date changes each year as it is dependent on the new moon that appears between January 21 and February 20.\n\nThis year February 12 is the date for Chinese New Year and will kick off the Year of the Ox.\n\nIn the Chinese zodiac the names of the year rotate through animal names on a 12-year cycle.\n\nIt is considered bad luck when you meet your zodiac sign. Bad news for anyone born in 1925, 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997 or 2009.\n\nHow is Chinese New Year celebrated?\n\nThe day before Chinese New Year is when families clean their homes to get rid of any potential ill fortune and prepare for a fresh start.\n\nThey then gather for an evening ‘reunion dinner’ where they will commemorate the year that has just passed.\n\nThis meal is considered the most important of the year, and is often compared to Thanksgiving in the USA.\n\nIt is traditional for people to stay up to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Many families in China watch the variety TV show ‘CCTV New Year Gala’ which starts at 8pm and runs until 12.30am on New Year’s Day.\n\nUp to 700million people have tuned in in previous years, giving it the record for the most watched TV programme in the world.\n\nOn the stroke of midnight people set off fireworks and firecrackers to make as much noise as possible to ward off evil spirits.\n\nPeople then abstain from bathing or cleaning on the first day of Chinese New Year to avoid washing good fortune away.\n\nThe Spring Festival is also a time for people to visit grandparents or elderly parents to show their appreciation to the older generations.\n\nChinese New Year greeting\n\nThere are numerous ways to greet someone at Chinese New Year and wish them well.\n\nGuo Nian Hao is one of the most common.\n\nWhen does Chinese New Year finish?\n\nCelebrations last for 15 days, and each day of the festival is reserved for different traditions or religious customs.\n\nThe final day is the Lantern Festival, when people release lanterns to symbolise letting go of the past and preparing for a fresh start.\n\nThe Lantern Festival is considered a day for single people to find a romantic partner in countries such as China, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nWomen are encouraged to write their numbers on oranges which are then thrown into a river or lake.\n\nSingle men then collect and eat the oranges.\n\nChinese New Year gifts\n\nYounger generations receive red envelopes containing money from older relatives, and friends and other relatives tend to exchange small gifts.\n\nStrict guidelines exist though on what you can give someone at Chinese New Year.\n\nAnything that shows the passage of time (e.g. a watch) is frowned upon, as is anything associated with funerals such as a handkerchief or black items.\n\nSo a black watch is a big no.\n\nMirrors or anything that could represent walking away from a relationship is also not allowed, so no shoes or socks.\n\nWhat food is eaten at Chinese New Year?\n\nEight individual meat and fish dishes are traditionally served at the New Year’s Eve ‘reunion dinner’, unless there has been a death in the family in the past year, in which case it’s seven dishes.\n\nSome fish is left over to New Year’s Day, when many people choose not to eat meat.\n\nOther Chinese New Year facts\n\nUnsurprisingly, Chinese New Year is one of the most celebrated holidays in the world.\n\nIt is observed by almost one sixth of the world’s population and is the largest annual use of fireworks on the planet, beating the likes of Bonfire Night, Fourth of July and other new year celebrations.\n\nTraditionally, it is also responsible for the biggest annual migration when over one billion people travel to see their families."
