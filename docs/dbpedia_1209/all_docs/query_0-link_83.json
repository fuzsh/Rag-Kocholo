        "text": "Fashion’s biggest night out – the 2024 Met Gala – took place on Monday night. As ever, the gala celebrated the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s spring exhibition, which this year centres around 50 historically significant pieces that are far too fragile to ever be worn again. With the theme of Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, the exhibition features items ranging from a 17th-century Elizabethan-era English bodice through to 21st-century acquisitions by designers including Conner Ives and Stella McCartney. Vintage is an increasingly popular choice on the first Monday in May (last year’s celebration of Karl Lagerfeld really delivered on this front), and this year’s theme saw A-list guests dip into the archives for their Met Gala looks, as well as being inspired by past creations.\n\nWhen is the Met Gala 2024?\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala took place on Monday 6 May in New York. The event has taken place on the first Monday in May every year since 2005, apart from in 2020, when the Met Gala was cancelled, and in 2021, when it was held in September, as a result of the pandemic.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2024 theme?\n\nThe spring 2024 exhibit is entitled Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. The exhibition is structured around approximately 50 beautiful and historically significant pieces from the collection that are far too fragile ever to be worn again. “These are the ‘Sleeping Beauties’ of the title,” Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu curator in charge of The Costume Institute, explained. Cutting-edge curation and technology give a deeper understanding of these fragile pieces – an illusion technique known as Pepper’s ghost has been used to revive some looks, while video animation, light projection, soundscaping, AI, CGI and other forms of sensory stimulation provide a deeper context to each piece, according to Vogue’s Luke Leitch.\n\n“Fashion is one of the most emotional artistic forms because of its connection to the body,” Bolton continued. “It is imbued with memory and emotions, and we relate to it very much via our senses. One thing I hope this show will activate is that sensorial appreciation of fashion.” The exhibition will be open to the public the day after the Met Gala, and will run until 2 September 2024.\n\nRead more: Met Gala 2024 Red Carpet\n\nWho are the co-chairs of the Met Gala 2024?\n\nOn 15 February it was announced that Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Bad Bunny would join Anna Wintour as co-chairs of the 2024 Met Gala, while Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew were named honorary chairs. All eyes were on Zendaya’s look(s): a custom Maison Margiela creation, followed by a vintage Givenchy runway look. Not only is she the internet’s favourite fashion girl and method dresser, it was her first Met Gala since 2019, when she memorably attended as Cinderella, complete with light-up ballgown and stylist Law Roach as her “fairy godmother”.\n\nWhat is the dress code for the Met Gala 2024?\n\nThe dress code was “The Garden in Time”, inspired by a short story of the same name by JG Ballard, who is perhaps best known for his novel Empire of the Sun, which was adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg in 1987.\n\nWritten in 1962, The Garden in Time follows the handsome sophisticate Count Axel and his wife, the majestic Countess, who live in a remote villa in some unnamed paradise that overlooks an abundant garden of crystalline flowers with translucent leaves, twinkling glass-like stems and crystals at the heart of every pistil. But, as with most things Ballard put his name to, there is a dystopian undercurrent to the tale, and this Eden is at risk of invasion by a furious and fast-encroaching mob. To avoid seizure, the Count is forced to pluck time-reversing flowers from his garden until there are none left. The story ends with the Count and his Countess entangled in thorny belladonna plants in a decimated and derelict estate.\n\nWhere can I watch the Met Gala livestream?\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala livestream was hosted exclusively by Vogue and broadcast live across its digital platforms, as well as TikTok and YouTube. Discover more about the Met Gala 2024 livestream here.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nOrganised and presided over by Anna Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala has become a much-loved annual celebration of fashion. A fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, it has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums.\n\nWhat was the theme of the Met Gala 2023?\n\nThe Met Gala 2023 theme was Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, in tribute to the legendary designer who died in 2019. As in previous years, Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton was in charge of the exhibition – which he said was not a “traditional retrospective” – while Amanda Harlech, who worked closely with Lagerfeld, served as the show’s creative consultant. Fittingly, the Met Gala dress code was “In Honour of Karl” – with many guests drawing inspiration from the creative director’s tenures at Chanel, Fendi, Chloé, Patou and his own eponymous brand.\n\nIn 2022, the Met Gala theme was In America: An Anthology of Fashion. The exhibition saw Andrew Bolton focus on inclusivity in fashion and celebrate the unsung heroes of US design. It followed on from the 2021 theme, which was In America: The Lexicon Of Fashion.\n\nFirework content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nIn short: it’s a secret. For this reason, guests must abide by the no phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy. However, the rules were famously broken by a cluster of celebrities smoking and taking selfies in the bathroom in 2017. The event usually involves a high-profile performer (like Rihanna), and guests always explore the exhibition before sitting down together for dinner.\n\nHow many people attend the Met Gala?\n\nThe event usually hosts around 600 attendees, although a smaller number attended the 2021 Met Gala."
