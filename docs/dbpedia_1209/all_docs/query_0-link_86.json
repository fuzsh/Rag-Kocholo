        "text": "National anthems serve as sonic symbols of unity and identity across the globe. One such emblem is the Chinese National Anthem, known as “Yìyǒngjūn Jìnxíngqǔ” (义勇军进行曲) or “March of the Volunteers.”\n\nHistorical Context Chinese National Anthem\n\nOrigins and Creation\n\nThe Chinese National Anthem, “Yìyǒngjūn Jìnxíngqǔ” (义勇军进行曲) or “March of the Volunteers,” emerged during a turbulent period in Chinese history. In the early 1930s, China was grappling with the threat of Japanese invasion, which culminated in the outbreak of full-scale war in 1937. Amid this national crisis, there was a surge of patriotic fervor and a pressing need for a symbol to unify and inspire the Chinese people.\n\nThis song belongs to the marching genre. This song was written by poet and opera composer Tian Han and set to music by Nie Er around the middle of the Sino-Japanese War. Tian Han wrote “March of the Righteous and Courageous Army” in 1934 for a play he composed that same year. According to records, the lyrics of this song were written on a piece of cigarette paper after he was arrested in Shanghai and sent to the Kuomintang prison in 1935.\n\nThe song was originally the subject of a film produced by the Electric Power Company. Shanghai Cinema was staged in 1935. The film’s content is to tell the story of a poet representing the intellectual class of old China, who put aside his pen and took up his gun to attack the anti-Japanese front, rushing before the enemy. The song that appeared at the beginning and end of this movie left a deep impression on a large audience at that time. Not long after, it became a famous Chinese war song during the war against Japan.\n\nEvolution Over Time\n\nThe first person who proposed to make the song “March of the Righteous and Courageous” as the national anthem of the new China was Nie Er, a famous Chinese painter.\n\nPre-1949: Before the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the anthem served as a symbol of national unity and resistance. Its widespread popularity and association with the anti-Japanese movement cemented its status in the hearts of the Chinese people.\n\nPost-1949: With the founding of the PRC in 1949, “March of the Volunteers” was officially adopted as the national anthem. This formal recognition underscored the anthem’s significance in the country’s modern history and its role in the collective memory of national struggle and triumph.\n\n1982 Reconfirmation: In 1982, the National People’s Congress reaffirmed the anthem’s status, ensuring its continued role as a key element of Chinese national identity. This reaffirmation coincided with efforts to standardize its rendition and promote its respectful performance across various public and official settings.\n\nLyrics and Translation\n\nThe Chinese lyric version\n\n起来(1)！不愿做奴隶的人们！Qǐlái (1) !
