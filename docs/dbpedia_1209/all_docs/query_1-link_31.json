        "text": "Scholarship on modern China tends to focus on violence, suffering and trauma. While some pioneering scholars did venture into the comic world of modern China earlier,Footnote 1 it is only in recent years that studies of modern Chinese humour and comedy have gained momentum, revealing long-overlooked vigour, dynamism and complexities in Chinese culture and society.Footnote 2 In particular, a 2019 edited volume, Maoist Laughter, corrects the stereotypical grim view of Maoist China by demonstrating that prior to the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), not only did the government actively tap into comedy for propaganda purposes but writers and artists also exercised ingenious innovations to create healthy laughter that contributed to the construction of a new sense of subjectivity and new social relationships. The end of the Cultural Revolution witnessed a revival of not only comedy in mainland China but also the government's interest in manipulating and regulating it for its own objectives. Although the social environment under “reform and opening-up” and the rapid development of technology in the forms of television, internet and social media have allowed writers and artists unprecedented space to be innovative, playful, irreverent and provocative, the state's surveillance is never far away. This situation creates an intriguing cultural and political dynamic that begs further scholarly attention.\n\nThis paper delves into that dynamic by examining the satiric skits (xiaopin 小品) performed at the Spring Festival Gala, which is broadcast annually on the state-run China Central Television (CCTV).Footnote 3 The CCTV gala has been an integral part of Chinese people's New Year celebrations since its inception in 1983. Attracting millions of domestic and overseas viewers every year, it has the largest viewing audience of any programme in China. The popularity of the gala's xiaopin is particularly interesting because although the xiaopin offers a witty satire of emerging social problems in the reform era, hence providing a comedic valve for the members of the audience to relieve their accumulated anxieties in a fast-changing society, these sketches are written and performed under the close scrutiny of state censorship. As arguably the most popular performance in the most-watched show on China's most-censored television channel, the gala xiaopin finds itself caught between the audience's desire for provocation and the state's demands for propaganda. Relying on the audience's immediate response for success and on the state's permission for survival, the gala xiaopin provides a unique lens through which to investigate political discourse in contemporary China and specifically how the populace and the state contest and engage with each other through laughter."
