        "text": "History\n\nIn the early 1980s, CCTV director Huang Yihe proposed the idea of hosting a televised party to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and the first CCTV New Year's Gala aired in 1983.[3] Operating on a very low budget, Huang was given a studio of 600 square metres (6,500 sq ft), which could accommodate only 60 staff members and 200 guests.[6] With no money for recording and editing, the show was improvised and broadcast live. It was hosted by Liu Xiaoqing, Ma Ji, Jiang Kun, and Wang Jingyu, and the studio had four telephones accepting live requests from callers nationwide.[6] The popular singer Li Guyi ended the night with nine performances, and the co-host Jiang Kun performed three xiangsheng comedies.[6] Huang and his colleagues took considerable political risk broadcasting the live show, as pop singers such as Li Guyi were at the time under attack by hardliners as \"spiritual pollution\", and one of her most popular songs, Hometown Love (ä¹¡æ), was still officially banned.[7] With the permission from Wu Lengxi, the Minister of Radio and Television who was in the audience, Li Guyi performed the song for the first time on national TV.[7]\n\nAfter the first New Year Gala proved a huge hit with viewers nationwide, Wu was tasked with directing the second edition. At the time, China and Britain were under intense negotiation over the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the status of Hong Kong. Huang came up with the idea of inviting the amateur Hong Kong singer Cheung Ming-man to perform at his show.[7] It was then unprecedented for a Hong Kong entertainer to perform on Chinese TV and his request met significant resistance. Huang persistently lobbied government officials and eventually gained their approval. Cheung's performance of the patriotic song \"My Chinese Heart\" at the 1984 gala made him a household name in China.[7][6]\n\nThe program has attracted extremely large audiences, which have grown significantly over the years. The CCTV New Year's Gala is the most watched television program in the world, with one billion viewers in 2018.[5] As the Chinese New Year's Eve is a time when the family gathers, the typical situation involves a large 3-generation family gathered in front of their TV set while making dumplings for the first New Year's meal. The Gala adds a mood of celebration in the house as people laugh, discuss and enjoy the performance. It has become an ingrained tradition on Mainland China to watch the New Year's Gala on New Year's Eve. Rural areas that had previously been unfamiliar with concepts such as television would hold great gatherings on New Year's Eve to watch the program.[5]\n\nWhile Beijing has been the main event venue, the Gala of 1996 was the first to be broadcast also from separate studios in Nanjing and Shanghai, and that experience, since 2016, has become a permanent part of the night-long broadcast with the Gala not only staged live from the CCTV's Beijing studios but from four other major Chinese cities, to emphasize the network's and the event's national reach.\n\nIn 2011, Dashan made another appearance in the gala, alongside several foreign nationals of various ages, all engaging in fluent Mandarin conversation, including one of Russian nationality, an Australian and a Kenyan. The 2011 show was also noted for the appearances of various \"ordinary people\" performers who were selected by popular vote in a TV competition months prior.\n\nThe 'ordinary people' portrayals continued in 2012; several amateurs performed on the show. Coinciding with the rise of amateur performers is the decline of nationalist and political rhetoric. In both 2011 and 2012 versions of the Gala, imagery of national leaders were removed from the show. The 2012 gala was directed by Ha Wen, wife of host Li Yong. In a break with tradition, the 2012 Gala removed the announcements of embassies overseas sending New Year's greetings, as well as the \"My Favorite New Year's Gala Act\" voting announcement. It also did not conclude with a rendition of \"Can't Forget Tonight\", thus breaking the practice for the first time.[8]\n\nThe 2013 version of the Gala, the 30th in its history, concluded with the return of \"Can't Forget Tonight\".\n\n2015's Gala edition saw \"Can't Forget Tonight\" being accompanied by viewer-submitted videos from all over China singing the classic song.\n\nThe Gala is also broadcast with subtitles and since recently on air commentary on the China Global Television Network stations, with the latter also featuring blow by blow updates from China and abroad and in 2016 a panel discussion by experts. By midnight, all international channels end their simulcast to give way to live broadcast of the midnight Lunar New Year's Day fireworks and celebrations nationwide and from overseas.\n\nPolitics\n\nIn the early days of the Gala in the 1980s, the show focused almost entirely on arts and entertainment. Programming that was chiefly political in nature was very rare, reflecting the general openness of Chinese society in the 1980s and the departure of Maoist political dogma from the lives of ordinary people. Communist Party leaders took an interest in the show as early as 1984, when then-General Secretary Hu Yaobang watched the show and resolved to learn how to sing \"My Chinese Heart\" by singer Cheung Ming-man. Then, in 1990, Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng appeared on the show, ostensibly to participate in the celebration rather than disseminate a political agenda; Jiang gave a speech expressing his well-wishes.[9] This six-minute live segment was the only instance national leaders participated in the program in its history.[10]\n\nProgramming with heavy political undertones began appearing in the gala in the 1990s. As audiences grew, the show became a ritualized event of national significance and experienced increased state involvement in its production. Often, segments of the show became devoted to celebrating the previous year's \"national achievements\" and a preview of significant events of the upcoming year. In 2008, state media reported that major officials from the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China and the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television were on scene during the gala's rehearsal to supervise its production.[11] In that same year, a segment featuring migrant workers was inserted into the show on the recommendation of Premier Wen Jiabao.[10]\n\nThroughout the years, officials in charge of propaganda and media control, including Ding Guangen, Li Changchun, and Liu Yunshan, have paid visits to the Chunwan production team. Commenting on the political evolution of the Gala over the years, Takungpao said that Chunwan has evolved from a \"year-end tea party\" to a \"conference for disseminating political propaganda.[9]\n\nImagery of party leadership\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the show has consistently included one segment featuring a video montage of Communist Party leaders accompanied by background music. Shown every year were images of those considered paramount leaders, including Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. In 2007 and 2008, the video footage featured the entire line-up of Politburo Standing Committee members. Between 2011 and 2014, imagery of national leaders were absent from the show, and the amount of political content varied from year to year. For example, the 2011 show featured a rendition of a patriotic song that emphasized Hu Jintao's Harmonious Society and Scientific Development Concept ideologies. In 2012 there was minimal political content, though parts of the show alluded to \"building a strong nation\" and the 18th Party Congress which was to be held in the fall of that year. The 2014 show, however, was again peppered with political enhancements throughout that paid homage to General Secretary Xi Jinping's \"Chinese Dream\" ideology, in addition to several nationalistic-themed songs. The 2015 show, reportedly one of the most closely managed affairs in years,[12] prominently featured Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, with three comedy routines being linked to the theme. In addition, in a remarkable departure from convention, the 2015 show also featured Xi Jinping exclusively in a lengthy video montage during an opera-style song entitled \"Give my Heart to You\".[13] The heavy emphasis on political content continued in 2016; that edition, believed to be one of the most political affairs since the show's inception, saw a return of the more familiar line-up of national leaders. Since 2017, however, the gala has not shown imagery of national leaders, opting instead of showcase various aspects of economic development or nationalist themes.[14]\n\nNational unity\n\nNational unity and Chinese reunification has been a theme on the show since the 1990s. For example, in 2009 and 2010, in response to criticism that Chunwan was too focused on the tastes and preferences of audiences from northern China, producers introduced a feature that involved a wide range of provincial TV stations to reflect regional differences and interests. In 2012, the New Year's countdown included the hosts reading out couplets in Shanghainese, Cantonese, and Henan dialect.\n\nEvery year, the program almost always involves performers from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. In some years, the affiliation of artists with any of these entities were stated explicitly on screen, but this practice has not always been consistently applied. A similar practice was adopted for foreign artists.[15]\n\nMilitary\n\nThe People's Liberation Army is featured in the show's programming every year, usually in the form of a song, although sometimes military-themed sketch comedies have also appeared. Many of the Gala's most prominent singers have a background in the performing arts troupe of the PLA, including Yan Weiwen, Song Zuying, Dong Wenhua and Peng Liyuan.[9]\n\nControversies\n\nWorkers Arena lighting effects (1985)\n\nIn 1985, the gala was held in the Workers Indoor Arena. It had a live audience dispersed throughout the arena. Production staff were not equipped with walkie-talkies, so they improvised their communication with artists, running around or gesturing from a distance to give cues. This made the show appear uncoordinated and exceptionally slow on television; the edition lasted over six hours and remains the longest gala on record. The live audience was also milling about the arena for the duration of the show, which was distracting and noisy for the television audience. It was most strongly criticized for its poor lighting effects that made the stage difficult to see.[16]\n\nChen Peisi sues CCTV distributor (1998)\n\nChen Peisi and his artistic collaborator Zhu Shimao were household names in the 1990s, partly owing to their appearances on the gala. After their hit sketch piece in the 1998 show, a subsidiary of CCTV distributed their performances on VCD without gaining the pair's permission in advance. In 2000, Chen and Zhu sued the subsidiary and won; the court ordered restitution and rescinded their rights to Chen and Zhu's work. Thereafter, Chen and Zhu never appeared on the gala again.[17]\n\nDark Three Minutes (2007)\n\nIn the 2007 edition, just before the clock struck midnight, the six hosts of the show assembled on stage suffered a mass breakdown referred to as the \"dark three minutes\". Zhu Jun, Zhou Tao, Li Yong, Dong Qing, Zhang Zequn and Liu Fangfei collectively started a chain of misread and mistimed lines. Zhang Zequn was the first to read his lines incorrectly, obviously reciting the wrong chunlian, although the audience still applauded. Li Yong then mentioned the transition from the year bingxu (year of the dog) to dinghai (year of the pig) and a greeting to \"mother comrades across the country\" before being cut off by Zhu Jun's loud declaration that the new year had almost arrived. Liu Fangfei, who was relatively new to the gala, then read a line that was obviously incomplete, followed by seconds of dead air. Zhou Tao tried following it up, only to be interrupted by Li Yong. Zhou then gave Li Yong an annoyed stare, obviously visible as the camera was focused on her. Zhu Jun then interrupted Li Yong again, only to be in turn interrupted by Zhou Tao before the ten-second countdown began.[18] Host Zhang Zequn apologized for the incident on his CCTV blog.\n\nRole of Women in Society (2015)\n\nSome observers have criticized the Gala for resisting larger trends in Chinese society, such as the increased role of women in society and changing gender norms. The 2015 skit \"Goddesses and Tomboys\" (å¥³ç¥åå¥³æ±å­), led by Jia Ling, faced particular derision online for its portrayal of strong female roles in society and its insensitive depiction of the \"sheng nu\" phenomenon.[19]\n\nUgly Monkey (2016)\n\nIn 2016, the Gala was criticized for planning to include a \"virtual mascot\", modeled in 3D based on a painting of a monkey by Han Meilin that was described as \"a monster\" and \"ugly\" by many.[20] The digital mascot was also mocked on various Chinese social networks.[21]\n\nBlackface (2018)\n\nThe 2018 edition was criticized for a comedy skit focusing on China-Africa relations, and in particular, the country's investments in African railways. The skit featured Chinese actress Lou Naiming wearing blackface and a prosthetic buttocks to portray the mother of an African woman. The woman had asked the host to pose as her husband so she wouldn't be subjected to an arranged date. However, after the host exposed the ruse by introducing her wife, the woman's mother excuses it, declaring her love for China and its people. The skit was ridiculed by viewers and social media, especially among local groups and diaspora, for its invocation of African stereotypes.[22]\n\nImagery of pigs\n\nThe 2007 and 2019 editions, despite celebrating the year of the pig in the Chinese zodiac, eschewed nearly all imagery and language invoking pigs - some suspect due to official sensitivities shown towards Muslim minority groups in China (and in the latter case possibly due to an outbreak of African swine fever).[23]"
