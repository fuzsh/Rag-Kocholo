        "text": "The CCTV New Yearâs Gala titled âSetting Sail for 2024â was recorded in Jiaojiang District, Taizhou City from December 2nd to 21st. Themed âHarmony, Shared Dreams, Setting Sail for a Better Tomorrow,â the gala vividly showcased the vision of the people of Taizhou for a better life and their determination to open up new prospects. 1,370 student volunteers from Taizhou University played an important role in the gala.\n\n1,000 student volunteers from Jiaojiang Campus, led by teachers, participated in the recording at the main stage of Harmony (âHeheâ) Park. Wearing matching uniforms, they departed from the campus every afternoon and returned in the early morning, diligently completing audience performances across various sections of the stage. With clear roles, high energy, and a keen adherence to rules, the volunteers followed every requirement of the directors during the recording. Their genuine smiles and heartfelt applause demonstrated Taizhouâs warmth and hospitality to the nation, earning unanimous praise from the galaâs directing team, key municipal leaders, and the district committeeâs task group.\n\n300 volunteers from Linhai Campus rocked the stage as backup dancers for the performance called âWildâ. Under the directorâs guidance, they practiced their moves and formations tirelessly, nailing a vibrant and well-organized umbrella dance performance. Meanwhile, 70 volunteers from the School of Arts and Design joined forces as a choir for the songs âRadianceâ and âPrologue of Tomorrow.â On both Dachen Island Stage and the main stage in Harmony Park, these performers, guided by skilled conductors and directors, fine-tuned their coordination with the singers and remembered the complex performance with perfect precision.\n\nTU attached great importance to the recording of the gala, and the Publicity Department, Youth League Committee, and various departments and academic schools collaborated closely to ensure the smooth completion of the event. Logistics support volunteers from different departments and academic schools were also on deck, offering services like meals, material distribution, timekeeping, emergency response, and more, providing robust support to ensure a successful recording process for the students.\n\nThroughout days of intense rehearsal and mock recordings, our dedicated volunteers have consistently shown a strong sense of responsibility and collective pride. Theyâve diligently followed the event schedule, actively engaging in the recording process. Overcoming challenges like lengthy rehearsal hours, demanding workloads, intricate performance routines, and chilly weather, theyâve striven to deliver not just captivating performances but also a flawless stage for people nationwide. During these rehearsals and recordings, our volunteers have embodied the energetic, resilient, and optimistic spirit of TU students. Chen Sihong, a student volunteer, said, âBeing part of the New Yearâs Gala recording is an honor for me. Despite the complex performances and hard work, Iâve had some of the most unique moments in my life. Iâve gained valuable experiences and learned the virtues of selfless dedication and persistence. Seeing the performances we contributed to finally broadcast fills me with a tremendous sense of accomplishment.â\n\nTU student volunteers demonstrated unwavering commitment and exceeded expectations. They diligently contributed over 240 hours, working tirelessly from noon until the early hours over a span of more than two weeks. Their exemplary performance in every recording task upheld the highest standards of quality, reflecting the essence of volunteer service and the beauty of unity in Taizhou, playing a crucial role in ensuring the resounding success of the New Yearâs Gala recording."
