        "text": "Saturday, February 10, marked the beginning of the most significant date on the Chinese Calendar: Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival.\n\nShuang Zhao recently relocated here to the Cook Islands with her young son William, to teach the Confucius class at University of the South Pacific’s Avarua campus.\n\n“It’s a good time to share Chinese culture here and let everyone know there are other big celebrations similar to Christmas Day and New Years Eve,” says Zhao.\n\nLast week, students were invited to learn Chinese calligraphy to create their own blessing cards and couplets, to give well wishes to loved ones and bless their homes with abundance.\n\nZhao hosted a dumpling making lesson as the delicacy is a staple of Spring Festival tradition.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the celebration, homes are given a deep clean to clear out the previous year’s dust and energy. Homes are decorated in vibrant red for luck.\n\n“On the eve of the festival we get together with family, eat dumplings and watch the celebrations on TV.”\n\nCCTV New Year’s Gala is China’s most watched television special, entertaining families every Spring Festival since 1983.\n\nSpecial attention is given to the youngest members of the family: “Children receive lucky bags from parents and grandparents, with money inside.”\n\nThe money is wrapped in a red envelope with the intention of dispelling evil spirits from the children.\n\nFamilies look forward to extravagant fireworks displays, which are also tied into fairy tales and traditions.\n\n“There’s a traditional monster called Nian. People set off firecrackers to get rid of the monster,” Zhao said.\n\nIconic red lanterns, massive banquets and parades, and light festivals are standard sights during this time not only in China, but around the world.\n\nThis year is the “Year of the Dragon” according to the Chinese zodiac, which features a 12-year cycle with each year represented by a specific animal.\n\nPeople born in the Years of the Dragon including 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, and 2024 will experience their Zodiac Year of Birth (Ben Ming Nian).\n\nZhao is excited to celebrate, being born in the Year of the Dragon herself."
