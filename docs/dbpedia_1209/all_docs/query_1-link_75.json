        "text": "Different forces influence media in different ways and follow different philosophies.\n\nHow Party Force influences media in China\n\nIf the CPC were the only party in China, or if the CPC were a perfect branch of the Soviet Communist Party, then the CPC’s media philosophy should be naturally Soviet Communist, which was first defined and discussed by Siebert (1956). However, the truth is that the CPC has had Chinese characteristics since its birth, but we have to agree that its philosophy still falls into the general zone of Communism. Zhao pointed out that (Zhao 1998) Party journalism has a long history, which can be tracked back to “radical journals of the late 1910s and early 1920s in which students and intellectuals voiced their opposition to imperialism and to Chinese warlords.” From the founding of the CPC in 1921 to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, the Party press played a key role as an organ. There were 34 newspapers and journals in the Jiangxi Soviet. In the era of Yan’an, Mao Zedong released a famous speech May 1942 entitled “Talks at The Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art”, which has continued and still has impacted the Chinese Party press. In his talk, Mao said the following:\n\nThe problem of class stand: Our stand is that of the proletariat and of the masses. For members of the Communist Party, this means keeping to the stand of the Party, keeping to Party spirit and Party policy.\n\nThis talk by Mao defined the basic purpose of the Party press in China and disciplined its tone and manner. After the CPC established the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and even after the external openness facilitated by Deng Xiaoping since the 1980s, this concept has not changed.\n\nTo achieve the Party organ’s goal, the CPC has been influencing media through ownership, sponsorship and censorship. In the category of traditional media, the CPC has maintained ownership of one of the largest newspapers in China, People’s Daily, since its launch in 1949. In addition, the CPC central committee also owns a bi-monthly Party journal, Qiu Shi (Seeking Truth), which was launched in June 1988 under directions from Deng Xiaoping, replacing the Red Flag periodical. From the CPC central committee organisational chart, we can find the rank of People’s Daily is the highest of all newspapers in the market. At the provincial and prefectural levels, all Party committees produce their own dailies (Murphy 2007).\n\nThe CPC does not own every media source in China, but its propaganda department is in charge of censorship of all media content. Censorship is the active attempt by the Party to suppress material that a production entity plans to compose or has already composed. All the above-mentioned media function not mainly as vehicles of social communication or as the voice of different groups but as “mouthpieces” of the Party or as “Propaganda tools” to promote the official ideology and consolidate the power of the state. Thus, censorship is vital in this system. On the other hand, the media itself will conduct self-censorship as a response.\n\nAt the nationwide macroscale, the Central Propaganda Department, through its well-organised system, oversees the Propaganda and Education System (xuanjiao xitong) that monitors, instructs and censors all of China’s newspapers and magazines, film, television and radio broadcasting, the Internet, the publishing industry and all aspects of cultural and information production from the highest to the lowest levels of society.\n\nAt the level of corporate administration, there is a key person, the Party branch secretary, who is responsible for implementing the Party’s tasks. This could be interpreted as the human resource promise of Party Force in the media system.\n\nHow Governmental Force influences the media in China\n\nIn discussing the state role of the Russian media system, Smaele (Dobek-Ostrowska 2010) listed four roles: owner, funder, regulator and censor. The situation is exactly the same in China. The Chinese central government regulates the media in the philosophy of authoritarianism, which emphasizes the national benefit as first priority. It is natural that government tends to amplify national interest. The authoritarian concept can be traced back to Plato, in his works The Public, Statesman and the Laws, and The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli.\n\nIf we agree that authoritarian philosophy is commonly represented in the governance of society in three main areas, i.e. decree, legislative process and religious doctrine, then we find this philosophy has been widely practiced by Chinese dynasties throughout Chinese history, but in another totally independent discourse system. Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period, specifically Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country, which were characteristics of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, i.e. Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers, such as Confucius, Mencius and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralised government centred on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China’s adoption of communism in 1949, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the twentieth century, and its influence has remained marked until now.\n\nAncient Chinese political philosophy had faith in the way of heaven, the will of heaven, the fortune of heaven and the principles of heaven. As the son of heaven, the emperor was determined by heaven, and this was the reason for his incontestable authority. The ancient Chinese political system was inclusive (史仲文,陈桥生 2010), which exhibited some characteristics of authoritarianism. For example, imperial authority, the sovereign power, surmounted all laws, and the ethical codes replaced laws in tradition. These traditions have been embedded and resurrected in the current government behaviours.\n\nGovernment Force interrupts media before any content has been produced. No matter the form or format of the content, media producers need to apply for a certificate or license in advance. The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television issues licenses for most traditional media, whereas the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology takes care of the online and mobile media.\n\nGovernmental Force controls content through censorship by governmental departments and self-censorship by media. Punishment is another procedure controlling content, including the closing of a facility, the separation of a cadre from his post, the dismissal of media professionals or even arrest if there is criminal evidence involved.\n\nThe regulations released from government results in significant modification of media behaviours. In 2011, The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television issued new rules restricting commercials from interrupting TV dramas, allowing them to air only back-to-back between programs. It has been reported the restrictions, which went into effect at the beginning of 2012, were intended to spur broadcasters to show more cultural programming, helping them to uphold a “public service”(Burkitt 2011).\n\nHow Capital Force influences the media in China\n\nThe first question about Capital Force is who is holding the capital and buying media in China? In the broad term, media buyers include advertising agencies and direct sponsors, who sign contracts with media entities to publish advertisements, build partnership with media or purchase product placement opportunities. The media buyers form the group of people who produce the Capital Force, and they represent either private capital or state-owned capital, regardless of whether they are from professional investment companies or from ordinary enterprises.\n\nCapital Force in China displays a tendency to believe in the fantasy of the free market, and the people involved in Capital Force pretend to act as if they are in the USA where libertarian philosophy is fully developed and practiced. In the governance of society, libertarian media philosophy is often demonstrated in two aspects: constitutional law, which honours the private ownership of property, and legislative and judicial law, which allows a free market in which media content and producers can compete against one another. Indeed, President Hu Jintao has published the Property Law of the People’s Republic of China (Hu 2011). Historically, the Capital Force’s first change to media in China has been with regard to ownership, starting from the opening policy established in the 1980s. Taking the example of newspapers, according to Daniela Stockmann’s investigation (Stockmann 2012), Chinese media practitioners distinguish between three types of newspapers, official, semi-official and commercialised papers. Among these three types, the commercialised papers can be owned by private capital or joint capital between the private sector and organisations of either the government or Party. For example, the biggest search engine, Baidu, is a public company and has been listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange since 2005.\n\nCapital Force follows Liberalism as a media philosophy, which is related to the truth about capital in the Chinese media market, as mentioned by many scholars, that all types of media have joined the market competition and chase after profit. However, in comparison to fully commercialised and free media markets, such as in the US, there is another difference in Capital Force influence over media, which is the market response to media performance. In a free market, media companies gain profit because of good performance and lose profit or even go bankrupt when their performance is bad. Using the term invented by Adam Smith, the media market is balanced by an “invisible hand”, which encourages better performance and punishes worse competition. In China, in addition to the “invisible hand”, there is a “visible hand” operated by either the CPC or government, or sometimes both, which sometimes interrupts and confuses the market response.\n\nAt the corporation level of media management, the key role involved in practicing Capital Force is the sales manager in charge of gaining income. Regardless of the ownership or category the media organisation belongs to, this role is crucial to acquiring revenue, making marketing plans, supervising branding and negotiating with media buyers, among other such related factors.\n\nWith the growth of advertisement, the media’s capacity to carry advertisement has reached its limits and sometimes is already overused. In addition, after many years of being targeted by brand or product advertisements, audiences have become increasingly discriminating. As a result, paid content, such as product placement and infomercials,Footnote 2 have recently been broadly used in the Chinese media. This will change the landscape of the Capital Force affecting media in China so that it is much more ambiguous.\n\nHow Professional Force influences the media in China\n\nTo explain the journalistic variations that cannot be clearly revealed using a state-policy press model alone, Ostini and Ostini (2002) examined the importance of professionalism in a new media model other than the normative model discussed in Four Theories of the Press (Siebert 1956). When discussing the post-Soviet media model, Oates (2007) highlighted the evidence of the lack of journalistic professionalism, which exists, but is not complete and not useful in the protection of media as the Fourth Estate. The situation of the professionalism in media in China is similar and different.\n\nWu Fei and Wu Feng (吴飞 and 吴风 2004) conducted a survey on the construction of ideas of journalistic professionalism among Chinese media professionals. One of the interesting results from their research work is that newspaper professionals rank “Factual Accuracy” as the most important achievement, whereas television professionals state “Objective Reporting” as the first priority. The professionals also pursue other career goals, such as “Timeliness”, “Exclusive Reporting”, “Deep Investigation”, “Attractiveness”, “Justice”, “Balanced Reporting”, “Originality” and “Comprehensiveness”. The professionals working in newspaper and television react slightly differently to these indexes, but they both gave “Balanced Reporting” the lowest importance. This lack of concern over balance is most likely because there are too many forces for the professionals to balance, and the balance is always difficult. Arguably, the lack of concern with balance is because they know it is not expected of them in this system. At the minimum, Wu’s research proved the existence of professionalism in the Chinese media.\n\nThe contemporary Chinese press was inaugurated at the end of the nineteenth century, including the Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao and Zi Lin Xi Hu Bao, during the awakening of national consciousness as a result of coming into contact with previously unknown European powers (Passin 1963). September 1, 1926, three journalists, Wu Dingchang, Hu Zhengzhi and Zhang Jiluan, re-established a newspaper, the Ta Kung Pao, and announced “4-No-ism” as its slogan—“no party affiliation, no political endorsement, no self-promotion, no ignorance (bu dang, bu mai, bu si, bu mang 不党、不卖、不私、不盲)” (侯迎忠 2005) and pledged to say no to all political parties, governments, commercial companies and individual persons seeking to influence them. Such protection of editorial rights generated a defending force against other forces in the media system, sometimes causing tragedies. A possible new version of this type of conflict is a CCTV producer’s resignation because of his blogs (Chin 2013).\n\nThe vehicle for Professional Force to affect media is the pressure exerted back on the forces from the CPC, the government and the capital. As shown in Fig. 2, we can find that the direction of Party Force, Governmental Force and Capital Force are from outside the media, whereas the Professional Force provides a counterforce against these three forces.\n\nMedia professionalism is not a new concept in China. Media practitioners cannot be equated with the scholar-officials (儒生) of ancient dynasties, but both contemporary media professionals and ancient scholar-officials share the same heritage of “Emotion to Family and Country” (Jia Guo Qing Huai, 家国情怀). The scholar-official tradition in ancient dynasties gives Chinese intellectuals the heritage and right to express themselves independently on behalf of protecting universal values (Fairbank and Goldman 2006). The scholar-officials were selected by an imperial examination system, which was an institutionalised form of the Confucian aphorism, “If one wants to be an official, he has to study well.” After being transferred to an official, the scholar became part of the administrative machine and took the role of “Shepherd” to look after the public—the “Sheep” (Boxu 2010). The heritage of being a “Shepherd” and helping emperors to control the content of the media is still considered part of professionalism among the Chinese media practitioners, especially in the mainstream media. It is inconceivable that the national Governmental Force, either an emperor or a central government, can control the media without insiders’ support (Table 1).\n\nHow Individual Force influences the media in China\n\nIndividual here is a term referring to members of the public identified as consumers, such as audience members, readers, listeners or users in media systems. The media executives or members, when consuming media content, are also considered as individuals.\n\nVia the media audience, Individual Force acts on media content, usually, without direct financial involvement. In the traditional situation, for example, when CCTV is producing a program, the Individual Force is only exerted via audience feedback, which is a weak link between the producer and audience, because this volunteering response is naturally motivated. CCTV welcomes suggestions for change that fit their basic assumptions about their audience and that do not challenge the pressure from the CPC and government, even if the suggestions mean giving up some of the routines they are used to. However, if the audience’s demands to a media organisation will cause tremendous readjustment from its basic policies or values, the production personnel will respond negatively or even ignore this message from the individual audience.\n\nIndividual Force can own media, thanks to the Internet, and further change is being recognised as the mobile Internet has become more easily accessible. The audience was a disenfranchised group that had been excluded from media production processes dominated by the Party, governments and corporations before. However, the relationship between media and individuals changed after the wide use of the Internet. In a series of writings, Jay Rosen with other co-authors (Merritt and Rosen 1995; Rosen and Merritt 1994; Rosen 1996) invented a media philosophy (Democratic-Participant) that provides a theory for individuals participating in the media system. The following two active methods by which individuals engage in social media practice need to be emphasised. Firstly, Individual Force provides feedback via the audience, as discussed above. The increasing feasibility for individuals to interact with the media through the Internet and mobile Internet results in a trigger of the amount of response back to media or about the media content. The response speed audience feedback is faster than ever. In addition, the amount of feedback is enormous, and the frequency with which the audiences send back information is higher. With the Internet and mobile Internet, the pressure exerted on individuals on the media is scaled up. Secondly, Individual Force creates content. UGC, User-Generated Content, has become part of the media itself, which means individuals are contributing directly to creating content and not only to consuming content passively as they previously did.\n\nFrom the perspective of ownership, Individual Force is also now capable of generating media content through many business platforms, such as Apple’s iTunes store and Google’s Google Play.\n\nIndividual Force pushes the media as well as Party Force, Governmental Force and Capital Force simultaneously. The case of Lei Zhengfu demonstrates this feature. Lei was sacked from his position a few days after a sex video recorded 5 years ago went viral online via the popular microblog service Sina Weibo. The video was created for the purpose of blackmail by the collusion of a property developer and an 18-year-old girl. On November 20, 2011, at 4 pm, a series of hotel room sex screenshots titled “Lei, the secretary who accepts sex bribes” were published on a personal website called “Civil Supervision”. Lei Zhengfu was the Beibei District of Chongqing Party Secretary at the time. A few hours later, these screenshots started to go viral through microblogs. Sixty-three hours after the screenshots first went online, on November 23, a Chongqing Municipal People’s Government information office official made an announcement that the government had proved the male shown in the video was Lei and stated he would be removed from his position. This case is believed to be a result of “Network supervision by public opinion”(吴永强 2012).\n\nIndividual Force leads a significant social change and agenda-setting procedure in the public sphere, which was led formerly by traditional media and aimed to interpret mainly the will of the CPC or government. In the above case, social media operated by an individual triggered the whole communication chain, which lead to all levels of the media being involved.\n\nHow Cultural Force influences the media in China\n\nChinese culture is the combination of social relationships, customs, values, norms and institutions that constitute and inform society.\n\nChinese culture provides an intangible foundation for the media system, especially in that China has a long history. Many Chinese people will round up their history of civilisation to greater than approximately 5000 years, because there have been versions of a Chinese state for around 5000 years. Martin Jacques, in his best-seller book When China Rules The World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order, indicates that “China is not just a nation-state” “but a civilisation-state.” Chinese identity is “overwhelmingly a product of its civilizational history” (Martin 2009). The long history of and heavy dependence on civilisation give rise to the reality that Chinese culture has a strong impact over the media and media system in China. On the other hand, if there is a philosophy behind Cultural Force in the media system in China, Cultural Nationalism would be the correct one. This paradox reflects the spatial and temporal dimensions culture force that takes place in the media system. From the perspective of time, Chinese culture has input cultural elements nourished by civilisation history. In regards to spatial span, Chinese culture does not refuse a national boundary and stands out in the form of nationalism. Townsend (1992) discussed the evolution from culturalism to nationalism in China, alerted the differentiation between culturalism and nationalism. It is worth repeating that Chinese Culturalism is both a Chinese identity and the movement maintaining such an identity, whereas Chinese Cultural Nationalism vigorously defends Chinese culture against foreign competitors. In the political domain, nationalism is also a concept of political identity.\n\nCompared with the existed media Developmental Philosophy (McKenzie 2006) holding that media are to improve the social conditions of developing nations by international assistance, Cultural Nationalism pays more attention to the cultural meaning of media content and its impact on culture in return, within Chinese borders.\n\nTo enhance the understanding about how culture influences media, we may need to examine Chinese culture more deeply and explore how its uniqueness influences the Chinese media system. The theoretical frames measuring culture worldwide, such as Culture Dimensions (Hofstede and Bond 1988), World Value Survey and IBM’s Comparative Attitude Surveys (Hofstede and Bond 1988), have provided approaches from a Western perspective and highlighted some interesting points. For example, respect for age and hierarchy is a hallmark of Chinese culture (Faure and Fang 2008). Fang (2012) introduced a Yin–Yang model to explain culture, which is most likely the theory that is most accurate for Chinese culture in particular.\n\nThere is no room for the discussion of Chinese culture is in this paper, but we can at least point out that Yin and Yang could be a key concept to decode the cultural influence in the media system. Chinese ancients believe that all things are composed of yin and yang moving eternally and converting into each other, which is the basic law of the whole universe. The simple dialectical thought of coexistence of yin and yang is one of the basics of traditional Chinese philosophical thought."
