        "text": "Yes. 新年=New Year, while it does not specify whether it's the new year of the Chinese calendar(农历) or the Gregorian calendar(公历).\n\nSo it's ok to say 新年快乐 in both cases. And normally we'll interpret it based on the context. If you wish to be more specific, you can use 元旦 for 公历新年 and 春节 for 农历新年.\n\nEdit:\n\nMy personal opinion about the usage of 快乐 in greetings (as a native speaker myself):\n\nGenerally, 新年快乐 seems more formal to me while 新年好 seems more casual.\n\n新年快乐 is mostly used with other greetings/blessings, starting with 祝(你). eg. 祝你新年快乐，万事如意，心想事成. Thus, it's better used in written language, where you'd use one long sentence to express your best wishes to someone.\n\nBoth can be used when people meet during the Spring Festival, but you'd use multiple short phrases instead of one long sentence in the oral language, so 新年好 probably better suit the case.\n\nUsually Chinese can say \"新年快乐\" and \"新年好\" on both January 1st and Chinese new year(Spring Festival). But \"过年好\" is only used at Chinese new year. Also \"新春快乐\" is used at Chinese new year only,but it is for written or formal occasions.\n\nAt least in northern China,恭喜发财！is not used frequently I guess.Maybe businessman like to say that?I'm not sure.\n\nYes, mainlanders say this. At the very least, my wife says this to other mainlanders and she is from 黑龙江. She seems to vary between 春节快乐 and 新年快乐.\n\nMainland expats at my work have been saying 新年快乐 to me all day too, but I haven't heard a 春节快乐 yet :-)\n\n\"Happy (快乐)\" is not a traditional greeting. I believe that it came to the Chinese language with English greetings such as \"happy new year\" and \"happy birthday\", which the majority of younger people adopted as the standard greeting of virtually all special days.\n\nWhen it comes to the oral noun, \"Spring Festival (春节)\" is definitely said more often than \"new year\", at least in Northern China where I'm from.\n\nNone of the traditional greetings uses the word \"happy (快乐)\". Instead, \"恭喜发财\", \"过年好\", \"新年好\" are dominantly common.\n\nBecause 新年快乐 is such a standard form of saying it, sometimes it may make it feel you don't have the enthusiasm when you say it.\n\nA more cheerful and upbeat form of saying it may be 恭喜发财！(may you be prosperous), or even a form of 恭喜！恭喜！恭喜发财！ for the warmth and enthusiasm.\n\nWhether it is a \"greeting\" specifically might be arguable, but if you watch the CCTV Chinese New Year Gala (\"春晚\", colloquially), you will hear a fairly steady stream of \"新年快乐\"s. It is most definitely a very normal thing for Chinese people in China say to one another.\n\nIf you are looking for a greeting specifically, some of the things rwei suggested like \"新年好\" might be more common, but that might also depend on regional differences. Keep in mind that \"China\" is a very large place and speaking patterns are not always uniform."
