        "text": "A weekly update of press freedom and censorship news related to the People's Republic of China\n\nIssue No. 44: January 26, 2012\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n* State broadcaster’s investigative journalism questioned\n\n* Writers receive long prison terms during holiday season\n\n* Microblog real-name registration to expand nationwide\n\n* Taiwan elections stir envy, irony in Chinese blogosphere\n\n* Leaked ’07 cable shows pressure on NASDAQ to bar NTDTV\n\nPrintable version\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBROADCAST/PRINT MEDIA NEWS\n\nState TV's New Year show loses fans amid censorship\n\nThe annual Spring Festival Gala, a four-hour variety program of dance, song, magic, and comedy that one Shanghai film critic called the “most censored show on Chinese television,” was aired on January 22, Lunar New Year’s Eve, on China Central Television (CCTV). The show has been part of many Chinese families’ New Year traditions since its inception in 1983, but it has declined in popularity in recent years. The latest gala was marred by claims of censorship and top Chinese entertainers’ refusal to participate. Actor Zhao Benshan was absent despite being invited to appear for the past 21 years, with observers speculating that his skit had failed to pass the three-round approval process. Comedian Jiang Kun was also off the program, possibly because his script mentioned a deadly 2011 train crash in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, that had sparked public outrage. Popular female comic Song Dandan said she would not participate “unless they arrest me.” Instead, several entertainers appeared on a rival show that aired a few days earlier on Hunan’s provincial television network, which is popular nationwide and less rigorously controlled than CCTV. In an apparent attempt to boost viewership of its gala, CCTV turned to a “most beautiful family photo” contest, aired the program with no advertisements, and included a video of American billionaire Warren Buffett singing and playing the ukulele. CCTV has claimed that the gala is watched by 90 percent of the Chinese population, but state-run Xinhua news agency and other media outlets reported that in various online polls, between 48 and 70 percent of respondents expressed disappointment in the quality of the 2012 gala.\n\n* Los Angeles Times 1/20/2012: Must-see Chinese TV becoming a snooze\n\n* Global Times 1/12/2012: CCTV's 2012 spring festival gala\n\n* Christian Science Monitor 1/22/2012: Warren Buffett sings in the Chinese New Year\n\n* Xinhua 1/24/2012: Spring festival TV gala gets mixed opinions\n\n* Chariweb 1/23/2012: CCTV's spring festival gala losing viewers\n\n*******************\n\nWriters receive long prison terms during holiday season\n\nSeveral detained writers and online dissidents received severe prison sentences or formal indictments during the holiday season, when foreign and public scrutiny was at an ebb. Beijing-based rights lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan said it was the “right time” for the Chinese Communist Party to act, as the country is scheduled to carry out a leadership transition in the second half of the year.\n\n- Chen Wei, a cyberdissident based in Sichuan, was sentenced on December 23 to nine years in prison and two years’ post-release deprivation of political rights by the provincial court. Convicted of “inciting subversion of state power,” Chen had been detained in February 2011 for a series of political essays that he posted on overseas websites between March 2009 and January 2011.\n\n- Chen Youcai, a Guizhou-based writer who uses the pen name Chen Xi, was sentenced on December 26 to 10 years in prison and three years’ post-release deprivation of political rights by a court in Guiyang. He was detained on November 29 for “inciting subversion,” having published 36 articles online that criticized the Chinese government and campaigned for independent candidates during local People’s Congress elections.\n\n- Li Tie, a Hubei-based writer, was sentenced by a Wuhan court on January 18 to 10 years in prison for “subverting state power.” Li had been detained in September 2010 and tried in April 2011, after he wrote and published online articles that were critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n- Zhu Yufu, a Zhejiang-based writer who was arrested in April 2011, is set to stand trial on subversion charges, having written and published online a poem entitled “It’s Time,” in which he alluded to the Arab Spring and called for Chinese people to defend their rights. According to Zhu’s lawyer, the Hangzhou authorities finally issued an indictment on January 16."
