        "text": "The book mainly highlights some historical, cultural and practical backgrounds of Albanian-Udi Christians, Doukhobour, the Molokan faith, Lutheran Church of Savior and Jews in Azerbaijan. These communities have century old history and played integral role to shape cultural and religious diversity of the country. Also, most of them-Doukhobors, Molokans, Lutherans and Jews (mountain Jewish) have common fate such as they expelled from [ different lands] or persecuted [in different lands] during in different periods. They resettled in the territory of Azerbaijan, lived in safe and peace so far. These communities contributed to the economy, developed agriculture and enriched cultural environment of our country. Azerbaijani government always protect their legacy and support their activities\n\nThe article examines a series of political changes that recently affected the levels of religiosity in Azerbaijan. Since 2009 the Azerbaijani leadership has adopted a set of laws and policy regulations designed to restrain Islamism and Islamic activism. In spite of heavy-handed state control and legal restrictions, there has been a visible increase of religiosity within Azerbaijani society, particularly amongst religious organisations and parties. The article aims to decode the underlying reasons behind the persistent upsurge of religiosity in Azerbaijan and further our understanding of the social–political implications of this trend. The article also argues that, since restrictions were imposed on religious expression in 2009, the revival of Islam in Azerbaijan has become much more visible while serving as an alternative avenue for the emergence of social movements within the country.\n\nBy the time Azerbaijan became independent in 1991, it had spent seven decades subsumed into the militant atheism of the Soviet modernization project. Moreover, it emerged into the staunchly secular international context of Western modernity. These two factors combined with the tough reality of the country’s precarious geography to promise a sustained indigenous effort to desacralize the country’s political space and exclude religion from politics, a blueprint common to the modern world and one which Azerbaijani state and society have united to pursue over the course of the country’s independent existence. Yet the specific dynamics facing the country in the third decade of independence and the changing contours of its international engagements have been working to loosen up the latter formula, laying the groundwork for a quintessentially Azerbaijani pathway of statehood that will combine the nation’s historical embeddedness in an Islamic milieu with its century-old practical experience of modern policymaking.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 and the appearance of new independent states in its place resulted in dramatic changes in geopolitics. Because of its strategic importance, Azerbaijan emerged as one of the new spheres of the world community's interests. Moreover, the historical legacy of Azerbaijan as a part of the Great Silk Road as well as a meeting point of western and eastern cultures makes it a very attractive object of research. Finally, the essentially moderate Islamic framework in Azerbaijan and its unique character as the only country throughout the post-Soviet space in which a major part of the population belong to Shi'a Islam distinguish it from other Muslim republics of the former USSR. The main focus of investigation of this book is the way in which interaction between Islam, state and society took place in Azerbaijan in the unique historical-cultural and socio-political contexts."
