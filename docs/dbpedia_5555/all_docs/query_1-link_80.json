This work will be completed in late May, he said.\n\n\"There is a serious problem in connection with the listing of displaced people who settled throughout the territory. One fails to ensure their active or passive voting even at the municipal elections. Unfortunately, observers and relevant organizations do not pay great attention to this issue,\" the CEC secretary said.\n\nAs a result of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories by Armenia, about 1 million of Azerbaijanis were displaced.\n\nThe parliamentary elections will be held in Azerbaijan in autumn this year. Earlier the legislative elections were held in November 2005. In Azerbaijan, the parliamentary elections are held by the majority system in 125 electoral districts.\n\nDepartment head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration ambiguously appreciates the OSCE proposals on the parliamentary elections.\n\n\"There is a different practice in this area in the world. Of course, I can not clearly evaluate these proposals. The OSCE gives us these proposals. As we know, the format of the current electoral commission was created based on the requirements of the organization,\" Legislation and Legal Expertise Department head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration Shahin Aliyev told journalists.\n\nThe OSCE has proposed the formation of electoral commissions with participation of neutral parties.\n\nSerious work was conducted with the OSCE on the issue of format of electoral commissions, Aliyev said.\n\n\"I am surprised that the issue was raised again by the OSCE to the government of Azerbaijan. A new mechanism of formation of election commissions was prepared together with the International Foundation for Election Systems in 2002. According to this mechanism, the electoral commissions should have been formed from representatives of nongovernmental organizations. The government agreed to it in 2002, but unfortunately the OSCE has not adopted the principle of formation of election commissions \", Aliyev said.\n\nThe government supports the professional holding of the election process in accordance with the Electoral Code.\n\n\"Why is it necessary to change the format of the electoral commissions? This decision must be made only through careful analysis. What will we achieve in the upcoming elections, if we change the format of election commissions?\" Aliyev said.\n\nOSCE Baku Office Head Ali Bilge Cankorel has discussed the upcoming parliamentary elections at the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration.\n\nCankorel has today met with Azerbaijani Presidential Administration Head Ramiz Mehdiyev, the office reported.\n\nThe main topics of the discussion were the OSCE Baku Office's activities and the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan. The meeting was also attended by Directors of the Presidential Administration's Departments Novruz Mammadov, Shahin Aliyev and Ali Hasanov, the report said.\n\nThe parliamentary election in Azerbaijan is scheduled for November.\n\nNo elections may be hold in the Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission by the Azerbaijani government and the Azerbaijani Central Election Comsssion, Legislation and Legal Expertise Department head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration Shahin Aliyev told journalists today.\n\n\"The Nagorno-Karabakh can not hold any election, as no country recognizes the Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent part. It is an Azerbaijan's territory,\" Aliyev said.\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh's Separatist regime will hold parliamentary elections May 23.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry has expressed its protest against this parliamentary election.\n\nAzerbaijan will declare all international observers in the so-called \"parliament elections\" in the Nagorno-Karabakh persona non grata.\n\n\"The so-called \"parliament elections\" to be held by the separatist regime of the Nagorno-Karabakh are illegal and all international observers wishing to observe the course of these \"elections\" will be declared persona non grata. The Nagorno-Karabakh is Azerbaijan's land and anyone, who visited the area without Azerbaijan's permission, is declared persona non grata, and later he can not visit Azerbaijan,\" Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Elkhan Polukhov told Trend today.\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh's Separatist regime will hold parliamentary elections May 23.\n\nThe Armenian media reported that the former OSCE Special Representative for South Caucasus and present representative of the Paris office of the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation, Maurice Bono will observe the \"elections\".\n\nThe Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry earlier made a statement on so-called \"parliament elections\" in the Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n\"Any kind of elections in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan may be recognized as fair and free once the expelled Azerbaijani population takes full, direct and equal part in their conduct in lawful and democratic environment equally to the Armenian population of the region. Holding such elections will be possible after the withdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces, normalization of life in the region, creation of necessary conditions for restoration of the dialogue and cooperation between the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities of Nagorno-Karabakh,\" the statement says.\n\n\"Conduct of such \"elections\" gravely violates the relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the norms and principles of international law, since they are held in absence of the original Azerbaijani population of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and, therefore shall have no legal effect whatsoever,\" the ministry reported.\n\n\"If any individual is going to monitor the \"parliamentary election\" in the Nagorno-Karabakh - it is his/her right, but the fact that the former EU Special Representative for South Caucasus, a person once endowed with quite a lot of power, who was supposed to deal with the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the stabilization of situation in the South Caucasus, causes surprising and doubt that he was ever objective while occupying this post,\" Azerbaijani political scientist Fikret Sadikhov said.\n\nThat's why for so many years we are fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, namely diplomats such as Bono and others like he, took a one-sided position and supported separatism in Azerbaijan and were not interested in resolving the conflict and deoccupation of the Azerbaijani territories, he said.\n\n\"In fact, it is a real reflection of the reality, which Azerbaijan faced for many years, trying to solve this prolonged conflict situation\", Sadikhov said.\n\nOSCE supports Azerbaijan's efforts aimed at improving the electoral environment, OSCE Baku Office Head Ali Bilge Cankorel said at the event on preparations to the forthcoming parliamentary elections organized by the OSCE Baku office.\n\nThe parliamentary elections will be held in Azerbaijan in autumn 2010. The last legislative elections were held in November 2005. In Azerbaijan, the parliamentary elections are held by the majority system in 125 electoral constituencies.\n\nProper conduct of registration of candidates will create favorable conditions for the election of all political parties, Cankorel said.\n\nA professional electoral structure, which will enjoy the confidence of all political forces, should be established for the holding of democratic elections, Head of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights' (ODIHR) Election Department Nicolas Kaczorowski said.\n\n\"Such electoral structure could be created in terms of a constructive dialogue. Given Azerbaijan's commitments to OSCE, this issue is very important,\" he added.\n\nThe event brought together representatives of the ruling and opposition parties of Azerbaijan.\n\nAzerbaijani Central Elections Committee (CEC) today made an official statement regarding the so-called \"parliamentary elections\" in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n\"The Armenians are preparing for the next election game in the occupied territories. The Azerbaijani side expresses its protest to the action which is contrary to international law\", chairman of the Central Election Commission (CEC) Mazahir Panahov said.\n\n\"The international community is aware that the Azerbaijani territory is under occupation. In this regard, there are decisions of international organizations. But for some reason, the decisions of organizations, was formed on the basis of democracy, are not fulfilled. No one doubts that there are concerned people. They have great strength, \" Panahov said.\n\nThe statement says that according to the Azerbaijani Constitution, no person, social group, organization can assign the authority of the government. Elections and referendums are conducted on the basis of the Constitution and the Electoral Code of the Azerbaijani Republic.\n\nThe CEC said that the \"observers\", who intend to monitor the elections under the fictitious regime, should abandon the expression of contempt for international norms. This action will be regarded as a flagrant violation of Azerbaijan's state sovereignty.\n\nThe CEC states that elections and referendums in the occupied territories can be held after Azerbaijan's territorial integrity is restored and people living there return to their place of residence. \"The CEC considers the holding of such\" elections\" illegitimate. They are inconsistent with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. The CEC does not recognize them and calls for the international community to this issue,\" a statement said.\n\nSeparatist regime of Nagorno-Karabakh will hold the \"parliamentary elections\" May 23.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry expressed a formal protest in connection with the \"elections\" in Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n\"The holding of such elections is a flagrant violation of relevant provisions of the Azerbaijani Constitution and the norms and principles of international law, as they are conducted without indigenous Azerbaijani population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Thus they do not have any legal force,\" the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry said.\n\n\"The elections conducted in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan can be considered free and fair only if Azerbaijani expelled population returns to the region and participates in the elections on the legal and democratic basis on equal terms with the Armenian population,\" the document said.\n\nParliament\n\nAzerbaijani Milli Mejlis MP Ganira Pashayeva will pay a visit to China to attend the Global Summit of Women May 17-23, Azerbaijani Parliament said.\n\nThe summit to be held in Beijing will be attended by about 1,000 women.

Pashayeva will bring to their attention about the occupation of Azerbaijani territories by Armenia, as a result of which thousands of women were expelled from their native lands and captured.\n\nAzerbaijani MP Asim Mollazade will visit Moscow to attend an international scientific conference on 'South Caucasus socioeconomic development: Prospects and Problems' to be held May 20, the parliamentary press service told Trend.\n\n\"The conference will mainly focus on the situation in the South Caucasus, the socio-economic status, issues that hinder cooperation and etc,\" the source reported.\n\nMollazade will speak about Azerbaijan's role in the region's lasting development.\n\nThe event will also organize a news conference on 'The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on the backdrop of the Turkish-Armenian process: Azerbaijan's view'.\n\nThe visit will be completed May 21.\n\nAzerbaijani Opposition Party decided to nominate ten more candidates.\n\n\"Members of the party Adil Musayev will nominate a candidate in the Forty Eighth District in Yevlakh, Ilgar Ismayilov will nominate a candidate in the Twenty Third District, Kamal Huseynov will nominate a candidate in the Eighth District of the First Binagadi Area,\" the Azerbaijani Democratic Party (ADP) told Trend.\n\nParliamentary elections will be held in Azerbaijan in autumn this year.

The resolution that recognized Armenia as an aggressor will become a reference point in the discussion of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict at the Islamic countries' upcoming summit to be held in Cairo in March 2011, Azerbaijani Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Permanent Representative to the OIC Tofig Abdullayev told Trend.\n\nThe OIC Foreign Ministerial Council, which will continue three days, opened in Dushanbe on Tuesday with the participation of 80 delegations of the OIC member-states, delegations of the observer countries, and international and regional organizations.\n\nThe session mainly focuses on the issues regarding the escalation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and transformation of the Middle East into a nuclear-free zone, as well as the situation in Iraq and Somalia\n\n\"Substantial changes were made to the first resolution that adopted annually.

According to the Nabucco Gas Pipeline Int., gas demand in EU countries will reach 617 billion cubic meters in 2012and 656 billion - in 2015.\n\nThe presence of \"frozen conflicts\" is an obstacle to economic and social development. The resolution says Europe faced a complex geopolitical situation in its dealings with this region, with conflicts in the Nagorno-Karabakh area and Georgia, as well as tensions between Armenia and Turkey.\n\nThe situation of conflict in the region is neither acceptable nor viable, say MEPs, who express concern at the recent increases in military spending and call for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan.\n\nKirilov said the EU \"hasn't been active enough so far\" and \"it should contribute to a much bigger presence of the EU in the region\". He said the eruption of the Russia-Georgia conflict in the summer of 2008 had made it imperative for the EU to involve itself more actively in the region.\n\nAhead of local elections in Georgia to be held on 30 May, MEPs also insist that measures be taken to ensure that international electoral standards are respected. The EP's Foreign Affairs Committee will send an ad-hoc delegation of seven MEPs to observe these elections.\n\nEstablishment of Heydar Aliyev Center was offered in Turkey.\n\nPresentation of the book \"Heydar Aliyev and national policy in Azerbaijan\" by Hidayat Orujov in the Turkish was held May 18.

AYOR is today the most active Azerbaijani youth organization outside Azerbaijan. The number of our participants has considerably increased in a year, and I believe the same is with our like-minded people.\"\n\n\"Over a year we've organized a large number of events, including meetings and campaigns not only in Moscow and Baku, but also in Saint Petersburg, Tver, Ivanovo, Smolensk, Murmansk and Yekaterinburg.\"\n\n\"Since the first day of our founding we've been doing everything so that our activity covers a wide range of spheres. Among our key priorities are building inter-cultural dialogue, promoting Azerbaijan's rich cultural and historical legacy, making Azerbaijan's truths known to the Russian community, as well as developing humanitarian, social, scientific and educational cooperation; and, of course, taking care of our citizens, students and youth living and studying in the Russian Federation.\"\n\nMrs. Aliyeva said: \"One of our critical projects has been the international Justice for Khojaly campaign which we`ve implemented jointly with the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. The project has featured 70 campaigns in different parts of the world. The goal of the campaign is making the truth about the February events of 1992 known to people on all the continents around the world. Khojaly is our pain, and it is very important that the whole world community hears about this tragedy, and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, in general. And we`ll continue moving forward on this path unless this conflict finds its just solution and Azerbaijan`s territorial integrity is restored.\"\n\nMrs. Aliyeva also touched upon the cultural, humanitarian and social cooperation between Azerbaijan and Russia.\n\n\"We've been arranging days and weeks of the Azerbaijani culture, which featured concerts, photo exhibitions and demonstration of films. And we'll continue our efforts in order to promote Azerbaijan's rich culture.\"\n\n\"Great job has been done in the humanitarian and social spheres as well. This featured helping those in need, in particular, children in orphanages and hospitals. I want to emphasize the \"Blood has no Nation\" blood donation campaign. It means that youth both in Azerbaijan and Russia have common values. We also initiated an anti-alcohol and -tobacco campaign.\"\n\nMrs. Aliyeva also highlighted the organization's achievements in the field of sport.\n\n\"Since 2009 we've been organizing a mini-football tournament in Moscow which involves 16 teams of Azeri students studying in Russian higher educational institutions. This year the number of teams increased to 24, which demonstrates that youth are very interested in sports,\" she said.\n\nPolitical movements\n\nThe main purpose of some opposition parties is violation of public order in the country, Deputy Executive Secretary of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party Siyavush Novruzov believes.\n\n\"Due to lack of social base, the opposition is interested in conducting mass rallies in forbidden places,\" Novruzov told Trend.\n\nAzadliq bloc, Musavat Party and Umid attempted to hold mass protests in May.\n\nDue to lack of social base, the opposition tries to conduct mass rallies in the center of Baku, resort areas and near the shopping centers, Novruzov said.\n\n\"By such actions, they once again demonstrate their weakness. If they had a social base, they would be interested to hold actions in the places permitted by Baku he Executive Power,\" he added.\n\nAccording to him, the opposition advantageously holds rallies in forbidden places.\n\n\"They receive financial aid from other countries. By holding rallies in the forbidden places, they are trying to gain favor with their investors. I think that these attempts are unsuccessful, the opposition will not achieve anything by holding rallies,\" Novruzov said.\n\nAttempts made by some political organizations to hold mass actions to change the current situation will not have any result, chairman of the Azerbaijani opposition party said.\n\n\"If the opposition wants to achieve some success in the parliamentary elections, it must elect a different tactic,\" chairman of the Azerbaijani Democratic Party Sardar Jalaloglu told Trend.\n\nAzadliq bloc, Musavat Party and Umid attempted to hold mass protests in May.\n\nHe said that the issue of the mass rallies must be secondary for the opposition.\n\n\"We must strive for unity of opposition forces. Unfortunately, we failed to achieve any progress in this direction. We can restore public confidence in the opposition only via solidarity, the party chairman said.\n\nHe said that he does not intend to speak more with such an initiative.\n\n\"Once again I was convinced that our opposition has not fully learnt democratic values. Renewal of joint initiatives is senseless\", he said.\n\nThe process to define candidates for parliamentary elections was completed, said the head of the party represented in the opposition bloc of Azerbaijan.\n\n\"Completed lists will be presented to the joint discussion of party leaders, and together we will determine the overall candidates of the bloc,\" chairman of Citizen and Development Party (CDP), represented in Azadlyg bloc, Ali Aliyev told Trend on May 17.\n\nAccording to Aliyev, his party named 40 candidates in the list.\n\n\"During the discussions, party chairmen will determine what candidates are more appropriate. After joint discussions, we will also define the district, where candidates will nominate,\" said the chairman of the party.\n\nRegarding the date to start this process, Aliyev said that currently they are discussing the results of the May 16 mass actions. \"There are detainees during the protest. I think that compiling a single list of parties will be completed by the end of this month,\" he said.\n\nThe date of the next action has not been specified, the chairman of CDP said. \"The meeting of the working group on the actions will be held soon and will determine the date of the next actions,\" said Aliyev.\n\nNational Independence Party of Azerbaijan (NIPA) leader Etibar Mammadov congratulated UK Conservative Party head David Cameron on his victory in the parliamentary elections.\n\n\"The NIPA congratulates the Conservative Party and you on the occasion of your victory in the UK parliamentary elections and wishes staunchness to the new government,\" the party wrote in the message.\n\n\"A long and fruitful cooperation brings together our parties in the International Democratic Union,\" Mammadov said. \"We have always learned from the practice of your party in the development of the NIPA as the best European standards and I look forward to the even more widespread development of our relations,\" the message continued.\n\nThe NIPA was established in 1992. It was the first party in Azerbaijan to pass state registration. After the resignation of Chairman Etibar Mammadov in late 2004, the party split.\n\nDeputy chairman of Azerbaijani ruling party explained the reasons for the reluctance of the opposition to hold mass rallies in suitable places.\n\n\"Their goal is not a meeting with his supporters. According to our observations, they are trying to escalate tension,\" deputy chairman of New Azerbaijan Party, Executive Secretary, MP Ali Akhmadov said.\n\nThe opposition bloc Azadliq, as well as the Musavat Party and Umid planned a mass protest in places unprovided for it. The executive power has not given permission to hold such rallies.\n\n\"The opposition does not want to hold rallies at placed designated for the rallies,\" he said. Thus, they are trying to create visibility of non-compliance of the right to freedom of assembly in the country, he said.\n\nMoreover, the reluctance of the opposition to hold rallies in the places, envisaged by the law is related to the lack of social base.\n\n\"They stand for rallies in the central regions, in crowded places. This approach demonstrates unserious attitude to political processes and other issues,\" he said.\n\nIf opposition parties are willing to hold mass rallies, they can do it at the designated areas.\n\n\"Some of them claim that their supporters can not get to the place of the meeting, which is located just two miles further than the place where they planned to hold the rally. How do they call people from Gazakh to the rally? Are not 400 miles far? This is just excuse,\" he said.\n\nAzerbaijani Opposition Party has determined 78 candidates for MPs.\n\n\"After all the candidates are determined and the official start of the elections is given, we will submit the list for approval by the Supreme Majlis of the party,\" deputy chairman of the Popular Front of United Azerbaijan Elchin Mirzabayli told Trend.\n\nThe parliamentary elections will be held in Azerbaijan in autumn this year. Previous legislative elections were held in November 2005. In Azerbaijan, the parliamentary elections are held by the majority system in 125 electoral constituencies.\n\nMany party members nominate their candidates. But the Popular Front of United Azerbaijan approves only those who actually have a chance to win.\n\nHe said that the possibility of nomination of chairman of the party Gudrat Gasanguliev from the constituency of No 97 Goranboy-Agdam-Tartar.\n\n\"I have not decided on my candidacy for MP yet,\" deputy chairman of the party said.\n\nA group of members of the Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan in 2002 left the organization under the leadership of Gudrat Gasanguliev.\n\nThey conducted a \"unifying\" congress and until 2004 were called \"uniting\" wing of the Popular Front Party.\n\nA meeting of opposition leaders in the new format was conducted in Azerbaijan.\n\n\"Our first meeting with the participation of the leaders of Azerbaijan Popular Front Party, the Classical Popular Front Party and Musavat Party focused on the integration of the opposition and the public-political situation in the country,\" said chairman of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party Sardar Jalaloglu.\n\nAccording to Jalaloglu, despite the discussion of joint activities of the four parties in the parliamentary elections, no concrete decisions were made.\n\n\"We will continue discussions. I hope that we will come to a common denominator for the integration of the opposition to cooperate during the election campaign by the official launching of the election,\" said Jalaloglu.\n\nOpposition leaders first began discussions in this format, said the chairman of the Classic Popular Front Party Mahmud Miralioglu.\n\n\"There were initial consultations. All the issues on the agenda were discussed, including issues of participation in the elections with a single list. Still it is unknown how the results will be,\" said Miralioglu.\n\nThe proposal to hold a meeting in this format was made by Sardar Jalaloglu, Miralioglu said.\n\nToday the headquarters of Musavat hosted a meeting of head of Musavat Party Isa Gambar, chairman of Azerbaijan Popular Front Party Ali Kerimli, chairman of Azerbaijan Democratic Party Sardar Jalaloglu and chairman of Classic Popular Front Party Mahmud Miralioglu.\n\nTwo opposition parties in Azerbaijan have identified their candidates for two vacant seats in the Central Election Commission (CEC).\n\n\"Our party submitted to the Parliament the candidate for member of the CEC. The candidate is the chairman of the party's supreme assembly Mikail Rahimov,\" Elchin Mirzabeyli, deputy chairman of Unified Azerbaijan Popular Front Party. \"Our candidate for membership in the CEC is Ibrahim Mammadov,\" the chairman of Great Establishment Party, MP Fazil Mustafa said on May 19.\n\nAccording to him, prior to the official launching of the parliamentary elections, candidates for two vacant seats in the CEC should be appointed.\n\nThe subjective position of opposition leaders prevents establishment of unity, Azerbaijani opposition party head said.\n\n\"Even if the current state of the Azerbaijani opposition excites certain forces, some party leaders, not finding a resolve, do not set aside their subjective thoughts and interests and do not make steps towards a broad consolidation,\" chairman of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party Sardar Jalaloglu told Trend.\n\nJalaloglu said that for this reason the meeting, held May 19 between the leaders of the Musavat party, the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, Classical Popular Front, and him, ended in vain.\n\n\"Despite the support for my initiative, unfortunately, the unity in the limited framework damages cooperation and joint activities with other forces greatly,\" he said.\n\nHe said that they have no difference in opinions on the current situation in Azerbaijan, the government and opposition on issues related to future of the country.\n\n\"For this reason, discussing the outcome of the meeting with his allies, parties will come to a definite decision. It is still unknown when the next meeting will be held,\" Jalaloglu said.\n\nWith regard to clarifying a general list of candidates from four parties, the opportunity to cooperate in the parliamentary election in another form, Jalaloglu said that views were exchanged in this regard at the meeting.\n\n\"A decision was made for each party participating in the meeting to introduce allies, protect their interests.
