        "text": "\"Rustam Orujov, the title-winning judo player of Azerbaijan, commented on the Judo \"Grand Slam\" ranking tournament to be held in Baku on September 22-24.\n\n\"I see Azerbaijan, Japan and Georgia as the favorites of the \"Grand Slam\" to be held in Baku. I expect medals from our judo players in every weight category, because we have a very strong team. Despite the fact that Said Mollai (81 kg) and Turan Bayramov (60 kg) missed the tournament, I think that this will not affect the overall result of the team, because we have substitutes in each weight. There is Balabey Agayev, who is the second in the world ranking in Turan's weight class, and currently he is one of the leaders in his weight class in these competitions, and we also have a strong judo player in the 81 kg weight class. For example, Zelim Tskaev,\" Orucev told the reporter of İdman.biz.\n\nHe also noted that the Baku \"Grand Slam\" tournament was his favorite tournament because it was held \"at home\" and the support of local fans, family and friends was important to him.\n\nShabnam Rahimova"
