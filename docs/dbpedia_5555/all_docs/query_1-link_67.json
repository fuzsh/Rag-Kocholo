        "text": "The present paper focuses on the working environment, which is the core of employment relationship, faced by the migrant unskilled labourers who work in the industrial units of Kerala State. In spite of their vital role in the economic growth of the state, especially the secondary sector, these labourers are put to work in unhealthy working conditions. Often, they are made to work for more than the stipulated time, not paid for the overtime work, not provided with safe work environment. These labourers and their families face health issues due hazardous work and improper medical care. Such labourers are employed as temporary workers with no other benefits and discriminated during the routine work and at the time of payment of wages. The alarming fact is that majority of them are not there in any of the official records of the city. Though dissatisfied with the workplace, they prefer to stay in the state itself as work opportunities are more as compared to their native places. There ...\n\nIn India there exist huge disparities across Indian states in the level of industrial development in particular and economic development in general. This has created a huge market for employment opportunities in developed states while many states are still struggling to create employment opportunities. This has led to movement of labour across Indian states from some under developed states to developed states like Punjab.. Since the green revolution which started in the state pf Punjab the state of Punjab has witnessed huge inflow of migratory labour from less developed states like Bihar/Uttar Pradesh etc. The state of Punjab has also seen significant growth in manufacturing industries since eighties and it has also generated huge demand for industrial labour which incidentally could not be fulfilled by local Punjab population. .Accordingly the state of Punjab has witnessed a large influx of migratory labour in manufacturing industries .The present paper examines the Pull factors responsible for growth of migratory labour over a period of time in manufacturing industries. Primary survey was conducted on 500 migratory labours working in manufacturing industries to identify only Pull factors associated with migration from underdeveloped states to Punjab. The technique of factor analysis is used to identify factors. The study will go a long way in devising policies for further strengthening the identified factors so that the state of Punjab is able to attract better migrantâ€™s migrant workers. This will go a long way in improving the efficiency and growth of manufacturing industries in the state.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to examine the economic condition of the migrant workers in Kerala. We have analysed the income, consumption and savings pattern and nature of work of the migrant workers in the Trivandrum district, based on data from a sample of 166 migrant workers. While existing studies provide evidences for short distance migration to Kerala from nearby states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, our study provide evidences for long distance migration from states like West Bengal and Assam in recent years. We observe that informal information networks through migrant workers plays important role in migration of workers to Kerala. Poor economic conditions in the native place and high wage rate and better employment opportunities in Kerala, along with several other overlapping factors have been identified as the main reasons of migration to Kerala. Though there is barely any change in the nature of employment of the migrants even after migration, there has been a shift from the low-income brackets before migration to high-income brackets after migration. Notwithstanding the improved income level the living condition for most of them is deplorable, most of them live together in either poor rented houses or work sites with one room shared by many, without proper provision of hygienic sanitation.\n\nMigration of labour is a common feature all over the world. In India too it is prevalent significantly in all the states and particularly Mahabubnagar district of Telangana is known for its migration of labour as district is backward and declared as drought prone district by the World Bank .The present paper deals with a sample of 200 labours who have migrated from the district to other places in Search of Productive work. The analysis reveal that sample respondents have got continuous work for more than 20 days in a month and experienced an increase in monthly income and consumption expenditure after their migration.\n\nIn recent years Kerala has been experiencing a large influx of migrant workers from different parts of India. Higher wages, large employment opportunities and shortages of local labourers make Kerala a lucrative job market for workers from outside the State. The purpose of this paper is to examine the characteristics and economic condition of the migrant workers in Kerala. Based on data from a sample survey of 166 migrant workers, carried out during September-October, 2008 in the Trivandrum district of Kerala, this paper analyses the migrantâ€™s demographic and household details, reasons for migration, sources of information, living conditions, occupational pattern, wage and income, consumption and savings, and remittances, etc.\n\nKerala is witnessing large inflow of migrant labour from different parts of the country in recent years. Though labourers from states as far as Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa now flock to Kerala, those from the neighbouring state of Tamilnadu out number others by a big margin. Higher wages for unskilled labour in the state, large opportunities for employment and shortage of local labour, paradoxically despite the high unemployment rate in the state, led to the massive influx of migrant labour to the state. Poor economic conditions in the native place and high wage rate and better employment opportunities been identified as the main reasons of migration to Kerala. Notwithstanding the improved income level the living condition for most migrant workers is deplorable, most of them live together in either poor rented houses or work sites with one room shared by many, without proper provision of hygienic sanitation. This paper explores the socio-economic conditi...\n\nThe paper discusses the working and living conditions of long-distance migrants in Kerala and focusses on the implications of this recent trend of migration for the State. It is observed that there exists a labour divide between the migrants and the native Malayali workers. The migrants have different systems of accessing work compared to the Malayali workers and they often face exploitation at the hands of the agents/contractors/employers. The migrants face exclusion and alienation not just in their work place but also at their places of residence. Despite the valuable contributions of the migrants for Kerala's economy, they are often forced to live in inhuman conditions and are blamed for everything wrong in the society."
