We also informed them about what is happening in Georgia in terms of protecting the rights of national minorities,” Yakobashvili said.\n\nThe official noted that the meeting touched several complex issues.\n\n“We spoke in detail about what the state thinks about these issues and explained that frequent provocations do not originate in Azerbaijan and Georgia and elsewhere,” Yakobashvili added. “We agreed that we will try to solve this problem jointly, and not allow provocations to destroy the relations between our countries.”\n\nThe minister emphasized that all citizens should be able to receive a full education in Tbilisi."
