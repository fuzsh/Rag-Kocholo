        "text": "The focus might be on the upcoming Olympic Games and the possible champions of 2024, but what of those who have come before? Team Azerbaijan are coming to Paris with a strong set up, one being Hidayat HEYDAROV in the -73kg category. In this past cycle, he has been coached and supported by one of Azerbaijan’s most decorated judoka; Elnur MAMMADLI, who claimed the 2008 Olympic title in Beijing in the same category.\n\nWinning in the Olympic Games holds its own beauty, and observing the Games from the stands carries a different beauty. Watching Azerbaijani judoka in the Olympic Games adds an extra layer of responsibility. When you’re on the mat, you feel a singular responsibility, but the weight of responsibility intensifies when you’re watching the athletes of the national team compete.\n\nThe biggest dream of every athlete is to become an Olympic Champion, and I became one of these athletes. I experienced very challenging yet honorable paths to reach the pinnacle of this Olympic event. The Korean athlete was someone I greatly respected. Before our final meeting, we had crossed paths at the World Championship in Rio de Janeiro in 2007, where I suffered defeat and secured the second position. However, I motivated myself, vowing to achieve victory in the Olympic Games.\n\nFate had it that we both reached the final, and I reminded myself that this wasn’t the World Championships, an annual event, but the Olympic Games, held every four years. I couldn’t miss this opportunity, so I prepared extensively. As you can see, the match didn’t last long – only 9 seconds – and I won with the ippon. It’s an indescribable feeling.\n\nSince this great accomplishment, Team Azerbaijan have been awaiting a gold medal in the Olympic Games, with some close calls from the likes of Rustam ORUJOV, they’re hoping 2024 will change the tides.\n\nAs you know, judo in Azerbaijan lacked an Olympic Champion medal for many years. In 1992, Nazim HUSEYNOV became an Olympic Champion, marking Azerbaijan’s first medal of this kind. After 16 years, I followed suit. It’s not by chance that 16 years have passed from 2008 to 2024 without another Azerbaijani Olympic champion. I firmly believe that Azerbaijan will produce future Olympic Champions in judo.\n\nMammadli didn’t become a national coach, instead he now holds the title of Vice President for the federation, but he has the most valuable experience and expertise to advise a future champion, which is what he has been doing with Heydarov. We have seen a transformation in this athlete, already a great talent, but to take on such a winning streak is incredible, and to take the European and World title in the run up to the Olympic Games is sensational.\n\nMy motivation stems from having traversed these paths myself, understanding the intricacies of this journey. Having reached the pinnacle of the Olympic Games, I want my athletes to benefit from my knowledge – the paths I’ve trodden, the secrets, and all the nuances. Azerbaijani athletes achieving Olympic Champion and medallist status are our great wealth. Of course, when Hidayat and our other athletes become Olympic Champions, the key factor is a person’s patriotism. If someone loves their country and their state, they naturally wish for the athletes following them to become European, World, and Olympic Champions.\n\nWith the trust of our federation’s leadership, I remain connected to judo, imparting my knowledge to athletes, attending competitions, and supporting them. When our athletes fight on the tatami, I mentally fight alongside them from the stands, envisioning my return to sports. In my mind, my psychological state is that I am not distant from sports; I am still immersed in it. The essence of sports is that I am one with them – I consider myself judoka alongside them, celebrating each victory as my own and feeling their defeat as my own.\n\nThis final preparation is critical, so what is the mindset as the athletes enter the village and prepare in their final days?\n\nOf course, everyone wishes for you to become an Olympic champion. It’s a word everyone utters. However, a professional approach is crucial. It’s advisable to distance yourself from the crowd as much as possible. When you’re surrounded by everyone, you’ll hear that word repeatedly. But it’s essential to try to stand apart a little, with fewer people in your sight. On that specific day, after 4-8 years of sports training and achievements, you should be in peak condition. By listening to the advice of wise individuals and heeding your coaches, you’ll ascend to conquer that peak.\n\nMammadli won in tremendous fashion, a nine-second gold medal contest to put him in the history books, what does he remember of that fateful day?\n\nAfter winning the gold medal, the most significant change for me was seeing President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Mr. Ilham Aliyev, on TV. I always had this childhood dream of seeing him up close. As the Olympic Champion, my dream came true. From our first meeting, our head of state, along with Mehriban ALIYEVA and our First Vice President, attended every match of mine, turning each encounter in to a celebration. It was a double joy for me – becoming an Olympic Champion and receiving a flower from the head of the country. Every Azerbaijani feels immense happiness when the country’s leader makes such a gesture.\n\nThere was also an emotional element to this,\n\nThe greatest happiness, however, was when the First Vice President of the Republic of Azerbaijan personally called my mother to convey kind words about me, stating that her son is a hero. Making my parents proud is, in my view, the greatest joy for any child. Upon returning to Azerbaijan from the Olympic Games, it was the head of the country who said, ‘You will return to Azerbaijan with my private plane and alongside me.’ This moment marked a significant chapter in my life, a story I’ve been sharing for 16 years and will continue to recount to my grandchildren. In essence, I believe there is no greater happiness in my life, and nothing compares to this extraordinary experience.\n\nAuthor: Thea Cowen"
