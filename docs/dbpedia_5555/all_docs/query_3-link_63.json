        "text": "The constitution provides for religious freedom; however, other laws and policies restrict religious freedom.\n\nUnder the constitution, persons have the right to choose and change religious affiliation and beliefs (including atheism), to join or establish the religious group of their choice, and to practice religion.\n\nThe law on religious freedom expressly prohibits the government from interfering in the religious activities of any individual or group; however, there are exceptions. The law regulates cases in which religious organizations may be liquidated, including acting contrary to the objectives upon which the organization was established; causing racial, national, religious, or social animosity; and propagating a faith that degrades human dignity or contradicts the principles of humanism. Other grounds for liquidation include hindering secular education and inciting members of a religious organization and other individuals to give over their property to the religious organization. The law also provides that no one shall be forced to express or demonstrate his or her religious faith or belief.\n\nA number of legal provisions enable the government to regulate religious groups, including a requirement in the law on religious freedom that religious organizations, including individual congregations of a denomination, be registered by the government. Registration enables a religious organization to maintain a bank account, rent property, and generally act as a legal entity.\n\nThe SCWRA, in particular its chairperson, has broad powers over registration and may also appeal to the courts to suspend a religious group’s activities. It also controls the publication, import, and distribution of religious literature. All religious literature must be reviewed and approved by the SCWRA for legal sale and distribution.\n\nLocal officials hold considerable power in the enforcement and interpretation of laws, and some of the reported restrictions were from areas outside the capital city.\n\nThe registration process appears to serve as a point of leverage for the government to use against religious groups it deems undesirable. The groups most susceptible to government scrutiny are typically lesser-known religious groups, some of which are Muslim. Organizations operating without official registration continued to be vulnerable to government harassment, including fines for administrative violations and court cases demanding their closure. As a result, these groups found it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to function. Groups that were denied registration sat in a legal gray area; they could not congregate legally and could be subjected to harassment by law enforcement officials.\n\nReligious groups are permitted to appeal registration denials to the courts. Under the law on religious freedom, the authorities may deny registering a religious community if the activities of a religious community, its goals, or the essence of the religion contradict the constitution and other laws. The law also specifies a community can be denied registration if it is not recognized as a religious association, its charter and other establishment documents contradict the legislation, or the information is false.\n\nRegistered Muslim organizations are subordinate to the Caucasus Muslim Board (CMB), a Soviet-era muftiate that appoints Muslim clerics to mosques, administers Islamic education institutions, periodically monitors sermons, and organizes annual pilgrimages to Mecca. Muslim religious groups must receive a letter of approval from the CMB before they can be registered by the SCWRA. The CMB has the authority to appoint religious clerics leading Islamic worship institutions, while informing the relevant executive power.\n\nOn July 10 the Milli Majlis (parliament) adopted 19 amendments into the law on religious freedom. New amendments strengthened the position of the CMB by requiring all Islamic organizations to report to the CMB. Amendments also raised the required number of members from 10 to 50 for any group to be able to apply for registration.\n\nOn December 12 and 13 the president signed amendments into the Criminal Code and Administrative Code of Violations, respectively, which enacted stricter punishments for the illegal production, distribution, and importation of religious literature (literature not approved by the SCWRA). Under the amended law, punishment can include fines ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 manat ($6,329 to $8,860) or up to two years’ imprisonment for first offenses, and from 7,000 to 9,000 manat ($8,860 to $11,392) or imprisonment between two and five years for subsequent offenses.\n\nThe law on religious freedom prohibits religious proselytizing by foreigners, although it does not prohibit citizens from doing so. The law also states Islamic religious rituals and ceremonies shall only be conducted by citizens who received their education in the country, or whose religious education abroad was approved by the government. Foreigners affiliated with other religions, however, are free to perform rituals and ceremonies, as long as they are registered with the government.\n\nReligious instruction is not mandatory, and there is no religious curriculum at privately funded or public elementary and high schools. Students can pursue religious courses at higher educational institutions. The CMB sponsors some religious training abroad. Those wishing to participate in state-supported training abroad for religious studies must obtain permission from, or register with, the SCWRA or the Ministry of Education. Otherwise, religious education abroad does not require the preliminary permission of authorities.\n\nBy law, political parties cannot engage in religious activity. Religious leaders may not simultaneously serve in public office and in positions of religious leadership, although this stipulation does not limit the right of a public official to worship. Religious facilities may not be used for political purposes.\n\nThe constitution provides for alternative service when military service conflicts with one’s beliefs but requires implementing legislation. No such law has been enacted to implement alternative service and refusal to perform military service in peacetime is punishable under the Criminal Code.\n\nHead coverings are allowed in most public places but may not be worn in official photographs.\n\nThe government observes the following religious holidays as national holidays: Gurban Bayram (Eid al-Adha) and Ramazan (Ramadan).\n\nThere were reports of abuses of religious freedom, including religious prisoners and detainees. The government also raided religious communities and confiscated religious literature. The government often targeted religious groups it considers “nontraditional” religions, including Jehovah’s Witnesses and unsanctioned Muslim religious organizations, which the government claims politicize Islam. In practice, some groups were vulnerable to government raids for worshiping without registration.\n\nThe government took no legal steps to implement the minister of education’s directive prohibiting the right of girls to wear the hijab, or headscarf, in primary and secondary schools, and the majority of school administrators throughout the country did not implement the minister’s directive.\n\nOn May 6 a group of people gathered in front of the Ministry of Education to protest the minister’s directive on wearing hijabs at primary and secondary schools. A large police force dispersed the protesters and it was reported that authorities released forty detainees the next morning, but jailed the remaining five for 12 to15 days on administrative charges of hooliganism, resisting arrest, and disturbing public order.\n\nDomestic human rights monitors continued to criticize the government’s failure to develop a civilian alternative option to non-combat military service, and Jehovah’s Witnesses argued that the country, as a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, is obliged to develop one. The government continued to charge and imprison conscientious objectors for refusing to serve in the military. A court convicted Farid Mammadov, a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, in 2010 for refusal to perform military service in peacetime and sentenced him to nine months’ imprisonment. Authorities freed him from prison on June 8.\n\nSeveral religious groups remained unregistered. In 2010 the government required all religious groups to re-register with the SCWRA. Although it registered numerous Muslim and several non-Muslim groups, at year’s end the SCWRA either refused or did not adjudicate the re-registration of at least 12 groups of various religions. Despite a requirement that registration applications be acted on within 30 days of receipt, religious organizations observed that nontransparent registration procedures prolonged this process.\n\nThroughout the year, legal proceedings by Jehovah’s Witnesses against various authorities started, continued, or were completed. At issue was the SCWRA’s refusal to grant re-registration and censor the content and number of publications the Jehovah’s Witnesses wanted to import. The Jehovah’s Witnesses also appealed several convictions and fines of its members. For example, authorities in Ganja on June 12 detained, then released, convicted, and fined four Jehovah’s Witness believers from 500 to 1500 manat ($633 to $1,898) for allegedly participating in an illegal religious meeting in Ganja. The Ganja Court of Appeals issued a final decision on July 11 to dismiss the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ appeal of these convictions.\n\nReligious organizations continued to report incidents of authorities raiding and confiscating religious materials. In May police disrupted a Cathedral of Praise service taking place at a restaurant in Sumgait, recorded the names of those present, and took several members of the group to a police station for questioning. Two members received fines of 149 manat ($190) for the administrative offense of attending church at a location other than its registered address. In another incident in May, approximately 20 police officers and officials from the state committee raided the private home of a South Korean citizen, seizing 60 Bibles and other Christian books.\n\nMedia outlets continued to report sporadic confrontations between religious communities (mainly Muslim) and law enforcement agencies. In such incidents, the authorities reportedly pushed, detained for a few days, forcefully questioned, or warned Muslims, often prior to or during major Muslim holidays. For example, in December, police reportedly met and talked with a few Shia leaders in Ganja prior to Ashura, warning the Shia community of the need to maintain order during their religious ceremony.\n\nOn July 18 the Azerbaijan Public Association for Security and Defense (MilAz) reported three officers of the National Army were reduced in rank for performing namaz (Muslim prayers). The Ministry of Defense denied this allegation, claiming the officers were moved to other military units and demoted for inefficiency.\n\nUnconfirmed allegations were made by an NGO that the government continued to ban the placement of religious icons and literature in some offices of government employees.\n\nThe law permits the production and dissemination of religious literature with the approval of the SCWRA; however, authorities appeared to be selective in their approval of religious materials, especially with religions without a long historical presence, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses. Obtaining permission to import religious literature remained burdensome, and Muslim and Christian groups complained of the lengthy process and increased censorship.\n\nControls on a variety of Islamic activity, including religious television broadcasts and sale of religious literature at metro stations, remained in effect.\n\nAdditional restrictions included property disputes, such as with the Cathedral of Praise, and alleged bans on the call to prayer in some areas.\n\nAuthorities continued to limit activities of “nontraditional” Muslim communities through closing mosques and prayer houses. There were some reports of closures of Muslim prayer houses in the greater Baku area and northern regions. The government claimed these prayer houses used the premises of different organizations without permission and had failed to properly register. For example, in December, Yasamal District authorities in Baku closed the Huseyniyya prayer house. The SCWRA explained that this was done on the basis of illegal use of premises belonging to other agencies and failure to register.\n\nA number of mosques closed by authorities in 2010 remained closed. Some were closed by local executive authorities on the grounds that they were in need of renovations, or for safety reasons, such as the Shahidlar Mosque. The Sunni Juma mosque in Ganja was closed for failing to follow registration requirements. There have been no further developments regarding these cases.\n\nThe construction of the Fatima Zahra Shia mosque in the Yeni Guneshli settlement of the Surakhani District of Baku remained stalled in 2011 as the community’s registration request remained unresolved.\n\nThe Cathedral of Praise’s long-standing property and registration disputes with the authorities continued and remained with the courts. On May 25 the Supreme Court overthrew the Court of Appeals’ previous decision dismissing the Cathedral of Praise’s lawsuit which had claimed church property was illegally confiscated, and the case was sent back for reconsideration. However, the community reported that it was offered land in a different location as compensation.\n\nDuring the year, an NGO reported one incident of possible forced beard shaving. On July 26 police in the Zagatala region allegedly beat and forcibly shaved a 51-year-old man who refused to shave his beard in order to be photographed for his identity card. However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs disputed the report, claiming the man was given the option of applying for a completely new identity card or shaving his beard to match the photo in his old identity card, and that he departed without any physical altercation.\n\nUnlike in prior years, there were no reports of arrests of individuals who observed the Islamic holiday of Ashura through self-flagellation. The CMB publicly recommended blood donations instead of self-flagellation.\n\nOn December 13 Trend news agency reported that local authorities detained an unknown number of Seventh-Day Adventists and confiscated religious literature. Authorities detained one foreign citizen during this raid.\n\nSeveral news outlets reported that on October 31 government officials detained four Baptists for a five-day period subsequent to a raid on a private home at which approximately 80 persons had gathered for a harvest festival.\n\nThe requirement for re-registration in 2010 of all religious groups, regardless of the previous status of their registration, was easily fulfilled by some groups. However, the government denied the registration of other groups and left others waiting in limbo. For example, the government denied the registration of some communities of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, the Fatima Zahra mosque, the Baku International Fellowship, and the Baptist Church in Aliabad. According to Human Rights Without Frontiers, the government also denied the registration of the Nehemiah and Pentecostal churches. Groups that were denied registration sat in a legal gray area; they could not congregate legally and could be subjected to harassment by law-enforcement officials.\n\nAs of December 31 the government had registered a total of 570 religious communities, of which 550 were Islamic and 20 were non-Islamic.\n\nOrganizations that chose to practice without official registration continued to be vulnerable to being declared illegal and closed or subjected to selective harassment by local authorities. As a result, these groups found it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to function.\n\nThe government did not exercise control over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Religious groups and NGOs, including Jehovah’s Witnesses and Forum 18, reported that they faced some restrictions and abuses in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nIn December Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nagorno-Karabakh reported one of their members, Karen Ogandjanyan, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for refusing military service."
