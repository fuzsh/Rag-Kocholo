        "text": "By Amina Nazarli\n\nAzerbaijan`s Guba and Kyrgyzstan`s Kant have signed a memorandum to become sister cities as head of Guba Region Executive Authority Yashar Mammadov visited the Kyrgyz city.\n\nKant Mayor Erkinbek Abdirakhmanov, speaking at the signing ceremony, hailed development of Azerbaijani regions, including Guba. The mayor stressed Azerbaijani Ambassador Hidayat Orujov’s role in establishing relations between Guba and Kant.\n\nMammadov highlighted Guba`s tourism potential, saying that the region is home to people of diverse nationalities, who co-exist here in peace and harmony.\n\nHe noted that Azerbaijan deeply cares about ethnic and religious minorities.\n\nAmbassador Orujov, for his part,said he is happy that Guba and Kant started cooperating, adding that the Kyrgyz city is densely populated by Azerbaijanis.\n\nIn Kant, the Azerbaijani delegation also visited a street named after national leader Heydar Aliyev.\n\nOne of Azerbaijan’s most beautiful regions, Guba, is an impressive corner of the country known for its rich flora and fauna. The northern region, located in 168 km from Baku, has become a favorite destination for many travelers.\n\nGuba is the closest mountainous region to Baku, located about three hours from the Baku International Bus Terminal, where you can easily find yourself on an affordable vacation surrounded by a sea of green, broken up only by majestic mountains.\n\nWith fresh air, unique landscapes, and preserved traditions, Guba attracts thousands of local and foreign tourists every year. It’s cold winters and cool summer nights make the region even more attractive for tourists.\n\nKant is a town in the northern Kyrgyzstan, some 20 kilometers east of Bishkek.\n\nKant is an industrial and service center. The Kyrgyz word for sugar is \"kant\", and the city received its name when a sugar plant was built there in the 1930s.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of ethnic Germans who had been forcibly relocated to Central Asia in 1941.\n\nSeveral other nearby settlements, such as Luxemburg and Bergtal, still carry their German names.\n\n--\n\nAmina Nazarli is AzerNews’ staff journalist, follow her on Twitter: @amina_nazarli"
