        "text": "The European title for men U73kg went to Azerbaijan. New kid Hidayet Heydarov, who made his transition from U66kg to U73kg quickly, took the European title in his final against Musa Mogushkov. It was a unique European title. Like yesterday, with the youngster Bilodid, today another historical moment occurred in Europe with the fourth different age title by one person. Hidayet Heydarov is the first man to do it.\n\nHeydarov, who was European Cadet champion in 2013 and 2014 and European Junior champion in 2016 also won the European U23 title last year. Where Rustam Orujov lost against Mogushkov in the quarter final, Heydarov was able to win against Mogushkov. The Russian remained dangerous during the match, but couldn’t score. After 1:35 had elapsed Mogushkov made his third mistake and Heydarov made his moves on the tatami to celebrate his fourth European title in his career, but this one really counts.\n\nThe rhythm of the match was slow. No score within the first four minutes and only two penalties for Mogushkov. In the golden score Heydarov pulled the victory to his end with a third penalty for the Russian fighter.\n\nThis year Heydarov won bronze medals at the Grand Slam in Paris and Grand Prix in Antalya.\n\nAlso Mogushkov made a transition from U66 to U73kg in 2013. However, he never was as successful as in the U66kg class where he was the former World number one. This year Mogushkov didn’t fight so far in international tournaments where Heydarov fought at three major events and picked up the rhythm of the season well.\n\nThe fourth different age European title for Hidayet Heydarov. He is unique in this, the first ever man to win four different European titles. Only Natalia Kuzyutina won four different age European titles.\n\nThere was a second European medal for Azerbaijan by Rustam Orujov. The second bronze went to Swedish judoka Tommy Macias, maybe not a surprise, he has done really well so far over the last year."
