        "text": "Purpose: In spite of the success of hepatitis B immunization, still a significant proportion of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) failed to be prevented by the hepatitis B immunization program. This study is aimed to investigate the problems in the HCC prevention in children.\n\nExperimental Design: All HCC children ages 6 to 14 diagnosed between 1981 and 2000 in Taiwan were collected from two national childhood HCC registry systems. We analyzed the causes of HCC prevention failure and the risk ratio of HCC among hepatitis B carriers born before versus after the vaccination program.\n\nResults: The incidence of HCC per 100,000 children declined from 0.54 to 0.20 in those born before versus after the vaccination program (risk ratio, 0.36). Vaccine failure (33.3-51.4%) and failure to receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth (42.4-57.5%) were the main causes of HCC prevention failure. Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus infection is an important risk factor of HCC development. This is evidenced by the very high hepatitis B surface antigen seropositive rate in our HCC children (97%) and their mothers (96%). Hepatitis B carrier children born after the vaccination program had a higher risk of developing HCC than those born before the program (risk ratio, 2.3-4.5).\n\nConclusions: Vaccine failure and failure to receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin are the main problems preventing eradication of HCC. Hepatitis B carrier children born after the immunization program have a higher risk of developing HCC than those born before.\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in humans. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major etiologic agent responsible for HCC (1–4). HCC occurs mainly in adults between 40 and 60 years of age with a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive rate of ∼70% to 80% (5). However, in areas hyperendemic for HBV infection, HCC may also develop in children (6). In our previous study, 94% of Taiwanese children with HCC were HBsAg seropositive. It suggests a very close relationship between HBV infection and childhood HCC in Taiwan (6). HCV infection has not been related to HCC in children in the world literature and in our previous study (7).\n\nUniversal hepatitis B vaccination has effectively reduced the prevalence of HBV infection and chronic carrier rates (8). In addition, our previous study in Taiwan also showed that, according to birth cohort, the incidence of HCC in children ages between 6 and 9 years decreased from 0.52 to 0.13 per 100,000 in those born before versus after the vaccination program (9).\n\nHowever, the reduction in the incidence of HCC (75%) by the universal hepatitis B vaccination program is not as effective as that in chronic HBV infection (90%). Therefore, we are curious to know whether chronic HBsAg carriers who were born after the hepatitis B immunization program have a higher risk of developing HCC than those born before the program.\n\nWhereas we are monitoring the long-term trend of HCC in children during the 16 years after the launch of the HBV immunization program, we have accumulated more data on children in whom the vaccination program failed to prevent HCC. We try to determine the causes of HCC prevention failure in those born after the implementation of the vaccination program. These results may point the way to set better strategies toward the success of HCC prevention.\n\nGeneral trend in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in children. The results of the incidence of HCC in children ages 6 to 14 years by birth year are shown in Table 1. We found that the difference in the incidence of HCC between those born before and after July 1984 was substantial (P < 0.001). Taking those born before July 1984 as a baseline group yielded 0.36 of risk ratio for HCC in those birth cohort (July 1984-June 1994) born after the immunization program.\n\nTable 1.\n\nBirth year* .

Thirty-five children, 25 boys and 10 girls (male to female ratio, 2.5), with HCC were born after July 1984 (i.e., after the implementation of the universal hepatitis B immunization program in Taiwan). Of the 25 boys, 16 (64%) were below and 9 were above 10 years of age at diagnosis. Three girls (30%) were below and seven girls were above 10 years of age at diagnosis. All 32 children with known serum levels of α-fetoprotein had an elevated level: 29 had levels >10,000 ng/mL, and the other three had a level of 6,018, 108, and 25 ng/mL, respectively. The HBsAg status was available in 33 of the 35 children.\n\nAnalysis of the causes of hepatocellular carcinoma prevention failure in 33 hepatocellular carcinoma children with known hepatitis B virus infection status. We analyzed the possible causes of HCC prevention failure in 33 HCC children who were born after the implementation of universal HBV vaccination program with available data of serum HBsAg and/or HBV DNA status by PCR. Thirty-two (97%) of the 33 were HBsAg or HBV DNA seropositive (31 with positive serum HBsAg and one with negative serum HBsAg but positive HBV DNA in the serum by PCR). The remaining one was seronegative for HBsAg and HBV DNA by PCR assay. HCC was considered as not related to HBV infection in the latter one (Fig. 1).\n\nAmong those 32 children (97.0%) with chronic HBV infection, the causes of HCC prevention failure are most likely related to HBV prevention failure. Adding together, the possible causes of HCC prevention failure in 3.0% to 6.0% may be due to no HBV vaccination, 33.3% to 51.4% due to vaccine failure, and 42.4% to 57.5% due to no hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection in spite of three or four doses of HBV vaccination.\n\nRisks of hepatocellular carcinoma in children with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The HBsAg seropositive rates declined from 8.7% to 10.5% in those born before the vaccination program to 0.7% to 1.7% in those born after the program. The incidences of HCC in HBsAg carrier children ages 6 to 14 years old were increased from 5.1 to 6.2 per 100,000 in those born before the program to 11.6 to 28.9 per 100,000 in those born afterward (Table 2). Using Poisson analysis, we found a higher risk for the development of HCC in children with chronic HBV infection born after the program to be statistically significant, versus those born before the program (risk ratio, 2.3-4.5).\n\nTable 2.\n\nBirth year* .

The HBV immunization program has been proven to be effective in preventing HBV-related HCC in children. This study revealed that the cause of HCC in 97% of HCC children born after the HBV immunization program was very likely HBV related. The success of HCC prevention is thus very much dependent on the success of the prevention of chronic HBV infection. The two most important causes of HCC prevention failure were vaccine failure (33.3-51.4%) and no hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection (42.4-57.5%; Fig. 1).\n\nIt is obvious that lack of hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection in infants of highly infectious mothers is an important cause of HCC prevention failure. Adding hepatitis B immunoglobulin to HBV vaccination was reported to increase efficacy by 19% in preventing chronic HBV infection (18). Without hepatitis B immunoglobulin, they would be infected by HBV perinatally and have high risk of HCC. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is not included as part of the universal immunization program in many areas. It is acceptable not to include hepatitis B immunoglobulin in areas with low prevalence of HBV infection or with limited budget for the vaccination program. Yet, once the universal HBV vaccination program is successfully implemented, further improvement of the efficacy and the successful prevention of HCC will be anticipated.\n\nThe birth cohort in this study is reflecting the effect of the first 10 years (1984-1994) of the HBV vaccination program in Taiwan. The coverage rate of hepatitis B immunoglobulin among the infants of high-risk mothers with positive serum hepatitis B e-antigen or reciprocal HBsAg titers >2,560 was 72% to 84% during the first 10 years of the Taiwanese HBV immunization program (11).8\n\nThe HBsAg carrier rate in children has been reduced from 9.8% before the HBV immunization program (1984) to 0.7% 15 years after the program (1999) in Taiwanese children (8, 13–15). Although the HBsAg seropositive rate in those born after the program has been reduced to approximately one tenth of those born before the vaccination program, the incidence of HCC in children of the same birth cohort was only reduced to 36% (Table 1). This discrepancy of the prevention efficacy may be explained by the successful prevention of horizontal transmission of HBV, whereas the maternal transmission cannot be interrupted completely by the current HBV immunization program.\n\nBefore the era of HBV immunization, ∼40% of the HBsAg carriers in Taiwan were due to perinatal transmission, whereas 60% of the carriers were infected by horizontal route (18). Thus, among the 10% HBsAg carrier children in the population, ∼6% were attributed to horizontal transmission and the remaining 4% were transmitted perinatally by maternal route. The horizontal transmission can be prevented by the HBV immunization program effectively, whereas approximately a quarter (1%) of the 4% HBsAg carrier children potentially infected by their mothers may fail to respond to the hepatitis B immunization program (Table 3). The failure rate of HCC prevention ranged from 25% (9) to 36% (this study), which is very close to the failure rate of HBV prevention against maternal transmission (Table 3). Those who failed to respond to HBV immunoprophylaxis were infected mainly in utero or perinatally by highly infectious mothers (19).\n\nTable 3.\n\nHBsAg carrier rates and HCC incidences in Taiwanese children .

Another evidence supporting the better efficacy of prevention of the horizontal infection is the result of a seroepidemiologic survey conducted at 15 years after the HBV immunization program in Taiwan (8). Among the 1,357 children born after the launch of the HBV immunization program, 9 children were seropositive for HBsAg (8). Maternal serum HBsAg was positive in eight of nine (89%) HBsAg carrier children. These data again provide evidence to support that horizontal transmission of HBV has been prevented much more effectively than perinatal transmission by the HBV immunization program.\n\nFurther efforts to improve the hepatitis B immunoglobulin and HBV vaccine coverage rate to prevent intrauterine infection and to improve the prevention efficacy in perinatal HBV infection by highly infectious mothers are crucial for better prevention of HCC. Strategies to improve the efficacy of HBV prevention, such as developing better vaccines, the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin in every infant of HBsAg mothers, lamivudine therapy for high-risk pregnant mothers (20), need to be further evaluated for the efficacy of HBV and HCC prevention.\n\nIn conclusion, the incidence of HCC in children has consistently declined from 6 to 16 years after the launch of the HBV immunization program in Taiwan. Vaccine failure and failure to receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin are the two most important challenges to be overcome to achieve successful HCC control. HBsAg carriers born after the HBV immunization program may have a higher risk of developing HCC than those born before the vaccination era. It is most likely due to the success in eliminating horizontal transmission and the more difficulty in eradicating perinatal transmission of HBV."
