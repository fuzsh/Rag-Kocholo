        "text": "As far as I understand it there's no solid proof Confucius as a person existed ('as far as I understand it' being what I've literally just read in that thread in the general forum...), so this strikes me as highly dubious.\n\nTo be honest, over that length of something's bound to have happened to disrupt the family line, it's a bit coincidental that Confucius's would be the one-in-a-million not affected by, as you say, seventy-nine generations of war or intermarriage.\n\nThere seems likely to be some, or even a lot of, descent, because as far as I understand it (what I've literally just read on Wikipedia) their titles can be traced with a great deal of certainty, but an unbroken father-to-son thing is very, very unlikely, and the family didn't agree to DNA testing in 2009.\n\nIt seems like you misunderstand. This is about a specific family that held the a consistent aristocratic title for over 2,200 years.\n\nEven if you don't believe Confucius (Kong Zi) existed (who lived 2,500) years, this family that claim to be his descendants are still the oldest traceable family in the world in the patrilineal line since their ancestor Kong Teng was appointed as a Marquis by the Emperor of China around 2,200 years ago. Everything from him down to the present day is traceable in public records.\n\nThe family held a consistent title (a Marquisate) since the Han dynasty 2,200 years ago, the Song dynasty elevated the title to Duke Yansheng 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe family resided in Qufu, the hometown of Confucius in Shandong. Their Marquisate and then Ducal seat was located at the Kong Family Mansion, with a family cemetary for all members of the family who held the title of Marquis and Duke. They had their own public feudal fief and ran it for 2,200 years. in Qufu, the family cemetary and Qufu itself has tons of old tombstones and ceremonial bells lying around listing each Marquis's and Duke's name, and their generation number (the generation of descent from Confucius)\n\nAll dynasties since the Han down to the Qing dynasty and even Republic of China confirmed the families title as Marquis and then duke. Even invaders like the Mongols, after invading China, regularly confirmed the title of the Duke Yansheng. They had to continously award the title and honor the reigning Marquis and Duke and document every time this happened and when a new Marquis and Duke succeeded the hold one.\n\nThey kept a clear family tree with records. Nobody ever said it was an unbroken father son succession- the title of Marquis and Duke passed on to paternal cousins several times when the reigning Marquis or Duke didn't have any heir.\n\nEverything beneath Kong Teng who was awarded the Marquisate 2,200 years ago is reliably documented in records which were kept and published. There are multiple instances on the family tree which show nephews or cousins succeeding their relatives.\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Confucius_in_the_main_line_of_descent]Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nHowever it is still a world record for longest lineage traceable in the patrilineal line, since only paternal agnatic relatives were allowed to succeed to the title.\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Yansheng]Duke Yansheng - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nSince this family existed for over 2,200 years, there have been multiple collateral branches spreading out from the main line, and moving far away from Qufu. They moved all the way to Yunnan, Gansu, and other frontier provinces. Some even moved to Korea.\n\nThe DNA testing was not about challenging the legitimacy of the main family line who held the title of duke. It was about seeing if the distant collateral branches spread all over different provinces of China were related to the main line. Apparently some of them raised a fuss and didn't want to get tested.\n\nThe last Duke Yansheng was Kong Te-cheng until 1935, when the Republic of China changed his title from Duke into Sacrificial Official to Confucius.\n\nHe fled to Taiwan in 1949 along with the government of the Republic of China when the Communists took over and established the People's Republic.\n\nHis grandson Kong Tsui-chang still lives on Taiwan and holds the title now.\n\nIt was a person from a collateral branch who still lives in mainland China who brought up the idea of DNA test and then decided to cancel it. The main lineage currently in Taiwan was not involved in this.\n\nWorth pointing out a lot of the time China's government restricts independent access to records and archives. Not sure if this is one of those times, but it's happened often enough in the past to warrant scepticism.\n\nThe current holder of the title and head of the main line of the family lives in Taiwan, not mainland China. There are no aristocratic titles allowed in mainland China today.\n\nKung Tsui-chang - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe records are not held in restricted archives. They are out in public and even on the tombstones and bells lying around in Qufu as I mentioned.\n\nThe cemetery is called the \"Confucian forest\"\n\nEncyclopedia of China: History and Culture - Google Books\n\nThe Duke Yansheng was known to westerners since the Qing dynasty and his genealogy was available to the public. Its kind of hard to miss him since he was running his own fief in Qufu.\n\nThe Confucian Mansion, Tombstone, and Temple in Qufu where this family used to live are all tourist attractions now.\n\nQufu - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Family_Mansion]Kong Family Mansion - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery_of_Confucius]Cemetery of Confucius - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nThere are graves over 2,000 years in the cemetery, and tons of ancient tablets and tombstones with the names of the descendants and their generation of descent from Confucius lying around.\n\nThe Japanese Imperial Family claimed to be the oldest traceable family in the paternal lineage, but they firstly don't have recorded records or tombstones dating back to 2,600 years ago, they didn't even have a writing system for recording the lineage until it was introduced from mainland asia around 2,000 years ago, and they claim descent from a goddess.\n\nIts the main lineage of the family that claims to be Confucius descendants that has the oldest reliably traceable paternal lineage, even if you don't believe they are descendants of Confucius, ever since their family was awarded the Marquis title in Qufu 2,200 years ago.\n\nIt seems like you misunderstand.

It's pretty hard to believe, but I guess it's not entirely impossible.\n\nIf we go by the standard of Japan's imperial family and talk about less reliably verifiable lineages (all human and not descended from gods), Confucius' ancestry is traced all the way back to the Kings of the Shang dynasty through the Dukes of Song since the Song Dukes were descendants of Shang royals who were granted a fief by the Zhou dynasty. That would mean 3,600 years of traceable ancestry in the male line since the Shang dynasty was founded in 1600 BC. That is 1,000 years before the first alleged Japanese Emperor.\n\nFor continuously verified genealogies the Kong family from Qufu is still the longest patrilineally agnatically traced family for at least 2,200 years since the family first received an official title and then a hereditary Marquisate (eventually upgraded to Dukedom) from the Han dynasty and had its title confirmed by every dynasty which ruled northern China down to the Republic of China and on Taiwan to this day. Each dynasty ruling northern China had to continuously enfeoff the new marquis/dukes and continuously document it. Additionally the Marquises and Dukes were buried in the family cemetery in Qufu with tombstones marking their name and generation of descent, and records were kept in the Confucius Temple in Qufu.\n\nEven if you believe their descent from Confucius is fraudulent, this particular family is still the oldest continuously documented family ever trace in the male line."
