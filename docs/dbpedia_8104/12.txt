TAIPEI, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Taipei residents formed a long line outside the Confucius temple at dawn on Monday morning, waiting to attend the annual ceremony marking the ancient Chinese philosopher's birth 2,571 years ago.

The 90-minute ceremony started at 6 a.m., hosted by Kung Tsui-chang, a direct 79th-generation descendant of Confucius. A 37-step ritual that has been passed down over the centuries was performed at the ceremony.
