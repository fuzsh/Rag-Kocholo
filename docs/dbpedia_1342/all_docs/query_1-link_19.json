        "text": "“I had the pleasure to have and know Valentin both as colleague and friend along many years. We were colleagues for more than 1 year in Kazakhstan from where I immediately understood that he is a very skilled and organized Cost Control Engineer. He is a target oriented person and moreover a perfect team-worker. Fortunately we have met again in Congo, where our cooperation, me as Client and him as Contractor this time, extended for the last 4 years. Here I had time to discover his professional approach on all issues, his ambition, his collegiality and his thirst for learning and continuous personal development. My first impression on him never changed, therefore after all these years together I consider myself fully entitled to recommend him as the perfect asset for any Employer in Oil&Gas domain and not only. I wish him luck in his further career and I hope I will continue having him as friend and colleague also from now on.”\n\n“I have worked with Valentin and I observe him during a year : I can say that Valentin is an easy going person. He performed all these tasks competently and with commitment and enthusiasm. I observe him working under pressure and he demonstrated the ability to work with it and to plan and organize successfully to meet tight deadlines. His strong interpersonal and communication skills have allowed him to develop good working relationships with both his colleagues and management. When I was in Congo he tried to improve his level in French every single day, and keep asking me questions about the french complexity language. I highly recommend him for employment he is a strong asset in a team. ”"
