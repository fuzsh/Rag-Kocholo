Dhemaji Town Committee and Silapathar Town Committee were under Congress rule in the session 2009-2014. In this election, citizens of Dhemaji and Silapathar had exercised their franchise in favour of the BJP in the hope of good governance. The citizens of Dhemaji district are facing problems of pure drinking water, proper drainage system, proper road connectivity, street lights, traffic congestion etc. Several crores of rupees have been sanctioned to the Silapathar and Dhemaji Town Committee for development of the area. But due to the all-pervasive corruption, the residents have not got the due benefits.

There is no proper drainage system in both the town committee areas. At least Rs 22 crore was sanctioned to the Silapathar Town Committee for the drainage system. Still, the residents Silapathar have to face waterlogging in the rainy season due to non-utilisation of funds.
