It may be mentioned that one crore rupees were sanctioned for a drainage system but the funds were allegedly misused. The citizens of Silapathar town are facing large-scale waterlogging in the first week of June. The citizens and businessmen are demanding a solution to the problem but the local administration, the local MLA, the town committee and the district administration are not showing any interest in the matter.\n\nThe Silapathar Town LP School has remained closed since the last seven days due to water logging.
