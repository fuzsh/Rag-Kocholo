        "text": "AASU serves 12-hour deadline to CM Guwahati, March 8 (IANS): The Assam government on Wednesday set up a one-man inquiry commission to probe the violence in Silapathar two days ago where protesters led by a Bengali group demanding citizenship for Hindu Bangladeshis vandalised an All Assam Students Union office. Meanwhile, Assam's prominent students' body, All Assam Students' Union (AASU) has dared Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and the BJP-led government in Dispur to prove their sincerity and commitment by arresting Subodh Biswas, the president of Nikhil Bharat Bengali Udbastu Samanvay Samiti (NBBUSS) within 12 hours time, over the violence. The NBBUSS is spearheading a movement for granting citizenship to Hindu Bangladeshis by amending the Citizenship Act. Assam police had on Tuesday evening issued a wanted notice against Biswas for his alleged role in instigating the mob to ransack and vandalize the an office of the AASU at Silapathar town in Assam's Dhemaji district on Monday. The Assam government had already instituted a probe to be headed by Additional Chief Secretary VB Pyarelal and submit the report within 30 days time. The police had arrested 9 persons for their alleged role in attacking and vandalizing the AASU office and also to attack the security forces during the violence. \"Why is it taking so long to arrest Biswas?... The BJP-led Assam government often talks about protecting the land culture and identity of the people of Assam. It is high time the government should prove its sincerity by arresting Biswas,\" said AASU general secretary, Lurinjyoti Gogoi. Meanwhile, Assam Governor Banwarilal Purohit also expressed grave concern over the vandalism incident and termed it an act of cowardice. He also said the perpetrators will be dealt with sternly as per the established law. At the same time, he also urged upon all to maintain peace and harmony to strengthen Assam's pride of being a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-lingual and multi-religious society."
