        "text": "The Silapathar College was established in 1979 as a result of concerted efforts made by generous local public who were led by a group of academically ambitious leaders. It is the second oldest college in the district of Dhemaji. The history of establishment of institutions for higher learning in the district of Dhemaji, in fact, began with the inception of Dhemaji College followed by Silapathar College. It is located in the heart of the rapidly growing small township of Silapathar which is surrounded by villages of tribal and backward communities. Thus, the college pledges to underline its target groups at the young men and women belonging to economically poor and socially excluded section of the society. The college, thus, established with the goal of spreading the web of higher education in geographically northern Assam, has been endlessly attempting to provide quality education to the young generation."
