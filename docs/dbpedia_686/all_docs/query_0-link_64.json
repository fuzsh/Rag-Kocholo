        "text": "Amidst unrest and protest in various parts of state condemning the unprecedented attack by activists of Nikhil Bharat Bengali Udbastu Sammanay Samiti at AASU’s Silapathar regional office, the Tangla Anchalik Chatra Santha organized a strong protest rally and road blockade programme in the heart of Tangla on Wednesday demanding immediate arrest of the culprits of the Silapathar incident. The protest rally was also joined by activists of AJYCP and common public of the town. The protesters resorted to burning of tyres and staging road blockade of the Mangaldai-Bhutiachang Road for nearly two hours. The traffic and normal life was completly brought to a halt.\n\nJayanta Kr. Bhattacharya Assistant General Secretary AASU addressing the protest condemned the ransacking of the AASU office at Silapathar in Dhemaji district in strongest term and said that the incident was a reminder for the unification of the indigenous sons of the soil against external forces.\n\n\"We will not let the sacrifice of 855 martyrs of the Assam Movement go in vain. The historic Assam Accord should be implemented in letter and spirit \",\n\nsaid Jayanta Kr. Bhattacharya.\n\nBhattacharya exhorted the Sarbananda Sonowal led state government to work for the protection and interest of its indigenious people.\n\nHe also lambasted the governments in the state and the centre for showing laxity towards the issue of illegal immigrants.\n\nSaiful Haque activist of AASU said the student body would not rest until the state was freed from illegal immigrants and supremacy of the indigenous people of the state was ensured. Haque also said the attack on the indigenous people and their institution was not tolerable and the Silapathar incident had indicated the threat towards the indigenous\n\npeople of the State."
