        "text": "Purbanchal College, Silapathar which was formerly known as“Silapathar Commerce College” due to dual stream i.e., Arts and Commerce,has been changed to its present name “Purbanchal College, Silapathar” by order of the Govt. of Assam and Dibrugarh University as per norms. It is the only premier institution of higher education in both Arts and Commerce streams in the entire Jonai Legislative Assembly Costituency (114 ST Reserved). The college was established in the year 1996 in this vast, rural, and tribal; interstate border area between the state of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The whole area is socio-economically backward. It is dwelt in by people of diverse castes, creeds, communities, tribal and ethnic groups who have their own distinct culture, religion and language. To provide higher education to the students who are mostly first generation readers and belong to socially deprived and downtrodden families of this area, the college was started at the initiative of a few educationists, the deprived parents, social workers and conscious public."
