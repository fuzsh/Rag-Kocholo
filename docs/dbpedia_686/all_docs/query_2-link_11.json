        "text": "Don Bosco High School, one of the premier English Medium Schools in the District of Dhemaji had a very humble beginning like any other institution.\n\nThe mission was started by Rev. Fr. John sdb in the year 1969 at Likabali. In the year 1970, at the request of the people of Silapathar and under the inspiration of the Bishop of Tezpur, Rt Rev. Joseph Mittathany, Fr. John Palathungal, a priest of the Salesians of Don Bosco started the school in a thatched shed with 28 students and two members on the staff. Fr. John SDB continued to serve the institution till 1973. In 1973, Fr. Varghese Kalarickal, a diocesan priest was appointed as the principal. It was during his time the first Assam type building and the presbytery were constructed. The school began to take shape during those period with the increase of the number of the students. He guided and enlightened the people of the various need and problems of the mission. In the beginning year of the mission two group of sisters rendered their service in the parish. The first group was the missionary sisters of Mary Immaculate and the other, sisters of the Imitation of Christ. In 1975, Bethany Sisters of Thruvalla joined the staff. The year 1976 was a memorable for the missionaries of St. Francies De Sales because it was in that year that Rt. Rev. Joseph Mittathany was the Bishop of Tezpur entrusted the mission of Silapathar to our care and he helped us in various ways for the growth of the mission.\n\nThe school began either request of the people of silapathar and under the inspiration of the then Bishop of Tezpur Rt. Joseph Mittathany in a thatched shed with 28 students and two members on the staff. Catholic Mission at Silapathar is the first mission in Dhemaji District of Assam.It was started by the Salesians in 1970 and was taken over by the Diocese of in 1973. From 1976 onwards we the MSFS are working here. It was served the people in various fields through many fathers, brothers and sisters for the years. This is one of the permanents centers for us.\n\nIn July 1976 Fr. Abraham Kuttiankal a priest belonging to the Missionaries of St. Francis de sales (M.S.F.S’s), was appointed as the principal. That was the starting point of M.S.F.S’s work here at Silapathar. The response of the people had not been very encouraging from the initial days of the mission. Often the people looked at the missionaries with suspicion. It was a happy and decisive moment for Fr. Abraham Kuttiankal to take charge of an old mission, which had its own unresolved problems. In the same year Fr. Mathew Kavithazha was appointed on the staff.\n\nIn 1977 Fr. S.L.Paul came after his work and studies in U.S.A and was appointed as the parish priest of Silapathar and Fr.

Paul in the administration of the school. Fr. Varkey Valiedath too was in the Silapathar mission from 1978 before the starting of Dhemaji mission. Silapathar remained hostile to the missioners for a long time. Eviction notices had been served by the civil authorities at the instigation of the people and the missionaries bore it with courage. Gradually they managed to secure patta for the mission land. In July 1980 Fr. Augustine Vellarankuzhy was appointed as the principal and continued till October 1981.
