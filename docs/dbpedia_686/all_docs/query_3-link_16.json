        "text": "KOKRAJHAR, March 7: Bodoland Jajati Suraksha Manch (BJSM) on Tuesday condemned the ransacking of the AASU office at Silapathar in Dhemaji district in strongest term and said that the incident was a wake-up call for the indigenous people of Assam against exterl aggression. The Manch called upon all indigenous communities of Assam to be united against the forces that are potential threat to the existence of the sons of the soil.\n\nThe working president of the BJSM, DD rzary said the attack on the indigenous people and their institution was not tolerable and the Silapathar incident had indicated the threat towards the indigenous people of the State. He said the Hindu Bengalis were from erstwhile East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, and they had been occupying lands of indigenous people of Assam. Besides, the culture and tradition of indigenous people are also being threatened by their influence, he said, adding that the people of Assam should take the Silapathar incident as a lesson and must be united to stand against the Bangladeshi influx, whether Hindus or Muslims.\n\n“The Assamese, Deori, Sonowal, Boro, Garo, Rabha, Karbi and Dimasa people all belonged to the same blood and are brothers and indigenous people of the State. They are simply known by different mes and identity,” he said adding that in the hour of crisis everybody should come forward to bail out the indigenous communities from the threat of exterl force. He said no Hindu or Muslim Bangladeshi would be allowed to grab land of the indigenous people of Assam and the Government of Assam must take necessary initiative to clear the lands of indigenous people illegally occupied by foreigners and deport them. The ransacking of AASU office in Silapathar should be taken as serious and government should take all preventive measures against the forces that are operating against the indigenous people of Assam. The government must work for the protection of its own people, he said.\n\nThe president of Ex-BLT Welfare Society, Ja Mohan Mashahary also strongly condemned the incident at Silapathar and said the people of Assam should take it as a lesson. He urged the district administration to find out the culprits and take action as per law. He, however, called upon all people to maintain peace at any cost.\n\nThe Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samanvay Samiti (NIBBUSS) held a meeting at Silapathar in which some State and tiol-level leaders of the Bengali Hindu community took part and they discussed various issues, including the ‘D’ voter issue. The participants in the meeting reportedly rejected the Assam Accord and favoured the proposed Citizenship Amendment Bill planned to be introduced by the Union Government. After the meeting, the participants led by NIBBUSS took out a rally and while the rally reached in front of the AASU office in Silapathar, some angry protesters ransacked it and damaged property.\n\nOn the sidelines of a programme at Kakopathat in Tinsukia district on Tuesday, the Chief Minister categorically said in strong terms that the culprits who had perpetrated the act would not be spared, adding further that he had asked Pyarelal to submit the report within one month. Sonowal attended the 5th annual Sadau Asom Mamamora Sanskritik Samaj at Kakopathar on Tuesday.\n\nAhom Se central committee publicity secretary Sailen Gogoi said that after the formation of the BJP-led government, many unprecedented incidents were taking place in Assam and in the coming days, peace and brotherhood among the people of Assam might be threatened. “We demand that Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samanvay Samiti (NIBBUSS) leader Subadh Biswas should be immediately arrested as due to his inflammatory speech the incident occurred and NIBBUSS should be immediately banned in Assam,” said Gogoi.\n\nAll Assam Bengali Youth Students Federation Tinsukia district committee president Mrinmoy Das and general secretary Anup Biswas condemned the Silapathar incident and demanded that those who involved in this barbaric incident should be immediately arrested and strict punishment should be given to them. On the other, Margherita Regiol Students’ Union president Dipakar Borgohain and general secretary Bulbul Saikai, Asom Jatiyotabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, Margherita Regiol Committee president Salil Neog, secretary Bimal Singh and adviser Kanchan Bora, Asom Mahila Parishad Margherita District Committee former president Anita Das Mahanta (Putly), All Adivasi Students’ Association of Assam, Margherita Regiol Committee president Ramanus Lakra, All Assam Gorkha Students’ Union Margherita Regiol Committee secretary Shankar Jaisy, Assam Tea Labour Union Margherita Circle secretary Madhab Das and Federation of Barua Buddhist Welfare Association of Assam secretary general Sibu Talukdar have also condemned the Silapathar incident."
