        "text": "The Congregation of the Sisters of the Cross was born in 1838 at Chavanod, in the South East of France. Mother Claudine Echernier, with the help of Fr. Peter Mermier founded the congregation for educating the poor young girls. Many young girls joined Mother Claudine in this endeavour. Today, we have about 1350 sisters working in 15 countries of the world under nine provinces and three delegations. Our Charism is a special call to participate in the paschal mystery of Jesus dead and risen in His mission in the world for the salvation of all. Our founders have placed us under “the standard of the cross” (Fr. Mermier), “to make the good God known and loved” (Claudine Echernier). Our mission consists mainly on education, health, pastoral care, developmental programme, family visits, care for the physically handicapped and mentally challenged persons and youth animation programme\n\nAnimated by the apostolic zeal the sisters very soon crossed the boundaries, came to India in 1886, and began their missionary activities in Amaravati, they established a few house there and later on moved to the Southern part on India and opened many houses at Trichirapalli in 1901. In the year 1971 five of our sisters from Trichy Province came to North and began their work of evangelization and education at Ballia in U.P. in 1986 the Calcutta Province was formed and North East was an integral part of it. Later on in 1995 it became a Delegation and in the year 2006 it became a new Province – the Guwahati Province. We are very glad and proud to have Rev. Mercedes Chirayath as the first Provincial Superior of both Kolkata and Guwahati Province. We are happy to say that our Province has Sisters from South, North and Northeast and have 18 communities with 103 sisters working in Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura of which many are from Northeast.\n\nSilapathar Community, comes under the Guwahati Province, was established in the year 1985 and it completes its 35 years of service to the people of God through the medium of pastoral care, education and boarding. By the gracious invitation of Rt. Rev. Bishop Robert Kerketta, the then Bishop of Tezpur and at the request of Rev. Fr. Abraham Mullankuzhy, the then Provincial of MSFS fathers, our Sisters came here to collaborate with the fathers in the school, in the parish and hostel for the tribal girls. At the time of our arrival Rev. Fr. John Pauvath msfs, was the Parish Priest. Having the missionary spirit Sr. Edith, the then General Councillor, took the initiative to send Srs. Shanti, Elsy Joseph and Rosina as the pioneer missionaries of the community. We would like to express our profound appreciation for the pioneers who toiled hard to establish this mission along with the Provincials, Delegation Superiors, Superiors and the members. Since ours was the first Religious Sisters Congregation of this area, we also could get the opportunity to help the other mission stations like Gogamukh, Jonai and Dhemaji for the pastoral work and Evangelization.\n\nFollowing the footsteps of our founder, we look after the young girls in our hostel and help them to grow as well integrated persons of their family and of the society. We are proud to say that over the years we had been taking care of more than 1500 girls and now many of them are employed in different field of works and others are continuing with their studies. Our apostolate here was mainly to help in the field of education in school and we are glad to say that for the past 35 years more than forty sisters have contributed much for the growth of our students at Don Bosco High School Silapathar. It is also really a matter of joy for us to take care of the pastoral needs of the people in the village of Bijoypur and Bali and Milanpur.\n\nThis house at Silapathar remains as a transit house for everyone, especially for the Arunachal Missions. Our Sisters went ahead courageously facing all the difficulties and challenges of life, in order to proclaim the word of God to the people of Arunachal Pradesh by visiting and evangelizing the whole of West Siang District and some part of Upper Subansari.\n\nSt. Paul said, “I planted the seed, Apollo watered the plant, but it was God who made the plant grow”. So in the same way we would like to say that it was our pioneers who planted the seed of our community, our predecessors looked after it, but it was God who made this plant of our Community grow into a big tree with the new branches of service to the little angels in the Nursery from the year 2007 and in the S.F.S School from the year 2015 9th April onwards.\n\nWe the sisters of Silapathar feel proud of being part of Donbosco School at Silapathar.\n\nMay God continue to shower down His blessings upon all of us as the School has stepped on to the Golden platform of its service to the people of Silapathar."
