        "text": "About Silapathar College :\n\nThe Silapathar College was established in 1979 as a result of concerted efforts made by generous local public who were led by a group of academically ambitious leaders. It is the second oldest college in the district of Dhemaji, Assam. It is located in the heart of the rapidly growing small township of Silapathar which is surrounded by villages of tribal and backward communities. Thus, the college pledges to underline its target groups at the young men and women belonging to economically poor and socially excluded section of the society."
