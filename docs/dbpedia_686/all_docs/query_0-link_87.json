        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFormer Assam chief minister, Tarun Gogoi said that government has allowed Biswas to escape otherwise how can he escape from Silapathar with connectivity issues?\n\nGUWAHATI: While protest continued in different parts of Assam over vandalizing of the office of All Assam Students Union (Aasu), the student union has set 12 hour deadline for the arrest of the Subodh Biswa, the mastermind behind the mob attack on Aasu office on Monday.\n\nBiswas is the leader of Nikhil Bharat Bengali Udbastu Samanvay Rakhi Samiti and led the mob to attack Aasu office on Monday in Silapathar in Upper Assam. Assam government has declared Biswas as absconder following his role in the Aasu office incident.\n\nOn Wednesday there was protest in several colleges and universities across the state. Lorin Jyoti Gogoi, general secretary of Aasu told ET, “Biswas photographs with Union Home minister, Rajnath Singh and Union Minister for Road, Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari shows that he is well connected.”\n\nHe added that Biswas photographs with Assam BJP leaders including Himanta Biswa Sarma and Bijoya Chakraborty shows that he enjoyed government patronage. “It is sheer failure of the government to arrest Biswas despite elapse of two days of the incident. Biswas is enjoying protection of state’s home department. This incident was done to flare up communal feeling and there is large design.”\n\nFormer Assam chief minister, Tarun Gogoi said that government has allowed Biswas to escape otherwise how can he escape from Silapathar the area which has connectivity issues?\n\nGogoi also questioned, “There is big conspiracy. There is conspiracy of RSS behind the incident” There is need for judicial inquiry to unearth the truth, official inquiry by a bureaucrat will hardly help.”\n\nAkhil Gogoi, President of peasant organization, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) said, “Some BJP leaders have in recent times given provocative statements where they have justified the giving citizenship to Hindu Bengali from Bangladesh and has advocated in favour of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. The bill is a conspiracy hatched by RSS.”\n\nIn protest against the incident there is bandh in Dhemaji district. Several organizations have clamped indefinite bandh in Golaghat district.\n\nAssam Governor Banwarilal Purohit expressed grave concern over the vandalism incident. Purohit said, “Ransacking the AASU Office in Silapathar is an act of cowardice. I condemn the act.”\n\nHe also said that the perpetrators of the incident will be dealt with sternly as per the established law of the land.\n\nAlready police has picked up 11 persons in this connection, Assam Government by a notification has constituted a One Man Inquiry Committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary to the Government of Assam, Finance Department VB Pyarelal to inquire the circumstances leading to the incidence of violence erupted at Silapathar town.\n\nAccording to a state government statement the one man Inquiry Committee will ascertain the facts and circumstances leading to the said incidence of violence. “With due regard to the facts ascertained, the Committee will also ascertain whether any individual or organisation is involved in the violence, if so, will fix responsibility. It will also inquire whether this incidence was a part of larger conspiracy to disturb peace and tranquility in the State and to cause disaffection amongst different sections of the society.”\n\nThe Committee will ascertain whether there was any lapse on the part of Police and Civil Administration and if so, will fix responsibility. The Committee will also suggest measures for regulation of such violent protest causing law and order disruption and also loss of public and private property. The Committee will submit its report within 30 days.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWarren Buffett is selling Apple shares to hold on to cash.
