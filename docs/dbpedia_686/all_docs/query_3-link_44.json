It was an enriching learning experience, and it's incredible how my perspective has evolved over time. üìàüéä‚ú®Ô∏è This is not a farewell for me because I am carrying FAS with me wherever I go. üôã‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®Ô∏è This transition, while bittersweet, has opened my eyes to broader perspectives on life and the world around us. üåèüíô #Copywriting #Copyediting #ContentCareer #linkedincontent #linkedinforcreators #linkedingrowth #linkedincreators #phdlife #dissertation #dissertationwriting #research #phdthesis #englishlearning #englishlanguage #englishliterature #linkbuilding #teachertraining #linkedinlearning #IndianEnglishPoetry #EnglishLiterature #PoetsofIndia #poetrycommunity #poetry #poems #literaturereview #phdlife #literature #Literaturelovers #Lastday\n\nFacebook brought this memory to me. In 2019, I wrote an essay I titled Belonging, for the first issue of @downriverroadke my piece was luckily accepted and we were required to write an introduction. This üëáüèæ is what I wrote as an introduction to my essay. This essay was also the very first time I got paid for my writing so it's a very important essay to me. In it, I talk about my time growing up in an Indian estate in Eldoret town now city while going to school where I would first encounter other races. A lot of people get shocked that there's an existing estate in Eldoret called Westindies. Well, that's where we lived for 9 years from the time I was 8 until I was 17. We moved to Nakuru afterwards and it was about that time when the 2007/2008 Post Election Violence happened. We lived right in the middle of the chaos and while we were thankfully not affected, many around us were and every day we would see people moving with bundles of clothing (what they could quickly pack) while others moved into the homes of people they had just displaced in pick ups. It got so bad that there was a helicopter that hovered over our area with someone on a speaker warning us to stay indoors at daytime. Nakuru can get really messy when there is political chaos and at some point we started worrying how much longer we would be safe but thankfully, things cooled down. This essay for me was travelling down memory lane trying to unpack the many facets of belonging and my experiences with it. Much later, I included this essay in a collection of ten of my personal essays. It's my hope that this collection gets published in the near future. I have written a lot of nonfiction from 2013 to date. Much more than the fiction I have written and I am starting to toy with the idea of also studying Journalism. Maybe I will ü§î. We'll see. #essay #essaywriting #literature #nonfiction #journalism"
