        "text": "About the School Establishment: The school was established on 28th January, 1998. Inaugurated by Rev. Fr. Job Karikamapally, MSFS, the flag was hoisted by Sri Pradan Barua, Hon'ble MP, 14 Lakhimpur LAC (the then Hon'ble MLA, 114 Jonai (ST) Constituency with Leela Ram Newar, Associate Professor of Economics (the then Lecturer) as the founder Honorary Principal. Presently, Dambar Singh Newar is the Headmaster of the school. The school is named 'Lord Macaulay' only to acknowledge Thomas Babington Macaulay's contribution towards formalising English education in India way back in 1835. The name of the school merely bears a historical connotation and is used as a distinct trademark only to be at par with the names of contemporary English medium missionary schools. We neither believe nor propogate Macaulay's philosophy. Location: The school is centrally located in Silapathar Town (about 0.53 kms east of the Main Road) along the southern side of the railway tracks at Signal Basti, Natun Mising Gaon in the district of Dhemaji, Assam. ilapathar is about 462 kms east of Dispur, the capital of Assam and about 7 kms south of Likabali District of Arunachal Pradesh. Management : The school is run by Advanced Education Society (AES-India) [Society for Educational Research & Development (SERD-India], an educational NGO. Other AES-India Group of Schools are Narendra Memorial High School, Silagaon, Society Lord Macaulay School, Society, Bokaina Central School, Khanamukh, Phulbari Lord Macaulay School, Phulbari. Mission : We believe in imparting quality education as investment for our nation's development. AES-India innovates indigenous techniques of educational reforms and implements them through it's Group of Schools as investment for human resource development of our country. India is our country and we are proud of being Indians. We teach our students to be patriotic. AES-India believes in secularism and detaches itself from preaching or propagating any particular religion. We mould our students to be tolerant to all religions, races and communities. Mother Teresa is the symbol of charity. We dispense free and concessional education to needy students under the scheme of Mother Teresa Studentship (MTS). Curriculum : The school prepares students for High School Leaving Certificate (HSLC) examination conducted by Board of Secondary Education, Assam (SEBA). UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE SCHOOL IN SILAPATHAR 1. Name of the school: No schools in Assam (possibly in India) has adopted the name of Macaulay. It automatically become undisputed trademark. 2. Assamese Assembly Prayer: The school adopted Assamese Assembly Prayer (as in Vercular Govt. schools) since inception. No English medium schools in Assam has done so. 3. NCC: The school obtained permission to start NCC from the competent authorities. No private schools in Assam could do so. (However, the NCC authorities denied permission after a decade) 4. RTE: The school was pioneer in dispensing concessional and free education to needy students in the form of Mother Teresa Studentship (MTS). It thus, became the forerunner before RTE was enforced in Assam. 5. CCE: The school was forerunner too in adopting CCE before SEBA introduced the system. 6. Uniform: The school adopted Saffron colour as its uniform. Again it's not seen in any schools in Assam. 7. School Timing: The school opened at 08.00 am. This was adopted in accordance with the national debate and thereby, consensus of having early working for eastern India. Other private schools in the district followed suit."
