        "text": "Dr. J. M. Prasad, the superintendent of Silapathar CHC is very eager to develop his hospital. He has just completed 1 year as the superintendent of this hospital. Silapathar CHC is located near the Silapathar town of Sissiborgaon block in Dhemaji district of Assam. Sissiborgaon is one of the 5 blocks in Dhemaji. It has an IHHL coverage of 48.29 % which is the second lowest among the 5 blocks.\n\nHealth services, Dhemaji declared Silapathar hospital a model CHC in the year 2014. It was an achievement for the hospital which was established almost 40-50 years back. Though it was a model hospital, some problems were there especially regarding WASH facilities in the Labour room, post natal ward, NBCC and the Operation theatre of the CHC. The running water of the hospital contains too much of iron and is unusable without filtering, which creates a huge problem for the hospital staff as well as for the patients. Moreover elbow tapes, which are very essential to maintain proper hygiene in the different wards, were not installed in the basins. Soaps were kept; but that too was not hygienic. It only became storage of germs after the usage of all the nurses and the doctors. No towel or any other such materials were not seen, which only represent the poor condition of the hygienic facilities of the hospital.\n\nThough Silapathar CHC was far better in case of infrastructure and other facilities; the CHC was lagging behind in case of WASH facilities.\n\nThe district SBCC consultant, UNICEF of Dhemaji visited Silapathar Model CHC on 23rd August, 2017. He visited the labour room, post natal ward, NBCC and the Operation theatre. He talked with the superintendent of the hospital, Dr. J. M. Prasad, regarding the WASH facilities of the hospital. ‚ÄúWe never thought over these issues before. But now we will definitely work on this within a very short period of time‚Äù said the superintendent.\n\nPhoto: Dr. J. M. Prasad, Superintendent, Silapathar model CHC.\n\nThe SBCC consultant suggested them to use elbow tapes in all the basins and told the benefits of using it. He also advised them to keep a liquid hand washing soap instead of soap and a towel near each basin. Moreover he discussed with the superintendent about the running water problem of the hospital. The SBCC consultant told the Assistant matron and other nurses to teach hygiene issues to the patients as much as possible.\n\nThe superintendent took the suggestions from the consultant very seriously and started working on it soon. The consultant visited the hospital again on 10th October, 2017. After the visit to all the sites (labour room, post natal ward, NBCC, operation theatre), he was amazed to see the change in the wards. All the basins were installed with elbow tapes. Liquid hand washing soap and towels were placed near all the basins. The NBCC, which did not even have basin or any other source of water supply, now have a new basin and all other cleaning materials near it. A new sand filter is being constructed and about to be completed. This will definitely solve the dirty water issue to a certain extent. Now the hospital looks like a perfect model CHC from every angle.\n\nPhoto: New look of the WASH facilities in Silapathar Model CHC.\n\nWhen asked about this massive change, Dr. J. M. Prasad, the superintendent said ‚ÄúWe did not even realize these issues before the visit of the UNICEF‚Äôs consultant. Now the staff is very happy and satisfied.‚Äù He acknowledged the UNICEF‚Äôs support for the health centers in Dhemaji.\n\nJaya Saikia, the assistant matron of the hospital said ‚Äúpublic is not aware on WASH issues. But we are trying our best to aware them.‚Äù She also did not forget to mention the activeness of the superintendent and the other nurses.\n\nTo maintain the cleanliness at the hospital was a challenge in itself for the hospital authority since the local public is not aware of cleanliness in public places. The doctors and nurses are doing their best to maintain the clean environment of the hospital. One more challenge was that the elbow tapes were not available in Dhemaji so they had to hire those from Guwahati. So it was not so easy for the Silapathar CHC to reach to the current position. It‚Äôs all happened under the leadership of the superintendent Dr. J. M. Prasad. So he along with all the hospital staff are deserved to be praised for this achievement.\n\nPhoto: Silapathar model CHC, Silapathar.\n\nThis case of success will surely impact other hospitals of the district in achieving the SBM goals to make a ‚ÄòSwachh Dhemaji‚Äô.\n\n‚úíÔ∏èAnkur Protim Dutta, District SBCC & Monitoring coordinator, Dhemaji\n\nüìû8876807545\n\nEmail: ankurdutta318@gmail.com"
