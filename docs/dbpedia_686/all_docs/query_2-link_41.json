        "text": "Dhemaji district is an administrative district in the state of Assam in India. The district headquarters are located at Dhemaji. The district occupies an area of 3237 sq.km and has a population of 688,077 (as of 2011 Census). It is one of the districts situated in the remote corner of North East India on the north bank of river Brahmaputra. The boundaries of the district are the hilly ranges of Arunachal Pradesh to the North and the East, Lakhimpur district in the West and the river Brahmaputra in the South.\n\nThe river Brahmaputra flows from east to west in the southern part of the district. Different tributaries viz, Dihingia, Jiadhal, Moridhal, Telijan, Kaitongjan, Laipulia Nadi, Kapurdhuwa, Sissi, Gai, Tangani and Guttong originating from Arunachal Pradesh in the north, flow southwest carrying enormous amount of alluvium through the district before meeting the river Brahmaputra. The district is vulnerable to floods and occurrences of floods are a regular feature, which causes a lots of damages. Nearly 27% of the net cropped is flood prone as well as flood affected. The soil of the district is mainly alluvial and sandy. The riverbeds are generally higher than the level of land.\n\nIt is believed that in 1240 A.D.; (approx). The first King of Ahom reign Chow Chukafa established his capital at a place named Haboong in the district of Dhemaji. Due to perennial flood in the area the King shifted the capital from Haboong and after that the area became under the rule of Chutias and it continued from 1223 to 1523 A.D. During 1523 A.D. the then Ahom King Chuhung - Moong attacked and kill the Chutia king Natipal and as a result the area again became under the kingdom of Ahoms. The entire Dhemaji district area was originally inhabitated by various indigeneous tribes like Mising, Sonowal Kachari, Bodo Kachari, Deori and Laloong. In addition to this different tribes e.g. Ahom, Rabha, Tai - Khamti, Konch, Keot, Koiborta, Brahman, Kayastha, Kalita etc. were migrated during different moments of time span.\n\nInitially, the present geographical area of Dhemaji district was a part of the then Lakhimpur District with its headquarter at Dibrugarh. In 1971 Dhemaji was declared as a Sub-Division, Including Jonai and Dhakuakhana (Presently under Lakhimpur District) 14th Aug/1st Oct, 1989 Dhemaji was declared as an independent district covering Jonai and Dhemaji (Sadar) Sub-Divisions.\n\nRiverbank erosion during high flood period in the valley is a regular annual feature. Over bank flood due to breaches in the embankment render the fertile cultivable land unsuitable for crop production due to deposition of coarse sand on the surface to a variable depth. As per Assam Government Revenue Dept. records, an area of 6116 hectares of land was affected by soil erosion in Upper Brahmaputra Valley and North Bank Plain zone during 1994.\n\nHeavy pressure exerted by high floodwater on the embankment wash away the weaker portions of the embankments and inundates the nearby areas with consequent effect of heavy silt and sand deposition on the fertile cultivated fields.\n\nAttraction Of Dhemaji District :\n\n1) Gerukamukh : Gerukamukh is located at a distance of 44 Km from the district Head Quarter in the North-West direction. Regular communication is available from Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Guwahati. At Gerukamukh Sobansiri, the largest tributary of Brahmaputra touches the plains from the hills giving a scenic beauty with its virginity. The condition is favourable for angling and picnic parties. National Hydro Electric Power Corporation is implementing a mega hydro electric power project at Gerukamukh.\n\n2) Malini Than : This place has been using for worship to the Goddess Malini from ancient time. Lots of historical monuments have also been excavacated from the spot. It is located 42 kms away in the north eastern direction of Dhemaji.\n\n3) Ghuguha Dol : It is historically believed that at this place Bamuni Konwar The son of then Ahom King Tyao Khamti was born. The Dol (Temple) Was built in the memory of Bamuni Konwar's mother Ghuguhi and is at a distance of 17 km in south west of Dhemaji.\n\n4) Maa Manipuri Than : This Than (i.e. place of worship) distance of 25 km in the south west direction of Dhemaji was established by the then Ahom King Gourinath Singha as a monument of help by the Manipuries in controlling Mua-Mariah renaissance during the later period of Ahom reign.\n\n5) Rajgarh Ali : A road constructed by Prince Gohain Kamal during Konch reigm and is at a distance of 22 km from Dhemaji.\n\nEconomy Of Dhemaji District :\n\nThe economy of Dhemaji is generally agro-based. Sericulture, fishing and driftwood business are practiced in smaller scale. However, sand deposition and other adverse effects of chronic floods on fertile agricultural land have made even affluent farmers land-less. Therefore a large number of such people shift to greener pastures within the district to carry out horticultural practices. Lack of good communication system, shortage of power and lack of proper irrigation & marketing facilities add to the poverty of the district. Dearth of any major and small industry worth the name is also responsible for multiplying the problem of unemployment while galloping explosion in the rate of population growth has already shown signs of negative impacts. The local economy is thus characterized by subsistence level of production and consumption.\n\nEducation in Dhemaji District :\n\n1) Dhemaji College : Dhemaji College was established in the year 1965.
