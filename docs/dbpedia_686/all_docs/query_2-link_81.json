The composition of population in and around Silapathar area comprises mainly Scheduled Tribes (70%),10% Scheduled Caste and other economically, socially and educationally backward communities. They rendered valuable contributions to the foundation and development of the college. It is noteworthy to mention here that Silapathar College is one of the premier educational institutions of the district imparting Under Graduate and Higher Secondary level of education in Arts stream. Now, it is focusing its attention vigorously on maintaining high standard and quality of education to its ever increasing student community despite its limited resources and infrastructure facilities. The College Management Body is also deeply examining the necessity and probability of expanding its vision by introducing Post Graduate Programmes in certain departments considering the difficulties faced by the students in surface communication during floods, which is a recurring phenomenon in this part of the country. We are also trying our best to generate resourceful man power to its optimum level so that we can build this college as an excellent centre of higher learning and research in the days to come."
