The Lingzi Foundation was established by the family of Lu Lingzi, the Boston University graduate student who perished during the Boston Marathon bombing attack, to preserve and perpetuate Lingzi’s life example. ReadBoston, the City’s early literacy program, collaborated with the Boston Police Department (BPD) on four events at Boston Public Schools to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month in Lingzi’s memory. ReadBoston carefully selected four award-winning picture books by Asian American authors, of which the informal favorite was Watercress written by Andrea Wang, and illustrated by Jason Chin. Seven police officers of Asian American heritage volunteered to read a book to a class. Each student received a copy of the book to keep and so did the participating classroom and the school's library. The children were also given information on Boston Saves, the City’s children’s savings account program, to bring home. BPD provided stickers, bookmarks, and tips on when to call the police.

The Foundation provides opportunities to those who share Lingzi’s ambition and dreams to enrich their lives, open their minds, and break down barriers by learning from her positive spirit, unparalleled work ethic, perseverance, and humanism. ReadBoston extends its gratitude for the Foundation’s generosity, as well as to the dedicated police officers who gave their time to create a memorable enriching experience for these children: Superintendent Jimmy Chin, Officer May Chen, Officer Will Chen, Officer Lawrence Li, Lieutenant Detective Stephen Moy, Officer Kat Shea, Sergeant Detective Joey Tse, and especially Officer Lauren Woods, who serves on the Foundation’s Board and does all the behind-the-scenes planning and recruitment for these events.
