        "text": "Zebrafish CaV2.1 Calcium Channels Are Tailored for Fast Synchronous Neuromuscular Transmission\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNaranjo, David; Wen, Hua; Brehm, Paul\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe CaV2.2 (N-type) and CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) voltage-dependent calcium channels are prevalent throughout the nervous system where they mediate synaptic transmission, but the basis for the selective presence at individual synapses still remains an open question. The CaV2.1 channels have been proposed to respond more effectively to brief action potentials (APs), an idea supported by computational modeling. However, the side-by-side comparison of CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 kinetics in intact neurons failed to reveal differences. As an alternative means for direct functional comparison we expressed zebrafish CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 Î±-subunits, along with their accessory subunits, in HEK293 cells. HEK cells lack calcium currents, thereby circumventing the need for pharmacological inhibition of mixed calcium channel isoforms present in neurons. HEK cells also have a simplified morphology compared to neurons, which improves voltage control. Our measurements revealed faster kinetics and shallower voltage-dependence of activation and deactivation for CaV2.1. Additionally, recordings of calcium current in response to a command waveform based on the motorneuron AP show, directly, more effective activation of CaV2.1. Analysis of calcium currents associated with the AP waveform indicate an approximately fourfold greater open probability (PO) for CaV2.1. The efficient activation of CaV2.1 channels during APs may contribute to the highly reliable transmission at zebrafish neuromuscular junctions.

The pore-forming Î±1C subunit is regulated by accessory CavÎ² subunits, cytoplasmic proteins of various size encoded by four different genes (CavÎ²1 - Î²4) and expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Methods and Results Here we investigated the effect of three major CavÎ² types, Î²1b, Î²2d and Î²3, on the structure of Cav1.2 in the plasma membrane of live cells. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that the tendency of Cav1.2 to form clusters depends on the type of the CavÎ² subunit present. The highest density of Cav1.2 clusters in the plasma membrane and the smallest cluster size were observed with neuronal/cardiac Î²1b present. Cav1.2 channels containing Î²3, the predominant CavÎ² subunit of vascular smooth muscle cells, were organized in a significantly smaller number of larger clusters. The inter- and intramolecular distances between Î±1C and CavÎ² in the plasma membrane of live cells were measured by three-color FRET microscopy. The results confirm that the proximity of Cav1.2 channels in the plasma membrane depends on the CavÎ² type. The presence of different CavÎ² subunits does not result in significant differences in the intramolecular distance between the termini of Î±1C, but significantly affects the distance between the termini of neighbor Î±1C subunits, which varies from 67 Ã with Î²1b to 79 Ã with Î²3. Conclusions Thus, our results show that the structural organization of Cav1.2 channels in the plasma membrane depends on the type of CavÎ² subunits present.

These channels are central to cardiac action potential propagation, neurotransmitter and hormone release, muscle contraction and calcium-dependent gene transcription. Over the past six years, the advent of high-resolution structural studies of CaV components from different isoforms and CaV modulators has begun to reveal the architecture that underlies the exceptionally rich feedback modulation that controls CaV action. These descriptions of CaV molecular anatomy have provided new, structure-based insights into the mechanisms by which particular channel elements affect voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI), calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) and calcium-dependent facilitation (CDF). The initial successes have been achieved through structural studies of soluble channel domains and modulator proteins and have proven most powerful when paired with biochemical and functional studies that validate ideas inspired by the structures.

Enhanced T-type channel activity, especially Cav3.2, contributes to disease states, including absence epilepsy. Interestingly, the intracellular loop connecting domains I and II (I-II loop) of Cav3.2 channels is implicated in the control of both surface expression and channel gating, indicating that this I-II loop plays an important regulatory role in T-type current. Here we describe that co-expression of this I-II loop or its proximal region (Î1-Cav3.2; Ser423âPro542) together with recombinant full-length Cav3.2 channel inhibited T-type current without affecting channel expression and membrane incorporation. Similar T-type current inhibition was obtained in NG 108-15 neuroblastoma cells that constitutively express Cav3.2 channels. Of interest, Î1-Cav3.2 inhibited both Cav3.2 and Cav3.1 but not Cav3.3 currents. Efficacy of Î1-Cav3.2 to inhibit native T-type channels was assessed in thalamic neurons using viral transduction. We describe that T-type current was significantly inhibited in the ventrobasal neurons that express Cav3.1, whereas in nucleus reticularis thalami neurons that express Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 channels, only the fast inactivating T-type current (Cav3.2 component) was significantly inhibited. Altogether, these data describe a new strategy to differentially inhibit Cav3 isoforms of the T-type calcium channels.

The effects of clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on recombinant Ca(v)3.1 T-type calcium channels heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells were examined using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. At a standard holding potential of -100 mV, clozapine inhibited Ca(v)3.1 currents with an IC(50) value of 23.7+/-1.3 microM in a use-dependent manner. However, 10 microM clozapine inhibited more than 50% of the Ca(v)3.1 currents in recordings at a more physiologically relevant holding potential of -75 mV. Clozapine caused a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of the Ca(v)3.1 channels, which is presumably the main mechanism accounting for the inhibition of the Ca(v)3.1 currents. In addition, clozapine slowed Ca(v)3.1 deactivation and inactivation kinetics but not activation kinetics. Clozapine-induced changes in deactivation and inactivation rates of the Ca(v)3.1 channel gating would likely facilitate calcium influx via Ca(v)3.1 T-type calcium channels. Thus, clozapine may exert its therapeutic and/or side effects by altering cell's excitability and firing properties through actions on T-type calcium channels.\n\nDivergent biophysical properties, gating mechanisms, and possible functions of the two skeletal muscle Ca(V)1.1 calcium channel splice variants.\n\nPubMed\n\nTuluc, Petronel; Flucher, Bernhard E\n\n2011-12-01\n\nVoltage-gated calcium channels are multi-subunit protein complexes that specifically allow calcium ions to enter the cell in response to membrane depolarization. But, for many years it seemed that the skeletal muscle calcium channel Ca(V)1.1 is the exception. The classical splice variant Ca(V)1.1a activates slowly, has a very small current amplitude and poor voltage sensitivity. In fact adult muscle fibers work perfectly well even in the absence of calcium influx. Recently a new splice variant of the skeletal muscle calcium channel Ca(V)1.1e has been characterized. The lack of the 19 amino acid exon 29 in this splice variant results in a rapidly activating calcium channel with high current amplitude and good voltage sensitivity. Ca(V)1.1e is the dominant channel in embryonic muscle, where the expression of this high calcium-conducting Ca(V)1.1 isoform readily explains developmental processes depending on L-type calcium currents. Moreover, the availability of these two structurally similar but functionally distinct channel variants facilitates the analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the unique current properties of the classical Ca(V)1.1a channel.\n\nCav1.2 and Cav1.3 Lâtype calcium channels independently control shortâ and longâterm sensitization to pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRadwani, Houda; LopezâGonzalez, Maria JosÃ©; Cattaert, Daniel; RocaâLapirot, Olivier; Dobremez, Eric; BoualiâBenazzouz, Rabia; EirÃ­ksdÃ³ttir, EmelÃ­a; Langel, Ãlo; Favereaux, Alexandre; Errami, Mohammed; Landry, Marc\n\n2016-01-01\n\nKey points Lâtype calcium channels in the CNS exist as two subunit forming channels, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, which are involved in shortâ and longâterm plasticity.We demonstrate that Cav1.3 but not Cav1.2 is essential for windâup.These results identify Cav1.3 as a key conductance responsible for shortâterm sensitization in physiological pain transmission.We confirm the role of Cav1.2 in a model of longâterm plasticity associated with neuropathic pain.Upâregulation of Cav1.2 and downâregultation of Cav1.3 in neuropathic pain underlies the switch from physiology to pathology.Finally, the results of the present study reveal that therapeutic targeting molecular pathways involved in windâup may be not relevant in the treatment of neuropathy. Abstract Shortâterm central sensitization to pain temporarily increases the responsiveness of nociceptive pathways after peripheral injury. In dorsal horn neurons (DHNs), shortâterm sensitization can be monitored through the study of windâup. Windâup, a progressive increase in DHNs response following repetitive peripheral stimulations, depends on the postâsynaptic Lâtype calcium channels. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, two Lâtype calcium channels are present, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, each displaying specific kinetics and spatial distribution. In the present study, we used a mathematical model of DHNs in which we integrated the specific patterns of expression of each Cav subunits. This mathematical approach reveals that Cav1.3 is necessary for the onset of windâup, whereas Cav1.2 is not and that synaptically triggered windâup requires NMDA receptor activation. We then switched to a biological preparation in which we knocked down Cav subunits and confirmed the prominent role of Cav1.3 in both naive and spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathy (SNL). Interestingly, although a clear mechanical allodynia dependent on Cav1.2 expression was observed after SNL, the amplitude of windâup was decreased\n\nExclusion of alternative exon 33 of CaV1.2 calcium channels in heart is proarrhythmogenic\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Guang; Wang, Juejin; Liao, Ping; Bartels, Peter; Zhang, Hengyu; Yu, Dejie; Liang, Mui Cheng; Poh, Kian Keong; Yu, Chye Yun; Jiang, Fengli; Yong, Tan Fong; Wong, Yuk Peng; Hu, Zhenyu; Huang, Hua; Zhang, Guangqin; Galupo, Mary Joyce; Bian, Jin-Song; Ponniah, Sathivel; Trasti, Scott Lee; Foo, Roger; Hoppe, Uta C.; Herzig, Stefan; Soong, Tuck Wah\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAlternative splicing changes the CaV1.2 calcium channel electrophysiological property, but the in vivo significance of such altered channel function is lacking. Structureâfunction studies of heterologously expressed CaV1.2 channels could not recapitulate channel function in the native milieu of the cardiomyocyte. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the role of alternative exon 33 of the CaV1.2 calcium channel in heart function. Exclusion of exon 33 in CaV1.2 channels has been reported to shift the activation potential â10.4 mV to the hyperpolarized direction, and increased expression of CaV1.2Î33 channels was observed in rat myocardial infarcted hearts. However, how a change in CaV1.2 channel electrophysiological property, due to alternative splicing, might affect cardiac function in vivo is unknown. To address these questions, we generated mCacna1c exon 33â/â-null mice. These mice contained CaV1.2Î33 channels with a gain-of-function that included conduction of larger currents that reflects a shift in voltage dependence and a modest increase in single-channel open probability. This altered channel property underscored the development of ventricular arrhythmia, which is reflected in significantly more deaths of exon 33â/â mice from Î²-adrenergic stimulation. In vivo telemetric recordings also confirmed increased frequencies in premature ventricular contractions, tachycardia, and lengthened QT interval. Taken together, the significant decrease or absence of exon 33-containing CaV1.2 channels is potentially proarrhythmic in the heart. Of clinical relevance, human ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy hearts showed increased inclusion of exon 33. However, the possible role that inclusion of exon 33 in CaV1.2 channels may play in the pathogenesis of human heart failure remains unclear.

This review focuses on the inhibition of CaV2 (N- and P/Q-type) Ca2+-channels by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which exerts important autocrine/paracrine control over synaptic transmission and neuroendocrine secretion. Voltage-dependent inhibition is the most widespread mechanism, and involves direct binding of the G protein Î²Î³ dimer (GÎ²Î³) to the Î±1 subunit of CaV2 channels. GPCRs can also recruit several other distinct mechanisms including phosphorylation, lipid signaling pathways, and channel trafficking that result in voltage-independent inhibition. Current knowledge of GÎ²Î³-mediated inhibition is reviewed, including the molecular interactions involved, determinants of voltage-dependence, and crosstalk with other cell signaling pathways. A summary of recent developments in understanding the voltage-independent mechanisms prominent in sympathetic and sensory neurons is also included.

It is also the primary calcium channel responsible for transmitter release at their presynaptic terminals in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. The P/Q channel, Cav2.1, the other major calcium channel responsible for transmitter release at mammalian synapses, represents only 15-20% of total calcium current in the general population of sensory neurons and makes a minor contribution to transmitter release at the presynaptic terminal. In the present study we identified a subpopulation of the largest nodose neurons (capacitance>50pF) in which, surprisingly, Cav2.1 represents over 50% of the total calcium current, differing from the remainder of the population. Consistent with these electrophysiological data, anti-Cav2.1 antibody labeling was more membrane delimited in a subgroup of the large neurons in slices of nodose ganglia. Data reported in other synapses in the central nervous system assign different roles in synaptic information transfer to the P/Q-type versus N-type calcium channels. The study raises the possibility that the P/Q channel which has been associated with high fidelity transmission at other central synapses serves a similar function in this group of large myelinated sensory afferents, including arterial baroreceptors where a high frequency regular discharge pattern signals the pressure pulse. This contrasts to the irregular lower frequency discharge of the unmyelinated fibers that make up the majority of the sensory population and that utilize the N-type channel in synaptic transmission.

The slope of the phase 4 depolarization of isolated rabbit sinus node tissue was significantly reduced by S(+)-efonidipine (1 Î¼M), slightly reduced by nifedipine (1 Î¼M), but was not affected by R(-)-efonidipine. S(+)-efonidipine (1 Î¼M), inhibited the expressed Ca(V)1.2, Ca(V)1.3 and Ca(V)3.1 channel currents by 75.7%, 75.3% and 94.0%, nifedipine 84.0%, 43.2% and 14.9%, and R(-)-efonidipine 30.0%, 19.6% and 92.8%, respectively. Thus, the prolongation of the phase 4 depolarization of the rabbit sinus node by S(+)-efonidipine may be explained by blockade of the Ca(V)1.3 channel current. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to validate the potential utility of blocking T-type calcium channels to reduce nociception, we explored the effects of intrathecally administered oligodeoxynucleotide antisenses, specific to the recently identified T-type calcium channel family (CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3), on reactions to noxious stimuli in healthy and mononeuropathic rats. Our results demonstrate that the antisense targeting CaV3.2 induced a knockdown of the CaV3.2 mRNA and protein expression as well as a large reduction of 'CaV3.2-like' T-type currents in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons. Concomitantly, the antisense treatment resulted in major antinociceptive, anti-hyperalgesic, and anti-allodynic effects, suggesting that CaV3.2 plays a major pronociceptive role in acute and chronic pain states. Taken together, the results provide direct evidence linking CaV3.2 T-type channels to pain perception and suggest that CaV3.2 may offer a specific molecular target for the treatment of pain.\n\nModulation of CaV2.1 channels by neuronal calcium sensor-1 induces short-term synaptic facilitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Jin; Leal, Karina; Magupalli, Venkat G; Nanou, Evanthia; Martinez, Gilbert Q; Scheuer, Todd; Catterall, William A\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFacilitation and inactivation of P/Q-type Ca2+ currents mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin binding to Ca(V)2.1 channels contribute to facilitation and rapid depression of synaptic transmission, respectively. Other calcium sensor proteins displace calmodulin from its binding site and differentially modulate P/Q-type Ca2 + currents, resulting in diverse patterns of short-term synaptic plasticity. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1, frequenin) has been shown to enhance synaptic facilitation, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We report here that NCS-1 directly interacts with IQ-like motif and calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminal domain of Ca(V)2.1 channel. NCS-1 reduces Ca2 +-dependent inactivation of P/Q-type Ca2+ current through interaction with the IQ-like motif and calmodulin-binding domain without affecting peak current or activation kinetics. Expression of NCS-1 in presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons has no effect on synaptic transmission, eliminating effects of this calcium sensor protein on endogenous N-type Ca2+ currents and the endogenous neurotransmitter release machinery. However, in superior cervical ganglion neurons expressing wild-type Ca(V)2.1 channels, co-expression of NCS-1 induces facilitation of synaptic transmission in response to paired pulses and trains of depolarizing stimuli, and this effect is lost in Ca(V)2.1 channels with mutations in the IQ-like motif and calmodulin-binding domain. These results reveal that NCS-1 directly modulates Ca(V)2.1 channels to induce short-term synaptic facilitation and further demonstrate that CaS proteins are crucial in fine-tuning short-term synaptic plasticity.\n\nModulation of voltage- and Ca2+-dependent gating of CaV1.3 L-type calcium channels by alternative splicing of a C-terminal regulatory domain.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Anamika; Gebhart, Mathias; Fritsch, Reinhard; Sinnegger-Brauns, Martina J; Poggiani, Chiara; Hoda, Jean-Charles; Engel, Jutta; Romanin, Christoph; Striessnig, JÃ¶rg; Koschak, Alexandra\n\n2008-07-25\n\nLow voltage activation of Ca(V)1.3 L-type Ca(2+) channels controls excitability in sensory cells and central neurons as well as sinoatrial node pacemaking. Ca(V)1.3-mediated pacemaking determines neuronal vulnerability of dopaminergic striatal neurons affected in Parkinson disease. We have previously found that in Ca(V)1.4 L-type Ca(2+) channels, activation, voltage, and calcium-dependent inactivation are controlled by an intrinsic distal C-terminal modulator. Because alternative splicing in the Ca(V)1.3 alpha1 subunit C terminus gives rise to a long (Ca(V)1.3(42)) and a short form (Ca(V)1.3(42A)), we investigated if a C-terminal modulatory mechanism also controls Ca(V)1.3 gating. The biophysical properties of both splice variants were compared after heterologous expression together with beta3 and alpha2delta1 subunits in HEK-293 cells. Activation of calcium current through Ca(V)1.3(42A) channels was more pronounced at negative voltages, and inactivation was faster because of enhanced calcium-dependent inactivation. By investigating several Ca(V)1.3 channel truncations, we restricted the modulator activity to the last 116 amino acids of the C terminus. The resulting Ca(V)1.3(DeltaC116) channels showed gating properties similar to Ca(V)1.3(42A) that were reverted by co-expression of the corresponding C-terminal peptide C(116). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed an intramolecular protein interaction in the C terminus of Ca(V)1.3 channels that also modulates calmodulin binding. These experiments revealed a novel mechanism of channel modulation enabling cells to tightly control Ca(V)1.3 channel activity by alternative splicing. The absence of the C-terminal modulator in short splice forms facilitates Ca(V)1.3 channel activation at lower voltages expected to favor Ca(V)1.3 activity at threshold voltages as required for modulation of neuronal firing behavior and sinoatrial node pacemaking.\n\nBio-inspired voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Tingting; He, Lin-Ling; Chen, Ming; Fang, Kun; Colecraft, Henry M\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCa(2+) influx via voltage-dependent CaV1/CaV2 channels couples electrical signals to biological responses in excitable cells. CaV1/CaV2 channel blockers have broad biotechnological and therapeutic applications. Here we report a general method for developing novel genetically encoded calcium channel blockers inspired by Rem, a small G-protein that constitutively inhibits CaV1/CaV2 channels. We show that diverse cytosolic proteins (CaVÎ², 14-3-3, calmodulin and CaMKII) that bind pore-forming Î±1-subunits can be converted into calcium channel blockers with tunable selectivity, kinetics and potency, simply by anchoring them to the plasma membrane. We term this method 'channel inactivation induced by membrane-tethering of an associated protein' (ChIMP). ChIMP is potentially extendable to small-molecule drug discovery, as engineering FK506-binding protein into intracellular sites within CaV1.2-Î±1C permits heterodimerization-initiated channel inhibition with rapamycin. The results reveal a universal method for developing novel calcium channel blockers that may be extended to develop probes for a broad cohort of unrelated ion channels.\n\nDistribution of calcium channel Ca(V)1.3 immunoreactivity in the rat spinal cord and brain stem.\n\nPubMed\n\nSukiasyan, N; Hultborn, H; Zhang, M\n\n2009-03-03\n\nThe function of local networks in the CNS depends upon both the connectivity between neurons and their intrinsic properties. An intrinsic property of spinal motoneurons is the presence of persistent inward currents (PICs), which are mediated by non-inactivating calcium (mainly Ca(V)1.3) and/or sodium channels and serve to amplify neuronal input signals. It is of fundamental importance for the prediction of network function to determine the distribution of neurons possessing the ion channels that produce PICs. Although the distribution pattern of Ca(V)1.3 immunoreactivity (Ca(V)1.3-IR) has been studied in some specific central nervous regions in some species, so far no systematic investigations have been performed in both the rat spinal cord and brain stem. In the present study this issue was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that the Ca(V)1.3-IR neurons were widely distributed across different parts of the spinal cord and the brain stem although with variable labeling intensities. In the spinal gray matter large neurons in the ventral horn (presumably motoneurons) tended to display higher levels of immunoreactivity than smaller neurons in the dorsal horn. In the white matter, a subset of glial cells labeled by an oligodendrocyte marker was also Ca(V)1.3-positive. In the brain stem, neurons in the motor nuclei appeared to have higher levels of immunoreactivity than those in the sensory nuclei. Moreover, a number of nuclei containing monoaminergic cells, for example the locus coeruleus, were also strongly immunoreactive. Ca(V)1.3-IR was consistently detected in the neuronal perikarya regardless of the neuronal type. However, in the large neurons in the spinal ventral horn and the cranial motor nuclei the Ca(V)1.3-IR was clearly detectable in first and second order dendrites. These results indicate that in the rat spinal cord and brain stem Ca(V)1.3 is probably a common calcium channel used by many kinds of neurons to facilitate the neuronal\n\nDysfunction of the CaV2.1 calcium channel in cerebellar ataxias\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRajakulendran, Sanjeev; Schorge, Stephanie; Kullmann, Dimitri M\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMutations in the CACNA1A gene are associated with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). CACNA1A encodes the Î±-subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel or CaV2.1, which is highly enriched in the cerebellum. It is one of the main channels linked to synaptic transmission throughout the human central nervous system. Here, we compare recent advances in the understanding of the genetic changes that underlie EA2 and SCA6 and what these new findings suggest about the mechanism of the disease.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a ubiquitous gasotransmitter, in itch signaling. We found that intradermal injection of H2S donors NaHS or Na2S, but not GYY4137 (a slow-releasing H2S donor), dose-dependently induced scratching behavior in a Î¼-opioid receptor-dependent and histamine-independent manner in mice. Interestingly, NaHS induced itch via unique mechanisms that involved capsaicin-insensitive A-fibers, but not TRPV1-expressing C-fibers that are traditionally considered for mediating itch, revealed by depletion of TRPV1-expressing C-fibers by systemic resiniferatoxin treatment. Moreover, local application of capsaizapine (TRPV1 blocker) or HC-030031 (TRPA1 blocker) had no effects on NaHS-evoked scratching. Strikingly, pharmacological blockade and silencing of Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel by mibefradil, ascorbic acid, zinc chloride or Cav3.2 siRNA dramatically decreased NaHS-evoked scratching. NaHS induced robust alloknesis (touch-evoked itch), which was inhibited by T-type calcium channels blocker mibefradil. Compound 48/80-induced itch was enhanced by an endogenous precursor of H2S (L-cysteine) but attenuated by inhibitors of H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine Î³-lyase and cystathionine Î²-synthase. These results indicated that H2S, as a novel nonhistaminergic itch mediator, may activates Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel, probably located at A-fibers, to induce scratching and alloknesis in mice.

CaM causes calcium-dependent inactivation and limits calcium entry, whereas CaBP1 blocks calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) and allows sustained calcium influx. Here, we combine isothermal titration calorimetry with cell-based functional measurements and mathematical modeling to show that these calcium sensors behave in a competitive manner that is explained quantitatively by their apo-state binding affinities for the IQ domain. This competition can be completely blocked by covalent tethering of CaM to the channel. Further, we show that Ca(2+)/CaM has a sub-picomolar affinity for the IQ domain that is achieved without drastic alteration of calcium-binding properties. The observation that the apo forms of CaM and CaBP1 compete with each other demonstrates a simple mechanism for direct modulation of CaV1 function and suggests a means by which excitable cells may dynamically tune CaV activity.

Sensitivity to zinc, nickel and ascorbate of native Cav3.2 channels is significantly impeded in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of this KI mouse. Importantly, we describe that this H191-dependent regulation has discrete but significant effects on the excitability properties of D-hair (down-hair) cells, a sub-population of DRG neurons in which Cav3.2 currents prominently regulate excitability. Overall, this study reveals that the native H191-dependent regulation of Cav3.2 channels plays a role in the excitability of Cav3.2-expressing neurons. This animal model will be valuable in addressing the potential in vivo roles of the trace metal and redox modulation of Cav3.2 T-type channels in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. Cav3.2 channels are T-type voltage-gated calcium channels that play important roles in controlling neuronal excitability, particularly in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons where they are involved in touch and pain signalling. Cav3.2 channels are modulated by low concentrations of metal ions (nickel, zinc) and redox agents, which involves the histidine 191 (H191) in the channel's extracellular IS3-IS4 loop. It is hypothesized that this metal/redox modulation would contribute to the tuning of the excitability properties of DRG neurons. However, the precise role of this H191-dependent modulation of Cav3.2 channel remains unresolved. Towards this goal, we have generated a knock-in (KI) mouse carrying the mutation H191Q in the Cav3.2 protein. Electrophysiological studies were performed on a subpopulation of DRG neurons, the D-hair cells, which express large Cav3.2 currents. We describe an impaired sensitivity to zinc, nickel and ascorbate of the T-type current in D-hair neurons from KI mice.

As such the channels play pivotal roles in many cellular functions including the triggering of neurotransmitter and hormone release by CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) and CaV2.2 (N-type) channels. It is well established that G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) orchestrate precise regulation neurotransmitter and hormone release through inhibition of CaV2 channels. Although the GPCRs recruit a number of different pathways, perhaps the most prominent, and certainly most studied among these is the so-called voltage-dependent inhibition mediated by direct binding of GÎ²Î³ to the Î±1 subunit of CaV2 channels. This article will review the basics of Ca(2+) -channels and G protein signaling, and the functional impact of this now classical inhibitory mechanism on channel function. It will also provide an update on more recent developments in the field, both related to functional effects and crosstalk with other signaling pathways, and advances made toward understanding the molecular interactions that underlie binding of GÎ²Î³ to the channel and the voltage-dependence that is a signature characteristic of this mechanism.\n\nCalmodulin regulates Cav3 T-type channels at their gating brake\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTaiakina, Valentina; Monteil, Arnaud; Piazza, Michael; Guan, Wendy; Stephens, Robert F.; Dieckmann, Thorsten; Guillemette, Joseph Guy; Spafford, J. David\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCalcium (Cav1 and Cav2) and sodium channels possess homologous CaM-binding motifs, known as IQ motifs in their C termini, which associate with calmodulin (CaM), a universal calcium sensor. Cav3 T-type channels, which serve as pacemakers of the mammalian brain and heart, lack a C-terminal IQ motif. We illustrate that T-type channels associate with CaM using co-immunoprecipitation experiments and single particle cryo-electron microscopy. We demonstrate that protostome invertebrate (LCav3) and human Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 T-type channels specifically associate with CaM at helix 2 of the gating brake in the IâII linker of the channels. Isothermal titration calorimetry results revealed that the gating brake and CaM bind each other with high-nanomolar affinity. We show that the gating brake assumes a helical conformation upon binding CaM, with associated conformational changes to both CaM lobes as indicated by amide chemical shifts of the amino acids of CaM in 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra. Intact Ca2+-binding sites on CaM and an intact gating brake sequence (first 39 amino acids of the IâII linker) were required in Cav3.2 channels to prevent the runaway gating phenotype, a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage sensitivities and faster gating kinetics. We conclude that the presence of high-nanomolar affinity binding sites for CaM at its universal gating brake and its unique form of regulation via the tuning of the voltage range of activity could influence the participation of Cav3 T-type channels in heart and brain rhythms. Our findings may have implications for arrhythmia disorders arising from mutations in the gating brake or CaM.

Despite the importance of such proteinâprotein interactions in VGIC function and assembly, their potential as sites for VGIC modulator development has been largely overlooked. Here, we develop meta-xylyl (m-xylyl) stapled peptides that target a prototypic VGIC high affinity proteinâprotein interaction, the interaction between the voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV) pore-forming subunit Î±-interaction domain (AID) and cytoplasmic Î²-subunit (CaVÎ²). We show using circular dichroism spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal titration calorimetry that the m-xylyl staples enhance AID helix formation are structurally compatible with native-like AID:CaVÎ² interactions and reduce the entropic penalty associated with AID binding to CaVÎ². Importantly, electrophysiological studies reveal that stapled AID peptides act as effective inhibitors of the CaVÎ±1:CaVÎ² interaction that modulate CaV function in an CaVÎ² isoform-selective manner. Together, our studies provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the use of proteinâprotein interaction inhibitors to control VGIC function and point to strategies for improved AID-based CaV modulator design.

The currents of both channels activate slowly; however, insertion of exon 29 in the adult splice variant CaV1.1a causes an â¼30-mV right shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Existing evidence suggests that the S3-S4 linker in repeat IV (containing exon 29) regulates voltage sensitivity in this voltage-sensing domain (VSD) by modulating interactions between the adjacent transmembrane segments IVS3 and IVS4. However, activation kinetics are thought to be determined by corresponding structures in repeat I. Here, we use patch-clamp analysis of dysgenic (CaV1.1 null) myotubes reconstituted with CaV1.1 mutants and chimeras to identify the specific roles of these regions in regulating channel gating properties. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the structure and/or hydrophobicity of the IVS3-S4 linker is critical for regulating voltage sensitivity in the IV VSD, but by itself cannot modulate voltage sensitivity in the I VSD. Swapping sequence domains between the I and the IV VSDs reveals that IVS4 plus the IVS3-S4 linker is sufficient to confer CaV1.1a-like voltage dependence to the I VSD and that the IS3-S4 linker plus IS4 is sufficient to transfer CaV1.1e-like voltage dependence to the IV VSD. Any mismatch of transmembrane helices S3 and S4 from the I and IV VSDs causes a right shift of voltage sensitivity, indicating that regulation of voltage sensitivity by the IVS3-S4 linker requires specific interaction of IVS4 with its corresponding IVS3 segment.

The recovery of Ca 2+ -dependent signal transduction on motor end plates (MEPs) and innervated muscle may directly reflect nerve regeneration following peripheral nerve injury. Although the functional significance of calcium channels and the levels of Ca 2+ signalling in nerve regeneration are well documented, little is known about calcium channel expression and its relation with the dynamic Ca 2+ ion distribution at regenerating MEPs. In the present study, end-to-side neurorrhaphy (ESN) was performed as an in vivo model of peripheral nerve injury. The distribution of Ca 2+ at regenerating MEPs following ESN was first detected by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and the specific localization and expression of Cav2.1 channels were examined by confocal microscopy and western blotting. Compared with other fundamental ions, such as Na + and K + , dramatic changes in the Ca 2+ distribution were detected along with the progression of MEP regeneration. The re-establishment of Ca 2+ distribution and intensity were correlated with the functional recovery of muscle in ESN rats. Furthermore, the re-clustering of Cav2.1 channels after ESN at the nerve terminals corresponded with changes in the Ca 2+ distribution. These results indicated that renewal of the Cav2.1 distribution within the presynaptic nerve terminals may be necessary for initiating a proper Ca 2+ influx and shortening the latency of muscle contraction during nerve regeneration.\n\nInhibitory gene expression of the Cav3.1 T-type calcium channel to improve neuronal injury induced by lidocaine hydrochloride.\n\nPubMed\n\nWen, Xianjie; Xu, Shiyuan; Zhang, Qingguo; Li, Xiaohong; Liang, Hua; Yang, Chenxiang; Wang, Hanbing; Liu, Hongzhen\n\n2016-03-15\n\nCav3.1 is a low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium channel that plays a key role in regulating intracellular calcium ion levels. In this study, we observed the effects of lidocaine hydrochloride on the pshRNA-CACNA1G-SH-SY5Y cells that silenced Cav3.1 mRNA by RNA interference, and investigated the roles of p38 MAPK in these effects. We constructed the pNC-puro-CACNA1G-SH-SY5Y cells and pshRNA-CACNA1G -SH-SY5Y cells by the RNA interference. All the cells were cultured with or without 10mM lidocaine hydrochloride for 24 h. The cell morphology, cell viability, Cav3.1 and p38 protein expression, cell apoptosis rate and intracellular calcium ion concentration were detected. We found that all cells treated with 10mM lidocaine hydrochloride for 24 h showed cellular rounding, axonal regression, and cellular floating. Compared with the cells in SH-SY5Y+Lido group and NC+Lido group, those in the RNAi+Lido group showed similar changes, but of smaller magnitude. Additionally, following lidocaine hydrochloride all cells displayed increased Cav3.1 and p38 MAPK protein, apoptosis rate, and intracellular calcium ion levels; however,these changes in the RNAi+Lido group were less pronounced than in the SH-SY5Y+Lido and NC+Lido groups. The cell viability decreased following lidocaine hydrochloride treatment, but viability of the cells in the RNAi+Lido group was higher than in the SH-SY5Y+Lido and NC+Lido groups. The results showed that Cav3.1 may be involved in neuronal injury induced by lidocaine hydrochloride and that p38 MAPK phosphorylation was reduced upon Cav3.1 gene silencing.

Here we addressed the functional and spatial interaction between BK and CaV1.3 channels, unique CaV1 channels that activate at low voltages. We found that when BK and CaV1.3 channels were co-expressed in the same cell, BK channels started activating near â50 mV, ~30 mV more negative than for activation of co-expressed BK and high-voltage activated CaV2.2 channels. In addition, single-molecule localization microscopy revealed striking clusters of CaV1.3 channels surrounding clusters of BK channels and forming a multi-channel complex both in a heterologous system and in rat hippocampal and sympathetic neurons. We propose that this spatial arrangement allows tight tracking between local BK channel activation and the gating of CaV1.3 channels at quite negative membrane potentials, facilitating the regulation of neuronal excitability at voltages close to the threshold to fire action potentials.

The analgesic Î±-conotoxin Vc1.1 acts through Î³-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors (GABABRs) to inhibit Cav2.2 channels. We investigated GABABR-mediated modulation by Vc1.1, a cyclized form of Vc1.1 (c-Vc1.1), and the GABABR agonist baclofen of human Cav2.1 or Cav2.3 channels heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. 50 ÂµM baclofen inhibited Cav2.1 and Cav2.3 channel Ba2+ currents by â¼40%, whereas c-Vc1.1 did not affect Cav2.1 but potently inhibited Cav2.3, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of â¼300 pM. Depolarizing paired pulses revealed that â¼75% of the baclofen inhibition of Cav2.1 was voltage dependent and could be relieved by strong depolarization. In contrast, baclofen or Vc1.1 inhibition of Cav2.3 channels was solely mediated through voltage-independent pathways that could be disrupted by pertussis toxin, guanosine 5â²-[Î²-thio]diphosphate trilithium salt, or the GABABR antagonist CGP55845. Overexpression of the kinase c-Src significantly increased inhibition of Cav2.3 by c-Vc1.1. Conversely, coexpression of a catalytically inactive double mutant form of c-Src or pretreatment with a phosphorylated pp60c-Src peptide abolished the effect of c-Vc1.1. Site-directed mutational analyses of Cav2.3 demonstrated that tyrosines 1761 and 1765 within exon 37 are critical for inhibition of Cav2.3 by c-Vc1.1 and are involved in baclofen inhibition of these channels. Remarkably, point mutations introducing specific c-Src phosphorylation sites into human Cav2.1 channels conferred c-Vc1.1 sensitivity. Our findings show that Vc1.1 inhibition of Cav2.3, which defines Cav2.3 channels as potential targets for analgesic Î±-conotoxins, is caused by specific c-Src phosphorylation sites in the C terminus.

A single calmodulin (CaM) molecule is tethered to the C-terminal alpha(1C)-LA/IQ region and mediates Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel. Ca(v)beta subunits are stably associated with the alpha(1C)-interaction domain site of the cytoplasmic linker between internal repeats I and II and also interact dynamically, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with the alpha(1C)-IQ region. Here, we describe a surprising discovery that coexpression of exogenous CaM (CaM(ex)) with alpha(1C)/alpha(2)delta in COS1 cells in the absence of Ca(v)beta subunits stimulates the plasma membrane targeting of alpha(1C), facilitates calcium channel gating, and supports Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Neither real-time PCR with primers complementary to monkey Ca(v)beta subunits nor coimmunoprecipitation analysis with exogenous alpha(1C) revealed an induction of endogenous Ca(v)beta subunits that could be linked to the effect of CaM(ex). Coexpression of a calcium-insensitive CaM mutant CaM(1234) also facilitated gating of Ca(v)beta-free Ca(v)1.2 channels but did not support Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Our results show there is a functional matchup between CaM(ex) and Ca(v)beta subunits that, in the absence of Ca(v)beta, renders Ca2+ channel gating facilitated by CaM molecules other than the one tethered to LA/IQ to support Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Thus, coexpression of CaM(ex) creates conditions when the channel gating, voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation, and plasma-membrane targeting occur in the absence of Ca(v)beta. We suggest that CaM(ex) affects specific Ca(v)beta-free conformations of the channel that are not available to endogenous CaM.\n\nExpression of voltage-activated calcium channels in the early zebrafish embryo.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanhueza, DayÃ¡n; Montoya, Andro; Sierralta, Jimena; Kukuljan, Manuel\n\n2009-05-01\n\nIncreases in cytosolic calcium concentrations regulate many cellular processes, including aspects of early development. Calcium release from intracellular stores and calcium entry through non-voltage-gated channels account for signalling in non-excitable cells, whereas voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) are important in excitable cells. We report the expression of multiple transcripts of CaV, identified by its homology to other species, in the early embryo of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, at stages prior to the differentiation of excitable cells. CaV mRNAs and proteins were detected as early as the 2-cell stages, which indicate that they arise from both maternal and zygotic transcription. Exposure of embryos to pharmacological blockers of CaV does not perturb early development significantly, although late effects are appreciable. These results suggest that CaV may have a role in calcium homeostasis and control of cellular process during early embryonic development.\n\nThe Calmodulin-Binding, Short Linear Motif, NSCaTE Is Conserved in L-Type Channel Ancestors of Vertebrate Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 Channels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTaiakina, Valentina; Boone, Adrienne N.; Fux, Julia; Senatore, Adriano; Weber-Adrian, Danielle\n\n2013-01-01\n\nNSCaTE is a short linear motif of (xWxxx(I or L)xxxx), composed of residues with a high helix-forming propensity within a mostly disordered N-terminus that is conserved in L-type calcium channels from protostome invertebrates to humans. NSCaTE is an optional, lower affinity and calcium-sensitive binding site for calmodulin (CaM) which competes for CaM binding with a more ancient, C-terminal IQ domain on L-type channels. CaM bound to N- and C- terminal tails serve as dual detectors to changing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, promoting calcium-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channels. NSCaTE is absent in some arthropod species, and is also lacking in vertebrate L-type isoforms, Cav1.1 and Cav1.4 channels. The pervasiveness of a methionine just downstream from NSCaTE suggests that L-type channels could generate alternative N-termini lacking NSCaTE through the choice of translational start sites. Long N-terminus with an NSCaTE motif in L-type calcium channel homolog LCav1 from pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis has a faster calcium-dependent inactivation than a shortened N-termini lacking NSCaTE. NSCaTE effects are present in low concentrations of internal buffer (0.5 mM EGTA), but disappears in high buffer conditions (10 mM EGTA). Snail and mammalian NSCaTE have an alpha-helical propensity upon binding Ca2+-CaM and can saturate both CaM N-terminal and C-terminal domains in the absence of a competing IQ motif. NSCaTE evolved in ancestors of the first animals with internal organs for promoting a more rapid, calcium-sensitive inactivation of L-type channels.

In periphery, NPW was also present and regulated intracellular calcium homeostasis by L-type calcium channels. This study was designed to discover the effects of NPW-GPR7 on the function of CaV1.2 calcium channels in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and vasotone of arterial vessels. By whole-cell patch clamp, we studied the effects of NPW-23, the active form of NPW, on the CaV1.2 channels in the heterologously transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and VSMCs isolated from rat. Living system was used to explore the physiological function of NPW-23 in arterial myogenic tone. To investigate the pathological relevance, NPW mRNA level of mesenteric arteries was measured in the hypertensive and normotensive rats. NPW's receptor GPR7 was coexpressed with CaV1.2 channels in arterial smooth muscle. NPW-23 increased the ICa,L in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and VSMCs via GPR7, which could be abrogated by phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, not protein kinase A or protein kinase G inhibitor. After NPW-23 application, the expression of pan phospho-PKC was increased; moreover, intracellular diacylglycerol level, the second messenger catalyzed by PLC, was increased 1.5-2-fold. Application with NPW-23 increased pressure-induced vasotone of the rat mesenteric arteries. Importantly, the expression of NPW was decreased in the hypertensive rats. NPW-23 regulates ICa,L via GPR7, which is mediated by PLC/PKC signaling, and such a mechanism plays a role in modulating vascular myogenic tone, which may involve in the development of vascular hypertension.\n\nCalcium channel-dependent molecular maturation of photoreceptor synapses.\n\nPubMed\n\nZabouri, Nawal; Haverkamp, Silke\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSeveral studies have shown the importance of calcium channels in the development and/or maturation of synapses. The Ca(V)1.4(Î±(1F)) knockout mouse is a unique model to study the role of calcium channels in photoreceptor synapse formation. It features abnormal ribbon synapses and aberrant cone morphology. We investigated the expression and targeting of several key elements of ribbon synapses and analyzed the cone morphology in the Ca(V)1.4(Î±(1F)) knockout retina. Our data demonstrate that most abnormalities occur after eye opening. Indeed, scaffolding proteins such as Bassoon and RIM2 are properly targeted at first, but their expression and localization are not maintained in adulthood. This indicates that either calcium or the Ca(V)1.4 channel, or both are necessary for the maintenance of their normal expression and distribution in photoreceptors. Other proteins, such as Veli3 and PSD-95, also display abnormal expression in rods prior to eye opening. Conversely, vesicle related proteins appear normal. Our data demonstrate that the Ca(V)1.4 channel is important for maintaining scaffolding proteins in the ribbon synapse but less vital for proteins related to vesicular release. This study also confirms that in adult retinae, cones show developmental features such as sprouting and synaptogenesis. Overall we present evidence that in the absence of the Ca(V)1.4 channel, photoreceptor synapses remain immature and are unable to stabilize.\n\nÏ-Conotoxin GVIA Mimetics that Bind and Inhibit Neuronal Cav2.2 Ion Channels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTranberg, Charlotte Elisabet; Yang, Aijun; Vette, Irina; McArthur, Jeffrey R.; Baell, Jonathan B.; Lewis, Richard J.; Tuck, Kellie L.; Duggan, Peter J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe neuronal voltage-gated N-type calcium channel (Cav2.2) is a validated target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

These consisted of a 125I-Ï-conotoxin GVIA displacement assay, a fluorescence-based calcium response assay with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and a whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology assay with HEK293 cells stably expressing human Cav2.2 channels. A subset of compounds were active in all three assays. This is the first time that compounds designed to be mimics of Ï-conotoxin GVIA and found to be active in the 125I-Ï-conotoxin GVIA displacement assay have also been shown to block functional ion channels in a dose-dependent manner.

CaBP1 inhibits Ca(V)1.2 calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) and introduces calcium-dependent facilitation (CDF). Here, we show that the ability of CaBP1 to inhibit Ca(V)1.2 CDI and induce CDF arises from interaction between the CaBP1 N-lobe and interlobe linker residue Glu94. Unlike CaM, where functional EF hands are essential for channel modulation, CDI inhibition does not require functional CaBP1 EF hands. Furthermore, CaBP1-mediated CDF has different molecular requirements than CaM-mediated CDF. Overall, the data show that CaBP1 comprises two structural modules having separate functions: similar to CaM, the CaBP1 C-lobe serves as a high-affinity anchor that binds the Ca(V)1.2 IQ domain at a site that overlaps with the CaÂ²+/CaM C-lobe site, whereas the N-lobe/linker module houses the elements required for channel modulation. Discovery of this division provides the framework for understanding how CaBP1 regulates Ca(V)s. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike the genes of other potential Î³ subunits identified by their homology to the stargazin gene, CACNG7 is a five-, and not four-exon gene whose mRNA encodes a protein we have designated Î³7. Expression of human Î³7 has been localized specifically to brain. N-type current through CaV2.2 channels was almost abolished when co-expressed transiently with Î³7 in either Xenopus oocytes or COS-7 cells. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry and western blots show that Î³7 has this effect by causing a large reduction in expression of CaV2.2 rather than by interfering with trafficking or biophysical properties of the channel. No effect of transiently expressed Î³7 was observed on pre-existing endogenous N-type calcium channels in sympathetic neurones. Low homology to the stargazin-like Î³ subunits, different gene structure and the unique functional properties of Î³7 imply that it represents a distinct subdivision of the family of proteins identified by their structural and sequence homology to stargazin.

In this review, the different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels are described and their physiologic roles and pharmacology are outlined. We describe the current uses of drugs interacting with the different calcium channel subtypes and subunits, as well as specific areas in which there is strong potential for future drug development. Current therapeutic agents include drugs targeting L-type CaV1.2 calcium channels, particularly 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. T-type (CaV3) channels are a target of ethosuximide, widely used in absence epilepsy. The auxiliary subunit Î±2Î´-1 is the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs, which are of value in certain epilepsies and chronic neuropathic pain. The limited use of intrathecal ziconotide, a peptide blocker of N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channels, as a treatment of intractable pain, gives an indication that these channels represent excellent drug targets for various pain conditions. We describe how selectivity for different subtypes of calcium channels (e.g., CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 L-type channels) may be achieved in the future by exploiting differences between channel isoforms in terms of sequence and biophysical properties, variation in splicing in different target tissues, and differences in the properties of the target tissues themselves in terms of membrane potential or firing frequency. Thus, use-dependent blockers of the different isoforms could selectively block calcium channels in particular pathologies, such as nociceptive neurons in pain states or in epileptic brain circuits. Of important future potential are selective CaV1.3 blockers for neuropsychiatric diseases, neuroprotection in Parkinsonâs disease, and resistant hypertension. In addition, selective or nonselective T-type channel blockers are considered potential therapeutic targets in epilepsy, pain, obesity, sleep, and\n\nA novel CaV2.2 channel inhibition by piracetam in peripheral and central neurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nBravo-MartÃ­nez, Jorge; Arenas, Isabel; Vivas, Oscar; Rebolledo-AntÃºnez, Santiago; VÃ¡zquez-GarcÃ­a, Mario; Larrazolo, Arturo; GarcÃ­a, David E\n\n2012-10-01\n\nNo mechanistic actions for piracetam have been documented to support its nootropic effects. Voltage-gated calcium channels have been proposed as a promising pharmacological target of nootropic drugs. In this study, we investigated the effect of piracetam on Ca(V)2.2 channels in peripheral neurons, using patch-clamp recordings from cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons. In addition, we tested if Ca(V)2.2 channel inhibition could be related with the effects of piracetam on central neurons. We found that piracetam inhibited native Ca(V)2.2 channels in superior cervical ganglion neurons in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) of 3.4 Î¼mol/L and a Hill coefficient of 1.1. GDPÎ²S dialysis did not prevent piracetam-induced inhibition of Ca(V)2.2 channels and G-protein-coupled receptor activation by noradrenaline did not occlude the piracetam effect. Piracetam altered the biophysical characteristics of Ca(V)2.2 channel such as facilitation ratio. In hippocampal slices, piracetam and Ï-conotoxin GVIA diminished the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and action potentials. Our results provide evidence of piracetam's actions on Ca(V)2.2 channels in peripheral neurons, which might explain some of its nootropic effects in central neurons.\n\nLocalization of the calcium channel subunits Cav1.2 (alpha1C) and Cav2.3 (alpha1E) in the mouse organ of Corti.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaka, N; Knipper, M; Engel, J\n\n2003-10-01\n\nVoltage-activated Ca2+ channels play an important role in synaptic transmission, signal processing and development. The immunohistochemical localization of Cav1.2 (alpha1C) and Cav2.3 (alpha1E) Ca2+ channels was studied in the developing and adult mouse organ of Corti using subunit-specific antibodies and fluorescent secondary antibodies with cochlear cryosections. Cav1.2 immunoreactivity has been detected from postnatal day 14 (P14) onwards at the synapses between cholinergic medial efferents and outer hair cells as revealed by co-staining with anti-synaptophysin and anti-choline acetyltransferase. Most likely the Cav1.2 immunoreactivity was located presynaptically at the site of contact of the efferent bouton with the outer hair cell which suggests a role for class C L-type Ca2+ channels in synaptic transmission of the medial efferent system. The localization of the second Ca2+ channel tested, Cav2.3, showed a pronounced change during cochlear development. From P2 until P10, Cav2.3 immunoreactivity was found in the outer spiral bundle followed by the inner spiral bundle, efferent endings and by medial efferent fibers. Around P14, Cav2.3 immunoreactivity disappeared from these structures and from P19 onwards it was observed in the basal poles of the outer hair cell membranes.\n\nRoles of Ca(v) channels and AHNAK1 in T cells: the beauty and the beast.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatza, Didi; Flavell, Richard A\n\n2009-09-01\n\nT lymphocytes require Ca2+ entry though the plasma membrane for their activation and function. Recently, several routes for Ca2+ entry through the T-cell plasma membrane after activation have been described. These include calcium release-activated channels (CRAC), transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Herein we review the emergence of a fourth new route for Ca2+ entry, composed of Ca(v) channels (also known as L-type voltage-gated calcium channels) and the scaffold protein AHNAK1 (AHNAK/desmoyokin). Both helper (CD4+) and killer (CD8+) T cells express high levels of Ca(v)1 alpha1 subunits (alpha1S, alpha1C, alpha1D, and alpha1F) and AHNAK1 after their differentiation and require these molecules for Ca2+ entry during an immune response. In this article, we describe the observations and open questions that ultimately suggest the involvement of multiple consecutive routes for Ca2+ entry into lymphocytes, one of which may be mediated by Ca(v) channels and AHNAK1.\n\nCalcium sensor regulation of the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel contributes to short-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nNanou, Evanthia; Sullivan, Jane M; Scheuer, Todd; Catterall, William A\n\n2016-01-26\n\nShort-term synaptic plasticity is induced by calcium (Ca(2+)) accumulating in presynaptic nerve terminals during repetitive action potentials. Regulation of voltage-gated CaV2.1 Ca(2+) channels by Ca(2+) sensor proteins induces facilitation of Ca(2+) currents and synaptic facilitation in cultured neurons expressing exogenous CaV2.1 channels. However, it is unknown whether this mechanism contributes to facilitation in native synapses. We introduced the IM-AA mutation into the IQ-like motif (IM) of the Ca(2+) sensor binding site. This mutation does not alter voltage dependence or kinetics of CaV2.1 currents, or frequency or amplitude of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs); however, synaptic facilitation is completely blocked in excitatory glutamatergic synapses in hippocampal autaptic cultures. In acutely prepared hippocampal slices, frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs and amplitudes of evoked EPSCs are unaltered. In contrast, short-term synaptic facilitation in response to paired stimuli is reduced by â¼ 50%. In the presence of EGTA-AM to prevent global increases in free Ca(2+), the IM-AA mutation completely blocks short-term synaptic facilitation, indicating that synaptic facilitation by brief, local increases in Ca(2+) is dependent upon regulation of CaV2.1 channels by Ca(2+) sensor proteins. In response to trains of action potentials, synaptic facilitation is reduced in IM-AA synapses in initial stimuli, consistent with results of paired-pulse experiments; however, synaptic depression is also delayed, resulting in sustained increases in amplitudes of later EPSCs during trains of 10 stimuli at 10-20 Hz. Evidently, regulation of CaV2.1 channels by CaS proteins is required for normal short-term plasticity and normal encoding of information in native hippocampal synapses.\n\nBeta-Estradiol Regulates Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Estrogen Receptors in Telocytes from Human Myometrium.\n\nPubMed\n\nBanciu, Adela; Banciu, Daniel Dumitru; Mustaciosu, Cosmin Catalin; Radu, Mihai; Cretoiu, Dragos; Xiao, Junjie; Cretoiu, Sanda Maria; Suciu, Nicolae; Radu, Beatrice Mihaela\n\n2018-05-09\n\nVoltage-gated calcium channels and estrogen receptors are essential players in uterine physiology, and their association with different calcium signaling pathways contributes to healthy and pathological conditions of the uterine myometrium. Among the properties of the various cell subtypes present in human uterine myometrium, there is increasing evidence that calcium oscillations in telocytes (TCs) contribute to contractile activity and pregnancy. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of beta-estradiol on voltage-gated calcium channels and estrogen receptors in TCs from human uterine myometrium and to understand their role in pregnancy. For this purpose, we employed patch-clamp recordings, ratiometric Fura-2-based calcium imaging analysis, and qRT-PCR techniques for the analysis of cultured human myometrial TCs derived from pregnant and non-pregnant uterine samples. In human myometrial TCs from both non-pregnant and pregnant uterus, we evidenced by qRT-PCR the presence of genes encoding for voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav3.1, Ca3.2, Cav3.3, Cav2.1), estrogen receptors (ESR1, ESR2, GPR30), and nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3). Pregnancy significantly upregulated Cav3.1 and downregulated Cav3.2, Cav3.3, ESR1, ESR2, and NCOA3, compared to the non-pregnant condition. Beta-estradiol treatment (24 h, 10, 100, 1000 nM) downregulated Cav3.2, Cav3.3, Cav1.2, ESR1, ESR2, GRP30, and NCOA3 in TCs from human pregnant uterine myometrium. We also confirmed the functional expression of voltage-gated calcium channels by patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging analysis of TCs from pregnant human myometrium by perfusing with BAY K8644, which induced calcium influx through these channels. Additionally, we demonstrated that beta-estradiol (1000 nM) antagonized the effect of BAY K8644 (2.5 or 5 µM) in the same preparations. In conclusion, we evidenced the presence of voltage-gated calcium channels and estrogen receptors in TCs from non-pregnant and pregnant human\n\nCompensatory T-type Ca2+ channel activity alters D2-autoreceptor responses of Substantia nigra dopamine neurons from Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channel KO mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoetschke, Christina; Dragicevic, Elena; Duda, Johanna; Benkert, Julia; Dougalis, Antonios; DeZio, Roberta; Snutch, Terrance P; Striessnig, Joerg; Liss, Birgit\n\n2015-09-18\n\nThe preferential degeneration of Substantia nigra dopamine midbrain neurons (SN DA) causes the motor-symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), especially the Cav1.3-subtype, generate an activity-related oscillatory Ca(2+) burden in SN DA neurons, contributing to their degeneration and PD. While LTCC-blockers are already in clinical trials as PD-therapy, age-dependent functional roles of Cav1.3 LTCCs in SN DA neurons remain unclear. Thus, we analysed juvenile and adult Cav1.3-deficient mice with electrophysiological and molecular techniques. To unmask compensatory effects, we compared Cav1.3 KO mice with pharmacological LTCC-inhibition. LTCC-function was not necessary for SN DA pacemaker-activity at either age, but rather contributed to their pacemaker-precision. Moreover, juvenile Cav1.3 KO but not WT mice displayed adult wildtype-like, sensitised inhibitory dopamine-D2-autoreceptor (D2-AR) responses that depended upon both, interaction of the neuronal calcium sensor NCS-1 with D2-ARs, and on voltage-gated T-type calcium channel (TTCC) activity. This functional KO-phenotype was accompanied by cell-specific up-regulation of NCS-1 and Cav3.1-TTCC mRNA. Furthermore, in wildtype we identified an age-dependent switch of TTCC-function from contributing to SN DA pacemaker-precision in juveniles to pacemaker-frequency in adults. This novel interplay of Cav1.3 L-type and Cav3.1 T-type channels, and their modulation of SN DA activity-pattern and D2-AR-sensitisation, provide new insights into flexible age- and calcium-dependent activity-control of SN DA neurons and its pharmacological modulation.\n\nCACNA1H missense mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alter Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel activity and reticular thalamic neuron firing.\n\nPubMed\n\nRzhepetskyy, Yuriy; Lazniewska, Joanna; Blesneac, Iulia; Pamphlett, Roger; Weiss, Norbert\n\n2016-11-01\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. In a recent study by Steinberg and colleagues, 2 recessive missense mutations were identified in the Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel gene (CACNA1H), in a family with an affected proband (early onset, long duration ALS) and 2 unaffected parents. We have introduced and functionally characterized these mutations using transiently expressed human Cav3.2 channels in tsA-201 cells. Both of these mutations produced mild but significant changes on T-type channel activity that are consistent with a loss of channel function. Computer modeling in thalamic reticular neurons suggested that these mutations result in decreased neuronal excitability of thalamic structures. Taken together, these findings implicate CACNA1H as a susceptibility gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nConditional Deletion of the L-Type Calcium Channel Cav1.2 in NG2-Positive Cells Impairs Remyelination in Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantiago GonzÃ¡lez, Diara A; Cheli, Veronica T; Zamora, Norma N; Lama, Tenzing N; Spreuer, Vilma; Murphy, Geoffrey G; Paez, Pablo M\n\n2017-10-18\n\nExploring the molecular mechanisms that drive the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) during the remyelination process is essential to developing new therapeutic tools to intervene in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To determine whether L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) are required for OPC development during remyelination, we generated an inducible conditional knock-out mouse in which the L-VGCC isoform Cav1.2 was deleted in NG2-positive OPCs (Cav1.2 KO ). Using the cuprizone (CPZ) model of demyelination and mice of either sex, we establish that Cav1.2 deletion in OPCs leads to less efficient remyelination of the adult brain. Specifically, Cav1.2 KO OPCs mature slower and produce less myelin than control oligodendrocytes during the recovery period after CPZ intoxication. This reduced remyelination was accompanied by an important decline in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and in the rate of OPC proliferation. Furthermore, during the remyelination phase of the CPZ model, the corpus callosum of Cav1.2 KO animals presented a significant decrease in the percentage of myelinated axons and a substantial increase in the mean g-ratio of myelinated axons compared with controls. In addition, in a mouse line in which the Cav1.2 KO OPCs were identified by a Cre reporter, we establish that Cav1.2 KO OPCs display a reduced maturational rate through the entire remyelination process. These results suggest that Ca 2+ influx mediated by L-VGCCs in oligodendroglial cells is necessary for normal remyelination and is an essential Ca 2+ channel for OPC maturation during the remyelination of the adult brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ion channels implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation may induce positive signals for myelin recovery. Voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs) are important for normal myelination by acting at several critical steps during oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) development.

Synaptic transmission depends critically on presynaptic calcium entry via voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels. Here we show that the functional expression of neuronal N-type CaV channels (CaV2.2) is regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We find that FMRP knockdown in dorsal root ganglion neurons increases CaV channel density in somata and in presynaptic terminals. We then show that FMRP controls CaV2.2 surface expression by targeting the channels to the proteasome for degradation. The interaction between FMRP and CaV2.2 occurs between the carboxy-terminal domain of FMRP and domains of CaV2.2 known to interact with the neurotransmitter release machinery. Finally, we show that FMRP controls synaptic exocytosis via CaV2.2 channels. Our data indicate that FMRP is a potent regulator of presynaptic activity, and its loss is likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunction in FXS.\n\nMolecular Interactions between Tarantula Toxins and Low-Voltage-Activated Calcium Channels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSalari, Autoosa; Vega, Benjamin S.; Milescu, Lorin S.; Milescu, Mirela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFew gating-modifier toxins have been reported to target low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium channels, and the structural basis of toxin sensitivity remains incompletely understood. Studies of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels have identified the S3bâS4 âpaddle motif,â which moves at the protein-lipid interface to drive channel opening, as the target for these amphipathic neurotoxins. Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels contain four homologous voltage sensor domains, suggesting multiple toxin binding sites. We show here that the S3âS4 segments within Cav3.1 can be transplanted into Kv2.1 to examine their individual contributions to voltage sensing and pharmacology. With these results, we now have a more complete picture of the conserved nature of the paddle motif in all three major voltage-gated ion channel types (Kv, Nav, and Cav). When screened with tarantula toxins, the four paddle sequences display distinct toxin binding properties, demonstrating that gating-modifier toxins can bind to Cav channels in a domain specific fashion. Domain III was the most commonly and strongly targeted, and mutagenesis revealed an acidic residue that is important for toxin binding. We also measured the lipid partitioning strength of all toxins tested and observed a positive correlation with their inhibition of Cav3.1, suggesting a key role for membrane partitioning.

We found that the acute application of PGB reduced the amplitude of EPSCs in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal blocking effect of approximately 30%. A clinical high-concentration dose of PGB (e.g., 500 Î¼M) blocked Cav2.1 channel-mediated currents and decreased their facilitation during a 100-Hz train, without changing their voltage-dependent activation. Furthermore, PGB also removed the inactivation of Cav2.1 channels at a clinically relevant low concentration of 100 Î¼M. These results suggest novel modulatory mechanisms mediated by the acute administration of PGB on fast excitatory synaptic transmission and might contribute to better understanding PGB anticonvulsant/analgesic clinical effects.

We have tested two different tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin AG213, and their inactive analogs, genistin and tyrphostin AG9. Bath application of genistein, but not genistin, decreased the T-type calcium current amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 24.7+/-2.0 microM. This effect of genistein was accompanied by deceleration of channel activation and acceleration of channel inactivation. Intracellular application of neither genistein nor genistin had a significant effect on the calcium current. Extracellular application of 50 microM tyrphostin AG213 and its inactive analogue, tyrphostin AG9, did not affect the current through the Ca(V)3.1 channel. The effect of genistein on the channel was also not affected by the presence of catalytically active PTK, p60(c-src) inside the cell. We have concluded that genistein directly inhibited the channel. This mechanism does not involve a PTK-dependent pathway. The alteration of the channel kinetics by genistein suggests an interaction with the voltage sensor of the channel together with the channel pore occlusion.\n\n[Human calcium channelopathies. Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in etiology, pathogenesis, and pharmacotherapy of neurologic disorders].\n\nPubMed\n\nWeiergrÃ¤ber, M; Hescheler, J; Schneider, T\n\n2008-04-01\n\nVoltage-gated calcium channels are key components in a variety of physiological processes. Within the last decade an increasing number of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channelopathies in both humans and animal models has been described, most of which are related to the neurologic and muscular system. In humans, mutations were found in L-type Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.4 Ca(2+) channels as well as the non-L-type Ca(v)2.1 and T-type Ca(v)3.2 channels, resulting in altered electrophysiologic properties. Based on their widespread distribution within the CNS, voltage-gated calcium channels are of particular importance in the etiology and pathogenesis of various forms of epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review we characterise the different human Ca(2+) channelopathies known so far, further illuminating basic pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical aspects.\n\nAlternative Splicing Generates a Novel Truncated Cav1.2 Channel in Neonatal Rat Heart*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiao, Ping; Yu, Dejie; Hu, Zhenyu; Liang, Mui Cheng; Wang, Jue Jin; Yu, Chye Yun; Ng, Gandi; Yong, Tan Fong; Soon, Jia Lin; Chua, Yeow Leng; Soong, Tuck Wah\n\n2015-01-01\n\nL-type Cav1.2 Ca2+ channel undergoes extensive alternative splicing, generating functionally different channels. Alternatively spliced Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels have been found to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner or under pathological conditions. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of alternative splicing in Cav1.2 channel, we systematically investigated the splicing patterns in the neonatal and adult rat hearts. The neonatal heart expresses a novel 104-bp exon 33L at the IVS3-4 linker that is generated by the use of an alternative acceptor site. Inclusion of exon 33L causes frameshift and C-terminal truncation. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of Cav1.233L channels expressed in HEK 293 cells did not detect any current. However, when co-expressed with wild type Cav1.2 channels, Cav1.233L channels reduced the current density and altered the electrophysiological properties of the wild type Cav1.2 channels. Interestingly, the truncated 3.5-domain Cav1.233L channels also yielded a dominant negative effect on Cav1.3 channels, but not on Cav3.2 channels, suggesting that CavÎ² subunits is required for Cav1.233L regulation. A biochemical study provided evidence that Cav1.233L channels enhanced protein degradation of wild type channels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Although the physiological significance of the Cav1.233L channels in neonatal heart is still unknown, our report demonstrates the ability of this novel truncated channel to modulate the activity of the functional Cav1.2 channels. Moreover, the human Cav1.2 channel also contains exon 33L that is developmentally regulated in heart. Unexpectedly, human exon 33L has a one-nucleotide insertion that allowed in-frame translation of a full Cav1.2 channel. An electrophysiological study showed that human Cav1.233L channel is a functional channel but conducts Ca2+ ions at a much lower level.

In addition, ZnT-1 has important regulatory functions, including inhibition of L-type calcium channels and activation of Raf-1 kinase. Here we studied the effects of ZnT-1 on the expression and function of T-type calcium channels. In Xenopus oocytes expressing voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV) 3.1 or CaV3.2, ZnT-1 enhanced the low-threshold calcium currents (I(caT)) to 182 Â± 15 and 167.95 Â± 9.27% of control, respectively (P < 0.005 for both channels). As expected, ZnT-1 also enhanced ERK phosphorylation. Coexpression of ZnT-1 and nonactive Raf-1 blocked the ZnT-1-mediated ERK phosphorylation and abolished the ZnT-1-induced augmentation of I(caT). In mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary), coexpression of CaV3.1 and ZnT-1 increased the I(caT) to 166.37 Â± 6.37% compared with cells expressing CaV3.1 alone (P < 0.01). Interestingly, surface expression measurements using biotinylation or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicated marked ZnT-1-induced enhancement of CaV3.1 surface expression. The MEK inhibitor PD-98059 abolished the ZnT-1-induced augmentation of surface expression of CaV3.1. In cultured murine cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cells), transient exposure to zinc, leading to enhanced ZnT-1 expression, also enhanced the surface expression of endogenous CaV3.1 channels. Consistently, in these cells, endothelin-1, a potent activator of Ras-ERK signaling, enhanced the surface expression of CaV3.1 channels in a PD-98059-sensitive manner. Our findings indicate that ZnT-1 enhances the activity of CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 through activation of Ras-ERK signaling. The augmentation of CaV3.1 currents by Ras-ERK activation is associated with enhanced trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane.\n\nDifferential Roles for L-Type Calcium Channel Subtypes in Alcohol Dependence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUhrig, Stefanie; Vandael, David; Marcantoni, Andrea; Dedic, Nina; Bilbao, Ainhoa; Vogt, Miriam A; Hirth, Natalie; Broccoli, Laura; Bernardi, Rick E; SchÃ¶nig, Kai; Gass, Peter; Bartsch, Dusan; Spanagel, Rainer; Deussing, Jan M; Sommer, Wolfgang H; Carbone, Emilio; Hansson, Anita C\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIt has previously been shown that the inhibition of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) decreases alcohol consumption, although the contribution of the central LTCC subtypes Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 remains unknown. Here, we determined changes in Cav1.2 (Cacna1c) and Cav1.3 (Cacna1d) mRNA and protein expression in alcohol-dependent rats during protracted abstinence and naive controls using in situ hybridization and western blot analysis. Functional validation was obtained by electrophysiological recordings of calcium currents in dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We then measured alcohol self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking in dependent and nondependent rats after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the LTCC antagonist verapamil, as well as in mice with an inducible knockout (KO) of Cav1.2 in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIÎ± (CaMKIIÎ±)-expressing neurons. Our results show that Cacna1c mRNA concentration was increased in the amygdala and hippocampus of alcohol-dependent rats after 21 days of abstinence, with no changes in Cacna1d mRNA. This was associated with increased Cav1.2 protein concentration and L-type calcium current amplitudes. Further analysis of Cacna1c mRNA in the CA1, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and central amygdala (CeA) revealed a dynamic regulation over time during the development of alcohol dependence. The inhibition of central LTCCs via i.c.v. administration of verapamil prevented cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking in alcohol-dependent rats. Further studies in conditional Cav1.2-KO mice showed a lack of dependence-induced increase of alcohol-seeking behavior. Together, our data indicate that central Cav1.2 channels, rather than Cav1.3, mediate alcohol-seeking behavior. This finding may be of interest for the development of new antirelapse medications.

It is believed that the particularly pronounced short-term facilitation of mossy fiber synapses makes granule cell bursting a very effective means of properly transferring information to CA3. However, the mechanism underlying the unique bursting behavior of mature granule cells is currently unknown. Here, we show that Cav3.2 T-type channels at the axon initial segment are responsible for burst firing of mature granule cells in rats and mice. Accordingly, Cav3.2 knockout mice fire tonic spikes and exhibit impaired bursting, synaptic plasticity and dentate-to-CA3 communication. The data show that Cav3.2 channels are strong modulators of bursting and can be considered a critical molecular switch that enables effective information transfer from mature granule cells to the CA3 pyramids.

H.; Muthmainah, M.; Indarto, D.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nGestational Hypertension is one of the three main causes of maternal mortality in Indonesia. Nifedipine which blockes the Cav1.2 calcium channel has frequently been used to treat gestational hypertension. However the efficacy of nifedipine has not been established yet and the prevalence of gestational hypertension is still high (27.1 %). Indonesian herbal plants have potential to be developed as natural drugs. Molecular docking, a computational method, is very often used to depict interaction between molecules and target receptor This study was therefore to identify Indonesian herbal plants that could inhibit the calcium channel in silico. This was a bioinformatics study with molecular docking approach. Three-dimensional structure of human calcium channel Cav1.2 was determined by modelling with rabbit calcium channel (ID:5GJW) as template and using the SWISS MODEL software. Nifedipine was used as a standard ligand and obtained from ZINC database with the access code ZINC19594578. Active compounds of Indonesian herbal plants were registered in HerbalDB database and their molecular structure was obtained from PubChem. Binding affinity of human Cav1.2 model-ligand complexes were assesed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 software and visualization of molecular conformation used Chimera 1.10 and PyMol 1.3 softwares. The Lipinskyâs rules of five were used to determine active compounds which fullfilled drug criteria. The human Cav1-2 model had 72.35% sequence identity with rabbit Cav1.1. Nifedipine bound to the human Cav1.2 model with -2.1 kcal/mol binding affinity and had binding sites at Gln1060, Phe1129, Ser1132, and Ile1173 residues. A lower binding affinity was observed in 8 phytochemicals but only obtusifolin 2-glucoside (-2.2 kcal/mol) had similar binding sites as nifedipin did. In addition, obtusifolin 2-glucoside met the Lipinsky criteria and the molecule conformation was similar with nifedipine. From the HerbalDB database, obtusifolin 2-glucoside is found in Tectona\n\nPhosphorylation sites in th"
