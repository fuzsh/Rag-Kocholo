        "text": "September & October 2024\n\nDover Quartet and Erinys Quartet | Europe\n\nThe award-winning Dover Quartet, Penelope P. Watkins Ensemble in Residence at Curtis, and the Erinys Quartet, fellowship quartet in the Nina von Maltzahn String Quartet Program, join forces for the Nights of Classical Music at the Gennadius Library in Athens, Greece. This September marks the eighth annual festival of concerts featuring musicians from the Curtis Institute of Music. Performances include an exciting array of repertoire, from Mozart to riveting new works to Mendelssohn’s majestic Octet for Strings.\n\nThe tour continues with a performance by the Erinys Quartet in Berlin, performing works by Mozart, Beethoven, and Saariaho.\n\nFall 2024\n\nCurtis Symphony Orchestra | East Coast\n\nDuring our Centennial Season, Curtis Symphony Orchestra will present two special tour performances featuring breathtaking alumni soloists and guest conductors.\n\nBeethoven, Brahms, and more\n\nNamed for the Erinyes (a.k.a. the Furies) from the Greek tragedy Oresteia by Aeschylus, and with roots in Estonia, Lithuania, Greece, the United States, and Finland, the acclaimed Erinys Quartet is the Nina von Maltzahn String Quartet-in-Residence at the Curtis Institute of Music. This fall, the prize-winning quartet joins internationally renowned violist and Curtis president and CEO Roberto Díaz (Viola ’84) and Avery Fisher Career Grant winner and GRAMMY-nominated cellist Peter Wiley (Cello ’74), Bruce Jay Gould, M.D. Chair at Curtis for three exhilarating performances as part of Curtis on Tour, the Nina von Maltzahn global touring initiative of Curtis, featuring Johannes Brahms’s ethereal String Sextet No. 2 in G major, Op. 36, and more.\n\nMichelle Cann and the Erinys Quartet\n\nPraised for their “superb performances” (The Millbrook Independent), the prize-winning Erinys Quartet, the Nina von Maltzahn String Quartet-in-Residence at Curtis, join forces with Eleanor Sokoloff Chair in Piano Studies, Michelle Cann, “a pianist of sterling artistry” (Gramophone), for a stunning recital of late Romantic chamber works by Ludwig Van Beethoven and Antonín Dvořák, performed alongside a 20th-century masterpiece by trailblazing composer and pianist Florence Price.\n\nThe concert opens with Beethoven’s exhilarating String Quartet in B-flat Major, Op. 18, No. 6, a work of transcendent lyricism and Haydnesque bravado, followed by Price’s haunting Fantasie nègre No. 1, a striking work that blends the richness of African-American folksong with western European classical styles. The afternoon/evening closes with Dvořák’s sublime Piano Quintet No. 2 in A Major Op. 81, written at the height of the young composer’s international fame.\n\nGuitar Quartet\n\nGRAMMY Award-winning guitarist and Curtis faculty member Jason Vieaux, internationally renowned violist and Curtis president and CEO Roberto Díaz (Viola ’84), and emerging professional artists from Curtis present a thrilling program for guitar and strings. A vibrant collision of global sounds, cultures, and sonic textures, the program begins with Spanish composer and pianist Manuel de Falla’s Suite populaire espagnole, followed by a fiery, crowd-pleasing set featuring two selections by Argentinian legend Ástor Piazzolla, Histoire du Tango and an arrangement of Oblivion, by Piazzolla specialist and bandoneon virtuoso Julien Labro.\n\nThe concert continues with acclaimed Curtis alumnus Zhou Tian’s (Composition ’05) 10-minute musical journey inspired by classical Chinese landscape paintings, Red Trees, Wrinkled Cliffs, and closes with Niccolò Paganini’s masterful Guitar Quartet in A minor, No. 15, M.S. 42, itself inspired by the expressive Romantic lyricism and jaw-dropping virtuosity of 18th century Italian opera.\n\nMay 2025\n\nGary Hoffman\n\nInternationally renowned cellist Gary Hoffman, the Nina and Billy Albert Chair in Cello Studies at Curtis joins some of the school’s esteemed alumni for a tour of Europe in the spring of 2025. A thrilling concert of iconic works and audience favorites, the program features one of Claude Debussy’s final compositions, the Sonata in D minor for Cello and Piano, an elegant, evocative work, at once dark, mysterious, meditative, and playfully whimsical.\n\nMaurice Ravel’s shimmering Piano Trio in A minor follows, a dreamlike work with echoes of jazz, Javanese gamelan, and courtly Baroque dances, all leading to a splashy finale. The concert closes with Gabriel Fauré’s deeply moving Piano Quartet No. 1 in C minor, Op. 15, widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated French chamber music works of the late 19th century.\n\nWinds and Strings Tour: Fall 2023 and Spring 2024\n\nNew York, N.Y.| BlogCritics: December 2023\n\n“[A] lively mix of periods and styles, and a testament to the high quality of Curtis’s program.”\n\nRead the full review\n\nCurtis Symphony Orchestra in the U.S.: Winter 2020\n\nDurham, N.C. | CVNC: February 6, 2020\n\n“The Curtis Symphony Orchestra is a young classical ensemble, uniquely gifted and well-trained, advancing in experience every day.
