His work has focused on speech act-level phenomena (mirativity, evidentiality, attitudinal expressions), event structure and nominal reference. He also maintains an areal-historical specialty in Sino-Tibetan languages of the Himalayas and East Asia, and a long-term commitment to language documentation in urban settings.",

For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
