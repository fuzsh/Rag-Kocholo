The properties of plant outer tissues (root, tuber, bulb and fruit peel, tree and shrub bark, leaf and stem trichomes) mimic to a great extent the ‘edge’ effect properties of different ecosystems, which suggests the possibility of the ‘edge’ effect being applicable to individual plant organisms. The most important characteristics of plant border tissues are intensive oxidant stress, high variability and biodiversity of protection mechanisms and high adsorption capacity. Wide variations in morphological, biochemical and mineral components of border tissues play an important role in the characteristics of plant adaptability values, storage duration of roots, fruit, tubers and bulbs, and the diversity of outer tissue practical application. The significance of outer tissue antioxidant status and the accumulation of polyphenols, essential oil, lipids and minerals, and the artificial improvement of such accumulation is described in connection with plant tolerance to unfavorable environmental conditions. Methods of plant ‘edge’ effect utilization in agricultural crop breeding, production of specific preparations with powerful antioxidant value and green nanoparticle synthesis of different elements have been developed. Extending the ‘edge’ effect phenomenon from ecosystems to individual organisms is of fundamental importance in agriculture, pharmacology, food industry and wastewater treatment processes.

Having been generally considered rare in many areas of the basin, such a long-term increase of records might assign to this basket star the putative role of a winner species in the context of climate changes. In the present study, we combined the overall literature information with the data available for the Ligurian Sea collected during extensive ROV campaigns conducted between 2012 and 2022 at a depth ranging from 20 to 123 m, to better understand the distribution and abundance of this species. The basket star was observed in almost the whole explored bathymetric range living on gorgonians (Eunicella cavolini, E. verrucosa, Paramuricea clavata, and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) and massive sponges (Aplysina cavernicola, Sarcotragus foetidus, Spongia lamella, and Axinella polypoides). In the considered period, the number of recorded specimens did not show a clear trend, but differences emerged over years and months. These variations were strongly correlated with rainfall amounts that, in oligotrophic waters, such as those of the Ligurian Sea, represent an important input of organic matter for these passive filter feeders, especially in the summertime.

However, the data on the zoogonid life cycles are scarce. In the present study, we elucidated and verified life cycles of the Zoogonidae from the White Sea. Using rDNA data, we showed that Pseudozoogonoides subaequiporus utilizes gastropods from the family Buccinidae as the first intermediate host and protobranch bivalves as the second one. This life cycle can be facultatively truncated: some cercariae of P. subaequiporus encyst within the daughter sporocysts. Molecular data also confirmed previous hypotheses on Zoogonoides viviapus life cycle with buccinid gastropods acting as the first intermediate hosts, and annelids and bivalves as the second intermediate hosts. We demonstrated the presence of short tail primordium in the developing cercariae of both species. Based on the reviewed and our own data, we hypothesize that the emergence of tailless cercariae in the evolution of the Zoogonidae is linked to the switch to non-arthropod second intermediate hosts, and that it possibly happened only in the subfamily Zoogoninae. Basally branching zoogonids have retained the ancestral second intermediate host and might have also retained the tail.

Here we have assembled 7620 records from 60 references regarding how plants are used for food among 14 ethnicities in northern Thailand. The uses are based on 1182 different plant species. Vegetables are the most common food category, which contributed more than 60% of all use-reports and involved nearly 900 species. This was followed by the dessert fruit category, which included about 350 species and over 1800 use-reports. The similarity among the different ethnicities was low and the number of uses and species recorded among different ethnicities were significantly related to the number of studies that had been conducted for each group. This implies that additional ethnobotanical studies are still needed in order to conserve and compile the valuable traditional knowledge related to food plants. Many exotic species are now an important part of traditional knowledge, whereas rare endemic species are uncommon among wild food plants. This situation leads to a loss of traditional knowledge about food plants and reduced awareness of their importance. As a key to using this great reservoir of food for local people, traditional knowledge related to local wild food plants can contribute to the zero-hunger goal of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). More studies on the nutrient content and health properties of these plants could lead to the development of new crops to meet present consumer demands.

The analysis revealed that the genus Azygia included four valid species: A. lucii, A. longa, A. hwangtsiyui, and A. sibirica n. sp. The distribution of the type species A. lucii was confirmed in the largest Russian rivers: the Volga and the Ob. The worms isolated from Perccottus glenii were determined as the Chinese species A. hwangtsiyui, according to the genetic data for the cox1 mtDNA gene, at 1.32–1.56%. The new species, Azygia sibirica n. sp, was described from Esox lucius in the Ob River and differentiated from the type species A. lucii by the smaller ovary, testes and prostatic sac, wider body, very narrow pharyngeal lumen and form of anterior margin of ovary. In addition, multivariate analysis and three methods for species delimitation (ABGD, GMYC, bPTP) showed the subdivision of A. lucii and A. sibirica n. sp. into two separate groups, one from the Volga River and another from the Ob River, respectively. To conclude, A. lucii infects Esox lucius in the western (European part of Russia, the Volga River basin), and northern (Western Siberia, the Ob River basin) parts of Russia; A. sibirica n. sp. has also been found to infect Esox lucius in the Ob River, while A. hwangtsiyui infects Perccottus glenii in the South of the Russian Far East (the Artymovka River basin).

Two of the studied biotopes are located in the boundaries of the city of Plovdiv (one in the central part, the other in a suburban residential area), and the third is located in the vicinity of the village of Orizare. Our working hypothesis is based on the assumption that urban and suburban sites are more severely affected by human activities than rural sites. However, according to our results, the population of P. ridibundus inhabiting Maritsa River in the central part of Plovdiv City, and that in the suburban zone, have found relatively good living conditions. Contrary to our expectations, the worst environmental conditions were observed in the rural zone, where anthropogenic stress related to intensive pastoral animal husbandry and crop farming was present. The absence of adult individuals in the rural site is also an indicator of unfavorable living conditions.

However, its mitogenome remains unknown. The mitogenome sequencing of M. coccopoma is completed in the present study. It has a 15,098 bp in length, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), along with a putative regulatory area. A substantial A+T bias was observed in the genome composition (68.2%), along with a negative AT (0.82) and GC (−0.136) skew. Compared to the gene sequence of the ground model of pan-crustacea, 13 gene clusters (or genes), such as 10 tRNAs and 3 PCGs, were observed in a different order. This was in line with the previously observed large-scale gene rearrangements of Balanomorpha. Among the 37 genes, the gene cluster (M-nad2-W-cox1-L2-cox2-D-atp8-atp6-cox3-G- nad3-R-N-A-E-S1) Balanomorpha was conserved. Furthermore, phylogeny analysis indicated that the existing Balanomorpha species family was divided into nine rearrangement patterns, supporting the polyphyly of Balanoidea.

Up-to-date, complex genetic analysis performed using a consistent molecular method is needed for population management as a tool to further validate and maintain the genetic diversity of the species. The identification of the genetic line when pedigree data are missing, as well as the identification of parentage and individuals, are crucial for this purpose. The aim of our research was to create a small but informative panel of SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) markers that can be used for routine genotyping of the European bison at low cost. In our study, we used a custom-designed microarray to genotype a large number of European bison, totaling 455 samples from two genetic lines. The results of this analysis allowed us to select highly informative markers. In this paper, we present an effective single nucleotide polymorphism set, divided into separate panels to perform genetic analyses of European bison, which is needed for population monitoring and management. We proposed a total of 20 SNPs to detect hybridization with Bos taurus and Bison bison, a panel of 50 SNPs for individuals and parentage identification, as well as a panel of 30 SNPs for assessing membership of the genetic line. These panels can be used together or independently depending on the research goal and can be applied using various methods.

Here, results on the role of microplastics in the dispersion of microbes from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems are presented. Data were obtained from microcosm experiments in which microplastics (plastic bags (BA), polyethylene bottles (BO), acrylic beads (BE), and cigarette butts (BU)) with their attached natural bacterial communities were inoculated in filtered and autoclaved lake water. The bacterial abundance on microplastics was estimated before inoculation using a protocol for the enumeration of sediment bacteria and ranged between 1.63 (BA) and 203.92 (BE) × 103 cells mm−2. Bacteria were released in the new medium, and their growth rates reached 5.8 d−1. In the attached communities, Beta- (21.4%) and Alphaproteobacteria (18.6%) were the most abundant classes, while in the free-living communities Gammaproteobacteria dominated (48.07%). Abundant OTUs (≥1%) of the free-living communities were associated with the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Ecidovorax, Delftia, Comamonas, Sphingopyxis, and Brevundimonas and members of the FCB group. Members of these genera are known to degrade natural or man-made organic compounds and have recently emerged as opportunistic pathogens. Thus, besides trophic transmission, microplastics can directly release bacteria in the environment, which could affect the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems.

Collectively referred to as prairie grouse, these birds are monitored and managed jointly by wildlife practitioners who face the novel challenge of conserving historically allopatric species in shared range. We reconstructed region-wide and route-specific prairie grouse population trends in the Sandhills, using a 63-year timeseries of breeding ground counts aggregated from old reports and paper archives. Our objective was to repurpose historical data collected for harvest management to address questions pertinent to the conservation of prairie grouse, species whose populations have declined precipitously throughout their respective ranges. Because we cannot change the sampling protocol of historical data to answer new questions, we applied 3 different methods of data analysis—traditional regional mean counts used to adjust harvest regulations, spatially implicit, site-specific counts, and spatially explicit trends. Prairie-chicken populations have increased since the 1950s, whereas sharp-tailed grouse populations have remained stable or slightly declined. However, each species exhibited unique shifts in abundance and distribution over time, and regional indices masked important aspects of population change. Our findings indicate that legacy data have the capacity to tell new stories apart from the questions they were collected to answer. By integrating concepts from landscape ecology—a discipline that emerged decades after the collection of our count data began—we demonstrate the potential of historical data to address questions of modern-day conservation concern, using prairie grouse as a case study.

As part of a national program to restore the ecosystem services that such reefs once provided and return this habitat from near extinction, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was selected for a large-scale shellfish reef construction project in this estuary. To assess the potential filtration capacity of the reef, estuary seston quality, mussel feeding behavior, and valve gape activity were quantified in the laboratory and field during winter and summer. In general, estuary water contained high total particulate concentrations (7.9–8.7 mg L−1). Standard clearance rates were greater in winter (1.9 L h−1; 17 °C) than in summer (1.3 L h−1; 25 °C), the latter producing extremely low absorption efficiencies (37%). Mussel valves remained open ~97% and ~50% of the time in winter and summer, respectively. They often displayed erratic behavior in summer, possibly due to elevated temperatures and the toxic microalgae Alexandrium spp. Despite numerous stressors, the reef, at capacity, was estimated to filter 35% of the total volume of the estuary over winter, incorporating 42.7 t of organic matter into mussel tissue. The reefs would thus make a substantial contribution to improving estuary water quality.

Therefore, the exploitation of PGPB in agriculture is feasible as it offers sustainable and eco-friendly approaches to maintaining soil health while increasing crop productivity. The vital key of PGPB application in agriculture is its effectiveness in colonizing plant roots and the phyllosphere, and in developing a protective umbrella through the formation of microcolonies and biofilms. Biofilms offer several benefits to PGPB, such as enhancing resistance to adverse environmental conditions, protecting against pathogens, improving the acquisition of nutrients released in the plant environment, and facilitating beneficial bacteria–plant interactions. Therefore, bacterial biofilms can successfully compete with other microorganisms found on plant surfaces. In addition, plant-associated PGPB biofilms are capable of protecting colonization sites, cycling nutrients, enhancing pathogen defenses, and increasing tolerance to abiotic stresses, thereby increasing agricultural productivity and crop yields. This review highlights the role of biofilms in bacterial colonization of plant surfaces and the strategies used by biofilm-forming PGPB. Moreover, the factors influencing PGPB biofilm formation at plant root and shoot interfaces are critically discussed. This will pave the role of PGPB biofilms in developing bacterial formulations and addressing the challenges related to their efficacy and competence in agriculture for sustainability.

Halophila baillonii is a small seagrass that has historically been only found in a few locations in the Caribbean and Atlantic coast of Brazil. In the past few decades H. baillonii has also been observed in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Very little is known about the relationship between the ETP populations and the Caribbean and Atlantic ones. To study their relationship, we used a hybrid capture approach targeting chloroplast loci on samples from Belize, Brazil, and the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Phylogenetic analyses resolved H. baillonii as monophyletic and placed the samples from Belize and Costa Rica in a clade sister to the Brazilian ones. The results clearly indicate that the ETP samples are very closely related to Belize and that the most likely explanation of its occurrence in the ETP is a recent introduction, possibly as a consequence of the opening of the Panama Canal.

Samples were collected with light traps in the “nortes” (February) and rainy (October) seasons of 2016, recording air temperature and relative humidity. The assemblages showed an abundance pattern clearly associated with the rainy season, and a high dissimilarity in their species composition. Species richness and abundance were significantly higher at lower altitudinal levels. The highest alpha diversity was recorded in the Flor de Azahar stream; beta diversity increased with altitude and made an important contribution to gamma diversity. These results suggest that temporal and altitudinal variations affect environmental variables, which influence the structure of Trichoptera assemblages. Temperature was the primary factor determining spatial and temporal distribution patterns of caddisfly assemblages in the study area. However, in the rainy season, this factor explained a smaller proportion of the observed changes. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate other environmental variables and explore other ecosystems to provide additional evidence on the factors affecting the diversity patterns of the Trichoptera in the Sierra de Juárez.

Moreover, they feed on a variety of gramineous plant species, including rye, barley, oat, maize, and millet. They are widely distributed in the European continent. The purpose of this review paper is two-fold; it summarizes the currently available data on the biological characteristics, the inflicted damage, and their European distribution and, in addition, we aimed to determine their economic importance, based on data available in the current literature. For the most important cereal bug species, we have collected data on their occurrence in Europe to provide a comprehensive picture of their distribution, and characterized them according to their temperature requirements at different life stages. We have also determined the degree of their attachment to wheat as their host plant, examining the synchronization between the pests and the life cycle of the plant. Finally, we compared their migration characteristics. All the above-mentioned characteristics were merged, in order to assess and rank the damage potential of each species.

Community ecologists and population geneticists often characterize the structure of metacommunities by partitioning variation (diversity) into the two following components using measures such as FST or GST and α- and β-diversity. The within-communities component is usually some average of (type, species, genetic) diversities within the communities, and the among-communities component is the additive or multiplicative complement of the overall diversity. Such an among-communities component lacks independent conceptual specification, a matter of long-standing dispute. Only if the two components are independently and commensurably specified can the central question of comparability be answered meaningfully. (2) Methods: A novel approach to overcoming this conceptual weakness identifies two principles of the partitioning of variation among communities (concentration and division) then relates these principles to the common notions of variation (diversity) within and among communities, distinguishes primary indicators to quantify the partitioning principles, transforms the indicators into conceptually independent measures (indices) of variation within and among communities, and by this attains their commensurability and thus comparability. The application of the methods to quantifying the effects of evolutionary mechanisms is outlined. (3) Results: Common approaches are corrected and extended. (a) Analyses of metacommunity/metapopulation structures that rely on apportionment or related indices and take its complement to be differentiation yield incomparable measures of variation within and among communities. (b) The common practice of partitioning the total diversity into additive or multiplicative components produces the inconsistent ranking of the two components. (c) Community concentration and division can result from elementary processes of adaptive differentiation and migration (gene flow) among communities, where the (commensurable) amounts of community concentration and division reflect the relative participation of these processes in metacommunity structuring and translate directly into the measures of diversity within and among communities. (d) The modelling of the contributions of the two partitioning principles to the metacommunity structure is restricted by the marginal distributions of types and community affiliation. (e) The model demonstrates the degree to which adaptational processes at the metacommunity level are mixtures of adaptational events within and among communities.

However, the introduction, spread, and invasion of some species go unnoticed for a long time. In Lithuania, such an alien plant is Cornus sanguinea subsp. australis, whose cryptic invasion has gone unnoticed due to its similarity to the native subsp. sanguinea. Cornus sanguinea subsp. australis is native to southeastern Europe and western Asia and is considered alien in other parts of Europe. This study, which was carried out between 2018 and 2022 in the territory of Lithuania, aimed to identify the distribution of the subsp. australis, as well as assess certain reproductive traits and its impact on the species diversity of the invaded communities. The results showed that the cryptic invasion of subsp. australis in Lithuania has been going on for several decades and is now well advanced. We found that the alien subspecies grows faster and that individuals in analogous habitats mature earlier than the native subsp. sanguinea. Furthermore, subsp. australis, compared to subsp. sanguinea, produces more flowers per inflorescence (84.0 ± 25.0 and 49.7 ± 20.9, respectively) and sets and ripens more fruits (25.6 ± 9.7 and 18.2 ± 7.6, respectively), which are among the most important factors for its further fast spread and invasion. The results of the vegetation analysis showed that the increase in abundance of both subspecies has a negative effect on species diversity in the community. However, the effect of the native subspecies on plant species diversity was negligible, while the effect of the alien subspecies was moderately negative and significant (r = −0.47; p < 0.05). Based on the results of the study, we can conclude that the alien subsp. australis performs better than the native subsp. sanguinea. Considering the current distribution and the drivers of dispersal, we suppose that subsp. australis will continue to spread rapidly in Lithuania and may pose a threat to the native subsp. sanguinea populations.

To understand the mechanism and distribution patterns of invasive alien herbs, we compared the altitude patterns of native and invasive alien herbs based on 105 plots in the Dayao Mountain National Nature Reserve. This study also compared the distribution patterns of new (introduced to China after 1900) and old (introduced to China before 1900) invasive alien herbs. In addition, we examined the effects of climatic factors and human activities on the distribution patterns of species richness. In our study, 151 native herbs species and 18 invasive alien herbs species were observed, of which 12 were new invasive alien herbs. Old invasive alien herbs occurred more frequently and occupied a wider range of altitudes than new invasive alien herbs. The richness of native herbs tended to decrease with increasing altitude, and the altitude patterns of the richness of all invasive herbs and new invasive alien herbs were hump-shaped. Based on an analysis using the linear mixed model, the results indicated that temperature was the main factor limiting the altitude patterns of native herbs, and that temperature and human activities were essential factors in the distribution and spread of all invasive alien herbs and new invasive alien herbs. The intensity of human interference is a crucial driver of the spread of new invasive alien herbs to higher altitudes.

Tests were performed with eDNA samples from the field as well as with artificial samples from the lab, where snails releasing cercariae were kept in aquariums. From two localities, Trichobilharzia was documented based on the release of cercariae from snails, enabling morphological species identification. In both cases, the corresponding species were detected via eDNA: Trichobilharzia szidati and Trichobilharzia physellae. Nonetheless, the stochasticity was high in the replicates. PCR tests with aquarium water into which the cercariae had been released allowed eDNA detection even after 44 days. As in the PCRs with eDNA samples from the field, positive results of these experiments were not obtained for all samples and replicates. PCR sensitivity tests with dilution series of T. szidati genomic DNA as well as of PCR amplification products yielded successful amplification down to concentrations of 0.83 pg/µL and 0.008 pg/µL, respectively. Our results indicate that the presumed species specificity of PCR primers may not be guaranteed, even if primers were designed for specific species. This entails misidentification risks, particularly in areas with incomplete species inventories.

This study addressed how depth influenced the structure (size and morphology) of rhodoliths and the abundance of associated floral and faunal epibionts across the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. Sampling was carried out at two sites within five regions (Brittany, Galicia, Madeira, Gran Canaria, and Principe Island), from temperate to tropical, covering a latitudinal gradient of 47°, in three depth strata (shallow, intermediate and deep), according to the rhodolith bathymetrical range in each region. Depth typically affected the rhodolith size at all regions; the largest nodules were found in the intermediate and deep strata, while rhodolith sphericity was larger at the shallow depth strata. Higher biomasses of attached macroalgae (epiphytes) were observed at depths where rhodoliths were larger. The abundance of epifauna was variable across regions and depth strata. In general, the occurrence, structure, and abundance of the associated biota across rhodolith habitats were affected by depth, with local variability (i.e., sites within regions) often displaying a more significant influence than the regional (large-scale) variation. Overall, this study showed that the rhodolith morphology and associated epibionts (flora and fauna) were mostly affected by depth, irrespective of latitude.

An optimization model of feed consumption was used for the calculations. In this model, efficiency of consumption depends on two parameters: efficiency of metabolic degradation of feed and efficiency of caterpillar biomass synthesis. Experiments were conducted regarding the feeding of caterpillars on the leaves of silver birch Betula pendula Roth. and needles of Siberian larch Larix sibirica Ldb. and Scotch pine Pinus sylvestris L. On the basis of the results of experiments, “costs” of the feed for females and males were calculated, the consumption efficiency of different types of feed was found, and the relationship between efficiency of feed consumption and female fecundity was determined. The proposed approach can be employed to assess feeding efficiency of insects in various habitats.

The newly documented population of P. oceanica presented a fragmented structure, consisting of nine patches found in a rocky shallow area surrounded by the invasive algae Rugulopteryx okamurae, with a total size of 61.14 m2. Shoots had a relatively small size (21.0 ± 2.9 cm) in comparison with centrally-distributed populations. The relatively small size of the plants, alongside the observed low shoot density (437 ± 42 shoots m−2) and leaf area index (4.8 ± 0.7 m2 m−2), may indicate that this meadow could be exposed to sub-optimal environmental conditions for plant development. By contrast, the meadow showed relatively high production rates (0.03 ± 0.01 leaf day−1 shoot−1) in comparison with other Mediterranean populations. The percentage of carbon in plant leaves was 38.73 ± 1.38%, while the nitrogen and C/N were 1.38 ± 0.37% and 29.93 ± 6.57, respectively. The documentation of this meadow extends the distribution of this species to the Mediterranean coast of Cadiz, making this region the place with the highest seagrass biodiversity (four species) in the Iberian Peninsula, and potentially in Europe. This exploratory study provides a baseline to examine the potential effects of climate change, anthropogenic disturbances or the presence of invasive species.

The diversity of shrew cestodes included 22 species from three families: Hymenolepididae, Dilepididae, and Mesocestoididae. In Paramushir, the diversity of shrew cestodes was substantially lower than in Kamchatka (14 and 22, respectively). In Kamchatka, three genera of cestodes (Novobrachylepis, Mathevolepis, Ditestolepis) were not found, but three species from genera Lineolepis, Staphylocystis, and Monocercus are possibly new species. The potential for endemic species and the unique characteristics of the cestode fauna on Kamchatka suggest that the peninsula may have been a refugium for shrews and their parasites in the last glacial maximum. In Kamchatka and Paramushir, two Nearctic species (Lineolepis parva and L. pribilofensis) were found, which indicates potential dispersal from North America. Most cestode species in Kamchatka were associated with the host shrew Sorex caecutiens, while in Paramushir most cestodes were associated with Sorex isodon. In Paramushir, shrews had higher prevalence of infection with cestodes than in Kamchatka. The dominant cestode taxa in shrews on Paramushir Island were species rare in Kamchatka. Conversely, the most abundant cestode species in shrews on Kamchatka were absent from the island fauna.

The value of species diversity is taken into account when assessing the ecological state and quality of the ecosystem. However, erroneous taxonomic identification distorts biodiversity signification and, consequently, prevents a clear understanding of ecological signals and traits. In this study, we presented the first data on Piscicola leech species diversity in the vast area of the Eastern Palaearctic. To avoid misidentifications, an integrated approach was applied, combining modern DNA-based and classical morphological methods. Previously, only one species of the genus, Piscicola geometra, was recorded in the whole of Siberia. We discovered three new species: Piscicola sibirica sp. nov., Piscicola khubsugulensis sp. nov. (Eastern Siberia) and Piscicola nordica sp. nov. (European Northeast). The species Piscicola pojmanskae was reduced to synonymy with Piscicola geometra, whose description was updated. Taxonomic adjustments allowed us to ascertain the eastern edge of the Piscicola geometra distribution and to understand the biogeography of the group as a whole. The Piscicola geometra range is limited to Western Siberia, while the widespread Piscicola sibirica sp. nov. and the purely Khovsgolian Piscicola khubsugulensis sp. nov. inhabit Eastern Siberia.

Scott, 1906 (Copepoda: Harpacticoida: Tetragonicipitidae) were reported from the intertidal sand of Jeju Island and Busan in Korea, Phyllopdopsyllus kitazimai Karanovic, 2017, Phyllopodopsyllus saywakimi sp. nov. and Phyllopodopsyllus similis sp. nov. The latter two were described here. Phyllopodopsyllus saywakimi sp. nov. collected from only Udo, Jeju is similar to a Pacific species from Costa Rica, Phyllopodopsyllus ancylus Mielke, 1992. However, P. saywakimi sp. nov. differs from the Costa Rica species in the body size, the number of armatures on the antenna, the length ratio of endo- and exopod of the mandible, and the chaetotaxy of the fifth female pereiopod and the sixth male pereiopod. The second new species, P. similis sp. nov., found in Busan and several localities of Jeju, significantly resembles the species complex related to Phyllopodopsyllus aegypticus Nicholls, 1944, which is widely distributed in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. P. similis sp. nov. can be distinguished from the P. aegypticus complex by the body size, the shape of the rostrum, the type of armatures, the length ratio of rami and armatures, and the chaetotaxy of the female P5. In addition to the species descriptions, partial fragments of small and large subunit ribosomal RNA genes, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I were provided. Using molecular markers, a phylogenetic analysis was also performed to estimate the relationships among the three Korean species of Phyllopodopsyllus for the first time.

Citizen science (CS) data have been used in quantitative ecology to analyse species ranges by means of species distribution models. We investigated the Italian distribution of five large saproxylic beetles (big five), to describe their niche space, paramount areas for their conservation, and conservation gaps. Methods. CS data from two projects, climate and environmental variables were used to produce Habitat suitability (HS) maps for each species and averaged HS maps. The big five’s conservation status was assessed interpolating HS maps with the distribution of protected areas, concomitantly identifying conservation gaps. Results. The pre-alpine and Apennines arcs, north-eastern Sicily and eastern Sardinia, were identified as conservation’s hotspots. Ranking HS levels from minimum to optimal, the extent of conservation gaps decreases as environmental suitability for the big five increases. Conclusions. For the first time in Italy, CS data have been used to investigate niche space of the largest protected saproxylic beetles and analyse the distribution of their suitable habitat. The resulting HS raster maps and vector layers, reporting HS value in all Italian protected areas (n° 3771), were provided and discussed, reporting an application example for conservation purposes.

Their importance is even higher when ecological indicator taxa are considered, as in the case of moths. In this work, we investigated macro-moth diversity in a forest area (30 ha) in the Western Italian Alps, recently subjected to intense management activities. Indeed, an ecological corridor, which includes 10 clearings, has been shaped thanks to forest compensation related to the construction site of the Turin–Lyon High-Speed Railway. Here, we identified 17 patches (9 clearings and 8 forests), and we conducted moth surveys using UV–LED light traps. A total of 15,614 individuals belonging to 442 species were collected in 2020 and 2021. Two and fifteen species are new records for Piedmont and for Susa Valley, respectively. In addition to the faunistic interest of the data, this study—using a standardized method—provides geo-referenced occurrences, species-richness, and abundance values useful to compile a baseline dataset for future comparisons. Indeed, the replicable and easy shareable method allows us to make comparisons with other research and thus assess the impact of environmental changes.

However, there is very little data on the composition of their abyssal harpacticoid fauna. On the basis of the samples collected in LB in 2010–2017 at a depth of 270–1632 m, analysis of the fauna composition and species diversity of harpacticoids in the deep-water zone is presented. Studies were conducted in all parts of the lake, including areas of a hydrothermal, oil–methane seeps, and mud volcanoes. Nineteen Baikal endemic morphological species of the genera Bryocamptus, Attheyella, and Moraria (Baikalomoraria) were found. A brief description of the taxa morphology is presented. The genus Bryocamptus was the richest by species number at the studied sites, and Bryocamptus smirnovi Borutzky was the most frequent. The most diverse (8 species) was the fauna of the Saint Petersburg methane seep. Studies have shown that the taxonomic diversity of harpacticoid copepods in the deep-water zone of LB is lower than in its littoral zone. According to two non-parametric species estimators (Chao 2 and Jackknife 1), a 1.5-fold increase of species richness of harpacticoids of the LB abyssal is expected.
