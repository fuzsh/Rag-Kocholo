        "text": "Symbiotic relationships in which different animal species interact socially with each other have arisen sporadically across the metazoan tree of life. Such relationships encompass a spectrum of dependency, from transient, facultative associations seen in mixed-species groups of insectivorous birds (Sridhar et al., 2009), cetaceans and ungulates (Stensland et al., 2003; Goodale et al., 2017), to obligate symbiotic lifestyles typified by brood parasitic cuckoos, cowbirds (Johnsgard, 1997), mutualistic cleaner fish (Grutter, 1999) and oxpeckers (Nunn et al., 2011). Of all animal groups, however, the complex societies of ants play host to the greatest diversity of behavioral symbionts. Several major radiations of myrmecophiles are known, each containing hundreds of symbiotic species, including the lycaenid butterflies (Pierce et al., 2002), eucharitid wasps (Murray et al., 2013), paussine ground beetles (Moore and Robertson, 2014) and multiple lineages of rove beetles (Kistner, 1979; Kistner, 1982; Parker, 2016; Parker and Grimaldi, 2014; Seevers, 1965; Maruyama and Parker, 2017). The diversity and often-broad geographic ranges of these clades imply that their relationships with ants are evolutionarily ancient (Parker and Grimaldi, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2016). Although fossil myrmecophiles are known from as far back as the Eocene (Parker and Grimaldi, 2014; Wasmann, 1929), ant eusociality is known to be at least twice as old, with the earliest definitively social ants occurring in Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber (Barden and Grimaldi, 2016). Whether their colonies were targeted by myrmecophiles has, however, been unclear: ants are comparatively scarce in Cretaceous ambers (Grimaldi and Agosti, 2000; LaPolla et al., 2013; Barden, 2016; Barden, 2018), and myrmecophilous invertebrates typically live at densities orders of magnitude lower than their hosts (Kistner, 1979). The unlikely discovery of a myrmecophile clown beetle in Burmese amber reveals that a major radiation of ant symbionts has its origins in Mesozoic ant societies.\n\nAnalysis of Promyrmister’s morphology and phylogenetic position indicates the new genus represents an extinct lineage within the crown-group of Haeteriinae, a clade of obligate myrmecophiles (Figure 2A,B; Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3; see Materials and methods). In haeteriine taxa for which detailed behavioral observations exist, the beetles have been shown to engage in intimate behaviors with ants, involving stomodeal trophallaxis (mouth-to-mouth feeding) (Wheeler, 1908; Henderson and Jeanne, 1990; Akre, 1968), grooming workers with their appendages (and being groomed or licked by hosts in return) (Akre, 1968), physically grasping onto ants (phoresis) (Akre, 1968; von Beeren and Tishechkin, 2017), or being carried around nests by workers (Kistner, 1982). Mimicry of colony cuticular hydrocarbons occurs (Lenoir et al., 2012), as well as chemical manipulation of host ants via ‘appeasement’ substances exuded from gland openings on the margins of the prothorax (Kistner, 1982; Seyfried, 1928) or in the postcoxal regions of the beetle’s underside (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Promyrmister appears to be closely allied to the extant genus Haeterius (Figure 2A–C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This genus and a handful of closely related taxa including Eretmotus, Sternocoelis and Satrapes comprise the only group of Haeteriinae known to occur in the Palaearctic, consistent with the Eurasian palaeolocality of Promyrmister in Burmese amber. Like all of these genera, Promyrmister exhibits classical haeteriine attributes that are thought to be true adaptations for myrmecophily, including broad expansions of the tibiae with spines on the outer margin (Figure 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), short tarsi received on the outer face of each tibia (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), a triangular antennal scape (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), pronounced antennal cavities on the prothoracic hypomeron (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D) and a broad proventral lobe to fully embrace the retracted head (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D). Those features are thought to be protective modifications that enable myrmecophile beetles to withstand handling by ant mandibles (Parker, 2016).\n\nWe and others have previously described rove beetles (Staphylinidae) in the Burmese palaeofauna that were putative symbionts of termite colonies (Yamamoto et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2017). These specimens exhibit a defensive ecomorphology and are thought to have been persecuted intruders that were not behaviorally integrated into their host’s societies (Yamamoto et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2017). In contrast, Haeteriinae embody a form of true behavioral symbiosis, where the relationship with host ants can involve social interactions (Figure 2D,E; Figure 4). The prothoracic glandular openings of Haeteriinae that secrete putative appeasement compounds are challenging to demonstrate even in extant taxa, but in the Promyrmister holotype, a large globule of possible exudate originates from the left margin of the prothorax, consistent with the position of such glands (Figure 1A,G). Additionally, Promyrmister possesses clear postcoxal secretory glands (Figure 1H; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B,D), with a globule of possible exudate emanating from the postcoxal gland opening on the right side of the body (Figure 1H; Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,D). Beyond Promyrmister’s phylogenetic position within the Haeteriinae clade, the fossil’s anatomy implies a chemical strategy to become accepted or at least tolerated inside colonies (hypothetical reconstruction in Figure 2F), akin to modern haeteriine species that have so far been examined (Akre, 1968; Lenoir et al., 2012; Seyfried, 1928).\n\nWhat were the Cretaceous host ants of Promyrmister? All ants thus far described from Burmese amber belong to stem-group Formicidae, including members of the extinct subfamily Sphecomyrminae and three other genera, Gerontoformica, Myanmyrma and Camelomecia that similarly lack crown-group features but are placed incertae sedis within Formicidae (Barden, 2016; Barden, 2018). In contrast, fossils of definitive crown-group ant subfamilies are absent, or vanishingly rare, among the thousands of ant inclusions now recovered from this amber deposit (Barden, 2016; McKellar et al., 2013) (P. Barden, personal communication). Crown-group ants are also unknown from contemporaneous Charentese amber (Barden, 2016). We posit that the overwhelming prevalence of stem-group ants in Burmese amber implies that they were potential hosts of Promyrmister (Figure 2F). Such a scenario entails that haeteriines may not have originated with the modern ant groups that host them today; instead myrmecophily evolved first in stem-group ant colonies, with the beetles later switching to crown-group ants. We cannot, however, rule out an alternative scenario, that an as-yet undiscovered diversity of crown-group ants were, in fact, present in the Burmese palaeofauna, and it was these that selected for the early evolution of myrmecophily. Molecular dating indicates that crown-group ants had originated by this time (Brady et al., 2006; Moreau and Bell, 2013; Borowiec et al., 2017a) (see dotted lines in Figure 3). If present in this ancient ecosystem, perhaps their cryptic biologies limited their entrapment in amber.\n\nWhether haeteriines evolved in stem- or crown-group ant colonies, their original hosts are presumably long-extinct. The present-day host associations of haeteriines imply that these myrmecophiles have host-switched between many modern ant lineages (Figure 3). The beetles have been recorded in colonies of ant species scattered across the subfamilies Dolichoderinae, Dorylinae, Formicinae, Myrmicinae and Ponerinae (Helava et al., 1985; Tishechkin, 2007) (Figure 3). We suggest that it is this capacity for host switching that may explain the great longevity of the clown beetle-ant symbiosis. Through host switching, the clade as a whole has circumvented potential coextinction with host ant lineages that disappeared from the Cretaceous to the present (Barden and Grimaldi, 2016; Barden, 2016). Moreover, in some cases, the beetles have radiated dramatically with certain ant groups: the vast majority of the contemporary species richness of Haeteriinae is found in taxa that have adapted to colonies of Neotropical army ants (Ecitonini), including at least 30 genera associated with Eciton army ants alone (Parker, 2016; Helava et al., 1985; von Beeren and Tishechkin, 2017; Tishechkin, 2007). Some of these haeteriines have remarkable adaptations for life in colonies of those nomadic ants (Figure 4). Neotropical army ants are thought to have begun diversifying approximately in the Oligocene (Brady et al., 2014; Borowiec et al., 2017b), implying that the bulk of haeteriine cladogenesis occurred within this window too, long after the beetles originated in the Cretaceous."
