        "text": "A Chinese student has been identified as the third person to have died in the Boston marathon bombings.\n\nBoston University confirmed that a statistics student, Lu Lingzi, 23, died when she was watching the race on Monday.\n\nChina's state newswire Xinhua said she been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated. The report did not reveal her full name, citing relatives' requests for anonymity.\n\nYet internet users on the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo have identified the girl and transformed her profile page into a de facto memorial. Her last post – published at 9am on Tuesday morning – has racked up almost 23,000 comments, flush with flickering candle emoticons and interspersed with flustered entreaties to honor her family's request.\n\n\"My wonderful breakfast!\" the post said, above a photo of a fruit salad.\n\nThe injured woman, Zhou Danling, also a Boston University student, has undergone two operations and is now in stable condition at a local hospital, Xinhua reported. Zhou graduated from Wuhan University in central China and is reading a graduate degree in actuarial science.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping \"expressed great concern\" for the students on Wednesday, according to Xinhua. \"Consulate officials said they are doing everything they can to help relatives of the victims come to the United States and tend their loved ones,\" the newswire said.\n\nAt least 85 people from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan participated in the race, none of them professional runners. China's state media reported widely on the tragedy, and most major web portals dedicated link-strewn \"special topic\" pages to relevant coverage."
