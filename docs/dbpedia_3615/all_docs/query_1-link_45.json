        "text": "D. T. Tamlong, IAS (Retd.)\n\nLepchas & Their Origin\n\nNomenclature ‘Lepcha’\n\nHeleen Plaisier, of Leiden University, in her article, ‘A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO LEPCHA ORTHOGRAPHY AND LITERATURE’, published in ‘Bulletin of Tibetology’ in vol. 41, no. 1 on page 7 of May 2005, writes, “The English name ‘Lepcha’ derives from Nepali Lapce or Lapca, which originally had a derogatory connotation of ‘inarticulate speech’. Nowadays, the term ‘Lepcha’ is widely used without this connotation. The Lepchas call themselves ‘Mutanchi Rongkup Rumkup’ ‘children of Rong and of God.’” This has been accepted by majority of Lepcha people and many writers have also supported this view.\n\nThere are no two opinions on the view that ‘Lepcha’ is derived from ‘LAPCHEY’ i.e. the name given by the Nepalese. Britishers started calling the Lepchas as LEPCHAS anglicizing the word LAPCHEY. K.P. Tamsang, in his ‘The Unknown and Untold Reality about the Lepchas’ on page 2, has written, “The name Lapchey is given to the Lepcha people by the Nepalese. Lapchey means scurrilous speakers, a very contemptuous term referring to the Lepchas and therefore this term needs to be condemned outright because it is most derogatory and unfavourable to the Lepchas, for, the Lepchas are in truth not scurrilous speakers. Because their language is the most simple and pure one and not a single abusive, indecent, obscene, slang, or vulgar word exists in the language as commonly found in all the other languages of the world”. All the Lepchas are in agreement with Tamsang in this respect as the Lepcha language in no way can be called ‘scurrilous’ as it is a sweet language. It is possible that some Nepalese, first meeting a Lepcha speaking a Lepcha word or trying to speak in Nepali (then a foreign language), found or perceived the uttering scurrilous.\n\nAll foreign languages sound funny or odd while hearing for the first time and trying to speak or utter the same is also a difficult task. That must have happened to a Nepalese also while hearing Lepchas speaking in their mother tongue or trying to speak Nepali. But the name has stuck. There are instances of people criticising fellow members or other persons when the latter speak with odd or wrong pronounciation. A typical Lepcha finds it difficult to speak in Nepali and it it is natural for him to make mistakes and thereby becoming an object of criticism. There are no ‘Bha’, ‘Gha’, ‘Jha’, ‘Dha’ etc. alphabets in Lepcha, and so instead of ‘Bhat’(‘rice’ in Nepali) the Lepchas utter ‘Bat’(‘talk’ in Nepali) and instead of ‘Ghans’( ‘grass’ in Nepali) they pronounce ‘Gans’ (‘morsel’ in Nepali) and so on. Similarly for ‘Dhan’ (riches or paddy in Nepali), Lepchas pronounce ‘Dan’ i.e, gift in Nepali. Further, there are some Lepcha words, the equivalent pronunciations of which are not found in Nepali and other languages. For example ‘Jo’ (rice) in Lepcha is pronounced some what like ‘Zo’ or ‘So’ for which there is no equivalent in Nepali. Similarly, Pazok (forest) in Lepcha has now become Peshok for the general majority of people. In such circumstances, there was bound to be criticism in the way a person spoke a foreign tongue.\n\nThe Lepchas call themselves ‘RONGs’ or ‘Rongkups’. Tamsang in the above mentioned book on page 1 said, “The Lepchas call themselves “Rongkup Rumkup” or in short “Rong”, which means “the son of the snowy peak, the son of God”. Sanchita Ghatak in the book, ‘People of India, Sikkim’ on page 89, has written, “The Lepchas call themselves ‘Rong-Kup’ or ‘Mutanchi Rongkup’. ‘Rong’ meaning both ‘to wait’ and ‘peak’, ‘Mutanchi Rongkup’ means ‘Mother’s loved ones’; mother here standing for Mother as creator whom Lepchas call Itbumoo. The Lepchas are also called ‘Monpas’ by the Tibetans, the Kirata tribe of low land. Bhutias call them ‘Maris’ which means the same thing.” A.K.Das in ‘The Lepchas of Darjeeling District’ on page 4 says, “Lepchas call themselves ‘Rong’ meaning thereby the dwellers of rocky land and the term ‘Rong’ has been derived from the word ‘Rinjong’, meaning rockland full of respectable people.” But the word ‘Renjong’ in Lepcha is formed of ‘Ren’ (respected) and ‘jong’ (like). ‘Renjong’, therefore, means a respectable person as will be explained in subsequent chapter.\n\nRen Suryaman Lepcha has added one more version which was told to him by the older ‘Pastor Tingbu’ of Gitdabling, according to which some Lepchas who were taken as slaves to Bhutan after the betrayal and assassination of Gyeba Achiok, the Lepcha Raja, at Dalim, believed that their king would reincarnate some day and they should be waiting (Rong means to wait) for their deliverence and they started calling themselves Rong Kup. But this cannot be accepted as no support for this view has been mentioned anywhere. Whatever be the reasons, the Lepchas call themselves as ‘Rongs’ and the outsiders know them as the Lepchas and in all historical details also, they are known as the Lepchas or Rongs. Lepchas, in turn, call the Nepalese ‘Loom’, Limbus as ‘Chongs’ and the Bhutias as ‘Arat’ or ‘Pot’.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Bulletin of Tibetology, Vol. 41, No.1 of May 2005, Sikkim,\n\n2. K.P.

Ren Suryaman Lepcha’s hand written note.\n\nTheories of Origin\n\nK.P. Tamsang’s view – In the book ‘The Unknown and Untold Reality about the Lepchas’, Tamsang on page 1, has explained as to who the Lepchas are and how they were created in the beginning; the same in his own words, “the Lepcha tradition says that in the beginning, the first and the foremost primogenitors of the Lepchas, Foodongthing and Nazaongnyo were created by God from the pure, virgin snows of the Kingtsoomzaongboo (kanchenjungha) Choo’s(mountain’s) pinnacle and sent them down to live, prosper and spread all over the fairy land of Mayel Lyang that lies on the lap of Kingtsoomzaongboo Choo, that is Mount Kanchanjunga. Therefore, as the Lepcha’s first primogenitors were thus created at the summit of Kingtsoomzaongboo by God Himself, the Lepchas very proudly proclaim themselves as Rongkup, that is, the son of the snowy peak and Rumkup, that is the son of God, in short Rong.”\n\nOpininion of Pema Wangchuk and Mita Zulca:—Pema Wangchuk & Mita Zulca in their book,‘Khangchendzonga Sacred Summit’ on page 31, have written, “Also, according to the story of origin, the first Lepcha couple, Tukbothing and Nazong Nyu, their Adam and Eve respectively, were created by Itbu Mu from the fresh snows of Khangchendzonga’s summit.” They have again said on page 36 of the same book, “Although theories abound how the Lepchas came to Sikkim, it is universally accepted that they have never migrated beyond Khangchendzonga’s shadow. It appears that the community made a conscious effort to always keep Khangchendzonga in sight. It is rare to find a Lepcha village from where Khangchendzonga can not be sighted.” According to them, Lepcha greetings ‘Achuley’ refers to the salutation to the mountain i.e. Kanchenjunga. These authors have further observed on page 32, “The Annual Chyu Rum Faat, thanksgiving worship of the mountain gods, is an integral part of the Lepcha rituals and is centered on Kanchenjungha. Apart from this, in every prayer that is offered, the Lepchas first invoke Kong Chen.” The other Lepcha name for Kanchenjungha is ‘Kong Chen’ i.e. big stone. This shows that the Lepchas first originated in the lap of Kanchenjungha and naturally their habitat is in the periphery of that mountain i.e. Sikkim. It is true that even the legends, culture and the religious rituals (Mun-Bongthingism) of the Lepchas are linked to the Kanchenjunga mountain and the great Sikkim rivers i.e, the Teesta and the Rangit, which also originate from the base of this mountain.\n\nR.P. Lama’s Views:—The veteran Gorkha writer and social worker of Darjeeling, R.P.Lama, in his book, ‘Across The Teesta’ on page 153 has written, “….The Lepchas call themselves ‘Mutanchi Rong’ meaning the beloved children of God. Their original ancestors, ‘FOODONGTHING and NAZONG-NU’, the first man and woman were created by God from the eternal purity and holy snows of the Himalayas, As such even to this day, Lepchas worship the Himalayas as their guardian deity.”\n\nFindings of John Morris:— About the origin of the Lepchas, John Morris in his book, ‘LIVING WITH LEPCHAS’ on page 63 has written, “Itpumu, the man, Kumsiting, the woman, were born from the two peaks of Kinchinjunga. They had two children, a boy named Tashay Thing, and a girl they gave the name of Nazong Nyu. These two married and had many children: but because they were brother and sister all their children were devils and for this reason their mother refused to suckle them. Eventually they gave birth to a child which was not a demon. They gave it the name of Ril Bu Shing, and because it was their first real child, the mother treated it tenderly and suckled with loving care. When the demon children saw this they were very angry and decided to do away with Ril Bu Shing. This they did, and he was buried near certain small peak on the right bank of Talung river. The parents were very upset, and deciding that life was insupportable, they divided their property and separated, Tashay Thing going towards Tibet and his wife towards Sikkim. Prior to this the grandmother, Kumsiting, called all her demon grandchildren together and addressed them. All came with the exception of Dom Mung, the demon of leprosy, which did not hear the summon. She told them all that in future there would be no objection to their ‘eating the souls’ of human beings; but, on the other hand, when offerings were made to them on behalf of these same humans by Bongthing, Mun or Rumfat Bu, they must accept them, and that when they did this they must leave the humans alone. This is said to be the origin of making sacrifices to the various demons But since Dom Mung was not present at the meeting and did not receive these instructions there is no cure for persons stricken with leprosy. After this Kumsiting created man. The first man was called Tarbong Pu; the first woman Nari Pu. They lived on the twin peaks beyond Seniolchum; and from there all the races of man, including the Lepchas, are descended.”\n\nViews of A.K. Das—In ‘The Lepchas of Darjeeling’ on page 129, Das describes how ‘Fadong thing’ and ‘Nazong nyu’, being brother and sister commited sin as a result of which, seven ugly looking sons born by them later killed the good looking eighth one and then on realising their sins, they prayed to God. God then forgave them and blessed them. The ten sons then born to them are regarded as the forefathers of the Lepchas.\n\nA.R. Foning’s findings:—A.R. Foning in his book, ‘Lepcha My Vanishing Tribe’ on page 88 describes the creation of first man and woman as follows: “Itbu-moo, the Great Mother Creator, after having created every thing on land and in the sea and sky, created Tukbothing to be Lord over them all and to enjoy it. After some time, feeling a bit of inadequacy in her project, from Takbothing’s ‘nungyong’, literally meaning ‘marrow’, and in figurative meaning, ‘wisdom’, created Nazong Nu and gave her to him as a companion and helpmate..” Here also, just as stated by Pema Wangchuk and Mita Zulca above, Foning describes the first man as Tukbothing instead of Foodongthing. The actual location of the creation has not been indicated here. But he asserts that the Lepchas are the autochthones and has expressed as such at several places in his book mentioned above.\n\nMinor differences of opinion:—Slight differences have emerged while giving the names to the first man and the woman by the different scholars as we find them called ‘Foodongthing or Tukbothing or Tashay Thing or Itpumu or Tarbong pu’ for the man and ‘Nazaongnyu or Kumsithing or Nari pu’ for the woman. It is difficult to say which view is universally accepted by the Lepchas or by the historians; but it has been generally accepted by all that Foodongthing and Nazongnyu were the first Lepcha man and Lepcha woman respectively created by Itboomoo (mother creator).\n\nThe place of origin:- The opinions and the observations given in the above paragraphs indicate that the location of the creation of the first Lepcha primogenitors was Kanchenjungha and its periphery i.e. Sikkim. There are, however, some scholars who ascribe to the theory of migration of the tribe from the east.\n\nThe Lepchas firmly believe that they are the autochthones of Sikkim and Darjeeling. However, various authors and historians, past and present, have given conflicting and confusing theories about the actual origin of the Lepcha race, but most firmly believe that the race first originated in Sikkim only, while some say that the Lepchas migrated from the north and quite a number say they came from the east. There are also people, who conjecture that they have come from the west. This is evident from the following passages.\n\nK.P. Tamsang’s opinion: — K.P. Tamsang in his book, ‘The Unknown and Untold Reality about the Lepchas’ on page 3 has stated the following:—\n\n“The Lepchas claim themselves not only as the very indigenous race of the Sikkim and the Darjeeling District, but also the very primeval people of the world. But here too, as far as the origin of the Lepchas is concerned, many foreign writers, anthropologists, linguists and serologists have conflicting opinions and views. Mackean, Shafer, Siiger and many others are of the opinion that the Lepchas have migrated from the east in ancient times and permanently settled down in Sikkim and Darjeeling. Many others have the suppositions and imaginations that the Lepchas may have migrated from the north. Many say that the Lepchas have definitely migrated from the west, for the Lepchas have in some way descended from the European stock, that is, the Lepcha race was founded by three warriors who had remained behind from the campaign of Alexander the Great. Many writers merely imagine that the Lepchas are the very descendants of the missing tribe of Israel by merely comparing the biblical legend of the Flood (Noah’s time), the Tower of Babylon, and many identical names of places like Ararat, Illam, Sidon and many similar names of the Kings of Old Testament with that of the Lepchas’ Flood (Teesta-Rangit rising upto Tendong peak), the earthern Tower of Tallaom Purtam, Araot Lho, Sadam, Illam etc. etc. Also innumerable Indo-European languages including English, Latin, German, Dutch, Gothic, Scandinaveans words with identical meanings and sounds with Lepcha words such as tall, see, seem, hook, poke, he, his, him, you, mo, roll, cub, knock, dam, tago, etc. are found in Lepcha language. Also, innumerable identical Tibeto-Burman languages including Nagas, Khasis, Burmese, Chinese, Laosians, Tibetans, Meches, Mros, Magars, Tamangs, Limboos words with identical meanings and sounds with Lepcha words etc. don’t prove that the Lepchas have either migrated from the east, north, west and south to Sikkim or to say that the Lepchas are of the same stock with Western European people, or with the North-Eastern Indian people, and the South-Eastern Asian people..”. Tamsang asserts that the Lepchas and their language must have gone to other parts of the world in the distant past and hence the Lepchas are the autochthones of Sikkim and Darjeeling.\n\nTheory of Migration from the east:— Foning also mentions about hearing the story of three strange brothers proceeding from the land of the rising sun and through strange circumstances one ended up settling in Jalpaiguri and Coochbehar as the present day Mechs and Kochs and another in eastern Nepal as Jimdars (Rais) or Kiratas, the last one landing in Mayel country ie Sikkim as the Lepchas. To back up this claim, he points out certain similarities seen in the Lepchas, Kochs, Mechs and the Jimdars. For the second part of his theory, Foning has found support from Haffden Siiger when, he after comparing the language and the people of the east with the Lepchas and their language, has hazarded that the Lepchas might have migrated from the east. J.C. White is also of the opinion that the Lepchas came from the east.\n\nTheory of migration from Israel – Mr. D.Ramsong Foning, a retired DSP, is of the view that the Lepchas have similarities with Israelis in many respects and had hazarded that the race might have come from Israel. It is true some of the Biblical stories relating to the Israelis e.g. (1) of creation of 1st Man and Woman, (2) Great Flood of Noah’s time and (3) Tower of Babel under Nimrod’s time have similarities with some Lepcha folklore and stories and some of the Lepcha words have similarities with those found in middle East and Europe. Lepcha marriage custom of having to pay the price of the bride or giving a certain period of service in lieu of the price is also similar to the one followed by Israelis in ancient times. Fred Pinn compares the Lepcha marriage custom with the bible story of Jacob having to serve his father-in-law Laban for a certain period for winning the wife for himself as the Lepchas have also similar practice. Even the custom of marrying the widow by the deceased husband’s brother or other kin of the husband was a common practice among both the Israelis and the Lepchas. J.C. White in ‘SIKHIM AND BHUTAN’ has thus described Lepcha features, “…smaller and lighter in build with finer cut features, in many cases almost Jewish….”\n\nBecause of all the above similarities of the Lepchas with Israelis, some peple like Ramsong Foning have hazarded that the Lepchas might be the ‘lost tribe of Israel’.\n\nLepchas, the actual original aborigines – Whatever be the minor differences of opinion about the actual origin of the Lepcha tribe, there is absolute unanimity on the assumption that the Lepchas are the most ancient tribe and undisputedly the original aborigines of Sikkim and their life and culture revolve around Kanchejungha mountain and the rivers Teesta and Rangit, which are considered as their sacred deities. In deference to high regard given to Kanchanjungha by the Lepchas and other Sikkimese, the mountaineers who manage to reach the summit of that mountain, stop about a feet or so below the peak point and thereby preserving the chastity and sanctity of the peak. Kanchenjungha is the only mountain in the world given such respect. Maharaja, Sir Tashi Namgyal of Sikkim, while giving permission for Kanchenjungha Expedition in 1955, enjoined on the expedition leader to ensure sanctity of the peak. Tamsang, Pema Wangchuk and Nita Zulca firmly believe that the Lepchas were created out of pure snows of Kanchenjungha. Tamsang also explains that ‘Rongkup’ by which Lepchas call themselves means ‘sons of God’ or ‘sons of mountains’. Lepcha tradition of worshipping the Sikkimese mountains like the Kanchenjungha and the Tendong mountain have been recognised as a part of Sikkim State culture and tradition, and hence the occasions are treated as State festivals. ‘Pang Lhabsol’ is the festival for the worship of Lepcha deity (or God) Kanchenjungha and ‘Tendong Lho Rumfat’, the festival for the worship of Tendong mountain, located above Namchi, as this latter mountain is said to have saved the Lepcha race from the Great flood in ancient time. Tamsang, further, totally negates the theory of migration of the Lepchas from the east or west or north or south, but goes so far as to assert that if at all there was migration, it might be from Sikkim to other places.\n\nMany research scholars and writers mention the existence of a ‘Mayel village’ in the lap of Kanchenjungha and it was here, Mother creator, Itbumoo, after creating the Lepcha race in this ‘Mayel Kyung’ from the pure snows of Kanchenjungha, is supposed to have given each of the 108 clans of the Lepcha, a ‘Chyu’ (mountain peak), a ‘Lep’(cave) and a ‘Da’ (Lake), all located in the periphery of Kanchenjungha. The use of ‘Chyu’ and ‘Da’ is for survival and existence of each Lepcha, while it is believed that ‘Lep’ is where the soul will go after death. This ‘Mayel Kyung’, known to the Lepcha tribes and believed by them as ‘the home of their ancestors’ is supposed to be somewhere in the inaccessible part of Kanchenjungha. None except the great Lepcha legendary figure Thekung Mensalong has actually seen this mysterious village, from where he was said to have brought horticulture and grain seeds for Sikkim in ancient time. After the creation and growth of the race in this Mayel village, they started worshipping Kanchenjungha as Rum or God. Lepcha Muns and Bongthings have to invoke Kanchenjungha (Lepcha God or Rum) in every Lepcha ritual. Like the Ganga and the Jamuna to the Hindus, rivers Teesta(Runyu) and Rangit both originating from the glaciers of Kanchenjunga are considered ‘holy’ to the Lepcha race. Interestingly, all the major rivers of Sikkim are also named with words starting from ‘R’ e.g. Rongnyu(for Teesta), Rongit, Ramam, Rishi, Relli, Rongpo, Rungbee, Ratong, Rumphiup etc and all these names are in Lepcha.\n\nLepcha folklore like ‘Tal Lom Partam’ i.e. making the way to go to heaven, by constructing a stairway of earthern pots some 3600 years ago from a location in Daramden and also the Lepcha legends of Rongnu-Rongit—their love story and the great flood – clearly confirm that the Lepcha race have been in Sikkim from time immemorial i.e, from thousands of years ago. Dharnidhar Dahal in ‘Sikkimko Rajnaitik Itihas’ on page 2 mentions the existence of Lepcha king and the Lepcha race during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya in 330 B.C. The mountains, rivers and the places in Sikkim, Darjeeling district, Jalpaiguri, western Bhutan and eastern Nepal named in Lepcha language further confirm that the Lepcha race belonged to this region from ancient time. No historian or scholars both from India or from abroad have raised any doubt about the claim of the Lepchas being the original aborigines of Darjeeling and Sikkim; they have rather supported this claim with their findings based on the earliest available stories and records. In the Coronation booklet published by the palace, under the chapter ‘The Religion of Sikkim’, it has been written, “At first the Lepchas, the original residents of the land were known to be Bonpo Shamanists. In the eight century Guru Padma Sambhava taught Buddhism in Sikkim.” That means the Bhutia rulers admit that Lepchas are the original inhabitants of Sikkim and that they were there even during the 8th century. Because of all these facts, the Sikkim Government in 2005, has moved the Central Government to recognize the Lepchas under the category of the Most Primitive Tribe.\n\nAll the above factors based on historical facts and mythological stories, have convincingly proved beyond all doubt that the Lepchas are the original aborigines of Darjeeling and Sikkim. It is immaterial to say here, for the sake of argument, whether they originated here, even though there is ample evidence to suggest that they did originate here in Sikkim, or they have migrated to this place from elsewhere, but the historical fact is that the Lepchas were the only occupiers of this part of Sikkim and Darjeeling from ancient time. Views of some other scholars given below will also convincingly prove the Lepchas are the actual aborigines of Sikkim and Darjeeling.\n\nObservation of J.C. White:— J.C. White, who was the first Political Officer of Sikkim during the period 1888-1907, in his book, ‘Sikhim and Bhutan’ on page 7 has said, “The aboriginal inhabitants of Sikkim are the Lepchas and the language they use is Lepcha.Their origin is doubtful, as they did not enter Sikhim across the Himalayas or from Tibet, but are supposed to have come from the east along the foothills from the direction of Assam and upper Burmah. They bear little resemblance to the Tibetans, they are smaller and slightly built with finer cut features, in many cases almost Jewish and their language is a distinct one, not a dialect of Tibetan.” Gorer’s Views:— Geoffrey Gorer in his book, ‘HIMALAYAN VILLAGE’ on page 35 has said, “There is no generally accepted theory among those anthropologists who believe that every tribe originally came from somewhere else as to the place of origin of the Lepchas. Various parts of Tibet and Mongolia have been suggested and a certain similarity has apparently been found between the Lepcha language and some dialect spoken in Indo-China. The Lepchas themselves have no tradition of migration and place the home of their ancestors – people of Mayel – in one of the inaccessible valleys of Kinchenjunga.” He has further said “…It seems certain that they were originally the only inhabitants of this large mountainous land.”\n\nOpinion of E.C. Dozey:— In his book titled, “A CONCISE HISTORY OF THE DARJEELING DISTRICT, Since 1835” on page 274 Dozey has said, “…Lepchas, or as they call themselves, the Rongpa or Ravine folk; a most charming people, whose origin is obscure, though it is thought they migrated to their present abode along the foothills of the Himalayas from the east, not from Tibet.They are a distinct race, with a language, both spoken and written, of their own, and with very marked characteristics. Their features are distinctly aquiline, a marked contrast to the usual Mongolian type seen about these parts…” He has in the above mentioned book on page 41 said, “…the aborigines of that land, the Lepchas” referring to Sikkim and further beyond in the same page, we find written, “…the Lepcha once possessed all the hill territory of Sikkim and Darjeeling, including the Daling sub-division”.\n\nViews of L.S.S. O’Malley:—O’Malley, in his book ‘Bengal District Gazetteers Darjeeling’ at page 44 has said, “The Lepchas are the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, who call themselves Rong, i.e., the squatters, and their country the land of caves …… Formerly they possessed all the hill country of Darjeeling and Sikkim.”\n\nHunter’s Remarks:— W.W. Hunter in “A Statistical Account of Bengal, Vol. X, London,1876” has written, “The Lepchas are considered to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the hilly portion of the district. At all events they are the first known occupiers of this tract (Darjeeling tract) and of independent Sikkim.”\n\nViews of H.G. Joshi:— H.G. Joshi in his book ‘Sikkim Past and Present’ on page 137 has said, “The Lepchas, who call themselves “Rong Pa” (ravine folk) are believed to have been the original inhabitants of Sikkim”. In the book he has written on page 138:—“Their (Bhutias’) bonds with the Lepchas date back to more than 500 years when a blood brotherhood was established between their tribal chiefs at Kabi Lungtsok in north Sikkim”.\n\nOpinion of Sanchita Ghatak:—Sanchita Ghatak has described Lepchas as “the principal tribal people of Sikkim” in the book, ‘People of India, Sikkim’ compiled by Sri K.S. Singh. She has further said “…Lepchas are supposed to be the original inhabitants of Sikkim.”\n\nAssertion of Fred Pinn:—In his “The Road of Destiny, Darjeeling Letters 1839” under the chapter “The Lepcha Problem” on page 170, Fred Pinn has said, “…. when for countless generations they (Lepchas) had been used to roam large parts of Sikkim, being the original inhabitants of the country.”References:\n\nK.P.

According to Tamsang, Mayel Lyang or Lepcha country extended from the Himalayas to Titalaya, now in Bangladesh, in the south, upto Gipmochi mountain (trijunction of Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet) in the east and upto Aroon river in Nepal in the west. R.N.Thakur in ‘HIMALAYAN LEPCHAS’ on page 30, writes, “The present Sikkim and the territories it lost to neighbouring countries were called by Lepchas, ‘Ne Mayel Renjyong Lyang’, or in short it was called ‘Renjong’ which the Tibetans erroneously claimed to have originated from the words ‘De-ma-jong’ which means ‘the land of rice’. But the truth seems to lie somewhere else. In certain cases ‘D’ stands for ‘R’ and ‘J’ for ‘Jy’ as well. Hence the foreign authors might have used ‘Denjong’ in place of ‘Renjyong’.” Thakur further on page141 has indicated that the Lepchas’ original homeland stretched from the western part of Bhutan upto the eastern part of Nepal, which of course included the present day Sikkim and Darjeeling district and some parts of Bhutan and also of Nepal. It may be iterated here that ‘Renjyong’ in Lepcha means ‘respectable people’. The name ‘Sikkim’ was given by the Limbu princess who was married as the third wife by the Raja Tensung Namgyal (1644—1700), as ‘Su Heem’ in Limbu means ‘new house’.\n\nAbout the size of Mayel Lyang, Foning in his book “Lepcha My Vanishing Tribe” on pages 140-141 describes the evolution of Lepchas’ Mayel country to the present Denzong in the following manner:\n\n“With the mythological Mayel Lyang as the nucleus, the habitat of the autochthons, the Rongfolk, was evolved, and what later came into being a country called Denzong, the State of Sikkim to the present generation.……after the installation of Pencho Namgyal as the first king, Sikkim was several times the size of the present State. To the north, beyond the snows, it contained the region along the Chumbi Valley, called Tromo by the Tibetans now. It extended right upto Thang La, near the town of Phari, in Tibet. As a consequence of the convention between the British and the Chinese in1890, this portion of the land was given away to Tibet. In this deal, Sikkim, the rightful owner of the territory, was ignored completely. To the west, it was bounded by the rivers Arun and Tambur, which now run through the eastern part of the kingdom of Nepal. This was before the Gurkhas came and took charge of this region. It also included a strip of the foothills measuring a few miles, to the south, in the rice growing plains of the Terai. This part of the territory was lost to the foreign aggression. To the east, the boundary extended right upto Tegong La, enclosing the present western province of Ha, within the kingdom of Bhutan, together with the plains-strip of the Duars, extending a few miles to the south. Towards the latter half of the nineteenth century, mainly due to internal feud within the kingdom this part was taken away by Bhutan. Then, the British, or rather their East India Company, through what seemed trickery, diplomacy and aggression, acquired what is now known as Darjeeling district of West Bengal except the Kalimpong subdivision which they took ultimately after the Bhutan war of 1864. The southern boundary extended upto Titalaya.” Foning has also given the Lepcha verse defining the boundaries of Mayel country heard from the older Lepcha folks, which used to be sung in the olden days. The same is as follows:\n\n“Chuk-lat, Po-nok take (east upto Punakha)\n\nChuk-kyer, Ru-chan Rang-a (west upto Arun and Tambur)\n\nChuk-gyom Tal, Chyu-bee Bong (north upto mountains)\n\nChuk-veem, Zo-la-see Brong (south upto rice growing Duars)”\n\nR. Moktan in his book, ‘SIKKIM: DARJEELING’ on page 245, quoting from ‘THE HISTORY OF SIKKIM, 1908’ has described the boundaries of Sikkim kingdom under Phuntsog Namgyal (1604-1670) as follows, “Dibdala in the north, Shingsa Dag-pay, Walung, Yangmag Khangchen Yarlung and Tamar Chorten in the west, Down along the Arun Dudh Kosi rivers, down to the Maha Nodi Naxalbari, Tuitalia in the south. In the east Tagong La and Tang La in the north”. The version appearing in the book of E.C. Dozey, quoted in the earlier paragraphs says, “Their (Lepchas’) original habitat extended for over 120 miles along the southern face of the Himalayas from the river Kossee in Nepal on the west to about 50 miles due east of river Tista.”\n\nRisley’s Gazetteer on page 2 contains the following “The Hon’ble Ashley Eden in 1864 noticed that Sikkim, though a very petty State then, was formerly a fair sized country, reaching from the Arun river on the west to the Taigon pass on the east, from Tibet on the north to Kissengunge in Purnea on the south.”\n\nDr. Sonam B. Wangyal on pages 17 and 18 of his book, ‘SIKKIM & DARJEELING’ has written the following, “Rao in ‘SIKKIM The Story of its Integration with India’ referring to the 17th century wrote, “The kingdom of Sikkim in those times was very extensive and included the Chumbi Valley of Tibet.” About the rest of Sikkim, Francis Buchanan Hamilton wrote the following: “At one time the princes of Sikkim had extended their dominion far south, into the district of Puraiya, and possessed the low country on the east of the Mahananda, as far as Krishangunj, a part of the country which was originally possessed by the Koch and Paliyas, the natives of Kamrup and Matsya, now the districts of Ranggapar and Dinajpur,….Although the Kankayi, in the upper part of its course, was nearly the boundary, they never would appear to have possessed the plain between the Kankayi and the Mahananda; but were lords of the lower hills, occupied by the tribe called Dimali…”\n\nAll the above historical facts establish beyond doubt that Sikkim and Darjeeling were the Lepcha lands and this is corroborated by the Lepcha folklore and songs. Even the names of places all over Sikkim, Darjeeling and eastern Nepal are in Lepcha, the same now have been corrupted in various ways. Morung is a Lepcha word, formed by two words i.e., ‘Ma’ ‘Rong’ meaning ‘don’t wait’ and Sandakphu is from Lepcha words, ‘sam’(heart) and ‘dokpu’(hurt) i.e. hurting some body’s feelings. Similarly Damok in Nepal is a Lepcha word which has been formed by ‘Da’ and ‘Mok’ i.e. ‘Da’ means lying and ‘Mok’ to shoot or hit (Damok means to shoot with arrows in lying position). There is a place called ‘LEPCHA JAGAT’ near Sukia Pokhari, close to Nepal border from where beautiful view of Darjeeling town can be seen. The name ‘Lepcha Jagat’ must have been so named by the earliest group of Nepalese settlers while first viewing the then small town or village of Darjeeling from that place.\n\nEven the names of rivers in the eastern Nepal were in Lepcha e.g. Ruva (now called Rava), Ruchong (now called Arun), Runga (now called Tamor) etc. This proves that the eastern region of Nepal was part of Lepcha Ne Mayel kingdom. The names of the western Bhutan rivers are also in Lepcha e.g. Rudok (presently Ridak), Rusa (presently called Tursa), Rudye (presently Jaldhaka). This also proves that western Bhutan was a part of Lepcha territory. Siliguri is also derived from two Lepcha words, ‘Sali’ meaning ‘bow’ (relating to bow and arrow) and ‘Gri’ meaning ‘fort’. The river Mahanadi has been named in Lepcha; the word Mahanadi being formed of two Lepcha words, ‘Ma-na’ meaning ‘hidden’ and ‘di’ meaning, ‘come’, i.e. come hidden. True enough, Mahanadi comes hidden from its catchment area and suddenly spreads out on reaching the plains. There are several other places or rivers named in Lepchas in Nepal, Bhutan, Darjeeling and Sikkim and the names mentioned above are cited as examples only.\n\nTill about the 19th century, there were three main regions, (1) Renzong (Denzong) Lyang, comprising of the present Sikkim area including the present subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Siliguri, (2) Damsang Lyang, comprising of present Kalimpong subdivision and some Dooars area, and (3) Ilam Lyang(now in Nepal). Lepcha People in these territories were broadly known as Renzongmoos, Damsangmoos, and Ilammoos respectively. The Lepchas residing in the western part of Bhutan were called Promoo i.e. of Bhutan, since the western portion of Bhutan were also part of Lepcha Mayel land.\n\nRefernces:\n\nK.P. Tamsang’s ‘The Unknown and Untold Reality about the Lepchas’\n\nR.N. Thakur’s ‘Himalayan Lepchas’\n\nA.R. Foning’s ‘Lepcha My Vanishing Tribe’\n\nR. Moktan’s ‘Sikkim: Darjeeling’\n\nDr. Sonam B. Wangyal in ‘Sikkim & Darjeeling’\n\nSinchel derives its name from ‘Sin-Shel-Lho’\n\nwhich in Lepcha means mist moistened hill\n\nDisposition and Nature of the Lepchas\n\nGeneral nature — Lepchas, being children of nature and not affected by the outside evil influences till a few centuries ago, are usually always simple, cheerful, open hearted, devoid of guile, kind, ready to smile always, trusting, trustworthy and faithful type. H.G. Joshi in ‘Sikkim Past and Present’ on page 137 has said, “Lepchas are generally considered to be kind and peaceful by nature. They are accustomed to living in remote and inaccessible regions, where they develop fondness for birds, beasts, flowers and an extensive knowledge of the forests and mountains.” There are few instances where they were found to be cruel, cold blooded and murdering type. If one visits a Police Station, one hardly finds any Lepcha’s name in the list of criminals or in the ‘wanted list’. There is a recent case, the rarest of the rare among the Lepchas, i.e. of a Lepcha constable of Indian Reserve Battallion shooting down four of his friends in Delhi in early 2007, when the latter hurt his pride by inflicting insult at him by their obscene behaviour. The Lepchas have a strong sense of pride and under whatever circumstances, they are never seen begging. They would rather survive on jungle roots or leaves or bark of a tree for their food rather than beg. R. N. Thakur in ‘Himalayan Lepchas’ on page 108-89, writes, “The Lepchas have a low esteem of the Nepalese because of their habit of begging. Unlike the Lepchas who feel shy of begging even if they are starving…” Gorer in ‘HIMALAYAN VILLAGE’ on page 274 has observed, “ The Lepchas so dislike being ordered about, that even on construction jobs which could be quicker and more efficiently performed with a director of operations, they insist on working independently, and appear to ignore anybody who tries to give orders.”\n\nThey are always ready to help and their kindness surpasses any understanding. For friendship sake, they have given away their standing trees, timber and even part of their land holdings. Their kindness, generosity, charity and habit of sharing has been vouched by several writers. If properly investigated one will come to know the place where Kalimpong town is now located, at one time long ago, belonged to the Lepcha owners.They are the living Harischandras (legendary generous Indian king). Morris in his book has cited the case of a Lepcha and a Nepalese while going on a journey, where it had been observed that the Lepcha carried a big pot to provide for a family, but the Nepalese carried a pot just enough for himself. They hardly practise thrift. J.C. White has mentioned in the succeeding paragraph about this inherent habit of the Lepchas to eat up every thing when crops are good and not providing for the lean season. Non-Lepcha neighbours often make fun of the habit of lavishness of the Lepchas. They joke saying that during the harvest time, if one visits a Lepcha house and ask the owner as to whom the house belongs, the answer would be, “This is Mandal’s house”, but during the lean month the reply would be a timid, “This is Lepcha’s house”. In the villages, Mandal, being the head of a village, is comparatively richer than other villagers.\n\nThe absence of thriftness of the Lepchas has been clearly elaborated by Indira Awasty in her book ‘Between Sikkim and Bhutan’ when she says on page 39, “…they tend to spend their money within a short while and then subsist poorly for the rest of the year and borrow heavily. The Lepchas have mortgaged their land for many years on account of their borrowing a small sum of money. The rate of interest was very high and it had to be paid in terms of crops. This indebtedness was a very common feature which led these people to a downtrodden state and economic misery. Lepchas tend to take loans for even non-essentials, like buying a radio or new clothes. In contrast, the Nepalese started off as servants, labourers, and tenant farmers. Due to thrift and hard work, they bought up a lot of land”.\n\nObservations of John Morris, Gorer and Fred Pinn – John Morris, on page 35 of the book referred to at several places, has quoted, “….In disposition they are amiable and obliging, frank, humorous, and polite, without the servility of the Hindoos; and their address is free and unconstrained. Their intercourse with one another and with Europeans is scrupulously honest; a present is divided equally amongst many, without a syllable of discontent or grudging look or word: each, on receiving his share, coming up and giving the donor a brusque bow and thanks.” This is in agreement with what Gorer in ‘HIMALAYAN VILLAGE’ on pages 250 and 251 have to say about the Lepchas, “…Although…deferential they were never servile….Present-giving forms a continual motive in Lepcha life…..it is a point of honour.” Gorer has further observed that the Lepchas are “Unselfish”, but at the same time, points out “the lack of aggression” in the community. The lack of aggression has also been pointed out by Fred Pinn in his book referred to above, where he has written on page 170 “..The Nepalese were an aggressive people and Hindus, whereas the Lepchas were – and still are – of a gentle disposition and Buddhists of a sort.”\n\nViews of A.K. Das — Das in ‘The Lepchas of Darjeeling’ on page 4, has written, “The Lepchas are intelligent, amiable and always cheerful. They are modest and social and a pleasant smile is always visible on their lips……great lovers of all sorts of sports which involve physical exercise. They are honest – theft is rare among them – and they do not quarrel among themselves or with outsiders. Though they keep knives with them they never use these against one another.They are peaceful, industrious and are averse to serving for others. If by chance they lose temper, they become ashamed immediately afterwards and they apologise. They are peace-loving and try to resist things that may even bring harm to them. It is very difficult to find such a type of character structure in a community in the present-day world. Relatives, friends, strangers etc. cannot but admire them as hosts. Their healthy physique with unique character structure adds to the beauty to their land.”\n\nComments of E.C. Dozey and O’Malley — E.C. Dozey as referred to in the foregoing paragraphs has found the Lepchas as most charming. L.S.S. O’Malley calls the Lepchas ‘kindly, placid, and somewhat indolent.’ (Ref: ‘Darjeeling’ on page 44) He has further said, “ In spite, however, of their unenterprising nature, they often make excellent servants; and their want of vigour has been much exaggerated, as will be apparent from the fact that some of them have gone far afield and done excellent entomological work in Burma, the Andamans and Nicobars, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Archipelago, in the Celebes and New Guinea, where one of them was killed by the savages and in Central Africa. Here, the collectors contrived to get back to Darjeeling with the help of the long arm of British authority. Such a feat goes far to show that they are not such a resourceless people as is often supposed.”\n\nOpinion of J.C. White:— J.C. White who closely observed the Lepchas for 20 years has written in his book, ‘Sikhim And Bhutan’ on page 7 as follows:— “They are people of a mild, quiet and indolent disposition, loving solitude and their homes are found in the most inaccessible places, in the midst of forests if possible, and seldom above an elevation of 4000 feet. They are also improvident, living from hand to mouth; with abundance when the crops are good, but once the supply is eaten up going often in direst straits, picking up what they can in the jungle till the next crop ripens. They are great nature lovers and good entomologists and botanists, and have their own names for every animal, insect, and plant, and are, I should think, unequalled anywhere as collectors. They make most excellent and trustworthy servants and are quite exceptional people, among whom it is pleasant to live.”\n\nGeneral Mainwaring’s opinion — Mainwaring in his preface to his ‘Grammar of Rongs’ on page xiii, has remarked, “They were in manners and customs and in true civilisation immeasurably superior to any of the surrounding tribes, to the Gurkhas, or to the natives of the plains.”\n\nHooker’s observation—….What has Hooker to say about the Lepchas (Ref: Morris’ Living With Lepchas, page 34 – 37) is as follows: “The Lepcha is the aboriginal inhabitants of Sikkim, and the prominent character in Darjeeling, where he takes all sorts of outer employment……They are of shorter stature—four feet eight inches to five feet; rather broad in the chest, and with muscular arms, but small hands and slender wrists. The face is broad, flat, and of eminently Tartar character, flat nosed, oblique-eyed, with no beard and a little moustache….In disposition they are amiable and obliging, frank, humourous and polite, without the servility of the Hindus; and their address is free and unconstrained. Their intercourse with one another and with European is scrupulously honest; a present is divided equally among many, without a syllable of discontent or grudging look or word: each, on receiving his share, coming up and giving the donor a brusque bow and thanks…… A more interesting and attractive companion than the Lepcha I never lived with: cheerful, kind and patient with a master to whom he is attached; rude but not savage, ignorant yet intelligent;…..Ever foremost in the forest or on the bleak mountain, and ever ready to help, to carry, collect or cook, they cheer on the traveller by their unostentatious zeal in his service, and are spurs to his progress.”\n\nDr. Graham’s close study of the Lepchas — Another foreigner, Dr. Graham, who lived among the Lepchas and other hill communities has said (Ref: Morris’ Living With Lepchas, page 38-41) as follows:— “You ask me what I think of the Lepchas as compared with the other hill peoples—the Tibetans and the Nepalese. As I have told you, they appeal to me more than do the others….” Citing example of his personal Lepcha servant for the last 25 years till his death, he mentions the honesty, integrity, kindness, generosity, trustworthiness and loyalty of the Lepchas and their readiness to share whatever they possess or own.\n\nIndependent and hospitable character observed by Fred Pinn— The following passage taken from Fred Pinn’s ‘Road to Destiny’, page 87-88, demonstrates Lepcha’s independent and hospitable nature and strong sense of loyalty to the authority, “…Whilst at Pudumtam we witnessed a scene which strongly illustrated the independent and hospitable character of the Lepchas. Two Official Chuprassees, deputed by Colonel Lloyd, arrived at the Dingpun’s house with a copy of the proclamation, announcing the taking possession by the British Government of all the territory between the Balason and Mahananda, ceded by the Sikkim Raja, but by some omission or mischance, this British proclamation was unaccompanied by corresponding announcement from the Rajah to the people of the portion ceded. The Dingpun received the men hospitably, and being unable, from our residence with him, to find them accommodation in his own house, he loaded them with rice, Indian corn, chillies, tobacco, etc. almost enough for a fortnight’s supply, and sent them to a neighbour. But he positively refused to receive the proclamation, and on the following morning repeated the refusal, declining even to its being posted against the wall of his house, although he read and explained to his neighbours, whom he summoned for the purpose. His argument against receiving it was plainly and boldly set forth, grounded on the fact that he and his father, before him, had duly and faithfully served the Maharajah, from whom they received the favours, and that therefore he could receive no other master without the Rajah’s order. Besides, he added, ‘when I go to visit my Maharaj, he receives me gladly and feeds me well; but if ever I pay the colonel sahib, he gives me nothing to put in my mouth; although when the sahib log or their visitors come to my village, I give them what I can and pay them every attention.’ I really, felt humbled at this simple declaration of the Dingpun”.\n\nLoyalty, Bravery and courage of Lepchas – Just because Lepchas are tolerant, accommodative, and non-aggressive, there is a general impression in the minds of the other people, scholars and authors that the Lepcha people lack courage and resourcefulness. But some of the work done by the Lepchas in Andamans, Malay, Central Africa and the wars they fought against Bhutan and Nepal and saved the Sikkim kingdom many times (as they formed bulk of the Sikkim army) prove otherwise.\n\nLoyalty and bravery of Lepchas saved Sikkim Kingdom – Loyalty and bravery of Lepcha soldiers and officers saved the Sikkim Maharaja and the kingdom many times. One Lepcha general, Chhokthup, defeated the advancing Nepal army seventeen times and hence he is known in history as ‘Satrajit’. All these will be elaborately discussed and analysed in subsequent chapter. As long as the Lepchas were taken into confidence and were actively involved in the administration and the army by the Sikkim rulers, Sikkim could stand on its own against all invaders, but after the anti-Lepcha policy of the Raja from 1826 onwards, the kingdom lost its supporting pillars and gradually became a puppet in the hands of British Government.\n\nThe murder of the Lepcha Prime minister committed by the order of the Raja Tsugphod in 1826 has been some sort of curse on the Chhogyal and the kingdom from the time of that murder till the final abolition of the Chogyalship in 1975. If one studies the historical events in Sikkim, he finds the Raja fleeing to Tibet every time wars occurred or internal trouble. During the war with Bhutan (1700–1706 AD), and with Nepal (1790–92AD) the Raja had fled to Tibet. During some internal trouble like the case of usurpation by the imposter Tamdi in (1835–1840 AD), the Raja had to be taken to Senchal in Darjeeling and then later to Bhutan for his protection and on all these occasions and also during similar other problems, it was left to the Lepchas to fight for Sikkim. Every historian on Sikkim and Nepal knows the name of Lepcha general Chhokthup, ‘Satrajit”. Nowhere it is found recorded that the Sikkim Raja was leading his army against such and such enemy. The extraordinary feat of an ordinary and illiterate Lepcha, Kinthup, who single-handedly completed the survey of Brahmaputra in Tibet between the period 1879-83 has been dealt elaborately in subsequent pages in a separate chapter titled, ‘Some Lepcha Heroes’.\n\nSome notable achievements of the Lepchas in the recent times —There was one Captain Dimik Sing in Sikkim, who had served British Indian army during the pre-Independence era. It was a rare feat in those days. In the recent past also, there was one Capt Furba Lepcha, a Bir Chakra recipient, from Darjeeling. There is one retired Lepcha Colonel from Darjeeling who has been decorated with Visist Sewa Medal (VSM). In the freedom movement of India also, the contribution made by a Lepcha Lady, Sabitri Devi (Helen Didi) of Kurseong was given due recognition by the Government of India (details in ‘Some Lepcha heroes’). Sri Sonam Tshering Tamsang has recently been awarded Padmashri by the President of India (details in ‘Some Lepcha Heroes’). There were earlier two prominent Lepcha doctors from Darjeeling and in honour of one of them a road (Dr. Yensing Road) in Darjeeling town has been named and the bust of another (Dr. Ongden) has been installed at a public place in Kalimpong. Besides the two famous Lepcha writers, Sri K.P. Tamsang and Sri A.R. Foning, who have written books in English and whose names are referred to again and again in this book, there are other Lepcha writers — G. Tshering, Salon Karthak, Arnold Rongong etc. — who have achieved fame as writers in the Nepali language.\n\nThere have been high Lepcha officials in Administrative, Police, Engineering and Medical wings in Sikkim, Bhutan and West Bengal. Both Sikkim and Bhutan had Lepcha Chief Engineers for quite some time in the past and there were a few Lepcha doctors occupying senior positions under the Health Directorate in Sikkim. S.W. Tenzing, was the Chief Secretary of Sikkim during 2005-06 and his brother was the first Sikkimese D.G. of Police, Sikkim. It is believed that they are from the Lepcha stock. Some other prominent Lepcha bureaucrats and engineers of the recent time are Gyaltsen, Berfungpa, T. T. Lepcha, Naksuk, Pasang Namgyal, etc, but some of the bureaucrats named here do not claim themselves to be Lepchas and their names do not figure under the ‘Lepchas’ in the Ethnographic details of bureaucracy published by the Sikkim Government.\n\nSome of the serving Lepcha officers have received national awards like President’s Police Medal etc. A young Lepcha school girl named Paril at the age of 13, from Kalimpong, won the National archery championship. She was given grant of Rs.70,000 from DGHC for purchasing a fibre bow. Recently D.T. Lepcha IPS, Special IG, Darjeeling, has been awarded the Indian Police Medal and Jyotsna Sitling IFS, a Conservator of Forests, Dehradun has received the Indira Gandhi Paryabaran award in 2007 and also a National award on Civil Service in 2008. A few years ago, one L.T. Sada, Asstt Director, SIB, Kalimpong had also been awarded Indian Police Medal. There may be similar instances in Sikkim also.Yet many Lepchas work on diligently, devotedly and silently without aspiring for any recognition and reward. In this age, when there are plenty of clever, cunning, ambititious and manipulating people everywhere for acquiring power and money, the works and achievements of so many unassertive and unassuming people sometimes remain unrecognised and forgotten in the sands of time.\n\nThe Lepchas are thus a rare species of people, who are kind, generous, cheerful, amiable, honest, loyal, brave, modest, extra polite, resourceful, helpful, timid, and may be, lacking in aggression but never servile. Their simplicity and honesty is their virtue. Great pioneers in the history of Darjeeling and Sikkim, like Dr. Graham, J.C. White, Hooker and other distinguished authors and writers have written in glowing terms about the qualities, loyalties and usefulness of the Lepcha tribe in all spheres of administrative, expeditions and scientific works. The latters’ knowledge of the forests, plants and the mountains was so thorough, extensive and exhaustive that Hooker and White depended upon them completely during their expeditions and travels. Hooker’s scientific works in Darjeeling and Sikkim won him honours, accolades, rewards, international fame and even knighthood, which but for the help and support of the resourceful Lepchas, would not have been possible. His most trusted companion and attendant while travelling in Sikkim was one Lepcha named ‘Mepo’.\n\nReferences:\n\nH.G. Joshi in ‘Sikkim Past and present’\n\nR.N. Thakur ‘Himalayan Lepchas’\n\nG.

White in ‘Sikhim Bhutan’\n\nMainwaring’s ‘Grammar of Rongs’\n\nSonada in Lepcha means bear’s Den\n\nLepcha Language\n\nLepcha, an ancient language—According to Tamsang, the Lepcha language is very ancient, having no traces whatsoever of Mongolian, Semitic or Indo-Germanic origin and that it was given by God while creating the first Lepcha primogenitors.The language is highly developed and comprehensive that it can express anything and everything and for all purposes. The quote taken from page 12 of his ‘The Unknown and Untold Reality about the Lepchas’ reads, “….language is most copious, abounding in synonyms, anotonyms and homonyms and it possesses words to express every slightest meaning. It admits of a flow and power of speech which is most wonderful and which renders it capable of giving expression to the highest degree of eloquence…..all the inconceivable diversity of trees…..variety of plants and flowers with which the forests are filled, the Lepchas can tell the names of all, and this nomenclature extends to beasts, to birds, to insects and to everything around them, animate and inanimate.” In the above mentioned book at page 26, Tamsang also indicates that the script existed much before the advent of Tibetans in the thirteenth century. Even Dharnidhar Dahal in his book, ‘Sikkimko Rajnaitik Itihas’ on page 9 has grudgingly said that the Lepcha language, though cannot be compared with Latin and Sanskrit is more ancient than any other Indian tribal languages.\n\nViews of Mainwaring—Gorer in HIMALAYAN VILLAGE on page 40 has quoted, “After profound thought General Mainwaring came to the conclusion that not only were the Lepchas the descendents of our first parents, but that—as could be simply shown by a device of the General’s called the power of letters—Lepcha was the language spoken in the garden of Eden. Of the people and the language he writes: ‘It is impossible that a people with language so comprehensive; with manners, though primitive, so superior, as to entitle them to rank high among civilised nations,… The language is monosyllabic one (though not altogether an isolating one, as it possesses in a degree – as all languages however primitive do—an agglutinative structure) and is unquestionably far anterior to the Hebrew or Sanskrit……I think, I may without fear of misrepresentation, state it to be the oldest language extent. It is a most comprehensive and beautiful one; regarded alone, as a prolific source of derivations and etyma of words; it is invaluable to the philological world.”\n\nR.N.Thakur’s Opinion—R. N. Thakur in ‘HIMALAYAN LEPCHAS’ on page xi asserts, “… the Lepcha language which is far anterior to Greek, and perhaps not less old than Sanskrit.” Further, he says on page 27, “The lepcha language is one of the most scientific languages…… While naming things the Lepchas categorises the things under different heads and starts the names of a particular group with a particular letter. For example, all the names of wild life start with the letter ‘S’ and all the river names begin with the letter ‘R’”.\n\nSome names of wild animals and the names of the rivers of Sikkim, Bhutan and Nepal (from Thakur’s book, page 27-29) and list of items named in similar manner (Dahal’s ‘Sikkimko Rajnaitik Itihas’ at pages, 10-11) in Lepcha are given below:–\n\nWild life Rivers\n\nSuchyak (leopard) Runyu (Teesta)\n\nSuna (bear) Rudok (Ridak in Bhutan)\n\nSuthong (tiger) Rusa (Tursa in Bhutan)\n\nSuko (deer) Rubyen (Bindu)\n\nSuhu (monkey) Rudye (Jaldhaka)\n\nRuchong (Arun in Nepal)\n\nBamboo items Names of snakes\n\nTangyang(basket,‘Doko’ in Nepali) Punobu(python)\n\nTangyam(Big storing basket,\n\n‘Bhakari’ in Nepali) Pamolbu(black cobra)\n\nTunkyung(cradle) Panolbu[ mud snake)\n\nTalo(mat for drying corn) Pawengbu( found in trees)\n\nPafongbu(green snake) Theories regarding the origin—There are several theories regarding the origin of the language; some say it was invented in 17th century, while others say it was invented in the 7th century. Tamsang and Mainwaring both believe that the language existed from the inception of the Lepcha race. Foning (Lepcha My Vanishing Tribe, page 152) has written, “…according to philologists, one thing is certain: that this language comes within the Tibeto-Burman group of languages that is spoken by the innumerable tribes inhabiting the stretch of the sub-Himalayan region…” In the Bulletin of Tibetology of 1982 No. 2 published by the Sikkim Research Institute of Technology, the author Nita Nirash has said on page 22, that the script was introduced by five Lepcha sages, (1) Targay, (2) Sayoon, (3) Goley, (4) Tungrab and (5) Dooring. Foning has also mentioned on page 156 of his book mentioned above about a Nepalese theory, according to which in the 7th century A.D., Kirata King Maw-rong, invented the Lepcha script for the Lepchas.Tamsang is of the view that the language was given by God while creating the first Lepcha primogenitors.\n\nSome further claims about the invention of the Lepcha script – According to a folk tradition, the script was invented by a legendary leader, Thekung Mensalong, in the17th century. Some scholars claim that Lama Lhatsun Nagkha Jigme (about 1642) alias Lhatsun Chembo was the inventor of the script and according to the ‘Gazetteer of Sikkim’, the third Maharaja, Chador Namgyal (1700-17) invented the script. Dr. R. K. Sprigg, in his book, ‘Shedding Some Light On The History, Language and Literature Of The Lepchas’ on page 47, has written, “ According to Tamsang, who represents an ancient Kalimpong tradition, the earliest known Lepcha king, called Turve Pano, reigned about 1400 AD and his Minister Thikung Mensalong, invented the present Lepcha alphabet contrary to the general supposition that Lepcha script was invented by the third Maharaja 4(4[‘Gazetteer of Sikkim] p. 42; Diet, IX; the Chronicles’)” Both Tamsang and Foning are of the view that the 3rd Chogyal had a troubled time due to attack from Bhutan compelling him to flee to Tibet and later on also having to face the intrigue of his half sister and fight Kirata chiefs. It is true that Chador Namgyal’s hands were full in the short reign of about17 years, out of which, he was in Sikkim for 10 years i.e. between 1707 and 1717 only. He was murdered in 1717 AD and as such the claim of his having invented the Lepcha script cannot be acceptable.\n\nEven if these Tibetan personalities were involved in some way, there might have been some notable Lepcha scholars who did the actual work. May be, it was Thekung Mensalong, since it has been written that Lhatsun Chembo met and interacted with Thekung Mensalong on several occasions. It is possible the language was already in a developed stage and the tradition of writing Namthars in Lepcha by the Lepchas was introduced and followed up by these Tibetan personalities and hence the credit taken for the invention. Besides the Lepcha language is not akin to Tibetan as several authors have vouched for its distinctness of the language. Had the Tibetan authorities or authors been involved for its invention, the language would have been akin to Tibetan. All these theories convincingly prove that the Lepcha language is the most ancient language of Sikkim and this has not been contradicted by any scholar or historian. We have already known that ‘The Treaty of 1835’ for the grant of ‘Darjeeling tract’ was written in Lepcha.\n\nAttempts to identify the Language with existing Language groups – Foning has also mentioned that Robert Shafer, a research scholar, had found the Lepcha language being similar with Naga dialects. R.K. Sprigg calls the Lepcha language, “A mystery language” and quite “remote from any closely related language.” Dr. Sunitikumar Chatterjee has said that the language belonged to the Himalayan Group of the Tibeto-Burman sub-family. According to J.C. White, Lepcha language is a distinct one and is not a dialect of Tibetan. Jahar Sen, in the book refered to above, has also written the views of many scholars on the subject. He has mentioned on page 77, that Arun Maitra in ‘Sikkimer Adivasi Lepcha: Lepcha Upajatir Purnanga Itihas’ had stated that Lepcha script resembled in some important aspects the Arabic script and had conjectured that the Arabic scholars were the inventors of the Lepcha script.Allegation of destruction of ancient Lepcha literature — G.B. Mainwaring and K.K. Das have maintained that even before the advent of the Tibetans, the Lepchas had their own written literature which was destroyed by the Tibetan Buddhists. (Ref: Jahar Sen’s ‘Darjeeling : A Favoured Retreat’ page 79). The same in the words of Mainwaring himself (reference: introductory remarks on ‘Grammar of Rongs’ on page xi) are, “They collected and destroyed the manuscript books of the Lepchas; and translated into Lepcha parts of their own mythological works, under the name of Tashi-sung.” In ‘HIMALAYAN LEPCHAS’ on page 21, R.N.Thakur also says, “…the early writings of the Lepchas were systematically destroyed by the Tibetans.” On page 143 also, he says, “they (Lamas) chose to destroy the original Lepcha religious texts.” In the Hindi publication titled’ ‘Lepcha Adivasi Ek Parichay’ published in November 2005 by ‘Mulbasi Lepcha Tribal Sangstha’, Kalimpong, it is written that ancient Lepcha manuscripts, documents etc. were destroyed in 1826 by Bhotia rulers in Ayong-Gong Chi and other places. It is possible, since many Lepchas were driven out after the murder of Lepcha Prime Minister in 1826 by the Bhutia conspirators and efforts were made to Tibetanise the remaining Lepchas in Sikkim in their day to day life and even in matters of religion and language also. Keeping of Namthars was made mandatory at Lepcha homes as these contained Tibetan scriptures translated into Lepchas, since it also helped in the spread of the Tibetan religion.\n\nFoning in his book, ‘Lepcha My Vanishing Tribe’ on page 156 says, “…the Buddhist Lamas came from Tibet and started to get the Tibetan religious scriptures and books translated into the language of the aboriginal Lepchas.This was primarily and mainly undertaken for the purpose of proselytizing the shamanistic autochthons, and converting them to their faith, Buddhism. According to some scholars, whatever books there were in the land were collected and made a bonfire of.” Gorer in his book ‘HIMALAYAN VILLAGE’ on page 38 has hinted about the possibility of the existence of the language long before the advent of the Tibetans and also about the possibility of some of the old Lepcha compilations being destroyed by the fanatical Lamas when he writes, “…it is said that some specifically Lepcha compilations of mythology and anecdote have been made and possibly some may have escaped the destructive zeal of fanatical Lamas.”\n\nIn view of the above it can be assumed that the earliest Lepcha literature of the pre-1642 period must have been destroyed by the fanatical Bhutia Lamas even though there seems to be no clear cut evidence.\n\nEvidence of use of Lepcha language—About the earliest available Lepcha document, Jahar Sen in ‘Darjeeling A Favoured Retreat’ on page 77 has said, “Diringer’s Alphabet contains the picture of a page from a Lepcha manuscript dated C. 1800 preserved at the India Office Library”; he has further opined at the same page, “The Lepcha language and script must have been very much in use in Darjeeling in 1848 when Joseph Dalton Hooker visited Darjeeling”. Sprigg informs us that he has in his possession a Xerox copy of a Lepcha document found among Hooker’s papers at Kew’s gardens. This was a statement of accounts of expenses for the expenses of his journey to Sikkim, stage by stage, in 1848-49”. Jahar Sen also mentions about Kumar Pradhan possessing a document, written in Lepcha (two loan documents registered at Darjeeling Court between a Limboo and a Lepcha) collected by him in Eastern Nepal and this further confirms the extensive use of Lepcha language in Darjeeling, Sikkim and eastern Nepal. The Thacker’s Director for Bengal, 1865 is also said to mention the existence of a Lepcha Interpreter, as a salaried official in the office of the D.C. Darjeeling. R. Moktan mentions about Lepcha documents dated slightly earlier than 14th April1828, found in pages ‘J’ and ‘M’ of item 190 in National Archive in Delhi. These are said to contain the testimony of two witnesses who had seen the murder of Lepcha Prime Minister, Bolot, in Sikkim in 1826.\n\nThat the Lepcha language was very much in use in the beginning of the 19th century can be confirmed from the quote taken from Foning’s ‘Lepcha, My Vanishing Tribe’ found on page 163, which is reproduced here: “After taking away a part of the kingdom, the very first proclamation that the East India Company issued was in Lepcha. Then on, orders, circulars, and official documents also started appearing in Lepcha language. Later following the trend, the king’s own men, Dzongpens and the Karthacks also started issuing the orders, circulars and other communications in the language; money lenders and other businessmen, considering the Lepcha language to be the sole State language, started keeping their records in Lepcha. This was the time when the British were trying to consolidate their position in this part of the Himalayan region; the time when the Nepalese were not so much encouraged or brought in, in such vast numbers.”\n\nAgain, R.N. Thakur on page 44 alleges, “…these Lamas, according to the old Lepcha chronicles and Edgar’s report disseminated their doctrines. They collected and destroyed the old manuscripts of the Lepchas, and under threats the learned scribes among the Lepchas were made to translate into the Lepcha language parts of their own mythological works, under the name of Tashi-Sung—the history of Tashi.” Jahar Sen in his work, ‘Darjeeling: A Favoured Retreat’ on page 78 mentions that Tashay Namthar or Tashay Sung, containing the biography of Guru Padma Sambhava, who first spread Budhism in Tibet, had been written in Lepcha by Lama Ugen Lingpo sometime in 17th century, and this was intended for the spread of Tibetan form of Buddhism among the Lepchas. Lama Ugen Lingpo may not have written but, as contended by Thakur, Lepcha scholars might have been deployed for the purpose.\n\nAccording to Jahar Sen (on page 78-79), this Tashey Sung along with other Namthar books were utilised by Christian Missionaries (Rev. William Start, Treutier, Stoelke, Schultz and Neibel) in Darjeeling in 1841 for compiling a Lepcha primer and a Lepcha dictionary and that subsequently other missionaries translated the book of Genesis and part of Exodus along with gospels of St John and St Mark into Lepcha. E.C. Dozey in ‘Concise History’ onpage 73 supports this claim when he writes, “Between these missionaries a Nepali and Lepcha dictionary was compiled, while Genesis, part of the Exodus and the Gospels of Mathew, Mark and John were translated into Lepcha.” Sprigg in ‘Shedding Some Light on the History, Language And Literature of the Lepchas’ at page 57. confirms the version given by Jahar Sen and Dozey, when he says, “Start and Niebel, were, thus the first foreigners to translate books from English into Lepcha, namely the Gospels of Mathew, Mark, and John, two of which, as we have already seen, were published during the period1845-49; two bible books were also re-printed after Niebel’s death, ‘The Gospel of John, in Lepcha’, in1872, and ‘The Book of Genesis and part of Exodus in Lepsha’, in1874.” It is therefore evident that the Lepcha language was in advanced stage and extensively used in official, religious and social matters in the 19th century. The quote from Jahar Sen’s book (page 79), reads “In 1903 a book of Catechism and in 1911 a hymn book, both in Lepcha language, were printed. The Lepcha language became the vehicle of Christian prayers, hymns and sermons.”\n\nWho knows, perhaps, had the two noted personalities, Macfarlane who spread Christianity and education in the hills and Ganga Prasad Pradhan, the great Gorkha pioneer, not appeared in the scene in Darjeeling during the 1870s, the Lepcha language would have got the patronage in Darjeeling and could have continued to be used for official as well as for missionary purposes. It was possible, but it has not happened. From this point of view, Ganga Prasad Pradhan must be considered as the pioneer for the cause of Nepali language in Darjeeling and Sikkim. Macfarlane found it convenient to encourage and use Nepali language, as the same was similar to Hindi and having the same alphabets; it could be easily and conveniently used in schools for educational needs of Darjeeling by using the existing Hindi text books readily available from other parts of British India without too much of effort. Ganga Prasad Pradhan, in the meanwhile, had started his own Nepali press and was bringing out periodicals, newsletters etc., and he also wrote the first Nepali bible.\n\nSome of the earliest Lepcha books, after the Namthars period, are —\n\n1. Grammar by Mainwaring, printed in 1876.\n\n2. Dictionary of the Lepcha Language by Mainwaring 1898.\n\n3. The Rong Catechism by Pastor Dyongshi Sada, in 1903\n\n4. The Gospel of Luke by Pastor Dyongshi Sada, in1908\n\nSome of the prominent Lepcha books in the recent past are:—\n\n(1) Lepcha Grammar (1978), by K.P. Tamsang\n\n(2) Lepcha English Encyclopedic Dictionary (1980) by K.P. Tamsang\n\n(3) Lepcha Grammar (1981) by D. Lucksom\n\n(4) Lepcha Hindi Dictionary (1983), D. Lucksom\n\n(5) English to Lepcha Dictionary (1996) by Ugen Shipmu, Karma Lode Rigimu, Naku Tshering Likmu and Dorji Wangdi Kunchudyangmu\n\n(6) Bible ‘Old Testament’ by Father Stoelki.\n\nNamgyal Institute of Tibetology— Lepcha language or for that matter anything that concerns Lepcha, has been neglected by the Tibetan rulers in Sikkim and this can be gauged or confirmed if one visits Namgyal Institute Of Tibetology, where only a few Lepcha documents and manuscripts and some Lepcha artefacts are carelessly displayed. No justice has been done to maintain and update the history and the literature of the most ancient race of Sikkim, the Lepchas, who were the sole masters of Sikkim, only a few centuries ago and this community later supported and propped up the Tibetan Namgyal dynasty for more than 300 years with their blood and sacrifice.The name ‘Tibetology’ itself indicates the primacy the institute has given to matters relating to Tibet. It was because of this tendency of Bhutia rulers to lean towards Tibet and Tibetan matters that brought about the dismemberment of Sikkim at the hands of the British. Since Sikkim is not a part of Tibet, but a part of India, and the ruling authorities at Gangtock are no longer Tibetans, it is high time the present authorities in Sikkim should give serious thought to this matter and take the steps for preserving, safeguarding and maintaining the historical, linguistic and cultural details of the Lepchas, who till some centuries ago, were the only inhabitants and masters of Sikkim and Darjeeling. Perhaps funds from the ‘Culture Department, Govt of India’ could be obtained for the formation and running of a ‘Research Cell’ in Sikkim, once the land of the Lepchas.\n\nPresent Status of the Language — In Sikkim, the Lepcha language has been recognised as a State language along with Sikkimese Bhutia and Nepali and the same is being taught in schools and colleges in Sikkim and the Government publications are also being issued in the language. In Darjeeling, however, the same is gradually disappearing from the Lepcha homes. With the active help of young and educated Lepcha youth volunteers, Lepcha Association Kalimpong is at present running about forty Lepcha night schools. The Constitution of India provides that children in the Primary level should be taught in the mother tongue, but this is not being implemented in case of the Lepchas in Darjeeling. Nepali being the lingua-franca in the hills, nobody takes any interest to teach Lepcha language. The authorities could be moved to consider this matter as justice is so far being denied to the community in safeguarding this unique and ancient language. The provisions of the Constitution are reproduced below:\n\nArticle 350 A. Facilities for instruction in mother-tongue at primary stage — “It shall be the endeavour of every State and of every local authority within the State to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups; and the President may issue any such directions to any such State as he considers necessary for proper securing the provision of such facilities.”\n\nReferences:\n\nK.P.

Of these two types, one is for general and civilian people and the other for use by the soldiery unit members.\n\nGeneral use Thayk Tuk:— It is round in shape and made of fine velvet cloth and at the top in the middle projects out beautifully designed knot of fine red cloth material.\n\nMilitary Thyak Tuk:— This is made up of cane, almost conical in shape, broad at the base and almost pointed at the top adorned with shining mica stones at the middle and also with peacock plumes to give a colourful look.\n\nTago:— Male shirt is also called Tago and it covers the upper body from the hip upwards. From the chest upward it is open and ends with stiff high neck.\n\nTamu:— It is a Lepcha trouser which goes upto the calf.\n\nDum-Praa:— A thick shawl type cloth of different designs, usually stripes of light brown and off white, forms the main male dress. It is worn over Tago and Tamu, secured over the left shoulder with the help of a safety pin, leaving the right shoulder uncovered and free and at the waist it is fastened with a Namrek (belt of cloth). Dum-Praa has to go one inch or so below the knee.\n\nFemale Dress\n\nTago:— A loose shirt made of thin and light cloth material, with long sleeves wich are folded at the wrists when worn, is called Tago. There are no buttons but is worn with the side ends overlapping on the front and thus completely covering almost upto the lower base of neck.\n\nDum-Bun or Dum Dem(Gado):— Fine and soft cloth materials used for sari are usually made into a Dum Dem. Readymade DumDem is not available as the same has to be made from a six metre cloth, cutting out one fourth part and then dividing the said one fourth part into 3 equal parts and joining each such strip along the whole length of the major portion of the cloth material along the bottom to form some sort of a hem. It is worn quite differently than a sari, one end of the DumDem is pulled on the left shoulder from the back and joined there with the upper part of the same cloth brought on the front from below the right arm which is then held there by a fastener or safety pin and the rest of the length is then folded and taken from below the neck to the right shoulder and held there, the remaining length is then turned and taken from below the left armpit to the backside of the right shoulder where it’s upper border is fastened with the part already held on the right shoulder. The remaining length of the dress material is then brought from the right backside from below the right armpit to the front and held straight at the front till a designed belt of cloth, called ‘Namrek’ is tied encircling the body at the waist and then allowing the folded portion held in front to fall forward in well made folds of about one feet. This portion that hangs out in front is called Dum Pyum and gives the dress a unique look. Wearing a Lepcha DumDem is therefore more difficult and cumbrous than wearing a sari. However, the dress is graceful, elegant and obviously quite distinct. It is learnt that because of its gracefulness, sometimes, a few Limbu ladies of Sikkim make it a point to wear similar dress but without Dum Pyum.\n\nTaro:— A head scarf called Taro is also worn by the ladies usually.\n\nReferences:\n\nRen. Suryaman Lepcha’s personal hand note.\n\nSikkim Government Publication ‘The Rongs [Lepchas] ’\n\nMirik in Lepcha means ‘burnt by fire’\n\nReligion of the Lepchas\n\nOld Religion of the Lepchas:— Pleasing and pampering Mungs or devils was the way of life of the Lepchas. Many people still fear touching sacred and secret things kept in Lepcha homes or treading on the Lepcha ginger field or fruits and vegetables gardens, as sometimes their hands get immobilized due to certain invisible powers which only the Lepcha head of the family can cure. It is also said that similar experience will be faced when going in the backyard garden of Rais or Limbus, which in Nepali is called “Dewa Lagyo”, meaning ‘affected by god’.\n\nAt present, the Lepchas are either Buddhists or Christians. The old religions of the Lepchas were the Munism and the Bongthingism religion. Though nowadays, we do not find many following this faith, but some people in the interior still practise this religion side by side with the Lamaist Buddhism. The fact that Buddhism as well as Bongthingism was simultaneously followed by the Lepchas can be confirmed from the observation made by Dr. Graham in his book, ‘THREE CLOSED LANDS’ on page 50, about a prominent Lepcha personality of Kalimpong in the beginning of the 20th century. Dr. Graham has said, “Tenduk, though a Lepcha, was an orthodox Buddhist……… Tenduk had his offerings made in times of illness by the Bongthing or sacrificial priest, to propitiate the angry demon.”\n\nThe general view about the present Bhuddhist Lepchas is best expressed by Gorer (reference:Gorer’s ‘Himalayan Village’, page 274), where he says, “It is possible that before the conversion to Lamaism, the Lepchas felt more strongly that they possessed the only correct way of dealing with the supernatural; but now that they have accepted the idea that there are two alternative methods for dealing with nearly every devil they can accept without difficulty further alien methods founded on similar hypothesis.” Miss Nita Nirash in her article titled ‘The Lepchas of Sikkim’ published by Sikkim Research Institute of Tibetology under the series 1982, No. 2 has observed on page 19, “The religion practised by them nowadays is a synthesis of Buddhism and Bonism.”\n\nH.G. Joshi’s view on Mun and Bongthing— H.G. Joshi, who claims to have carried out extensive research into the cult of Mun and Bongthing writes on page 167 of his book, ‘Sikkim Past and Present’ : “The Mun and the Bongthing bear the closest resemblance to the Barwas of the Bhils, the Pariar or Parihar of the Korkus (Central India), the Natravadis of the Parayans and Pulayans (South India), and the Matravadis of many other primitive tribes of India. We find here a very old class of magicians who have maintained their primitive tradition, and have well established rites and rules.” The author further writes on page 168, that the Muns and The Bongthings were. “Established as mediators between God and men and as the protectors of man against the machinations of the demons.” The practices of the Mun and the Bongthing appear to be similar to that of Rai and Limbus of the Kirata tribe.\n\nTamsang’s view regarding the origin of Mun-Bonthingism—K. P. Tamsang in the book mentioned above has written at page 43 as follows:-\n\n“The Lepchas have their own ancient religion called Boongthingism and Munism. Their religion is simple. They believe in the existence of a God called Rum, and to Him they offer their prayers and thanksgivings. The first fruits of the season are always offered to God. They also believe in evil spirits who cause illness and misfortune, and to them also they offer offerings.” The author again writes on page 44:— “Lepcha tradition says that when Lord Tamsangthing arrived at Tarkaol Tam-E-Tam from Pundim Cho (Mt. Pandim) to deliver the Lepchas from the clutches of the demon king, Laso Mung Pano, what he found was that the Lepchas were so much degraded by the harassment of the demons, particularly of Laso Mung Pano, and not to speak of fighting with them. So, in order to rejuvenate their morale, Lord Tamsangthing wished to give the supernatural powers to a chaste man and chaste woman and made them to bring back the lost morale and philosophy of the Lepchas. Thus the first consecrated Boongthing was Thikung Azaor Boongthing and the first consecrated Mun was Nyookoong Nyoolik Mun.”\n\nSanchita Ghatak’s findings about the functions of Mun and Bongthing:— Sanchita Ghatak, in her book, “People of India, Sikkim” on page 100 writes, “The chief function of the Mun is to ward off the misfortunes and illness caused by the Devils (Mung). This is accomplished partly by sacrifices, especially animal sacrifices”. The author further writes, “The malignant (mung) spirit, the Lepchas believe, resides everywhere, in the trees, bushes, rocks, and rivers. The daily lives of the Lepchas, their religion and ceremonies are based on an effort to propitiate these mungs with ritual, sacrifices and incarnation”.\n\nMun-Bongthingism and the sacrifices to ward off devils:— In the earlier chapter relating to the origin of Lepchas, in the version on the origin of first Lepcha man and woman written by John Morris, it has been mentioned about how Tashay Thing and Nazongnyu(the children of Itbumu and Kumsiting,) being brother and sister, first gave birth to devils (Mung) and later non-devil child, Ril Bu Shing, and the problem cropped up due to the eating of non-demonic by the devils. In the passage, Morris mentions as to how later Kumsiting sorted out by allowing the devils to eat the souls of human beings except in the case of those on whose behalf offerings have been made by the Bongthing or the Mun. There is a firm belief among the Lepchas that if close relatives marry, their children will die or become Mungs and that is why there is taboo in marrying between brother and sister and even among cousins.\n\nIt seems that from the very inception of Lepcha man and Lepcha woman, the services of the Mun and the Bongthing have been made essential for their protection from the devils i.e. Mungs. It is said that the Mun and the Bongthing have similar roles and functions except that the Mun has superior role i.e that of taking care of the soul of the dead. Hence the funeral ritual has to be performed by the Mun only. Bongthing is also called ‘Yaba’ and the Mun ‘Yama’. The profession of Mun and Bongthing can be taken by those who have the inward inclination and calling, and after certain signs are developed in them, they need to be initiated by the Guru who will finetune their knowledge and skill. Chi and animals are offered during the ritual and the Bongthing/Mun commands the evil spirit to go from the affected place or area.\n\nHeleen Plaisier, in her artcle, ‘A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF LEPCHA ORTHGRAPHY AND LITERATURE’ on page 9, published in the BULLETIN OF TIBETOLOGY, under volume 41, No.1 by the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, Gangtock, writes, “The central religious roles in the Lepcha community are traditionally occupied by the Mun and Bongthing, who both fuction as shamans. The Bongthing is traditionally a male shaman who presides at recurring religious ceremonies and seasonal festivals and may heal acute illness. The mun, often but necessarily a female shaman, is a healer who exorcises demons, helps to heal illness and guides souls to the afterlife. It is possible for a Bongthing to develop into Mun.”\n\nTestimony of Adur Tshering Lepcha, A Bongthing of Kalimpong (Ref: ‘Lepchas of Darjeeling District’ by A.K. Das, page 160) — “My father was a Bongthing and being his eldest son I assumed the profession of Bongthing, which is a hereditary one. I learnt the magico-religious rites from my father who before his death passed it on to me. If my father had died suddenly, having no time to pass on to me his secrets, I could not have become a Bongthing. No, no, don’t press me, I do not know any Mantras or magic. Bongthingism is dying day by day. Of course, it has got value and it has done many good things but people are losing faith in it. Yes, I have done many good things. Oh no, there is no magic in it.”\n\nThis has been given to show that ‘Mun-Bongthingism’ is hereditary and the skill has to be learnt from father to son or from parent to the offspring or from the teacher or Guru. But the person desiring to learn profession must have inner urge or some sort of inward calling, desire or inclination to the creed before one can be initiated into the profession.\n\nAnimal sacrifices—The practices of Mun and Bongthing have, however, greatly dwindled in Lepcha villages nowadays, but still, Lepcha Buddhists, even though not following Mun/Bongthingism strictly, in the interior areas, have the tendency of making animal sacrifices on the slightest excuse like sickness or any problem, as it has become a traditional habit. The instances of continuing this practice of sacrificing animals, pigs, goats, chicken etc to cure from sickness is still common among the Lepchas.This can be confirmed if one verifies by asking people in the villages.\n\nGraham has also mentioned the practices of frequent sacrifices (reference: page 40 of the book by Morris) in the Lepcha homes, “Another fruitful cause of poverty among the Lepchas is their sacrifice of cattle and fowls on the advice of their priests in times of illness. Until that is stopped by the deliverance from the fear of evil spirits the Lepchas remain poor. I have known it in times of prolonged and frequent illness in a family that every animal they have was given in sacrifice; and, in addition, a promise given that when they are in a better position to keep the pledge they will give the required animals to the spirits. No one will dare to break the pledge until he is freed from this wasteful superstition.”\n\nBuddhism followed by the Lepchas:—Buddhism followed by the Lepchas is ‘Nying-mapa’ (Red Hat) sect started in Sikkim by Lama, Lhatsun Chemba in the 17th century. This Lama was one of the three Lamas who installed the first Chogyal of Sikkim. John Morris in the book on page 71 referred to above writes, “ Nying-mapa – is more freely tinged than any other with pre-Buddhist practices and its Lamas are required neither to remain celibate nor to practice abstinence. “It regards the metaphysical Buddha Samantabhadra as its primordial deity or Adi-Buddha. Its mystic insight is Mohautpanna or the “great ultimate perfection”. Its tutelaries are “The fearful Vajra and Dub-pa-koh-gye”. Its guardian demon is “The Lord Gur. It worships the Guru Padma-sambhava, the founder of Lamaism, in a variety of forms, both divine and demoniacal, expressive of his different moods at different times, and also his Kashmiri teacher, Sri Sinha, and the Indian teacher of the latter, Gah-rab-Dorje, who derived his inspiration from the celestial Buddha, Vajra-satwa, who in turn was inspired by the primordial deity, Samanta-bhadra-Buddha”. According to Tamsang, Buddhism followed in Kalimpong subdivision i.e. by the Tamsangmoo Rongs are slightly different from the one followed by the Renjyong Rongs since Tamsang region was under the influence of Bhutan for a considerable period.\n\nCoexistence of Lamaism and Bongthingism — Morris (page70) has written: “ A notable feature of Lamaism throughout all its sects,” notes Waddel, “and decidedly un-Buddhistic, is that the Lama is a priest rather than a monk. He assigns himself an indispensable place in the religion and has coined the current saying, ‘Without a Lama in front there is no (approach to) God.’ He performs sacredotal functions on every possible occasion, and a large proportion of this order is almost entirely engaged in this work. And such services are in much demand, for the people are in hopeless bondage to the demons, and not altogether unwilling slaves to their exacting worship.” However, for the Lepcha Buddhists, both Lamaism and Mun-Bongthism find equal place. Heleen Plaisier of Leiden University, in her article, ‘A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO LEPCHA ORTHGRAPHY AND LITERATURE’ on page 9, published in the Bulletin of Tibetology by the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, Gangtok, in May 2005 has written, “In the eighteenth century, the Lepcha people were converted to Buddhism, although indigenous Lepcha shamanism managed to coexist with Buddhist customs and beliefs. Both Buddist Lamas and Lepcha Bongthings preside at many important ceremonies in Lepcha life, each to perform their own rituals.”\n\nHooker in ‘Himalayan Journals’ Vol. 1, page 364, writes, “…this invocation of the gods of the woods and waters forms no part of Lama worship; but the Lepchas are half Buddhists; in their hearts they dread the demons of the grove, the lake, the snowy mountain and the torrent, and the crafty Lama takes advantage of this, modifies his practices to suit their requirements, and is content with the formal recognition of the spiritual supremacy of the church.” A.K. Das in ‘The Lepchas of Darjeeling’ on page 106, termed the Buddhist Lepchas as ‘animist Buddhists’.\n\nLamaism Buddhism not fully absorbed by the Lepchas:—The holy books are written in Tibetan and as such there may be few Lepcha Lamas who could fully understand and explain the true meaning and philosophy contained in the holy books they read. Gorer in ‘Himalayan Village’ on page 193, has thus remarked, “ The Lepchas have been converts to Lamaism at least one, and probably two centuries, but they have, if I may so express it, sterilised and ignored those aspects of the alien religion which were sharply opposed to their major existing attitudes. They have, as it were, swallowed Lamaism whole, but excreted the irritating portions.” Morris in his book, ‘Living With Lepchas’ on page 287, has said, “ Of religion little need be said except that in Jongu the Lamas are priests only in name; they have no learning beyond a smattering of Tibetan and are incapable of expounding even the elements of their doctrine.” The same author in another passage on page 285, has further said, “…for the Buddhism practised in Jongu has degenerated into little more than an elaboration of the original propitiation of evil spirits to which these people were always enslaved.” Because of the language problem and because of the unhelpful attitude of the Bhutias and the Bhutia Lamas, Lepchas had practically no scope to absorb and adopt Buddhism fully and completely.\n\nLepcha Buddhists treated as Second class Buddhists—- It is doubtful if important monasteries in Sikkim have any Lepcha Lama. Second class treatment is perpetrated even in religion. Lepchas complain that there have so far been no Lepcha Autari (incarnate) i.e. Rimboche. Lyangsong Tamsang, General Secretary, Indigenous Lepcha Association, Kalimpong, in his article titled, ‘The Lepcha Adivasis of Darjeeling District’ published in R. Moktan’s book, ‘SIKKIM:DARJEELING’ has also expressed similar view when he says, “Since 1642, the Lepchas of Sikkim, the Darjeeling hills and Illam, Nepal, have very faithfully followed Lamaism but, unfortunately, to keep the record straight, there had never been a single Lepcha ‘Rimpoche’ in Nye Maayel Renjyong Lyaang, and the Lepchas doubt if there will ever be in future.”\n\nGorer in the book on page 36 referred to above has said, “ from the time of establishment of a Sikkimese kingdom the Lepchas have become an ‘inferior’ subject race under the domination of the Sikkimese Tibetans or Bhotias, to which the Maharajas and the big land owners belonged. For a considerable period the Lepchas were debarred on account of their race from entering the Lamaist monasteries, though this rule is now relaxed, it is questionable whether a Lepcha could today obtain an important position in the big monasteries outside the Lepcha preserve.” Again he has written on page 189, “…But for a long time – even today in some of the monasteries of Sikkim—Lepchas and other foreigners are not accepted for training as Lamas, this privilege being exclusive to pure-born and healthy Tibetans and Sikkimese (Bhotias).”\n\nIndira Awasty also in ‘Between Sikkim and Bhutan’ on pages 36 – 37 has described the supremacy of Bhutias in Lamaism, where she has observed, “A few Lepchas have been initiated as Lamas, but generally the hold of the Tibetan Lama and his decrees were all powerful and pervading. Rich Tibetan traders came to have a great grip and influence over the land. Very expensive marriage and death ceremonies were prescribed.”\n\nDisenchantment with Buddism — H.G. Joshi has also cited similar reasons for disenchantment of the Lepchas from Buddhism. The quote taken from page 157 of his book ‘Sikkim Past and Present’ reads, “The conversion of the Lepchas from Buddhism to Christianity still goes unabated. That the Lepchas have been able to forsake Buddhism more easily than the Bhutias could be due to many reasons. One of the reasons is the shallow vertical spread of Buddhism among the Lepchas. This in turn was due to the inimical relations these two communities had for centuries and the forced subservience of the Lepchas to the Bhutias. Because of all this, the Lepchas did never feel Buddhism as something of their own but a religion of their masters, conquerors or rulers-the Bhutias”.\n\nEmbracing Christianity—May be because of the discrimination perpetrated by the Bhutias in Sikkim and also due to the advantages offered by the new foreign religion, nowadays we find many Lepchas have embraced Christianity. Indira Awasty in her book, ‘Between Sikkim and Bhutan’ on page 40 has written, “The Lepchas readily accepted Christianity because it gave a lot of material advantages in regard to medicines, legal help and general morale raising advice. The Lamaistic religion was not duly imbued in these people. Their only contact with the religion was the disposal of the dead body by the Lamas. The hold of the lamas with their expensive series of prayers, in addition to back-breaking marriage feast expenses added to the burden of already non-frugal habits of the Lepchas.”\n\nExpensive Buddhism Rituals — Earlier death rituals under Buddhism was very expensive. Chi and slaughter of animals had to be invariably arranged during marriage and funeral services. For marriage functions, however, nobody grudges the expenses even though it is unbearable as Chi and slaughter of animals have to be resorted to in both marriage and funeral functions. Shradh(Sanglion) ceremony is fixed on 14th or 21st day from the date of death and prior to that Chi must be prepared. Lama rituals usually lasts two days and for those two days the Lamas and the visitors have to be fed. There are instances of Lamas being angry and quarrelsome if good Chi and good food with meat are not served to them. Reports of quarrels and scuffles on such occasions due to chee drinking are often heard. According to the status of the deceased all kinds of animals like Bull, Buffallo, goat, pig etc have to be slaughtered. On top of that, Lamas have to be given Dakshinas in cash according to the grade of the Lamas. Usually three to five Lamas perform the rituals, but if the status of the deceased is high all the Lamas of the area have to be invited for the occasion. Of course, nowadays the expenses have been curtailed to a great extent almost in all villages by the concerned communities by mutual consent. During the funeral services and Sanglion functions, nowadays, in many areas, by mutual agreement of all members of the local community, no meat is served, but food items have to be served to all. There is, however, unwritten convention in all villages whereby"
