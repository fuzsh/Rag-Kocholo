        "text": "Mummified fossil woods of Fagaceae from the upper Oligocene of Guangxi, South China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Luliang; Jin, Jianhua; Quan, Cheng; Oskolski, Alexei A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThree new fossil species, two attributed to the genus Castanopsis (C. nanningensis and C. guangxiensis) and one to the organ genus Lithocarpoxylon (L. nanningensis) are described on the basis of well-preserved mummified wood from the upper Oligocene of Yongning Formation in the Nanning Basin, Guangxi Province, South China. The two species of Castanopsis represent the most ancient reliable wood record of this genus in China and also southeastern Asia, which is the center of diversity of extant species. The fossil leaf records of Castanopsis indicated this genus has migrated to South China in the late Eocene. This fossil wood evidence confirms the presence and persistence of Castanopsis in this region in the late Oligocene. In the Yongning Formation, the presence of numerous Fagaceae woods with faint or absent growth ring boundaries (in C. nanningensis) occasionally associated with prominent ring-porous patterns, suggests that Guangxi (South China) had a seasonal (probably monsoonal) tropical climate during the late Oligocene.\n\nTaxonomic study of the leafhopper genus Thagria Melichar (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Coelidiinae) from Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nFan, Zhi-Hua; Li, Zi-Zhong; Dai, Ren-Huai\n\n2015-02-13\n\nThe paper deals with 21 valid species of the genus Thagria from Guangxi Autonomous Region, China. Eight new species are described and illustrated: T. biprocessa Fan & Dai, sp. nov., T. decussata Fan & Dai, sp. nov., T. irregularis Fan & Dai, sp. nov., T. multispinosa Fan & Dai, sp. nov., T. paramultipars Fan & Li, sp. nov., T. triangula Fan & Li, sp. nov., T. trifasciata Fan & Li, sp. nov. and T. webbi Fan & Li, sp. nov.. A key is given to distinguish all species of this genus from Guangxi, China and maps showing the geographic distribution of new species are also provided. The name Thagria xuae nom. emend. is given for T. xui Nielson.\n\nDevonian rocks and Lower and Middle Devonian pelecypods of Guangxi, China, and the Traverse Group of Michigan\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPojeta, John\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA state-of-the-art summary of the Devonian rocks of China, correlation of the Lower and Middle Devonian of the Guangxi Autonomous Region with the European Standards, and detailed lithologic descriptions of the major Lower and Middle Devonian sections in Guangxi from which pelecypods were collected. Systematic descriptions are given for the Lower and Middle Devonian pelecypods of Guangxi. The Chinese pelecypods are principally compared with the previously little studied Givetian pelecypods of Michigan, which are also described.\n\nLyssavirus surveillance in bats of southern China's Guangxi Province.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Zhuan-Ling; Wang, Wen; Yin, Wei-Li; Tang, Hai-Bo; Pan, Yan; Liang, Xiang; Liu, Qi; Xiong, Yi; Minamoto, Nobuyuki; Luo, Ting Rong\n\n2013-04-01\n\nAlthough rabies virus is widely distributed in the world, and has been the subject of extensive investigations with the objective of its ultimate prevention, control, and management, there is much less knowledge of the characteristics, distribution, and infectivity of other lyssaviruses. Since bats are known animal vectors for all but one of the known lyssavirus genotypes, we have performed an extensive survey of bats in the Guangxi Province to provide information on lyssavirus distribution in southern China. The lyssavirus nucleoprotein gene was detected in brains of 2.86 % of 2,969 bats. Nucleotide sequence homologies among isolates were 86.9-99.6 %, but only 70.0-85.0 % for lyssaviruses in GenBank. These infected bats were detected from a wide area, essentially forming a band running from the south-west to the north-east of Guangxi, and it appears that infection by new lyssaviruses is widespread in this region.\n\nSeven new species of the Stenus cirrus group (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) from Guangxi, South China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Sheng-Nan; Tang, Liang\n\n2017-05-16\n\nSeven new species of the Stenus cirrus group collected from Guangxi, South China are described and illustrated: S. hujiayaoi Liu and Tang, sp. n., S. bullatus Liu and Tang, sp. n., S. exesus Liu and Tang, sp. n., S. damingshanus Liu and Tang, sp. n., S. jinxiuensis Liu and Tang, sp. n., S. lianhuashanus Liu and Tang, sp. n., S. hechiensis Liu and Tang, sp. n. The diagnostic characters of the new species are illustrated, and a key to species of the group from Guangxi is provided.\n\nNew species and records of the stonefly genus Neoperla (Plecoptera, Perlidae) from Jinhuacha Nature Reserve, Guangxi of China.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Guo-Quan; Li, Wei-Hai; Yang, Juan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTwo new Neoperla species (Neoperla mesospina, Neoperla latispina) are described from the adult male stage from the Jinhuacha Nature Reserve, Guangxi of China. The new species are compared with similar taxa. Taxonomic remarks are also provided for N. transversprojecta Du & Sivec and N. yao Stark. The latter species is newly recorded for Guangxi.\n\nRe-emergence of rabies in the Guangxi province of Southern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Hai-Bo; Pan, Yan; Wei, Xian-Kai; Lu, Zhuan-Ling; Lu, Wu; Yang, Jian; He, Xiao-Xia; Xie, Lin-Juan; Zeng, Lan; Zheng, Lie-Feng; Xiong, Yi; Minamoto, Nobuyuki; Luo, Ting Rong\n\n2014-10-01\n\nHuman rabies cases in the Guangxi province of China decreased from 839 in 1982 to 24 in 1995, but subsequently underwent a sharp increase, and has since maintained a high level. 3,040 brain samples from normal dogs and cats were collected from 14 districts of Guangxi and assessed by RT-PCR. The brain samples showed an average rabies virus (RV) positivity rate of 3.26%, but reached 4.71% for the period Apr 2002 to Dec 2003. A total of 30 isolates were obtained from normal dogs and 28 isolates from rabid animals by the mouse inoculation test (MIT). Six representative group I and II RV isolates showed an LD50 of 10-5.35/ml to 10-6.19/ml. The reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to group I and II RV isolates from the Guangxi major epidemic showed that eight anti-G MAbs showed strong reactivity with isolates of group I and II with titers of â¥10,000; however, the MAbs 9-6, 13-3 and 12-14 showed lower reactivity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the G gene demonstrated that the Guangxi RV isolates have similar topologies with strong bootstrap values and are closely bonded. Alignment of deduced amino acids revealed that the mature G protein has four substitutions A96S, L132F, N436S, and A447I specific to group I, and 13 substitutions T90M, Y168C, S204G, T249I, P253S, S289T, V332I, Q382H, V427I, L474P, R463K Q486H, and T487N specific to group II, coinciding with the phylogenetic analysis of the isolates. Re-emergence of human rabies has mainly occurred in rural areas of Guangxi since 1996. The human rabies incidence rate increased is related with RV positive rate of normal dogs. The Guangxi isolates tested showed a similar pathogenicity and antigenicity. The results of phylogenetic analysis coincide with that of alignment of deduced amino acids.\n\nNew species and records of the stonefly genus Neoperla (Plecoptera, Perlidae) from Jinhuacha Nature Reserve, Guangxi of China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, GuoâQuan; Li, WeiâHai; Yang, Juan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAbstract Two new Neoperla species (Neoperla mesospina, Neoperla latispina) are described from the adult male stage from the Jinhuacha Nature Reserve, Guangxi of China. The new species are compared with similar taxa. Taxonomic remarks are also provided for N. transversprojecta Du & Sivec and N. yao Stark. The latter species is newly recorded for Guangxi. PMID:24294087\n\n[Hydrological characteristics of calcareous soil with contrasting architecture on dolomite slope of Northwest Guangxi].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Xing; Wang, Ke Lin; Fu, Zhi Yong; Chen, Hong Song; Zhang, Wei; Shi, Zhi Hua\n\n2017-07-18\n\nThe traditional hydrology method, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope technology, and rainfall simulation method were combined to investigate the hydrological function of small experimental plots (2 mÃ1.2 m) of contrasting architecture in Northwest Guangxi dolomite area. There were four typical catenary soils along the dolomite peak-cluster slope, which were the whole-sand, up-loam and down-sand, the whole loam, up-clay and down-sand soil types, respectively. All the experimental plots generated little amounts of overland runoff and had a high surface infiltration rate, ranging from 41 to 48 mmÂ·h -1 , and the interflow and deep percolation were the dominant hydrological progress. The interflow was classified into interflow in soil clay A and C according to soil genetic layers. For interflow in soil clay A, matrix flow was generated from the whole-sand, up-loam and down-sand, up-clay and down-sand soil types, but preferential flow dominated in the whole-loam soil type. As for interflow in soil clay C, preferential flow dominated in the whole-loam, up-clay and down-sand, up-loam and down-sand soil types. The soils were shallow yet continuously distributed along the dolomite slope. The difference of hydrological characteristics in soil types with different architectures mainly existed in the runoff generation progress of each interface underground. It proved that the a 3-D perspective was needed to study the soil hydrological functions on dolomite slope of Northwest Guangxi, and a new way paying more attention on underground hydrological progress should be explored to fully reveal the near-surface hydrological processes on karst slope.\n\nCoping, social support, stigma, and gender difference among people living with HIV in Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiao, Zhiwen; Li, Xiaoming; Qiao, Shan; Zhou, Yuejiao; Shen, Zhiyong\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe current study examined whether gender, HIV-related stigma, social support, and the interaction between gender and social support are associated with coping responses among people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) in Guangxi, China. A total of 2987 PLWHA in Guangxi participated from October 2012 to August 2013. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted with gender and social support as main factors in the model, and stigma and other variables as covariates. After controlling for demographic variables and stigma, there were significant main effects of emotional social support (FÂ =Â 1.61, pÂ <Â .001), functional social support (FÂ =Â 1.67, pÂ <Â .001), and informational social support (FÂ =Â 3.67, pÂ <Â .001) on various coping strategies. The interaction between gender and informational social support (FÂ =Â 1.33, pÂ <Â .05), internalized stigma (FÂ =Â 37.03, pÂ <Â .001) and perceived stigma (FÂ =Â 9.16, pÂ <Â .001) were associated with various coping strategies. Findings signify the importance of HIV-related stigma and social support differences in the coping strategies among PLWHA in Guangxi, China.\n\nComplete Genome Sequence of Porcine Parvovirus N Strain Isolated from Guangxi, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSu, Qian-Lian; Li, Bin; Liang, Jia-Xing; He, Ying; Qin, Yi-Bin; Lu, Bing-Xia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe report here the complete genomic sequence of the porcine parvovirus (PPV) N strain, isolated in 1989 from the viscera of a stillborn fetus farrowed by a gilt in Guangxi, southern China. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the PPV-N strain is closely related to attenuated PPV NADL-2 strains. The PPV-N strain has good immunogenicity, genetic stability, and safety. PMID:25573932\n\nZoonotic helminths parasites in the digestive tract of feral dogs and cats in Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nFang, Fang; Li, Jian; Huang, Tengfei; Guillot, Jacques; Huang, Weiyi\n\n2015-08-16\n\nIn Guangxi, a province of southern China, an important number of dogs and cats roam freely in rural settings, and the presence of these animals in proximity of people may represent a risk of parasitic zoonoses. The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence and identify gastrointestinal helminths in feral carnivores in Guangxi province. Therefore, post mortem examination was performed in 40 dogs and in 39 cats. The Gastrointestinal helminths were found in all the necropsied dogs and in 37 out of 39 cats. Fifteen species were identified including 7 trematodes, 3 cestodes and 5 nematodes. Most of them may be responsible for zoonotic infections. Major zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths, including liver and intestinal flukes, Toxocara spp., and Ancylostoma spp., are present in feral dogs and cats in Guangxi, and may represent a significant risk for public health.\n\nComplete genome sequence of porcine parvovirus N strain isolated from guangxi, china.\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Qian-Lian; Li, Bin; Zhao, Wu; Liang, Jia-Xing; He, Ying; Qin, Yi-Bin; Lu, Bing-Xia\n\n2015-01-08\n\nWe report here the complete genomic sequence of the porcine parvovirus (PPV) N strain, isolated in 1989 from the viscera of a stillborn fetus farrowed by a gilt in Guangxi, southern China. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the PPV-N strain is closely related to attenuated PPV NADL-2 strains. The PPV-N strain has good immunogenicity, genetic stability, and safety.

The whole nucleotide sequence had the highest homology (97.2%) with the sequence of strain TC/2002 (GenBank accession number AY394721.1) and had a low homology (76.8% to 78.6%) with the sequences of other strains isolated from China, Germany, and the United States. This report will help to understand the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of Guangxi pockmark duck circovirus in southern China.\n\nAnisotropic patterns of liver cancer prevalence in Guangxi in Southwest China: is local climate a contributing factor?\n\nPubMed\n\nDeng, Wei; Long, Long; Tang, Xian-Yan; Huang, Tian-Ren; Li, Ji-Lin; Rong, Min-Hua; Li, Ke-Zhi; Liu, Hai-Zhou\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGeographic information system (GIS) technology has useful applications for epidemiology, enabling the detection of spatial patterns of disease dispersion and locating geographic areas at increased risk. In this study, we applied GIS technology to characterize the spatial pattern of mortality due to liver cancer in the autonomous region of Guangxi Zhuang in southwest China. A database with liver cancer mortality data for 1971-1973, 1990-1992, and 2004-2005, including geographic locations and climate conditions, was constructed, and the appropriate associations were investigated. It was found that the regions with the highest mortality rates were central Guangxi with Guigang City at the center, and southwest Guangxi centered in Fusui County. Regions with the lowest mortality rates were eastern Guangxi with Pingnan County at the center, and northern Guangxi centered in Sanjiang and Rongshui counties. Regarding climate conditions, in the 1990s the mortality rate of liver cancer positively correlated with average temperature and average minimum temperature, and negatively correlated with average precipitation. In 2004 through 2005, mortality due to liver cancer positively correlated with the average minimum temperature. Regions of high mortality had lower average humidity and higher average barometric pressure than did regions of low mortality. Our results provide information to benefit development of a regional liver cancer prevention program in Guangxi, and provide important information and a reference for exploring causes of liver cancer.\n\nCosts, Trends, and Related Factors in Treating Lung Cancer Patients in 67 Hospitals in Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Li-Fang; Zhang, Mao-Xin; Kong, Ling-Qian; Lyman, Gary H; Wang, Ke; Lu, Wei; Feng, Qi-Ming; Wei, Bo; Zhao, Lue Ping\n\n2017-05-28\n\nLung cancer is a common disease with high mortality in China. Recent economic advances have led to improved medical capabilities, while costs associated with treating this disease have increased. Such change contributes to a commonly held belief that healthcare costs are out of control. However, few studies have examined this issue. Here, we use 34,678 hospitalization summary reports from 67 Guangxi hospitals (period 2013-2016) to document costs, temporal trends, and associated factors. Findings from this study are surprising in that they debunk the myth of uncontrolled healthcare costs. In addition, results and experiences from Guangxi are informative for other comparable regions.\n\nRelative importance of climate changes at different time scales on net primary productivity-a case study of the Karst area of northwest Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Huiyu; Zhang, Mingyang; Lin, Zhenshan\n\n2017-10-05\n\nClimate changes are considered to significantly impact net primary productivity (NPP). However, there are few studies on how climate changes at multiple time scales impact NPP. With MODIS NPP product and station-based observations of sunshine duration, annual average temperature and annual precipitation, impacts of climate changes at different time scales on annual NPP, have been studied with EEMD (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) method in the Karst area of northwest Guangxi, China, during 2000-2013. Moreover, with partial least squares regression (PLSR) model, the relative importance of climatic variables for annual NPP has been explored. The results show that (1) only at quasi 3-year time scale do sunshine duration and temperature have significantly positive relations with NPP. (2) Annual precipitation has no significant relation to NPP by direct comparison, but significantly positive relation at 5-year time scale, which is because 5-year time scale is not the dominant scale of precipitation; (3) the changes of NPP may be dominated by inter-annual variabilities. (4) Multiple time scales analysis will greatly improve the performance of PLSR model for estimating NPP. The variable importance in projection (VIP) scores of sunshine duration and temperature at quasi 3-year time scale, and precipitation at quasi 5-year time scale are greater than 0.8, indicating important for NPP during 2000-2013. However, sunshine duration and temperature at quasi 3-year time scale are much more important. Our results underscore the importance of multiple time scales analysis for revealing the relations of NPP to changing climate.\n\nPrevention and control of Hb Bart's disease in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Sheng; Zhang, Qiang; Li, Dongming; Chen, Shaoke; Tang, Yanqing; Chen, Qiuli; Zheng, Chenguang\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTo demonstrate the performance of Hb Bart's Disease prevention in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. A prenatal control program for Hb Bart's disease was conducted from January 2006 to December 2012. A total of 17,555 pregnant women were screened for Î±-thalassemia in our prenatal screening program. Pregnancy at-risk for Hb Bart's disease was offered the choice of direct invasive testing or the non-invasive approach with serial ultrasonography. A total of 1425 at-risk couples attended the prenatal diagnosis. Three hundred ninety couples were screened at our own hospital, and the remaining 1035 couples were referred from other hospitals. Two hundred and three pregnant women chose non-invasive approach, and 1122 chose invasive testing. A total of 365 fetuses were diagnosed with Hb Bart's disease. All cases were finally confirmed by fetal DNA analysis. Eighty-two cases (22.4%) were diagnosed by chorionic villous sampling and 194 (53.2%) by amniocentesis samples. The other 89 (24.4%) cases were performed by cordocentesis. All of the affected pregnancies were terminated. Implementation of a prevention and control program accompanying with a referral system for prenatal diagnosis is technically feasible in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.

This study aimed to project the future disease burden of bacillary dysentery associated with floods in Guangxi, China. Relying on the longitudinal data, a generalized additive mixed model was applied to quantify the relationship between the monthly morbidity of bacillary dysentery and floods with two severity levels from 2004 to 2010, controlling for other meteorological variables. Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) was used as the measure of the burden of bacillary dysentery in the future of Guangxi, China. According to the generalized additive mixed model, the relative risks (RR) of moderate and severe floods on the morbidity of bacillary dysentery were 1.17 (95% CI: 1.03-1.33) and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.14-1.70), respectively. The regression analysis also indicated that the flood duration was negatively associated with the morbidity of bacillary dysentery (with RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.90). Considering the effects of floods only, compared with the YLDs in 2010, increasing flood events may lead to a 4.0% increase in the YLDs for bacillary dysentery by 2020, 2100, 0.0% by 2050, and an 8.0% increase by 2030 in Guangxi, if other factors remain constant. Considering all potential changes include floods, temperature and population size, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery may increase by up to 16.0% by 2020, 20.0% by 2030, 2050, and 0.0% by 2100, compared to that in 2010 under the moderate flood scenario; Under the severe flood scenario, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery may increase by up to 16.0% by 2020, 20.0% by 2030, 2050, and 4.0% by 2100.

Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in three cities in Guangxi. Structured, self-administered questionnaires were used to assess the acceptability of PrEP and the willingness to participate in a clinical trial. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify predictors. Results Among 405 participants, 15.1% had heard of PrEP. If PrEP was deemed to be effective, safe and provided for free, 85.9% reported that they would accept it, and 54.3% of those who accepted PrEP said that they would participate in a clinical trial. The increased acceptability of PrEP was associated with working in male dominated venues, higher income, a poor family relationship, better HIV/AIDS knowledge, not realizing HIV risk from unfamiliar clients, not being forced to use condoms by the gatekeepers, consistent use of condoms, and use of drugs to prevent STD infection. The increased willingness to participate in a clinical trial was associated with a poor family relationship, better HIV/AIDS knowledge, not realizing HIV risk from unfamiliar clients, a willingness to adhere to daily PreP use, and not being concerned about discrimination by others. The main reason for rejecting PrEP or participating in a clinical trial was the concern about the side effects of PrEP. Conclusions Acceptability of PrEP among Guangxi FSWs is relatively high, indicating that PrEP intervention programs may be feasible for Chinese FSWs. Given the fact that most of the participants had never heard of PrEP before, and that family, gatekeepers, and social discrimination could significantly affect its acceptability, a comprehensive mix of multiple interventions is necessary for the successful implementation of a PrEP program among this population in Guangxi.

The results showed that heavy-metal pollution of farmland soil in Du'an County was serious. 74.6% of the soil samples had heavy metals concentrations higher than the Grade II of National Soil Environmental Quality Standard (GB 15618-1995). The over standard rates of Cd, As, Ni, Zn, Cr, Sb, Cu, Pb were 70.6%, 42.9%, 34.9%, 19.8%, 19.6%, 2.94%, 1.59%, 0.79%, respectively. Cd and As were the main contaminants in Du'an County, the pollution was far more serious than those of the national and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In terms of the ecological risk, heavy metals of farmland soil in Du'an County showed a \"middle\" ecological risk, with Cd accounting for 88% of the total ecological risk. The north-west of Jiudu Town and the zone between Bao'an Town and Dongmiao Town were two areas with high ecological risk in Du'an County. The contamination of farmland soils in Du'an County was caused by two main sources, whereas the pollution of As and Sb of farmland soils near Diaojiang River was mainly caused by the upstream mining industry.\n\nNew species and records of Leuctridae (Plecoptera) from Guangxi, China, on the basis of morphological and molecular data, with emphasis on Rhopalopsole.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Weihai; MurÃ¡nyi, DÃ¡vid; Gamboa, Maribet; Yang, Ding; Watanabe, Kozo\n\n2017-03-13\n\nThe species of Leuctridae (Plecoptera) from Guangxi, China are reviewed. Two species of Rhopalopsole are described as new to science, R. cestroidea sp. nov. and R. triangulis sp. nov., belonging to the R. vietnamica group and the R. magnicerca group, respectively. Six species of Leuctridae are now known for Guangxi including two additional species of Rhopalopsole and one Paraleuctra recorded for the first time. The previously unknown female of R. duyuzhoui Sivec & Harper, 2008 is described from specimens from Guangxi. Characters are illustrated for the separation of R. furcospina (Wu, 1973) and R. sinensis Yang & Yang, 1993. Mitochondrial sequences of five Rhopalopsole species support their specific recognition.\n\nBacteria and poisonous plants were the primary causative hazards of foodborne disease outbreak: a seven-year survey from Guangxi, South China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Yongqiang; Huang, Yaling; Yang, Jijun; Liu, Zhanhua; Li, Yanning; Yao, Xueting; Wei, Bo; Tang, Zhenzhu; Chen, Shidong; Liu, Decheng; Hu, Zhen; Liu, Junjun; Meng, Zenghui; Nie, Shaofa; Yang, Xiaobo\n\n2018-04-18\n\nFoodborne diseases are a worldwide public health problem. However, data regarding epidemiological characteristics are still lacking in China. We aimed to analyze the characteristics of foodborne diseases outbreak from 2010 to 2016 in Guangxi, South China. A foodborne disease outbreak is the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar foodborne disease resulting from the ingestion of a common food. All data are obtained from reports in the Public Health Emergency Report and Management Information System of the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, and also from special investigation reports from Guangxi province. A total of 138 foodborne diseases outbreak occurred in Guangxi in the past 7 years, leading to 3348 cases and 46 deaths. Foodborne disease outbreaks mainly occurred in the second and fourth quarters, and schools and private homes were the most common sites. Ingesting toxic food by mistake, improper cooking and cross contamination were the main routes of poisoning which caused 2169 (64.78%) cases and 37 (80.43%) deaths. Bacteria (62 outbreaks, 44.93%) and poisonous plants (46 outbreaks, 33.33%) were the main etiologies of foodborne diseases in our study. In particular, poisonous plants were the main cause of deaths involved in the foodborne disease outbreaks (26 outbreaks, 56.52%). Bacteria and poisonous plants were the primary causative hazard of foodborne diseases. Some specific measures are needed for ongoing prevention and control against the occurrence of foodborne diseases.\n\nBridging the Epidemic: A Comprehensive Analysis of Prevalence and Correlates of HIV, Hepatitis C, and Syphilis, and Infection among Female Sex Workers in Guangxi Province, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Yi; Shen, Zhiyong; Morano, Jamie P.; Khoshnood, Kaveh; Wu, Zunyou; Lan, Guanghua; Zhu, Qiuying; Zhou, Yuejiao; Tang, Shuai; Liu, Wei; Chen, Jie; Tang, Zhenzhu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction Female sex workers (FSWs) are at highest risk for contracting HIV and facilitating the current heterosexual HIV epidemic in Guangxi, China, yet little is known of the impact of recent harm reduction campaigns in the province. We analyzed sentinel surveillance data collected between 2010 and 2012 in Guangxi to explore correlations between the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and syphilis and risk behaviors of different categories of FSWs in Guangxi. Methods The sentinel surveillance data for 5,1790 FSWs in all 14 prefectures and 64 city/county regions of Guangxi, China from 2010 to 2012 were collected. Differences between three categories of FSWs (grouped by venue) and disease trends (HIV, HCV, and syphilis) by year were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses as to evaluate risk factors correlated with HIV, HCV, or syphilis infection. Results HIV and HCV prevalence remained constant across the three FSW categories; however, syphilis prevalence showed a significant increase from 5.7% to 7.3% for low-tier FSWs. Most cases with HIV, HCV, syphilis and intravenous drug use were seen in low-tier FSWs. Testing positive for HIV and syphilis were most correlated with being HCV positive (AOR 4.12 and AOR 4.36), only completing elementary school (AOR 3.71 and AOR 2.35), low tier venues (AOR 2.02 and AOR 2.00), and prior STI (AOR 1.40 and AOR 3.56), respectively. HCV infection was correlated with ever injecting drugs (AOR 60.65) and testing positive for syphilis (AOR 4.16) or HIV (AOR 3.74). Conclusions This study highlights that low tier FSWs with lower formal education levels are the most vulnerable population at risk for acquiring and transmitting HIV, HCV, and syphilis in Guangxi, China. Condom distribution with evolution to safer sex practices are the reasons to explain the non-increasing prevalence of HIV, HCV in Guangxi for 2010â2012.

The work developed an analytical method for determination of these herbicides in environmental waters. This work studied herbicide residues in drinking water in Guangxi, China. The maximum residues and percent of detects were: (0.091Â Âµg/L, 29.2%, atrazine), (0.018Â Âµg/L, 8.3%, ametryne), (0.188Â Âµg/L, 8.3%, aetolaehlor), (0.139Â Âµg/L, 4%, simazine), (0.585Â Âµg/L, 62.5%, atrazine), (0.311Â Âµg/L, 33.3%, acetochlor), (0.341Â Âµg/L, 58.3%, ametryne), (1.312Â Âµg/L, 29.2%, metolachlor), (0.088Â Âµg/L, 4.2%, alachlor), (0.127Â Âµg/L, 14.3%, atrazine), and (0.453Â Âµg/L, 7.1%, metolachlor), respectively. The results demonstrated that agricultural herbicides were detected in all water samples, including tap, surface and groundwater samples. Since the residues are generally below the safe limits established by the government authorities, the monitored 11 herbicides do not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. This work will provide scientific understanding of pesticide residues in drinking water standards in terms of its consistency with precautionary human health and environmental safety.\n\nOne new species of Amphinemura and description of the female of A. ancistroidea Li & Yang (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of southern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nMo, Raorao; Yang, Ding; Wang, Guoquan; Li, Weihai\n\n2017-06-11\n\nA new nemourid species, Amphinemura yao sp. nov. is described from the Daoyao Mountains of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of southern China.

This study aimed to estimate the timely vaccination coverage, the timely-and-complete vaccination coverage, and the median delay period for MCV among children aged 18-54 months in rural Guangxi. Based on quartiles of measles incidence during 2011-2013, a stratified three-stage cluster survey was conducted from June through August 2015. Using weighted estimation and finite population correction, vaccination coverage and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Weighted Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate the median delay periods for the first (MCV1) and second (MCV2) doses of the vaccine. A total of 1216 children were surveyed. The timely vaccination coverage rate was 58.4% (95% CI, 54.9%-62.0%) for MCV1, and 76.9% (95% CI, 73.6%-80.0%) for MCV2. The timely-and-complete vaccination coverage rate was 47.4% (95% CI, 44.0%-51.0%). The median delay period was 32 (95% CI, 27-38) days for MCV1, and 159 (95% CI, 118-195) days for MCV2. The timeliness and completeness of measles vaccination was low, and the median delay period was long among children in rural Guangxi. Incorporating the timeliness and completeness into official routine vaccination coverage statistics may help appraise the coverage of vaccination in China. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

The Guangxi Region of China possesses several native chicken breeds displaying a broad range of phenotypes well adapted to the extreme hot-and-wet environments in the region. We thus evaluated the genetic diversity and relationships among six native chicken populations of the Guangxi region and also evaluated two commercial breeds (Arbor Acres and Roman chickens). We analyzed the sequences of the D-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 18 microsatellite loci of 280 blood samples from six Guangxi native chicken breeds and from Arbor Acres and Roman chickens, and used the neighbor-joining method to construct the phylogenetic tree of these eight breeds. Our results showed that the genetic diversity of Guangxi native breeds was relatively rich. The phylogenetic tree using the unweighed pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGAM) on microsatellite marks revealed two main clusters. Arbor Acres chicken and Roman chicken were in one cluster, while the Guangxi breeds were in the other cluster. Moreover, the UPGAM tree of Guangxi native breeds based on microsatellite loci was more consistent with the genesis, breeding history, differentiation and location than the mtDNA D-loop region. STRUCTURE analysis further confirmed the genetic structure of Guangxi native breeds in the Neighbor-Net dendrogram. The nomenclature of mtDNA sequence polymorphisms suggests that the Guangxi native chickens are distributed across four clades, but most of them are clustered in two main clades (B and E), with the other haplotypes within the clades A and C. The Guangxi native breeds revealed abundant genetic diversity not only on microsatellite loci but also on mtDNA D-loop region, and contained multiple maternal lineages, including one from China and another from Europe or the Middle East.\n\nEradication of schistosomiasis in Guangxi, China. Part 2: Political economy, management strategy and costs, 1953-92.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSleigh, A.; Jackson, S.; Li, X.; Huang, K.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nReported are the results of a study of the political economy, management, and costs of the successful Guangxi schistosomiasis eradication programme, spanning 40 years from 1953 to 1992. For this purpose we analysed all government data and memoranda on the policy, management, technical support, finance, and the control strategy of the programme. We also interviewed many local staff involved in the programme over the 40-year period and obtained cost data from annual county-level records on seven major categories of variable costs. Schistosomiasis control in Guangxi began with one of the first examples of community participation and rapid assessment in public health history--the use of pre-franked envelopes to return disease questionnaires and suspect snails from rural areas. This approach quickly and accurately delineated the endemic area. This was Mao Zedong's \"mass line\", incorporating ideas and knowledge from peasants directly into services run for and by them, here the schistosomiasis control programme. Recognition by China's leaders that schistosomiasis was a great economic burden, steadfast prioritizing of the programme over 40 years, local innovative scientific study, agricultural and environmental focus on eradicating the snail hosts and boosting rural production, and mass community education and support were all key factors in the final success. Local leaders motivated programme staff and everyone involved knew the objectives. The programme was always multisectoral, with policy developed centrally, and strategy and collaboration encouraged and rewarded at the grass-roots. These features explain how a very poor autonomous region such as Guangxi finally eradicated schistosomiasis, spending less than US$ 0.50 per protected citizen per year; it is remarkable that the disease and snails were initially found across a large area of complex environments and modern drugs such as praziquantel were not available for most of the 40-year period. The lessons from Guangxi\n\nA multilevel analysis of gatekeeper characteristics and consistent condom use among establishment-based female sex workers in Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Qing; Li, Xiaoming; Stanton, Bonita; Fang, Xiaoyi; Zhao, Ran\n\n2010-11-01\n\nMultilevel analytical techniques are being applied in condom use research to ensure the validity of investigation on environmental/structural influences and clustered data from venue-based sampling. The literature contains reports of consistent associations between perceived gatekeeper support and condom use among entertainment establishment-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Guangxi, China. However, the clustering inherent in the data (FSWs being clustered within establishment) has not been accounted in most of the analyses. We used multilevel analyses to examine perceived features of gatekeepers and individual correlates of consistent condom use among FSWs and to validate the findings in the existing literature. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 318 FSWs from 29 entertainment establishments in Guangxi, China in 2004, with a minimum of 5 FSWs per establishment. The Hierarchical Linear Models program with Laplace estimation was used to estimate the parameters in models containing random effects and binary outcomes. About 11.6% of women reported consistent condom use with clients. The intraclass correlation coefficient indicated 18.5% of the variance in condom use could be attributed to their similarity between FSWs within the same establishments. Women's perceived gatekeeper support and education remained positively associated with condom use (P < 0.05), after controlling for other individual characteristics and clustering. After adjusting for data clustering, perceived gatekeeper support remains associated with consistent condom use with clients among FSWs in China. The results imply that combined interventions to intervene both gatekeepers and individual FSW may effectively promote consistent condom use.\n\nLow Virologic Failure and Drug Resistance among HIV-Infected Patients Receiving Hospital-Based ART While Care and Outreach through Community in Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiang, Shujia; Shen, Zhiyong; Yan, Jing; Liang, Fuxiong; Tang, Zhenzhu; Liu, Wei; Kan, Wei; Liao, Lingjie; Leng, Xuebing; Ruan, Yuhua; Xing, Hui; Shao, Yiming\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo investigate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virologic suppression and drug resistance among HIV-infected patients receiving first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) in hospitals while community care and outreach through local health workers in Guangxi, China. This was a series of cross-sectional surveys from 2004 to 2012 in Guangxi, supported by the Chinese National HIVDR Surveillance and Monitoring Network Working Group. Guangxi, China. Demographic, ART, and laboratory data (CD4(+) cell count, viral load, and drug resistance) were analyzed. Factors associated with virologic suppression were identified by logistic regression analysis. A total of 780 patients were included in this study. The median treatment duration was 20.6âmonths (IQR 6.6-35.9). Of 780 study participants, 95.4% of patients (744/780) had HIV virologic suppression. Among these, of the 143 patients who were infected through drug injection, only 10 (7.0%) experienced virologic failure, and the overall prevalence of HIV drug resistance was 2.8% (22/789). Factors associated with virologic suppression in the final multivariate models included self-reported missing doses in the past month (compared to not missing doses in the past month, AORâ=â0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6) and initial ART regimen without 3TC (compared to initial ART regimen with 3TC, AORâ=â0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.4). Moreover, the trend chi-square test showed that the proportion of virologic suppression increased over time from 2004 to 2012 (Pâ=â0.002). This study first demonstrated that HIV patients infected through various transmission routes can achieve an excellent treatment outcome in hospitals at or above the county level for free first-line ART in Guangxi. It is an important of ART education and adherence to intervention for achieving better treatment outcomes.\n\nHealth and human rights concerns of drug users in detention in Guangxi Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nCohen, J Elizabeth; Amon, Joseph J\n\n2008-12-09\n\nAlthough confinement in drug detoxification (\"detox\") and re-education through labor (RTL) centers is the most common form of treatment for drug dependence in China, little has been published about the experience of drug users in such settings. We conducted an assessment of the impact of detention on drug users' access to HIV prevention and treatment services and consequent threats to fundamental human rights protections. Chinese government HIV and anti-narcotics legislation and policy documents were reviewed, and in-depth and key informant interviews were conducted with 19 injection drug users (IDUs) and 20 government and nongovernmental organization officials in Nanning and Baise, Guangxi Province. Significant contradictions were found in HIV and antinarcotics policies, exemplified by the simultaneous expansion of community-based methadone maintenance therapy and the increasing number of drug users detained in detox and RTL center facilities. IDU study participants reported, on average, having used drugs for 14 y (range 8-23 y) and had been confined to detox four times (range one to eight times) and to RTL centers once (range zero to three times). IDUs expressed an intense fear of being recognized by the police and being detained, regardless of current drug use. Key informants and IDUs reported that routine HIV testing, without consent and without disclosure of the result, was the standard policy of detox and RTL center facilities, and that HIV-infected detainees were not routinely provided medical or drug dependency treatment, including antiretroviral therapy. IDUs received little or no information or means of HIV prevention, but reported numerous risk behaviors for HIV transmission while detained. Legal and policy review, and interviews with recently detained IDUs and key informants in Guangxi Province, China, found evidence of anti-narcotics policies and practices that appear to violate human rights and imperil drug users' health.\n\nHealth and Human Rights Concerns of Drug Users in Detention in Guangxi Province, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCohen, J.

A cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted in three labour camps in Guangxi, China. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic characteristics; sexually transmissible infections (STIs); drug use; psychological distress (K-10); and health service usage and access inside the labour camps. K-10 scores were categorised as â¤30 (low to moderate distress) andâ >30 or more (highly distressed). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models identified factors independently associated with high K-10 scores for men and women separately. In total, 755 detainees, 576 (76%) men and 179 (24%) women, participated in the health survey. The study found 11.6% men versus 11.2% women detainees experienced high psychological distress, but no significant gender differences were observed (p>â0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that multiple physical health problems were significantly associated with high psychological distress among men. Drug treatment and forensic mental health services need to be established in detention centres in China to treat more than 10% of detainees with drug use and mental health disorders.\n\nEquity in health financing of Guangxi after China's universal health coverage: evidence based on health expenditure comparison in rural Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region from 2009 to 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nQin, Xianjing; Luo, Hongye; Feng, Jun; Li, Yanning; Wei, Bo; Feng, Qiming\n\n2017-09-29\n\nHealthcare financing should be equitable. Fairness in financial contribution and protection against financial risk is based on the notion that every household should pay a fair share. Health policy makers have long been concerned with protecting people from the possibility that ill health will lead to catastrophic financial payments and subsequent impoverishment. A number of studies on health care financing equity have been conducted in some provinces of China, but in Guangxi, we found such observation is not enough. What is the situation in Guagnxi? A research on rural areas of Guangxi can add knowledge in this field and help improve the equity and efficiency of health financing, particularly in low-income citizens in rural countries, is a major concern in China's medical sector reform. Socio-economic characteristics and healthcare payment data were obtained from two rounds of household surveys conducted in 2009 (4634 respondents) and 2013 (3951 respondents). The contributions of funding sources were determined and a progressivity analysis of government healthcare subsidies was performed. Household consumption expenditure and total healthcare payments were calculated and incidence and intensity of catastrophic health payments were measured. Summary indices (concentration index, Kakwani index and Gini coefficient) were obtained for the sources of healthcare financing: indirect taxes, out of pocket payments, and social insurance contributions. The overall health-care financing system was regressive. In 2013, the Kakwani index was 0.0013, the vertical effect of all the three funding sources was 0.0001, and some values exceeded 100%, indicating that vertical inequity had a large influence on causing total health financing inequity. The headcount of catastrophic health payment declined sharply between 2009 and 2013, using total expenditure (from 7.3% to 1.2%) or non-food expenditure (from 26.1% to 7.5%) as the indicator of household capacity to pay.

The prevalence of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in HIV-infected patients in China is unknown. To estimate the prevalence of M. tuberculosis and NTM in HIV-infected patients in Guangxi Province, determine their drug resistance profiles, and evaluate the genotype patterns of M. tuberculosis strains. Samples were collected from two HIV designated hospitals in Guangxi Province between 2005 and 2008. HIV-infected patients who were culture-positive for mycobacteria were included. Drug susceptibility testing was performed for mycobacterial isolates. NTM species was identified by sequencing, and M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped using the variable number of tandem repeats method. M. tuberculosis and NTM were identified in respectively 117 (53%) and 102 (47%) HIV-infected patients. Drug resistance was found in 27% and multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 11% of the patients with TB. Previous treatment for TB was significantly associated with MDR-TB. Twenty (17%) TB patients belonged to eight VNTR-defined clusters. The high frequency of NTM among HIV-infected patients raises concerns about accurate species identification before the determination of appropriate treatment. The potential for TB transmission exists among HIV-infected patients. Intensified screening and effective treatment of TB-HIV co-infected patients is urgently needed.\n\nA Multilevel Analysis of Gatekeeper Characteristics and Consistent Condom Use Among Establishment-Based Female Sex Workers in Guangxi, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Qing; Li, Xiaoming; Stanton, Bonita; Fang, Xiaoyi; Zhao, Ran\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Multilevel analytical techniques are being applied in condom use research to ensure the validity of investigation on environmental/structural influences and clustered data from venue-based sampling.

Evidence from Guangxi Province\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhuang, Jincai\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneursâeconomic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilitiesâon attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (Î² = 0.50, p<0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (Î² = 0.69, p<0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.

In order to compare the results of forecasting, the data obtained from 2004 to 2013 and 2014 were used as modeling and forecasting samples, respectively. The results show that when the small data set of hepatitis has seasonal fluctuation, the prediction result by BPNN-GA will be better than the two other methods. The WNN method is suitable for predicting the large data set of hepatitis that has seasonal fluctuation and the same for the GRNN method when the data increases steadily.\n\nSocio-economic factors of bacillary dysentery based on spatial correlation analysis in Guangxi Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nNie, Chengjing; Li, Hairong; Yang, Linsheng; Zhong, Gemei; Zhang, Lan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn the past decade, bacillary dysentery was still a big public health problem in China, especially in Guangxi Province, where thousands of severe diarrhea cases occur every year. Reported bacillary dysentery cases in Guangxi Province were obtained from local Centers for Diseases Prevention and Control. The 14 socio-economic indexes were selected as potential explanatory variables for the study. The spatial correlation analysis was used to explore the associations between the selected factors and bacillary dysentery incidence at county level, which was based on the software of ArcGIS10.2 and GeoDA 0.9.5i. The proportion of primary industry, the proportion of younger than 5-year-old children in total population, the number of hospitals per thousand persons and the rates of bacillary dysentery incidence show statistically significant positive correlation. But the proportion of secondary industry, per capital GDP, per capital government revenue, rural population proportion, popularization rate of tap water in rural area, access rate to the sanitation toilets in rural, number of beds in hospitals per thousand persons, medical and technical personnel per thousand persons and the rate of bacillary dysentery incidence show statistically significant negative correlation. The socio-economic factors can be divided into four aspects, including economic development, health development, medical development and human own condition. The four aspects were not isolated from each other, but interacted with each other.\n\nStudy on molecular epidemiology of the alpha-thalassemias in Liuzhou City, Guangxi Autonomous Region, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nCai, Ren; Liu, Jingzhong; Wang, Lirong; Liang, Xin; Xiao, Bai; Su, Liu; Zhou, Yan; Pan, Lizhen\n\n2004-01-01\n\nGuangxi is one of the provinces of Southern China with the highest incidence of alpha-thalassemia (thal). Liuzhou is the second biggest city in Guangxi. To find out the incidence of the various alpha-thal genotypes, and their distribution in the Liuzhou area, an F820 Blood Cell Analysis System was used to measure the parameters of red blood cells. A SPIFE Rapid Auto-Electrophoresis System was used to analyze the normal and abnormal hemoglobins (Hbs). Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) was used to detect the alpha-globin genotypes. Thirty-two (2.05%) out of 7805 young couples undergoing pre-marriage counseling, were diagnosed as having an Hb H (beta4) disease. The study of 1228 cord blood samples revealed 138 newborn children carrying an alpha-thal determinant with nine different genotypes, thus making the total incidence of alpha-thal 11.24%. Among 185 cases of Hb H, 119 (64.1%) were confirmed as being deletional, and 66 cases (35.7%) nondeletional types. The severity of the Hb H diseases could be classified in the following order: alphaCSalpha/--SEA (alphaConstant (Spring)alpha/--Southeast Asia); alpha(-4.2)/--SEA; alpha(-3.7)/--SEA. Ten cases of alpha-thal determinants were found in combination with beta-thal. The mPCR technique can detect all kinds of combinations of the three common large deletions (--SEA, alpha(-4.2) and alpha(-3.7)) accurately and conveniently.\n\nSocio-Economic Factors of Bacillary Dysentery Based on Spatial Correlation Analysis in Guangxi Province, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNie, Chengjing; Li, Hairong; Yang, Linsheng; Zhong, Gemei; Zhang, Lan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground In the past decade, bacillary dysentery was still a big public health problem in China, especially in Guangxi Province, where thousands of severe diarrhea cases occur every year.

Minorities may suffer from psychological problems during treatments for NPC. This study aimed to implement an intervention to promote self-efficacy of minority patients (Zhuang tribe, Guangxi, China) with NPC to improve their quality of life (QOL). Material/Methods This was a prospective study of 120 patients with NPC treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (Guangxi, China), randomized to conventional care (n=60, controls) or conventional care plus self-efficacy interventions based on health education, behavior therapy, and psychological intervention (n=60, self-efficacy group). Self-efficacy was evaluated using the general self-efficacy scale, and QOL using the EORTC QLQ-C30. The questionnaires were completed at discharge, at 6 months, and at 1 and 2 years. The primary outcome was QOL. Results There was no difference in QOL at baseline. From study start to hospital discharge, overall QOL scores decreased in both groups, but this decrease was more important in the control group (controls: â39.31 vs. self-efficacy: â27.04, P<0.05). After discharge, each functional field QOL scores and overall QOL increased with time in the 2 groups, and they were significantly higher in the self-efficacy group. Conclusions This intervention promoting self-efficacy could increase patientsâ own potential and initiative, enhance their confidence and ability to solve health problems, improve their coping with adverse effects of treatments, and have positive effects on their QOL. Self-efficacy theory-based interventions could be worth popularization during the treatment and recovery of minority patients with NPC.

A total of 130, 635 neonates were screened from the year of 2013 to 2017. Neonates suspected for G6PD deficiency were further analyzed by quantitatively enzymatic assay and G6PD mutation analysis. The overall incidence of G6PD deficiency was 7.28%. A total of 14 G6PD mutations were identified, and different mutations lead to varying levels of G6PD enzymatic activities. The best cut-off value of G6PD activity in male subjects is 2.2âU/g Hb, same as conventional setting. In female population, however, the cut-off value is found to be 2.8âU/g Hb (sensitivity: 97.5%, specificity: 87.7%, AUC: 0.964) to best discriminate between normal and heterozygotes, and 1.6âU/g Hb (sensitivity: 82.2%, specificity: 85.9%, AUC: 0.871) between heterozygotes and deficient subjects. In conclusion, we have conducted a comprehensive newborn screening of G6PD deficiency in a large cohort of population from Guangxi, China, and first established a reliable cut-off value of G6PD activity to distinguish heterozygous females from either normal or deficient subjects.\n\nUrbanization Process Monitoring in Northwest China based on DMSP/OLS Nighttime Light Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, K.; Bai, L. Y.; Feng, J. Z.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIn recent years, the DMSP/OLS nighttime light data have been widely applied to various fields such as monitoring and evaluation of urbanization, estimation of social economy, economical environment and health effects, hazards analysis, and fisheries research. The general urbanized level in China has rapidly developed since the 1990s, and the cities in northwest China, which were important population centres of the ancient silk road, have also been developed in a high speed thanks to Chinaâs national strategy of Western Development. Given the Xinjiang autonomous region as a core area of One Belt and One Road, it is very necessary to study the urbanization processes and changes of its urban system and the whole northwest region of China. In this paper, we extracted built-up areas of the cities in northwest China in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012, evaluated urban expansion and spatial pattern through appropriate indexes, and also quantitatively analyzed the urbanized level of each city. The results showed that the cities in northwest China generally presented high strong and rapid expansion, but there were some large differences among cities. Urban expansion forms alternate with exterior expansion and interior filling, in general, the cities externally expandedafter 2002 and internally filledbefore 2002, meanwhile, there were a high positive correlation between urban built-up areas and population growth in Xinjiang autonomous.\n\nAssessment of metals pollution on agricultural soil surrounding a lead-zinc mining area in the Karst region of Guangxi, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Chaolan; Li, Zhongyi; Yang, Weiwei; Pan, Liping; Gu, Minghua; Lee, DoKyoung\n\n2013-06-01\n\nSoil samples were collected on farmland in a lead-zinc mining area in the Karst region of Guangxi, China. The contamination of the soil by eight metals (Cd, Hg, As, Cu, Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni) was determined. Among all these metals, Cd is the most serious pollutant in this area. Zn, Hg as well asPb can also be measured at high levels, which may affect the crop production. All other metals contributed marginally to the overall soil contamination. Besides the evaluation of single metals, the Nemerow synthetic index indicated that the soil is not suitable for agricultural use.\n\n[Analysis of characteristics of acute poisoning caused by various poisons in Guangxi, China].\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, De-hong; Zhang, Zhen-ming; Liu, Qing-hua; Jiang, Dong-fang\n\n2013-11-01\n\nTo investigate the characteristics of acute poisonings caused by various poisons in Guangxi, China. A retrospective investigation was performed in 5859 cases of acute poisonings who were admitted to 63 hospitals in 11 cities, as well as 531 types of poisons involved. The poisons were categorized into 6 groups; each group of cases was stratified by the rural or urban settings, frequency of poisoning, and cause of poisoning to analyze the numbers of cases and constituent ratios. Most types of poisons (68.74%) belonged to drugs (217 types) and pesticides (148 types). Most cases of poisonings (61.63%) were caused by pesticides (n = 2547) and chemicals (n = 1064). Pesticides, poisons of plant origins, and poisons of animal origins were responsible for most of the cases in rural settings; 88.46%, 79.10%, and 66.74% of the cases of these poison categories happened in rural settings. Chemicals, drugs, and other poisons were responsible for most of the cases in urban settings; 70.20%, 61.74%, and 63.73% of the cases of these poison categories happened in urban settings. The numbers of cases in 5-year-poisoning groups were the highest in all categories of poisons, accounting for 85.24%, 88.57%, 55.16%, 70.79%, 68.36%, and 66.44%of cases of respective categories. Most cases of poisonings by chemicals, poisons of animal origin, and other poisons were accident-related (86.24%, 72.66%, and 46.71%of the poison categories). Most cases of poisonings by pesticides and drugs were suicide-related (59.39% and 33.52% of the poison categories). Most cases by poisons of plant origin were caused by accidental ingestion (70.36% of the poison category). Most of the acute poisonings in Guangxi area are caused by pesticides and chemicals; the most common causes of poisoning are accidents, accidental ingestion, and suicide. There are significant differences in the causes of acute poisonings between the urban and rural settings.\n\nSpatial, temporal and spatio-temporal clusters of measles incidence at the county level in Guangxi, China during 2004-2014: flexibly shaped scan statistics.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Xianyan; Geater, Alan; McNeil, Edward; Deng, Qiuyun; Dong, Aihu; Zhong, Ge\n\n2017-04-04\n\nOutbreaks of measles re-emerged in Guangxi province during 2013-2014, where measles again became a major public health concern. A better understanding of the patterns of measles cases would help in identifying high-risk areas and periods for optimizing preventive strategies, yet these patterns remain largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to determine the patterns of measles clusters in space, time and space-time at the county level over the period 2004-2014 in Guangxi. Annual data on measles cases and population sizes for each county were obtained from Guangxi CDC and Guangxi Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Epidemic curves and Kulldorff's temporal scan statistics were used to identify seasonal peaks and high-risk periods. Tango's flexible scan statistics were implemented to determine irregular spatial clusters. Spatio-temporal clusters in elliptical cylinder shapes were detected by Kulldorff's scan statistics. Population attributable risk percent (PAR%) of children aged â¤24Â months was used to identify regions with a heavy burden of measles. Seasonal peaks occurred between April and June, and a temporal measles cluster was detected in 2014. Spatial clusters were identified in West, Southwest and North Central Guangxi. Three phases of spatio-temporal clusters with high relative risk were detected: Central Guangxi during 2004-2005, Midwest Guangxi in 2007, and West and Southwest Guangxi during 2013-2014. Regions with high PAR% were mainly clustered in West, Southwest, North and Central Guangxi. A temporal uptrend of measles incidence existed in Guangxi between 2010 and 2014, while downtrend during 2004-2009. The hotspots shifted from Central to West and Southwest Guangxi, regions overburdened with measles. Thus, intensifying surveillance of timeliness and completeness of routine vaccination and implementing supplementary immunization activities for measles should prioritized in these regions.\n\nResearch on plant utilization and adaptation to environment of human in Guangxi of Southern China during the latest 30000 years\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Y.; Xie, G.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIt is an important scientific problem in the study of the relationship between man and land to select the key areas and important periods of human evolution. In the latest 30 thousand years, it is an important period for late Pleistocene climate change, which has a profound impact on human evolution. Southern China including Guangxi has a unique geographical landscape pattern and unique vegetation and climate background, which is not only an important channel for the diffusion and migration of ancient humans but also an ideal refuge to avoid climate changes. It preserved the rich archaeological remains of the evolution and development of human beings, and provided a rare place for the adaptive strategies of human survival and early the environment. In this paper, Yahuai cave site in Guangxi will be selected for investigation. We will analyze the continuous accumulation of ancient human remains, and utilized AMS14C to reconstruct the dating framework. We will also extract the plant information and environment of the site through pollen, phytolith, grain and starch grains. We will further explore the succession mode of utilization of plant resources and its relationship with climate change and reveal the adaptability to the environment and strategy.\n\nA new species of Meliolinites associated with Buxus leaves from the Oligocene of Guangxi, southern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Fu-Jun; Sun, Bai-Nian; Wang, Qiu-Jun; Dong, Jun-Ling; Yang, Guo-Lin; Yang, Yi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA new species of Meliolinites (fossil Meliolaceae), M. buxi sp. nov., is reported from the Oligocene Ningming Formation of Guangxi, South China. The fungus has hyphopodia characteristics of extant Meliolaceae, such as thick-walled, branching hyphae with appressoria and phialides. However, these fossils entirely lack mycelial or perithecial setae and have only a few phialides, thereby distinguishing the new species from most known species. The fungus was discovered on the adaxial and abaxial cuticles of several fossilized Buxus leaves. Thickening and twisting of cell walls in the Buxus leaf cuticle, along with the parasitic feeding strategy of the extant Meliolaceae, suggest that a parasitic interaction between Buxus and M. buxi seems feasible. The distribution of modern Meliolaceae suggests that they live in warm, humid subtropical-tropical climates. It is possible that the presence of M. buxi indicates a similar climatic condition. The co-occurrence of large-leaf Buxus and floristic comparisons of the Ningming assemblage also corroborate this conclusion.

Inexpensive aphrodisiacs are available for purchase in suburban and rural areas. This study aims to investigate the association between aphrodisiac use and increased HIV risk for middle-aged and elderly men in Guangxi. Methods A matched case-control study of aphrodisiac use-associated HIV infection was performed among male subjects over 50 years old who were clients of low-cost commercial sex venues in Guangxi. The cases were defined as clients who were HIV-positive and two controls were selected for each case. The cases and the controls were matched on the visited sex venue, age (Â±3 years), number of years of purchasing sex (Â±3 years), and educational attainment. Subjects were interviewed and tested for HIV. Paired t-test or McNemar Chi-squared test were used to compare the characteristics between the cases and controls. A stepwise conditional logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with HIV infection. Findings This study enrolled 103 cases and 206 controls. Aphrodisiac use (Pâ=â0.02, odds ratio (OR)â=â1.81, 95% CIâ=â1.08â3.04), never using condom during commercial sex encounter (Pâ=â0.03, odds ratio (OR)â=â1.82, 95% CIâ=â1.08â3.07), and lacking a stable partner (Pâ=â0.03, odds ratio (OR)â=â1.76, 95% CIâ=â1.05â2.98) were found to be risk factors for HIV infection among the study groups. For subjects reporting aphrodisiac use, the frequency of purchasing sex was positively correlated with the frequency of aphrodisiac use (râ=â0.3; pâ=â0.02). Conclusions Aphrodisiac use was significantly associated with increased HIV infection risk in men over 50 years old who purchased commercial sex in the suburban and rural areas of Guangxi. Further research and interventions should address the links between aphrodisiac use, commercial sex work, condom use, and increased HIV transmission.

This paper presents a measurement campaign for the GSM band EMF exposure in the vicinity of 827 base station sites (totally 6207 measurement points) in Guangxi, China. Measurement specifications are designed for risk communication with the residents who previously complained of over-exposure. The EMF power densities with the global positioning system coordinate at each measured point were recorded. Compliance with the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines and Chinese environmental EMF safety standards was studied. The results show that the GSM band EMF level near the base stations is very low. The measurement results and the EMF risk communication procedures positively influence public perception of the RF EMF exposure from the base stations and promote the exchange of EMF exposure-related knowledge.\n\nRisk of syphilis in STI clinic patients: a crossâsectional study of 11â 500 cases in Guangxi, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWong, Susan P Y; Yin, YueâPing; Gao, Xing; Wei, WanâHui; Shi, MeiâQin; Huang, PeiâYong; Wang, Hong; Chen, Qiang; Liu, MuSang; Tucker, Joseph D; Chen, XiangâSheng; Cohen, Myron S\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObjective To measure prevalence of syphilis among the STI clinic population in Guangxi, China, and to assess the socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics associated with the infection. Methods We undertook a crossâsectional survey and syphilis and HIV serologic testing among 11â 473 patients attending 14 community and hospitalâbased dermatovenereal clinics across eight cities in Guangxi between December 2004 and February 2006. Results 1297 (11.9%) patients demonstrated positive toludine red unheated serum test and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination results with serologic testing. A total of 58% (752) of seropositive subjects presented with a genital ulcer, palmar/plantar rash or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Female sex (ORâ=â2.23, 95% confidence intervals (CI)â=â1.69 to 3.00, p<0.001), less education (middle school, ORâ=â1.70, 95% CIâ=â1.11 to 2.62, pâ=â0.023; primary school or less, ORâ=â1.98, 95% CIâ=â1.13 to 3.46, pâ=â0.017) and high annual income (ORâ=â1.91, 95% CIâ=â1.18 to 3.10, pâ=â0.009 for >30â 000 RMB yuan) were associated with serologically positive status. Syphilis infection was significantly more prevalent in city 2 (19.5%, ORâ=â3.07, 95% CIâ=â1.83 to 5.16, p<0.001), city 4 (16.6%, ORâ=â1.90, 95% CIâ=â1.10 to 3.28, pâ=â0.011) and city 8 (13.8%, ORâ=â1.83, 95% CIâ=â1.13 to 2.97, pâ=â0.006). A total of 40.1% (532) of infected subjects engaged in commercial sex and increased rates of the infection was associated with multiple sexual partners (ORâ=â1.54, 95% CIâ=â1.16 to 2.06, pâ=â0.003).

The study was performed in 36 lesions from 34 BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancer patients. A total of 422 lesions from 422 breast cancer patients without BRCA1 mutations served as control group. The comparison of the ultrasonographic features and BI-RADS-US classification between two the groups were reviewed. More complex inner echo was disclosed in BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancer patients (x(2) = 4.741, P = 0.029). The BI-RADS classification of BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancer was lower (U = 6094.0, P = 0.022). BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancer frequently displays as microlobulated margin and complex echo. It also shows more benign characteristics in morphology, and the BI-RADS classification is prone to be underestimated.\n\nGenesis of the Permian karstic Pingguo bauxite deposit, western Guangxi, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Xuefei; Wang, Qingfei; Zhang, Qizuan; Yang, Shujuan; Liang, Yayun; Zhang, Ying; Li, Yan; Guan, Tao\n\n2017-10-01\n\nMore than 0.5 billion tons of late Permian bauxite overlies the karstic topography of the Maokou Formation of western Guangxi in China. Here, we provide new mineralogical, geochemical, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic, and pyrite S isotope and trace element compositional data for the Pingguo bauxite deposit, aiming to further our understanding of the genesis of Permian bauxite. The Pingguo bauxite contains three distinct layers: a lower layer dominated by ferric clay or weathered iron ore, a middle layer of cryptocrystalline and oolitic bauxite ore, and an upper layer dominated by argillaceous bauxite. The bauxite ore is mainly diaspore, pyrite, chamosite, and anatase, whereas the argillaceous bauxite contains diaspore, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, pyrite, and anatase. Two types of pyrite have been identified within the bauxite: fine-grained and framboidal pyrite (Py1) occurring in aggregates and coarse-grained and euhedral pyrite (Py2). Py1 is enriched in trace elements and is thought to have a diagenetic origin, whereas Py2 is deficient in trace elements and is considered to have formed by later recrystallization. The S isotopic composition of pyrite (-34.11 to -18.91â°) and visible ovoid microorganisms within the bauxite provide evidences of microbial activity during bauxite formation. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition of the bauxite indicates that these ores were generated by the weathering of basalts belonging to the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (LIP) and limestones of the Maokou Formation. Microorganisms were likely to have enhanced the dissolution and weathering of the parent rock and facilitated the precipitation of diaspore under near-surface conditions.\n\nAssessment of potential factors associating with costs of hospitalizing cardiovascular diseases in 141 hospitals in Guangxi, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Li-fang; Zhang, Mao-xin; Kong, Ling-qian; Liu, Jun-jun; Feng, Qi-ming; Lu, Wei; Wei, Bo; Zhao, Lue Ping\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground The rising cost of healthcare is of great concern in China, as evidenced by the media features negative reports almost daily. However there are only a few studies from well-developed cities, like Beijing or Shanghai, and little is known about healthcare costs in rest of the country. In this study, we use hospitalization summary reports (HSRs) from admitted cardiovascular diseases patients in Guangxi hospitals during 2013â2016, and we investigate temporal trends of healthcare costs and associated factors. Methods By generalized additive model, we compute temporal trends of cost per stay (CPS), cost per day (CPD) and others. We then use generalized linear models to assess which factors associate with CPS and CPD. Findings Using a total of 760,000 HSRs, we find that CPS appears to be stabilized around $1040 until the middle of year 2015, before exhibiting a downward trend. Similarly, CPD exhibits similar stable pattern. Meanwhile, surgery-specific CPS showed an increase in year 2013â2014, and then stabilized. Drug costs account for over 1/3 of CPS, but they are gradually declining. Costs associated with physiciansâ and nursesâ services represent less than 5% of CPS. We found that age, sex, marital status, occupation and payment methods are significantly associated with CPS or CPD. Interestingly, we found no association between patient ethnicity and these costs. However, we did find that minority patients use more secondary hospitals than Han patients. Interpretations Healthcare costs in Guangxi are stable, contrary to the rise portrayed by Chinese mass media. Several factors can be associated with healthcare costs, and these may be useful for developing evidence-based policies. In particular, there is a need to encourage more Han patients to seek care in primary and secondary hospitals.

We examined five consecutive years of HIV and syphilis prevalence and risk factors data among MSM in Guangxi Province with the second highest estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) in China in 2011. Methods We collected demographic and behavioral data from national sentinel surveillance and HIV/syphilis blood samples in five annual cross-sectional surveys from 2008 to 2012. We analyzed HIV and syphilis prevalence trends stratified by social/behavioral characteristics. Results HIV prevalence climbed steadily from 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 3.0) in 2008 to 3.7% (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.0) in 2012. Syphilis prevalence increased steadily from 5.1% (95% CI: 4.0 to 6.0) in 2008 to 8.4% (95% CI: 7.0 to 10.0) in 2012. HIV prevalence rose notably among MSM who were â¤25âyears of age, never married, did not engage in sexual intercourse with women in the past six months, and had not been tested for HIV in the past year. Syphilis prevalence rose notably among MSM who were >25âyears of age, ever married or living with a partner, and engaged in sexual intercourse with women in the past six months. HIV prevalence was much higher in MSM with current syphilis than without. Finally, current syphilis was the most significant predictor of HIV infection, and age was the most significant predictor of syphilis infection. Conclusions HIV and the syphilis prevalence expansion among MSM suggest an urgent public health prevention challenge for Guangxi provincial health officials. Risk factors for each infection differed such that all MSM, each of whom might be at risk of HIV, syphilis or both, should be targets for heavy intervention.

From March, 2006 to June, 2007 and from October, 2010 to May, 2011, infra-red camera traps were installed along animal trails and temporary rain pools in Nonggang National Nature Reserve, Guangxi, China, to monitor mammal diversity and relative abundance. In total, 19 species from 17 genera, 12 families, and 5 orders were recorded, including two State Key Protection Class I species, the FranÃ§ois' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi) and Assam macaque (Macaca assamensis). Although 42% of species only occurred in one of the microhabitats, differences in species assemblages between trails and pools were not significant. The results of our observation indicated that camera trapping was effective in monitoring medium to large sized mammals, and for recording illegal hunting. In addition, our results suggest that authorities should reinforce patrolling, especially at water pools during the dry season, and eradicate unsustainable extraction of underground water. Moreover, based on the advantages of large inhibited environments to animal species, especially to large predators, we also recommend connecting the three isolated sections of the reserve to promote species recovery and dispersal.\n\nHIV testing in re-education through labour camps in Guangxi Autonomous Region, China (a cross-sectional survey)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYap, Lorraine; Reekie, Joanne; Liu, Wei; Chen, Yi; Wu, Zunyou; Li, Jianghong; Zhang, Lei; Wand, Handan; Donovan, Basil; Butler, Tony\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective HIV testing is mandatory in re-education-through-labour camps (laojiaosuo) in China yet no studies have reported on the process. Methods The survey response rate was 100% although 29 detainees were excluded because they were under 18 years of age. A cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted in three labour camps in Guangxi, located in the south-western region of China. Results Of the 755 detainees surveyed, 725 (96%) reported having a blood test in the labour camps of whom 493 (68%) thought this included an HIV test. 61 detainees self-reported they were HIV infected, their status confirmed by medical records, if available. Of these, 53 (87%) recalled receiving post-test HIV education, and 15 (25%) were currently receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy. Pretest education on HIV was provided to 233/725 (32%) detainees. The study further reports on detaineesâ reactions and feelings towards non-disclosure and disclosure of their HIV test results in the labour camps. Conclusions Mandatory testing is almost universal in the labour camps although a proportion of detainees were unaware that this included an HIV test. HIV test results should be disclosed to all labour camp detainees to reduce their distress of not knowing and preven"
