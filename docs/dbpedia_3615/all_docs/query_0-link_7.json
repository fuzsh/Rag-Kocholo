        "text": "In the second half of the 19th century, East Turkistan (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) was a place where many religions and cultures coexisted and attracted the interest of travelers from all around the world. These travelers were motivated by the desire to delve into the unexplored language and culture of the Silk Road. One classic example of the efforts of Eastern scholars involved the four German (Prussian) Turfan expeditions known from 1902-1914. The primary goal of these expeditions was to obtain Buddhist artifacts as well as other cultural relics and written records from pre-Islamic Central Asia. Albert von Le Coq (1860-1930) led the second and fourth expeditions and acquired many friends in the region. Among the notable figures in the local aristocracy was Emin Khwāja Wang (1885-1933) from Lukchun, Turfan. The manuscript this article evaluates delves into the genealogy of the Wang family in Turfan, spanning from Feridun Wang to Emin Wang. This manuscript, referred to as Manuscript Arab 4, is currently housed in the Turfan Room of the Oriental Department at the Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin). It had likely been brought to Berlin during the German Turfan expeditions. This study provides an introduction to the Wang family in Turfan and presents additional sources related to their history, a copy of the manuscript, and insights into its linguistic characteristics. It also includes a transcription of the text into Turkish and an index/glossary of select words. This primary source document from the period allows valuable information to be gained about Wang&amp;#39;s empire in Turfan.\n\nPublished in Memory and Commemoration across Central Asia, eds. Gabrielle van den Berg and Elena Paskaleva, 53-89 (Leiden: Brill, 2023). This article examines a Turkic-language Shahnama manuscript housed in the Center of Written Heritage at the National Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan. It identifies its text as Âmidî’s translation of Firdausi’s work which was a popular version in the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century. Analysis of its unfinished illustrations compares them to other productions attributed to Khurasan in the last quarter of the sixteenth century, and narrows the scope to the last decade and a half. This refined provenance suggests that the visual schema to the Shahnama manuscript located in Tajikistan was added during the period in which the Abu’l-Khairid Shibanids conquered the Safavids and took over eastern Iran between 1588–1598. How the object migrated from the Ottoman sphere to Transoxiana cannot be proven. The presented case study instead intimates the Uzbek–Ottoman exchanges in arts of the book contributing to the object’s production, and the state of manuscripts manufactured in late-century Herat and broader Khurasan. Despite the political turmoil, artistic talent from multiple centres congregated in this region in which staff, manuscripts, and their intended buyers crossed multiple dynastic lines.\n\nThis article presents a hitherto little-known Manchu work on the Western Regions, i.e., Islamic Central Asia. Dating to 1761, I believe it represents the earliest effort to compile a political and geographic description of this region for Qing officials in Xin- jiang. It consists of two sections: (1) an account of the sedentary Muslims of Xinjiang and neighboring Islamic polities; and (2) a description of the Kirghiz. This stand-alone Manchu work was subsequently incorporated into certain rescensions of a more ex- tensive Chinese-language composition, known variously as the Xiyu zhi, Huijiang zhi, or Xiyu dili tushuo. After a brief introduction, the article provides a transcription and translation of the text as it survives in a Moscow manuscript of the Xiyu zhi. This text can be read in conjunction with the section included in the Xiyu dili tushuo to produce a near-complete work."
