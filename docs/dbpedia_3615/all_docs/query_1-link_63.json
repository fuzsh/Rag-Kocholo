        "text": "WARNING! SPOILER ALERT!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!\n\nHer luck is too good: the talent for cultivation, the talent for various occupations, the ability to contract spirit beasts, and the identity of the spirit beasts. But these things are consuming her good fortune. If a person's luck is too good, there will be a certain responsibility or frustration. Every time there is a disaster, there must be an outstanding person to take care of it. (Raw)\n\nShe is the destined person who has good fortune and will experience a lot of ordeal. Her fortune is better than the average person, but correspondingly, the ordeal experienced later will be more, greater, and severely endanger her life.\n\nShe is a very low-key person.\n\nProphecy[]\n\nSima You Yue is a woman who is forced to disguise herself as a male because of a prophecy in the Sage Pavilion that foretells of a four-faceted female spirit master who will overturn the existence of the Sage Pavilion.\n\nDue to this, Sima You Yue rarely wears female clothes. Her female identity was exposed to the public in chapter 1109.\n\nTimes where she does wear them are:\n\nChapters 412-415: When the Sima Clan celebrated from moving from Yi Lin Continent to Restless Continent.\n\nChapters 580-593: When Sima You Yue and Wu Lingyu/Mo Sha went to the Devil Realm.\n\nChapters 616-623: When she stayed at the Violet Water Clan in the Ninth Star Ocean.\n\nChapters 924-933: When she celebrated establishing her sect.\n\nChapters 1116-2319 (Finale): When her female identity was exposed so there was no use hiding it.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nSima You Yue is seven points (out of ten) similar to her mother. When dressed up, she is nine points (out of ten) similar. Even her personality is similar to her mother.\n\nBoth her and her mother’s looks are inherited from her maternal grandmother.\n\nHer mother and Murong Xi's mother are cousins. Both have similar faces. Their daughters, Sima You Yue and Murong Xi, have similar faces to their mothers.\n\nBlack Lotus / Mo Lian Bloodline[]\n\n\"There will be black lotus patterns on the back of the Jiu You (Ninth Underworld) tribe. The more petals, the purer the blood power, the better the talent, and the higher the future achievements.\n\nHowever, they don’t know when the nine-petal Black Lotus has not appeared. Even the old ancestors and lords have only eight petals.\" - chapter 1999 (Raw)\n\nBlack Lotus's blood, when matched with skills, all barriers will be useless to her.\n\nLight Devil Body Physique / Divine Devil Physique[]\n\n\"'This world is separated into light and darkness... People from the world of light have a physique that will only be found after a few hundred thousand years. This kind of physique actually contains a kind of aura. This aura will let them cultivate at speeds that surpass normal Spirit Masters by more than a few times, furthermore, their bottlenecks are few. As a result, they have very strong abilities to recover. This kind of body is called a Light Body Physique.\n\nOn the other hand, in the Dark world, those with dark auras are termed Devil Body Physiques. If one was able to use one of the two types, to the average person, this would be seen as an extremely fortuitous event.' Mo Sha said, 'However, you are not the same as them.'\n\n'You said I possess a Light Devil Body Physique, don’t tell me that you’re saying I have both kinds?' Sima You Yue said.\n\nMo Sha gave her an appraising look, saying straightforwardly, 'That’s right. You have both kinds of auras in your body. One represents the light while one represents the darkness. Both are at odds with each other but they now reside in one body. What do you think will happen? Furthermore, at that time, you were just a baby, you would have been killed with even a little bit of shock.'\" - chapter 66\n\n\"'During the last explosion, my dark attribute disappeared from my body with my soul. Now I can still use the power of darkness, but it is connected to my soul and has nothing to do with my body. One exist in the body, one in the soul, so there will be no more fights,' Sima You Yue explained.\" - chapter 2159 (Raw)\n\nBackground[]\n\nAs Reincarnation (and before the start of the novel)[]\n\nWhen the world was first created in the Chaotic World, she was the Black Lotus. She and Ming watched the years change. One day, she felt tired and chose to enter reincarnation. She called herself 'Reincarnation' in every life. Later, she got tired of that name and chose her own name (chapters 2297-2298, 2307).\n\nShe was once Great Emperor Azure's woman.\n\nPrevious Life[]\n\n\"Previously, she was the Organization’s most powerful assassin, since she started working for the Organization she never once missed a target.\n\nNever would she have expected that the second person-in-charge of the Organization was jealous of the attention and recognition she had from her boss and took advantage of the boss’ absence and made her perform a dangerous task. However, it was already too late when she realized that it was a trap. Because of the high stakes of billions of dollars, the Organization chose to abandon her and even prepared the most advanced bomb for her. She was blown into smithereens along with the building she was in. The process of death was too short, before she had time to curse, she fell into the darkness, and lost all consciousness.\" - chapter 1\n\nThen, when her soul came into the current world, it split into two. The part with the memory of her previous life became \"Ximen You Yue\", while the part with no memory became Sima You Yue.\n\nAs Ximen You Yue[]\n\n\"'At that time, Zong Zheng Han Yue and I were extremely good friends. We grew up together because I was a tri faceted spirit master and she was a dual faceted spirit master. That was why my brilliance slowly overshadowed hers, causing her to change slowly. There was once that she gave me a rare spirit stone. She told me that it was my birthday present. It was only later that I found out it was something that would release poison slowly. Also, my entire family had absorbed that kind of poison. So, when the Zong Zheng Clan and the Yin Yang Palace attacked us, we couldn’t fight back at all.\n\n'Then you…'\n\n'Of course, I died.' Sima You Yue said, 'Zhong Zheng Han Yue used the Soul Stealing Lantern, thinking of scattering my soul. I don’t know why, though, my soul did not scatter. Instead, it landed inside this body. However, because I had injured my soul, I had lost all my memories. When I advanced in rank, I recovered my memories and recalled everything that had happened.'\" - chapter 505\n\nReason for two souls[]\n\n\"'No, your rebirth has nothing to do with this.' Yin Lin said, 'You belong to this world. The previous world was just a mistake, so everything will be returned to the right place.\n\n'If we belong to the same soul, why are the ages so different?' Sima You Yue asked puzzledly.\n\n'You became Ximen You Yue as soon as you came, and she became Sima You Yue after a while in the world.' Yin Lin said, 'But because you are one and have a mutually attractive relationship, so only after you die will you enter her body, and the souls of the two will be truly united.'\" - chapter 1067 (Raw)\n\nContracted / Refined Items[]\n\nInterspatial Ring[]\n\nIt was an ancient artifact and was a prized family heirloom.\n\nIt was what Sima You Yue's biological father left for her before he left to find her biological mother.\n\nSpirit Pagoda[]\n\nIt is the result of fusing the Spirit Pearl and the Seven Layered Pagoda (chapter 150). One day outside is ten days in there.\n\nLater, it is fused with a Qiankun box (chapter 1874) and Chaotic World's origin of life water (chapter 1877). Little Spirit can now freely leave the Spirit Pagoda and is much better than ordinary artifacts.\n\nIt is Little Spirit's real body. He can control and manage everything in the Spirit Pagoda for Sima You Yue, such as where to place/banish someone(s), collect and store materials and items, take care of herbs, and construct buildings.\n\nLing Long[]\n\nShe is the supreme/divine artifact that can change into any weapon. She can rival the Sky Splitter Devil Sword.\n\nIn chapter 2301, Sima You Yue erased her connection to Ling Long and let Wu Lingyu establish a connection.\n\nIllusion Ring (female ring)[]\n\nThis illusion ring is not the same illusion ring at the start of the novel.\n\nThis ring allows her to change her gender to male and aura. It prevents powerful people and spirit beasts, excluding Little Seven and Heaven, from seeing through her real gender.\n\nIt is a pair ring, given to her by Wu Lingyu.\n\nSince chapter 1116, she uses the gender changing function less often.\n\nBlood Thumb Ring[]\n\nIt is the Divine Devil Valley’s successor’s ring. It is a symbol of authority that can mobilize the forces of a large portion of the Divine Devil Valley. It can also mobilize the forces in some cities.\n\nIt contains a secret that is connected to Divine Devil Valley.\n\nHeaven’s Halberd / Heavenly Halberd[]\n\nIt is a divine weapon used by Emperor Qing Dao (chapters 521, 1589).\n\nShe did not repair the halberd in the novel.\n\nLittle Purple[]\n\nIt is a top grade purple lightning encountered in lightning tribulations. After it was absorbed by her, it gained its own consciousness. She can now call upon lightning tribulation and Cloud Spirit.\n\nLater, it takes on the form of a kitten (chapter 1754).\n\nBlack Lotus Little Realm[]\n\nA little realm given to Sima You Yue by Great Emperor Azure.\n\nIt is larger than a normal little realm.\n\nPrinciple of Faith[]\n\nShe receives this principle after absorbing too many vows of light energy in Blood Fiend City.\n\nIt is a natural formed principle, a kind of rule of power in heaven and earth. The more people admire her, the more the power of Faith will be injected into her body and that power will also increase.\n\nIt is one of two of the most powerful forces in the world. But it is a ticking time bomb due to her Divine Devil Physique.\n\nTao / Dao of Heaven[]\n\nTao/Dao she receives from the Tree of Life, Tsing Yi.\n\nIt has twelve gold characters of \"Endless time, endless space, endless life!\"\n\n\"Time is more than time, space is constant, and life is endless. This is her way, an understanding of time, space, and life in the world.\" - chapter 1109\n\nField / Domain / Realm (Raw)[]\n\nA rare skill she receives from the Tree of Life, Tsing Yi.\n\nIt merged with her Tao/Dao.\n\nShe can suppress or provide power to whomever she chooses in the space.\n\nHundred Ghost Banner[]\n\nIt is a devil overlord spirit tool made from refining souls. It can contain any number of ghosts.\n\nSima Clan's Inheritance (Raw)[]\n\nWhen she recognizes her ancestors in the Sima Clan's ancestral hall's genealogy, she receives a power and a set of spirit skills, (Perfect) Fusion and a mysterious bubble (chapter 1473).\n\nSome clansmen in the Sima Clan receives Enlightenment.\n\nDead Body[]\n\nA group of unknown people are killing people and making them into dead soldiers. Sima You Yue happens to be interested in them and uses the bodies herself.\n\nShe stole the dead bodies from the Du Nan Clan, Yang Clan, and Liu Clan.\n\nPrinciple of Ghost (Raw)[]\n\nIt is one of two of the most powerful forces in the world. It is the power to destroy the world.\n\n4 Sifang God Seals (Raw)[]\n\nThese seals are named according to the character on each artifact, respectively North, East, South and West Seals. These seals are the keys to unlocking Yu Keluo's imprisonment (chapter 2132).\n\nLittle Throne[]\n\nSima You Yue's 200th birthday gift from Ming (chapter 2165).\n\nShe can control the size to seat a maximum of two people. The bigger it is, the more spiritual energy is consumed. The speed depends on her own strength.\n\nIt is better than using teleportation arrays.\n\nSkills and Abilities[]\n\nAfter learning how to strengthen her mental power and using the Secret of Soul Refinement skill book for decades, Sima You Yue can remember things after learning and watching it once.\n\nSima You Yue is really intelligent, as she can see through people's hidden emotions in their eyes. She can even deduce hidden secrets from a few clues and her instinct.\n\nSima You Yue excels in many skills, including alchemy, array and martial arts, but her embroidery skill is very poor. When she tries to embroider something that can be seen from both sides, it comes out on opposite sides.\n\nUnlike normal people, Sima You Yue knows how to refine pills, tame spirit beasts, and set up arrays. But her skills are worse than Wu Lingyu, after soul fusion, who can do these things and more quicker and with ease. Even his cultivation is higher than her.\n\nIn the beginning, she did not like to drink tea but because Wu Lingyu liked it, she started making tea. Then she started liking it.\n\nEveryone knows that the tea she makes is delicious. In fact, she doesn't make it as good as Wu Lingyu's.\n\nThe food she cooks is very delicious that even the cultivators who do not normally eat will eat more.\n\nShe likes to drink wine, therefore she has lots of wine fermented and stored in the Spirit Pagoda, especially fruit wine. Of course, Little Spirit is the one who ends up making them.\n\nShe is best at medicine and alchemy, followed by array, beast taming, and spirit seeking. Refining tools is her weakest skill.\n\nShe never used her armament skill to create anything throughout the novel. The only thing she did was purifying materials. One day she will make a space ship.\n\nSima You Yue knows how to play the flute and guzheng.\n\nHeartbreak Valley (merged)[]\n\nLocation[]\n\nInside Heartbreak Valley / Broken Heart Valley\n\nMineral / Ore Veins[]\n\n1 long vein from West Coast Desert's Brave Moon Sect (stolen by Sima You Yue)\n\n1 huge, hidden vein a little far from Heartbreak Valley (gifted by Third Mo/Mo San)\n\nSima You Yue created a sect for people that are being hunted down, want revenge, who aren’t afraid to die, and deal with things that might involve their life and death. Everyone who joins must pledge a vow to never do anything against her and her people, or let her down.\n\nBesides her family and friends, the other members are:\n\nSect Master: Ximen Feng\n\nVice Sect Master: Sima You Yue\n\nIn charge of keeping order: Bi Sheng / Old Bi\n\nIn charge of business: Liu Liang Cai\n\nFormer 10 Great Evils:\n\n1st Brother - Feng Zhi\n\n2nd Brother - Feng Kai\n\n3rd Brother - Shi Chen\n\n4th Brother - You Si\n\n5th Brother - Hong Wu\n\n6th Brother - Ni An Yi\n\n7th Brother - Dai Yi\n\n8th Brother - Shui Qing Yang\n\n9th Brother - Tao Hong Sheng\n\n10th Brother - Kong Ren\n\nMu Lian Xin\n\nHu Yang, nickname Big Beard\n\nWang Mou / Wang Mo\n\nSitu Cheng\n\nFu Yi\n\nand 20,000+ Unnamed People (from Blood Fiend City)\n\nFirst Valley (Raw)[]\n\nLocation[]\n\nInside Heartbreak Valley / Broken Heart Valley\n\nMineral / Ore Veins[]\n\n1 long vein from West Coast Desert's Brave Moon Sect (stolen by Sima You Yue)\n\n1 huge, hidden vein a little far from Heartbreak Valley (gifted by Third Mo/Mo San)\n\nYu Xue Mountain / Yu Xue Shan\n\n1 large vein\n\n5 or 6 medium-sized veins\n\nSeveral small veins\n\nHeartbreak Valley and Divine Devil Valley merged together to form First Valley in chapter 1394. Both have equal power and equal rights. No one would be under the other, and no one would be better than the other. In the future, everyone will live on equal terms, and love and help each other. Everyone who joins must pledge a vow to not betray the sect.\n\nEach sides have their own specialty: Heartbreak Valley has the fighting force while Divine Devil Valley has the professional occupations. Of course, Sima You Yue is the \"mascot\" who does not manage the sect.\n\nMembers are:\n\nValley Master: Liang Wu Ming, Ximen Feng\n\nVice Valley Master: Sima You Yue\n\n4 Deputy Valley Masters\n\n34 Elders\n\nFormer 10 Great Evils\n\n10 Divisions\n\nPoison Division's Master: Poison King Yuan Ju\n\nFinance Hall's Master: Liu Liang Cai\n\nTextile Hall's Master: Third Aunt Du\n\nAll the surviving members of Heartbreak Valley\n\nAll the surviving members of Divine Devil Valley\n\nShi Qiu Shuang\n\nShi Qian Zhi\n\nJiang Jun Xian\n\nand other surviving members of the former Black Dragon Cult\n\nMaster Ji and his disciple (from Lost Land)\n\nSpiritual Energy Cultivation []\n\nCultivation Stage Rank Age Chapter\n\nNovel/Manhua\n\nNo Cultivation N/A 14 0 Spirit Warrior 1 14-15 15/ Spirit Lord (Spirit Master) 1 14-15 33/ 5 14-15 35/21 6 14-16 104 7 15-16 144 8 15-16 148 9 15-16 150 Great Spirit Master 1 15-16 150 2 15-17 157 Spirit King N/A 16-18 158 Spirit Overlord 1 16-19 165 2 16-19 192 3 16-19 220 4 16-19 241 5 16-19 241 6 19 251 Spirit Saint 3 20-29 267 5 20-29 307 Spirit Paragon 1 20-29 364 6 20-29 384 9 20-29 401 Divine Rank Divine King Beginner / Lower 20-29 424 Intermediate / Middle 20-29 461 Advanced / Peak 20-29 600 Divine Overlord Advanced / Peak 20-29 619 Divine Saint Beginner / Lower 20-29 668 Intermediate / Middle 30-39 1033 Divine Paragon Intermediate / Middle 30-39 1114 Advanced / Peak 50-59 1283 Monarch Rank (Monarch King?) 1st Level 50-59 1348 2nd Level 52-61 1474 N/A 54-63 1508 N/A 57-66 1534 She \"dies\" in chapters 1732-1733.\n\nCurrent Age: 67-76 years old\n\nSee Soul Cultivation (Raw) below for her adventures as a soul.

In the past, her powers were not her own. They were from forming contracts, from Emperor Qing Dao's soul, and Ninth Underworld ancestor (chapter 2305). Divine Rank? N/A 246+ 2308\n\nSoul Cultivation (Raw)[]\n\n\"Soul cultivation refers to those who enter the ghost world after death in other interfaces, and resume cultivation. Soul cultivation is weak at the beginning, so it was difficult to survive.\n\nGhost cultivation refers to those ghosts who practice ghost spirits. When Sima You Yue was alive, she was considered a ghost. Ghost cultivation is much more powerful than soul cultivation, because ghost cultivation can contract the ghost beast, and it can be practiced at the same time as ghost cultivation. In addition to fighting, you can use ghost energy and soul power.\n\nIn addition, some ghost-cultivated spiritual skills suppress soul-cultivation, and even control them as their slaves and affiliates. Therefore, ghost spirits in ghost world are relatively few. But once grown up, the soul cultivation is very powerful, dominating the world in the ghost world.\" - chapter 1742\n\n\"Soul cultivation is more complicated than ghost cultivation. In addition to practicing soul power, it must also cultivate soul bodies. If the soul power is too strong and the soul body cannot keep up, it may also be unable to withstand the soul power and explode.\" - chapter 1743\n\nLevel Stage Age of the Soul Chapter She \"dies\" and enters the Underworld. Her memories in the Underworld are sealed (chapters 1842-1844). Chapter 1736 is the start of her adventures as a soul. No Cultivation N/A 69-78 1736 Condensation Period (?)

Later on, she lets Wu Lingyu initiate kisses.\n\nAlthough Sima You Yue had some feelings for Wu Lingyu, it was not until chapter 922 when they officially became boyfriend-girlfriend.\n\nWhat Sima You Yue wants in her boyfriend': Everything is fine, but he must spoil me! If he loves me, he must spoil me. What I say are like heaven’s mandate. If I say to eat vegetables, he cannot eat meat. If I say that I like the stars in the sky, he will pick for me without me asking. Of course, I will not make such a request. Anyway, he must be very nice to me!' - chapter 660\n\nShe experiences her first love sickness in chapter 966.\n\nSima You Yue's thoughts about Wu Lingyu as a marriage partner:\n\n\"She was independent, but that didn’t mean that she didn’t know how to rely on others. She loved having someone to depend on when she was tired, and loved it when she didn’t have to think of anything and could just leave it all to someone else. This man. He was the support that she wanted.\" - chapter 965\n\n\"Sima You Yue enjoyed this feeling of occasional reliance. He is the one she depends on, and she is willing to share her problems with him, but also willing to help share some of his problems. But he never shared his problems with her. Everytime, he just quickly dealt with his problems by himself. Does she need to get stronger before she would be able to help face those problems with him together? But this feeling she got was not good!\" - chapter 981\n\nSima You Yue and Wu Lingyu are finally married after over a century of delay (chapter 2194). There was no wedding, just the two of them.\n\nAfter most of the problems are settled in the Human Realm (Lower Continent and Ancient Primordial Lands), Ghost Realm (Ghost Realm, Soul Realm, and Infernal Hell) and Devil Realm, except the Divine Realm/God's Land, the Sima Clan hosted a grand wedding for Sima You Yue and Wu Lingyu (chapters 2237-2239). Old friends, family, and guests from the three realms came.\n\nWu Xiaodao[]\n\nWu Xiaodao has a relaxed temper but not a keen sense.\n\nBecause of her very bad luck, she will explode the furnace when doing alchemy. But she had talent, she can remember pill recipes after seeing it twice. The only thing she can touch is the cooking flame. So, she does not know anything except cooking (chapter 2241).\n\nShe has a lively nature, is curious about everything, and is intimate. She is lawless. Fortunately, she is not very noisy, and she is also very good here. In addition to being a bit wild, her heart is still good (chapter 2246).\n\nWu Qiyu[]\n\nWu Qiyu's personality is mature and stable. He has sharp instinct. In addition to being good to his mother and sister, he is very indifferent to outsiders. Sima You Yue does not know who he learned this temperament from.\n\nHe is talented not only in cultivation. In terms of professional occupations, he is like Sima You Yue and Wu Lingyu, he knows almost everything. Although his young, 16-years-old strength level is not particularly high now, but it is far beyond his peers (chapter 2241).\n\nKnown skills: spirit seeking\n\nWu Hexi[]\n\nShe is named after Xuan Qiu He, for his sacrifice for Sima You Yue and the world.\n\nHer Parents[]\n\nSima You Yue finally meets her missing parents:\n\nChapter 1367: Her father on Mu Shan/Mu Mountain in the Ghost Town.\n\nChapter 2101: Her mother in a volcano in the Infernal Hell.\n\nGhost King[]\n\nWith Sima You Yue's gift of Chaotic World's water, her grandfather is successfully promoted to the Emperor Rank (chapter 2150). He is currently the only Emperor Rank in all the continents except the Divine Realm/God's Land.\n\nAdopted Family[]\n\nLittle Tu/Xiao Tu\n\nLittle Eleven - Violet Water Clan\n\nLittle Lucky/Xiao Xi\n\nSpirit Beasts[]\n\nAll Her Spirit Beasts[]\n\nIn chapter 1413, Sima You Yue's spirit beasts had their own private competition to see who killed the most enemies to determine their ranking.
