        "text": "Ambassador Cui Tiankai traveled to Boston where he visited Zhou Danling, the Chinese Student injured in the recent bombing, and her family. He also met families of Lu Lingzi, who lost her life in the incident, at the Boston Logan airport.\n\nAt the Boston Medical Center, Ambassador Cui conveyed to Zhou Danling and her family the best wishes from President Xi Jinping, the Chinese Government, the Chinese Embassy and Chinese Consulate-General in New York. He shared with them the ongoing efforts made by Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chinese Embassy and Consulate-General in the United States as well as relevant US authorities in searching, rescuing and assisting Chinese nationals killed or wounded during the bombing. He hoped that she could recover soon and resume her study. Zhou Danling thanked the Ambassador for visiting her and the consolation from Chinese leaders and Government. She looked forward to finishing her study after recovery.\n\nAmbassador Cui also went to Logan Airport to meet Lu Lingzi's family members who traveled to the United States following the tragedy. Ambassador Cui conveyed heartfelt sympathies from President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Government. He expressed solidarities on behalf of the Chinese Embassy and Chinese Consulate-General in New York and said that the Embassy and Consulate-General would do everything they can to assist them. Lu's families expressed their appreciation for that.\n\nIn the above meetings, Ambassador Cui stressed that the US attaches great importance to the casualties involving Chinese nationals caused by the bombing, and has been in close communication and cooperation with the Chinese side throughout the process. The Chinese and American people are standing side by side in the face of this terrible incident. The two sides agreed that closer cooperation is needed to address such common challenges.\n\nOn April 15, two bombings occurred during the marathon race in Boston, killing three people and wounded over a hundred. Lu Lingzi, a Chinese student at Boston University, was among the three who lost their lives. Zhou Danling, also a BU student, was injured."
