        "text": "Lingzhi mushroom with its medical properties represents one of the most significant Chinese medical fungus with two thousand years recorded history as health enhancer, promoter of longevity, and detox of mind and spirit.\n\nSince the old times, Chinese monks believe that Ganoderma lucidum - lingzhi, help people to see spirits or become spirits themselves by receiving the magical energy of the immortals. The Latin lucidum, means “shiny” refers to the appearance of the fungus’ fruiting body. Lingzhi (Chin. 霊芝) - “spirit mushroom”, is one of the most famous medicinal mushrooms. In the past, lingzhi was very expensive because it only grew in the wild. Lingzhi is nowadays mainly cultivated on logs and sawdust, thanks to Shigeaki Mori who pioneered method of cultivation, therefore it becomes accessible and affordable for everyone.\n\nIn Japan, lingzhi is known as reishi.\n\nThe first written record of lingzhi was during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 9 AD). Lingzhi is particularly famous for aging-related and degenerative conditions, such as cancer, and as an immune stimulant. It contains over 400 biological substances beneficial to the body, valued for their ability to improve physical and mental health.\n\nCompendium of Materia Medica (Chin. 本草綱目bencao gangmu) written in 1578, states that “continued use of lingzhi will lighten weight and increase longevity”. Linzhi is known as great medical help in treatment of hepatopathy, chronic hepatitis, nephritis, hypertension, arthritis, neurasthenia, insomnia, bronchitis, asthma, and gastric ulcer.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) it was called Qizhi, or “red fungus”, believed to benefit the heart.\n\nIn addition to its medical indications, linzhi has a long history of being used as a spiritual aid. In the past people used it as a talisman for protection against evil, while monks traditionally use lingzhi to increase concentration, heighten their focus, and increase their will power.\n\nLingzhi in TCM\n\nIn the Classic of Materia medica (Chin. Shennong bencao jing 神農本草經) written between 206 BC and 220 AD it is classified six types of ling zhi fungus according to colour differences. Generaly speaking, in traditional Chinese medicine lingzi is used to supply three treasures – jing (essence), qi (vital energy), and shen (spirit). Ling zhi is in the highest class of tonics, promoting longevity used for patterns of qi, blood, yin&yang deficiency. It is neutral in nature keeping balance in the body. Lingzhi tastes sweet which tends to slow down acute reactions and detoxify the body., replenishing qi and blood. It mainly helps meridians of the heart, kidney, liver and the lungs. It TCM lingzhi is very much helpful in:\n\nSyndromes of deficiency often combined with ginseng, astralagus and Chinese angelica root.\n\nHeart deficiency symptom’s, e.g. unease emotions, palpitation, insomnia, and amnesia. All above symptoms are considered as malnourishment of heart and mind, deficiency of qi and blood. Usualy ling zhi is smashed into powder and mixed with sour jujube seed and arborvitae seed.\n\nLung deficiency symtoms, e.g. cough and dyspnea. It is used singly, or combined with qi tonics and lung-astringing herbs, such as ginseng and schisandra berry.\n\nTogether with cordyceps sinensis, lingzhi has the most extensive range of indications and combines well with it in treatment of lung and liver conditions, as well as to provide all-round adaptogenic support.\n\nLingzi in modern medicine\n\nIn the last 30 years, lingzhi has undergone a number of clinical studies with humans and is confirmed medical effects to a wide variety of disorders, including neurasthenia, dizziness, insomnia, rhinitis, duodenal ulcers, liver pain (hepatodynia), symptoms associated with anorexia, maldeveloped brain, retinal pigmentary degeneration, leukopenia, progressive muscular dystrophy, atrophic nyotonus, and osteogenic hyperplasia; and mental disease caused by environmental stress, Alzheimer’s disease, liver failure, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.\n\nMany scientific researches confirmed great medical use of linzhi because:\n\nGanoderma is an extremely useful alternative to cortisone therapy, because it has cortisone-like antiinflammatory agents whose efficacy is equal to that of diclofenac/voltaren, a powerful antiinflammatory drug NSAID. In particular, it has an antiinflammatory effect on the vascular walls and is a tonic for the adrenal gland.\n\nIt has many active compounds called polysaccharides, with immune-boosting and anti-aging effects, e.g. Beta-D-glucan, also called G-I, which is used clinically against sarcoma 180. (researches confirm it may prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells).\n\nLingzhi is packed with variety of Beta-glucans. Some Beta-glucans may reduce high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, others work as hepatic protectors and others still prevent theformation of fibrosis. A subset of beta-glucans - polysaccharides - such as ganoderan B and D, are hypoglycemic, so they lower the level of blood sugar, and improve glucose utilization in the tissues.\n\nThanks to its beta-glucans, is very suitable for increasing the concentration of salivary IgA antibodies that protect the mouth from microorganisms, preventing stomatitis.
