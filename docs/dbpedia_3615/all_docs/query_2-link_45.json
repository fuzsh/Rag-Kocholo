        "text": "A week after her sixteenth birthday, Ye Mengyuan, whose name means “Dream Realized,” bid farewell to doting friends and family for a summer abroad that should have been a Chinese teen-ager’s dream. Accompanying her was a fellow Jiangshan Middle School student, Wang Linjia, with whom Ye had grown up in the city of Jiangshan, in eastern Zhejiang Province. With thirty classmates, the pair—sporting matching ponytails and square-frame glasses—were embarking on a transatlantic summer camp of sorts. The stated purpose of the trip was language immersion, but they also hoped to size up sunny California to see if they might want to return for a longer stay (their itinerary included visits to Stanford, U.C. Berkeley, and U.C.L.A.). Neither saw enough of their host country to find out.\n\nThe Boeing 777 that crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport three days ago killed the two friends and injured more than a hundred and eighty people. On Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, where the most popular hashtag since the crash, used over two million times, has been “777 Crash,” the names of the teen-age casualties quickly shot up to the top of the most-searched list. Articles citing the girls’ accomplishments, which repeatedly call the pair the “academic cream of the post-’95 generation,” have been continually shared, often alongside a portrait of the girls taken shortly before the trip. Each curves an arm overhead to form a heart. Wang was an elected student leader three years running and excelled in physics, calligraphy, and drawing; Ye, a gifted pianist and public speaker, recently won a national gymnastics competition. Punctuated by virtual red-and-yellow candles are somber sighs: “Girls perishing in the prime of their youth, as the irreplaceable pride of their families…”\n\nLike the senseless death of the twenty-three-year-old graduate student Lu Lingzi in the Boston Marathon bombing, the tragedy of Ye and Wang has hit a communal nerve in a nation of single-child households. “Nurturing sons to be dragons and daughters to be phoenixes” is a mantra ingrained in the Chinese consciousness, as is an age-old lament: “Never should the white-haired send off the black-haired.”\n\nThat the three-week jaunt cost each student—or, more accurately, each set of parents—roughly five thousand dollars in a country with an average per-capita income of four thousand nine hundred and forty dollars has not gone unnoted, nor has the fact that the Asiana flight was carrying a second group of school-age tourists from China. As if in direct rebuke to the outpouring of sentimentality online, one microblogger from Chongqing wrote that “those who can afford to go to summer camp are the rich!”\n\nThis vein of unfeeling skepticism in response to the deaths has, in some quarters, turned the conversation to the same topics that underlie much of the discussion concerning the struggle and striving of China’s urban middle class. Wealth—or, really, whatever one manages to accumulate between the boundaries of subsistence and extravagance—is viewed with suspicion, and its sources are often assumed to be sordid.\n\n“I suspect that those rascals who participate in summer camps are the children of high officials or loaded people,” one Weibo blogger speculated. Another, who goes by the handle The Glint of One Grain of Rice, added, without alluding specifically to the crash, “I strongly oppose preferential treatment and privileges of certain students! Poor children in the countryside slave away in the fields during the summers while rich kids go abroad to the other side of the world. They don’t have the same starting point, how can they compete?”\n\nThe yawning divide between the haves and have-nots has produced, in the opinion of some Web users, a clinical and indiscriminate hatred of wealth. In one camp are those who seem to have fully ingested Deng Xiaoping’s dictum that to get rich is to be glorious: “The only people who loath the rich are those who can’t become rich!” one blogger wrote. Others have taken a more indignantly analytical response: “To those who believe that the children died because their parents earned unclean money. Are you saying that because you don’t have enough money to go abroad, your money is necessarily clean?”\n\nFor the two sixteen-year-olds who were hoping to spend fifteen relatively carefree days at West Valley Christian School, outside Los Angeles, money did not appear to be such a focus. Instead, they professed, on their Weibo accounts, a love of dogs, animation, and American television. Besides their photographs, the second most popular images bloggers have attached to the mention of their names are screenshots of the girls’ microblogs. “Perhaps time can dilute the coffee in the cup, and polish the outlines of memory,” Wang wrote, poetically, in her second-to-last update. Her last entry, written the day before the crash, was also her first in English. “Go,” she wrote.\n\nPhotograph: AP."
