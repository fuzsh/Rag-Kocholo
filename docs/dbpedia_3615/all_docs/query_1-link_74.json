        "text": "The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defense against invading microbes. Some immune cells carry specific receptor proteins called Toll-like receptors that can identify microbes and the signals they emit. As soon as the receptors have detected a threat – for example through sensing oily molecules that make up the cell membranes of microbes – they produce signaling proteins called cytokines and chemokines to alert other immune cells.\n\nThe DNA in the cell’s nucleus carries the instructions needed to make proteins. To produce proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, the information first has to be transferred into mRNA templates, which carry the instructions to the sites in the cell where the proteins are made. Cytokine and chemokine mRNAs are generally short-lived, but previous studies in 2009 and 2011 have shown that an enzyme called IRAK2 can stabilize them to make them last longer. IRAK enzymes are activated by the Toll-like receptors after a threat has been detected. However, until now it was not known whether IRAK2 also helps to transport the mRNAs of cytokines and chemokines out of the cell nucleus.\n\nUsing immune cells of mice, Zhou et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the previous studies – discovered that IRAK2 helped to export the mRNAs of cytokines and chemokines from the immune cell nucleus into the surrounding cell fluid. The Toll-like receptors recognized the oily molecules of the microbes and consequently activated IRAK2, which lead to IRAK2 being moved into the cell nucleus.\n\nOnce activated, IRAK2 helped to assemble the export machinery that moved selected mRNAs out of the nucleus to build the proteins. To do so, IRAK2 stopped a destabilizing protein from binding to the mRNA, so that instead the export machinery could transport the mRNA of the cytokines and chemokines out of the cell nucleus.\n\nA next step will be to test whether IRAK2 is required to guide exported mRNA tothe sites in the cell where the proteins are made. This new insight could help to develop new treatments for various diseases. For example, diseases in which the immune system attacks the cells of the body, rather than invaders, can be caused by too many cytokines and chemokines. Since IRAK2 helps to control the availability of cytokines and chemokines it may in future be used as a new drug target.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29630.002\n\nEukaryotic cells produce mRNA in the nucleus through a series of events including 5’ capping, 3’-end processing and splicing, which are coupled with transcription. Once these processes are complete, mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be translated to generate proteins. Nxf1 (also known as TAP) is the key mRNA export receptor, which only binds processed mRNA. Upon completion of mRNA processing, Nxf1 is recruited to the mRNA along with the TREX complex to promote the nuclear export the mRNA. The nuclear export adaptor ALYREF, a subunit of the TREX complex, plays a critical role in integrating the signals provided by mRNA processing and in triggering nuclear export receptor Nxf1 loading for the export of the target mRNAs (Hung et al., 2010; Viphakone et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2000). ALYREF-Nxf1 interaction provides a mark on mRNA to signify that nuclear RNA-processing events are complete, and the processed mRNA is ready for export to the cytoplasm. Several other proteins have also been implicated as nuclear export adaptors, including the shuttling SR (serine- and arginine-rich) proteins 9G8, SRp20 and SRSF1 (Huang et al., 2003). However, it remains unclear how these nuclear export adaptors interact with different classes of mRNAs to achieve sequence-specific, stimulus-dependent export of target transcripts.\n\nToll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulates the expression of chemokines and cytokines at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (Anderson, 2008). Cytokine and chemokine mRNAs have short half-lives because of conserved cis-elements in their three prime untranslated regions (3’ UTRs). Much effort has been devoted to understand how the conserved cis-elements within the 3’ UTR can be recognized by RNA-binding proteins (including SRSF1) that function to mediate mRNA decay (Fenger-Grøn et al., 2005; Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005; Mayr, 2016; Sun et al., 2011). Nevertheless, whether and how cytokine and chemokine mRNAs are regulated during nuclear export in response to TLR stimulation is unknown. TLRs transduce signals through the adaptor molecule MyD88 and IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family members, including IRAK1, IRAK2 and IRAK4 (Kawai and Akira, 2011). IRAK4 is the upstream kinase of IRAK1 and IRAK2 (Kim et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2010). IRAK1 is necessary for TAK1-dependent NFκB activation for the transcription of chemokines and cytokines (Cui et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2007). IRAK2 is an atypical kinase that mediates posttranscriptional regulation of inflammatory transcripts. Deletion of IRAK2 impairs the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages in response to TLR stimulation (Wan et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2011) without affecting transcription of inflammatory genes. However, the precise mechanism by which IRAK2 controls the posttranscriptional regulation of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production is an evolving area of investigation.\n\nHere, we report that LPS induces IRAK2 nuclear localization to facilitate nuclear export of a subset of inflammatory mRNAs (including Cxcl1, Tnf and Cxcl2) to the cytosol for protein translation. IRAK2 kinase activity is required for LPS-induced RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation, which facilitates IRAK2 nuclear translocation. By array analysis, we identified an SRSF1-binding motif enriched selectively in mRNA targets dependent on IRAK2 for nuclear export. IRAK2 phosphorylates SRSF1 and thereby reduces SRSF1 binding to the target mRNAs. On the other hand, SRSF1 knockdown resulted in increased nuclear export of the target mRNAs. Importantly, LPS induced the interaction of IRAK2 with the nuclear export factors ALYREF and Nxf1 recruiting them to the target mRNAs. While the depletion of SRSF1 allowed nuclear export adaptor ALYREF binding to the target mRNAs, LPS/IRAK2-induced recruitment of nuclear export receptor Nxf1 to the target transcripts was abolished by the knockdown of ALYREF. Thus, SRSF1-mediated nuclear sequestration of target mRNAs might be achieved by blocking the binding of ALYREF and Nxf1 to the mRNAs. Taken together, our results suggest that while SRSF1 binding renders target mRNAs sensitive for nuclear export, LPS promotes a nuclear function of IRAK2 that mediates the removal of SRSF1 and facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to export the inflammatory mRNAs to the cytosol for protein translation.\n\nWhile TLR-induced inflammatory gene expression is essential for host defense against infections of pathogens, dysregulated production of cytokines and chemokines is detrimental to the host, resulting in septic shock and other inflammatory diseases. Nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments enable spatial separation and regulation of transcription and translation. In this study, we report that LPS/TLR4 engagement activates a nuclear function of IRAK2 that facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to enable export the inflammatory mRNAs to the cytosol for protein translation. IRAK2 kinase activity is required for RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation and nuclear translocation. Array analysis identified an SRSF1-binding motif enriched in the mRNAs that are accumulated in the nucleus of IRAK2-deficient and IRAK2-kinase inactive macrophages. Nuclear IRAK2 then phosphorylates SRSF1 and reduces SRSF1 binding to the target mRNAs. At the same time, LPS induces interaction between IRAK2 and nuclear export adaptor ALYREF to replace SRSF1 on the target mRNAs. The recruited ALYREF in turn bridges the interaction between the mRNA targets and nuclear export receptor Nxf1, triggering nuclear export receptor Nxf1 loading for the export of the mRNAs. (Figure 7C) Therefore, LPS-induced IRAK2 activation provides a critical check point for the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by controlling the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of the LPS-induced transcripts.\n\nIRAK2 is known as an atypical kinase due to the amino acid substitution of key catalytic residues (Asp -> Asn333; Asp ->His351). Notably, atypical kinases such as KSR2 (Brennan et al., 2011) and CASK (Mukherjee et al., 2008) have been reported to carry catalytic activity. We found recombinant IRAK2 was able to autophophorylate and phosphorylate MBP and SRSF1; mutations in the ATP-binding site and catalytic residues impaired the function of IRAK2. IRAK2 kinase-inactive knockin mice showed substantially increased survival after LPS-induced septic shock compared to that of the wild-type mice. Likewise, LPS-induced serum CXCL1 and TNF levels were much reduced in IRAK2 kinase-inactive knockin mice compared to that of the wild-type mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the IRAK2 kinase activity is critical for the function of IRAK2 in LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response.\n\nWhile LPS-induced IRAK2 modification was previously reported, we now identified RanBP2 as the E3 ligase for IRAK2 sumoylation. We also for the first time report that LPS induces IRAK2 nuclear translocation, which seems to be dependent on LPS-induced IRAK2 sumoylation. IRAK2 mutants defective in sumoylation were retained in the cytoplasm. Likewise, LPS-induced IRAK2 nuclear translocation was abolished in RanBP2 knock-down cells, supporting the critical role of IRAK2 sumoylation for its nuclear translocation. Consistently, RanBP2 was shown to modulate cytoplasmic and nuclear transport of macromolecules. RanBP2 is a major nucleoporin that extends cytoplasmic filaments from the nuclear pore complex and contains phenylalanine–glycine repeats that bind the transport receptor importin-β. Indeed, IRAK2 was also shown to interact with importin-β, which requires the NLS on IRAK2. It is intriguing that although IRAK2 kinase inactive mutants still interact with importin-β, they were unable to interact with RanBP2 and failed to translocate into the nucleus. While these results suggest a potential impact of IRAK2 kinase activity on RanBP2, IRAK2 autophosphorylation may affect its interaction with RanBP2. Our data showed that mutations in putative IRAK2 phosphorylation sites S136/T140 (Weintz et al., 2010) substantially reduced the interaction of IRAK2 with RanBP2. It suggests that the activation of IRAK2 may result in auto-phosphorylation at S136A and T140A, which in turn mediates the interaction with RanBP2. Future studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanism for how phosphorylation of IRAK2 affects its interaction with RanBP2 and subsequent sumoylation.\n\nIn addressing the functional impact of LPS-induced IRAK2 nuclear translocation, we found that IRAK2 plays a critical role in promoting nuclear export of LPS-induced transcripts. By array analysis, a SRSF1-binding motif was found to be enriched in the mRNAs targets that are dependent on IRAK2 for nuclear export. As discussed above, recombinant IRAK2 was able to phosphorylate SRSF1 and LPS-activated IRAK2 can phosphorylate SRSF1 and thereby reduces SRSF1 binding to the target mRNAs in macrophages. These results suggest that SRSF1 binding endows target mRNAs with sensitivity for LPS to promote nuclear export, and that LPS induces nuclear function of IRAK2 to mediate the removal of SRSF1 from the target mRNAs. Importantly, Mass Spec analysis showed that IRAK2 also interacts with nuclear export adaptor ALYREF in addition to importin-β and RanBP2. Notably, ALYREF and SRSF1 actually belong to the same family of proteins called the shuttling SR (serine- and arginine-rich) proteins, sharing a similar RNA-binding domain. Indeed, we found SRSF1 and ALYREF were able to bind to the same SRSF1-binding motif; and the removal of SRSF1 allowed nuclear export adaptor ALYREF binding to the target mRNAs, suggesting that SRSF1-mediated nuclear sequestration of target mRNAs might be achieved by blocking the binding of ALYREF to the mRNAs. Importantly, previous studies have reported that ALYREF (a subunit of the so-called TREX complex for nuclear export) makes contact with nuclear export receptor Nxf1, serving as a bridge between mRNA and nuclear export receptor Nxf1. Thus, nuclear IRAK2 mediates the removal of SRSF1 and facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to export the inflammatory mRNAs to the cytosol for translation. Interestingly, about 10–30% LPS-induced inflammatory transcripts were exported out of the nucleus in the absence of IRAK2 (Figure 3B), which was consistent with the residual ALYREF’s binding to these transcripts in IRAK2-/- cells (Figure 4D). These results implicate that there might be yet another mechanism besides IRAK2 that allows ALYREF binding to the target mRNAs for nuclear export. Future studies are required to identify additional players that modulate TLR-induced nuclear/cytosol distribution of inflammatory transcripts."
