        "text": "Legend has it that there was no living in the world when Pangu (盘古), creator of the universe in Chinese mythology, separated the Sky from the Earth. Nüwa (女娲), a goddess in Chinese mythology, set about making man with clay, by shaping little figures after her image with her hands. Subsequently, the Water God, Gong Gong (共工), and the Fire God, Zhu Rong (祝融), fought a fierce battle, which made the world come to an end and brought disaster to the humanity. In order to save the common people, Nüwa collected colored stone from the Fen River (汾河), melted them to patch up the holes in the Sky. At the time of Nüwa mending the Sky, colorful stones in her hands fell in the world, and turned into crystal clear coloured glaze.\n\nThere is also another legend. In ancient times, when Lu Shen from Boshan sought longevity by alchemy, he found many bright and colorful crystals in the slag. He then offered them to the emperor, letting him to put the crystals inside the palace in order to live forever and eliminate the calamity and evil. All the civilian and military officers at court regarded these crystals as treasure, handing the story down from generation to generation. The production of colored glaze began since then."
