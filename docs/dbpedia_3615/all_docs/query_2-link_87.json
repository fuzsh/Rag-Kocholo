In the early 1990s the PLA Air Force built a large aircraft depot to accommodate these retired aircraft. China gathered over 1,000 fighters, transport planes, and bombers at Rugao Airbase in central China, which became the second largest aircraft storage facility in the world, ranking only after Davis-Monthan AFB in the United States.\n\nLocated at the Yangtze River entrance to sea, near Shanghai, Suzhow and Wuxi across the River, Rugao County was founded in the 7th year of the Yixi Era of China's East Jin Dynasty in the Fifth Century AD. With approval of hte State Council, Rugao city was founded in 1991. With an area of 1477 SQ.KM , a total population of 1.45 million and 14 towns and 36 townships under its jurisdiction, it is one of the China's coastal open cities. It has become one of China's 100 most advanced cities (or counties) in both science and technology. Rugao is well known for its diversified economy, including sericulture, pigs, goats and chicken raising, flowers and trees and potted landscapes.
