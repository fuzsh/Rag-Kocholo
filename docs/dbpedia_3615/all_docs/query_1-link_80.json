        "text": "This article explores the Bön phenomenon from a larger perspective, that of the Eurasian cultural and religious heritage, and tackles the following question: Tibetan Bön is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon but do its origins lie in the Tibetan Plateau as such? I shall attempt to answer this by looking at three areas: -Firstly, the prehistoric pan-Eurasian cult of the Sky Deer;-Secondly, the links between rock carvings in Gilgit and Bönpo mchod rten;-And finally, parallels between episodes in the Ṛgveda and the life story of Ston pa gshen rab.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to examine the oldest occurrences of the proper noun bod and to track its semantic development in Old Tibetan. The paper is an attempt to answer the questions: why and how did the local name bod came to be used as endonym for 'Tibet'? In addition, I put forward a new etymology for the name 'Tibet'?\n\nIn the brief note below we propose to explain the ethnic name mwt’yk in the Sogdian Nāfnāme (‘List of Nations’, Ch/So 20166, b7) as an adjective to mwt-, that stands for Tibetan Mdo, Maδū in Arabic sources, the name of the North-Eastern Tibet (modern Qinghai province of China). Alongside, we examine the elusive structure of the Nāfnāme, correct the reading cγ’ny ‘native of Chaghaniyān’ into βrγ’ny ‘native of Farghāna’, explain fakkūj ‘1000 Chinese copper coins’ in the account of Abū Zayd as derivation of Sogdian ptkwk ‘string containing 1000 coins’"
