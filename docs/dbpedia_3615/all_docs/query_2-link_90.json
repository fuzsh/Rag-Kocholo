        "text": "Summary\n\nWe have our own values regarding the policy on refugees. [O]ur policies are guided by geopolitical sensitivities.\n\n—Deputy prime minister and foreign minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, September 2012\n\nTibetans who have crossed the border illegally are not refugees.\n\n—A spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu, March 2012\n\nI thought I would be safe here. But now I realize China is telling Nepal what to do about us.\n\n—Tibetan refugee Dorje Tsering, Kathmandu, March 2013\n\nSince the 2008 Tibetan uprising, the largest, most widespread unrest among Tibetans in decades, the Chinese government has significantly tightened its control in Tibetan areas of China. It has also pressured Nepal, which shares a long border with China and is home to a sizeable Tibetan community, to become China’s partner in restricting Tibetans’ basic rights.\n\nNepal has signed several security and “intelligence-sharing” agreements with China since 2008; operationalized border security cooperation; partially enforced a ban on Tibetan public demonstrations; implemented close monitoring of the Tibetan community, its leaders, and real or perceived activists; and deployed intimidating numbers of Nepali armed police in Tibetan neighborhoods on politically sensitive dates, such as the anniversary of the Dalai Lama, International Human Rights Day (December 10), or high-level visits by Chinese dignitaries.\n\nThe consequences are being felt across the Tibetan community. Partly as a result of this pressure, Tibetans face excessive use of force by police, preventive detention, torture and ill-treatment when detained, intrusive surveillance, and arbitrary application of vaguely formulated and overly broad definitions of security offenses.\n\nChodak Namgyal, a former Tibetan monk in his twenties, arrived as a refugee in Nepal in January 2009. A former member of the Tongkor monastery in Amdo (Kardze prefecture, Sichuan province), he had spent several months in hiding following a clash in April 2008 in which Chinese security forces shot at a crowd of Tibetan protesters, killing up to a dozen people. Many monks and participants in the protest, fearing arrest, fled into the mountains, where they remained in hiding, living in harsh conditions for many months, to escape the large and sustained operation by the local Chinese authorities to capture fugitives, whose pictures were on wanted posters in the area. Relatives were monitored and pressured for information about their relatives.\n\nChodak and a companion decided to flee Tibet. They made their way to the border with Nepal, first hiding in the back of trucks and then continuing on foot, walking only at night. In January 2009, a Tibetan guide on the Chinese side near Dram (Ch. Zhangmu) took them overnight across the border. From there, they went to Kathmandu, travelling by motorbike and circumventing by foot numerous Nepali police checkpoints on the road. The two men took refuge in a Tibetan monastery in the Kathmandu valley for several weeks, before having to leave and hide in a Tibetan district in Kathmandu.\n\nI am very afraid that if I am arrested I will be sent back to China. The Chinese put my picture on the [wanted] posters in Kardze, and they always say that we are criminals. They don’t want anyone to tell the truth about the shootings so they will invent any pretext to arrest us. When I arrived here [in Nepal] I was so happy I had finally managed to escape Tibet. I thought I would be safe and I can finally openly pray for His Holiness [the Dalai Lama]. But now I can see Nepal is not safe for Tibetans. The police are there doing the surveillance and there are many informers. Even in the monasteries there are informers and this is why we had to leave the monastery that initially sheltered us.\n\nThe Tibetans here are always afraid. I have no document, not even a single piece of paper, and I don’t speak Nepali. If I am arrested I fear what can happen to me. Even once I joined the celebrations for His Holiness at the monastery here [in Boudhanath] the police came inside the courtyard with their weapons and tore down the banner with His Holiness’ portrait. I fear going to [public Tibetan] events but our brothers and sisters are in Tibet, so many have self-immolated, how could we remain silent? Every time the police arrest some people just for participating in peaceful prayers. The police take picture, I am sure it is for China. There are cameras everywhere around here [in Boudhanath] now. How can we have any guarantee about how these images are used? In Lhasa there are cameras everywhere, and now I fear that Boudhanath is going the same direction. For all we know, the Chinese police could be sitting in Lhasa watching us as we speak.\n\nDorje Lhundup, a 24-year-old Tibetan born in a settlement in Kathmandu, told Human Rights Watch he had been arrested multiple times in 2008 and 2009 because of his participation in Tibetan public events. Since then, the Nepali police have kept a close eye on him, often detaining him before high-level Chinese official visits or planned Tibetan public events.\n\nLast time I was arrested by the police the day before some Chinese official arrived to visit. The police came to my home and arrested me even though I had done nothing. At the police station, one policeman told me, “Oh, you are a real troublemaker, we are going to deport you to China, you know? It is very easy for us to send you back to China and no one will ever know.” I am born here, but I don't have any document. Thankfully, I can speak good Nepali. It’s like they just want Tibetans to disappear. But if we stopped protesting, would all problems be solved? If we Tibetans lose our voice it won’t be long before we disappear.\n\nChina has targeted Nepal because it has long been the first destination for Tibetans wanting to escape China, leave temporarily, or send their children outside the country. The long and often treacherous walk across the Himalayas into Nepal is the most direct way to reach Dharamsala, in northern India, where the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan government-in-exile, and 80,000 Tibetans are based.\n\nNepal’s Tibetan community of about 15,000-20,000 is made up of the relatives and descendants of an initial wave of refugees who arrived in Nepal following the Dalai Lama’s escape to India in 1959, and of periodic flows since then of new refugees and migrants coming from Tibet or returning from India.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1989, the Nepali government recognized and registered Tibetans crossing the border as refugees. In 1989, following a diplomatic rapprochement with China, the King of Nepal stopped allowing Tibetan refugees to settle permanently in Nepal. Under the terms of an informal, unwritten, “Gentleman’s Agreement” with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), however, Nepal continued to permit the “safe passage” of refugees from Tibet to India.\n\nFor several months during and after the 2008 protests in Tibet, Kathmandu became a focal point of pro-Tibetan political activity, with almost daily street demonstrations, gatherings, and political events. Under intense diplomatic pressure from China—some of it overt and public—the Nepali government curtailed Tibetan demonstrations, with the police often clashing with demonstrators or rounding up Tibetans they suspected of planning public action. International media, barred from Tibet itself, prominently featured these clashes. The suppression of Tibetan political activities in Nepal in 2008 was the subject of a report Human Rights Watch published in August of that year, titled “Appeasing China: Restricting the Rights of Tibetans in Nepal.”\n\nThis report analyzes conditions for Tibetans in Nepal five years later. Restrictions on Tibetans’ rights in Nepal and on the Nepal-China border have grown much more stringent since 2008. While Nepal has maintained some basic protections for Tibetans, it has restricted their freedom of assembly and expression and engaged in arbitrary arrest and detention of protesters or those believed to be planning protests. The government has also made it harder for Tibetans to obtain documentation that would allow them to go to school, seek employment, run businesses, or engage in other activities.\n\nThe political repression has been explicit. In March 2009, in an interview in a Chinese newspaper (the English language translation is presented for the first time in this report, see Appendix II), Nepal deputy inspector general of police Bharat Bahadur G.C. spoke of Nepal’s intensifying crackdown on Tibetan political speech. As he explained it, the orders came from the highest levels:\n\nNepal Prime Minister Khil Raj Regmi and Deputy Prime Minister/Minister for Home Affairs Krishna Bahadur Mahara gave [the] order to crackdown on all “Tibetan Independence” activities in Nepal. Prime Minister Khil Raj Regmi said that Nepal and China enjoy a strong friendship, so the Nepali government will not allow any “Tibetan Independence” activities on its soil. Deputy Prime Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara personally called me and asked me to combat “Tibetan Independence” activities at all cost, with no reservation and no mercy. The police see the leadership’s determination as reassurance to act on this issue…\n\nIn the same interview, Bharat Bahadur G.C. boasted of Nepal’s sharp increase in surveillance of Tibetans and declared that, following the 2008 uprising in Tibet, “combating ‘Tibetan Independence’ is my main task.”\n\nChinese Pressure on Nepal\n\nIt is no surprise that China would pressure Nepal to push back Tibetans or to crackdown on their political activities in Nepal. Beijing continues to assert that the 14th Dalai Lama and supporters of the Tibetan cause in exile or abroad play a major role in seeding discontent among ethnic Tibetans in China. It also continues to see this purported negative influence as a substantial hurdle to inculcating the kind of undivided political loyalty to the Communist Party and the state that it would like to see among Tibetans in China. For these reasons, measures to limit foreign and cross-border influence have featured prominently in the policies that Beijing has meticulously deployed since the 2008 protests.\n\nThese policies have included militarily sealing off Tibet’s international borders to end the constant trickle of Tibetans fleeing the region. The approach seems to be working: the number of Tibetans crossing the border has dropped from an average of 2,200 per year before the 2008 protests, to under a thousand between 2009 and 2012, to 171 in 2013. The available evidence suggests that Tibetans detained by Chinese authorities for crossing the border irregularly from Nepal are routinely imprisoned and physically abused in China.\n\nChinese authorities have confiscated the passports of many Tibetans and require that all Tibetans submit to pre- and post-trip debriefings with police as a condition of international travel. They maintain registers of Tibetans who have family members abroad. Tibetans within Tibet must now also endure rigorous scrutiny before obtaining domestic travel permits. In recent years Tibetans have been arrested and sentenced for passing, receiving, or simply consuming information critical of China’s policies in Tibet.\n\nThere is now substantial evidence of increased Chinese government monitoring and censoring of telecommunications, Internet activity and messaging, and increased limitations on access to foreign Tibetan language broadcasts through the jamming and confiscation of satellite reception dishes. Chinese authorities have also stepped up efforts to prevent Tibetan communities in neighboring countries from assisting, documenting, or protesting conditions in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and adjoining provinces with significant Tibetan populations. As detailed below, China frequently imprisons, and tortures or otherwise mistreats Tibetans who leave China without permission.\n\nOfficial Chinese government reports and testimonies of Nepali officials suggest that, in line with China’s general strategy to suppress the influence of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan exile community inside China and to combat or minimize international pressure, Beijing has had three primary objectives with respect to Nepal:\n\nEnsuring Nepal’s effective cooperation with China’s efforts to put an end to clandestine border-crossing by Tibetan asylum seekers and migrants, including children sent to study in Tibetan schools in India by their families;\n\nEnforcing a de-facto ban on pro-Tibetan political mobilization in Nepal, including demonstrations and all activities linked to the Dalai Lama or Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan government-in-exile);\n\nEnrolling Nepal’s intelligence and law-enforcement apparatus to monitor and infiltrate Tibetan communities living in Nepal, as to provide up-to-the-minute intelligence for China.\n\nBeijing seems to have recognized early on that the Nepali state did not have the capacity or resources to carry out the significant expansion of the security sector that Beijing had in mind. It also recognized that Nepal had no strong national interest in curbing the activities of a community that has lived peacefully and played an important role in the tourism and export economy in Nepal for many decades, and whose well-being has been a consistent concern of representatives in Nepal of the United States and of a number of European countries.\n\nChina’s decision to significantly scale up its economic and diplomatic engagement with Nepal after 2008—which culminated with then-premier Wen Jiabao’s state visit in January 2012 and with China becoming one of the top foreign direct investors in the country—was in part aimed at influencing Nepal’s calculations about where its national interests lie. This strategy appears to have been at least partially effective.\n\nThe Chinese authorities have kept some Tibetans, apparently on an ad hoc basis, from returning to China. Since January 2013, more than 20 ethnic Tibetan citizens of China seeking to return to China, all carrying valid PRC documents, have been refused re-entry by Chinese officials and forced to remain in Nepali territory. The reasons are not entirely clear, but it appears to be an effort by China to discourage surreptitious visits to Dharamsala by Tibetans from China.\n\nYet in recent years Chinese officials have become more aggressive on Tibetan issues in Nepal. In 2008 the Chinese embassy attempted to influence a decision by the Nepali Supreme Court regarding the registration in Nepal of the Tibetan Welfare Office, the de facto representative office of the Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA). The effort succeeded, even though an unofficial office has continued to operate in the same location.\n\nNepal and China have a longstanding agreement “not to allow their territories to be used to carry out activities against the other,” a commitment regularly reiterated in diplomatic statements. Nepal’s adherence to the “One-China policy” and its resistance to “allowing its territory to be used for activities against China” are reaffirmed at every meeting between China and Nepal. Yet Chinese expectations of Nepal have grown. Nepal now commits to “not allowing its territory to be used by any force to carry out ‘anti-China’ activities” and to “crack down on anti-China activities.”\n\nSince 2009, China’s foreign policy has made increasing reference to demands for the respect of its “core interests,” which remain ill-defined but are widely understood to include Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. In January 2012, former Nepali Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) announced during a state visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that:\n\nNepal attaches great importance to China's core interests, firmly adheres to the One-China policy and deems Taiwan and Tibet as an integral part of China. The Nepali government will never allow any anti-China activities on its territory.\n\nMuch of China’s pressure remains invisible. According to a former government chief secretary interviewed by Human Rights Watch, Nepal is not in a position to resist these demands:\n\nThe level of pressure from China is great, and often not seen. This kind of pressure is not seen openly but this is how it is happening. Over the years I have seen how a low-level Chinese person has high-level access on the Nepali side. It’s completely unequal. Nepal has no capacity to fight back against this pressure. The US is the only international actor who speaks up on the issue.\n\nThe Gentleman’s Agreement\n\nThe “Gentleman’s Agreement” was established between Nepal and UNHCR guaranteeing the “safe passage” of refugees from Tibet to India. The agreement states that Tibetan refugees apprehended by the Nepali authorities be handed over to UNHCR for processing and transit to Dharamsala. China rejects the categorization of Tibetans who have fled Tibet as “refugees.”\n\nWhen we began this research, many refugee experts and analysts said they believed the Gentleman’s Agreement was working well for all Tibetans in Nepal. The agreement appears to be working well for Tibetans apprehended far inside the territory of Nepal, but less well and much more erratically for those apprehended at or near the border.\n\nOur research suggests that border police forces have forcibly returned to China Tibetans intercepted at the border or before they reach inhabited areas. A former senior Nepali Home Ministry official told Human Rights Watch that local border police have pushed back or repatriated Tibetans found at or near the border if the Armed Police Force determined that they were not “legitimate refugees,” although no formal process was undertaken to make such a determination. . A senior official from the Department of Immigration also told Human Rights Watch that while he was working along the border Tibetans were forced back. Tibetans interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had crossed the border from Tibet clandestinely at Kodari said that they had to reach Kathmandu without being caught by Nepali police otherwise they would be handed back to China.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch is not able to corroborate these admissions, we believe they are credible and require further investigation, not least because any persons forced back face a high risk of torture or ill-treatment upon return to China. Nepal bars UNHCR staff from visiting border areas to monitor the situation directly. The number of refugees from Tibet registered by UNHCR fell to an unprecedented low of 171 individuals in 2013, compared to an annual average between 1991 and 2008 of more than 2,200.\n\nThe multiplication of police and administrative controls on individuals and businesses has made Tibetans increasingly vulnerable to arbitrary fines and petty corruption. Obstacles to education, housing, movement, employment, and public and private services (such as renewal of driver’s licenses, bank services, and various administrative registration requirements) have become more severe as Nepali government perceptions of Tibetans as an irritant in relations with China have increased. Tibetans say that this perception is also frequently shared among a growing number of Nepali due to the negative reporting in the local media.\n\nWhile many such issues are not new, they were often mitigated before 2008 by flexible responses from local authorities, in particular the central district officers (CDOs), the highest civil servant in each of the country’s 75 districts. Tibetans interviewed for this report told us that such local government officials are far less willing today to consider requests from Tibetan community leaders.\n\nSince 2008, Nepali government officials have justified their increasingly restrictive policies toward Tibetan refugees citing “geopolitical sensitivities,” Nepal’s official adherence to the “One-China principle,” and what they present as the corollary duty of not allowing “Nepali soil to be used for anti-China activities.”\n\nThere is no legal basis for these policies. The term “anti-China activities” has no meaning or force in Nepali law. Any policies or practices specifically targeting Tibetan political speech are clearly discriminatory and violate international law. To the extent that Nepal prohibits peaceful political protests by all noncitizens, it also violates well-established international human rights law: Nepal is bound to guarantee freedom of speech and assembly for all residents; any restrictions must be set out in domestic law and not restrict peaceful exercise of political speech. For the Nepali government to use China’s opinion as the basis for determining whether a specific activity is or not “anti-China” is a short step from accepting that any Tibetan criticism of China, as well as any promotion of Tibetan identity, ought to be suppressed.\n\nThe increased surveillance and monitoring of Tibetan communities in Nepal facilitates discrimination against them, and makes them more vulnerable to police and criminal justice system abuse whether or not they are politically active. A member of a leading local human rights NGO told Human Rights Watch that, “the treatment of Tibetans is having a corrosive effect on the entire Nepali judicial system …it conveys the perception that some categories of people can be excluded from the protection of the law. Today, it’s the Tibetans, but tomorrow, who will it be? The law should apply equally to all, without exceptions.”\n\nThe government’s emphasis on taking China’s political sensitivities into account in handling Tibetan issues has increasingly affected Nepal’s civil society and media. A leading human rights NGO executive told Human Rights Watch that working on Tibetan issues is “too sensitive and risks jeopardizing work on other, more mainstream issues.” A newspaper editor acknowledged that self-censorship across major newspapers means that “controversial” issues such as Tibet and China’s human rights record are sidestepped. Nongovernmental organizations that have continued to monitor the human rights situation of the Tibetan community, such as Human Rights Organization of Nepal (HURON), have been subjected to pressures and accused of disloyalty towards the state.\n\nNepal is an important haven for many Tibetans. As the political crisis in Tibet continues and deepens, Nepali government policies and practices toward them become ever more critical in protecting them, and serve as a barometer of how influential the Chinese government is in pressuring its neighbors to join it in violating the free expression and other rights of Tibetans. The findings of this report suggest China’s influence is sharply rising and, as a result, the situation of Tibetans is ever more precarious.\n\nKey Recommendations\n\nTo the Government of Nepal\n\nImmediately stop forcibly returning Tibetans to China unless their right to seek asylum is protected, including those rejected at the border or apprehended in Nepal.\n\nStrictly uphold and respect international law prohibiting refoulement.\n\nImmediately provide all eligible Tibetans with refugee identification certificates (RCs);\n\nIssue RCs, as appropriate, to Tibetans who fled to Nepal after 1989 and are unable or unwilling to go to India to lodge asylum claims.\n\nEase renewal modalities and issue refugee certificates to eligible Tibetans as well as to their dependents (spouse and children).\n\nProtect the rights of all persons in Nepal, including Tibetans, to freedom of expression and assembly, regardless of legal status, and cease dispersing peaceful protests by Tibetans.\n\nRepeal restrictions on the rights of Tibetan residents to own property, work, establish and incorporate businesses, and travel freely.\n\nTo the Government of China\n\nImmediately end the torture and other ill-treatment of Tibetans arrested for having crossed or attempting to cross the border without proper documentation.\n\nProvide passports and end restrictions on Tibetans who wish to leave the country.\n\nAllow re-entry to all Tibetans who are Chinese citizens.\n\nEnd pressure on the government of Nepal or individual Nepali officials to engage in policies or take measures that are in contradiction with international human rights and refugee law.\n\nMethodology\n\nHuman Rights Watch conducted research for this report in Nepal from November 2012 to October 2013. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews with Tibetans in Nepal. Human Rights Watch also visited four refugee settlements located in Kathmandu and Pokhara, and spoke with Tibetans at the border crossing in Kodari, Sindhulpalchok District.\n\nIn addition, we spoke by phone and in person with dozens of Nepali officials, foreign diplomats in Nepal, UN agency representatives, and members of NGOs with firsthand information about the issues covered in this report.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also wrote to the Nepali government inviting it to respond to our finding. As of this writing, we had received no response (a copy of the letter is included as an appendix to this report).\n\nWe conducted interviews primarily in English and in Tibetan with English interpretation. In a few cases, we conducted interviews in English. In both the body of the report and in footnotes, we have generalized locations of interviews in Nepal to the district level so that those interviewed and their families cannot be easily identified. We have used pseudonyms or initials for all Tibetans named in this report unless otherwise indicated. In some cases other identifying information has been withheld in the interest of confidentiality and security.\n\nWhenever possible, and in a majority of cases, interviews were conducted on a one-on-one basis. All those interviewed were informed of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways in which the information would be used. All interviewees were told they could decline to answer questions or end the interview at any time. All provided oral consent to be interviewed. None received compensation.\n\nIn addition to the interviews described above, we drew on a number of secondary sources, including Chinese official and media sources, United Nations reports, academic studies and other publications, previous Human Rights Watch reporting, and other nongovernmental organization reports.\n\nIn this report, the term “Tibet” refers to the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and the Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures (TAP) of the adjoining provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan.\n\nI. Tibetans in Nepal\n\nApproximately 13,000 Tibetans live in Nepal, according to a 2009 census published by the Tibetan Central Administration (the Tibetan government-in-exile, based in Dharamsala.)[1] The majority of Tibetans live in the Kathmandu valley, in the Boudhanath and Sayambunath districts of the city, and in the Jawalakhel settlement. The second largest community is found in and around Pokhara. A few thousand live in isolated settlements such as in Namgyaling, Mustang, and Gyalsa, close to the border with China.\n\nRecent information suggests that fewer than 25% of Tibetans recorded in the settlements hold valid Refugee Certificates (RCs), Nepali identity documents that the government at one time issued to Tibetan refugees and their descendants. The government stopped accepting new Tibetan refugees and therefore issuing RCs after December 31, 1989, following a diplomatic rapprochement with China. Until the mid-1990s, it continued to issue RCs to children born in Nepal to Tibetan parents holding RCs once they turned 16. From 1994 to 1998, it gradually stopped issuing RCs altogether—even for children born before the 1990 cut-off date.[3]\n\nA RC serves as an official identity document and grants its holder the right to reside and travel in Nepal (with the exception of some areas). It does not, however, entitle its owner to a wide range of rights, including property ownership, employment, higher education, and travel abroad.\n\nSome Tibetans have other status. Some hold full Nepali citizenship, acquired either through naturalization or as a result of marriage to a male Nepali citizen; some grew up in India, moved to Nepal for family reasons or employment, but retain Indian identity papers; some still hold the nationality or passport of another country and are legal foreign residents.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2007, over 40,000 Tibetans successfully transited through Nepal to India under the terms of the informal Gentleman’s Agreement between Nepal and UNHCR, an average of 2,200 per year. From 2008 to 2012, the average number fell to about 650 per year. In 2013, following significant strengthening of security on the Chinese side of the border and introduction of strenuous restrictions on movement within Tibet, the number fell to 171 only.[4]\n\nNepal’s International Legal Obligations\n\nWhile Nepal is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol, it is a party to other treaties, including the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment (CAT), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)[5]. These treaties establish the obligation to respect the principle of nonrefoulement, which holds that refugees should not be forcibly returned to a place where their lives or freedom would be threatened, and that no person should be returned to a place where he or she would be subjected to torture or to cruel or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nArticle 3 of CAT forbids the return or expulsion of any persons to states where they would be in danger of being tortured. Article 7.1 of the ICCPR forbids subjecting anyone to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, in Comment 20 (1992), has emphasized that states “must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of punishment upon return to any country by way of their extradition, expulsion or refoulement.” [6]\n\nArticle 2.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires Nepal as a state party to ensure rights to “all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction.” The UN Human Rights Committee, in its General Comment No.15 on the ICCPR, has unambiguously stated that aliens “have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the right to hold opinions and to express them. Aliens receive the benefit of the right of peaceful assembly and of freedom of association.” Nepal is therefore clearly obligated to uphold the right of Tibetans in Nepal, regardless of their status, to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, even if the Interim Constitution only extends these rights to citizens.\n\nUNHCR’s Executive Committee adopted Conclusion 25 in 1982, which declared that “the principle of nonrefoulement…was progressively acquiring the character of a peremptory rule of international law.”[7] The UN General Assembly reinforced the international consensus that the nonrefoulement obligation adheres to all states, not just parties to the Refugee Convention, when it adopted Resolution 51/75 on August 12, 1997, which:\n\n[C]alls upon all States to uphold asylum as an indispensable instrument for international protection of refugees and to respect scrupulously the fundamental principle of nonrefoulement, which is not subject to derogation. [8]\n\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Refugee Convention in 2001, the Declaration of States Parties to the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees acknowledged “the continuing relevance and resilience of this international regime of rights and principles, including at its core the principle of nonrefoulement, whose applicability is embedded in customary international law.”[9] Later that year, the UN General Assembly welcomed the Declaration.\n\nThe principle of nonrefoulement as a customary norm of international law applies not only to refugees within the territory of a state, but also to rejection of asylum seekers at the frontiers. In its October 2004 meeting, UNHCR’s Executive Committee issued Conclusion 99, which calls on States to ensure “full respect for the fundamental principle of nonrefoulement, including non-rejection at frontiers without access to fair and effective procedures for determining status and protection needs.”[10]\n\nFears that Tibetans forcibly returned to China would face persecution are well established. Severe, longstanding human rights violations by the Chinese state against Tibetans—ranging from sharp statutory restrictions on basic rights and freedoms, to religious persecution against the clergy and laity, socio-economic and political discrimination, political prosecutions and torture, and mistreatment of prisoners—have been authoritatively documented over the years, including by inter-governmental bodies such as the United Nations.[11]\n\nIn recent years Human Rights Watch has documented severe and systematic human rights abuses in Tibet, including religious repression, torture, disappearances, politically motivated trials, disproportionate use of force by security forces, and large-scale involuntary rehousing and relocation campaigns.[12]\n\nIn view of the above, Human Rights Watch believes that Tibetans who flee or have fled China without permission, as well as those fitting the profiles previously described, would be at high risk of persecution if forcibly returned to China. They should be granted full refugee status and protection.[13]\n\nII. The “Gentleman’s Agreement”\n\nThe Gentleman’s Agreement, an informal agreement between the government of Nepal and UNHCR, has been critical in ensuring the safe passage of Tibetans seeking to escape from China and/or reach India.[14] It serves the following objectives:\n\nEnsuring access to the territory of Nepal for Tibetans seeking to reach India;\n\nEnsuring respect for the prohibition against forced returns (refoulement), including at the Nepal-China border itself;\n\nEnsuring that Tibetans are neither detained nor penalized on immigration grounds for “unlawful entry”;\n\nEnsuring that the Nepali government will provide exit permits to newly arrived Tibetan asylum seekers verified by UNHCR to allow their prompt, unhindered departure to India.\n\nUnder the Gentleman’s Agreement, Tibetans who are apprehended are first detained by the police and then turned over to the Department of Immigration (DoI). Police bring the Tibetans to the DoI in Kathmandu, for which the UNHCR, via the DoI, pays the police a stipend to defray their costs, since bringing Tibetans from remote areas can take several days. The DoI then contacts UNHCR, which helps ensure their transfer to the Tibetan Reception and Transit Centre (TRTC), where they receive food, shelter, accommodation, and medical attention. The TRTC is supported by UNHCR and other international donors, including the United States.\n\nA summary interview is conducted with the Tibetans at the Center to determine that they are Tibetan refugees. The interviews are conducted by TRTC staff with oversight from UNHCR. The interviews explore the reasons of the Tibetans new arrivals for leaving Tibet and immediate plans in India.\n\nTibetans then applies to the Indian Embassy for an entry permit to India and once the Special Entry permit has been issued UNHCR sends a request to DoI for exit permits to be issued.\n\nThe DoI exit permits only provide Tibetans with the right to travel from the TRTC to the Indian border. The TRTC generally waits until it has a sufficient number of Tibetans to charter a bus, and then takes them to the Indian border at Sonauli. On the day of departure, the DoI dispatches officers to verify the identity of all those who have been issued exit permits.\n\nSince 1990, the Nepali authorities have generally upheld the Gentleman’s Agreement for Tibetans who have managed to make their presence on Nepali soil known to parties concerned with the fate of Tibetan refugees (members of the Tibetan community, NGOs, UNHCR staff, and others), or whose arrest by Nepali security forces was witnessed by third parties who could report an eventual forced return. The Agreement is still key to protect Tibetans fleeing China or arriving in Nepal, and wanting to go to India.\n\nHowever, since the early2000s, and even more so since 2008, Nepali authorities have increased their pressure on Tibetans. Intimidation is common, with many incidents in which local police order but do not force Tibetans to return to China; well-founded concerns that the Department of Immigration is sharing details on who is transiting through Nepal with Chinese authorities.\n\nIt has also become more difficult for Tibetans to reach Nepal. China has devoted significant efforts and resources since 2008 to seal off its border with Nepal by imposing a much tighter system of internal travel permits on Tibetans. It has stationed border defense posts of the People’s Armed Police at critical locations, including in mountain passes previously used as routes to clandestinely reach Nepal. Plainclothes Chinese security agents have been seen several kilometers inside Nepal territory, especially at the main border point of Kodari. Cooperation between Nepal’s Armed Police Force, which patrols the border, and the Chinese Public Security Bureau has deepened significantly. The result has been a dramatic decrease in the number of Tibetans who manage to reach Nepal territory. From an average of two to three thousand per year before 2008, the numbers fell to 600 in 2008, less than 1,000 annually between 2008 and 2011, and 171 in 2013.[15]\n\nIII. Nepal’s Justifications for Imposing Restrictions on Tibetans\n\nNepal does not deny that it prevents Tibetans from exercising the right to peaceful expression and assembly, and instead gives three reasons for its prohibitions on “political activities”: that the constitutional protection for freedom of expression and assembly applies only to citizens; that Nepal has no legal obligations towards Tibetan refugees, especially since it is not a party to the Refugee Convention; and that Nepal’s foreign policy commitments to China supersede its legal obligations.[16]\n\nNepal’s Interim Constitution guarantees “(a) freedom of opinion and expression; (b) freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms… [and] (e) freedom to move and reside in any part of Nepal,” but limits the protections to “citizens.”[17] The government has at times openly argued that it is justified in denying the enjoyment of these basic rights to Tibetans, who are not recognized as Nepali citizens.\n\nNepal’s international legal commitments forbid this.[18] The ICCPR recognizes that, in certain circumstances, temporary restrictions and limitations on the exercise of rights such as freedom of assembly may be justified. Article 4 of the ICCPR allows states to ““derogate”” from some of the standards in times of “public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed.”[19] Such measures must be necessary and “strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.”[20] But to date, the Nepali government has never claimed that Tibetan protests constituted a public emergency, and it is highly unlikely that independent courts would accept that peaceful protests meet this test.\n\nThe Nepali government also justifies its approach to Tibetan protests and public gatherings by citing its commitment to the “One-China principle” and its pledge that it will “not to allow its territory to serve for organizing activities against a neighbor.”[21]\n\nIn a typical statement issued in June 2011, then-Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara said that “Nepal does not have policy to allow any activities against its neighbors. We are aware about Free Tibet activities. We won't let such activities take place in Nepali soil.”[22]The standard public statement by Nepali officials on the Tibet issue is that “Nepal respects the One-China policy[23] and will not allow Nepali territory to be used against China.”[24]This justification is routinely invoked by law enforcement officials in their dealings with Tibetans to justify prohibiting planned gatherings, restrictions on movement, summonses for questioning, and detentions.\n\nNepal may make such declarations as statements of foreign policy, but they do not trump Nepali law, or Nepal’s international legal obligations. The term “anti-China activities” has no meaning or force in Nepali law. Since speech or actions that are critical of the Chinese government or its policies are not formally prohibited under Nepali law, the standard protections provided for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly apply: Nepal is bound to guarantee freedom of speech and assembly under international human rights law, which means any restrictions must be set out in domestic law and not restrict peaceful political speech.\n\nLong-standing diplomatic pledges that Nepal “will not allow its territory to be used against China” are also routinely invoked to justify the prohibition on a wide range of Tibetan activities. In one of the most expansive iteration of this pledge, the January 2012 Joint Declaration issued at the outcome of the visit of then Premier Wen Jiabao to Nepal stated:\n\nThe Nepali side firmly supports the efforts made by the Chinese side to uphold state sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity, and does not allow any forces to use Nepali territory for any anti-China or separatist activities.[25]\n\nThe term “separatist activities” is how China characterizes political mobilization in favor of the independence or autonomy of any part of the PRC (it also applies to advocacy on behalf of Taiwanese independence). It is broadly construed as any attitude that goes against the Communist Party’s doctrine of “ethnic unity” (minzu tuanjie, or “unity between the nationalities,”), which stipulates, “the Han and the minority nationalities are inseparable.” “Separatism” and “incitement to separatism” are explicit crimes under Chinese law.\n\nAs a result, China criminalizes and suppresses many forms of speech or assembly that are clearly protected under international law provisions guaranteeing freedom of expression and assembly. Beijing also accuses the Dalai Lama, and other exile organizations of promoting “separatism.” By extension, it considers the activities of the “Dalai Clique” as separatist in nature, hence China’s opposition to foreign political leaders and institutions meeting with the Dalai Lama or the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\nNepal’s frequent use of the term “anti-China” and the new inclusion of the term “separatist activities” in the 2012 Joint Statement are especially problematic because they legitimize the replacement of a legal test—whether or not an activity is legal—with a political one—whether the content offends, or is likely to offend, China’s sensitivities. It is also a short step from accepting that any Tibetan criticism of China, or promotion of the distinctiveness of Tibetan culture, ought to be suppressed.\n\nUnder Nepali law, “anti-China” sentiment or activity, “separatism,” and “separatist activities” are not criminal offenses. It is immaterial under Nepali law whether the content of speech is believed to be “anti-China” or “separatist.”\n\nIV. China’s Role\n\nTibet-related matters remain China’s top concern in Nepal.[26] Beijing sees the presence of a large Tibetan community, the ties they maintain with Tibetans in China, and the fact that the long border along the Himalayas can still be crossed clandestinely as critical factors that must be addressed to prevent challenges to its rule in Tibet.[27]\n\nSince 2008, the Chinese government has redoubled its efforts to sever the links between Tibetans living in China and the Tibetan diaspora, in particular the Dalai Lama, so as to limit the diaspora’s perceived influence and conceal the extent of human rights violations that take place in Tibet.[28]\n\nChina’s Top Priority in Nepal: Tibet\n\nEnlisting Nepali authorities’ cooperation in Tibetan matters has long been the key objective of China’s diplomacy and engagement in Nepal. Beijing’s clarity on this matter is plain even in the public remarks of its Nepali interlocutors: after meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing in April 2013, Pushpa Kama Dahal, leader of the main Maoist party and former prime minister of Nepal, acknowledged that “[The Chinese government’s] major concern was security in Tibet.”[29]\n\nSimilarly, after a July 2012 Ministry-level meeting in Beijing, a member of the Nepali delegation told the Nepali daily Republica that, “More than anything else, the Chinese seemed wary about the anti-China activities of Tibetan refugees living in Nepal.”[30]\n\nThey demanded that Nepal punish the Tibetans illegally entering into Nepali territory as per the law of the land, instead of handing them over to the UN refugee agency.[31]\n\nIn March 2012, the spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu told Chinese journalists that “Tibetans who have crossed the border illegally are not refugees.”[32]China has on occasion requested the return of Tibetan refugees already in Nepali custody, and the involvement of the UNHCR has often been the only safeguard that prevented Nepal from doing so.[33]\n\nThe selection of diplomatic personnel for the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu may also reflect Beijing’s priorities in the country: Wu Chuntai, the new ambassador installed in 2013, was previously the deputy-head of the Department of External Security Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose role is to study “external security issues” that affect China. The Department is currently headed by a previous ambassador to Nepal, Qiu Guohong.[34] Wu’s previous postings include a seven-year stint in Turkey, home to the largest refugee community from Xinjiang, China’s other restive ethnic area.[35]\n\nChinese Aid and Investment\n\nChina is an increasingly important economic and diplomatic partner of Nepal. As a small and impoverished country landlocked between India and China, Nepal sees in its expanding relationship with China an opportunity for much-needed economic development, foreign direct investment, and aid, as well as a way to balance its traditional dependence on India.[36]\n\nChina’s aid has steadily risen since 2008, most of it in the form of soft loans. The three most important aid packages—each including a security component—were announced in a rapid succession of high-level Chinese visits between March 2011 and January 2012:\n\nIn March 2011, General Chen Bingde, chief of general staff of China's People's Liberation Army, signed a military aid package worth US$19 million during his visit to Kathmandu.[37]\n\nIn August 2011, China’s domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang, accompanied by a 60-member delegation, pledged loans and aid worth US$50 million, including a US$24 million soft loan for a hydropower transmission line project.[38]\n\nIn January 2012, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced that China would offer 750 million RMB (US$113 million) in aid to Nepal as well as a US$20 million one-time special grant. He also pledged to provide a three-year, 750 million RMB grant to assist with economic and technical cooperation.[39]\n\nThe Chinese government also provides 3 million Nepali rupees (US$42,500) to each of the 14 districts in Nepal bordering China for the development of their Village Development Committees (VDCs), the local administrative structure.[40]\n\nNepal’s Commitments to China\n\nNepal and China have a long-standing agreement “not to allow their territories to be used to carry out activities against the other,”[44] a commitment regularly reiterated in diplomatic statements. Nepal’s adherence to the “One-China policy” and its resistance to “allowing its territory to be used for activities against China” are reaffirmed at every meeting between China and Nepal.[45]\n\nChinese expectations of Nepal have grown, as the shift in rhetoric shows. Nepal now commits to “not allowing its territory to be used by any force to carry out ‘anti-China’ activities,”[46] and, even more directly, commits to “crack down on anti-China activities.”[47] Since 2009, China’s foreign policy has made increasing reference to demands for the respect of its “core interests,” which remain ill-defined but are widely understood to include Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang.[48] In January 2012, Nepali Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai announced during a state visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that:\n\nNepal attaches great importance to China's core interests, firmly adheres to the one-China policy and deems Taiwan and Tibet as an integral part of China. The Nepali government will never allow any anti-China activities on its territory.[49]\n\nMuch of China’s pressure remains invisible. According to a former government chief secretary, Nepal is not in a position to resist these demands:\n\nThe level of pressure from China is great, and often not seen. This kind of pressure is not seen openly but this is how it is happening. Over the years I have seen how a low level Chinese person has high-level access on the Nepali side. It’s completely unequal. Nepal has no capacity to fight back against this pressure. The US is the only international actor who speaks up on the issue.[50]\n\nSecurity Cooperation: “A Handshake over the Himalaya”\n\nReflecting China’s foremost concern in Nepal, security cooperation has grown hand-in-hand with the development of economic ties and the scaling up of aid and investment. Shortly after the 2008 protests, the Chinese government submitted a comprehensive security agreement to Kathmandu. But political instability in Nepal delayed its adoption until August 2011, when it was reportedly signed on the occasion of the visit by China’s domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang, mentioned above.\n\nVarious other agreements have been put in place over the years, covering “intelligence-sharing,” “Illegal immigration” (which is how China terms Tibetans seeking refuge in across the border), deployment of additional Nepali Armed Police Forces (APF) at the border, and training of Nepali police forces:\n\nIn July 2009, Nepal’s Home Ministry announced it had agreed to set up new border security bases along the Chinese border to “curb illegal activities” at Tatopani, (Sindhupalchok district), Lomanthang (Mustang), Kimathanka (Sankhuwasabha), Limi (Humla), and Tinker (Darchula). Each of the new border security bases is or will be staffed by an Armed Police Force (APF) squad under the command of a superintendent of police.[51]\n\nIn August 2010, Nepal and China reached a 13-point agreement to establish a “high-level mechanism to share intelligence and information on security matters to contain anti-China activities in Nepal.” [52] A senior government official cited by the Kathmandu Post reported that China had assured Nepal of its “full support to enhance capacity building,” “train Nepali security personnel to be deployed across the northern border,” and “seek Nepal’s full commitment on information sharing on anti-China activities with effective law enforcement mechanism to contain such activities.” [53]\n\nIn November 2010, China held a two-week security training in Beijing for Nepali security officials, including officers from Nepal Police and Armed Police Force (APF) stationed in Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk, Dolakha, Mustang, and Solukhumbhu as well as the Chief District Officers of Hanumandhoka, Kaski, and Dolpa. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Home Affairs said that training was “part of regular cooperation to bolster the country’s immigration system.”[54]\n\nIn November 2010, Nepal and China convened a security meeting of senior district officials in Chautara, near the border. The local Chief District Administrative Officer disclosed that “the two sides had agreed to tighten the entry of Tibetan nationals into Nepal and systematize the distribution of temporary entry cares as part of the 13-point agreement reached between the two sides.”[55]\n\nIn December 2010, a six-member delegation headed by the Chinese director of the Public Security Department of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) visited Nepal, and offered to assist Nepal’s security forces being deployed along the Nepal-China border, stressing “the need to control illegal immigrants from both sides.”[56] The delegation met with the Minister of Home Affairs, as well as chiefs of the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force, and the National Investigation Department. The delegation from the TAR offered to provide half a million yuan (US$80,000) to Nepali security agencies for logistic support. A Nepali official told the press that the Chinese delegation had “raised the issues of illegal drug trafficking and human trafficking across the border.”[57]\n\nIn March 2011, General Chen Bingde, head of the Chinese military, conducted a three-day visit to Nepal during which he signed a military aid package worth US$19 million.[58]\n\nFrom June 30 to July 14, 2011, China held a “high-level” training for Nepal security officials in Beijing, organized by the Ministry of Public Security’s own university. According the website of the Ministry of Public Security, the training focused on “striking illegal border exit-entry activities.”[59]\n\nIn August 2011, as noted, Nepal and China reportedly signed the comprehensive security agreement during the three-day visit of China’s domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang. The agreement covers border security, inter-agency cooperation, smuggling, trafficking, and “illegal border crossing.” The agreement also establishes a mechanism for intelligence-sharing and cooperation between Chinese and Nepali security agencies and border forces.[60] The new security agreement was immediately followed by a high-level 8-day visit of senior Nepali officials to the Tibet Autonomous Region at the invitation of the head of the Chinese Public Security Border Defense force. The 29-member Nepali delegation consisted of top officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Police Armed Forces, the Department of Immigration, and the civil service.[61] The visit established “an effective system of repatriation of illegal immigrants” and aimed to create a “border to border, point to point, police to police” joint communication and cooperation “comprehensive mechanism.”[62]\n\nIn December 2011, on the occasion of the visit of Nepal’s deputy prime minister, China’s public security minister, Meng Jianzhu, expressed China’s satisfaction at the cooperation between the two countries’ security agencies, and called for “joint efforts with Nepal to enhance coordination in exit and entry administration, intelligence and information sharing, and law-enforcement education and training, in a bid to push forward bilateral law-enforcement cooperation.”[63]\n\nIn January 2012, during Premier Wen Jiabao’s landmark visit, Beijing pledged, among major economic and trade deals, a specific financial and technical assistance worth 10 million yuan (US$1.6 million) to “enhance the capacity” of the Nepal Police. Another technical assistance package of 400,000 yuan (about US$65,000) was also signed to support the establishment of a new Nepali Armed Police Force (APF) academy.[64]\n\nIn June 2012, China and Nepal met in Lhasa and reached an agreement to develop district-level mechanisms to bolster border control and monitoring. Nepal’s delegation included representatives from the Home Ministry and Foreign Ministry and one deputy inspector general level officer from the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force (APF), and the National Investigation Department (NID).[65]\n\nIn July 2012, the two sides “agreed to develop mechanisms to ensure exchange of information on a real-time basis and establish effective cooperation between the security agencies of the two countries to control illegal activities in border areas.”[66] Betraying Beijing’s desire to accelerate the implementation of the 2011 security cooperation agreement, China asked Nepal to submit “a proposal for financial and infrastructure aid required to enforce an effective security strategy along the Sino-Nepali border to check cross-border crime.”[67] China also expressly pressed their counterparts not to hand over to UNHCR Tibetans caught in Nepal.”[68]\n\nChina has made extensive use of its newly acquired leverage in Nepal, including by directly interfering with security work. According to a senior diplomat in Kathmandu, officials from the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu and Chinese security officers now often play a role in monitoring and suppressing Tibetan activities.[69]\n\nThere is considerable pressure from China on the Nepali government. Not only from Foreign Ministry or regular diplomats but also from the party and the military attaché, directly to their counterparts in Kathmandu. It’s not true that diplomatic protocol [that requires] going through the Home Ministry and Foreign Ministry is complied with. The interface between Chinese and Nepali officials has gone to the local level.\n\nSo you have intelligence agents in Chinese embassy who go directly to area police stations and tell them what to do. There is no protocol in place about this but it’s being done. It’s at a very crude level, and local Nepali police resent it. But they are unable to do anything about it—they get intimidated very easily by that kind of action. It’s very rude, the Chinese will shout and scream at the local official. [70]\n\nAccording to the same source, the Nepali government finds itself bound by its dependence on Chinese aid and ever more detailed security agreements:\n\nI give credit to the Nepali government, they do try to push back against this, but it’s tough at the local level and at the national level. Nepali government is doing its level best to just do the minimum that China asks, they do not go out of their way to help China. [71]\n\nV. Nepal’s Forced Returns of Tibetans\n\nTibetans crossing over from Tibet who are detained inside Nepal, or who manage to inform relatives or contacts that they are being detained by Nepali police or border forces, stand a good chance of being handled according to the Gentleman’s Agreement between Nepal and UNHCR and making it to India.\n\nBut Tibetans arrested when no other witnesses are present at the border or within Nepali territory are sometimes, perhaps even routinely, forcibly returned to China by Nepali authorities.\n\nA former senior Nepali Home Ministry official told Human Rights Watch that local border police have pushed back or repatriated Tibetans found at or near the border if the Armed Police Force determined that they were not “legitimate refugees, although no formal process was undertaken to make such a determination.”\n\nIt is true that the armed police are returning Tibetans who manage to cross the border into Nepal. But we do that according to our national laws. We check to make sure that each individual who has crossed over is in Nepal with proper travel documents and that they are not national security threats or economic migrants. The police at the border make the determination and return these people back to Tibet. The numbers vary year to year…. We apply the agreement with UNHCR only if the border police make the determination that an individual has a legitimate asylum case.\n\nAnother senior official who was at the time working at the Department of Immigration at one of the major crossing points between China and Nepal also told Human Rights Watch that Tibetans were occasionally forced back as a result of pressure from China.\n\nTibetans interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had crossed the border from Tibet clandestinely at Kodari said that they had to reach Kathmandu without being caught by Nepali police otherwise they would be handed back to China.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch is not able to corroborate these admissions, we believe they are credible and require further investigation, not least because such individuals face a high risk of torture and ill-treatment upon return to China. On-the-spot decisions by the armed police are inherently arbitrary, fail to afford individuals the right to make an asylum or other claim, and violate Nepal’s international legal obligations and the terms of the Gentleman’s Agreement.\n\nTibetan refugees interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had clandestinely crossed the border in the Kodari-Zhangmu area did believe that they were at risk of refoulement if intercepted by Nepali police, and said they had taken great precaution to avoid being intercepted before reaching Kathmandu, avoiding each of the numerous checkpoints on the road.\n\nThreats of Deportation\n\nPolice routinely threaten Tibetans during arrest or while they are in detention with deportation to China. In 2008, nearly all Tibetans interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had been involved in public protests said that they had threatened, some of them repeatedly. Most people interviewed described junior police officers saying, “If you protest tomorrow we will send you back to China,” or “I will confiscate your Refugee Card and send you back to China.”\n\nThe frequency with which this threat is leveled at Tibetans suggests it may be a tactic approved or ordered by senior law enforcement officials. Nepal deputy inspector general of police Bharat Bahadur G.C., in a wide-ranging interview with Chinese journalists from HuanqiuShibao (Global Times), said that Tibetans lacking identification “ought to be deported” but that doing so was not possible “for the moment” because of pressures from UNHCR:\n\nUnder Nepali law, no foreigner has the right to participate in political activities, including attending demonstrations. Most Tibetans in Nepal have no legal passport, visa, Nepali ID, or even refugee ID. They are illegal residents. Actually, we should deport them. We haven’t done that because of the pressure from the UNHCR. They plead leniency for the Tibetans and pledge that they won’t join “Tibetan Independence” activities. So, for the moment we have dropped [the idea of deporting them.][77]\n\nUnder the Convention against Torture, Nepal may not deport anyone to a country where they may face torture. Customary international law also prohibits refoulement (return of refugees to places where they would face persecution). Individuals of Tibetan origin who have been protesting Chinese rule in Tibet would almost certainly be treated as national security suspects and at high risk of torture and ill treatment if forced to return.\n\nOngoing Refoulement Concerns\n\nBetween 2003 and 2010 there were only a handful of documented instances of forced returns:\n\nIn 2003, Nepali officials transferred a group of 18 Tibetans, including four children, from Kathmandu to the Chinese border, and then deported them to China[78];\n\nIn 2008, police arrested a man at the TRTC and deported him[79]; and\n\nIn 2010, three Tibetans were handed over at the border to the Chinese police at Hamli, in Humla district.[80]\n\nWhile there is no public acknowledgement from China that Nepal forcibly returns Tibetans at the border, Beijing has pushed in recent years for the formalization with Nepal of a joint-system to handle what it terms “illegal immigration.” In August 2011, for instance, during a visit by a 29-member strong delegation of Nepali border security officials to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Chinese delegation, headed by a general in the Public Security Bureau’s Border Defense section, called on the Nepali side to “establish an effective system of repatriation for illegal immigration,” and to create a “border to border, point to point, police to police” joint communication and cooperation system. Clearly Chinese officials want a heightened surveillance and repatriation scheme for those they believe to be leaving China irregularly.[81]\n\nAccording to a detailed report from HURON, in October 2012, Nepali police attempted to forcibly return to China two Tibetans who had crossed by foot into Himla district and intended to take a flight from Simikot airport. Police arrested the two men and walked them to a hill two hours in the direction of the border, ordering them to return to China and warning them that the police would shoot them if they tried to turn back. The men went into hiding and ultimately made their way to Kathmandu and the TRTC. Several similar incidents were reported in 2013.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, UNHCR was allowed to access border areas in remote parts of Nepal. Such missions were used to observe local conditions and inform local border police of the mechanisms of the Gentleman’s Agreement set up after 1989. The government of Nepal stopped authorizing these visits around 1998, apparently out of concern that the UNHCR might raise the “Tibet issue” in a way that would upset the Chinese government.[82] UNHCR has resorted to organizing trainings of border police in other locations.\n\nVI. China’s Treatment of Tibetans at the China-Nepal Border\n\nChina’s Refusal of Re-Entry to Some Chinese Citizen Tibetans\n\nSince 2012, there have been several cases of China refusing re-entry to its own citizens of Tibetan ethnicity, in effect exiling them in flagrant violation of domestic and international law. In some cases, the Tibetans were simply refused entry, and had no choice but to stay in Nepal; in others they were told by Chinese police that they should go to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and apply for a special permit that allows “Tibetan compatriots” to re-enter Tibet.[83] These cases, sometimes followed by periods of detention or imprisonment in Tibet, appear to be a consequence of a larger policy introduced after 2008 aimed at deterring Tibetans from crossing the border.[84]\n\nChina’s closer scrutiny of Tibetans at the border seems aimed at discouraging Tibetans from attending major events involving the Dalai Lama, such as the mass Kalachakra teachings, which often draw thousands of pilgrims.[85] In late 2011, in an unusual move, the authorities in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) started allowing large numbers of Tibetans to apply for and obtain passports so that they could travel to attend the Dalai Lama’s Kalachakra scheduled for January 2012. About 7,000 Tibetans from China attended the event, including several hundred who had made their way clandestinely to India.\n\nThe true aim of this apparent relaxation only became clear when hundreds of people were detained upon return to China in February 2012, regardless of whether they had travelled there legally or not.[86]They were detained for periods ranging from several days to several weeks, and forced to undergo interrogation and intensive sessions of political indoctrination.[87] Some Tibetans who were still in India delayed their return in the hope of avoiding this fate. Of those who subsequently crossed back into China, a number were expelled back to Nepal, as detailed below.\n\nIn April 2013, Human Rights Watch interviewed a group of 11 Tibetans from Naqu (Nagchu) prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, who had been expelled at the Kodari border crossing and were being held in custody at the Department of Immigration (DoI) in Kathmandu. According to one of them:\n\nAfter the Chinese police caught us when we crossed back into Tibet, we were detained and interrogated every day for several days. They told us we had broken the law and confiscated our Chinese ID cards. They also forced us to sign a document written in Chinese that we didn’t understand. One day, they took us from our cell and put us in a minibus, accompanied by several cars. They didn’t say where they were taking us. Suddenly we saw we had arrived at the Friendship Bridge, and we understood the police wanted to send us back to Nepal. We said no, we said that we didn’t want to go back to Nepal, that we were from Naqu [in Sichuan province]. But they just shoved us forward to the Nepali side and into the [Nepali] immigration building. [88]\n\nThere, a Nepali immigration official, who they said spoke some Tibetan, refused to take custody of the men, pointing out that they were Chinese citizens and had no travel documents. After some discussion, the Chinese policemen who had brought the group took them back across the border to the Chinese immigration compound, and locked them in an underground basement for several days:\n\nWe were detained in an underground place, it was always very dark. We were very afraid. We didn’t know what was going to happen to us. For three days we were kept there, and they didn’t let us out for a single minute. Nobody told us anything, they just gave us some food that we shared between ourselves.[89]\n\nOn the third day Chinese police again took the men back to the Nepali side of the border, where Nepali immigration officials took them into custody in an apparently previously agreed procedure. Nepali officials took a series of pictures of the 11 men, as if documenting their expulsion, first at the border post, then as they boarded the van in which they were taken to Kathmandu, and finally as they entered the DoI to be detained. According to the account given by the group to Human Rights Watch:\n\nThe day the police took us out of the basement we resisted walking over the bridge [to Nepal], we didn’t want to go! But the Chinese policemen just grabbed us by the neck and forced us across the bridge. Our families are waiting for us back in Naqu. What are we going to do now? They say we are going to be sent back to India, but we don’t have money, we don’t have identity documents anymore. We don’t speak the language, how can we survive there? We just want to go back to our families in Tibet.[90]\n\nThe men were expelled to India several days later after they were able to raise money in the Kathmandu Tibetan community to pay fines imposed by the DoI for illegal entry. It is not clear why Nepali officials accepted custody of individuals who clearly were Chinese citizens, and were being expelled from China against their wishes, in clear breach of immigration laws.\n\nChinese law does not allow banishment through expulsion or refusal of re-entry, and international law clearly prohibits arbitrary deprivation of the right of citizens to enter their country.[91] The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights sets forth that “no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter their own country.”[92] The Human Rights Council General Comment 27, on the freedom of movement, has reaffirmed:\n\nIn no case may a person be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his or her own country... The Committee considers that there are few, if any, circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter one's own country could be reasonable. A State party must not, by stripping a person of nationality or by expelling an individual to a third country, arbitrarily prevent this person from returning to his or her own country.[93]\n\nTo date, several similar, unexplained cases of banishment from China have been recorded:\n\nIn June 2013, Chinese police handed over two Tibetan men, Pema Choge, 32, and Choka, 25, to their Nepali counterparts at the border between Humla district and Ngari prefecture. According to the account they gave to HURON, the two men had travelled from India through Nepal in May, and had been arrested by the police after walking for five days in the direction of Ngari.[94] Chinese police took them to Purang (Burang, Chinese: Pulan), Ngari Prefecture, where they were interrogated about whether they were members of the Tibetan Youth Congress and had come back to Tibet to incite people to commit acts of self-immolation. Police then interrogated the two men separately, taking Pema Choge to Ali, Ngari prefecture headquarters. Police in Purang interrogated and tortured Choka, forcing him to stand and denying him food and water for three days.\n\nAfter a month in detention in Ngari, police reunited the two men and handed them over to the Nepali police, who dispatched them first to Simikot (Humla’s district headquarter) and then to Kathmandu, in the custody of the Department of Immigration. As the men were not considered “recent arrivals” Nepali authorities did not hand them over to the UNHCR but instead deported them to India on June 13. According to their account, Nepali police in Humla initially refused to take them from the Chinese police, but ultimately accepted them after “Chinese police came back with boxes of beer and whisky… and discussed [the matter] for about an hour.”[95]\n\nOn August 23, 2012, Chinese police handed a group of five Tibetans, aged 24 to 55, to Nepali Immigration Officials at Kodari border crossing. All the members of the group had been caught by Chinese police after they crossed back clandestinely into China in April and May, and had been detained for several months in a detention facility in Shigatse. All of them except one, who had left China to attend the Dalai Lama’s Kalachakra teachings in Dharamsala in January 2012, had spent several years living in India.[96] Nepal’s DoI fined the five for breaching the immigration laws and sent them to India shortly afterwards.\n\nChina’s unlawful pushbacks of its citizens have trapped some individuals in a vicious circle of serial expulsions involving China, Nepal, and India. In one instance, three Tibetans who had left China to attend the Kalachakra in January 2012 were arrested upon their return to China.[97] Along with several hundred other people who had attended the teachings, they were arbitrarily detained for several weeks as punishment and for political indoctrination, and permitted to return to their home villages.[98] Shortly thereafter, police arrested them again, detained them for about six months in Shigatse prison, and then handed them over to Nepali officials at the border.[99]\n\nThe DoI labeled the three as “new arrivals,” and handed them over to the UNHCR and the TRTC; they were sent to India shortly thereafter. In April 2013, the three men crossed back into Nepal from India and made their way to the border with China, only to be arrested by Nepali police in Namche Bazaar, in Solukumbu district. This time no longer considered as “new arrivals,” the three men were brought to the Immigration Department on April 21 and sent back to India the next day.[100] Human Rights Watch learned subsequently that one or two had returned to Nepal shortly afterwards, possibly to make another attempt at crossing back into China.\n\nAbuses in Custody in China\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 protests across the Tibetan plateau, Chinese authorities took active steps to control and limit the movement of Tibetans through strict enforcement of the internal travel permit (tongxingzheng) system.[101] Access to areas bordering Nepal was also tightened, with authorities in the Tibet Autonomous Region pledging to “expand the anti-separatist and stability struggle” and establish as soon as possible a long-term security system.”[102] For instance the Shigatse Public Security Border Defense Force reported in March 2010 that the adoption of a host of new measures to enhance border area control and monitoring had made an important contribution to “smashing the sabotaging activities from the Dalai Clique.”[103] These measures included “setting up 22 public order joint-teams” linking government, police, and militias, as well as ”establishing motorbike patrols, party members defense teams, and other joint-defense organizations.”[104]\n\nAs detailed in the following section, border control and prevention of “illegal activities” have become central areas of China-Nepal cooperation, with China providing the funding and training but also requesting ever-closer cooperation with the Nepali Armed Police Forces in their enforcement activities.\n\nTibetans caught by the Chinese authorities for crossing the border irregularly from Nepal appear to be uniformly subjected to detention and imprisonment in abusive conditions. From the moment they are arrested, detainees are beaten by the police. When they are in detention, interrogators and guards routinely beat and torture detainees to coerce confessions or obtain information. Physical abuse, ill treatment, and torture are also used on detainees for no other apparent purpose than to terrorize them and break them psychologically.[105]\n\nUnder Chinese law, penalties for violating entry-exit regulations are limited: they range from fines and short term-administrative detention (between one and fourteen days) to a maximum of one-year imprisonment (article 320 of the Criminal Law).[106] More severe penalties apply only to those who organize, transport, or traffic people (articles 321 and 322 of the Criminal Law).[107] In the Tibet Autonomous Region, however, the authorities appear to follow a specific, well-established procedure, designed to punish and deter Tibetans from going clandestinely abroad and to gather information about the Tibetan community in exile.\n\nThose caught crossing in either direction by People’s Armed Police border security—sometimes acting on tips given by bounty-earning informants in local communities—are briefly detained and interrogated, and then shipped to Shigatse, either to Nyari prison or to a special purpose facility for Tibetan immigration offenders set up in the early 2000s, called “Reception Center for Tibetans.”\n\nPolice typically beat the detainees on arrival, before subjecting them to intense interrogation for several days.[108] Interrogators—many if not most of them Tibetan themselves—systematically torture and beat detainees as a way to elicit information. Those questioned are asked to provide information about their motives for going to India or Nepal, the route they took, and their ties to “separatist” organizations such as the government-in-exile, the Tibetan Youth Congress, or exile monastic communities. They are also interrogated extensively about the activities of the Tibetan community in Nepal and India, and are required to go through a large collection of computerized pictures of individuals and events—including protests—from these places to identify specific individuals or person that they know or recognize.[109]\n\nUnless they are deemed to be of political value or have prior convictions, in which case they may be transferred to the Public Security Bureau (PSB) in Lhasa for further interrogation, detainees are held in these facilities for up to six months, and put to hard labor during their detention. They are then returned to county-level PSBs in their place of origin, processed, and released to relatives, most of the time on payment of a large fine. They are often prohibited from travelling, employment, or rejoining their monastery if they are monks or nuns; put under some form of surveillance; and required to report regularly to the local PSB.[110]\n\nIn July 2005, Human Rights Watch interviewed a 26-year-old monk who had been caught with two other friends after returning from India through Nepal. In his account he described detention conditions in Shigatse and Nyari prison:\n\nWe went via Dram [Zhangmu]. When we reached Shigatse, we were arrested by police personnel of the State Security Bureau of Shigatse Prefecture. We were arrested because they discovered pictures from His Holiness the Dalai Lama when they checked our baggage. We were handcuffed for the whole night, and beaten severely with stick and electric baton, to the point of losing conscience. We were severely beaten and asked questions such as: “Which organization send you here? Is it the Tibetan Youth Congress? Where do you want to distribute these photos?” We were not allowed to sleep and not given food for three days.[111]\n\nPolice first dispatched him to Lhasa where he was held in custody for 16 days, and subjected him to three sessions of interrogation during which he was given electric shocks. He was then sent back to Shigatse, for detention at Nyari prison:\n\nWe were imprisoned there for more than four months. During that time, we were interrogated many times, during which we were beaten and poked with electric wires. Machu County Police personnel also came and interrogated us. Nyari prison is a prison where those trying to escape to India, those trying to return to Tibet and the local criminals are imprisoned. During that time, there were more than 300 prisoners. After about four months of imprisonment, we were taken to the Intermediate People’s Court of Shigatse Prefecture and sentenced [to two years imprisonment].\n\nThere is reason to believe such mistreatment continues. In December 2013, Human Rights Watch interviewed in detail a Tibetan man who had been arrested in December 2010. His arrest came after he had been tricked by a business contact into crossing clandestinely to China from Kodari. The man, who the Chinese police apparently suspected of being a member of the Tibetan Youth Congress, was so severely and repeatedly tortured during his several months of detention that he suffered permanent physical and psychological damages.\n\nVII. Nepal’s Restrictions on Expression, Assembly, and Association\n\nArbitrary Curbs\n\nSince 2008 the government of Nepal has imposed ever-more stifling restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression and assembly of Tibetans. The Tibetan community in Nepal has now effectively lost the right to overtly organize political protests and faces considerable difficulty holding cultural, social, or religious activities that have an indirect political dimension, such as celebrating Tibetan New Year or the Dalai Lama’s birthday.\n\nThe Nepali government’s suppression, at the vocal behest of the Chinese government, of protests by Tibetans in Kathmandu in March to August 2008 was marked by unnecessary and excessive force, arbitrary and preventive detention, beatings and sexual assaults in detention, threats to deport Tibetans to China, and restrictions on freedom of movement for Tibetans in the Kathmandu Valley. Nepali authorities arrested at least 8,350 Tibetans between March 10 and July 18.[112]\n\nThat there has been no repeat of the 2008 protests in Kathmandu is largely a result of Nepali authorities’ efforts to prevent such gatherings. As early as mid-2008, Nepali authorities took preventive action and counter-measures, including, but not limited to:\n\nSystematically dispatching large contingents of riot police to Tibetan areas on politically sensitive dates;\n\nPosting smaller police forces in front of key Tibetan locations such as the Jawalakel settlement, the Tibetan Reception and Transit Centre, and the offices or residences of Tibetan government-in-exile officials;\n\nPreventively arresting or briefly detaining of known Tibetan activists;\n\nPressuring of Tibetan community leaders to cancel or scale down scheduled gatherings and events;\n\nConducting police raids on premises where Tibetan events were being held;\n\nEstablishing police check points targeting Tibetans to prevent potential participants from travelling to an event location;\n\nDispatching plain-clothes officers from the Special Branch—a body tasked with dealing with major criminal and national security cases—to the event venues.[113]\n\nNepal does not deny that it prevents Tibetans refugees from exercising the right to peaceful expression and assembly. In September 2012, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, stated: “We have our own values regarding the policy on refugees, our policies are guided by geopolitical sensitivities.”[114]\n\nProhibitions Imposed on Political Protests\n\nThe Tibetans we interviewed in Kathmandu and Pokhara in 2012 and 2013 all told us that since the 2008 protests it has become almost impossible to organize political rallies or gatherings in public places, and that even events held within Tibetan settlements are tightly restricted by the police. According to a Tibetan community leader in Boudhanath:\n\nWe have completely lost our right to demonstrate now. Anyone who goes out to protest is immediately stopped by the police. We can’t even hold public events to celebrate the Dalai Lama’s birthday, which we always did in the past.[115]\n\nOne Tibetan activist from the Tibet Youth Congress told Human Rights Watch:\n\nIn 2008 I used to go demonstrate every day. Every day I was arrested, every next day I would come against to protest! We demonstrated in front of the Chinese Embassy, we demonstrated in front of the UN, we demonstrated in Bodha, even though the police broke our demonstrations it was still possible to do it. But now it is impossible, the police will prevent us from going anywhere.[116]\n\nOne resident from the Jawalakel settlement said that ahead of sensitive political dates, the police systematically station riot police outside of the settlement to prevent people from coming out and staging or joining a protest:\n\nWe are used to this now. Every March 10, every September 2 [on which Tibetans observe “Democracy Day”], every time there is a high-level visit from a Chinese official, the police come. The park their vehicles in front of the settlement, they tell our representatives that it is prohibited to go out, and they don’t let anyone go out.[117]\n\nThe police also regularly take into detention individuals who engage in activities they regard as political statements of opposition to China, such as wearing “Free Tibet” T-shirts or displaying posters of the Dalai Lama, stating that such signs constitute a violation of the Public Offences Act.\n\nIn an incident in June 2011, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Shyam Lal Gyawali told AFP that police had to intervene after the Tibetan exiles sporting headbands and T-shirts reading “Free Tibet” tried to stage an anti-China protest.\n\nOne resident from the Jawalakel Settlement told Human Rights Watch that she had resorted to tattooing herself to protest the confiscation of “Free Tibet” material:\n\nThey confiscated all my Free Tibet items so I made this [“Free Tibet”] tattoo. And I want to know what they will do with it. They will have to cut off my arm because it has “Free Tibet” written on it? I want to see what they will do with that…[118]\n\nRestrictions on Public and Private Gatherings\n\nThe prohibition on Tibetan protests also extends to Tibetans joining other public and private events. For instance, despite the approval of the organizers, Tibetans were prohibited from joining a public gathering organized by Nepali human rights organizations on December 10, 2012, International Human Rights Day. According to a Tibetan organizer who tried to join the meeting:\n\nWe were planning to join the march with a couple of banners saying “Human Rights for Tibetans,” nothing more. The morning of the event I took a taxi with three other friends. Ten minutes later we were stopped at a small police checkpoint. I think they were looking for us. After they verified we were Tibetans they detained us and took us to the police station. We spent the entire day detained at the police station. Representatives from Nepali human rights organizations came to see us and talk to the police; they said they could not release us.[119]\n\nIn 2010, police warned organizers of a birthday celebration for the Dalai Lama, in the Jawalakhel settlement compound, that the event should not be turned into “anti-China activities.” In order to limit participation, police set up checkpoints throughout the city, pulling over from buses and taxis with passengers who looked Tibetan. Tibetans and people lacking identification were ordered to turn back.[120]\n\nOne respondent said that this method was regularly employed to prevent Tibetans and Nepali monks and nuns from Tibetan monasteries from converging towards Buddha Stupa, a prominent monument in Kathmandu, on specific dates:\n\nAt the checkpoints the police look for Tibetans or monks: they ask for their identity document and tell them to step out. There are many check-points on the way so even if you manage to get through one you end up being caught. [121]\n\nThe same respondent said that such controls were affecting the entire Tibetan community, not only those who intended to join the gatherings:\n\nAs a result lots of Tibetans don’t dare to take public transportation or go out on these days. It’s better to stay home. If you have a job it’s a big problem, but there is nothing you can do.[122]\n\nIn 2011, the authorities went one step further and explicitly prohibited the Tibetan community from holding public ceremonies to celebrate the Dalai Lama’s birthday. The ban was announced by Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, chief government administrator of Kathmandu district. The authorities said they would allow celebrations inside monasteries provided there were “no banners or slogans against China.”[123] On the day of the celebration, riot police surrounded the elementary school where the public ceremony was due to take place. Tsewang Dolma, the president of the Nepal chapter of the Tibetan Youth Congress, told the Associated Press that “[p]olice officers were there from the early morning, 2 o'clock. We tried to celebrate, but the police didn't allow anyone inside the gate.\"[124] Police also entered the compound of the Samten Ling monastery in Boudhanath and confiscated posters of the Dalai Lama and a celebratory banner.\n\nOutside Kathmandu, police have limited where Dalai Lama birthday celebrations can be held. One community worker in Pokhara’s main Tibetan settlement told Human Rights Watch:\n\nThese restrictions are all new. We used to celebrate His Holiness’ birthday freely here, and we would even have a procession in Pokhara. Many ordinary Nepali would join, it was a happy occasion. We always invited Nepali officials to come, and they often came and shared the food. Now we still invite them but they don't come anymore, and there is a police vehicle stationed at the settlement entrance.[125]\n\nCommunity leaders in Kathmandu and Pokhara told of being repeatedly called by police and officials from their respective Central District Office in the days and hours that preceded that celebration day.\n\nThey call me many, many times. They ask for all sorts of details: ‘What are you planning?’ ‘How many people are involved?’ ‘Will you shout slogans?’ Sometimes they ask me to come to their office. It’s a lot of pressure. I try my best to explain that we just want to celebrate His Holiness’s birthday, but they impose all sorts of restrictions: they even asked me not to have pictures of His Holiness. The ceremony is for his birthday, how can we not have his picture up?\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, we were allowed to hold a small event, only for the local residents of Boddha, inside our building. Several policemen came, some in plain clothes, to monitor the event. They stood there, in the room, they took pictures. It feels very oppressive; we are not doing anything criminal. [126]\n\nThe prohibition on gatherings has at times extended to Tibetan cultural events with no obvious political dimension. For instance, in October 2011, the police stopped a performance by the local Tibetan Opera Association (Lhamo Tsokpa), and ordered the performers and the organizers to cancel the event. The police said they had received instructions from the Central District Administrative Office.[127]\n\nTibetan NGOs have become victims of police suspicion about any kind of Tibetan-themed event. Groups that address community issues, such as drug-use prevention, education, and women’s rights, say that they have met with increased difficulties in their operations since 2008.[128]\n\nThe leader of a women’s rights organization, which is supported by, but not part of the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamsala, told Human Rights Watch that the restrictions have come at a time when their services are particularly needed by the community, noting that Nepal’s refusal to confer legal status on many Tibetans has increased their employment difficulties and put new stresses on families and relationships.\n\nWe used to set up a booth in Boudhanath at special occasions, where we would do outreach to the community and raise funds for our activities. But this has become impossible. The police won’t let us do that anymore. Last time, we just set up a table with some leaflets and a banner with the name of our organization. Immediately the police arrived and told us to leave. I tried to argue with them but we had no choice. They didn’t tell me why it was illegal, but we can’t afford to bring problems with the authorities to our organizations. So we just packed and left.[129]\n\nA community leader in Kathmandu similarly recounted:\n\nThey [the Central District Office] say this is because of Nepal’s One-China policy, we cannot have anti-China activities. But I tell them, our activities are peaceful, they are open, we are not breaking the law. Anyone can come. Nowadays Chinese Buddhists are travelling to hear His Holiness [the Dalai Lama] teachings in Dharamsala. But they just say: “I have my orders.”[130]\n\nPressures on NGOs and Activists Defending Tibetans\n\nThe Nepali authorities have also adopted a hard line towards human rights organizations, lawyers, and NGOs who are working on Tibetan-related issues or cases.\n\nSudip Pathak, head of Human Rights Organization of Nepal (HURON) told Human Rights Watch that the Nepali government was “not giving any space to discuss the issue” and was always putting pressure on the organization for its work on Tibetans:\n\nAs a human rights organization we have the duty to protect the refugees who are living in Nepal. But when we stand for the Tibetan refugee in Nepal, it’s really difficult. Lots of the time, the government pressures us: “Don’t work for the Tibetans, do not protect the Tibetans inside the Nepal.”[131]\n\nIn meetings with government officials they tell us: “Why you are supporting the Tibetans? Nepal supports the One-China policy. So you don’t have the right to protect the Tibetans in Nepal.” [132]\n\nPathak also reported anonymous calls and threats made in apparent connection to challenges brought by HURON on detention cases:\n\nWe provide legal representation to Tibetans. And things can be really difficult. Sometimes we get the anonymous calls made from public telephone booths, for instance after we make applications [for legal representation of detained Tibetans] after the police file their First Information Reports.[133]\n\nThe Nepali authorities have also tried to discourage legal activism on Tibetan cases by portraying lawyers who litigate on behalf of Tibetans as security risks and “anti-China” elements. Hari Phuyel, a lawyer and consultant for the International Commission of Jurists, told Human Rights Watch that such attacks had affected their own security and compromised their work.[134]\n\nMy name, together with Govinda Bandi and Sudip Pathak, has been mentioned negatively in the press because of our work with Tibetan refugees and asylum seekers. It was an article in which the Intelligence Department was interviewed about Tibetan activities in Nepal. We were labelled anti-China in the article.\n\nAfter this article appeared, I went to senior people in the Intelligence Department and asked them why they had published our names, that it affected our security and compromised our work. They said to me “It’s not just about you three. We know everything about anyone connected to Tibet work. This time your names appeared, next time it will be others.”\n\nSubsequently I had an interview with the Chief Secretary to the government (Lila Mani Poudyel). I know him well. As soon as I started raising this issue, he said, “Talk to me about any other subject, do not talk to me about Tibetans,” indicating that his hands were tied on the matter.[135]\n\nGovinda Bandi, another prominent human rights lawyer who litigated several Tibetan cases before the Supreme Court, told Human Rights Watch that the Chinese Embassy had placed restrictions on his ability to obtain visas to China as a consequence of his work:\n\nAfter my name appeared in the article mentioned by Hari Phuyel. I was denied a visa to Hong Kong. I have spent a lot of time in Hong Kong, and have never ever been denied a visa, so this was a surprise. I found out through contacts that the Chinese embassy had blocked my name as a result of the article and my name being connected to my work with Tibetan asylum seekers. I managed to get a visa later on, but only after getting letters of invitation and guarantees from the university, which had invited me, something I’ve never had to do before.[136]\n\nNegative press coverage of Tibetan issues in Nepali media, and the publication of stories that allege that Tibetan activists and monasteries are engaging in activities that are serious national security threats against China, are also making it more difficult to work on Tibetan issues.\n\nAccording to Yubaraj Ghimire, a journalist who has covered the China-Nepal relationship, the Chinese government is directly involved in the publication of some of the stories:\n\nI can’t prove it but from talking to journalists and editors, there is a concerted effort made by China to plant stories—which are simply not true—in the Nepali press to make the Tibetans look like a serious national security threat to China.[137]\n\nBecause of the negative press coverage of Tibetan issues in the Nepali media, many organizations are choosing to stay away from the issue, for fear of jeopardizing their other work. A leading human rights NGO coordinator told Human Rights Watch:\n\nWorking on Tibetan issues is too sensitive and risks jeopardizing work on other, more mainstream issues. We have discussed taking up projects on Tibetan refugees but our board members think it would bring too much difficulties to our work. It could be used by people who oppose our work for accountability and justice.[138]\n\nTibet is also a sensitive issue for local politicians. Siddhartha Gautam, an MP candidate in Lumbini, told Human Rights Watch that his public pro-Tibet stance had caused him to be placed under investigation by the police, reportedly at the demand of the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu:\n\nI know that my name is on the blacklist of the Chinese embassy due to my pro-Tibet activities. I know this because I have friends in the right places who tell me things. When I announced my candidacy for MP from Lumbini district, the local police station went around my village asking for information about me and my activities. This happened on the directive of the Nepal Department of Investigation who in turn had been warned about me by the Chinese embassy. This has all been confirmed to me by friends in the intelligence and police. I am unable to campaign in Lumbini because I get threatening phone calls, on my mobile, on my home phone; my family get threats as well. The threats are always about my pro-Tibet work. [139]\n\nReaction to Self-Immolation Cases\n\nSince February 2009, more than 120 Tibetans have self-immolated inside Tibet in what appear to be protests against Chinese policies in Tibet. The Chinese government immediately blamed the self-immolations on Tibetan “forces” abroad, and deployed extensive measures to prevent self-immolations from multiplying, including by bringing criminal charges against relatives and individuals accused of having helped those who self-immolate; in some cases, such alleged “accomplices” have been charged with murder. [140]\n\nOn November 10, 2011, about a month ahead of a scheduled state visit to Nepal by China’s then-premier Wen Jiabao, a man only identified as Bhutuk attempted to set himself on fire in front of the Buddha Stupa in Kathmandu, a gesture that seemed to echo the dozen or so self-immolations in protests at Chinese policies that had taken place in Tibet by that time.[141] The attempt failed, but the Nepali authorities were unable to question the man, who managed to flee and disappear.\n\nRather than take steps to discourage suicide or pursue other legitimate public policy responses, the Home Affairs Ministry responded to this incident by threatening to take retaliatory measures against the entire Tibetan community. The Telegraph Nepal reported the Ministry’s spokesperson as stating:\n\nThe government is in a very difficult situation since the"
