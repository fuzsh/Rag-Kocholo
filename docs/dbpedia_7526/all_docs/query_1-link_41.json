        "text": "Appendix A2\n\nFraunhofer-Gesellschaft: The German Model of Applied Research\n\nThe Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (Fraunhofer Society) is a network of German institutes for applied research. The Fraunhofer’s primary mission is to perform contract research for German industry, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which translate basic research from universities and non-university research organizations into commercial products and industrial processes. The 60 Fraunhofer institutes in Germany, with an average staff of 400, perform research and test industrial processes on their premises which enjoy state of the art equipment and deep human competencies. Fraunhofer’s funding is derived from diverse sources, including federal, state, and European Union public funding, fees from contract research for industry and public organizations and foundations, and licensing fees for intellectual property. It has created roughly150 spin-off companies, with a very high rate of success.\n\nEach Fraunhofer institute specializes in a particular technology or sector, and a Fraunhofer institute exists for virtually every sector of significance to a modern industrial economy, ranging from renewable energy, aerospace, automotive manufacturing, microelectronics and information technology. Each Fraunhofer institute is paired with a German university and can utilize the most promising students as part-time researchers, thereby giving students practical experience in commercially-oriented research and manufacturing environments. The institutes generate technology for commercial products and processes, enable companies to test equipment and industrial processes on pilot manufacturing lines, and foster a continual flow of trained engineers and technicians to the private sector.\n\nThe German model of innovation is widely credited as a major factor underlying Germany’s strong international competitive performance since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. German exports are at an all-time high and GDP growth outpaces the rest of the Euro zone and the United States. German competitive strength are often attributed to factors such as the country’s\n\nhighly-skilled work force; a longstanding “dual system” of education/apprenticeship, which marries academic learning and practical skills; the export prowess of Germany’s small and medium enterprise (Mittelstand), which dominates hundreds of world markets for niche technologies; a web of mutually-supporting networks of companies, associations, and research organizations that can address complex technological challenges and diffuse technology through collaboration; and the excellence of German engineering and manufacturing technology in companies of all sizes. The Fraunhofer plays a central role in supporting all of these aspects of German competitive strength.\n\nReflecting Germany’s international competitive performance, the Fraunhofer is probably the world’s most thoroughly studied applied research organization, with other countries examining the question of whether they could apply the “Fraunhofer model” wholly or partially and emulate Germany’s success. Of particular interest is Fraunhofer’s role in Germany’s abiding strength in “traditional” industries which have eroded in other developed economies, such as automobiles and machinery. Germany companies have remained competitive in these sectors through a continual process of incremental improvement in existing products and processes, an approach that may not yield technological breakthroughs but builds a competitive edge over a long timeframe. The Fraunhofer emphasizes performance of a large number of short-term research projects that have near-term commercial impact, an approach which reinforces the German method of incremental innovation. It continually diffuses competitively relevant innovation technology throughout the German economy and trains highly-skilled engineers, technicians and managers. Public funding of the Fraunhofer reflects a longstanding German national consensus that public investments must be made in research infrastructure that includes infrastructure for applied research with commercial relevance. 1\n\nIt is important, however, not to overrate the impact and the importance of Fraunhofer Gesellschaft for the German research and innovation system. While Fraunhofer Gesellschaft have contributed in significant ways to the recent success of German industry, this success has also rested on factors such as the high demand for capital goods/machinery by emerging economies and the match of this demand with Germany’s industry profile. Other factors supporting German competitiveness include a competitive currency, worker training programs, policies to subsidize the retention of skilled workers in economic downturns, and a dense network of supporting institutions, including localized banks with long-term relationships with Mittlestand firms.2\n\n________________\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Fraunhofer has an enviable reputation throughout Germany, Europe, and the world. A report by the U.K. House of Commons Science and Technology Committee commented in 2011 that “the name Fraunhofer resonates across the world and is widely associated with an impressive network of German technology and innovation centres.”3 In 2010, the United Kingdom’s Minister of State for Universities and Science, David Willetts, testified that the Fraunhofer Institutes “have been a key part of Germany’s success in advanced manufacturing and high grade engineering.4 In 2010, Fraunhofer was Germany’s second most popular employer for graduates in the natural sciences, fourth most popular for information and communications technology graduates, and seventh most popular for engineering graduates5. The amount of contract research business with industry—an accepted benchmark of Fraunhofer’s effectiveness in promoting industrial innovation—is at an all-time high and increased by 15 percent between 2010 and 2011.6\n\nRecent German Economic Performance\n\nA recent resurgence of interest in the Fraunhofer reflects the fact that Germany has weathered the financial crisis which began in 2008 far more\n\n________________\n\nsuccessfully than most industrialized nations.7 German manufacturing as a share of GDP stood at 20.7 percent, versus 12.7 percent for the United States and 11.5 percent for the U.K.8 “[D]espite despite the onset of the financial and economic crisis in 2008, German research-intensive industry was able to develop a leading position among the established economies. Sectors which particularly profited from this development include the manufacture of road vehicles, machinery, electrical machinery, and chemicals.”9\n\nThis performance poses the obvious question of how a wealthy, high-wage country with a strong currency could compete so successfully in a global market where the terms of competition are increasingly driven by low-cost Asian firms.10\n\nGerman Model of Innovation\n\nThe German model of innovation applies science, technology, and engineering to drive incremental but constant improvements in processes and technologies and aims at niche areas where competition is less intense than in large commodity markets.11 Although Germany has a vast array of research organizations capable of supporting such a strategy, the Fraunhofer is the foremost, and is most often cited as the driver of German competitiveness in export markets. The perception of Fraunhofer as a success story underpinning German competitive achievements in global markets has led other countries to study its methods and structure to determine whether part or all of the\n\n________________\n\n“Fraunhofer model” could be adopted domestically.12 The Fraunhofer model was extensively reviewed in 2010 and 2011 by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, and aspects of that model are now being adopted in the United Kingdom. 13 In the United States, the Fraunhofer was the subject of studies during the 1990s by the Council on Competitiveness and the Office of Technology Policy in the Department of Commerce.14 In 2005, French Research Minister Francois d’Aubert commented that his country needed to develop “Partnership research…on the model of the German Fraunhofer Institutes.”15 Other countries have demonstrated similar interest.16\n\nNon-German observers tend to cite the Fraunhofer’s funding model as its strongest positive feature. That model, based on a formula of one-third core public funding, one third private contract research and one third publicly-funded contract research, ensures stable long-term funding. The model is particularly attractive to Anglo-American observers whose research institutions have suffered from erratic funding and a partisan political environment in which government support for science is controversial and uncertain. Fraunhofer staff acknowledge the success of the institute’s funding approach, but emphasize its relational aspects as the real basis for its success. Fraunhofer institutes operate in vast, multiple overlapping human and institutional networks embracing universities, companies, research organizations, trade associations, and foundations, organized by scientific field and areas of interest. Relevant units of these networks can be brought to bear on research projects, consortia, and development alliances to address specific tasks based on their particular competencies. Any private or public entity which enters into a research relationship with Fraunhofer gains entrée to these networks.\n\nFraunhofer is more than a networking organization. It possesses deep and broad organic competencies and institutional scientific memory, reflecting\n\n________________\n\nits permanent staff of scientists, technicians, and managers. Its institutes are extremely well-equipped and most of them operate multiple pilot manufacturing lines and other demonstration facilities.17 The Fraunhofer is a beneficiary of the “power and generosity of the…German machine tool industry,” which permits its labs to be equipped with state-of-the-art machines loaned on generous terms.18 The institute holds a massive patent portfolio which can be deployed on behalf of clients seeking to license cutting-edge technology. It is relentlessly focused on practical applications of technology.\n\nSupporting the Mittelstand\n\nThe Fraunhofer is frequently cited in connection with the export strength of Germany’s small and medium enterprises. The best of these firms, the so-called Mittelstand, are typically family-owned, highly specialized, based in small cities and towns, and “build products that dominate obscure industrial subsectors”. “There is no doubt that the German Mittelstand were one of the main factors that generated economic success and prosperity in Germany after World War II.”19 Observing the slogan, “don’t dance where the elephants play,” the Mittelstand pursue niche markets, particularly at the high end of the product spectrum, and make continuous incremental improvements in their products to maintain leadership over their competitors.20 “It might be that their products will not be the cheapest, but they definitely have the best quality.”21 A 2007 study\n\n________________\n\nfound that over 1,130 small and medium-sized German companies occupied the number one or two position in the world market for their products, or the number one position in the European market.22 According to one source, the Fraunhofer’s “main focus [is] on the Mittelstand companies,” and “the research facilities of Fraunhofer serve as external, very well equipped research departments of the Mittelstand companies.”23\n\nThe Skilled German Workforce\n\nThe Fraunhofer is cited in connection with another aspect of the German model, the country’s highly trained, technologically-adept work force, which has been a subject of foreign admiration and study for over a hundred years.24 To some extent this phenomenon is cultural—German blue collar workers draw on a tradition of craftsmanship with the attitude that “excellence on the shop floor is every bit as important as in the Nobel Prize caliber laboratory.”25 The pursuit of excellence in manufacturing is widely attributed to Germany’s longstanding “dual system” of vocational training, pursuant to which a course of academic study of a practical discipline is undertaken in parallel with apprenticeship at a company or a public vocational institute.26 The Fraunhofer applies the principle of the dual system at the highest educational levels, with masters and PhD candidates and postdocs simultaneously pursuing courses of study in science or engineering while performing work and acquiring practical experience in a Fraunhofer institute.27\n\n________________\n\nWeaknesses of the German System\n\nThe German innovation system is by no means perfect. German innovation tends to build on established structures rather than creating entirely new ones; product and process improvements are slow, albeit continuous. “The resulting pattern of innovation is one that is more likely to generate improvements of existing products of existing firms and sectors than to give rise to new ones.”28 The postwar German system has not produced “radical, path-breaking innovations found, for example, in America.”29 Some observers believe that Germany’s “heavy concentration of R&D and innovation activities in the automotive sector…may lead to an unbalanced innovation system.”30 “Germany never came close to a computer industry that was able to compete with its U.S. counterpart.”31 Start-ups which become spectacular successes are rare, and would-be startups confront obstacles such as inadequate availability of venture and bank capital and legal and societal factors that punish market failure.32 As a\n\n________________\n\nresult, with the notable exception of SAP, there is no German counterpart to Intel, Apple, Google, or Facebook. The former area of East Germany absorbs a substantial part of the federal research spending but generates comparatively little innovation.33\n\nDr. Stefan Kulhman, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Innovation Research in Karlsruhe, told a National Academies symposium in 2007 that Germany’s education system, long considered quite strong, had declined to a point of crisis and required “and expensive restructuring.”34 The German university system is widely criticized and may prove incapable of supplying enough graduates with the skills required by German industry.35 In 2011, on any given month, Germany averaged 92,000 vacant engineering jobs. The director of the Köln Institute for Economic Research IW, Hans-Peter Kloes, commented that “if we cannot close the engineering gap, the continuing shortage of qualified employees will become a threat to the German business model.”36 Even the vaunted vocational training system is under strain; a 2010 study by Germany’s education ministry found that while there was an unmet need in German industry for 9-10,000 apprenticeships, one in five apprentices “did not stick out the apprenticeship,” the number of students entering apprenticeships was declining, and “businesses are facing a huge drop-off in apprentice numbers.”37\n\nThe Fraunhofer is implicated in at least some of these systemic weaknesses:\n\nBecause the Fraunhofer business model is based on demand for research from industries that already exist, it has little economic\n\n________________\n\ninevitably compete with universities for public and private funding as well as personnel.38\n\nThe Fraunhofer model derives much of its strength from other elements of the German innovation system which are not present to the same degree in the U.S. The United States has no close parallels to the German system of stable government funding for commercially-relevant research; to the Mittelstand; to the “dual system” of vocational and training; or to the German tradition that competition should be subordinated to cooperative arrangements. These aspects of the German system reflect complex, multigenerational cultural and institutional evolution and cannot easily be replicated elsewhere. In this connection, an exchange which occurred in Britain’s House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in 2012 is worth noting. MP Sir Peter Williams commended the Fraunhofer model to his colleagues and urged that the country learn from it:\n\nWilliams: Down the decades everybody, from John Fairclough onwards, has said to the Government ‘Look at the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft; there are lessons to be learned’. It is a fact that they do not have to debate the issues that we are debating today because they have been through the valley of death as a nation, as it were, and they prosper by valuing and backing engineering with their Lander, federal government, financial institutions, Mittelstand families, scientists, engineers, and business folk playing like a team, which is why they are going to win the European Championship as well…\n\nMP Jim Dowd: So we could have all these benefits as well if all we did was change every single piece of our social structure.39\n\nThe Fraunhofer and the German innovation model are nevertheless of interest from an Anglo-American perspective because of Germany’s success in holding its leadership position in traditional manufacturing industries and in retaining a major manufacturing presence in Germany itself, with the implications which that holds for employment and regional economic development. Germany remains strong in industries like automobiles,\n\n________________\n\nmachinery, metals, and chemicals—industries that have eroded, shed jobs, and begun to move offshore in the United States and the United Kingdom. For this reason, the German innovation system warrants study.\n\nTHE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING\n\nThe German innovation system is complex, featuring multiple levels of governance and interlocking responsibilities between different ministries and between authorities at different levels of the political system.40 Significantly, “in contrast to many other countries, [in Germany], there is an implicit consensus at the federal and state levels that funding should, by and large, be geared towards bridging the gap between knowledge creation and application.”41 The system is characterized by dispersion of authority and funding responsibility.42\n\nFederal Ministries\n\nAt the federal level, the main responsibility for science and technology policy lies with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The BMBF co-funds with the Länder Germany’s non-university research organizations, including Fraunhofer, and is the principal source of the institute’s basic public funding. The BMBF provides funding for a broad array of research programs and projects, generally aiming at collaborative R&D between public sector research and the private sector. Many BMBF programs are managed by semi-autonomous program agencies, a mechanism that has been characterized as “industry friendly”. The Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) promotes innovation-and-transfer projects through public-private R&D collaboration in topical areas which include energy, information technology, media, and aerospace. It operates a number of programs to support small and medium enterprises and to promote start-ups.43\n\n________________\n\nFederal-state Arrangements\n\nSince 1975, federal-state funding of scientific research has been governed by the “Framework Agreement on Research Promotion” (RV-Bo) pursuant to which funding ratios are assigned to the federal government for universities and non-university research organizations. Under this arrangement, the Fraunhofer receives 90 percent of its core funding from the federal government and 10 percent from the Länder. The 90:10 funding ratio has endured for decades; it is one of many “organizational arrangements” in the German innovation system which “are very rigid because they are the result of complicated power balances which nobody can disturb because of possible incalculable consequences.”44 The rigidity of the German research funding arrangements arise out of a concordat between the federal government and the Länder that was negotiated in the early 1970s.45\n\n“Research Cartel”\n\n“Fraunhofer institutes occupy a specific role in a very elaborate division of labour within the German system of research.”46 The German non-university scientific research arrangements are widely characterized as a research promotion cartel. The lines of demarcation with respect to the responsibilities of each organization have been clearly established for many years, and no significant new research actor has entered this universe for decades.47 Competition within the institutes between internal subunits is\n\n________________\n\nTABLE APP-A2-1 Germany’s Key Research Organizations\n\nInstitution Focus Max Planck Society Basic Research Helmholtz Association Basic Research (“big science”) Fraunhofer Society Applied Research Leibnitz-Association Various\n\nsimilarly constrained by the establishment of clear lines of demarcation between organizations and encouragement of collaboration when areas of overlap become apparent.48\n\nThe Max Planck organization, universities and public sector research organizations are responsible for basic research. The Helmholtz Association ensures infrastructure for large scale science projects of national importance.49 Fraunhofer and other institutes of applied research, such as the Steinbeis Foundation, are responsible for the transfer of technology from the science base to industrial end users.50 The Max-Planck and the Fraunhofer usually do not\n\n________________\n\ncompete for the same projects but will collaborate on specific projects that require the skill sets of both the basic and applied sciences.51\n\nFederal High-Tech Strategy 2020\n\nThe German federal government is currently pursuing a “High-Tech Strategy 2020,” an effort to coordinate existing public support for research and innovation in a manner which improves the country’s international competitiveness and innovative capability. A target of this effort is to increase German R&D spending to 3 percent of GDP (it was about 2.8 percent in 2010). Reflecting the concern that German public funding of R&D is characterized as a “sprinkling can,” featuring large numbers of small grants for small projects, the High Tech Strategy seeks to concentrate public spending on targeted areas of cutting edge research. The strategy also targets perceived weaknesses in the German innovation system, including an inadequate market for venture capital and direct investment capital, inadequate participation by SME’s in R&D, and difficult conditions confronting technology-based start-ups and their financial backers.52\n\nState Initiatives\n\nWithin the German federal system the Länder enjoy a degree of leeway for unilateral policy initiatives. They control the universities within their jurisdictions and can determine their funding level and strategic direction, and they can also provide non-university research organizations located in their territory with additional funding through research contracts and with a variety of other forms of support. Finally, they can use incentives to encourage new research institutes to choose them as sites and to attract research organizations and talented individuals from other Länder. Baden-Wurttemberg, North-Rhine-\n\n________________\n\nWestphalia and Bavaria have used such methods to develop technology-intensive economies.\n\nTHE FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT TODAY\n\nThe Fraunhofer Gesellschaft is comprised of 60 research institutes active in over 250 business fields and core competencies. Its institutes are widely dispersed across Germany. Its legal form is a registered association under private law (eingetragener verein). Its annual budget is about 1.8 billion Euros. It has 20,000 employees.53 Each Fraunhofer institute is linked with a German research university and the Directors of Fraunhofer institutes usually also serve on university faculties. The Fraunhofer has established seven institutes in the United States and research subsidiaries in Chile, Austria, Portugal, and Italy. In strictly legal terms, the Fraunhofer is under no obligation to execute research programs drawn up by government entities but in practice its research orientation is closely aligned with that of the German government and the European Union.54\n\nThe Fraunhofer Mission\n\nThe core purpose of the Fraunhofer is the pursuit of knowledge with which has practical utility. It manages an annual business volume of about a billion Euros, most of it involving contract research.55 Characterizing itself as a “bridge” linking German universities and industry, the Fraunhofer is a formidable research organization in its own right, and generally owns the patents which are derived from joint university/Fraunhofer/industry collaboration. Fraunhofer institutes do not so much transfer knowledge from universities to industry as “generate relevant application-oriented knowledge themselves on demand from their clients. While this may often be strongly linked to research in universities…it nevertheless constitutes a knowledge creation sub-system of its\n\n________________\n\nown.”56 Because Fraunhofer is heavily dependent on revenue from contract research performed for industry, its research is closely correlated with the practical needs of companies. If a choice needs to be made between money from an industry project or the pursuit of cutting edge technology, the Fraunhofer institutes usually of necessity choose money.57 Although Fraunhofer R&D projects tend to be relatively small, short-term efforts seeking incremental improvements in products and processes, its institutes have achieved numerous noteworthy innovations.58\n\nGovernance\n\nThe Fraunhofer’s 60 research institutes in Germany are supervised by a headquarters organization based in Munich.59 Executive direction is provided by a President who is also Chairman of the Executive Board, comprised of three Senior Vice Presidents. The Executive Board manages the institutes’ business activities, develops science and research strategies, and negotiates with governmental organizations to raise funding. The Executive Board appoints the Directors of the individual Fraunhofer Institutes.60\n\n________________\n\nEach Fraunhofer research institute is managed by a Director and Steering Committee. The Fraunhofer seeks Directors who combine scientific achievement and entrepreneurialism, and the Directors typically serve on boards of directors of German companies. The individual Fraunhofer institutes enjoy a high degree of autonomy and are allowed to choose their research fields and topics, their projects and the handling of project results. Individual institutes are free to determine their own internal organizational structure, set up separate profit centers, and distribute basic funding. The institutes are responsible for balancing their own budgets. If an institute experiences an operating loss in a given year, the shortfall is made good with funds from headquarters. Institutes that incur losses for a number of consecutive years risk closure.61 Each institute is advised by an Advisory Board comprised of representatives from industry, the scientific community, and the public sector. Each institute must review its strategic plan every five years, and, at five year intervals are subject to external audits.62\n\nGrowth in Contract Revenue\n\nThe Fraunhofer benchmarks its performance on the demand for its services from industry, manifested in revenue from research contracts. During the period 2007-2011, its annual industrial contract revenue grew by 78 million Euros, an increase of over 23 percent, and in 2011 hit an all time high of 406 million euros. Total contract revenue (public and industrially funded research) has grown steadily and reached 1.515 million Euros in 2011.\n\nRelationships with Universities\n\nEach Fraunhofer institute is linked with a German university with a research capability in the sciences and/or engineering which addresses the institutes’ area of focus. The Director of each institute usually is also a member of the faculty, and typically identifies the most promising university students to\n\n________________\n\nsteer to positions at Fraunhofer.63 Most Directors spend the majority of their time at the institute rather than in teaching activities.\n\nThe relationship between one of Germany’s leading universities of technology, RWTH Aachen, and Fraunhofer, illustrates the close interrelationship the institute develops with universities. RWTH Aachen, Germany’s oldest technology-oriented university, is co-located with four Fraunhofer institutes in the Aachen area, Fraunhofers ILT (lasers), FIT (applied information technology), IPT (production technology), and the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME. Adapting ideas from Stanford and Silicon Valley, RWTH Aachen allows companies to locate on campus, participate in university activities (including teaching) and enroll employees in university courses. A total of 18 chairs and institutes at RWTH Aachen and two Fraunhofer institutes (ILT and IPT) have established a “Cluster of Excellence…Integrative Production Technology for High Wage Countries,” the purpose of which is “to engage process engineers and materials scientists to develop new concepts and technologies for sustainable manufacturing.”64\n\nAnother example of the close Fraunhofer-university collaboration is the Dresden Innovation Center Energy Efficiency (DIZEEFF) which involves the Technical University of Dresden and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. This involves a total of 13 collaborations between 8 university institutes and four Fraunhofer institutes in the area of energy efficiency. This effort “tightly connects basic research at [the University] with Fraunhofer’s competencies to transfer technologies and innovations to industry.”65\n\nFunding\n\nIt is commonly said that one third of Fraunhofer’s revenues are contributed by the federal and Länder governments, one-third derived from\n\n________________\n\nindustrial contracts, and one-third from public research contracts. This Drittelsung (literally, “third solution”) model has won extensive praise from foreign observers. “The Fraunhofers are quite safe in their funding, longer term, with those three separate pots of money to take.”66 While Fraunhofer spokesmen emphasize the revenue derived from contract research, the sine qua non of the Fraunhofer model is a major and sustained investment of “core” public funds at the national and state level.67 In Germany, the “Fraunhofer, for a long period, across different governments, have maintained a very significant chunk of public money in the structure,” a reflection of the relative stability of the German political system.68\n\nThe Fraunhofer’s one-third, one-third, one-third model is not, as sometimes believed, an indicator that the private sector accounts for two-thirds or even one third of the institute’s revenue. Governments substantially outspend private industry with respect to the contract research which the Fraunhofer institutes perform, accounting for over 45 percent of the total, versus 39 percent for private industry. Moreover, a substantial part of “industry” funds are comprised of government grants and other funding raised by companies and paid to Fraunhofer for contract research.69 Table APP-A2-2 depicts the Fraunhofer’s revenues by source for the year 2010, the most recent year for which such information is publicly available. The figures indicate that federal and state spending accounted for 1,080 million Euros out of total revenue of 1,727 million Euros, or 62.5 percent of the total revenues.70 Private industry contributes about 26.3 percent of total Fraunhofer revenues. Even these figures\n\n________________\n\nBasic or core funding is provided by the federal and Länder governments in the form of grants which are not tied to any particular activity or expenditure on a 90/10 federal/state ratio. The Fraunhofer headquarters allocates nearly two-thirds of its basic funding to individual FhG institutes pursuant to a formula which creates an incentive for institutes to raise additional funding from the EU and from industry—e.g. the more external funding raised by the individual institute, the more basic funding it will receive from headquarters. Another ten percent of the basic funding is awarded to institutes on the basis of competitive bids for proposals to enter new research fields. 10 percent of the basic fund is used to purchase new equipment.72 The remaining 15 percent is retained by the FhG Executive Board for use for special projects and the opening of new institutes.73 In recent years, the Fraunhofer has been able to establish new research units with public economic stimulus funds from the federal government and the Länder, as well as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).74 The Fraunhofer also derives income from donations, which are tax-deductible like charitable contributions.75\n\nInfrastructure capital outlays are reported separately from Fraunhofer’s operating budget, which reports 143 million Euros in “current capital outlays.” This figure reflects investments in equipment and other fixed assets to maintain the operations of existing Fraunhofer units. Total capital outlays in 2011 were 379 million Euros (infrastructure capital outlays plus current capital outlays).\n\n________________\n\nThese projects frequently involve more than one Fraunhofer institute. Fraunhofer prices these contracts on the basis of the cost of running the project, plus a markup of about 15 percent, but the price does not include the historic costs incurred by the institutes to develop the knowledge used in the project. The price an individual institute charges for a working hour varies from institute to institute based on each organization’s cost structure, including infrastructure costs. The price is independent of the success or the failure of the final project. The Fraunhofer institutes are engaged in 6-8,000 industry contract research projects in any given year. The Fraunhofer institutes sign confidentiality agreements with its industry partners to protect their proprietary information.77 Some of these projects evolve into long-term strategic relationships between a company and a Fraunhofer institute, involving multi-stage collaborations over many years.\n\nThe Fraunhofer engages in collaborations with industry that extend beyond one-off contract research. Some technological challenges are sufficiently complex that they require multiple partners, and may engage numerous companies and Fraunhofer institutes. In some cases, Fraunhofer institutes perform contract research for industry associations.78 The Fraunhofer invests in and supports off-site R&D centers located on companies’ premises.79 It creates pilot manufacturing lines to permit the development and testing of processes in industry-relevant settings, reducing the risks associated with scaling-up of production.80 It forms joint ventures with companies.81 Pursuant to “special\n\n________________\n\ncooperation contracts,” companies can be given “guest” status at Fraunhofer institutes and operate their own laboratories and offices on the institutes’ premises.82 In 2005, the Fraunhofer entered into a public-private partnership with the U.S. semiconductor producer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Germany’s semiconductor maker Infineon to open the Center for Nanoelectric Technology (CNT) near Dresden, with the two companies assuming responsibility for operating the site.83 The Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI manufactures cell-based therapeutic products for pharmaceutical companies such as Northwest Biotherapeutics and Cognate BioServices Inc.84\n\nFraunhofer institutes are organized in parallel structures of thematic “research units” and “business units.” Contacts with industry are made by the business units, which are the point of entry into the Fraunhofer system. The business units’ expertise tends to lie in the area of potential applications and market potential of the technologies in which they specialize. When a company asks a business unit for technical help, the unit assesses the potential cost of the project, its business feasibility, and the terms under which the parities will work. The business units draw up a list of Fraunhofer research units from which assistance will be required, e.g. materials, software, packaging, equipment, and other specialties. While the business unit maintains relations with the industrial client, the research units are the point of contact for the project with university faculty, students, and laboratories.85\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises\n\nThe Fraunhofer’s core mission is to enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to gain timely access to scientific and technological innovation. Such companies typically have little or no internal research capability and must rely on external sources for such support. The Fraunhofer\n\n________________\n\nFIGURE APP-A2-2 Organization of Fraunhofer Institutes.\n\ninstitutes accept contract research and develop technological solutions for problems that SMEs cannot resolve themselves. The Fraunhofer also assists SMEs by bringing them into contact with broader research and financial communities that can support their development efforts. In 2008, Fraunhofer contract R&D projects involving firms with less than 1,000 employees accounted for 43 percent of the total. Nevertheless, some studies have observed that Fraunhofer institutes “tend to pursue longer-term R&D for larger corporations and have often had a difficult time reaching and serving SMEs”.86 The Fraunhofer’s figures for 2008 indicate that over two-thirds of its contract R&D for industry is conducted for firms of 250 or more employees.\n\nThe term Mittelstand is sometimes used to refer to all German SMEs, but it more accurately describes a subset of German SMEs “characterized by\n\n________________\n\nTABLE APP-A2-3 Fraunhofer Contract R&D by Company Size (2008) Number of Employees Percent of FhG Contract R&D 1-250 32.5 251-500 6.1 501-1000 4.4 1001-10,000 18.0 10,001-100,000 24.4 1000,000+ 14.6 SOURCE: Hellwig, Anke, “Fraunhofer: A Non-Profit Organization with Entrepreneurial Spirit,” 2011.\n\ncertain convictions and attitudes in the context of socio-economic and political processes.”87 These firms are typically family-owned businesses which have been doing business for many years, in some cases for five or six generations.88 Their leadership has a strong sense of social obligation and a close and paternalistic relationship with employees. They are deeply rooted in small towns and rural areas and less likely to engage in outsourcing or to move offshore.89 They tend to plan for the very long term based on the recognition that the enterprise was founded by family members and will be passed on to future generations. They commonly specialize in very specific niche product areas and in many cases have become globally dominant in those niches through a process of constant incremental improvements in their products and production methods.90\n\n________________\n\nThe Fraunhofer is widely viewed as an important element underlying the competitiveness of the Mittelstand.91 The actual proportion of Fraunhofer R&D that is directed toward projects involving Mittelstand is difficult to quantify, not only because the term “Mittelstand” is not well defined but also because these firms “are private and relish their obscurity,” and little information about specific Fraunhofer projects and the Mittelstand participants is made public.92 However, anecdotal information about individual companies indicates that the Fraunhofer can play an important role in sustaining their international competitiveness. Moreover, the innovation support provided by the Fraunhofer organization helps SMEs in the capital markets, enabling financial institutions to take a longer-term view of such companies.93\n\nRoth & Rau, located near Dresden, is an “archetypical” family-owned Mittelstand company. It employs about 1,100 workers and specializes in niche products and technology in photovoltaics, such as production machinery and coatings which are a requisite for solar panels. Roth & Rau’s management made a strategic decision that the company would not sell coated solar wafers as an end product. “What the company sells are the machines that make the coating process, and, equally important, the know-how to make the machines work.” A major market for the company is China and the management understands that the machines will be copied. “[The company] can't do anything about it. But they also know duplicating the precision-coating process isn't easy, and this has given them an estimated five-year jump on Chinese capability.” The key to “keeping the gap”, as a company executive explains, is innovation and continuous advances in the efficiency of production.94 To achieve this, Roth & Rau is “working closely with various Fraunhofer institutes.”95\n\n________________\n\nRoth & Rau employs over 100 research personnel, most of whom are based in its technology center in Hohenstein-Emstthal. “Fraunhofer’s research scientists and engineers are often to be found at this cutting-edge R&D facility,” reflecting the fact that the company “carries out joint projects with a variety of Fraunhofer institutes in a number of technical fields.”96 One example is a pilot line for processing and characterizing silicon wafer-based solar cells that operate in the company’s technology center in a collaboration with the Fraunhofer institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS. The purpose of this project is to develop new generations of processing equipment, to enhance crystalline standard cell technology and develop manufacturing technologies for high-efficiency cells.97 Roth & Rau also supplies industrial machinery to Fraunhofer itself.98\n\nLarge Companies\n\nGermany is home not only to the Mittelstand but to numerous globally-competitive large vertically integrated enterprises with strong ties to Germany’s major banks.99 While the Fraunhofer’s core mission is the provision of applied research support for small and medium enterprises, it derives a larger proportion of its contract research revenues from large companies. A 1987 French survey of the Fraunhofer observed that “the big industrialists do not hesitate to entrust [Fraunhofer] with very high level projects. Siemens, Daimler-Benz, VW are omnipresent in their labs.”100\n\n________________\n\nBox APP-A2-1\n\nMittelstand Niche Strategy\n\nCleanDieselCeramics GmbH is a medium-sized German maker of particulate filters for Diesel engines based in Grossrohrsdorf in Saxony. Stricter emissions standards which came into effect in 2011 will require retrofitting of existing Diesel engines. CleanDieselCeramics and the Fraunhofer Institute of Ceramic Technologies IKTS observed that the market for automobile particulate filters was a huge mass market involving millions of vehicles but that the market for certain specialized vehicles like construction machinery might be as small as 3000 units. Fraunhofer and CleanDieselCeramics concluded that there was “a gap in the market which basically involved developing a cost-effective manufacturing process that also works for small and medium scale quantities.” The company and the institute used a material patented at the Fraunhofer IKTS, a porous silicon carbide ceramic, and developed highly efficient ceramic diesel particulate filters for non-road applications. The parties also developed and refined a manufacturing process for the filters which was tested and perfected on a pilot production line at Fraunhofer IKTS. The company hired staff for its own production facility in Grossrohrsdorf who worked on the pilot line at the institute for six months, enabling them to bring their know-how to the company’s commercial production line.\n\nPublicly-funded Contract Research\n\nThe Fraunhofer receives public revenues for contract research which is linked to specific projects being undertaken for the federal government and the Länder. In some cases, these funds are augmented by EU funding. The Fraunhofer is prohibited from signing full confidentiality agreements with respect to these contracts, which may in some cases deter participation by the private sector. Publicly funded contract research undertaken by the Fraunhofer generally has commercial potential while serving broader public goals, such as public health, safety, and environmental protection.101\n\n________________\n\nBox APP-A2-2\n\nFraunhofer and Volkswagen\n\nFraunhofer has been involved with many of Germany’s leading companies in multiple projects of many years’ duration, which commonly lead into follow-on collaborations. The Fraunhofer has been working with Volkswagen, for example, on factory automation projects for decades.a Volkswagen established a subsidiary in Saxony, Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH in the early 1990s in the wake of German reunification. Fraunhofer concurrently established the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in Dresden and Chemnitz. Since then Volkswagen and Fraunhofer IWU have worked on a “whole series of joint research and development projects in the field of production engineering.” The Fraunhofer IWU Advisory Board has always included Volkswagen executives and the Advisory Board has been chaired by Professor Hochem Heizmann of Volkswagen since 2007.b In 2008, Volkswagen concluded an agreement with Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft to establish a joint “Center of Excellence for Automotive Production” in Chemnitz which would develop and test flexible resource-efficient production methods for automobiles.c The center has become an “integral part” of the Research Factory for Resource Efficient Production, a project jointly operated by Fraunhofer IWU, Volkswagen, and Audi. In 2002, the Land government of Saxony, Fraunhofer IWU and Volkswagen launched the Mechanical Engineering and Automotive Initiative (MAINE), which established an association comprised of Volkswagen plants in Saxony and about 20 automobile parts suppliers and engineering companies.d\n\n___________________\n\n________________\n\ncoordinates this project, which has involved themes such as residue-free engine manufacturing, fully automated laser welded car body manufacturing, development of lightweight construction components for the car body and powertrain, development of new techniques for manufacturing crank shafts and B-pillars, and machine system design and process development.

Current MAINE projects involve the development of innovative cutting and joining techniques for high strength steel, and incorporation of newly-developed techniques into mass production lines. “Mobility Made in Germany.” Fraunhofer Website. Op. Cit.\n\nEU-funded Research\n\nThe Fraunhofer Institutes derive a portion of their funding from European Union programs supporting R&D:\n\nFramework Program Seven (FP7): This program, the EU’s principal vehicle for funding research in Europe, provides grants for technological development and demonstration projects with “European value-added.”102 Grants extended under the Seventh Framework typically involve participants from other European Countries.103\n\nCompetitiveness and Innovation Framework Program (CIP): This program is designed to enhance competitiveness of small and medium enterprises through support of innovative activities.\n\nEurostars: The EUREKA Eurostars Program supports R&D by small and medium enterprises to develop new products, processes, and services.\n\nAlthough most EU funding for the Fraunhofer is linked to specific projects, one EU fund functions as a form of core funding which is used like federal/Land core funding to support research infrastructure. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF is a structural fund promoting investments in areas which have experienced economic decline which has supported Fraunhofer R&D projects in the former East Germany and economically\n\n________________\n\ndisadvantaged areas in Western Germany.104 In 2010, the ERDF allocated 57.2 million Euros for Fraunhofer research infrastructure investments. Fraunhofer maintains an office in Brussels and it is regarded as a formidable force in lobbying for EU funding.105\n\nInternally-funded Research\n\nFraunhofer “blue sky” research projects are entirely funded internally. The Fraunhofer-Zukunftsstifung (Fraunhofer Future Foundation) is a foundation which the institute established to use the large operating surplus that was generated from the success of the mp3 project. The foundation invests these funds in research projects that may not bring in revenues over the short run. These funds are allocated to individual FhG institutes through a competitive bidding process.106\n\nStaffing and Training\n\nThe Fraunhofer’s workforce has been growing substantially, a direct reflection of the growing number of research projects and contract volumes.\n\n________________\n\nBox APP-A2-3\n\nMarket-Oriented Strategic Preliminary Research\n\nIn addition, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft allocates “headquarters money” to projects that are estimated to be 2-3 years away from market application. This program, designated “Market-Oriented Strategic Preliminary Research (MAVO)”, draws on 10 percent of the institutes’ core public funding. The money is allocated from a “central pot” but individual institutes sometimes contribute some of their own funds. These projects, which may involve multiple institutes, are not expected to pay for themselves within a two year time frame, are seen as a way to induce FhG institutes to compete with each other in the development of new ideas with future potential as well as a mechanism for encouraging different FhG institutes to interact.a\n\n___________________\n\nHeadcount grew by 5,978 between 2007 and 2011, an increase of over 41 percent.\n\nFraunhofer Institutes are each staffed with an average of 300-400 people. There are exceptions to this pattern—the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), for example, reported a headcount of 1139 staff members in 2011.107 The institute’s permanent staff is a minority of the total workforce averaging 20-40 percent with most employees operating under various temporary employment contracts.108 The majority of the institute researchers are PhD students and post-docs who commit to work half-time at a Fraunhofer institute. While a few of these individuals become part of the institute’s core staff, most leave for positions in industry after 3-6 years, a turnover rate that\n\n________________\n\nsome German business partnering with the institute see as a negative.109 But on the positive side, Fraunhofer institutes function as large scale training centers for highly skilled industrial managers and workers:\n\nAs an employer, the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft offers a platform that enables its staff to develop the necessary professional and personal skills that will enable them to assume positions of responsibility within their institute, in industry and in other scientific domains.110\n\nNetworks\n\nThe Fraunhofer emphasizes the importance of networks in virtually all aspects of its operations, reflecting its view that competitive innovation increasingly requires collaborative efforts by numerous actors with specialized competencies acting in concert to achieve a common objective.111 German\n\n________________\n\nscientific disciplines in general are highly networked, and scientists are trained to cooperate and apply jointly for funding. A Fraunhofer scientist observes that it takes a major effort to set up collaboration networks, but once they are established they are a huge competitive advantage. He comments that “our experience of the U.S. is that there is a lot less collaboration by laboratories with each other and industry.”112 Companies that engage Fraunhofer for research tap into a rich university research network.113\n\nThe Fraunhofer institutes also form networks with each other, with the recognition that “coordinated competencies allow quick and flexible arrangements of research work on the requirements of different fields of application to answer actual and future challenges.”114\n\nFraunhofer has 23 “Fraunhofer alliances,” which are combinations of Fraunhofer institutes with expertise relevant to topical themes such as cloud computing, adaptronics, embedded systems, high-performance ceramics, and optic surfaces.115 The Fraunhofer plays a prominent role in international networks formed to address specific technological themes.116\n\n________________\n\n6,131 patents and registrations as of the end of that year.117 While the treatment of intellectual property rights is subject to negotiation when a research contract is concluded, it is the normal practice for Fraunhofer to retain patent and other intellectual property rights upon conclusion of a research project.118 Royalties and other income from IPR go to Fraunhofer headquarters, not individual institutes. Individual scientists responsible for developing patented technology receive 30 percent of the patent revenue.119 The industry partner or partners may receive an exclusive license, but only for the particular application that was the subject of the project. Fraunhofer remains free to license the technology to other companies for different applications. Future customers have access to Fraunhofer’s large patent portfolio which enhances the value of collaborations for companies and produces licensing revenues for the institutes.120 In recent years, Fraunhofer has placed a higher emphasis on intellectual property protection and exploitation, concentrated in areas of anticipated high revenues.121\n\nSpin-offs\n\nFraunhofer began promoting the systematic formation of spin-off companies in 1999 as a direct way to deliver technology developed internally to the marketplace.122 Currently, the Fraunhofer encourages the start-up of new companies from within its own institutes and continues to support these entities once they are launched.123 The Fraunhofer transfers some of its know-how to\n\n________________\n\nthese companies in return for a minority equity stake. It provides technical, managerial and operational support for the spin-offs through its program, “FFM—Fraunhofer Fosters Management.” Over half of the spin-offs have been in information technologies, microelectronics, and photonics.\n\nMost spinoffs are small-scale efforts involving one or two Fraunhofer employees.124 Fraunhofer spinoffs enjoy a high degree of success to the extent that success is defined as survival over the long run. Depending on the source, the success rate is somewhere between 65 and 90 percent.125 Whatever the actual figure, it is extraordinary in international terms. The failure rate for startups in the United States in the early 2000s was 90 percent.126 However, the high success rate may be an indicator that only spin-offs with a high probability of success are undertaken, suggesting an aversion to high risk endeavors.127\n\nInternational Operations\n\nIn the early 1990s the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft began making a concerted effort to establish foreign operations, a recognition that 85 percent of the global market for the most advanced technologies was located outside of Germany. While Germany was a global leader in a number of industries, such as chemicals and machinery, it trailed other countries in emerging technological areas such as information technology and biotechnology. Establishment of\n\n________________\n\nBox APP-A2-5\n\nRegional Innovation Clusters\n\nRegional innovation clusters: A major element of the German federal government’s high tech strategy is the creation of regional innovation clusters, and a number of Länder governments are pursuing their own cluster initiatives.a Pursuant to the “Pact for Research and Innovation,” the Fraunhofer assumed responsibility for conceptualizing and establishing innovation clusters. It is currently pursuing nineteen cluster initiatives in various parts of Germany. These typically involve one or more Fraunhofer Institutes, a local university, and a number of large and small industrial partners.b\n\noverseas institutes was seen as a way to bolster Germany’s position in those areas and to acquire technologies that would flow back to the parent institutes for application for the benefit of German industry.128 In 1994, Fraunhofer USA, Inc. was established in Rhode Island to manage a network of U.S. research centers, which has grown to six centers at present.129 In 2012, Fraunhofer\n\n________________\n\nunveiled plans to establish a Fraunhofer Center for Applied Photonics in strategic collaboration with the University of Strathclyde in the United Kingdom.130\n\nTHE FRAUNHOFER IN CONTEXT\n\nMost foreign observers who have studied the Fraunhofer in detail emphasize that it cannot be understood outside of the context in which it operates—that is, “the culture, history, and innovation infrastructures of Germany”—and that “an indiscriminate attempt to apply the model wholesale would be inadvisable even if it were practically possible and fiscally affordable.”131 Significantly in this regard, a number of Fraunhofer institutes have been established outside of Germany but “these have not achieved the success of the institutes in Germany.”132\n\nIn Germany the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft exists in a dense, knowledge-intensive, highly interconnected ecosystem of universities, institutes of applied research, technology intensive companies, and sophisticated trade and industrial associations. The roots of this system can be traced back for centuries, and reflect longstanding German traditions of craftsmanship, the relentless pursuit of academic excellence in the sciences and engineering, and systematic application of scientific knowledge in the commercial realm. Germany pioneered many of the practices which underpin today’s knowledge-based global economy, and until the early Twentieth Century was the acknowledged world leader in science and the translation of scientific knowledge into commercial products. Despite the massive discontinuity of the period 1914-50, the basic elements of the German scientific industrial system which emerged in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century are still observable in Germany today. “Despite the\n\n________________\n\npolitical regime breaks in 1933 and 1945 and the Second World War, the German [public research system] showed a high degree of institutional continuity.”133\n\nThe key elements of the German innovation system are a dual system of education and training which marries the development of academic and practical competencies; layered and decentralized governmental structures which support scientific research over long time horizons; an industrial tradition featuring the systematic application of science to the development and constant improvement of products and processes; and industrial and science organizations which promote rationalization, constrain competition in favor of collaboration, and facilitate the broad diffusion of technology. These elements of the German innovation system were in place long before the Fraunhofer first opened its doors in 1949, and the place which applied research institutes like Fraunhofer were expected to occupy within the system were well understood throughout German society by the time Fraunhofer was founded. Today, many well-educated Germans understand what Fraunhofer is, what it does, and where it fits in the German economic system. Foreign assessments of the German innovation system sometimes conclude that while German successes are admirable, German methods cannot readily be transplanted because of the singular character of the German system.134\n\nScientific and Technical Education\n\nGerman universities emerged as centers for “serious research and scholarship in science and technology long before their British and American counterparts.”135 In 1820, Justus von Liebig, a chemistry professor at the\n\n________________\n\nUniversity of Giessen, developed a teaching method based on a professor-supervised laboratory staffed by graduate students “which in many ways served as a model for laboratories ever since.”136 By the end of the Nineteenth Century, German universities were “providing the best technical and scientific training in the world.”137 German universities led in the development of systematic methods for acquiring and transferring scientific learning for practical applications in the medical and industrial spheres. In addition to the universities, Germany established numerous polytechnic universities, Technische Hochschulen, to train students for the specific purpose of employment by Germany industry.138\n\nIn the mid 19th, century, the states of southwestern Germany, notably Baden and Wurttemberg, concerned about the geographic dispersion of their large number of small, craft-oriented businesses in the face of industrialization, established decentralized networks of “formal, educationally-oriented, self-help institutions to disseminate information, technology and skill, thereby compensating local producers for the economic disadvantages of their regional social geography.”139 Baden was the first German state to implement a “Dual System” of vocational training with the establishment of a network of trade schools where education in utilitarian subjects such as algebra, geometry, free drawing, mechanics, and bookkeeping, taught by “instructors with practical experience in the trades they taught,” was paired with workplace apprenticeship. The institutions were linked to Baden’s institutions of higher learning, and in the latter Nineteenth Century, evolved into specialist schools (Fachschulen) designed to provide mid-level instruction in specific disciplines such as metalworking, engineering, and woodcutting.140 The speed and extent to which these schools improved the quality of local production “astounded” visiting German officials and led to “general acclaim” for Black Forest wood products at\n\n________________\n\nthe Chicago’s World Fair in 1893.141 Instead of disappearing as Germany industrialized, as was the case elsewhere, the region’s small artisanal businesses adopted modern production methods, developed products of extremely high quality and as their social status rose, began referring to themselves as “middle class” (Mittelstand).”142 By the early Twentieth Century the states of southwestern Germany had established networks of training schools that astonished visitors from abroad.143 In 1897 the Handiwork Protection Law was enacted in the German Empire, extending the institutional practices developed in Baden and Wurttemberg to the Empire as a whole, and creating the “cornerstone” of the German vocational training system.144\n\nThe foundation of the German Empire in 1871 accelerated industrialization and urbanization and gave rise to increased demand for scientific knowledge. Because within the Empire the states jealously defended their control over the universities, the central government concentrated on establishing non-university research facilities and projects including a number of\n\n________________\n\nsignificant mission-oriented research organizations.145 By 1900 Prussia and Saxony alone had over 300 technical institutes.146\n\nIn 1911 the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (KWG) was formed to promote research in the natural sciences. Established as a private association, the KWG derived most of its funding from private sources but the Prussian government contributed building, land and salaries for the directors of the institutes.147 Between its founding in 1911 and 1948, the KWG supported the establishment of 35 research organizations, which included some of the most important and prestigious academic institutes in the world.148 The Institutes were a source of trained scientific and engineering talent, but also a source of scientific and technical knowledge for German industry, a linkage which “was much closer in Germany than in Britain, where it rarely existed at all, and even in the United States, where at the turn of the century, the process was just beginning.”149\n\nEducation and Industrialization\n\nFredrich List, a native of Wurttemburg, was a German economist who developed and espoused a series of proposals to enable Germany to overtake England in industrial development. His 1841 book, The National System of Political Economy, is widely regarded as the first articulation of the concept of national systems of innovation.150 He advocated protection of infant industries and a broad array of economic development policies, most of which “were concerned with learning about new technology and applying it.” Due to List’s advocacy as well as that of other economists, “Germany developed the best technical education and training systems in the world [which was] one of the\n\n________________\n\nmain factors in Germany overtaking Britain in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century and to this day is the foundation for the superior skills and higher productivity of the German labour force.”151\n\nIn 1800, Germany was still a disaggregated array of over 300 states, principalities, free cities and other jurisdictions, many of them entirely independent. Although Germany was unified in 1871, individual states (now known as Länder) have retained considerable power under a succession of federal governments down to the present day. The concept of states’ rights remains “more deeply imprinted upon German life than upon American.” The legacy of political fragmentation “underlies the intricate federal-state relationship that regulates and nurtures the veritable forest of research institutions that dot the German landscape.”152\n\nIn addition to Baden and Wurttemburg, other state governments played a key role in fostering German industrialization. Prussia, the largest German state, implemented a series of sweeping economic, administrative and social reforms in the wake of its defeat by Napoleon in 1806. One of the officials who was instrumental in Prussian reforms, G.J.C. Kunth, presided over a number of government bodies promoting manufacturing technology, including the acquisition of information about foreign machines.153 Kunth’s legacy was carried forward by his principal assistant, Peter Beuth, who became the head of Prussia’s Department of Trade of the Ministry of the Interior, a post which he held from 1818 until 1845.154 Beuth’s entire career was dedicated to the modernization of Prussian industry. During Beuth’s tenure, with extensive\n\n________________\n\ngovernment support, Prussia acquired what one scholar characterized as the “Alpha and the Omega of modern machine-building,” British machine tool technology developed in the first decades of the Nineteenth Century, which enabled the design and construction of metal-working precision machinery for all other industries.” “The transfer of [machine tool] technology promoted and coordinated by the Prussian state was highly successful,” and this “set Prussia (later Imperial Germany) well on the road to overtaking Britain.”155\n\nGermany’s principal technology-based industries, chemicals, machinery automobiles and electrical engineering were all established in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries. The modern chemical industry was created by three German firms, Hoechst, Bayer, and BASF, “one of the most impressive achievements in the annals of industrial history.”156 In the latter decades of the Nineteenth Century, these firms created the world's first large scale industrial laboratories dedicated to systematic research to develop new products and industrial processes. The industrial labs established close ties with leading research organizations. The laboratories transferred technology to the chemical firms’ industrial complexes. The industrial labs recruited managerial talent including a general staff headed by doctoral level chemists:\n\nIn this way, they were the pioneers not only in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries but also in shaping the management organization of modern high technology enterprises.157\n\nIn the 1880s, these firms revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry by developing a wide range of medicines from coal-tar feed-stocks, dyestuffs, and intermediates, including synthetic sedatives, painkillers, fever depressants, vaccines, and serums.158 The in-house R&D laboratory “also emerged in other industries which had the same need to access the results of basic research from\n\n________________\n\nuniversities and other research institutes and to develop their own new products.”159\n\nNetworks\n\nAs Germany industrialized, companies forged vast networks of interfirm ties, leading to the characterization “organized capitalism.” Industrial sectors were linked by professionally staffed and well-financed associations:\n\na tight weave of branch and regional associations crisscrossed the entire country, bringing together at the national level producers of similar goods and linking at the regional level producers of various goods who operated within the same geographical area. Furthermore, a plethora of special purpose business associations provided still additional links between the components of big business.160\n\nImperial Germany had no laissez faire tradition and its commercial culture differed sharply from that of the North Atlantic world dominated by English legal and economic traditions and philosophy161. Contracts restraining trade were enforceable in German courts, and German industrial leaders believed that it was not only their right, but their social obligation, to combine to\n\n________________\n\nrestrain destructive competition.162 By the early Twentieth Century every major German industrial sector was organized into one or more Kartells (cartels), which were integral to German industrial organization. Despite an effort by the Allied occupation to break up the web of cartels and associations after World War II, many aspects of the “organized capitalism” of Wilhelmine Germany have been carried forward into the modern federal republic.163\n\nWar and Occupation\n\nIt is difficult to overstate the damage which occurred to Germany’s science-industrial base between the onset of World War I and the end of the Allied occupation at the end of World War II. World War I severed Germany from overseas sources of oil and saw the expropriation of German petroleum assets, effectively ending efforts to build a world class oil and petrochemical industry.164 The Treaty of Versailles imposed restrictions on German scientific research, reflecting the role played by German science in the First World War in the development of chemical weapons and other technologies supporting the war effort. The hyperinflation of the 1920s destroyed the endowments of the KWG and similar research organizations. Economic dislocation and the burden of war reparations deprived German industry of the levels of equity capital needed to commercialize new technologies on a mass basis. The rise of Hitler to power saw a massive increase in public investment in infrastructure and industry and under the leadership of the Reich Research Council, founded in 1937, academic research was mobilized to support the war effort, and yielded dramatic new technologies, including jet aircraft, nerve gas, stealth technology, hardened armor, ballistic missiles, radar, and synthetic materials such as nylon and synthetic fuels. However, the Nazi regime’s anti-Semitic policies led to an exodus of Jewish scientists, decimating the faculties of German universities and research institutes. German science was deeply involved in horrific crimes committed by the regime, tarnishing its reputation for decades afterward.165\n\n________________\n\nAnglo-American bombing severely damaged German industry, although by no means destroyed it.\n\nThe Allied Occupation of Germany at the end of World War II inflicted further harm on Germany’s science-industrial infrastructure. Research bans were placed on sectors such as aviation and rocket propulsion in which German science enjoyed a strong position, setting back the country’s long run prospects in these fields. The U.S.-led “Project Paperclip” identified thousands of the most talented German scientists and removed them to the United States, while the Soviets forcibly relocated German scientists found in their occupation zone.166 Berlin, the traditional center of German science, was divided between Allied occupation zones and marooned in what would become a Soviet puppet state, the German Democratic Republic. German factories in the Russian Zone were dismantled and shipped to the East, along with management and staff.167 Between 1947 and 1950, the British pursued a similar program of industrial dismantlement in the Ruhr 168. The American authorities mounted a “de-cartelization” effort which broke up industrial combinations and trade associations in an effort aimed at “rooting out German-style organized capitalism and replacing it with the idealized version of the American free-market system envisioned by Thomas Jefferson” 169. German industrialists were aghast at deconcentration measures that “dismantled hundreds of viable plants, disrupted supply networks, and broke many of the links between the agricultural and industrial sectors.” “Many Germans saw the Allied controls as even more oppressive than the Nazis,” and those measures contributed to the subsequent German “atmosphere in which enthusiasm for state intervention was quite limited.”170\n\nDespite the massive discontinuities of the period 1914-50, the German innovation system reestablished itself in the immediate aftermath of World War II with a remarkable degree of continuity with respect to pre-1914 institutions\n\n________________\n\nand norms.171 The KWG research institutes were reformed under the designation Max-Planck Society. The dual system of education/apprenticeship reemerged more as by habit than by central direction.172 German training institutions, “turned out to be incredibly resilient in the face of huge exogenous shocks of the sort we might expect to disrupt previous patterns and prompt dramatic institutional innovation.”173 German industry regrouped in networks of associations, “cartel-like arrangements,” and industrial combinations linked by a maze of interlocking directorates and cross-shareholdings involving banks and insurance companies.174\n\nEmergence of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft\n\nThe creation of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft was part of a post-war effort by the state of Bavaria to capitalize on the Allied dismemberment of Prussia and to “lure research and engineering talent from Prussia’s main agglomeration of science and technology activities which was in Berlin.”175 Bavarian politics in the half century after the end of World War II were dominated by the Christian Socialist Union (CSU), a party that was deeply conservative yet committed to the promotion of science, education, and technologically-advanced industries. The Bavarian government invested heavily\n\n________________\n\nin its universities and technical schools “but what set…Bavaria apart was its concentration of non-teaching research facilities,” principally the Max-Planck Institute and the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.176 Bavaria methodically lured eminent scientists and technology-intensive industries to the Munich region. The Max Planck Institute moved from Berlin to Munich in 1949.177 By the 1960s, such efforts had “created the synergy to transform Munich into a Mecca of German science.”178\n\nThe Fraunhofer Gesellschaft was established in Munich in March 1949 as a non-profit organization tasked with raising funds from governmental bodies to support industrial research projects.179 It was created under the leadership of the Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs Hugo Geiger, who wanted to promote applied research in the state.180 At a 1948 meeting convened by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs comprised of local leaders in science and research, the notion of a broad applied research organization was agreed, with a mission of identifying research topics in various subject areas, mediating between university research and industry, and securing and managing research funding. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft was formally launched at a March 26, 1949 meeting hosted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs which convened over 200 eminent Bavarian scientists, economists and political leaders.181\n\n________________\n\nThe Fraunhofer struggled in its early years. Initially, Fraunhofer’s main functions were administrative—it raised funds from government organizations, donors and association members for distribution to research projects relevant to industry. The German Federal Ministry of Economics formally recognized it in 1952 as the “third pillar in the German research infrastructure” alongside the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, the German Research Council), but it met with resistance and competition from established research organizations.182 Originally largely limited to geological surveys, it was ridiculed as “the Bavarian Research Association for Mining.” The organization’s first president, Gerlach, was a basic scientist who disdained applied research, and as a result, was pressured into resignation by the Fraunhofer Senate in 1951.183\n\nThe Fraunhofer survived its shaky beginning largely as a result of public support. In 1951, it successfully applied to the German federal government for Marshall Plan funding pursuant to the European Recovery Program.184 With the institute on the brink of liquidation in 1954, the Land government of Bavaria, which had theretofore provided “more ideological than material support,” began direct funding to Fraunhofer, although the initial amount was characterized as “enough to prevent death, but not enough to sustain life.”185 In 1954, however, Fraunhofer received additional support from the Land government of Baden-Wurttemburg to establish what was to become the institute’s first contract research organization, the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Microscopy, Photography, and Cinematography (IMPIC).186 Finally, in 1956, Fraunhofer began to receive contract research funding from the newly-created Ministry of Defense, which for historical reasons preferred to outsource\n\n________________\n\nits defense-related R&D.187 For many years afterward, “military funding accounted for more than half of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft’s total research budget.”188 The defense research work was critical in the development of Fraunhofer not only because of the revenue it generated but because it enabled the institute to develop the research infrastructure and resources to “develop promising ideas and lines of research to a level where they could be converted into innovative products and processes and offered to firms.”189\n\nIn 1965, the German Science Council, an influential advisory body to the federal and Länder governments, recommended a broad expansion of non-academic research organizations in general and the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in particular as the umbrella organization for applied research.190 The recommendation was conditioned on the implementation of structural reforms and the creation of a substantial development program for the institutes. In 1967, a recommendation by the Science Council “paved the way for incorporation of the Fraunhofer Society in the institutional funding of the BMwF and a Science Council commission studying the Fraunhofer concluded that “promotion of applied research with public means” was necessary for “ensuring the technological development in the FRG.”191 The Fraunhofer grew explosively after it began receiving federal institutional funding. The number of Fraunhofer institutes doubled in the decade 1965-1975. Its budgets grew steadily, enabling it to establish new institutes and modernize existing ones.192\n\n________________\n\nAs the German “economic miracle” (Wirtschaftswunder) began to accelerate, Fraunhofer succeeded in attracting significant funding from industry for contract research.193 Hermann von Siemens, CEO of Siemens AG, assumed the presidency of the Fraunhofer in 1955, a post which he held for nearly a decade. Thereafter Fraunhofer added 1-2 new institutes per year, gradually extending a network of research organizations across West Germany. In 1973, Fraunhofer received the status of a federal research organization and began receiving funding from the BMFT, now the BMBF.194 Beginning in the early 1970s the Fraunhfer made a phased shift in emphasis away from military R&D toward civilian applications.195\n\nThe Fraunhofer has grown not only by opening greenfield institutes but by absorbing institutes affiliated with other research organizations. In 1970 it took over an organization originally formed in 1930 as the Prussian Institute for Wood Research, which was rebranded as the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research WKI.196 In 1971, it acquired the Max-Planck Institute for Silicate Research in Wurtzburg, which became the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC.197 In 1991, in the wake of German reunification, numerous research organizations based in former East Germany were absorbed into Fraunhofer.198 In 2001, Fraunhofer acquired 8 research institutes of the German National Research Center for Information Technology (GMD) a move that was backed by the German research ministry but bitterly resisted by the GMD’s management and staff, who believed (correctly) that integration with Fraunhofer would orient GMD away from basic research and towards applied research.199\n\n________________\n\nBox APP-A2-7\n\nBavaria—From Rural Backwater to Germany’s Silicon Valley\n\nToday Bavaria’s heavy and sustained investments in science, education, and industrial promotion—prominent among which was support for the Fraunhofer—appear prescient. By the first decade of the Twenty-First Century, Bavaria had become one of the pre-eminent high technology regions in the world, and was widely characterized as “Germany’s Silicon Valley.”a The German company with the most patents, Siemens, was headquartered in Munich and virtually all of Germany’s top 20 patentees were either based in Munich (Infineon, BMW), operated research institutes in the city, or were involved in research collaborations with one of Munich’s research institutes. The greater Munich region was the site of 10 Fraunhofer institutes, 11 Max-Planck institutes, 11 universities, and 17 polytechnics. Bavaria’s Fraunhofer institutes include one of the largest, the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, with 450 employees operating at sites in Nuremburg, Furth, and Erlangen.b High tech manufacturing accounted for over half of the employment and nearly two-thirds of the revenues generated by the Bavarian manufacturing sector. In 2005, Bavaria had the highest number of start-ups in Germany, accounting for one-fifth of the total in 2005.c “Even though the Czech border is just 300 km from Munich, companies stay in the high-cost Bavarian capital because of their dependence on the highly-trained staff and world class facilities.”d\n\nmodern world. These include the designs and thinking of Werner von Siemens in electric power generation (which included the very idea that electricity could be a power source); the Diesel and Otto cycle internal combustion engines; and the discovery of aspirin and other pharmaceutical substances in the world’s first\n\nlarge-scale industrial laboratories200. Although the modern day Federal Republic can cite many economic and technological achievements, it has generated no obvious innovations comparable to the revolutionary achievements of Germany’s industrial and scientific heyday. Instead the German innovation system has built on the strong position it achieved over a century ago with continuous incremental improvement of products and process in the automobile, engineering, machinery, electric power, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. It remains highly competitive in all of those sectors today, in contrast to a number of other industrialized countries.\n\nThe German innovation model in general, and the Fraunhofer’s approach, in particular, do not offer the prospect of radical, paradigm-shattering technologies. They do, however, demonstrate that a high cost, high wage country can compete effectively in global markets in established industries through the systematic and continuous application of knowledge—without necessarily moving production processes offshore. The Fraunhofer represents a vast knowledge system which a company of any size can commission to perform commercially-relevant research at below-market cost, with a high degree of assurance in the quality of the research and the associated business counseling. Fraunhofer projects appear to involve less bureaucracy, faster time-to-market, and greater probability of success than pursuit of government research grants by individual companies. Participation in Fraunhofer research projects exposes companies to highly qualified and motivated students and employees who can be recruited. The Fraunhofer makes its technology and business networks available to its industrial partners, a benefit small companies, in particular, usually cannot replicate on their own.\n\nThe Fraunhofer spins off new companies and assists other start-ups, but it is unclear whether on a net basis it fosters or inhibits the kind of start-ups that grow into world class companies in the United States. A prominent German academic commented in 2012 that Fraunhofer “kills start-ups. It offers services that should be provided by private companies. It thwarts individual activities.”201 While the Fraunhofer itself would undoubtedly dispute the assertion, it performs tasks in Germany that might be undertaken by entrepreneurs in some other economies. In most collaborations the Fraunhofer—a large parapublic institution—owns the intellectual property, rather than a small business or university, arguably acting as an inhibition on innovation, particularly that of a paradigm-breaking variety.\n\nThe Fraunhofer is an important member in the group of parapublic non-university research organizations that has gradually been displacing German universities as sites for scientific research. German universities are suffering\n\n________________\n\nfrom numerous problems including shortages of funds, overcrowding, and a reputation for mediocrity—and as The Economist noted in 2009, the universities “would do better if research at non-university institutes like the Max-Planck Society were brought into academia, adding teaching to research.”202 Organizations representing the interests of German universities have urged restraint in the establishment of non-university research organizations for many years based on the “concern that universities will fall back in the resource competition with non-university institutions.”203 Non-university research organizations like Fraunhofer exert a gravitational pull on individuals who might otherwise become or remain members of university faculties because they offer relief from teaching obligations and the need to pursue grant funding independently, superior equipment and research infrastructure, and the chance to make money on innovations which they originate. Recognizing the risk of a wholesale “emigration of research” from universities to non-university research organizations, the German Science Council has sought to encourage close collaborations between universities and non-university research institutions—a phenomenon which has been developed to a very high level in the Fraunhofer.\n\nFinally, the Fraunhofer model might not work in the United States because the industrial and scientific milieu is substantially different than Germany. Systematic application of new technology in factories may prove more difficult in situations where the work force has not undergone a long apprenticeship process, has a more fragile allegiance to a particular company, and may be demoralized as a result of falling wages and benefits, downsizing, offshoring, and labor-management strife. While the United States has many innovative small and medium businesses, the proportion that possesses the peculiar structure, traditions, discipline, and values of the Mittelstand is probably relatively small. Competition at every level of the U.S. innovation system is more intense and destabilizing than is the case in Germany, and complicates efforts at network-building and collaborations. Perhaps most importantly, the ability and willingness of federal and state governments to provide a stable source of long-term public funding to non-university institutes of applied research is highly questionable.\n\nWhatever the obstacles to a literal implementation of the Fraunhofer model in the United States, the United States has adopted and adapted other German institutional innovations ranging from Kindergarten to the modern university research laboratory system, and it would appear that limited aspects of the German system could be adopted in this country. While the United States will not replicate Germany’s Dual System of vocational education, the enlightened expression of that system at the high end of the educational ladder in the Fraunhofer institutes, featuring concurrent academic study and applied\n\n________________\n\nindustrial research, could be more broadly incorporated in university curricula in collaboration with local industry. The Fraunhofer funding model, which locks in public funding on a virtually permanent basis is an obvious factor underlying the institute’s achievements, could be put in place for a U.S. system of institutes of applied public research, although this may seem improbable in the current impasse over government spending. The Fraunhofer has refined technology networking to what it regards as a higher level than U.S. counterparts, and the adoption of the institutes’ techniques should be studied by U.S. research organizations.\n\nFrom an American perspective, the German experience is also of interest because like the United States, Germany is a federal system. Some aspects of German federalism would never be considered attractive in the United States such as the interlocking of state-federal responsibilities in a manner which limits the ability of each to act independently of the other. However, in Germany, the Länder have often functioned as laboratories in which institutional innovations have been implemented which, when demonstrated to be successful, have been adopted at the national level. The states of southwestern Germany pioneered the Dual System of education and practical training which was embraced nationally with the enactment of the Handicraft Protection Law of 1897. The Prussian initiative which established the first Kaiser Wilhelm institute eventually led to the creation of a nationwide network of parapublic research organizations. A similar initiative by Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemburg in the 1950s culminated in the creation of the nationwide network of Fraunhofer institutes. The successful postwar efforts by Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemburg to promote education and research and attract technology-intensive industries finds a current expression at the federal level in the form of initiatives to create innovation clusters on a nationwide basis. There is no readily apparent reason why the U.S. federal system could not be used to explore institutional innovations in applied research at the state level with potential for national policy.\n\nFrom the broadest U.S. perspective, the Fraunhofer system represents a major public investment by Germany in applied research with short-run commercial relevance. The positive effects of that investment over the long run, as manifested in the international competitive performance of German industry, are undeniable. In the U.S. government investments in commercially-oriented research are commonly controversial in the short run and politically unsustainable over the long run. But against the background of an economic environment which has seen the erosion and offshoring of traditional industries in the face of global competition, some elements of the German innovation system merit consideration by U.S. policymakers."
