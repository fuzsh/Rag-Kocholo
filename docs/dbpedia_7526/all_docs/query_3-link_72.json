        "text": "Hugo Erfurth (1874â€“1948)\n\nHugo Erfurth (1874-1948) was a German photographer known for his portraits of prominent figures in the early 20th century, particularly in the fields of art, literature and politics. He was born in Halle on 14 February 1874. Erfurth studied art in Dresden and Munich before establishing himself as a photographer. He opened his own studio in Dresden in 1901 and gained recognition for his distinctive photographic style. Erfurth's portraits were characterised by a focus on the personality of his subjects and a preference for natural lighting. Throughout his career, Erfurth photographed a wide range of notable personalities, including artists, writers and intellectuals. His subjects included the playwright Gerhart Hauptmann, the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. He also captured images of prominent figures in German society, such as politicians and industrialists. Hugo Erfurth's work is considered important not only for its artistic merit, but also for its historical significance in documenting the cultural and intellectual life of early 20th century Germany. He continued his photographic work until his death on 19 February 1948 in Baden-Baden."
