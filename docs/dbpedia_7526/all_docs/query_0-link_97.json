        "text": "Sibylle Bergemann spent 11 years photographing the construction of a Marx and Engels monument that still stands at the Palace of the Republic here. The bronze statue, now a brisk tourist site, was finally erected in 1986, three years before the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nMs. Bergemann's moody black-and-white images of the Marx and Engels figures, which were photographed in pieces as they awaited transportation from the Baltic island Usedom, appear to be shrouded or sheared in half. Today the images have become emblems of the dismantling of the former German Democratic Republic, with viewers assuming that the photos are of a monument's destruction, not its birth.\n\nSeveral of her photos are included in an ambitious 400-work retrospective, ''Art in the G.D.R.,'' which has struck a chord in Berlin, with more than 100,000 visitors since it opened in July. The exhibition spans a half-century and collectively expresses a haunted vision of the collapsed totalitarian state. Yet on the occasion of the 13th anniversary of German reunification on Oct. 3, East Germans are still grappling with a sense of loss: not the loss of the tyrannical police state but of the intimate customs and rituals that disappeared in the new Germany.\n\nMs. Bergemann is one of a handful of artists in the show whose work has spilled into the kitsch domain of ''Ostalgie'' because of unintended symbolism. ''Ostalgie'' is the coinage of Ost (East) and the German word for nostalgia. Ostalgie is a phenomenon of memory, a desire to collect and obsess on things that vanished following the reunification of Germany. While Ostalgie is not new to East Germans, it is contagious and has only recently spread to West Germans, primarily the young, who have become fascinated by the history of a Germany they know little about.\n\nThe artifacts are many: Rötkappchen, the one sparkling wine made in East Germany, perfect for every anniversary; the Trabant, the car East Germans aged waiting for; Berlin Cosmetics, the only lipstick for your first date. It seems paradoxical that a few commercial products -- hard to come by, bartered and coveted -- and some kitsch ornaments have become the revered symbols of a dead society, but there is not much else left to remember the good times by.\n\n''There was an intimacy to East German life that no longer exists, and cliques were quite tight,'' said Alexander Mackat, whose advertising agency in Berlin concentrates on East Germans. Informing and spying for the state just made the cliques tighter, he added.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
