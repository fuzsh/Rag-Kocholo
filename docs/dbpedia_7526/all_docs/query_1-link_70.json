Her art is being shown in numerous European museums and galleries. Her satirical exhibition „FEINKOST ADAM©“ 2002 in the Jewish Museum of Fürth incited an international controversy. Her latest project the Happy Hippie Jew Bus, is a colorful rolling classroom teaching about Jewish life. The bus can be found on marketplaces, universities, schools. The project exposes and overcomes cliches of Jews and Jewish life in a playful and creative manner.

Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewry had not only influenced the various local Jewish communities in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, called the Kingdom of Yugoslavia since 1929, but also the social, economic and cultural development of the southern Slavic country. Jewish painters, architects, musicians and actors made outstanding contributions to the cultural scene. Many female Jewish artists such as the dancer Riki Levi, the theater actress Lea Deutsch or the photographer Elvira Kohn were at the peak of their career in the interwar period, which came to an abrupt end with the dismantling of the multinational state. This is one of the reasons why it is difficult to reconstruct their lives today.\n\nback to the top\n\n“The Woman in the House of God” Revisited – Hartmut Bomhoff (Berlin, Germany)\n\n“I can claim that women have gained themselves their right to vote in community\n\nelections, and that we have achieved this through peaceful means,” wrote Bianka\n\nHamburger (1877‒1942) in 1926. Hamburger, the first female member of the Board\n\nof Representatives of the Jewish Community of Berlin, was one of the ten\n\nparticipants of a symposium entitled “Die Frau im Gotteshaus”, (“The Woman in the\n\nHouse of God)” which was hosted by the Vereinigung für das liberale Judentum in\n\nDeutschlands (Association for Liberal Judaism in Germany) in fall 1926, two years\n\nafter Regina Jonas had enrolled herself at the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des\n\nJudentums. It is widely assumed that Jonas pursued her rabbinical ordination in\n\n1935 on her own accord, with the British Reform leader Lily Montagu, who in 1928\n\ndelivered the first sermon ever given by a woman from the pulpit of a German\n\nsynagogue, being a catalyst to enhance women’s participation inside the sanctuary.\n\nA close reading of the proceedings of the 1926 symposium, however, gives us the\n\nopportunity to put the story of Regina Jonas in a wider context.\n\nApparently in response to the development in the German Protestant Church, in\n\nwhich women became candidates for preaching positions in 1925, more and more\n\nJewish lay leaders discussed not only the role of women in community and\n\nsynagogue governance but also of women in the rabbinate: Of the seven women\n\nwho had a say in the symposium, four especially raised the possibility of women\n\nrabbis. In my presentation, I will introduce the ten agents of change who contributed\n\nto the symposium and discuss their approach to issues of leadership and authority as\n\nwell as their impact on creating alternatives for Jewish women in Weimar Germany\n\nand beyond. I will be happy to put an emphasis on the educator and local politician\n\nPaula Ollendorf (1884‒1938), whose achievements are so closely connected with\n\nBreslau, and the rabbi of the liberal synagogue of Breslau, Rabbi Dr. Hermann\n\nVogelstein (1870‒1942).\n\nHartmut Bomhoff M.A. serves as Communications Officer of the Abraham Geiger\n\nCollege as well as a Research Assistant at the School of Jewish Theology at the\n\nUniversity of Potsdam. He is the editor-in-chief of the Jewish Voice from Germany. In\n\n2015 he authored together with Rabbi Andreas Nachama and Rabbi Walter Homolka\n\nan introduction into Judaism, Basiswissen Judentum, and organized an international\n\nconference to mark the 80th anniversary of the ordination of Rabbi Regina Jonas,\n\n“The Role of Women’s Leadership in Faith Communities.”\n\nback to the top\n\nKol Isha: The Voice of Women Rabbis in Contemporary Jewish Life (Women Rabbis in the Pulpit: A collection of Sermons) – Rabbi Barbara Borts (UK)\n\nLast year at the Bet Deborah Conference, I was challenged to publish a collection of my sermons. But, as it was the year of the 80th anniversary of the ordination of Regina Jonas, and the 40th anniversary of the ordination of Jacky Tabick, first women rabbi in the UK, I decided to ask all women to participate in publishing our sermons and asked my colleague Elizabeth Tikvah Sara to co-edit this book with me. In speaking about the collection at various conferences and synagogues, I have had the opportunity to reflect on what Jewish life is like since the voices of women have been added to the chorus, and what issues still confront us.\n\nback to the top\n\nOn the Liturgical Periphery: Music, Gender, Power, and Cross-Cultural Negotiations in Women’s Rosh Chodesh Services – Miranda Crowdus (Hanover, Germany)\n\nMy paperwillexplore the possibilities for musical participation in women’s Rosh Chodesh (New Month) services and partnership minyanim, both in Europe and internationally, in orthodox Jewish contexts. This phenomenon remains relatively unexplored by academic scholarship perhaps due to a normative focus on reformed/liberal movements and due to the diversity of the women’s groups being eclipsed by an emphasis on gender inequality, rather than on the nuances of the musical liturgy. However, current communities of religious Jewish women’s musical practice are loci of major intercultural-musical exchanges, significantly influencing the musical and religious experience of individuals. My paper will critically examine how orthodox Jewish women negotiate communal identity on the periphery of the traditional orthodoxy, suggesting new ways to build fields of critical interdisciplinary scholarship on Jewish women and the arts, characterized by the complexity of contact and practice.\n\nMiranda Crowdus is an ethnomusicologist and writer residing in Hanover, Germany. She recently completed her PhD at City University London, which focused on musical practices in the complex urban environment of South Tel Aviv, Israel. She is currently a Research Associate at the European Centre for Jewish Music at the Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media, working on original research and expanding the new MA programme in Jewish Music Studies.\n\nback to the top\n\nThe female muscle-jew: The gender-transgressing potential ofJewish Sports Associations – Sarah Egger (Vienna, Austria)\n\nMuscle Judaism was a clearly masculinized ideal coined by the zionist doctor Max Nordau in the early twentieth century. It could be achieved by joining a Jewish Sports Association and transforming the Jewish body. But no matter how masculine the ideal, there were many Jewish women joining these Associations. What were the issues that moved them in their lives as sportswomen? How did they find their place within the ideal of muscular judaism? This presentation gives an introduction to the emancipatory and gender-transgressing potentials of Jewish Sports Associations in the early 20th century.\n\nSarah Egger BTh, C.E.O. oft he Coordinating Committee of Jewish-Christian Cooperation in Austria, Born 1992 in Vienna, June 2010: High School Exams, Working at the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Conference 2010, 2010-2015: Studying Protestant Theology at the University of Vienna, 2012: Study Assistant at the Institute for New Testament Studies, 2012-2015: Organizing the lecture series AGORA of the Forum for World Religions, 2013-2014: Office Assistant at the Forum for World Religions, 2014-2015: Organizing the lecture- and discussion series „Homosexuality and Christian Faith“ at the University of Vienna, 2014-2015: Study Assistant at the Institute for the Science of Religions, January 2015: Finished study as Bachelor of Theology, Since then: Gender Studies (Master) at the University of Vienna, Since September 2015 C.E.O. of theCoordinating Committee of Jewish-Christian Cooperation in Austria\n\nback to the top\n\nMiracle in Cracow (2004) – Diana Groó (Budapest, Hungary)\n\nThe debut film of Diana Groó co-produced with Poland in 2004(in English, Hungarian, Polish, and Yiddish, with English subtitles) follows a young Budapest Jew named Piotr (Maciej Adamczyk) who has become obsessed with a book of magic his grandmother tried to hide from the Nazis. He traces it to Krakow, where a young woman named Eszter (Eszter Bíró) is using it at the grave of a rabbi. Piotr steals the book, but his feelings about Eszter begin to complicate his plans. The film beautifully depicts the old Jewish quarter of Krakow.\n\nDiana Groó, filmdirector, received her education in Budapest, obtaining a Bachelor’s degree inFrench-Hebrew from the Faculty of Arts, ELTE, followed by a Master’s in TV and Film Directing, at the Department of Film and Television Directing at the Hungarian Film Academyin 2000. Co-founder of Katapult film studio (2002) and Duna Dock (2013).\n\nAfter her prize winning shorts and documentaries, her debut feature film was A Miracle in Cracow, a Central European Jewish magic tale, in Polish-Hungarian coproduction in 2004. Her documentary What lies ahead about disabled children of the Hungarian Pető Institute, was awarded by the Jury of Verzio 4 Int. Human Rights Doc. Filmfestival in 2005. Her second feature film Vespa (2010) /a roadmovie of a Romani teenager/, awarded by Unicef and the Dialog Prize for Intercultural Communication in Cottbus, got the Best Director’s award in Geneva and Los Angeles. Her “Wild Imagination” art-history series, presenting the art of Marc Chagall, August Renoir, Pieter Bruegel and Henri Rousseau opened the contemporary art exhibition of Herzlya Muzeum in Israel in 2005. The “Intervisual Media program between Painting&Cinema” at Haifa University, involved the series into its courses along with the works of Peter Greenaway, Derek Jarman and others.\n\nIn 2008 Diana premiered first time in Hungary the stage adaptation of Katherine Kressman Taylor’s prophetic novel about the Nazism “Address Unknown”, that she staged also in Sao Paulo Theatro Hebraicain 2011. Her last work is “Regina” (2013) a poetic documentary about the world’s first woman rabbi was the winner of the Lia Award for dealing with Jewish Heritage at 30th Jerusalem Film Festival 2013 .

The paper examines two new communal women’s rituals currently practised in north-west London, comparing and contrasting them in order to analyse the complex interaction of creativity and constraint that they embody. The first is a women’s tefilah (prayer) group held in Stanmore, which, though following the standard order of sabbath prayers, aroused heated controversy and was excluded from the local synagogue for eighteen years; the second is a women’s berakhah (blessing) party held in Hendon, which, though totally innovative in structure and understood in thaumaturgic terms by some participants, takes place in a synagogue with rabbinic approval and participation. A critique of both secular feminist and Jewish apologetic thinking about the role of Orthodox Jewish women leads to a more nuanced understanding of women’s agency and self-empowerment within the constraints of male-controlled institutions and power relations. Contestations of the control and use of sacred space (synagogues), sacred time (sabbath versus Rosh Hodesh [new moon]), and sacred activity (traditional prayer services versus an innovative use of berakhot [blessings]) are seen to determine the contrasting reactions to the two rituals: the women’s tefilah group is viewed as a threat to male control of these areas and is thus subject to restriction, while the berakhah party is regarded as only tenuously linked to these sacred areas, and is not controversial. Both rituals provide a space where women’s voices are heard, in contrast to most ritual arenas in the Orthodox world. The participants understand these rituals either as offering an opportunity for heightened spirituality or as a powerful means of fulfilling women’s functions of protecting, nurturing, and healing their families and communities.\n\nDr Lindsey Taylor-Guthartz, London School of Jewish Studies\n\nback to the top\n\n„Schoraschim“ /roots – transgenerational resources and there working up in Arts: exhibition and artist talk – Ruth Herzka Bollinger (moderation: Esther Rietschi-Berns)\n\nIt’s a phenomena that a generation is handing over her imaginations, behaviors and even materialistic values by nonverbal messages through things/objects. Inspired by textiles from the East (Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania) is Ruth Herzka working in her paintings about their motives, patterns, colours and at last but not least their transfer of a specific and not exchangable atmosphere. She is working on canvas and textiles in mixed media. As she has her familiar roots in above countries, she is by her artistic aproach working on their impact on herself and her family – in the sense of resources.\n\nRuth Herzka Bollinger, Artist and Psychotherapist, studied Arts, Psychology, Anthropology and Psychotherapy in Arts in Zurich, Haifa (IL) and Basle. She is working and living with her family in Basle, Switzerland.\n\nback to the top\n\nTexts as Found Objects – Marion Kahnemann (Dresden, Germany)\n\nMarion Kahnemann works to a great extent with found materials made by humans and marked by human use, each with its own history, thrown away by people. She returns them to a human context, although a different one. Besides this she explores the possibilities of the interaction between the visual and the textual. The treatment of texts is part of a longer process, in which she brings together her findings – these might be found objects, found texts, stories, daily experiences, encounters, miss meetings or just visual discoveries during the process of making. It’s a kind of dia-, tria- or tetralogue – a talk between the different materials, the colors forms, texts, subtexts, herself, the viewer etc. Her aim is not at all to illustrate the texts!\n\nMarion Kahnemann (born 1960) lives and works as a sculptor in Dresden, where she attended art college and was awarded the city’s art promotion prize in 1993. Since 1998, she has taken part in numerous exhibitions in Germany and abroad, including ones in Dresden, Berlin, Sofia, Erfurt, Suhl, Chemnitz, St.Petersburg, Wroclaw, Kiev, Basel, Uppsala, Oakland-California and Madison-Wisconsin.\n\nMarion Kahnemann was a student at Paideia, the European Institute for Jewish Studies, in Stockholm in 2000-2001, a period that gave her much inspiration for her practice. Several of her works are situated in public spaces: she constructed a fountain for the Elsa-Fenske-Home for the Elderly in 1998 in Dresden; designed a wall at Beit haGalgalim, an institution for handicapped people in 2000 Herzliya-Israel, and at Paideia 2002. She created a memorial for the deportation of Dresden’s Jews in 2001 at Neustadt-train station in Dresden, and three “Denk-Orte” (memorial places of reflection) in 2007-2009 which confront the gradual systematic exclusion of the Jews that took place in the city from the 1930s onwards. www.mkahnemann.de\n\nback to the top\n\n„Mowa ta wywarła potężne wrażenia“ (This speech had made a good impression) – Róża Pomeranc-Melcer (1880-1934): Feminist, Zionist and Politician – Angelique Leszczawski-Schwerk (Dresden, Germany)\n\nRóża Pomeranc-Melcer was an active and vigorous Zionist and one of the few women elected to the Polish Sejm (parliament) in 1922 and the first Jewish female MP. She advocated women’s policy within Zionism and women’s rights. Her acticity was strongly linked with Galicia, in the 19th Century part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where she was born and dedicated herself to female and youth empowerment, social projects and projects related to educational policy. Melcers name stands for agitation and agency in „women’s spaces“ in Zionism, i.e. she initiated and led the the women‘ s organizations KKŻ (Organization of Jewish Women) in Lemberg/Lwów and the WIZO (Assembly of Jewish Women) in Lower Poland. In my paper, I will focus first Melcers involvement in women’s organization on the example of the city of Lwów and secondly her involvement in politics as MP. Thus, I will try to highlight both, on the one hand her point of view which role Jewish women should have in the dimension of Zionism and on the other her viewpoint as a Jew and woman in the Polish state of the interwar period.\n\nAngelique Leszczawski-Schwerk, historian, slavicist, specialized journalist.

Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust.The author presents a groundbreaking discussion with classical works in the field ofJewish post-Holocaust theology as well as the original conception of the Jewish feminist theological thought.I will analyze it from the broader perspective of the question: what does gender studies and feminist theory contribute to the understanding of the Shoah? How does Melissa Raphael define the fundamentals of feminist theology of the Shoah? If, as I believe, The Female Face of God in Auschwitz provides the new optics to read and re-read the voices of the Shoahwitnesses, artists, and scholars – what optics would it be?\n\nDr Katarzyna Liszka – graduated from philosophy and cultural studies, has received PhD with a dissertation on philosophical and ethical responses to the Shoah. She in an Associated Professor at the Department of Jewish Studies (the University of Wroclaw, Poland).

Prewar roles and responsibilities of Jewish women from Maramures were established by gender specific roles. The experience of the war and holocaust opened up new perspectives for European Jewish Women based on this most relevant experience of their life.\n\nDeported women from Maramures that came back and remained were using the alternative to fill in and fit in with no major impact on the community life. The limitation of their development was in direct connection with the geographical isolation, social, political and economic life of the country as being one of the most communist countries in Eastern Europe. On the contrary women that decided to leave Maramures after the end of the war did get involved in different activities that concerned war experiences, holocaust education besides creating career.\n\nSome examples will project a pattern: Dora Apsan Sorell doctor and writer (Letters to Miriam), Rothbart Hindi – writer (The girl from Sighet, a memoir), Gisella Perl doctor and writer (I was a doctor in Auschwitz) Alice Koppel – writer (Tapestry of hope), Bilbool Rose – scientist she wrote an autobiographical novel (Personally speaking: deeds recounted from Sighet to Jerusalem) and last but not least our most relevant example Hedi Fried which will be the focal point of the contribution to the conference.\n\nAuthor and psychologist, Holocaust survivor she was awarded with the Illis Quorum Gold medal and she was declared the European of the Year in 1997.

First, it gives a sketch of the meaning of TikkunHaOlam as a political concept and active attitude towards society. Second, it reflects the normative dimensions of the concept with focus on Jewish feminist claims. What does changing the world mean from a Jewish feminist perspective? What are strategies that constitute the political attitude of changing the world and enable women to engage actively with societal relations? The aim is to provide a conceptual framework and philosophical grounds for creating alternatives for Jewish women in Europe. The claim is that creating alternatives for Jewish women in Europe implicates transforming society in a way that it becomes a better world for every person by raising awareness for unheard voices and engaging in active discussion about how people want to live together.\n\nHannah Peaceman (born 1991), holds an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences (LSE 2014) and an M.A. in Philosophy (FSU Jena 2016).Her research interests lie in the field of political philosophy, feminist philosophy and Jewish philosophy.

Though\n\nwidespread use of the internet was only just beginning, the founders, for whom\n\naccess to the documents, stories and information was paramount, pioneered the\n\ncreation of an online archive, one of the first of its kind.\n\nWhile the medium through which it accomplishes its mission no longer marks JWA\n\nas unique, JWA continues to be the only organization in America solely dedicated to\n\nuncovering, chronicling and making known the stories of Jewish women. As one\n\nuser wrote, “No other organization is compiling now what will in future be the\n\nhistory of Jewish women, and nowhere else is there this rich treasure trove of\n\ninformation about Jewish women up till now – to explore, dip into, or immerse\n\noneself in, depending on the need or the mood.”\n\nIn this presentation the founding director of the Jewish Women’s Archive will\n\npresent a brief history of JWA , focusing on the challenges and opportunities that\n\ndefined its initial direction, as well as the pivots made during its second decade.\n\nShe hopes to explore with her audience options for increasing the available\n\ndocumentation and information on Jewish women across Europe.\n\nback to the top\n\nJudith Berg and the Language of Dance – Gail Twersky Reimer\n\nJudith Berg, a Warsaw born dancer who trained with Mary Wigman, is best known\n\nfor her choreography and performance in the last important yiddish film to be\n\nproduced in Warsaw, The Dybbuk (1937.) Less well known is her work in Breslau,\n\nwhere she established a dance school in the years following the war, and her work\n\nin Otwock in the first Jewish orphanage to be established after the Shoah – in March\n\n1945.\n\nThe children, many of whom had been hidden in convents, monasteries or by\n\nChristian homes, arrived at the orphanage confused about who they were. Often\n\ntraumatized by the murder of Jews that they had witnessed; grieving for family they\n\nhad lost, or under the influence of anti-Jewish prejudices they were taught during\n\ntheir years in hiding, the children were cut off from their Jewish identity. The paper\n\nwill explore the philosophy of dance at the heart of Berg’s work with the children —\n\nrestoring broken paths of communication through movement, while fostering an\n\nemotional attachment to Jewish culture and Jewish people through dance\n\nGail Twersky Reimer recently stepped down from her position as executive\n\ndirector of the Jewish Women’s Archive, the not-for-profit organization she founded\n\nin 1995 to document and make known the stories, struggles, and achievements of\n\nJewish women, both celebrated and unheralded. Reimer led the organization for its\n\nfirst two decades, initiating plans for its pioneering digital archive, oral history\n\nprojects, and educational programs, producing Making Trouble, JWA’s film on\n\nwomen comedians, and teaching and lecturing widely on Jewish women’s\n\nhistory. Reimer’s leadership of JWA has been acknowledged with numerous awards\n\nincluding the Dr. Benjamin J. Shevach Memorial Award for distinguished\n\nachievement in Jewish educational leadership by Hebrew College of Boston (2011);\n\nthe American Jewish Distinguished Service Award from Hebrew Union College-\n\nJewish Institute of Religion (2012) and the Lee Max Friedman award for\n\ndistinguished service in the field of American Jewish History by the American Jewish\n\nHistorical Society (2014).\n\nReimer holds a PhD in English and American Literature from Rutger University and\n\nhas co-edited two anthologies of Jewish women’s writings – Reading Ruth: Women\n\nReclaim a Sacred Story and Beginning Anew: A Woman’s Companion to the High Holy\n\nDays.\n\nback to the top\n\nJewish Response to the “Double Genocide” Discourse – Tania Reytan-Marincheshka (Sofia, Bulgaria)\n\nMy paper will draw on the current anomalous “Double Genocide” memorial narratives and rituals in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, influenced by the 20th century anti-Communist discourse. It will draw a picture of what is the Jewish response to this strategy of historical revision. Furthermore, the text will promote an understanding of why the majority of European Jews, given their political culture and historical experience can’t afford to accept the nowadays institutionally sanctioned Denkverbot (prohibition on thinking) about the everyday lived experiences of socialism. In an era of supposed free speech and freedom of conscience, right-wing politicians, scholars, and activists silence other stories about the past, including any open discussion of socialism’s achievements in terms of literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security by focusing exclusively on the crimes of stalinism and the ‘Double Genocide’ thesis.\n\nOne of my conclusions is that the triumphalism of the anti-Communist discourse after the Cold War leads to an extremely polarised understanding of history. It leads to a denial of a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of the history of 20th century Communism as ideology, social movement, and political experiment.The open-ended\n\nprocess of producing and reproducing history is thereby closed off. We are to be contented with the version of the victors, because might makes right.

I would like to show the importance of the Yiddish language to the Holocaust survivors, the power of the Yiddish song and word, which have gone through the fire of hell and miraculously survived, came out unharmed and intact, which gave the Jews in the ghetto hope and strength. And after the Holocaust, it brought those who survived together. Diana Blumenfeld saw her mission in this area. To pass on the Yiddish language, the essence of the Jewish identity. Performing, playing and singing in Yiddish, she brought joy through tears to the liberated, to the remnants of Polish Jewry. Diana Blumenfeld, already well known, successful and beloved actress before the war, performed together with her husband, Jonas Turkow on the stage of Yiddish theatre and in films. She became famous as a singer in the Warsaw Ghetto, where she turned to singing, since dramatic presentations were forbidden by the Nazis in the Ghetto. She was immediately a great a success on the concert stage, gained a big popularity and her beautiful alto voice inspired some best songwriters, including Mordechai Gebirtig, who composed songs especially for her.\n\nShe and her husband Jonas Turkow were the only two Jewish actors who survived the Warsaw Ghetto. After the liberation, the couple played the crucial role in the times of the immediate post-war restoration of the Polish Jewish culture. One of their great merits was the creation of a Yiddish radio program at the Polish Radio, in which Diana Blumenfeld was an anchorwoman and a performer. They left Poland in 1945 and toured Europe, DP camps in Germany,giving concerts and performances for survivors, and they continued their international career in America, performing and singing in Yiddish all over the world.

Traces of rabbis wives in Breslau – Agata Rybińska (Lublin, Poland)\n\nIn the Jewish history of Breslau very important are the rabbis, the discourse according the Jewish liturgy, reform and religious life. The publications of historians about famous personages from Jewish Community (e.g. Geiger, Joel, Heppner, Graetz, Badt) give a lot information about their works and ideas. Between words, only in the margins, the can discover the traces of their wives. It’s a challenge to explore over documents and the chance to recognizes the history of Jewish women. The issue of my paper is to present the signs of live and activity of wives of Breslau’s rabbis, especially in 19.th Century.

In the mid-1930s, both Metz and Samson saw their life and career increasingly threatened by the German Nazi regime. While Josefa Metz had behind her a career of writing bestselling novels and was then in her 60s, Samson was an aspiring journalist for the C.V. Zeitung and a single mother of three. The presentation will highlight the contrasting concepts of Jewish girlhood within the context of German Reform Judaism by a reading of their two children’s novels – Metz’ Eva. Aus einer glücklichen Kindheit (1937) and Samson’s Spatz macht sich (1938). Incidentally, both feature a girl called Eva as a protagonist, thus signifying the prototypical girl-child. However, while Metz’ novel nostalgically describes an idealized innocent protagonist in a Jewish-German bourgeois idyll, Samson’srealistic novel features an assertive and far from flawless protagonist in1930s Berlin. The two novels may be read as a way of literary defiance in the face of adversity but also as expressions of different concepts of girlhood, pedagogy, and Reform Judaism. In their individual ways, Metz and Samson can be seen as representatives of two generations of New Jewish Women who were willing to re-define women’s role in religion and society.\n\nHadassah Stichnothe studied Comparative and American Literature at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.

Is every woman’s act that can be regarded as highly interventional in the same time also a feminist act? What are the strategies of working with the patriarchal or other social environments that we live in? Should we strive to the dialogue, opening ourselves to listening to the other positions, or should we strive to maintain our own standpoints? Are those two strategies mutually exclusive? Are there other strategies? What about the issue of sisterhood – should we act as individuals or as a community (both regarding to Jewish, women and feminist community)? And what were the examples that women from Tanach give us to think about? These and a lot of other questions relevant to historical and contemporary notions of feminism will be explored through some interactive workshop discussions.\n\nDragana Stojanović (1983) works in the fields of formal and informal education and publishing, concentrating mostly on the matters of contemporary feminisms, gender studies, culture studies and Jewish studies, exploring it both through working as an Assistant professor in the fields of Theory of art and media and Culture studies at the Faculty of Media and Communications in Belgrade, and also as being active in cultural and educational projects of Jewish community of Belgrade and the organization Haver Serbia.

In 1902 they established independent organization – Verband Schlesischer Künstlerinnen. Among them there was a large number of Jewish artists, many of them associated with Breslau avant-garde circles. Since the nineteenth century interest in the arts was nurtured especially in bourgeois Jewish families. In case of Breslau the most characteristic example is Clara Sachs, but it should be noted that young girls from Jewish homes attended private drawing schools such as the one carried by the painter Eugen Spiro.\n\nJewish women not only in the same time, as Christian women, began to cultivate the liberal profession of artists, but their work was closely linked to the new role and activity that Jewish women have adopted in Breslau. They had their own organizations, of which the most important was the Breslau branch of Jüdischer Frauenbund (1907) led by Paula Ollendorf. Jewish women artists were associated with this milieu, i.e. Käthe Ephraim Marcus, who was the author of expressive portrait of the Frauenbund leader. Among prominent local artists were also Paul Grünfeld and Sara Margot Abraham. Still, little is known about their work. Their status as women – artists, all the more Jewish women – artists, active in the difficult 1930s, sentenced them and their work to oblivion, and their output has been dispersed or destroyed. Based on the notes in catalogs, articles and few works that survived, I would like to restore their significant work to memory.\n\nMałgorzata Stolarska-Fronia, Ph.D, art historian, curator, translator, academic teacher.

Welcome, Life!” How a life threatening diagnosis helped me to become a better Jew and a stronger feminist – Gunda Trepp (San Francisco, Berlin)\n\nIt was July 2015, Berlin. I went home from Charité, riding my bike, and, while crossing the beautiful Tiergarten, had just one thought: “Now it finally has hit me.” I had just been diagnosed with a triple negative carcinoma in my right breast, and within a couple of days I knew most you have to know about it. Not so good. A lot of women don’t even make the crucial five years after surgery.\n\nWe carry the BRCA-gen mutation on my mother’s side. My grandmother, my mother, my aunts, most of my cousins either carry the mutation or have already been fighting breast- or ovarian cancer, quite some of them losing the fight in young age. Well, I was 56, not so young anymore, but still: was I ready to go?\n\nA journey began. I would like to share what I have learned while walking down this road. These are some of the thoughts:\n\nI would like to talk about how much I loved life and to being alive during this time. There was no bitterness, only gratitude. Judaism helped me a lot to respond this way. I would like to talk about the question how we as Jewish women can transform our love for life into a different form if living. Is that even possible?\n\nI could never comprehend the meaning of being created in G’d’s image in a more profound way. I found a new way to look at myself. Today I see myself as a mind and an intellect that both need the body. I do appreciate my body, but not as a showoff anymore as women do far too often, but as something to take better care of and to appreciate as something miraculous and wonderful.\n\nAnd I would like to share some advice:\n\nBe informed. A lot of gynecologists are not.\n\nGet tested for the mutation if you have reasons although you don’t have and do not want to have children. You still need to know. I didn’t and I was on birth control pill and still had my ovaries although it is proven that their removal not only decreases the risk of getting ovarian cancer to almost zero, but also reduces the risk of breast cancer.\n\nGet a better sense of your body. Let not men define who you are and how you feel about yourself. You need new breasts? Great. They stand for survival. If a guy doesn’t get that, leave the guy and embrace your new You.\n\nAnd there is nobody who understands your body better than you. Listen!!I should have listened. In the very beginning I didn’t feel this was right. My family members had gotten cancer much earlier. But when all Professors tell you, it’s true, well, then it must be true. The irony is that in the end it turned out that my feeling had been right. Charité had messed me up. It was a terrible misdiagnosis.\n\nAm I angry? Yes. I had so many painful procedures and have scars for no reason. They put my brothers and friends through anxiety and pain for nothing. I lost bushes and bushes of my hair and harmed my immune system severely – for nothing.\n\nBut I am so gratefultoo – for new insights into life and the end of life and, mostly, for life itself.\n\nGunda Trepp is a trained attorney and journalist.

Generally speaking the Romanian Jewish Community contrary to other Jewish Communities in Eastern Europe was never considered religious but an assimilated Community. Romania is divided by Regions which correspond to the level of Jewishness in the families.\n\nThe most religious Jews were in Northern Transylvania- Sighet- Maramures Region with cities e. g. Satu Mare, Cluj, Margita, Sighet etc. Due to the 1944 deportations of that Community very few returned as most of them found their fate in Auschwitz. Females who survived the holocaust, had well and quite clear memories of their Jewish homes Life Cycle; however the younger the person was when they were deported the less they could remember. Everyone wanted to start a new life- which meant marry and have children- but cannot openly handle a Jewish Home.\n\nIn my presentation I will demonstrate through examples of women who fall in all above categories how they manage their Jewish Homes and Life – Today. I had/have the opportunity to meet some of these women. They have given me their permission as well as taking their pictures, which I will show during my presentation. Today’s Jewish Women in their 35+ are very much eager to learn and practice Judaism in their homes and transmit the Jewish Heritage to their children even if they are married to non-Jewish man.\n\nPeninah Zilberman was born in Israel to survivor parents from Sighet – Transylvania and Bucharest – in Romania.
