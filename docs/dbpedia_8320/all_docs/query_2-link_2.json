        "text": "There are some people who are famous in such a way that you would never expect to meet them, as if they existed in another world. This is true of actors, singers and politicians, whose faces are everywhere around us, while they themselves are always somewhere else. It is also true of artists, but in a different way: It is not their faces that are everywhere, but their work — and radiating from the work, their names.\n\nAnselm Kiefer has always been such a name for me — more so than any other artist of our time, perhaps — because his works are so monumental, so charged with time, so burdened by history, and because the private sphere, the near and the personal, is so completely absent from them.\n\nWhen I became interested in his work in my late teens, Kiefer was already one of the biggest names in contemporary art. Back then, in the 1980s, all art was ironic, at least in my own circles. Everything, including authenticity, was seen as a construct. Crying over a book, a movie or painting meant that you had been tricked. Instead, we laughed. But it was impossible to laugh in front of Kiefer’s dark, searing images of Nazi buildings or his lead-book libraries. No, standing in front of Kiefer’s pictures, you fell silent.\n\nToday Kiefer has long since been canonized, and his name has become a kind of trademark. If anyone is truly provoked by his work these days, it is by its price tag. And it’s easy to find critical voices: There are plenty who say his art is that of a megalomaniac, that it consists of grand gestures and little else, that it is hollow and empty and perhaps not art at all but kitsch.\n\nBut if his name has changed meaning over the years and if his art is judged differently, the work itself has the same effect now that it did 30 years ago: Standing before it, you fall silent.\n\nI experienced this in a fairly acute way at a Kiefer retrospective in London in 2014. Looking at one of his monumental paintings — “Black Flakes,” nearly 20 feet long and 10 feet tall, depicting a snow-covered field beneath an ashen sky, dark and apocalyptic, with rows of branches surrounding a thick book made of lead — all my thoughts seemed to be suspended, and only emotions remained. It wasn’t as if I was looking at a painting; the painting was enveloping me and filling me with its mood, which was impossible to escape. Everyone else who came into the room fell silent, too, as if they had suddenly been transported to another place within themselves. Kiefer’s pictures seemed to align with a gravity that we all knew but rarely acknowledged, a gravity that is solemn at times, horrifying at others.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
