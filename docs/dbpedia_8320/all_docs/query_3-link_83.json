        "text": "Hello everybody!\n\nSince Monday, we are in Germany. What a beautiful country with a lot of things to do. Tomorrow, we are going to Berlin. Where we are going to visit a museum. The museum is famous because it is about Anne Frank. I am sure that you have heard about her. But I would like to give you some more information about Anne. Because she was such a strong and beautiful girl.\n\nAnnelies Marie \"Anne\" Frank was born on 12 June 1929 and died in February 1945. She was a diarist and writer. She is one of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Her diary ‘The Diary of a Young Girl’ has been the basis for several performances and films. She was born in Frankfurt but lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Frank lost her citizenship in 1941.\n\nThe family Frank moved from Germany to Amsterdam in 1933, this was the year the Nazis gained control over Germany. In May 1940, they were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. In July 1942, the family hided in a room behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father worked. After two years, the group was betrayed and transported to concentration camps. Anne Frank and her sister, Margot Frank, were transferred to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died.\n\nOtto Frank, the only survivor, returned to Amsterdam after the war where he found out that Anne's diary had been saved by one of the helpers. With help from other people, they published it in 1947. It has been translated into many languages.\n\nThis is such a sad story but also very beautiful... I really want to visit the museum because I want to know everything about the girl and her family. In her Diary, I have found a signature.\n\nI end this blog with a quote of Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl. It gives me constantly goose bumps.\n\n“In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can’t build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death. I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness, I hear the ever approaching thunder, which will destroy us too, I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right, that this cruelty too will end, and that peace and tranquillity will return again.”\n\nI hope you enjoyed my blog and maybe you are also going to read her book.\n\nTschüss!"
