        "text": "Historically Famous People with Blindness or Visual Impairments\n\nBlindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological and/or neurological factors. Complete blindness is the total lack of form and light perception and is clinically recorded as “No Light Perception” or “NPL”. Eye injuries, mostly occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye). People who are blind or visually impaired have devised a number of techniques that allow them to complete daily activities using their remaining senses and recently created accessible technology such as screen reading software enables visually impaired people to use mainstream computer applications including the Internet. Listed below are historically famous people with visual impairments including total blindness, sight conditions, or blindness in one eye.\n\nIf you have any materials you’d like produced in braille, large print and/or audio for your customers who are blind or have low vision; you can request a free quote or call 1-800-258-7544 (M-F 8:30am to 5pm EST). We also offer 508 document remediation services so you can be sure all of your electronic documents are compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nNOTE: We have assembled this list from online and offline resources. If you know of a discrepancy on this page please contact us so we can amend the entry. Thank You!\n\nLouis Braille (January 4, 1809 – January 6, 1852): Louis Braille became blind after he accidentally stabbed himself in the eye with his father’s awl. He later became an inventor and the designer of braille writing, which enables people who are blind to read by feeling a series of organized bumps representing letters. This concept was beneficial to all blind people from around the world and is still commonly used today. If it were not for Louis Braille’s blindness he may not have invented this method of reading and no other blind person could have enjoyed a story or been able to comprehend important written materials.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHelen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968): Helen Adams Keller was an American author, activist and lecturer. She was the first deaf/blind person to graduate from college. She was not born blind and deaf; it was not until nineteen months of age that she came down with an illness described by doctors as “an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain”, which could have possibly been scarlet fever or meningitis. The illness did not last for a particularly long time, but it left her deaf and blind. Keller went on to become a world-famous speaker and author. She is remembered as an advocate for people with disabilities amid numerous other causes.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHarriet Tubman (c. “in approximately” 1820 – March 10, 1913): Harriet Tubman was a slave throughout her youth, being treated as an animal until she eventually escaped captivity. She was an abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. When she had reached Canada she did not stay to enjoy her freedom. She returned to the lands and brought hundreds of black slaves back to safety, saving them from slavery by escaping in what was then called The Underground Railroad. After a severe wound to the head, which was inflicted by a slave owner before her escape, she became a victim to vision impairment and seizures. That did not keep her from tossing her fears aside and to keep fighting for the freedom of her people.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHomer (Unknown): A legendary ancient Greek epic poet, traditionally said to be the author of the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey. He was also said to have been blind. The ancient Greeks generally believed that Homer was a historical individual, but modern scholars are skeptical because no reliable biographical information has been handed down from classical antiquity, and the poems themselves manifestly represent the culmination of many centuries of oral story-telling and a well-developed “formulaic” system of poetic composition. The date of Homer’s existence was controversial in antiquity and is no less so today. Herodotus said that Homer lived 400 years before his own time, which would place him at around 850 BC; but other ancient sources gave dates much closer to the supposed time of the Trojan War (1194 – 1184 BC). The formative influence of the works of Homer in shaping and influencing the whole development of Greek culture was recognized by many Greeks themselves, who considered him to be their instructor.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRay Charles (September 23, 1930 – June 10, 2004): Known by his stage name Ray Charles, he was an American pianist and musician who shaped the sound of rhythm and blues. He brought a soulful sound to country music, pop standards, and a rendition of “America the Beautiful” that Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes called the “definitive version of the song, an American anthem.” In 1965, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin, a drug to which he had been addicted for nearly 20 years. It was his third arrest for the offense, but he avoided jail time after kicking the habit in a clinic in Los Angeles. He spent a year on parole in 1966. Ray also appeared in the 1980 hit movie, The Blues Brothers and Frank Sinatra called him “the only true genius in the business.” In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Charles number ten on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and also voted him number two on their list of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt (January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945): Franklin, sometimes better known as FDR; was the 32nd President of the United States of America and played a big role during World War II. Roosevelt eventually aided the poor and unemployed of America and restored order at various times during his presidency. Elected to four terms in office, he served from 1933 to 1945 and is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms mostly because of his help in the recovery of the economy. It has been said that Roosevelt had several disabilities including vision impairment.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGalileo Galilei (February 15, 1564 – January 8, 1642): Galileo Galilei was a Tuscan (Italian) astronomer, mathematician, physicist, and philosopher being greatly responsible for the scientific revolution. Some of his accomplishments include improvements to the telescope, accelerated motion and astronomical observations. Galileo was the first to discover the four largest satellites (moons) of Jupiter which were named the Galilean moons in his honor. Galileo had also improved compass design and eventually opposed the geocentric view. His sight started to deteriorate at the age of 68 years old and it eventually led to complete blindness.\n\nBack to Top\n\nStevie Wonder (May 13, 1950 – Present): Born Steveland Hardaway Judkins, he later changed his name to Steveland Hardaway Morris. Wonder is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. Blind from infancy, Wonder signed with Motown Records as a pre-adolescent at the age of twelve, and continues to perform and record for the label to this day. It is thought that he received excessive oxygen in his incubator which led to retinopathy of prematurity, a destructive ocular disorder affecting the retina. It is characterized by abnormal growth of blood vessels, scarring, and sometimes retinal detachment. A prominent figure in popular music during the latter half of the 20th century, Wonder has recorded more than thirty U.S. top ten hits and won twenty-two Grammy Awards (the most ever won by a solo artist) as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also won an Academy Award for Best Song, and been inducted into both the Rock and Roll and Songwriters halls of fame. He has also been awarded the Polar Music Prize. American music magazine Rolling Stone named the ninth greatest singer of all time.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDr. Abraham Nemeth (October 16, 1918 – October 2, 2013): Dr. Nemeth was an American mathematician and inventor. He was Professor of Mathematics at the University of Detroit Mercy in Detroit, Michigan. Though his employers were sometimes reluctant to hire him knowing that he was blind, his reputation grew as it became apparent that he was a capable mathematician and teacher. He developed the Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation in 1952. Nemeth Code has gone through 4 revisions since its initial development and continues in wide use today. Dr. Nemeth is also responsible for the rules of MathSpeak, a system for orally communicating mathematical text. Dr. Nemeth is an active member of the National Federation of the Blind. He has written several short stories and made many speeches for the NFB about his life as a blind mathematician.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJohn Milton (December 9, 1608 – November 8, 1674): John Milton was a civil servant, English poet and prose polemicist. Milton was well known through his epic poem Paradise Lost and also for his radical views on republican religion. He never was well adjusted in school and once got expelled for having a fist fight with his tutor. Eventually he began to write poetry in English, Latin and Italian. John Milton became blind at the age of 43 in 1651, and has written books containing quotes of how the experience sometimes made him miserable.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJames Thurber (December 8, 1894 – November 2, 1961): James Thurber was a comedian and cartoonist most known for his contributions to New Yorker Magazine. Thurber had two brothers, William and Robert. Once, while playing a game, his brother William shot James in the eye with an arrow. Because of the lack of medical technology, Thurber lost his eye. This injury would later cause him to be almost entirely blind. During his childhood he was unable to participate in sports and activities because of his injury, and instead developed a creative imagination, which he shared in his writings.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAlec Templeton (July 4, 1909 – March 28, 1963): Alec was a composer, pianist and satirist. Blind from birth, he studied at London’s Royal Academy. In 1936, he moved from Wales to the United States as a member of Jack Hylton’s Jazz Band, where he played with a number of orchestras and gave his first radio performances on The Rudy Vallée Show, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Kraft Music Hall and The Magic Key. His radio program, Alec Templeton Time, sponsored by Alka-Seltzer, was first broadcast from 1939 to 1941, returning in 1943 and 1946–47. It was sometimes known as The Alec Templeton Show. He memorized the scripts for his shows by having them read to him 20 times. There is some confusion concerning Alec Templeton’s year of birth. Most published and Internet biographies give his birth year as 1909, but his headstone shows 1910 as his year of birth. He died at age 52 or 53 and is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nBack to Top\n\nClaude Monet (November 14, 1840 – December 5, 1926): Also known as Oscar-Claude Monet or Claude Oscar Monet, he was a founder of French impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement’s philosophy of expressing one’s perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term “Impressionism” is derived from the title of his painting Impression, Sunrise. His popularity and fame grew and by 1907 he had painted many well-known paintings, but by then he had “his first problem with his eyesight.” He started to go blind. He still painted, though his eyes got worse. He wouldn’t stop painting until he was nearly blind. In the last decade of his life Monet, nearly blind, painted a group of large water lily murals for the Musée de l’Orangerie (art gallery of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings located on the Place de la Concorde, Paris) in Paris.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAndrea Angel Bocelli (September 22, 1958 – Present): Andrea is an Italian tenor and has recorded over 20 pop and classical albums, as well as seven complete operas. He has sold over 65 million albums worldwide. It was evident at birth that he had problems with his sight, and after visits to many doctors Bocelli was diagnosed with glaucoma. In 1970, at the age of 12, he completely lost his sight after an accident during a soccer game. As a young boy, Bocelli showed a great passion for music. At the age of six he started piano lessons before he also learned to play the flute, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, harp, guitar and drums. Bocelli once said “I don’t think a singer decides to sing, it is the others who choose that you sing by their reactions.” Bocelli has sung with other great singers such as Pavarotti and has only been further admired due to his blindness.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJoseph Pulitzer (April 10, 1847 – October 29, 1911): Joseph was a Hungarian-American publisher best known for posthumously establishing the Pulitzer Prizes (along with William Randolph Hearst) and for originating yellow journalism.

Nelson was born into a moderately prosperous Norfolk family, and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle, Maurice Suckling. He rose rapidly through the ranks and served with leading naval commanders of the period before obtaining his own command in 1778. He developed a reputation in the service through his personal valor and firm grasp of tactics, but suffered periods of illness and unemployment after the end of the American War of Independence. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars allowed Nelson to return to service, where he was particularly active in the Mediterranean. He was wounded several times in combat, losing most of one arm and the sight in one eye. He won several victories, including the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, during which he was killed. His death at Trafalgar secured his position as one of England’s most heroic figures.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMarla Runyan (January 4, 1969 – Present): Marla Runyan is a marathon runner who is legally blind. She is a three-time national champion in the women’s 5,000 meters. Runyan’s career as a world-class runner began in 1999 at the Pan American Games, where she won the 1,500-meter race. The next year, she placed eighth in the 1,500-meter in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, making Runyan the first legally blind athlete to compete in the Games and the highest finish by an American woman in that event.

He was known as a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, who worked with Republicans such as Robert La Follette. He was to a large extent no different from any other politician because of his blindness, but there were problems, as La Follette recounts an example in his memoirs when, during a filibuster, Gore did not realize that the senator who was to take over speaking for him had left the room, and the filibuster failed because he did not continue to speak.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWilliam Prescott (February 20, 1726 – October 13, 1795): Prescott was an American colonel in the Revolutionary War who commanded the rebel forces in the Battle of Bunker Hill. Prescott became widely attributed for the famous quote, “Do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes,” an important instruction to his soldiers in order to conserve ammunition. The former town of Prescott, Massachusetts, was named in his honor. The town was dis-incorporated in 1938 as part of the building of the Quabbin Reservoir, and the land now makes up Prescott Peninsula, which divides the main branches of the reservoir. Prescott’s likeness was made into a statue for a memorial for the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJoseph Plateau (October 14, 1801 – September 15, 1883): Joseph Plateau was a Belgian physicist. In 1836, Plateau invented an early stroboscopic device, the “phenakistoscope”. It consisted of two disks, one with small equidistant radial windows, through which the viewer could look, and another containing a sequence of images. When the two disks rotated at the correct speed, the synchronization of the windows and the images created an animated effect. The projection of stroboscopic photographs, creating the illusion of motion, eventually led to the development of cinema. Fascinated by the persistence of luminous impressions on the retina, he performed an experiment in which he gazed directly into the sun for 25 seconds. Consequently, he lost his eyesight later in his life.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJorge Luis Borges (August 24, 1899 – June 14, 1986): Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentine writer.

Mr. Armagan is an important figure in the history of picture-making, and in the history of knowledge. His work is remarkable. He has demonstrated for the first time that a blind person can develop on his or her own pictorial skills equaling most depictions by the sighted. This has not happened before in the history of picture-making. He has had exhibitions in Turkey, Holland and the Czech Republic. In 2004, he was the subject of a study of human perception, conducted by the psychologist John Kennedy of University of Toronto.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJohn Stanley (January 17, 1712 – May 19, 1786): John Stanley was an English composer and organist.
