        "text": "The United States Armed Forces transitioned to an all-volunteer military force on July 1, 1973, in the waning years of the Vietnam War. As part of this decision, the national draft was repositioned as part of Americaâs national defense strategy to serve as a deterrent and support military readiness if the Department of Defense requested additional military personnel.\n\nThe success of the all-volunteer force is apparent, this Nation is fortunate to have military heroes who served this great Nation as both volunteers and draftees. In recognition of the 50th anniversary of the last draft call in December 1972 and the conception of the all-volunteer military, we salute those individuals who were drafted or volunteered and served America with great honor, courage and distinction in times of war and peace.\n\nThe Storied Lives of 10 American Heroes\n\nSome of these veteran heroes dedicated their time to community service and helping other veterans, while others took up hobbies like painting, golfing, and acting.
