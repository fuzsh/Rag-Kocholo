I have however been advised by a descendant of Count Serge that the de Witt family have been Counts since Peter the Great. The correspondent also mentioned Duc de Raguse (Auguste Frederic Viesse de Marmont) (1774-1852) (presumably in his memoirs) describes how he met the Count de Witt during a visit to Russia. Further.
