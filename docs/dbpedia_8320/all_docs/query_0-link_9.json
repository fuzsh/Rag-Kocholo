        "text": "While I was waiting on the Christmas cards 2021 - I thought about the postal service\n\nin the past. Who took care of the royal correspondence? Immediately I came to\n\nthe family Thurn und Taxis.\n\nWho is the family Thurn und Taxis?\n\nThe Princely House of Thurn and Taxis is a family of German nobility that is part\n\nof the Briefadel. It was a key player in the postal services in Europe during the\n\n16th. century until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. It became well\n\nknown as the owner of breweries and builder of many castles.\n\nHistory?\n\nThe Tasso family was a Lombard family in the area of Bergamo. Omodeo Tasso\n\norganized 32 of his relatives into the Company of Couriers and linked Milan to\n\nVenice and Rome.\n\nIn 1443, Ruggiero de Tassis was named to the court of Emperor Frederick the\n\nPeaceful. He organized a post system between Bergamo and Vienna by 1450; from\n\nInnsbruck to Italy and Styria around 1460; and Vienna with Brussels by 1480.\n\nRuggiero was knighted and made a gentleman of the Chamber.\n\nJanetto von Taxis was appointed Chief Master of the Postal Services at Innsbruck\n\nin 1489. Philip of Burgundy elevated Janetto's brother Francesco I de Tassis to\n\ncaptain of his post in 1502.\n\nBy 1516 Francisco had moved the family to Brussels in the Duchy of Brabant, then\n\nunder Habsburg Rule.\n\nTraces of Francisco de Tassis in Brussels\n\nAt the death of Francisco in 1517, Emperor Charles V, appointed his nephew Johann\n\nBaptista von Taxis , Generalpostmeister of the Reichspost.\n\nRaymond de Tassis (1515-1579) took over the office of postmaster general to the\n\nCrown of Spain and settled in Spain. He married into Spanish nobility and his son\n\nJuan de Tassis was created Count of Villamediana in 1603 by Philip III.\n\nThe name Turn und Taxis came from the translation into the German of the\n\nFamily's French title: the Tour et Taxis (Tassis).\n\nIn 1695, under the rule of Emperor Leopold I, the family operated the Turn-und-\n\nTaxis Post, successor of the Imperial Reichspost of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThis lasted until 1867.\n\nUntil 1919, the title of the head of the Princely House was His Serene Higness\n\nthe Prince of thurn and Taxis.\n\nSince 1748, the family seat was established in Regensburg, Germany at the\n\nSt. Emmeram Castle.\n\nI visited Regensburg and the St. Emmeram Castle in 2014. This was a blogpost\n\nabout the castle.\n\nWho is who?\n\nEugen Alexander Franz, First prince of Thurn und Taxis\n\nEugen Alexander Franz was the First Prince of Thurn und Taxis. He was\n\nbaptized in Brussels on 11 January 1652.\n\nIn 1681, the last Habsburg King of Spain, Charles II, appointed Eugen Alexander\n\nFranz from a count to a prince. Emperor Leopold I made him an imperial prince in\n\n1695.\n\nIn 1702, he moved his postal system's headquarters from Brussels to\n\nFrankfurt am Main.\n\nAnselm Franz, 2nd Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nAnselm Franz was the eldest child and son of Eugen Alexander Franz, 1st.\n\nPrince of Thurn and Taxis and his wife Prince Anna Adelheid of Fürstenberg-\n\nHeiligenberg. He was baptised on 30 January 1681 at the Our Blessed Lady\n\nof Zavel Church in Brussels.\n\nWhen his father died, Anselm Franz was appointed Postmaster General by\n\nCharles VI in 1715. He returned to Brussels. However in 1724 he moved\n\nback to Frankfurt am Main. There he started the construction of the Baroque\n\nPalais Thurn und Taxis in 1729.\n\nFrom 1739 he lived in the still unfinished palace in Frankfurt but then he\n\nreturned to Brussels in 1739. There he died unexpectedly.\n\nAlexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nAlexander Ferdinand was the eldest child and only son of Anselm Franz, 2nd.\n\nPrince of Thurn and Taxis and Maria Ludovika anna Franziska, Princess of\n\nLobkowicz.\n\nFrom 1 February 1743 till 1745, Alexander Ferdinand served as\n\nPrincipal Commissioner of Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor at the Preptual\n\nImperial Diet in Frankfurt am Main.\n\nWhen the Diet relocated from Frankfurt am Main to Regensburg, Alexander\n\nFerdinand moved the principal residence of the Princely House from Frankfurt\n\nto Regensburg.\n\nHe died on 17 March 1773.\n\nAlexander Ferdinand\n\nKarl Anselm 4th. Prince of Thurn und Taxis\n\nKarl Anselm was the eldest son of Alexander Ferdinand 3rd and his first wife\n\nMargravine Sophie Christine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth.\n\nDuring the invasion of the French troops in the Austrian Netherlands in 1794,\n\nthe local properties of the Thurn und Taxis family were seized.\n\nDue to the Napoleonic Wars, Karl Anselm's Imperial Reichspost gradually lost\n\nmore and more.\n\nKarl Anselm was awarded in 1803 other Swabian lands, including the Free\n\nImperial City of Buchau, the Imperial Abbey of Buchau, the\n\nImperial abbeys of Marchtal and Neresheim, Ostrach and other villages.\n\nMaximilian Karl, 6th. Prince of Thurn und Taxis\n\nWith the annexation of the Free City of Frankfurt by the Kingdom of Prussia\n\nin 1866 and the forced sale of the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post, ended an era of the\n\nfamily's postal monopoly. The handover took place on 1 July 1867.\n\nThis happened when Maximilian Karl, the 6th. Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nwas the head of the Princely House. He died on 10 November 1871.\n\nAnother drama took place on 26 June 1867. Then Maximilian Anton Lamoral,\n\nHereditary Prince of Thurn und Taxis died of either kidney failure or lung\n\nparalysis. He only was 35 years old and left a wife and children. He was married\n\nto Duchess Helene in Bavaria the sister of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Sissi).\n\nAlbert Maria Joseph Maximilian Lamoral, 8th Prince of Thurn und Taxis\n\nAlbert was born on 8 May 1867 at Regensburg, Germany as the younger son of\n\nMaximilian Anton Lamoral, Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis and\n\nDuchess Helene of Bavaria. His father died when he was less than 2 months old\n\nand he was raised by his mother. He was made a knight of the Austrian\n\nOrder of the Golden Fleece on 30 November 1889. He died on 22 January 1952.\n\nFranz Joseph Maximilian Maria Antonius Ignatius Lamoral,\n\n9 th Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nFranz Joseph was the eldest son of Albert, 8th. Prince of Thurn and Taxis and his\n\nwife Archduchess Margarethe Klementine of Austria. He was born on 21 December\n\n1893 in Regensburg. His christening was attended by Emperor Franz Jozef of Austria.\n\nOn 6 August 1914 Franz Joseph joined the Prussian Elite Regiment Gardes du Corps.\n\nDuring the war he was promoted to lieutenant. After the war he returned to Regensburg.\n\nHe married Princess Isabel Maria of Braganza on 23 November 1920. They stayed\n\nmost of their time at Schloss Haus in Neueglofsheim.\n\nAt the age of 46, Franz Joseph served Nazi Germany in the Invasion of Poland in 1939.\n\nBy the end of June 1940, he was serving in the Battle of France. He was dismissed due\n\nto a decree from Adolf Hitler on the inability of the German Defense nobility.\n\nFranz Joseph's son Gabriel was killed in action on 17 December 1942 in the Battle of\n\nStalingrad.\n\nHe died after a severe illness on 13 July 1971 and he was interred in the burial chapel\n\nat St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg.\n\nKarl August Joseph Maria Maximilian Lamoral, 10th. Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nKarl August was born on 23 July 1898 as the third son of Albert 8th. Prince of Thurn\n\nand Taxis and his wife Archduchess Margaretha Klementine of Austria.\n\nOn 18 August 1921, he married Princess Maria Anna of Braganza . They had 4\n\nchildren. They lived at Schloss Höfling in Regensburg. Karl August forbade his\n\nchildren to join the Hitler Youth.\n\nBecauwe of his anti-Nazi attitude, Karl August was imprisoned in a Gestapo prison\n\nin Landshut from 1944 to 1945.\n\nKarl August restored interior parts of the Saint Emmeram's Abbey as well as\n\ntapestries from the 17th. and 18th. centuries.\n\nHe died on 26 April 1982 and was entombed in the chapel of Saint Emmeram's Abbey.\n\nNowadays\n\nOne of the famous members of the family is Gloria, Princess of Thurn and\n\nTaxis. She married to Johannes the 11th. Prince of Thurn and Taxis.\n\nGloria and her husband were known for their lavish lifestyle,\n\nbecoming social and fashion icons in the 1980s. She became part of\n\nthe European jet set and was referred to in the media as the\n\n\"punk princess\" and \"Princess TNT\"\n\nWhen her husband died in 1990, Gloria was left to settle his debts,\n\nwhich totaled at US$500 million. Her son, Albert, became the\n\n12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis at the time of Johannes' death.\n\nShe acted as the trustee for Albert, taking over management of the family\n\nestate, Saint Emmeram's Abbey. She went into isolation from society,\n\nstudying finance, accounting, and estate management. She sold off\n\nfamily property including art, jewelry, castles, cars, and land to preserve\n\nthe family fortune. During this time she undertook a spiritual pilgrimage to\n\nthe Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in Lourdes, France,\n\nemerging as a sobered Roman Catholic activist and philanthropist.\n\nGloria has become a successful artist, focusing mainly on portraits done with\n\noil paint and pastel. The Hotel Chelsea asked her to do a series of pastels of\n\nits most famous denizens—a gallery show which brought her much acclaim as\n\na painter. She has referred to herself as a \"dilettante\", and cites her art collection\n\nas inspiration for her contemporary style of portraiture.\n\nIn 2015 she had a solo show at the National Exemplar Gallery in New York.\n\nShe also paints freelance.\n\nIn January 2019 the El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan decided to cancel\n\nan upcoming exhibition of Gloria's work at their 50th anniversary gala\n\ndue to her right wing political stances and comments she\n\nhad made about race and AIDS.\n\nA devout Catholic, Gloria serves 300 hot meals to the poor every day from a\n\ndedicated room in her home. She also works closely with conservative\n\nTraditionalist Catholic leaders including Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò,\n\nCardinal Raymond Burke, Wilhelm Imkamp, and Steve Bannon.\n\nHer palatial home, Schloss Thurn und Taxis was suggested by\n\nBannon as a potential site for a school to educate and train right-wing\n\nCatholics, although no firm plans have been made.\n\nGloria is a personal friend of Hillary Clinton, and was one of a\n\ndozen women to attend her 2016 birthday party.\n\nAlbert 12th. Prince of Thurn and Taxis is the current head of the family. The\n\nfamily is one of the wealthiest in Germany. The family's brewery was sold to\n\nthe Paulaner Group of Munich in 1996, but it still produces beer under the\n\nbrand of Thurn und Taxis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere always is a slight confusion about the family name: 'and' is in German\n\n'und'; 'Tassis' is French, but the German name is 'Taxis'. However this princely\n\nHouse had made its goal in past and present times. Although the postal\n\nsystem luckily has changed a lot, we must not forget what they have achieved.\n\nSource pictures\n\nRegensburg: Own picture taken in 2014\n\nBrussels: Own picture taken in 2017\n\nWikipedia\n\nGloria - Book cover"
