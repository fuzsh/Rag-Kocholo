He was nicknamed as Chiquito (\"little boy\") by the early age that he started to work, fulfilling after he born in the street of Calzada de la Trinidad in the neighborhood of La Trinidad, hence his artistic name as Chiquito de la Calzada. His reputation as flamenco dancer caused that Chiquito moved along Spain acting in several theaters, and even he lived two years in Japan in the middle 80's, where he traveled to teach dance flamenco to the Japanese. In 1950 he married Josefa \"Pepita\" Garc√≠a G√≥mez, who was his long-time love.\n\nIn the early 90's, with 62 years old and after 54 years as flamenco dancer, Chiquito was discovered by the great audience appearing in the TV show Genio y figura (1994), a contest with a brand new stand up comedians where he excelled by his particular and special sense of humor.
