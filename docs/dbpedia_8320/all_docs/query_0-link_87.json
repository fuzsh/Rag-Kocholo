        "text": "Dr. John Coleman, author of The Committee of 300, tells how Mayer Amschel, the founder of the\"Red Shield\"dynasty acquired his first fortune. It is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on Judenstrasse, Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where he lived with his wife and family. The events attributed to history are often caused by a \"hidden hand\" pulling the strings of kings, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. The phenomena is explained and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the Rothschild's intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Legends has it that Mayer Amschel Rothschild's \"genius and financial skills\" were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as Dr. Coleman makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. Exactly how Mayer Amschel Rothschild \"stuck it lucky\" and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to \"virtual rulers of all Europe,\" makes fascinating reading. This outstanding book is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. It will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in Iraq and the war threats against Iran.\n\nBanking,” the 3rd Lord Rothschild once remarked, “consists essentially of facilitating the movement of money from Point A, where it is, to Point B, where it is needed.” There is a certain elementary truth in this aperçu, even if it did reflect Victor Rothschild’s personal lack of enthusiasm for finance. But if the history of the firm founded by his great-great-grandfather two centuries ago consisted of nothing more than getting money from A to B, it would make dull reading. It should not.\n\nA book that will take us to truly know this famous pyramid made up of people from times past who have carried and maintained their lineage to the present day to maintain power in the world through the political, social and economic system. The Illuminati, the famous extremely powerful elite who own all the world's banks, organizations, governments and monarchies, are the ones who really manage every detail within the entire world organizational structure starting from the tip of the pyramid at the top. which one is satan in the lead. The Illuminati are generational satanic bloodlines that have obtained the greatest power through the manipulation of the entire world system and of which each of them are the true \"elite of Satan\"."
