        "text": "Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis,[1][2] full German name: Maximilian Karl Fürst von Thurn und Taxis[1][2] (3 November 1802, Regensburg, Electorate of Bavaria[1][2] – 10 November 1871, Regensburg, Kingdom of Bavaria[1][2]) was the sixth Prince of Thurn and Taxis, head of the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post, and Head of the Princely House of Thurn and Taxis from 15 July 1827 until his death on 10 November 1871.[1]\n\nEarly life, education, and military career[]\n\nMaximilian Karl was the fourth child of Karl Alexander, 5th Prince of Thurn and Taxis and his wife Duchess Therese of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, sister of Queen Louise of Prussia. He was born on 3 November 1802 in the so-called Inner Palace of St. Emmeram's Abbey. At the age of nine, Maximilian Karl became Under Lieutenant in Bayer's Fourth Bayerrischen Cheveaulegers-Regiment König. After four years of education at Bildungsinstitut Hofwyl, a Swiss educational institution, he joined the Bavarian army on 25 August 1822. After the death of his father in 1827, Maximilian Karl asked for his dismissal from the army. Afterwards, he continued with his new role as head of the House of Thurn and Taxis, with the advisement and support of his mother.[3]\n\nMarriage and family[]\n\nMaximilian Karl married Baroness Wilhelmine of Dörnberg, daughter of Ernst, Baron of Dörnberg and his wife Baroness Wilhelmine Henriette Maximiliane of Glauburg, on 24 August 1828 in Regensburg.[1][2] Maximilian Karl and Wilhelmine had five children:[1][2]\n\nPrince Karl Wilhelm of Thurn and Taxis (14 April 1829 – 21 July 1829)[1][2]\n\nPrincess Therese Mathilde of Thurn and Taxis (31 August 1830 – 10 September 1883)[1][2]\n\nMaximilian Anton Lamoral, Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis (28 September 1831 – 26 June 1867)[1][2]\n\nPrince Egon of Thurn and Taxis (17 November 1832 – 8 February 1892)[1][2]\n\nPrince Theodor of Thurn and Taxis (9 February 1834 – 1 March 1876)[1][2]\n\nIn their seventh year of marriage, Wilhelmine died at the age of 32. Maximilian Karl mourned her death greatly and constructed the Neo-Gothic mausoleum at St. Emmeram's Abbey for her. Maximilian Karl married secondly to Princess Mathilde Sophie of Oettingen-Oettingen and Oettingen-Spielberg, daughter of Johannes Aloysius III, Prince of Oettingen-Oettingen and Oettingen-Spielberg and his wife Princess Amalie Auguste of Wrede, on 24 January 1839 in Oettingen in Bayern.[1][2] Maximilian Karl and Mathilde Sophie had twelve children:[1][2]\n\nPrince Otto of Thurn and Taxis (28 May 1840 – 6 July 1876)[1][2]\n\nPrince Georg of Thurn and Taxis (11 July 1841 – 22 December 1874)[1][2]\n\nPrince Paul of Thurn and Taxis (27 May 1843 – 10 March 1879)[1][2]\n\nPrincess Amalie of Thurn and Taxis (12 May 1844 – 12 February 1867)[1][2]\n\nPrince Hugo of Thurn and Taxis (24 November 1845 – 15 May 1873)[1][2]\n\nPrince Gustav of Thurn and Taxis (23 February 1848 – 9 July 1914)[1][2]\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Thurn and Taxis (20 February 1849 – 11 December 1849)[1][2]\n\nPrince Adolf of Thurn and Taxis (26 May 1850 – 3 January 1890)[1][2]\n\nPrince Franz of Thurn and Taxis (2 March 1852 – 4 May 1897)[1][2]\n\nPrince Nikolaus of Thurn and Taxis (2 August 1853 – 26 May 1874)[1][2]\n\nPrince Alfred of Thurn and Taxis (11 June 1856 – 9 February 1886)[1][2]\n\nPrincess Marie Georgine of Thurn and Taxis (25 December 1857 – 13 February 1909)[1][2]\n\nIn 1843, Maximilian Karl and his family moved to the newly constructed princely castle of the Thurn and Taxis family in Donaustauf, which was completed in the same year as the nearby Walhalla. The castle Donaustauf was completely destroyed during a blaze on 4 March 1880.\n\nPostal career[]\n\nIn 1827, Maximilian Karl was his father's successor as head of the private Thurn-und-Taxis-Post which had its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main. With the annexation of the Free City of Frankfurt by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866 and the forced sale of Thurn-und-Taxis-Post for three million Thalers ended the era of the Thurn and Taxis family's postal monopoly. The handover took place on 1 July 1867.[4]\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms[]\n\nTitles and styles[]\n\n3 November 1802 – 13 November 1805: His Serene Highness Prince Maximilian Karl of Thurn and Taxis\n\n13 November 1805 – 15 July 1827: His Serene Highness The Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\n15 July 1827 – 10 November 1871: His Serene Highness The Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nHonours[]\n\nGrand Master of the Order of Parfaite Amitié\n\nKnight of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece\n\nKnight of the Order of the Black Eagle\n\nAncestry[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nMartin Dallmeier / Martha Schad: The Princely House of Thurn und Taxis, Verlag Friedrich Pustet, Regensburg, Germany 1996 ISBN 3-7917-1492-9.\n\n[]"
