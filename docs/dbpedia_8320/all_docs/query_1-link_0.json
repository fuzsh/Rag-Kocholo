The couple legally divorced in 1776.[citation needed] Following the death of his first wife, Karl Anselm married that same year morganatically to Elisabeth Hildebrand.[1]\n\nAcquisition of new territories\n\n[edit]\n\nKarl Anselm acquired in 1786, the Swabian county of Friedberg-Scheer and had to spend almost the entire proceeds from the Imperial Reichspost. Thereupon the Emperor Joseph II brought the county to \"Gefürsteten Grafschaft\" status. During the invasion of French troops in the Austrian Netherlands in 1794, the local properties of the Thurn und Taxis family were seized. With the further advance of the French troops, all the possessions of the Thurn and Taxis were lost. To compensate, Karl Anselm was awarded in 1803, according to Article 13 of the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (formally the Hauptschluss der außerordentlichen Reichsdeputation, or \"Principal Conclusion of the Extraordinary Imperial Delegation\") other Swabian lands, including the Free Imperial City of Buchau, the Imperial Abbey of Buchau, the Imperial Abbeys of Marchtal and Neresheim, Ostrach, and other villages.\n\nLosses within the Reichspost\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1790, the hereditary fiefs of the Thurn and Taxis family fueled the Imperial Reichspost to its greatest extent. The Austrian Netherlands and Tyrol were added to the Thurn and Taxis postal system. Due to the Napoleonic Wars, Karl Anselm's Imperial Reichspost gradually lost more and more postal districts beginning with the Austrian Netherlands, thus depriving the post of important sources of revenue. With the Treaty of Lunéville formalized on 9 February 1801, the Imperial Reichspost lost all postal districts in the Rhine region. After Prussia had been compensated for the loss of its left-bank territories by right bank areas in May 1802, Prussia took over the sovereignty over the postal services, and so the Imperial Reichspost lost further postal districts. Only under his son and successor, Karl Alexander, was the Thurn and Taxis family able to re-establish its postal system as the private company Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nWolfgang Behringer, Thurn und Taxis, München 1990 ISBN 3-492-03336-9\n\nWolfgang Behringer, Im Zeichen des Merkur, Göttingen 2003 ISBN 3-525-35187-9\n\nWolfgang Behringer, in: Damals, Juli 2005\n\nMartin Dallmeier, Quellen zur Geschichte des europäischen Postwesens, Kallmünz 1977\n\nMartin Dallmeier und Martha Schad, Das fürstliche Haus Thurn und Taxis, 300 Jahre Geschichte in Bildern, Verlag Pustet, Regensburg 1996 ISBN 3-7917-1492-9\n\nSiegfried Grillmeyer, Habsburgs Diener in Post und Politik.
