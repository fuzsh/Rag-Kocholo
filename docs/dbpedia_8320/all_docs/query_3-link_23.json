We are happy to present to you some aspects of a culture rich in diversity. Germany…simply inspiring!\n\n:: List of Famous People from Germany ::\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\n“Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”\n\nBorn in Ulm, Germany, Albert Einstein (1879–1955) is one of the most famous scientist and mathematician who contributed to our understanding of the physical reality. He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”. Einstein, also called 20th century Genius, was the embodiment of pure intellect.\n\nClaudia Schiffer\n\nGermany is not only the land of scientists and writers, but also the land of some of the most beautiful women. Claudia Schiffer is a living catwalk beauty, a supermodel who seems to merge perfectly with the breathtaking landscapes of Germany. Claudia was the highest paid model in 1992 after signing a contract with Revlon and she graced the covers of more than 500 magazines, among them: Elle, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Playboy etc. Being contracted also as an Angel for Victoria’s Secret, this top model caused quite a sensation all through the years!\n\nJohann Wolfgang Goethe\n\n“Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men”\n\nBorn on 28 August 1749 in Frankfurt am Main, Goethe is Germany’s “greatest man of letters”. Poet, novelist, playwright, courtier, and natural philosopher, one of the key figures in Western literature, Goethe fascinated the entire world with his exceptionally prolific and versatile writing style. Goethe gained early fame with The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), but one of the peaks of world literature, his magnum opus is the poetic drama in two parts, FAUST. His influence on German philosophy is immeasurable, having major effect especially on the generation of Hegel and Schelling. He also made important discoveries regarding plant and animal life and evolved a non-Newtonian and unorthodox theory of the character of light and color.\n\nRudolf Christian Karl Diesel\n\nRudolf Diesel (1858-1913) is the exceptional German inventor of the diesel engine, an engine with great efficiency. Diesel engine allowed trains and ships to operate more efficiently with oil instead of coal. Diesel engines are now days an integrant part of the mechanical landscape and contributed to the progress of the automotive industry. Rudolf Diesel will always remain in our memory as one of the major inventors in the field of internal combustion engines.\n\nMichael Schumacher\n\n“The greatest driver the sport has ever seen, Schumacher the end of an era”, states the official website of Formula One.

Schumacher had exceptional ambition, confidence, intelligence, motivation, dedication and determination. It seems that his great achievements are unlikely to be ever surpassed.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nBach, the greatest composer of the baroque era, was to music what Newton was to science. “The works of the German composer and organist Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) are the ultimate expression of polyphony. He is probably the only composer ever able to make full use of the possibilities of art available in his time” His most famous works of intellectual depth, moreover, technical and artistic beauty, are: Brandenburg concertos; the Goldberg Variations; the English Suites, French Suites, Partitas, and Well-Tempered Clavier; the Mass in B Minor and many others.\n\nOtto von Bismarck, “The Iron Chancellor of Germany”\n\n“Anyone who has ever looked into the glazed eyes of a soldier dying on the battlefield will think hard before starting a war”\n\nBismarck dominated Germany and Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Under the leadership of the “Iron Chancellor”, Germany grew from a weak confederation of debilitated states to a strong, unified and feared empire. He won legendaries triumphs and the revolution that he carried out in order to a achieve an unified empire is by historical importance comparable to the French Revolution.\n\nJeanette Biedermann\n\nVoted in 2006 by the magazine FHM “The sexiest woman in the world”, Jeanette is both a natural German beauty and a very talented solo singer. She was awarded several times in Germany “Best Female Act”, “Best German Act”. Jeanette’s pop rock music fascinated young people all over the world.\n\nMarlene Dietrich\n\nIs the first German actress, singer and entertainer who flourished in Hollywood. What was it that made Marlene Dietrich so famous? For sure her unique way of reinventing herself throughout her career. She was mysterious, glamorous, original, beautiful, and smart.

Marlene’s first American film, Morocco, directed by von Sternberg, earned an Oscar nomination. The Blue Angel, Shanghai Express, Blonde Venus, The Scarlet Empress and The Devil is a Woman are some of the famous movies in which she acted.\n\nLevi Strauss\n\nThe great father of blue jeans, Levi Strauss, was a German entrepreneur, born in 1829.
