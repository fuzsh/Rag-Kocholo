        "text": "From wikipedia:\n\nPrince George of Greece and Denmark, known as Uncle Goggy to his family, (Greek: Πρίγκιπας Γεώργιος) (24 June 1869–25 November 1957) was the second son of King George I of the Hellenes and Grand Duchess Olga, and is remembered chiefly for having saved the life of a future Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II. He served as high commissioner of Crete during its transition towards independence from Ottoman rule and union with Greece.\n\nFrom 1883, George lived at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen with Prince Valdemar of Denmark, his father's younger brother. The king had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist him in the Danish royal navy, and consigned him to the care of Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet. Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George would later describe to his fiancée the profound attachment he developed for his uncle from that day forward.\n\nIn 1891, George accompanied his cousin the Tsarevich Nicholas on his voyage to Asia, and saved him from an assassination attempt in Japan, in what became known as the Otsu Incident.\n\nGeorge, along with his brothers Constantine and Nicolas, were involved with the organization of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. George served as president of the Sub-Committee for Nautical Sports.\n\nAlthough much of modern Greece had been independent since the 1820s, Crete remained in Ottoman hands. For the rest of the 19th century, there had been many rebellions and protests on the island. A Greek force arrived to annex the island in 1897 and the Great Powers acted, occupying the island and dividing it into British, French, Russian and Italian areas of control.\n\nIn 1898, Turkish troops were ejected and a national government was set up, still nominally under Ottoman suzerainty. Prince George, not yet thirty, was made High Commissioner, and a joint Muslim-Christian assembly was part-elected, part-appointed. However, this was not enough to satisfy Cretan nationalists.\n\nEleftherios Venizelos was the leader of the movement to reunite Crete with Greece. He had fought in the earlier revolts and was now a member of the Assembly, acting as minister of justice to Prince George. They soon found themselves opposed. George, a staunch royalist, had assumed absolute power. Venizelos led the opposition to this. In 1905, however, he summoned an illegal revolutionary assembly in Theriso, in the hills near Chania, the then capital of the island.\n\nDuring the revolt, the newly-created Cretan Gendarmerie remained faithful to George. In this difficult period, the Cretan population were divided: in the 1906 elections the pro-Prince parties took 38,127 votes, while pro-Venizelos parties took 33,279. But the Gendarmerie managed to execute its duties without taking sides. Finally, British diplomats brokered a settlement and in September 1906 George was replaced by former Greek prime minister Alexandros Zaimis, and left the island. In 1908, the Cretan Assembly unilaterally declared enosis with Greece.\n\nIn October 1912 George returned from Paris to Athens so that he could join the naval ministry as Greece prepared for war against Turkey. Later he served as aide-de-camp to King George who, however, was assassinated in March 1913. George went to Copenhagen to settle his father's financial affairs there, as he had never ceased to be a Prince of Denmark.\n\nread the entire article here.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nPrincess Marie Bonaparte (2 July 1882 - 21 September 1962) was a French author and psychoanalyst, closely linked with Sigmund Freud. Her wealth contributed to the popularity of psychoanalysis, and enabled Freud's escape from Nazi Germany.\n\nMarie Bonaparte was a great-grand-niece of Emperor Napoleon I of France. She was a daughter of Prince Roland Bonaparte (19 May 1858 - 14 April 1924) and Marie-Félix Blanc (1859-1882). Her paternal grandfather was Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte, son of Lucien Bonaparte, who was one of Napoleon's rebellious and disinherited younger brothers. For this reason, despite her title Marie was not a member of the dynastic branch of the Bonapartes who claimed the French imperial throne from exile. However, her maternal grandfather was François Blanc, the principal real-estate developer of Monte Carlo. It was from this side of her family that Marie inherited her great fortune.\n\nShe was born at Saint-Cloud, a town in Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France. Her mother died of an embolism induced by giving birth to Marie.\n\nOn 21 November 1907 in Paris, she married Prince George of Greece, the second son of King George I of the Hellenes, in a civil ceremony, with a subsequent religious ceremony on 12 December 1907, at Athens. She was thereafter officially also known as Princess Marie of Greece and Denmark. They had two children, Peter (1908-1980) and Eugénie (1910-1988).\n\nTroubled by her difficulty in achieving sexual fulfillment, Marie engaged in research. In 1924 she published her results under the pseudonym A. E. Narjani and presented her theory of \"frigidity\" in the medical journal \"Bruxelles-Médical\". Having measured the distance between the clitoris and the vagina in 243 women, she concluded after analysing their sexual history that the distance between these two organs was critical for the ability to reach orgasm (\"volupté\"); she identified women with a short distance (the \"paraclitoridiennes\") who reached orgasm easily during intercourse, and women with a distance of more than two and a half centimeters (the \"téleclitoridiennes\") who had difficulties while the \"mesoclitoriennes\" were in between. Marie considered herself a \"téleclitorienne\" and approached Josef Halban to surgically move her clitoris closer to the vagina. She underwent and published the procedure as the Halban-Narjani operation. When it proved unsuccessful in facilitating the sought-after outcome for Marie, the physician repeated the operation.\n\nRead the entire article here.\n\nWho is Eugenie?\n\nTheir daughter, SAR La Princesse Eugέnie de Grece. They had also a son, Peter, Prince of Greece and Denmark, who upon the death of King Paul and before Constantine's marriage and birth of issue, that is, from March 1964 until the summer of 1965, was second-in-line of succession to the Greek throne after Princess Irene, who became Diadoch for the aforementioned period. Princess Eugenie married HSH Prince Dominic Radziwill (1939), whom she divorced in 1948. Her second husband was HSH Prince Raymundo della Torre e Tasso, Duke of Castel Duino whom she married in 1949 and divorced in 1965. I read somewhere that either the second wedding or the honeymoon that followed took place in Athens and that the Duke of Castel Duino was caught chasing men, thus creating a big scandal considering the conservatism of the era.\n\nWhat surprises me in the above photo is that Prince George appears to wear the regalia of the Knight of the Garter. Was he a Knight of the Garter? I know that this, the highest British decoration, has been given to very few people, mostly within Britain and the Royal Family.\n\nLine II (Bohemian Line) descends from Prince Maximilian Joseph (1769-1831). Amongst his descendants are the Torre e Tasso family. In 1923 Prince Alexander (Alessandro) of Thurn und Taxis (1881-1937) became a naturalised Italian along with his two sons. The King of Italy granted him the title of Principi della Torre e Tasso, 1st Duke di Castel Duino with the qualification of Serene Highness.\n\nThe family seat is Duino Castle (Castello di Duino) in Duino, Province of Trieste. It is very impressive.\n\n-> Duino Castle, large\n\n-> Duino Castle, aerial\n\nVery impressive and it must be costly to maintain it. Thus, it is unlikely that the current Duke, Carlo Alessandro, son of Eugenie, is poor. I also understand that Eugenie had two children with Prince Radziwill, Tatiana, Madame Fruchaud and George who died childless.\n\nTherefore, given that prince Peter died childless, the surviving descendants of Prince George of Greece and Marie Bonaparte are Madame Fruchaud (granddaughter) and her children and Carlo Alessandro, 3rd Duke of Castel Duino (grandson).\n\nMy understanding is that Marie Bonaparte, albeit a descendant of an non-dynastic branch of the Napoleon House (due to a morganatic marriage) inherited a fortune in Monte Carlo etc.\n\nIt would be interesting to find out about the fate of the fortune and who has placed the jewels for auction."
