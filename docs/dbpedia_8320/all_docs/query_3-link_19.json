        "text": "On 1 April 1933, a boycott of Jewish shops was announced in all major German cities. This was the start of a barrage of anti-Jewish decrees aimed at excluding Jews from all areas of public life. Boycotts, marginalisation and persecution made life increasingly difficult and dangerous for Jews in Germany. The Nazi book burning took place on 10 May 1933, followed by the passing of the Nuremberg Race Laws in 1935, which prohibited marriage and sexual intercourse between Jews and non-Jews. With the «Kristallnacht» of 9–10 November 1938, the Nazis’ deprivation of the Jews’ civic rights reached a first culmination point.\n\nErich Elias had married Otto Frank’s sister Leni in 1921 and initially also worked for the family bank. But in autumn 1929 he was on the look-out for a new livelihood. He moved to Basel to establish a Swiss branch of Pomosin / Opekta-Werke, a company producing pectin for jam-making. Two years later, Leni followed with their younger son Buddy, their older son Stephan joined them in 1932, and in October 1933, Alice Frank also moved to Basel. Otto’s youngest brother Herbert lived in France from 1932 onwards, while his older brother Robert settled in England in 1933.\n\nOtto Frank moved to Amsterdam in 1933. With the support of his brother-in-law, Erich Elias, and his cousin, Jean-Michel Frank, he established a Dutch franchise of Opekta. Edith Frank and their daughters spent a few months with Edith’s mother, Rosa Holländer, in Aachen. In late 1933, Edith followed her husband to Amsterdam with Margot, and in February 1934, the family was reunited when Anne arrived. In March 1939, Edith’s mother also flew to Amsterdam, where she lived with the Frank family in Merwedeplein until her death in January 1942.\n\n«After May 1940 the good times were few and far between: first there was the war, then the capitulation and then the arrival of the Germans, which is when the trouble started for the Jews. Our freedom was severely restricted by a series of anti-Jewish decrees: Jews were required to wear a yellow star; Jews were required to turn in their bicycles; Jews were forbidden to use trams; Jews were forbidden to ride in cars, even their own; Jews were required to do their shopping between 3.00 and 5.00 p.m.; Jews were required to frequent only Jewish-owned barbershops and beauty salons; Jews were forbidden to be out on the streets between 8.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m.; Jews were forbidden to go to theatres, cinemas or any other forms of entertainment; Jews were forbidden to use swimming pools, tennis courts, hockey fields or any other athletic fields; Jews were forbidden to go rowing; Jews were forbidden to take part in any athletic activity in public; Jews were forbidden to sit in their gardens or those of their friends after 8.00 p.m.; Jews were forbidden to visit Christians in their homes; Jews were required to attend Jewish schools, etc. You couldn’t do this and you couldn’t do that, but life went on»\n\nIn occupied areas, Jews were drastically restricted in their professional and social lives. In July 1942, the Germans started to deport Dutch Jews, officially for “labour duty in the east”. On 5 July 1942, Margot received the written summons to register for one of these transports. One day later, on 6 July, the family goes into hiding in the secret annex of the Opekta building at Prinsengracht 263. Otto Frank and his helpers had set up the hiding place several months previously.\n\nOn 4 August, the eight in hiding are arrested and sent to the Westerbork transit camp. On 3 September, together with her sister and her parents, Anne Frank is deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp on the last transport from Westerbork. The transport in a cattle wagon lasts three days and three nights. On the trackside ramp outside Auschwitz, families are torn apart. At first, the girls remain in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp with their mother. In October they are separated from their mother and deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Edith Frank dies of starvation and exhaustion in Auschwitz-Birkenau on 6 January. Anne and Margot die from disease in March 1945. Otto Frank is the only one of the eight inhabitants of the secret annex to survive the labour and concentration camps."
