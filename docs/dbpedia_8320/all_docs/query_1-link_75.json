        "text": "Prince Karl Anselm Franz Joseph Wilhelm Louis Philippe Gero Maria of Urach, Count of Württemberg, 4th Duke of Urach was born on the 5 February 1955 in Regensburg, Germany, the son of Prince Erbhard of Urach and Princess Iniga of Thurn and Taxis and a grandson of King Mindaugas II of Lithuania.\n\nPrince Karl Anselm succeeded his uncle Karl Gero as Duke of Urach and titular King of Lithuania following his death in 1981 and held the Ducal title until 1991 when he renounced it due to his morganatic marriage. It is implied that he also renounced his Lithuanian rights, since the succession laws would be the same and if his morganatic offspring are unable to succeed to a Ducal title it is much less likely they could succeed to a Royal one. His brother Wilhelm Albert succeeded him in his titles.\n\nKarl Anselm is the owner of Greshornish Forestry estate in Inverness, Scotland.\n\nHe married Saskia Wüsthof (born 1968) on February 9, 1991 at Stuttgart. They had two children before divorcing in 1996.\n\n* Wilhelm Fürst von Urach, born 8 July 1991\n\n* Maximilian Fürst von Urach, born 5 May 1993\n\nExternal references"
