Karl Anselm Franz Joseph Wilhelm Louis Philippe Gero Maria, 4th Duke von Urach, Count von Württemberg (born 5 February 1955) is the former head of the morganatic Urach branch of the House of Württemberg.[1][2] He was the third pretender to the defunct Lithuanian throne following the death of his uncle, Karl Gero.

Biography[edit]

He was born in Regensburg, West Germany, the son of Prince Eberhard von Urach and Princess Iniga of Thurn and Taxis.[3] He is a grandson of Wilhelm, Duke von Urach,[3] who was from 11 July 1918 to November 1918 the King-elect Mindaugas II of Lithuania.[4] The title "Duke of Urach" was abolished alongside all other noble privileges in Germany in 1919, with hereditary titles thereafter being relegated to surnames.[5]

He became an engineer, having studied agronomy at the University of Kiel.[4] Karl Anselm succeeded his childless uncle Karl Gero as fourth Duke von Urach following his death in 1981.[4][6][self-published source?] He held the defunct ducal title until 9 February 1991 when he married a commoner and renounced it.[4] His brother Wilhelm Albert succeeded him as head of the Urach branch of the House of Württemberg.[4] Karl Anselm lives at Niederaichbach Castle, Bavaria, and is the owner of Greshornish Forestry estate in Inverness, Scotland.[1]
