I am here today to write to you about a movie that is held very highly among many movie geeks, but for some reason I can’t help but loving the original so much more, especially (but not exclusively) because hardly anyone has ever heard of it.\n\nAny movie that has Sean Penn fucking (excuse my French, but this ain’t Disneyland) Jennifer Lopez (back when she was young, cute, and naturally hot) in the dirt, is surely a justifiable way to spend the evening. That movie is U-Turn, helmed by Oliver Stone with visuals brought to you by Robert Richardson (before he switched sides and started working with Quentin Tarantino). For me personally, it was an introduction to Billy Bob Thornton, and I dug Nick Nolte in it, too. I always thought it was a decent midnight movie with A-actors and a B-story. But that was until I saw another movie on TV years later, at midnight. And I thought, oh man, that’s a midnight movie, and it’s the same story, but it suddenly feels A-class, and the actors are still A-class."
