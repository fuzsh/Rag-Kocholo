        "text": "Featuring a virtuoso performance by Nicolas Cage, John Dahl‘s Red Rock West defines the 1990’s Rural Noir.\n\nReleased in the aftermath of the early 1990’s recession, Dahl co-wrote the screenplay with his brother, Rick Dahl. With supporting turns from the likes of Dennis Hopper, J.T. Walsh and Lara Flynn Boyle, Red Rock West expands and improves upon Dahl’s 1989 debut, Kill Me Again.\n\nShot in Arizona against a 7 million dollar budget, Red Rock West’s path to a wide theatrical release was as twisty as its plot.\n\nThe film premiered in France in June 1993, before moving to HBO that fall. European screenings caught the eye of curators in both Toronto and California, which lead to Red Rock West’s inclusion at TIFF, as well as a long successful run at San Francisco’s iconic Roxie Theatre.\n\nAfter months of growing buzz, Red Rock West finally earned a National release. It opened in New York and Los Angeles in April 1994, nearly a year after its initial debut.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n‘Red Rock West’ (1993): Spoiler-Free Synopsis\n\nMichael (Nicolas Cage) is an unemployed drifter, living in his car. Down on his luck after a military discharge, Michael travels from Texas to Wyoming in search of work.\n\nWhen an oilfield job offer falls through, Michael spends his last five dollars on gasoline and heads for the nearest town, Red Rock West.\n\nOnce in town, the first place he visits is a bar. The first person he meets is a bartender named Wayne (J.T. Walsh).\n\nWayne mistakes Michael for “Lyle from Dallas,” a hit man that he’s hired to kill his wife.\n\nDesperate for money, Michael plays along, thinking he can keep the up-front portion of the cash and skip town without hurting anyone.\n\nLater that day, Michael approaches the bartender’s wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), and reveals what Wayne has planned. Suzanne makes Michael a counter-proposal, offering another healthy sum for him to kill her husband instead.\n\nFlush with cash, Michael waits for dark and speeds away. But just after he rolls across the boundary line, he accidentally runs over a pedestrian.\n\nDespite a brief moment of indecision, Michael’s conscience wins the day. He collects the injured man and takes him back to Red Rock Hospital for treatment.\n\nThe man survives, but the medical staff is skeptical of Michael. They make him fill out a pile of paperwork and wait for the police. A pair of cops show up, and eventually the Sheriff too. And just when things seem like they can’t get any worse, they do. The Sheriff looks familiar. A little too familiar. The Sheriff is Wayne—the bartender.\n\nMichael never should have come to Red Rock West.\n\nJust wait until the real “Lyle from Dallas” shows up…\n\nOpinion: My Thoughts On ‘Red Rock West’ (1993)\n\nThe first thing you notice about Red Rock West is the colour palette. Grainy browns, hazy whites, washed out reds and blues. Like a faded cotton t-shirt, or a postcard that’s been left out in the sun, these are the visual hallmarks of the atmospheric Neo-noir.\n\nThis added depth and texture gives Red Rock West more cinematic cogency than Dahl’s debut. With many scenes taking place outdoors, it also feels more expansive. We are no longer confined to the cluttered offices, grimy motel rooms and crowded casino floors of Kill Me Again.\n\nI’m also a big fan of the prologue.\n\nRed Rock West’s opening scene dispenses with the gimmicky temporal shifts or the cheesy hooks so prevalent in the action thriller movies of the eighties and nineties.\n\nThere’s no time dependent crisis that only a hero can solve. There’s no evil genius forcing the protagonist to choose between saving the world and saving his family.\n\nIn other words, the hook is that there is no hook.\n\nThe prologue simply tells us what kind of movie we are watching—and what kind we’re not.\n\nNo need for world building here. This story takes place firmly in OUR world, and the film wants us to know it. Objects, landscape and clothing convey time, place and context.\n\nNo one tells us what kind of man Michael is. We learn about him by the way he uses his environment as he cleans up for the job interview. We know he’s ex-military before he even opens his mouth to tell us.\n\nThe prologue also invokes the first of many Western tropes that underscore the broader narrative.\n\nMichael is the stranger that comes to town. His white Cadillac tells us he’s the good guy, or at the very least, the best worst guy in a movie full of scoundrels.\n\nStory\n\nRed Rock West’s initial story setup should be familiar to fans of Jim Thompson’s rural Neo-noirs:\n\nA malleable drifter rolls into town and gets caught between a woman and a pile of cash (After Dark, My Sweet, 1955).\n\nA corrupt small town Sheriff runs amok until his power to deceive finally wanes. (The Killer Inside Me, 1952)\n\nBut the Dahl Brothers diverge quickly from these tropes, employing plot twists and misdirection more akin to Joel and Ethan Coen’s early masterpiece, Blood Simple (1983).\n\nChief among these devices is that of mistaken identity: first when Michael is confused for Lyle, and later, in the third act, when we discover that Suzanne and Wayne are also opportunistic imposters.\n\nWhen executed properly, such devices add narrative drive to a text that would otherwise be lifeless.\n\nHaving said that, too many twists, with too little relevance, can frustrate the audience into a state of ambivalence. For a practical example of this mistake in action, check out Amsterdam (2022).\n\nSo how do writers perpetuate narrative drive without relying too heavily on rhetorical gimmicks?\n\nOne option is to use found objects to keep the viewer engaged. Most (good) mysteries use a “Chekhov’s gun” style approach: seemingly irrelevant objects appear briefly at the outset, taking on increased significance as the plot unfolds.\n\nWhat would M. Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense (1999) have been without the wedding ring? Probably a lot like Old (2021).\n\nAnother source of narrative drive can be progressive repetition. Read any novel by Stephen King and tell me I’m wrong.\n\nBut progressive repetition gets tedious if said repetition is employed simply for a technical effect like ramping up suspense.\n\nIn other words, the style and degree of repetition must mirror the nature of the story and its main protagonist.\n\nIn Red Rock West, Michael is the quintessential “honest thief.” He lives by a Robin Hood style code from which he never deviates. He thinks nothing of stealing money from another crook, and yet, he still can’t bring himself to lie on a job application or ignore a person in distress.\n\nMichael’s honesty is thus what drives the plot in the gaps between the major twists.\n\nThe job application, telling Suzanne the truth about her husband, collecting the injured pedestrian, admitting to Lyle that he’s an ex-Marine, going back to Suzanne’s house to rescue her from Lyle—all of these decisions serve to drive, complicate, and amplify the basic plot.\n\nCrucially, Michael’s repeated inability to make the wrong decision seems completely consistent with the characterization presented in the film’s opening scenes, thereby creating a film with both narrative drive AND contextual plausibility.\n\nFemme Fatale\n\nAs a fictional character, Suzanne is a more complex Femme Fatale than Kill Me Again’s Fay Forrester (Joanne Whalley).\n\nLike Fay, Suzanne is both a victim and a perpetrator: the victim of an abusive husband, while also a thief and an adulterer in her own right.\n\nIn fact, Suzanne inspires the question: “What if Fay Forrester had survived Kill Me Again? What kind of life would she be leading next? What kind of man would she seek out?”\n\nBut Suzanne’s crimes stem far beyond the scope of Fay’s relatively minor infractions. She is wanted on a Federal Warrant. Her options are death, escape or a long custodial sentence. The stakes are simply much higher: Suzanne has nothing to lose.\n\nAnd yet, despite such fertile ground, Lara Flynn Boyle’s performance is entirely underwhelming.\n\nWhen the second twist is revealed, and we realize Wayne and Suzanne are criminal imposters, we just aren’t convinced she could have pulled it off.\n\nHad she starred alongside anyone but Cage and Hopper, her acting liabilities would have been more painfully exposed. But luckily for Boyle, we’re all so mesmerized by those two maniacs, we often forget she’s even there.\n\nThe truth is Boyle’s Suzanne lacks the essential contradiction possessed by every memorable Femme Fatale: Push and Pull.\n\nThe Femme Fatale must attract and repel. Seduce and reject. She’s The Madonna AND The Whore. You’d lie and cheat and steal for her. You’d probably die for her too.\n\nBut Lara Flynn Boyle’s Suzanne is not a woman you would die for. She’s not even worthy of a painful death. Michael simply throws her off the train and continues living his meager life.\n\nDennis Hopper\n\nLegendary actor/director Dennis Hopper plays “Lyle from Dallas,” a slightly different take on “Vince,” the heartless killer portrayed so well by Michael Madsen in Dahl’s debut, Kill Me Again.\n\nLike Madsen, Hopper gives us a character who has no limits. We don’t trust him, the other characters don’t trust him, and he doesn’t even trust himself.\n\nBut while Vince is a true psychopath, a man who kills for next to nothing, “Lyle From Dallas” is more complicated.\n\nLyle is as businessman, a professional. Always in black, with a big black car, he puts on a kind of Johnny Cash persona.\n\nIn other words, he puts effort into his personal style and presentation—his brand—so to speak. He’s friendly and polite, particularly to strangers. Having served in the military, he considers himself a citizen and a patriot.\n\nThese traits help Lyle camouflage a deep-seated sense of rage and insecurity, and perhaps, a degree of femininity.\n\nLyle is desperate to be liked, even by his victims. The slightest hint of disrespect ignites a furious release of violence. Consider this passage, just after Lyle kidnaps Wayne, Suzanne and Michael at gunpoint:\n\n“Scotch ain’t good enough? Oh I knew a guy like you once. Thought he was better than everybody else. Hot shit, ain’t you Mike? You think you’re better than me? You think you’re hot shit, don’t ya Mike? Hey cowboy—who’s got the gun? You keep your foot on the gas.”\n\nHopper’s “Lyle From Dallas” is not a true psychopath. He’s absolutely a sociopath, and more than likely a narcissist too. We wonder about his time in the military, presumably in Vietnam, and how those missions shaped his worldview and psychology. We wonder why and how he was discharged from service.\n\nPart of what makes Red Rock West a superior film to Kill Me Again is its use of mirroring. All the characters mirror each other in one way or another, which adds both depth and ambiguity to the narrative.\n\nA more complex protagonist therefore requires a more complex villain. Lyle From Dallas is more than just a Western-style villain, dressed in black with a big black hat (or car). As a former marine, a transient, and a hired gun, Lyle is a possible version of Michael’s future life.\n\nBy defeating Lyle, Michael rejects a future of violence, delusion and materialism, thereby defeating those same tendencies within himself.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nIn Red Rock West, wisely, Nicolas Cage plays it straight.\n\nOne can imagine him engaging in a tit-for-tat maximalist acting battle with Dennis Hopper, like he did with John Travolta in Face/Off (1997), and with himself in The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent (2022).\n\nBut with just a few well-timed outbursts, and presumably very little improvisation, Cage gives the cast, the setting and the story enough room to breathe.\n\nCage stays in his lane with an understated, brooding performance that successfully conveys the essential conflict contained within the psyche of the film’s protagonist.\n\nMichael is a man whose good intentions collide with his survival instinct. A man who does the right thing at the wrong time and get punished for it, every time.\n\nHe’s not the power hungry megalomaniac of Scarface (1932). He’s not the desperate loser of Night and The City (1950). He’s not the naive bumpkin of The Green Cockatoo (1937). Nor is he the grieving addict of Dahl’s first film, Kill Me Again (1989).\n\nCage’s Michael is a man of rules and principles, a disciplined outsider that lives by his own strict code.\n\nEchoing Frank in Michael Mann’s Thief and Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik’s Killing Them Softly, his time on screen possesses existential circularity. He wanders into the story the same way he wanders out of it.\n\nMichael enters Red Rock West without a past, and exits the film without a future. Without money, friends or prospects, what he gains is purely introspective. He knows, without a doubt, that he can only rely on himself.\n\nAnalysis: ‘Red Rock West’ Explained\n\nGiven the year of its release, just 18 months after the end of the First Gulf War, Red Rock West is a metaphor for the U.S. military’s involvement in Middle East conflict zones.\n\nThe clue is in a line of dialogue early in the film’s first act: “Half now, half later.”\n\nAt the bar, Wayne makes Michael an “offer he can’t refuse.” While this is a common trope in both Film Noir and Hardboiled Fiction, here it represents the cash bonuses paid to military recruits to entice them to enlist.\n\nRecruits often hail from regions of the country with substandard levels of economic opportunity, a transaction that has much in common with the standard Film Noir trope.\n\nThe second clue is somewhat more obvious: both Lyle and Michael are former Marines. Lyle is even injured at the cemetery when he’s pushed against a sword protruding from an elaborate war memorial.\n\nNext, consider Michael’s activities throughout the film and how they mirror those of U.S. Forces in Kuwait and Iraq:\n\nHe crosses the Texas border.\n\nHe enters the jurisdiction of Wyoming, seeking earnings ultimately produced by oil and gas extraction.\n\nHe engages in a conflict under false pretenses.\n\nOnce he has possession of the money, he tries to leave—but can’t. Every time he tries to leave Red Rock West behind, some kind of moral responsibility prevents him from doing so.\n\nAfter the situation escalates to the point of crisis, Michael steals a bunch of money and kills a bunch of people as he makes a protracted retreat.\n\nThe retreat does not go as planned.\n\nMichael ultimately loses everything and leaves town in roughly the same condition as he arrived.\n\nThe final clue is in the title.\n\nThere are lots of towns across America called “Red Rock.” In Wyoming, many businesses and even a National Park also bear the name. But how many are called Red Rock West?\n\nZero.\n\nYou’ll also note the absence of rocks in the film, particularly red ones.\n\nSo—if the title is purely symbolic, and “West” becomes the operative word in the hypothesis, is it possible that “Red Rock West” is a semantic equivalent for “Iraq West?”\n\nWatch the film and decide for yourself.\n\nIs ‘Red Rock West’ Worth Watching?\n\nA perfectly executed genre film, Red Rock West is absolutely worth watching. Film Noir afficionados will likely want to watch it more than once.\n\nFor viewers less enthralled with the genre, the acting performances, dramatic tension and cinematography will still provide a positive experience.\n\nCountry Music legend Dwight Yoakam in his feature film debut.\n\nRegardless of individual tastes, the bottom line is Red Rock West deserves more canonical respect.\n\nThirty years on from its release, the time has come for a critical re-assessment, similar to that received by Michael Mann’s Thief when it turned thirty back in 2011.\n\nJust as Thief received retroactive praise for inspiring rafts of other urban Neon Noirs, so too should Red Rock West for its influence on the Rural Neo-noir.\n\nI encourage everyone to watch the film and voice their opinions accordingly.\n\nYou can rent Red Rock West on most streaming platforms. A pirated, low quality version is (usually) available on Vimeo.\n\nNicolas Cage’s next film was Deadfall, the failed 1993 crime drama directed by his brother, Christopher Coppola.\n\nBuilding on his performance as “Lyle From Dallas,” Dennis Hopper’s next role was a very similar villain in the 1994 action thriller blockbuster, Speed.\n\nRed Rock West featured a cameo by country western star Dwight Yoakam, who also contributed music to the soundtrack. Yoakam went on to forge a successful acting career that continues to this day."
