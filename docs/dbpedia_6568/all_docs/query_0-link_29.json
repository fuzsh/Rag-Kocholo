As David Lynch would probably say - i'll meditate on it for a while.\n\nLast Impressions said:\n\nLove it - after my recent TP binge , i had a similar idea to try and make an edit featuring the various actors but its just too much of a big task at the moment. As David Lynch would probably say - i'll meditate on it for a while.\n\nThanks Last Impressions!\n\nI have more ideas about Twin Peaks!\n\nI’m planning to make a trilogy of Fake Twin Peaks movies if this edit turns out well.\n\nTo expand/explore that universe is very interesting.\n\nThis is my idea for the intro!\n\nEach movie will have a different song and for this I have chosen \"I'm waiting here\" by David Lynch & Lykke Li\n\nfrom the David Lynch album \"The Big Dream\".\n\nNot sure about the fonts!\n\nI have tried to make them like in the show but they may better work in white like in Fire Walk With Me.\n\nAny feedback is welcome!\n\nPassword:fanedit.org\n\nReally excited to watch this! Red Rock West is one of my favorite movies but I'm not a fan of the score so I love what you're doing audio wise. It definitely has more of a Lynch vibe even in the Dahl parts (ha). I'm more of a Twin Peaks novice although I love Fire Walk With Me so I'm really pumped for this.\n\nReally excited to watch this!
