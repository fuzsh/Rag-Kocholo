        "text": "3. Literature By Bullen\n\nAs important as Bullen was, a modern reader must always bear in mind that he is an unreliable, if enthusiastic, source.\n\nBullen was a prolific writer over a long span of years. In collecting his works you have two choices for arranging them: wide (mostly on one page) or deep (in a hierarchy of pages). Once you commit to one organization you're stuck with it, because Bullen is a frequently cited writer and many things will refer back to individual pieces (which should stay put). I've opted for wide here, which will make this a long (but easily searchable) Notebook.\n\nFirst I'll collect the several series which Bullen wrote, and then miscellaneous articles. The series are:\n\n\"Discursions of a Retired Printer\"\n\n\"Collectanea Typographica\"\n\n[Six articles on the evolution of machine composition (1924)]\n\nMiscellaneous Articles by Bullen\n\nBullen wrote both under his own name and as \"Quadrat.\"\n\nHis articles, while frequently incorrect and misleading, are often the best available sources of illustrations from the history of type (especially portraits). In the reprints here, I will frequently (but inconsistently) break these out as image files. It makes this page harder to read, but it's good material.\n\n3.1. \"Discursions of a Retired Printer\"\n\n[click image to read]\n\nNo. 4 (October, 1906)\n\n\"Quadrat\" [Henry Lewis Bullen]. \"Discursions of a Retired Printer.\" The Inland Printer. Vol. 38, No. 1 (October, 1906): 33-38. Subjects: \"First Type Cast in America. - The Earlier Typefounders - Origins of Existing Typefoundries. - First Type and Printing-Presses Made in the West. - American Origins of Metal Shaving Machines, Stereotype Blocks and Type-Casting Machine - the Wealthiest Typefounder.\"\n\n[click image to read]\n\nNo. 7 (January, 1907)\n\n\"Quadrat\" [Henry Lewis Bullen]. \"Discursions of a Retired Printer, No. 7.\" The Inland Printer. Vol. 38, No. 4 (January, 1907): 513-521. Subjects: \"The Three Great Reforms in Typemaking. - The Originators of the American Point, Unit-Set, and Lining Systems for Type. - A Typefounder's Invention which Overcame a Serious Obstacle to the Success of the Linotype. - Sidelights on the Invention of the Linotype. - A Printer Who Invented the Pianola.\"\n\nScanned by Google from the University of Minnesota copy and available via the Hathi Trust (Hathi ID: umn.31951001898763b).\n\nI wish I trusted Bullen more, because this is in many respects a very interesting treatise on oft-ignored issues such as lining systems.\n\nThis article also contains a number of other interesting points: (1) It contains one of the two references in the literature (both by Bullen) to the notion that Linn Boyd Benton in 1882 contemplated a type justifying or setting machine. (2) It acknowledges that William Schraubstadter was involved with pantographic matrix engraving (though he dates this to 1881 (rather than 1882), says that Schraubstadter \"made\" his machine (when Werner's account indicates that the Central Type Foundry pantograph was acquired from the Cincinnati Type Foundry, who in turn imported it from Germany), and it denies to that it was sufficiently precise (though it was used to cut several faces commercially and together with a machine patterned after it was used by Schroeder and Werner to cut such faces as DeVinne). (3) It tells a story of a relationship between the Linotype and Benton organizations which, without the embellishments of his 1922 fabrication, might even be true.\n\nIt also contains good portraits of John Marder, Linn Boyd Benton, William Schraubstadter, and Henry Barth. Portraits of Schraubstadter, in particular, are hard to find. I've extracted these from the two Google scans of this volume. The portraits of Marder and Benton are from the scan of the Univ. of Minnesota copy (the same one from which the PDF of the entire article, above, is taken). The illustrations in this scan share the same degree of wretchedness as those in the other. The portraits of Schraubstadter and Barth are from the Google scan of the Univerisity of Michigan copy (available via the Hathi Trust; Hathi ID: mdp.39015086781294). These two images are marginally better than the UMN versions (but the Michigan scan of the text crops content). The \"screening\"/moire issues are present in the original digitizations. None of these four perfectionists would have found these digital versions of their portraits even remotely acceptable.\n\n[click image to view larger]\n\n[click image to view larger]\n\n[click image to read]\n\nNo. 10 (May, 1907)\n\nQuadrat [Henry Lewis Bullen]. \"Discursions of a retired Printer,\" No. 10.

Collectanea Typographica (1918-1931)\n\nFor an index into this series, see James Eckman's The Collectanea Typographica of Henry Lewis Bullen, reprinted above .\n\n[NONE REPRINTED HERE YET]\n\n3.3. [Six articles on the evolution of machine composition]\n\nPlease note that almost everything that Bullen says about Ottmar Mergenthaler and about Benton's engraving machines is wrong.\n\nHand-Set to Machine-Set Composition (1924)\n\nBullen, Henry Lewis. \"The Transition from Hand-Set to Machine-Set Composition.\" The Inland Printer, Vol. 72, No. 4 (January, 1924).\n\nFirst in a series of six articles.\n\n[click image to read]\n\nOn the Linotype, Part 1 (1924)\n\nBullen, Henry Lewis. \"Origin and Development of the Linotype Machine, Part 1.\" The Inland Printer. Vol. 72, No. 5 (February, 1924): 769-771.\n\nThis portion covers the early development through the \"second band machine\" of 1884. It illustrates the \"Rotary Impression Machine\" of about 1879 (along with a reproduction from a matrix made on it), and the Second Band Machine. For reasons unknown, it is basically a piece of character assassination directed against Ottmar Mergenthaler.\n\nThis digitization was done by me at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) Memorial Library Department of Special Collections, using their overhead document scanner. It suffers from the limitations of such a scanner, but is still readable. My thanks and apologies to the dedicated reference librarian there who stayed late waiting for my 300dpi scans to download via a USB interface that I believe was developed by Samuel Morse himself.\n\nSecond in a series of six articles.\n\n[click image to read]\n\nOn the Linotype, Part 2 (1924)\n\nBullen, Henry Lewis. \"Origin and Development of the Linotype Machine, Part 2.\" The Inland Printer. Vol. 72, No. 6 (March, 1924): 936-938.\n\nCuriously, Bullen's account here of the origins of Benton's pantograph and its capacity to cut punches in steel contradicts his own account from 1922. Both accounts are incorrect, but the present one is less wrong than the earlier one.\n\nScanned by DMM from an original.

It's good to have public domain digital versions of each (as these are). The first is of a \"Blower\" Linotype (as it became known later). The second is of a Benton pantograph of a style covered in his earlier (1885) patent, adapted for the cutting of patrices and/or punches.\n\n[click image to view larger]\n\nBoth of the images above link to reduced size JPEG conversions of the original scans.

Vol. 73, No. 1 (April, 1924): 65-67.\n\nThe Rogers Typograph which is the first subject of this article is unrelated to the later (and very successful) Ludlow Typograph Machine. Although the Rogers Typograph was almost unknown in the US in the 20th century, its manufacture continued in Germany until the 1960s. Bullen places the portrait of Frank Hinman Pierpont in this article (as Pierpont was involved in the early work setting up the manufacture of the Rogers Typograph in Germany), but he could equally well have put it in the next article (as Pierpont's major contribution to the history of type was as the works manager for The Monotype Corporation in England). As Bullen notes, as a young clerk in a patent attorney's office Pierpont was also associated with the (slightly infamous) Paige Compositor patent; he signed it as a witness.\n\nThe machine that Bullen calls says was \"called the Junior Mergenthaler\" was in fact called the \"Linotype Jr.\", as he might have ascertained by reading the advertisements for it in The Inland Printer when it was released.\n\nScanned by DMM from an original.

Vol. 4, No. 12 (September 1887): 801-802. This was published anonymously, but it must have been the article that Bullen refers to in his \"Collectanea Typographica\" column in The Inland Printer, Vol. 69, No. 1 (April, 1922): 96.\n\nScanned by DMM from an original copy.\n\nThis article contains a fine portrait of David Bruce, Jr.:\n\n[click image to view larger]\n\nThe image above links to a reduced-resolution JPEG version of this images.

Reprinted here together with p. 96 of the same issue, which is a part of Bullen's \"Collectanea Typographica\" series.\n\nEckman (p. ix) refers to this 1922 article as an \"augmented\" version of Bullen's 1887 articles, but it is really an entirely different piece.\n\nScanned by Google from the University of Michigan copy and available via The Hathi Trust (Hathi ID: mdp.39015086783506).\n\nBullens 1887 articles on Bruce, and their 1922 expanded version, present a fine conundrum. On the one hand, Bullen notes that in 1887 he interviewed Bruce himself, and that he had access to the Bruce manuscripts which have since been published by James Eckman. So this article should be one of our most valuable sources on Bruce. On the other hand, Bullen is an unreliable source. (See for example the story he fabricated about the origins of Benton's pantographs, which is still being repeated today as if it were true.) In this present article there is at least one important point which is demonstrably in error: he makes an issue of the discharging pin (so called) of the pivotal type caster, yet he completely misunderstands the way in which it functions.\n\n[click image to read]\n\nOn Benton (1922)\n\nBullen, Henry Lewis. \"Linn Boyd Benton - The Man and His Work.\" The Inland Printer, Vol. 70, No. 1 (October, 1922): frontis, pp. 60-64.\n\nThis is an important source both for Benton and for ATF matrix making methods. It must be treated with great caution, however, as Bullen is not a reliable source. In this article, his discussion of Ottmar Mergenthaler's involvement with the Linotype is inaccurate, his story of the evolution of Benton's pantograph into a punch-cutting machine cannot be correct, and his story of the reasons for Benton's original development of a pantograph engraver, even if true, is misleading. These errors cast doubt upon the entire article. See the presentation of this article in the Linn Boyd Benton Notebook for links to discussions of these problems.\n\nThis volume of The Inland Printer has been digitized by Google from the University of Michigan copy and is available via The Hathi Trust (Hathi ID: mdp.39015086783449).
