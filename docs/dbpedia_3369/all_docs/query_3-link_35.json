        "meta_description": "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the nation's oldest state university, with a rich history of more than two centuries. This virtual museum retells that history much as a physical museum might do, with texts and images arranged in a series of roughly chronological exhibits. Along the way, there is much for the university's friends to take pride in, and other truths that are now painful to remember. The virtual museum is Carolina's open eye to its own past.",

        "text": "The university opened this dormitory in 1924 and named it for Dr. Richard Henry Lewis, a member of the Board of Trustees and a prominent physician. A native of Pitt County, North Carolina, Lewis enrolled at UNC in 1866 and attended until 1868, when the university closed. He then went to the University of Virginia for a brief stint, finally graduating from the University of Maryland in 1871 with an M.D. degree. From 1892 until 1909 he served as Secretary of the North Carolina State Board of Health. In that office, he began regular examinations of public water supplies, a sanitary engineering service, and programs for protecting children from epidemics. He also taught at the university’s medical school and at the one for African Americans at Shaw University in Raleigh.\n\nFind Lewis Residence Hall on the campus map."
