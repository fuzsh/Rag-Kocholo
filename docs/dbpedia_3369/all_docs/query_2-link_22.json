        "text": "Definitions\n\nThis page reports on the population distribution in Beacon Light/Berkley, both in terms of raw head counts, and in terms of population density per square mile.\n\nPopulation: count of all residents of the given entity at the time of the survey, excluding visitors\n\nPopulation Density: population divided by the total land area of the entity (i.e., excluding water areas contained in the entity)\n\nUnlike the other geographical entities detailed on this site, neighborhoods are not recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau. To overcome this we have computed reasonable estimates of the same statistics that are presented for other the entity types. Each statistic is computed as the weighted sum or average of the census tracts or block groups that overlap the neighborhood. A weighted sum is used for counts of people or households, and a weighted average is used for statistics that are themselves some form of average, such as median household income. Census block groups are preferred when the statistic in question is available on the block group level. The weight for a given tract (or block group) is computed as the population of the census tabulation blocks that occupy the intersection between the tract and the neighborhood as a fraction of the total population of the neighborhood."
