        "text": "Live Your Adventure in Martinsburg-Berkeley County, West Virginia\n\nJust a little over an hour west of Washington DC, where rivers meet mountains and history happens, Berkeley County WV is the perfect destination for folks that love history. From George Washington to geocaching, railroads to rivers, Martinsburg, Berkeley County West Virginia is at the heart of amazing stories and historic significance.\n\nBerkeley County became official in 1772 when it was formed from Frederick County VA–our neighbor to the South. As a hub that connects East to west and North to South, we’ve had a front row seat for change–from fossils to frontier life, the founding of a nation to brother fighting brother, the iron horse to the automobile.\n\nWhen the B&O railroad arrived in Martinsburg in the 1840s, it not only became a hub of commerce, but the Historic Roundhouse they built also became a hub in many chapters of the American story. The Martinsburg Roundhouse is open for tours Monday – Friday from April through October with a ten day advance appointment.\n\nBuilt of native limestone in the late 1770s to early 1780s, the Adam Stephen House is a fine example of colonial stone architecture. The house has been restored and is furnished with period pieces. Adjoining it is the Triple Brick Museum, built in 1874 and rented out as housing to railroad workers. The building now contains a museum of artifacts and life memorabilia in old Martinsburg. The Adam Stephen house is open for tours on weekends from April through the end of October.\n\nVisit the childhood home of Belle Boyd, a Confederate spy. This stalwart young woman crossed military lines several times to pass information to General Stonewall Jackson during the Civil War. The Belle Boyd House also serves as the county’s historical museum and is the location of the county Visitors Center. The Belle Boyd house is open 7 days a week. Hours: Weekdays 9-4 and weekends 9-4. Located next door to the Belle Boyd house, the Historical Society has a wealth of photographs, family records, maps, books, microfiche and more.\n\nVisit www.travelwv.com for more information.\n\nRelated"
