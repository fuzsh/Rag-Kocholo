        "text": "How do I complete my 2024-2025 Free Application for Financial Aid (FAFSA)?\n\nReminder: The New FAFSA Form for 2024–25 is LIVE! The financial aid and scholarships office expects to have financial aid packages available for continuing students beginning in May 2024, provided that students complete their aid application by the priority deadline of May 2, 2024.\n\nPlease view Start Your 2024–25 FAFSA® Form for step-by-step instructions on completing the FAFSA. U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens may complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by going to studentaid.gov. Log into your account to complete the 2024-25 FAFSA. Non-U.S. citizens eligible for in-state tuition under AB 540 may complete the California Dream Act Application (CADAA) at https://dream.csac.ca.gov. Log into your account to complete the 2024-25 CADAA.\n\nWhat is the timeline for 2024-2025 Financial Aid?\n\n2024–25 Financial Aid Timeline:\n\nApplication Processing | Once we receive your application data from the Department of Education or the California Student Aid Commission, we will inform you by posting a message in the Communications section of My Finances on CalCentral.\n\nForm Corrections | The Department of Education has announced that students will be able to start making corrections to their FAFSA in the first half of March. Corrections for the CADAA are currently available.\n\nVerification | The verification process will start in April this year instead of February, as in prior years, and a smaller percentage of students will need to complete verification for 2024–25. If selected, you'll be notified in CalCentral and may have additional actions to take. Complete these tasks by the June 30, 2024, priority deadline to ensure your financial aid will be ready to disburse at the start of the Fall 2024 semester.\n\nAward Notification | We will email you when your financial aid offer is available for your review in May.\n\nAppeals | The Economic Hardship Appeal will be available in summer 2024. The exact date will be shared on our website when available.\n\nGuidance for Mixed Status Families having difficulties completing the FAFSA is available at https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/FASFA-Mixed-Status-Families-and-FSA-IDs.pdf and on our FAFSA Simplification webpage.\n\nWhat is the Student Aid Index (SAI)?\n\nBeginning with the 2024-2025 award year, the Student Aid Index (SAI) will replace the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) in determining how much federal student aid you would receive if you attended the school. You can find more information on SAI at studentaid.gov.\n\nThe SAI, or the student aid index, replaces the EFC, or the expected family contribution, on the 2024-2025 FAFSA. Please review the FAFSA Simplification web page for answers to frequently asked questions.\n\nDo veterans' education and noneducation benefits need to be reported as untaxed income on the FAFSA?\n\nEffective with the 2024-25 award year, veterans' educational and noneducation benefits are no longer reported as untaxed income on the FAFSA. Veterans' noneducation benefits include disability, the death pension, dependency and indemnity compensation, and work-study allowance.\n\nMy family income has changed and does not reflect the information I provided on my financial aid application. Can I submit an appeal?\n\nYes, we can consider those circumstances for the upcoming academic year. The aid application for 2024-25 is based on income from 2022, and we know that it may not reflect your family's current employment or financial situation, especially given the global pandemic. If there has been a reduction in income due to a job loss, job change, divorce/separation, or reduction in child support, you may consider submitting an Expected Family Contribution appeal. Beginning in May, we will start accepting Economic Hardship appeals for the 2024-25 school year.\n\nVisit our Economic Hardship Appeals website for more information about submitting an appeal.\n\nDo Veterans need to report their parent(s) information on the FAFSA?\n\nVeterans are considered independent for Title IV financial aid purposes and are not required to report parent information on the FAFSA.\n\nWho is not a veteran?\n\nAn applicant will not indicate veteran status on the FAFSA if they served in the U.S. armed forces and will continue to serve through the end of the award year covered by the FAFSA, have not engaged in active duty, including basic training in the armed forces, are a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) student or a cadet or midshipman at a service academy, are a National Guard or Reserves enlistee activated only for training purposes, or were engaged in active duty in the U.S. armed forces but released.\n\nWill I receive the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant or the Children Of Fallen Heroes Scholarship in 2024-25?\n\nSpecial Rule for Pell Grants replaces the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant and the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship. Students who are less than 33 years old as of the first January 1 of the FAFSA award year and whose parent or guardian died in the line of duty while serving in the Armed Forces on or after September 11, 2001, or serving as a public safety officer.\n\nEligible students will receive a maximum Pell Grant regardless of their SAI (adjusted for enrollment intensity as needed).\n\nHow does Cal Grant impact my VA Education Benefits?\n\nCal Grants like VA education benefits are tuition and fee-specific. Students eligible for Cal Grant will see the Cal Grant pay the systemwide resident tuition and student services fee, and the VA education benefits will pay the remaining fees.\n\nSince the VA is the last payer, tuition and fee-specific awards on students' financial aid packages will reduce their certified VA education benefits.\n\nHow does Cal Grant impact the CalVet College Fee Waiver?\n\nLike the CalVet College Fee Waiver, Cal Grant pays the systemwide resident tuition and student services fees. Since both awards pay the same tuition and fees, they cannot be used simultaneously. Students eligible for both typically use their Cal Grant during the academic year and their CalVet College Fee Waiver in the Summer.\n\nPlease get in touch with the California Department of Veterans Affairs regarding your CalVet College Fee Waiver eligibility.\n\nCan my CalVet College Fee Waiver be applied to my Summer fees?\n\nThe CalVet Waiver can be applied toward summer tuition but not applied toward campus fees. Students may be eligible for the summer fee grant based on the 2023-2024 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the number of enrolled units. The summer fee grant is a fee-paying award and only applies toward campus fees. Summer fee grant information is available on the Summer Aid webpage. CalVet waiver does not pay for summer programs for visiting students.\n\nWhat is an estimated nonresident supplemental tuition waiver (NRST waiver)?\n\nThis waiver estimates your eligibility for the nonresident supplemental tuition based on the information you provided on your application for admission and your Statement of Legal Residence. Students are requested to review the residency Exceptions and Exemption requirements and contact the Residency Unit in the Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar determines the final confirmation for this waiver.\n\nI am a nonresident student eligible for the ROTC scholarship. How do I apply for California residency?\n\nPlease get in touch with the Residency Affairs Unit to determine your eligibility for California residency.\n\nWho determines what I am eligible to receive in VA Education Benefits?\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs determines eligibility for VA education benefits, not UC Berkeley. Berkeley falls under the VA Regional Processing Office in Muskogee, OK. Please contact the VA via one of the methods listed on their website to inquire.\n\nWhat is my eligibility percentage? How many days of eligibility do I have?\n\nThe VA determines your eligibility percentage or days of eligibility. Please consider contacting them via Ask VA at https://ask.va.gov/.\n\nWhat is certification of benefits?\n\nCertification is the information the school's certifying officer sends to the VA Regional Processing Office. The student's enrollment dates, units, and tuition and fees for some programs are part of the certification process. Please get in touch with veteransbenefits@berkeley.edu with certification questions.\n\nHow many units of enrollment are required for VA education benefits?\n\nThe GI Bill® Comparison Tool can help you estimate how your credit hours affect your benefits. Your payment for tuition and fees may not be affected by the number of units you are taking, but it may impact your housing allowance. Please get in touch with veteransbenefits@berkeley.edu with questions.\n\nDo I need to report my enrollment to the VA every month?\n\nYes, the Isakson and Roe Improvement Act of 2020 requires students to verify their continued enrollment electronically throughout the term. Please get in touch with the VA for more information.\n\nWhat is the difference between Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA)?\n\nBasic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is a housing benefit the Department of Defense provides. The Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) is a housing benefit the Department of Veterans Affairs provides.\n\nAre you, your spouse (if married), or your parent(s) (if you live with your parent) receiving a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) or living on a military base? If Yes, please open a case with Cal Student Central.\n\nWhere does the school report Veterans Education Benefits or ROTC Scholarships?\n\nVeterans Education Benefits or ROTC Scholarships are reported as gift aid on Form 1098-T and are reflected in box 5."
