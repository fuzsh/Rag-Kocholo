        "text": "The name Berkeley comes from two words, the Danish and Old English word \"Birke,\" meaning birch (one impress left on England by the Danes), and the word \"ley,\" \"lay\" or \"lea,\" meaning meadow; a grassy, flat pasture land, as a lay for cattle. (See any standard encyclopï¿½dic dictionary for these words.) These two words were compounded into the word \"Berkeley,\" meaning birchmeadow. In the early days, when men had but one name, such as John or Henry, they were more specifically designated by the place at which they dwelt, such as John of the Birk-ley, finally contracted into John Berkeley, the name of the place being taken as the family name. And thus evidently came the Berkeley family name.\n\nIn Gloucestershire, England, near the banks of the Severn River, seventeen and a half miles by rail southwest of Gloucester, and one hundred and one miles west by north of London, in the \"Vale of Berkeley,\" which consists of rich meadow pasture land, lies the ancient town of Berkeley, and on an eminence to the southeast is \"Berkeley Castle,\" built in the reign of Henry I, out of the ruins of a nunnery which had been in existence some time before the Norman Conquest. This castle is to-day one of the most perfect specimens of Norman style in Great Britain. In 1162, Henry II granted this castle to Robert Fitzhardinge, with whose descendants it has ever since continued, they having held the title of Baron of Berkeley from 1259, and Earl and Viscount from 1679.\n\nIt is said that before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the Berkeley family was of some importance in Gloucestershire; that they fought with Harold at Hastings, and for years afterwards resisted William of Normandy with the other lords of Western England, and during the reign of Henry II, this castle was in the possession of Eva Berkeley, all of the men who would have been entitled to the castle having died and been killed in the numerous wars and insurrections. A descendant of Maurice Fitzhardinge, a knight, who came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066, married Eva Berkeley, and was granted Berkeley Castle by Henry II (England then being under the feudal system), and took the name of Berkeley, from which union came the present Berkeley family. Thus it would be necessary, to trace back the lineage of Maurice Fitzhardinge, to go beyond 1030 (presumably about the time he was born), for the paternal side of his union. Eva Berkeley's line no doubt ran back before 1000, under the name of Berkeley (from the ancient origin of the name). Thomas Berkeley, eighth Lord or Baron of Berkeley Castle, who was in the battle of Poitiers 1356, in 1361 bought the ancient Castle of Beverstone in Gloucestershire and gave it to a younger son, whose descendants lived there for eight generations.\n\nWhen Chiskiack on York River was opened for settlement in 1630, Nicholas Martine obtained the land at Yorktown. He was the first representative in the assembly for Chiskiack and Kent Island. He was one of the first magistrates of York County, and in 1839 obtained a patent for the land at Yorktown due him on account of importing himself, Nicholas Malier, wife Jane, Nicholas, his son, and Elizabeth Malier, his daughter; also Edward Berkeley, his wife Jane Berkeley, and their daughter, Jane, all noted among the resident inhabitants.\n\nIt is not known whether any of these were killed in the massacre of 1622; but, at the time, Maurice was in England, and afterwards came to Virginia with a view of reï¿½stablishing the iron works, which was never done. Of Maurice nothing more is known, except that he had charge of the salt works for the colony, and had a son, Lieutenant Edward or Edmund Berkeley, who, with his (Edward's) wife Jane and daughter Jane, was living at Neck of Land (between Island and the mainland), Virginia, in 1620, and who was a member of the House of Burgesses in 1625; and the report which was carried to England by John Harvey in February or March, 1625, stated that Lieutenant Edward Berkeley was living on Hog Island in James River. From this period (1625) there is no mention of the family in records now extant until twenty-six years later, 1651, when there was a grant to Henry Berkeley, Esq., of 2,400 acres on the north side of Chickahominy River, in what was then James City County, but afterwards doubtless New Kent. \"Captain Berkeley's Land,\" on Chickahominy, is afterwards mentioned in 1655.\n\nVolume II\n\nChapter XI A Narrative of My Life for My Family.\n\nThe Berkeley Family.\n\nR. A. Brock, in his notes to Spottswood's Letters, \"Virginia Historical Society,\" Vol. II, p. 59, says: \"Edmund Berkeley of Barn Elms, Middlesex County, a descendant probably of Henry Berkeley who patented 2,400 acres of land on the north side of the Chickahominy River, in James City County, April 5, 1651 (Virginia Land Registry, page 277).\" But it is most likely that he was a son of Lieutenant Edmund Berkeley (who was the son of Maurice Berkeley, who was the son of the John Berkeley, of Beverstone Castle), because, first, it will be noted that he named his eldest son Edmund and the grandson of this first Edmund Berkeley, of \"Barn Elms,\" who was named Edmund and who married Judith Randolph, and had issue by her one son, whom he named Edmund; and Judith Randolph died and he married again, this time a Mary Burwell, and his first child was a son, whom he named Edmund, and he died young; and thus ended the unbroken line of the Edmunds; second, Henry Berkeley was a son of the John Berkeley, of Beverstone Castle, and the uncle of Lieutenant Edmund Berkeley, and Henry was very old to be the father of the first Edmund Berkeley, of Barn Elms, who was probably not born before 1650, which would make him sixty-eight years of age at his death in 1718, and forty-four years of age at the time of his first marriage with Mary Mann. The probability is that he was not more than thirty-four at the time of his first marriage, which would place his birth at 1660, and there is no evidence of Henry Berkeley ever being married. The first Edmund Berkeley of \"Barn Elms\" was undoubtedly a member of the Beverstone branch of the Berkeley family, for no other Berkeley ever settled in Virginia before the time of his birth save John and his sons, aforesaid Norborne Berkeley, Baron de Bottetonit, who was Royal Governor of Virginia a short while before the Revolutionary War, and who had no descendants. Sir William Berkeley and Lord Norborne Berkeley were both of the English family of Berkeleys,but not of the Beverstone branch of the family, so far as is known. If so they did not belong to the main line of this branch, whose head was John Berkeley; aforesaid Sir William Berkeley left no male descendants. Edmund Berkeley of \"Barn Elms\" used the Berkeley coat-of-arms and the crest (a unicorn's head) which was peculiar to the Beverstone branch of the Berkeleys, the Burwells being at that time amongst the most influential and prominent people in Virginia. His appointment on the Council by the Crown in 1713, and the letters of Governor Alexander Spotswood, relative to same; the fact that he was appointed County Lieutenant of Middlesex, and the fact of his high social position, and that of his son, as shown by his son's marriage to Mary Nelson, of Yorktown, sister of General Nelson, and the high position he held-all bear testimony of his lineage. It will also be noted that he was wealthy and well to do in Virginia, and that he used the Beverstone crest and Berkeley coat-of-arms while Henry William, who was a member of the Virginia Long Parliament, 1660 to 1675, and probably John and Thomas, sons of John Berkeley, and uncles or great-uncles of the said Edmund Berkeley, still lived and while Sir William Berkeley was Governor of Virginia. This would seem to put beyond all question the fact that he was a member of the Beverstone branch of the Berkeley family, a grandson or great-grand-son of the said John Berkeley, and that the only members of the Beverstone branch of the Berkeley family now live in Virginia, i. e., that belong to the main line of the Beverstone branch of the Berkeley families.\n\nVolume II\n\nChapter XI A Narrative of My Life for My Family.\n\nThe Berkeley Family."
