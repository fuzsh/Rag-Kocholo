In 1866, with this Joint Resolution originating in the House of Representatives and approved by the Senate, Congress officially recognized that Berkeley and Jefferson belonged to West Virginia. This transfer was later contested in the 1871 U.S. Supreme Court case Virginia v. West Virginia, in which the Court affirmed that the counties were part of West Virginia.\n\nNext Document"
