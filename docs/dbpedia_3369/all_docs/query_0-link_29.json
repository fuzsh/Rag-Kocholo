He was living in a religious colony in Delaware and returned around 1736. He then led a group of people west as far as the Carolinas where many of them settled. He returned and purchased land in the Shenandoah Valley. His land was part of the Fairfax grant and so far I have counted about 900 acres, there may have been more…He became worried after Braddock's defeat in the French and Indian War and sold some of his land and fled to South Carolina. There were Quaker colonies in that area. If he were Quaker that would explain why he fled there.”\n\n“We do have on record land transactions for the Lewises in the vicinity of Opequon Creek, which flows through Frederick County, Virginia, and Berkeley and Jefferson Counties, West Virginia (then part of Frederick).David engaged James Wood to survey 516 acres ‘on Opechon’” 21 November 1735, and 316 acres ‘on the west side of Opeckon,’ 2 March 1736.On 6 June 1738, John Smith (b. 1680) sold David Lewis sixty acres of the 420 acres near Middleway (Jefferson County), for which he (Smith) received the patent on 20 August 1734.Sometime before 16 January 1744, Andrew Hampton sold his 200 acres of Opequon land to David Lewis and Jacob Brooks.On 24 October 1751, for £50, David Lewis purchased from William Hiatt 184 acres ‘where Lewis now lives’ on the east side of Opequon Creek, south of and adjacent to his son David’s 400-acre grant.On 1 September 1756, after they had moved to South Carolina, David and his wife Mary sold 150 acres of this 184 tract back to Hiatt for £60, together with the sixty acres they had purchased from Smith, for which Hiatt paid them £100.”[O’Dell, pp. 150, 153].\n\nTheir children who have been identified in the Virginia Archives - born in Orange Co, that became Frederick Co. that became Berkeley Co.

Edgar Woods, published in 1901, pp. 254, 255).\n\n\"David and Anne had eight children.He was married three times (second wife unknown). By his third wife, Mary McGrath (widow of Dr. Hart of Philadelphia), he had three children.\"\n\n\"The second family of this name sprang from David Lewis, who with his brother-in-law, Joel Terrell, in 1734, entered 3000 acres just west of the University. The next year his brother, Abraham Lewis, entered 800 acres including the land the University now occupies. These brothers belonged to Hanover County.Abraham never lived in Albemarle, but David at once settled on the hinder part of the present Birdwood Farm, so that when the county was organized, his residence was a well-known place in the country. He was an active man, a Captain in the militia, one of the early magistrates, and bore his part in clearing the roads, and executing other works of public convenience. He died in 1779 at the great age of 94. He was married 3 times, his first wife being a sister of Joel Terrell and his third, Mary McGrath, widow of Dr. Hart of Philadelphia. By the first marriage he had eight children, and by the third ,three. William Terrell, Susan (wife of Alexander Mackey who lived for a time on Ivy Creek, near the crossing of the Whitehall Road, Hannah, the wife of James Hickman, probably the son of Edwin Hickman, second sheriff of the County, Sarah, the wife of Abraham Musick, who lived in the Mechum's Depot vicinity, where his son Ephraim also lived, and thence emigrated to Kentucky.David, John, Joel, Ann, the wife first of Joel Terrell Jr. and secondly of Stephen Willis, Elizabeth, the wife of John Martin, James and Miriam, the wife of Gabriel Madison.\"\n\n***********\n\n\"The book PIONEER LEWIS FAMLIES, VOL 4, by Michael L Cook, C.G. gives a revised argument on the parents of David Lewis [ as opposed to that given by William Terrell Lewis in his LEWIS FAM. OF AMERICA---briefly:\n\n[1] page 53--Tombstone Councilor John Lewis, Warner Hall, Gloucester Co., states he was son of John and Isabella Lewis. Also here is the grave of Mrs. Isabella Yard, b. Aug 24, 1640--died Feb 9, 1703/04--she is accepted as the former Isabella Miller wife of Major John Lewis. [my note--as David baptized 1695, this would tend to remove her as his mother--William Terrell Lewis moved birth back to 1685]\n\n[2] page 74--Councilor John Lewis, born 1669 and wife Elizabeth Warner[ d. of Augustine Warner Jr. and Mildred Reade] appear to have moved to Chemokins Plantation in western New Kent Co. abt 1689, having inherited that estate from his father. Here 8 children born in St Peter Parish, New Kent.\n\n[3] page 75--Jan 5, 1695, John Lewis resident of Chemokins, St Peter Parish made Vestryman. John left Chemokins in 1702 to Warner Hall, Gloucester Co.,[ inherited by his wife]---children baptized Abington Parish 1702----[ my notes--David Lewis baptized May 5,1695, St Peter Parish-----the following\n\nfrom LEWIS OF WARNER HALL, by M. Sorley--page 56 \"Between the years 1689 and1702 there appear several entries relating to John Lewis in the Vestry Book of St Peter's Parish, in which Chemokin Plantation was located; there were of course others of the name Lewis in this general section of Virginia, but careful analysis leads to the conclusion that this John Lewis could not have been any other than the future Councilor. At a meeting of the Vestry on Jan.5, 1695 John Lewis was elected a Vestryman for St Peter's Parish.\"\n\n[4] page 77--Cook gives examples of how William Terrell Lewis was confused--Cook suggest----John Lewis, b. 1594 Monmouthshire--d. 1657 [his grave found in 1948, with this data, from VA. MAG. HIST & BIOG, Apr 48 & Aug54]---his son Col. John Lewis, abt 1618. Col John had son Major John Lewis abt 1639. Major John L. is the father of Councilor John Lewis 1669 and he is the father of David Lewis 1695. ---Cook gives other children, wives etc and argument for inserting a Col. John L.--\"\n\n\"Based on the Coat of Arms found on the tombstone of John Lewis I, a Mrs. Grace McLean Moses researched this line back into Wales--book THE WELSH LINEAGE OF JOHN LEWIS---interesting, difficult to follow Welch names etc.--\""
