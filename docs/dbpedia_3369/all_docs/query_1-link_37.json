Bill was a devoted son of William F. and Louise Bromann Lewis, and a Rockford resident since 1961. After graduating from Campion High School in Prairie Du Chien, WI in 1960, he went on to the University of Notre Dame where he received a degree in Industrial Design in 1964. While there, he was a member of the marching band and ROTC. After graduation, he served as a Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy, including a tour of duty in Viet Nam. On April 8, 1967, Bill married Anne Harvey in Chicago, and the two lived in Rockford where they raised five loving children.

He was a \"\"walking encyclopedia\"\" on any subject and was extremely generous, selfless, humble and patient. He was a wonderful husband, father and grandfather as well as a loyal friend.
