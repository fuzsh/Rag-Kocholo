        "text": "The start of a big election year is here, and between now and November West Virginians will have the opportunity to weigh in on a lot of important races.\n\nThis all starts with the primary election on May 14, 2024: Voters will be given Republican, Democratic or Mountain Party ballots, depending on how they’re registered; Libertarians nominate their candidates by convention, but people registered to other parties or as Independents can choose one of the ballots, or a nonpartisan ballot. They’ll pick candidates for a U.S. Senate seat, both of West Virginia’s U.S. representatives, and every statewide office including governor. Plus, every seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates is on the ballot, half of the state Senate seats and circuit court, family court and magistrate judges in every county. And that doesn’t even include all of the crucial county and municipal jobs, like boards of education and county sheriff.\n\nVoting in Berkeley County\n\nIn Berkeley County, like around West Virginia, early voting starts on May 1.\n\nYou can vote in-person early from May 1 through May 11. Here’s a list of all of the early voting locations and hours around the state, but to find out more specifics about Berkeley County, call the County Clerk at 304-264-1927.\n\nUnlike in recent years, voting by mail is only available for West Virginians who are unable to vote in person for reasons like illness, incarceration, work schedule and travel. Here’s more information about voting absentee.\n\nOn Primary Election Day, May 14, polls in Berkeley County will be open 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. You can find your polling place by entering your information here.\n\nCandidates\n\nBelow, you’ll find candidates that are on ballots for Berkeley County residents, though some depend on where you live. Click the triangles in the shaded boxes to learn more about the candidates.\n\nCandidates on every ballot\n\nBecause this is a primary election, the candidates you see on your ballot will vary depending on your registered political party. (If you’re a registered independent, you can request the ballot for any party.) But in every county there are nonpartisan races that will be on every ballot. Unlike the partisan races, these seats will be decided during the primary, meaning this is your only chance to weigh in on candidates.\n\nJudicial positions\n\nWest Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals\n\nFive justices are elected to West Virginia’s highest court for 12-year terms. Every year, the court convenes twice for several months to hear appeals of Intermediate Court decisions, as well as appeals from circuit court in criminal cases, juvenile proceedings, and child abuse and neglect matters. They can also be asked to help interpret state and national constitutions and laws, as they were recently asked to do in the Huntington/Cabell County case against opioid distributors.\n\nTo be eligible for the court, candidates must be at least 30 years old, have lived in West Virginia for at least five years, be a member in good standing with the West Virginia State Bar, and have been admitted to practice law for at least 10 years prior to the election. The annual salary for justices is $149,600.\n\nIn the 2024 primary, two candidates will be on the ballot, but because both are vying for seats in different divisions, they are running unopposed.\n\nSupreme Court of Appeals – Division 1\n\nSupreme Court of Appeals – Division 2\n\nWest Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals\n\nWest Virginia’s Intermediate Court of Appeals is new: it was created by the Legislature in 2021 and officially opened in 2022. These judges hear cases involving certain types of appeals, including those from circuit court civil cases, some family court decisions, state agencies and workers compensation cases.\n\nThe judges are elected to 10-year terms, and earn an annual salary of $142,500. To be eligible for the court, candidates must be at least 30 years old, have lived in West Virginia for at least five years, be a member in good standing with the West Virginia State Bar, and have been admitted to practice law for at least 10 years prior to the election.\n\nThe first three judges to serve on the court were appointed by Gov. Jim Justice in December 2021; of the three, Judge Thomas E. Scarr’s term expires at the end of this year and he is not running for reelection. Three candidates are vying to fill that vacant seat.\n\nCircuit Court Judges\n\nEffective next year, West Virginia will have 30 judicial circuits, each of which has between one and eight judges. These judges hear a variety of civil cases, as well as all felonies and misdemeanors. Click here for more information about circuit courts.\n\nThese judges are elected to eight-year terms in nonpartisan elections. To be eligible to run, candidates have to be at least 30 years old, live in the circuit they want to serve and have practiced law in West Virginia for at least five years. They earn an annual salary of $138,600.\n\nBerkeley County will be part of the new 27th Circuit, which has five judges. Every voter in the county will be able to vote for one judge per division, but all are running unopposed: Catie Wilkes Delligatti in Division 1, Laura Faircloth in Division 2, Debra McLaughlin in Division 3, R. Steven Redding in Division 4 and Michael Lorensen in Division 5.\n\nFamily Court Judges\n\nEffective next year, West Virginia will have 27 family courts, each of which has between one and five judges. These judges hear cases that involve families, including divorce, custody and visitation. They also hold final hearings in civil domestic violence cases. Click here for more information about family courts.\n\nThese judges are elected to eight-year terms in nonpartisan elections. To be eligible to run, candidates have to be at least 30 years old, live in the circuit they want to serve and have practiced law in West Virginia for at least five years. They earn an annual salary of $103,950.\n\nBerkeley County is part of the 24th Family Court Circuit, which has four divisions. Every voter will be able to vote for one judge in each division. Divisions 1 and 4 are contested, but in Division 2 Lyndsey Leatherman Matschat and in Division 3 Richard D. Stephens are running unopposed.\n\n24th Family Court Circuit, Division 1\n\n24th Family Court Circuit, Division 4\n\nMagistrate Judges\n\nEvery West Virginia county has at least two magistrates, while more populated counties have up to ten. These are the people tasked with enforcing state and municipal laws, as well as court procedures. They hear civil cases where less than $10,000 is at stake, misdemeanor criminal cases and do preliminary examinations in felony cases. They also issue domestic violence emergency protective orders and can serve in the place of a mental hygiene commissioner to involuntarily commit people to hospitals. Click here for more information about magistrate courts.\n\nMagistrates are elected to four-year terms in nonpartisan elections. The requirements for the position are only that they be at least 21 years old, live in the county where they’re elected and have a high school education. They also can’t have more than one magistrate in their immediate family, or have any past felony convictions or convictions for “moral turpitude.” A law degree is not required. They earn $63,250 a year, per West Virginia Code.\n\nBerkeley County has seven magistrates, and voters will get to choose one in each division. A number of candidates are running unopposed; they include: Darrell Shull in Division 1, William Norris in Division 3, Mary Laing in Division 4, Larry Thompson in Division 5 and Michelle Barnes-Russell in Division 6. Here are the contested races:\n\nBerkeley County Magistrate Division 2\n\nBerkeley County Magistrate Division 7\n\nCounty-level positions\n\nBoard of Education\n\nIn Berkeley County, there are two Board of Education seats up for election with four candidates running. Voters will choose two and the top two vote-getters will win, as long as ultimately there aren’t more than two board members from a single magisterial district.\n\nConservation District Supervisor\n\nWest Virginia has 14 conservation districts, and they’re run by elected supervisors. The role can vary by district but duties are supposed to revolve around conserving the soil, water and land in their districts. Candidates must be a landowner in the district and have education or experience in conservation.\n\nBerkeley County is part of the Eastern Panhandle Conservation District. There are two incumbent candidates on the ballot — Robert Cloud and Robert Boarman — but they’re vying for different seats.\n\nPartisan races\n\nDemocratic ballot\n\nNational and statewide races\n\nU.S. President\n\nTo run for U.S. president a candidate must be at least 35 years old, have lived in the country for at least 14 years and be a natural born U.S. citizen. The president serves a four-year term, and is paid a salary of $400,000 a year.\n\nDemocratic voters in West Virginia will see the following five candidates on primary ballots, but as of March 12, incumbent Joe Biden officially secured enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nWest Virginia, like every state in the country, is represented by two U.S. senators. One is Republican Shelley Moore Capito, who isn’t up for reelection until 2026. But with the retirement of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, voters will choose a new senator for that six-year term this year.\n\nTo be eligible to run for the U.S. Senate, a candidate has to be at least 30 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least nine years and live in the state they seek to represent at the time of election. The annual salary for senators who don’t serve in the body’s leadership is $174,000 a year.\n\nThere are three Democrats competing for the party’s slot on the November ballot. They include Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott and Zachary Shrewsbury. Former Massey Coal CEO Don Blankenship who spent a year in prison after being convicted of a mine safety crime is also running; he has unsuccessfully sought other statewide offices as a Republican.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nA state’s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives is based on its population; after the U.S. Census in 2020, West Virginia lost a seat and currently has two representatives.\n\nTo be eligible, candidates have to be at least 25 years old, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years and a resident of the state (though not necessarily the district) they seek to represent. The salary for non-leadership members of the U.S. House is $174,000 a year. House members are up for election every two years, so both of West Virginia’s House seats are on the ballot.\n\nBerkeley County is in West Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives–District 2\n\nThere is currently no incumbent running for this seat, because current 2nd District Congressman Alex Mooney is running to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate. Because there is only one Democratic candidate for the seat, Steven Wendelin is the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nWest Virginia Governor\n\nWest Virginia’s governor is the head of the state’s executive branch and as such, is responsible for carrying out the state’s laws and running many of the essential functions of state government. To be eligible, a candidate has to be at least 30 years old, a U.S. citizen, and have lived in West Virginia for at least five years. They also can’t have ever fought a duel with deadly weapons, per West Virginia Code. Starting in 2025, the salary for the position will be about $186,000 a year.\n\nThere is only one Democratic candidate for governor, so Huntington Mayor Steve Williams is the presumptive nominee.\n\nWest Virginia Secretary of State\n\nWest Virginia’s secretary of state has a big job: they are the state’s chief election officer, responsible for registering all businesses and charities, and oversee all administrative laws, among other duties. But to be eligible, a candidate only has to be at least 18 years old and a West Virginia citizen. The position pays $135,344 a year.\n\nThere is only one Democrat running for secretary of state, so Thornton Cooper will be the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nWest Virginia Auditor\n\nThe state auditor is West Virginia’s official bookkeeper, and is responsible for conducting audits of county governments, municipalities, boards and commissions. To be eligible, candidates have to be at least 18 years old and a citizen of West Virginia. The position pays about $135,000 a year.\n\nThere is only one Democrat seeking the nomination. As such, Mary Ann Claytor is the presumptive nominee, and will be on the ballot in November.\n\nWest Virginia State Treasurer\n\nThe state treasurer is West Virginia’s chief financial officer. To be eligible, candidates have to be at least 18 years old and a citizen of West Virginia. The position pays $135,344 a year.\n\nThere is no Democrat running for this position, so Democratic voters won’t see it on their ballots. Republican Larry Pack is the state’s presumptive next treasurer.\n\nWest Virginia Commissioner of Agriculture\n\nWest Virginia’s agriculture commissioner is responsible for promoting, regulating and coordinating the state’s agricultural products. To be eligible, candidates have to be at least 18 years old and a citizen of West Virginia. The position pays $135,344 a year.\n\nOnly one Democrat is running: Deborah Stiles will be the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General\n\nWest Virginia’s attorney general is the state’s top lawyer. To be eligible, candidates have to be at least 18 years old and a citizen of West Virginia. The position pays $135,344 a year.\n\nTwo Democrats are running in the race: South Charleston lawyer Richie Robb and Wheeling attorney Teresa Toriseva.\n\nWest Virginia Legislature\n\nWho you see on your ballot for West Virginia House and Senate depends on where you live.\n\nEnter your address in this tool to see your district.\n\nHouse of Delegates\n\nBerkeley County is part of eight West Virginia House districts. The people elected to represent these districts will serve in the West Virginia House of Delegates, where regular citizens serve part-time in Charleston. There are 100 delegates in the West Virginia Legislature; the districts are divided based on population.\n\nDelegates are elected to two-year terms. Candidates have to be at least 18 years old, and have lived in their district for a year. They earn $20,000 for their work.\n\nAlthough Berkeley County is part of eight House districts, in five of them, there is no Democratic candidate. There are Democrats running for the following seats, all unopposed in the primary:\n\n95th Delegate District\n\n96th Delegate District\n\n97th Delegate District\n\nWest Virginia State Senate\n\nBerkeley County is part of Senate District 15 and 16. Like delegates, state senators are regular citizens who serve part-time in the Legislature. However, there are fewer of them: 34 senators in total.\n\nTo run for the West Virginia Senate, candidates have to be at least 25 years old and have lived in the state for five years. To run for the West Virginia Senate, candidates have to be at least 25 years old and have lived in the state for five years.

These officials are elected to six-year terms; their responsibilities include overseeing county tax dollars, supervising the county election process, maintaining the county courthouse and funding county services like libraries, ambulances, fire services and trash pick up. Candidates have to be at least 18 years old, and live in the magisterial district they’re vying to represent.\n\nThere is one open position in Berkeley County, and because only one Democrat is running, Dirk Stansbury will presumably face the Republican nominee in November.\n\nProsecuting Attorney\n\nEvery West Virginia county has an elected prosecutor; this person is the county’s chief legal officer and handles the prosecution of all misdemeanor and felony crimes in the county. Candidates are elected to four year terms, and the only requirements are they be at least 18 years old, a resident of West Virginia and admitted to practice law by the time they file for office.\n\nThere are no Democrats running for this seat, so Democratic voters won’t see any candidates on the ballot.\n\nSheriff\n\nSheriffs are counties’ chief law enforcement officers, and are charged with keeping the peace. If the county has a jail, they run the jail, and duties also include enforcing court orders and acting as a bailiff during court proceedings. In addition, they collect all county taxes.\n\nThey are elected to four-year terms, and have to be at least 18 years old and a county resident.\n\nThere is only one Democrat running for this position, so David Jackson is the party’s presumptive nominee. He’ll face the Republican nominee on the November ballot.\n\nAssessor\n\nThe county assessor is responsible for appraising all real estate and personal property, for tax purposes. They are elected to four-year terms, and have to be at least 18 years old and a county resident.\n\nThere are no Democrats running for this seat, so Democratic voters won’t see any candidates on the ballot.\n\nRepublican ballot\n\nNational and statewide races\n\nU.S. President\n\nTo run for U.S. president a candidate must be at least 35 years old, have lived in the country for at least 14 years and be a natural born U.S. citizen. The president serves a four-year term, and is paid a salary of $400,000 a year.\n\nRepublican voters in West Virginia will see the following five candidates on primary ballots, but as of March 12, Donald Trump has secured enough delegates to win the Republican nomination.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nWest Virginia, like every state in the country, is represented by two U.S. senators. One is Republican Shelley Moore Capito, who isn’t up for reelection until 2026. But with the retirement of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, voters will choose a new senator for that six-year term this year.\n\nTo be eligible to run for the U.S. Senate, a candidate has to be at least 30 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least nine years and live in the state they seek to represent at the time of election. The annual salary for senators who don’t serve in the body’s leadership is $174,000 a year.\n\nThere are seven Republicans competing for the party’s slot on the November ballot. They include current West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, and current U.S. Representative Alexander Mooney, as well as five other candidates who have never before held elected office.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nA state’s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives is based on its population; after the U.S. Census in 2020, West Virginia lost a seat and currently has two representatives.\n\nTo be eligible, candidates have to be at least 25 years old, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years and a resident of the state (though not necessarily the district) they seek to represent. The salary for non-leadership members of the U.S. House is $174,000 a year. House members are up for election every two years, so both of West Virginia’s House seats are on the ballot.\n\nBerkeley County is in West Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives–District 2\n\nThere is currently no incumbent running for this seat, because current 2nd District Congressman Alex Mooney is running to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate. Five Republicans are competing for the party’s nomination on the November general election ballot. They include three candidates with military experience (Nate Cain, Joseph Earley and Chris Walker), one who works in third-party logistics (Alexander Gaaserud) and current West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore.\n\nWest Virginia Governor\n\nWest Virginia’s governor is the head of the state’s executive branch and as such, is responsible for carrying out the state’s laws and running many of the essential functions of state government. To be eligible, a candidate has to be at least 30 years old, a U.S. citizen, and have lived in West Virginia for at least five years. They also can’t have ever fought a duel with deadly weapons, per West Virginia Code. Starting in 2025, the salary for the position will be $186,854 a year.\n\nThe crowded Republican field on the May primary ballot includes several familiar names in West Virginia politics. There are two current state constitutional officers: Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Secretary of State Mac Warner. There are two children of current members of Congress: former state delegate Moore Capito (son of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito) and businessman Chris Miller (son of Rep. Carol Miller).
