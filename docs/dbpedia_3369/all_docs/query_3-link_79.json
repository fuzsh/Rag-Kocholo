        "text": "Taken from: “Some prominent Virginia families: Volume 2 – Page 620″ by Louise Pecquet du Bellet, Edward Jaquelin, Martha Cary Jaquelin\n\nMotto translated means”Every land is a brave man’s country.”\n\nIt is a question very often discussed of late as to whether the hour makes the man or the man the hour. To a student of the history of Virginia an answer is very soon given, for since the settlement of Jamestown, in 1607, which was virtually the birth of this country, there has never arisen a crisis of any kind when Virginia, our mother State, has not had one or more of her sons ready to meet it. When the hour arrives the man appears. We may search the pages of history in vain for a nobler or as noble a group of men as Washington and his patriot Virginians in 1776.\n\nThe Lewis family of Virginia is one of the most distinguished families in the State. It is connected by marriage with many of the best-known names, such as Washington. Marshall, Fielding, Merriweather, Daingerfield, Taliaferro and others. The men of the family from the time when they first settled in the colony, about the middle of the seventeenth century, have been men of action and distinction; they have won for themselves the most remarkable record as soldiers. It is recorded on the tombstone of “Pioneer John” that he furnished five sons for the Revolution. There were five colonels in the Revolution—Colonel Nicholas, Colonel Fielding, Colonel William, Colonel Charles and Colonel Joel—and quite a number of majors and captains. The Lewises also won a gallant record in the War of 1812, the Mexican War and in the Confederate States Army.\n\nThe Lewis family were originally French Huguenots, and left France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 1685. Three brothers—namely, William, Samuel and John—fled to England. (See “History of the Huguenots.”) Shortly afterwards William removed to the north of Ireland, where he married a Miss McClelland; Samuel fixed his residence in Wales, while John continued in England. Descendants of each of these three brothers are supposed to have settled in Virginia.\n\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century four brothers of the Lewis family left Wales.\n\nI. Samuel Lewis, went to Portugal; nothing is known of him.\n\nII. William Lewis, d. in Ireland.\n\nIII. General Robert Lewis, d. in Gloucester Co., Va.\n\nIV. John Lewis, d. in Hanover Co., Va.\n\n1. I. William Lewis1, one of the Welsh brothers; d. in Ireland. Married Miss McClelland and left one son:\n\n2. I. Andrew Lewis3. Married Miss Calhoun.\n\nThey had Issue:\n\n3. I. John Lewis2, b. 1678, in Ireland. Married Margaret Lynn.\n\n4. II. Samuel Lewis2, b. 1680. ‘No issue.\n\nIII. John Lewis3 (Andrew2, William1). In 1720 John Lewis left Ireland a fugitive, having stabbed Sir Inango Campbell, his Irish landlord, who attempted in a lawless and brutal manner to evict him from his premises, of which he held a freehold lien, and had slain an invalid brother, before his eves. He first took refuge in Portugal, and later fled to America and settled in Pennsylvania; then in Augusta Co., Va. In Campbell’s “History of Virginia” he is styled as Pioneer John Lewis. He is described as being tall and of great muscular strength, and was one of the best backwoodsmen of his day. He built his house with portholes in it, so that he could successfully contend with the savage tribes that infested the country. When Augusta County was organized he was the founder of Staunton, the county seat, and was one of the first magistrates appointed by the Governor. John Lewis died in 1762. On his tombstone it is recorded that he gave five sons to fight the battles of the American Revolution.\n\nJohn Lewis and Margaret Lynn, his wife, had issue:\n\n.”>. I. Samuel Lewis4, served with distinction as a captain in the war between the English and French colonists. His brothers, Andrew. William and Charles, were members of his company, and all four were at Braddock’s defeat, and three of them were wounded. Samuel was afterwards conspicuous in the defense of Greenbrier County and the border settlements from the Indians. He was born 1716: d. unmarried.\n\n6. II. Thomas Lewis4, b. in Ireland, 1718.\n\n7. III. Andrew Lewis4, b. in Ireland, 1750.\n\n8. IV. William Lewis4, b. in Ireland, 1724.\n\n9. V. Margaret Lewis4, b. in Ireland, 1726.\n\n10. VI. Anne Lewis4, b. in Ireland, 1728.\n\n11. VII. Charles Lewis4, b. in Virginia, 1736.\n\nAlice Lewis4. Married Mr. Madison.\n\nIV. Col. Andrew Lewis4 (John”, Andrew2, William1), son of John Lewis (Pioneer) and Margaret Lynn, daughter of the Laird of Loch Lynn, chieftain of the once powerful Clan of Loch Lynn: b. in Ireland, 1720. He emigrated with his father to America, and settled in Augusta Co., Va. He took a very active part in the Indian Wars. In 1754 he was twice wounded in the battle of Fort Necessity, under General Washington, by whom he was appointed major of hie regiment. General Lewis was, with four of his brothers, in a company of which the eldest was captain, at Braddock’s defeat, in 1758. “General Andrew Lewis was several times a member of the Colonial Legislature.\n\nAn Indian war being anticipated, Lord Dunmore appointed General Lewis commander of the Southern forces. September 11, 1774, General Lewis, with eleven hundred men, commenced his march through the wilderness. After a march of one hundred and sixty miles they reached Point Pleasant, at the junction of the Great Kanawha and Ohio rivers, and there on October 10, 1774, he signally defeated the Shawnee Indians. He is known as the hero of Point Pleasant. His strikingly majestic form and figure never failed to remind me of the memorable remark made by the Governor of the colony of New York, when General Lewis was a commissioner on behalf of Virginia at the treaty of Fort Stanwix, in New York, in 1768, that “the earth seemed to tremble under him as he walked along.” His statue is one of those around that of the father of his country, in Capitol Square, Richmond, Va.; it is marked with the name of Andrew Lewis, the “Hero of Point Pleasant.”\n\nGeneral Washington, under whom Lewis had served in various capacities, had formed such a high estimate of Lewis’s character and ability, it is said, that when the chief command of the Revolutionary army was proposed to Washington, he expressed a wish that it had been given to General Lewis. General Lewis died in 1781.\n\nGeneral Andrew Lewis married (1749) Elizabeth Givens, of Augusta Co., Va., and left issue:\n\n12. I.

This John Lewis, Sr., was the great-great-grandfather of William Terrill Lewis, of Louisville, Winston Co., Miss., author of the Lewis genealogy, from which the dates of this article have been largely drawn. In his will John Lewis mentions the names of his children:\n\n2. I. Rebecca Lewis3.\n\n3. II. Abraham Lewis3.\n\n4. III. Sarah Lewis3.\n\n5. IV. Angelica Lewis’2.\n\n6. V. David Lewis3.\n\n7. VI. John Lewis2.\n\nII. David Lewis2 (John1), Sr., fifth son of John I/iwis, Sr., was born in Hanover Co., Va., about 1685. Married, first, Miss Terrill, by whom he had eight children.\n\nWilliam, James and John Terrill were brothers of AngloNorman descent. They came to America about 1660, as huntsmen for King James II, of England, and settled in Gloucester Co., Va. For their dexterity in hunting they wire awarded by the King fifteen hundred acres of land, to be selected by themselves. The Terrills are of Anglo-Norman origin and descend from Sir Walter Tyrell, a Norman knight who came into England with William the Conqueror, A. D. 1066. David Lewis, Sr., fifth child of the emigrant, moved from Hanover Co., Va., and settled in Albemarle. Co., Va., about 1750, where he died in 1779. He married twice and left eleven children. William Terrill Lewis3, the eldest child of David Lewis, Sr., b. 1718, Hanover Co., Va., moved to Albemarle Co., Va., and was the third settler in that county. William Lewis, Sr., was one of the first men who volunteered their services in Albemarle Co., Va., to resist the high-handed measures of Lord Dunmore in 1774.\n\nIV. Col.

Meriwether Lewis”.\n\nII. Reuben Lewis”.\n\nIII. Jane Lewis”.\n\nVI. Meriwether Lewis” (William5, Robert4, John2, John2, Robert1), generally called the “Oregon Explorer,” son of Captain William I.ewis, b. August 18, 1774. His father died when he was very young and he grew up under the care of his uncle, Col. Nicholas Lewis. Thomas Jefferson gives a very interesting sketch of Meriwether Lewis, who was for two years his private secretary. He says: “He was remarkable, even in infancy, for enterprise, boldness and discretion. When only eight years old he habitually went out in the dead of the night alone with his dogs into the forest to hunt the raccoon and opossum. At the age of thirteen he was put to the Latin school and continued until eighteen.”\n\nAt the age of twenty he engaged as a volunteer in the body of militia called out by General Washington for service in the western part of the United States. At twenty-three he was promoted to a captaincy. In 1792 Thomas Jefferson proposed to the American Philosophical Society that they should set on foot a subscription to engage some competent person to explore the region by ascending the Missouri, crossing the Stony Mountains and descending the nearest river to the Pacific. Captain Lewis, being then stationed at Charlottesville, warmly solicited Jefferson to obtain for him the execution of the expedition, although it was explained to him that the person engaged to go should be accompanied by a single companion only, to avoid exciting alarm among the Indians. This did not deter him, but the proposal did not succeed. In 1803 Congress approved the plan and voted a man of money to carry it into execution. Captain Lewis, who had been private secretary for Jefferson for two years, renewed his solicitations to have the direction of the party. His request was granted, and as it was necessary that he should have some competent person with him, in case of accident to himself, William Clarke, brother of General Rogers Clarke, was selected and approved, receiving a commission as captain. In April. 1803, a draft of his instructions was sent to Captain Lewis, and on the 5th of July, 1803. they left Washington and proceeded to Pittsburg. The two explorers. Lewis and Clarke, returned to St. Louis on the 23d of September. 180(>. having been gone a little over three years. The old accounts of the expedition tell us, “Never did a similar event excite more joy throughout the United States.” Captain Lewis was soon after appointed Governor of Louisiana and Captain Clarke a general of its militia, and agent of the United States for Indian affairs in the department. Captain Meriwether Lewis died October 11. 1809, aged 35.\n\nThe Virginia ‘Heraldry gives (February 11, 1906): “There seems to have been some doubt for a time as to which of Col. Robert Lewis’ sons married Catherine Fauntleroy. Some genealogists stated that it was Robert, but it has been proved that he married his cousin, Frances Lewis.”\n\nI believe that there is now a record of the marriage of John Lewis- and Catherine Fauntleroy in Washington. However that may be, there seems to be no doubt that John is the Lewis who married Catherine.\n\nV. John Lewis5 (Robert4, John2, John2, Robert1), son of Col.

THOMAS LEWIS.\n\nThomas Lewis2, the second son of the founder, was born in Donegal, Ireland, April 27, 1718; died January 31, 1790. He was a man of strong and cultivated mind, of spirit and enterprise, and during the colonial period and the Revolutionary War rendered important services to the country. In 1746 he was appointed colonial surveyor of Augusta, and much of Washington’s great wealth was acquired by surveys of land under his authority and in common with him. He and Col. John Wilson represented the county in the House of Burgesses almost uninterruptedly from 1745 to 1767, and they voted in 1765 for Patrick Henry’s celebrated resolutions declaring that “this general assembly have the only exclusive right and power to lay taxes and impositions u;:on the inhabitants of this colony; that any efforts in an opposite direction are illegal, unconstitutional and unjust, and have a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as American freedom.”\n\nIn 1775 he was unanimously elected delegate to the Colonial Congress, and was one of the first to enroll his name among the “Sons of Liberty.” He was commissioner of the old confederacy of the thirteen colonies in 1778, to treat with the Indian tribes at the battle of Point Pleasant. He was a member of the convention which ratified the constitution of the United States.\n\nAfter the Revolution, Gen. Washington made him a visit at Lewiston, in Rockingham, and there arranged their land claims. His descendants still own and reside upon his estate, Lewiston, near Port Republic, in the present county of Rockingham. He had a literary taste, and when not engaged in business was generally to be found in his library. He died at his residence in Rockingham County, on the Shenandoah River, three miles from Port Republic, January 31, 1790. In his will he fixed the place on his own estate where he wished to be buried, and desired that the burial service might be read from the Book of Common Prayer by his friend Peachy Gilmer. Married (January 26, 1749) Jane. the daughter of William Strother, Esq., of Stafford Co., Va., whose estate, opposite to Fredericksburg, joined the residence of the father of Gen. Washington, with whom (Gen. W.) she was a schoolmate and nearly of the same age.\n\nHon. Thomas Lewis2 and Jane Strother, his wife, had issue:\n\n14. XII. Sophia Lewis3, b. 1775.

Alexander Brown, fourth child of Judge Brown, was a most promising young man, who, after graduating with distinction at the University of Virginia, commenced the law practice in Wythe, hut died soon after.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun of August 13, 1905, has the following article on:\n\nTHE OLD HOME OF NELLY CUSTIS.\n\nOf the many old Colonial Homes in Virginia which are still in a splendid state of preservation, perhaps none can claim greater historical interest or more pleasing associations than does old Woodlawn Mansion, the\n\n‘Being in Wytheville that winter I (L. Pecquet du Bellet) was at the wedding. I was at the reception and handed all the telegrams of congratulations to the bride and groom. A lovelier bride I have never seen. The parlors were crowded with guests from various States of the Union. The presents were very handsome, costing several thousand dollars.\n\nThe mother of the bride is a very dear friend of mine. I receive some very interesting letters from her. (Peyton Family, Hayden’s Virginia Genealogies, pp. 461-566.)\n\noriginal home of Mrs. Eleanor Custis Lewis, nee Nelly Custis, the adopted daughter of General George Washington. Since Woodlawn was built one hundred years have rolled into the great abyss of the past, yet it stands to day a complete and solid result of fine old-time architecture, in no respect reduced from its ancient splendor or magnificence.\n\nWoodlawn is located in lower Fairfax County, lying directly on the road known as the Alexandria pike, and an hour’s drive from that old city of Alexandria, where centers so much of history, sentiment and anecdote concerning America’s greatest general, the illustrious Washington. The commanding site upon which this mansion is built was formerly a part of the Mount Vernon estate, but, with the acres surrounding it. was given by General Washington to his adopted daughter, Nelly Custis, upon her marriage to his favorite nephew, Lawrence. Lewis, afterwards Major Lewis of Woodlawn. Its architecture is of Colonial date, being one of the finest specimens of that period and better known as the Georgian architecture. Within the long drawing-room of that historic mansion, on the last anniversary of the birthday of her devoted foster-father. Nelly was made the bride of Lawrence Lewis, Washington himself giving the blushing young beauty away to the beloved nephew, afterwards Major Lewis, of Woodlawn. This event took place on the 22nd of February. 1799. Mrs. Eleanor Custis Lewis sleeps to-day beneath the marble shaft that marks her grave at Mount Vernon, only a few feet away from the tomb containing the honored dust of her beloved hero and foster-father. Upon this monument the noble traits of this gentlewoman are thus written:\n\n“Sacred to the memory of Eleanor Parke Custis. granddaughter of Mrs. Washington and adopted daughter of General Washington. Reared under the roof of the Father of His Country, this lady was not more remarkable for her beauty of person than for the superiority of her mind. She lived to be admired and died to be regretted, July 15. 1852, in the seventyfourth year of her age.”\n\nWoodlawn has changed owners many times, and is the property to-day of Mr. Paul Kester, the popular young playwright.\n\nSince writing the above I am the happy recipient of the following extract from Mrs. Penrose N. Ions, of San Angelo, Texas, taken from the “History of Huguenots,” by Samuel Smiles:\n\nJean Louis was forced to flee from France, during the persecutions of the Huguenots, which followed the revocation of the “Edict of Nantes.” He came of a Protestant family of wealth, position and influence, of the town of Castred. He made good his escape to England, and as the English were in need of experienced officers in Flanders, he was gladly weleomed and given a commission as Captain in Queen Anne’s Army in the “Low Countries.” For his gallantry and valuable services he was made Field Marshal, Earl of Ligenter and Baron of Greniskilin.\n\nHe was with Marlborough in Flanders, and attracted his attention at the storming of Liege. At Blenheim he was the only captain of hisregiment who survived. At Kenice (or Menice) he led the grenadiers in storming the counters. He fought at Malplaquet. where he was made Major of Brigade. He was in all of Marlborough’s battles, and at Dettingen as Lieutenant-General, he won still higher distinction. The intrepidity with which he led the British Infantry won the battle of Fontenoy. Placed in command of the British forces in Flanders, he was taken prisoner at the engagement of Sanfield. Restored to England he was made Commander-in-Chief, and Colonel of the Fort Guards. During his career, he was in nineteen battles and twenty-three sieges.\n\nGENERAL JOHN LEWIS.\n\nThe first General John Lewis had a son- named :he was the eldest and died early. He had rented in fee simple, for a hundred years, the estate of Lord Dunraven, in Ireland. John Lewis, the eldest son of the dead man, succeeded to the titles and estates and settled in Ireland. That John Lewis went to Scotland and married Margaret, the daughter of Lord Lynn, who lived on Loch (Lake) Lynn.\n\nJohn Lewis, then an earl, and his wife lived happily for a few years. Then the profligate Earl of Dunraven wanted to give (rent) the estate to a boon companion. He came with an armed hand to drive John Lewis away. He fired into the house and killed a brother of Lewis, who was ill in bed. John Lewis, who had been absent, returned, and, seeing the armed Earl, he shot him dead. English soldiers were sent to arrest John Lewis for killing the Earl of Dunraven, but the Irish of the whole country arose and helped him to escape to the west coast. All the landlords near John Lew-is armed their followers and escorted him to the coast, and he escaped to France. Feeling unsafe in France, he made his way alone and on foot over to the mountains in Spain. Relatives knelt to King George and begged a pardon for John Lewis. As he was safe in Spain and the King could not get him, he thought to make good use of him and try to get the Indians to kill him, so he (the King) said John Lewis should lose titles and property, but if he would go to Virginia, and go far beyond all of his good subjects, he (the King) would forgive and rent him a tract of land, 100,000 acres, provided he built a fort and became a shield to all of his good and loyal subjects. So, as he could not help himself, John Lewis came to Virginia. His brother brought over the family of John Lewis and a shipload of tenants—MeHughs (now called MeCuea) and McLungs and many other Valley families, all Presbyterians. As soon as they got to Virginia they were on a level with John Lewis.\n\nJohn Lewis had the following children: Samuel, Thomas, Andrew, William, Margaret Anne, Charles and Alice. Alice married Mr. Madison and was the mother of Bishop Madison. Mr. Madison was the first and only member of the family to belong to the Protestant Episcopal Church.\n\nThomas Lewis married Jane Strother. His sketch has been given above.\n\nII. Col. Charles Lewie2 (John1), the youngest son of the founder, John Lewis, and Margaret Lynn, his wife; was killed October 10, 1774, at the battle of Point Pleasant. Married Sarah Murray, an English lady, half-sister of Col. Cameron, of Bath Co., Va. She was a near relative of Linlev Murray, who wrote the grammar.\n\nCol. Charles Lewis left following issue:\n\n3.

Margaret Strother Lewis4. Married Rev. C. B. Tippett, of Maryland.\n\nIV. Gen. Samuel Hance Lewis4 (Charles2, Thomas2, John1), son of Charles Lewis3 and Anne Hance, a prominent citizen of Virginia, was a graduate of Washington College (now Washington and Lee), a man of great literary tastes, profoundly religious, of high moral worth, and beloved friend of Bishops Meade and Cobb. While exceedingly genial among his intimate friends, he was a man remarkable for his strict religious observances, for his stern deportment in the presence of frivolity, and for his iron will and high integrity, both in private as well as in public life. He represented his county in the Legislature for many years, and his name is dear to the church in Virginia, in whose councils he was so long a ruling spirit. He died at his home, Lewiston, Rockingham Co., of cancer of the neck, in 1868.\n\nHe married, first, Nancy Lewis, the granddaughter of Col. Charles Lewis, killed at the battle of Point Pleasant; second. Anna Maria Lomax, daughter of Judge J. T. Lomax, of Fredericksburg, Va.; third, Mrs. Fry.

Samuel Hance Lewis and Nancy Lewis, his first wife. He inherited all of his father’s sterling qualities, and was one of the leading men of his day in Virginia. Of magnificent physical proportions—six feet three inches tall—his mental attributes were quite as remarkable. He was especially noted for his reckless bravery, his impulsive denunciation of wrong, and his utter disregard for public opinion when he considered it to be in error. His first appearance in public life was when he was sent as delegate to the convention at the outbreak of the Civil War, which was to decide whether Virginia would secede from the Union or not. He was a strong Union man and went there instructed to vote against secession, which he did to the bitter end, saying they might hang him, as they threatened to do. but he would never sign the ordinance. He was the only man in this convention who did not sign it. There were several of the West Virginia members, who did not sign, but they left at once for their homes within the Northern line. A hundred times the ordinance was thrust into his face, but he invariably replied, “I will die first.” That he was not killed seems almost a miracle. Many of the best and staunchest Union men gave way to the pressure and signed the ordinance. Samuel McDowel More was burned in effigy, Jubal A. Early was threatened with mob law, yet they both yielded to the overwhelming excitement. John F. Lewis alone remained at his post, true to the last to his firm conviction that to do so would bring trouble and ruin to his State. His integrity and honesty of purpose were so well known and so well appreciated that they seemed to be a shield to his open and often reckless Union utterances, and while others were imprisoned, or shot down on the roadside, he was spared to save his State from the internal strife which so long retarded the happiness and prosperity of many of the more southern states. In 1869 he was elected Lieutenant Governor, and in November of that year was elected to the United States Senate. To quote from Rev. 0. S. Bunting, late of Petersburg, Va., and a dear friend: “From heel to crown he was every inch a man—brave, true, sincere, courteous in the truest sense, generous, positive.
