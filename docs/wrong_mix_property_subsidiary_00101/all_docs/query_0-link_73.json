        "text": "Innovation has been at the core of the PAMP brand since the introduction of its very first bullion bar. In 2015, we launched VERISCANâ¢, a revolutionary and proprietary system aimed at facilitating the authentication of PAMP bullion products. Scans via VERISCANâ¢ are free, enabling every user to authenticate their PAMP products safely and reliably.\n\nVERISCANâ¢ enables the instant, secure and confidential authentication of any PAMP precious metals product bearing the VERISCANâ¢ logo on its CertiPAMPâ¢ assay card packaging or product certificate.\n\nVERISCANâ¢ operates on the fact that, just as in nature, even man-made products possess microscopic âsurface profilesâ as individual and distinctive as a fingerprint. Its advanced scanning technology identifies and compares the surface profile of PAMP products with the digital record captured at the production stage to verify its authenticity.\n\n1. Download the free VERISCANâ¢ app from the App Store (Compatibility: iPhone 7 and newer models running iOS 12 and above)\n\n2. Open the VERISCANâ¢ app, sign in and view the auto-play tutorial video.\n\n3. Select the âAutomatic Scanâ option and follow the on-screen instructions:\n\n4. Scan the QR code located on your productâs CertiPAMPâ¢ assay card packaging or certificate. The QR code must be scanned within the VERISCANâ¢ app and not beforehand via your iPhoneâs QR code reader or camera.\n\n5. Determine if the product is packaged (CertiPAMPâ¢ assay card) or unpackaged (None) and select the productâs side to authenticate (Front / Back).\n\n6. Position the phone camera over the product, aligning with the screen overlay as guided. Ensure a flat camera angle by keeping the digital leveling guide centered.\n\n7. View the result (Pass or No Result Available).\n\nVERISCANâ¢ can authenticate any registered PAMP product within or without its sealed CertiPAMPâ¢ assay card packaging. Larger products can be verified on all six sides for enhanced authentication. Intuitive and entirely secure, the VERISCANâ¢ authentication process leaves the product completely intact.\n\nFor additional questions regarding VERISCANâ¢, please visit our dedicated FAQ section below.
