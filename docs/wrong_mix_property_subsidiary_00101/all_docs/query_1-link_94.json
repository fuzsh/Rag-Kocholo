        "text": "For government reporting purposes, we ask candidates to respond to the below self-identification survey. Completion of the form is entirely voluntary. Whatever your decision, it will not be considered in the hiring process or thereafter. Any information that you do provide will be recorded and maintained in a confidential file.\n\nAs set forth in Verisign’s Equal Employment Opportunity policy, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected group status under any applicable law.\n\nGender:\n\nIf you believe you belong to any of the categories of protected veterans listed below, please indicate by making the appropriate selection. As a government contractor subject to the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), we request this information in order to measure the effectiveness of the outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake pursuant to VEVRAA. Classification of protected categories is as follows:\n\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\n\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\n\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\n\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\n\nVeteran Status:\n\nForm CC-305\n\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\n\nExpires 04/30/2026\n\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\n\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\n\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.\n\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\n\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.\n\nDisabilities include, but are not limited to:\n\nAlcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently using drugs illegally)\n\nAutoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS\n\nBlind or low vision\n\nCancer (past or present)\n\nCardiovascular or heart disease\n\nCeliac disease\n\nCerebral palsy\n\nDeaf or serious difficulty hearing\n\nDiabetes\n\nDisfigurement, for example, disfigurement caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders\n\nEpilepsy or other seizure disorder\n\nGastrointestinal disorders, for example, Crohn's Disease, irritable bowel syndrome\n\nIntellectual or developmental disability\n\nMental health conditions, for example, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD\n\nMissing limbs or partially missing limbs\n\nMobility impairment, benefiting from the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports\n\nNervous system condition, for example, migraine headaches, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)\n\nNeurodivergence, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, other learning disabilities\n\nPartial or complete paralysis (any cause)\n\nPulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema\n\nShort stature (dwarfism)\n\nTraumatic brain injury\n\nPUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. This survey should take about 5 minutes to complete.\n\n1Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
