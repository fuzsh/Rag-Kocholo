        "text": "Q. How do I log into the Iowa HHS Learning Management System?\n\nA. If you are new to the Iowa HHS Learning Management System, log in by clicking on this link (or copy and paste the following site into your browser: https://lsglm700.learnsoft.com/LSGLM/Login/iowalogindhs.aspx) and register as an external user. Please write down and store your username and password in a safe but accessible place to log in and access your training records in the future.\n\nQ: If certification was acquired prior to July 1, 2019, will I need to take the new curriculum training to maintain my certification? Am I required to take the core mandatory reporter training as provided by HHS to maintain my certificate?\n\nA: All valid Mandatory Reporter Training certificates issued prior to July 1, 2019, remain valid for five years. After July 1, 2019, the core mandatory reporter training provided by HHS is the only training available for mandatory reporters in Iowa to maintain their certification.\n\nQ: Is the 1-hour recertification training still available?\n\nA: No. Every mandatory reporter in Iowa is required to complete the core child and/or dependent adult abuse mandatory reporter training, as provided by HHS, within 6 months of initial employment or self-employment and every three years thereafter.\n\nQ. Is it the employee or employers’ responsibility to assure mandatory reporter training requirements are fulfilled?\n\nA. It is the responsibility of the employee AND employer to assure compliance with the law. Every mandatory reporter in Iowa is required to complete the core child and/or dependent adult abuse mandatory reporter training, as provided by HHS, within 6 months of initial employment or self-employment and every three years thereafter.\n\nIt is up to the employee to maintain record of their certification and provide it to their employer in order to be considered up to date on the statutory requirements of mandatory reporting. It is up the employer to assure they have record of the employees' certifications to document that their employees are up to date on the statutory requirements of mandatory reporting.\n\nQ. How do I access my mandatory reporter training certificate?\n\nA. If you took the training before July 1, 2019, HHS will not have a copy of your certificate. You will need to request a copy from the employer or agency who provided the training.\n\nIf you took the HHS training between July 1, 2019 and June 19, 2020, an actual certificate is not available. Rather, a transcript certifying your completion of the mandatory reporter training is available on the Iowa HHS Learning Management System. To access the system, click on this link or copy and paste the following site into your browser: https://lsglm700.learnsoft.com/LSGLM/Login/iowalogindhs.aspx.\n\nOn the “Overview” tab, locate your dashboard.\n\nClick on the “Print Transcripts Report” below the number of Completed Courses.\n\nClick on the printer icon in the top left corner to print the transcript.\n\nIf you took the HHS training after June 19, 2020, your certificate is available on the Iowa HHS Learning Management System. To access the system, click on this link or copy and paste the following site into your browser: https://lsglm700.learnsoft.com/LSGLM/Login/iowalogindhs.aspx.\n\nTo access mandatory reporter certificates, email MandatoryReporter@dhs.state.ia.us.\n\nQ: What if I question the validity of a HHS certificate an employee provides as proof that mandatory reporter training was completed?\n\nA: Contact MandatoryReporter@dhs.state.ia.us for questions regarding the validity of mandatory reporter training certificates for child abuse or dependent adult abuse.\n\nQ: How do I know if I am a mandatory reporter?\n\nA: Iowa Code 232.69(1) and Iowa Code 235B.3(2) define mandatory reporters in the state of Iowa. Please reference Iowa Code and speak to your employer to determine if your employment falls in the categories outlined. If you continue to have questions whether your employment qualifies you as a mandatory reporter, please seek legal advice from a legal professional. HHS is not able to provide legal advice.\n\nQ: Is the Mandatory Reporter Training curriculum still reviewed and approved by the Department of Public Health?\n\nA: No. Effective July 1, 2019, HHS is responsible for developing and providing all training for mandatory reporters in Iowa.\n\nQ: Is the certification I acquired prior to July 1, 2019, valid?\n\nA: Any certification acquired prior to July 1, 2019, from a provider approved by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) is valid for five years. See this list for all IDPH mandatory reporter training approval/provider numbers.\n\nQ: What prompted the changes to how Mandatory Reporter training is offered?\n\nA: Please see the Mandatory Reporter Training and Certification Workgroup Report.\n\nQ: Does Mandatory Reporter Training taken in another state meet the training requirements in Iowa?\n\nA: No. Any mandatory reporter who practices in Iowa is required by law to take the Iowa Mandatory Reporter Training. States differ in how they define abuse and any mandatory reporter must be knowledgeable about Iowa Code to practice in Iowa.\n\nQ: Is there a fee for the mandatory reporter trainings?\n\nA: There are no fees for the trainings - they are free for all.\n\nQ: What is the timeframe to complete Mandatory Reporter Training?\n\nA: Mandatory reporters for child abuse and mandatory reporters for dependent adult abuse have the same timeframe. Every individual required to report suspected abuse as defined in Iowa Code 232.69(1) and Iowa Code 235B.3(2) must complete the mandatory reporter training within their first six months of employment or self-employment and every three years thereafter(unless otherwise specified by federal regulations). If your employment qualifies you as a mandatory reporter for both child abuse and dependent adult abuse, you are required to take both trainings and maintain certification for both curricula.\n\nQ: Will there be an opportunity for organizations to get a report on their employees from HHS on who has completed the training?\n\nA: HHS will not be able to provide reports regarding who has completed the training. All training participants who successfully complete the training will receive a training certificate. The participant will have the ability to email, download and print their training certificate as proof of training completion. The certification of completion will be retained in the participant's training account, and it can be accessed at any time. Employers who require their staff to provide proof of training should provide clear instructions to their employees on how their organization will track training completion.\n\nQ: Are the child and dependent adult abuse trainings still combined for one 2-hour training?\n\nA: No. There are now separate curricula for child abuse and dependent adult abuse, each with their own certification.\n\nQ: How often am I required to recertify?\n\nA: Mandatory reporters must take the training every 3 years in order to remain in compliance with the law.\n\nQ: Will I be reminded that my 3-year certification is preparing to expire by HHS’ LMS?\n\nA: Not at this time. Mandatory reporters are responsible for keeping their certification current. Once participants have registered and completed Mandatory Reporter Training through HHS’ LMS, they may access their individual account at any time to review their last certification, which includes the completion date.\n\nQ: Is support available to me if I have a technical issue?\n\nA: Yes. Email MandatoryReporter@dhs.state.ia.us for assistance.\n\nQ: Are Continuing Education Units offered for the mandatory reporter trainings?\n\nA: The Iowa Board of Social work states that it is the licensees’ responsibility to determine if the continuing education programs they attend meet the requirements of their professional licensure board. Those important requirements can be located on the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals' (DIAL) website.\n\nThe Iowa Board of Nursing has approved the mandatory reporter trainings, for both child abuse and dependent adult abuse, as fulfilling 2.0 contact hours of nursing continuing education. Questions regarding nursing CEUs may be directed to ibon.heldesk@iowa.gov.\n\nFor all other disciplines, please direct any questions regarding CEUs to your respective professional licensure board.\n\nQ: Can an employer administer the training?\n\nA: No, each participant must create their own account on HHS’ LMS and take the training individually. An employer can provide supplemental training as it relates to their professional practice in addition to the core training curriculum provided by HHS.\n\nQ. What if there are multiple mandatory reporters who need to report the same abuse?\n\nA. When more than one mandatory reporter reasonably suspects abuse involving the same incident, each mandatory reporter is required to make a report of suspected abuse. One call can be made to make the report jointly. Just assure that the names and contact information for all mandatory reporters making the joint report are provided to the HHS intake worker and that each of the reporters' concerns are provided during the call."
