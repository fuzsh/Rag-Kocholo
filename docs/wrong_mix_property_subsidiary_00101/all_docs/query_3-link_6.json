        "text": "Policy\n\nPlease only use images to illustrate problems that can't be made clear in any other way.\n\nInstead of using images for code, copy and paste the code as text into your question or answer, select it, and hit the code button in the toolbar (it looks like {}) or press Ctrl+K. (If you wish to format it by hand, you can insert four spaces before each line of code, or use code fences.)\n\nSimilarly, copy and paste any other textual data relevant to the question - such as commands typed at a terminal prompt, errors (or exception stack traces), logs, configuration, or project files - rather than showing an image.\n\nIf the text was output to a terminal, it's usually better to format it the same way as the code - it may have been designed to use \"ASCII art\" assuming a monospace font, and may contain characters with special meaning in Markdown/HTML. Otherwise, consider using block-quote formatting instead.\n\nSee also:\n\nHow do I format my code blocks?\n\nHow do I format my posts using Markdown or HTML?\n\nQuestions that contain images instead of code are generally closed for lacking debugging details - the image content is simply not taken into consideration, because it isn't properly usable as described below. Once such a question is edited to include a minimal, reproducible example in plain text form, it can be reopened.\n\nAnswers that only contain images are generally subject to deletion as well, and can similarly be undeleted if edited to include text.\n\nWhy shouldn't I use images?\n\nSite usability reasons\n\nImages cannot be interpreted by screen readers, making them completely inaccessible for users with visual impairments.\n\nCode or sample data in images can't be copied and pasted into an editor and compiled in order to reproduce the problem.\n\nImages are large and hard to read on mobile devices, and often cost mobile users valuable data.\n\nImages can be blocked by corporate proxies, certain school networks, and entire countries (notably China), and therefore the code isn't available to those readers.\n\nImages can't be searched and therefore aren't useful to future readers or even present readers using Ctrl+F.\n\nImages are harder to read than text.\n\nText can be zoomed in and out at the user's convenience.\n\nImages that are very wide or tall can cause very small text and an unnecessary amount of scroll.\n\nDark theme users may find it more difficult to read text in a white box on an otherwise dark page.\n\nImages with transparent backgrounds might be perfectly visible in the light theme but completely unreadable in dark mode, or vice versa.\n\nPosting images of your code can be more difficult than copying/pasting the actual code and formatting it. For example, if you notice a minor typo, you would need to fix it in your editor, take a new screenshot, and upload it, instead of simply fixing the typo directly.\n\nHosted image URLs often become stale and unavailable, breaking future ability to read the post.\n\nImages show a limited number of lines of code. For moderately complex questions, you cannot fit all the required code on a single screen, even when you have created the most minimal example possible to reproduce the issue at hand.\n\nOthers can't help improve your question by fixing your code formatting.\n\nOthers can't see if an error in your code is caused by, say, invisible characters or misuse of Unicode characters that look the same (as in this case).\n\nUsers with poor network speeds may be unable to load certain images at all. Users with very restrictive data plans may even disable images entirely to save their data quota.\n\nYou're asking us to volunteer our time for free to solve your problem, and you should make it as easy as possible for us to do so.\n\nTechnical reasons\n\nImages require more bandwidth than text: a simple 200 byte text snippet costs a thousand times less bandwidth than a 200 KB image. Since Stack Overflow serves hundreds of millions of views a day, this increase in bandwidth is significant â€” every byte and every millisecond count.\n\nThe data dumps do not include images; any offline uses for the data dump, whether officially supported or not, won't see images at all.\n\nSpecific cases for using images\n\nImages are appropriate when the information cannot be conveyed by copying and pasting text. For example:\n\nWhen the text appears in a GUI, and can't be selected or copied out of that GUI.\n\nWhen the problem specifically relates to how the text is rendered or displayed (rather than the actual text content).\n\nThe first reason is that links to images fail.\n\nThe second reason is that text on images is not searchable.\n\nThe third reason is that it gives you an incentive 'not to try'; simply show us a screenshot of your code and call it a day.\n\nWe expect a minimal amount of effort to formulate the question properly, which includes:\n\nThe minimum code that compiles that reproduces the problem\n\nThe error message you receive (with stack trace)\n\nWhat you expect to happen\n\nWhat actually happens\n\n(See Minimal, Reproducible Example)\n\nA screenshot of code is not acceptable by itself; you should include the code as well."
