        "text": "Common causes of code 227 are:\n\n1. Incomplete patient information: The healthcare provider may have failed to collect all the necessary information from the patient, insured party, or responsible party. This could include missing contact details, insurance information, or other essential data required for claims processing.\n\n2. Insufficient documentation: The documentation provided by the patient, insured party, or responsible party may be incomplete or insufficient to support the claim. This could include missing medical records, diagnostic reports, or other supporting documents required for proper billing and reimbursement.\n\n3. Lack of response from the patient/insured/responsible party: The healthcare provider may have requested additional information or documentation from the patient, insured party, or responsible party, but did not receive a timely response. Without the necessary information, the claim cannot be processed correctly, resulting in a denial with code 227.\n\n4. Missing or incorrect remark code: When submitting a claim, it is essential to include the appropriate remark code to provide additional context or explanation for the denial. If the remark code is missing or incorrect, it can lead to a denial with code 227.\n\n5. Non-compliance with NCPDP reject reason code: The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) provides reject reason codes that indicate specific issues with claims. If the healthcare provider fails to comply with the required NCPDP reject reason code, it can result in a denial with code 227.\n\n6. Non-compliance with remittance advice remark code: Similarly, if the healthcare provider fails to include the appropriate remittance advice remark code that is not an ALERT, it can lead to a denial with code 227. These remark codes provide additional information about the denial or payment adjustment.\n\nIt is important for healthcare providers to address these common causes to minimize claim denials and ensure a smooth revenue cycle management process."
