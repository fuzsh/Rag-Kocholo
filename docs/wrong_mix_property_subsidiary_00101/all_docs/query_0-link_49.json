        "text": "In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, where data privacy and artificial intelligence (AI) play pivotal roles, organizations must prioritize staying ahead of the curve.\n\nAt UKG, we take this responsibility seriously.\n\nAs a leader in innovation and responsible business practices, we’re joining the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF), a global non-profit organization that brings together industry, academics, civil society, and policymakers to explore the challenges posed by technological innovation, including AI, and develop privacy protections, ethical norms, and workable business practices.\n\nIn our mission to build artificial intelligence that benefits all employees, from the frontline to the front office, UKG has committed to the responsible and ethical use of AI. This forum will help us deepen that commitment in three critical areas:\n\n1. Shaping policies\n\nThe FPF provides a collaborative space for senior executives from more than 200 organizations worldwide to discuss and develop impactful solutions. By joining the FPF, UKG’s leaders can share their perspectives, learn from industry peers, and shape best practices and policies on privacy and AI issues.\n\n2. Virtual roundtables\n\nThe FPF organizes virtual privacy and AI roundtables, which focus on the pressing challenges and emerging trends identified by industry leaders. By participating in these discussions, UKG gains access and contributes to a wealth of insights, diverse viewpoints, and thought leadership from privacy and AI experts.\n\n3. Access to subject matter experts\n\nThe FPF also offers an extensive network of subject matter experts who possess deep knowledge and understanding of privacy and AI governance globally. These experts can provide guidance, answer queries, and offer strategic advice tailored to the specific needs of UKG. This access to thought leaders and domain experts ensures that UKG remains at the forefront of emerging trends and developments in the field, seizing opportunities effectively as we rapidly expand our global footprint.\n\nOur mission: Building technology for all\n\nUKG is looking forward to engaging and working with the more than 200 leading companies and organizations that have joined the FPF. The FPF community gives us the opportunity to pursue our commitment to developing industry-leading best practices and norms in privacy and AI governance with like-minded leaders.\n\nOur mission is to inspire every organization to become a great place to work for all—and the FPF is a valuable partner in realizing that vision.\n\nExplore how our new generative AI enhancements will make things simpler for you and drive better outcomes for your people."
