        "text": "Committed to a transformative path forward in support of every Maryland student\n\nAt the Maryland State Department of Education, we are a dedicated team of educators, specialists, and administrators joined together by a single vision: to be a system of world-class schools where students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for success in college, career, and life.\n\nâ€‹Recent Reports\n\nFinal Report: Maryland College and Career Readiness Empirical Study\n\nThe Blueprint required MSDE to commission an empirical study of the interim CCR standard and its adequacy to identify the students who have demonstrated their knowledge of English language arts and mathematics that enables the student to be successful in entry level credit bearing courses or postsecondary education training at a State community college. MSDE contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) to conduct a multi-part study of the CCR standard.\n\nStudent Assessments\n\nMaryland Comprehensive Assessment Program\n\n2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) Data will be released at the end of September. MCAP provides information to educators, families and the public on student progress towards proficiency on the Maryland state content standards. Through a strong assessment system, stakeholders gain an understanding of how schools are performing and where assistance can be directed to support student growth and achievement.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMaryland Sun Bucks\n\nMaryland SUN Bucks helps families with school-aged children who receive free or reduced-price meals buy groceries during the summer break when school meals are unavailable. Building on the former Summer SNAP program, Maryland SUN Bucks will help 543,000 children across the state who receive free and reduced-priced meals.\n\nFamilies who qualify for the Maryland SUN Bucks program will receive $40 for June, July, and August (a total of $120) for each eligible student."
