OVERVIEW This document defines the business policies, procedures and requirements governing the design, implementation and operation of the Brand Certificate Authority (CA). It addresses all aspects of the Brand Certificate Authority including operations, key and certificate management, interaction with other entities, security, auditing and reporting. 1.1 Focus ----- This document focuses on the Brand Certificate Authority policies procedures and requirements needed to support Visa's Secure Electronic Commerce (SEC) Services. All CA functions are collectively known as Visa's Electronic Certification Services (ECS). 1.2 Purpose ------- The Brand CA (BCA) issues SEC compliant digital certificates to Brand members (Issuers and Acquirers or their processors) that wish participate in Visra Secure Electronic Commerce (SEC) Services. The Brand CA issues Cardholder CA (CCA) certificates for use in issuing certificates to their cardholders and Merchant CA (MCA) certificates for use in issuing certificates to their merchants. In addition the Brand CA will issue certificates to Brand operated Payment Gateway CAs (PCA) for use in issuing certificates to Acquirer Payment Gateways. The Brand CA will also issue certificates to Geo-political CAs (GCA). The Brand CA issues three types of certificates for each of their members: certificate signature certificates, key exchange certificates and message signature certificates. The Brand CA will only directly interact with the Root CA (RCA), Geopolitical CAs, Cardholder CAs, Merchant CAs, and Payment Gateway CAs. The Brand CA is also responsible for establishing and publishing policies and procedures that clearly define the purpose, usage, value and guidelines of certificates that it issues. It also establishes policies, procedures and requirements that govern the design, implementation and operation of subordinate CAs within the Brand CA's domain. 1.3 Availability/Phase ------------------ The policies, procedures and requirements identified and defined within this document are expected to be in operation and/or the deliverable met for acceptance testing of Test 1. Exceptions to this are identified by \"(xx)\" where xx represents the acceptance test of the phase upon which it must be in operation and/or the deliverable met. Test 1 will be based on the April/May 1996 release of the SET specifications. Pilot will be based on Version 1.0 of SET. For additional or specific schedule information refer to the overall Visa SEC Service project plan. 1 <PAGE> 2.

Note: Key management requirements are based on the use of a BBN cryptographic module. Similar methods must be used for non-BBN cryptographic modules. Visa will review and approve methods used for non-BBN cryptographic modules prior to implementation. 3.5.1 KEY SECURITY 1. All BCA cryptographic functions will be performed in tamper proof and detectable hardware that complies to FIPS 140 level 3 requirements. (T2) 2. Hardware security devices shall be able to indicate failure, error condition and evidence of tamper. 3. The PPK pair must be generated within the hardware security device in which that key will be used. The only exception to this is in generating backup cryptographic devices that require the same keying information. 4. The BCA private keys shall never appear outside of the hardware security device in any form. The only exception to this is in generating backup cryptographic devices that require the same keying information. 8 <PAGE> 5. All BCA private keys must be kept in a single tamper evident hardware security device. 3.5.2 KEY GENERATION 1. The BCA keys must be generated according to Visa's direction as defined in a policy document that is mutually agreed upon by Visa and VeriSign. 2. The BCA public and private key (PPK) pairs must be generated using random (RNG) or pseudo-random (PRNG) techniques. 3. Any RNG/PRNG technique used to generate PPK pairs must have a low correlation value of results to ensure unpredictability. Correlation values must be documented and may be reviewed by Visa at its discretion. 4. The generation of each PPK pair must be conducted within a secure room rated for tempest security. The equipment may, if tempest rated, suffice. 5. Authorized BCA personnel only may generate PPK pairs. 6. Before generating each PPK pair, the hardware device must be made secure by guidelines as described by Visa International. 7. An audit control log must be kept for each PPK pair generated. 8. Brand CIK token holders may not also be Member CIK token holders. 3.5.3 KEY EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL 1. 30 days prior to expiration of existing BCA certificates, the BCA will generate new key pairs for the corresponding application. Following key generation, the BCA shall request a new certificate from the RCA. The new certificate will be distributed to all the GCA, CCA, MCA, PCAs within a message that is signed using the private key that corresponds to the valid BCA message signature certificate. (GA) 3.5.4 BRAND KEY COMPROMISE 1. Upon the compromise of a BCA key exchange key pair, the corresponding BCA key exchange certificate will be revoked. A new key pair will be generated and the BCA shall request a new certificate from the RCA. The BCA will distribute the new certificate to GCA, CCA, MCA, and PCAs within a message that is signed using the private key that corresponds to the valid BCA message signature certificate. (P) 2. Upon the compromise of a BCA message signature key pair, the corresponding BCA message signature certificate will be revoked. A new key pair will be generated and the BCA shall request a new certificate from the RCA. The BCA will distribute the new certificate to GCA, CCA, MCA, and PCAs within a message that is signed using the private key that corresponds to the new BCA message signature certificate. (P) 9 <PAGE> 3. Upon the compromise of a BCA certificate signature key pair, the corresponding BCA certificate signature certificate will be revoked. A new key pair will be generated and the BCA shall request a new certificate from the RCA. All GCA, CCA, MCA, and PCA certificates signed by the compromised key will be revoked. New certificates will be issued and signed using the newly generated key pair. The new certificates along with the new BCA certificate signature certificate will be sent to all GCA, CCA, MCA, and PCAs who's certificates were revoked. These certificates will be sent within a message that is signed using the private key that corresponds to the valid BCA message signature certificate. In addition, all other GCA, CCA, MCA, and PCAs will receive the new certificate within a similar message. (P) 4. Upon the compromise of a BCA Root key exchange key pair, the corresponding BCA Root key exchange certificate will be revoked. A new key pair will be generated and the BCA shall request a new certificate from the RCA. (GA) 5. Upon the compromise of a BCA Root message signature key pair, the corresponding BCA Root message signature certificate will be revoked. A new key pair will be generated and the BCA shall request a new certificate from the RCA in a trusted, off-line manner. (GA) 3.5.5 KEY BACKUP 1. Each BCA private key will have a corresponding backup housed within a fill device; each fill device must be kept in a separate location known only to authorized CA personnel; access to backup key must be under dual control. 2. Backup facilities are subject to same key management requirements as the primary faci"
