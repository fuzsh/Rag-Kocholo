        "text": "Novartis Rumored to Sell Gerber to Nestle\n\nNovember 29, 2006 - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG is rumored to be considering the sale of baby food maker Gerber Products Co. to Nestlé, reported the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Novartis has confirmed that its medical nutrition business is up for sale as part of the Swiss pharmaceutical group's decision to concentrate on the four pillars of patented medicines, vaccines, generics and over the counter products. According to WSJ, Novartis may already be in negotiations with Nestlé to sell its medical-nutrition business, and Nestlé executives may be entertaining the idea of acquiring Gerber as part of the same deal. The Gerber and Novartis's medical-nutrition business would sell for between $4 billion and $5 billion combined with Gerber alone valued at more than $3 billion.\n\nEarlier this week, Novartis also unveiled plans for multiple new product approvals and launches over the next two years. Many of these approvals are for potentially best-in-class medicines that would advance treatment standards for patients with hypertension, diabetes, cancer and other diseases. \"Over the next two years we will launch several innovative medicines and continue to invest aggressively in discovery research and development activities and complement our own skills and technologies through attractive collaborations,\" says Dr. Daniel Vasella, chairman and CEO of Novartis. In total, Novartis now has 138 projects in pharmaceutical clinical development.\n\nPayless ShoeSource and Disney Collaborate on Kids' Footwear Line\n\nDisney and Payless ShoeSource strengthen their relationship with plans to develop their first 'direct-to-retail' licensed footwear collection. The multi-year deal will bring together the Payless and Disney design teams to create a special line of fun, high-quality footwear styles featuring Disney and Disney*Pixar characters. Payless will source, market and sell the line through its nearly 4,600 store chain and on Payless.com. Payless has sold Disney-themed footwear and accessories for several years; however, the two companies will now work more closely on shoe design, creative direction and retail marketing. \"Payless is ideal for our first direct-to-retail footwear collaboration because the company is well-aligned with Disney's goal to create quality, on-trend products for kids and families,\" says Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney Consumer Products. \"Being closely involved with the shoe design process is a significant step for us, and we plan to have a truly integrated relationship with Payless, the nation's leading footwear retailer, from creative to point of sale.\"\n\nQuiksilver Inc. Forms Mexican Joint Venture\n\nQuiksilver Inc. creates a joint venture with PBM International to market, sell and distribute \"Quiksilver\" and \"Roxy\" branded products in Mexico. The joint venture will be responsible for establishing a Mexican distribution network of company-owned retail stores as well as a wholesale business that will include licensed retail stores, large key accounts and small independent retailers. This venture furthers Quiksilver Inc.'s strategy to own and operate its business in key territories. Quiksilver Inc. believes that the Mexican market, which includes popular high-end surfing and travel destinations in a number of coastal cities in Baja and mainland Mexico, is highly attractive and that the Quiksilver and Roxy brands will resonate well with consumers in this market. \"This new venture is a perfect fit for our strategy. Not only is Mexico an exciting and potentially meaningful market, but we are very confident that we have found exactly the right partner in PBM International,\" says Bernard Mariette, president of Quiksilver Inc. \"This is another important step in the advance of our strategy to become the world's leader in the outdoor sports lifestyle market. We are excited for the development of this venture and believe it will prove to be quickly successful.\"\n\nConsumer Spending Strong at Start of Holiday Season\n\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) indicated that U.S. shoppers spent 18.9 percent more over the Thanksgiving weekend than last year, kicking off holiday gift buying with purchases of discounted wide-screen televisions and clothes. Consumers spent an average $360.15 each over the weekend, up from $302.81 a year earlier, said the NRF. Shoppers limited much of their spending to sale items such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s $997 37-inch LCD TV and Sears Holding Corp.'s discounted jewelry and toys, said Bloomberg consultant Howard Davidowitz. According to Nielsen//NetRatings, the Holiday eShopping Index also increased 12 percent from home on the day after Thanksgiving, garnering a 19.2 million consumers across more than 120 representative online retailers, compared with 17.2 million on Black Friday last year. The fastest growing product category week over week was consumer electronics, with a 211 percent increase in unique audience from November 17th to November 24th. Apparel took the No. 2 spot with 117 percent Web traffic growth, followed by Home & Garden with 87 percent growth.\n\nToday, Small Business Can Think Really Big\n\nTechnology Presents Small Businesses With Endless Opportunity for Today's Entrepreneurs\n\nBy Joseph R.Cardamone, President, United States Federation of Small Businesses (USFSB)\n\nTen years ago, few technology experts could have predicted what the Internet has become today. Few could have imagined the vast dependence on e-mail, the thought of the Web becoming a worldwide auction house or that cell phones would access tiny versions of the online world. Now, a minor disruption in our communication devices and platforms makes us wonder how we ever worked without them.\n\nTechnology also makes this a great time to be in a small business. Accessibility and rapid advances of technology, coupled with changes in the traditional corporate career ladder, have spurred a change in the small business community. Many people are embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and are starting their own businesses as sole proprietors. These entrepreneurs and their businesses are leveraging the Web to move more and more of their business functionality to the online community.\n\nWe hear more and more of small business owners who compete with the \"big boys\" on a newly leveled playing field. From hosting their own Web sites, to accessing hardware and software that can cut down on office overhead, small businesses can operate nimbly but effectively.\n\nA new generation of American businesses, the so-called \"Web-Driven Entrepreneurs,\" make up 25 percent of all U.S. small businesses, according to a recent study by Warrillow and Co. These businesses are twice as likely to say that their customer base is national in scope, and, not surprisingly, twice as likely to read or publish a blog. These Web-savvy businesses were also found to be more focused on expansion than their traditional counterparts.\n\nAs consumers embrace technology, so too must small businesses to be successful. In 2005, a study by Harris Interactive found that more than a quarter of consumers say that they have become \"much more accepting\" of technology over the past year. More and more are going to the Web for product information, special limited time offers and \"how-to\" instructions.\n\nIn many small businesses, many hats are worn - we are both the CEO and administrative assistant - and other roles in between. The goal is to spend as much time as possible being the CEO. Efficiency is a key to success, no matter how small or ordinary the task may be. This used to come at a higher price - either of time or money. But there are plenty of examples of technology reducing that margin. For example, small- and home-based business owners do not have to choose between buying an expensive postal meter system and standing in line at the Post Office. DYMO - a company that has long provided great solutions to small business - earlier this year introduced DYMO Stamps, which enables printing of U.S. Postal Service approved postage without a monthly fee or contract.\n\nAdditionally, advances in accounting software have made small businesses able to build and track inventory assemblies, customize their pricing levels, track job costs, create and customize business plans, create sales and expense forecasts and assess company performance trends. Five years ago, a company with a Web site was considered ahead of the curve. Now, it's no longer enough to have a well-designed site. Business owners need to take advantage of every advantage they can find. Web analytic packages are helping find out what's going wrong (or right) with a site by determining where potential customers are leaving, as well as where customers are coming from and why. This data not only increases efficiency but can make or break a business.\n\nThere are also great organizations that are resources to the small and medium-sized business owner. For example, the United States Federation of Small Businesses USFSB, which consists of 50,000 small business members, provides support, networking opportunities, group health insurance and political advocacy for each of its members.\n\nIt is an exciting time for small businesses. Never before has there been a greater opportunity for expansion and growth. Most of this is accomplished by the tremendous advances in Web technology. The time is now to seize this opportunity, but always remember the little things that can make the transition and change better for you, your employees, and, most of all, the consumer.\n\nJoseph R.. Caradmone is president of the United States Federation of Small Businesses (USFSB). Founded in 1983 by small business owners, USFSB advocates for the rights and interests of small businesses and the self-employed. Their mission is to help their members grow and prosper by joining together and effectively promote small business interests before local, state and federal lawmakers."
