        "text": "The legislation requires each State to submit a Highway Safety Improvement Program report that:\n\nDescribes the progress being made to implement highway safety improvement projects;\n\nAssesses the effectiveness of those improvements; and\n\nDescribes the extent to which the improvements have contributed to reducing fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads.\n\nThe Highway Safety Improvement Program Reporting Guidance provides information to States on the reporting frequency and schedule, content and structure of the report, and provisions related to the protection of data from discovery and admission into evidence. The HSIP online reporting tool is available to support the annual HSIP reporting process. All States use the HSIP online reporting tool to satisfy the HSIP reporting requirements, as required by 23 CFR 924.\n\nEach State's HSIP report can be viewed by selecting the state name below. Any questions about individual State reports should be directed to the respective State DOT.\n\nFHWA compiles the information collected in the HSIP reports and produces an HSIP National Summary Report. The HSIP National Summary Report provides aggregate information related to the States progress in implementing HSIP projects. Progress in implementing HSIP projects is described based on the amount of HSIP funds available and the number and general listing of projects initiated during the reporting period.\n\nHSIP National Summary Baseline Report: 2009-2012\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2013\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2014\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2015\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2016\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2017\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2018\n\nHSIP National Summary Report: 2019\n\nTelling the HSIP Story - 2022\n\nHSIP Saves Lives - 2022\n\nUsing HSIP to Improve Vulnerable Road User Safety\n\nEnhancing Nighttime Safety with HSIP\n\nHSIP Supports Local Plans and Programs\n\nPreventing Roadway Departure Crashes with HSIP\n\nThe Railway Highway Crossing Program\n\nTelling the HSIP Story - 2021\n\nHSIP Saves Lives in 2021\n\nUsing Data to Drive HSIP Investments - 2021\n\nHSIP Calms Intersections - 2021\n\nHSIP Funds Proven Safety Countermeasures - 2021\n\nHSIP Reached Rural Roads - 2021\n\nHSIP Supports Safer Railway-Highway Crossings - 2021\n\nTelling the HSIP Story - 2020\n\nHSIP in 2020\n\nImproving Local Road Safety with HSIP - 2020\n\nKeeping Pedestrians Safe with HSIP - 2020\n\nAdvancing Speed Management Strategies with HSIP - 2020\n\nImplementing Systemic Safety Improvements with HSIP - 2020\n\nState Reports\n\n2013 HSIP State Reports\n\n2014 HSIP State Reports\n\n2015 HSIP State Reports\n\n2016 HSIP State Reports\n\n2017 HSIP State Reports\n\n2018 HSIP State Reports\n\n2019 HSIP State Reports\n\n2020 HSIP State Reports\n\n2021 HSIP State Reports\n\n2022 HSIP State Reports\n\n2023 State HSIP Reports\n\nInterested in seeing what your peers in other States are doing?
