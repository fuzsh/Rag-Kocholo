The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Adam Putnam (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Putnam, Miller, and Clay. Staff present: Bob Dix, staff director; John Hambel, senior counsel; Chip Walker, Scott Klein, and Lori Martin, professional staff members; Ursula Wojciechowski, clerk; Suzanne Lightman, fellow; Jamie Harper and Erik Glavich, legislative assistants; David McMillen, minority professional staff member; and Jean Gosa, minority assistant clerk. Mr. Putnam. The quorum being present, the Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations and the Census will come to order. Good morning. Today we continue our in-depth review of cyber security issues affecting our Nation. There are several things unique to cyber attacks that make the task of preventing them difficult. Cyber attacks can occur from anywhere around the globe, from the caves of Afghanistan to the battlefields of Iraq, from the most remote regions in the world or right here in our own back yard. The technology used for cyber attacks is readily available and changes continually, and perhaps most dangerous of all is the failure of many people, including those who are critical to securing these networks and information from attack, to take the threat seriously, to receive adequate training and take proactive steps needed to secure their networks. A severe cyber attack would have devastating repercussions throughout the Nation in a physical sense and in real economic dollars. The initial plan for this hearing was to focus primarily on strategies and methodologies within the agencies of the Federal Government for identifying and mitigating computer vulnerabilities through a system of patch management. Recent events, however, have caused us to expand the boundaries of this hearing to include computer systems throughout the Nation. This summer, everyone once again realized how vulnerable our computer networks are to cyber attack. The Blaster worm and SoBig.F virus brought home the reality that unsecured computer systems are all too prevalent and that as a Nation across all levels, government, business and home users, we must take computer security more seriously than we have in the past. The Blaster worm infected over 400,000 computers in under 5 days. In fact, 1 in 3 Internet users are infected with some type of virus or worm every year. The speed at which worms and viruses can spread is astonishing and a contributing fact to that rapid spread is the lethargic pace at which people deploy the patches that can prevent infection in the first place. Microsoft announced the vulnerability and had the patch available weeks before the exploit appeared. Recent viruses and worms have been blamed for bringing down train signaling stations throughout the East, affecting the entire CSX railroad system, which covers 23 States. Additionally, new information is coming to light that the Blaster worm is being linked to the severity of the power blackout of last month. The North American Electric Reliability Council blames another worm, Slammer, for impairing bulk electric system control by bringing down networks. We learned last week that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a formal information notice to nuclear power plant operators warning them about an incident in January in which the Slammer computer worm penetrated networks in Ohio's Davis-Besse nuclear plant and disabled two important monitoring systems for hours. A recent Gartner study predicts that by the year 2005, 90 percent of cyber attacks will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities for which a patch is already available or a solution known. So why aren't systems patched and why aren't anti-virus programs kept up to date? This hearing will examine the issues surrounding these incidents, including how vulnerabilities are discovered, how the public is notified about potential vulnerabilities, the mechanisms for protection, the real and potential problems presented by patch systems and the scope of the problem confronting the Federal Government, the business community, and the general public. System administrators are often overwhelmed with simply maintaining all the systems they have responsibility for overseeing. Challenges that organizations face in maintaining their systems are significant. With an estimated 4,000 vulnerabilities being discovered every year, it is an enormous challenge for any but the best resourced organizations to install all of the software patches that are released by the manufacturer. Not only is the sheer quantity of patches overwhelming for administrators and everyone else to keep up with, but patches can be difficult to apply and have unexpected side effects on other systems that administrators must then evaluate and address. As a result, after a patch is released, administrators often take a long time to fix all of their vulnerable computer systems. Obviously small organizations and home users who lack the skills of system administrators are even less likely to keep up with the flow of patches. The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Computer Incident Response Center recently let a $10.8 million 5-year contract for governmentwide patch management service to notify agencies about security holes in commercial software for systems on their networks and the availability of patches to fix them. The service is known as the patch authentication and dissemination capability [PADC]. The goal is to simplify patch management by providing administrators only with information relevant to their systems and ensuring that patches are genuine and affected. PADC went on-line in January of this year. According to officials, once agency system administrators have provided a profile of their systems and software, PADC will alert them to potential vulnerabilities, provide interim security advice until a patch is available, disseminate available patches and keep management informed of available patches and which ones their systems administrators have downloaded. Large organizations such as business and educational institutions often rely on commercial firms to notify them of vulnerabilities. For example, there are several firms that offer vulnerability notification combined with analysis of the customer's computer system for those vulnerabilities. These firms also provide information on where to get the patches and prioritize them for administrators. In addition, the commercial critical infrastructure sectors depend on information from their information sharing analysis centers [ISACs], to help them respond to potential cyber threats. These ISACs are designed to allow members of a sector to share information about incidents to help increase preparedness and vigilance. The progress of Blaster demonstrates the importance of the early warning systems that ISACs are tasked with developing. Independent researchers discover most vulnerabilities. These researchers may be academics, consultants or Black Hats. The Organization for Internet Security is working with software vendors, consultants and other interested parties to formalize procedures for dealing with vulnerabilities, including vendor notification and control disclosures. There's a very important role for government to play in these disclosure procedures. It is no longer acceptable for vendors to determine on their own schedule who gets notified and when. Given the potential national security risk that can emanate from the exploitation of a vulnerability, it is imperative that the appropriate government entities be involved in this process from the beginning. Vulnerabilities in software and the worms and viruses that exploit them have become a fact of life for the Internet. The government, law enforcement and private industry must develop and continue to update a plan to deal with these emerging threats. How can we educate home and small business users to minimize the risk posed by zombie computers? How can researchers, the government and software industry work together to identify and remedy vulnerabilities in the most instructive manner? And how will the Federal Government evolve an effective patch management program? What can be done to expedite the discovery and prosecution of cyber criminals who release worms and viruses? And most important of all, how can the Federal Government, law enforcement and industry work together to protect the vital infrastructure of the Internet? [The prepared statement of Hon. Adam H. Putnam follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.003 Mr. Putnam. We have an outstanding line up of witnesses this morning who will share with us their expertise as we explore worms and viruses and how we can better protect the Nation's computers. As is the custom of this committee, we'll ask our witnesses as they are seated in panel one to rise and be sworn in. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Putnam. Note for the record that all of the witnesses responded in the affirmative. We will begin with our first witness, and we have three panels. The panels are rather large panels. They are unusually large for this subcommittee, but the scope of our topic demanded it. But we would ask that all of our witnesses adhere as best they can to our 5-minute rule. And I will introduce Mr. Dacey. Robert Dacey is currently Director of Information, Security Issues at the U.S. General Accounting Office. His responsibilities include evaluating information systems security in Federal agencies and corporations, including the development of related methodologies, assessing the Federal infrastructure for managing information security, evaluating the Federal Government's efforts to protect our Nation's private and public critical infrastructure from cyber threats and identifying best security practices at leading organizations and promoting their adoption by Federal agencies. In addition to his many years at information security auditing, Mr. Dacey has also led GAO's annual audits of the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. Government, GAO'S financial audit quality assurance efforts, including methodology and training and other GAO financial statement audits. We appreciate you being a part of this panel, and you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENTS OF ROBERT DACEY, DIRECTOR, IT SECURITY, GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE; RICHARD PETHIA, DIRECTOR, CERT COORDINATION CENTER; LAWRENCE HALE, DIRECTOR, FEDCIRC, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; NORMAN LORENTZ, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET; AND JOHN MALCOLM, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, CRIMINAL DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Mr. Dacey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here today to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on cyber incidents and the role of software patch management in mitigating the risks that these types of events will recur. I will briefly summarize my written statement. The exploitation of software vulnerabilities by hackers and others can result in significant damage to both Federal and private sector computer systems, ranging from Web site defacements to gaining the ability to read, modify or delete sensitive information, destroy systems, disrupt operations or launch attacks against other organizations. The number of reported security vulnerabilities and software products has grown dramatically in recent years to over 11,000 cumulatively reported by CERT/CC since 1995. Factors increasing the risk of system vulnerabilities and exploits include the increasing complexity and size of software programs, the increasing sophistication and availability of hacking tools, increasing system interconnectivity combined with decreasing length of time from the announcement of a vulnerability until it is exploited, and decreasing length of time for attacks to infiltrate the Internet. Although generally available before vulnerability exploits are launched, patches are too frequently not installed, resulting in damages to unpatched systems. My written testimony refers to several of these exploits and summarizes the responses to two recently reported serious vulnerabilities. Given these increasing risks, effective patch management programs have become critical to securing both Federal and private sector systems. Key elements of a patch management program include top management support, standardized policies, procedures and tools; dedicated resources and clearly assigned responsibilities; current technology inventories; identification of relevant vulnerabilities and patches; patch risk assessment and testing; patch distribution; and monitoring system through networks and host vulnerability scanning. There are several efforts to address software vulnerability in the Federal systems, including OMB reporting requirements concerning agency patch management programs as part of the Federal Information Security Management Act [FISMA]; NIST, patch management guidance, and FedCIRC incident reporting, handling and prevention handling services. For example, as you mentioned in your statement, FedCIRC provides PADC, a patch notification service, which provides agencies at no charge with information on trusted authenticated patches for their specific technologies. PADC currently has 41 agency subscribers, although OMB recently reported that actual usage of those accounts are extremely low. A number of commercial tools and resources are available that can assist in performing patch management functions more efficiently and effectively, such as identifying relevant patches, deploying patches, scanning systems for vulnerabilities and providing management reporting. In addition to implementing effective patch management processes, several other steps can be taken to address software vulnerabilities. These include one, deploying other technologies such as antivirus software, firewalls and other network security and configuration tools to provide a layered defense against attacks; two, employing more rigorous software engineering practices in designing, implementing and testing software products to reduce the number of potential vulnerabilities; three, improving tools to more efficiently and effectively manage patching; four, researching and developing technologies to prevent, detect and recover from attacks as well as identify perpetrators; and five, ensuring effective tested contingency planning processes and procedures. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I will be pleased to answer any questions that you have at this time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Dacey follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.023 Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much, Mr. Dacey. I appreciate you adhering to our 5-minute rule as well. Our next witness is Richard Pethia. Mr. Pethia directs the CERT Coordination Center, which conducts security incident response activities and fosters the development of incident response infrastructures that leads to rapid correction of vulnerabilities and resolution of incidents. Working out of the software engineering institute at Carnegie Mellon University, he has been tracking vulnerabilities for 15 years. Before coming to SEI, Mr. Pethia was the Director of Engineering at the Decision Data Co. He has over 30 years experience in both technical and managerial positions. You are recognized for 5 minutes, Mr. Pethia. Mr. Pethia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you especially for the opportunity to testify on the issue of defending against cyber viruses and worms. At the CERT Coordination Center since 1988, we have handled over 260,000 security incidents and have helped to resolve over 11,000 vulnerabilities, published hundreds of security alerts and security best practice guides and provide training in a variety of security topics. Worms and viruses are both in a more general category of programs called malicious code. Both exploit weaknesses in computer software, replicating themselves and are attaching themselves to other programs. They spread quickly. By definition, worms are programs that spread without human intervention once they have been introduced into the system. And viruses are programs that require some action on the part of the user, such as opening an e-mail attachment. Today these worms and viruses are causing damage more quickly than those created in the past and are spreading to the most vulnerable of all systems, computer systems of home users. The Code Red worm spread around the world faster in 2001 than the Melissa virus did in 1999. Just months later, the NIMDA worm caused serious damage within an hour of the first reported infection. And in January of this year Slammer had significant impact in just minutes. Virus and worm attacks alone have resulted in millions of dollars of loss in just the last 12 months. The 2003 computer crime survey states that viruses are the most cited form of attack with an estimated cost of over $27 million across the approximately 500 respondents to the survey. Estimates on the Blaster worm and the SoBig.F virus range from $525 million to more than $1 billion in loss. The cost estimates include lost productivity, wasted hours, lost sales and extra bandwidth cost. For the past 15 years we have relied heavily on fast reaction to ensure the damage is minimized. But today it's clear that reactive solutions alone are no longer adequate. Many attacks are now fully automated and spread with blinding speed. The attack technology has become increasingly complex, increasing the time it takes to analyze the attack and produce countermeasures. We have been increasingly dependent on the Internet. Even short interruptions in service cause significant loss and can jeopardize critical service. Aggressive, coordinated, continually improving response will continue to be necessary, but we also must move quickly to put other solutions in place. System operators must adopt security practices such as information security risk assessments, security management policies and secure system administrations practices. Senior managers must provide visible endorsement and financial support for these security improvement efforts. They must also keep their skills and knowledge current and educate their users to raise awareness of security issues and improve their ability to recognize and respond to problems. Technology vendors must also take steps such as producing virus resistant or virus proof software, dramatically reducing the number of implementation errors in their products that lead to vulnerabilities, and providing secure out of the box configurations that have security options turned on rather than require users to enable the functions. The government can also help by taking a multi-pronged approach: Using its buying power to demand higher quality software, holding vendors more accountable for defects in released products and providing incentives for low defect products and for products that are highly resistant to viruses. Information assurance research is also needed to yield networks capable of surviving attacks while preserving sensitive information. Among the activities should be the creation of a unified and integrated framework for all information assurance, rigorous methods to assess and manage risk, quantitative techniques to determine the cost benefit of risk mitigation strategies, systematic tools and simulation tools to analyze cascade effects of attacks and new technologies for resisting, recognizing and recovering from attacks, accidents and failures. More technical specialists should be trained to expand its scholarship programs to build the university infrastructure we will need for the long-term development of trained security professionals. And to encourage safe computing the government should support the development of education material and programs about cyber space for all users, including home users and small businesses, support programs to provide early training and security practices in appropriate use. In conclusion, our dependence on interconnected computing systems is rapidly increasing and even short-term disruptions from viruses and worms have major consequences. Our current solutions are not keeping pace with the increased strength and speed of attack and our information infrastructures are at risk. The National Cyber Security Division formed by the Department of Homeland Security is a critical step toward implementation of some of these recommendations. However, implementing a safer cyber space will require the NCSD and the entire Federal Government to work with State and local governments, the private sector to drive better software practices, more secure products, higher awareness at all levels, increase research and development activities and increase training for special computer users and all users. Thank you.

Thank you very much. Our next witness is Mr. Hale. Lawrence Hale is the Director of the Department of Homeland Security Federal Computer Incident Response Center [FedCIRC]. He has been active in the information assurance community since 1996, when he served the chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff as an information assurance action officer working on security interoperability issues. While at the Pentagon Mr. Hale was a member of the Joint Staff Information Operations Response Cell during a number of exercises and actual cyber events, which have helped to shape U.S. Government policy in dealing with computer security. In January 1999, Mr. Hale became the first uniformed military officer assigned to the National Infrastructure Protection Center at the FBI Headquarters. While there he worked to improve the process of issuing warnings of cyber related events and served on the Y2K task force for the FBI. He retired from the U.S. Navy as a commander in May 2001, has a Master's Degree in national security and strategic studies from the Naval War College and a Master's in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle. Welcome to the subcommittee. Mr. Hale. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Clay. On behalf of the Federal Computer Incident Response Center of the Department of Homeland Security, thank you for this opportunity to appear before you to discuss how we can protect the Nation's computers. I am Lawrence Hale, Director of the FedCIRC, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security's Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. FedCIRC is the Federal-civilian government's trusted focal point for computer security incident reporting, providing assistance with incident prevention and response. Within the Department of Homeland Security Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate is the newly established National Cyber Security Division. The National Cyber Security Division is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the national strategy to secure cyberspace. Key functional areas within the division include Risk Threat and Vulnerability Identification and Reduction, Cyber Security Tracking, Analysis and Response Center and Outreach Awareness and Training. The FedCIRC is now a component of Cyber Security Tracking, Analysis and Response Center. The National Cyber Security Division has combined the information gathering and analytical capabilities of the cyber watch elements of the National Infrastructure Protection Center and the FedCIRC and coordinates with the National Communication System. By doing this, the National Cyber Security Division not only has the added benefit of enhanced resources but the synergy of knowledge created from the unique resources from each of these watch elements. The Federal Government's ability to limit the effects of the recent wave of worms and viruses on its networks demonstrate how these collaborative relationships work and how each participant's contributions help to assess and mitigate potential damage. FedCIRC has the goal of securing the Federal Government's cyberspace. FedCIRC, as noted in the e-Government Act of 2002, the Federal Information Security Management Act, serves as the Federal information security incident center for the Federal civilian government. FedCIRC is the central government non-law enforcement focal point for coordination of response to attacks, promoting incident reporting and cross agency sharing of data about common vulnerabilities. As such, FedCIRC must compile and analyze information about incidents that threaten information security and inform Federal agencies about current and potential information security threats and vulnerabilities. FedCIRC demonstrated the National Cyber Security Division's enhanced coordination role during the recent wave of worms and viruses. Working closely with the CERT Coordination Center and software providers, FedCIRC identified the potential impact of newly disclosed vulnerabilities and developed corrective actions in mitigating strategies. Federal civilian agencies were advised of the existence of these vulnerabilities and given actionable information on reducing their exposure to the threats before attack programs were released. Patches were developed, validated and disseminated to agencies. And working closely with OMB and the Federal CIO Council, agencies were instructed to take action to address the vulnerabilities and report their status. As a result of these measures, the Federal Government was better prepared to avoid damaging impact when the exploit codes that were released in the attack phase of these events occurred. The National Cyber Security Division has a number of initiatives underway to aid in threat vulnerability reduction. As was mentioned, the majority of successful attacks on computer systems result from hackers exploiting the most widely known vulnerabilities in commercial software products. The problem is not that patches to fix these vulnerabilities don't exist, but that existing patches are not quickly and correctly applied. Agencies must have a plan on how patch management is integrated into their configuration management process. FedCIRC's patch authentication and dissemination capability [PADC], a Web enabled service that provides a trusted source of validated patches and notifications on new threat and vulnerabilities, is a first step. FedCIRC's vision is to build from the ability of providing validated patches to developing a more enhanced IT configuration and vulnerability management program that will automate the process. By automating the process, agencies will no longer have the burden of having to manually apply patches which will enable them to have more time to focus on building a more robust configuration management program. In closing, I would like to assure the committee that the National Cyber Security Division is committed to building on the success the FedCIRC has achieved in helping Federal civilian agencies protect their information systems from the most damaging effects of malicious code. National Cyber Security Division must now translate this success to a national scale. I look forward to continuing to work with OMB and the Congress to ensure that we are successful in this important endeavor. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hale follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.037 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.038 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.039 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.040 Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much Mr. Hale. I would like to welcome our distinguished ranking member and vice chair of the subcommittee as well, and we will be taking their opening statements at the conclusion of the first panel's remarks as well. Our next witness is Norman Lorentz. Mr. Lorentz joined the Office of Management and Budget in January 2002 as Chief Technology Officer, the Chief e-Government Architect for the Federal Government. Mr. Lorentz is responsible for identifying and developing support for investments in emerging technology opportunities that will improve the Government's technical information and business architectures. Prior to joining the Federal Government, he was senior vice president and chief technology officer for the IT career solutions provider, Dice, Inc. In this capacity he directed the development of technology strategy and infrastructure. He was also the firm's chief quality officer and a member of the executive committee. He brings to OMB extensive experience in government. From 1998 to 2000, he was senior vice president and chief technology officer for the U.S. Postal Service. In 1998, he receive the Board of Governors Award, the U.S. Postal Service's highest recognition, and this year was named as a Federal 100 winner as well as recognition by Info World magazine as 1 of the 25 most influential CTOs in the United States. And this is your last appearance before a congressional committee as a public servant with OMB, as you will be leaving that agency and moving back into the private sector. So we appreciate your service to the government and to this subcommittee, and you are recognized. Mr. Lorentz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning, members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to discuss this important topic of worm and virus defense. My testimony today will address how the Federal Government protects its IT systems from this pervasive threat. By design, worms and viruses can cause substantial damage and prove disruptive to normal business operations. For this reason it is important for the Federal agencies to continuously and rapidly take proactive measures to lessen the number of successful attacks. The month of August proved to be an unusually busy time for malicious code activity, beginning with Blaster and then quickly spreading the SoBig.F worm. In general, the Federal Government withstood these attacks and the impact on citizen services was minimal. Agencies have improved their protection against malicious code by installing patches, blocking executables at the firewall and using antivirus software with automatic updates. Agencies, however, did report modest impacts associated with both worms to date. Reports from Federal civilian agencies show approximately 1,000 computers affected by each exploit. This impact ranged from a slowdown in agency e-mail to temporary unavailability of agency systems. A number of laptops proved to be susceptible to the infection since configuration management was even on these portable devices. The Federal Government's ability to thwart worms and viruses depends on a number of interlocking management, technical and operational controls. It is critical that these controls continue to evolve to keep pace with this increasingly sophisticated threat. First, how were vulnerabilities discovered? DHS's Federal Computer Incident Response Center [FedCIRC], closely coordinates with a number of industry as well as government partners. These partners include Carnegie Mellon CERT, law enforcement and the Intelligence Community. These organizations routinely communicate advanced notice to DHS regarding the discovery of software vulnerabilities in the development of malicious code. Second, how are agencies notified about these vulnerabilities? OMB and the CIO Council have developed and deployed a process to rapidly identify and respond to cyber threats and critical vulnerabilities. CIOs are advised via conference call as well as followup e-mail of specific actions necessary to protect agency systems. Agencies must then report through FedCIRC to OMB on the implementation of those required countermeasures. This emergency notification and reporting process was instituted for the Microsoft RPC vulnerability in July and as a result the agencies were able to rapidly close vulnerabilities that otherwise might have been exploited by the Blaster worm. There are mechanisms that exist for protecting systems. The National Institute of Standard and Technology [NIST], recommends that the agencies implement a patch management program, harden all hosts appropriately, deploy antivirus software and detect and block malicious code and configure the network perimeter to deny all traffic that is not necessary. As part of the statutory responsibility under FISMA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology will publish in September draft guidelines for incident handling. The guidelines will discuss how to establish and maintain an effective incident reporting and response program with an emphasis on incident detection, analysis, prioritization and containment. The guidelines will include recommendations for handling certain types of incidents and the distribution of denial of service attacks and malicious code infections. Last, the problems presented by the patching systems. Patch management is an essential part of any agency's information security program and requires a significant investment in time and effort. Agencies must carefully follow predefined processes in order to successfully remediate system vulnerabilities across the enterprise. A number of agencies utilize automated tools to push the patches to the desktop. The automation of the patch management process is significantly easier when the agency maintains a standardized software configuration. At the present, 47 agencies subscribe to FedCIRC's PADC capability. This service validates and quickly distributes corrective patches for known vulnerabilities. In closing, OMB is committed to a Federal Government with resilient information systems. Worms and viruses must not be able or allowed to significantly affect agency business processes. OMB will continue to work with the agencies, Congress and GAO to ensure that appropriate countermeasures are in place to reduce the impact of malicious code. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Our next witness is John Malcolm. Mr. Malcolm is currently a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice, where his duties include overseeing the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, the Domestic Security Section and the Office of Special Investigations. Pretty robust portfolio. An honors graduate of Columbia College and Harvard Law School, Mr. Malcolm served as a law clerk to judges on both the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. For 7 years Mr. Malcolm was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Atlanta, GA, where he was assigned to the Fraud and Public Corruption Section. Mr. Malcolm also served as an Associate Independent Counsel in Washington, DC, investigating fraud and abuse at HUD. Prior to rejoining the Department of Justice in August 2001, Mr. Malcolm was a partner at the Atlanta law firm of Malcolm & Schroeder, LLP. Thank you for sharing your time with us and look forward to your testimony, and you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Malcolm. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to testify about the Department of Justice's ongoing efforts to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure from the growing problem of Internet borne worms and viruses. Although computer viruses have been around for a long time, the ubiquity of Internet access and household ownership of computers in the United States have manifestly increased the deleterious impact of viruses and worms on our critical infrastructure and on our daily lives. It seems that nearly every week we learn the name of a new computer virus or worm that exploits flaws in commonly used software and quickly spreads through the Internet. Some of these, like the Blaster worm, make the front pages of newspapers. These viruses and worms are merely the tip of the iceberg. They are just the ones that receive the most public attention. Hundreds more are released every year, posing a daily challenge to those who are responsible for protecting networks and investigating network attacks. The effect of these viruses and worms should not be underestimated. For example, in the United States, the Slammer worm shut down the automatic teller machine system and caused significant transportation delays when electronic ticketing used for airline travel was affected. The Blaster worm and its variants have affected hundreds of thousands of computers. Moreover, since the Internet is seamless and borderless, the harmful impact of worms and viruses is not limited to our country but affects countries across the world. Clones or new variants of malicious codes continue to crop up, raising concerns that more damaging variants are right around the corner. In many cases succeeding generations of viruses and worms will build on its capabilities adding additional harmful pay loads. The worldwide damage to computers and data as well as the productive time lost as the result of worms and viruses is measured in the millions and by some estimates in the billions of dollars. This damage has an undeniable adverse effect on important sectors of our economy and potentially undercuts the security of our Nation's critical infrastructure. The Department of justice has devoted significant resources to investigating and prosecuting persons who release malicious codes on the Internet. These efforts have met with some success. It bears mentioning, however, that tracking the sources of worms and viruses on the Internet is difficult and presents unique challenges to investigators because of the speed with which programs are spread and fundamental characteristics of computer networks, particularly in peer to peer network applications. It is difficult to determine precisely where an outbreak begins since simultaneous file transfers can occur in computers literally throughout the world. Although tracking the sources of computer worms and viruses is difficult, the Department of Justice is fully committed to effectively investigating such attacks. The Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section helps coordinate investigations of computer crimes of all sorts, including virus and worm attacks. These prosecutors in turn train and work with computer hacking and intellectual property units and computer and telecommunications coordinators in each of the 93 U.S. Attorneys offices across the country. Together this network of prosecutors working with law enforcement agents from the Secret Service and the FBI and using important tools provided by the Patriot Act provide an integrated approach to addressing computer crime. Because the perpetrators of offenses may live in other countries, the investigations involve an international component that draws upon the Department's contacts with law enforcement counterparts abroad. Indeed, international cooperation is a foundation of the Department strategy for combating cyber crimes, including worms and viruses. Our efforts are rewarded whenever evidence is obtained from foreign countries that further domestic investigations or when we are able to furnish similar assistance to other countries. In addition to international outreach, Department attorneys and agencies regularly meet with industry, trade groups and State and local law enforcement officials in order to improve communication. The Department of Justice pursues a message of a culture of security where both individual users and corporations view computer security as a key component for successful computing experience. Experience sadly teaches us that much of the damage to our computer networks is caused by teenagers and young adults armed with free hacking tools, plenty of time and too little moral teaching about how to use computers and how not to use computers. Therefore, the Department has also pursued educational programs directed to youth, their teachers and parents. We describe the program as cyber ethics. In fact, CCIPS, in an article authored by the section chief, has published an article dealing with cyber ethics in the current issue of Newsweek. The Department of Justice continues to make progress in its battle against computer crime and intellectual property theft. Recognizing the challenges ahead, we look forward to continued success in our efforts. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared statement. I look forward to getting your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Malcolm follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.045 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.046 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.047 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.048 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.049 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.050 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.051 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.052 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.053 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.054 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.055 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.056 Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much and thank all of you for your adherence to our time restrictions. At this time I will introduce the ranking member of the subcommittee, the distinguished gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Clay. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, especially for calling this hearing and my thanks to the witnesses who have taken the time to be with us today and share their expertise. Computer bugs like worms and viruses are one more example of the complexity of the world we live in. On the other hand, they are one more example of the frailty of human beings and the difficulty of legislating appropriate behavior. Many worms and viruses we have seen are nothing more than exuberance of youth experimenting with newly found freedoms and skill. As has always been the case, the pranks of youth can have consequences well beyond their capability to understand those consequences. Last week, the FBI arrested a Minnesota high school senior and charged him with intentionally causing and attempting to cause damage to computers protected under Federal law. He faces a $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison. This young man was so naive that he built into his computer bug a direct link to his own computer. Catching him was not difficult. However, the damage done was real. The worm attack he participated in forced shutdowns of computer systems at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, the Minnesota Department of Transportation and part of 3M facilities, including a plant in Hutchinson. Unfortunately, most hackers are not as naive as this Minnesota teenager nor as benign. One of the earliest publicly documented cases of hacking was in 1988 at the Lawrence Berkley Lab. Cliff Stone, an astronomer turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkley Lab, was alerted to the presence of an unauthorized user in the inner system by a 75-cent accounting error. His investigations eventually uncovered a spy ring that was breaking into government computers stealing sensitive military information. We are faced with developing public policy that recognizes both the exuberance of youth and the real threat to our government and corporations by those who seek to do us harm. One element of that public policy must be a renewed attention to preventing these attacks. Mr. Chairman, I will not go through this entire statement, but I think you have indicated that you are working on legislation that would encourage corporate America to do a better job of securing their computers, and I look forward to working with you on that legislation. The problems faced by corporations are much like those facing the Federal Government and we should work together to solve those problems, and I will submit the entirety of my statement in the record. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.057 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.058 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.059 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2654.060 Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Clay, and without objection your entire statement will be included in the record. And at this time I recognize the distinguished vice chair of the subcommittee, the former Secretary of State of the great State of Michigan, Ms. Miller. Mrs. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize for being late this morning. I had an opportunity to speak on the floor about the second anniversary of the horrific attacks on our Nation. I certainly appreciate you holding the hearing today and with the recent computer virus attacks on our Nation's information infrastructure the importance of this hearing is undeniable, timely and certainly appropriate. And with three panels testifying, I will be very brief in my opening statement. The focus of today's hearing is to examine what steps are being taken to protect the information infrastructure, both the public and the private levels, from the spread of viruses. And we in the Federal Government certainly have the responsibility of protecting our citizens and ensuring that the infrastructure individuals and businesses rely on is secure. In addition, the government must protect its own systems in order to function efficiently and effectively and this dual responsibility makes the task facing the Federal Government particularly challenging. In April of this year testimony was submitted by Robert Dacey of the GAO to the subcommittee citing a November 2002 cyber attack that affected both private and government networks and caused $900,000 in damage to computers. This is obviously a significant figure. And if a large scale cyber attack were implemented not only would the damage caused to computers be considerable but the additional financial loss and damage to the physical infrastructure could seriously affect the operations of our Nation. And actually we in the House of Representatives have firsthand knowledge of how potentially devastating these viruses can be. The recent Blaster and the SoBig virus attacks of just a few weeks ago nearly crippled the House e-mail network by overloading service with a complex array of erroneous messages. Fortunately, the combined efforts of the House Information Resources and the systems administrators and the Members' offices limited the extent of damage that the virus creators had likely hoped for. In fact, these attacks likely inhibited our Nation's ability to adequately respond to the vast power outage experienced by the eastern half of our Nation. I certainly shudder at the thought of what could happen to everyday businesses if a successful virus or worm crippled our Nation's power grids or financial networks, the Internet, government networks or any other infrastructure that we rely so heavily on. Viruses are a new weapon of attack for those who wish to do harm to this great Nation. The creators of these weapons are terrorists, quite frankly, cyber terrorists who want to disrupt our way of life and to cause considerable harm to our economy and infrastructure. And as with the terrorists that we are fighting with conventional means, these cyber terrorists are using the freedoms that we hold dear against us. They can unleash an attack on our soil from anywhere in the world, and we must be prepared. Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this important hearing. Certainly protecting our Nation's information infrastructure must be a top priority of the Congress. Thank you. Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much, Mrs. Miller. We will get to the questions. Mr. Hale, what percentage of the Federal Government had already downloaded the patch for Blaster prior to its release? Mr. Hale. Mr. Chairman, I don't have the exact figure with me. It is safe to say in the approximately 4 weeks between the time the vulnerability was announced by Microsoft and the advisories from FedCIRC were issued the vast majority of agencies had downloaded the patches, and I will if given the opportunity try to provide you a more measured answer in writing. Mr. Putnam. What percentage of the Federal Government subscribes to FedCIRC's program? Mr. Hale. All Federal agencies receive advisories from FedCIRC, the PADC program in specific; 47 Federal agencies are subscribing to PADC. But PADC is just one part of an agency's patch management strategy. And many agencies have other methods of getting their patches, testing them and applying them. The information the advisories provided by FedCIRC go to all agencies. Mr. Putnam. So then, Mr. Lorentz, how many different options are utilized by the various agencies to handle patch management? Sounds like some contract with the private sector. Some do it internally. Some subscribe to PADC. So we've got a lot of different patches to doing that. Mr. Lorentz. There are different approaches. We do not dictate which method that they use. As part of our FISMA oversight, we do require them to have specific plans, risk mitigation, patch management. We are soon to get the annual FISMA reports on September 22nd on that. But the important issue here, as you can tell from the testimony of everyone here, is that the only way we're protected is if all the dots are connected, the configuration management, the patch management, the management oversight to make sure those processes are implemented as appropriate, the adherence to the information provided by FedCIRC. So there can be variation in the tools, but there cannot be variation in the expected outcome or how those dots are connected in order to mitigate the problem. Mr. Putnam. Mr. Malcolm, you mentioned a number of issues about the law enforcement approach to computer security. How many people have actually served time in jail for releasing malicious code, worms and viruses? Mr. Malcolm. There are a couple of instances that immediately come to mind. One was Mafia Boy in the United States who was actually prosecuted in Canada. He ended up getting a sentence. There was David Smith, who was arrested and charged and successfully prosecuted for releasing the Melissa virus. I believe he got a 20-month term of imprisonment. I would add in that regard the U.S. Sentencing Commission is reevaluating the guidelines as they apply to these sorts of offenses and we expect significant increases. There have been other perpetrators who have been identified of course. Mr. Parsons was alleged to have--he has only been charged. He is presumed to be innocent. I don't know if convicted of those offenses what kind of prison term he would get. I can get back to you with a more precise answer as to that. Mr. Putnam. We have heard testimony that there are hundreds of viruses per year and millions or maybe even into the billions of damage done. Is there a different attitude or is there a different approach about cyber crimes than there is about other types of crimes? Has our sentencing guidelines, our judicial system, our laws, our legislative branch not kept up with the technology that can promulgate new types of threats? Mr. Malcolm. In terms of keeping up with the laws obviously emerging technologies present all kinds of problems for law enforcement, and so we need to constantly reevaluate the state of our laws. And USA Patriot Act, one of the provisions provides now for nationwide service of process of pen trap orders and an explicit recognition. The pen trap orders apply to noncontent interceptions over the Internet. That is an important step in conducting these sorts of investigations. I am not going to suggest that it is going to be the last such step that is necessary. It's certainly true that as these worms and viruses become more sophisticated and proliferate at a greater rate, the potential damage is real. I think historically there has been a perception that crimes taking place in the physical world are somehow more serious than crimes taking place over the cyber world. I believe that perception is rapidly breaking down, and I expect the prosecutions and sentences to increase. Mr. Putnam. Mr. Pethia, Carnegie Mellon has done much more work on this than anyone. I would like you to comment on this different attitude. When we had conversations with the private sector when I was in Silicon Valley, the analogy is always used that people rattle their door knobs and rattle their locks thousands of times per day depending on which firm it is. Obviously you have high profile targets in the IT world and some are lower. But some are getting thousands of door rattlings per day and they choose not to report it. They don't want to give any uneasiness to shareholders or to consumers, so they just accept it as part of this Internet culture, and it results in hundreds of true viruses per year. Is there a different attitude about the Internet and crime and consequences? Mr. Pethia. I don't know about different attitude, but I sense a certain complacency, that people have become so accustomed to the problem and are often so overwhelmed with the problem, so unable on their own to change some of the root causes of the problem, that they've simply chosen to live with it as best they can. You're right, many don't report the attacks, but, again, many are so trivial and so common that if you were to report them, it's not clear what anyone would do with all of that data. In fact, separating the wheat from the chaff, the serious attacks from the trivial, has become an increasing challenge for all of us who do any kind of instant response. Buried in all of this are the serious attacks like the Blasters and the SoBigs and the people who are intent to do malicious damage. But, I think the widespread recognition is that the problem's here and it's serious, but I think individuals don't know what they can do above and beyond putting controls in place in their own organizations. Mr. Putnam. You don't think that there's necessarily a different attitude about it? Mr. Pethia. I think it's more an attitude of complacency and acceptance and just frustration over not knowing what steps that they can take as individual organizations or as individuals to make a difference. Mr. Putnam. Have you ever heard of something called a Black Hat convention? Mr. Pethia. Sure. Mr. Putnam. What is that? Mr. Pethia. There are a number of different conferences. There are two that are typically held every year about people who talk about the Black Hat conference, or people who at one time wore black hats, they broke into and attacked computer systems. That conferences is now typically attended by white hats and not black hats, but they talk about weaknesses in software. They talk about what can be done to improve the situation. They talk about how do we exploit some of these problems so they recognize very much how widespread and serious this problem is, and in their own ways they try to take steps to get corrections out to the world. Mr. Putnam. What percentage of those who are attempting to hack into computers and exploit code vulnerabilities, what percentage of them are bright, capable teenagers seeing what they can do, and what percentage of them are malicious? What percentage are based offshore, and what percentage are based domestically? Mr. Pethia. Those are good questions. I wish we had answers to those. You know, we all have our guesses, but I don't know of anyone who's done any detailed studies about what's called the Internet underground, what the composition of that culture is or even what the economy is. There's an underground economy that's growing, that trades in things like account names and passwords and Social Security numbers that are pirated and drivers' license numbers that are pirated, and I don't think any of us really has a good understanding of what that culture is or how big it is or how many different kinds of people play in it. One thing that is really clear is that it is literally child's play to break into many of the systems that we have today, and when a level of skill needed to attack a system is so low, you can expect all kinds of players to come into that arena. Mr. Putnam. When the conventioneers, whether they're wearing black hats or white hats, when they come together in the good of their heart, talk about ways to improve the system and draw attention to different software companies' vulnerabilities, do they ever ask for money or credit or acknowledgment or anything in exchange for disclosing that information? Mr. Pethia. There certainly are cases where these individuals have tried to extort money from vendors in order to not publicly disclose patches or vulnerabilities in their products. We've certainly seen cases where individuals have tried to extort organizations because they've uncovered weaknesses in their operational systems and have expected money in return not to make that public or to exploit those vulnerabilities in some way. So there is a maliciousness there in some cases. Mr. Putnam. Mr. Malcolm, do you have any other comments about the source and origin and nature of these hackers? Are they primarily international, domestic, teens, professionals? Mr. Malcolm. I think you can really break that down into different categories in that you have a core group of committed, highly sophisticated hackers who come up with sophisticated worms and viruses, and then unfortunately what they do frequently is there are chat rooms and Internet sites, news groups in which hackers communicate, and literally somebody who develops a very sophisticated hacking tool can put it out there so that so-called script kiddies, unsophisticated people who just happen to go to that site, can then utilize that tool. So the level of sophistication can vary dramatically among hackers, and because these tools are made available on the Internet, lots of people can then implement them to cause damage. I think that because the Internet is borderless and seamless, and there are people who are hell-bent on destruction and technically savvy around the world, you have perpetrators who are domestic and perpetrators who are international. Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much. Mr. Clay. The Chair recognizes. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Let me ask any of the three, Mr. Dacey, Hale, and Lorentz: Did the Department of Homeland Security collaborate effectively with Microsoft and the antivirus companies in the Department's effort to issue advisories? And you can start, Mr. Lorentz. Mr. Lorentz. In our view, the proof is in the results. The problems were, for the most part, in general, mitigated, and there was two pieces of that. First of all was getting the information out about the remediation, which they did, and then was really following up and holding the agencies accountable on our behalf, to make sure what the implementation was and reporting that back, and we did that in a manner so that we could share what people's experiences were. So, in our view, it was in both of these incidents that we've had recently they did a find job. Mr. Putnam. Thank you. Mr. Dacey, anything to add? Mr. Dacey. In terms of that, I'd just like to add one thing. We did do some analysis and gathered information with respect to the two vulnerabilities, the Microsoft RPC and the Cisco, and in those cases there was a fairly active discussion and reporting that took place on those two. As Mr. Lorentz indicated, for those two specifically, which were deemed critical, there were separate teleconferences and data requests that were sent out to agencies to ask, you know, what they had done and whether or not they had patched their systems in response to them. I think that is a process which has taken place, I believe, on a few of the occasions prior to this, but I know that there is some opportunity there which would be acknowledged to improve that process, to make sure that people have been communicated to in a rapid manner by standardizing processes and procedures for that communication to occur. But I would also defer to Mr. Hale, who could probably speak more to the specifics of those interactions. Mr. Clay. Great. Mr. Hale. Yes, sir. I appreciate the remarks of my colleagues, and I just wanted to point out that those, as well as the Cisco vulnerability, the IOS vulnerability that has occurred in the past 3 months has been the major events in cyber incidents that have occurred since the formation of the national Cybersecurity Division, and so those are indicative of the kind of coordination and collaboration that this Division has started to do and intends to build on to improve not only the information-sharing among the Federal agencies, but also with the critical infrastructure protection community. Mr. Clay. Let me ask you, Mr. Hale, in creating the Homeland Security Department, Congress moved the Federal Computer Response Team from GSA to Homeland Security. How has this move affected that group? Did anyone leave the Agency, rather than move, as we saw with some other agencies, and did the move affect the group's ability to respond to any of the more recent attacks? Mr. Hale. The effect was entirely positive, sir. The FedCIRC was under GSA, had a focus on the security of Federal agencies in providing a service to Federal agencies, our customer base, and thanks to the provisions of FISMA, Federal Information Security Management Act, FedCIRC was able to remain focused on that mission and continue to provide our services to our customers. We didn't lose any staff members as a result of going to the Department of Homeland Security; in fact, recruiting to fill our vacancies became increasingly easier because there were a lot of people who were very interested in becoming part of our efforts to help cybersecurity and the Federal agencies, and by joining forces with the National Infrastructure Protection Center and the other elements of NIAP, we've actually improved our ability to gather information and disseminate information to the customer base. Mr. Clay. Let me ask you, Mr. Malcolm, recent viruses and worms, such as Code Red, Nimbda, and Slammer, have brought large portions of the Internet to a halt, caused extensive expenses and lost revenue, and consumed the attention of tens of thousands of computer security professionals, computer network administrators and users. These are serious crimes. Have law enforcement officials found and arrested the individual responsible for these viruses and worm attacks? Mr. Malcolm. They've also consumed the time and attention of a lot of dedicated law enforcement agents. Of course, the Department doesn't comment about ongoing investigations; however, I think it is safe to say that with each of the worms and viruses you have identified, those are all matters of ongoing investigation in which we work cooperatively with our international counterparts. We have some successes, as with the criminal complaint that's been filed in the variant ``B'' of the Blaster worm, but I think it is safe to say that there is a lot more work to be done, and unfortunately, we not only have to act retroactively, but because these worms and viruses come out weekly, we have to react prospectively as well. Mr. Clay. Are the individuals who are responsible for these attacks, are they still at large today? Mr. Malcolm. Other than those who have been arrested either here or overseas by international counterparts, yes, they're still at large, unless they've died. Mr. Clay. And you work with international law enforcement, too? Mr. Malcolm. Twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week. Mr. Clay. How many have you arrested out of the viruses that I named, the three that I named, Code Red, Nimbda and Slammer? Mr. Malcolm. I don't know the answer to that question. I believe they are all matters of ongoing investigation. I'm not sure off the top of my head of any arrests in those particular cases, but I can go back and check, and if there's anything that's a matter of public information, I'd be happy to furnish it. Mr. Clay. Would you share that with us? Mr. Malcolm. If that's public information, I certainly will. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's all. Mr. Putnam. Thank you. Mrs. Miller. Mrs. Miller. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll just ask a couple of questions here, but I think the nature of my questions are reiterating what all the committee members are talking about here and what is really happening as far as the attitude that our Nation has and our Justice Department, our law enforcement has toward these cyberhackers. You know, I was following here in the papers recently where the recording industry has filed all these lawsuits against the file sharers. I know 200 lawsuits or whatever. Obviously, that's not really terrorism, unless you're a recording star, you're losing all this money, right? But I was interested in the response of these college kids who are downloading all this music and are getting sued, and they certainly don't care about that. We're going to continue to down--I mean, their attitude is unbelievably cavalier, I think, to breaking the law by using electronic means to do so, and perhaps that is part of the problem we have with these cyberhackers is the attitude of our legislature, of our law enforcement; I mean, are we serious enough? And as you were mentioning, some of the--you know, is it just college kids who are doing this? Obviously not. You've got the whole realm of different kinds of people who are doing the cyberhacking. Have you ever done a psychological profile? I mean, these people are terrorists that are trying to shut down, as I was mentioning, power grids or those kinds of things. That's not downloading music. Let me ask you first about that, as far as the Justice Department. Has there been a psychological profile? I mean, there must be some type of common trait, common element. It would be like an arsonist, right? You see the fire services do profiles of arsonists. These are people that burn buildings and stand back, and there's a whole profile about these kinds of people that perpetrate that kind of crime. Mr. Malcolm. I'm not aware of any psychological profile. I think that perhaps I could contrast the situation with an arson in that unless somebody wants to literally kill somebody inside a building, arsonists tend to be motivated by one purpose, and that is collect the insurance money. In terms of hackers, I think you run the gamut. You obviously have, perhaps, terrorists who are interested in exploiting critical infrastructure for destructive ends. You can have political ``hactivists'' who go on to deface Web pages of something that they are protesting. You have sophisticated hackers who take pleasure in trying to stay one step ahead of the technological development of law enforcement, who take pleasure in their ability to outwit law enforcement by masking their activities. And you also have, as I say, these script kiddies who are more or less with respect to their use of the computers who were out there on a lark. They all cause harm of varying degrees. We take them all seriously. Mrs. Miller. Let me just ask one other question in regard to the Patriot Act. You mention the Patriot Act, and the Patriot Act, of course, there's been a lot of consternation talked about the Patriot Act of whether or not privacy--a lot of privacy advocates are concerned about how the Patriot Act is being implemented, how you are identifying and apprehending culprits. I'm a supporter of the Patriot Act, and I'm just wondering how that particular tool has assisted the Justice Department in our law enforcement, and are a lot of these concerns being raised by the Patriot Act impeding your ability to prosecute, apprehend people, identify them, etc.? How is the Patriot Act helping you? Mr. Malcolm. There are several questions in there that kind of cut across a broad swath. Let me respond to the more narrow question, then I can fill in as you would like me to. With respect to hacking investigation, any crime that is taking place online, time is absolutely of the essence. If you can catch somebody while they are in the act or trace their communications either in real time or very shortly thereafter, your odds of catching somebody go up dramatically. Internet service providers don't retain records typically for a very long period of time, and people can very quickly cover their tracks. There are a number of provisions in the Patriot Act that help. There is, one, the hacker trespass exception of the Patriot Act. If somebody breaks into a system, the owner of that system now can give consent to the government to go in and track the activities of that hacker while they are taking place. Certainly the ability to go and get a pen/trap order in one district and use that order to follow the communications from ISP to ISP to ISP, to get those records frozen as quickly as possible, has proven of invaluable assistance. There are other tools such as nationwide service process for search warrants, subpoenas, all of which have been instrumental in terms of these investigations. Mrs. Miller. Thank you. My last question just to the panel, I suppose. Obviously, the Federal Government has their own role to play in protecting our own information and security systems and that, but I think the public needs to be educated on security, computer security, as well. I'm not sure who I'm asking this question to; any of the panelists, I suppose. Do you have a feeling that there is a role for the Federal Government to play in regards to educating the general public about security safety and how important it is? Mr. Pethia. I'm going to start just by saying I think that's something that I think is a strong role for the Federal Government, and it needs to happen across the country with people of all ages and all occupations. Starting at the elementary school level or where we teach students about computer skills, we need to teach them about computer ethics and the risks of working with computers and interacting in the Internet age. We teach our children how not to get into cars with strangers. We should teach them how not to get into chat rooms with strangers as well. So from there all the way up through the home user, the retired home user, all of these people are vulnerable to some kind of problems because of security or lack of security on the Internet, and I think there is a strong role for the government there to put together that kind of awareness, to put together those kind of training programs and make them broadly available. Mr. Lorentz. I think I would just add I think that our government has a responsibility to our citizens. As part of the management agenda, security is clearly one of the things we are looking at. It cuts across public and private-sector activity. We do have a role in clearly communicating what's acceptable, what's not, creating that common language, if you will, and it begins with exhibiting the behaviors that we would wish to see. Mr. Hale. I would definitely endorse the statements. In fact, with home computers being connected and always on, it's nothing short of a patriotic duty to maintain the security of your home computer because it can be used to attack other computers by other people. Mrs. Miller. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mrs. Miller. Mr. Malcolm, are there differences among nations in the laws regarding cybercrimes, and are there other nations who have particularly more effective means of enforcing them and have a greater success rate in prosecution, and are there certain countries that are more or less helpful to us in investigative work? Mr. Malcolm. I think the short answer to all of those questions was yes. There are a couple of things that I can say in that regard. One is we cooperated with our international counterparts throughout the world in terms of drafting the now--well, it hasn't been ratified in this country, but the now implemented accounts in the Europe Cybercrime Convention. One of the beauties of the cybercrime convention in addition to encouraging international cooperation is that it mandates signatory countries to update their substantive and procedural laws with respect to computer hacking offenses, which would include worms and viruses. Mr. Putnam. Updates them to presumably a certain standard? Mr. Malcolm. That's right. Mr. Putnam. And are we already at that standard in the United States? Mr. Malcolm. We're constantly retinkering, but, yes, we try to maintain the highest standard that we can. We work cooperatively with Congress in that endeavor. And I would add that the Department of Justice, although not uniquely--the Department--the State Department certainly, too--goes overseas and works with legislators and law enforcement officers in other countries to try to keep their laws updated as well. From other entities, such as the G-8, there is a high-tech unit that's called the 24/7 network in which we are able to communicate with law enforcement counterparts in these fast- breaking investigations on a moments notice, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are 30 countries that are members of the high-tech 24/7 network. We're encouraging other countries to join. Some countries have better facilities, training, more money to devote to this effort than other countries, but we're encouraging all of them to stay current. Mr. Putnam. But you're not aware of any one particular area of the world that is a source of more hacking attempts than another? Mr. Malcolm. The answer to that question, with respect to Internet piracy, with respect to hacking, I don't know the answer to that question, Congressman. Mr. Putnam. Mr. Pethia, do you? Mr. Pethia. No, not that's been sustained over any long period of time. For a while, there were a number of viruses that for some reason came out of Bulgaria, and you see short periods of time where you'll see an increase of activity from some geographic area, but nothing that I know of that's been sustained over a long period of time. Mr. Putnam. We may hear more about this in later panels. For the OMB, how long does it take, because everyone has different patch management systems--are you able to measure how long it takes for all of the computers to download the patch when a particular vulnerability is released and the patch is also then released? Do you know when everyone has taken advantage of it? Mr. Lorentz. I can answer the more management aspect of that and later get into the technical, because they basically act as our agent in that. But we literally are advised of the vulnerability, we call attention to the vulnerability. FedCIRC makes the agency aware of what the remediation of the patch is, and then we specifically set a time to get back to monitor the adherence to the remediation. And it's in the last two incidents that's exactly what we did, and I would feel quite sure that FedCIRC probably has some cycle time issues that they can look at in terms of how long it actually takes, but, you know, there's two aspects to all of this. The most significant aspect is the management aspect, and that is holding people accountable once they know, and it's mutually accountable to CIOs as well. Once they know that there is an incursion, that the patch has to be applied, and that there's accountability to apply, then there's the obviously technical nature of things, and there's a number of technical capabilities that are equally effective, but I would pass it to Larry on the cycle time question. Mr. Hale. For the 47 subscribers of patch C, we can tell when they download, but even that is--can be a misleading statistic, because one download can serve thousands of computers, and an agency may download one time and take care of their whole enterprise with that. So we've tried developing metrics with industry with the software manufacturers, and that's the constant refrain is you can't measure how many computers have been inoculated by a single download, but it's the best thing we've got is to tell that agencies are downloading the patches. Now, with the patch C system, agencies can also--once they've inoculated their systems, they can enter in the report and say--it requires a manual entry, but say that we've completed 90 percent or we've completed 99 percent or 100 percent of computers affected by this vulnerability, so there's a method built in for reporting back. Mr. Putnam. Mr. Malcolm, if someone were to break into Coca Cola's headquarters in Atlanta and go into the office and steal the recipe for Coca Cola, what would be a ballpark estimate assuming they were arrested and convicted, what type of consequence would they face for that? Mr. Malcolm. Mr. Chairman, there are a lot variables that would go into answering that question. Mr. Putnam. Ballpark. I'm not a judge. Mr. Malcolm. Well, in the interest of trademark infringement, theft, I would estimate statutory penalties at 10 years or so, depending on whether or not the person has a prior record. That would obviously affect their sentencing guidelines. There are just too many variables for me to answer that question, without having a guideline book in front of me, but obviously the factors are what are the charges, what is the severity of the loss, what is the person's past criminal record? Mr. Putnam. Well, what would it be if they hacked into Coca Cola's computer system and downloaded the secret recipe? Mr. Malcolm. Same answer: You would have all sorts of variables as to whether or not they abused a position of trust, what was the damage that they cased. It could obviously be, in the case of Coca Cola, a major company, a major loss, a significant period of time. Mr. Putnam. Would it be significantly different than had they physically taken it? Mr. Malcolm. There are different guidelines factors that would take into account the fact that a computer was used, and special skills were used, and, depending on who this person was, whether or not they abused the position of trust. There are, under the sentencing guidelines--there are just too many individual case-specific factors for me to give you an accurate answer to your question. I think it is safe to say that if this was a major product and caused a serious loss, I would expect the dollar figure to be high, and that will dramatically increase the sentence since the major factor that is taken into account by the sentencing guidelines is the loss to the victim. Mr. Putnam. OK. There are hundreds of viruses released every year, according to the testimony of this panel. The damages range into the billions, according to your testimony. Mr. Malcolm. Yes. Mr. Putnam. If you could only recall two arrests, two convictions, two jail times--you mentioned David Smith and one other. Now, I asked, what's the source of the threat? Well, we really don't know. Is it foreign or domestic? Well, we really don't know. That seems to reinforce a premise that cybercrime is treated vastly different than some other crime that caused billions in damage and shut down power grids and shut down departments of transportation and threatened security systems within and without the government. It would suggest that there is a different approach, a different attitude, a different level of concern about cybercrime. Would you agree or disagree with that? Mr. Malcolm. I would reject that implication totally. There are, of course, other instances in which perpetrators had been identified; for example, the fellow in the Philippines who promulgated and released the ILOVEYOU virus. I would also say that there are--you know, the Department of Justice is well aware, as is the Department of Homeland Security, that cybervulnerabilities are among the most critical problems that we have and could have a dramatic impact in terms of protecting our critical infrastructure. These are unusually complicated investigations in which very sophisticated people are very good at covering their tracks. To somehow suggest that just because there are fewer public arrests out there in the media, that this is not an absolutely high, high, high priority at the Department of Justice would be a completely wrong assumption to make. Mr. Putnam. OK. I take it at your word. Any other questions from the subcommittee members? Very well. We will dismiss panel one and seat panel two as quickly as possible. Thank you very much, gentlemen, for your input, and those of you who can, we would encourage you to stay around and listen to the private sector comments as well. [Recess.] Mr. Putnam. Very well. The subcommittee will reconvene. I've asked panel two to rise and please be sworn in. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Putnam. Note, for the record, all the witnesses responded in the affirmative. We appreciate you being seated as quickly as possible, and we will move straight to your testimony. I would ask that you be as good about maintaining our 5-minute rule as the first panel was. Our first witness is Mr. Gerhard Eschelbeck, overseeing Qualys' engineering and operation. Gerhard Eschelbeck is responsible for protecting over 1,100 corporate networks. He's an internationally recognized security and distribution systems expert and was recently recognized as 1 of the 25 most influential CTOs by InfoWorld Media Group. Prior to joining Qualys, Gerhard was senior vice president of engineering for security products at Network Associates; vice president of engineering of antivirus products at McAfee Associates. He was a research scientist at the University of Linz, Austria, from which he earned his Master's and Ph.D. degrees in computer science. He has authored many articles and papers and is inventor of numerous patents in the field of network security automation, and is a frequent speaker at networking and security conferences worldwide. Welcome. Glad to have you at the subcommittee, and you're recognized. STATEMENTS OF GERHARD ESCHELBECK, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AND VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING, QUALYS, INC.; CHRISTOPHER WYSOPAL, CO-FOUNDER, ORGANIZATION FOR INTERNET SAFETY AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, @STAKE.INC.; AND KEN SILVA, VICE PRESIDENT, OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, VERISIGN, INC. Mr. Eschelbeck. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to testify about my research on network vulnerabilities. The business of my company gives us a front row seat to new threats against networked computers and communications systems. Qualys provides an automated service over the Web to audit the security of networks. I've just analyzed more than 1.2 million network vulnerabilities found by our virus scanning service during a recent 18-month period. This vast data pool demonstrates that known risks are far more prevalent than anyone has imagined. Analytical data also demonstrates a new breed of automated Internet-borne viruses and worms that mock traditional security defenses. The source of data for my analysis was anonymous results from 1.5 million security audit scans made by organizations worldwide. We learned four themes that are called the laws of vulnerabilities. The law of half-life talks about the fact that it takes an average of about 30 days for organizations to fix 50 percent of their vulnerable systems within enterprises. The law of prevalence talks about the fact that half of the most prevalent and critical vulnerabilities are replaced by new ones each and every year. The law of persistence: Some old vulnerabilities recur due to the deployment of unpatched software as part of new rollouts. The law of exploitation, finally, talks about the fact that 80 percent of the vulnerability exploits are available within 60 days of public announcements. Automating defenses against these threats is crucial, because human-based efforts are not working. In each case of recent damaging strikes, we've had advanced warning; weeks, even months, to prepare for known vulnerabilities, yet attackers were still able to hit hundreds of thousands of PCs and servers. Risks to network and system security are increasing because the triggers are becoming automated, requiring no human action to deliver destructive payloads. Earlier first-generation threats are virus-type attacks, spreading with e-mail and file- sharing. They require human action to trigger, such as opening an infected file attachment. An example would be the most recent SoBig virus. Second-generation threats comprise active worms leveraging system and application vulnerabilities. Penetration occurs without requiring user action. Replication, identification, targeting of new victims are automatic. Blended threats are common, such as incorporating viruses and Trojans. A third generation of threats is now posing trouble. We've already seen the potential for damage. The SQL Slammer worm rapidly hit more than 75,000 homes running Microsoft SQL server, caused major damage worldwide. SQL Slammer was the fastest worm ever, infecting more than 90 percent of the vulnerable systems within 10 minutes. A few days after Microsoft published a DCOM vulnerability in July 2003, Qualys's automated scanning service ranked this security vulnerability as the most prevalent vulnerability ever. Following the laws of vulnerability, Blaster and its derivatives appeared 3 weeks later, infecting more than 100,000 systems per hour at its peak. Urgency's now rising from a shortening discovery/attack cycle. SQL Slammer happened 6 months after discovery; Nimda was 4 months; Slapper was 6 weeks; and Blaster and Nachi came just 3 weeks after news of the vulnerability. Public policy for network securities should strongly encourage the use of automation as an equal force response to automated tools used by attackers. Automating defense strategies include regular security audits of networks and systems, keeping antivirus software up to date, timely patch management, and the ongoing variation of security policy. To summarize, many vulnerabilities linger, sometimes without an end. New attacks are capable of spreading faster than any possible human response effort. Protecting our networks is a continuous process of eliminating critical vulnerabilities on the regional, national and international scale. In conclusion, public policy should demand timely detection and a rapid application of remedies providing protection from these threats. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions. Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much, Mr. Eschelbeck.

Our next witness is Chris Wysopal. Mr. Wysopal is director of research and development at @stake.Inc, managing @stake's pioneering research in application security. His primary focus is building products to assure and test software security. Working with vendors and the general public, Mr. Wysopal was also responsible for managing @stake's vulnerability research and disclosure process. His career in the information security industry has spanned over 13 years where he has held positions in industry while also serving as regular advisor to various government agencies. Prior to joining @stake, Mr. Wysopal was senior security engineer at GTE Internetworking, formerly known as BBN, where he was the most senior engineer on the IT security staff. In addition, Mr. Wysopal is coauthor of the award-winning password-auditing program, LC3, which is used by more than 2,000 government, military and corporate organizations worldwide. And, finally, he is a founding member of the Organization for Internet Safety. Welcome to the subcommittee. We look forward to your testimony. Mr. Wysopal. Chairman Putnam and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today on the subject of protecting the Nation's computers from viruses and worms. This is a great honor for me. My company @stake consults for the Fortune 1,000, including four of the world's top software companies. We help them build more secure software and secure their infrastructures. I am also a founding member of the Organization for Internet Safety. OIS is a group of software vendors and security companies joined together to produce a process for reporting and responding to new vulnerability information safely. Today I would like to cover three pertinent issues: The software development process, the vulnerability research process, and finally, responsible vulnerability reporting and response. Unfortunately, in less than 72 hours, if an unpatched new computer is connected to the Internet, it will be compromised. This is indicative of the software flaws that affect our information economy. My first point is on software development, the root cause of the problem is software flaws. Every virus or worm takes advantage of a security flaw in the design or implementation of a software program. The flaw can exist almost anywhere inside a program that processes data directly from a network or from a file delivered by an e-mail attachment. This means that practically every software program in the age of the Internet falls into in the category of requiring security quality processes during its development. If these processes are not in place and followed rigorously by the manufacturer, flaws will inevitably creep into the software during development, be discovered, and end up exploited. Automatic patching is a great solution for some computers, but many environments have requirements that don't allow patches to be applied in automatic or even timely manual manner. One of the key problems with patching is the Internet or the network the computer's connected to is the distribution system. This means that a computer needs to be connected to the Internet to be patched. The irony is the Internet is the attack vector that puts the computer at risk. As recent examples of worms demonstrate, reactive solutions are not keeping up with the speed of malicious programs. Many of the flaws found in software after it is shipped to customers are not found by the vendor. Many are found through directed research by vulnerability researchers. These are individuals who investigate the security of software for academic reasons, profit, or mere curiosity. A primary motivation of vulnerability research is altruistic. There aren't any independent or government watchdog groups looking out for the safety of the software--computer users' use. Given this vacuum, researchers feel that someone should test and find vulnerabilities. They feel that every flaw they find and report is another flaw that will be fixed before a malicious person finds and exploits it. In this way, vulnerability researchers can make all computers users more safe. Vulnerability researchers are performing a testing function that should have been done as part of the security quality assurance process by the vendor. Vulnerability researchers think differently than traditional software testers. They think from the perspective of an attacker. The fact that there is a vast amount of software already deployed with latent undiscovered flaws means that we will be dealing with newly discovered vulnerabilities for the foreseeable future. A process for handling new vulnerability information in a timely and safe way is required. There is some debate in the vulnerability research community as to the best way to handle vulnerability information. However, most agree that it is responsible to inform the vendor of the vulnerable product and give them time to create a patch. 4,200 vulnerabilities were tracked by CERT last year. Almost all had patches available when the information became public due to vulnerability researchers informing vendors prior to publicly disclosing. The Organization for Internet Safety has published a process that these flaw-finders can use to report flaws to vendors and for vendors to respond to these reports, sometimes with a patch. The goal of the OIS process is to protect the computer user community as a whole. A balance was struck between the timeliness and reliability of patches and between helping sophisticated users and the majority of users who are unable to help themselves. To conclude, software vendors face challenges building software. Vulnerability researchers can help find the flaws that vendors miss. Both need to come together to handle vulnerability safety. All I ask is a step in this direction."
