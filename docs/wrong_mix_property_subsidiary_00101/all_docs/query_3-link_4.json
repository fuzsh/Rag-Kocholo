        "text": "Preamble\n\nThe ethical obligations of the health information management (HI) professional include the safeguarding of privacy and security of health information; appropriate disclosure of health information; development, use, and maintenance of health information systems and health information; and ensuring the accessibility and integrity of health information.\n\nHealthcare consumers are increasingly concerned about security and the potential loss of privacy and the inability to control how their personal health information is used and disclosed. Core health information issues include what information should be collected, how the information should be managed, who should have access to the information, under what conditions the information should be disclosed, how the information is retained, when it is no longer needed, and how is it disposed of in a confidential manner. All of the core health information issues are addressed in compliance with state and federal regulations, and employer policies and procedures.\n\nEthical obligations are central to the professional's responsibility, regardless of the employment site or the method of collection, storage, and security of health information. In addition, sensitive information (e.g., genetic, adoption, substance use, sexual health, and behavioral information) requires special attention to prevent misuse. In the world of business and interactions with consumers, expertise in the protection of information is required.\n\nPurpose of the American Health Information Management Association Code of Ethics\n\nThe HIM professional has an obligation to demonstrate actions that reflect values. The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) Code of Ethics sets forth these principles. (See also AHIMA Mission, Vision, Values) The code is relevant to all AHIMA members, non-members with the Commission on Certification for Health Informatics and Information Management (CCHIIM) certifications, and students enrolled in a formal certificate or degree granting program directly relevant to the AHIMA Purpose regardless of their professional functions, the settings in which they work, or the populations they serve. These purposes strengthen the HIM professional’s efforts to improve overall quality of healthcare.\n\nThe AHIMA Code of Ethics serves six purposes:\n\nPromotes high standards of HIM practice.\n\nSummarizes broad ethical principles that reflect the profession's core values.\n\nEstablishes a set of ethical principles to be used to guide decision-making and actions.\n\nEstablishes a framework for professional behavior and responsibilities when professional obligations conflict or ethical uncertainties arise.\n\nProvides ethical principles by which the general public can hold the HIM professional accountable.\n\nMentors practitioners new to the field to HIM's mission, values, and ethical principles.\n\nThe code includes principles that are enforceable and aspirational. The extent to which each principle is enforceable is a matter of professional judgment to be exercised by those responsible for reviewing alleged violations of ethical principles.\n\nPrinciples\n\nThe following principles are based on the core values of the American Health Information Management Association and apply to all AHIMA members, non-members CCHIIM certifications, and students.\n\nAdvocate, uphold, and defend the consumer's right to privacy and the doctrine of confidentiality in the use and disclosure of information.\n\nPut service and the health and welfare of persons before self-interest and conduct oneself in the practice of the profession so as to bring honor to oneself, their peers, and to the health information management profession.\n\nPreserve, protect, and secure personal health information in any form or medium and hold in the highest regard health information and other information of a confidential nature obtained in an official capacity, taking into account the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nRefuse to participate in or conceal unethical practices or procedures and report such practices.\n\nUse technology, data, and information resources in the way they are intended to be used.\n\nAdvocate for appropriate uses of information resources across the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nRecruit and mentor students, peers and colleagues to develop and strengthen professional workforce.\n\nRepresent the profession to the public in a positive manner.\n\nAdvance health information management knowledge and practice through continuing education, research, publications, and presentations.\n\nPerform honorably health information management association responsibilities, either appointed or elected, and preserve the confidentiality of any privileged information made known in any official capacity.\n\nState truthfully and accurately one’s credentials, professional education, and experiences.\n\nFacilitate interdisciplinary collaboration in situations supporting ethical health information principles.\n\nRespect the inherent dignity and worth of every person.\n\nAHIMA Code of Ethics Guidelines\n\nViolation of principles in the Code of Ethics does not automatically imply legal liability or violation of the law. Such determination can only be made in the context of legal and judicial proceedings. Alleged violations of the code are subject to a peer review process. Such processes are generally separate from legal or administrative procedures and insulated from legal review or proceedings to allow the profession to counsel and discipline its own members. Although in some situations, violations of the code would constitute unlawful conduct subject to legal process.\n\nGuidelines for ethical and unethical behavior are provided to assist with the interpretation of the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) Code of Ethics. The terms \"shall” and “shall not\" are used as a basis for setting high standards for behavior. This does not imply that everyone \"shall” or “shall not\" do everything that is listed. This concept is true for the entire code. If someone engages in the stated activities, ethical behavior is the standard. The guidelines are not a comprehensive list. For example, the statement \"safeguard all confidential consumer information to include, but not limited to, personal, health, financial, genetic and outcome information\" can also be interpreted as \"shall not fail to safeguard all confidential consumer information to include personal, health, financial, genetic, and outcome information.\"\n\nA code of ethics cannot guarantee ethical behavior. Moreover, a code of ethics cannot resolve all ethical issues or disputes or capture the richness and complexity involved in striving to make responsible choices within a moral community. Rather, a code of ethics sets forth values and ethical principles to which a Health Information Management (HIM) professional can aspire and by which actions can be judged. Ethical behaviors result from a personal commitment to engage in ethical practice.\n\nProfessional responsibilities often require an individual to move beyond personal values. For example, an individual might demonstrate behaviors that are based on the values of honesty, providing service to others, or demonstrating loyalty. In addition, professional values may require promoting confidentiality, facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration, and refusing to participate or conceal unethical practices. Professional values could require a more comprehensive set of values than an individual’s need to be an ethical agent in one’s own personal life.\n\nThe AHIMA Code of Ethics is to be used by AHIMA members, non-members with the Commission on Certification for Health Informatics and Information Management (CCHIIM) certifications, students enrolled in a formal certificate or degree granting program directly relevant to the AHIMA Purposes, and consumers, agencies, organizations, and bodies (such as licensing and regulatory boards, insurance providers, courts of law, government agencies, and other professional groups) that choose to adopt it or use it as a frame of reference. The AHIMA Code of Ethics reflects the commitment of all to uphold the profession's values and to act ethically. Individuals of good character who discern moral questions and, in good faith, seek to make reliable ethical judgments, must apply ethical principles.\n\nThe code does not provide a set of rules that prescribe how to act in all situations. Specific applications of the code must consider the context in which it is being considered and the possibility of conflicts among the values and principles.\n\nHow to Interpret the Code of Ethics\n\nPrinciples and Guidelines\n\nThe following ethical principles are based on the core values of the American Health Information Management Association and apply to all AHIMA members, non-members with CCHIIM certifications, and students enrolled in a formal certificate or degree granting program directly relevant to the AHIMA Purposes. Guidelines included for each ethical principle are a non-inclusive list of behaviors and situations that can help to clarify the principle. They are not meant to be a comprehensive list of all situations that can occur.\n\nAdvocate, uphold, and defend the consumer's right to privacy and the doctrine of confidentiality in the use and disclosure of information.\n\nA health information management professional shall:\n\n1.1. Safeguard all confidential consumer information to include, but not limited to, personal, health, financial, genetic, and outcome information.\n\n1.2.

Protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of professional service. Disclose only information that is directly relevant or necessary to achieve the purpose of disclosure. Release information only with valid authorization from a consumer or a person legally authorized to consent on behalf of a consumer or as authorized by federal or state regulations. The minimum necessary standard is essential when releasing health information for disclosure activities.\n\n1.5. Promote the obligation to respect privacy by respecting confidential information shared among colleagues, while responding to requests from the legal profession, the media, or other non-healthcare related individuals, during presentations or teaching and in situations that could cause harm to persons.\n\n1.6.
