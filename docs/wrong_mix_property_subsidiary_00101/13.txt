Unified Sales and Product Organizations Unleash Full Solutions Portfolio to Empower Customers Across Multiple Industries

VeriSign, Inc. provider of intelligent infrastructure for the networked world, has announced a new business structure designed to better serve its customers next-generation infrastructure needs while simultaneously streamlining the companys operations. The new functional organization replaces the previous business unit structure with a combined sales and services team and an integrated products organization enabling VeriSign to better deliver its broad portfolio of digital infrastructure services to a global customer base.

VeriSign is more than security, more than .com, and more than telecom. Over the past 12 years, we have built the worlds most powerful digital infrastructure that enables and protects more than 25 billion interactions every day, said Stratton Sclavos, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, VeriSign. Today, we take the next step in our evolution. We believe this new organization structure will allow all of our employees to focus on a common goal enabling our customers to accelerate their transformation to the Any Era by helping them bring new services to market more quickly and efficiently.

VeriSigns vision for the Any Era reflects the companys response to the major shift in the way people work, play and live as the worlds interactions move from physical to digital. Consumers are now in charge, and they expect access to information, content, entertainment and commerce any time, anywhere via any channel, network or device. Todays businesses regardless of industry must respond with scalable, reliable and secure network-based services. VeriSigns globally deployed digital infrastructure provides the foundation for many of the most innovative solutions now being delivered by thousands of companies across the globe.

A New Business Structure To Meet Customer Needs

Under the new operating structure, VeriSigns three previous business units VeriSign Security Services (VSS), VeriSign Information Services (VIS) and VeriSign Communications Services (VCS) are now combined to deliver an integrated portfolio through a unified sales and service team across multiple industries. The company will have two main functional units, each led by a VeriSign or industry veteran reporting directly to the CEO:

Sales and Consulting Services: This group will combine VeriSigns multiple sales and consulting functions into one organization, focused on global accounts, strategic partnerships and worldwide channel relationships. The group will be aligned by vertical industry to focus on specialized customer needs and solutions delivery, and will also include the companys in-market consulting services, Business Development and Global Channels teams. The group will be led by Executive Vice President John Donovan, formerly CEO of InCode Wireless, which was acquired by VeriSign in November 2006.

Products and Marketing: This group is responsible for the development, marketing, delivery and support of all VeriSign products and solutions to businesses of all sizes. The organization includes all facets of product management, product development, marketing and customer support, as well as, a new innovation team chartered with looking at longer term product line synergies and emerging market trends. Core product teams will work closely with newly dedicated solutions marketing teams to address market needs in media and entertainment, telecom, financial services, healthcare, retail and public sector. The group will be led by Executive Vice President Mark McLaughlin, a 7-year VeriSign veteran and formerly the head of VeriSign Information Services.

VeriSigns new structure will make us a better business partner, and we value the feedback our customers have provided throughout the process, said Sclavos. Whats really exciting is that we can unleash our full portfolio to deliver more integrated solutions that help our customers capitalize on their biggest opportunities across multiple industries.

In addition to VeriSigns new customer-facing organizations led by McLaughlin and Donovan, VeriSign has added two new senior roles reporting to CEO Stratton Sclavos:

Ari Balogh, a 9-year VeriSign veteran, has taken on the dual role of Chief Technology Officer and head of global product development, charged with working both internally and externally to accelerate product innovation and push forward best practices in technology and architecture. Balogh was previously executive vice president of VeriSign Operations and Infrastructure.
