        "text": "The Taliban takeover has crushed the dreams women have been working towards for the last two decades. The brave and resilient journalists risked their lives over the years to report the war crisis and Taliban atrocities. They have shown courage when faced with fear, intimidation, and threats. A tragic number of these journalists lost their lives, were severely injured in attacks, or were threatened with violence. Taliban spokesman, Zabilullah Mujahid, announced a committee would be created to investigate issues of the media, but past incidents still haunt women journalists and human rights activists. Several have reported intimidation and threats under the Taliban's regime.\n\nThe Coalition For Women In Journalism continues to amplify Afghan journalists and activists through our platform and social media campaigns. We have reported several cases anonymously to highlight the plight of Afghan women journalists who are stuck in this crisis. Khadija Ashrafi, general manager of Bakhtar News Agency, is one of the latest victims of the Taliban's aggression. The Taliban broke into her house on August 17, but luckily she was not home. She had relocated earlier and did not know if the Taliban seized anything from her home.\n\nWahida Faizi, an Afghan journalist, gave an emotional interview to Lyse Doucet at Kabul airport as she prepared to leave. She said while crying, \"They didn't know me. Now if they know me, I believe they will kill me. I must leave my country. I can't live here.\"\n\nAs The Coalition For Women In Journalism continues to raise Afghan women journalists' voices and concerns, we demand the United Nations Security Council and world leaders put more effort into evacuating the vulnerable individuals who have served their country. The journalists, translators, fixers, and humanitarian workers who have, in any capacity, aided western media or human rights organizations can be targeted for their role under the repressive regime. Women journalists feel particularly at risk given the brutal past of the Taliban's attacks against them."
