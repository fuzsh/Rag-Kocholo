        "text": "Happy Africa Freedom Day from WWF Zambia! We celebrate Africa Day this year in the context of extraordinary difficulties and at a pivotal moment in African history. Across the continent, several crises are being experienced, including the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant flooding brought on by climate change, and protracted droughts that result in food poverty. Africa needs to withstand these trying conditions and demonstrate its tenacity and will to rise back up, stronger and better. The theme: \"Educate an African Fit for the 21st Century: Building Resilient Education Systems for Increased Access to Inclusive, Lifelong, Quality, and Relevant Learning in Africa,\" is a timely theme that highlights the importance of knowledge in promoting climate resilience and adaptability. Education is key to empowering communities to engage in conservation efforts, understand environmental challenges, and develop innovative solutions to protect our natural resources. By investing in resilient education systems, we ensure that every African has the opportunity to learn about and contribute to sustainability and conservation. Together, we can shape a brighter, more sustainable future for all. Let's continue to educate, inspire, and take action to conserve our precious environment. #WWFZambia #kazasummit #HappyAfricaDay #ImagineaLife\n\nWORKSHOP ON A WHOLE-SCHOOL APPROACH ON CLIMATE CHANGE: EMPOWERING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR A SUSTAINTABLE FUTURE IN NIGERIA - UNESCO We are honored to share that as The POP (Protect Our Planet) Movement #Youth #mentor, the Executive Director of Equity Watch Initiative Dr Chiemezie Atama was privileged to facilitate a Program at United Nations House. This insightful event was in Abuja organized by Nigeria National Commission for UNESCO and UNESCO Abuja region.Titled a Whole-School Approach on climate change: Empowering Educational Institutions for a #Sustainable #future was focused on engaging educational institutions for a better understanding of climate change to spur them to take climate actions. In this program, she present \"Understanding Climate Change: The Science, Impacts and Challenges\" As usual, she leveraged the opportunity to explore the impact of climate change on gender. The vulnerability of Nigeria to climate change particularly those in rural communities (women and girls) due to #extreme #weather #events, #sea #level #rise, #land #degradation, #food #insecurity, #deforestation, #land, #water and #air #pollution among others. No only threaten our #ecosystems, but undermines our #fundamental #rights, #deepens #gender #inequalities and #social #injustice. The #climate #emergency #demands a #holistic #approach that involves #everyone. It calls for a #collective #actions and the #time is #NOW!!!!!! #ActNow\n\nInvited as a speaker by Aurelie Ceinos of IISD , I was thrilled to share a platform with remarkable climate experts, highlighting subnational adaptation actions led by the dynamic youth network, alongside CSOs in Kenya. I shared best practices surrounding vertical integration, emphasizing the vital linkages between local and national levels. The overarching theme of inclusion played a central role, particularly the active participation of women, youth, persons with disabilities and indigenous people. This all unfolded at the Peer Learning Summit (PLS), under the theme of \"Vertical Integration in NAP Processes.\" The event was co-organized by the NAP Global Network and the Government of Kenya. We convened in Kenya from the 11th to the 13th of October 2023. With a team of climate experts from various countries, including Belize, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominican Republic, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Tuvalu, Sao Tome and Principe, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. üåè, we explored current and emerging challenges and opportunities in NAP processes, identified tailored steps for improved vertical integration and emphasized the vital role of civil society and private sector in the journey. The wise words of Eng. @Festus K Ng‚Äôeno, Environment and Climate Change Principal Secretary, resonate deeply with me. He rightly reminds us that our mission should revolve around establishing crucial links between community-driven adaptation initiatives and national-level adaptation goals. Prioritizing systemic transformation through inclusive legislations and policies is our key to success. #ClimateAction #YouthLeadership #VerticalIntegration #NAPProcesses #Sustainability #ClimateChangeAdaptation\n\nIt's incredibly uplifting to witness the passion and commitment of Africa's youth, who are raising their voices and demanding a pivotal role in shaping the future of our continent's climate strategy. At the recently concluded African Youth Climate Assembly 2023 (AYCA23) in Nairobi, the vibrant youth leaders did not just attend; they actively contributed and presented a compelling declaration to notable figures, including Kenya's President William Ruto and African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina. The key highlights of this youth-driven declaration include: ‚Ä¢ Strong advocacy for the swift establishment of a Global Green Bank. ‚Ä¢ An appeal for a New Global Financial Pact with a dedicated focus on youth interests in climate financing. ‚Ä¢ A call to establish a United Nations Youth office right here in Africa. It was heartwarming to see leaders like President Ruto and Dr. Adesina acknowledging the value and potential of African youth. Their endorsement of the youth's call for inclusion in climate-related decision-making processes is a testament to the continent's commitment to its next generation. As we journey towards a greener and more sustainable future, it's critical to invest in the youth. Programs like the Bank's \"Jobs for Youth in Africa\" are exemplary initiatives that have already created 15 million jobs. Such initiatives ensure that the youth are not only participants to fulfil statistical logistics as usually is in the business as usual summits but also the architects of the green transition. The outcomes of the #AYCA23, encapsulated in the youth declaration, will significantly contribute to the Nairobi Declaration, charting out Africa's roadmap to a sustainable green transition. The events at #AfricaClimateSummit are a powerful reminder of what's possible when youth are empowered and entrusted with shaping their future. #YouthForClimate #GreenTransition #FANRPAN #Empowerment #AfricaClimateAction\n\nPana and Narai (Pana and the World; Pana (Leaf) is also a name for girls in Pashto) is the story of a little Afghan schoolgirl who wants to understand the beauty of nature and the increasing shadows over this miracle, mainly caused by human behavior, resulting in a changing climate. Throughout the chapters, she raises questions on the current situation and harmful treatment of nature, discusses the consequences, and tries to suggest solutions to protect the beauty of nature for future generations. Pana and Narai is the first book for kids in Pashto dedicated to the topic of climate change, published by Onai Climate Change (www.onai-climatechange.org)- a non-profit organization established in February 2021, which envisages bringing the issue of climate change and its effects on Afghanistan to the attention of Afghans and the world through #education, #research, and #advocacy. Onai is truly indebted to the author, Mrs. Zarmina Rohi Wardak, who brought up the idea of writing this book and dedicated her time and energy to draft such an excellent piece for Afghan kids to understand climate change and its effects if we do not act responsibly. Onai wants to express its gratitude to Prof. Zalmai Hewadmal for reviewing the book and providing valuable comments, Mr. Himat Abokbakr for the detailed review of the technical aspects, and Lema and Maiwand Hakimzai, who provided the beautiful images with the help of AI- another innovative approach of this book. A special thanks to Mr. Mahmoodi for his continuous support and Mr. Khalid Baha for managing the entire process- from initiation to print and distribution. The distribution will be launched from the end of next in Kabul and the provinces of Afghanistan. At this stage, overall, 1,000 books will be distributed, with a focus on rural areas of the country. The E-book can be downloaded from next week onwards from the Onai website. It is worth noting that the book will be distributed free of charge to ALL Afghan kids! Note: The ‚ÄúPana and Narai ‚Äúbook project was financed entirely by Onai, and all involved individuals worked voluntarily. #climatechange #climateaction #afghanistan #afghanwomen #education UNDP Afghanistan UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) Welthungerhilfe (WHH) UNFCCC UN UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency ADB Publications World Food Programme Save the Children International BBC News Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH Voice of America Deutsche Welle TOLOnews Sana Safi Breshna Omarkhel\n\n#AYCA23: Africa's youth demand greater role in climate action Africa‚Äôs young people are demanding a seat at the table when it comes to climate action. At the African Youth Climate Assembly 2023-AYCA23 in #Nairobi, youth leaders presented a declaration to #Kenya's President William Ruto and African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina calling for greater involvement of youth in #climate policy and financing. The declaration advocates for accelerated establishment of a Global Green Bank and New Global Financial Pact that prioritizes youth interests in climate financing. It also calls for a United Nations Youth office based in Africa. In response, Ruto and Adesina recognized African youth as the continent's biggest asset and supported their demand for more inclusion in #climate decision-making. Ruto highlighted his government's initiatives in smart cities and record education budget to equip youth with skills. Adesina underscored the critical need to invest in youth through initiatives like the Bank's Jobs for Youth in Africa program. ‚ÄúSo far, we have developed 15 million jobs: ten million in the formal sector and five million in the informal sector,‚Äù Adesina said of the program. The youth declaration will feed into the Nairobi Declaration, the key outcome of the #AfricaClimateSummit happening now, which will layout Africa's path to a green transition.

These challenges are amplified by the government's generous ‚ÄòOpen Door‚Äô policy towards refugees. The impact of climate change affects not least #Women&Girls in Uganda who are e.g. tasked with fetching water and cultivating the land. Last week I visited our programme in West Nile and saw how Oxfam and partners through our #Nexus program work on climate mitigation and adaptation in multiple and reinforming sectors and areas, especially targeting women and girls. - Supporting government with greening of the TVET curriculum, provide opportunities for learners to acquire certified green skills training, promoting active citizenship through young people‚Äôs engagement in climate action and advocacy and greening of educational schools through climate smart infrastructure and tree planting. - Investing in climate smart agriculture and resilient livelihoods. - Supporting conflict mediation and resolution between host and refugee populations in relation to disputes around climate impact and access to natural resources such as water and land - Advocating for improved financing of energy and climate change adaptation and mitigation incl. financial tracking and mapping of local climate action needs within education through Participatory Budget Groups‚Äô and their involvement in local budget proceses. #ClimateJustice for all Oxfam Oxfam Novib Oxfam Danmark @Oxfam in uganda @luigi giussani foundation\n\nCLIMATE ADAPTATION IN AFRICA Check out my latest Substack! https://rb.gy/muecdp Just returned from an incredible two-week immersion in Kenya with my family. We explored conservancies in north-central Kenya, the Masai Mara, coastal Mombasa area, and Nairobi. Witnessing the youth protests in Nairobi against economic policies was a stark reminder of the socio-political dynamics at play. A significant focus of my trip was observing how rural Kenyans adapt to climate change, an issue I've explored in other emerging markets like India and Brazil. From solar-powered campsites in Laikipia to the Samburu tribe's ingenious cooling structures and their shift from cows to camels, the resourcefulness and resilience of these communities was on full display. These adaptations, though often piecemeal, offer valuable lessons for us all. However, the persistent tribal affiliations and societal schisms pose challenges to broader, systemic climate adaptation. The history of colonial divide-and-rule tactics perhaps still casts a long shadow, complicating efforts to foster cooperation across communities. As we departed Nairobi, it was encouraging to see that the youth protests seemed less influenced by tribal affiliations, suggesting a potential shift towards a more united approach to addressing challenges. This emerging generation offers hope for overcoming historical divisions and driving collective progress.

During extreme weather such as droughts and floods, women tend to work more to secure household livelihoods. This will leave less time for women to access training and education, develop skills or earn income. The questions I often ask to myself are how do we them fight if we do not have the resources. How do we ask for help when we do not evaluate the gravity of the situation. Or how do we even evaluate the risks if we do not know how to identity them. We need to fight for our rights to a better living ‚ù§Ô∏è Africa Climate Mobility Initiative United Nations Centre de recherche foresti√®re internationale (CIFOR) ClimateChange Education.Org\n\nUganda is a co-convener amongst other 05 countries in the GRF in Geneva, Dec 2023. Meanwhile Uganda as a country has 05 pledges to present (Climate Change and Energy, Localization, Livelihoods and Resilience, Durable Solution and Transition). We today Validated 03 Pledges from Refugee Community of Kyangwali Refugee Settlement: - Livelihoods and Resilience, we will embrace on farm and off farm opportunities to transform from dependency to self-reliance. - Education, we will take responsibilities of taking our children to school and respond to cost sharing. - Climate Change and Energy, will will participate in all measures of environmental protection including tree growing in all available spaces and use other alternative and available biomass for cooking. I pledged to inform the community through Humanitarian Services Action and here, I fulfill. #Share #Giving my take on the Validation"
