        "text": "Why do journalists give up working in news? I read every post I could find by departing journos to understand their reasons. 💸 Insufficient pay – one young reporter describes holding the soles of her shoes in place with rubber bands. 😫 Burnout – exhaustion builds until the moment people literally cannot put in another day's work. This came up a lot post-pandemic. 🏡 Family life – as they reach their 30s and 40s, many cannot conciliate the demands of the never-ending news cycle with those of children 🏃♂️ Mental & physical health – time demands also make it difficult to see friends, develop hobbies or maintain a healthy lifestyle 💔 Moral injury – a loss of pride in the profession and a growing sense of disconnect between the reasons people entered journalism and the way it is actually practiced ☠️ Bad bosses – every item on this list is a sign of a toxic culture, but bad management in particular is the one that will make you leave fast 🪜 Lack of career prospects – those with digital skills in particular feel they quickly reach a ceiling and the upper echelons are not open to them, while other industries offer better progression 🙌 Lack of recognition – bylines and awards only go to reporters, while many toil unseen to put out the news 📈 Lack of innovation – several are frustrated with the glacial pace of the change and the impossibility of getting their ideas heard internally 🎯 Search for impact – some prefer to act directly on the problems they see rather than hope an article makes a difference 😎 Search for a happier environment – for some the doom and gloom of the industry (sorry I'm not helping) is just too much. They want to work in a more optimistic industry. What else did I miss? (All these posts are listed here: https://lnkd.in/djyHEM2a. Do send me any I missed.)\n\nThe RAJAR radio listening figures are out. There’s been a big rise in the number of people listening to the BBC World Service in the UK. The global news network I work on may not be principally aimed at the UK, but it was revealed today that 1.2 million UK adults listen. That’s an increase of 140,000 on a year ago. As one of the presenters of Newsday, the World Service’s breakfast show, I couldn’t be prouder of our dedicated and talented team that work tirelessly to bring the hugely consequential global events we are witnessing to listeners all over the world, including here in the UK. If you’re a listener, thank you. If you’re not, give us a try. If the alarm didn’t go off at 02:48, I’d have Champagne to celebrate ☕️ https://lnkd.in/ec6emA_6"
