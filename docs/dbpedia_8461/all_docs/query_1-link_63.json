        "text": "Nomadic life and climate change, air pollution and endemic corruption - Mongolia’s economy has tripled in size since becoming a democracy thirty years ago and the sudden growth has brought many challenges. It is a nation of sweeping grassland pastures and an ever-growing Gobi desert, sealed between Russia to its north and China to its south. Such large autocratic neighbours bring a sense of threat to this fledgling democratic nation. All those issues and more are raised by the public and debated by a panel of politicians at the moment a new coalition government is being formed.
