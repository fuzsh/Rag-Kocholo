        "text": "The Afghan Women’s Network\n\nis demanding that no amendment or changes should be made in the law on\n\nelimination of violence against women.\n\nThe Afghan Women’s Network\n\nsaid that the Parliament is trying to bring some amendments in the law on\n\nelimination of violence against women which will prove to be detrimental for\n\nthe Afghan women and put front some serious challenges.\n\nRecently the law on\n\nelimination of violence against women has been tabled in the Parliament for\n\ndiscussion.\n\nThe planned changes in the law have surprised the Afghan Women’s Network.\n\nMahbobah Saraj, a member of\n\nAfghan Women’s Network said, “Any kind of compromise on women rights will\n\nput in danger the last ten years of achievements.”\n\nThe law on elimination of\n\nviolence against women has been called as the most powerful law supporting the\n\nrights of women in the country after the Constitution.\n\nThis law lists crimes such as\n\nunder age forced marriage, selling and buying of women/girls under the pretext\n\nof marriage, self-immolation, beating, raping and various other forms of\n\nviolence against women.\n\nSummarizing the probable\n\namendments in this law, Sorya Sobrang, a member of the Afghan Women’s Network\n\nsaid, “It is perceived that some amendments would come regarding women’s\n\nmarriages, right of education, safe houses for women and some other issues. For\n\nexample in the current law it has been mentioned that every girl aged 18 years\n\ncan decide about her future but in the changes it has been mentioned that if the\n\nfamily of the girl or her lawyer says that it is not going to harm her then she\n\ncan’t marry.”\n\nHeather Barr a member of\n\nHuman Rights Watch said, “Even though we are not satisfied with the\n\nnon-implementation of this law but having this law is a sign of progress and\n\nany kind of changes in this law would be a disaster for the Afghan women. The\n\nParliament should work towards strengthening this law and not weaken it.”\n\n_______________________________________________"
