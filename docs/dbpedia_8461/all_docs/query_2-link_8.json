        "text": "\"We are going back to darkness.\"\n\nThe Taliban are back in power in Afghanistan. It's been 20 years since the last time they were in control of the country, during which time the rights of women in Afghanistan suffered greatly. They were forced under male guardianship, kept out of universities, government and jobs. The Taliban now say women will have play a part in some of those spaces under Sharia law. But is this really the Taliban 2.0?\n\nJoin our panel as they discuss the future for women in Afghanistan, how the last 20 years had differed from the previous Taliban rule and what their hopes/fears are for women moving forward."
