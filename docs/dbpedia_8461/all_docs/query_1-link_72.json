        "text": "After street demonstrations across major cities in Afghanistan, women have now taken to social media to protest against the Taliban‚Äôs hardline policies towards them.\n\nAn online campaign has seen Afghan women around the world share photos of themselves wearing traditional colourful clothes, using the hashtag #DoNotTouchMyClothes.\n\nThe protest is a response to a sit-down demonstration orchestrated by the Taliban at Kabul University, where about 300 women appeared in all-black garments covering their faces, hands and feet ‚Äì the sort of dress previously never seen across the country.\n\nWaving Taliban flags, the women said they supported the militants who have announced that women would not be allowed to hold high-ranking government positions and that schools and universities needed to be gender-segregated.\n\nSince the Taliban took the capital Kabul, it has set up an all-male interim government with just a handful of Tajik and Uzbek representatives and no member of the ethnic Hazara minority.\n\nThe ministry of women‚Äôs affairs is not part of the new regime, which has brought back the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, ensuring that sharia law is implemented throughout the country.\n\nMany Afghan women, especially in urban centres, fear that their hard-gained freedoms might be limited, remembering the 1996 to 2001 Taliban regime that saw women largely confined to their homes.\n\nDr Bahar Jalali, an Afghan historian and gender studies expert, posted the first photo using the #DoNotTouchMyClothes hashtag, which has since inspired Afghan women across the globe.\n\nPeymana Assad, the first person of Afghan origin to be elected to public office in the UK, posted a photo of herself in colourful garments and tweeted: ‚ÄúThis is Afghan culture. My traditional dress.‚Äù\n\nThis is Afghan culture. My traditional dress #AfghanWomen\n\nThank you to Dr @RoxanaBahar1 for the inspiration.\n\nOur cultural attire is not the dementor outfits the Taliban have women wearing. pic.twitter.com/i9wFASfWR6\n\n‚Äî Peymana Assad üèî (@Peymasad) September 12, 2021\n\nThe BBC‚Äôs Sana Safi, posting a similar photo, wrote: ‚ÄúSo how do Afghan women dress then? This is how. If I was in Afghanistan then I would have the scarf on my head. This is as ‚Äòconservative‚Äô and ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô as I/you can get.‚Äù\n\nMusician Ariana Delawari shared a photo of her mother ‚Äúwith me in her belly‚Äù, she wrote, wearing traditional dresses and no headscarves decades ago in Afghanistan.\n\nMy mom (with me in her belly), my khalas, and my sisters in Afghanistan dresses üá¶üá´üèî #donottouchmyclothes #afghanistanwomen #AfghanistanCulture pic.twitter.com/P7i9bb0Em7\n\n‚Äî ariana delawari (@arianadelawari) September 13, 2021\n\nDespite the Taliban‚Äôs announcement that further protests would only be allowed if approved by the ministry of justice, women in Kabul have pledged to continue their demonstrations.\n\nSamira, a Kabul University student, said that this was her only way forward. ‚ÄúThe Taliban is already starting to limit women‚Äôs freedoms,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have nothing to lose. I will either be locked inside my house, unable to continue my education, or I can fight. Even if I risk my life, even if they kill me, it‚Äôs better than being silenced.‚Äù"
