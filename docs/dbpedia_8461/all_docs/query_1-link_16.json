        "text": "However, this has not stopped many courageous Afghan women from sharing their stories and continuing to advocate for girls and womens' rights.\n\nIt is as vital as ever that we let these women’s voices be heard and ensure that those still living in Afghanistan are not forgotten.\n\nExplore this selection of literature, music, podcasts and more, to hear directly from Afghan women.\n\nHailed by The Observer as a ‘page-turning account of the lives of Afghan women’ this memoir documents Dr. Homeira Qaderi's strength, resilience and the sacrifices she was forced to make in the face of a repressive de facto government.\n\nThough this book tells the story of Qaderi’s personal experience, it speaks to the character of millions of Afghan women who refuse to give up hope under extraordinarily dangerous conditions.\n\nIn her TED talk, Shabana Basij-Rasikh recounts her experience evacuating over 250 students, staff and family members from the ground-breaking institution she founded – Afghanistan’s first and only all-girls boarding school – after the Taliban took power.\n\nAs Shabana continues to advocate for girls' education, she urges her audience not to forget about Afghan women: \"As Afghanistan slips from the front pages, do not look away.\"\n\nBefore fleeing Kabul in August 2021, Latifa worked as an advocacy coordinator for Women for Women International. She now lives in London as a refugee but remains dedicated to helping women survivors of war. In this blog, she shares the emotional experience of leaving her country, how she dealt with an uncertain future and what the international community should be doing to protect the women who remain in Afghanistan.\n\nIn this report, we spoke to current and former participants of our programme in Afghanistan, as well as the Afghan activists and organisations who have continued their work since the Taliban took control of the government in August 2021. They told us, in their own words, about the challenges they’ve faced, their hopes for the future and the support they would like to see from the international community.\n\nJournalist and news presenter, Yalda Hakim, is determined not to let the world forget about the restrictions placed on Afghan girls' right to an education.\n\nShe has been using her social media platform to keep count of the number of days teenage girls have been banned from attending school using the hashtag #LetAfghanGirlsLearn.\n\nMeghan is a multi-platinum Afghan-American singer and songwriter, who has written music for household names including Kelly Clarkson and Selena Gomez.\n\nBut she is also an advocate for peace, using her music to raise awareness for Afghanistan. Listen to her powerful self-composed song Sarzamine Man, which she hopes will bring people together to stand in solidarity with victims of persecution.\n\nFor female judges working in Afghanistan, their inspirational and revered careers left them vulnerable following the Taliban's takeover of the government.\n\nIn this podcast, Afghan broadcast journalist, Sana Safi, hears the story of two female judges who, fearful for their lives, went into hiding before being evacuated by 'operation snow leopard', coordinated by the humanitarian community."
