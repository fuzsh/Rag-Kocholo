        "text": "On April 26, the VIDC and the Danish Refugee Council’s Diaspora Programme (DRC DP) convened an online public event “Afghanistan Peace Talks - A Road to Nowhere? to examine the progress of the peace talks between the Afghan government’s delegation and the Taliban negotiators. The online event Followed the announcement of the withdrawal of troops by the US and NATO, and was attended by 130+ participants, with nearly 4,000 following or watching the video on social media. The event focused on the progress of peace talks, the view from the ground across Afghanistan, participation of civil society including Afghan diaspora, protection of women’s and minorities’ rights, and the measures that are needed to prevent Afghanistan from falling into another chapter of civil war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the withdrawal of the United States’ combat forces from Afghanistan by 11 September 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington. Meanwhile, the Turkish government is aiming at hosting a U.N.-led conference on the peace process in Afghanistan after Ramadan and Eid festivities. The upcoming peace conference should serve as a platform for the Taliban and the Afghan government to reach an agreement to end the war in Afghanistan. A cease-fire and the creation of an interim government to secure peace are expected to be the main topics of discussions. However, the slow pace of talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban thus far suggests it will be difficult to reduce violence and reach a political settlement before US troops are withdrawn. U.S and NATO officials have continually said that the Taliban have so far failed to live up to their commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan.\n\nFor this event, we had an experienced panel with Fawzia Koofi, a female peace negotiator from the Afghan government delegation, Dr. Sima Samar, the former head of Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission, the Afghan Journalist Bilal Sarwary and Rahelah Sediqi, a women’s rights activist from the Afghan diaspora in the UK."
