        "text": "Afghanistan claims to be \"open for business\", and some super-rich Afghans have begun investing in their own country. But how soon can their money start replacing the billions of dollars in overseas aid the country has had so far?\n\nThe \"9/11 millionaire\" is how Afghan entrepreneur and businessman Fahim Hashimy is often described. He made his fortune, which he modestly calls \"small-sized\", from contracts supplying Americans in the wartime years.\n\nBefore the international involvement in Afghanistan, Mr Hashimy - born and raised in Kabul - was a young English-language teacher and owned a bicycle.\n\nWith the arrival of American boots on Afghan soil he was one of the first to be recruited, in his early 20s, as an interpreter on a US military base.\n\nAt 35, he now heads an empire, the Hashimy Group, with an average turnover of more than $200m (Â£134m) a year, which includes Afghanistan's second-biggest TV station, 1TV, as well as logistics and construction companies. He also launched East Horizon, a low-cost domestic airline, in 2013.\n\nHe puts his rapid career success down to luck.\n\n\"Not everyone spoke English and I was lucky I did. I also had the ambition and the vision, followed by hard work and commitment, and I knew how to write proposals,\" he told me.\n\nOnce he was firmly established with the military, and accustomed to \"the American and British\" way of doing things, he used his strong business nose to secure supply contracts from the international forces, starting with a small $600 order for bed sheets.\n\nOver that same period, many super-rich Afghans have moved far more capital abroad, mainly to the tax-free luxury and relative security and stability of Dubai.\n\nEstimates vary, but they are thought to have invested more than $20bn there.\n\nMuch of it has gone into the property market, especially the exclusive artificial island resort of Palm Jumeirah, where the largest signature villa - complete with drivers and maids' quarters - sells for more than $11m.\n\nSince the political uncertainty of 2014 inside Afghanistan, the influx of Afghan money has continued.\n\nAccording to one real estate agent, \"a lot of high-ranking generals and politicians, and wealthy oil sector individuals, are still buying very expensive homes\".\n\nOne such businessman, who lives on the Palm, told us nearly a quarter of properties on this exclusive strip of Dubai beach are owned by Afghan warlords.\n\nIs it easier to get rich in Afghanistan compared with elsewhere?\n\nFahim Hashimy sums up the Afghan dilemma.\n\n\"It's easy because there's no competition. But it's harder because it's very risky.\n\n\"If you owned a business in the UK, you wouldn't want to invest in Afghanistan because of the high risk.\n\n\"On the other hand, when we risk our capital here, we don't have to compete with those giants in the UK.\"\n\nYou can watch Sana Safi's report on Wednesday 25 March 2015 on BBC World News throughout the day."
