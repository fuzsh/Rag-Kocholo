        "text": "This page contains a translation into English of the lyrics to \"Sana Helwa Ya Gameel\", which is the Arabic-language version of the song \"Happy Birthday to You\". The song title is sometimes spelled as \"Sana Hilwa Ya Gamil\".\n\nSana Helwa Ya Gameel (Happy Birthday, Handsome), 1964\n\nSong Title in Arabic: Ø³ÙØ© Ø­ÙÙØ© ÙØ§ Ø¬Ù ÙÙ\n\nAlbum: Joyeux Anniversaire\n\nAppeared in the Motion Picture Fatinat Al Jamahir\n\nLyricist: Mohamed Abdel Fotouh\n\nComposer: Mildred J. Hill\n\nSabah's Version Arranged By: Mohamed Abdel Wahab\n\nThis version became popular throughout the Arabic-speaking world when legendary Lebanese singer Sabah sang it in the 1964 movie Fatinat Al Jamahir. This arrangement was created for her by the famous Egyptian composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Also included is a transliteration of the Arabic lyrics into the Roman alphabet so you can sing along if you like.\n\nAbout Sabah\n\nSabah was a highly successful Lebanese singer and movie star, born in 1927 to a Christian family. Tragically, her father was abusive, and her brother murdered her mother because he believed she was having an affair. Sabah's first marriage was mostly to escape this home life.\n\nSabah recorded her first song in 1940, at age 13. Her first movie, El-Qalb Luh Wahed, was released in 1945 and made her a star. Her career in cinema led her to move to Egypt.\n\nSabah had ten different husbands. One of them, Egyptian actor Rushdie Abaza, married her in 1977 while still married to Samia Gamal! It seems he failed to inform Sabah that he had not yet completed his divorce from Samia, and the marriage only lasted three days. There is a famous quote in which Sabah said, \"Whoever hasn't been married to Rushdy Abaza, hasn't been married.\" (Her words are always repeated with a broad wink.)\n\nOver the course of her career, Sabah recorded over 3,000 songs and appeared in 98 movies. She received a special honor at the 1998 Alexandria film festival and retired from cinema in 1981. Sabah is considered one of the three Lebanese icons, along Wadih El Safi and Fairouz, and she was nicknamed \"The Empress of Lebanese Song\"."
