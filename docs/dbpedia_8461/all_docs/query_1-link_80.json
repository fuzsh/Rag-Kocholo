        "text": "However, when Charlotte Bellis, a reporter with Al Jazeera, asked if women journalists can work as they have in the past, Mujahid said that's for \"the next government\" to decide.\n\nImages emerged on social media this week of female journalists from several Afghan outlets, including TOLO News, Ariana TV, and Etilaatroz, reporting on the situation in Kabul and even interviewing a member of the Taliban.\n\nHasiba Attakpal, a reporter at TOLO News, was shown reporting from the streets of Afghanistan, while women were also shown taking part in a morning meeting alongside male journalists in the TOLO News office.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSakina Amiri, a reporter at the Afghan daily Etilaatroz, was photographed interviewing members of the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasrin Shirzad from Ariana TV continued her usual role anchoring a current affairs program.\n\nSaad Mohseni, the director of the parent company of TOLO News, tweeted out photos of both Attakpal and Zahra Rahimi doing their jobs despite the looming uncertainty.\n\nMOBYGroup, a Dubai-based media company, established TOLO in 2010 as Afghanistan's first 24-hour news channel. Mohseni noted that such interviews likely wouldn't have been able to take place 20 years ago, the last time the Taliban was in power.\n\nAt the same time, many women working in journalism in Afghanistan remain worried for their safety. One woman told The Guardian that \"death threatens us at every moment.\"\n\nPBS news correspondent Jane Ferguson wrote on Twitter that the presence of women on TV was a \"test\" for the Taliban. But, she asked, \"Will this be tolerated long term?\""
