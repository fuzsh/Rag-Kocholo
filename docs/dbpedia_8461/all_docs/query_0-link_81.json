        "text": "Letter from The Hon Andrew Robb AO MP to Mr Bashir Keshtiar of the Australian-Afghan Business Council\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nAustralian support for the Afghan National Army Officer’s Academy\n\nDecember 2015\n\nAssistance from the Australian Embassy has helped provide more than 1,000 manuals containing Afghan military doctrine to the Afghan National Army Officer’s Academy. The production allows for every instructor and officer cadet at the Academy to own their own individual copy. It is the first time in the Academy’s three year history officer cadets will have a copy of military doctrine to call their own. The Academy teaches Afghan National Army officers key leadership and tactical skills. Members of the Australian Defence Force have been central to the early success of Academy, proving mentoring to advise and assist the Afghan instructors.\n\nCelebrating Afghan women\n\n27 October 2015\n\nBraving the autumn chill, Afghans and the international community came together at the Australian Embassy in Kabul to celebrate the achievements of Afghan women. The event on 27 October, co-hosted by the Canadian Embassy, was themed “the Power of Afghan women” and was attended by ambassadors from a range of countries, Afghan Ministers and Members of Parliament, and the First Lady of Afghanistan, Her Excellency Rula Ghani.\n\nThe event formed part of Australia’s work advocating for the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan. Australia’s Ambassador to Afghanistan, Matt Anderson, said “advancing and empowering women in Afghanistan requires a strong commitment, and political and social support for human rights by all stakeholders”. He reiterated Australia’s support for the women and girls of Afghanistan, particularly our commitment to ending violence against women.\n\nThe Ambassador also announced $2 million would be provided to UNWomen from Australia’s Gender Equality Fund. This funding is in addition to $10 million already provided to UNWomen through Australia’s Ending Violence Against Women (EVAW) program in Afghanistan. Nearly 90 percent of women in Afghanistan experience some form of violence in their lifetime, yet there are often limited options for these women to seek recourse or assistance, underscoring the importance of this program. The $22.7 million EVAW program in Afghanistan works with the Afghan Government to support activities that protect, promote and empower Afghan women and girls.\n\nFunded by the Australia Government since 2013, UNWomen’s work in Afghanistan has already made a significant difference in the lives of women and girls fleeing violence. Over 1,700 women throughout Afghanistan accessed support from UNWomen during 2014-15 alone, including accessing protection shelters. A shelter in Kabul run by one of UNWomen’s implementing partners has become home to two young women who fled forced marriages as children, and faced uncertain futures. With support from UNWomen, these girls have graduated from high school and gone on to study at university. Other women living in the shelter have accessed literacy training and were able to find employment with the shelter organisation. However, many other women languish in shelters for extended periods of time, with no realistic options for returning home or resuming a normal life. With this additional funding, UNWomen will be able to provide these women with training, mentoring or entrepreneurial opportunities, to give them the chance to earn their own incomes and reintegrate back into communities.\n\nPhoto Exhibition Celebrates Achievements of 'Children of Uruzgan'\n\n8 September 2015\n\nAfghanistan’s First Lady, Her Excellency Rula Ghani, attended a photo exhibition to celebrate the success of the Children of Uruzgan program at the Australian Embassy on 7 September.\n\nThe exhibition celebrated the work of the Afghans and expatriates who delivered the $36 million Save the Children program funded by the Australian Government from 2011-2015.\n\nPhoto: First Lady H.E Rula Ghani addresses the crowd at the Children of Uruzgan photo exhibition\n\nThe program began as part of Australia’s involvement with the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Uruzgan and completed activities throughout the province in June this year. The program made significant health and education gains, in particular for women and girls, in a province blighted by war, poverty and natural disaster.\n\nWith Australia’s support there are now 40 girls’ schools and more than 250 schools in total in Uruzgan Province. These are attended by 60,000 students, nearly 10,000 of them girls. Children of Uruzgan established community-based education classes in the most difficult to access areas, providing 4,000 children, including more than 1,000 girls, with access to basic education.\n\nThe program funded nearly 300 community development projects such as clean water wells, and built three community libraries and two parks for women and children.\n\nIt also established health centres and trained health teams that provided more than 150,000 consultations last year, mostly to women and girls.\n\nImprovements to maternal health care saw the rate of pregnant women receiving professional antenatal care more than doubled to 90 percent, and the number giving birth with a skilled attendant increased from 22 to 64 percent. Twenty four new midwives and 22 female nurses were trained and many are now deployed at public health facilities in Uruzgan, providing more than 100 safe deliveries each month.\n\nPhoto: Some of the photos from the exhibition\n\nMore than 50 people attended the outdoor exhibition on the lawn of one of the embassy residences, including heads of missions from the US, Germany, Norway, Canada, Sweden and the UK; the Minister for Information and Culture, Ab Bari Jahani; and the Deputy Minister from the Ministry of Public Health, Ahmad Jan Naeem. The Australian Defence Force, which managed the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Uruzgan from 2010-2013, was represented by Brigadier Michael Annett.\n\nAmbassador Matt Anderson opened the event with a speech acknowledging the achievements of Children of Uruzgan and the sacrifices of Afghan program staff who had lost their lives while attempting to improve those of others. He made a commitment to continue employing the lessons learned from the program in other work being supported by the Australian Government with Save the Children to help improve people’s lives in remote communities and build the government’s capacity in health and education.\n\nPhoto: Ambassador Anderson with the First Lady\n\nIn her own speech, H.E. Mrs Ghani told the audience that the Afghan people were grateful for the ongoing international support for the needs of their communities. She said the Children of Uruzgan program was a good example of how development could make a real difference at the community level, particularly for women and girls.\n\nShe encouraged the international community to continue working with NGOs working with local partners throughout the country in support of the government’s development priorities.\n\nKabul Direct Aid Program 2015/16 is Now Open\n\n12 July 2015\n\nApplications for the 2015/16 Direct Aid Program (DAP) are now open. DAP is a flexible small grants program funded from Australia’s aid budget which is managed by the Australian Embassy Kabul.\n\nDAP funding in Afghanistan is available on a not-for-profit basis to individuals, community groups and NGOs engaged in development activities in Afghanistan. The program focuses on supporting small-scale development projects and activities which can achieve practical outcomes related to community health and infrastructure, economic empowerment, youth, gender equality and poverty alleviation.\n\nTo be eligible for funding, projects must fall within the DAP guidelines. The Kabul DAP Committee will consider each application on its merits and make recommendations for funding based on expected development outcomes and whether the proposed project meets the guidelines.\n\nTo make an application for DAP funding for 2015/16 or to receive the guidelines for funding, please send an email to [email protected]\n\nFor further information on DAP, please see http://dfat.gov.au/aid/topics/development-issues/direct-aid-program/Pages/direct-aid-program.aspx\n\nFemale Members of the Afghan Parliament Visit Australia\n\n14 June 2015\n\nThree female members of the Afghan Parliament; Ms Shukria Barakzai, Ms Golalai Nur Safi, and Ms Farkhunda Zahra Naderi visited Australia from May 24 to 29, 2015 as part of an Afghan Female Parliamentary Delegation.\n\nInvited by the Australian Government to discuss issues around the status of women and girls in Afghanistan, they met a number of Australian government officials and civil society representatives including Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, the Speaker of the House of Representatives Bronwyn Bishop, MP Nola Marino, President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Ms Gillian Triggs, and the Australian Electoral Commission.\n\nThe purpose of this visit was to build linkages between Australia and prominent Afghan female MPs who are advocates for the role of women in parliament, the political process and women’s rights more broadly. During this visit the Afghan MPs discussed key barriers and enabling factors enhancing women’s leadership and political participation, economic empowerment and elimination of violence against women while Australian officials conveyed their support for Afghan women and girls.\n\nThey spoke at a number of public forums, including at the Australian National University in Canberra, and the University of NSW and the Lowy Institute in Sydney.\n\nSupporting women’s empowerment is both a foreign policy priority and development objective for Australia’s work in Afghanistan. Through our aid program we prioritise efforts to stop violence against women, women’s participation in economic activity, including as beneficiaries in rural livelihoods projects, and improving girls’ literacy rates.\n\nPhoto: Afghan MPs Ms Golalai Nur Safi, Ms Shukria Barakzai, Ms Farkhunda Naderi and Afghan Ambassador to Australia Mr Nasir Andisha meet The Hon Julie Bishop in her office.\n\nDiscussions on Australia’s Development Support for Afghanistan\n\n6 June 2015\n\nAustralian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Matt Anderson, and Development Counsellor and Head of Aid, Scott Kelleher, met with President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani to discuss Australia’s future development support for Afghanistan on Saturday, 6 June.\n\nMeeting at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, the President and Ambassador discussed ways to further enhance bilateral relations and Australian assistance for Afghanistan.\n\nReiterating Australia’s ongoing commitment, Mr Kelleher said that Afghanistan will become Australia’s fourth-largest bilateral development program in 2015-16.\n\nAfghanistan will receive more than AUD$80 million in development assistance focused on improving agricultural productivity, public financial management programs, support for ending violence against women and children, education, and humanitarian support for displaced people.\n\nAustralia is also providing USD$100 million per year for the next three years to support funding of Afghanistan’s National Defence and Security Forces as part of its Chicago commitment to Afghanistan’s peace and stability.\n\nPresident Ghani thanked Australia for continuing to support Afghanistan and talked about the development challenges the country faces. The President reaffirmed Afghanistan’s commitments to the Realizing Self-Reliance development agenda released at the London Conference in December 2014 and asked for Australian expertise in urban development and public financial management.\n\nThe meeting followed an earlier audience with Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah on 25 May. Ambassador Anderson and Mr Kelleher again discussed Australia’s continued development support. Dr Abdullah said Afghanistan owed a debt of gratitude to Australia for the lives it had lost and for the support it continued to provide.\n\nMore information about Australia’s Development Assistance to Afghanistan is available here: http://dfat.gov.au/geo/afghanistan/development-assistance/Pages/development-assistance-in-afghanistan.aspx\n\nPhoto: President Ghani meets with Australian Ambassador Matt Anderson and Head of Aid Scott Kelleher tdiscuss Australia\\'s development assistance to Aghanistan\n\nAustralia Celebrates International Women’s Day in Kabul\n\n7 March 2015\n\nAustralian Ambassador Matt Anderson hosted a roundtable on women’s empowerment with prominent Afghans to celebrate International Women’s Day in Kabul on Saturday, 7 March.\n\nThe event provided an opportunity to discuss a range of issues including women in leadership and peace processes, women’s economic empowerment, and eliminating violence against women.\n\nAmbassador Anderson welcomed attendees including Shinkai Karokhel (member of the Afghan Parliament), Hasina Safi (Afghan Women’s Network), Najla Ayubi (The Asia Foundation), Salma Popalzai (Women for Afghan Women), Musa Mahmodi (Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission) and Dr Abdul Basit (United Nations Population Fund).\n\nShinkai Karokhel (Afghan Member of Parliament) and Najia Ayubi (Deputy Country Representative, The Asia Foundation) at a women’s empowerment roundtable hosted by Ambassador Matt Anderson in Kabul to mark International Women’s Day.\n\nAmbassador Anderson said increasing women’s empowerment remains a focus of international community efforts in Afghanistan, including for Australia.\n\n“Australia is pleased to be a part of International Women’s Day celebrations in Afghanistan. Today’s roundtable discussion provided a valuable opportunity to hear from Afghan women and men on the challenges and opportunities for women and girls in this country.”\n\nAmbassador Anderson noted Australia’s strong support for women in Afghanistan, where Australia is providing AUD22.7 million over five years (2013-2017) to help eliminate violence against women.\n\n“Through our advocacy and development assistance, Australia is a strong supporter of women’s economic, social and political empowerment and committed to ending violence against women,” the Ambassador said.\n\n“As one of Australia’s White Ribbon Ambassadors, increasing respect for women is something that I am personally focused on.”\n\nParticipants discussed the instrumental role of education to women’s empowerment, with Ms Hasina Safi arguing for ‘education, then economic empowerment, then leadership’. The roundtable participants also discussed the need for increased market access for women, and for women to play a larger role in the Afghan civil service, where women hold only 10 per cent of decision-making roles.\n\nThe Ambassador also represented Australia at the Afghan Government’s International Women’s Day Event hosted by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs on Thursday, 5 March.\n\nAmbassador Anderson with Elzira Sagynbaeva (Country Director, UNWOMEN) and General Hikmar Shahi (Director, Gender and Human Rights Directorate, Ministry of the Interior) at the International Women’s Day event at Amani High School auditorium on 5 March 2015.\n\nMore than 500 people filled the Amani High School auditorium to hear special guests President Ghani and First Lady Rula Ghani.
