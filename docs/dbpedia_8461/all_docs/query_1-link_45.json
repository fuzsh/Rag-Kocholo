        "text": "Director Anthony Feinstein's latest documentary focuses on the work of 6 Afghan journalists and comprises five interlinked sections: their exposure to acts of terror, the effects of this exposure on their emotional and physical health, their lack of safety equipment and the absence of psychological therapies for PTSD and depression, the particularly difficult challenges faced by Afghan women journalists and finally, their hope and fears for the future. The decision of the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan and the escalating attacks on journalists by the Taliban and ISIS have left the media in the country in a precarious and dangerous position. This documentary reveals the high psychological cost paid by Afghan journalists in an age of terror.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a 30 minute Q&A with the films director, Anthony Feinstein."
