        "text": "About Swahili\n\nSwahili (also known as Kiswahili) is the most commonly spoken language in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, Swahili is an official language along with English, and children are usually taught in Swahili in school.\n\nThe Basics of Saying Hello in Swahili\n\nBesides the standard habari or jambo, I will teach you how to say even ‘good morning’ in Swahili (or good afternoon/evening) plus some other cool stuff that you can use while interacting with fun-loving youthful peers.\n\nChances are that you may not need to know all the greetings discussed in this article so it makes sense to first cover the basic greetings that are applicable in almost every situation. You may want to read to the bottom if you want to have a little more fun with your Swahili greetings, though.\n\nThere are basically five ways to say hello in Swahili:\n\nHujambo or jambo (how are you?) – Sijambo (seeJAmbo) (I am fine / no worries)\n\nHabari? (any news?) – nzuri (nZOOree) (fine)\n\nU hali gani? (oo HAlee GAnee) (how are you) – njema (fine)\n\nShikamoo (a young person to an elder) – marahaba\n\nFor casual interactions: mambo? Or Vipi? Or Sema? (scroll down to street language section for explanations).\n\nOther replies to the above greetings that might be used in place of nzuri:\n\nnjema (NJEma) – fine\n\nsalama (saLAAma) – peaceful / all’s well\n\nsawa (SAwa) – okay\n\nvyema (VYEma) – well\n\nnaendelea vyema (naendeLEa VYEma) – I am doing well\n\nNow let’s dig deeper …\n\nAsking ‘How Are You?’ in Swahili?\n\nHujambo (how are you? – to one person) – Sijambo (I am fine).\n\nHamjambo (how are you? – to two or more people) – Hatujambo (We are fine).\n\nHabari? (literal translation is: news?) – nzuri (fine – to mean there is no bad news).\n\nU hali gani (how are you – to one person) – nzuri (fine).\n\nMhali gani (how are you – to two or more people) – nzuri (fine).\n\nVariants to Habari According to Time of Day\n\nHabari? simply means news? As in ‘is there any news in your life I should know?’\n\nThe standard reply is nzuri to mean that everything is fine. If there is something troubling you then you can say mbaya (MBAya) which means bad. The other person will then proceed to ask what is wrong.\n\nIf you want to be specific – to state the time of day – you can use the following:\n\nHabari za asubuhi (good morning) – nzuri (fine)\n\nHabari za mchana (good afternoon)\n\nHabari za jioni (good evening)\n\nHabari za kutwa? ( how has your day been?)\n\nPeers Greeting Each Other / Cool Street Language\n\nYoung people everywhere like to make language sound cool. Swahili speakers are no exception.\n\nWhile walking the streets of a Kenyan town, you might hear some of these Swahili greetings. Most of them are informal and should not be used in formal writing.\n\nMambo (MAmbo) – What’s up?\n\nVipi? (VEEpee?) – how?\n\nSema? (SEma?) – speak?\n\nThe replies to these greetings can be:\n\nSafi (SAfee) – Clean\n\nPoa (POa) – Cool\n\nFreshi (fREshee) – fresh (it is a swahilized slang version of the English word fresh)\n\nAnother informal greeting is:\n\nIs vipi? (is how?) – is poa (is cool) …??? well, doesn’t make any sense but it sounds cool.\n\nThis is from Sheng – Swahili street slang that is a mixture of English and Swahili. Sheng is spoken by the youthful urban population mainly in Kenya but is slowly catching up in Tanzania.\n\nShikamoo?\n\nIt is not necessary that you use this greeting but it is important that you learn it so that when you encounter it somewhere you know what it means.\n\nShikamoo? (sheeKAmo) – Marahaba (maraHAba)\n\nThis greeting is used when a young person is greeting a significantly older person. It is used to show respect.\n\nShikamoo literally translates to ‘touching your leg’. The greeting therefore works one way and only a young person can initiate the conversation by saying “shikamoo?”\n\nBidding Goodbye in Swahili\n\nKwaheri (kwaHEree) (Goodbye)\n\nTuonane kesho (too-o-NAne Kesho) (see you tomorrow) – Inshallah (eenSHAllah) ( God willing)\n\nUende salama (oo-E-nde saLAma) (go with peace) – Tuonane inshallah (we will see each other God willing).\n\nGoodnight in Swahili\n\nUsiku mwema (ooSEEkoo mWEma) (Goodnight) – Wa buraha (wa booRAha) (with tranquility)\n\nlala salama (sleep well / peacefully) – nawe pia (Nawe PEE-a) (you too)\n\nNdoto njema (NDOto NJEma) (sweet/good dreams) – Za mafanikio (za mafaneeKEEo) (of prosperity/success)\n\nOther useful phrases that will come in handy\n\nAsante – “Thank you!” You will use this word the most in your conversations.\n\nSawa – “OK”\n\nKaribu – “Welcome” or Karibuni – Welcome (to more than one person)\n\nSana – (Very) used as in Asante-sana– Thank you VERY much.\n\nPole – “I am sorry for your misfortune.” This applies to everything from getting chalk dust on your clothes, to tripping, dropping an item or sneezing.\n\nPole pole – “Slowly, slowly.” Everything is pole pole in Africa.\n\nChakula – “FOOD!” If you hear this word, walk towards the place you heard it.\n\nNdiyo / Hapana – “Yes” and “No” respectively.\n\nTafadhali – “Please”\n\nJina lako nani? – “What is your name?”\n\nJina langu ni John – “My name is John”"
