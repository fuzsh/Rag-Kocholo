The panel discussion presents an opportunity to hear from experts and journalists as they reflect on these crises, as well as how Afghanaid’s national and provincial staff have been navigating severe operational challenges in the two years since the Taliban takeover, and safeguarded the organisation’s long standing presence in remote and rural areas of Afghanistan, continuing to devise solutions to help Afghan families build a better future.\n\nFrom different viewpoints, the event’s panellists will reveal various insights into people's resilience amidst adversity in Afghanistan. The panel consists of Sana Safi (Broadcast Journalist, BBC), Hameed Hakimi (Associate Fellow, Chatham House), Catherine Philp (Diplomatic Correspondent, The Times) and Charles Davy (Managing Director, Afghanaid). The discussion will be chaired by Lyse Doucet OBE (Chief International Correspondent, BBC).\n\nAttendees are welcome to join the event virtually or in person. With the Lecture & Reception ticket option, attendees can continue engaging in conversations with the panellists during the drinks and canapé reception, which will take place after the panel discussion.\n\nFind out more about the event and secure an in-person or virtual ticket: www.afghanaid.org.uk/event/resilience-through-adversity\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nKate Arthur, Head of Communications and Giving [email protected];\n\nCall +44 (0) 207 916 9883 or email [email protected]\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nAbout the \"Afghanaid at 40: Resilience Through Adversity\" event\n\nLocation:\n\nRoyal Geographical Society\n\n1 Kensington Gore\n\nSouth Kensington\n\nLondon, SW7 2AR\n\nTimes:\n\n6:30pm Doors open\n\n7:00pm Talks and panel discussion begin, moderated by Lyse Doucet\n\n8:30pm Virtual event ends / Drinks and canapé reception starts\n\n10:00 pm Doors close\n\nTickets:\n\nThe event is ticketed and there is limited capacity at the venue.

In 2021, Safi released the radio documentary, “Afghanistan and Me” where she shares how her life has been intertwined with the fate of her country.\n\nHameed Hakimi is an associate fellow at the Asia-Pacific Programme and Europe Programme at Chatham House.

Donations from the event represent a reliable stream of funds that grant Afghanaid maximum flexibility to direct funds to where needs and the potential to transform the lives of vulnerable Afghans and their communities for the better are the greatest. The loyal support from our wonderful giving community has enabled us to do this for 40 years and the proceeds from this event ensure this is the case for many more years to come.\n\nAbout Afghanaid\n\nAfghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation. Since 1983, our dedicated staff have worked with millions of families in some of the poorest and most remote communities in Afghanistan. We build basic services, improve livelihoods, strengthen the rights of women and children, help communities protect against natural disasters and adapt to climate change, and respond to humanitarian emergencies in pursuit of a peaceful and thriving Afghanistan."
