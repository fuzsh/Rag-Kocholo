        "text": "Since lockdown I have been working on a powerful project with Justice for Lai Dai Han, which will be the first global memorial for survivors of conflict related sexual violence. We have reached out, connected and collaborated with survivor groups and organisations across the world, including but not confined to Nadia's Initiative Dr. Denis Mukwege Foundation , The SEMA Network, The Kvinna till Kvinna Foundation @impact: Center Against Human Trafficking and Sexual Violence in Conflict, Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC) Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice GRACE AGENDA Mutere and Comfort Women Action for Redress & Education (CARE) , as well as others, and we are so grateful to them for their contributions. The image below shows a digitally enlarged image of the maquette superimposed onto the site its currently destined for. Working through carefully structured questionaires, survivors have provided symbolism that informs every ounce of this design. The main structure will be adorned with sybols chosen by survivors to represent their stories and strenght, and words by them will be engraved into the roots of that make up the figure. This memorial has now been given the green light. It is interesting because without lockdown, the project might never have got off the ground. The appearance of Zoom into our day to day lives meant that connecting with people all across the globe was more obviously a simple click away. This memorials survivors represent women, men and children, both born of rape in war and survivors of rape in war. This memorial is not about politics and finger pointing, but concentrates on the experience and feelings of survivors only. Together we are collaborating to design a memorial filled with symbols of strength, horror and beauty. By its nature this is a difficult subject matter to represent, and equally hard to contact and gain the trust of survivors. The power for survivors in being involved in a project like this is for them to realize that they have a voice, are seen, and are not alone. This affects thousands of people across the world, and yet the stigma and shame associated with it is shatteringly isolating. In order to make this memorial as far reaching and inclusive as possible, we need your help. So far we have symbolism representing survivors in the following countries: Iraq Ukraine Democratic Republic of Congo Rwanda Zimbabwe Cote d’Ivoire Guinea South Sudan Bosnia Kosovo Kenya Guatemala Columbia Vietnam South Korea Bangladesh Uganda Somalia South Africa I would be so grateful if you could share this post so that it might reach anyone interested in this project. There will be organizations that we might not have heard of in countries where we have yet to make contacts. There are some countries where this crime is well recorded but gaining contact with survivors is, unsurprisingly, challenging. If you would like to find out more about this project, please get in touch. #endsexualviolenceinconflict\n\nJoin #DoughtyStWomen on 2nd March for the annual #IWD celebration event. Every year, we bring together a diverse group of lawyers, judges, politicians, campaigners and academics to explore what more the law can do for women and girls. We are happy to announce that this year our #IWD2024 keynote address will be delivered by Monica McWilliams! Monica is a Professor of Women’s Studies, Transitional Justice Institute at the Ulster University, Former Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and member of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly. Monica was elected to a seat at the Multi-Party Peace Negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement and will speak about the role of women in peace processes. We're also excited to be joined by Christina Lamb OBE, leading foreign correspondent and author of “Our bodies, their battlefield - what War does to Women”, for an 'In Conversation' session with Helena Kennedy KC. This year, we are supporting Clean Break Theatre Company as our selected charity for #IWD2024. Clean Break was founded by two women in prison who believed in the power of theatre to transform lives. They use theatre to keep the subject of women in prison on the cultural radar, helping to reveal the damage caused by the criminal justice system. Any donations can be made to Clean Break directly: https://lnkd.in/emrcC_T6 We are also delighted to collaborate with Birth Companions, an organization dedicated to uplifting the lives of women and babies facing inequality and disadvantage. We will be collecting specific items that will directly benefit mothers and babies in various stages of their journey during the event. For more information about Birth Companions and their work, click here: https://lnkd.in/eqmnY2rr #DoughtyStWomen celebrate #IWD2024 by asking: what more can the law do for women? This week colleagues and friends share feminist messages of hope, challenge and change. Read what Antonia Benfield, Cynthia Francis, Maya Sikand KC, Nancy Hollander, Amanda Pannell and Kate Gibson have to say. Purchase your ticket and join us on 2nd March: https://lnkd.in/ebtxvTuW\n\nNot many of us can claim to have hunted with the Bushmen of the Kalahari; been detained for spying by the KGB; or smuggled ourselves over a border into an active war zone under the floorboards of an ambulance. Yet, for our latest guests on the Futureverse, this is all in a day’s work. The Sunday Times’ Chief Foreign Correspondent Christina Lamb OBE, who has been covering conflict around the globe for over three decades, does not regard herself as a risk taker, though. It was not an attraction to danger that led her to war reporting, but a surprise wedding invitation that landed on her desk in 1987. Similarly, as a teenager, the adventurer and broadcaster Simon Reeve, enjoyed the thrill of cycling down Acton High Street on his BMX, but did not imagine that he would spend his early professional life on the tail of neo-Nazi terrorists in Boston Spa. In this special episode of the Futureverse, Christina and Simon join Kamal Ahmed for a conversation about their attitudes to risk: what motivates them to take the risks that they do and how they calculate risk on the ground. It is a fascinating insight into what it means to put your life on the line in order to shine light on the darkest corners of the world. It also is a prescient reminder of Y TREE’s core principles: mitigate unnecessary risk – even Simon Reeve will not get in a car without a seat belt – and always set a personal risk level that feels right for you.
