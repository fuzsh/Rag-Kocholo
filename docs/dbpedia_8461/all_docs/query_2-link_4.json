        "text": "When I called for a fundamental world paradigm revolution more than 30 years ago, I expected to be called an eccentric. I wasn't. The Interface Paradigm (1rst Edition) immediately sold out. But no action taken: too scared. June 2024. European Commission President: Prof Vivian R. F. Linssen D. I. Von der Leyen IS A US PUPPET WARMONGER KEY SUPPORTER OF THE PALESTINIAN GENOCIDE WHO HAS BEEN SELECTED BY THE EPP GROUP FOR A SECOND MANDATE WHICH MEANS THAT THE EPP GROUP SUPPORTS THE PALESTINIAN GENOCIDE. Stand ins in front of the EU Institutions - European Commission, European Parliament, Council of Europe and before the EU Member States' EU Representations in each Member States shall be organised against von der Leyen and her dictatorial policy imposed on the EU citizens without their informed consent. Dr. Von der Leyen is interested in control, profit and power. Professor Linssen is interested in the well-being and quality of life of eight billion human beings at interconnected personal, family, neighbourhood, local, regional, national, continental and world levels. Von der Leyen does not have the calibre to govern Europe. She is weak, vulnerable, power hungry and therefore easily manipulated. Guterres: same issue. THERE IS NOW ONLY ONE PERSON AND ONE PROGRAMME THAT CAN RESTORE WORLD PEACE. There ISN'T ANYBODY ELSE FOR GOD'S SAKE! RESHARING AND LIKING MY POST BELOW IS NOT ENOUGH TO CATALYSE GLOBAL ACTION! We need full support from ALL NATIONS!!! See ðŸ‘‡: I am not imagining things but there clearly is an overwhelming worldwide plebiscite for the following: 1. https://lnkd.in/erHnd4rT 2. https://lnkd.in/ehuS9eXj 3. https://lnkd.in/e6kDYAws 4. https://lnkd.in/eThHWCFd 5. https://lnkd.in/e6-q-Vr9 6. https://lnkd.in/dnCVjBtd 7. https://lnkd.in/eamkZ2ek 8. https://lnkd.in/eCn_-HfX 9. https://lnkd.in/eHZhuDZZ 10. Difference between the WEF & the NCBP! https://lnkd.in/eK3qBB_f WHO or WHAT can bring back peace to the world? Is there anyone else among the eight billion minus one human beings on this planet? There is? WHO? There isn't? Then I respectfully ask for World politico-financial support to rethink the world together. Then NATO would not be needed anymore. Nor would any other EU defense. A World Army would only be useful in case of hostile invasion by an alien species. I REQUEST A NCBP WORLD MEETING TO SET UP AN INTERFACE GOVERNANCE BASED NEW WORLD CONSTITUTION, WITH - AND NOT IMPOSED ON - EIGHT BILLION HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE MOST AGREE, LET'S GET ON WITH THE WORLD NCBP SUMMIT! One of the main reasons why there is such difficulty managing this world is our civilisation's inability to connect the dots which requires an understanding of global complexity, something that is outside mainstream education competence but provided by the IMNRC. For example, connecting the dots is essential for a smooth running Interface Locality. Invest in the Education of Tomorrow: Interface Education ðŸ™‚ https://lnkd.in/eeA55kHk\n\nI listened to a podcast this morning hosted by the awesome Salem Barahmeh about the transformative power of alternative media and narratives. The first time I came across small-scale politically radical media was during the October revolution in Lebanon, when people acknowledged that pretty much all mainstream media was party-affiliated, propaganda machines. Today, the quest for alternative media is more crucial than ever â€“ the people have grown rightfully critical of mainstream media and the faÃ§ade of western liberal hypocrisy. We recognize the flaws of big media when championing false ideals of neutrality that are plagued by western bias. They are a big part of the problem, and the people want something different. As communicators, we grapple with these thoughts every day: Who are we pitching to? Who are we giving legitimacy to? What narratives are we amplifying? Who is funding the media we support and how does that influence their coverage? To free Palestine, we must free our our minds and decolonizing our thinking. Itâ€™s decolonizing the institutions and finding a model that prioritizes the wellbeing of our communities. We have to work until alternative media becomes mainstream.

You can find it on your preferred streaming app. In the interview, Bjorn discusses how podcasts are being used as a recruitment vehicle in different ways, including spreading extremist narratives and creating an ecosystem of intertwined narratives that amplify each other. These far-right leaning podcasts are used to draw people into more extreme spaces and can also be used as a vehicle for fundraising. It is important to note that podcasts are not the be all and end all but rather act as a gateway to more extreme online communities where there are more explicit encouragements of violence. You can listen to the full podcast here ðŸ‘‰ https://lnkd.in/eawJNNgb Glitterpill can help your company monitor these online spaces and prevent the spread of extremist narratives.
