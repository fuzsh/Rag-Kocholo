        "text": "üçÅ Honoring Asian Canadian Contributions to Military History üçÅ This Remembrance Day, I am reflecting on the incredible contributions of Chinese, Japanese, and Sikh Canadians to Canada's military history. Even after 300 Chinese Canadians served in WWI, racially charged oppression continued with the Chinese Immigration (Exclusion) Act, which banned immigration from China 1923 - 1947. This act laid the foundation for Chinese Canadians to be treated like second-class citizens. Then during WWII, Chinese Canadians born on Canadian soil were eager to enlist, but faced rejection due to race. So they volunteered - VOLUNTEERED - out of loyalty to their country and a belief it would help secure their community's right to vote. Japanese Canadians fought in WWI in hopes that they would also secure equal rights, like the right to vote. But by WWII, thousands ended up being sent to internment camps, and thousands more were deported because of a government assumption that their racial origins meant they would be disloyal to Canada. Despite this treatment, 160 Japanese Canadians joined the army and served. Sikh soldiers built an impressive international reputation serving the British army in the 1800s. Upon arrival to Canada, they were barred from entering military or police service, their voting rights were stripped, and in 1908 all South Asians were denied entry to the country. Despite all of these unjust experiences, South Asian Canadians continued to serve in every major conflict since, and continue to serve even until this day. I commemorate their enduring resilience and thank them for paving the way for my equal rights, my ability to vote, and for their demonstration of the never-ending commitment to building a just and equitable world. Our lives are forever changed thanks to their sacrifice. #RemembranceDay #AsianCanadianVeterans #DiversityInService #CanadianMilitaryLegacy #LestWeForget #LinkedInReflections Ascend Canada, Federation of Asian Canadian Lawyers BC,\n\nSo‚Ä¶India and Canada are having a bit of a row over the assassination of a Canadian Sikh leader. Most of you are at least aware of this by now, so I won‚Äôt delve too deep into the facts. Instead, I want to analyze why India has complicated relations with the Sikh, as well as how this affects both nations and their allies. First things first. Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has accused the Indian government of orchestrating the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, near Vancouver. Diplomatic chaos ensued as both nations expelled each other‚Äôs diplomats, India suspended visa processing for Canadian citizens and negotiations for a free trade deal between the nations was interrupted. India denies Trudeaus‚Äôs claims, arguing that this is an attempt to shift blame from the fact that Canada harbors ‚ÄòSikh extremists‚Äô. The term is used by Indian authorities to designate members of the Khalistan movement - a minority within the Sikh community that advocates for the independence of the state of Punjab and the founding of the Sikh nation of Khalistan. A group of Khalistanis rampaged through Punjab in the 1980s, leaving many dead civilians in their wake. The Indian government has since labeled the movement a terrorist organization and seeks to arrest its members, many of which live in Canada. The north american country chooses to uphold the Khalistani right to freedom of expression; a decision that India fervently condemns. In a rare show of unity, it seems like most of India‚Äôs media and political groups are throwing their weight behind the government‚Äôs stance. This is a sign of anti-western sentiment brewing within the country. Furthermore, it seems to me like a dangerous scenario for the Sikh population, who may face widespread discrimination and persecution. The diplomatic row is particularly troubling for the United States of America. On one hand, they are close allies with Canada and wish to remain friendly neighbors. On the other, the US seeks closer ties with India, both to pry the Asian country away from Russian influence and to challenge China‚Äôs hegemony over the region. So far, the US has shared intelligence with Canada regarding the murder, but urges the countries to settle the matter cordially. India is perceived as somewhat of a maverick on the international stage. They buy goods and weapons from Russia and Nato countries simultaneously, for example. Everybody wants to be friends with the most populated country on earth for one reason or another, and I think India masterfully plays this to their advantage. However, if the accusations prove true, It may signal that New Delhi is willing to act more roguish in dealing with their dissidents. #India #Canada #Sikh #diplomacy #news #international Vitor Marroni - Original Article\n\nTwo years of #Taliban: India's Diplomatic Odyssey In the labyrinth of #Afghanistan's recent history, the two years under #Taliban rule have triggered both concern and intrigue. The article you're about to explore goes deep into #India's diplomatic challenges in this ever-evolving landscape. Imagine a nation where dreams of #genderequality and #women's education have receded into the horizon, where public life bears the mark of gender imbalance, and where the #Hijab is no longer a personal choice but a mandated garment. Afghanistan's journey under the Taliban has been marked by somber notes. Their non serious approach to #UNSC Resolution 2593, emphasizing inclusivity and women's participation, invites contemplation. A #humanitarian crisis looms large, with 15 million facing food insecurity, 20% grappling with mental health issues, and a staggering 4 million dealing with addiction. Access to basic healthcare remains a distant dream. India's role in Afghanistan transcends mere diplomacy, it's a cornerstone of regional strategy. Before the #Taliban's resurgence, #India supported over 500 projects, fostering progress across sectors. A tangible symbol of their shared democratic aspirations is the #Afghan Parliament in Kabul. The resurgence of the Taliban signals the unraveling of two decades of painstaking diplomatic efforts and collaboration. India's historical bond with #Afghanistan, once severed, was rekindled through substantial development assistance. Today, India offers vital humanitarian aid, serving as a lifeline amidst the chaos. Diplomatically, India cautiously engages with the Taliban, recognizing the ever-shifting sands in Afghanistan. As India navigates this intricate landscape, it demonstrates resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to global peace. The full article on our website unveils this compelling diplomatic journey.
