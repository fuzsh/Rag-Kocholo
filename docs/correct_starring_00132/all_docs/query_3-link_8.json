It is a good movie, but you have to remember it isn't as comedic and\n\nsatirical as 'Rats and Clerks.\n\n> So Randal is Brodies cousin, judging by the fact that they have the\n\n> same perverted Cousin Walter.

Why didn't he play Dante, is it\n\n> some rule by Kevin Smith?\n\nBrian O'Halloran <sp?> is the guy who played Dante. In 'Rats he played Gil\n\nHicks, who is probably meant to be Dante Hicks' cousin. He didn't play\n\nDante, however. In the scheme of the movie's chronology, Dante was probably\n\ntrying to patch things up with Veronica and comfort Caitlin; ergo, his\n\ncharacter was unavalible for 'Rats.\n\n> They both mentioned that girl (forgot her name) who died in the\n\n> swimming pool.

So long and SNOOTCHIE BOOTCHIES!\n\nWell, Joey Lauren Adams (who played Gwen in 'Rats) returns as Alyssa, the\n\nobject of Ben Affleck's affections. She is Tricia Jones' (Trish the Dish\n\nfrom 'Rats) sister. There are refernces also to Brandy Svenning (T.S.'\n\ngirlfriend in 'Rats) and Rick Derris, as well as a brief mention of Julie\n\nDwyer, and a few references to Clerks and Caitlin's institutionlization.\n\nThat's all that I can think of off the top of my head, but I think that there\n\nare a few more scattered references to 'Rats and Clerks. Many of these\n\nhappen pretty early-on in the movie, shortly after Affleck's character\n\n(Holden) meets Joey Lauren Adams' character (Alyssa).\n\n> \"All it took was a phat chronic blunt!\"\n\n> JAY.

They could be older, but all the related characters suggest\n\nthey're not. (Cohee, Derris, Julie Dwyer, Brandi, Gwen)\n\nYou guys also forgot a few crossovers. Most people won't accept the fact that\n\nthe two Willams are indeed the same character, but Kev has said that they are.\n\nAlso, In Amy, there are two easy-to miss crossovers. Outside of the Hockey\n\nrink, Alyssa admits to Holden about having sex with Shannon Hamilton and Gwen\n\nTurner, the two characters Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams played in\n\nMallrats.

And I was personally disappointed by Banky\n\nmainly BECAUSE he was such a homophobe. Like Brodie and Randal, Banky was\n\nmore or less the obnoxious smart-ass, but Banky was too hatefilled to be\n\ngenuinely funny.\n\nAnd yeah, Jay & SB could have had a better role. I remember hearing that\n\nthey had a great scene in \"Amy\" but unfortunately, that scene came much too\n\nlate into the movie. I missed \"Clerks\" and \"'Rats\" because Jay and S&B had\n\nmuch more screen time and were involved in a lot of the comedy. But still,\n\nit was a great scene.\n\n> Still, at least it didn't have a pat-happy ending in the way Mallrats did,\n\n> and it was still a very funny and touching (without being touchy-feely)\n\n> movie.\n\nWell, Mallrats was concieved to be a lighthearted comedy.
