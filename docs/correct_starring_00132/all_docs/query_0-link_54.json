        "text": "Jason Mewes, who starred as Jay in Clerks and other Kevin Smith films, has a cameo role in Nexus Game Studios' point-and-click \"geek\" adventure game Randal’s Monday.\n\nMewes' reprises his role as Jay from the films, and Silent Bob (who was played by Kevin Smith) will also appear in the game to hang out with Jay.\n\nAnother Clerks star, Jeff Anderson who played Randal Graves in the film, will also lend his voice to the game’s protagonist, who just so happens to be Randal.\n\n\"We are over the moon now also having Jason on board”, said lead producer Enric Costa. “It’s a real dream coming true. Our homage to Clerks and classic adventure games now gets support not only from one big star of the American Independent Cinema, but from two.\n\n\"That’s more than we ever hoped for.\"\n\nRandal's Monday is being developed as tribute to \"the golden age of geek culture\" and includes nostalgic themes pertaining to retro-consoles, various TV shows and games from the 80s, 90s, and the early 2000's.\n\nThe game will be released worldwide this fall on PC and Mac."
