        "text": "Fans of Kevin Smith flicks like \"Clerks\" and \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" have a reason to swing by Branson next year.\n\nActor Jason Mewes, who formed the \"Jay\" half of the Jay and Silent Bob duo beloved by fans of the darkly comic \"View Asknewniverse\" movies created by director Smith in the '90s and early 2000s, is set to appear at Branson Con 2019 sometime between March 8 and 10.\n\nThat's when Branson Con 2019 is happening at Branson Convention Center, according to an announcement posted to Facebook Monday afternoon.\n\nTickets for the convention are on sale at BransonComicCon.com.\n\nRELATED:Val Kilmer postpones Branson visit to promote his Mark Twain movie\n\nOrganizers wrote that Branson Con 2019 will host more than 20 special guests including VIP appearances and \"pop culture enthusiasts, actors, cosplayers, and music and TV personalities.\"\n\n\"Clerks\" is a 1994 black-and-white independent film chronicling a miserable day experienced by a 22-year-old convenience store clerk in a New Jersey town.\n\nSmith made \"Clerks\" for about $25,000, but it earned much more in theaters and on video, allowing Smith to write or direct other films such as \"Mallrats,\" \"Chasing Amy,\" \"Dogma\" and even \"Clerks II,\" which according to the Internet Movie Database received an 8-minute standing ovation when it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMewes, the actor visiting Branson, played Jay (trademark phrase: \"snootchie bootchies\"), who spent much of his time in the \"Clerks\" movies selling marijuana in front of the movie's convenience store alongside the ever-present but utterly wordless Silent Bob, played by Smith."
