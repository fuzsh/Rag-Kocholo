        "text": "About a month or so ago, Kevin Smith revealed that he and Jason Mewes would be playing Jay and Silent Bob again. Now, while he still has The 4:30 Movie coming, potentially this year, he’s also officially announced the next project that he has planned. One can only presume that our editor Joey Magidson is very excited.\n\nAccording to Smith himself, there’s a new Jay and Silent Bob film coming this year, or at least going into production this year. Not only that, he’s apparently nearly finished a first draft, which will feature the characters in an escalating war in the New Jersey legal marijuana business. It certainly seems like a good fit for Smith.\n\nHere is what he had to say in an email to fans, entitled “A message from Kevin Smith about Jay and Silent Bob turning 30 and what comes next…”\n\nSource: Kevin Smith"
