        "text": "Mallrats\n\nWhile our allotment of advance tickets has sold out online, some additional tickets will be available to purchase at the door on a first come, first served basis on the night of the show. Box office & doors open approximately 1 hour before showtime. For shows that have sold out online, in-person ticket purchases are limited to 2 tickets per person.\n\nFrom Kevin Smith, the acclaimed director of Clerks, comes this outrageous story of two loafers, Jeremy London and Jason Lee, who spend way too much time hanging out at the mall. When Brodie (Lee) is dumped by his girlfriend, Shannen Doherty, he retreats to the mall with his best friend T.S. (London), whose girlfriend has also left him. Between brooding and visits to the food court, the unmotivated twosome decide to win their girlfriends back with the help of the ultimate delinquents, Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) and Jay (Jason Mewes), whose continuing adventures take the word “nuisance” to a whole new level.

In his Sundance sensation feature filmmaking debut, writer-director Kevin Smith provides a very funny look at over-the-counter culture, following a day in the life of two wisecracking slackers – a convenience store clerk and his best friend at the video store next door – while they talk, play hockey, and annoy customers.\n\n“Cheap, touching, and downright nasty, Kevin Smith’s first feature still remains the ultimate cinematic tribute to slackers.” – Chris Barsanti, Slant Magazine\n\n“Smith shows great invention, a natural feel for human comedy, and a knack for writing weird, sometimes brilliant, dialogue.” – Roger Ebert\n\nDirector\n\nKevin Smith\n\nWriter\n\nKevin Smith\n\nStarring\n\nBrian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonauer, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith\n\nYear\n\n1994\n\nCountry\n\nUSA\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nRunning Time\n\n92 minutes"
