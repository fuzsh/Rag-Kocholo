        "text": "Cinema icon Jason Mewes is best known as the potty-mouthed vocal half of Jay and Silent Bob, the on- screen comedic duo who first appeared in Kevin Smith’s seminal 1994 indie film CLERKS. Mewes would reprise the character five more times on the big screen from 1995 to 2006, becoming a sort of James Bond of mid-90’s low budget film—a fast talking, foul-mouthed, over-sexed but ultimately harmless and likable guy. Bugs Bunny with a boner.\n\nBut it’s in the insanely popular award-winning podcast “Jay & Silent Bob Get Old” where Mewes truly shines. For nearly seven years, in what’s been described as “Lake Wobegon days with anal jokes”, Jason has told the story of his tumultuous life on stage every week.\n\nWednesday, May 24\n\nWith special guest AJ Wilkerson\n\nDoors 6:15 pm | Show 7:00 pm *Start time subject to change.

Sorry, Rio Theatre Groupons and passes n/a for this event.\n\nPerhaps best known “Jay”, the foul-mouthed foil to hetero-lifemate “Silent Bob” in Kevin Smith’s View Askewnivere, Jason Mewes has blossomed into a full-blown pop culture icon since his debut in 1994’s CLERKS! Mewes would reprise his role as the celebrated\n\ncharacter five more times on the big screen from 1995 to 2006, in films including MALLRATS, CHASING AMY, DOGMA, ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO, and JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK. His character would become a sort of James Bond of the mid-90’s low budget film – a fast talking, foul-mouthed, over-sexed, but ultimately harmless and likeable guy. For his successful and brow- raising portrayal, MTV honored him with 2007’s Dirtiest Mouth Award.\n\nWith cult-fans following his controversial antics, Mewes has captured audiences with hisrebellious banter against his unspoken other half and longtime friend, Kevin Smith(Silent Bob). Since the beginning of the duo’s offbeat work together, Mewes and Smith\n\nhave continued to build on their beloved character driven roles from the Jay and Silent Bob series. The duo returned in 2019, along with a star-studded cast in JAY AND SILENT BOB REBOOT. The film pokes fun at the entertainment business, at remakes,\n\nsequels, and reboots, but also includes a more personal tale of what it’s like for Jay to become a father. A sequel to the 2001 parody, JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK, the duo embarks on a cross-country mission to stop Hollywood from filming a reboot of\n\n‘Bluntman and Chronic’ from getting made. JAY AND SILENT BOB REBOOT is the first movie to have per-screen averages over $60,000 four different times in its domestic run.\n\nJay made his directorial debut on a film titled MADNESS IN THE METHOD, which was released in select theaters, on demand and digitally in August 2019. The film follows a fictionalized version of Mewes as he tries to change Hollywood’s perception of him. Upon advice from best friend Kevin Smith, Mewes tracks down a secret method acting book to reinvent himself as a serious actor – with disastrous consequences! The film has a star-studded cast, including Danny Trejo, Terri Hatcher, and Stan Lee, making his\n\nfinal screen appearance. The film is dedicated in his memory.\n\nJay can be seen touring comedy clubs across the country with his solo show, “A-Mewes-ing Stories,” where he shares stories about his life and encounters over the years.\n\nThe duo has also built a cult following with their insanely popular, award-winning podcast, Jay & Silent Bob Get Old. For over eight years, in what’s been described as “Lake Wobegon says with anal jokes,” Jay has told the story of his tumultuous life. To date, the podcast has completed over 235 episodes and has been named one of the best on iTunes. Jay and Kevin’s 25 year creative partnership was recently recognized in when they had their hands and feet immortalized in the cement at the TCL Chinese Theater.\n\nOutside of his work with Smith, Mewes has starred in the Wunderkind Pictures feature, NOOBZ, an indie “gamers” film about four friends and Gears of Wars players who embark on a quest to survive a road trip and win a Gamecon Championship. Mewes\n\nalso appeared in the film, ROCK JOCKS, about a group of dysfunctional government employees who find themselves responsible for shooting down an asteroid on track for the Earth. In 2010, he appeared in the mobster comedy, THE LAST GODFATHER, alongside Harvey Keitel Most recently, he has guest starred on several television series including The Flash, Supergirl, Hawaii 5-0 and Z Nation.\n\nToday, fans and gamers alike can keep up with Mewes’ daily musings while he streamshis virtual video game escapades via Twitch! If you frequent the world of Fortnite, you may even get the chance to play with Jay himself. 2022 also provided the opportunity to see Mewes return to the big screen as he makes his triumphant return to the role of Jayin Kevin Smith’s CLERKS III."
