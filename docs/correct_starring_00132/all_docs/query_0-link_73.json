        "text": "Jason Mewes: Sporting Iowa ink\n\nJason Mewes rose to fame as Jay, the stoner and talkative half of the Jay & Silent Bob duo from Kevin Smith’s New Jersey-set movies like “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy.” But Mewes is always carrying a bit of Iowa with him.\n\n“I got a tattoo while I was in Iowa,” Mewes said during a phone interview with the Register. “I did a Q&A there many years ago and the guy putting it on also owned a tattoo shop. It was definitely a good five years ago or so.”\n\nIt’s on his left shoulder; you can Google it or watch “Zack & Miri Make a Porno” to see it, along with a lot more of Mewes.\n\nMewes’ visit to Des Moines also coincides with his 41st birthday, but don’t expect things to get too crazy for the actor. He’s been sober for several years after battling addictions. So don’t offer him any pot; his character Jay even gave it up in “Clerks II.” Mewes said his celebration might just consist of seeing “Jurassic World” in the theater.\n\nMewes attended his first comic book convention as a teenager, but it was a low key affair in a church basement with vendors selling comics, toys and statues. His first experience at a big con was the San Diego Comic Con in the late 90’s.\n\n“People were dressed up and there were all these different things going on; it was exciting,” Mewes said. “Not to mention it was right after ‘Mallrats’ and ‘Clerks,’ so it was the first time people were coming up to me and saying ‘Hey, you’re that guy!’\n\nMewes will sign pretty much anything you bring to him. He said he regularly signs peoples’ body parts, only to see people get them tattooed on permanently. The most memorable item was a ceramic bong shaped like male genitalia. Don’t worry, even if he doesn’t partake anymore, Mewes will still sign your (surely for tobacco use only) smoking device.\n\nLooking ahead, Mewes is set to appear in Smith’s “Mallrats 2” and “Clerks III” and he co-hosts a podcast with Smith, “Jay & Silent Bob Get Old.” Smith and Mewes will hit the road for an Australian tour with the podcast later this year. Beyond that, he’s looking to do some TV acting (Mewes is a voracious binge watcher) and hopes to direct a feature film in the not too distant future.\n\nMewes has grown up from the teenager that inspired the Jay character, but said Jay is still about “60/40” him.\n\n“When I was younger, that’s how I acted. The character was obnoxious and speaks his mind because that’s how I am,” Mewes said. “As I got older, I had to learn when not to speak my mind because I couldn’t always get away with saying the things I did when I was younger. My life changed; I struggled with drugs, got married and couldn’t be as flirty. Stuff like that. I had to start growing up, if you will. Well, as much as I can.”\n\nWizard World Des Moines\n\nWhen: 3-8 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWhere: Iowa Events Center, 730 Third St.\n\nCost: $35 Friday, $45 Saturday, $40 Sunday"
