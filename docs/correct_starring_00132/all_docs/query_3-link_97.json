        "text": "It's been 13 years since Jay and Silent Bob appeared in a live-action movie, and so Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, who have played the characters on and off since 1994, are pulling out all the stops ahead of Jay & Silent Bob Reboot. To promote their on-screen comeback and reintroduce the world to the two most famous weed dealers in the View Askewniverse, Smith and Mewes have released three new strains of cannabis.\n\n\"After 25 years of being fake weed dealers, it feels nice to be real weed dealers,\" Smith told The Hollywood Reporter during the launch of the new strains at Herbarium Recreation Dispensary in West Hollywood. The three strains were created in collaboration with Caviar Gold, and each is named after a catchphrase from Smith's movies: Snoogans, Snoochie and Berzerker.\n\nThe new movie also marks the first appearance of a much slimmer, healthier-looking Silent Bob: Smith lost more than 50 pounds after changing his diet and lifestyle following a heart attack in 2018. When filming on Jay & Silent Bob Reboot was due to begin earlier this year, Smith intentionally chose the same date as his heart attack \"to celebrate the fact that I did not become Silent Bob forever 365 days ago.\"\n\nSmith conceived of Jay and Silent Bob as background characters in Clerks, which went on to become something of a cult classic. The pair then went on to reappear in comedy Mallrats, romantic comedy drama Chasing Amy, and religious satire Dogma before finally getting their own movie, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back. They popped up again in Clerks II, and even went on an animated adventure in Jay & Silent Bob's Super Groovy Cartoon Movie in 2006. And now they're poised to win over a whole new generation of stoner cinephiles.\n\n\"I think it has everything to do with Jason Mewes,\" Smith said of the characters' long-lasting appeal in pop culture. \"He’s one of the most original people I’ve ever met and people respond to him in this weird way... There’s a familiarity to him and a comfort factor to him and there’s something to be said for being around for a quarter century. People are like 'oh, you’re still here?' But if you last long enough people are like 'hey, good to see you again.'\"\n\nJay & Silent Bob Reboot will be released on October 15."
