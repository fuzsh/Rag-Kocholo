        "text": "The Lexicon of Love, Pt. 1\n\nThe night of Kevin Smith's movie premiere, Paige finds herself on the cutting room floor, then finds solace on the dance floor with Alex, then finds herself in Alex's bedroom, then finds her lips in the last place she ever expected. Now she can't deny that it happened, but she can deny that she liked it. For a little while, at least, until she figures out whether or not she did. Meanwhile, Snake's lips slither onto someone that they're not married to, and it might cost him his family.\n\nGoin' Down the Road, Pt. 1\n\nKevin Smith takes over Degrassi to shoot his new movie Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh! and hires Craig to write some music. Things finally seem to be coming together for Craig. This would not be a good time for Ashley to tell him that she's moving to England. Oops. Meanwhile, Caitlin doubts her relationship with Joey. This would not be a good time for Kevin Smith to be macking on her. Oops.\n\nThe Runaway Dinosaur\n\nWith Barry gone, the team must figure out a way to handle the return of an old enemy - Girder. Realizing Girder is retracing his steps from his last attack, Iris volunteers to act as bait to trap him in S.T.A.R. Labs. Meanwhile, Barry fights to return to his old life."
