        "text": "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is turning 20. The buddy comedy, director Kevin Smith’s fifth movie, landed in theaters on April 24, 2001.\n\n“For us to get our own movie, to have my character’s name in the title and be one of the leading characters was so surreal,” recalled Jason Mewes, aka Jay. “The entire last 25 years have been crazy because when we did Clerks, I didn’t plan on making movies. After we filmed it and it came out, it was like, ‘Oh cool, we made a movie, and people are going to see it,’ but I went back to my roofing job.”\n\n“It wasn’t until Mallrats that I said to myself, ‘Oh, man. You’re making a studio movie.’ It hit me. Each time we get to do another movie and play the characters, it’s so awesome. Now here we are talking about Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, a really special movie, and I’ve just come off the set of the third Clerks movie.”\n\nMewes is currently back in his native New Jersey with writer-director Smith, Silent Bob himself. The pair are a few weeks into shooting the threequel.\n\nMade for $22 million, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back grossed $33.8 million. When the titular characters find out that a comic based on them, Bluntman and Chronic, is being turned into a Hollywood movie and they won’t make any money from it, they hit the road to try and wreck the film.\n\nDid Hollywood push back?\n\n“Luckily, people love the little digs at Hollywood and stuff,” explained Mewes. “If there are higher-ups in the studios that Kevin has run across, I don’t know, but nothing that I heard of. I mean, they still talk to him. When it comes to pushback, the only thing that stands out to me like that was when Kevin did Dogma and Red State. That was because of religious stuff. It isn’t from Hollywood people. “\n\nOne of the most memorable things about Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back remains the ensemble cast and plethora of cameos from Ben Affleck and Will Ferrell to Shannon Elizabeth, Shannen Doherty, and Carrie Fisher. As with a lot of Smith’s work, the movie is like a time capsule of pop culture and nerd culture.\n\n“I’m not sure who Kevin reached out,” Mewes recalled. “We got most people, and the movie was a bunch of cool cameos. Most people he reached out to said yes, showed up and hung out, and wanted to do the movie, which was great. They wanted to be involved. I never thought about any of the movies being time capsules when we made them, but it is true.”\n\n“I get reminded constantly by people that these movies mark moments in people’s lives. People say to me, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m so excited about Clerks III, but Mallrats is my favorite because that’s when my kid was born. I related so much with the Brody character and my relationship.’ People relate to each character. I had no idea that they’d be these time capsules. About a week ago and a woman, about 60 or 70 years old, came up and wanted to tell me how much she loves our movies. She showed them to her daughter when then showed them to her kids.”\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back was a personal milestone moment for Mewes as he explained, “I had just gotten out of rehab. I was focusing on my staying sober, so I could do the movie the best I could.”\n\nAs well as the memories of the movie, Mewes kept a souvenir or two. “Most of the stuff is in the store, Jay & Silent Bob’s Secret Stash, here in New Jersey. I think the only thing I have at home is my chair back,” the actor explained. “I like to keep those. I’ve given a couple away for charity events and stuff, but I have one at home.”\n\n“Even now, I just came from the comic book store because I was going to do the interviews there. I was looking around, and there’s memorabilia from all our movies, shirts, action figures, and stuff, and that makes me stop and pause for a second. Talking about a movie we made 20 years, it’s crazy.”\n\nEven Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back’s anniversary couldn’t distract the actor from looking forward and Clerks III.\n\n“I think it definitely works, and things are going well,” he enthused, almost as if he couldn’t quite believe what he was part of. “I think Kevin, and I’m not just saying this because he’s like a brother to me, is super clever at bringing in things from other movies and tying it all together. There are some awesome things that Kevin has weaved in that people will remember.”\n\n“There’s Brian O’Halloran as Dante and Jeff Anderson as Randal, of course. I’ll be on set one day and shoot two scenes, and I might be done for the day, but when I’m there, watching them, it seems like we did Clerks and Clerks II two years ago. They’re right back into it. A couple of other characters are coming back, and it has all just fallen into place. Kevin edits himself, so at the weekend, he’s sitting there editing scenes. I’ve already got to see some of them. They’re rough scenes, but they’re looking amazing. On Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, on the last couple days of shooting, we got to sit down and watch about 80 percent of the movie as a rough cut with music and everything.”\n\n“What’s cool is that my wife’s there on set right now,” Mews concluded. “Kevin started working on my wife on some stuff a few years ago, she was helping out, and then he suggested starting a business together. She has produced the last three movies. Now we get to travel together and bring our six-year-old daughter, so it’s a family affair. This journey has turned into something amazing.”"
