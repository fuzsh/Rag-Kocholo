        "text": "Jason Mewes recently opened up about his substance addiction over the years and shared one particularly sad story that involved his best pal, filmmaker Kevin Smith.\n\nCurrently sober for 11 years, the actor spoke candidly about his battle on the latest episode of Steve-O’s Wild Ride! podcast.\n\nMewes is best known for appearing in several of Smith’s films as half of the iconic Jay and Silent Bob duo. Mewes first played the character in Clerks, Smith’s 1994 black-and-white comedy that launched his career.\n\nBy Mewes’ account, Smith likely saved his life by forcing him to get sober several times, both for his health and so he could appear in Smith’s films, including Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.\n\nTelling Jackass star Steve-O, a fellow recovering addict, that he hit rock bottom a few times, one moment in particular stood out, which took place years ago on Thanksgiving.\n\n“I remember me and him sitting out in front of his house, and he’s crying, saying, ‘I want to let you in, but the whole family is here,'” Mewes said. “And I had a tank-top on, and I had track marks. And he’s like, ‘I can’t have you see them like that.’ And I’m like, ‘I can’t come in for a plate of Thanksgiving dinner?’ And he’s like, ‘You can’t. Here, I am going to bring you some food.’ That was the first time I got sober for a while.”\n\nMewes explained that Smith never judged him or made him feel inferior during his struggles. Smith also paid for treatments, Mewes said, explaining that his friend solely wanted him to get clean and be a member of the family.\n\n“All the trouble I had, I had Kevin’s support and I know that made a big difference in the outcome of everything,” Mewes said.\n\nWatch the full segment below."
