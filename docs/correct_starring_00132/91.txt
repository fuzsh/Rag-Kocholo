Jason Mewes has been playing Jay, the long-haired, rail-thin vulgar mouthpiece for his weed-slingin buddy Silent Bob for over 20 years now. The unlikely comedy duo, who have appeared in well over half a dozen movies, are the Gen-X slacker version of Laurel & Hardy. As the mid-90s comedy classic Mallrats turns 20 years old this year, Fandomfest is bringing Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith to Louisville for a screening of the film and to do a live Q&A/podcast recording afterward. Mewes took some time while on vacation in Hawaii to chat with us about Mallrats and more.

LEO: Whats your most vivid memory of shooting "Mallrats"?

Jason Mewes: Shooting that movie was one of my favorites. The whole situation is kind of surreal. Clerks was the first movie we shot; Mallrats was the first studio movie we did. So, we were getting paid to go to another state, stay in a hotel, wake up and go to the mall every day. And I got to work with Stan Lee, Priscilla Barnes and Shannon Doherty. I dont know  the whole experience was surreal and I had a blast. But, one experience that really stands out is going up to Priscilla Barnes room. Kevin had to go up there to talk to her about a scene or something. He wound up leaving, so me and her got to talking a little bit. Eventually I told her that as a kid I used to spank to Threes Company. I didnt know how she would react, you know? I was 20 years old and didnt really care, but she laughed about it. It couldve gone very wrong.

LEO: Does it seem like its been 20 years?

JM: It doesnt. That seems like such a long time. I mean, it does feel like its been a good many years since we shot it, but 20 years seems like a long time. It seems more like ten years ago, or eight years ago.

LEO: Is it strange going back and looking at that version of yourself?

JM: I mean, it is with pictures and everything, going back when we do stuff, looking at how I looked at sounded doing Mallrats and then how I looked and sounded in Chasing Amy then Dogma. It is definitely strange to go back. But its also nice, because I kinda got to capture the last 20 years of my life on film.

LEO: Do you ever watch the movies and critique your performance?

JM: Definitely. But I dont usually ever watch the movies again. I mean, I watch them at the premieres and stuff. But sometimes Ill be at a friends house and theyll come on cable or something. And, even if its something I did six months ago, or a year ago, Im constantly watching and critiquing myself and I hate it, which is why I dont like critiquing other people either. Recently, a friend of mine was just on a show, and shes a really good actress, but I didnt really like it. But I dont think Im a good actor at all, so who am I to be telling other people what I think about their acting? Theyre better than I am. If you notice on the Clerks poster, theres no Jay and Bob. Kevins on it but hes dressed as Kevin Smith, the director. But the studio didnt think anything of Jay and Bob. They were more focused on the movie  and Dante and Randal. I remember Mallrats started screening for press and there was a guy at a paper who wrote, You wonder what rock Jay crawled out from under. So people started talking about them around Mallrats, but it wasnt really until Chasing Amy that people kinda loved them.

LEO: How is Mallbrats (the upcoming sequel to Mallrats) coming along?

JM: The script is amazing. I dont know how its going with shooting and everything, but I know its moving forward. They dont really keep me in the loop or anything. Ill hear a little from Kevin because I see him all of the time and were on the road so much together. But, when it comes to these movies, theres so much politics involved with who owns rights and stuff, and financing, and of these things that are a little over my head, to be honest. Everything just seems to be moving forward.
