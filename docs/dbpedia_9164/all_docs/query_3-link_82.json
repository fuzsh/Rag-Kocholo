        "meta_description": "After Michael T. Workmanâ€™s father suffers a stroke, he returns home to Missoula to spend time with his aging father, Tim. Struggling with memory loss, Tim reflects on a difficult past while remembering previous chapters of life as a father teaching his young son to ski. Against the backdrop of a snowy Montana winter, Workman and his father spend more time on eternity, single parenting and the fragility of life while raising his young daughter and finding time to make art. This rich human story celebrates resilience, creativity and joy in the face of adversity. Colorado Premiere",
