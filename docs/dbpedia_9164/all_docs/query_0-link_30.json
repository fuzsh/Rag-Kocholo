Only the mother Mavis is working; father Frank and the couple's two sons Colin, a timid, chronically shy individual and Mark, an outspoken, headstrong young man, are on the dole. This situation is contrasted by the presence of Mavis's sister Barbara, and her husband John, whose financial and social loftiness appears to be a comfortable facade over the unspoken soreness of a lackluster marriage.",

        "text": "It was whilst taking a bath during the making of his Play for Today, Home Sweet Home, that Mike Leigh heard a news report on the radio about two brothers in Warrington or Wigan (Leigh can't quite remember) who had committed suicide together due to unemployment. In that moment, Leigh knew he had to make Meantime.\n\nOn its release it was rather criticised by the left as wasting a big opportunity to properly attack Thatcherism. Undeniably there was most definitely a film to be made representing the tragic fate of those two young siblings, but it would arguably have been a Ken Loach or an Alan Clarke film as opposed to a Mike Leigh film. To dismiss Meantime as somehow…\n\nThe point where Mike Leigh was able to take the heavily improvised, frequently comedic television plays about the British working-class he'd been honing for a decade and merge them with the casually harrowing emotional sensitivity and gritty kitchen sink realism stylization he had clearly been building towards. Observing the bleak, barren, and confused existence of a depressed and impoverished East End family (and a few neighborhood punks) as they listlessly wander the streets, flats, pubs, laundromats, and unemployment offices of Thatcher-era austerity. Leigh is obviously very good at generating authentic environments for actors to find poetry in minute calibrations of mundane situations/behavior (and this has two excellent early performances from a very young Tim Roth and Gary Oldman), but he…\n\nIn Meantime, Mike Leigh created a stark vision of Thatcher's 80's Britain. A beaten-down and dysfunctional Britain portrayed by an incredible cast packed with the very best of British.\n\nWith characterless concrete buildings full of angry young men and women alongside the symmetrical little boxes of suburbia, the film presents a careful balance that acknowledges the political noises of the time while avoiding becoming an outwardly 'political film' by staying focused on human relationships.\n\nI grew up as an 80s kid, leaving school to go into a Youth Training Scheme and watching as many of my schoolmates went on the the dole. This was a tough time to be in Northern England, with a constant stream of negative news, union-led…\n\nMeantime is an obvious but apt homonym. A title denoting the no man’s land of time which stretches between certainties in its ever-opiating malaise. More importantly, it addresses the undercurrent of hostility which bubbled to the surface during the decade of Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. Unemployment queues snaking. Serpentine in their shamed formation. The Prime Minister’s dispassionate shadow cast across a nation, leaving millions in the lurch. Amongst the milieu of societal depravation and social dysfunction we find the Pollocks - A working class family suffering the desolate, debilitating chill of early 80s Britain.\n\nDomestic tensions exist from the off: The state of the country wearing inexorably heavily on each of the family’s shoulders. Despite scraping by together, they turn on…\n\nMaggie's in the Mud: 80s and 90s British Cinema Project\n\nOf course, one of the most prevalent themes in British cinema in the 80s and 90s was the plight of the working classes under Thatcherism and its aftermath.\n\nMeantime may seem to be just one of many of that ilk but Mike Leigh has always been so good at picking out some of the unseen effects that it had. Here, it's how families are turned against each other.\n\nWhen Tim Roth gets offered a job by his aunt (albeit under a somewhat questionable motive), his family, all of whom are jobless, aren't happy for him. There's jealousy instead of joy and, ultimately, disappointment when said job never quite materialises. But…\n\nthis really killed me... like really fucking killed me. jesus christ.\n\ni could literally pick out any character and name someone i know who’s exactly like them, so surreal.\n\nand the fact that some of these scenes were filmed up the road from where i’m sitting right now...\n\nthis is one of my new favourites, just for the complete and utter accuracy of it, it’s almost too accurate, too scary to see it as a painting of what has been and what has scarred for eternity.\n\n....\n\nalienation at the hands of a government that takes no consideration for you. in turn, it allows people to fall into a trap of emptiness, not having enough in their lives to care.…"
