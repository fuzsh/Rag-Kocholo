In that moment, Leigh knew he had to make Meantime.\n\nOn its release it was rather criticised by the left as wasting a big opportunity to properly attack Thatcherism. Undeniably there was most definitely a film to be made representing the tragic fate of those two young siblings, but it would arguably have been a Ken Loach or an Alan Clarke film as opposed to a Mike Leigh film. To dismiss Meantime as somehow apolitical as a result would be tremendously foolish. What Leigh does is take the essence of that real life inspiration and craft a story that is far less black and white but no less damning of the situation at the time, with Auntie Barbara's offering to the simple-minded Colin of a job decorating her bedroom in effect a satire of the uselessness of the government's YTS scheme.\n\nIn conclusion, Meantime is a deeply political film that is angry on its own terms but offers just a chink of light at the end of the tunnel. These brothers are going to be OK, but others clearly will not be. If you're looking to see just what life in Britain in the 1980s was like, then Meantime is as good a place to start as any."
