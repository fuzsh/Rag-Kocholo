        "text": "Working for the first time in collaboration with Channel 4, through Meantime Mike Leigh offers another portrait of Britain that focuses on a particular family unit. Made in 1983, it centers on brothers Mark and Colin (two excellent performances from Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) who are unemployed, living at home with their parents and trying to make ends meet.\n\nWhat on the surface seems a fractious relationship slowly develops into something much more moving. Reflecting Leighâ€™s ability to cast some of the best performing talents of the day, here he includes Pam Ferris, Alfred Molina and Gary Oldman.\n\nWith thanks to the BFI National TV Archive."
