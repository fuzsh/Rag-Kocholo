He is expecting his girlfriend Louise who is supposed to come and join him soon, but she is late showing up. Marc is keen on keeping fit and becomes obsessed with the healthy daily routine he has set up for himself, but the silence grows heavier and heavier, and Louise hasn’t arrived yet. In the anxious surrounding calm, Marc gradually falls prey to the assault of all kinds of sounds that are usually ignored and sounds that are not usually heard.\n\nAbout the Director\n\nGuillaume Scaillet graduated from the screenwriting department of La Fémis and now works on projects as a writer and director. He’s currently writing the script of his first feature JEANNE DARK produced by Caïmans Productions. He also works as a scriptwriter and consultant on diverse movies and series projects."
