        "text": "MEET THE FILMMAKER: Friday June 14, 6.50pm. Join Nicholas Anthony (director), Bronte Charlotte (producer/ actor) and Domenica Garrett (actor) for a post-film Q&A.\n\nChannelling Frances Ha via the French New Wave and shot on an iPhone 13 Pro Max, Nicholas Anthony’s debut feature is a cinema verité trip centred on Max, fast-approaching her thirties, and doing her best to deflect the existential crisis she perpetually runs headfirst into. An aspiring writer, she keeps hitting roadblocks and the wheels are coming off. Living with her best friend Emma affords her some sense of stability, but why is everyone else catching a break when she’s stuck in second gear? As the year passes by, Max finds it harder and harder to ignore that she’s not at all okay, and the unsettling realisation that her mental state is rapidly unravelling."
