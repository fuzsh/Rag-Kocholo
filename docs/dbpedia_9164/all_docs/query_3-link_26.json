        "text": "CHANNEL 4, the British television network, has won a reputation in the last several years for such features as ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ''Letter to Brezhnev.'' Today, Film Forum begins a weeklong series of seven movies that Channel 4 had a hand in producing and that have not been shown in theaters.\n\nSpecial attention is being called to ''Meantime,'' which was ''devised and directed'' by Mike Leigh, who has done comedies about working-class life in Britain for British television. ''Meantime,'' too, is billed as a comedy, but it is not particularly comical. Mr. Leigh is apparently of the school that equates dreariness with truth.\n\nHere he gives us a family living in a project in East London and existing on unemployment checks. The father and mother bicker interminably about anything and nothing. They are burdened with two sons - Colin, who is mentally retarded, and Mark, a neighborhood wise guy and general pain in the neck. Their relationship is perplexing without being particularly interesting.\n\nMr. Leigh's specialty is capturing the claustrophobia of life in a council flat. The most effective scene has Dad, Mom and Mark doing a kind of dance up and down their apartment's narrow hall as they wait for their turn in the bathroom. Considerable tension is gotten out of rides in the graffiti-adorned lift and brushes with black neighbors. The glimpses of the family's places of entertainment - the run-down pub with a pool table, the bingo parlor where mom's pens keep breaking down - are chilling. The lighting everywhere casts its own gloom.\n\nThe inmates are not as convincing as their prison. The parents are merely specimens of the demoralizing effects of life on the dole. The fuzzy relations between Mark and Colin (very well played, with locked-in force, by Tim Roth) finally fall victim to manipulation by the script. The ancillary characters include a skinhead pal of Colin's who should not be walking the streets unguarded, mom's middle-class sister, Barbara, who is stuck in a dull childless marriage that drives her first to Colin and then to drink, and a housing-project official of philosophic bent who ought to be funnier than he is.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
