        "text": "The journey depicted in this film begins with a drive at night, headlights glowing down a darkened road. When filmmaker Michael Workman’s father, Tim, suffers a stroke and shows signs of memory loss, Michael travels home to see him. In Meantime, their visit unfolds through a series of sensitive conversations and quiet observations. They sit together, sometimes in heavy silence, as they revisit and reckon with the past. Home movies punctuate these moments of connection and hurt, while the natural landscape around them—the hush of falling snow that blankets their initial reunion and the mountaintops that pierce the sky on the horizon—act as visual metaphors for words left unspoken. With remarkable restraint, Michael peels back the layers of his father’s lived experiences and stares down the space that lies between them.
