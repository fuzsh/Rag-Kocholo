Maybe $50 to get exalted with the netherwing tribe. You would still have to buy the colors (and then people could buy a WoW token to get the gold to buy all of them at once!). This would be great for casual players who aren’t able to grind netherwing rep due to time. Every WoW subscriber deserves the beautiful nether drakes! Please consider this. Don’t listen to the negativity from the hardcore players. This isn’t 2007 anymore, we need quality of life changes and optional micro transactions to TBC, otherwise very few people would play it. The boost and the token are a step in the right direction. Give everyone the ability to tame the twisting nether by flying through it on their cool nether drakes!\n\nNope. I’m all for boosts. Not everyone has the time (or desire) to do certain content. I see no issue with the option to purchase a way to skip it. It’s possible that they could delay the boost to about 6 months after many players have netherdrakes in order to balance it more.\n\nHey, maybe they could also offer a boost for full T5 gear and place you at the final boss of the whole expansion with 1hp remaining!\n\nThat way you could just pay money to complete the game instead of spending all your precious time.\n\nAnyone who doesn’t want the Netherwing boost is probably a broke deadbeat. Some of us actually have money and grinding repetitive daily quests is a waste of our time.\n\nBut what I would really want is the ULTRA Boost to get all attunements and pre-raid gear. Dungeons are easy and another pointless grind.\n\nIt’s all low-effort, passive aggressive micro-transaction trolling now. Not that I oppose these threads. I am loathe to see more MTX added to the Classic experience, personally. But every troll on these boards seems to think they’re uniquely clever with these threads.\n\n“Blizzard, can you please add the token so I can Warglaives”\n\n“Blizzard! Could we get a Cash Shop option to buy the 1850 rating for weapons.”\n\n“Blizz pls read; Netherwing Drakes in the cash shop!”\n\n“Blizz, sell 68 boost.”\n\nEtc etc. Just yawn"
