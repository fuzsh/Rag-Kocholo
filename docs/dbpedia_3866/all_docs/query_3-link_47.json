        "text": "Crystals can be a beautiful tool to support your overall wellbeing. We love incorporating crystals into our daily routine to promote a healthy mind, body and soul.\n\nFrom rose quartz to amethyst and citrine, there are a number of different crystals to explore - each containing their own unique properties and healing abilities. Not sure which crystals are right for you? Keep reading as we share 8 of our favourite crystals for health and wellbeing below.\n\nRose Quartz\n\nJust as the pale pink colour suggests, Rose quartz is best known as the “love stone”. This beautiful crystal is thought to attract love, raise self-esteem, and balance emotions. It’s also believed to help with healing a broken heart, providing comfort, and restoring trust and harmony in our relationships.\n\nAmethyst\n\nAmethyst is a grounding stone, thought to be a natural tranquilizer. This purple-hued crystal is believed to reduce stress, balance mood swings, and alleviate sadness, anxiety and grief. Amethyst is also thought to activate our spiritual awareness by opening our intuition.\n\nSelenite\n\nSelenite is one of the most powerful of all crystals, and is best known for clearing negative energy. Placing selenite towers around the home is thought to protect your environment from negative energy, while selenite wands can be used to cleanse your personal aura. Selenite can also be used to cleanse and recharge the other crystals in your kit.\n\nCitrine\n\nCitrine is known as the “success stone”, and is thought to help you manifest success in your everyday life. This popular stone is also believed to strengthen your self-esteem, promote a positive flow of energy, and even improve digestion and fatigue.\n\nClear Quartz\n\nClear Quartz is widely considered to be the “master healer” of crystals. This translucent stone is thought to energize and activate your chakras, increase spiritual wisdom, and aid with better concentration and memory.\n\nBlack Tourmaline\n\nBlack Tourmaline is a striking stone most commonly associated with protection, grounding, health, happiness and positivity. In fact, Black Tourmaline has a strong history of being used for protection by Shamans and ancient healers. This crystal is also thought to aid with compassion, tolerance and prosperity.\n\nGreen Onyx\n\nGreen Onyx is the stone of restfulness and purity. It’s best known for relieving stress, tension and fear, and encouraging a calmer emotional state. This soothing stone is also thought to assist with mental support and decision making.\n\nFluorite\n\nFluorite is a beautiful crystal for cleansing and stabilising your aura. It’s believed to absorb and neutralise any negative energy or stress. Fluorite is also thought to be an excellent learning aid, helping to boost focus, concentration and self-confidence.\n\nWhere to buy crystals online\n\nYou can shop our wide range of crystals online here at Inspire Me Naturally, including crystal cleansing kits for beginners."
