        "text": "Bitter melon may contain compounds that can help lower blood sugar. But if consumed in excess or with certain medications, it may have negative affects on your health.\n\nBitter melon (also known as Momordica charantia or bitter gourd) is a plant that gets its name from its taste. It becomes more and more bitter as it ripens.\n\nIt grows in a number of areas, including Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and East Africa. People have used bitter melon for a variety of medical conditions over time.\n\nBitter melon contains many nutrients that can be beneficial to your health. It’s linked to lowering blood sugar, which some studies suggest means it can aid in diabetes treatment.\n\nBitter melon is considered a complementary or alternative medicine. Therefore, the use of bitter melon isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetes or any other medical condition.\n\nBitter melon is linked to lowering the body’s blood sugar. This is because the bitter melon has properties that act like insulin, which helps bring glucose into the cells for energy.\n\nThe consumption of bitter melon can help your cells use glucose and move it to your liver, muscles, and fat. The melon may also be able to help your body retain nutrients by blocking their conversion to glucose that ends up in your blood stream.\n\nBitter melon isn’t an approved treatment or medication for prediabetes or diabetes despite the evidence that it can manage blood sugar.\n\nSeveral studies have examined bitter melon and diabetes. Most recommend conducting more research before using any form of the melon for diabetes management.\n\nHere are two studies that address bitter melon and diabetes:\n\nA report in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews concluded that more studies are needed to measure the effects of bitter melon on type 2 diabetes. It also cited the need for more research on how it can be used for nutrition therapy.\n\nA study in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology compared the effectiveness of bitter melon with a current diabetes drug. The study concluded that bitter melon did reduce fructosamine levels with type 2 diabetes participants. However, it did so less effectively than a lower dose of the already approved medication.\n\nThere’s no medically approved way to consume bitter melon as a treatment for diabetes at this time. Bitter melon may be eaten as part of a healthy and varied diet. Consuming bitter melon beyond your dinner plate may pose risks.\n\nAs a fruit that also has properties of a vegetable, bitter melon contains vitamins A and C as well as iron. It has been recognized by many cultures as having medicinal value.\n\nThere are no standard dosages for bitter melon as a medical treatment at this time.\n\nYou may find bitter melon in its natural vegetable form, as a supplement, and even as a tea. Keep in mind that supplements aren’t regulated by the FDA and don’t have to adhere to any stringent standards prior to being sold.\n\nYou shouldn’t use bitter melon as a supplement without consulting your doctor.\n\nUse bitter melon with caution beyond occasional use in your diet. Bitter melon can cause side effects and interfere with other medications.\n\nSome of the risks and complications of bitter melon include:\n\ndiarrhea, vomiting, and other intestinal issues\n\nvaginal bleeding, contractions, and abortion\n\ndangerous lowering of blood sugar if taken with insulin\n\nliver damage\n\nfavism (which can cause anemia) in those with G6PD deficiency\n\nproblems due to mixing with other drugs to alter effectiveness\n\nproblems in blood sugar control in those who have had recent surgery"
