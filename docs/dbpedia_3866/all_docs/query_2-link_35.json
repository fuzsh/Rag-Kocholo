        "text": "Had a great opportunity to chat to Bridget Masinga for SABC 3 Afternoon Express for Absa Group women focus in celebration of women ‚Äòs month..Here are 3 nuggets from my interview. üí•It is imperative that we recognize the persistent gaps and challenges that hinder true gender equality.From closing the gender pay gap to increasing women's representation in leadership positions. Be a multiplier- be so good at it that it becomes second nature. Where you sit at a table by yourself don‚Äôt bring one folding chair , bring 4.. üí•Empowering women with financial literacy isn‚Äôt just about numbers and spreadsheets; it‚Äôs about unlocking individual potential, building stronger communities, and shaping a brighter future. It equips women to navigate financial decisions confidently, secure their long-term well-being, and break free from economic vulnerabilities. As financial literacy ripples through families and communities, it fosters a more inclusive and equitable world where everyone has the tools to thrive. üí•Always remember that leadership starts from within‚Äîmaster your abilities, strengths and weaknesses. There are usually only a few things within your control and many others outside of it. To lead effectively and succeed, keep a firm grip on the things within your control; they will help you build the resilience needed to navigate leadership and the things outside of your control.\n\nHad the privilege to speak at Salesforce world tour essentials together with Ursula Fear Nobuhle Nkosi ,MBA Fiona Tabraham - Women in Tech Panel: Amplifying Every Voice ‚Äì Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Technology Workplaces. As individuals , We cannot pursue personal success while neglecting the advancement and well-being of our community... Our goals must be expansive enough to encompass the hopes and needs of others, for their benefit as well as our own. South Africa üáøüá¶ needs each one of us to pull together and bring forth solutions, particularly for our youth. This was also an opportunity to learn how to use AI in any industry, role, or workflow and how leading brands in South Africa and beyond are using the Einstein 1 Platform to build strong customer relationships and improve productivity. Absa Group was well represented by our CIO Lindelani Ramukumba who shared how Absa Group is Championing Innovation with Salesforce and attracting young talent.
