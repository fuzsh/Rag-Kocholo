Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Political 3D Map of Hwali).\n\nPolitical map\n\nPolitical map shows how people have divided up the world into countries and administrative regions such as states, counties, provinces, municipalities and postal zones. Different colors represent different countries and regions, whereas different shades of one color represent their internal divisions.\n\nThe choice of color is not related to the characteristics of Hwali, colors are assigned to countries and regions randomly. The capital is marked with a black star inside a white circle. Squares and circles of various size indicate other major cities.\n\nPlate Carree map projection\n\nA map projection is a way how to transform points on a Earth to points on a map. This 3D map uses Plate Carree projection, a simple variant of the equidistant cylindrical projection originated in the ancient times. The parallels and meridians are equally spaced, they together form equally sized squares over the entire world map.\n\nUsing simple grid, where each cell has the same size and shape, brings in significant benefits. For comparison, the detailed maps of Hwali use Mercator projection instead. The Mercator projection preserves the shapes and angles of small areas better, but on the other hand, it significantly distorts the size of areas.\n\nTechnology\n\nWe unlock the value hidden in the geographic data. Thanks to automating the complex process of turning data into map graphics, we are able to create maps in higher quality, faster and cheaper than was possible before.\n\nForever free\n\nWe created Maphill to make the web a more beautiful place.

Maps are assembled and kept in a high resolution vector format throughout the entire process of their creation.\n\nExperience of discovering\n\nMaphill maps will never be as detailed as Google maps or as precise as designed by professional cartographers. Our goal is different. We want to redefine the experience of discovering the world through the maps.\n\nFast anywhere\n\nMaps are served from a large number of servers spread all over the world.
