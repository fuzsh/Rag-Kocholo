        "text": "They belong to a bygone era, these private mansions or havelis of Old Delhi. Open inwards and closed from outside, with elaborate archways, latticework jharokhas and the quintessential chowk in the middle, the havelis of the walled city could be converted from a private residence of a typical North Indian joint family into an elaborate hosting ground for a baraat, practically overnight. Unending corridors, lotus shaped fountains, a square shaped layout for the rooms with raised parapets and a viewing gallery were their basic features, not to forget the ‘chhat’ or the terrace and the tehkhana to give respite from the summer heat. Take a sneak peak into the lives of the rich and affluential with Chunnamal’s haveli, Begum Samru’s or Zeenat Mahal. These will fill you with both nostalgia and wonder.\n\nPlaces to visit in Delhi are not only limited to temples, gardens and monuments as there are several old havelis and palaces that will impress any traveller.\n\n1\n\nJahaz Mahal\n\n​Built during the Lodi period, Jahaz Mahal literally means ‘ship palace—a reference to its location on the edge of the Hauz-i-Shamsi water tank in Mehrauli.

Soon after, i...more\n\n3\n\nZeenat Mahal\n\nLal Kuan, in the back lanes of Chandni Chowk left off Fatehpuri Masjid, lies a structure long forgotten. Its gates still towering over passers by who pay little heed to the history of this area. A part of the façade on t...more\n\n4\n\nKhazanchi Haveli\n\nThe Khazanchi haveli, like many others of Shahjahanabad, lies in ruins, its whitewashed archways covered with black dirt that routinely emanates from the small scale establishments in its vicinity. However, this takes aw...more\n\n5\n\nMirza Ghalib's Haveli\n\nSituated in Gali Qasim Jan in Baliimaran, Chandni Chowk, this spartan two storeyed structure housed one of India's most profound poets. Way back in the 19th century, the Mughal sultanate was on an irreversible decline an...more\n\n6\n\nChhunnamal ki Haveli\n\nThe exterior is covered in dust and soot from the relentless traffic that the arterial streets of Chandni Chowk are subjected to. The interiors, however, speak of a grandeur that is today, lost in time. Chunnamal Haveli,...more\n\n7\n\nHaksar Haveli\n\nHaksar Haveli, although a landmark and one of the major ones of Chandni Chowk owing to its historical significance, is barely recognisable since it has since then been parcelled off into a quasi-residential and a quasi-c...more\n\n8\n\nBegum Samru's Haveli\n\nStanding in front of the Bhagirath Palace, the erstwhile haveli of the lengendary Begum Samru, it is hard to imagine that this dilapidated structure covered with a mesh of wires on all sides was once a beautiful garden w...more\n\nDelhi Map\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n-->"
