Millie-Christine Twlna. The death ' of Millie, one of the famous Millie-Christine twins, at Wilmington, N.

Mll lie-ChrlBtlne were born in slavery times, the daughters of a colored woman and were aold for $40,000 for exhibition purp9aes. A few years later they were stolen from their owner and years afterwads were found In Europe.. They had the same body, with two heads and two sets of lower extremities. They were highly educated and could speak several languages. They could talk with each other^ or carry on two conversations slmultaneousl While one was asleep the other could be awake, but both usually slept at the same time. They attracted al most as* much attention as did the Siamese twins, who were men, and also died in North Carolina. The thought of the living twin linked to the body of the dead sLster, which ia'a part of herself, and facing cer tain death js horrible in the ex treme.? Ex. 6 . Butter For Sale.

Tito ( far mer can rely with wore certainty on eowpcas, sorghum and peas, and out and veteh, W till these crop? ho can secure hotter results, and with lest* coat. For those Who arc cont?mplat lug tbu growing ot aJfaifa, ono of the In-Ht ways of gutting results Is to start preparing tin* land at ie(ist one year prevlou* to the time of sowing . ( (i i n le: ib tin- la ml Ih rich, woll drained, free from wood and gruss seed, it will not bo profitable tO <>w alfalfa. In the fall, break t ho land deep, and apply a ton of lime per aero, harrowing thlB in well. Ill about ono week apply sta ble manure at the rato of from five; to- ten tons per acre, and harrow thl In. Then, during some moist period |ln September or October, the ear lier the better, now bur clover, crim son clover or vetch, inoculating the .sped when sown or use sol! from the field where the crop ban been grown successfully. Use a liberal amount of complete fertilizer at this time. In tho spring as soon aH the crop 1b taken from the land, plow It deep and thoroughly again, and apply 1000 pounds of lime. Sow cowpoas broadcast, and give a liberal appli cation of a compelte fertilizer. I>o not apply stable manure at this time, as it will serve to spread weed and grass seed. Tho stand of peas should be thick In order that the weeds and grass will not get start ed. In tho fall cut the peas for hay and plow the land shallow, or It it is a light sandy loam, discing la all that is necessary. Apply lime again at the rate of 1000 pounds per- acre, and harrow it in. Alfalfa should not be sown on a loose and dry seed bed. Sow the seed during some moist period between the last of September and the middle of October, at the rate of 25 lbs. per acre broadcast, and harrow' them In lightly. Inoculating will be neces Bary and cafi be done either by In oculating the Beed with Farmogerm before sowing, or by applying two hundred pounds of soil from an old alfalfa field broadcast per acre. Farmogerm will give good results if used properly. Use as fertilizer at the time of planting about 200 lbs. of complete fertilizer, harrowing it in with the seed. If one wishes to plant alfalfa with out going to the trouble of starting one year early and getting the land in good condition, we would suggest that land which has been in cow peas, or some clean cultivated crop, be used. Br<*ak the land deep and thoroughly, and apply lime at the rate of 200 lbs. or more per acre. Do not apply any stable manure un less it is thoroughly decomposed and free from weed and grass seed. Otherwise the sowing of the seed should be done in the fall, the same as in the above described method. In the spring if weed and grass get started in the field, it should be mowed as often as nceessary in or der that they do not get ahead of the alfalfa. Under no circumstances should weeds and grass be allowed to mature seed in the field. Where there are no weeds and grass to give trouble-, cuttings should bo m&de as often as the plants are in full bloom or little before.

It is with sadness that we think of the death of Mr. R. K. West whom we had known from child hood, He always had a kind word and a pleasant smile for all with whom he came in contact, and one whom we never heard speak evil of^anyone. He was a kind husband and a kind father. When quite a youth he united himself, with the Pine Tree Presby terian church, and In late years became one of the officers in the church. He took great Interest in the welfare of the county and state affairs. Mr. West was a son of James Frank West who died about 1854 and his mother was Nancy Cameron West of Scottish descent, whose family came here in the early eigh teenth century. It is hard to part with one we loved so well. We are unable tc understand these things but charge it to an all-wise Providence who doeth' all things well. A Friend.
