[0.— 7181.] Price 2s. 7d. PREFACE. Some portions of the materials for this work were so late in their arrival that advantage was taken of the delay to compress as far as possible the reyiew of the rest to within moderate dimensions, I have thus deprived myself of the opportunity, of which my predecessor, Sir William Plowden, so freely and gracefully availed himself, of showing my appreciation of the work of my colleagues, the Superin- tendents of the provincial census, by incorporating in my own review copious extracts from theirs. I am none the less under obligations to them for the help they have given me throughout the operations, and for which I now tender my best thanks. Bather than draw comparisons here, I prefer to leave their work to be judged by those who are in a position to view it from a standpoint less partial than that of one who has had so strong and intimate an interest in it and its authors as 1 have had during the last two years. I may nevertheless be allowed the personal gratification of summarising, in a few instances, what will be found expressed in a more diffuse form in the review to which these lines are a prelude. Mr. O'Donnell's work stands by itself, as in no other case has so large a population been enumerated in such detail on the responsibility of a single and practically unaided Superintendent. That his administration was statistically and financially successful is greatly due to the unsparing personal supervision he exercised on the operations from first to last. His analysis of the movement of the population, district by district, is very valuable, and his interesting iconoclastic excursions into the domain of ethnology are by no means without justification in the information he collected. Mr. Stuart was equally successful in his handling of the Madras census, and his review of the results shows a specially keen statistical scent, if the expression be allowed, in following certain paths where one has to walk circumspectly amongst dangerously fragile premises. Messrs. Gait and Maclagan have shown throughout their work the best characteristics of that most valuable speciality of India, the district officer, namely, tact, energy and knowledge of the people. Their returns were the first to be completed, and their review, especially where they respectively tread on fresh grouQd. which both had good opportunities of doing, are full of remarks worth reading. Mr. Bales, too, has written a very valuable account of the census of one of the most interesting portions of the Empire, the two divisions of Burma. Mr. Drew shares with Messrs. Gait and Maclagan the honours of punctuality, and his work on Bombay was the first to reach me in its completed form. As 1 superintended the Bombay census of 1881, I naturally feel more than ordinary interest in this part of the operations, and must frankly acknowledge that, in my opinion, Mr. Drew managed his tabulation better than I did, though in the matter of the review, I confess a preference for my own bantling. The Central Provinces were enumerated by a Superintendent who, before he went to take up the census work, had never set foot in the Province in his life. The great reduction in the cost, and the amount of information collected in the review, speak for themselves in Mr. Robertson's favour, both as administrator and reporter. Messrs. Egerton and Hastings, too, worked well in Aim^r and Berar. Among the pleasant recollections of the census, is the cordial co-operation of the officials of some of the native States, and I must specially mention the names of Mr. V. Narsinghayangar, the Superintendent of the Mysore census, whose work was one of the first to be received by me in the Simla office, and the late Mr. Bhatwadekar, and his successor, Mr. Mulshankar, in Baroda. I have also to thank, for their interest in getting the preliminary arrangements set in proper train, Mr. Tucker, / 78388. A 2 of the Central India Agency, and Mr. Erskine, in Rajpntana, as well as Mr. Grunion. in the former, and Colonel Abbot in the latter, for their work in connection with the operations subsequent to the enumeration. On the other side of the account, T must express my regret at the absence of any review of the operations and results in the second province ini the country lyin papulation. Whether the omission is due to Mr. Baillie or >hia printer I .am uiiable to say, as I have failed in extracting any explanation of, this abnormal procrastination. The reports on the census of Central India, Baroda, and Haidrabad have not been received, but the delay lias in each case been explained. •;; I do not like to conclude this long list of those directly concerned in the operations, without mentioning the. aid in connection with -the arrangement and printing of forms and tables which I received from Mr. WooUam, in Simla, and Mr. Lewis in the Bengal office, at Calcutta ; and also that given me personally by Mr. E. F. Augustin, whose services were lent me by the Military Department of the Govern- ment of India, and who, as head of my establishment, acquitted himself so efficiently that I felt entitled to specially refer to his services when replacing them at the disposal of the above Department. I must acknowledge my obligations, again, to many others, not in any way con- nected with the operations, of whose studies and experience I have taken advantage. The census deals with so many subjects, each of which, in the present day, falls within the province of a specialist, that no single individual can safely trust to his own unaided capacity in reviewing them, but is forced, like Moli^re, a prendre son bien ou il le trouve, and I have done my best to acknowledge such depredations at the time I have found it convenient to make them. The field covered, however, is so wide, that, in order to bring out the review before the information on which it is based is out of date, a mode of treatment in some degree superficial^ cannot be avoided. Oh this occasion, moreover, my time has been specially absorbed by work connected with the reprint of some of the tables, aind with the caste returns, which could not, , be completed till data had been incorporated which only reached ine in -the middle of May. It was only for four or five months, accordingly,- that I was able to. concentrate my attention on the statistics, and the amount of ground to be traversed is so vast, that I was too often reminded of the question asked of 'a late Laureate by his Quaker* friend: — \"Prythee, friend Southey, with all this writing, when do'st thou find time to think?\" For such views as I have been able to express, I am alone responsible. The work is, it is true, the review of a State operation, by a State official, but it is written at a distance from India, beyond reach of consultation with other ibranohes of the administration. A good deal has been added, too, in explanation of the statistics, that would have been deemed unnecessary had the work been written for official readers only, but which becomes advisable as soon as a public is approached that has no experience of what is to us in India a matter of everyday ' (observation. Whether these explanations fulfil their object, and how far we of the Census have succeeded in adequately dealing with the many important and interesting subjects thus placed within our reach, are questions that we now submit tc our readers : — Nam coenas fercula nosti'ee Malim convivis quam placuisse coquis.

Magna modis multis miranda videtur Gentibus humanis regio, visenda que fertur, Rebus opima bonis, niult& munita Tirum vi. — Lucretius, The second general census of India was taken on the night of the 26th of February Selection of 1891, as nearly as possible 10 years after the first, which took place on the 17th of \"late. February 1881. Closer correspondence in date between the two could not be obtained, by reason of the diflference in the date of the full maouj which is a factor of consider- able importance in connection with an Indian census. It is essential, in the first p]ac6> that the enumerator should have moonlight to guide him round his beat, which includes, in the rural tracts, a comparatively large area ; for his duties are not confined to the mere collection by day of a schedule which has been prepared for him by the house- holder, as in a European country. In India, the population to be enumerated contains no more than about 6 in the 100 who can read and write, so that the whole of the census record has to be prepared by special agency. As it is impossible to provide enough people of the necessary qualifications to do this in the course of a single night, the census is divided into two sections. First, the enumerator fills up the schedules of his beat with the required information for all the habitual residents therein, before the census. Then, on the appointed night, he brings this up to date by a second round, during which he strikes out all who have died or are found absent, and enters aU found on the premises who were not there when the preliminary visit was paid, such as travellers, guests, and the newly born. As he is bound to visit all the outlying parts of his beat, wherever casual sojourners are likely to be found, efficient inspection is ensured and the cost of lighting saved, by the selection of a moonlight night for the operation. But, unfortunately, the night of full moon itself cannot be fixed for the census, as it is the occasion when all the principal religious gatherings of India at shrines, temples, and bathing places are held, so that a very considerable portion of the population is absent on that night from its native place. It is a matter of uncertainty how long beforehand it is the custom to start on such excursions, which constitute one of the chief pleasures, as well as the main ceremonial observance, in the life of the masses, but, as a rule, there is a tendency to return home with greater expedition than marks the journey out. It is found, accordingly, that what with the number of festivals that are purely local in their attractions, and the facilities now available for visiting the places of wider renown by rail, the third day after the auspicious occurrence will generally find the bulk of the pilgrims back in their villages, and it was on this consideration that the census night was fixed, both in 1881 and on the last occasion. A suggestion was made, again, that the census of India should be taken synchronously with that of the United Kingdom, in order to emphasize the imperial character of the operations. The conditions of India , however, rendered it impossible to fall in with this proposal. By the beginning of April, when it was understood that ^the census would be taken in the mother country, the hot season has set in in India, ^nd the inspection of what has been above called the preliminary record, and also of the more general preparations for the census, could not be conducted, compatibly with other work, so efficiently as during the season when the supervising officials of the tract in question are on tour in the ordinary course of their duties, and it is to this inspection that the accuracy of the enumeration is mainly due. The results, showing a total of about 287,000,000 persons, were compiled Populatiop at various offices in the different Provinces and States with such expedition and enumerated, accuracy that they were published within five weeks from the census, with a difference of only five persons in every 1,000, or ^ per cent., from the finally corrected returus. The figure quoted above bears a ratio to the population of the world, as at Diversity ot present computed, of about one-fifth, and is the largest appertaining to any single circum- country with the exception of China. On the other hand, a map of the world on a ^^^^^^^ ^° A 4 Uniformity ill religion- iuid occupa- tion. Importance and variety of physical conditions. plane proiection shows that of ttie great promontories that taper from the north down into the southern seas, India is by far the smallest. It contains, in fact, but 3 per cent, of the estimated land-surface of the globe. But in spite of its political unity and comparatively small area, India, with all the diversity of its conditions, has a good claim to be considered less as a feoukliry lihan as a collection of countries, or a continent. In connection with an operation like the census, this will undoubtedly be conceded. In discussing the statistics of Europe, we distinguish, as a matter of course, those of Grreece from those of Holland, and Spain from Grermany. Even in the case of a single empire like Eussia, the circumstances of Ifkutsk are not confounded with those of Kiew or Warsaw. It is equally rational, then, to discriminate between Assam and Sindh, Madras and the Panjab, to say nothing of Burma, which has so few points of contact with the rest of this great dependency. In reviewing the results of the census, therefore, it may appear tl^t comparatively little is said of India, as a whole, for the reasons just presented, but in all cases the remarkably large numbers involved are of pre-eminent use as a centre line, from which to measure .the variations of the different component parts. But two of the facts that appear prominently in ' the returns indicate, on the surface, a significant degree of unifprmity throughout the country, so it is best to bring these to notice at once. The first, then, is that neariy three-fourths of the population is returned under one religious denomination. This matter will have to be discussed in detail in its proper sequence, but, in the meanwhile, it should be understood that the apparent uniformity is little more than a concession to conven- tional nomenclature, and the title covers creeds as well as races as fundamentally differing from each other as any in Europe. The second point to be noticed here, is the very high proportion in all parts of the country of the population living, by agri- culture. Taking it as a whole, about two-thirds, and indirectly perhaps nearly three-fourths, of the community are wholly or partially dedicated to Mother Earth, and in this case the uniformity is real, not mei-ely nominal. But it is also one which serves to throw into greater prominence the extraordinary diversity of the physical conditions under which the cultivation of the soil has to be conducted in India. We have thus to look upon the great geographic and climatic features of the country in their direct and intimate connection with the predominating means of sub- sistence, and therefore with the distribution and circumstances of the population now existing. They have to be considered, again, historically, in their capacity of determining factors in the ethnology of that population, helping to explain the variety and fusion of the elements of which it is probably composed. Some descrip- tion of the principal physical divisions of the country is accordingly necessary as a preface to the discussion of the results of their influence on its ethnology, and also on the more general subject that precedes it, namely, the ratio between population and area. The Ocean, and the Himalaya. Geographical Divisions. our- Oonsidering for the present India proper, excluding, that is, Burma, we find selves face to face with two main geographical facts, the ocean to the south, and\"^e great mountain barrier to the norijh. Of the former it is enough to say that until the arrival of the European adventurers of the 16th century, it plays little part 'in the history of the population, and the settlers who came by sea are scattered and insi^ni ficant. Whether it always ebbed and flowed in its present bed, or whether India is but the remnant of the submerged continent of Leinuria, it is not necessai-v f the present purpose to determine. The question is of great ethnological momenT especially m connection with the population of the peninsular tracts of India but th evidence is of a sort that must be left to. be sifted by specialists like Messrs 'Wall o and Peschl. As regards the great mountain system of the north there ie no s '^^>h difficulty. As far back as there is occasion to look, they have stood between InT and its neighbours, more or less of a barrier to free intercourse and colonisatin^^ Planked by ranges of less height, indeed, but still difficult to traverse and backed b id and inhospitable desert, the Himalaya and it's sister systems only with great toil and hardship.to comparatively small bodies miles of bleak table-land and afford means of access '9' of men at a time. In the- extreme- north-west the way is less arduous, and has been used by all the invaders of India who were able, like Alexander and his 40,000 meni to establish, as a preliminary step, their footing in the country to the west of the ranges flanking the Indus. Through these last the passes are few and narrow, so much so, that it is said that even in the present day, a body of 100,000 men moving on India from Jelalabad, through the Khaibar Pass, would find its vanguard on the Plain of Peshawar before the rear had left the starting point. Yet it is by this route and its neighbours to the north that Iran and Turan have entered India from time imme- morial, except in the few instances when the mountain range was turned altogether, and an advance in force made up or across the Indus. At the extreme east the mean elevation is less, but on passing the range, the alternative is presented, of a com- paratively easier progress down the valleys of the main rivers of the Burma and Siam peninsula, so that much of the immigration from the north-east has probably been deflected from India to the Golden Chersonese, by the Irrawadi and Mekong. Throughout the central Himalayan system the passes are few and of great height, and it is probable that they were not attempted until after the occupation of the Gangetic basin in force by those who had found their way thither by easier routes. So far as the census is concerned, the Himalaya and its neighbours are of little importance, since, with the exception of the Kashmer State and the southern slopes, little of- the mountain tract was brought under the operations. The direct connection of the system with the present subject lies in its influence on the climatic and agricultural circumstances of the country immediately at its base, and historically, again, in its capacity of impediment to the free overflow of population from the tracts lying beyond it in the north. The former point will be noticed shortly in the course of this introduction. Eegarding the latter, all that need be said is, that though the colonisation of Upper India from abroad may have been started by bodies of immi- grants reaching the plains through the mountains of the Himalaya and Hindu Kush, the subsequent recruitment from that direction has been, so to speak, insignificant, and the expansion of the foreign communities thus settled in India has been due to causes arising within the country itself. The second of the main geographical divisions of India is the great river system, The great which covers the whole of the northern portion of the continent. The chief arteries \"^^'s- are the Indus and the Ganges, with their tributaries, and the lower course of the stream we know as the Brahmaputra. The last is not, however, to be compared in importance, in connection with the present subject, to the two others, firstly, because of the competition of the great rivers of the Indo-Chinese peninsula, of which mention has already been made, and, again, because the upper portion of its south Himalayan course lies in a coniparatively narrow valley, cut off\" from the rest of the country by an intervening range of considerable elevation and width. In fact, in common parlance amongst the residents of this tract, India is held to be a foreign country. As soon as the Brahmaputra emerges from its valley it becomes almost inextricably mixed up with the Ganges, forming one vast network of deltaic outlets. In Upper India the case is very different. Here the streams, which would naturally direct the course of the immigrants through the mountains, debouch at once into open country, affording the means of uninterrupted progress either south-east or south-west, for the watershed between the Panjab and the Gangetic system, once the Himalaya is left behind, is of insignificant height. The submontane tracts of the Panjab, with their continuation down the rich alluvial plain of the Jamna and Ganges, present the obvious outlet of a community disposed to agriculture, whilst the vast grazing grounds of the Indus valley are equally attractive to those of pastoral proclivities. Geographically, this belt of level country stretches all across India at its greatest breadth from west to east. Climatically, and from an ethnological point of view, it IS by no means uniform, though for perhaps two-thirds of its extent the differences are in degree only, not in kind. The third division is hardly as well defined as those already described. It The Central consists of what may be called the Second line of defence of peninsular India, that is, '\"^'^S^s. the belt of table-land and hilly country that separates the Gangetic basin from the Deccan, or great plateau of the south. Its western limits are the Aravalli hills and the rainless portion of the Indus valley. On the north it rises more or less gradually from the Ganges. It is buttressed on the south by the Vindhya and Satpura hills, below Which to the south, agaiii, lies the tiongue of 'flat' country separating it from I 78388. ;3 10 The central plain and Deccan table-land. The eastern peninsular coast. the Deccan. The whole of the eastern portion is a series of broken hills from the Delta and the Orissa coastline to the central plain. Strictly speaking, the western portion, or the Central India plateau, should be distinguished from the eastern, which comprises the Chiitia-Ndgptir and Central Province hill tracts, at the Kaimlir range, but the line of separation i3 narrow and indistinct. One of the most important features of this division is its ethnological relation to the Ganges valley, on the one hand, and the plains of the south on the other, for it undoubtedly served to keep the stream of expansion of the north-western colonies within the valley, and direct it to the south-eastwards, instead of allowing its direct extension into the peninsula. So long as the fat plains along the river were available, there was no inducement to leave them in order to tempt the hardships and dangers of a trespass across the dividing ranges, so these last were left to the wild tribes, descendants of those which had been forced, off the plains by the advance of the foreigner, and here they are to be found in the present day. From the central plain, which comprises the valleys of the Narmada and Tapti, with '-what is known as the Chattisgarh tract, rises the Deccan. This title is correctly restricted to the plateau rising more or leas abruptly from the Tdpti Valley, on the north-west; from the western coast and from the southern plains, whilst it slopes upwards much more gradually from the eastern coast. The boundaries on both east and west used to be called the Grhats, or steps, but this term is now confined by geographers to the chain on the west, because the for- mation to the east consists of groups of hills more or less isolated from each other, though sufficiently in line to demarcate the table-land from the plains below and along the coast : they cannot, therefore, be called a continuous range. There is thus a very gradual transition from the conditions of the latter tract to those of the uplands, a fact in strong contradistinction to the remarkable influence exercised by the western range on the climate and rain-distribution on each side of it. There remain fo be described the strips of country along the coast, east and west. These vary in character very considerably. On the east, the upper portion is more or less an offshoot of the Ganges delta, but as the strip widens out from about the mouths of the Godavari, the country acquires a special character of its own, both climatic and ethnic. The name Carnatic formerly given to it, apparently by the early European settlers, is a misnomer, not recognised in philology or by the people. The derivation of the term has been often discussed, and, may, perhaps, be found in two words, received through the Telugu, meaning \" black \" and \" country,\" or tract, a title very likely to be given by the denizens of the light soil of the eastern peninsula when introduced to the rich dark soil so characteristic of the western table-land. In the present day, the name is only given to a small strip along the western coast, and is scarcely recognised, even there, by the people, but owes its currency chiefly to official convention. The western The western coast-line is, as before mentioned, of a very different character from coasr. ^^Q gg^g^_ -pov the greater portion of its length it consists of a narrow strip of level land immediately by the shore, rising by broken ranges to the foot of the Ghdts. At the extreme south it may be taken to include the ranges of higher hills broken off at the Palghat, from the main line which supports the table-land. Towards the north, the strip widens out and becomes a tract resembling in general features the central plains, gradually giving way to the conditions peculiar to the lower Indus valley. The central part of this coast-line is almost devoid of the long-shore strip and the hills rise from the sea with but little intervening level ground, and that of comparatively low agricultural quality. The existing administrative division of Burma into Upper and Lower serves well enough for the present introduction. If the whole of the hilly country to the north had been included in the census operations, it would have been advisable to demarcate the province more minutely, and to distinguish the circumstances of the settled portions of the country, in the plains and valleys, from the hill tracts, which differ from the rest in both climate and population. Summary of The following table summarises the distribution of area and population which has geographical been attempted above, and as the administrative boundaries recognised in the census Burma. 11 I returns coincide \"fairly well witli tte geographical, tlie results are generally speaking accurate. • DIVISION.

Southern, or peninsular India, returns 24f and 29, and the intervening belt, 20^ and 13|-. The rest, 11 per cent, of the area and 2f of the population, is found in Burma. Before entering further into the details of the distribution thus given, some Meteoro- description has to be added of their climatic conditions, for without these the logical geographical outlines serve to denote facts mainly historical in their interest, such as variety, the probable direction of colonising streams, and the demarcating lines of the ethnic divisions, which have to be discussed later. But on the climatic conditions, taken along with the general character of the tract, depends the ratio subsisting in the present day between the land and its population, since, as originally stated, the bulk of the latter lives by the cultivation of the former. The meteorology of India has occupied the attention of eminent specialists for a considerable number of years, and of late the area of observation has been widely extended by the establishment of new stations under efficient inspection, with an increase in the scope of record. There are six series of data available in connection with the present purpose, but most of them, for a period that is sufficient to afford trustworthy standards, are based on the obser- vations of only a few of the principal meteorological stations. We can make use, for instanbe, of the record of annual rainfall, of which the data are full, whilst setting aside those of the number of rainy days, the relative humidity and aqueous vapour- tension, which are available for the' principal stations diily. But as regards tem- perature, the returns alone, without the supplement of the figures of, say, the mean B 2 12 General character of the rainfall. Distribution pf the rain- fall, seasonal and geographic. Winter and spring rain. Summer rain or S.W. mon- soon. monthly range, are of little value in connection with, the subject in hand. In the course of time means will be found, no doubt, to elaborate something of the nature of a \" figure of merit,\" meteorologically speaking, for all the most typical centres of observation in India, in which attempt every one of the above data will be given its proportional weight, but in the meanwhile the annual rainfall will suffice for the general indications which are alone relevant to the question with which this chapter is concerned. With respect to this rainfall, it must first be understood that though the mean for India of 42 inches, or thereabouts, is more or less what is to be expected in the tropics, the variations in its local distribution are so great that they are said by good authorities to be unparallelled in any Other part of the known world, -not excepting the British Islands, which boast a high rank in this respect. There is found, for example, a fall of less than five inches in the central portion of the Indus plain, and one of over 600 on a buttress of the KhAsi hills, in Assam. In the peninsula, too, along the west coast, as much as 200 inches falls 40 miles from the sea, whilst at a distance of, say, 80 miles there is only a precarious sprinkling of 20. In connection with this variability there are two points that may be noted here. First, that the rainfall is subject to much variation periodically, as well as locally; and' that from year to year the range of variation is in inverse ratio to the average -amount, that is to say, the uncertainty, so to speak, is greater as the rainfall is less. Where an inch or two makes little or no difference to the agricultural outlook of the year, the chances of a normal fall are greatest, but in the tracts wheire the said amount bears a far higher proportion to the annual total, it is most likely to be in excess or defect. The second point is that, according to the observations hitherto worked up, the same feature in the rainfall does not extend over more than two-thirds of the area under record, so that, as a rule, a deficiency in one-third of India is likely to be accompanied by a fall above the average in the rest 6f the country. It is not to be understood that failure of the rain to the extent of causing a famine is here meant, but merely the tendency, in one or other direction, of a variation from the annual mean fall. These are both important features in regard to the numerical development of the population, a subject which occupies a later chapter. But for the moment, it has to be shown how far the general distribution of the rainfall corresponds to the geographical or orographic conformation of the country. This correspondence will be found to be, in the main, very close. The rainfall in India is, it need hardly be said, periodic, throughout the country, and not liable to l)e irregularly distributed over the year. Some tracts enjoy the advantage of two seasons of rain, but for the most part the fall for the year is concentrated into one. In north-western India the season begins with the winter rains, which pass along the base of the Himdlaya from west to east, getting lighter as they advance, till they cease on the confines of Bengal. Their extension southwards, too, is confined to tlie submontane region, and, on the whole, the advantage from them is reaped in a com- paratively small tract. Megasthenes, however, judging of India from the portion of it which came most under his observation, extends the operation of this season to the whole continent as then known. It is interesting, we may remark cursorily, to find that in his time, as at present, wheat was the crop sown at this season. Before the winter rains have ceased in the north, the spring storms have gathered in the Bay of Bengal, so that the Delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra has the benefit of them. Their influence extends, too, though lightly, down the coast, as far as the southernmost point of India, but they do not reach the western portion of the pen,insula. In their turn, they give way to the cyclonic storms so well known in the Bay of Bengal, which precede the great event of the meteorological year, the south-western rain. This sets in about the end of May or beginning of June, in two main branches. The more important sweeps up the western coast tiU it fades away towards the upper portion of the north-western plain. In its course it encounters the obstacle of the Ghat line, which impedes its progress over the Deccan, whilst in the north, the hot and dry tracts of the lower Indus induce a current from the west, which is stronff enough to overpower a weak one from the coast, and deflect it eastwards, thus depriving the upper Indus of its due rain. Moreover, it is almost certain that the 1ft coast current is aflFeoted unfavourably by a heavy snowfall during the winter, on the nucleus of the mountains we know as the Himalaya and Hindu Kush, so that political troubles are not the only ones in India that have their origin in the north-west. The second branch of the south-west current sets up the Bay of Bengal, and after irrigating Burma and the Gangetic Delta is deflected westward by the Himalayas. About the centre of the great valley it meets the other current from the west, so that when both are strong the fall is abundant, but if either, especially that from the west, is at all weak, it is only the south of the valley and the central belt, hills and plains, that receive their average amount of rain. Scarcely has the south-west current ceased in the eastern portion of India, than the Autumn rain-bearing current from the north-east sets in, across the Delta and the east coast, rain or N.E. Through this the southern plain, which receives but little rain from the south-west, \"Monsoon. and that precariously, expects its main supply for the year, but the current is by no means as strong as that from the Indian Ocean, and as the latter ceases in southern India some time before the commencement of the other rain, the earth has begun to get heated again, so the extremity of the current is weakened and the fall rendered uncertain in amount. Setting aside the extreme west of India, which lies within the influence of the dry Zones of winds of the desert beyond the frontier, the minimum fall is found in the zone immediately uncertain adjacent to that region, known as the Indian Desert. But the zones of uncertainty f**!'- are to be looked for round the meeting points of the main currents, at the extremities of their respective courses. The most extensive of these lies in the centre and south of the peninsula. Here the south-western, current is stopped, as has been already pointed out, by the line of Ghats, so that comparatively little rain-bearing vapour escapes across the Deccan plateau. Again, though the current from the opposite quarter meets with scarcely any opposition of this sort, its direction lies more in line with the coast, so that only its skirts reach the high-lying land in the interior, Further south, again, this current has spent its force before it reaches the plain, and has but a small area of sea from which to replenish its moisture-bearing vapour. The fall is plentiful enough, when it comes, but it is wont to fail to a far greater extent than in most parts of India. The second of these unfortunate zones lies within the Gangetic valley, of which it includes the portion, roughly speaking, between the Indian Desert on the west and the Gandak on the east, situated mostly to the north of the main stream. In the tract under the influence of the same currents, but a little further south, the precipitation of rain, though not heavy, is remarkably regular. This is due, possibly, to the dampness of the land to the east, and to the shortness of the distance to the ocean on the west, at the point where the current catches the hills of the central belt. In connection with the relative uncertainty of the rainfall, it has been estimated from Limit of the available observations that the tracts receiving a fall averaging less than 50 inches, security of and with a mean deviation of about 12 per cent, above or below that average, all lie ^*>^^°^- ■vyithin the danger of famine. In the southern plain and the portion of the Gangetic valley that has just been described, the falls varies between 30 and 40 inches, whilst the mean range of the annual fluctuations is from 15 to 23 per cent, either above or below, or, from 30 to 46 per cent., taking both chances together. Combining the two features, geographical and hydrographic, the variety of con- Summary of ditions under which the Indian agriculturist has to labour can be appreciated. In the agrioulturnl first place, we find in the lower course of the Ganges and Brahmaputra an alluvial <'*'\"<^i*i°\"''- plain, abundantly watered by the fall of two rainy seasons. Higher up the valley of the former the soil is still of the same description and the country equally open and level, but the rainfall is uncertain. Keeping on towards the north-west, we enter a sub- montane plain, open and fertile, with the chance of two falls of rain in the twelvemonth, .one of which is fairly certain. Here we meet the Indus valley, and the circumstances are greatly changed. The country is still for the most part level, but the rainfall rapidly diminishes as the west is approached, so that the cultivation has to be to a great extent independent of it. The substitute in this case, as in that of Egypt, is the rise of a mighty river, which annually inundates the country for miles on each side. Beyond that range, again, and here the advantage is on the side of India, the five great tributaries of the Indus, supply the necessary irrigation wherever the level admits of^ canals. Further to the south-west, throughout the lower course of the B 3 u Indus, the rainfall is insignificant, but -wterever water can be conducted, cultivation is possible, as the soil is naturally deep and fertile. To tlie south of the desert lies the tract above called the Western Literal. The upper portion partakes of the character of the Tapti basin, in the central plain, except where it rises amongst low hills and broken ground to the central belt. But going south again, the level ground is found to be confined to the immediate coast, and inland, the country consists of series of hills trending dowawards from the Grhats. The arable land, therefore, is either on the slopes of these hills, or in the depressions between them. In the former case it is shallow in soil, in the latter, small in extent. The rainfall, however, is plentiful, though confined to a single season. In the extreme south of this strip, the arable area expands, and the rain is distributed over two seasons, so that its agricultural advantages are far greater. In the southern plain there is abundance of arable land, and the soil is, on the whole, good, though it varies much from tract to tract. But the rainfall, as has been already observed, is very uncertain. In some measure, too, the Deccan plateau resembles its neighbour. It contains a large area of light, shallow soil in the east, where the season is proverbially fickle, since this tract lies on the border-line of the two main currents affecting the peninsula. On the other hand, the Deccan has in its west and central portions considerable tracts of the disintegrated basalt now called the \" black cotton soil,\" of great depth and fertility, with a remarkable power of retaining moisture, said to be due to the amount of alumina amongst its component elements, without which it is probable that much of the land would not be cultivable at all. Adjacent to the Deccan on the north, lies the central plain, of great fertility, but liable in its western portion to the same uncertainty of rainfall, though in far less degree, as the north-western Deccan. The hills by which it is bounded on the other sides receive, in like manner, a plentiful rain supply from both branches of the south-west current. They contain, however, but a scanty area of level ground, so that agriculture has to be carried on in more or less of a primitive scale at present, and the collection of forest produce competes with it in favour as a means of subsistence amongst the wild tribes that form the bulk of the population of this tract. The western portion of the central hill-country forms a plateau sloping in most of its extent so gradually towards the north-east that it is almost impossible to draw the ' line between it and the Grangetic basin. The strip of coast land connecting the Gangetic delta with the southern plain contains a fair extent of flat country, and as it shares with its northern neighbour the benefits of both the spring and autumn rain, in fertility it is little behind that favoured tract. The greater portion of the Himalayan tracts that come within the scope of the census operations lie beyond the region of periodic rains. The southern slopes and subsidiary ranges, receive, as rule, a -good fall, though in the north-western direction they are liable to the same weakness in the Slimmer current as the region immediately below them, in the Indus valley. Further north, the Vale of Kashmer, ^vhich is the only extensive tract of arable ground in that State, has the reputation of good and certain rain, though it is not without its experience of famine within the present generation. The country surrounding it on the west and north consists of ranges of hills and mountains, where cultivation is restricted to the valleys or the portions of the lower slopes that can be terraced for irrigation. The high plateau on the east resembles its neighbour Thibet in sterility and the absence of rain. In estimating the average fall on the Himalayan tract, the whole of this portion, Kashmer, Gilgit, and Ladakh, has been omitted, as' the observations have not been carried on long enough as yet to afi'ord trustworthy returns on which to work. Such are the circumstances of India proper, and Burma alone now remains to be described. It has been already stated that, for general purposes, the political dis- tinction of Upper and Lower will suffice, but it may as well be mentioned here that\" so far as the rainfall is concerned, there is a further and a most important distinction to be drawn between the literal and the inland tracts of the lower division of the province. The hill-ranges along the coast exercise a remarkable influence in the distribution of the rain, and the fall, which varies from 170 to about 230 inches at the stations where the register is kept, diminishes to from 60 to 80 a few miles inland where our record is as yet incomplete. Again, in Upper Burma, where the fall is com- paratively light, there is a submontane and hilly tract to the north which attracts undoubtedly, a far heavier fall than the open country that forms the bulk of this part 16 of the province. Thus,' whilst the whole of Lower and the north of Upper Burma fall within the region of certain seasons, there is a considerable space in the centre which must be held to be outside the limit of immunity from scarcity of rain. Owing to the curious localisation of the rainfall in the literal tracts of Lower Burma, and to the want of accurate measurement of the areas of the subdivisions of Kashmer and Central India, these portions of India have not been included in the returns of rainfall which are discussed in connection with the distribution of the population in the next chapter. Omission of certain tracts from the rainfall statement. The last subject that calls for notice in this introduction is the division of the Omissions country politically and for administrative purposes, but before entering into this, it is ^'■°™ ^^^ as well to explain exactly how far the census operations extended, and what tracts ^^„\"^ ^^' that fall within the general delimitation of India have been omitted from the enumeration. In the first place, the chief Himalayan State of Nip^l is excluded, and so has the corresponding State of Bhdtan, further east. The small State of Sikkim, which lies between these, was only enumerated informally, though as nearly as possible synchronously with the census of the rest of the country. The population is not, however, included in the general returns, as no details beyond the actual number of each race were recorded. The same process was adopted with regard to the Cis-Salwin Shan States, on the east of Burma, and in the rural parts of British Balochistan excluding, that is, Quettah, Lorelai and the railways. In the case of Manipur and of a few tracts along the northern Burma frontier, the census was taken, but in subsequent disturbances the records were destroyed. In 'the Andamans,' beyond the limits of the convict settlement of Port Blair, in the Kakhyin country, bordering on Burma and Assam, in the Trans-Salwin Shan States, and in a wild tract in the south of Rajputana, no enumeration was attempted, though in the last case a registration by households was recorded. The marginal note shows the approximate population of these tracts. There are also to be considered the small posses- sions of Portugal on the west coast and the detached settlements of Prance, which are enclaves in the provinces of Bengal and Madras. By the courtesy of the French officials a census of the latter was taken simultaneously with that of British India. The population of the Portuguese territory here shown is that of the census of August 1887, which was published in October 1892. The normal population dealt with then in the succeeding review is 287,223,431, but the full detail required in the standard schedule was not prescribed for the less advanced tracts, so that from the normal figure shown above there will be found deductions made in all the more elaborate returns, and due explanation of the difference has been appended to the tables concerned. The results of the census are shown by political and administrative divisions, on which some explanation is necessary before discussing the statistics in detail. The first subdivision is into British and Feudatory territory. The former is the dominion of the Grown, under the sole administration of the British Government, and contains 62 per cent, of the area, and 77 per cent, of the population now dealt with in con- nection with the census. The remainder is under the rule of the Native\" Chiefs, subject to the advice and control of the British Government, in its capacity of paramount power, and includes 38 per cent, of the area and 23 of the population. The higher proportion of the area in this category is due to the inclusion in some of the States of wild tracts like the Himalayan regions of Kashmer, the desert portion of the Indus valley, and nearly all the forest-covered hills of the central belt. The first-named lies outside the turmoil of the dynastic struggles that troubled Upper India for so many years, and after its brief experience of Sikh rule, was made over by the British to the chief of a warlike clan of the outer Himalaya.

British and Feudatory. 16 the territory, with the exception of the Vale of Kashmer, which, as observed above, is of but restricted area, and the southern slopes of the hills that separate it from India, has been already mentioned. Rajputdna, again, a country of large towns in an open plain, was obviously selected as its stronghold by a warlike race, which let the tide of invasion from the north-west roll along the frontier down the rich plains of the Ganges unheeded, so long as their desert home was unmolested. The plateau that forms the western portion of the central belt was carved out into estates by various adventurers from diflFerent parts of India, in the disturbed times preceding the establishment of the British dominion, and only the eastern and wilder portion contains dynasties of ancient lineage, strong in their mountain fastnesses. The eastern section of this tract of hills is split up into many petty chieftainships, as might be expected from the broken and difl&cult nature of the country. It offers no attraction to the civilised denizen of the plain, so it has been left to the scattered remains of the former occupants of the latter, driven off it to take refuge in a land that like Cameliard, before the coming of Arthur, is \" Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein. And none or few to scare or chase the beast.\" On the other hand, the alluvial plains of the Ganges valley, and the equally fertile strips along the northern coast on each side of the peninsula, fall, the one entirely, ^he other almost so, within British territory, and contain in the aggregate more than half the popnlation of India. In size and population there is no more uniformity amongst the Provinces and States of India, than amongst the political units of Europe. The British possessions were built up gradually, and with regard, as far as possible, to the demarcation in force under the government that preceded the. acquisition. Within the last generation, at all events, the transfers of territory have been comparatively trifling in extent. Amongst the more important are those of the Delhi tract to the Panjab from the Agra government, or what is still called by the clumsy and obsolete title of \" the North- West Provinces \" ; and of the Surma valley from Bengal to the then newly-formed province of Assam. In the south, again, a small tract has been detached, for adminis- trative convenience, from the Central Provinces, and added to the Presidencv of Madras, whilst the still smaller Jhansi territory was exchanged by Sindhia in 1886 for the fortress of GwaHor.: The Native States exist under the guarantee of the paramouut power, so their territorial limits are as they were found at the time when they entered into their agreements with the British Government. As the principle of guarantee is the same for small and great, these States vary in size from the dominion over a village or two, with a population of a few hundreds, to the lordship of *more than 80,000 square miles, with nearly 12,000,000 of inhabitants. For convenience in respect to their relations with the paramount power, the smaller States are grouped into Agencies, a term applied to even those of larger size, which are either much intermingled territorially, or which are of so homogeneous a constitution that a single intermediary between them and the Supreme Government is suflBcient, In both of these cases there are subdivisions of the authority of supervision, delegated to local Agencies or Residencies, but though these are recognised in the special census returns for the Agency as a whole, they do not appear in those under consideration, which deal with the aggregate as the unit. Central India, Balochistdn, and Rajputdna are the main instances of this. The smaller groups of States are combined in the Imperial returns according to the local government or administration with which they are politically connected. For example, those attached to Bombay appear in a single item in the general returns, and under 19 heads in the provincial volume, but individually they number several hundreds. It is as well to note here the distinction between the position of States such as these and that of tracts ,in Bengal, Oudh and parts of Madras, on the owners of which titular honours, similar to those of chiefs may have been bestowed by the British Government. In the former case there has been the recognition of distinct political entity, whereas the second case is merely that of an estate forming part of British territory, and with nothing but a special fiscal agreement to distinguish it from the rest. . The following table shows the area and population of each of the British Provinces and States, or, as explained . above, groups of States.

The figures can also be compared with the corre- sponding returns for countries more widely known, so that an idea more vivid than a mere statement aifords may be obtained of the relative size and population , of the different parts of India. Bengal, then, to begin with the largest of the provinces, has an area equal to that of the United Kingdom, with the addition, of a second Scotland, whilst the population is about that of the whole of the United States of America in 1890, too-ether with that of Mexico. The Presidency of Madras has the area of Prussia and Saxony, and contains a population exceeding that of those two States by that of Wurtemburg, one of the smaller members of the German Empii'e. If the native States under this government be added, the aggregate population slightly exceeds that of the United Kingdom or of Austria-Hungary, at the last census. The North-West Provinces, with Oudh and the connected States, supports nearly the same number of people as are found in the whole German Empire, though the area is something under that of Italy. Sindh and the Panjab are about equal in population to Austria, and with the States connected with the latter, to little below England and \"Wales. Similarly, Bombav and its States are comparable to Spain, Holland ' and Norway. The whole population of Brazil, with its 3,200,000 square miles of area, could be accommodated, with room to spare, in the Central Provinces, which extend over no more than 86,500 miles. Assam, on the otiier hand, shows as many people as Bavaria, but on nearly twice the area. The island of Oeylou returns about the same population as Sindh and. Berar, respectively, but the former contains nearly twice the area, and the latter little more than two-thirds. The population of Lower Burma and of Ireland could exchange places, but the former would be woefully cramped in the Emerald Isle after the enjoyment of more than twice the area in its native peninsula. In the acquisition of the rest of Burma, the second biiJe of the cherry, which Lord Dalhousie prophesied we should t 78388, 18 The smaller Statest Bombay.. Madras States.

Punjab States. have to take, tiiere has been added to the Empire the population of Switzerland, on the combined area of Portugal, Greece, Holland, and Belgium ; or nearly the area of the colony of Victoria, with more than three times the population. ^ In the aggregate, the British territories cover an area equal to that of the whole of the Teutonic countries of Europe, with the addition of Hungary, Servia, and Bulgaria. There is also the Feudatory territory, with more than the population of the United States, and with an area equal to that covered by the Triple Alliance, with Belgium and Servia thrown in. The two great agencies of Rajputana and Central India alone, extend over the area of the German Empire, and contain nearly the population of Austria. Haidrabad is as large as England and Scotland put together. Mysore is a little smaller but more populous than, Portugal; and, to compare mountainous countries together, Kashmer shows the population of Chile, but on less than a third of the area. Next to these large States or Agencies, come the groups connected with the various local governments, some of which deserve a few words of description before the general subject is dropped. The Bombay States form the largest group. Amongst them, the small State of Khairpur, still in possession of the late ruling family of Sindh, and the peninsula of Kachh, appertain to the Indus valley rather than to the rest of the Presidency. Then comes the peninsula of Saurasthra, now known as Kathiawar, from one of the dominant tribes froni the north that immigrated thither in years, gone by. Under this general title are included many small States and four of con- siderable size, Junagadh, Nawanagar, Bhaunagar, and Drangadhra. On the adjacent mainland, bordering on the western hills of the central belt, are four or five smaller groups of much the same constitution. The rest of the coast strip falling within this Presidency contains a coupl^ of small States, interesting from their connection with the former ruling races of the interior. One was the appanage of the Sidi, or Abyssinian commander of the Moghal's fleet. The other was held by a maritime chief of the Maratha race, not free from the imputation of piracy. Not to mention a few wild States imbedded in the forests at the foot of the Ghats, where these mountains fade into the central plain, the remaining States in this part of India are mostly creations of the Peshwa's rule, with the addition of Kolhapur, descending from Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha dynasty. To the south of Bombay come the States connected with the Madras Presidency, of which there are but five. Three of them are merely small, enclaves in British territory. The remaining two lie along the most fertile portion of the western coast, and the larger of them, Travancore, is the more interesting, owing to the fact that from its isolated position it has been enabled to conserve features of racial and social development long since obliterated in the busier life of the tracts repeatedly overrun by foreign influences. The small States connected with the Central Provinces, and also those attached to Bengal, have been guaranteed, for the most part, to the descendants of some of the chief forest tribes, displaced from the plains by various waves of more civilised immigrants. Nearly all of them are situated in the hilly country composing what has been called above the central belt, in its eastern section. In Bengal, however, there are two detached States, that of Hill Tipperah, under one of the tribes of the' eastern frontier, and that now called Koch-Behar, the appanage of a more northern tribe, which, since its settlement in the lower valley, has become incorporated in the general population of the Gangetic delta. There is a wide expanse of British territory between the above States and the next, which are connected with the Government of the North-West Provinces. These last are only two in number, and detached from each other. The smaller but more populous Rampur, lies imbedded in British territory. The other, Garhwdl covers a large area, sub-Himalayan in character, between the Panjdb and the North- West Provinces. After Bombay, the Panjdb Government has the largest and most populous collection of States connected with it. They can be divided into three sections. First, those of the plains, the largest of which, Patiala, Jind, and Nabha, with a few others, are known as the Sikh States. Then follows the large but sparsely peopled tract under Baha- walpiir, on the Indus, between Sindh and the northern portion of Raiputana Last come the Hill States, stretching some way into the Himalaya. These are 23 ' number, but most of them are comparatively insignificant, and though in th aggregate, of considerable area, contain but a small population. The largest' Ndhan or Sirmiir, is the best known, perhaps, from, having given its nam,e to one of the stauuuhest of the regiments of Hill-men that fought in the Mutiny. '' ' 19 In the table accompanying this cliapter, which shows the distribution of tlie Table on political divisions over the divisions based on geographical and, climatic considerations, ^^^^ ^^\" the territory under feudatory rule has, been combined with British territory, wherever it is not recognised in the general census returns as a separate unit. ■ British territory. The only topic that remains to receive notice in this introduction is the adminis- The \"dis trative subdivision of a Province. In the case of States, enough has been said to r\"?*.'!,'\" indicate the very varying character of the unit as to size and constitution, whilst the larger States are not subdivided on any uniform system. In British territory the diversity is mainly in size, as the authority and duties of the officer placed in charge are everywhere the same, in so far as responsibility is in question. From an administrative point of view , the head of a State is not assumed to be bevond the influence of bad advisers, whatever be the range of his sovereignty. In Russia, again, it is said that when anything goes wrong, investigation begins at the bottom, and the tendency is to throw the responsibility upstairs, as far as audacity can carry it. But in British India, experience has dictated the judicious middle course of combining considerable power with full, responsibility over an area and population within the compass of one man's efficient supervision. In detail, the size of the district differs from province to province mainly according to the system of administering the land and its revenue ; but, even within the province itself there is much variety, as can be seen from the following table : — — I — ■ Extremes.

C 2 t Excluding Bombay city and Aden. § Excluding Rangoon city. 20 The exponential figures above each item represent the percentage of the mean variation from the arithmetical mean of the province as a whole. For example, tHe average area of a district in Bengal is 3,224 square miles, but owing to the number of districts of considerably greater or less area, there will be found, on the whole, a difference of 43 per cent, between that figure and the area of any single district. On the other hand, in Berar, where the number of districts is small, and they are more uniform in size, the mean difference of the average is less than 11 per cen.. Such additions to an average are of use in so far as they indicate whether the mean figure is typical within the province, or, on the contrary, is no more than an arithmetical expression, serving only to compare one province with another. It is clear that the figures in the margin belong to the latter class, for even in Berar we find the area of the smallest district is 2,623 square miles, and that of the largest 3,911. But the more valuable comparison is between the average of one province and that of another, and it is also interesting to set beside these averages the areas and populations of better-known tracts, such as those of an English county. For instance, the average Indian district covers an area just below that of Devon and Cornwall, or the four Home counties, whilst its population is about equal to that of the three northern counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, with that of little Huntingdonshire thrown in. Of the provincial averages, and taking into consideration both area and population, it will be seen that the heaviest charge is to be looked for in Madras, where, if the three Agency tracts are considered to be separate units, the district is about the size of Yorkshire, or of the Grand Duchy of Baden, with the population of Nottingham and Durham. If we take the Agency tracts to be part of the district to which they are subordinate, which can fairly be ^done, we raise the hvea to nearly that of Wales, minus Anglesea, with a considerably larger population than that of the \" gallant little \" kingdom. The provincial average that comes nearest to that of the country at large is found in Bombay, which approaches in area the three south-western counties of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, with a population that lies between that of Devon and Cornwall, on the one hand, and Somerset and Cornwall on the other. In some cases it appears that the discrepancy between area and population is very large. For example, in Upper Burma, the population of Tyrone is found scattered over four times the area. In the lower section of that province the area is much the same,, but the population rises to more than that of Tyrone and Fermanagh together. The same disproportion is observable in Sindh, where, on the area of the four northern English counties, plus the West Riding, there is a population equal only to that of Westmoreland and Northumberland, or within a little of that of New Zealand. The contrary state of things is seen in Bengal and Oudh, where the district is small in size, but contains a very large population. The average Bengal district compares very well in both respects with Norfolk combined with Staffordshire, and one district, we may remark, in passing, contains almost as many people as the Kingdom of Saxony, within far less space. The North- West Provinces, taken with Oudh, as in the table under consideration, show an average of the area of Norfolk, and twice the population ; but Otidh alone shows nearly the population of Staffordshire on the area of Northumberland. Half Wales in area, with the population of Glamorgan, about represents the Panjab district, and that in Berar would just overlap Gloucester and Somerset, but its population is scarcely that of the latter alone. The former furnishes in population a close parallel to a Central Province district, which, however, has nearly four times the area, as is the case with Burma. With this the list closes, and enough has been said to give some notion of the dimensions of the district unit, though there is nothing in the description that serves to delineate the great importance of the position held by this division of territory in the adminis- trative scheme of the British dominions in India. A few words, however, will not be out of place as to the part played by the district in the census operations. In the first place, it is the unit of compilation in the provincial returns, so the tables of specific population in the next chapter and of the movement of the population in that which follows it are all based on the district figure. Still more to the point is the fact that all the details of the arrangements for taking the census and for providing agency for the enumeration and also, in most provinces, for the tabulation of the results were left in the hands of the district ojBBcer, acting under the instructions of the Provincial Superintendent of the census operations, so that the accuracy of the work was mainly dependent on the efficiency of his supervision. It was directly from his hands that the preliminary totals were received in the central compilation office for India, at Simla, and as it has been already mentioned that these last were furnished in time for publication five weeks from the date of the census, it is super- fluous to add comment on the admirable co-operation and energy that characterised the connection of these officers with so heavy an addition to their current duties. 21 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLITICAL DIVISIONS OF INDIA.* * See page 17.

The population of India, which was roughly set forth in the statements incor- porated in the last chapter, has now to be considered in its relation to the land, and again, with reference to its social distribution, into rural a,nd urban communities. As regards the former, the average number of persons to some conventional unit of area, such as the square mile, affords the best means of comparing one country or tract with another, with respect to the general distribution of its inhabitants. But we must discriminate between the density, as this ratio is called, and the pressure of the population. A low specific population may imply pressure, as much as a high one, and, conversely, great density is not incompatible with a high standard of comfort. We need not look beyond India to find two tracts with an equally small number of inhabitants per mile, m one of which the sparsity is due to some physical cause, and may thus be considered more or less permanent ; whereas in the other political uncertainty alone has impeded the exploitation of what is by nature capable of supporting eight or nine times the existing population. Again, we see people crowded to a degree that in a rural community is almost incredible, but proving by their continued multiplication that the margin of subsistence has not yet been reached, whilst in other tracts, about the same specific population is only maintained by the habitual importation of food supplies from outside. These last are, however, very rare in India, where the bulk of the population is engaged in the production of food, and the preponderance of mining and manufacturing industries that is found in England, Saxony, and parts of Belgium, is unknown. The most densely peopled tracts of rural India are, as a rule, no worse off than the denizen of happy Auburn, for whom \" Light labour spread her wholesome store ; Just gave what life required, but gave no raore.'' But there is no doubt that the region of periodic rainfall is not the place for the experiment of hov\\- fine the provision of nature can be run, and apart from the tracts mentioned above, which are habitually not self-supporting, there are others in which the return from land is so near the economic limit that little more than the year's supply of food is to be expected from it. If, then, they fall within the zones of uncertain rain, described in the introductory chapter, a large number of people have to resort to the market as purchasers, and though the greatly iucreased facilities for transport have tended to equalise prices, there is no doubt that the normal rates have been raised throughout the country, and the agriculturist has to face the change from another point of view than that which he occupies in a good year. But even in the parts of India thus unfavourably situated the amount of capital put by is remarkable. As in the days of Bernier, it is chiefly in the form of gold 'and silver ornaments; but these are now more apparent than when he wrote, irrespective of the relative amount, for it was then the object of every man to conceal the fact that he was other than a pauper, whereas uow-a-days, the pemlulum has swung to the other extreme, and the police courts show too frequently the temptations put before the criminal classes by the display of ornaments of value on the person of women and children when on journeys and in other comparatively unprotected situations This form of wealth is generally kept in the family, and it takes quite exceptional circum- stances to bring it into the market. A striking instance of this was afforded durino- the hard times of 1876-78 in southern and western India. In the early yeai's of tha't decade, barring a short period in 1871, the average monthly value of the ornaments sent to the Bombay Mint was only Rs. 6,000. A rise took place at the end of 1876 and continued till it reached Rs. 1,900,000 in September 1877. With the return f good times to the south the amount decreased, but in 1878 the scarcity in some of tl° Fative States in Gujarath raised it again to about Rs. 7(''0,000 till the end of the ' The rarity of these manifestations of distress indicates that the landed class generaHy 25 raises crop enough to cover what may be termed normal fluctuations. There is also to be borne in mind the fact that the system of village finance adapts itself very fairly to the circumstances with which it has to deal, and often helps the raiat to tide over a crisis. In the first statement given in the introduction there is a column showing the General mean number of persons per square mile in each of the chief physical divisions. It density. was inserted in anticipation of the present explanations, in order to give some general notion of the difi'erent circumstances, in this respect, of the various parts of the country. For the whole of India the ratio is 184 persons. But, as has been already ' put forward, the mean of so many and diverse component parts is of little or no value except as a standard by which the difiereuce of the said parts from each other can be judged. We may compare, for example, the above figure with the corresponding ratio in the case of France, which is 188 ; but the area of France is but about 204,000 square miles, against the 1,560,000 of India, and the population of the former is less than that of the Indian province which stands only third in this respect. To go no further than the general statement just quoted, it will be seen that this mean of 184 is exceeded in only 31 per cent, of the area, and that it is not reached, therefore, in the remaining 69. But the above 31 per cent, contains no less than 62 per cent, of the population, and when the distribution is made in smaller divisions, a rather higher proportion will be found in this category. For instance, in Statement A. below, which is compiled by districts and States, to the exclusion of the four cities coming under separate heads in the returns, the population in. higher ratio of density than the average is given as nearly 67 per cent.

The first item, therefore, represents a density per square mile less than the mean figure by 75 per cent, or more, whilst the last line but two gives the figures of area and population exceeding the mean by more than 200 per cent. The table speaks for itself, but there are a few curious coincidences in it which are worth notice. The largest item of area, for example, is equivalent, proportionally, to the largest item of population at the opposite end of the table ; and, again, the proportion of population in the former , group is almost exactly the same as that in the corresponding group above the mean. Then the ratios to the total of area and population respectively very nearly coincide in the groups within 20 per cent, of the mean on both sides, whilst the divergence is, of course, widest at the ends of the scale, in both directions. There is, however, a defect in this statement which must receive mention, as it affects the regularity of the distribufc]on' between the groups in the lower densities. It is due to the fact that in the case of Kashmer and Central India there are no measurements available of the subdivisions by which the returns of the census results have been compiled. Kashmer is said to contain an area of 80,900 miles in the aggregate, but it is well known that the density is much higher in the valley and the Wazirats of Jammu than it is in the highlands of Ladakh, Baltistan, or Grhilgit.

The case is the same with the group showing a density of between 20 and 33 per cent, below the mean, because in it is included the whole of the Central India Agency, in which there are several subordinate political divisions each known to present a different density, but the areas are not accurately distinguished. Table A. can now be left, and consideration given to that on the opposite page, British marked B,, which relates to British territory alone. Here we are dealing with district terntor7. units, so the data are on a uniform basis. In the introduction it was explained that the States included most of the more thinly populated tracts of the country, so it is not surprising that their average density in the aggregate should be no more than 111, whilst in the British provinces it is 230. In Table B., therefore, the mean taken is this last figure, but in other respects the statement is framed just in the same way as the other. As regards the distribution of the population and area, it will be seen that the proportion of the former below the mean is just below two-thirds instead of 69 per cent., whilst that of the population is also slightly less. It is worth note, too, that about 45 per cent, of the population is massed in a density of 460 and over, which IB double the mean ratio of the British territory, as a whole. In Europe we find three countries with a density of 500 per mile and over ; England and \"Wales, with 500, Belgium witli 540, and Saxony with nearly 600. The aggregate population of these three is about 38^ millions. In British India there are 37^ millions of the inhabitants living in the ratio of more than one per acre, or 784, on the average, to the mile. No less than 21^ millions are packed to the extent of 877. The whole of the 37^ millions in question are to be found in the Grangetic valley and the Delta, and with the exception of 2i millions, ^hich may be called suburban, live, in the main, by cultiva- tion of the soil. It will be necessary to revert to these tracts in the next chapter, when the increase or decrease of the population is in question. If we refer to the other end of the statement, we find over 182,000 square miles with an average population of 24 each. The greater part of this group falls within Upper Burma, the hill tracts of Assam, and the desert portion of Sindh. With regard to the general distribution shown in the rest of the table, it will suffice to note, first, how very small a proportion of either area or population lies within 10 per cent, of the general mean, whether we take it above or below that figure. This fact bears out in a striking- manner the statement made above, that the latter cannot be used in discussing the census results as typical of the country, but only as a means of measuring divergencies in various parts of it. Again, as to the composition of the larger groups below the ' mean, it is worth mentioning that nearly half the Central Provinces and Berar falls within the group averaging a density of 136 per mile. To the next group, with 166, the northern districts of the Madras Presidency, and the Bengal portion of the Central Belt, separating the Ganges basin from that of the Mahanadi, are the chief con- tributors. The groups just' noted above as lying immediately round the mean, with an average density of 224 and 236 respectively, include the remaining districts of the North Coromandel coast, and a considerable portion of Bombay. Then, crossing the line, we come to the districts of the southern plain and of parts of the Panjab. Passing over the next few groups, which are formed out of a few tracts from several provinces, we come to that of which the mean density is 434 per mile, or nearly double the general average. The bulk of this is contributed by the west-central tract of the North- Western Provinces, with the aid of a few sub-montane districts of the Panjab, and of the less thickly peopled tracts of Bengal. \"When we reach the higher specific rates, we find only a single district of Bombay, a couple of Madras, and five of the Panjab, standing out amidst the enormous masses of the Gangetic valley. Before entering further into the details of the provincial distribution of the popula- tion according to density, it will be interesting to deal with the subject in its more general form, in connection, that is, with the distribution of both area and population according to rainfall. For this purpose,, Table C. is appended. It includes the whole of India, British Density and Feudatory, for which rainfall returns are available to a trustworthy extent. For ^°^P^^?^, reasons already given in the introduction, those for Lower Burma are too partial for ^|]_ use, and it would be misleading to enter the whole of such widely spread tracts as Central India and Kashmer without splitting them up according to_ the known variety of their conditions as to humidity. The detached Settlements, again, are too small to be taken into consideration, even if full information respecting them were at hand. The omissions, being mostly those of sparsely populated country, have raised the general D 2 28 average of density to nearly the mean between that of India, as a whole, and that of British territory alone, as given in the two preceding tables.
