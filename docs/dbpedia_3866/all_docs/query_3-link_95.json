        "text": "Netflix was pretty much a staple of 2020 life for many – I mean, how often were you asked for boxset recommendations or if you thought Carol really did feed her husband to the tigers?\n\nWhile being a form of escapism for many at that time, I wanted to expand on the inspiration and education it can also bring, by sharing some of my favourite alternative documentaries, series and films.\n\nWith that said, here are 9 spiritual shows to watch on Netflix that I’d recommend adding to your watch list for the months ahead, starting with…\n\nhow to change your mind\n\nAuthor Michael Pollan takes another look at psychadelics beyond the hearsay they were associated with in past years. In this docuseries, he looks at their true effects and crucially, some of the hidden historical context that helped form peoples ideas about them.\n\nThrough new research and testing, he considers the potential of these substances to heal and change minds as well as culture, looking into OCD, PTSD, alcoholism and depression among others. I found the research and new way to view psychadelic therapy as a way to ‘revolutionize mental health care’ fascinating and could really align with the questions asked and thoughts left to mull over. What could be, if we changed our view or opened our minds to new ways of being? A very intriguing watch. Watch How To Change Your Mind here.\n\nThe Goop Lab\n\nNow, after hearing about Gwyneth Paltrow’s recommendations on the Goop website – plugging rose quartz love eggs in your vagina and selling a candle that smells of actual vagina (is this woman vajayjay mad at this point?!) – I wasn’t sure how to feel about The Goop Lab series.\n\nI couldn’t have been more wrong. The 6 episodes are informative, touch on topics rarely seen on mainstream TV and actually showed a side of Paltrow I really liked.\n\nThe episodes focused on topics such as cold water therapy, taking magic mushrooms to facilitate psychedelic psychotherapy, and the power of energy healing. Some of it is very, how do I say this…LA… but it’s a great series to watch all in all. Watch The Goop Lab here.\n\nBrene Brown: The Call to Courage\n\nI have a confession. In the self-development world, Brene Brown is quite the icon. But until 2019 when I watched this show, I’d never been lucky enough to hear of her work.\n\nA friend recommended The Call to Courage on an Instagram story and I settled down for the evening. If I say that hour went too quickly and I could have sat through that three times over, it still wouldn’t explain the levels of how much I adored this talk and how much I was able to take from it.\n\nBrown talks about what it really takes to step out of comfort zone in life, while society is defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty.\n\nOne stand-out moment was when the research professor talks about how she was swimming with her husband, and while she tried to connect by talking about how amazing their swim was, he was short and didn’t react in the way she wanted. When they got back to the shore, Brown had created a number of scenarios in her head, all leading to her husband not finding her attractive in her costume, not feeling the same way about her anymore – when in fact, he was trying to hold off a panic attack and it had nothing to do with his wife. It was the story she was telling herself. What story, or stories are you telling yourself? Watch Brene Brown: The Call to Courage here.\n\nHeadspace: Guide to Meditation\n\nWhether you’re looking to kickstart your meditation journey or you’d like to learn more about the science behind it, this new Netflix series in collaboration with Headspace is the perfect watch.\n\nAnimated rather than filmed, this 8-part series covers everything from how to get started towards a calmer, clearer mind, through to falling in love with life, how to deal with anger, and how to achieve your limitless potential.\n\nEach episode is approximately 20 minutes long, so it creates the perfect midday lunch-break watch to reset and realign. Watch Headspace Guide to Meditation here.\n\nSurviving Death\n\nNow, on the scale of 1 to 10 on the spiritual shows to watch on Netflix chart, I’d say Surviving Death is right up there at the top.\n\nCovering subjects such as near-death experiences, signs from the dead and mediumship, the most mind-blowing episode has to be episode six, Reincarnation.\n\nInterviewing children who claim to have lived another life, with incredible findings, it really is one of those shows that you struggle to comprehend whilst watching.\n\nOne thing to note, however, is the episode on mediumship; I have seen a number of mediums in my time, some fake, some amazing at their job, and this episode and the ambiguous nature of their statements made me doubt their skills. I’d suggest watching for yourself and telling me what you think. Watch Surviving Death here.\n\nTony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru\n\nAuthor, coach and motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, is quite the figure in the self-development world. With his stature and larger than life stage presence, Robbins is fascinating to watch.\n\nThe Netflix show, I Am Not Your Guru takes a look at one of Robbins’ annual week-long seminars, which people pay thousands to attend.\n\nWith 12-hour days – sometimes longer – alongside often unorthodox coaching methods, the documentary highlights exactly what goes on behind the scenes during this huge event, including keeping the room in a state of constant coldness to keep attendees alert throughout, and fire-walking.\n\nIf you’ve ever been curious about the workings of Tony Robbins, then this is the watch for you – but at close to 2 hours long, be sure to set plenty of time aside. Watch Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru here.\n\nDare to Dream\n\nAdding something a little more light-hearted to the list of spiritual shows to watch on Netflix, Dare to Dream is a feature film from the creators of The Secret.\n\nStaring Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas, the film tells the story of how a widow meets an uplifting professor who tries to teach her about the law of attraction and how her thoughts could change her future.\n\nWithout giving anything away, Dare to Dream is romantic, a little predictable and a feel-good family film to watch on a Sunday afternoon. The perfect way, if you ask me, to explain how powerful our thoughts are to little members of the household. Watch Dare to Dream here.\n\nlive to 100: secrets of the blue zones\n\nI wanted to book a plane ticket, before I’d even finished watching this. But I realised that actually, much of what was demonstrated in this series, wasn’t about where you live, but how you live.\n\nIn the show, Dan Buettner visits five places around the world where people are regularly living to – and thriving at – 100 years old, to discover if there are any commonalities between the communities.\n\nSummarising his findings, the similar threads are all around how we connect with others, how we move in our day to day, what and how we eat and the outlook we have on life. The main lesson that came from this heartening watch for me was simplify, simplify, simplify. This show definitely speaks to the action part of attraction and the power of our mindset. Watch Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones here.\n\nHow to get rich\n\nThis show, led by financial expert Ramit Sethi, is another big tick for putting the action into attraction. I love that throughout it, he asks all of the participants and us at home to consider what our rich life looks like, acknowledging that the answer will be and should be different for each of us.\n\nThe show looks at helping people to figure out what their rich life looks like, helping them to spend in line with that and their financial values and overcome some of the obstacles in the way of that.\n\nIt’s a great show on financial education without judgement. I would have welcomed this big time in my life in my late 20s. Watch How To Get Rich here.\n\nSo there you have it, nine of my favourite spiritual shows to watch on Netflix.\n\nHave you watched any of these? Do you have any recommendations for me now you know the kind of films that get me hooked? Leave me a comment below or pop over to Instagram @themanifestationcollective and let’s chat."
