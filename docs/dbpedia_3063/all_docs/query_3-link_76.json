        "text": "Fagel Attraction\n\nAfter his laptop computer is stolen, Will (Eric McCormack) meets a sociable police detective (Oscar-winning guest star Michael Douglas, \"Wall Street,\" \"Traffic\") who takes a special interest in his case as they go undercover - but Will doesn't know that the gumshoe is secretly participating in Jack's (Sean Hayes) therapy group for gays. Elsewhere, Grace (Debra Messing) is again hassled by her psycho neighbor Val (guest star Molly Shannon, NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\") who \"opens\" a rival design business and prospers by stealing Grace's ideas. Barry Livingston (\"My Three Sons\") guest stars as Grace and Val's potential client. Megan Mullally also stars.\n\nIn the Blood\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr. explores the roots of actor Michael Douglas & writer-director Lena Dunham. Both guests are the children of famous artists--and both proudly followed in their parentsâ footsteps. But their family trees contain a cast of characters whose lives were forgotten. Gates recovers them, telling fascinating stories from the shtetls of Eastern Europe to the streets of colonial America."
