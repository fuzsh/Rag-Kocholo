        "text": "Video by MONA productions // Wednesday, Apr. 26, 2017\n\nTracing one minute in every year of filmmaker Jonas Mekas‘ life, Douglas Gordon‘s memoir-style film ‘I Had Nowhere to Go’ begins with a story of the first image Mekas ever made, in his native Lithuania, under the authority of Soviet soldiers. In the second part of Berlin Art Link’s studio visit with Gordon, he recounts the process of filming Mekas’ life story; the film is based on Mekas’ published book of the same name, about his flight from Lithuania through Europe to America. Gordon reflects on the visually bare quality of ‘I Had Nowhere to Go’, which highlights the importance of the voice in storytelling and the trail of hidden images in Mekas’ own work.\n\nVideo by MONA productions, Videographer/Editor: Peter Cairns, Producer/Interviewer: Monica Salazar\n\nThis video is Part 2 of a 2-part series of interviews with Douglas Gordon. You can find Part 1 here.\n\nArtist Info"
