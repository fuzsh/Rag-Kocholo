Based on the popular NBC radio series The Great Gildersleeve created by Leonard L. Levinson, which ran from 1941 to 1950, this is the first of four films in the Gildersleeve series produced and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. The screenplay was written by Jack Townley and Julien Josephson, and the film stars Harold Peary and Jane Darwell. Other films in the series are Gildersleeve's Bad Day (1943), Gildersleeve on Broadway (1943) and Gildersleeve's Ghost (1944).\n\nThrockmorton P Gildersleeve is amorously pursued by the sister of his rival in town, Judge Horace Hooker. Also, Gildersleeve's niece and nephew concoct a campaign to make him the most popular man in town so the judge won't force the kids to become wards of the court if Gildersleeve doesn't get married and provide the children with a mother.\n\nHarold Peary as Throckmorton P.
