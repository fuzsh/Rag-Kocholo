As a teenager, he worked in the office at Hal Roach Studios between bit parts in the films before becoming assistant director to Gus Meins, who he would replace as director in the Our Gang shorts after the shorts were reduced to one-reelers. After Hal Roach sold the studio to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1939, Douglas followed the Rascals to MGM for just two shorts and returned to Hal Roach right after, leaving Our Gang to the mercy of Robert A. McGowan. Staying with Hal Roach Studios almost indefinitely, he became disillusioned when Roach left the studio to the U. S. Army for the production of wartime training films. He moved to RKO and later to Columbia Pictures in 1948 and Warner Brothers in 1950. He died of cancer in 1993 in Los Angeles, California at the age of 85. He is survived by his wife and two children.\n\nList of Shorts[]\n\nTeacher's Pet - as actor\n\nBig Ears - as actor\n\nBirthday Blues - as actor\n\nBored Of Education\n\nTwo Too Young\n\nPay As You Exit\n\nSpooky Hooky\n\nGeneral Spanky\n\nReunion In Rhythm\n\nGlove Taps\n\nHearts Are Thumps\n\nThree Smart Boys\n\nRushin' Ballet\n\nRoamin' Holiday\n\nNight 'N' Gales\n\nFishy Tales\n\nFraming Youth\n\nThe Pigskin Palooka\n\nMail And Female\n\nOur Gang Follies Of 1938\n\nCanned Fishing\n\nBear Facts\n\nThree Men In A Tub\n\nCame The Brawn\n\nFeed 'Em And Weep\n\nThe Awful Tooth\n\nHide And Shriek\n\nThe Little Ranger\n\nParty Fever\n\nOther Projects[]"
