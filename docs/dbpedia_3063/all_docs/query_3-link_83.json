        "text": "The movie starts with Holly asking Elvis's character, \"I wonder where the road goes?\" And he logically responds, \"It's hard to tell just looking at one end.\" And this is how this Elvis adventure starts in his first comedy - considered the best of 1962. It's a movie not only quite funny with lots of laughs, but also an exhibition of the worst side of human nature, that shows the bad guys come under many disguises - not just like Nick and Carmine, but also as some authority figures, like Arthur King and Alicia Claypoole.\n\nWhen Elvis met Albert Hand on the scene of Kid Galahad, in Idyllwild, close to Hollywood, he told him, quite excited, \"This Pioneer Go Home is the best thing I ever done. And what is funnier is that it wasn't supposed to be funny in the first place.\" And on the author of the novel, he said, \"The man who wrote the story understood his business. I had lots of fun making this movie, during the breaks we tossed fish at each other. Arthur O'Connell, my father in the family... he taught me a lot!\"\n\nHis co-star in the movie, Anne Helm, talked about the time they spent during the footage breaks in that little Florida village, \"We had to come up with our own pastimes when we weren't filming. We used to go swimming and play cards and Monopoly. The cards were the most popular game of the evening. Most of us didn't have money to play, so Elvis used to hand over bank notes to everybody and then he just went and win it all back. I think he's quite lucky. He used to sing for us and it was always very thrilling. And then there was karate. It's his biggest hobby.\" Anne continues, \"He's not like the public figure at all. He's much more than a rock'n'roll symbol. He's a man of principles. He does a lot for people and noboby knows about it. And some of the things he does are often distorted. It's a pitty he's such a big legend. That distorts the real person. He loves his popularity, but that makes him look as if he doesn't have any flaws. Others put him in a pedestal. They only see the public idol and never realize the deepness of his character.\" Anne's mother added, \"Many sensacional things are written about Elvis, but he ignores them. That doesn't mean, though, that sometimes they make him hurt.\"\n\nAnne Helm was twenty-two years old, a seven-year veteran of television, modelling, and ballet, who had made a previous movie, but this was her big break. \"I was not really a fan of Elvis - I was so caught up in my own career I was almost like an old lady in my view of him - but I loved the part. I met him on location. He came to my cabin on the day that I arrived and brought me a flower. He may have just picked the flower on the way over to the cabin, who knows? But we went for a ride and turned the radio on - and he was on the radio. It was a bizarre date.\""
