        "text": "Gordon is someone who lives and loves to laugh! His comedy skills took him from the nightclubs in Philadelphia to Hollywood - and then ended up in ministry!\n\nLearning from his comedy hero Red Skelton, Gordon’s comedy mixes real life stories with “off the wall” physical comedy and his own hilarious view of life. He helps us see the funny things all around us and find joy no matter what we are going through.\n\nBesides his vast comedy background, Gordon was named Who’s Who in America’s Universities when he graduated from Philadelphia Biblical University in 1995. For the last 20 years Gordon has served as the head of the pastoral board of the Delaware County Pregnancy Center and regional coordinator of the National Day of Prayer. In his spare time he is still the President of Therapeutic Construction and Design- making custom equipment for folks with disabilities. In honor of his hero Bob Hope, Gordon started Operation Bellylaughs, sending comedy DVDs to the troops.\n\nIf you want a speaker that will help your supporters to Celebrate, Motivate, and then to Donate- Gordon Douglas is a great choice. He has been on the board of his local pregnancy center for over 25 years. He has a serious side, as a pastor, he will present your ministry and the battle for life with genuine passion. The story of his miraculous home will stir the hearts of any listener stressing how each and every life is precious, and how every life is worth fighting for. And yes, he will mix in lots of laughs along the way. His comedy program has been featured on HUCKABEE, and DRYBAR comedy. There is a reason over half of the centers that book him, have him back the next year. They had fun, they laughed, they cried, and they gave.... alot... as most banquets will set fundraising records.\n\nGordon Douglas has been married to his wife Dawn for over 35 years. They have five natural children and have opened their hearts and home to a whole lot more.\n\nMedia:\n\nhttps://glorymagazinewv.com/laugh-and-let-laugh-gordon-douglas/\n\nEvent Reviews\n\n\"Everyone that attended the event love Gordon. He was very entertaining but kept his speech relevant to our ministry.\"\n\n— First Choice Clinic\n\n\"This is the second time we have had Gordan, and we were very pleased. He had new material and even changed some things between the two events.\"\n\n— Endless Mountains Pregnancy Care Center\n\n\"Gordon is the only speaker we have had speak at our banquet - twice! We have had many speakers since we began our annual gala in 2006. But we raised the most money per person in attendance when we had Gordon. His presentation encouraged our supporters, honored our staff, and cast our vision. He helped us celebrate our successes, and gave us some great marriage and parenting tips with just the right amount of humor. But the best part of his program is the APPEAL. When Gordon does THE ASK at the end, it is not High Pressure, it is Spirit led, gentle, yet powerful at the same time. We have had several speakers since Gordon and not seen the same results, so we had to have him back again. He had lots of new stories and jokes, and we had lots more to celebrate.\"\n\n— Women's Resource Center, LA\n\n“This was the second time we’ve had Gordon. I would recommend him without ANY reservations. His presentation was wonderful (a lot of positive feedback), his appeal to give was heartfelt and sincere…working with him was special…a man of integrity…a pure pleasure!”\n\n— Capital Area Pregnancy Center\n\n“Gordon was AMAZING! We couldn’t have asked for more! Everyone Loved Gordon! People are raving about the banquet this year! Thank you!”\n\n— Nurturing Center\n\n“Gordon was very helpful and accommodating throughout the entire process. He is very professional and gracious. His performance was very funny and he mingled wit and wisdom in his material. We recommend Gordon for his humor and his heart to serve the Lord! A witty witness of grace and humility!”\n\n— ChoiceOne\n\n“THANK YOU for making our banquet a huge success…you did a great job which resulted in our BEST BANQUET EVER!”\n\n— New Hope Center\n\n\"Wow. I haven't laughed that much in a long time! Gordon made our Laugh For Life event hugely successful. He was reliable, professional, and 100% clean comedy. His calm confidence makes him easy to work with. I highly recommend Gordon Douglas as an entertainer. Our audience of 300 was on the edge of their seat laughing the entire show. A fun celebration of life and family.\"\n\n— Care Net Women's Resource Center of North County"
