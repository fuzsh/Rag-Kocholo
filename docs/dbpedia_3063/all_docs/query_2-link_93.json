He gained notoriety from the shorts he directed in the famous Our Gang (also known as the \"Little Rascals\") series. He also directed just about every cliche genre of the 1950's, including westerns, science fiction, monster movies, swashbucklers and even a handful of comedies. On November 29, 1993 he passed away at the age of 85, having directed 98 films and shorts."
