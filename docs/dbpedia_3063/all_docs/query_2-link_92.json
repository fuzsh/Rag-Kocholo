        "text": "Biography\n\nBorn Gordon Douglas Brickner, he began his career as a child actor, appearing in some films directed by Maurice Costello. He also worked at MGM as a book-keeper.\n\nHal Roach and Our Gang\n\nAs a teenager he got a job at the Hal Roach Studios, working in the office and appearing in bit parts in various Hal Roach films. He made walk-on appearances in at least three Our Gang shorts: Teacher’s Pet, Big Ears and Birthday Blues.\n\nBy 1934 Douglas was assistant to director Gus Meins and served as assistant director on Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy’s 1934 film Babes in Toyland and on the Our Gang comedies made between 1934 and mid-1936.\n\nBeginning with Bored of Education in 1936, Our Gang moved from two-reel (20-minute) comedies to one-reel (10-minute) comedies, and Douglas became the senior director of the series. Bored of Education won the 1936 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film, and was the only Our Gang entry ever honored with the award. Douglas remained with the series as director for two years.\n\nHis Our Gang shorts, featuring Spanky, Alfalfa, Darla, Porky, Buckwheat, Waldo, Butch and Woim, are the most familiar in the series’ 22-year canon.\n\nDouglas worked on the Our Gang feature General Spanky (1936). His shorts included Spooky Hooky (1936) and Pay as You Exit (1936).\n\nRoach sold the Our Gang unit to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in May 1938. Douglas directed two MGM Our Gangs on loan from Roach, The Little Ranger (1938) and before deciding that he could not get used to the more industrialized atmosphere at the larger studio.\n\nReturning to his home studio, Douglas directed the feature Zenobia (1939) with Oliver Hardy teamed with Harry Langdon instead of Stan Laurel. It was a box office disappointment so Laurel and Hardy were reunited for Douglas' next film, Saps at Sea (1940) (Laurel and Hardy's last film produced by the Hal Roach Studio) and All-American Co-Ed with former Our Gang member Johnny Downs..\n\nDouglas then made Niagara Falls (1941), one of Hal Roach's Streamliners, a series of short features less than 50 minutes.\n\nFor Roach he co-wrote and directed the feature Broadway Limited (1941) and provided the story for Topper Returns (1941). His last film for Roach was the featurette The Devil with Hitler (1942). He might have stayed with Roach indefinitely, but Roach turned his studio over to the U.S. Army for the production of wartime training films.\n\nRKO Films\n\nDouglas moved over to RKO Pictures. He made a series of low budget comedies including The Great Gildersleeve (1942), based on the radio show; and its sequel Gildersleeve on Broadway (1943), Gildersleeve's Bad Day (1943) and Gildersleeve's Ghost (1944). He also helmed The Falcon in Hollywood (1944), Girl Rush (1944), A Night of Adventure (1944), First Yank into Tokyo (1945).\n\nHe made Zombies on Broadway (1945) with the comedy team of Brown and Carney, then San Quentin (1946), Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946) and If You Knew Susie (1948).\n\nColumbia Films\n\nIn 1948 Douglas migrated from RKO to producer Edward Small who had a releasing deal with Columbia Pictures. For Small he made Walk a Crooked Mile (1948) and The Black Arrow (1948).\n\nColumbia used Douglas on Mr. Soft Touch (1949), Between Midnight and Dawn (1950), Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950), Fortunes of Captain Blood (1950), and The Nevadan (1950). They loaned him to British Lion to make State Secret (1950) in England.\n\nCagney Productions and Warner Bros\n\nJames Cagney was making a film for Warner Bros, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950) with his brother William, and they hired Douglas to direct. Douglas signed long-term deals with Cagney Productions and Warners.\n\nFor Paramount he made The Great Missouri Raid (195. He was meant to make a second film for Paramount but they released him so Cagney could use him again on Only the Valiant (1951) a Western with Gregory Peck.\n\nDouglas went on to established himself as one of Warners' leading directors of the 1950s, working in all genres: I Was a Communist for the FBI (1951); Come Fill the Cup (1951), produced by Cagney starring James Cagney; The Iron Mistress (1952) a biopic of Jim Bowie starring Alan Ladd; Mara Maru (1952), an adventure story with Errol Flynn; So This Is Love (1953), a musical biopic of Grace Moore; The Charge at Feather River (1954), a 3D Western; She's Back on Broadway (1953), a musical; Them! (1954), a science fiction film; Young at Heart (1955), with Doris Day and Frank Sinatra; Sincerely Yours (1955) with Liberace; The McConnell Story (1955), a biopic of Joseph C. McConnell with Alan Ladd; Santiago (1956) with Ladd; Bombers B-52 (1957) and The Big Land (1957), a Western with Ladd.\n\nHis three low-budget westerns starring Clint Walker--Fort Dobbs (1958), Yellowstone Kelly (1959) and Gold of the Seven Saints (1961, from a screenplay by Leigh Brackett originally commissioned by Howard Hawks)--have been compared to Budd Boetticher's contemporary minimalist westerns with Randolph Scott.\n\nHe did The Fiend Who Walked the West (1958) at 20th Century Fox and Up Periscope (1959) for Warners.\n\nHe had a hit with Claudelle Inglish (1961) and The Sins of Rachel Cade (1961).\n\nFreelance Director\n\nDouglas directed Elvis Presley in the comedy Follow That Dream (1962) made for Mirisch Productions and did Bob Hope's Call Me Bwana (1963) for Eon Productions.\n\nHe did a Western at Fox Rio Conchos (1964) then made the heist comedy Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964) for Frank Sinatra's company, starring Sinatra.\n\nDouglas made two films starring Carroll Baker, Harlow (1965) and Sylvia (1965).\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nFor 20th Century Fox Douglas directed Jerry Lewis in the science fiction spoof Way...Way Out (1966), did the remake of Stagecoach (1966) and made In Like Flint (1967) with James Coburn.\n\nDouglas made Tony Rome (1967) with Sinatra at Fox, and the Western Chuka (1967) for star-producer Rod Taylor at Paramount. There were two more with Sinatra at Fox, The Detective (1968) and a sequel to Tony Rome, Lady in Cement (1968).\n\nLater career\n\nAfter the Western Barquero (1970), Douglas did Skullduggery (1970) and directed Sidney Poitier's They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1971) for the Mirisches. He did some uncredited directing on Skin Game (1971).\n\nSlaughter's Big Rip-Off (1973) was a blaxploitaton film and Nevada Smith (1975) a TV movie.\n\nDouglas returned to Warner Bros. for his final film, 1977's Viva Knievel!, in which the stuntman Evel Knievel played himself in a fanciful biography.\n\nReportedly, Douglas was the only person to ever direct both Elvis and Sinatra on film.\n\nAttempting to explain his prodigious directorial output, Douglas told Bertrand Tavernier:\n\nI have a large family to feed, and it's only occasionally that I find a story that interests me.\"\n\nDeath\n\nGordon Douglas died of cancer on September 29, 1993 in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 85. He was survived by his wife Julia Mack Douglas, son Gary Douglas, daughter Cathie Graham, and a grandson.\n\nFilmography\n\nThe Infernal Triangle (1935)\n\nLucky Beginners (1935) (short)\n\nGeneral Spanky (1936)\n\nSpooky Hooky (1936) (short)\n\nPay As You Exit (1936) (short)\n\nTwo Too Young (1936) (short)\n\nBored of Education (1936) (short)\n\nThe Pigskin Palooka (1937) (short)\n\nFraming Youth (1937) (short)\n\nFishy Tales (1937) (short)\n\nNight 'n' Gales (1937) (short)\n\nRoamin' Holiday (1937) (short)\n\nThree Smart Boys (1937) (short)\n\nRushin' Ballet (1937) (short)\n\nHearts Are Thumps (1937) (short)\n\nGlove Taps (1937) (short)\n\nOur Gang Follies of 1938 (1937) (short)\n\nReunion in Rhythm (1937) (short) aka ''Our Gang Follies in 1937\n\nAladdin's Lantern (1938) (short)\n\nThe Little Ranger (1938) (short)\n\nHide and Shriek (1938) (short)\n\nFeed 'em and Weep (1938) (short)\n\nCame the Brawn (1938) (short)\n\nBear Facts (1938) (short)\n\nCanned Fishing (1938) (short)\n\nZenobia (1939) aka Elephants Never Forget\n\nSaps at Sea (1940)\n\nNiagara Falls (1941)\n\nBroadway Limited (1941)\n\nThe Great Gildersleeve (1942)\n\nThe Devil with Hitler (1942)\n\nGildersleeve on Broadway (1943)\n\nGildersleeve's Bad Day (1943)\n\nThe Falcon in Hollywood (1944)\n\nGirl Rush (1944)\n\nGildersleeve's Ghost (1944)\n\nA Night of Adventure (1944)\n\nFirst Yank into Tokyo (1945) aka Mask of Fury\n\nZombies on Broadway (1945)\n\nSan Quentin (1946)\n\nDick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946)\n\nWalk a Crooked Mile (1948)\n\nThe Black Arrow (1948)\n\nIf You Knew Susie (1948)\n\nMr. Soft Touch (1949)\n\nHouse of Settlement (1949)\n\nThe Great Manhunt (1949)\n\nThe Doolins of Oklahoma (1949)\n\nBetween Midnight and Dawn (1950)\n\nKiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950)\n\nRogues of Sherwood Forest (1950)\n\nFortunes of Captain Blood (1950)\n\nThe Nevadan (1950)\n\nThe Great Missouri Raid (1951)\n\nCome Fill the Cup (1951)\n\nI Was a Communist for the FBI (1951)\n\nOnly the Valiant (1951)\n\nThe Iron Mistress (1952)\n\nMara Maru (1952)\n\nSo This Is Love (1953) aka The Grace Moore Story\n\nThe Charge at Feather River (1953)\n\nShe's Back on Broadway (1953)\n\nYoung at Heart (1954)\n\nThem!
