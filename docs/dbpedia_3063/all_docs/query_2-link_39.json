        "text": "I'm a Boston based Cinematographer, Filmmaker and member of ICG Local 600. I have a love of travel, bicycles, North Carolina basketball and coffee. Whether it's an independent film, corporate shoot, or documentary production in a remote location, I'm all in to make the production the best it can be. My main focus is on the project's visual design, but it is not lost on me that all of this needs to support the script and the Director's vision. Whether you're in the pre-production phase or in the midst of filming, I'm ready to come on board to help tell your story or sell your message.\n\n-Doug"
