To facilitate easy travel between Sinatra’s two jobs, the movie production converted the basement of the Fontainebleau into a film studio, where at least four sets were built, Aaron Rosenberg told the 21 February 1968 DV.\n\nSammy Davis, Jr., who had co-starred with Sinatra in Gordon Douglas’s Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964), was originally picked for the role of Tony Rome’s close friend and former partner, but bowed out due to other commitments, according to the 5 February 1968 DV. Sinatra gave the role to comedian Pat Henry, his opening act at the Fontainebleu. Los Angeles Rams football star Merlin Olsen also auditioned for a role, the 24 January 1968 Variety noted, but was apparently not involved in the film.\n\nThe 28 February 1968 Variety mentioned that filming had begun two days earlier, after a delay caused by Sinatra’s bout with the flu, but according to a list of studio schedules in the 8 March 1968 DV, principal photography for Lady in Cement actually began on 4 March 1968.\n\nArticles in the 4 March 1968 DV and 6 March 1968 Variety described a squabble between Twentieth Century-Fox and the Hialeah Park Race Track in Hialeah, FL. When Hialeah president Eugene Mori refused to allow Lady in Cement to be filmed there, the production moved to Gulfstream Park at Hallandale Beach, FL. Mori publicly criticized Gulfstream for hosting the film, saying: “We read the script of the movie, and it is a picture which portrays violence and underworld activity. We don’t feel the best image of racing would be served by having Hialeah, or any track, involved in such a movie.” The Gulfstream location scene was shot on 5 March 1968. A week earlier, the 29 February 1968 DV reported that 250 Florida schoolteachers, who were in the middle of a strike, were hired as extras to sit in Gulfstream’s stands behind Sinatra and actress Raquel Welch.\n\nFilming ended 5 April 1968, the 10 April 1968 Variety reported.\n\nComedian Joe E. Lewis was hired for a small part. Frank Sinatra had portrayed Lewis in the 1957 film biography The Joker Is Wild (see entry).\n\nIn one scene, actor Dan Blocker’s character sat in a motel room watching the television show Bonanza, whose theme played on the soundtrack. Blocker, who portrayed “Hoss Cartwright” on the popular program, was on hiatus during the Lady in Cement production. When Twentieth Century-Fox ran a full-page advertisement in the 6 November 1968 DV and other trade papers publicizing the film’s premiere that night at Hollywood, CA’s Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, it printed a photograph of Blocker manhandling Sinatra, with the words: “Hoss plays the heavy!”\n\nCritical reception was tepid. The 8 November 1968 LAT reported that the plot of Lady in Cement was “cumbersome without being rewardingly intricate,” and as with most sequels, “the law of diminishing returns is still in force.” The 21 November 1968 NYT called it such “a perfect blending of material with milieu that the movie’s extraordinary vulgarity and sloppiness can almost be cherished for themselves, like widescreen graffiti.”\n\nLess\n\nWhile diving for sunken treasure off the Miami coast, private investigator Tony Rome discovers the freshly-dumped nude corpse of a blonde whose feet have been encased in cement.

With the case resolved, Tony calls in Lieutenant Santini and leaves with Kit to search for sunken treasure.\n\nLess"
