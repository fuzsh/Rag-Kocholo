It is one of those international co-productions that don't belong clearly to any country so in light of the ridiculous Academy rules no country could actualy pre-nominated it in the first place (anyway most of the money came through Robert Redford so I guess it would be desqualified the same way the Jeunet film were).\n\nFilipe\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nAcabe com aquelas janelinhas que pulam na sua tela.\n\nAntiPop-up UOL - É grátis!\n\nhttp://antipopup.uol.com.br/\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n23503\n\nFrom: peckinpah20012000\n\nDate: Sun Feb 27, 2005 9:46pm\n\nSubject: Re: David E's Oscar Predictions\n\n--- In a_film_by@yahoogroups.com, David Ehrenstein\n\nwrote:\n\n> Ostentatious sentimentality -- especially when\n\n> disguised as neo-Bressionian restraint -- beats\n\n>\n\n\"Neo-Bressonian restraint\" - The mind boggles as Scotty says in\n\nTHE THING (1951).\n\nHowever, there is a really good Scorsese interview in today's LONDON\n\nTIMES.

I definitely think you shouldn't be commenting on it,\n\nalthough your honesty in stating you have seen only a small part of\n\nit is commendable. Of course, FUNNY GAMES being the fairly rare kind\n\nof film that triggers very strong gut reactions, you probably would\n\nhate it as much and for the same reasons if you had seen it from\n\nbeginning to end. Still, it seems unfair, not to say unethical, to\n\ndiscuss a film on the basis of a partial viewing. You might just as\n\nwell have rejected it, not having seen it at all, on the basis of\n\nwhat you \"picked up in conversation\". Shades of people you go out\n\nand picket a movie they haven't seen but have been told is immoral\n\nor sacrilegeous or whatever.\n\nYou say that the film depressed you, and that's understandable,\n\nbut is being depressed a valid critical objection? Many great works\n\nof art are depressing.\n\nAnd is \"I don't 'need' the film\" a valid critical objection? I\n\ndon't think any film ever made was ever \"needed\". \"Need\" is not what\n\nthe relationship to a work of art is all about. Whatever Haneke may\n\nhave said is irrelevant. Let's deal with what a film says and shows,\n\nnot what the auteur claims.\n\nJPC\n\n> On the subject of sadism, I think the BIG moral difference between\n\n> Tarantino and Haneke is that Tarantino's violence is inflicted on\n\n> fictional character for some kind of (sometimes complicated)\n\npleasure\n\n> to be gained by the audience.
