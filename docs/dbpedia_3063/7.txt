Gordon Douglas, a film director who made dozens of "Our Gang" episodes, including an Oscar winner, died on Wednesday at the Hancock Park Convalescent Home after an undisclosed illness. He was 85.

His death was reported by the home.

Mr. Douglas began his film career in the 1920's, appearing in small roles in several East Coast productions. He moved to Hollywood around 1930 and began work as a comedy writer for the producer and director Hal Roach.

He directed 30 "Our Gang" short films before breaking into feature films in 1940, when he directed the Oliver and Hardy comedy "Saps at Sea." One of the shorts was "Bored of Education," which was honored as the best one-reel film in the 1936 Academy Awards.

He later moved on to action-adventure and drama. Among his better-known works was the 1951 melodrama "I Was a Communist for the F.B.I." and westerns like "Rio Conchos" and "Yellowstone Kelly."
