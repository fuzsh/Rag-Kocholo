        "text": "Who is Japan's most popular politician of all time? Although such a survey is not readily available, he (yes, Japan has not yet had a female prime minister) would likely be Kakuei Tanaka. As the nation's top leader from July 1972 to December 1974, Tanaka had actually been despised by many for his money politics at one time, but a recent resurgence in his popularity is exemplified by new developments from some unexpected sources.\n\nA recent biography written by Shintaro Ishihara entitled Tensai, which portrays Tanaka as a political genuis, has been very successful, selling more than 450,000 copies within just two months. Meanwhile, Bungei Shunju, the monthly magazine with one of the largest circulations in Japan, carried a couple of laudatory articles about Tanaka, including an interview with Ishihara himself.\n\nIt is rather ironic that Ishihara and Bungei Shunju are now embracing Tanaka. Ishihara, a former member of Japan’s national diet and governor of Tokyo Metropolis, had been one of Tanaka's most vocal critics when he was in power, attacking him for his corrupt ways of handling politics by handing out money in all directions. And Bungei Shunju actually dealt a fatal blow to Tanaka's premiership when it carried two articles on his financial irregularities and a mistress back in October 1974. Faced with mounting criticism, Tanaka had to resign only one month later. He would eventually be arrested and convicted for taking bribes of 500 million yen from Lockheed Corporation.\n\nMoreover, Ishihara and Bungei Shunju are not unrelated. Ishihara admitted in his autobiographical essay that he was the one to recommend the editor of Bungei Shunju to publish one of two critical articles on Tanaka’s mistress. According to Akira Asaka, one of Tanaka’s closest secretaries, he took the article on his marital infidelities more seriously than the allegations of bribery.\n\nThis recent surge of interest in Tanaka reflects a general mood shift among the Japanese public. People have become fed up with indecisive politicians offering no grand visions of the future. Tanaka, on the other hand, was nicknamed the “bulldozer with a computer,” based on many anecdotes showing that he was quick to make decisions.\n\nThe speech he gave when he became the minister of finance in 1962 has become legendary, and quoted in Ishihara’s book. In front of elite MOF officials, he declared:\n\n“I am Kakuei Tanaka, a graduate of higher elementary school [unlike other notable politicians, he did not graduate a university]. You are Japan’s best and the brightest and experts on fiscal and monetary issues. I am an amateur, but have experienced trying years more than you have. I know something about doing business. I will do whatever I can do, and will not promise whatever I cannot do. We are doing business together and trusting each other is important. Therefore, I will always open the door of my office. Regardless of whether you are the vice minister or this year's newest recruit, if you have anything to say to me, come to me. You do not need to get permission from your superior. Work as much as you want. I will take all responsibilities.”\n\nMany who knew Tanaka testified that he had an astonishing memory: He memorized the names, careers, and even birthdates of his subordinates. With his gift of charming people, he left a strong impression on everyone he met, and stayed in power even after his conviction for the Lockheed scandal.\n\nThe Tanaka phenomenon is similar to the Donald Trump phenomenon currently playing out in the U.S. Both Trump and Tanaka came with business backgrounds, and both boasted about their grand visions, decisiveness and knack for getting things done.\n\nThe similarities would appear to end there, however, since Tanaka was much less offending. He also had a long and successful career as a member of the national diet before he became prime minister. Trump had no political career before he kicked off his presidential campaign.\n\nBut the Tanaka phenomenon is equally disturbing as the Trump phenomenon. People do not discuss what Tanaka really did. The notable exception is one critical article written by Taro Yayama, a political journalist, which appeared in a magazine called Voice. He recalled Tanaka’s secretary once tried to give him money when Yayama and other journalists accompanied Tanaka on an official trip. Although he declined, others except one took the money.\n\nIn the realm of economic policy, Tanaka's track record was disastrous. His grand vision was spelled out in his book Nihon Retto Kaizo Ron, published in June 1972, one month before he became prime minister. It was ghostwritten by his trusted bureaucrats (there was even an English version, Building a New Japan). It was an ambitious plan to address economic and social problems after the rapid economic growth of the 1960s. It argued that the underlying problem was the disparity between the urban and rural areas, and prescribed relocating factories away from the urban centers and connecting Japan by building high speed railways, highways and local airports.\n\nSounds good, right? No. During this period, Japan went through the so-called Lewis transformation: Japan became an urban and industrial economy from a rural and agricultural one. After this transformation, Japan actually needed to strengthen its urban sector, not weaken it.\n\nEven worse was his analysis and prescription for inflation. By that time, inflation had already crept up, becoming one of the major concerns for the general public. Tanaka wrote that inflation in Japan was not a demand-pull one. Instead, “Japan is troubled by a so-called ‘productivity-gap inflation’ caused by the fact that wages rose at the same rate for all industries regardless of their different productivities” (Building a New Japan, p.63). His plan, he claimed, was purported to be the cure for inflation by raising the productivity of underperforming industries and regions.\n\nTanaka’s ill-conceived economic policies cost him dearly. Inflation accelerated during his term, and he lost two general elections precisely because he could not control the inflation rate.\n\nThis episode has a direct implication for China right now. Although China needs stimulus to fend off the deleterious effects of asset price deflation, if policymakers adopt a Tanaka-like economic policy of expansionary fiscal policy aimed at redistribution from urban to rural sector, it would worsen the current slowdown.\n\nPerhaps a broader implication is that like other advanced economies, the Japanese people are frustrated with the current political situation. We have not yet seen a Japanese equivalent of Donald Trump, but the social mood may be suitable for one to emerge."
