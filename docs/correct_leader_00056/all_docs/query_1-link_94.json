I must express my special thanks to Andrew MacLennan who took my initial enquiry seriously and enthusiastic­ ally pursued the idea of a study of a major Japanese politician. He and Inis colleagues soon recognised the value of such a biography. I am grateful for dieir willingness to go beyond common preconcep­ tions of Japan and the Japanese. The main themes were presented at the annual Japan Politics Group Colloquium at the University of Birmingham on 7 Septem­ ber 1999. I very much appreciated the enthusiastic feedback of all the participants. Professor Tim Gray, my colleague in the Depart­ ment of Politics at the University of Newcastle, kindly read the manuscript and supplied not only corrections and helpful comments, but also much-needed encouragement. Professor Keith Robbins, the ‘Profiles in Power’ series editor, made useful suggestions and corrections which improved the quality of the final draft. Of course, any remaining errors or omissions are entirely my own. Mention should also be made of my wife, Fumie, who was very forgiving of the ways in which this manuscript preoccupied me at a critical time in her adjustment to life in Newcastle. I would like to dedicate this book to my mother, Doreen Babb. She has taught me much that informs the writing of this book. Besides, it is a dedication that Tanaka himself would understand and approve. Note: In order to avoid confusion, Japanese names are given in Western order, both in the text and in the Guide to Further Read­ ing. I have generally omitted any indication of long vowels from Japanese words and names, crucial to the correct pronunciation of Japanese, except where names had existing transliterations into a European alphabet which it seemed more logical to use.

Eight years earlier he had suffered a serious stroke from which he had never fully recovered and, in addition to a serious thyroid problem, he was now suffering from diabetes. His daughter, Makiko, had visited him on the 16th: ‘Daddy, when you feel better, let’s go for a drive.’ ‘Let’s go, let’s go,’ he replied enthusiastically. The doctor asked him, ‘W hat do you like?’ In slurred speech, ‘I like to ride in the car.’1 The next morning started a typical Tokyo winter day cold but crisp. When the doctor saw him in the morning, the man said he was sleepy. In the afternoon, however, a rare rainstorm swept into the city and the air hung heavy. The man’s breathing became difficult and by four minutes past two in the afternoon he had died of pneumonia. The man was no ordinary man. He had been influential in Japa­ nese politics in the decades after World W ar II, and between 1972 and 1985 was without question the most powerful politician in Japan. Even after his illness in 1985, and after his death, his followers and his legacy continued to shape Japan. Earlier in 1993, his daughter had been elected to his seat in the Niigata Third District which he had held since 1947. After his death, she would become one of the most popular and outspoken politicians in Japan, continuing his influence in another form. She would also become the heiress to his substantial fortune estimated at 11.9 billion yen or nearly $100 million.2 This man, Kakuei Tanaka, was by no means common, but his story is crucial to understanding the rise of the common people in postwar Japan. Pre-war Japan was hierarchical and only fitfully 1\n\nTANAKA\n\ndemocratic, but by the end of the war in 1945, the social order had collapsed and men like Tanaka rose to prominence in a way that was unthinkable before the war. Like many Japanese, he sought to rebuild his identity on the foundations of the past, and yet, much of what he did was new. After all, Japan had changed decisively. The country was more democratic, and with the aid of politicians such as Tanaka, policy was now focused on improving the economic and social standing of the average Japanese. Moreover, the collapse of the pre-war social order led in the end to an unprincipled pursuit of financial gain at the expense of sober assessment of possible con­ sequences of unbridled economic growth. The story of Tanaka’s life exemplifies this change from pre-war to postwar Japan. In addition, an exploration of Tanaka’s role in shaping the postwar period is crucial to understanding Japan today. It is impossible to ignore the pre-World W ar II past as it pro­ vided the starting point for Tanaka and all of postwar Japan. The greatest contrast between the two periods is between the hierarchy and social distinctions of pre-war Japan, and the relative equality and democracy of the postwar period. The hierarchy of pre-war Japan does still linger in many ways, not least in the levels of polite­ ness in speech and behaviour which continue to typify Japan, but the breakdown of status distinctions and the rise of the commoner are part of an ongoing process which has taken place over the past two centuries as the legacy of feudal Japan has faded and a modern Japan has begun to emerge. Moreover, the desire for democracy and economic security has led the Japanese to aspire to a ‘good life’ which is as Western as it is Japanese. Japan wholeheartedly adopted Western technology and techniques, and at the same time tried to hold on to a Japanese spirit. The result was that physical goods and processes led to the introduction of modern business enterprises, factories, newspapers, markets and ideas. This was true throughout Japan, and as time passes, it has become difficult to identify the pure elements of old Japan. This leads some Japanese nationalists to bemoan the loss of pre-war order and the rise of democracy, but it must be noted that the imperatives of domestic political and economic demands in Japan, more than any external pressures, have determined the nature of change in Japanese society, as the case of Tanaka clearly demonstrates. A romantic view of the past persists, nonetheless. Even Tanaka explained Japanese behaviour by pointing to the legacy of 250 years\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nof semi-feudal rule of the house of Tokugawa and the maintenance of hundreds of domains {ban) ruled by powerful local lords (daimyo) who were often nearly autonomous and absolute in their power over commoners who were irrevocably tied to their lands or their vocations. Tanaka’s autobiography starts by noting the historical background of his home village, in which the local lord ruled his feudal domain, like all others, by means of the samurai, who were primarily warriors at first but evolved into a class of high-level civil servants.3The power the samurai wielded over commoners is legend­ ary: they had the right to use the long and short swords they wore as symbols of their status to inflict summary punishment, including death, on those who displeased them. Tanaka’s home prefecture4 of Niigata was the site of two such feudal domains, Echigo and Echizen, where the loyalty of the people to their local lords was unques­ tioned, as in all such regions. It was natural for Tanaka to use the symbolism of the ‘Echi’ element of the names of these domains to lend weight and tradition to his own constituency support organisa­ tion, the Etsuzan Association. It would be a mistake, however, to overemphasise the continu­ ity in the influence of feudal traditions. By the nineteenth century, large numbers of samurai and entire feudal domains were slipping into debt. This increased the influence of nominally inferior financiermerchants - officially commoners - who occasionally were able to marry their children into samurai status. In the same period, peas­ ant uprisings became more frequent and severe. Thus, when Japan was thrown into crisis as a result of confrontation with the West in the mid-nineteenth century, the old feudal system easily collapsed. A political coup d'etat against the Tokugawa regime in 1868 was called the Meiji Restoration because in theory it ‘restored’ the em­ peror as the supreme ruler of Japan and was named after the new Emperor Meiji. However, the breakdown of the old feudal order did not produce a new era of egalitarianism. T H E N E W E L IT E OF P R E -W A R JA PA N As the old hierarchy was destroyed, a new one was created in its place. The leaders of the Meiji Restoration copied the system of peerage from Great Britain, giving themselves the titles of ‘count’ and ‘marquis’ despite an often middling or low samurai status, and bestowing similar status on powerful merchant families allied to the 3\n\nTANAKA\n\nnew regime. In addition, special titles and privileges were given to the various branches of the Imperial family, which had fallen into obscurity in the Tokugawa period, and to former Tokugawa lords, who were given a place in the new status hierarchy as well. W ealthy merchants, landlords and senior government officials constituted a new elite which grew in influence to occupy a central place in the pre-war regime. Two domains, Satsuma (at the far end of Japan’s southernmost island, Kyushu) and Choshu (at the southern tip of Japan’s main island, Honshu), dominated both the overthrow of the Tokugawa regime and the Meiji state formed immediately afterward. At the same time as providing themselves and their supporters with new posts and titles, the Satsuma and Choshu elite - often known as the Meiji oligarchs - modernised Japan by abolishing the old domains, stripping the samurai of their swords and their status, and pen­ sioning off lords and samurai alike in the process of creating a modern centralised state. In addition, the new regime also allowed commoners (i.e. non-samurai) to become public officials as well as soldiers and officers in Japan’s modern army and navy. This process of substituting one form of hierarchy for another did not go unchallenged, however. The early opposition to the Meiji oligarchy arose from disgruntled former samurai. While attempts to restore the old order were easily put down by the new Meiji army, the opposition was most successful when it combined radical ideas favouring democracy drawn from Rousseau with demands for an aggressive foreign policy. These demands led to a series of violent protests known as the Movement for Liberty and Popular Rights ( Jiyu Minken Undo). In order to appease the supporters of this move­ ment, the Meiji government pursued a policy of war and expansion into Formosa and Korea at the turn of the twentieth century. The government also established an elected Lower House of parliament with limited powers as part of the 1890 Imperial Constitution, though officially the concession of the constitution was a ‘gift’ of the em­ peror to his people. The movement itself, however, was quickly repressed by the authorities. Nonetheless, the first elections for the new parliament soon led to the formation of political parties, with the opposition continuing to carry the banner of the popular rights movement. The problem was, however, that MPs represented only the largest taxpayers, so the opposition spoke primarily on behalf of disgruntled landlords who bore the brunt of the tax burden. The Meiji oligarchy was able 4\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nto keep this and other new opposition parties tinder control through a combination of policies which included selective repression, bribery and the formation of a government party. However, one of the most effective methods of reducing the power of the landlord-based parties was to lower the tax requirement for voting rights and enable more non-landlords, particularly wealthier merchants and urban tax­ payers, to participate in politics. By 1926, full manhood suffrage was achieved, though landlords and wealthy merchants still dominated party politics at the local level in most districts. It was also the 1920s which saw the demise of Meiji oligarchic control of the government as the narrow elite which had carried out the Meiji Restoration died of old age. Links to the old Satsuma and Choshu domains became less important as commoners recruited and promoted on merit began to rise to the highest levels of official­ dom. This development was particularly significant in the case of the military. The death of the hardline Meiji oligarch Yamagata Aritomo in 1922 was symbolic not only of the demise of Choshu dominance of the Japanese army but of samurai dominance as well. Unfortunately, this led to a decline in discipline within the military when newly promoted officers became increasingly prone to inde­ pendent action in the field and susceptible to right-wing nationalist ideas as the old regional loyalties and samurai values declined in importance. As the 1920s came to an end, these military radicals opposed more and more openly the influence of political parties over gov­ ernment. The parties seemed poised to replace the old Meiji elite, but in the eyes of many military officers political parties seemed to be hopelessly corrupt and eager to pursue policies which weakened the role of the military. In particular, Japan’s special rights in China appeared to be threatened and Japanese national security was seem­ ingly put at risk as party governments inadvertently encouraged Chinese nationalism with policies of non-confrontation. In addi­ tion, party governments participated in the negotiation of disarma­ ment agreements and reduced the military’s budget. By the early 1930s, junior officers in the field began to take action, including participation in attempted coups against party govern­ ments and independent military initiatives in China. While the officers and their extremist right-wing allies insisted on their loyalty to the emperor and the nation, their targets were wealthy business and party leaders who represented the economic and political elite of Japan. The young military radicals sought to act on behalf of the 5\n\nTANAKA\n\ncommon people. However, in the aftermath of a failed coup in 1936, these radicals, notably the ‘imperial way’ (Kodoha) faction, were suppressed by the ‘control’ (Tosei) faction of army conservat­ ives. This control faction essentially protected the domestic Japanese elite, though it was even more aggressive internationally than the imperial way faction and effectively seized control of Japanese foreign and security policy in exchange for supporting the status quo. The political vulnerability of the Japanese elite was not surprising given its small size. A Fortune magazine special issue on Japan in 1936 put the number of Japanese ‘gentlemen’ at a minuscule 0.4 per cent of Japanese families with an annual income p er fam ily of more than $3,000 a year - approximately 50,000 out of 13,500,000 famil­ ies.' Moreover, the new elite had little credibility as the traditional elite in Japan. It was a new aristocracy based on wealth created as a result of the industrial development of Japan after World W ar I: The old feudal aristocracy of ancient bloodlines no longer makes much sense except in the lingering pride of certain of those lines. Some of the new gentlemen of Japan come from the old aristocracy, are descended from the upper levels of the feudal soldiery (samurai). But the new Japan is an industrial power, her greatest riches are industrial riches, and diey have created what is very largely an indus­ trial aristocracy. The current gendemen of Japan are very largely industrial gentlemen. Or their heirs.6 Despite the reliance of this small elite on the military and the state to maintain order, it would be a mistake to identify it with a back­ ward-looking nationalism. The ideal of the pre-war Japanese elite was a hybrid of Western and Japanese elements, but it was the Western aspects, especially in the most modern cities, which were loci of the public and visible accretions of elite status: Japanese gendemen work (if they do work) and live in cities which are a mixture of East and West, as are their habits. They work in the most Westernized settings in those cities, inside classical marbles and at mahogany desks, with Western panelling on the walls and often Western-style portraits. But the maid who brings in the green tea which refreshes business conferences usually wears a kimono, and when the gentleman gets through for the day, and goes out into his pilastered hall and down the Otis elevator and out the burnished revolving doors to his Lincoln or Cadillac at the curb, he moves into a hybrid city.7 6\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nThis extended to private life as well, with the homes of the Japanese elite including Western-style rooms and many preferring Western domestic customs. This was particularly true with drink, which in­ cluded French wines and Scottish whiskys as well as domestically produced beer and sake (rice wine).8 Indeed, elite status and an affluent lifestyle in Japan meant acquiring the best of Western cul­ ture and technology as much as the better things which Japan had to offer. This was increasingly imitated by local elites, particularly landlords and merchants.\n\nTA N A K A ’ S R U R A L BACK G RO U N D The Meiji Restoration which made possible the modernisation of Japan also had an impact on non-elites. Peasants were given title to their lands and restrictions were removed on the activities of petty manufacturers and merchants. Commoners were also permitted to adopt surnames and it is no coincidence that Tanaka’s surname is the most common surname in Japan; it literally means ‘middle of the field’, so was the choice of many peasant families and is in fact more common in Japan than the surname Smith in Anglo-Saxon countries. Peasants not only gained title to their land but could also lose it by falling into debt to wealthier neighbours or merchants. Crafts­ men and merchants accustomed to feudal guild protection soon lost out to their more entrepreneurial rivals. Peasants, craftsmen and others who failed in the new environment also ‘enjoyed’ the new freedom of movement to join the new factories and casual labour markets in the towns and cities. Poor peasant families sold their daughters to textile factories and even into brothels. The textile factories were strict and the wages meagre but it was possible for the young women working there to send money to their parents or save a small sum of money for marriage. W hile a few Japanese gentlemen lived the good life, most Japanese were farmers who eked out an existence on a small plot of land. The poorest areas of Japan were in the north of the main island of Honshu in its Tohoku (Northeast) region, but also in Tanaka’s home in Niigata prefecture located just below Tohoku, and these supplied much of the labour to an industrialising Japan. In part it was the climate of these regions that limited economic opportunities, 7\n\nTANAKA\n\nwhich had to be sought elsewhere. Niigata prefecture is located on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu where it is directly assaulted by the frozen Arctic winds sweeping in from Siberia. In winter, the snow piles up several metres high and peasants in the region frequently had to play the waiting game of determining at what point fear of the heavy snow crushing their roof justified their going out into the below-freezing weather to clear the roof.9 Tohoku and Niigata were primarily agricultural areas with poor tenants and a handful of wealthy landlords and rice merchants. The status of die peasant was low in the pre-war hierarchy, with poor tenants being forced off the road and into the mud when their land­ lord or his family passed.10 Respected above all were the civil servants in the community, who were officially the servants of the emperor, theoretically there to help the common people as a by-product of their duties to the state. Similar status accrued to others connected to the central government in the aristocracy, business and politics who might also be approached by the poorer members of society to seek aid in times of need. Tanaka came from a small farming family which placed him toward the bottom of the social ladder. The percentage of tenant farmers in Japan was high (about onethird) and most farmers rented some land. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasise tenancy. Most farmers did own a large proportion of the land they worked, and there was a large popula­ tion of petty landlords. Moreover, the agricultural proletariat, often the rural standard-bearer of the left in Western Europe, was small in Japan. It was primarily the commercialisation of the economy, most dramatically during and after World W ar I, that had the greatest impact on tenants in Japanese farm communities. Indeed, the Rice Riots of 1918, usually considered working-class protest, also involved farmers because they had become so depend­ ent on the market that even they were affected by rice price infla­ tion.\" In fact, commercialisation forced tenants onto the market and away from traditional relationships, and sometimes led to the formation of tenant unions. Given the poverty and despair of Niigata, it comes as no surprise that it is one area of pre-war Japan which had a strong tenants’ movement which emerged as a result of the Rice Riots of 1918, the year of Tanaka’s birth. Even so, it would be inaccurate to term Tanaka’s home village a typical village, especially in the context of Niigata. Futada village was unusual, for reasons historical and economic. It had been located at the entrance to the residence of a minor local lord, Hansaemon 8\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nUmetsu, and as a result had some of the characteristics of a small castle town which was at the heart of the Tokugawa period feudal domains.12 For example, it has more than a normal share of Bud­ dhist temples for a village of its size. Also, the village had few major landowners, with most farmers owning modest plots or renting land from landlords not much wealthier than themselves, and as a con­ sequence, the tenant union movement gained supporters much later in Futada compared to neighbouring areas of Niigata. In addition, the discovery of oil in the village during the 1920s led to most households benefiting financially from the oil wells placed in their fields. While life was not easy for the people of Futada village, it was better than that of their neighbours. This relative wealth did not seem to help Tanaka’s family, how­ ever. His mother worked long hours to keep the farm running while her husband, Tanaka’s father, engaged in various unsuccessful entre­ preneurial pursuits. Tanaka remembered that his mother was always up earlier than him and was always still at work when he went to sleep - an amazing feat considering that Tanaka himself needed few hours of sleep. Tanaka’s mother is prominent in Tanaka’s auto­ biography, especially the image of a hard-working woman whose advice to him is remembered lovingly if not always followed.13 Tanaka’s father, on the other hand, plays a minor role in Tanaka’s memoirs. He seems to have been an operator who dabbled in illfated ventures. He lost most of his money when an attempt to import Holstein cows into Japan ended in disaster, as did a fish farming scheme. He was left with three thoroughbred racehorses, and though he did win some races, he was often unlucky. Tanaka remembers one race in which his father staked a large amount of money, but the horse stumbled and damaged his leg. Not only had he lost all his money, but there were the entry fees and the costs of disposing of the horse which remained unpaid. After a telegram from his father asking for help, Tanaka was sent by his mother to a local merchant to borrow a fairly large sum of money to send to his father to extricate him from his predicament.\n\nP R E -W A R PO RK BARREL P O L IT IC S Tanaka’s family had not always been so poor and unsuccessful, however. His grandfather owned a construction firm which had 9\n\nTANAKA\n\nmanaged to gain a number of lucrative local public works contracts such as the building of local government offices and schools. It is inconceivable that these contracts were awarded without some sort of political connections, which implies not only business success but also a good head for politics. In pre-war Japanese politics, local notables made money and channelled benefits to their clients. Pre­ war politicians used government funds to provide direct benefits to their constituencies, competing to bring railroad lines, dams and other major projects to their districts, but compared to their post­ war counterparts who have engaged in similar practices, they took greater gambles on uncertain ventures which often ended in the bankruptcy of the politicians themselves, even if clients such as Tanaka’s grandfather did gain occasionally from connections widt such individuals. The main uncertainty of the pre-war period was deciding which political party to back. Once a political party captured control of the government, it could easily distribute enough patronage to manu­ facture an electoral majority. Local notables, including landlords and merchants - the new local elites of pre-war Japan - were able to control large blocks of votes which they would then mobilise in favour of one candidate or another depending on the prospects for the candidate’s party to gain control of the channels of official patronage. As a result, local notables ffequendy shifted parties, opportunistically supporting different parties in different elections. As Scalapino has pointed out, every election in pre-war Japan was won by the party in power at the time of the vote.14 Control of government meant control of government resources which could be used to attract the support of opportunistic notables and voters. Change in control of the government by parties, then, came about only when the non-elective elements of the state (the Meiji oligar­ chy15 and/or high-level bureaucrats) sought to play one party against the other by inviting one or other of them to form a caretaker government, or when the non-elective elements conducted the elec­ tion, often with the intention of aiding one party or the other. If a candidate guessed wrongly about the implications of national-level political intrigues and backed the wrong party, the consequences would be disastrous. As a result, pre-war Japanese politics was not a lucrative occupa­ tion. A common saying in pre-war Japan was that ‘a politician could lose even the wall around his well’, to indicate that even the most necessary assets could be lost by engaging in politics. In the case of 10\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nNiigata, there was one pre-war politician, Kanichi Otake, who operated in the same constituency in which Tanaka was to be active in the postwar period. Otake spent a large amount of his own resources to assist his supporters, supplying them with rice and loans in times of need to an extent that his own house deteriorated as a consequence. He is quoted as saying: ‘How can I be so petty as to worry about my house falling apart when the country is falling apart?’16 In contrast, most postwar politicians, like Tanaka, who were regularly elected in the same way as Otake, became wealthy. The two established conservative parties remained in power because they controlled government patronage and assisted their local constituents. The benefits of government largesse included the development of roads, railroads and public utilities, such as electric power and waterworks. Since pre-war Japan was poor, opportunit­ ies for gain from the judicious siting of a railroad station or road could produce significant advantages for influential constituents. For example, when a plan to create a bypass around the town of Nakanoshima was proposed, Otake successfully opposed the plan on behalf of local merchants who stood to lose if die bypass was created. Not only would the bypass take away business, but it would also become the main central government-maintained route, which would mean that local residents would be required to pay for the upkeep of the existing main street, including the onerous task of snow removal in the dead of winter. In the event, Otake managed to divert the road-building funds to finance the widening of the exist­ ing road and maintain its status as a national highway qualified to receive central government maintenance. It was not until the 1970s, when Tanaka was able to move the local Shinto shrine and straighten the road, that a bypass was created without any loss to the local residents.17 Certainly, the scale and comprehensiveness of largesse of a wealthier postwar Japan far outstripped that of the modest if significant schemes of the pre-war period. One other contrast with postwar politics was that the pre-war conservative parties made no systematic attempt to match socialist appeals to the workers, tenant farmers, or struggling small business owners who comprised a significant percentage of the electorate. To do so would have required them to confront the landlords and business interests who were heavily involved in their parties. In large part this was because landlords and business owners could depend on a repressive state to arrest ‘trouble makers’, though some moderate socialists were tolerated if they kept within the bounds of 11\n\nTANAKA\n\nexisting political practice. The barriers to organisation by the socialist left included direct state repression, and more subtle forms of obstruction on a private level as has been documented in one well-known case in Niigata prefecture itself.18 As a result, political appeals to tenants over the heads of landlords, and organisation of strikes and other direct action, brought the full force of the author­ ities down on socialist activists, especially on the left wing of the movement.\n\nSC H O O L , W O RK AND T H E M IL IT A R Y For most rural Japanese, therefore, the state existed in only the most rudimentary form: the police, schools and the military. Pre­ war education was compulsory only for the six years of elementary school. Tanaka showed himself to be an able student with a remark­ able memory and an enthusiasm for learning which made him stand out from his fellow pupils. His teacher recommended that he should go on to middle school. The number of students who could attend middle school was exceedingly small even if it was the only way to prepare for university, another preserve of the elite. However, such further education cost money. Tanaka imagined that the burden on his mother would be too much so he determined to proceed only to higher elementary school - three years of further education for those not going on to high school and university. His goal was to get a job as soon as possible.19 Tanaka also toyed with the idea of joining the military - one of the few avenues of advancement for able children of poor farm families in pre-war Japan. His interest was triggered in part by the Manchurian Incident in 1932. The Manchurian Incident had awakened a wave of patriotism in Japan after Japanese forces sta­ tioned in Manchuria, in northern China, effectively took control of the area and put in place a puppet government. While the League of Nations and the other major powers condemned Japan’s actions, most Japanese believed that they were not only protecting their own interests but also restoring order to a China which had been torn apart by competing armies of local warlords. The sense of isolation created by international criticism only reinforced Japanese national­ ism. In the end, however, Tanaka’s enthusiasm for the idea waned when his mother fell ill and he realised that military pay would not 12\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nbe enough to support her. He would get a job, help support her, and be available to assist her as she needed it.20 After graduating from higher elementary school in 1933, Tanaka first took a job moving soil and stones as part of a government programme of public works for disadvantaged areas, for which Niigata easily qualified. Men were paid 7 5 sen an hour and women 50 sen (100 sen = 1 yen). When Tanaka received his first pay packet, he was surprised to find that he had been paid only 50 sen, the same as a woman. He was so angry that he refused to go the next day. The foreman, who came to see Tanaka to find out what was wrong, suggested that Tanaka should become a foreman himself if he didn’t like the pay. The only opening for a foreman, however, was at another construction office in neighbouring Kashiwazaki City and Tanaka, who had only just left school, would have to compete with 20 other applicants. Nonetheless, Tanaka applied and was hired. His application stood out - he had been studying the middle school curriculum on his own at home in his spare time and was a keen calligrapher, both of which came through clearly in his application.21 His outstanding ability soon caught the attention of others. An elderly official at a neighbouring village council office had men­ tioned Tanaka to the owner of a major firm in charge of construc­ tion of factories in Niigata.22 The owner, Viscount Masatoshi Okochi, wanted Tanaka to join his firm in Tokyo where he would be able to work while attending architectural design school. With trepidation, Tanaka cautiously approached his mother with the idea of his going to Tokyo, but her enthusiasm for the idea removed all his doubts. He was seen off at the station by a group of friends, but he was upset that the local telephone exchange operator with whom he had been flirting for the past several months had not come to the station to see him off as she had promised. His disappointment was short­ lived; he was greeted by her one station down the line for a private farewell he never forgot. As he passed over the mountains from Niigata, the snow became less and less, and by the time the train reached Karuizawa - the playground of the elite - there was no snow on the ground at all. He would later own considerable property in the area, bought from the aristocratic Mito branch of the Tokugawa family. After several hours, he arrived at Ueno station in Tokyo and took a taxi to the accommodation which had been arranged for him. At the end of the journey, the taxi driver asked for 5 yen, all the money he had. He 13\n\nTANAKA\n\nknew something was wrong and protested but the driver was quite willing to go to the nearest police box to sort out the dispute. After paying, he later realised that the driver had driven him around in circles and overcharged him. The following morning, he travelled to work by bus but could not understand the driver who spoke too quickly so he had to jump off the bus when he realised he had nearly missed his stop. The receptionist also spoke too quickly and so politely he found it difficult to follow. The difference in the pace of life in Tokyo and Niigata depressed him. He trudged back to his accommodation through a snowstorm (rare in Tokyo) thinking that Tokyo was a difficult place in which to live.23 It was an experience which made him sympathetic to millions who similarly were forced to leave their rural villages and travel to the big cities to succeed. Tanaka’s approach to human relations also betrayed his rural ori­ gin. He was so awed by Viscount Okochi that out of respect he would not ride in the same crowded elevator as his boss. When one day Tanaka had entered the elevator and the viscount came in after him, he was so overwhelmed with emotion at this first-time encoun­ ter with his benefactor that nearly 30 years later it still brought tears to his eyes to think that he had finally met the man who gave him his big start.24 It is unclear why Tanaka was so impressed by his employer. After all, the aristocracy of pre-war Japan had been arti­ ficially created by recruiting remnants of the old Tokugawa hier­ archy, the newly elevated Imperial family and prominent members of the pre-war regime, in order to resemble the status distinctions of a European monarchy. It is more likely that Tanaka respected him not only for creating a successful construction firm, but also as a visionary who believed that the building of factories in villages throughout Japan could be a solution to economic deprivation. The viscount was a member of the elite who cared for the common people. Some of his ideas appeared later in Tanaka’s vision for Japan which helped to bring Tanaka to power and shaped Japan for years afterward.25 W hile Tanaka worked in the viscount’s company during the day and studied at architectural design school in the Kanda district of Tokyo in the evenings, the international and domestic political situation remained unstable. The League of Nations had created a commission to investigate claims that Japan had manufactured the Manchurian Incident as a pretext to seizing control of Manchukuo. However, even when the commission confirmed the worst fears of Japan’s critics, the League of Nations seemed powerless to act. 14\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nWithin Japan itself, the Manchurian Incident and the weak reac­ tion of the other Powers placed the military and extreme right-wing opposition in a position of increased influence in politics. The right wing had for many years declared itself in opposition to corrupt political parties and their relationship to the business elite which, it was argued, had weakened Japan internally and externally. Within the military, some factions plotted to overthrow the political parties. Attempted coups d ’etat as well as threats of coups were characteristic of the atmosphere of Tokyo in the period when Tanaka was studying and working as an apprentice. It was in the aftermath of one such attempted military coup in February 1936 that the Tosei (control) faction of the military was given carte blanche to suppress military uprisings. While the threat of domestic unrest receded with the rise of the Tosei faction, this faction was even more aggressive in its foreign policy and by 1937 Japan was at war with China. In 1938, Tanaka was called for a medical examination and found healthy. He was conscripted, and since he could ride well, he was put in the cavalry, to be precise, the Morioka Cavalry Third Brigade, 24th Regiment, First Company. At the time, Japan had troops sta­ tioned in its colonies of Formosa and Korea, but the bulk of its forces were fighting Nationalist and Communist forces in China. Tanaka was unlucky to be stationed on the Russian border where major skirmishes were occurring between the Japanese Imperial Army and Soviet troops, termed the Nomonhan Incident. Serious casual­ ties were taken on both sides and Japanese forces were badly bloodied in the battles by Soviet forces fighting to avoid a two-front war. As a result of the difficulties experienced in moving north against the Soviets, the Japanese army decided to concentrate on moving to the south toward the colonial areas of France in Indochina, the British Empire in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, and the oilrich Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). The Japanese government knew that this course of action would put Japan in direct conflict with the United States and devised the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 as a pre-emptive strike to discourage the US from interfering. The decision to move south after being bloodied on the Sino-Soviet border led directly to the beginning of World W ar II in the Pacific and the fall of the Japanese Empire. One year after the Nomonhan Incident ended, in November 1940, Tanaka suddenly fell seriously ill with tuberculosis and a danger­ ously high fever. He was so close to death that he was moved from Manchuria back to Japan. While he was in hospital, one of his 15\n\nTANAKA\n\nyounger sisters, Toshie, died of tuberculosis. Tanaka heard of her death as he fought for his own life, but his determination to live was great and he miraculously recovered even though the doctors had written him off as beyond hope. In October 1941, two months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was discharged from the hospital, excused from further military service and allowed to travel back to his home in Niigata.\n\nT H E PLA N OF T H IS BOOK How did a relatively uneducated, small construction company worker discharged from the military for serious illness become the most powerful and important politician in postwar Japan? There is no question that Tanaka had both ability and good fortune, but that would not have been enough to ensure his success in pre-war Japan. It was the destruction of the pre-war world by the war and its aftermath which made the rise of Tanaka possible. In addition, he had intelligence and affinity with the common people of Japan which allowed him to serve them and gain their loyalty. His skills were as effective as they were questionable, and his legacy is mixed, but as a symbol of and catalyst for the rise of a new Japan, he is without equal. Chapter 2 describes Tanaka’s rise as a result of the war and its aftermath, and reveals his early experiences with corruption and scandal which shaped his future behaviour. Tanaka was not alone in these experiences: they characterised the lives of virtually all of the most outstanding of the new men created in the 1940s. Chapter 3 shows how Tanaka’s passion for policy and a democratic desire to help all of his constituents led him to master the Japanese policy­ making process and rise to become the youngest ever cabinet mem­ ber. His experiences with the rough and tumble of factional infighting in the ruling party also provided valuable experiences. Chapter 4 describes Tanaka’s career as a prominent politician occupying the top posts in the ruling party and government. He uses his position to solve problems - in the economy and in politics - but his use of money and his ways of enriching himself and his allies begin to reach an unprecedented scale. In Chapter 5, we see how Tanaka establishes a government which is the culmination of his political manoeuvres and policy initiatives. He achieves more 16\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nthan any Japanese prime minister before or since and makes some of the most dramatic and lasting changes in Japan’s political economy. Chapter 6 reveals how Tanaka’s success also contained the seeds of his downfall. Economic problems and allegations of wrongdoing are exploited by his enemies to remove him from office. Once out of office, he continues to be a power behind the rise and fall of governments even after his arrest on bribery charges in the Lockheed scandal. It is not until his betrayal by his own faction members and his subsequent stroke in 1985 that he retires from politics. Finally, Chapter 7 shows how Tanaka’s legacy continues in the key politi­ cians he trained and the policy initiatives he began which continue to affect Japan at present. Tanaka made postwar Japan what it is today.\n\nN O T E S AND RE FE RE N CE S 1 Yoh Mizuki, Tanaka Kakuei: Sono Kyozen to Kyoaku [Kakuei Tanaka: His Greatness and Wickedness] (1998), pp. 331-2. 2 Yomiuri Shimbun, 27 Sept 1994. 3 Kakuei Tanaka, Watakushi no Rirekisho [My Curriculum Vitae] (1966), pp. 1-2. 4 A prefecture in Japan is similar to an English county or a US state in terms of its size in relation to the whole country, but historically there is much more subordination to the central government than in the case of a state in the US. 5 ‘Special Issue on Japan’, Fortune, Sept 1936, pp. 63-4. 6 Ibid. 7 Ibid., p. 60. 8 Ibid., p. 59. 9 Niigata Nippo Hodobu, Tanaka Kakuei: Rongu Guddobai [Kakuei Tanaka: Long Goodbye] (Niigata, 1995), p. 83. 10 Ann Waswo, Modem Japanese Society, 1868-1994 (Oxford, 1996), p. 66. 11 Michael Lewis, ‘The 1918 Japanese Rural Rice Riot: Taxation Populaire and the Tenant-Landlord Riots’, Working Papers in Asian/Pacific Studies: Rural Social Protest in Twentieth Century China and Japan, Asian/Pacific Studies Institute, Duke University (Durham, NC, 1986), pp. 30-55. 12 Tanaka, Watakushi no Rirekisho, p. 2. 13 Ibid., pp. 44-5. 14 Robert Scalapino, ‘Elections and Political Modernization in Pre-war Japan’, in Robert Ward (ed.), The Political Development o f Modern Japan (Princeton, NJ, 1968), p. 283. 17\n\nTANAKA\n\n15 The Meiji oligarch is the term used to describe elite samurai from out­ lying domains who led the overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate (16031868).

W ith all well at home, Tanaka returned almost im­ mediately to work, relying on his past connections with Viscount Okochi’s company, and set himself up as an independent architect after borrowing a room from Kipei Sakamoto, a building materials firm owner. Tanaka’s relationship with Sakamoto was important for a variety of reasons, but most immediately because he introduced Tanaka to his future wife. Sakamoto’s only daughter had been married previ­ ously and had a child from a previous marriage, but he was eager to have her marry again. Tanaka willingly obliged even though she was eight years older than him and he probably could have attracted a better match than a divorced mother. He put it down to fate and the fact that she was a quiet person who could put up with his unusual character. There may have been another motive as well which undermines the Tanaka myth of his success in setting up his own building de­ sign business at the age of 19 and rising to become president of a construction company by the age of 25. There is little evidence that Tanaka’s first business was a success and it was only the death of his father-in-law that put him in control of a construction firm which became the springboard for his future activities.1 His father-in-law’s business, Sakamoto Construction, was a relatively large supplier of construction materials. Business was suspended for a while after 19\n\nTANAKA\n\nSakamoto’s death, but Tanaka continued to pay rent on the office and made use of the building materials. At the time, building materials were in short supply. Japan had been on a war footing since the late 1930s, but 1940 saw the cre­ ation of total mobilisation for war and December 1941 marked the beginning of war with the West as a result of direct attacks on the US and the colonial assets of her European allies (the UK, France and the Netherlands). In 1941, all business required permission to operate and building materials were designated (along with most other raw materials) as controlled supplies. In 1942, the government forced smaller firms to merge with larger firms to make more effi­ cient use of existing resources. The business of which Tanaka was caretaker was not only large enough to remain independent but also benefited from the absorption of a smaller company. As a result, Tanaka changed the name of the company to Tanaka Construction; he was now the owner of a firm of over 100 employees. W ar contracts meant that business was booming for construction as well as for manufacturing industries, fuelled by government con­ tracts for war production which provided entrepreneurs such as Tanaka with opportunities for advancement and changed the nature of the Japanese economy. As the historian John Dower has pointed out: The labour force in manufacturing and construction increased from 5.8 million in 1930 to 8.1 million in 1940 and 9.5 million in 1944, and this was accompanied by a dramatic alteration in percentage of workers employed in light and heavy industry. In 1930, only 27 per cent of the industrial work force was in heavy industry, this rose to 47 per cent in 1937 and 68 per cent in 1942.2 Of course, Allied bombing raids began in earnest in 1945 and did much damage to Japan’s urban areas, but the damage was primarily to buildings and often left equipment or raw materials unscathed. Moreover, the experience gained by the workers created a massive pool of skilled labourers, many of whom would be employed in Japan’s postwar factories. It is no surprise that by the end of the war Tanaka’s firm had grown to employ 300-400 workers. The war also changed the lives of farmers who felt its impact in a variety of ways. There was a freeze on tenant agreements and rents, which was welcomed even if it was implemented to maintain food\n\n20\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\nproduction. Moreover, many farmers were able to do well during the war, not only in spite of, but because of, economic controls. With growing food shortages in the cities, urban middle-class fam­ ilies were forced to travel to the countryside to barter away their prized possessions in exchange for a small amount of rice and veget­ ables. At the same time, the government sponsored the creation of wartime agricultural associations, the nogyokai, and extended the agricultural co-operative system throughout Japan. While many were dominated by landlords and other influential members of the com­ munity, the proliferation of control associations gave rise to numer­ ous local officials who had not existed before the war. It has been argued that this ‘democratised’ rural communities in Japan during the war.3 This levelling phenomenon, which occurred in Europe as well as Japan, was a result of the demands of total war. In wartime Britain, for example, government economic controls contributed to a similar levelling process. After 1940, austerity and government regulations led to changing mores which produced growing uniformity, and as the social pyramid was flattened, social mobility increased.4 The difference in Japan was that the social pyramid completely collapsed as massive wartime destruction as well as dishonesty and starvation led to a flourishing black market at the end, and in the immediate aftermath, of the war. Tanaka’s first real fortune emerged front these circumstances. Toward the end of the war, most major firms were wary of taking on further government contracts out of fear of losing money as the air war on Japan intensified and the possibility of defeat loomed large. Thus, Tanaka probably gained a major government contract to build a munitions factory in Korea by default. However, just as he arrived in Korea with a large sum of money and precious build­ ing materials, the war ended. Tanaka claimed that he left the mater­ ial behind and was only able to return to Japan because the roster of the ship repatriating women and children allowed him to board because they had mistakenly recorded his name as Kikue, a woman’s name. It is widely believed, however, based on circumstantial evidence, that Tanaka sold the building materials and used part of the pro­ ceeds to bribe die captain of the ship to allow six co-workers and himself to return to Japan. The main evidence in support of such a theory is the large sum of money Tanaka suddenly seemed to have\n\n21\n\nTANAKA\n\nimmediately after the war and the fact that even after the mistake in the ship’s boarding roster was discovered, he was still given priority over women and children to return to Japan. The situation was hardly unique. Bribery on repatriation ships was widespread, and the wholesale plundering of military supplies fuelled a massive black market in Japan. When the Allied occupa­ tion ordered the Japanese military to demobilise immediately after assuming control of Japan, the government of the time led by Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki pretended that the order applied only to munitions, and allowed the wholesale pillaging of other army sup­ plies. A special directive on 20 August tried to prevent further shift­ ing of supplies into private hands, but the Higashi-Kuni cabinet, which succeeded Suzuki, delayed action for eight days. One auth­ oritative observer later described the consequences: ‘Meanwhile, of course, vast quantities of food, clothing and material were hauled away. Much of this fell into the hands of big business men, neigh­ bourhood bosses, speculators, and bosses backed by political parties which claimed a rake-off of the spoils. The full story is a sordid one of black-marketing, corruption, and fraud .. .’5 The entire situation was ripe for the emergence of a gangster culture, with which Tanaka was often later identified and in which he was particularly well positioned to operate. The core of Japanese gangster culture is the oyabun/kobun relationship. Construction was one area of activity which was conducive to the oyabun (father-like patron) system whereby a man would attach himself to a patron who would command the absolute loyalty of his follower in return for assistance. An oyabun could supply a building project, in a flexible manner, with tools, materials, skilled craftsmen and day labourers. In order to maintain a ready supply of men and resources, the oyabun acted as a protector, a father surrogate, providing food, shelter and other necessities in good times and bad. In return, labour, loyalty and obedience were provided by the kobun (child­ like client). The system, if not widespread, was frequently found in industries such as construction which relied on day labourers and short-term contracts. It was also found in the transport industry, particularly in shipping and ports. There are also well-documented cases of its presence in the coalfields of Kyushu and Hokkaido where oyabun arrangements were also used to supply labour to the mines, with miners hired by and working for individual oyabun foremen rather than directly for the mining company.6 22\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\nAfter the war, the collapse of the government and destruction of the cities saw the extension of areas requiring a strong presence to organise economic activity. It created an environment prone to gangsterism which would create order out of the chaos. Demobil­ ised soldiers and homeless men were willing and available to pledge loyalty in return for protection. Petty gamblers and street stall organisers suddenly found their skills for dealing with a world with­ out legal authority in great demand. Added to the mix were violent gangs of extortionists and blackmailers who set up independent operations to earn a living in a devastated economy. The roots of postwar Japanese organised crime and its gangsters (yakuza) can be found in this period, and the gangsters adopted the oyabun/kobun terminology as their own. Tanaka’s personal style of politics, drawn from his construction industry background, was legitimised in this period. It was an ap­ proach to politics which was drawn from many sources, including the mythology of the masterless samurai (ronin), but it was largely a postwar creation in terms of its scale and the degree to which it reached up into the highest level of political life. This approach was peculiar to Tanaka and a handful of others at the national level (with more prevalence at the local level), even if some have tried to make it the standard for successful leadership later in the postwar period. Tanaka’s autobiography is full of stories of debts and obligations which he never forgot. Of course, this is not so strange because most Japanese would be familiar with the conception of g iri and on, roughly translated as obligation and debt of gratitude, but few would take these ideas to the extremes that Tanaka did. This was clear in the way in which Tanaka gave out his money at the time. When Tanaka became an MP for the first time, in 1947, he started giving out money to his fellow MPs. One of these MPs, Kenzo Matsumura, recollects: I do not know why but Tanaka gave me money. I am sure it was about 30,000 yen. At the time this was a large amount of money. It was said that many people had received it. I had no reason to receive the money so I went to return it. Two well-known MPs did not return it but I did. That was decisive. Tanaka was a simple person. He distributed money and those who accepted it were his friends, but those who did not take were enemies. From then on it was always that way with him.7 23\n\nTANAKA\n\nT H E IM P A C T OF T H E A LLIE D O C C U P A T IO N OF JA PA N Given the role of the government in the war economy, the social and economic chaos in immediate postwar Japan obviously had seri­ ous political implications. The wartime regime had incorporated the main political parties, but politicians who had refused to par­ ticipate had been ostracised and the extreme left imprisoned. When the Allied occupation began, the first tasks to be undertaken were demilitarisation and democratisation. The military was abolished and political prisoners were released from prison. While it was an Allied occupation in name, it was dominated by the United States, and the effective ruler of Japan for most of the occupation period (1945-52) was US General Douglas MacArthur. At the same time, General MacArthur relied on the members of his staff to plan and execute reforms. In the early years of the occupa­ tion (1945-8), the liberals on MacArthur’s staff were in control and pursued radical reform of Japan. For example, the emperor was forced to renounce his divinity in January 1946. This was followed by an extensive purge of the Japanese elite. Between 1946 and 1947, approximately 180,000 per­ sons who had held key positions in Japanese society and gov­ ernment were purged by the occupation and forced to retire from public life. The purges not only removed many major politicians from power, but they also effectively eliminated the pre-war elite in most major firms and allowed a new group of junior managers to rise to the top. The break-up of the major zaibatsu conglomerates in 1947 and 1948 abolished the old elite families’ control of stock­ holding companies by confiscating their shares and selling them to the public. Occupation-sponsored land reform also destroyed the landlord’s dominance of the rural community. The percentage of tenant farmers fell from 26.7 per cent in August 1947 to 5.5 per cent by the end of 1948. New labour laws passed in 1946 and 1947 gave workers the right to form trade unions and bargain collectively as well as set­ ting labour standards for wages, hours, holidays, etc. The new Constitution, approved by a vote of the Japanese people in April 1947, provided for popular sovereignty with the emperor playing only a symbolic role, universal suffrage giving women the right to vote for the first time, and an elected bicameral legislature 24\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\nas the foundation of a parliamentary government. Political parties were to be central to postwar Japanese democracy. It is true that old party elements tried to rehabilitate themselves and the wartime elements sought new legitimacy, but the initiat­ ive was taken by the opponents of the wartime regime and new politicians who could give a new face to old parties. Moreover, the purges and other changes to the Japanese political landscape gave ambitious individuals such as Tanaka new opportunities to join the political elite. This can even be seen, for example, in the Progressive Party, which was a direct outgrowth of the wartime political associations that were at the centre of the corporatist Imperial Rule Assistance Association (Taisei Yokusankai) which dominated wartime politics. Initial candidates for the presidency of the Progressive Party, such as Fumimaro Konoe and Kazushige Ugaki, were tied to political positions closely associated with the wartime regime. These veteran politicians, however, were opposed by younger members of the Japanese legislature who sought a clean break with the pre-war past, and as a result, the position of party president was left vacant for a time.8 Ultimately, there was a fight for the presidency of the Pro­ gressive Party between Ugaki and Chuji Machida, former Minseito president. The presidency eventually fell to Machida, who was then 84 years old. It is alleged that the reason Machida defeated Ugaki was that the former outdid the latter in the collection of funds. After the war, those with the greatest amount of funds for polit­ ical purposes were those who had benefited from the chaos of the collapse of the wartime regime. As a former member of the Occupa­ tion forces noted at the time: ‘Black-marketeers provide a deep reservoir of campaign funds. Although no official campaign con­ tribution list includes their gifts, it is from them that all major parties have been financed.’9 Unsurprisingly, one of the sources for Machida’s funds was Tanaka.10 Tanaka’s own autobiography relates how he was put in contact with Machida who urgently needed cam­ paign funds to support his bid for the Progressive Party presidency. Tanaka gladly agreed. Tanaka had been introduced to Machida by Tadao Ohasa, a major MP who had been an ‘advisor’ to Tanaka’s company since 1943. It was obvious that Tanaka was savvy enough to maintain some connection to leading politicians. Ohasa even suggested that Tanaka might himself run as an MP. Tanaka’s main concern is telling of his attitude toward politics: ‘How much will it cost?’ he asked, to which 25\n\nTANAKA\n\nOhasa replied, ‘Spend 150,000 yen, keep quiet and ride the band­ wagon. You will certainly be elected.’11 Based on these encouraging words, Tanaka ran as a Progressive Party official candidate in Niigata’s third district. It made sense that Tanaka would be attracted to the Progressive Party. He had gained from his involvement with government dur­ ing the war, and represented a new breed of ‘common man’ com­ pared to the landlord and business elite politicians elected before the war. Although the Progressive Party included many veteran politicians such as Machida, the bulk of the party was composed of and funded by politicians similar to Tanaka. The Progressive Party dominated the Diet from the end of the war (August 1945), through the first modest Japanese-sponsored land reform, and up to the first postwar election held on 4 April 1946. However, this party was completely transformed by the Occupation purges of individuals who had been involved in the wartime regime. The purge of politicians on orders from the Allied occupation authorities directly focused on the 381 members of the wartime Japanese parliament who formed the core of the Progress­ ive Party. Out of the Progressive Party’s 274 founding members, only 14 were able to pass screening of applicants for candidacy in the first postwar election. New candidates such as Tanaka were desperately needed to give the party a new image. However, the Progressives suffered a crushing defeat in the April 1946 election. The party fell from an overwhelming majority in the parliament to just under 24 per cent of the seats after the general election and Tanaka failed to capture a seat. On the other hand, the Liberal Party, led primarily by conservative opponents of the war­ time regime, rose to nearly 32 per cent of the seats, with the newly emergent Socialist Party in third place at 20.6 per cent and the next largest category being unaffiliated politicians with 17.2 per cent of the seats. As the Liberal Party obtained the largest number of seats (though not a majority), they set out to form a government with the co-operation of the Progressive Party. The Liberals, however, were ill-equipped to face the economic chaos and social unrest of the immediate postwar period. The economy had collapsed, while at the same time the massive increase in the number of workers in heavy industry and in government services strengthened and emboldened the labour movement and the political left.12 The rise in tenant unrest, which had been sup­ pressed by wartime conditions, suddenly exploded into widespread 26\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\nsocial unrest in rural Japan. Yoshida and the Liberal Party toyed with land reform, but were unable to overcome the opposition of landlords who constituted the backbone of the party. The Liberal Party also tried to reduce labour unrest by enticing the moder­ ate right wing of the Socialist Party into their cabinet, but such attempts were unsuccessful. As the Progressive Party was reorganised into the Democratic Party, it moved away from supporting the Liberals and toward the Socialists. The Occupation, too, began to see the Liberal Party as an obstacle to the smooth implementation of Japanese government policy. Occupation authorities effectively promised the Socialists a general election as a quid pro quo for General MacArthur’s prohibi­ tion of the 1 February 1947 general strike, a strike aimed at top­ pling the Liberal Party cabinet. The promulgation of the postwar Japanese Constitution became the pretext on which the election was eventually called. The Democratic Party was officially inaugurated the same day the election was announced. Tanaka ran again for parliament with the Democrats. The Liberals were soundly defeated in the 1947 general election while the Socialists and the Democrats made massive gains with many MPs in both parties elected to parliament for the first time. Tanaka was one of the new Democratic Party MPs who substantially altered the character of parliamentary politics. However, since no party had an overall majority, negotiations towards a coalition government involved all of the major and minor parties, with the important exception of the Communist Party. The most conservative segments of the Democratic Party remained opposed to the coali­ tion, but were too weak to impose their will on the party as a whole. The Liberal Party joined the early negotiations in preparation for the coalition, but eventually refused to join the government. As a result, the Socialist leader Katayama became Prime Minister, and his party captured the lion’s share of the portfolios in the new cabinet but shared control of the government with the Democratic Party. Tanaka was now poised to be part of the new government and was given the relatively senior position of chairman of the Com­ merce Committee of the Lower House of parliament, unusual for a first-term MP, but not entirely strange given the dearth of experi­ enced MPs and his connections with the party leadership. The main policy concession made by the Democrats to the So­ cialists was support for Socialist plans for the nationalisation of coal and other essential industries which was inserted into the common 27\n\nTANAKA\n\ncoalition platform. Even though conservatives in the Democratic Party, Tanaka among them, were opposed to nationalisation, the mainstream of the party believed it was an acceptable price to pay for building the coalition excluding the left wing of the Socialists. Indeed, the left wing not only accepted their exclusion from the cabinet, but senior left-wing Socialist MPs even held a press con­ ference at which they formally renounced any ties with the Communist Party in order to placate conservative party fears. The nationalisation policy concession was the least the conservatives could do in return. In retrospect, the failures of the Socialist and Democratic Party coalition are most often emphasised, but there were also positive impacts which are too easily overlooked. In addition to strengthen­ ing labour union rights, the new government was more sympathetic to land reform - and indeed the bulk of land reform occurred while the Socialists were in government. Progress was also made on break­ ing up Japan’s pre-war industrial conglomerates and providing sub­ sidies to heavy industry. These were broadly popular policies which played a key role in shaping the social foundation of postwar Jap­ anese democracy, and were not at all objectionable to a populist politician such as Tanaka (at least in the long run). Nonetheless, the coalition was in trouble from the start due to labour movement unrest and growing dissatisfaction with continu­ ing requisitioning and other controls on the economy. The latter in particular reflected widespread resistance to Socialist attempts to create a bureaucratically led, controlled economy. The coal nation­ alisation dispute was the key issue around which this opposition coalesced - with Tanaka playing a prominent role - and it ended in severe damage to the coalition government from which it never recovered.\n\nCO AL N A T IO N A L ISA T IO N AND C O A LIT IO N FR A G IL IT Y State control of coal was to be the first in a series of postwar Social­ ist nationalisation plans for key industries. Other industries raised as candidates for nationalisation were steel, fertilisers and financial services - exactly the same industries that were at the core of the priority production system, the government’s policy of giving 28\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\npriority in the allocation of scarce economic resources to those industries that were essential to the economy as a whole. The first public announcement of Socialist nationalisation plans came in late 1946, though the concept was mentioned in the parly’s initial post­ war policy platforms. In fact, it was the main ideological pillar of declared Socialist economic policy. The coal nationalisation plan was the only identifiably socialist policy that emerged from the fourparty agreement which led to the formation of the cabinet. Even in the initial stages, however, resistance to the plan by the Liberal Party and some in the Democratic Party was clear. The Socialists had to prevail on this issue if only to indicate political control. The legislation was first debated by the Cabinet Economic Delib­ erations Council (Keizai Kakuryo Dondankai) on 28 June 1947. How­ ever, the Democratic Party members of the cabinet opposed the initial plan because it called for state ownership.1’ Instead, a Demo­ cratic Party plan was also drawn up, and both plans were debated in mid-August, and a compromise proposal was agreed. Even so, opposition continued from within the Democratic Party. Both economic controls and nationalisation were useful in rally­ ing small business to the Liberal Party in opposition to the gov­ ernment: indeed, small mine operators played a significant role in opposing the nationalisation of the industry. Moreover, money and organisational help in support of their cause came from larger firms. Shigeyoshi Kiso, the main figure working against the Socialist plan, helped organise small- and medium-sized firms in opposition to the programme with the support of big business.14 The small firms could take actions which larger firms could not because the larger firms would risk being accused of trying simply to maintain their control of the Japanese economy. Small mining interests were particularly notorious for their ‘extralegal tactics,’15 the most famous of which was the bribery of politicians. As Samuels delicately put it, ‘It was widely rumoured that cautious large mining interests used smaller firms to distribute funds to politicians.’16 These acts of blatant bribery constituted the first of several major postwar scandals. Numerous politicians were implicated, and court records of those tried for the crime provide insight into the ways in which big busi­ ness money was channelled to Democratic Party politicians, includ­ ing Tanaka.17 When the coal nationalisation bill finally came up for a vote in committee, it was actually defeated, with many Democratic Party members voting against the party position together with the 29\n\nTANAKA\n\nopposition Liberal and Communist Parties. Even so, the bill was brought immediately to a vote on the floor of the Lower House, and was passed. The opposition was upset that they had been out­ manoeuvred, but the final version of the legislation passed was hardly a victory for the Socialists either. State ‘control’ of the mines was to be only temporary (for three years) and the control itself was to be exercised by institutions dominated by mining interests, not by the central bureaucracy or democratically controlled boards. The law did contain some penalty provisions for coal mine owners who did not comply (though these were never enforced), but the main feature of the legislation was enhanced financing to increase coal production. The political effect of the legislation was far greater than the economic effect. As a result of the animosity created over the fight to pass the bill, 18 members of the Democratic Party either quit the party or were expelled. In addition, the grassroots opposition to nationalisation which had either supported the Democratic Party, or at least been neutral, moved over into the Liberal Party camp.18 Thus, the damage to the Democratic Party and to the coalition was extensive. This issue weakened the cabinet so that later shocks more easily brought it down. By early 1948, analysts began to suggest that the momentum was moving away from the centre parties to the Liberal and Communist Parties at the extremes. Tanaka played a particularly prominent role in Democratic Party opposition to the coal nationalisation legislation, in part because of his key position as chairman of the Commerce Committee of the Lower House of parliament. However, his involvement in the issue went much deeper - so much so, in fact, that he was one of a number of Democratic Party politicians indicted on charges of accepting bribes in exchange for mobilising their party against the bill. Tanaka’s involvement was a direct outgrowth of his attempt to expand his business on a national scale. At the time, the coal indus­ try was one of a few select industries targeted by the government for priority production with subsidies and preferential treatment to promote those industries that were central to postwar Japanese recovery. Tanaka believed that he could benefit from the expansion of the coal industry by political connections with coal operators in Japan’s southern island of Kyushu where many major coal opera­ tions were located.19 The problem was that the main players with whom Tanaka became involved were at the centre of the coal legisla­ tion bribery scandal. 30\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\nBy the time the scandal broke, Tanaka had quit the Democratic Party and joined the Liberal Party. As a result of his and other similar defections, the Liberal Party changed its name to the Demo­ cratic Liberal Party. The Democratic Liberals soon replaced the unstable Socialist-Democratic coalition government in October 1948 and began acting as a caretaker government until an election date could be set. Tanaka had joined the new government as a political vice-minister in the Justice Department - a very high-profile job which was presumably his reward for defecting from the Demo­ cratic Party earlier in the year. Once the scandal broke, Tanaka was forced to resign. The public prosecutor’s office requested his arrest but he could not be arrested due to his parliamentary immunity. It was only after his fellow MPs stripped him of his immunity that an arrest was made on 13 December 1948. Meanwhile the Democratic Liberal Party was eager to hold an early election to take advantage of the failures of the Socialist and Demo­ cratic Party coalition government which collapsed in the autumn of 1948 as a result of a separate bribery scandal involving another priority production industry - fertilisers - called the Showa Denko scandal. Therefore, Democratic Liberal moves for a snap election were made over the objection of the other parties, theoretically in the majority, and even the key elements in the US-dominated Allied occupation. A compromise was reached whereby the Socialist and Democratic coalition government budget was passed with Demo­ cratic Liberal Party support and the Democratic Liberals were per­ mitted to hold their election. The Democratic Liberal Party tried to distance itself from Tanaka by pointing out that he was a Democratic Party MP when the alleged incident was supposed to have occurred. Yet at the same time, Tanaka was allowed to run as a Democratic Liberal Party candidate in the January 1949 election when he was forced to fight for his seat from jail. It was a tough battle for Tanaka but he won re-election and joined in the landslide victory for the Democratic Liberal Party which savaged their Socialist and Democratic oppon­ ents, whose number of MPs fell by more than half. Ominously, the Communist Party seemed to have gained at the expense of the Socialists, but the Democratic Liberals had a solid majority and were set to govern the country for the next parliament which lasted until 1952. Tanaka was convicted of bribery in 1950, but he was found innocent on appeal in 1951 just in time for the next election. 31\n\nTANAKA\n\nThe main lesson that Tanaka learned front the entire incident is that he could get away with bribery. There is little doubt that he accepted a bribe, since the man who gave him the money openly admitted his involvement many years later.20 More significantly, a number of politicians associated with Tanaka who complained about being involved in his shady transactions are reported to have heard him brag that a man is not a man until he has been imprisoned once or twice. This logic was not unlike that of the yakuza dons whom Tanaka associated with and seemed to emulate over the years. Unsurprisingly, Tanaka was behind many of the major political cor­ ruption scandals of postwar Japan. Postwar corruption involving organised crime and extreme nation­ alists stands in sharp contrast to pre-war corruption in Japan. Pre­ war corruption involved the elite and was severely criticised by the military and nationalistic right. As we have seen, the wartime re­ gime and immediate postwar situation created corruption which was more democratic by providing wider opportunities for advancement, so the populist appeal of attacks on the corrupt, wealthy elite lost their salience. After the war, the military were gone and nationalist groups were deeply involved in the corrupt underground of Japan­ ese politics.21 Moreover, the war, postwar inflation, zaibatsu dissolu­ tion, land reform, and many of the other changes to Japan effectively levelled Japanese society and destroyed the pre-war order. Tanaka and his dubious associates were models, even heroes, of a new genera­ tion of Japanese who still struggled to make a place for themselves in the new Japan.\n\nT H E C R E A T IO N OF A ‘ N E W ’ E LIT E Tanaka’s political activities also signal one of the most significant changes in Japanese politics after the war: die transformation of party organisation at the local level. Unlike pre-war party notables such as landlords and local merchants, the Liberal Party began to build its party organisation on a new type of local notable, such as the local elected officials who would also often serve as the heads of a local administrative body, such as an agricultural co-operative. The war had already begun the process of creating a new class of bureaucratic and elected officials with the competence and authority 32\n\nWAR, BUSINESS AND CORRUPTION\n\nto supplant ‘traditional’ notables. Postwar reforms merely accentu­ ated the process.22 This was especially true of the land reform com­ mittees. Despite complaints about the officious and obstructionist attitudes of local functionaries, people were often grateful for the assistance of a particular individual in working through the complex process of land reform or other postwar institutional reforms.23 The success of the Liberals in attracting support from small busi­ ness has been emphasised, and this was true in both rural areas, such as among coal mine operators, and urban areas, among merchants. For example, in Tokyo,24 merchant support of the Liberal Party was reinforced by antagonism to Socialist government restrictions on commerce. This support for the Liberals extended to the merchants organised into retail co-operatives (shogyo kumiai). Moreover, many manufacturers, primarily suppliers for larger firms, who had often supported the Democratic Party or the Socialists, switched to the Liberal Party by 1949. New notables emerged who were often elected local officials in local government, farm co-operatives and even farmers and labour unions. These leaders in turn organised their membership more on the basis of shared interests than individual benefits. In this way, the conservatives too were forced to build a mass organisational strat­ egy, and one that in the end resulted in weakening the impersonal mass mobilisation strategies of the left through tire substitution of a more personal leadership focused mass strategy. This process constitutes the origin of the postwar Japanese electoral support organisation of the conservatives, the koenkai (see pp. 41-5 for details of these).25 This new elite included gangster-like bosses and dubious entre­ preneurs such as Tanaka, who crudely spread their money far and wide. To a degree, gift-giving customs and payments to smooth negotiations which were not uncommon in pre-war Japan became more widespread as more could afford to imitate the old elite. Tanaka’s approach to the use of money in politics was therefore not entirely unique in the context of immediate postwar Japan. He was part of a new self-made elite which, despite their dubious origins and political methods, constituted the foundation for postwar pol­ itics. As we shall see in the next chapters, economic growth in Japan reinforced and was reinforced by a style of money politics which did not originate with Tanaka, but which he came to represent by the scale on which he practised it and the way in which his behaviour compelled others to imitate him. 33\n\nTANAKA\n\nN O TE S AND R E FE RE N CE S 1 Takashi Tachibana, Tanaka Kakuei Kenkyu Zenkiryokn [A Study of Kakuei Tanaka: The Full Record], vol. 1 (1982), p. 64. 2 John Dower, Japan in War and Peace (London, 1993), pp. 13-14. 3 Masumi Junnosuke, Nihon Seito Shi Ron [On the History of Japanese Political Parties], vol. 7 (1984). 4 Gordon Wright, The Ordeal o f Total War, 1939-1945 (New York, 1968), p. 246. 5 Harry Emerson Wildes, ‘Postwar Politics in Japan II: IV.

It was his opposition to coal nationalisation which led Tanaka to quit the Democratic Party and join the Liberal Party in early 1948. The coalition was also having trouble coping with hyperinflation and a sluggish economic recovery blamed by many on its interventionist policies. The need for postwar austerity measures, especially a mas­ sive reduction in the number of government employees and sub­ sidies to industry, was increasingly apparent by 1948. As a result of this experience, Tanaka would never adopt an approach to policy­ making that was based on nationalisation of industry or direct gov­ ernmental control of economic life. Instead, the type of legislation that Tanaka proposed as a junior MP focused on building the infrastructure which was to prove essential to Japan’s postwar economic miracle. In identifying the need for such spending, Tanaka cultivated relationships with bureaucrats who were certainly interventionist and in some cases clearly social­ ist in their orientation. Moreover, Tanaka’s ability to achieve reelection with increasing levels of voter support in his district was the result of his wooing of rural voters, including former socialist vot­ ers, with concrete benefits drawn from his government connections. This approach has been called Tanaka-style socialism, but it is better viewed as a form of right-wing populism. The same type of populist approach was adopted by the Prime Minister of Japan at the end of the 1950s, Nobusuke Kishi, who gave Tanaka his first cabinet post in 1957. In short, the 1950s was the period in which the foundations of Japanese economic success were created through a combination of public works, patronage and populism. 36\n\nTANAKA-STYLE POPULISM\n\nJO IN IN G T H E YO SH ID A SC H O O L At the beginning of the 1950s, Tanaka was savvy enough to make the shift early to the opposite end of the conservative political spec­ trum from the conservatives who dominated the wartime regime and the Democratic Party. He not only transferred his allegiance to the opposition Liberal Party but became an important supporter of Shigeru Yoshida, the Prime Minister who dominated Japan’s first postwar decade. Siding with Yoshida was not an obvious choice given Tanaka’s background. Yoshida was a former Loreign Ministry official and a member of Japan’s pre-war elite. He was also critical and suspicious of the very same groups and individuals with whom Tanaka had been associated during and immediately after the war. Yoshida’s conversion to market liberalism and a distaste for the militaristic right were not completely shared by Tanaka. Worse, Yoshida was out of power and even though the Socialist-Democratic Party coali­ tion seemed likely to collapse, key members of the US Occupation authorities were so opposed to Yoshida that there was no guarantee that he would continue to be a powerful ally who might help Tanaka. The route taken by Tanaka in aligning himself with Yoshida, who dominated Japanese politics for most of the first postwar decade, is difficult to determine precisely. He and 17 other MPs quit the Democratic Party three days after the passage of the Coal Control Act and formed the Democratic Club. In March 1948, immediately after the formation of Hitoshi Ashida’s cabinet - another coalition government involving the Democratic Party and the Socialists - the Democratic Club and the Daiichi Giin Club, a parliamentary group composed of unaffiliated politicians, joined with the Liberal Party to form the Democratic Liberal Party.1 This move by Tanaka and others was significant as the first sign of the revival in the Liberals’ fortunes but there is no evidence that Tanaka was prominent at this point. This strengthening of Yoshida’s party was followed by the forma­ tion of the so-called ‘Yoshida school’: on 21 July 1948, Yoshida brought together a number of top-level bureaucrats and invited them to join the Liberals, and on the following day, he announced to the press that 28 such officials were joining his party to run for national office in the next general election.: Most were officials at the level of administrative vice-minister or section chief class and 37\n\nTANAKA\n\ntheir defection was a major blow to the coalition government. Tanaka was able to become a ‘pupil’ in the Yoshida school and was one of only a few politicians among a group predominantly bureaucratic in origin. Tanaka became particularly close to one of the key members of the Yoshida school, the former Transport Ministry bureaucrat Eisaku Sato, and he was the probable source of Tanaka’s access to Yoshida’s inner circle. As a result of defections and serious divisions between and within the parties of the coalition, the Ashida govern­ ment collapsed at the end of the summer of 1948, and the Liberal Party under Yoshida was given responsibility for forming a care­ taker government in October 1948. There was one problem, how­ ever: the Government Section of the General Headquarters of Supreme Commander of the Allies in the Pacific (SCAP), the key agency of the US-led Occupation, was actively involved in trying to block Yoshida’s return to power. In the latter half of September 1948, Liberal Party representative Yukuichiro Yamaguchi was sum­ moned by Justin Williams, the Government Section bureau chief responsible for parliamentary matters, who suggested that it was necessary to ‘deal with’ Yoshida if the Liberal Party wanted to form a cabinet.3Yamaguchi joined with Jiro Hoshijima to work to replace Yoshida with Liberal Party director Takeshi Yamazaki. At one point, the scheme appeared to have broad support extending all the way to the Socialists.
