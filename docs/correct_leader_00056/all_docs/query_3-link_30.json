        "text": "154. Memorandum From John H. Holdridge of the National Security Council Staff to the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger)1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nSouth Korean Concern About Japan’s Contacts with Pyongyang, and Desire to Have the Issue Raised at the Honolulu Summit\n\nIn a recent conversation with Ambassador Habib to brief him on the progress of the North-South talks, ROK CIA Director Yi Hu-rak also expressed the view that “Japan is moving too quickly in expanding its relations with North Korea and is proceeding at a tempo disadvantageous to preservation of stability in the area.”2\n\nYi then requested that President Nixon raise the ROK concern with Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka at the Honolulu summit. Presumably the ROKs would like us to add our weight to the view that Japan should move cautiously in its contacts with Pyongyang, perhaps coordinating its actions with the ROK, or at least keeping them fully informed of their anticipated moves.\n\nWe are not sure whether Yi is exaggerating for effect, or whether he has a different understanding of the pace at which Japan plans to expand its relations with North Korea. The Tanaka Government has made quite clear in the past month that it intends to proceed fairly slowly and cautiously in developing relations with Pyongyang. While, for example, it plans to expand cultural, academic, sports, and technical exchanges with the DPRK, it will not allow political exchanges. And even as regards technical exchanges, it will not admit North Korean technicians in connection with projects that might involve Japanese Exim Bank financing. The prospects for any rapid expansion of trade [Page 401] are small, constrained by the North Korean inability to finance it at this point. Equally important, the Tanaka Government has made clear it does not intend any substantial departures in its bilateral relations with Seoul."
