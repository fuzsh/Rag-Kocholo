        "text": "In this story:\n\nStagnant economy\n\nClose scrutiny\n\nRELATED STORIES, SITES\n\nTOKYO, Japan -- Japan's new Prime Minister Junishiro Koizumi has announced his cabinet, keeping a highly regarded finance regulator at his post and selecting a political iconoclast as foreign minister.\n\nAmong the biggest surprises of the new cabinet is the selection of 79-year-old transport and education minister Masajuro Shiokawa as finance minister, taking over from Kiichi Miyazawa.\n\nThe 17-member cabinet includes five women, none more high profile than the popular and outspoken Makiko Tanaka, who takes the foreign ministry post.\n\nTanaka, the daughter of a former premier and Liberal Democratic Party kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka, has been repeatedly singled out in polls as Japan's most popular politician.\n\nHer presence will add popularity to Koizumi's new cabinet -- she is a harsh critic of the long-ruling party's rigid conventions and ranks high in surveys of who voters would like to see as prime minister.\n\nBut Tanaka remains unproven at a top level, having headed only the Science and Technology Agency.\n\nAlso in the line-up is Trade Minister Takeo Hiranuma, who is retained from the previous ministry; Financial Services Agency chief Hakuo Yanagisawa, who is also retained; while Heizo Takenaka, an economics professor at Tokyo's Keio University known for his advocacy of painful economic reforms, is in charge of economic and fiscal policy.\n\nYanagisawa's retention will allow him to press ahead with a cleanup of the bad loans that have weighed on banks and stifled growth for more than a decade.\n\nChief cabinet secretary Yasuo Fukuda, also a holdover from the previous cabinet, announced the new line-up.\n\nStagnant economy\n\nKoizumi replaces the hugely unpopular Yoshiro Mori -- whose tenure was punctured by a series of gaffes -- and now faces the task of revitalizing Japan's stagnating economy.\n\nIn his campaign for the leadership Koizumi has vowed to bring a new style to Japanese politics, promising to select cabinet members solely on merit, not as the result of backroom factional dealings.\n\nBacked by a three-way ruling coalition, Koizumi won a majority of votes in parliament's Lower House. The vote was 287 in favor of Koizumi out of a possible 478.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the cabinet of the outgoing Prime Minister Mori resigned en masse, as tradition demands, to make way for Koizumi.\n\n\"The Mori cabinet resigned today at the last cabinet meeting ahead of the formation of a new cabinet,\" said Kazuhiro Koshikawa, deputy press secretary for Mori who leaves office as one of the most unpopular prime ministers of his time.\n\nElected as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Tuesday, Koizumi, 59, has vowed to ignore the factional power plays that have so long dominated Japan's political landscape.\n\nOctogenarian Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference he had not been asked to be in the new cabinet, but newspapers said it was still uncertain who would replace him.\n\nSome media earlier floated former LDP executive Koichi Kato, a reformist Koizumi ally who last year led a failed rebellion against Mori, for the key finance post.\n\nKoizumi rode to power on wave of popularity within the LDP rank-and-file members, and in doing so beat the early leadership favorite and LDP powerbroker, former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.\n\nHis \"Change the LDP, Change Japan\" platform won resounding support from local party members deeply afraid of losing the July election for parliament's Upper House.\n\nHowever, he has been deliberately vague as to how his reformist rhetoric will translate into policies.\n\nKoizumi has said he would only reveal the specifics of his policies once he had appointed his cabinet.\n\nClose scrutiny\n\nAttention is now focused on whether Koizumi, once dubbed an eccentric but now seen as a potentially bold reformer, can keep his campaign promise to break the bonds of factional fiefdoms in selecting his new cabinet.\n\n\"I want to appoint those who are zealous about reform,\" Koizumi told reporters.\n\nKoizumi shot to the top party post after the ruling bloc decided to ditch the hugely unpopular Mori in the lead-up to the crucial Upper House election. Japan will hold its Lower House elections at the end of the year.\n\nMedia and analysts have said Koizumi's victory in the LDP race on Tuesday over Hashimoto, the establishment favorite, signaled a seismic shift inside a party long seen by voters as tainted by corruption, bound by special interests and dominated by factional feuding.\n\nBut his choices for a trio of top positions in the LDP on Wednesday indicated that -- as anticipated -- Koizumi was engaged in a delicate balancing act between party harmony and reform.\n\nKoizumi chose reformist ally Taku Yamasaki, head of a small faction, as secretary general of the LDP, a move analysts welcomed as a sign times were changing.\n\nBut a question mark hangs over his choice of outgoing Economics Minister Taro Aso for the post of LDP policy chief.\n\nAso's stress on keeping the economy from slipping into negative territory contrasts with the higher priority Koizumi has placed on structural reform.\n\nSkeptics worry Koizumi will backpedal on fiscal and economic reform to maintain support from those in the LDP who advocate more public spending to keep Japan's fragile economy afloat.\n\nKoizumi campaigned on a proposal to cap Japanese government bond issuance at 30 trillion yen ($245.6 billion) as a way to start getting a grip on the huge public debt.\n\nOn Wednesday, though, Aso said that proposal was simply \"one option.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nJapan hopes new leader can deliver\n\nJapan's PM race goes down to the wire\n\nMaverick Koizumi leading race for Japan PM\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nLiberal Democratic Party of Japan\n\nJapanese Prime Minister\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
