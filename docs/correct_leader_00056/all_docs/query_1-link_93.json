        "text": "TOKYO -- From the latter half of the 1950s, Japan's economy continued to grow rapidly. However, fixed exchange rates that pegged the yen at 360 to the dollar -- which saw exporters benefiting from a weak yen -- ended in 1971. In 1973, the Yom Kippur War broke out, followed by an oil crisis which made the outlook bleak all at once. Japanologist Donald Keene contributed a long piece to The New York Times Magazine, dated March 3, 1974, regarding the state of Japanese society at the time.\n\n----------\n\nMany Japanese have lately been recalling the old chronicles that told of men and countries whose glory \"faded in the space of a dream.\" The recent period of Japanese glory, from 1969 to 1973, when it seemed that a small, distant country would overtake the giants of the West, lasted somewhat longer than a dream, but it has ended with dramatic suddenness. The same people who only a few months ago, were talking and acting as if the future held unlimited possibilities of economic expansion now gloomily announce, not without a touch of masochism, that they live in a country completely at the mercy of others for survival.\n\nThe immediate cause of this change in attitude is, of course, the oil crisis.\n\n[LETTER FROM TOKYO: The short, happy life of Japan as superpower]\n\n----------\n\nWhile Keene's tone sounds like that of an economic journalist, his continuous observations of life in Japan and the people's way of thinking remain unchanged. He says that the people of Japan readily reversed their outlook of the country's future to a gloomy one, in almost a self-deprecatory manner. In the same piece, Keene depicted how public opinion toward then Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka changed as well.\n\n----------\n\nBut for most people the oil crisis has little ideological significance. The effects are felt in the extraordinary inflation and the mysterious shortages, some genuine, others the results of unfounded rumors. It is not always clear why certain items have become scarce. Prepared mayonnaise, for example, is rationed at one tube to a customer in many supermarkets, not because the mayonnaise itself is in short supply but because the tubes are of a plastic material made from petroleum.\n\nPanic buying of such items as sugar, detergents and toilet paper has led the Government to dump tons on the market to lower the prices, but it takes only a glance at the skimpy issues of newspapers and magazines to realize that a paper shortage, at least, must be genuine. One hears reports of manufacturers being unable to turn out cars, television sets or electric toasters because some small, indispensable part is unavailable. When production lines are temporarily paralyzed, however, Japanese companies, unlike those in America, do not lay off workers; instead they organize study sessions and the like to occupy the workers while they wait for the missing parts.\n\nWherever one goes one hears complaints about the Tanaka Government, which is blamed for the inflation and shortages. When Kakuei Tanaka became Prime Minister in July, 1972, he enjoyed a wave of popularity thanks mainly to his success in restoring diplomatic relations with China. He was popular also because he is not a member of the elite that had passed through the Red Gate of Tokyo University but is largely self-educated; his formal schooling ended with elementary school. Even his profuse perspiring, which requires him to mop his brow every few minutes, confirmed the image of a man risen from the common people; now that he has lost his popularity, some interpret it as a sign of failing health, the stigma of his unsuccessful policies.\n\nIt is not hard to imagine a Tokyo housewife's indignation when she discovers that the prices of milk and of instant noodles (a popular lunchtime dish) have shot up 50 per cent over a weekend, and that some vegetables have doubled in price, but for a young couple looking for a place to live, the price of food is a secondary worry. A conveniently situated apartment in Tokyo, no matter how small, is extremely expensive to rent and well beyond the means of the average man to buy. One American-sized room, cut up into three or four tiny Japanese rooms, can easily cost $50,000 even in an unfashionable neighborhood. So most couples live in housing developments optimistically described as being 59 minutes by train from the center of the city.\n\n[LETTER FROM TOKYO: The short, happy life of Japan as superpower]\n\n----------\n\nKeene's go-to lunch around this time was instant ramen noodles. Japan's invention of instant noodles helped him secure time for his research, as he lived on his own. Incidentally, when I visited Keene during his final years, lunch was always Kansai-style udon noodles.\n\nAccording to an essay, Keene purchased an apartment room near the University of Tokyo, in the Nishikata area of Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward, in December 1971, amid a surge in real estate prices. According to Keene's adopted son Seiki, \"I don't think he had deep pockets, but he must have been able to afford it since the dollar was strong.\"\n\nHowever, the apartment faced a main thoroughfare, and the noise was terrible. He found another apartment besides the Kyu-Furukawa Gardens, in the Nishigahara area of Tokyo's Kita Ward, about 3 kilometers north, and moved there in November 1974, after waiting for a vacancy. This neighborhood retains the old \"shitamachi\" downtown atmosphere, even now. Keene once explained to me that he had no acquaintances living nearby, nor were there fancy restaurants there. \"My friends all opposed my choice, saying 'it's inconvenient,' but I wanted to live in a town without any foreigners.\"\n\nFrom the window of his 2LDK apartment on the seventh floor, one can overlook the gardens, and their colors changing by the season. Keene also wrote in an essay that the trees seen from his window were a precious treasure for someone who worked in his room all day long.\n\nThe apartment became his living base for 45 years, and his final home. Seiki now occupies the home, and the eighth-floor study, which was purchased later, is being used as the office of the Donald Keene Memorial Foundation.\n\n* * *\n\nThis series navigates the past century by following the life of the late scholar Donald Keene, who contributed to the elevation of Japanese culture and literature in the world. News from The Mainichi that made headlines in Keene's time is introduced alongside Keene's personal history. The series began in 2022, the 100th anniversary of Keene's birth -- also the centennial of The Mainichi.\n\n(This is Part 46 of a series. The next \"Donald Keene's Japan\" story will be published on Dec. 19.)\n\n(Japanese original by Tadahiko Mori, The Mainichi Staff Writer and Donald Keene Memorial Foundation director)\n\nThe original text of Donald Keene's autobiographies is used with permission from the Donald Keene Memorial Foundation. The foundation's website can be reached at: https://www.donaldkeene.org/\n\n* * *\n\nProfile:\n\nDonald Keene was born on June 18, 1922, in Brooklyn, New York. He was a Japanese literature scholar and professor emeritus at Columbia University. After earning postgraduate degrees at Columbia University and Cambridge University, he received a fellowship to study at Kyoto University in 1953. Keene developed friendships with prominent Japanese authors, including Junichiro Tanizaki, Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima. Over the course of half a century, Keene traveled back and forth between the U.S. and Japan, and continued to study Japanese literature and culture, while conveying their charms to the world in English. His main works include a multivolume history of Japanese literature, \"Travelers of a Hundred Ages,\" and \"Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912.\" In 2008, Keene received the Order of Culture from the Japanese government. The scholar obtained Japanese citizenship in the year following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami. He died on Feb. 24, 2019, at age 96."
