        "text": "29. Memorandum From the President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs (Bundy) to President Johnson1\n\nDoug Dillon asked me a couple of weeks ago to report on his conversations at the finance meetings in Tokyo.2 The following are the leading items distilled from these conversations:\n\n1. The Japanese Minister of Finance, Tanaka, presented the Japanese case for exemption from the interest equalization tax in such a way as to indicate that the problem is more political than economic. As a result, Dillon concludes that the political need can be met in other ways, perhaps by settling the air route discussions which have been put over until after the election. I myself think Dillon’s glasses may be somewhat rose tinted because of his great interest in avoiding any further concessions on interest equalization.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a matter on which we can stand firmly if we wish to.\n\n[Omitted here is a brief report on Franco-American relations.]"
