        "text": "(1918–93). Japanese public official Tanaka Kakuei was prime minister of Japan from 1972 to 1974. He became the main figure in a major political scandal.\n\nTanaka was born on May 4, 1918, in Kariwa, Niigata prefecture, Japan. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 and soon opened his own construction firm, the Tanaka Civil Engineering Company. His business prospered during World War II—largely because of military contracts—and Tanaka became one of the richest men in Japan. Entering politics, he was elected to a seat in the lower house of the Japanese Diet (parliament) in 1947 and rose through the ranks of the powerful Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) to become minister of postal services and communications in 1957. Resigning from that post in 1958, he then served as minister of finance from 1962 to 1964. He became one of the LDP’s most powerful politicians and was made secretary-general of the party in 1965 and again in 1968.\n\nTanaka served as minister of international trade and industry in the cabinet of Sato Eisaku, who was prime minister from 1964 to 1972. Tanaka then succeeded Sato in a surprising upset victory over Sato’s chosen successor, the former foreign minister Fukuda Takeo. Tanaka was a popular prime minister; he pushed through many government projects and was responsible for economically revitalizing much of western Japan. He also established diplomatic relations with China. Japan’s economic growth slowed and inflation rose during his time in office, however, and in the elections of July 1974 his party made a poor showing. These problems, added to charges that he had used his office to profit illegally, led to his resignation in December 1974.\n\nIn August 1976 Tanaka was charged with having accepted, while prime minister, millions of dollars in bribes from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in order to influence All Nippon Airways to buy Lockheed’s jet airliners. Despite the indictment, he continued to rule over the largest faction of the LDP; he thus had a major voice in the selection of three subsequent Japanese prime ministers. After a seven-year trial, Tanaka was convicted in 1983 of bribery and another charge and was fined and sentenced to four years in prison. He suffered a stroke in 1985, while his conviction was on appeal, and thereafter his power and influence waned. Tanaka died on December 16, 1993, in Tokyo, Japan."
