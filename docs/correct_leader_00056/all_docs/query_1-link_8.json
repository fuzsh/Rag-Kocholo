        "text": "A symbol of shady ties between money and political power went up in flames on Jan. 8.\n\nTokyo firefighters around 3:20 p.m. responded to a call about smoke billowing from what used to be the residence of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.\n\nThe two-story home with a total floor space of about 800 square meters was destroyed, and an adjoining forest also caught fire, Tokyo Fire Department officials said.\n\nTanaka’s daughter, Makiko, a former foreign minister, and her husband, Naoki, a former defense minister, were at the home when the fire broke out, but both were safe.\n\nMakiko told The Asahi Shimbun that the fire was caused by burning incense that she had forgotten to extinguish at the home Buddhist altar.\n\nThe fire occurred about 1.3 kilometers east of JR Mejiro Station.\n\n“I looked toward the old Tanaka residence when I smelled something burning,” said a 55-year-old man who was at a nearby park. “Flames reached a height of several meters, and the smoke was incredible.”\n\nThe entire complex was once called “Mejiro Goten,” or the “Mejiro palace.”\n\nKakuei Tanaka moved to the Mejiro district around 1953 after becoming a Lower House member. He bought up the surrounding property in the 1960s after serving in Cabinet posts. The site eventually expanded to about 8,000 square meters.\n\nBefore Tanaka became prime minister in 1972, people seeking policy decisions in their favor lobbied him at the residence, which had an office that could accommodate around 100 people.\n\nTanaka was arrested in 1978 in the Lockheed bribery scandal.\n\nAfter his death in 1993, bereaved family members paid inheritance tax partly in kind, including about 3,000 square meters of the Mejiro site. The total inheritance tax amount was about 6.5 billion yen ($45.2 million).\n\nThe Mejiro property was later acquired by Bunkyo Ward and Japan Women’s University. A park and educational facility are now located on that part of the former Tanaka estate.\n\n(This article was written by Eishi Kado and Chika Yamamoto.)"
