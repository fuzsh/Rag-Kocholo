The two-story, 800-square-meter wooden building was completely destroyed by the fire.\n\nAccording to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Kakuei’s eldest daughter, Makiko, 79, a former foreign minister, and others were inside the residence when the fire broke out, but everyone evacuated without injury. Makiko said that she had been offering incense at a Buddhist altar. Police are investigating the cause of the fire.\n\nThe residence, known as “Mejiro Goten,” was a stage for Showa-era politics and was frequented by politicians and petitioners."
