        "text": "Vol. ? New York City, Saturday, Nov. 27, 1852. No. 585.\n\nUTAH.\n\n______\n\nThe Mormons -- Population -- Religious, &c.\n\nCorrespondence of the St. Louis Intelligencer.\n\nGREAT SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 12, 1852.\n\nWith a slash of the whip across the shoulders, and a dash of the rowels into the flanks of their respective animals, a company of young Mormon belles and beaux on horseback -- the belles arrayed in long skirted riding dresses and green velvet caps, and the beaux in their shirt sleeves and bare necks, with slouched woolen hats upon their heads, and slips of coarse leather wrapped around the lower extremities of their legs, from the knees down, in the fashion of leggings, rush at full gallop past my window. I step to the door to observe more closely the unusual sight, and while watching with curious eye the receding figures, am reminded of my promise to sketch you a few of the peculiarities of Mormon life, manners, character and institutions, such as they have presented themselves to my mind during a residence of several weeks in the Valley. The task I have imposed upon myself is a somewhat difficult one. When there is much ignorance and fanaticism upon the one side, and so much prejudice and contempt upon the other, it is impossible that I should in what I have to say, entirely please either Mormon or Gentile -- for such the Saints term all who disagree with them in point of religious faith. Gentiles will, I dare say, attribute to me too lenient an indulgence to the abominable doctrines and hateful persons of sacrilegious idolaters, while Mormons will accuse me of a severity merging into persecution of God's faithful and chosen saints. It is even doubtful whether I shall myself feel altogether satisfied as to the truth and fidelity of my own impressions. But as truth and justice, and the presentation of correct and faithful impressions in regard to subjects which are beginning to excite a very general interest throughout the country are my only objects, I shall write simply as I think, careless alike who approves or who condemns.\n\nThe population of this city I should suppose to be between eight and ten thousand. That of the Valley at large I have no very reliable means of estimating. Upon a rude computation, based upon the best sources of in-formation which are accessible to me, I should estimate it as ranging somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand. This population is of an altogether hybrid or heterogeneous character, being composed of emigrants from every section of the Union, and almost every country in Europe. Here are congregated the keen, sharp-witted, restless Yankee, the prudent, canny, slim-visaged Scotchman, the pursy, self-complacent, consequential Englishman, the dull, phlegmatic German, with a rare occasional specimen of a more gay, light-hearted Irishman or Frenchman, all of whom associate together in this desert-girt retreat upon terms of the most social harmony and brotherhood. I have often been amused at one of their saintly peculiarities, their manner of addressing or speaking of one another. A saint invariably salutes or speaks of a fellow-saint with the endearing appellation of Brother or Sister. This peculiarity is not confined to the elder members of the community, but extends to all ages and both sexes. I have sometimes been moved to fits of almost uncontrollable laughter with a keen sense of the ludicrous, at hearing a saintly infant of eight or twelve address his playmate, or speak of some elderly personage by the fraternal title of Brother Zebulon or Brother Hyde, or some other kindred name. There is, however, one exception to this peculiar feature of Mormon custom. The term Brother is rarely if ever applied to the head of the Church and Governor of the Territory, Brigham Young. In speaking of this high and influential personage, the less exalted saints sometimes, when they wish to be particularly deferential, term him President Young, in virtue of his office as President of the Church. But most commonly they in familiar parlance style him simply Brigham. He is seldom alluded to as Governor, the saints seeming to hold in high contempt any reflected honor which political title or station could give to the great High Priest of their faith and immediate representative of God upon earth.\n\nEnglish people, both men and women, form a very large proportion, I think fully one-third, perhaps one-half, of the community. With strict fidelity to their English origin and character, they generally constitute the most officious, self-important busy bodies in the Valley. A rosy-cheeked, smooth-tongued Englishman, with his abdominal organs distended to a state of the most graceful rotundity from the reciprocal effect of high living upon roast beef and high steaming with strong beer and such like fluids, freshly arrived from the old country, where he had perhaps been accustomed to hold the stirrup of \"my Lord John\" or answer the bell of \"Sir Thomas\" with becoming servility, comes to the Salt Lake, and soon he begins to swagger with an air of lordliness and state at the bare thought of his recent emancipation. He looks down, as the humor of the moment may move him, with an air of unconcealed dislike or supercilious patronage, upon the native sons of America, who may chance to be passing through, or stopping a short time in the Valley. Generally he delights to cherish treasonable sentiments against the Government and authority of the United States, and sometimes dares so far as to give vent to his treasonable feelings in expressions of disrespect and contumely toward the Chief Magistrate and other high officers of the nation. Such characters are not unfrequently to be met with in this place. Do not understand me as disposed to indulge in any tirade against England or the English people. Next to the Government and people of our own country, I admire and venerate the institutions and people of Old England. But there is a vast difference between the accomplished cultivated English gentleman and the rude ignorant English boor. The one, is one of the most agreeable, fascinating companions in the world; the other, the most intolerably provoking and disagreeable character with which a gentleman can be brought in contact. Unfortunately many, very many, of the English in the Salt Lake Valley belong to this latter class. There are a number of Welsh in the Valley, who generally live in the country at some distance from the city. They generally constitute a very industrious and sober class of the community.\n\nOf the American portion of the population, by far the greater number came from New-York, and the other Middle and Eastern States. Occasionally a representative from the various Southern and Western States is to be found among their numbers. How a Missourian, or Kentuckian, or Carolinian, could ever have strayed off to these comparatively unknown wilds to unite himself to the Mormon Church, is a mystery which, I confess, quite altogether surpasses my comprehension. Yet here they are to be found. The Mormons almost universally belong to what are usually denominated the lower or laboring classes of society in the States and countries where they originally resided. The state of learning and intelligence prevailing among them generally, I should judge, by the appearance and conversation of most of those who came under my observation, to be at a very low standard, while many, very many of them, are destitute of the first rudiments of a common English education, being rude and ignorant to a very high degree. I do not recollect to have ever met or seen among them a single person whose appearance, manners or speech, would indicate him as a gentleman of refined, cultivated or even educated mind. I do not except from this re-mark either the President, Governor Young, or any of the other leaders of the Church. And yet there are not a few men among them of naturally keen, shrewd, strong intellects. But if the natural intelligence of the Mormons is none the most penetrating, their acquired knowledge none the most perfect, or their manners the most polished, they possess, as in some measure a compensation for these deficiencies, those two cardinal virtues of the classes from which they have generally sprung, industry and sobriety, in a very remarkable degree. If external manifestations are to be taken as true types of inward feeling and character, energy, perseverance and sobriety are certainly prominent, not to say predominant, traits of the Mormon character.\n\nEvery Mormon has some employment, and what is more, usually prosecutes it with praiseworthy assiduity. An idle or drunken Mormon is a social phenomenon which has not yet fallen under my eye. There are but few liquor-shops in the city. I believe that these are rarely entered by any but emigrants and transient residents. The streets of the city are quiet and orderly at all hours, both of the day and night.\n\nAs an illustration of Mormon enterprise and perseverance, I will mention a well-authenticated fact in their history. Within an hour after the first adventurers had entered the Valley in 1847, some of them had hitched horses to the plow, and were engaged in turning the sod, while others were occupied in digging ditches and making other preparations for irrigation. Generally speaking I have found them civil, and not indisposed to give me all the information I sought in regard to the principal features of their religious and social organization. In regard to the honesty of their character and conduct, it is the fashion of most of the Gentiles to doubt and distrust it. Possibly I may have fallen somewhat into the prevailing fashion in this respect, but I must candidly admit that in my limited dealings with them I saw nothing to cause me to believe that the Mormons were in their business transactions either better or worse than other people.\n\nHaving said thus much of the men I must of course devote a few words to the women or ladies of Salt Lake. With all due regard to the obligations of gallantry and deference to the rights of the sex, I cannot say that the Mormon ladies can lay claim to any superiority over their lords and masters, the Saints, either in appearance, manners or education. With some very few exceptions they generally impressed me as having sprang from inferior grades of society. Whatever may be their ether virtues, which it is but fair to presume are not a few, beauty, refined and delicate features features, and graceful manners are most certainly not of the number.\n\nI may be permitted, without overstepping the bounds of propriety or encroaching upon the prerogatives of the sex, to say that a swain must be most deplorably persecuted with the darts of Cupid, indeed, who could fall in love with a Mormon lady at first sight. Mormon ladies, like those of other communities, are fond of making such little display of finery and fashion in dress, as is at their command. The styles in vogue vary as widely as the different costumes and usages of the various countries from whence they came. A favorite peculiarity of dress with many of them is to wear chip or Leghorn hats, somewhat after the fashion of those worn by Swiss and Italian peasant women, instead of bonnets. These sometimes serve to give some degree of piquancy to faces otherwise quite insipid or repugnant in their expression of features. The efforts of some of the beauties, both young and old, to make a fashionable display of their charms, is somewhat grotesque in the extreme.\n\nThe position of the women here is altogether second-ary to that of man. Perhaps were I to say that the women were in a state of entire and absolute subjection to the men, the term would be more truly expressive of the actual state of the relations existing between them. According to the creed which they have mutually adopted, a woman stands no chance of early happiness or spiritual salvation, unless she is married, or, in their parlance, sealed to a man. The men thus holding in their hands the keys of the women's fate, are not restricted in the number of those to whom they will with princely liberality and Christian charity extend the blessings of happiness and salvation, while poor woman is forced, under heavy penalties, even that of death, to confine herself to the sovereign rights of but one husband.\n\nThis is a right and privilege which many of the Saints avail themselves of to its fullest extent. Bigamy or polygamy is a cardinal doctrine in the faith, and a main feature in the practice of the Mormons. It is acknowledged and practiced openly and without disguise. Many of the Saints consider their liberality and capabilities sufficiently large to justify them in taking under their saintly protection as many as ten or twelve, or even more wives, who are then denominated Spirituals. To entitle them to enter into this state of relative lordship and dependence, the consent of the President, Brigham Young, as to be first obtained, and then some qualified form or ceremony of marriage to be gone through with. The number of Spirituals attached to Governor Young's immediate household, and those over whom he exercises sovereign rights, it is impossible to determine. I have, however, seen his carriage or omnibus repeatedly drive up to the Church door of a Sunday filled with a dozen or more dames -- old, middle-aged and young -- all of whom, I am told, claim to be his well-beloved and honored wives. Besides these, I am informed that he has numerous other wives quartered in various parts of the city. Being the head of the community, I presume that he has the pick of the flock. If such is the case, I cannot say that I entertain any very extravagant admiration for his taste in female beauty.\n\nThe other leading Saints, I am told, have wives or spirituals, proportionate in number to their dignity and standing in the Church. These spirituals usually reside upon the same premises with their lords; some favorite wife usually occupying the principal mansion, while the others are quartered near by, in small cottages or out-buildings erected for their accommodation. Sometimes the family becomes so large as to imperatively require a division, and they are then settled in diverse directions, the husband visiting the one or the other as taste and inclination may lead him. Strange to say, these numerous joint tenants, if I may use a legal phrase, of one lord most generally live together upon terms of the best understanding and most complete harmony. The green-eyed monster seems to have entirely overlooked the ladies of Salt Lake, in his round of terrestial visitations. -- Such a thing as a spiritual Kilkenny fight is a thing wholly unheard of and unsuspected in the annals of Mormonism.\n\nAs might be expected, the Mormons permit only a very guarded and restricted intercourse between their families and the Gentiles. With oriental jealousy they seem to doubt and distrust any and all social attentions upon the part of strangers to their wives and daughters. In fact, they generally utterly forbid the Mormon young ladies to engage in any association whatever with the young Gentiles of the city. But, unlike their great prototypes, the cautious and suspicious Mussulmen, they have no eunuchs of ferocious aspect and gigantic proportions to officiate as custodians of the sanctity of their domicils, and the precious treasures they contain. I think that very many of them might save themselves a world of doubt, anxiety and trouble, by the simple reflection, that where the temptation is weak, acts of transgression and crime are proportionately small.\n\nThe chief glory and consolation of the ladies, in the dearth of their other privileges, would seem to consist in the honor which they enjoy, to the most liberal extent, of becoming the mothers of an endless multitude of infant Saints, or Gods, as they impiously call themselves and their offspring. The number of children in the Valley is quite incalculable. It surpasses all belief. Almost every lady who has attained the age of womanhood carries one of those juvenile responsibilities in her arms. From this, some idea of the rapidly-growing population of Salt Lake may be obtained. These godlike infants are usually honored, shortly after birth, with some odd biblical or other quaint name, such as Zebulon, Erastus, Jerediah, Nehemiah, Naptha, and Tamar, and so on.\n\nI have been a regular attendant once or twice every Sabbath, since I have been here, at the only house of worship in the place. The character and ceremonial of the services bear a strong similitude to those of several of the Protestant denominations. The services are first opened with prayer; then follows a hymn sung in a kind of operatic chant, by a choir of not very musical or cultivated looking songsters, male and female, to the accompaniment of violins, clarionets, flutes, and several other varieties of musical instruments. After this comes the sermon, or sermons, by one or more of the Elders. When these are through, miscellaneous subjects are introduced, and then the congregation is dismissed with prayer. The pulpit is generally occupied by the President, two Vice-Presidents, and twelve Apostles, and occasionally other leading Elders, some of whom commonly address the assembled multitude, as may be agreed upon at the moment, without previous preparation.\n\nA Sunday or two since I had the pleasure of hearing a sermon upon the plurality of wives, from Brother Orson Pratt, as well as the reading of the original revelation to Joseph Smith upon the same subject, by President Young. From these I gathered a clearer insight into the mysteries of Mormon theology than I had ever had before. The Mormons believe in the authenticity of the Old Testament, and in the divine character, mission, and revelations of Jesus Christ. But they further believe that similar revelations of the divine will were made to Joseph Smith, and are now being made, as circumstances require, to Brigham Young and the other patriarchs of the Church. The Mormons believe in polytheism as well as polygamy. The two go hand in hand. The one creates and proves the necessity of the other. According to the original ideas of their theology, they are themselves all Gods and the progenitors of Gods, varying in power, intelligence and dignity, who have humiliated themselves for a while by appearing upon the earth and assuming a human form.\n\nOne of their great duties in their humiliated character is to propagate their species, and people not only this but also worlds unnumbered and uncreated with their descendants, Gods like themselves. Hence the great necessity and reason for the adoption of the system of the plurality of wives, for the more speedy accomplishment of this, the great object of their being. After death they will ascend to heaven, resume their original godship, and there live a state of perpetual beatific enjoyment, surrounded by their numerous wives and posterity. In their belief there is no such place as a separate distinct hell. Hell consists simply in the deprivation of those who are unworthy from the joys and pleasures of heaven. I wish that I had time to give you a brief sketch of many of the novel views and ideas developed in this original and characteristic sermon. I think that you would find it both curious and interesting, and gain from it a more perfect and satisfactory idea of the peculiarities of this strange religion than you could from most any other source.\n\nOne singular idea advanced by Mr. Pratt in this discourse I cannot refrain from mentioning. That was, that the principal reason why the people of the United States and Europe did not adopt the system of a plurality of wives was that they were too avaricious and penurious to support such large families; that they were fast becoming too fond of gold to support even a single wife and her offspring. This explanation of a custom which has heretofore been attributed to virtuous principle upon the part of our people and Europeans, will undoubtedly surprise and shock not a few of them. The Saints are using every endeavor to make proselytes to their religion. They are sending out missionaries, with that object, to every quarter of the globe. In a few days some eighty or ninety of these apostles of Mormonism will depart upon their missions, some destined to the various States of the Union, others to the different countries in Europe, and others yet to China, Hindostan, Australia, the Sandwich Islands, and other remote regions. They are generally selected promiscuously from the community of Saints at large, and are sometimes called upon to depart upon these distant missions with not more than a week or ten days notice, and without pay or reward. This duty they usually perform with cheerfulness and alacrity. Mr. Pratt, who delivered the sermon to which I have alluded, accompanies the party on a mission to Washington City, where he goes to edit a Mormon paper. Through the columns of his journal, I presume that the public will be fully enlightened as to all the more important points of Mormon theology, including the doctrine of spiritual wives as well as others.\n\nIn point of political feeling, I believe that there is little or no genuine American spirit or sentiment among the Mormons. If they ever entertained any feelings of attachment to the Government and institutions of the country, I am satisfied that a succession of what they regard as gross persecutions and hostilities upon the part of the people of several States, has almost if not totally eradicated it from their minds. They are undoubtedly suspicious and unfriendly to the great body of the citizens of the United States. Such being their feelings towards the people, it is but natural to conclude that the same doubts and dislike extends to the Government which that people maintain and control. That treasonable feelings and sentiments toward the National Government prevail in this community to a much greater extent than is generally supposed in the States, is a fact of which I feel perfectly convinced. If these feelings have not yet manifested themselves in open acts of rebellion, or disrespect of the authority of the Government, it is mainly because they are not yet sufficiently confident of their strength, or have not deemed the provocation sufficiently great to justify them in taking so decided a course. I believe that a few years' increase in strength, and a propitious occasion, will develop to the conviction of everybody. I base my opinion not so much upon any positive acts or expressing that I have either heard or seen, as upon the general turn and character of their conversation, and information derived from the most credible sources. The conduct of the returning United States officers, in deserting their poet at the time they did, is universally condemned here by all persons with whom I have conversed upon the subject. They left at the most critical period, when they stood in no immediate danger of personal violence, and by their presence might have caused such a positive development of the true feelings and intentions of the Mormons toward the Government as would have enabled it to take hold of and crush their treason in the very bud.\n\nNotes: (forthcoming)\n\nVol. ? New York City, Saturday, July 2, 1853. No. 585.\n\nTHE BEAVER ISLAND MORMONS.\n\n______\n\nCorrespondence of The N. Y. Tribune.\n\nBURLINGTON, Wis., Thursday, June 16, 1853.\n\nA friend has just shown me The Weekly Tribune of June 4, the second article of which is made up principally of a communication from Mackinaw to The Detroit Free Press, concerning the Mormon Settlement at Beaver Island. I have not seen The Free Press, and do not know any further than appears by your paper, what were the proceedings of the meeting at Mackinaw, to which you allude. But feeling sure that you would not willingly \"go with the multitude to do evil,\" nor lend your strength to the strong for wickedness, rather than the weak for righteousness, I ask your attention, and that of your readers to the following facts.\n\nThe Mormon Settlement at the Beaver Islands has been in the jurisdiction of Mackinaw County six years; having been commenced the 11th of May, 1847, and judicially organized as the County of Emmet the 9th day of May, 1853. The last three years of that period have witnessed a spirit of continued and bitter hostility on the part of a large portion of the People of Mackinaw, toward the Mormons, during which there have been arrested at different times, and taken to Mackinaw, and tried on various criminal charges, upward of sixty Mormons, every one of whom has been acquitted and discharged.\n\nI have not overlooked the allusion to Mormon witnesses and Mormon jurymen, of which I have a word to say hereafter. In this place it is enough to say that not a Mormon ever sat on a jury a Mackinaw, and but one of those sixty persons introduced a witness in his defense. That one was John E. Hill, charged with arson, who, though he made an ample defense, was nevertheless required by a Mackinac Justice, to give bail to answer. But gentlemen in Mackinaw, though he was a total stranger, became his bail, and a Mackinaw Grand Jury refused to indict him.\n\nFrom these facts, can there be but one conclusion?\n\nIf respectable citizens residing at a distance could for a moment divest themselves of prejudice, and learn the question really at issue, these attempts to produce acts of lawlessness and mobocracy could never become formidable. It is foreign support that gives them all the consequence they ever possess.\n\nThe sole cause of the present demonstration against the Mormons is this: The State of Michigan has a Liquor Law -- not the Maine Law -- which was passed at the late session, of the Legislature, and to be voted on by the people next week; but the Michigan Law, the effect of which is substantially this, that no person shall sell spirituous or intoxicating liquors in quantities less than 28 gallons, unless he gives responsible sureties in large amounts to answer for any damages, contingents, collateral or otherwise, happening from their use, &c.\n\nThe people of the Beaver Islands generally oppose the use of intoxicating drinks; and for the purpose of making this law quite as effectual as the Maine Law could be, we last year assembled every man who could justify as surety for a liquor dealer, and, on full consultation, mutually pledged ourselves to each other and to the public, to not become surely for any person to sell liquor.\n\nThis pledge being kept, it was impossible that any one should get legal authority to sell. Many shifts were made to evade the law, by fishermen, and especially by men trading with the Indians. But the officers did their duty, in spite of threats of violence, civil, war, the destruction of their settlement and death; and the trade was suppressed on all the Beaver Island group, except Gull Island only.\n\nAt the spring election, the three townships of Prairie, Galilee, and Charlevoix, composing the county of Emmet, elected officers of the same stripe; and, that the traders might be fully warned before they laid in their supplies, and therefore have no reason to find fault because they were compelled to keep the law, the following notice was inserted in The Northern Islander of May 12th:\n\n\"There is a prevalent practice of sending out trading vessels to trade on the fishing grounds, with a supply of liquors. We wish it understood that authority to sell intoxicating liquors in Mackinaw, does not carry with it the right to sell on Lake Michigan. From Old Mackinaw to the west line of the State, and south to Grand Traverse Light, the Lake and all the Bays are exclusively in Emmet County.\n\n\"If the trade is persisted in, the Sheriff will go out and make arrests in all such cases. The law will be inforced at whatever cost. He is a fool who at this day, thinks he can defeat it by crying \"pirates,\" \"robbers.\" That cry has been raised once too often.\"\n\nHad this notice never appeared, the public meeting at Mackinaw, would not have been held, and the communication in The Free Press would never have been written. Mackinaw has a deeper interest in this liquor trade, probably, than any other town of the same population in the State. From 12 to 20 groggeries are constantly (during the fishing season), open to easterners; the boarding houses are generally supplied with bars, and well patronized; but the liquor sent off on the fishing grounds, and sold, is far more than that drank in Mackinaw. And when I add that most of this, is the article known as \"Indian Whisky,\" a barrel of which consists of two gallons of alcohol, thirty gallons of water, tobacco enough to make it intoxicating, and cayenne pepper enough to give sufficient strength, and justly entitle it to the Indian name of \"fire water,\" costing but six cents per gallon, and sold at 25 cents per quart and by the cask at 50 cents per gallon; you can form some rough idea of what Mackinaw would lose by the enforcing of this liquor law throughout the fisheries.\n\nThere are in Emmet County, from five to six hundred adult male Indians, whose principal business is fishing. Each Indian will, with the assistance he gets from his wife and children, catch and cure, on an average, 100 barrels of fish in the season -- if he keeps sober. Probably they have [one half] that for a few years past; the balance of time, and nearly all the avails, being sacrificed to liquor.\n\nFive hundred Indians taking each fifty barrels of fish makes 25,000 barrels, usually sold on the ground at about $4 per barrel. (The purchaser furnishing barrels and salt,) making the snug sum of $100,000. Now if $75,000 of this purchase money is paid in Indian whisky, costing say five or six cents per gallon and sold at from fifty cents to one dollar, and the other $25,000 in goods of the worst quality at such prices as intoxicated Indians can be induced to take them at, you can see readily that the trade must be very lucrative to those engaged in it, however ruinous it maybe to the Indian fisherman; and it is these outrages on the red man, and the vast mass of concomitant wrongs, that the Mormons have set themselves to work, effectually to prevent, by the regular enforcement of the public statutes; for doing which we are threatened with civil war. We will take the issue. God give prosperity to the right.\n\nHeretofore, when there was no legal organization at Grand Traverse, the Missionaries among the Indians there prevented the liquor traffic with these bands, by inducing the Indians to go in a body, headed by their Chiefs, and spill upon the ground any liquor that was brought there for sale. Unfortunately, two years ago, when there was a lawless crusade against the Mormons; they threw their weight on the side of Mobocracy. They have reaped the reward of their error, by having numerous bands of lawless renegades settle in their neighborhood, establish trade in liquor, and introduce all manner of dissipation and licentiousness among Indians, that were rapidly advancing in civilization and the industrial arts. And recently a vessel came from Green Bay and anchoring in the harbor of one of the most flourishing Indian towns on Grand Traverse, commenced exchanging whisky for maple sugar, manufactured by the Indians. The Missionaries applied to a Magistrate for a warrant for this outrage upon the law; but when the Constable went aboard the vessel to arrest the aggressors, they took him prisoner, and finishing up their trade, carried him with them to Wisconsin before they let him go. And this, I submit, is the natural fruit of giving aid to lawlessness against us.\n\nThe Indian villages of the Cross, Middle, and Le Arbour, Croche, in the County of Emmet have heretofore furnished more than others in that region, and have gradually increased in population, as many bands around have become extinct. This fact is to be attributed to the great efforts of the Catholic Priests residing in these village, to prevent the introduction of liquors among these Indians  efforts in which they have been materially and honorably aided by the Brothers Wendell, merchants in Mackinaw, who are the principal traders in these villages; and in all their dealings have shown an honorable regard to humanity, and the interests of their customers.\n\nBut the great extension of the fishing business for the last few years has invited the class of small peddling traders on to the fishing grounds, and with them the fatal \"firewater,\" and \"wasting\" and \"annihilation\" have set their mark on these bands of Indians as well as the others. If the Mormons, citizens of Emmet county, can enforce the Liquor Law of the State, these bands are saved. If not, they are lost. But the traders who wish to go there to sell whiskey, will go howling through the land, about the thousands of expected profits, of which the Mormons have robbed them, by enforcing the law or punishing them for their crimes. Will papers of the character of The New York Tribune lend their aid to such a cause, by ever publishing without reprobation these threats of lawless violence?\n\nThe Beaver Island band of Indians have had no priests or missionary among them; but are visited once a year by the priest from \"the Cross.\" Their fisheries were the best in the lakes, and they were the most successful fishermen. Since 1842, there have been traders constantly among them, and the \"fire water\" has been there.\n\nIn 1818 there were four hundred families of them, and their corn-field, (a portion of which I have now in cultivation,) was one thousand acres in extent. Then the liquor was brought among them but twice a year. I do not know when their decay commenced, but when I first visited them in 1847, they were reduced to between forty and fifty families, yet I was assured that none had emigrated.\n\nWhen they separated from their former associates, (the fall and winter of 1851,) the traders and fishermen had affiliated with the Mormons, and there were but twenty-seven families. Winter was just setting in, and they were in a state of destitution. Not one family among them had the means of getting through the winter. As the winter was uncommonly severe, I think that but for us they would have generally perished and the band been annihilated.\n\nIn the very short time that they have been under our influence, their condition has become so much improved that they are the pride and envy of all the other bands.\n\nOur policy has been to keep the fishing business in the hands of the Indians, because they can earn as much, at that as white men can; and to carry on a mutually beneficial trade among them, by furnishing them with what they really need, and purchasing of them what they have for market, at prices which would be honorable between white men.\n\nAnd I submit that this is the policy, not only of humanity, but of an enlightened self-interest. For we are settlers there, having a permanent interest in the growth, the prosperity, and the institutions of the country. The Indians are our best customers, not merely in trade, but in the mechanical and agricultural productions which we have constantly to sell. But more than all, is the pleasure of seeing a few of the vast race of red men, redeemed from a utter annihilation, and to be able to say, \"This is my work.\"\n\nIndians know how destructive to them spirituous liquors are. They are generally indisposed to drink. Traders going among a band who have had none for some time, usually find it difficult to get them to taste. But when once the lip touched, their appetite is gnawing and insatiable. There is nothing they will not sacrifice; no indignity they will not submit to for more. But they hate the man that sells it to them -- though under the influence of liquor they will serve the dealer for any purpose, no matter how wicked, yet aside from it their attachment is to those who do them good.\n\nThe Beaver Island band (now residing on Garden Island) were only a little more than two years ago armed and hunting me for my life -- set on by those who were crusading against me at that time -- excited by liquor, and allured by the offer of a reward for my head, yet for eighteen months past they have surrounded me as so many children, eating at my table, and sleeping in my house whenever business or pleasure calls them to Saint James, as though they were members of my family. But there is no vagrancy -- no vagabondism among them. They are careful, unsolicited, to bring as much as they use.\n\nSuch has been their prosperity since they affiliated with us, that the more sedate and orderly of other bands have come and joined them, so that in a year and a half the band is more than doubled. Among those who have thus joined them, is the brave and noble Kim me-one, whom the reader of Miss Strickland's \"Winter Studies and Summer Rambles\" will remember as her particular favorite at Mackinac.\n\nLast fall, the Indians left the other fisheries, where whisky was sold, and came to Beaver, where it was not, until there were two hundred boats and about six hundred souls of them there. No whisky being there, and no persons but Mormons and Indians, not a word was heard about stealing. The fact is significant.\n\nAll the Indians, for fifty miles around Beaver, when injured by a white man. come to me for redress, and having committed a cause to my hands, never one was heard to complain of the disposition of it. Wa-ta-ne-sa, a chief of noble presence and great influence, now 76 years of age last year, took his boat, when I was gone to Mackinaw, and met me thirty miles out to tell me that there was a white man on Garden Island, offering liquor to the Indians.\n\nShabbona, well known throughout Northern Illinois, and distinguished for his diplomacy in opposition to Black Hawk at the opening of the Sack and Fox war, came, last year, from his present house, beyond Missouri, to visit his native place and his relatives at Little Traverse Bay, and after stopping three weeks with them, came 40 miles out of his way to Beaver Island, to express to me, personally, his gratitude for my kindness and beneficial protection to the Indians.\n\nThe Catholic Priest from Cross Village, when making his annual visit to the Beaver Island Indians last year, charged them, last of all, that if they got into any difficulty they should go to Strang; if anybody cheated them they should go to Strang; if anybody came among them selling whisky they should go to Strang; but they must not go to hear Strang preach. This priest is a simple hearted and devout Slavonian, who has given his life to the melioration of the condition of the Indian race, according to the Catholic faith. With the prejudice of his faith, and the narrowness of his experience, he could not mistake what was going on at his door.\n\nSubsequently, when in Detroit, I was invited by the Right Rev. Bishop to his house, and there received from him personally the expression of his gratitude and thanks for the efficient aid which I had rendered in saving those simple hearted and almost helpless and hopeless members of his flock from utter destruction.\n\nThese are my trophies. Such as these come pouring in upon me continually. With them I am content, and with and for them I am willing to live and die hated, of any and every man, who offers Lynch law and mob violence as a remedy for any of the evils of society, be they what they may.\n\nBut though this question of the liquor trade is the sole cause of the present emeute at Mackinac, there are many collateral questions, which, as a matter of course, involve themselves in it.\n\nMackinac is an old town, built under the guns of the fortress, when the country was filled with powerful and frequently [hostile] Tribes of Indians. Traders settled there and invested the best natural advantages, but because there was military immovable improvements, not because Mackinac presented large amounts of money in buildings, wharves, and other protection there.\n\nThese investments have become fixed capital, the value of which depends entirely on the prosperity of Mackinac.\n\nBut at the same time the trade of the place is rapidly dying out. The fur trade, which, I am told, at one time employed three thousand boats, and in which, the outfits at Mackinac involved a capital of two million dollars, now does not employ one boat and probably amounts to less than two thousand dollars per annum.\n\nThe Indian trade, growing out of the payment of Government annuities to the Inoims. is not one-fourth what it was, and will end in 1856, by the expiration of the annuities payable there.\n\nTwenty-two unorganized counties in the Lower Peninsula, as well as a large portion ef the Upper, were attached to Mackinac for judicial purposes, and her jurisdiction extended from Saginaw Bay to the head of the Menomee river, more than a quarter of the State.\n\nWhatever of patronage the administration of the law, ever so large a territory would give, Mackinac had. But by the late Session of the Legislature, three new counties were organized in this territory, and all the territory south of the Straits and all the productive Islands included in their jurisdiction; divesting Mackinac of three quarters of b territory, and building up three new county scats, with Circuit Courts in her immediate vicinity.\n\nConsidering that the bills erecting these new counties were introduced and carried through by a Mormon, a member of the Legislature hailing from Beaver Island, whom the people of Mackinac, attempted to drag from his seat by a gross outrage on the House, for which they received a deserved rebuke, possibly they may be excused for feeling a little annoyed. But I cannot see that that feeling would justify a departure from the due administration of the Law.\n\nThere are several small politicians in and about Mackinac, managing a small clique there, who have heretofore occasionally held office by the votes of Mormons at Beaver Island, and looked for a continuance of these favors. These men pretend to be our friends, solely from a regard to the right, and at the expense of their interest at home. Detaching Beaver Islands, and erecting the County of Emmet, leaves them in a hopeless minority in Mackinac. If they were time-serving men, and hypocritical friends, they would now seek the favor of their old opponents by being first and loudest to cry out against the Mormons. I shall look for their names among the officers and speakers at the public Meeting at Mackinac.\n\nAdd to this that there are a few mail offices to be distributed by the present Democratic Administration, among the hungry in that part of the State -- four of which are located in Emmet County -- and as that was the Banner County, having given a unanimous vote for the entire Democratic ticket at the last fall election, Emmet politicians naturally expect a share in the appointments. A little seasonable outcry against the Mormons just at this time, especially if taken up and echoed by papers of the standing of The Tribune, would be a capital investment for the small politicians of Mackinac, and probably might result in giving to them four more of the five loaves and two fishes which make up the seven cardinal principles of the politicians.\n\nWhile everything else in which Mackinac [has to] share has been departing and vanishing. The [----ing] and the trade growing up with that Business has been rapidly increasing.\n\nUnfortunately, though Mackinac has the buildings, wharves, vessels, merchandise; both the fixed and convertible capital necessary for conducting this business, it is remote from the fisheries, has no harbor but an open and unsafe road, and is an expensive place of residence. -- Whereas Saint James, the principal Mormon village and seat of Justice of the county of Emmet, is in the very center of the fisheries, has the best harbor in the Lakes, and is well supplied with those articles of food which do not bear transportation without a great enhancement of price, from the very productive Island of Big Beaver, forty thousand acres in extent.\n\nThese advantages, have in the last four years, under the most propitious circumstances, transferred a full third of the trade in fish and fishermen's supplies, from Mackinac to Saint James. Dealers at Saint James, without storehouses, wharves or vessels, with no experience in business, and only a few hundred dollars capital to begin with, are building up fortunes, while dealers of experience with all the conveniences of trade, and large capital, at Mackinac have been giving way, or barely able to sustain themselves; and their real estate is steadily and hopelessly diminishing in value.\n\nIf buildings and wharves could be transported, as readily as vessels and merchandise, it is easy to see that at the end of six months there would not be a fish trader left in Mackinac. The two or three hundred thousand dollars there invested in stores, dwellings, and wharves, is so much fixed capital, to be utterly lost, unless some portion of the growing trade can be kept there.\n\nFish can only be sold at reduced prices, without inspection. The Inspector was a county officer and resided at Mackinac. Last year Saint James sent to market seventeen thousand barrels of fish. Yet the Inspector would not give us a Deputy. To send them to Mackinac for inspection, would cost in transportation, wharfage, and Inspectors' fees, from sixty to seventy-five cents per barrel, and consequently they were generally sold without inspection at the loss of fifty cents on the barrel.\n\nNow we have our own Inspector, and with our improved and improving facilities for business, the result cannot fail of being foreseen, and the hope of prolonging decay, until some favorable turn of the wheel of fortune, shall enable present holders of real estate in Mackinac to sell out, is a sufficiently powerful incentive to action, to account for more than one act of injustice.\n\nI observe that the communication you copy from The Free Press charges the Mormons with new and extraordinary boldness and daring in their robberies; gives, as an instance, the stealing some two hundred barrels of fish, and the destruction of some $2,000 worth of property at Birch Point, and accounts for this now boldness by saying that \"offenses committed upon the shores and waters of Lake Michigan between a line running from Point St. Ignan across the Straits to Old Mackinac and a line running from the south side of Grand Traverse Bay to Menomonee River, are exclusively in Emmet County, and the offenders must be tried by Mormon tribunals, with good Mormons for witnesses and Jurymen.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the force of this argument, \"Birch Point\" is not within those boundaries, nor in the County of Emmet, but in the body of the County of Mackinac, and offenses committed there are tryable exclusively by \"Mackinac tribunals with good Mackinac men for witnesses and Jurymen.\" lf they have the indubitable evidence they tell of, that the robbery was committed by men from Beaver Island, they will of course avail themselves of the present occasion to put them in \"durance vile.\" The Mormons are of opinion that something far short of \"indubitable evidence'' would suffice if they fell Into the hands of the Philistines at Mackinac.\n\nMoreover it is not true, as a matter of law, that offences committed on any part of the waters of Lake Michigan, are exclusively in the jurisdiction of Emmet County. The Counties of Van Buren, St. Joseph, Allegan, Ottawa, Oceana, and Emmet have concurrent jurisdiction, on the waters of the Lake to the State line.\n\nWithal, this story of stealing two hundred barrels of fish, sounds rather fishy. It is a full match to that of a man who stole a saw mill, and got well off, but was detected as he went back after the dam. Two hundred barrels are a big pile to steal. Birch Point is more than twenty miles from the nearest Mormon settler, but there were several little settlements of fishermen, not noted for an extra allowance of honesty, wintering along the shore in that vicinity. They might have stolen a few fish to eat in the course of the winter; but two hundred barrels is too big a pile to steal.\n\nThe fishermen at Birch Point and on the north shore generally, receive their outfits from Mackinac, and are almost to a man in debt for them. Last year they did but indifferently, and many were unable to settle up in the fall. At the close of the season the traders send their vessels around, and not only get all the fish they can from their customers, but gather up all their barrels and salt. Such articles are only left on the fishing grounds in small quantities, and at inaccessible places, as any prudent business man will readily believe. Most certainly, if the traders in Mackinac believe a tithe of what they have said of Mormon dishonesty and rapacity within the last three years, they would not leave two thousand dollars worth of moveables on the shore of the Lake, only twenty-five miles from the Mormon settlement, from the close of fishing in the fall till the opening in the spring, and no one to guard it. Either the truth of what has been said against us for several years past is false, or this story must be.\n\nThe Mormons are known by everybody in that region to have three vessels, and no more. Of these, two, the Dolphin and Emmluo, were hauled out last fall for repairs, and as late as the 12th May had not yet been launched, and this fact can be proved by the officers of the numerous steamboats which call almost daily at Beaver Harbor. The other, the Seaman, passed Mackinac on a trip to Drummond Island some days before the burning of the shanties at Birch Point, arrived at Drummond sometime previous to that outrage, and remained there, at least 80 miles from the scene of that crime, till several days after it was done and known in Mackinac. And this fact can be proved by the entire settlement at De Tour, not one of whom are Mormons. Among them is Hon. Ebenezer Warner, Register of the Land Office at Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThere was wintered last winter, in a little nook or bay of Garden Island, the yacht Mary Clark, I believe -- for the name is painted out, and the name Defiance daubed over it -- formerly of Chicago, and probably the best sailer on the Lakes, now in the hands of one Capt Shepard, neither a Mormon nor a friend of the Mormons, though he wintered in their neighborhood. This vessel went out some day before the burning of the shanties at Birch Point, and did not return till some time after, and its business at that time has never been accounted for. If any considerable quantity of property was in fact stolen this fact would be of importance. But, candidly, I most truly believe the story of the stealing was hatched up by some dishonest fishermen, as an excuse for not paying up their arrears with the traders who supplied them, and the burning to give force to the statement; or perhaps it was done, to give force to the statement; or perhaps to cover up some trifling speculation which the fishermen were practicing on each other. The most valuable buildings were not burned, as they would have been had the object been to waste and destroy, and it is beyond measure incredible that that amount of property should be left in such a place.\n\nAllow me to add, that this is not the first or second time that charges of the most astounding crimes have emanated from Mackinac against the Mormons at Beaver Island. That at different times they have been made the subject of legal investigation, and in every instance the result has vindicated the uprightness and intelligence of the Mormons. Yet so greedy is the public ear for some tale of Mormon corruption, that it seems scarcely possible to invent so barefaced and incredible a lie that it shall not find a place in some respectable paper, and believers among its readers.\n\nAs an instance, I may mention that The Buffalo Rough Notes last summer published editorially, with pointed comments, the statement of some sailors, that the Mormons on Beaver Island went boldly in the day time on board the lake steamers, in armed bodies, and pirated from them, and were unwhipped of justice; and Mr. Cadwalader, the able conductor of that journal, never opened his eyes to the utter incredibility of such an assertion until I pointed it out to him. I presume many of his readers believed it undoubtingly.\n\nI deprecate such publications, because their tendency is to produce disorder and violence. They are an encouragement to those who resort to mobs on the pretense that the law is not strong enough. What was said about the boundaries of Emmet County, and Mormon tribunals, Jurymen and witnesses, could only be designed as an excuse for resorting to other than legal remedies.\n\nThe resort to civil war against the Mormons has been made in two or three instances, on similar pretenses; but I believe that all respectable men look upon those acts as a national disgrace; nearly every writer who has alluded to them, and all the tribunals which have investigated them, have exonerated the Mormons from the charges on which they were mobbed.\n\nBut this Mormon tribunal, which is to let the criminals go free, what is it? It is a Circuit Court of the State of Michigan, to be held by Hon. Samuel T. Douglass, of the City of Detroit. This is the only tribunal, except Courts held by Justices of the Peace. Of course it is enough to say that the appeal would be to the Circuit Court, as it has heretofore to the District Court, and under the old Constitution, to the County Court in Mackinac, where numerous judgments rendered by Mormon Justices have been appealed, AND NOT ONE REVERSED.\n\nBut the whole allusion to Mormon tribunals, witnesses and jurymen, is gratuitous. The tribunal has not been organized, the jurymen have not been empanelled, nor the witnessed brought into Court.\n\nMen judge of the moral standard of other men's conduct by their own, and for any man to say of the tribunals, jurymen, &c. of Emmet County, before they have ever done an act that they will use their power for corrupt purposes, is just precisely the same as to say, if he had their opportunity he would use it for corrupt purposes. It is his judgment upon himself, whom he does know, not us, who are yet to be tried. Truly and sincerely, JAS. J. STRANG.\n\nNote: See also the Tribune of May 27, 1853.\n\nVol. ?

It is the clearest exposition and boldest defense of Polygamy that we have yet seen, and coming from a person who possesses three wives, with a prospect of more, its arguments, and the facts stated, demand attention. We especially invito a perusal of it by Judge Douglas and his friends, whose \"Popular Sovereignty\" doctrine is to legalize Polygamy in Deseret and Utah, and, it may be, in Illinois also.\n\nCity of Salt Lake, (Deseret,) July 29, 1854.\n\nMy Dear Friend: I have been promising myself the pleasure of writing to you a long family sort of letter for the last eighteen months, as I assured you I would when we parted, and I should have done so, only that, somehow, when I had opportunities of sending one, one thing or another was sure to interfere with my time for writing.\n\n\"The fact is, the Salt Lake City is a place for work, and loafers and lazy people are entirely out of their element here. I never lived in a place where there is so prevalent a spirit of industry, or where drones are so little tolerated. As a consequence, there is scarcely any poverty -- none, I may say, except that which is the result of sickness and other misfortunes; and in such cases it is not marked by the painful features which are observable in the quarters of the poor in Rochester, Buffalo, and Chicago, where I have had opportunities of seeing for myself; for here, the poor are taken care of by the voluntary and liberal contributions of all, which are made in a profusion that you could not find in a community of skinflint Presbyterians, iron-sided Baptists, experience-telling Methodists, or with sanctimonious members of evangelical churches in general. No, no. Here there is a brotherly feeling, such as marked the character of the early Christians; and here is understood in its fulness the great truth, \"He that giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord.\"\n\n\"When I last saw you, in 1851, now nearly four years ago, you expressed your regret that I should connect myself with a church and become a member of a community, the doctrines and rule of conduct of which were repugnant to all the social rirtues and the religious principles which I had been taught from my childhood up to 1846. I had then (1851) lived five wars a believer in the truths of the Book of Mormon -- had steadily, and as faithfully as I knew how, examined the tendencies of those truths, and compared them with the old church of my father -- I may say fathers also, for they were all of one faith for three generations back -- and I had come to the conclusion that I had at last found out what was best for my spiritual wants, here and hereafter. It was after this long experience -- this forty years in the wilderness -- that I became satisfied with my duty, and set out, with my family, for the City of Deseret. Sarah Ann, you know, had her doubts about the move, especially as she had heard awful stories about the Mormons, who, following the example of the old Patriarchs, from Abraham down, had established social laws different from those which she had been accustomed to look upon is sacred. Louisa, our eldest girl, then fourteen, shared the feelings of her mother somewhat, but it had no foundation beyond education, and, I felt, would soon be eradicated.\n\n\"When I arrived in this city, I found all the comforts that I had expected, and was treated with a kindness and consideration that I never met with in New York, or any other State. While each person here was intent upon the acquisition of wealth, and all were as busy as bees, their conduct toward myself and all other new comers, impressed me with the belief that they only labored for wealth that they might have a means of benefiting those whom fortune had not favoured. My subsequent observation has not effaced but deepened that impression. There appears to be the greatest pleasure manifested by high and low, and especially by those who are high in the Church, in aiding the poor and helping them to help themselves -- the highest order of charity, in my estimation. Each one seems to feel that \"it is better to give than to receive;\" and the universal practical rule is, \"that he that giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord.\" And the truth of this latter principle has been fully and satisfactorily tested. The poor who are assisted soon become active and useful members of society and the Church, and are enabled to pay back, an hundred-fold, all that they ever received.\n\n\"So much for things in general. And now a word about the country. My dear friend, you have read Moore's enchanting description of the \"lovely vales of Cashmere.\" but I venture to say they will not at all compare in beauty or in delicious atmosphere with the charming valleys which are scattered all over Deseret like little Edens, while our mountain scenery is magnificent -- grand beyond the power of description. Here is the place for poetry and song, where one is perpetually surrounded by scenery and associations that develop the highest religious sentiments. The soil of our valleys is good; not as deep as the soil of the Genesee Valley, or as the Illinois prairies, but it is more lively, and produces more than any soil I ever saw in its virgin state. There is scarcely any species of grass, grain, or fruit, that we cannot grow in the fullest perfection, and, if farming receives the attention that it does in England and Holland, as I have no doubt it will, Deseret will be capable of feeding a population as large as three or four States like New York.\n\n\"When I first came here, I went at my trade and did well. Last year, however, I obtained a farm at the foot of one of the mountains which surround this valley, and I expect to have a little paradise of a place in a few years. Neighbours are numerous and good, and we shall possess all the educational advantages that you have in the States, and better, I think, for here our schools are better regulated. I still live in the city, that is, my family does, and I am here the greater part of my time, but I expect to take up my residence in the country early next year.\n\n\"About the progress the Territory is making, I need not say anything, as you will get it more in detail from the papers I send you. Suffice it to say, that we go ahead at a rate I never expected, however large my expectations were.\n\n\"But I suppose by the time, or before, you have read thus far, you have grown impatient, and wonder if I am going to avoid the subject which appears to concern the people of the States, as regards Deseret, more than anything else. No, my dear friend, I am not going to dodge it. There was a time when I might have been disposed to do so, knowing your feelings, but it is not right, and I shall be candid.\n\n\"Polygamy! POLYGAMY!! POLYGAMY!!! That is the word which you call it, and one would think, from the holy horror with which your editors, preachers, and politicians utter it, that it is a crime of a magnitude surpassing all others. My dear friend, I do not doubt many of you think so, but it is all the result of education -- nothing else, I assure you; for I speak from experience, as do thousands of others hereabout, who once thought as you do. But you must know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints discards all sectarian dogmas and comes to the plain, simple truths of the Bible -- the whole Bible, not a part of it. It looks to the lives of the Patriarchs and Prophets -- the men of \"pure religion and undefiled\" -- for principles, as well as to those who came after them. It sees no higher or more heavenly state of society than that which existed under the authority and direction of Jehovah anterior to the Christian era. Not that it opposes any doctrine of Christ, or those authorised to speak for him, for it would leave every one free; no, it gives the highest sanction it can give to every principle elaborated in the New Testament, while it makes the Old and the New entirely harmonize. The doctrine is founded on the Bible -- the eternal rock of Truth.\n\n\"But about the practical operation of Polygamy, as you call it. That is what you most probably want to know, and I shall enlighten you from my observation and experience.\n\n\"When I came to Deseret there were not many who were in the enjoyment of more than one wife, and many, or most of the new-comers, were opposed to it. But as they saw how beautifully and harmoniously those families lived where there were two or more wives, their prejudices gradually gave way, and among no class was this change more apparent than the women. At the present time, if a vote were taken upon the subject, I venture to say that nine out of every ten women who have lived here two years, would sustain our present social system in this particular. They are more for it than the men, for upon many of the latter it entails heavy burdens; though the truth is, our wives in Deseret make no pretensions to being fine ladies, their highest ambition being to help their husbands and their poor brothers and sisters in the Lord's Church. There are very few men here who have more than five wives, and a large part have but one, while some have none. For myself, I have three. Sarah Ann, your cousin, whom I married in York State, has the largest share of my affections, and takes precedence in the management of the household. Two years ago I married Miss S., formerly of Ohio, and she has charge of the education of the children and attending to the clothing. My other, which I took three months ago, is from near Hamburg, Germany. She is larger than either Sarah Ann or Elizabeth (the name of my second wife), and, I say it without invidiousness or impropriety, is decidedly handsome. Her person is of good size, very round, full chest, bright flaxen hair, and a soft blue eye. She enters into the duties of her new situation with wonderful alacrity, and is very happy, as are also Sarah Ann and Elizabeth. There is none of that jealousy -- that disposition to tear out each other's hair -- which you have probably imagined would show itself in such cases. We are all looking forward to the time when we shall be together constantly in our little Eden, where we can work for each other, and raise our children in \"the fear and admonition of the Lord.\" You may be surprised at this; but you will be still more so, when I assure you that all of my present wives are anxious that I should get another -- one who is fitted by education, and physically adapted, to take charge of the business of the dairy. With such an arrangement of my household, every department of a well-organized establishment, on a patriarchal scale, would have a head to it, and be governed in order. I have no inclination to comply on my own account, as I am well satisfied with those I now have, but if I should do so, it will be entirely out of regard for them.\n\n\"My daughter, Louisa, is engaged to be married to a man from Pennsylvania, who has already a wife and three children. It did not entirely meet my approbation, but I did not interpose a single objection, so long as she was satisfied, and the marriage would be in a high degree honorable to her, as well as advantageous in a worldly view.\n\n\"Now, my dear sir, you say, what is to come of all this? Let me tell you what has come of it. In Deseret, there are no libertines, with their paramours, no houses of prostitution, no cases of seduction, or those which disturb the peace of families m the States, under your laws. Here, every woman can have what God intended she should -- a husband -- and every man that wants to, may have a wife. And the woman that is the wife of a man who has one or more other wives, is more fortunate than if she were the only one, for in case of plurality the duties of the house are divided. The children here are pretty numerous, I must admit, but this should and does contribute to the happiness of the true followers of the Lord, from whom we have learned that our duty is to multiply and replenish. But, mark this: there are no illegitimate children in Deseret, no children of shame who are ashamed of their mothers, and a disgrace to any but the lowest society.\n\n\"I shall not enter into an argument to attempt to convince you that your sentiments in regard to the marriage relation are the result of education and are wrong. I wish you could live here a year or two, however, and I have not a doubt your acts would show you had changed your opinions.\n\n\"We learn from the States that you are greatly excited about the Slavery question, and our institutions are much canvassed in connection with the Popular Sovereignty doctrine of your Senator, Mr. S. A. Douglas. We wish your politicians would let us alone; that is all we ask of them. We have none of the breed here. The climate of Deseret is not congenial to them, and our wives will not give birth to children who are adapted to such a low life as the politician necessarily leads. It is said that Governor Young is to be removed, and a Washington politician appointed in his place, very well, let him come. The people of Deseret will treat him politely, and let him alone. He may stay in Washington and have just as many duties to perform as Governor, as if he were here.\n\n\"But we believe in the Popular Sovereignty doctrine. It is upon this that we stand, and with it we shall defend ourselves against the assaults of the world. It is the true doctrine, and I am sure it will triumph.\n\n\"I have not had an hour's sickness since I came here, neither has any member of my family. I have four more children than when we left Illinois, and it is not improbable that I may have many more. Certainly I hope so. * * * *\n\n\"You can get no true accounts from Deseret from your newspapers. The only way to appreciate, and to learn to love our institutions, is to live here.\"\n\nFrom The Chicago Press.\n\nWe passed half an hour yesterday in the company of two very intelligent representatives of the \"Latter-Day Saints\" in Utah -- Messrs. John Taylor and N. H. Felt. These gentlemen represent affairs in Utah in a very flattering light. The Saints are rapidly surrounding themselves with the various comforts and many of the luxuries of civilization. Emigration and natural increase are adding daily to their numbers, and the day is not very far in the future when Utah will be \"knocking\" for admission into the family of States, or preparing to defend an independent sovereignty of her own, in the mountain fastnesses, by the hardest kind of \"knocks.\" The crops of the past season had been somewhat injured by the grasshopper; but still, our informants assured us, there would be the greatest abundance harvested for the use of the Saints, and a surplus for the constantly arriving emigrants, as well as for those who may take Salt Lake in their way to California. Messrs. Taylor and Felt are on their way to New York, for the purpose of establishing a paper in that city, to be devoted to the propagation of the doctrines held by the Saints, and for the purpose of \"carrying the war into Africa,\" whenever and wherever provocation thereto may be offered. Mr. Taylor, in addition to the dignity of the \"Apostleship\" -- and a jolly, rubicund, wide-awake \"Apostle\" he is -- brings to the editorship of The Mormon a manifold experience in the profession, and we doubt not its columns will be eagerly and satisfactorily perused by the Saints into whose hands it may fall. Gentile though we be, we shall look for it with some interest ourselves, and our readers will doubtless be delectated with occasional excerpts from its columns touching the polity, politics, and domestic institutions of the Saints, as the same may be developed to the world. The object in establishing an organ in New York, Mr. Taylor assures us, is twofold. First, to defend the people of Utah from the misrepresentations of lying letter-writers and designing politicians; and secondly, to minister to the wants of the Saints scattered throughout the States. The mischief growing out of the two causes above-named has tended much to hinder the spread of Mormonism in the States, and greatly vexed and scandalized the pious souls who play the shepherd over the sheep collected in Salt Lake Valley. Our informants assured us that the people of the States have been led into many erroneous opinions touching the light in which executive appointments for Utah are looked upon. They desire competent and discreet men -- nothing more. Men of this character, they say, they have among themselves, more than sufficient to fill all the offices, and they think the President would only be carrying out his own doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, were he to so far respect the popular wish of the people of Utah as to select his appointees from among them. Nevertheless, they say, any competent, well-behaved man will be well received there as a territorial officer, if he will devote himself to the legitimate business of his office and let other matters alone. But the trouble has been, with a very few exceptions, that while the appointees were notoriously incompetent for the duties of their offices, they also intemeddled with the institutions and domestic relations of the \"Saints\" in a manner quite extra official, and carried things in a style of lordly superiority over those who considered themselves their equals in every respect. This is what they complain of. They want no tenth-rate lawyers placed over them, and they are by no means desirous that Utah should I be made a Botany Bay of, for the banishment of broken-down political hacks, who have sunk their character and capital in the States. We inquired of them about the Governorship of the Territory.\" Their answer was, that the people of the territory preferred Brigham Young in that capacity to any other living man. But they would not contend on this point. They would receive any competent man President Pierce might send out. to them as Governor. As for brother Brigham himself, he did not want the office -- would prefer not to be encumbered with it -- had his head, hands and heart full of other and more important matters. The rumors recently circulated respecting this matter, they said, originated at Washington, and were put afloat for political efi'ect. The people of the Territory care but very little about the matter one way or, the other.\n\nAs respects Slavery in the Territory we were assured there was but little of it there -- yet it is there. Some slaves had been liberated by their owners since they were taken to Utah: others still remain slaves. But the most of those who take slaves there pass over with them in a little while to San Barnardino -- a Mormon settlement in California, some 700 or 800 miles from Salt Lake City. How many slaves are now held there, they could not say, but the number, relatively, was by no means small. A single person had taken between 40 and 50, and many had gone in with smaller numbers.\n\nNotes: (forthcoming)\n\nVol. VII. New York City, Thursday, July 8, 1858.

U. T., Friday, June 12, 1858.\n\nMy next communication will be dated on the march towards Salt Lake -- for the present week has brought in all the supplies and troops for which the army of Utah have been postponing its advance. First came Colonel Hoffman with his supplies of provisions, clothing and forage; and on the 9th instant Captain Marcy came into camp with over 900 mules and about 150 horses of the stock which he went to New-Mexico to purchase. This gives us over 5,000 animals of all kinds, which will furnish abundance of transportation. Fortunately, the loss of animals during the Winter was scarce a twentieth part as great as was anticipated in view of the condition of the herds when the army went into Winter quarters. Under the judicious care of Mr. Milles, the head wagon-master, I believe less than 50 mules were lost during the Winter out of somewhere about 1,000 head, and his stock this Spring is in fine working condition, although wintered upon the dry grass which the animals hunted out from under the snow. Marcy's stock also is in fine order, so that there is nothing to be cone now but pack up and be off towards Zion.\n\nIn anticipation of these arrivals the commanding General issued the following preliminary order on the evening of its date:\n\nHEAD-QUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF UTAH, }\n\nCAMP SCOTT, U. T., June 5, 1858. }\n\nGENERAL ORDERS NO. 26. -- 1. Means of transportation and renewed supplies being near at hand, this army will, in execution of the orders of Government, at an early day resume its march to Salt Lake City.\n\n2. In the meantime the transportation present will be held in readiness, and each Chief of Staff and each Commander will complete the preparations for the march in his own department or command. Transportation will be furnished at the rates established in Central Orders No. 25, Headquarters troops, serving in Kansas, of 1857.\n\n3. Commanders will, without delay, make requisition for such clothing now on hand as is needed for immediate issue and for the march, and have prepared, by the arrival of the trains, requisitions for shoes and stockings. These requisitions will be made only on personal inspection and examination, by company commanders, into the wants of their men, in order that no articles may be drawn except those needed for the march. A small supply of clothing, for issue according to necessity, to the respective commanders, after arriving in the Valley, will be turned over to the Regimental and A. A. Quartermasters tor transportation.\n\n4. A command of at least three companies, to be designated in Special Orders, will constitute the guard at this Depot.\n\nThe Medical Directors, on or before the arrival of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Hoffman, will designate medical officer to remain with the command. The sick who are not able to march, will be left at this Depot.\n\nSupplies to be taken from those in charge of the Medical Purveyor will be liberally furnished the hospital attached to each regiment and to this Depot. The remaining hospital supplies will be prepared as required in paragraph 997 Army Regulations, and turned over to the Depot Quartermaster (to be designated) for transportation ac a future day to Silt Lake Valley.\n\nBy order of Brevet Brigadier-General A. S. Johnston. F. I. Porter, Ass't Adj.-General.\n\nThe publication of the second clause of the fourth paragraph of this Order had a remarkable effect upon the hospitals, rapidly depleting them of their tenants, for every man is anxious to move forward to the Valley. There has been very little sickness in camp, however -- much less than might have been anticipated, in view of the hard fare to which officers and men were alike subjected during the Winter, and also in view of the extraordinary changes of temperature peculiar to this region -- where the thermometer ranges from 18 degrees to 70 degrees often within twenty-four hours. The principal ailing is what is known as mountain fever -- a modified and easily-managed intermittent. We have had several hail storms during the last week, and, on the morning of the 10th, were visited by a furious snow-storm, which lasted until noon. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is usually very dry -- so much so that we often witness the fall of condensed vapors from clouds overhanging the heights all around us -- the vapors never reaching the earth, being entirely absorbed by the atmosphere in their descent.\n\nThe week has been one of busy preparation for the march, and yesterday the whole army rejoiced when the following order, directing the movement, was issued:\n\nHEAD-QUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF UTAH, }\n\nCAMP SCOTT, U. T., June 11, 1858. }\n\nGENERAL ORDERS NO. 28. -- The troops will march from this Camp in three divisions, in as many consecutive days, commencing with the First Division, and moving in the order of their number.\n\nSpecial instructions with regard to advanced, flank and rear guards will be given immediately after the execution of the preliminary movement herein directed.\n\nThe following will be the order of march, subject to an additional change on leaving Muddy Creek:\n\n1. Division composed of the Second Dragoons, Phelpp's Battery, and the Volunteer Battalion: to advance to the Muddy and await the arrival of the Second Division.\n\n2. Division, composed of the Fifth Infantry, Reno's Battery, and Company \"B\" Seventh Infantry.\n\n3. Division, composed of the Tenth Infantry, and Col. Loring's Battalion.\n\nThe morning after the arrival on the Muddy of the Second Division, the First and Second Divisions (Reno's Battery and \"B\" Company, Seventh Infantry excepted,) forming one division, will continue the march.\n\nReno's Battery, Company \"B\" Seventh Infantry, and the Third Division, now constituting the Second, will continue the march on the second day. The Head-Quarters will be with the Second Division as far as the Muddy; beyond that with the advance.\n\nBy order of Brevet Brigadier-General A. S. Johnston. F. J. Porter, Ass't Adj.-General.\n\nDetailed orders have also been issued to the force comprising the First Division, directing them to take up the line of march to-morrow, the 13th inst. It will be seen that the route to be pursued is not designated in the orders, being kept from publication here, at present, from motives of military precaution.\n\nLieutenant W. D. Smith's squadron of dragoons left camp yesterday morning with pack mules, to escort Capt. Newton, of the Engineers, who goes to reconnoitre the road and examine its condition and report. He is expected also to go to the Bear River, ascertain whether or no the bridge over it is still standing, and if not to select a suitable place for throwing across another. Gen. Johnston has had several strong portable bridges made here in camp, which will be carried along in the advance of the army, and used if occasion requires. The route which the army will take is not absolutely settled yet, but unless I am much mistaken, it will avoid the Canyons. The General wisely argues that military roads should never lie through Canyons for the reason that if assailed therein two important arms of the service -- the artillery and cavalry -- are nearly paralyzed, as they cannot be brought to bear upon an enemy under such circumstances except it be just at the point of attack. If there was any probability of Mormon resistance it would be the part of prudence to avoid the Canyons, and if there is no such danger, there is no need of special haste upon the march. In either event, therefore, the General probably sees no reason why he should not break a new road over the table lands north of the Canyons, or along the valley of the Bear River; in doing which a new road will be opened of advantage, perhaps, to emigrants and traders as well as to the military forces.\n\nIt is believed that a good route for a road lies between Echo Canon and Bear River Lake, which would be only thirty or forty miles longer than the Canyon road, and I have little doubt that it will be the route pursued by our army. If unexpected obstacle are met with there, the course of the Bear River will probably be followed all the way into Salt Lake Valley. This route would be very circuitous, adding two hundred miles or more to our march, as the river, from where we strike it, runs northward on the east side of the Wasatsh Mountains until it turns the northernmost spurs of the range and then hugs the same range again, as it pursues its course southward on the westerly side of the mountains. There is hardly a possibility, however, that this longer route will be found necessary or advisable. The time occupied in the march will be longer than I anticipated in my last, and we shall do well to find ourselves in Salt Lake City by the 1st of July.\n\nThe officers of the army of Utah are all required to keep a journal and itinerary, on which the geographical and topographical facts coming under their observation are all carefully noted. Suitable books for this purpose were provided by Gen. Johnston, one of which is handed to each officer as he starts out upon a scout, or to visit any portion of the surrounding country. It will readily be seen that these notes are rapidly accumulating a mass of valuable data, upon which to get out a complete and accurate topographical map of this entire region. Already Capt. Newton has sketched, from these and other data collected during the past winter, a very complete map of the route to the Valley, on which all the water courses, comprising grounds and settlements, are marked. Capt. Marcy's observations during his recent trip to New-Mexico will prove a valuable contribution to geographical science; -- but of that more in another branch of this communication.\n\nIt is now nine days since the Peace Commissioners and Governor Cumming left the Camp for Salt Lake City, but are yet without any intelligence as to the result of their conferences with the people of the Valley; but that fact will not retard the movements of the army for an hour now that it is ready to advance.\n\nEarly on the morning of the 8th instant a Mormon party arrived here from the city, headed by Groesbeck, the man who carried up a train of supplies to the city late last Fall, including more or less powder. His companions, in conversation smooth, quiet and plausible, carried with them, with an exception or two, the veriest scoundrelly faces that I have met in sometime. They brought down a few horses and provisions to sell, while on their way to Platte Bridge, whence they go to carry up part of their train left there by Groesbeck last Fall, for fear it should fall into the hands of Colonel Johnston. In order to forestall the latter result, they pretended to sell the train out to John Richard, the trader whose post is at the Bridge, having first cache all their goods that they could not pack on mules. These men state that they met Governor Cumming and the Peace Commissioners on the Weber River, whence they would reach the city on Monday the 7th instant. They state further that Brigham Young was not in the city to meet them, but had gone down to Provo, and that the people were still moving to the southward, not five hundred of them remaining in the city.\n\nWhen the party came into camp, one of their number, named John Hoagland, was immediately recognized by a volunteer as one of the ruffians engaged in burning the supply train on the Big Sandy, on the 5th of October last, and who robbed Jack Gunn, one of the teamsters on that occasion, of his Colt's revolver. Complaint was made at once, and Lieut. Grover, Provost Marshal, \"jerked\" Brother Hoagland suddenly, and placed him in the guard-tent of the 10th Infantry, with a file of well-armed soldiers, to keep him company. Before the arrest was made another volunteer, who was also a teamster, stated to Mr. Groves that he could identify Gunn's pistol, having often used it on the road; that it was a Colt's revolver, number 26 328. The Provost Marshal took the weapon from his prisoner's belt, and found the number corresponded with that stated by the witness. Thus man and pistol were clearly identified. A complaint was filed against him for robbery, and the preliminary examination was had on the 9th, before Mr. Carter, an excellent and conscientious merchant, who is acting Justice of the Peace for this county. The witnesses testified to the facts above stated, and gave the following account of the proceedings of the Mormon party:\n\nThe train had camped in a hollow near what is known as the bend of the Big Sandy, when a party of Mormons under Lot Smith, well mounted and armed rode up, with their rifles cocked and held in position for instant use. A glance at the surrounding hills showed that there were others of the party poted as a sort of picket guard, to give notice of the approach of any relief which might possibly be in the vicinity. The assailants declared themselves Mormons, said said they had come to burn the trains, and ordered all \"the boys\" to get out their arms and lay them down in a pile. Conceding at once that resistance was useless, the teamsters obeyed the order. After some conversation, which resulted in Smith's agreeing that the attacked party should keep two of the wagons, with rations, to enable them to join their friends, the leader told his men to -- \"get to work\" -- whereupon the Mormons proceeded to break up the ox yokes and bows, and to pile them up on the wagons preparatory to burning. This done, they set fire to the train, with all its contents.\n\nAbout, the time the fire was kindled, Hoagland, by permission of Lot Smith, went to Gunn and told him be wanted his pistol -- that they were going after Captain Magraw, of the Wagon-road Expedition, and would probably have use for it, which he (Gunn) would not. Hoagland and Gown had been acquainted before in Salt Lake City, and Hoagland, while taking the weapon without Gunn's consent, promised to return it to him when he should meet him in the Valley. Telling the teamsters to stay where they were and see the trains burn, Smith and his party rode off. When they reached the neighboring heights Smith fired his pistol, at which signal a party of his men, not before visible, rode up and joined him as they moved away from the scene of their villainy.\n\nThe prisoner is a son of the Mormon Bishop of the Eleventh Ward of Salt Lake City. He is a young man 22 or 23 years of age, with sharp features, a narrow, low and receding forehead, with bluish-gray eyes and tow-colored hair. The expression of his face is stolid, betokening a man ready to execute unfalteringly and without questioning the will of a superior intellect to whose influence he had once surrendered himself. Of course he was not without means to employ a lawyer. His counsel at first put in a plea of not guilty, but after the evidence for the prosecution was developed, he withdrew that plea and put in the President's Proclamation, claiming that his client had been guilty of treason -- the lesser crime having been merged in the greater -- and demanding that the accused be set free under the provisions of the pardon offered by Mr. Buchanan for all the seditions and treasons of the past. The Justice anticipating this plea, had consulted Judge Eckels, and at once decided to release the defendant. Thus it will be seen that every species of crime in the past that can be made directly or indirectly a part of the system of outrage perpetrated by the Mormons in opposition to the Government is to be held to be covered by the Proclamation, even though the sufferer is a private citizen, and the property stolen or destroyed is private property. I leave to the legal profession the discussion of the interesting question involved in this connection.\n\nIt is evident that these emissaries of Brigham Young have been schooled into a sentiment of perfect contempt for the authority and the power of the Union. Some of them have behaved in a most impudent and unbecoming manner while here, swaggering about the camp, boasting of their participation in the burning of the supply trains, and describing all the details of their arrangements for the accomplishment of that act of treason, as if it were something to be proud of. Said one, in a group of three of them, speaking to attaches of the camp, \" It's d__d lucky that we are pardoned -- for if we were not, we would burn up the whole d__d army.\" This is a fair specimen of the men upon whom the President of the United States has obtruded \"a full and free pardon\" before they had sued for it, and while they exhale treason in every breath. Nothing but the strict discipline of camp could have saved the scoundrel, whose remark I have quoted, from summary and severe personal chastisement. But his case is not an isolated one. It has its daily counterpart, as often as the \"Saints\" are met with, inside or outside the pickets. As the case stands, the soldiers give vent to their indignation in energetically cursing the insulting traitors, and most religiously damning James Buchanan.\n\nConversing with a bright-eyed, good-looking young Mormon, a day or two ago -- one whose face betokened more of frankness than one could expect of most of his fellows -- I asked him about the outrages upon Gentile merchants and United States officials in the \"Valley.\" He did not attempt to deny, nor offer to excuse them. To him they were evidently perfectly natural and appropriate results. \"If a man comes into the Valley\" said he, \"and minds his own business, he has no trouble; but if he begins to meddle with affairs that don't belong to him, I'll be d__d if he don't get h__l.\" Pressing him as to what he meant by intermeddling, he replied that the Gentiles had offended by writing to the States and to Europe abusive statements in regard to affairs in Utah, or had harbored and attempted to protect persons who had been \"cut off\" from the Church, or had spoken evil of the Prophet, &c. The same complaint applied to the civil officers, who, he declared, with wonderful simplicity, had vexed Brigham Young, and other good men, by official acts or decisions obnoxious to the interests of the Church, and therefore deserving of severest reprehension. \"What else could they expect?\" continued my young expositor. \"If a man comes into this Valley, and lets us alone, he would have no trouble.\" It was the old story of tyranny and oppression, which has been dinned into the ears of the Government and the people of the United States for a year or two, but which seems almost impossible of realization by those who live at a distance from the influence of this accursed Theocracy. The Church finds itself unable to endure free criticism of its faith as exemplified in the lives of its exponents, and so feels justified in resorting to outrage and murder in order to suppress the liberty of speech. A man witnessing the enormities of the Valley, must not \"meddle\" so far even as to write to his friend in New York or Massachusetts or Louisiana, narrating the facts. Neither must he respond to the demands of common charity and give food or shelter to the helpless female who has been turned out to perish in the pitiless winter storm, because she shrinks from the touch of some vulgar \"Saint\" who desires to add her to his polygamic household. Nor must he resist the spoliation of his property when the Church has need of it. Nor venture an appeal to the Courts for redress. All this is \"meddling\" and justly subjects the imprudent perpetrator to the Mormon inquisition and its mysteriously executed penalties. Your Utah correspondence, a year or more ago, presented case after case, each well authenticated, illustrating forcibly the foregoing interpretation of what the Mormon Theocrat means by Gentile meddling. The United States Courts were \"meddling\" when they undertook to assert the rights of the citizen Hockaday, against the interests and the edicts of the Church; and so they were, broken up by violence and dispersed. Surveyor General Burr was meddling when, as the agent of the Government, he undertook to cut wood in the Canons to make land section stakes, and so he was driven from the Territory. Captain Gunnison \"meddled\" when he published to the world his observations of the iniquities of Mormondom, and as a consequence, he was butchered with all his band by Mormon Thugs; and the followers of Brigham Young seem to believe implicitly that in thus punishing \"meddling\" they do nothing deserving reprobation or rebuke. It is to such a people as this that James Buchanan has yielded in such meek submission, flinching from the stern execution of a high duty, and imploring them to accept a pardon, and save him from the labor of hanging them.\n\nA trifling incident, the other day, illustrated the servile subjection to which woman is reduced under the Mormon harrow. Among the party who recently arrived here from Salt Lake, on their way towards the Missouri, was a Frenchman, who, though glad to escape from the tyranny of brother Brigham, was still fast in the faith. He had with him three women, one of whom was his legal wife, and another his mother. The third was a German woman, who having occasion to appeal to the judicial authorities here for aid, presented the following statement, which was confirmed in its essential points by fellow-travelers. The Frenchman, whom she met as a Mormon preacher in St. Louis, made love to her there, and as she was already a convert to the faith, easily persuaded her to go with him to Salt Lake to be \"sealed\" to him as a \"spiritual\" or second wife, promising her that the ceremony should be performed as soon as they came into the presence of the Prophet. This promise he failed to keep, but on arrival in the Valley, he sent his victim out to herd his cattle, which she did all last summer and winter. This spring, when the Frenchman was about to leave the Valley, she insisted upon his taking her back to the States. To this he consented on condition that she should give up her bed and spare clothing to be sold in order to aid in the purchase of the team and necessary supplies for the journey. Accordingly she made over her furniture, and stripped herself of every article of apparel which could be spared without absolute indecency -- the value of which was equal to half the cost of the rickety \"outfit\" in which the party finally started. It seems to have been the fellow's intention to drive her out of his company as soon as possible afterwards by cruelty; and in the trip from the Valley to this point, he compelled her to walk all the way, quarrelling with her and abusing her continually. Arrived here, she determined to join our Camp, where she could find abundant employment as laundress -- and accordingly she took legal measures to obtain a return of her share of the outfit. The District-Attorney and David A. Burr, with myself, proceeded to the he Mormon Camp, and made the demand in her behalf. The fellow did not dispute her story in the least, but put on airs of the most lordly superiority, sneering at the idea of a woman's being able to bring complaint against one of the \"Sons of Zion.\" Until the fact was suggested to him, he had evidently forgotten that he was no longer in a Mormon community, but in one where a woman has rights of her own. As the suggestion dawned upon his mind, his lordly air vanished, and he burst into a vehement passion, applying an opprobrious epithet to the woman, which was instantly resented by one of his own associates, who warned him not to repeat the slander. Finally, under threat of being subjected to suit for the value of his victim's property, and also for wages as a \"herdsman\" he paid up and was permitted to depart.\n\nIt is to be feared that the very enormity of the wrong perpetrated in Mormondom, or under its influence, have rendered the Eastern public Incredulous as to their commission. It is difficult to conceive that humanity can become so debased under the cloak of religious fanaticism. The class of facts which it has been my duty to cite from time to time, illustrative of the practical working and disastrous effects of the Mormon system, have been attested time and again by many living witnesses, speaking from personal knowledge and experience -- witnesses who certainly appear to be honest and reliable, and who are certified as veracious by those who have known them long and well. I have had opportunity to test the accuracy of some of their statements by questioning other parties in reference to facts which they have detailed, and a comparison of notes thus obtained, would seem to afford irrefragable evidence of their truth. Take, for instance, the narrative of Mr. Loba, who the St. Louis Republican thinks \"sold\" your correspondent. I seriously have no fault to find with their incredulity, nor have I any personal interest in having Mr. Loba sustained and indorsed, as I gave his interesting story avowedly upon his own authority, making myself responsible only for his intelligence, his apparent truthfulness, and the reputation for honesty and veracity which he enjoys in the circle of gentlemen in which I found him.\n\nIt is of a good deal of importance to the public, however, that his reliability should be ascertained, so that baseless suspicion of his integrity may not destroy the impression which his startling declarations ought to make upon the public mind -- for, depend upon it, this Mormon question is no trifling, ephemera, issue, but one which is destined to force its importance in upon the future, compelling politicians, statesmen and citizens of all classes, to take earnest, decisive position in regard thereto. I have had frequent opportunities during the last month to learn of Mr. Loba from those who know him -- both Gentiles and seceding Mormons. A"
