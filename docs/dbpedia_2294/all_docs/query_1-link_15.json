        "text": "Vol. XXXIX. Salt Lake City, Utah, Sunday, June 1, 1890. No. 205.\n\nA TRUE STORY OF THE SAINTS.\n\n________\n\nFrom the Empire to the Buckeye State\n\nand Ohio Sojourn.\n\n________\n\nHOW THE SAINTLY ELDERS GOT THERE.\n\n________\n\nWhat They Did and Why They Left --\n\nHigh Jinks in Kirtland -- Great Cry\n\nand Little Wool -- Lights arid Shades\n\nof Latter-Day Life in Early Times --\n\nA Choice Bit of Church History --\n\nYoung Utah, Kise and Read in the\n\nLight of the Present -- Joseph\n\nWas a Daisy, Indeed.\n\n________\n\nEditor Tribune -- In the light of some recent works on the origin and growth of the Mormon Church, notably Bancroft's \"History of Utah,\" and Brother Jenson's most excellent and suggestive \"Historical Record,\" vols. 5-8, called also \"Church Encyclopedia, Book One,\" whereby much new light (and some darkness) has been thrown on an obscure subject, I feel tremendously moved to give to your readers a plain, unvarnished resume of that portion of the Saints' history covered by the period of their sojourn upon Ohio soil. Those seven years, 1831-8, were chock-full of great events; so much so that though Kirtland stands second in chronological order among the six localities which, one after another, furnished a halting place before a final settlement was made in the Great Basin, for important bearings upon the character and growth of the doctrinal and ecclesiastical system it easily stands first and foremost. It was even while on the banks of the east fork of the raging Chagrin river that the late Joseph Smith with at least one eye began to squint.\n\nSTRAIGHT TOWARD CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.\n\nwhile as for almost every other doctrine and practice they got fairly on their feet while the Church center was in Geauga county. When the prophet first touched the Western Reserve he could count but a handful of dupes and co-conspirators, but when he left the number had swelled to 10,000, and a fearfully large sham had been supplied from within the limits of Ohio. So that if western New York is responsible for giving birth to the monster known as Mormonism, to the first commonwealth carved out of the Northwest territory belongs this doubtful honor of supplying shelter and nourishment through all the years of its feeble infancy. And not only is she the proud and glorious mother of presidents, generals and of great men of all sorts, but for many halcyon months she had the only original Yankee Prophet for a citizen; upon her soil was erected the first temple seen upon this Western Continent since the Nephites' day, and a multitude of fine revolutions first sounded out on her air. So it is no common subject to which our attention is turned.\n\nIt will be necessary first, in few words, in order to have a clear understanding of things, to inquire what headway the prophet had already made with his pious plans before he determined to turn his footsteps towards the setting sun, and how he came to fix upon that particular spot on the south shore of Lake Erie for a place of gathering for the elect of these last days. It was in 1820 that this humble but wicked lad behold his first vision, and seven years later when, after considerable sparring on the angel's part and hope deferred on his, he held in his hands the plates so long hid up. The next three or four years were given to bamboozling old Harris and to rendering reformed Egyptian into infamous English. By the early part of 1830, Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James and John, etc., had got in their work for Joseph; the ever great and glorious book had rolled forth from the press, and the church that was a church was \"organized according to the laws of the country.\" And how quickly the first and favored few began to be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth: It was but a few days before in Colesvilie, by the casting out of a devil from Newell Knight a branch blossomed forth, while in September four lusty elders were deputed to herald the gospel to the Lamanites resident upon the remote western border.\n\nMeanwhile other forces were getting themselves put into shape to co-operate in their own due time. For example Alexander Campbell, who had already graduated from Presbyterianism into the Baptist faith, had come so to bristle at every point with innovations and theological novelties as to be cut off, and full of belligerancy had started a new sect. Among the wildest of his followers Sidney Rigdon soon appears, also before a Baptist preacher, and as such in 1826 had been located at Mentor, with Kirtland a few miles to the south for an out-station. Two years later he had become a perfervid disciple and had taken over with him the bulk of his two flocks. Making swift advances he soon out-Heroded Herod, and in the summer of 1830 disputed with Campbell on a radical point of doctrine, was badly beaten and retired crestfallen and sulking to his tent. Then finally, in 1826.\n\nNOTE HOW PREGNANT IS THE PERIOD.\n\nParley P. Pratt, the peerless had emigrated to Northern Ohio and fixed himself in the forest on Black river, thirty miles west of Cleveland. On one of Rigdon's preaching excursions he had caught the ear of this young man and inoculated him thoroughly with Campbellism. But later in a ferment he took to poring over the prophesies and soon, casting away forever the axe and hoe, took also to preaching. Wandering eastward early In 1830, near Rochester he heard of the beautiful Book of Mormon. In a few hours had swallowed it whole from a to izzard and had no rest till he was further baptized. And he was one of the four sent west.\n\nOn their journey reaching the region occupied by Rigdon as a stamping ground, what more natural than to halt for a visit, and calling to tell the sweet story he had but recently heard. He even preached it, and with such cogency that almost the entire company of Sidney's sheep leaped incontinently over the fence into Joseph's pasture. The shepherd himself, as was most meet, held out for a season, but finally, constrained by a vision, he also succumbed, and began to pay his devotions to the rising sun. Yes, he hurried off to New York and for two months was closely closeted with the author and proprietor of the whole precious business. And now, just when all things were thus well prepared for the higera, a loud call comes forth from the skies for the Saints to exchange the Empire for the Buckeye State. That is to say, his neighbors by mobs, lawsuits and the like, and more and more, were informing Joseph of their desire and determination that he should emigrate. But other revelations of like tenor were vouchsafed. The State, and county, and very spot were chosen for him. Ohio was expressly named first in inspired writ since the world began in December of 1830, and in these wonderful words, to wit: \"It is not expedient in me that ye translate (already Joseph and Sidney had their heads together tinkering up the old Bible) until ye shall go to the Ohio.\" \"And again I give a commandment unto the church that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio. Behold, here is wisdom.\" \"Flee to the West,\" was the watchword, and to those who find the promise was \"a blessing such as is not known among the children of men.\" So, under the double impulse of\n\nA PUSH AND A PULL,\n\nthe brethren began to set their houses in order against moving day.\n\nIt was late in January, 1831, that Joseph, Emma and Sidney shook the dust of New York from their feet and proceeded to transfer themselves to Kirtland. The prophet alighting from the sleigh displayed a remarkable prescience when he marched straight up to Brother Whitney, whom he had never seen, but with whom he was to have free quarters, and called him by name. Then, further, within a week he played the seer and revehitor even more handsomely by producing a revelation right practical and to the point. \"It is meet that my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., should have a house built in which to live.\" This is the substance of heaven's first communication to Ohio. And right on the heels of it came this supplement to make it complete: \"If ye desire the mysteries of the Kingdom, provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth.\" And thus timely and shrewdly did this thrifty Yankee look out for the well-being of No. 1.\n\nHaving fenced the wolf from the door in this most neat fashion, our gifted friend turned him with energy to other portions of his prodigious task. Thus he soon found that the ten score or so of the brethren and sisters had been on a prolonged spree, as it were, ever since Parley P. had gathered them in. Or all winter long they had been fairly intoxicated with religious excitement. In their meetings they would shout, and go into fits and spasms, and drop in a swoon as dead. Then they would rush forth wildly and roll, upon the ground, or imitate the speech and gestures of Indians. Would take to the fields and woods, and mounting stones or stumps road characters written upon the sky, or pick up pieces of parchment, bearing \"the seal of Christ.\" For all this they were taken to task and warned to indulge in no madness but such as their new master countenanced. Next the great outside world was taken in hand, for Joseph would be king over many. Sidney and Parley were ordered off on a mission to a troop of Shakers located near Cleveland to persuade thern to trade off Mother Ann for Mother Lucy's son, and armed moreover with a revelation which gave to their heresies\n\nA TERRIBLE WHACK.\n\nAll this powder appears to have been wasted. But not so at all elsewhere. For in various parts of Ohio this first campaign was marvellously successful, and the elders returned bringing many scalps, and some of them belonging to notable heads. Thus down south a few miles in Mantua one May morning they met Ezra Booth, a Methodist preacher, and after arguing with him a while and then clinching their logic by healing a bad case of chronic ailment, he was won teetotally over to the faith. Nor was he in any wise a dumb dog, but presently he crossed over to Hiram to attend a Campbellite meeting where Symond Ryder, of good Mayflower stock and of excellent parts, was holding forth. After sermon Booth asked permission to add a word, and he told of the angel, and the hill, and the plates, and'the peep-stone, and the ex-money-digger to such good purpose that the great preacher and the bulk of his congregation took the oath of allegiance on the spot, and tremendous was the excitement which followed in all that region. Nor was it long after that Lyman Wright laid siege to Cincinnati. In the courthouse he lifted up his voice for a season, then later it became his want to fish in the river by day and preach in private houses by night. And we read that one evening he stood upon a stone for a pulpit, also barefooted and with pants rolled up to his knees, and argued and exhorted for a solid two hours. As a result, before he left the city he had baptised upwards of 100. Thus did the truth prevail. Of such mighty deeds, more anon.\n\nMeantime due preparations were in progress to receive the Saints only awaiting the advent of spring to emigrate from \"the Eastern countries\" to the \"land of Kirtland.\" This timely revelation we trust was duly regarded: \"Inasmuch as ye have lands ye shall impart unto the Eastern brethren, and inasmuch as ye have not lands, let them buy in the regions round about, for (mark it, my brethren) it must needs be necessary that they have places to live.\" In early May the wagons began to roll in. Thus Lucy Smith, the worthy mother of her worthier son, led some eighty souls\n\nTHROUGH THE WILDERNESS\n\nfrom Palmyra, N. Y., via the perilous Erie canal, mostly impecunious and altogether a sorry lot. At Buffalo two other troops, in the aggregate about as large, were met. The harbor was yet frozen solid, and the boat which was to bear this human freight to Fairport, Ohio, was able to make a passage through only after a great crack had been miraculously opened in the ice by the mighty faith and prayers of Lucy! Arriving at length, Joseph, Jr., and Joseph, Sr,, were in waiting and ere long the prophet's parents were comfortably fixed on the church farm. And why should a son of Vermont, even though he have a mission to found and build a religion, leave his relatives to starve? Every resident Saint kept open house and did the best possible to supply shelter and food to the new comers.\n\nIn June a conference was held, the first on Ohio ground in this dispensation, at which 1000 church members could be counted. Now it was that the heavens uttered an order for some twenty of the elders to set forth even to the land of Missouri in search of Zion. Suffice it to say that they went the 1000 miles on foot, Joseph and Sidney among them, actually discovered the\n\nREMAINS OF ANCIENT EDEN\n\nin Jackson county, selected a site for the city and oven laid the corner stone of a temple to be surely built in this generation. Returning after such an elegant summer's work, the prophet for some reason turned his back on Kirtland and left it to languish, honoring Hiram instead with his abode. True, he had a flourishing branch in the latter place, and not a few influential friends. Among thern was a family of Johnsons who came over from the Campbellites with Rev. Ryder, and later Mrs. J. had been snatched from death's door by the hand of Joseph. In return he was offered free board and bed for himself, Emma and the twins, while Rigdon was ensconced hard by. Now they gave themselves to translating again (by inspiration) and also as they had opportunity carrying the gospel into neighboring towns like Ravenna, Shalersville, New Portage and further south. Their efforts were flanked by dozens of other elders who had soon penetrated well nigh every county and township in the State. As a specimen, we hear of their doings in Huron county near 100 miles west from Kirtlarid and, to this extent: In La Porte, Amherst, Clarksfield, Florence, Berlin Heights, where they recruited Brother Milo Andrus, so fierce and in later times as a polygamist and blood-atoner; and New London, where a his log tabernacle was built, and for weeks baptisms went on at the rate of eight or ten a Sunday. So intense and, wide-spread was tho activity of their period that between September 1st and November 30th, eight conferences were held, and\n\nTOUGH STORIES ARE TOLD\n\nhow the preachers swept everything before them. For example, one day Rigdon and Cowdery held an assemblage at Mayfield on the banks of the Chagrin. A curtain V. J. Card, a lawyer hard-headed and skeptical, heard of the circus and from Willoughby rode over. Both had done their best at inviting and warning and then Rigdon. standing in the water, called candidates for baptism. A frenzy of desire seemed to sieze the crowd and thirty or more, one after another, took the mystic plunge beneath the wave. And of a sudden Card was taken with trembling and turned pale, had only strength to call on a companion to take him away by force, and only by the skin of his teeth was he held back from entering the Kingdom! Verily these were great days for Joseph. At a conference held in January, 1832, twenty-four elders were called by name to preach, of whom four were designated to go to the Eastern countries, four to the Southern countries, two to the Western countries, while seven were to ask the Comforter \"whither they should go.\" Next month\n\nA GREAT AND GLORIOUS VISION\n\nwas vouchsafed to Joseph and Sidney in Hiram and so far surpassing anything that even these favorite sons experienced before or after, as to hold in church annals the sole name of \"The vision.\" Chiefly was it that then and there the world celestial, a new continent of truth and being, was discovered. But, alas! in spite of such blissful experiences this brace of seers were yet in this world, and the raging foe was on their track. March 25th the mob set upon them at midnight and on the charge of deviltry in general, dragged them from their beds, insulted and maltreated them without shame, and then finished off with, a coat of tar and feathers. Smith was sufficiently recovered to preach next day, but as for his fellow martyr he was long demoralized and sore both in body and spirit. A trip to Missouri was found convenient and helpful to both.\n\nBut Satan had nob yet hurled the deadliest of his darts. True, in the beginning of 1833 the \"gift of tongues\" was restored to earth after an absence of some eighteen centuries, and by the chosen mouth of Brigham Young, who at his first visit to Kirtand broke out in unknown strains, and was declared by Joseph to have produced a good specimen of the \"pure Adamic\" speech. Further, the Saints were instructed to begin at once to rear a temple on Ohio soil. Brick was to be the material, but the brethren fizzled so fearfully in their attempts to turn out a tolerable article that later the kind Moroni suffered them to substitute stone. Yet again, a plat of Zion in the Far West, most fair to see, was put on paper, with room for inhabitants by the ten thousand, and spots marked for half a score of temples, etc., and was duly forwarded to the front. But, cruel fate! while it was on the way, the bloody Missourians were upon the poor Saints with fire and sword, and rested not till the last soul of them was driven out of Jackson county. For several weeks thereafter our prophet was in sore distress, being unable, even by the help of Urim and Thummim, to learn why this was thus, or how to retrieve\n\nTHIS APPALLING DAMAGE.\n\nBut early in 1834 the nut was splendidly cracked by a revelation which called for the organization of \"Zion's Camp,\" meant, as all the world knows, to inflict withering vengeance on the \"Lord's\" enemies. It is not in place here to speak further of this famous scheme, which to the human eye contains no element save of the purely and stupendously ridiculous, except to point out and emphasize the fact that it holds in history the enviable place of being the only military expedition ever organized in Ohio, or for that matter in North America, by revelation pure and simple, and with a live prophet for general.\n\nAll along the \"school of the prophets\" had been growing in Kirtland, and the elders would tug all winter long to learn to read, spell, write and cipher, and then summers they would tug like beavers to roll forth the kingdom into all quarters from Maine to Mississippi. As for the great, store of converts, they were drawn to the Western Reserve, some to tarry and settle, but for the most part to push on to Clay county, Mo., which was now the chosen seat. The walls of the ternpie in Kirtland were steadily rising, and about them were clustered nearly 2000 Saints. But the demon of apostacy now began to roar his head. Ezra Booth had turned traitor and persecutor, and was\n\nSHOWING UP THE INSIDE\n\nof Mormonism in great shape in the Ravenna _Ohio Star._ Symonds Ryder also fell from the faith, doubt finding its first pointer when in his commission as elder, in the hand-writing of the inspired Joseph a bad botch had been made in the spelling of his name. Dr. P. Hurlburt was another Judas, and he began to investigate the matter of how the \"Book of Mormon was but a reproduction of the Spaulding \"Manuscript Found.\" And to crown all, E. D. Howe, a Painesville editor, put forth his terrible book, \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" and this right under the prophet's nose.\n\nIn 1835 the Quorum of the Twelve was ordained and sent put, and a little later the first quorum of the Seventies, nor did the grass grow under their feet. It was about now that Lorenzo Snow, apparently not knowing what the school of the prophets was able to do towards teaching his young ideas how to shoot, thirsting for knowledge, made his way through the woods to drink at the Oberlin fountain then just bursting forth from the clay. But a few months sufficed, and as he reported to his sister, the late Eliza B., he could find \"neither learning nor religion\" in that college. Turn we next to glance at\n\nA CHARMING EPISODE\n\nin Joseph's life. I refer to the showman Chandler and his four Egyptian mummies, which at his earnest solicitation some of the brethren bought for him, in whose wrappings were found some rolls of papyrus written upon by ancients no loss renowned than Joseph the son of Jacob and Abraham himself, which rolls were duly translated by the prophet, and published, while the cadavers themselves wore long kept on exhibition for so much cash per head. Among the closing events was the lamentable set-to be between, our seer and his brother, William Smith the apostle, in which the former came out second best. Hear him: \"You made towards me, \"I thought to pull off my loose coat, you were too soon for me, my side gave way, and I was rescued from your grasp.\"\n\nMy pen fairly itches to go on through the two remaining years of the Saints sojourn in Ohio, but I must forbear. There was a temple dedication early in 1836, at which Israel\n\nSAW HER BRIGHTEST DAY\n\nAnd the celebrated visit to Salem, Mass., and the revelations relating to great treasures of gold and silver, of which just then there was fearful need, but which somehow utterly failed to reach the prophet's purse. And his return only to find the Church on the very verge of fatal bankruptcy. Of the starting of the bank, opening of the stores, and the purchasing of farms, everybody running head over heels into debt. And the laying out of Kirtland City, a full mile square. And the sudden and savage way their creditors began to sit down upon them from the greatest to the least, and the sheriff and the courts made it hot and lively. And how within the Church the state of things was as bad as outside. And how to save their necks one night in January, 1838, Joseph and Sidney \"fled the scene\" on horseback, and left Ohio for Ohio's good and never more to return. And as a final stroke for Geauga county, how in the June following, Kirtland camp, composed of sixty wagons and 565 souls, took about the last of the Saints in the same direction. But a sad and extensive blight was left behind, and the damage done can be traced in hundreds of communities after fifty years. LEO\n\nNotes: (forthcoming)\n\nVol. XL. Salt Lake City, Utah, Sunday, January 25, 1891. No. 276.\n\nTHE SAINTS WORRIED.\n\n________\n\nThe Illustrated American of New York City is publishing a series of articles on Mormonism. The articles in the main are fair. From some authority the Illustrated American has received its information, and naturally it reaches the conclusion that the Saints have not, in any honest sense, abandoned polygamy. This is offensive to the Saints, but why it should be we cannot see. With them polygamy is a command from God, and all the change that the most enthusiastic Saint pretends has been made, is that the president of the church, as a man, not as God's vicegerent, advises against its present practice. We all know that it was only political pressure that brought around the advice, and when we come to analyse the words they do not advise much.\n\nBut something in the former articles must have stung the Saints deeply, because the News devoted a great deal of space to a reply, and it seems the matter was of so much importance that Apostle Grant and Delegate Caine went to New York to protest and to hint at libel suits. The Illustrated American speaks of the probity of the two gentlemen, says \"their address is candid, frank and engaging,\" all of which we will let pass for what it is worth, only stating that we in Utah know both gentlemen better than does the Illustrated American editor. The article then proceeds as follows:\n\nOn the occasion of their visit to the Illustrated American they were excited. It was natural that they should be excited. They believed that a bitter wrong had been done to them and their church, and they used such words as \"lies\" and \"liars\" with a freedom bred of those traditions of plain speech left by Brigham Young to the Mormon community.\n\nApart from these flowers of language, the following is the substance of the conversation that passed between these gentlemen and the Illustrated American:\n\n\"We have called,\" said Mr. Caine, \"to protest in a most vigorous tone against the articles on Mormonism which you are now publishing.\"\n\n\"Are they not true?\" asked the Illustrated American\n\n\"They are such a mixture of truth and falsehood,\" replied the Delegate, \"that they are infinitely more dangerous than a mere parcel of lies. I was in Washington when the first publication was made, and went from one newsdealer to another to buy your paper. So great had been the demand for it that the Washington edition was exhausted, and I had to make a long search before I could buy the copy which I have in my hand. Armed with it I came to New York, and, as you see, I have marked with a pencil those of its statements which we repudiate.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Illustrated American, \"the article is headed by a quotation from the message of President Harrison. Your grievance, if any, lies not against us, but against the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Caine, \"you know what the President is! You know what church he belongs to. We cannot be responsible for what President Harrison believes or says about us.\"\n\nWith this summary dismissal of President Harrison, Mr. Caine went on to attack Judge C. C. Goodwin, whose article in Harper's Magazine was quoted on the same page. His attack was purely personal. He said that the readers of The Salt Lake Tribune, which is edited by Judge Goodwin, bought it because it was a good newspaper, not because they put faith in Judge Goodwin's editorial utterances. As to Mr. Goodwin's criticisms of Mormonism, and his disbelief in the abandonment of polygamy, \"they are simply set down as Tribune lies, said Mr. Caine.\"\n\n\"But,\" urged the Illustrated American, \"are not all recent writers on Mormonism in accord with Judge Goodwin?\"\n\n\"They are either missionaries or members of a hostile church,\" said Mr. Caine, heartily supported in this statement by Mr. Grant. Indeed, nothing in this interview was more remarkable than the attitude of the envoys toward all other churches than the Mormon Church. Whatever comments appeared upon their community they instantly attributed to the machinations of rival sects. The whole matter was to them a feud of religion.\n\n\"President Woodruff,\" continued the Congressman, has lately made this declaration:\n\nInasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I do hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws and to use all my influence with the members of the church over which I preside to have them do likewise.\n\n\"This would be excellent testimony,\" said the Illustrated American, \"if we had not the best possible authority from Utah for saying that it is merely a feint.\"\n\n\"Your authority is the 'Old Mormon,'\" said Mr. Caine, \"and I don't hesitate to assert that the 'Old Mormon' is a myth. I don't believe that there exists such a person.\"\n\nThe similitude of Mrs. Prig's remarks about Mrs. Harris was so great that it provoked an involuntary smile.\n\n\"This may be fun to you,\" said the Delegate, \"but it is death to us. I tell you that no Mormon, young or old, would dare to make such assertions as this imaginary Mormon makes. The discipline of our church is stronger than you may fancy.\"\n\nMr. Caine went into detail in support of this theory that the \"Old Mormon\" did not exist. He found in the \"Old Mormon's\" story these statements: \"I was arrested with Joseph Smith.\" \"I put my head out of the window of the jail.\" \"I expected to be shot the next moment.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Mr. Cain,\" there was nobody arrested with Joseph Smith except his brother. There was nobody in jail.\"\n\nFor a decision of this point we refer our readers to Colnel Hay's account of the killing of Joseph Smith; to the story of \"Early Mormon Days,\" recently published by Charles Scribners Sons; and to any standard work on the subject.\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Grant, \"this old Mormon asserts that George A. Smith rode on a fleet horse ahead of the emigrant train which was massacred in Mountain Meadows. Are you aware that Smith was a man weighing 290 pounds, and could hardly have found a horse to carry him?\"\n\nHere we refer our readers to a graphic account of the Mountain Meadows massacre published many years ago by the Chicago Tribune. the correctness of its facts has never been disputed. Mr. George A. Smith's adiposity may have increased in later years, but, as the \"Old Mormon\" remembers him, he was capable of riding fleet horses.\n\nAnd that was absolutely all the evidence by which Messrs. Caine and Grant supported their very serious accusation that the \"Old Mormon\" did not exist -- an accusation which is likely to offend him deeply.\n\n\"The truth of the matter,\" continued Mr. Caine, \"is that, in spite of all that we assert, nobody believes that we have abandoned polygamy. The President does not believe it. The Utah Commission does not believe it. I appeared before the Utah Comission. They told me that they had the proof of forty-two polygamous marriages recently contracted. Said I, 'Gentlemen, produce your proof.' They have not produced it yet. They cannot produce it. Why? They have no proof.\"\n\n\"No proof whatever,\" echoed Mr. Grant.\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Caine, \"your publication will be read by a hundred people to one who will see the report of the Utah Commission. We have a right to reputation. We demand it.\"\n\n\"You must not demand anything with threats,\" said the Illustrated American. \"We are publishing these articles after long deliberation and investigation. We stand ready to support them in a court of law.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Caine, \"we make no threats: we will consider what course to take. What we want you to print is, that we deny that polygamy has not been actually abandoned; we deny that any policy of deception is being counseled; we deny that Brigham Young or any Mormons in authority aided or abetted the Mountain Meadows massacre; we deny that the Mormons mean to go to war with the Unoted States; and we deny that they have any intention of leaving Utah and emigrating to Mexico. Will you publish these denials?\"\n\n\"We will publish them with pleasure,\" said the Illustrated American, as its Mormon visitors rose to go.\n\nAnd we here keep our word. We repeat that Messrs Caine and Grant are men of the highest standing in the Mormon community, and would impress any listener, however skeptical, by their air of sincerity and by their enthusiasm for the creed to which they place their trust.\n\nAt the same time we cannot agree with the New York Sun, which, in an editorial published after the visit of Messrs Caine and Grant, sums up their views under the title, \"Is Mormon Polygamy Ended?\" The Sun believes that Governor Thomas of Utah and Judge Zane of that Territory, will support it in the belief that plural marriages are \"buried, never to be resurrected.\"\n\n\"There is ground for believing,\" cries the Sun, glowingly, \"that the last of avowedly polygamous marriages in Utah has already ocurred. Civilization has conquered.\"\n\nThe report of the Utah Commission, we believe, will show a different state of things. Governor Thomas and Judge Zane, we are sure, will be found less hopeful than the Sun imagines. The Mormon problem was never so bodly tangled as now.\n\nAnd, while waiting for the unraveling of its complications, the Illustrated American merely wishes to say that it will gladly respond to any libel suit which the Mormon Church wishes to bring against it.\n\nThe Saints will not sue the Illustrated American. That is all a bluff. For months they have been bluffing about their strength, but they dare not make a test case to be fairly tried in court.\n\nNote: The Salt Lake Herald, Deseret News, and Salt Lake Times all responded to this article in the Tribune, with caustic comments. History would show the Illustrated American to have been maliciously wrong or artfully misguided in several of its 1890-91 assertions against the Mormons. However, since LDS plural marriages did continue in secret, for several years after Woodruff's \"manifesto,\" that magazine proved to be more or less correct in its published disbelief on that particular subject. For the official LDS reply to the magazine, see President Woodruff's Jan. 9, 1891 letter.\n\nVol. XLIV. Salt Lake City, Utah, Sunday, June 26, 1894. No. 57.\n\nANNIVERSARY OF CARTHAGE.\n\n________\n\nThe Assassination of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.\n\n________\n\nIT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO.\n\n________\n\nConditions Under Which the People Then Lived -- Nauvoo's Promise of\n\nBecoming a Great Metropolis -- Talks With Catherine Salisbury, Sister\n\nof Joseph and Hyrum -- Lucy Smith's \"History of Joseph Smith.\"\n\n________\n\nCorrespondence Tribune.\n\nCarthage, Ill., June 22, 1894.\n\nOn the 27th of this month, next Wednesday, occurs the fiftieth anniversary of the massacre of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the Mormon prophets, at the old stone jail in this city. The old jail still stands, but has been greatly beautified both externally and internally by its present owners and occupants, Mr. and Mrs. James M. Browning. However, this anniversary will hardly be celebrated here, unless a few curious visitors beg admission to the residence to view the dark stains upon the oaken floor and bullet marks in the casements and windows of the upper hallway and room where Joseph and Hyrum Smith were shot to death, and where John Taylor, late president of the Mormon Church was wounded.\n\nThe story of the massacre is familiar to all who have made any sort of a study of the history of Illinois. Mrs. Browning, who is so gracious to all visitors, says that it is surprising how many different versions of the story of the tragedy are rife. She has heard the story told in more than a dozen different ways, and by some Mormons themselves who it is thought, should be better posted. It is not infrequently the case that small delegations from Salt Lake visit the old jail. Not long since a band of Mormons came to the Browning home and begged that they might see the interior of the historic pile. All reputable people are admitted to the building if they ask the permission. This little band of Mormons moved about the sacred old building, and, as they gazed upon the dark, rusty stains where the life blood of Joseph, the martyr, poured out, their tears streamed softly down their cheeks. Some came to beg a leaf or a flower and get a handful of earth from the place where stands the old jail. It is a historic shrine -- the shrine of the martyred prophet.\n\nThe Mormons came to Illinois from Missouri in about 1839. They selected a site -- the present location of Nauvoo -- on the banks of the Mississippi river, and here began the erection of buildings for homes, workshops, tithing-houses and, greatest of all, a magnificent temple that cost a million of dollars in money and labor. Nauvoo bade fair to become the leading city of the West. In 1844 she was a city of nearly 30,000 inhabitants. Joseph Smith had issued an edict that all Mormons from all parts of the world, should come to Nauvoo, making this spot the last place -- the new Zion -- where the work of the last days should begin. In answer to this call the faithful began to stream into the city. The Gentiles, so-called, the general populace of Hancock county, became alarmed at the growing religious and political strength of the Mormons, and, as the Mormons charge, became intensely jealous of the material, political and religious progress of the Saints. There can be no doubt that the Illinois Legislature, of which William Smith, a brother of the prophet, was a member by suffrage of Mormon votes, granted unconstitutional charter to the Mormons. Under these special acts it is claimed that Smith and his leaders did a great many illegal things. The culmination of all the trouble, however, was the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor office by order of Mayor Joseph Smith, at Nauvoo, some time about the middle of June, 1844. This led to Smith's arrest. Francis and Joseph Higbee and others had renounced Smith and started the Expositor. But one copy was issued, but it bristled with assaults upon Smith and the Mormons. Its publication was ordered to be suppressed by the City Council of Nauvoo, and the press and type were broken and thrown into the river. It is said that the press has since been on exhibition in Chicago, but it is doubtful whether the parts were ever rescued from the bosom of the father of waters.\" Joseph and Hyrum Smith, John Taylor and a Mr. Richards were arrested and taken to the jail in Carthage. They were treated with considerable condescension by Jailer Walker Stigall, and were placed in a large suite in the upper story, known as the debtors' room. Smith had prophesied his death, and evidently he expected trouble, for when the mob did come, about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of June 27th, 1844, he fired into them several times with an old-fashioned \"pepper-box\" revolver, wounding two or three of the assailants. The mob was composed of men who wore disguises and who did their work quickly. A detail of local military organization called the \"Carthage Grays\" were stationed about the jail, but they \"stood in\" with the mob. Their guns were loaded with only powder and wadding. After discharging their rifles the \"guards\" ran away and joined the other citizens in leaving the town deserted. Old Artois Hamilton and a few other brave souls remained. Hamilton cared for the dead, and also saw that John Taylor's wounds were dressed. He took the bodies of the Smiths to Nauvoo the following day, where in a short address, he turned them over to the sorrowing people.\n\n(view larger version of this engraving)\n\nFew witnesses to that tragedy now survive. The recent death of Judge Thomas Coke Sharpe, editor of the Carthage Gazette, removed one of the defendants charged with the killing. He and all indicted by the grand jury for the murder were acquited on trial. There lives near Fountain Green, in this county, Mrs. Catherine Salisbury, a sister of the prophet Joseph Smith. She resides with her son Fred Salisbury, who is a farmer of that section. Mother Salisbury, as she is known, is now 82 years old, and has a remarkable memory. She resembles her noted brother very little save in stature. Her chief resemblance is to her brother's son, the present Joseph Smith, president of the Mormon Church at Lamoni, Ia.\n\nA visit to this country home recently found the good lady at leisure, and as ever, in a kindly mood to welcome visitors. She said: \"Some of the newspaper men have not always treated us right in their stories of Mormon times. And then there have been historians who have misquoted facts, whether by accident or design I know not, but the facts were sadly at variance. All we aks is justice. We are not ashamed of our church, its teachings or its history. We have nothing to conceal.\"\n\nMother Salisbury says she came to Illinois in 1838, a short time prior to the general hegira of Mormons from Missouri into Illinois. Joseph was in bondage in Missouri, and the Mormons first came to Quincy. As soon as Joseph was liberated the people settled at Nauvoo. Mrs. Salisbury says their family, however, located near the present site of Macomb. She was married to Wilkins J. Salisbury June 8, 1831, and moved with him to this State, afterwards locating at Plymouth, in this county. She frequently visited Nauvoo during the Mormon ascendency. Her brothers were very good to her, and every time there was a grand fete or a religious gathering of unusual importance, they sent for Sister Catherine. \"I was in Nauvoo a few days before my brothers were brought to Carthage, where they met their death. I shall never forget that Saturday, June 23, 1844, when I last saw my brothers alive. Joseph had preached a sermon to the largest crowd I have ever seen. It was his last sermon. I might say that it was more in the nature of a prophecy than a sermon, for he said, turning on the platform where he stood and facing some of the high priests and Elders sitting there: 'There are those among you who will betray me soon; in fact, you have plotted to deliver me up to the enemy to be slain.' The truth of this prophecy is of history. He was betrayed, and by his own alleged best friends. These same fellows attempted to assume the reigns of the church at his death. They not only attempted this, but they attempted to introduce obnoxious teachings into the church. My nephew, the present Joseph Smith, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints at Lamoni, Ia., is the true and only successor of Joseph Smith, the martyr.\n\n\"I returned to my home that Saturday evening and I shall never forget the parting with Joseph and Hyrum. That picture you hold in your hand shows how Joseph and Hyrum were dressed as they bade me good-bye. Joseph took my hands tenderly in his, saying: 'Good-bye, Sister Catherine. When this trouble blows over I will come down to Plymouth and make you a visit.' Hyrum said 'Good-bye,' simply, but with a deeper feeling than I had ever known him to entertain. It was my farewell to them on this earth.\"\n\nMother Salisbury says that the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum Smith lie buried in the old family burying lot near the Mansion house in Nauvoo. \"There was a price set on Joseph's head, and we concealed the bodies for a day and a night. Then we buried them near the old home. There was no secrecy about their resting place. When 'Aunt Emma' Smith, who later was Mrs. Major C. L. [sic. - L. C.?] Bidamon died, her six nephews buried her near the brick vault where rest the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum. The story that the bodies were taken to Salt Lake is without foundation.\"\n\nMother Salisbury very kindly exhibited a number of photographs of her family to the visitor, and loaned him a book, \"The History of Joseph Smith,\" written by the Prophet's mother, Lucy Smith. It gives a detailed account of the origin of the families on both sides, and the genealogy of the families is arranged in a methodical order. She pays a high tribute to Joseph, whom she gives a most excellent and Christian character. She refers to his fortitude in withstanding pain under the surgeon's knife. That she believed her son to be inspired of God, and that his religion and all his acts were authorized from on high, appears upon the very face of the book. She indulges in scathing criticism of the civil authorities of Illinois and Missouri in their alleged failure to hear the appeals of a persecuted and downtridden people. Her story of the murder of her two sons is pathetic in the extreme.\n\nOutside of Nauvoo few landmarks of Mormonism remain in this county. At Webster and Fountain Green, in the vicinity of Mother Salisbury's home, there are yet evidences of the Mormon settlements established there when those people first came to Illinois. The old jail at Carthage and a little old brick house near by are about the only landmarks left of the Mormon era, so far as Carthage is concerned.\n\nDespite the fact that the tragedy occurred fifty years ago, public interest in the story has not grown old, nor will it ever grow old. It is like \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" in that the ever rising generation will want to hear the story, and, if possible, visit Nauvoo and the old jail at Carthage.\n\nThere are few if any Mormons of the old school in this county. The representatives of the Lamoni Church, however, are very numerous, and they have several meeting-houses. These people are among the best citizens of the county. GAY DAVIDSON.\n\nNote 1: For record of other interviews with Catherine Smith Salisbury, see the Lamoni, Iowa Saints' Herald of May 6, 1993, The Carthage Republican of May 16, 1894, and the The Kansas City Times of Apr. 11, 1895. The May 16, 1894 interview record is very similar to the June 24, 1894 Tribune text, but does not include Catherine's allegation that her brothers were murdered according to the secret plans of \"his own alleged best friends,\" (who could only be those members of the Council of the Twelve who remained loyal to Brigham Young).\n\nNote 2: Compare Mr. Davidson's quotation from Mrs. Salisbury, as published in the the Quincy Whig of June 24, 1894, with the lengthier version from the Tribune of the same date --- Whig text: \"as he finished he turned to several of the church dignitaries who were seated on the platform behind him and told them that there were among them those who had conspired to deliver him up to the enemy.\" --- Tribune text: \"turning on the platform where he stood and facing some of the high priests and Elders sitting there: 'There are those among you who will betray me soon; in fact, you have plotted to deliver me up to the enemy to be slain.' The truth of this prophecy is of history. He was betrayed, and by his own alleged best friends. These same fellows attempted to assume the reigns of the church at his death. They not only attempted this, but they attempted to introduce obnoxious teachings into the church....\" --- Carthage Republican text: \"Brother Joseph said that there was seated on the speaker's stand beside him those who were conspiring to take his life, and who would be responsible for his death.\"\n\nNote 3: The journalist conducting the May, 1894 interview with the Salisbury family at Fountain Green, Illinois, was Isham Gaylord Davidson (1860-1956), the son of the managing editor of the Carthage Republican.

No. 220.\n\nELDER ROBERTS'S CHALLENGE\n\nCONCERNING THE\n\nBOOK OF MORMON.\n\n________\n\nEditor Tribune: -- According to the newspaper reports, Elder B. H. Roberts, in his Tabernacle address Sunday, November 5th, threw out a sweeping challenge to the world to show that the Book of Mormon is not of divine origin and authority.\n\nSince Elder Roberts, on the occasion above referred to, confined his attention mainly to the writings of the alleged Prophet Nephi, we will do the same. Now the following are some of the difficulties Elder Roberts will have to explain before he can make any headway toward setting aside the intelligent belief of the American people generally that the Book of Mormon in general and the books of Nephi in particular are fictitious books:\n\nTHE \"PROPHET\" NEPHI.\n\n1. The alleged Prophet Nephi claims to have lived and written between 500 and 600 B. C. For he tells us in chapter 1 and 10 of the first book that his father was living in Jerusalem in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which reign began not far from 600 B. C. This professed prophet Nephi pretends to give a summary of the records made by his father Lehi, about that date, and also \"an account of my proceedings in my days.\" Now the first difficulty for Elder Roberts to remove is this: How could a writer, claiming to live at that time, make repeated quotations from the writings of Christ's Apostles, who were not born until nearly 600 years after the time when Nephi wrote? Yet this pretended prophet Nephi quotes passage after passage from the writings of Christ's apostles Matthew and John and Paul, and also from the writings of the evangelist Luke, and from the words of the Apostle Peter, which Christian writers were born about the beginning of the Christian era. Just take two or three examples of Nephi's quotations, made at least 500 years before the writers were born from whom he quotes: In I Nephi x: 8, we read these words, so familiar to English Bible readers: \"Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\" This is a direct quotation from the gospel of John 1: 26-7, and also from Matthew 3:1.\n\nOn the same page in Nephi are several quotations from the writings of Paul, in the 11th of Romans, about the olive tree, and the \"branches broken off,\" with others \"grafted in.\" In I Nephi 3: 20 we find the expression, \"which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets * * * since the world began.\" These are the words of Peter as recorded by Luke in Acts 3:31. The above is an illustration of the way in which this alleged Prophet Nephi quotes from the writers of the New Testament. This is fraud No. 1, exposing the false claims of Nephi, who pretends to write between 500 and 600 years B. C. and yet quotes from the New Testament writers who were \"not born until over 500 years later. The Old Testament prophets were genuine. They did, by the help of God, foretell many important future events. But none of them pretended to be able, either by the help of God, or their own agility, to quote passage after passage from writings that did not exist, and from authors that had not been born. It remained for the favorite prophet of Elder B. H. Roberts, the robust and agile Nephi, to perform this feat, beyond the reach of God's genuine prophets.\n\nQUOTES FROM SHAKESPEARE.\n\n2. This alleged Prophet Nephi, pretending to write between 500 and 600 B. C., actually quotes from Shakespeare! This beats the genuine prophets of the Old Testament even worse than before, and shows that, on a prophetic long jump, this elastic Nephi could easily take the cake. In II Nephi 1:14, he is writing down the words of his father Lehi, and represents him as saying, \"hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent gave, from whence no traveler can return.\"\n\nEvery reader of Shakespeare will recognize the last phrase as taken, in substance, from a sentence in Hamlet's soliloquy. This great Prophet Nephi (writing, be it remembered, between 500 and 600 B. C.) had probably loaned his copy of Shakespeare to a neighbor and attempted to quote from memory, getting about as near the original as the average Mormon prophet generally does, for example, when attempting to quote the scriptures from memory. Here is fraud No. 2 perpetrated by this pretended prophet Nephi, from which Elder Roberts must vindicate his hero, or else leave us to conclude, as facts seem to show, that the writer of these books of Nephi was quite a modern deceiver.\n\n3. This brings us to another serious difficulty which we ask Elder Roberts to elucidate before we can accept his theory that Nephi was a prophet of God, and that the book of Mormon is a divine revelation. This alleged Prophet Nephi, professing to write between 500 and 600 B. C, quotes many long passages from a book which did not come into existence until the seventeenth century of the Christian era. We refer to the King James English version of the Bible, which was first published in 1611 A. D. Now, perhaps Elder Roberts can tell us how this fellow Nephi, pretending to write in the sixth century before Christ, could quote hundreds of passages, about three hundred, from the New Testament alone, and whole chapters from our English version of the Bible, which did not come into existence for more than 2000 years after he wrote!\n\nThis stuffed Prophet Nephi gives himself completely away in the very first chapter, and shows that he is a very modern writer by using such well-known expressions as these from our English Bible: \"Pillar of fire,\" Ex. 14:24; \"Filled with the spirit,\" Ephesians 5:18; \"Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty,\" Rev. 15:3. These hundreds of passages, and these whole chapters in II Nephi and elsewhere, from our English Bible, be it observed, are quoted not from the original, which would not help the matter, for the original of the New Testament did not exist; but they are quoted from the English translation of 1611, mistakes and all, even to the filling in of the peculiar gaps in the way suggested by the English translators.\n\nNow, these hundreds of verbatim quotations, and these whole chapters from our English Bible, which claim to be quoted over 2000 years before it was written, should make it quite clear, even to the average mind, that this pretended Nephi instead of being an ancient prophet was a very modern one, a pious deceiver and falsifier, living about 1829 of our era. But, perhaps, Elder Roberts can explain it all, and show us how this modern deceiver in the nineteenth century was an ancient prophet of God 600 B. C.\n\nGIVES HIMSELF AWAY.\n\n4. This alleged Prophet Nephi gives himself away even worse in the 31st chapter of the second book by forgetting that he was pretending to write in the sixth century before Christ and treating the baptism of Christ as actual history, which it really was. He not only refers to it in the past tense, but actually indulges in a regular campmeeting exhortation to the \"brethren,\" exhorting them, in accordance with the revival style of 1828, to \"repent of their sins,\" and \"follow their Lord and Savior down into the water,\" promising that after that they shall have \"the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nThis is deception No. 4, and shows that Sidney Rigdon Nephi, in 1828, forgetting that he was an ancient prophet living six centuries before Christ, broke loose in his regular old camp-meeting style, and just \"whooped up\" the brethren, without his deceiver's mask. Nephi, a divinely inspired prophet of God! Holy Moses, preserve us! If Nephi, with the above record, or the godless fellow who personated him, deserves honor as a prophet, then great injustice was done to Boss Tweed in not electing him President of the American Bible Society. For clearly he had more religion than this alleged Prophet Nephi with his conscienceless deception in connection with sacred things.\n\nCome, Brother Roberts, if you can't back up that other alleged prophet, Joseph Smith, with something more substantial, something less imaginary and fictitious than these pretended prophetic writings of Nephi, from which we have been quoting, then you better drop Nephi as a prophet and fall back on Coriantumr, Shiz or Robinson Crusoe.\n\nWHAT IS NEW IN IT?\n\n5. If the Book of Mormon, as Elder Roberts claims, is a revelation from God, what moral or religious truth does it reveal which we did not know before? Not one item. If Elder Roberts will point me to one solitary item of moral or spiritual truth in the whole Book of Mormon which it did not take, directly or indirectly, from the Bible, I will present him with a five-dollar Stetson hat. I know it cannot be done, for it has been attempted in vain again and again. What sense is there in calling the Book of Mormon a revelation from God, when it took from the Bible the only moral truth it contains, and is shown on its face to be a counterfeit book?\n\nNow, a few words about the pretended prophecies of the wonderful Nephi, which Elder Roberts claims have been fulfilled. Here is the way in which prophecies are made and fulfilled in the Book of Mormon: It either takes the historic record in the New Testament, using the very words of Scripture, tries to push this history back hundreds of years and then falsely claims it to be prophetic; or else it deliberately appropriates the genuine prophecies of the Old Testament. Then, after mutilating these prophecies more or less, with its peculiar Sidney Rigdon phraseology and most abominable grammar, it attempts to palm off these prophecies as original! The prophecy about the restoration of the Jews to their own land, which Elder Roberts quotes from second Nephi, and thinks is so wonderful, is simply a case of downright plagiarism. The conversion of the Jews and their restoration to their own land is repeatedly foretold by the Old Testament prophets, in such passages as Jeremiah 30:3; Ezek. 37:21; Amos 9:15, and others. Yet the writer of this book of Nephi does not hesitate to take these prophecies from the Bible, modify their language, and then try to palm them off as his own.\n\nAs for the two pretended prophecies referred to by Mr. Roberts, in II Nephi 30:3, that \"Many shall believe the words which are written,\" and that \"They shall carry them forth to the remnant of our seed,\" the first is not a prophecy at all, but the simple statement of a well-known historical fact, yet perverted by the attempt to make it bolster up this modern book. In saying that it is the statement of a historical fact, we mean this: The Book of Mormon, as shown above, is made up of hundreds upon hundreds of Bible phrases and verses, and many whole chapters taken from our English Bible. As a matter of course, these Bible quotations which form such a large per cent of the Book of Mormon, are accepted and believed by the 400 millions who make up Christendom.\n\nThe other passage Mr. Roberts misreads and misinterprets by making \"the remnant of our seed\" refer to the Lamanites. Then he assumes, without one item of proof, that the Lamanites are the same as our Indians. According to Nephi, the Lamanites were the decendants of his brother Laman, and were consequently Jews, for Laman was a Jew. Now Ridpath, the American historian, in the second paragraph of his history of the United States, sums up the evidence concerning the connection between the Indians and the Jews in this one sentence: \"The notion that the Indians are descendants of the Israelites is absurd.\"\n\nJUMBLES HISTORY.\n\nFuthermore, the writer of the book of Nephi jumbles up his own history and contradicts himself in appearing to make \"the remnant of our seed\" refer to the Lamanites, as in Nephi 30:6. Nephi writes as a Jew, and his seed or the \"remnant\" of it, will inevitably be Jews and Nephites, and not Lamanites. The latter descended from Laman and not from Nephi, and hence could not be the \"remnant\" of Nephi.\n\nBut what is the use of talking seriously about the Nephites and the Lamanites when no such people ever existed in this country except in the wild imagination of the writer of a piece of fictitious stuff, out of which this Book of Mormon was manufactured. The Nephites and Lamanites never had one whit more reality than the peculiar inhabitants of the famous island of Lilliput, as described by that model Mormon historian, Lemuel Gulliver, whom Dean Swift portrays.\n\nNOT AN ANCIENT BOOK.\n\nAbundant proof has been given above that the Book of Mormon is not an ancient, but a very modern book, and not only a modern book, but a modern imposition by pretending to be an ancient book and revelation from God, when it reveals nothing in the way of moral truth which it did not steal from the Bible.\n\nWe are sorry to see a man of Mr. Roberts' ability fooling away his time and thought in the useless attempt to bolster up as a divine revelation that which the intelligent reading millions of the American people are persuaded is fabrication. If the fact that 200,000 people, more or less, believe in the Book of Mormon, proves that a false book is a true one, then Mrs. Eddy's book far outranks the Book of Mormon in merit, for her book has a million supporters. But Mr. Roberts is correct in one statement, namely: that it the Book of Mormon is a false book, then it would follow that \"the great prophet of the Latter-day movement is a fraud.\" Well, if there is any one fact which is generally accepted and believed by the reading, thinking millions of this country, without regard to party or creed, it is that Joseph Smith was not a prophet. And they believe this because of the abundant and varied evidence in regard to his life and conduct.\n\nIf Mr. Roberts is really in earnest in desiring to know the actual origin of the Book of Mormon, the character of the men who manufactured it and the kind of pretenders they were, socially and morally, let him read the first eleven chapters of the \"Origin and Progress of Mormonism,\" by that well-informed and reilable historian, Pomeroy Tucker of Palmyra, New York. He was well acquainted with Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery and other Mormon leaders of that early time, and was for a dozen years near neighbor to the founder of Mormonism and all his family. Mr. Tucker was the editor and proprietor of the Wayne Sentinel, on whose press the first edition of the Book of Mormon was printed, Mr. Tucker himself correcting the proof sheets. His book was published by D. Appleton & Co., New York, in 1867. Mr. Tucker sets forth the character of the false prophet and those associated with the latter at that time from personal acquaintance and knowledge, and his book has been generally accepted as thoroughly honest and reliable.\n\nTHE DILEMMA.\n\nNow if Mr. Roberts can read the facts as set forth in Mr. Tucker's book, which have been confirmed by scores of reliable witnesses also acquainted with the facts, and still stand up in public and declare it to be his belief that Nephi was a prophet of God and the Book of Mormon is a revelation from God, he will force the general public to conclude rather that he is not a sincere man, or else that his peculiar training prevents him from distinguishing between true reasoning and false, between facts and fiction, between honesty and fraud, between true revelation and that which is counterfeit. Because the facts in Mr. Tucker's book, confirmed by scores of witnesses of worthy character, have been amply sufficient to convince the reading, thinking, truth-loving millions of the American people generally that the Book of Mormon is fiction in pretending that a part of it was written 2400 and the rest 1500 years ago, when the proof that it is a modern book is shown on almost every page. The facts in Mr. Tucker's book have also convinced the American people generally that the alleged prophet was not a prophet.\n\nThe above has been written with entire good will, in the interests of truth and historic facts. And when Mr. Roberts squarely meets the above difficulties, contradictions and absurdities in the Book of Mormon, not by wordy evasion and logical hair-splitting, however ingenius, but in a way that shall be satisfactory not only to his own mind but also to intelligent, reasoning, truth-loving minds generally, then perhaps he will be entitled to issue another sweeping challenge in behalf of a book which the American people generally, without regard to party or creed, believe to be a fabrication.

No. 227\n\nELDER ROBERTS'S REPLY\n\nTO CRITICISM ON THE\n\nBOOK OF MORMON.\n\n________\n\nEditor Tribune: -- If any words of mine in the remarks made in the Tabernacle on the 8th of November could be construed into a \"challenge\" to a public discussion of the Book of Mormon -- as the writers of headlines on some of the morning papers seem to think they could be -- when the challenge was accepted, the courtesy of debate would certainly require that the acceptance of the challenge should be otherwise than from ambush. I mean that I am entitled to know the name of my opponent, that I may judge somewhat of his character and standing. And why should the gentleman remain in cog? Is he ashamed to be known as engaging in such a discussion? Or is it a precaution he takes so that if his argument does not rise to the expectation of his friends, he may remain unknown behind the mystery of a single initial. If the first supposition be true, it is a difficulty he could easily have avoided; if the second suggestion be the true reason for his remaining unknown, he is to be commended for his cunning. I need say nothing of his courage.\n\nAS EXPECTED.\n\nWhen on Saturday my attention was called to the editorial announcement that the alleged \"challenge\" had been accepted, and an article against the Book of Mormon would appear in The Tribune's Sunday issue, I remarked to a friend that I thought I could write an answer to the much-heralded article without seeing it; and when on Sunday I read the Unknown's production I felt I had not been overconfident in the assertion, so closely has he followed in the well-beaten, not to say worn out, path of anti-Mormon argument. What a world of trouble Alexander Campbell would have saved many inferior disputants had he only stereotyped the objections he urged against the Book of Mormon in 1831! They then could have pointed to his utterances and said: \"Them's my arguments.\" For from the days of Mr. Campbell until now, anti-Mormon geniuses have but rehashed the great man's arguments, with a uniform decadence in their strength, in proportion to the distance in time from which they are removed from him who first fashioned them. But now to the Unknown's \"arguments.\"\n\nTHE TIME OF WRITING.\n\n1. The Unknown states the fact that Nephi wrote between 600 and 500 B. C. and then presents what he calls the first difficulty that I am to overcome. \"How can a writer,\" he asks, \"claiming to live at that time make repeated quotations from the writings of Christ's Apostles who were not born until 600 years after the time when Nephi wrote? He then charges that Nephi quotes \"passage after passage\" from the writings of Christ's apostles, Matthew, John, Paul, Luke, Peter, etc.; and gives what he calls just \"two or three examples\" of such quotations. The gentleman very much overstates the difficulty he presents, by making it appear that the alleged quotations are very numerous, when the fact is that the two or three cases he cites virtually exhaust the alleged quoted passages so far as the New Testament is concerned. In order that your readers may see how flimsy the charge here made is, I set down the quotations in question, (a) Nephi, describing his father's vision of the future coming of the Messiah, says: \"And he spake also concerning a prophet who should come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord; yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness, 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much spake my father concerning this thing.\" To make this appear as a plagiarism from the New Testament the Unknown puts together two passages: (1) \"I baptize with water; but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; he it is, who, coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose,\" (John 1:26, 27). (2) \"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea\" (Matthew 3.) Of course, the story of the man who said he could prove that the Bible commanded every one to hang himself may be commonplace; but it illustrates the methods of the Unknown in making out his case of plagiariasm. The proof was supplied in this way: He quoted the passage, \"and Judas went out and hanged himself.\" Then from another passage, from another book, he quoted these words, \"Go thou and do likewise.\" It must be remembered that the Nephites carried with them into the wilderness the Jewish scriptures, and Lehi was doubtless familiar with the prediction of Isaiah concerning this same prophet that should go before our Lord to prepare the way before him, translated in our English version as follows: \"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert an highway for our God.\" (Isaiah 40:3.) Is it more remarkable that the Lord should reveal to Lehi what the voice in the wilderness should cry than that he should reveal it to Isaiah? With reference to the Unknown's charge that on the same page quoted above, Nephi makes \"several quotations from the writings of Paul in the 9. of Romans, about the 'olive tree,' and the 'branches broken off, with others grafted in,'\" etc., the gentleman, if acquainted with the prophets of Israel ought to know that this simile is not original with Paul; but that the ancient prophets used it in illustration of Israel and the judgments that should come upon the people. Moreover, in addition to our books of Jewish scriptures the Nephites had some of the writings of the other prophets of Israel, notably the book of Zenos, in which was given at great length this simile of the tame olive tree and the branches being broken off and others grafted in, etc., from which book, unquestionably, Nephi obtained his ideas.\n\nQUOTATION FROM PETER.\n\nThe Unknown charges that Nephi quoted from the words of Peter, which I give here, followed by the passage from Nephi. Peter: \"Whom the heaven must receive until the time of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.\" Nephi: \"Behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers; and also that we may preserve unto them the words which have bene spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto the present time.\" The omissions that are made in order to bring words together to establish the charge of plagiarism, will exhibit to what straits the Unknown is driven to make out his case.\n\nOne other thing the Unknown seems to have overlooked, viz., that the Book of Mormon is a translation of the ideas and prophecies of men deriving their knowledge concerning the Messiah and things associated with his life either from the old Jewish scriptures, which were in their possession, or from the revelations of God direct to them; and that the translator, Joseph Smith, being more or less familiar with New Testament and Old Testament expressions, in making the translation, at times used Bible phraseology in representing ideas akin to those found in Jewish scriptures. See also my remarks under heading No. 3, where this defense is more fully stated.\n\nTHE SHAKESPEAREAN QUOTATION.\n\n2. The Unknown fairly revels in the thought that he has Lehi quoting Shakespeare many generations before our great English poet was born; and indulges in the sarcasms which Campbell and more than a score of anti-Mormon writers have indulged in who have mimicked his phraseology. Now the fact is there are two passages in Job which could easily have supplied both Shakespeare and Lehi with the idea of that country \"from whose bourn no traveler returns.\" That this may appear I give the passages from Shakespeare, Job and Lehi. It should be remembered always that the Nephites had the Jewish scriptures with them, including the book of Job; hence Lehi could have obtained his idea from the same source whence Shakespeare obtained his.\n\nShakespeare: \"That undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns.\"\n\nJob: \"Let me alone that I may take comfort a little, before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death.\" (Job 10:20, 21.) \"When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.\" (Job 16:22.)\n\nLehi: \"Hear the words of a parent whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave from whence no traveler can return.\"\n\nIt will be observed that the passage from the Book of Mormon follows Job more closely than it does Shakespeare both in thought and diction; and this for the reason, doubtless, that Lehi had been impressed with Job's idea of going to the land whence he would not return, and Joseph Smith, being familiar with Job, and very likely not familiar with Shakespeare, when he came to Lehi's thought, expressed it nearly in Job's phraseology.\n\nFROM THE NEW TESTAMENT.\n\n3. The Unknown asks me again how it is that Nephi, living in the sixth century B. C., can quote numerous passages, about \"three hundred from the New Testament alone, and whole chapters from our English version of the Bible, which did not come into existence for more than 2,000 years after he wrote.\" When the Unknown says that there are three hundred quotations from the New Testament alone in the writings of Nephi, if he meant that, he simply makes a colossal misrepresentation, for there is no such number of passages in Nephi from the New Testament alone, nor, in fact, in the whole Book of Mormon. But as I think he must have meant this assertion to apply to the whole Book of Mormon, I will take no advantage of his misstatement as to confining that number to Nephi, but will meet the larger question as to all these passages in the Book of Mormon which parallel passages in both the Old and New Testament. Because Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by means of the inspiration of God and the aid of the Urim and Thummim, it is generally supposed that this translation occasioned the Prophet no mental or spiritual effort, that it was purely mechanical; in fact, that the instrument did all and the Prophet nothing, than which a greater mistake could not be made. All the circumstances connected with the work of translation clearly prove that it caused the Prophet the utmost exertion, mental and spiritual, of which he was capable, and that while he obtained the facts and ideas from the Nephite characters, he was left to express those ideas in such language as he was master of. This, it is conceded, was faulty; hence here and there verbal defects in the English translation of the Nephite record. Now when the Prophet perceived from the Nephite records that Isaiah was being quoted; or when the Savior was represented as giving instructions in doctrine and moral precepts of the same general character as those given in Judea, Joseph Smith undoubtedly turned to those parts of the Bible, where he found a translation substantially correct, of those things which were referred to in the Nephite records, and adopted so much of that translation as expressed the truths common to both records; and since our English version of the Jewish scriptures was the one the Prophet used in such instances, we have the Bible phraseology of which the Unknown complains, and of which this, in the judgment of the writer, is the adequate explanation to all of that class of his objections.\n\nTHAT GIVING AWAY.\n\n4. What the Unknown describes as Nephi giving himself away is based on my unknown friend's inability to comprehend a very simple fact. He says that in the 31st chapter of the second book of Nephi, the writer, forgetting that he was pretending to write in the sixth century B. C. treats the baptism of Christ as actual history. That is, he holds, the writer changes from prophecy to narrative. The fact is that some time previous to this (see I Nephi, chapter 11) the baptism of Jesus had been shown in vision to Nephi, hence to him had become as an accomplished fact, after which, according to this chapter quoted by the Unknown, the voice of the Son of God (then a pre-existent Spirit) came unto Nephi, saying \"He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost like unto me; wherefore, follow^ me, and do the things which ye have seen me (i. e., in vision) do.\" Now Nephi, with this in mind, points out to his brothers in the next verse how, by following their Lord and Savior down into the water, \"according to his word\" (i. e., given previously in Nephi's vision) promises them that they shall then receive the Holy Ghost. All of which considerations demonstrate that the gentleman has not understood the chapter over which he grows vulgarly hilarious by such expressions as \"whooped up,\" \"Holy Moses, preserve us!\" and his reference to \"Boss Tweed.\"\n\nNO NEW TRUTH.\n\n5. The next charge of the Unknown is that the Book of Mormon makes known no moral or religious truth, no \"not one item,\" and then the gentleman resorts to a thing which to say the least of it looks strangely out of place in a discussion of this description, and reminds one of the methods of a low order of politicians, who, when unable to maintain their part of a controversy by reason, arrogantly offer a bet, usually at large odds, that their side will prevail; and if the wager for any cause be not taken, with turkey-cock pride they strut about, as if they had demonstrated the truth of their contention. Now I do not know what our Unknown friend would regard as a spiritual or moral truth, but here is at least one that I commend to his consideration: \"Fools mock, but they shall mourn.\" It is quite original to the Book of Mormon, as are the other quotations which follow, but I will not trouble the gentleman for his hat, even though it be a Stetson, as up to date I have been able to clothe my own head without an effort to win wagers or prizes. Whoever the Unknown may be it stands out pretty clearly from his article that he is not familiar with great moral and religious questions. He seems not to be aware that the Jews for many ages have been asking this same question of the Christian, i. e., they demand to know what moral and religious truth Jesus taught the world that was not already taught by Jewish rabbis; and no later than in the October number of the Open Court, a famous rabbi parallels the choicest moral aphorisms of Christ's teachings with quotations from the Talmud; while there has not arisen within the last two centuries an anti-Christian disputant, but who makes the same claims in behalf of the moral and spiritual teachings of Buddha; and not only do they claim that Christ's moral truths were borrowed from more ancient teachers, but that the principal events of his life also, from his birth of a virgin to his resurrection as a God, were stolen from myths concerning Old World heroes and teachings. When Messiah came to the New World, he had the same announcements to make concerning himself, and his relations to the world; the same ethical and spiritual doctrines to teach; and as he had been accustomed to state these doctrines in brief, aphoristic sentences while in Judea, it is not strange that the same things were given to the Nephites, in their language, much in the same order; which Joseph Smith, observing, and finding these truths substantially stated in our English Bible, adopted, where he could do so consistently, the language of that book. Still there are certain statements of moral and spiritual ideas that the Unknown will find it difficult to parallel from the Bible, a few examples of which I here give: \"Wickedness never was happiness.\" \"The Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.\" \"I give unto men weaknesses that they may be humble, and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me.\" Then let the gentleman take into consideration the exclusiveness of the Jews, and of the Christians also, for matter of that, and then contemplate the following passage which breathes such a spirit of universal charity and joins the hands of all the great moral teachers among all nations into one splendid brotherhood: 'The Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word; yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.\" Then let the Unknown parallel from the Bible the following great spiritual truth from the Book of Mormon: \"Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy.\" A sentence which tells, as it is told nowhere else, the purpose of man's existence. The limits of this article preclude the mention of historical and doctrinal truths which the Book of Mormon makes known to the world. Also, consideration of the gentleman's efforts to explain away the existence and force of the prophecies in the Book of Mormon to which I alluded in my Tabernacle discourse, and which may be found at page 122 of the current edition of the Book of Mormon. I esteem what he has there said of so little importance that I shall pass it without comment as its weakness and inaccuracy will be apparent to all who read it. Indeed at this point the gentleman makes it quite clear that he is not familiar with the book he attempts to criticise. In trying to make it appear that Nephi \"jumbles up his own history and contradicts himself\" the Unknown astonishes us with the statement that Nephi was a Jew, and learnedly tells us that his seed or the remnant of it will inevitably be Jews and Nephites and not Lamanites, and hence the prophecies concerning the Lamanites could not apply to the remnant of Nephi's seed. As a matter of fact Lehi, and hence all of his sons, were of the tribe of Manasseh, and Nephi was speaking with reference to both his own and his brother Laman's descendants of whom the Indians are the remnant. When I reached this part of the gentleman's production I thought I was not only entitled to know who it was I was to meet in discussion, but also to have an opponent who at least was acquainted with the subject.\n\nAS TO THAT \"SORROW.\"\n\nA word as to the \"sorrow\" which the gentleman experiences when he sees a man of my \"ability\" (shades of flattery, leave us!) \"fooling away his time and thought in the useless attempt to bolster up as a divine revelation that which the intelligent millions of the American people are persuaded is fabrication!\" What a jewel was lost to the anti-Christians of the first or second century by the Unknown being born in the nineteenth, instead of the first century! What an eloquent appeal he could have made, for instance, to the misguided Paul, who wasted his thought and time in an effort (I will not say useless one) to bolster up such a delusion as the Christian religion was at that time thought to be! A delusion which the intelligent millions of civilized Rome regarded as the vilest of all deceptions. Again, how ostentatiously the Unknown could have said to Paul, if the latter was really in earnest to know the character of the men who originated this Christian delusion, that he could learn it from some of the historical facts and the accepted rumors current at that time about Messiah and his immediate followers. From such sources he could have learned that Christ was a blasphemer, a disturber of the peace, a menace to the authority of Rome, the consort of vile Galilean peasants, an associate and sympathizer with women of questionable reputation, and who, at last, for the peace and good order of the community in which he lived, was duly crucified between two thieves. He was buried and his sepulcher guarded, but his vile associates bribed the soldier guards, stole his body, and then gave it out that he was risen from the dead; and on these falsehoods arose the fabric known as the Christian church! There would be no resisting such an appeal as this if only some one had arisen with the intelligence to have advanced it. Undoubtedly Paul would have ceased his labors, and perhaps Christianity itself would not have survived such an attack, and hence many antiChristians may regret that this Unknown gentleman did not live in the period when his services would have been so effective. But since the Unknown, through no fault of his, however, missed his opportunity in that age, he exerts his abilities in this, and appealingly says to me, if I would know the real \"truth about the Book of Mormon, and the character of the men who manufactured it,\"I should read the '\"Origin and Progress of Mormonism,' by that well-informed and reliable historian, Pomroy Tucker!\" Shades of primer days, not to say days of the bib and rattle! After nearly a century of existence, despite the efforts of its enemies to destroy it, after surviving as Mormonism has all the floods of falsehood and absurdity hurled upon it, are we now to turn back to what Pomroy Tucker has said in order to get the \"exact truth\" concerning Mormonism and the character of the men who brought it forth? I must inform tne Unknown, whatever he may think of me, that I must suppose myself utterly incorrigible, for I have read Pomroy Tucker years ago, and also recently, and if he will call on me I will point out to him several score of other anti-Mormon writers I have read, of like ilk with Tucker, and yet I am not reclaimed. Deliberately and proudly, I take my stand with the people whom these writers have maligned, and whose doctrines and history they misrepresent, and announce my absolute faith -- notwithstanding even the argument of the Unknown -- in the divinity of the Book of Mormon. Respectfully, B. H. Roberts.\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah, Nov. 27, 1903.\n\nNotes: (forthcoming)\n\nVol. XLVI. Salt Lake City, Utah, Sunday, December 6, 1903. No. 234.\n\nELDER ROBERTS'S DEFENSE\n\nOF THE\n\nBOOK OF MORMON.\n\n________\n\nEditor Tribune: -- In reply to my article in The Tribune of November 22nd, pointing out, in response to his public challenge, some of the great difficulties in the way of accepting Nephi as an ancient prophet of God, and the Book of Mormon as an ancient revelation from God, Elder Roberts begins by finding fault with me for not writing over my full signature. But the reasons he intimates for my not doing so prove altogether too much, and hence, by a logical maxim, prove nothing. For they would prove that those great and high-minded statesmen, Alexander Hamilton, Chief Justice John Jay, and James Madison, acted an unworthy part, and were lacking in courage because, for wise reasons, they conducted those masterly discussions which made up The Federalist, over an assumed name.\n\nThen the sarcasms about the rehashing by more recent writers, of Alexander Campbell's arguments against the Book of Mormon, are \"wasted on the desert air,\" so far as I am concerned, for I have never seen any article or treatise by Campbell on the subject. It would be quite easy to retort and say that if it were not for the writings of Orson Pratt, the more recent defenders of the Book of Mormon would be without ammunition. But that style of arguing amounts to nothing.\n\nElder Roberts' defense seems to raise new difficulties without really settling any, although it is ingenious and skillful. On general principles, there is no reason why I should not accept the writings of Nephi and the Book of Mormon as readily as my opponent, if they were true. But the reason why I do not, is because of the extent and variety of the evidence against them, only a few points of which can be discussed in a newspaper article. Since my main object is to establish truth, I wish to treat Elder Roberts and his argument in a fair and candid way.\n\nLet us come now to the main proposition, which is twofold: Elder Roberts affirms that Nephi was a prophet of God, living and writing about 600 B. C.; and that the Book of Mormon is a divine revelation.\n\nThe evidence compels me to deny both of these propositions and to declare that neither of them is true. Now let us try to find some common ground on which we can stand. As such ground, I offer these two propositions in reference to books in general, which seem to me self-evident: First, any book which professes to have been written in ancient times, and yet quotes from authors not born until centuries after, is a spurious book.\n\nSecond, any book which professes to be a Divine revelation to the people of the present time, and yet reveals nothing, which it did not appropriate from some other book or source of knowledge already in the possession of the people, is a spurious book. I use the term \"revelation\" in its ordinary sense, as referring to Divine truth. These are two propositions which I think people of all creeds can stand upon, for I think they contain nothing which is not self-evident. The differences of opinion will begin when we come to apply these two fundamental principles. Still, it is my opponent's privilege to dissent from these propositions, if he thinks they are not self-evident. But I think that careful, reasoning people generally, will accept them. Anyhow, I take my stand upon them and proceed to apply them.\n\nTHOSE QUOTATIONS.\n\n1. As to the alleged Prophet Nephi. If it can be clearly shown that he quoted passage after passage from the New Testament writers, who were not born for centuries after he claims to have written, then the first fundamental principle is violated, and we have demonstrative evidence that Nephi was simply a pretender, and his writings are spurious.\n\nIn my former article I referred specially to three direct quotations by Nephi, from the New Testament writers, taken from Acts 3:21, John 1:26-27, and Romans 11:17-24, and found in I Nephi 3:20, 10:8, and 10:12-14. I also, under discission of the third point, referred to two other quotations from Ephesians 5:18, and Revelations 15:3. It did not seem necessary to quote other passages, for I deemed these sufficient to establish the point.\n\nThe words in Nephi 10:8, \"For there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose\" is a clear plagiarism from John 1:26-27, which reads: \"But there standeth one among you, whom ye know not, He it is who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unlose.\"\n\nThe first part of Nephi 10:8, is: \"Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight.\" This is quoted from Matthew 3:3. The reference of Elder Roberts to Isaiah 10:3, from which the thinks Nephi might have quoted, instead of from Matthew, is irrelevant, because, while the two passages are somewhat similar, the phraseology is different, and the careless Nephi failed to help my opponent out of the difficulty, for he quotes from Matthew and not from Isaiah, demonstrating what a smart fellow he was by quoting from an author that hadn't been born!\n\nSo Elder Roberts' reference to the fact that the olive tree is used figuratively by some of the Old Testament prophets is irrelevant, because Nephi quotes Paul's exact phrases, and does not quote from the prophets. Now, in reference to these quotations by Nephi from the New Testament writers, Elder Roberts says: \"The gentleman very much overstates the difficulty he presents, by making it appear that the alleged quotations are very numerous, when the fact is that the two of three cases he cites virtually exhaust the alleged quoted passages so far as the New Testament is concerned.\"\n\nI am not a little surprised at such a statement, as Elder Roberts rather prides himself on his knowledge of the Book of Mormon, and in his article, near the close of his discussion of the fifth point, laments that he is obliged to carry on this discussion with an opponent who does not seem to be much acquainted with the subject. Well, my friend, I don't boast about my knowledge or superiority to other men; I don't assume \"to know it all.\" But I think I know enough about the Book of Mormon to prevent me from making any such careless and utterly inaccurate statements as the above, \"that the two or three cases he cites virtually exhaust the alleged quoted passages.\" Verily, I begin to wonder whether my friend has ever read the books of Nephi through! If he will now follow me for a little, perhaps he may learn something new about them. Let us see whether \"two or three passages exhaust the quotations.\" In my former article I referred to five quotations from the New Testament writers. Let us go on with the count:\n\n6. In Nephi 5:18, the expression, \"all nations, kindreds, tongues and people,\" is from Revelations 14:6.\n\n7. In Nephi 10:17, the words, \"by the power of the Holy Ghost,\" are from Romans 15:13.\n\n8. \"For he is the same, yesterday, today and forever,\" in Nephi 10:18, is taken from Hebrews 13:8.\n\n9. The words \"caught away in the Spirit of the Lord,\" are from Acts viii: 39.\n\n10. In Nephi 11:21, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\" is from John i: 36.\n\n11. In Nephi 11:27, the words, \"and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost came down out of heaven, and abode upon him in the form of a dove,\" are taken from Matthew 3:16, and from John 1:32.\n\n12. In Nephi 11:35, the strange expression, \"the twelve apostles of the Lamb,\" is taken from the only place in the world where it originated, Revelation 21:14.\n\n13. In Nephi 11:22, the words, \"Yea, it is the love of God which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men,\" are taken from Romans 5:5.\n\n14. In Nephi 12:11, \"And the angel said unto me, These are made white in the blood of the Lamb,\" is from Revelations 7:14.\n\n15. In Nephi 14:1, the repeated expressions, \"mother of abominations\" and \"mother of harlots,\" are taken from Revelation 17:5.\n\nThese fifteen quotations have been taken from the first fourteen chapters of I Nephi, leaving eight chapters more in this book and thirty-three chapters in II Nephi for other quotations. I have jotted down on the fly-leaf of my copy of the Book of Mormon forty-four different quotations from the New Testament writers by this alleged prophet. These quotations are largely in the Sidney Rigdon-Nephi style of inaccuracy. Nephi is just about as inaccurate in quoting scripture as in quoting Shakespeare. Then a large per cent of the language in the books of Nephi is a mere paraphrase, and often a parody, of the language of the New Testament. I have quoted nothing from III Nephi, whose thirty chapters and sixty-eight pages are largely in the direct language of the New Testament, three whole chapters being quoted, although the New Testament was not written for fifty years afterward. I have not quoted from this book, for I understood Elder Roberts to be referring to the first two books.\n\nThe explanation of Elder Roberts that Nephi had a vision of Christ some fifty years before, which made Christ real to him, is no explanation of the fact that there are eight quotations from three New Testament writers in Nephi 2:31st chapter.\n\nAS TO SHAKESPEARE.\n\n2. Concerning Nephi's quotation from Shakespeare, Elder Roberts thinks he has found a way of escape for Nephi from this fatal blunder. He cites a passage from Job from which he thinks Nephi might have quoted, for he says \"the Nephites had the Jewish Scriptures with them, including the book of Job.\" But now observe that this suggested escape for this ancient prophet is out of the Nephite fryingpan into the Lamanite fire. For Shakespeare died in 1616, and the King James English version of the Bible was published in 1611. Now, so far as the argument against the ancient Nephite is concerned, what difference does it make whether he quoted from Shakespeare or our English version of Job, which is the one Elder Roberts alludes to, and which is the only one containing any resemblance either to the passage in Nephi or in Shakespeare. The only way, therefore, to lift Nephi out of this fatal situation is for Elder Roberts to show that he had, in addition to the Jewish Scriptures, a copy of our English Bible with him back there in the wilderness 600 B. C., or else a copy of Shakespeare. Or else let Mr. Roberts agree with me, according to the evidence, that Mr. Nephi was simply a very modern gentleman from New York or Pennsylvania, having in his possession both the Bible and Shakespeare, and then the difficulty is solved.\n\nSECOND PROPOSITION.\n\nNow we come to the second proposition which is, that the Book of Mormon is a Divine revelation to the people of the present time. A large part of what has been said in proof of the spurious character of the books of Nephi applies to the Book of Mormon as a whole. But there are overwhelming special difficulties in the way of accepting it as a new and divine revelation, only three or four of which I can now briefly touch upon.\n\n1. The book claims that the plates, from which it was translated by Joseph Smith, were sealed up and hidden in the hill of Cumorah, New York, about 400 A. D. No one upon this continent ever saw these plates prepared by Mormon except himself and his son, Moroni. They were prepared specially for the people of our time, in this country. After being hidden about 1400 years Joseph Smith claims that the angel Moroni came and disclosed them to him. And the wonderful revelation contained in the plates, about \"the restoration to the earth of the everlasting gospel,\" Elder Roberts says Joseph Smith translated \"by means of the inspiration of God and the aid of Urim and Thummim.\" And, behold, when we come to read this wonderful new revelation and this new everlasting gospel which it discloses, we find that it is simply a feeble and diluted imitation of the Bible revelation and the gospel which had already been in the possession of the Christian people of this country for over two hundred years, and in the possession of their ancestors for over 1200 years.\n\nIf this duplicate, pretended revelation had been brought out among the benighted people of China or India, or some other heathen country who were without these Bible teachings, it would not have been such a complete \"give away.\" But, with a great flourish of trumpets, to give to the Christian people of this country a weak and poor copy of the revelation and the gospel whose bright and radiant original had been in their possession for hundreds of years, seems to me so absurd, and so transparent as a deceiving scheme, I do not wonder that the overwhelming majority of intelligent people utterly reject it. And just because this book, while so loftily pretending to be a new and divine revelation, reveals absolutely nothing which the people did not have before in much better form, how can we avoid concluding that it is a counterfeit book? I will attend presently to the specimens of new truth which Elder Roberts finds in it.\n\n2. There are at least twelve persons, worthy and reliable so far as I can discover, who testify that the substance of this Book of Mormon, with all its queer names of places and persons, its strange history, its battles and slaughters, its continual imitation of Bible phraseology, they had heard read several years prior to the publication of this book, from a religious romance. It was in this romance that the Nephites and Lamanites originated, and also the pretended ancient books of Nephi, Alma, Mosiah, Mormon and the rest. I can find no proof whatever that the above peoples and books ever existed except in the imagination of the writer of the religious romance. And I have never been able to see why the testimony of the above twelve witnesses, who had nothing to gain by their testimony, should be arbitrarily brushed aside, and the testimony of the eleven interested witnesses, who declare that they saw and \"hefted\" the plates, should be gulped down at one swallow. Even if they did see the plates, that proves absolutely nothing essential to the case. They were all ignorant men, and knew nothing about what was written on the plates. Other men saw the famous Kinderhook plates, but what of it?\n\n3. The Book of Mormon, though sealed up and hidden away about 400 A. D., is filled up, from beginning to end, with the phraesology of our English Bible. Not only that, it contains hundreds upon hundreds of the exact phrases and sentences, and about twenty whole chapters from our English Bible which was not published for about 1200 years after the Book was hidden away. In my former article, I intended to state that there are in the Book of Mormon about 300 quotations from the New Testament, and I am obliged to Elder Roberts for interpreting my meaning in that way, for I did not intend to say that the two books of Nephi contain so many quotations.\n\nA VITAL POINT.\n\nNow we come to a vital point. I asked Elder Roberts to explain how the above quotations could possibly have been made if the Book of Mormon is honest in its claim of being an ancient book. And here is his explanation:\n\n\"Because Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by means of the inspiration of God and the aid of Urim and Thummim, it is generally supposed that this translation occasioned the prophet no mental or spiritual effort, that it was purely mechanical; in fact, that the instrument did all and the prophet nothing, than which a greater mistake could not be made. * * * Now when the prophet perceived from the Nephite records that Isaiah was being quoted, or when the Savior was represented as giving instructions in doctrine and moral precepts of the same general character as those given in Judea, Joseph Smith undou"
