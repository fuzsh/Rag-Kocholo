        "text": "This journal was begun July 22nd 1877 and the last entry was on December 23rd 1896. Henry used earlier notes and journals now lost.\n\nGrandfather Henry Eyring's diary covering his life to December 23, 1896 has been placed in a special collection at the University of Utah of which Dr. Hal Bentley is in charge. Anyone wishing to read the diary will be allowed to use a copy, such as this, the original to be made available only when points in the copy are in question.\n\nMiss Clara Pearson of the University Stenographic Bureau has carefully reproduced the diary with no intentional change of spelling or of punctuation. Thus this account is exactly as Grandfather wrote it except for the few pages of signed additions.\n\nThe diary tells of Henry's birth and upbringing in Germany, the journey with his sister Bertha to America, and his subsequent experiences. This is the record of a thoughtful, religious man with vision unclouded by emotion.\n\nHenry Eyring, Salt Lake City, Utah May 7, 1951\n\nIt has been a genuine pleasure to collaborate in the reproduction of the journal of a man so exceptional as Henry Eyring - - man of keen intellect, varied natural talents enhanced by broad learning and experience, of undeviating integrity and warm kindly demeanor and, not of least importance, the strength to pass on a generous portion of these traits to his descendants. H. W. B.\n\nThe birthdates of Carl and Fern Eyring are Aug. 30, 1889 and Oct. 2, 1891 respectively, rather than as recorded in the Journal -- Fern Eyring Smith.\n\nI was born on the 9th day of March 1835 at Coburg, Saxe Coburg - Gotha Germany. My father's name was Edward Christian Eyring; he was born May 311810 Roemhild in Saxe Meiningen Hildburghausen in Germany. His father Henry Elias Eyring was an apothecary and established himself in Coburg, while my father was a youth. The latter served an apprenticeship with my grandfather and afterwards traveled and was employed in his business in different parts of the Continent. As well as I can recollect, he was apothecary's clerk at Munich in Bavaria, Klegenfurth in Karinthia, Austria, and Lausanne on lake Geneva in Switzerland. While at the latter place he had a very severe attack of sickness, was given up to die and his coffin already prepared. He however recovered and returned to his father's home in Coburg. From dates in my possession I am safe in concluding that he resided in Munich from June till December 1829, in Klagenfurth to the end of March 1830, in Lausanne to the last day of October of the same year. It is probable that he left Coburg for Berlin in March 1832, where he remained until March or later in 1833, frequenting during that time the university and preparing himself to become fully conversant with the sciences entering into pharmacy.\n\nWhile in his 19th year he became acquainted with Ferdinandine von Blomberg, whom he married at Gotha May 14th 1834, - Rev. Dr Edward Jacobi, the bride's uncle, officiating.\n\nMy mother was the daughter of the Viscount George Louis von Blomberg, who was employed in the service of King William III of Prussia as Counselor of the King's domains. He was a man of considerable ability and well liked by the King.\n\nMy-grandfather Eyring dying in 1838, my father took possession of the apothecary's business, which was valued at that time 36, 000. florins.\n\nMy mother gave birth to six children, three of whom died in their infancy. The surviving three are myself, my sister Bertha, who is at the present date of writing (July 22 1877) the wife of Wm Greenwood and resides at American Fork in Utah Co, U T. and my sister Clara, who resides in her native town Coburg at the present time. My mother was born in Rhenish Prussia Oct 20 1811 and died at Coburg May 7th 1843. She had overheated herself and sat down in a cool place bringing on rheumatic Fever, the premature birth of a female infant and shortly afterwards death. My sister Bertha was born 12 June 1836 and Clara Jan 30 1841.\n\nAbout a year before my mother's death, my father made a business trip to Vienna to lay in a supply of Hungarian leeches for his business. While at that place he became acquainted with some men who had started a factory in Bohemia for the manufacture of Extract of Oakwood for tanning and dyeing purposes. They had bought from the Austrian government the exclusive right for manufacturing the said extract and expected to make a large fortune out of this patent. My father being rather of a sanguine and hopeful disposition was drawn by them into their schemes but did not invest very much at that time... grandmother Eyring dying in 1842 the Estate was divided, my father receiving for his share the apothecary's business and Ten thousand florins in Cash. Most of this money he invested afterwards in the Factory business, my mother however being opposed to the project.\n\nAfter her death my father being very much bowed down by grief and feeling to get away from the scenes which ever and anon brought her memory fresh to his mind Concluded to sell out his business, which he did in the summer of 1844.\n\nIn the meantime he had employed a Miss Ida von Sinner to teach and instruct my sisters and to take the supervision of house affairs. She was a native of Berne Switzerland where she was respectably connected. It was her desire to have married my father, but he did not feel at that time that he could make up his mind to marry again, having been extremely attached to my mother. The price obtained for his business was Fifty seven thousand florins; a Mr. Gruendler bought him out, who renovated the house and raised its value to Seventy five thousand florins at which price it was sold after his death, which occurred in 1853. Miss von Sinner having been dismissed from service my father took Bertha and Clara to Erfurt in Prussia and placed them in care of their maternal grandfather. In 1845 my father removed to Wittingan in Bohemia, where he in the meantime had bought out the owners of the Factory, before referred it. The business being a new and untried one, no other factory of the kind ever having been established in Austria or Germany, many difficulties arose and as early as 1847 my father had spent his entire fortune without having been able to make the factory pay its own expenses. He prevailed on two men to unite with him as partners, Each on furnishing Ten thousand Austrian florins and becoming equal proprietors with him. Their names were Lamprecht and Finke. But even after their capital had been exhausted it appeared that the Factory was still unable to stand on its own resources. My father however felt quite sanguine that he would yet succeed to make it a well paying business and he and his partners started about Aug 10 1850 from Wittingan to Prague in order to attend to some business which they hoped would give their affairs a heavy impetus. Before leaving, my father was attacked with Cholera but despite the urgings of his partners to re-main until improved in his health, he started with them.\n\nOn the way his condition became worse and worse until his partners almost by force compelled him to re-main at a town called Tabor, where after much suffering he expired on the 12th August 1850. His partner Mr. Finke evidently from fright and excitement was taken down also and expired the day after my father's demise. My father was about 5 feet 10 1/2\" in height and weighed at the time of his death about 180 #\n\nHe was naturally a very kindhearted man, but rather hasty and impetuous at times. He manifested great energy in business and even in adversity was hopeful and undismayed.\n\nAlthough very sanguine of success, yet he remarked to me that if he should fail in his calculations ultimately, he' would make for America and take me along with d him.\n\nIn regard to religion he might be said to have been a free thinker and to have shaken off the shackles of sectarianism. He was liberal and generous to a fault and too confiding for his own personal interest. Having inherited a handsome fortune in his youth he did not realize the value of it and having too much faith in mankind he suffered himself to be imposed upon and to be robbed of the hard earnings of his father. However he was a most affectionate father to me and I have nothing but blessings for him in my heart and although his lack of prudent management deprived me of a handsome inheritance, yet the very poverty which I had to pass through was a blessing in disguise and an agent to prepare me for the reception of the plan of salvation, as revealed through the prophet Joseph Smith. Had my father continued to pursue his apothecary business, there is every probability that today I would be in Coburg in easy circumstances and unapproachable as far as the true faith is concerned. I am not able to give much of an account of my mother's history. She descended from an ancient aristocratic family and was herself raised in the refined style of the nobility of Germany. I was too young at the time of her death to appreciate her good qualities, but from the best information which I was able to gather, I have come to the conclusion that she was a most affectionate mother and wife and as happy in her union with my father as it is possible to be in this mortal state of existence.\n\nMy Sister Bertha met with a very serious accident while 7 years of age. Clara and herself were playing on the porch of my father's house, having a baby wagon of wicker work to amuse themselves with. Bertha climbed on top of the little wagon and leaning over the railing of the porch lost her balance and fell a distance of about 12 feet upon the pavement of the yard. She probably fell upon the roof of a wood shed first, breaking the fall and saving her life. She was how-ever insensible for a long time and lay in a very critical condition for some weeks. The doctors attending to her case made an incision in her skull which took some two or three years to entirely heal over. There is no doubt that her intellectual development was considerably checked by the effects of this fall and although she does not lack a fair share of intelligence, yet at school she was slow to learn and much less gifted than her younger sister Clara.\n\nIn August 1844 Bertha and Clara were taken by our father to Erfurt to our maternal grandparents, where Bertha remained until about 1850. She was then re-moved to Coburg and lived with our uncle Schmier, the husband of my father's sister Emily. Bertha had a good home there and was kindly treated. In 1853 she emigrated with me to America, where we arrived Sept 8th, landing at New York. When I left that City 1st March 1854 I lit her remain there, she having found employment in the millinery line. In the fall of the same year she went with some friends to Chicago where she remained until about Christmas. While in Chicago she had a very severe attack of sickness, but on recovering she started for St Louis where she arrived Dec 21st 1854, myself meeting her on the packet-boat which conveyed her from Alton to St Louis. On June 17th 1855 I baptized Bertha into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints.\n\nIn the summer of 1856 she emigrated to Utah in Captain John Banks' company. Jan y_L7- 1857 she married Isaac Bowman of Salt Lake City by whom she had three children, Henry, Clara and Hyrum; Clara died when she was several years old with the scarlet fever.\n\nBertha did not live happily with her husband and separated from him about the year 1868.\n\nIn 1869 or thereabouts she married Wm Greenwood, with whom she appears to be satisfied. By him she had three children up to the present time, one of whom died in 1874 while her husband was on a mission in England.\n\nClara remained with our grandparents from 1844 to about 1854, and then removed to Coburg, where she lived with our uncle Schnetz, who is the husband of my father's sister Henrietta. Clara showing much natural ability our relatives did all in their power to give her a liberal education.\n\nThrough the influence of Baron von Stockman, Queen Victoria of England became interested for my sister Clara and rendered her material aid in bearing the expenses of her education.\n\nIf I can obtain a short sketch of Clara's life from her pen I will insert into my journal hereafter.\n\nNow to return to my own history.\n\nWhen five years of age I received my first lessons in reading, my father employing a Mr. Bagge to give me private lessons at home. When seven I visited the public school called \"Rath-Schule\", but a Mr. Frommemn starting a private select school my father sent me there soon after. In that school I was rapidly advanced and when in my tenth year studied the following branches: Reading, Writing composition, arithmetic, geography history, Latin, French, natural history, natural philosophy and singing.\n\nIn August 1844 I accompanied my father and two sisters to Erfurt where they were left with my grand-parents. Father and myself returned to Coburg having had a very pleasant trip and traveling in our own carriage.\n\nAfter returning, I moved to Dr. Frommemn's, where I boarded in his family I saw Dr. F. at Nuremburg in 1874 and afterwards sent him a \"voice of warning\" from Switzerland. In the fore-part of March 1845 my father took me to Nuremburg, where he had some business to attend to connected with his factory in Bohemia. We journeyed from Coburg to Bamberg by mail-coach and from B. to Nuremburg by rail road, it being the first rail road ride of my life.\n\nAfter returning to Coburg, my father took me to Gotha, where we arrived the latter part of March 1845. There lived at that time at Gotha Dr. Edward Jacobi, the husband of my maternal grandfather's sister. He was at the time of my arrival at Gotha, provisional Principal of the Real gymnasium of Gotha, an institution of learning about equal to an American College. He was also chief chaplain to the Duke of Coburg and Privy Counselor of the Consistory of the Duchy. He was a man of great oratorical powers and could al-ways draw immense congregations whenever it was announced that he would preach.\n\nI wish his name handed down to my posterity as my true benefactor, for after my father failed in business and became unable to pay the expenses of my education, he defrayed them out of his own pocket, a-mounting to several hundred dollars, which under his limited income was a considerable sacrifice to bring. His wife, who was a very fine spirited woman no doubt encouraged him in this good work and deserves due credit for the same.\n\nBoth have fallen asleep years ago, but my heart feels drawn out towards them and I trust that we may meet in the holy resurrection of the Just.\n\nAfter arriving at Gotha my uncle Jacobi lodged me with a Mr. Weidner, a clergy-man of the Lutheran church. Mr. Weidner was a singular, but good-hearted man; I remained with him about one year, then moved to the house of Mr. E. T. Benser one of the Teachers of our college.\n\nWhile I remained at Gotha in Mr. Benser's house I was subjected to a very strict discipline. There were about 12 young men boarding at the same place, who all went to the same college...\n\nWe had to rise at 5 o'clock in the morning both summer and winter and were not allowed to go to bed until 10 p.m.\n\nAs sock' as we rose and washed ourselves we had to sit down to a large table and study our lessons for school. After school was out in the afternoon we were allowed about an hour for play, after that we resumed our studies until 10 p. m. True, this may appear rigid discipline to my children who were born in this free country, but in order to attain to an education, much perseverance and diligence are required. During vacations I made visits either to Erfurt or Coburg, choosing however the most favor-able time of the year for those recreations.\n\nAt Erfurt I visited my grandfather's family and two sisters. The old gentleman was quite weak in mind and his memory had become very defective, his wife (my step-grandmother) was at that time robust and much younger then grand-father; of her children Louis, Veronica, Louise and Ferdinandine lived with her at the time of my visits. Louis, who learned the business of a scientific farmer was naturally weakly, afterwards emigrated to America and died in Missouri about the year 1873. Veronica was a very pleasant, agreeable young woman at that time, but has changed very materially and when I called upon her in 1875 she treated me with icy coldness. Louise married an officer in the Austrian service. Ferdinandine lives with her sister Veronica and brother Edward at Erfurt. Edward was major in the Prussian service, but is now pensioned, having nearly lost his hearing.\n\nIn connection with a number of other young people I received preparatory lessons from my uncle Jacobi to fit me to receive my confirmation in the faith of the Lutheran Church. On the 15th April 1849 I was con-firmed by uncle Jacobi in the Church of the Duke of Coburg and thereby became a full member of the Evangelical or Lutheran Church.\n\nApril 17th 1849 I left Gotha and by way of Halle and Zwickan Eger and Budweis traveled to Wittingan, where my father resided. W. is located in the southern part of Bohemia, was at that time a town of about 5000 inhabitants who were entirely Catholic in their faith and quite bigoted at that. There was however a priest by the name of Father Fiedler who entertained quite liberal sentiments and was on very good terms with my father. Father feeling anxious that I should learn the Bohemian language he arranged with Father Fiedler to give me lessons, but having no taste for that language and believing that I would never be benefited if I did learn it I made but slow progress!\n\nOn the outside of the town my father and his partners Lamprecht and Finke occupied some buildings, owned by Prince Schwarzenberg, for a factory. They had a ten horse power steam engine which was used for chipping up Oak-wood. The fine chips were then loaded into large Hogsheads and the juice was extracted by means of hot water, which juice was drained off and evaporated to a stiff Extract resembling Extract of Logwood. This Extract of Oakwood is an excellent article for tanning and dyeing and had not the expense of extracting been too great, there is no doubt the Factory would have proven a great blessing to the country.\n\nFebruary 26th 1850 I left Wittingan for Vienna where I entered upon an apprenticeship in the wholesale drug business with Mr. F. C. Mayrhofer.\n\nMr. M. was a lawyer by profession but through the death of his father and elder brothers he came into the possession of the business, which he understood but imperfectly. He was naturally a well-meaning man, but rather proud and haughty in his demeanor to his employees which produced a natural dislike against him by his clerks and apprentices. When my father died, the means for my support stopped and then it was, when Mr. Mayrhofer kindly came to my rescue and furnished me board lodging and clothing. Had he only known how to give, I should have felt to hand him down to my posterity as my friend and benefactor, but being proud in spirit he sought occasion to make me feel my dependency upon him. This course alienated me from him and after my apprenticeship was over, I felt determined to extricate myself from the bondage which sorely oppressed my spirit. On the first of January 1852 I formed a resolution to leave for America as soon as the way would open. I conferred with my uncle Schmier who advised me to wait until the summer of 1853 and recommended my taking Bertha with me to America. I had a friend in Vienna by the name of Gustavus Finck to whom I confided all my plans. Anxiously I waited for the time of deliverance which finally dawned upon me on the 19 April 1853, on which day I left Vienna, the city of despotism and oppression, animated with hope for a better and brighter future.\n\nI reached my native town Coburg April 23d, where I made preparations for my Emigration to America. While at Coburg I chiefly employed my time in the lab-oratory of Mr. Gruendler's Apothecary business, the house in which I was born and which had been owned by my grandfather and father successively.\n\nMy relatives in Coburg treated me very kindly and after passing two agreeable months with them, Bertha and myself set out for America on June 27th 1853. We embarked at Bremerhaven on July 1st on the Bark \"Diana\" and reached New York after a very tedious voyage on September 8th.\n\nThe bark we occupied during that time was a slow, old-fashioned vessel and but very poorly fitted for the convenience of Emigrants. The fare was very coarse and quite scant, so much so that we suffered hunger most all the time. Water was also scarce and part of it spoiled and became very foul, but had to be used for cooking which made the victuals taste wretchedly. In New York I used every endeavor to obtain employment at most anything I thought I could do, but to no purpose. Consequently I concluded to try my luck in the west, leaving Bertha at New York, where she had obtained employment in the millinery business. I left New York on the evening of March 1st 1854 going by rail to Pittsburgh and from there by water to St Louis, which place I reached on the evening of March 8th. Next day I went to Waterloo Ills, where I visited some of my German friends the Bros Krauss who had relatives at Waterloo.\n\nHaving succeeded in obtaining a situation I entered upon my labors with Bunding and Voigt Wholesale Druggists 100 Main Street St Louis Mo on March 25th, having by that time about exhausted my funds. The summer of 1854 was very dry and hot, the river at Cincinnati becoming so low that people could wade across it without hardly wetting their knees. While in St Louis I read at different times articles about the Mormons, representing them to be a set of thieves, cut-throats and the very off-scourings from the earth. Hearing that several companies of that people had come to St Louis, I apprehended danger to the public safety and felt it hardly safe in the streets after night. On the morning of December 10th 1854 I happened to hear that the Mormons held meetings in a chapel at the corner of 4th Street and Washington Ave Feeling a curiosity to see some of those desperate characters I went to their meeting on the evening of the same day. I arrived there rather early and discovering a bench near the door I concluded to locate myself there, thinking if anything serious should happen I could readily make my escape to the street. After occupying that bench for a while and watching the people who were now coming in gradually I discovered that they were a friendly, sociable people who certainly did not have the appearance of cut-throats. Upon this I took courage' and actually ventured to seat myself in the gallery.\n\nTime for meeting having arrived, the choir sang, \"Who are those arrayed in white brighter than the noon-day sun?\" Having been used to the slow solemn church music of Germany, I was rather unfavorably impressed with the lively tune sung by the choir and imagined to discover something fanatical in the performance. Singing over, Elder Milo Andrus arose and opened by prayer. Here was another stunter; his lively quick manner of speech was so much in contrast with the slow, measured tone of orthodox Christian ministers that I was almost shocked at his seeming lack of piety_ After singing again by the choir Elder Andrus addressed the congregation in an attractive and fluent manner. On Monday Morning Dec 11th I went as usual to my place of business. I mentioned to my fellow Clerk Hopkins, that I had been to a Mormon meeting and found it quite attractive. Wm Brown, our porter, standing by, felt pleased at my favorable mention of the Mormons and finally acknowledged that he himself was a member of the Church.\n\nI told him I was pleased to hear it, as I wanted some further information about that people. In the afternoon he handed me a voice of warning by Elder P. P. Pratt which I read through on Monday night and returned to Bro Brown on Tuesday morning. He asked me how I liked the book. I told him there were many interesting thing in it, but as to believing in angel's visits or visions I could not do that. I will here say that for some years previous to that time I had discarded all belief in revealed religion, had no connection with any church, but believed in the necessity of virtue morality and honesty. Just prior to my hearing the true gospel I had become to some extent dissatisfied with my infidel notions and I used to reflect like this: \"when I was a zealous Protestant I prayed and went to meeting and had an inward peace and joy which I measurably lost after becoming an infidel and although I could not possibly return to my former Christian convictions, yet I felt a something lacking which infidelity could not possibly furnish me.\"\n\nI was in that condition when I heard the truth and I fully believe that Providence so led me as to hear it at the right time, when my mind was susceptible to good impressions.\n\nFrom the time I first heard Elder Andrus speak (Dec 10/54) until now (July 17/80) I have always attended the meeting of the Latter day Saints and the instances are very rare indeed, when I failed to go to meeting, it being at the same time my duty to do so.\n\nI name this in my history that my children may imitate my example and never neglect this very important duty of assembling with the Saints.\n\nI studied most earnestly and read every book and pamphlet I could obtain in St Louis, having a bearing on the doctrines of the Church. It took me about two months to become convinced of the truth at the same time I sought diligently to receive some manifestation from the Lord which should show me, whether to be baptized or not. After thus seeking for some little time I had a dream as follows: \"I was in a room about 18 x 20 feet there was a centre or round table in the middle of the room and several chairs around the table. Apostle Erastus Snow occupied one of them, Elder Wm Brown another and myself a third. Elder Snow talked to me, as it appeared about one hour, illustrating in a forcible manner the principles of the gospel and concluded his remarks, by saying, \"In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to be baptized and this man, pointing to Bro Brown, shall baptize you.\"\n\nOn the 11th day of March 1855 about 7.30 a. m. I was baptized by Elder Wm Brown in the west part of St Louis in- a pool of rain-water. It was cloudy and warm that morning and after repairing to the house where Bro Brown lived it hailed and rained at a terrific rate. In the afternoon I was con-firmed, Elder Charles Edwards being mouth. April 13th 1855 I was ordained a Deacon and after-wards appointed second counselor to the President of the Deacons' Quorum Bro Robert Watson.\n\nMay 16th 1855 I was ordained to the office of Priest, Bishop Harris being mouth. On the 13th of the same month I preached the first time to a small German congregation.\n\nJune 17th, I baptized my sister Bertha; she was confirmed in the afternoon under the hands of Elders ' Edwards, Hart and Gere. June 27th, I was appointed Clerk of the Priests Quorum.\n\nSept 23d I was appointed President of the Priests Quo-rum and selected for my counselors Bro Foster and Clegg.\n\nDuring the summer and forepart of fall I occasionally visited the Centreville branch in Ills and also the Gravois Branch and spoke to the Saints in my feeble inexperienced way. October 6th I was appointed a mission to the Cherokee Nation. October 11th I was ordained an Elder and set apart to my mission under the hands of the Presidency of the Stake.\n\nMy old Journals give the details of this Mission, but I will insert here a brief Summary of my doings and experience while among the Lamanites. I had the opportunity of speaking to the Saints in their meeting house in St Louis, before leaving for my mission. I felt full of zeal, anxious to enter the vineyard of the Lord and at that time felt as though I would like to de-vote my whole life to the preaching of the word. My employers Messrs Bunding and Voigt, Druggists 100 Main Street St Louis felt very loath to let me go, but of course consented, when they found I was deter-mined to go.\n\nI left funds in the hands of Bp. Harris for the emigration of my sister, settled up my Tithing and on Oct 24 1855 left St Louis for the Indian Territory.\n\nThere were besides myself the following Elders in our little 'Company' James Case (since dead) Wm Bricker, Geo Higginson and Orson Flavell.\n\nWe hired Bro Kinney, who conveyed us in his two-horse wagon very comfortably. When we arrived at Springville Mo. Orson Flavell came to the conclusion that he would prefer to return to Keokuk, where his mother resided.\n\nWe, of course, were willing he should choose for him-self and hence we separated in that town and camped to the west of it the same night.\n\nThe people of Springville were to all appearance about as hard-looking a set as we ever saw and we imagined that should they find out our character and purpose they were just the characters to give us a warm reception. We pitched our tent got our shooting-irons ready and went to rest, trusting in Kind Providence. Soon after retiring a heavy rain came up, continuing most of the night. We passed through South west Mo. and N. W. Arkansas and reached Spavinaw Creek in the Cherokee Nation on Nov. 10/55. On that little stream Bro. Jacob Croft and others, whom he had employed, were building a saw-mill and grist mill for some of the Cherokees.\n\nElder Henry M Miller President of the Cherokee Mission had his head-quarters with Bro Croft and all the Elders found a home under the hospitable roof of that good man.\n\nBro Miller had organized a Branch at Spavinaw Creek, called the Spavinaw Branch and numbering about 50 souls. They were, with the exception of Bro. Croft and family, a body of people who had gone with Lyman Wight to Texas finally became dissatisfied with him and had got as far back as the Cherokee Nation when Elder Miller and the Elders with him found them. After some considerable argument nearly all of them were baptized and appeared to enjoy a good spirit while the Elders moved among them. Among their number were John, George and Wm Cawley. The two first named located at Pine Valley Washington Co Utah, but finally became dissatisfied and left for Plano Ills where they joined the Josephites. Win Cawley located at Fillmore and appears to remain true to his covenants. Bro Croft and Company emigrated to Utah in the summer of 1856. After staying at Bro Croft's some 3 or 4 weeks, assisting him about his mill work and straightening his accounts for him, I started for the Creek Nation in company with Elders James Case and John A Richards. Winter setting in I remained with Edward Burgess near Verdigris River, with whom I spent most of that winter. I availed my-self of every opportunity to become acquainted with the people and their language but was unable to make much of an impression upon them. In order to pay for my Board I chopped and hauled wood, a labor which I was not accustomed to and consequently went tolerably hard.\n\nThe fare was very plain being corn-bread and bacon at one meal and bacon and corn bread at the next meal and so on indefinitely.\n\nThe winter was a very hard one in consequence of which thousands of cattle and hogs perished. The snow lay on the ground over 12 inches deep for about two months and the rivers froze over solidly.\n\nWhen spring opened we resumed our labors in good earnest and labored diligently in the Creek Nation. A Presbyterian minister by the name of Loughridge gave us some trouble and in part through his influence we were ordered to leave the Creek Nation by the U. S. Indian Agent.\n\nConsequently we turned our attention to the Cherokee Nation where I labored with some success on 14 Mile Creek. This was in the summer of 1856. I will state here however that in the spring of the same year I baptized Jack Randall a town chief in the Creek Nation. While staying at Ed. Burgess's in the winter, I visited Jack Randall and preached to him the first principles of the gospel. He was rather unwell at the time but listened with marked attention and in fact his eyes seemed to sparkle with delight as he heard the message of salvation explained to him. He made very few remarks_ and when I departed the next morning, he invited me to call again. This I did some time after-wards, when I found him hoeing potatoes in his garden.\n\nHe bade me go into the house and when he came in his first remarks were: \"I want to be baptized.\" It was then nearly sundown and the river some two miles off, hence I asked him whether we should not wait until morning. He however urged our going at once, saying that he might be dead by morning.\n\nI afterwards learned that a number of years ago he had had a vision of a young man, who explained to him the ways of God and the principles of the gospel. When afterwards different denominations desired him to join their respective churches, he invariably declined, for he found that their teachings were at variance with the sayings of the young man in the vision.\n\nWhen finally I made my appearance he recognized at once the teaching long before received and was ready to receive the Kingdom of God.\n\nHe was afterwards ordained an Elder and became President of a Branch which had been raised up in his neighborhood. He died in full faith of the promises of the gospel some time in 1857 or 1858. I have received endowments for him in the St George Temple. On 14 mile Creek in the Cherokee Nation I raised up a branch of the Church with Arch McDonald as president. He was a faithful man and remained so while I stayed in that country.\n\nAbout August 1856 I was taken sick with intermittent fever while on my way to Geo. Crouch's. After quite a struggle (I was on foot) I reached that place and at once took to bed.\n\nI remained in that condition some three weeks getting weaker every day. Finally I found that unless I took medicine to break the fever, it would well nigh use me up. I therefore took Quinine and began to amend at once. When able to travel I started out, accompanied by Elder Jno A. Richards.\n\nBoth of us were taken down with fever on our journey and had considerable difficulty in getting to John McNair's near Grandriver. McNair although not a member of the church was a friend to the Elders and we were always welcome, sick or well.\n\nWe held our October Conference at Bro Buster's place, situate on one of the tributaries of Grand River. Nearly all the Elders were present, Elder H W. Miller pre-sided. Bro Miller reviewed the work that had been done under his presidency and felt that the Lord had greatly blessed his labors, although sick much of the time.\n\nElders Miller and Case left the Cherokee Mission a-bout Nov. 1856 and Elder Wm Bricker about the same time for St Louis, where he had left his wife. Elder Robert C Petty had died during 1856, leaving W N. Cook, Jno. A Richards, Wm Richey, Geo Higginson and myself to carry on the work of that mission. Elder W. N. Cook was chosen President. He was an excellent good man and wore himself out in the service. He died at Iron Springs Cherokee Nation in the fall of 1858.\n\nNotwithstanding we were ordered to leave the Creek Nation we returned to labor there again in the fall of 1856.\n\nBeing in need of clothing I engaged to clerk for a native of the Creek Nation, Riley Perryman, who kept a little store near Deep Fork. There I spent the winter of 1856 to 1857., seeking on Sundays what opportunities I could get to become acquainted with the people. Our April Conference 1857 was held in the Creek Nation at Elder Randall's. Elder Parley P. Pratt was with us at that Conference. His mind was filled with gloomy forebodings and it appeared as though he were left to himself, not being able to discern the future or any way of escape for himself. Himself and Elder Geo. Higginson were arrested on the road which leads from Fort Gibson to Texas. Bro Higginson after having been taken to Fort Smith Arkansas was liberated and made his way to the Valleys in a Texas Company of Saints, bearing with him the sad tidings of Elder P. P. Pratt's martyrdom.\n\nSoon after the death of Elder Pratt, the Buchanan army was sent to Utah and the excitement against the Latter day Saints ran very high in the U. S. and to some ex-tent in the Indian Territory. It was deemed advisable for the Elders laboring on the Cherokee Mission to remain quiet for a season and consequently I returned to Deep Fork and spent most of the year 1857 in mercantile pursuit.\n\nIn 1858 I was more or less engaged in merchandising. In the fall of the year Sept 17 1858 I married Anne, daughter of Etsoemahla, a Creek half breed. Bro W. N. Cook performed the Ceremony at Iron Springs Cherokee Nation. It was quite an effort for him to get out of bed long enough to officiate and as I was told afterwards, he never left his bed again, but soon passed away. He died with quick consumption and was buried by the brethren of Iron Spring Branch a pile of rock denoting the spot where his body rests for a season. Having now entered the state of matrimony I made it my home with my father in law. In 1859 I traveled much, visiting the branches and seeking for new openings.\n\nI will here state that after the death of Elder Washington N. Cook I was chosen President of the Mission by the vote of the Conference, held at Iron Springs October 1858, Elder Jno A Richards opposing the appointment.\n\nHe having married a well to do Cherokee woman by the name of Widow Wright his sole aim seemed to be how to accumulate and obtain wealth, thereby neglecting the duties of his ministry. When Father Richey and myself went to Utah in 1860 he desired to remain and I have learned since that he joined the Southern army during the war of the Rebellion and of course denied the faith; at least he never returned to Utah to my knowledge.\n\nIn August 1859 my wife gave birth to a little daughter, who only lived to be 4 days old. I named her Lucy Smith Eyring. About the beginning of 1860 I went to Percival's Store and needing clothing for myself and wife I engaged to clerk for him for a short season. I had two log houses built and moved my wife to our new home fitting up the house quite comfortably. April 6 1860 myself and wife separated, she having no disposition to be subject to good teachings and more-over possessing an extremely jealous disposition, she imagined a great many foolish things.\n\nFather Richey, who boarded with us felt to fully justify me in my separation. I had now been about 4 1/2 years on the Cherokee Mission and felt somewhat desirous to know when I would be released from my labors.\n\nNot being able to hear anything from the Presidency of the Church, I called upon the Lord in prayer, asking him to reveal to me his mind and will in regard to my remaining longer or going up to Zion.\n\nThe following dream was given to me in answer to my prayer. I dreamt I had arrived in S. L. City and immediately went to Pres't B. Young's office, where I found him. I said to him: \"Pres't Young I have left my mission, have come of my own accord, but if there is anything wrong in this, I am willing to return and finish my mission.\" To this he replied: \"You have stayed long enough, it is all right.\" Having had dreams before which were literally fulfilled I had faith to believe, that this also would be and consequently commenced at once to prepare for a start.\n\nFather Wm Richey and myself fitted up jointly and on the 23d May 1860 left Springhill in the Creek Nation. Passing through Kansas and Nebraska, we finally reached Omaha in the latter State.\n\nWe found that a Company of Saints led by Captain Murphy was ahead of us a few days' Journey and we resolved at once to hurry and overtake them. This we did, just as they were being ferried across Loupe Fork. Our little wagon was very frail and the brethren of the Company thought that we certainly would not reach S. L. Valley with it. However it held together and instead of having to be helped in by the brethren we had the pleasure of giving rides to some of our weary old Sisters.\n\nI enjoyed myself excellently while crossing the plains, walking nearly the whole distance and to me it was more like a pleasure trip, than a toilsome pilgrimage. I arrived in S. L City Aug. 29th 1860 and stopped at the house of Bro Jno M. Moody.\n\nThe following day Bro Richey and myself called upon Pres't Young, who received us very kindly. I said to him, \"Pres't Young I have come without being sent for, if I have done wrong, I am willing to return and finish my mission. \" He answered: \"It is all right, we have been looking for you.\" Thus my dream was literally fulfilled.\n\nOn the next day we started for Ogden, stopping with Bro Henry W. Miller at Farmington the first night. Next evening we reached Ogden, where I found my Sister Bertha in the enjoyment of good health and strength and very glad to see me after a separation of nearly five years.\n\nShe was at that time the wife of Isaac Bowman, with whom however she did not live happily and from whom she separated about the year 1864.\n\nI boarded at Isaac Bowmans about 3 months, then went to house-keeping on the bench at first Ward of Ogden City.\n\nDecember 14th 1860 I married Mary Bommeli in Salt Lake City. She is a native of Weingarten Canton Thurgau Switzerland, was born March 20th 1831, was baptized into the Church of J. C of L. D S. in November 1854, Emigrated in 1859 went as far as N. Y. City and in 1860 crossed the plains in Captain Murphy's company. On my Journey across the plains I became acquainted with her on the plains and we had many pleas-ant and useful conversations with each other while walking together in advance of the train. Counselor Wm McMaster performed the marriage ceremony at his house.\n\nAfter eating dinner with Mary's father and mother, we set out for Ogden, going as far as Farmington that evening and stopping at the house of Elder Henry W. Miller. Dec 15 _,186.0 we arrived at Ogden and took up our abode in a little two-room adobe house owned by Bro Goodale and situated on the Ogden bench. A day or two after, it commenced to rain and continued for several days, giving us a good soaking, there not remaining a dry spot in the house.\n\nAt that time I was employed as Clerk in Isaac Bowman's Store at $2.00 per day, which enabled me to get a pretty fair start in house-keeping. Towards spring 1861 I bought a little house and lot in the 2nd Ward from one Switzler. It was a poor place, a slough running through it and the one Room house quite leaky and hardly safe to dwell in. However we were happy and contented and felt grateful for every blessing which we did enjoy. March 9th 1861 I was ordained into the 60th Quorum of Seventies. July 6th 1861 we got our endowments at Salt Lake City and received the sealing ordinance under the administration of Pres't Brigham Young. May 18th 1861 Business not justifying the employment of a Clerk any longer I discontinued my labors with I. Bowman and attended to work around home. During harvest I worked for one bu. wheat p day binding wheat; this I followed three weeks.\n\nNov 18th 1861 I commenced teaching school at the 3d Ward School House. At the October Conference a number of families had been called to settle in Washington County; volunteers were also called for. I desired at that time to volunteer but Bro. Chauncey West thought it best for me to remain and teach School. My lungs being weak I found it very difficult to teach and after the expiration of one quarter I determined to remove to Salt Lake City. March 15th 1862 We left Ogden reaching Salt Lake City on the 17th. We resided at first in the 19th ward with Mary's folks, June 16th we removed to the 9th Wd. While in S. L City I worked at ditching across Jordan, getting beet molasses as part pay. In June I commenced cutting granite Rock on the Temple Block, continuing a-bout 3 months and getting $1.25 p day.\n\nAfter that I did a lot of copying music for Bro D. O.. Calder and at the October Conference 1862 Volunteered to go to Dixie.\n\nMay 1st 1862 at midnight my first-born son Henry Elias made his appearance. June 5th He was blessed under the hands of Bp Alonzo H Raleigh.\n\nWhile at Ogden I occupied the position of ward teacher, and in a military capacity was first chosen Company Adjutant and afterwards Captain of Infantry.\n\nAbout Oct 25th 1862 we started for Dixie having hired our passage with John Nebeker, who then had a residence at Toguerville Kane Co.\n\nOur journey was tedious and slow, reaching St George about Nov 23d. We first camped on Bro James Richey's lot, but getting employment at Washington, ginning cotton we re-moved there and remained until the latter part of January. We then pitched our borrowed tent on the ground, which since then has been my home, and commenced our operations. Our earthly substance was very limited. We owned some clothing and bedding and provisions for a few months. We had neither team, wagon, cow nor even chickens and I presume commenced with as little as anybody ever did in St George.\n\nMy wife being a good weaver we exerted ourselves to obtain a loom and when we succeeded in this, her faithful and untiring exertions brought to us a great many comforts which we could not have obtained in any other way at that period of our lives.\n\nI cannot speak too highly in praise of my wife Mary, for through her ceaseless energy and untiring labors we succeeded under the blessings of Heaven to gradually work ourselves up out of extreme poverty.\n\nIt is true, I also labored and often beyond my strength, yet my labor was often unproductive and had it not been for the industrious hands in the loom we would have been much shorter in comforts than we were.\n\nMy first job was the erection of a shelter and when I succeeded in erecting a sod house 16 feet square about 18 inches under ground covered with willows and dirt, I felt that I had achieved quite a triumph and really was more comfortable than many of my brethren, who lived yet in willow shanties or tents. While our sod house was quite comfortable both winter and summer. Nov. 6th 1863 My daughter Louise was bore. While a few months old she was suddenly attacked with some sickness and to all human appearance she was nigh unto death. Her eyes were already glazed over, as though death was at the very door. I called to my aid Elders Wm F. Butler and Charles Smith who administered to her and she was restored at once, for which praise be given to our Heavenly Father.\n\nNov. 29th 1863 I was ordained a High Priest and set apart to be the Bishop of the 2nd Ward St George, under the hands of Elders E Snow and Jacob Gates, the former being mouth.\n\nI had been appointed to that office by a Conference held in the basement of St George Hall Nov 1st 1863. I chose for first Counselor Elder Wm F. Butler and subsequently Elder Charles Smith for second Counselor. From 1863 to the fall of 1868 my labors were of an arduous character considering that-I had not been brought up to hard labor, neither were my ancestors men who labored much with their hands.\n\nI tended mason for some length of time, then resumed my former occupation of stone-cutting, working on the public works in connection with Bros E L Parry, Wilson Linne, Geo Brooks and others. I also farmed, renting land and tilling my own in the Virgin field and Cooper Bottom. I also rented City lots and my time was well occupied with hard work, without realizing very much from my toil.\n\nI raised however considerable cotton, -and-exchanged it for cotton yarn, when my wife wove it into cloth and we were enabled to pay mechanics for their labor on our first adobe house.\n\nI also made adobes and sold them, living at the same time on the scantiest of fare. Flour was very scarce then and while I was making adobes we had sometimes none at all.\n\nI had at that time a small patch of corn; as soon as the ears would get a little hard I would pull them, dry them on the roof of our sod-house and when dry enough, Mary would shell the corn and grind it on a coffee mill, after grinding till 10 or 11 o'clock at night to get enough to do us the next day. The cornbread thus pre-pared was coarse and not very palatable, but we were thankful for that and never murmured because of our poverty. Sometimes we had nothing but shorts to make bread out of and neither meat, milk butter or any shortening, only some carrots to go with the shorts. We had to eat so many carrots in those days that we got well nigh tired of them.\n\nJuly 14th 1865 our daughter Clara was born. She died July 13th 1866 of a disease which took off a good many young children at that time; the name of it I cannot give, but the head seemed to be affected and very severe spasms prevailed until death relieved the poor little sufferers. May 27th 1868 Edward Christian was born.\n\nIn September 1868 I was taken violently ill with rheumatism in the back and left hip and was confined to my bed about three weeks.\n\nThis spell of sickness was brought upon me through over-exertion, in lifting heavy rocks while cutting rock for St George Tabernacle. When I recovered from my sickness I obtained employment in the St George Tithing Office as assistant to Elder Franklin B Woolley Clerk of that Office.\n\nIn January 1869 or near that time money was subscribed and collected for starting a Co-operative Mercantile Institution, and about February Bro F. B. Woolley started for California to purchase Merchandise for said Institution.\n\nOn his return from California he was killed by hostile Apache or Mohave Indians and his body was brought here for interment.\n\nA store was now established under the style and name of \"Southern Utah Mercantile Association,\" with Erastus Snow Prest Jas G Black Sec'y and Jos. Birch Supt. This Association continued until Oct 15th 1872 when its title was changed to St George Co-operative Mercantile Inst. It has been successfully conducted thus far and has paid a dividend to Stock holders of from 20 to 40%o p. annum.\n\nApril-18th--1870 Emily Henrietta was born.\n\nAbout May 1872 I received charge of the Store, which I retained until August 1874. I was also Secretary of the Canaan Co-operative Stock Co., of Z C Rio Virgin Mfg Co. , Adjutant to Brigadier mission to Switzerland.\n\nAug 31st 1874 I started from home and went to Provo by stage thence to S. L - City by Rail. From S. L City to Liverpool I traveled in the Company with Wm Greenward Bros Wood house, V. Halliday & Jacob Zundel, arriving there in the last week Of September.\n\n1874: From Liverpool to Cologne Bro Jacob Zundel accompanied me. We went by way of London where we stopped a few days to see the sights, then went to Harwich, where we embarked for Antwerp. I arrived at Elberfgld--Oct -6 1874 and met my dear Sistr Clara, whom I had not seen since 1849. I stayed several days at Elberfeld and had many pleasant conversations with Clara. She at first appeared to feel to resist any attempt on my part to teach her the gospel of Christ, but by degrees she became somewhat interested and kindly discussed with me different points of doctrine. From Elberfeld I went to Cassel, where I was kindly received-6-y my cousin Mary and her husband Leo Grebe. Grebe's sister, a spinster of strong sectarian proclivities opposed me quite strongly, but civilly, and at her request I met with two ministers at her mothers house, for discussion of our principles. Polygamy was the only topic they seemed to care to dwell upon, but in the main they treated me civilly.\n\nFrom Cassel I went to Coburg where I was very cordially received by my aged uncle Schmier. I also met my aunt Schnetz but neither of them cared to hear any-thing about the gospel.\n\nI spent about one week in Coburg, then made my way to Berne, the head-quarters of the Swiss mission.\n\nI stayed a short time at Berne laboring some little in the vicinity of that place, then in the month of November went to Ravensburgh in Wuerttemburg stopping at the house of Bro Eisenmann who was the President of a little Branch organized at that place.\n\n1874-1875: I labored earnestly at that place for about 4 weeks but found very little encouragement. I then visited other parts of Wirttemburg and finally went to Mannheim where I stayed with Bro Peter Lantensack. I had a little success in that region, baptized several, but was finally ordered by the authorities to leave the Grand duchy on pain of imprisonment and fine. After laboring thus nearly unsuccessful in Germany I returned to Berne and went to work. on the translation of the Book of Doctrine &Covenants.\n\nI succeeded in accomplishing the publication of that valuable treasure, also published a pamphlet on the first principles of the gospel, a new edition of the Hymn Book and performed the Labor necessary for editing the \"Stern\". 1875 My time was thus well employed at Berne during most of the year 1875 and part of 1876.\n\nIn August 1875 Clara visited me in Switzerland and we had a most enjoyable time together, visiting some of the beautiful scenery of the Alps . Our first trip was from Berne to Thun thence to Interlaken and Meimigen. From Meimigen we went on foot (employing a guide) by way of Rosenlain Glacier to Grindelwald, thence to Wengem Alp, where we beheld the grand Jungfrau, the finest scenery I ever beheld. We then returned to Interlaken and Berne.\n\n1875:Our next trip was to Geneva by way of Biel and Neuchatel. From Geneva we went by lake near to where the Rhone enters Lac Leman, thence by Rail to Martigny. We returned by way of Lausanne to Berne.\n\nOur last trip was from Berne to Luzern, by Boat to Flueelen, back to the foot of Mount Rigi, up that mountain by R. R. and down by R R to Arth on Lake Zeng, thence by Boat to Zeng and by Rail to Zurich and Schafthausen, where we parted, Clara returning to Coburg myself to Berne.\n\n1876:In June 1876 I started home by way of Basel and down the Rhine to Rotterdam. Made a detour to Nurembourg where I met Clara for the last time, also my cousin Emily and her husband Mr. Lorsch. They took most affectionate farewell from me and I parted from them with a sad heart.\n\nClara was very kind to me during my stay in Europe and although she did not become quite convinced of the truth of the work of God in the last days, yet she certainly did not reject it. It is my belief that she will yet come up to Zion and possibly join the people of God. The latter part of June 1876 we embarked on the steam-ship Idaho, commemorated the centennial anniversary of our Nations' Birth on the broad bosom of the Atlantic and safely landed at New York in 11 days from Liverpool. We numbered some 800 souls mostly Scandinavians, about 100 from Switzerland and Germany. July 31st I reached home with a small company of Swiss Saints who chose to accompany me South.\n\n1876:When we reached the east-side of the Washington Black Ridge I was met by my two boys Henry and Edward when opposite the Washington Factory, the Swiss Choir, led by Bro Godfrey Wellaner greeted me with some songs, also my daughter Mary Louise, Bros Fawcett and Nixon met me at that place.\n\nMy joy was great to be treated thus cordially by my friends, in fact that day was one of the happiest of my life.\n\nWhen crossing the public square I was met by Louise _______ whom I had not seen before was born Dec 9th. I took her into my arms and appeared to be quite contented as though she had always known me.\n\nWhile in Switzerland I had a dream in which I saw some of my children meeting me in the Public Square as I was returning from my mission. This was literally fulfilled like many other dreams which I have had in my day.\n\nWhile on my mission I had another daughter born 1875 whom we called Clara Virginia; the latter name in commemoration of the name of the Ship which safely carried me from New York to Glasgow, the former name in honor of my Sister Clara. Poor little C. V. however never lived to see her father in the flesh as she died after much suffering.\n\nDeseret's first-born was a boy whom we called Geo. Albert, he died days old. Soon after my return I obtained employment in the Tithing Office was soon after elected Secretary of the Winsor C. S. Ginning Co. and in January 1877 returned to my old post as manager-of St Geo. C. M. L\n\n1877: April 6th 1877 the general Conference of the Church of J. C of Latter Day Saints was held in the St George Temple.\n\n1877: The day previous, St George Stake was re-organized with Jno D. T. McAllister Prest and Thomas J. Jones and Henry Eyring counselors. The Priesthood was seated during the Conference in their proper Order. On the East Stands First Presidency, Presidency St George Stake, High Priests' Quorum, and Elders On the East Stands were also the Twelve Apostles and the Patriarch Jno Smith.\n\nOn the West Stands:\n\nBishops Hunter, Woolley, Preston, D D McArthur and others,\n\nPresidency of the Priests Quorum.\n\n\" \" \" Teacher's \"\n\n\" \" \" Deacon's \"\n\nApril 6th or 7th I was set apart as the 2nd Counselor to Prest McAllister by Prest John Taylor.\n\nFebruary 24th 1877 myself and wives received our seed anointing under the hands of Elder Wilford Wood-ruff, to whom we were subsequently adopted as son and--daughter. During the year 1877 Pres't McAllister and Counselors traveled throughout the entire Stake, setting the different Branches in order and comforting the Saints.\n\nrTO d 1877 we had _another daughter born, whom we named Anna Margaret.\n\nAugust 29th 1877 Pres't B. Young died. Several days prior to his death a number of prayer circles met in the Temple and offered up prayers for his recovery both day and night. However the Lord saw fit to take him to himself.\n\nPrest Jno Taylor and the Twelve became the first Presidency of the Church and gave general satisfaction to the people by their careful and straight forward course.\n\n1878: The year 1878 passed. away without any striking event. In the month of September Henry and myself started with our wagon and mules for the North. We went as far as Payson, left our team with Bro Jacob J. Walser and then traveled by Rail to S. L. City, stopping while there at the house of Sister Bathsheba W. Smith. I bought a Bill of goods for our St Geo C MI. and after Conference returned to Payson. We loaded up with flour and had Bro Daniel D McArthur to accompany us; he had just returned from a mission to Europe. After returning home, I commenced my two-storey building, laid a very good foundation and reared the first storey.\n\nIn February 1878 we revived the old Virgin ditch again, re-built the Tunnel and performed considerable work on the ditch that year. I bought 6 3/4 acres of land in the Virgin field and afterwards some 7 acres under the Clara Sepe ditch. 1879-80 In 1879 I raised some corn-fodder and several good crops of Lucern on my Tonaquint land. In the fall of 1879 I took another trip to S. L City; went with Wm B Pace as far as Juab Station, thence by Rail to S. L. City. Attended October Conference visited Bertha at American fork and bought a stock of Merchandise for St Geo C MI. Returned by Rail and stage.\n\nIn 1880 I raised some 60 bushels small grain about 50 bushels corn and considerable fodder and some lucern.\n\nIn the fall I again attended conference and bought a stock of Merchandise. Jan'y 1880 we had another son born, whom we named Jno Elias. He only lived until when he fell a victim to pneumonia.\n\nAfter I returned from S. L. City I commenced on the second storey of my house and by the blessings of the Lord succeeded in enclosing the building and finishing our parlor.\n\n1881: March 20th 1881 being the 50th anniversary of my wife Mary's birth we occupied our parlor for the first time, being honored with the company of Prest Wilford Woodruff, apostles B Young, F. M Lyman and Jno\n\nH Smith, also that of Geo Teasdale Prest of Juab Stake and Jno D T. McAllister Prest of St George, wife Ellen and daughter Mary. Bro W L Brundage wife and daughter Sarah were also with us.\n\nFeb'y 2d 1881 we had another son born whom we nan ed Wilford Woodruff. About November 1880 I traded off my mules for $600.00 Canaan Capital Stock and in January 1881 I bought a span of horses and harness of D H McAllister for $400.-00 Cash.\n\nMarch 19th and 20th we had our quarterly conference which was well attended and at which many valuable instructions were given. Thomas J Jones first Counselor to Prest McAllister was released from that position, as he had been called to preside over the Parov an Stake, Henry Eyring was chosen first Counselor and Daniel Duncan McArthur second counselor to Prest Mc-Allister. I was set apart to that office under the hands 4 of apostles Woodruff, Lyman and Smith and Prest Mc-Allister, Elder Woodruff being mouth, at a Stake Priest- j hood meeting held at 9 am. Sunday March 20th. During Conference my wife Mary was elected Stake Treasurer for the Relief Society also Pres't of the St George Stake Silk Association. She chose Sisters Annie C Woodbury and E. Z. B. Winsor for counselors. My wife Mary has been one of the regular Temple workers since 1877, also President of the 2nd Ward Relief Society since 1877 or 1878. And counselor to 1st. Minerva Snow Stake Pr. of Relief Society.\n\nDuring March Bro S. L. Adams made a start towards working the Grand Gulch Mine, obtained a Blower and y engine and feels confident of success.\n\nHe went to S. L City and brought word that the R R. would likely be extended at once in the direction of Cedar City and from there in all probability to Grand Gulch Mine, across the Colorado to connect with the Southern Pacific R R.\n\n1881 April 1st: Thomas J. Pearce, returning about 8 pm, from Washington in Company with James Andrus Nath. Ashby and A P. Hardy was thrown out of the carriage and instantly killed.

O. saw-mill at that place. Over exertion and anxiety wore on his body from that time on and within the last two years he gradually failed and finally succumbed.\n\n1882: Bro Nixon was a worthy man and although misunderstood by some, I believe that he was true to God and the principles of our holy religion.\n\nMarch 6th 1882: I was elected Mayor of St George City; Moroni Snow and Joseph Orton were Elected Aldermen and James G Blake, A W Junis, Horatio Pickett, A R Whitehead and Richard Morris Councilors.

Hancock died at Washington in the 80th year of his life.\n\nJune 12th Prest McAllister D D McArthur J G Blake, D H Cannon and myself went to Washington to attend the funeral. The meeting house was well filled and a good spirit prevailed. Bro Hancock had been a member of the First Presidency over all the Seventies since the Spring of 1835 and had always been true and faithful to the cause of Christ. He was chaplain in the Mormon Battalion, during the last 20 years he had lived in Dixie being most of the time in feeble health and unable to do much.\n\nDuring June we had two fine rains; the one in the last week of' June was very heavy causing floods and considerable damage to water-ditches.\n\nThe settlements of' Mesquit and Bunkerville suffered the most losing considerable grain and damaging their ditches and dams very seriously.\n\nJuly 5th another light shower refreshing the atmosphere.\n\n1882: July 22d My nephew Henry E. Bowman arrived from Silver Reef on a few days' visit.\n\nHe is a promising young man but has worked in the mines during the last 3 years which is no advantage to the moral development of the young or old.\n\nThe latter part of the year 1882 there was much sickness in St George, the measles especially making the rounds, Ida, Annie and Wilford were taken down, the two former soon recovering.\n\nWilford however was taken with a violent fever which `produced pneumonia in connection with the measles and terminated his life on Dec 31st 1882. He was a fine, promising child of an affectionate, kind spirit and much liked by the family. His death was a heavy blow to us all, yet we feel to acknowledge the hand of the Lord, even in this affliction.\n\n1883: January 1st 1883 was a sad day for us all. We held funeral services in the parlor and had a large attendance of friends to sympathize with us. Most excellent remarks were made by several of the brethren and a most heavenly influence prevailed.\n\nDuring the spring and summer my daughter Mary Louise became acquainted with Bro Andrew Thompson of Ephraim San Pete Co, who had been sent here to officiate in the Temple. He appears to be a promising young man. He asked for the hand of my daughter, obtaining my full consent.\n\nDuring July and August we had a few light showers at St George but many heavy rains in the adjacent mountains, North, East and S. East, causing floods and damage. The first damaging flood was July 5th corning down the Middleton wash and filling up about 100 rods of the Virgin ditch, also tearing out the Washing-ton Factory Reservoir Dam.\n\nJust as we had the ditch repaired, a flood in the latter part of July tore out the Virgin dam and it was not until Aug 5th that the water was back in the ditch.\n\nThe Washington field dam was also washed, so were the Jarvis Dam and Mesquit Settlement Dam; The Price Dam was only damaged and soon repaired.\n\nNow to return again to some previous events:\n\nIn October 1882 I visited again S. L. City, attending the Conference and purchasing a stock of goods for St George C. M. I. In Jan'y 1883 I went to Cedar City to attend a meeting of the Board of the S. U. C. U. The weather was very cold and as I went by stage and had to travel by night I suffered somewhat, although well wrapped up.\n\n1883: On Tuesday July 31st I went with Wm B Pace to his mine on the Beaver dam range of Mountains about 15 miles due west of St George, but 25 miles the way the road runs. Arriving there at 3 pm I climbed the mountains and looked over some of the prospects. On Wednesday a. m. I did the same, doing a good deal of climbing and any amount of sweating.\n\nIt is my opinion that there is a vast amount of minerals buried in the earth in that region, but whether it will pay to get them out will have to be proven in the future. On Wednesday Aug 1st 1883 pm we went to Gunlock, where I held a meeting with the people in their school-house in the evening, talking on political matters and exhorting the young people to diligence.\n\nOn Thursday Aug 2d returned as far as the Santa Clara Settlement where we held meeting in the evening, Bros T Judd and A R Whitehead meeting us from St George. We dwelt mostly on our political situation.\n\nOn Monday Aug 6th our Election passed off very quietly, a light vote only being polled, owing to the absence of a great many of our people. Many seek cooler regions during the summer, hence St George becomes a very dull town during the heated term.\n\nSunday August 12th 1883: Elders Edward Stevenson and Jacob Gates spoke to us at the Sabbath meeting and in the evening again at a meeting of Seventies. The 29th Quorum of Seventies was located in St George, with Samuel B Hardy senior President; John Pymm was also assigned to that quo-rum as one of the Presidents and Elders Franklin R. Snow and Franklin B. Woolley were ordained Seventies and assigned to the same Quorum.\n\nSunday Aug 26th Elders Henry W. Naisbitt and Wm Langton were with us giving us good, practical instructions.\n\nAug 29th 1883: Elder Jno W Young came down on a flying visit, re-turning Aug 30th. Henry E Bowman came over from Silver Reef on Mon-day evening the 27th and returned on the morning of the 30th.\n\nSept 4th Christian Iversen of Washington committed suicide by shooting. He had been guilty of adultery and his wife had concluded to leave him. The conviction of the enormity of his sin and the thought of losing his family were too much for him; consequently he put an end to his life.\n\n1883: Sept 7th Had our threshing done to-day; raised 75 bu of Barley mixed with rye.\n\nAn earthquake on the island of Java destroyed about 100, 000 people, mostly by inundations caused by tidal d waves.\n\nMade my annual visit to Salt Lake City in October.\n\nLeft St George by Stage on Friday Sept 28th reaching .0 Minersville on the 29th. Here I met James Lowe who took me to Beaver to attend the Conference. In the evening I addressed the Priesthood meeting and on Sunday forenoon the congregation. Hons Jno T Caine and Jno M Macfarland were also present and addressed the congregation.\n\nOn Monday I returned with James Lowe and reached Milford in the evening. Audited the Books of the Southern Utah Co-op Union and on the evening of Tuesday started by train for S L City.\n\n1883: Louise who traveled in company with Elders Charles Smith and Woodward to Milford joined me at that place and we got off at Provo on the morning of Wednesday. At that place we visited the Academy, also Sister Be-bee's and attended to some business for Sister Norton. At noon we left Provo by freight train and stopped at American Fork. We found Bertha and children in the enjoyment of good health and stayed over-night with them. I went to Salt Lake City on Thursday, Louise on Friday. Attended Conference and afterwards a number of meetings with the First Presidency the Twelve and Presidents of Stakes.\n\nMany valuable instructions were given and the word of wisdom was especially enjoined upon us.\n\nOct 11th we were invited to the endowment house, where we were told that a school of the Prophets would be organized and that only those who are willing to observe the word of wisdom and observe all other laws, God has given us, could be admitted. We were told to come again the next day, fasting and with our bodies washed clean.\n\nOct 12th 1883 was a day to be long remembered by all who partook of the blessings that were then bestowed upon us. Patriarch Zebedee Coltrin, who was the only surviving member of the school of the Prophets organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith at Kirtland washed the feet of President John Taylor and Prest Taylor in turn washed the feet of Zebedee Coltrin and then the feet of his Counselors, then of ten of the Apostles (Elders C C Rich and John H, Smith being absent the former sick, the latter presiding in England) then the feet of Counselor D H. Wells (J W Young absent) .\n\nAfter that the remaining brethren were seated according to age and Prest Taylor washed the feet of twenty of the Presidents of Stakes, of Jno. B. Maiben Counselor to Prest Canute Peterson, of myself and of Geo Reynold private Secretary to Prest Taylor. The ceremony used by Prest Taylor was about as follows: 'In the name of Jesus and by the authority of the holy priesthood I wash your feet in accordance with the pat-tern set by our Lord Jesus Christ when he washed his disciples feet and told them to wash each-others' feet, and also according to the pattern given by the Prophet Joseph Smith as an introductory ordinance to the School of the Prophets.\n\nI pronounce you clean from the blood of this generation and say unto you, your sins are forgiven you and I seal upon you every blessing, gift, right and authority pertaining to this holy ordinance and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\"\n\nAfter the washing of feet the Sacrament was administered, consisting of bread and wine. Of the latter we partook about one third of a Tumbler full each and of the former as much as our appetite would prompt us. After the sacrament we retired to a lower room and on returning were saluted by Pres't Taylor with the words prescribed in Section VII of the D. & C. Pres't Geo Q. Cannon in behalf of the members answered the salutation. We were then dismissed by prayer.\n\n1883: After returning home I found as usual a great deal of work awaiting me. I will state here that I bought a carriage in Salt Lake City and had Henry and Edward meet me at Milford with our team. Louise, who had taken a flying visit into San Pete reached Milford in time to return with us. We also had a little Swiss girl along, whom we delivered to Sister Schiess at Washington.\n\n1883: Dec. 15th and 16th we had our quarterly conference and had a most excellent time.

He was buried on the same day in the grave-yard.\n\nMarch 14th and 15th held our Quarterly Conference Apostle Erastus Snow and Prest Jno RMurdock being with us.\n\nThe Grand Jury at Beaver who met on the first Monday in Mch brought into court some 22 indictments, a portion of them for unlawful cohabitaion but none for polygamy.\n\nThe winter just past was the mildest I have known since living in the South, the thermometer ranging no lower than 20� during the entire winter.\n\nFore-part of March planted potatoes at Tonaquint, Mch 21st Beets, peas tomatoes, onions and on the 2d April carrots and some corn. Watered the ground first on April 1st.\n\n1885: Commenced cutting Lucern in the lot on March 31st being about half grown.\n\nThe pile-dam contemplated for a long time is being driven in a good locality near the Middleton crossing. April 1st apple trees in full bloom pear trees a little past full bloom, peach trees out of bloom and apricots the size of small hazelnuts. The prospect for fruit thus far is very good. Lucern is very early and by May 1st the first crop will be ready in the field.\n\nApril 5th rained about 15 hours penetrating the ground about 12 inches.\n\nApril 14th rained a number of showers soaking the ground 3 or 4 inches.

Bro Wm Fotheringham of Beaver was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and $300.00 fine for cohabitation with his wives.\n\nJune 1st Elders Jacob Gates and Edward Stevenson held a meeting with the Seventies in the evening in the East room of the Tabernacle basement. A number of young brethren were ordained Seventies with the 29th . Quorum.\n\nPres't Henry Harriman bore a strong testimony to the truth and said that soon after he joined the church he was ordained an Elder and on one occasion was called upon to preach. He felt his utter inability but when he rose he felt the power of God come upon him and there appeared before him at arm's length in large printed letters what he was to say and as he enunciated one sentence another would appear before him and he thus occupied about one hour, the whole of his sermon having been given to him in that manner.\n\nJune 2d the water reached the Rio Virgen middle field and my boys commenced to water; they killed a-bout 80 gophers while watering.\n\nJune 6th Ed d and A.

E. Talmage of the B Y. Academy. While the heat in July was not very extreme it became so in August, the Thermometer reaching 110�. Heavy rains fell on the 23d and 24th washing out Dams on the Rio Virgen and carrying 1/4 of the County bridge down stream. The river got around the north end of the pile dam making a gap 8 rods wide to be spanned. The cholera is raging in Spain carrying off nearly 2000 persons per day. Thus far over 72, 000 people have died or about 40% of all these, that were attacked. In January of the present year I commenced the study of the Spainish language, under the tutorship of Elder A W Ivins a returned missionary from Mexico.\n\nAugust 8th 1885: Memorial services in honor of General Grant were held in the St George Tabernacle.

McAllister.\n\n1887 Jan'y 27th The Raid against our people has now been in operation for over two years and there appears no prospect before us for any slackening in the efforts of our enemies.\n\n1887: The 2d Edmunds-Bill after having passed the Senate last session was amended and passed by the House on Jan'y 12th 1887, but the Senate rejected the amendments and a Conference Committee from both Houses have it now under consideration. It is believed that it will become law; if it does we shall soon be in a state of bondage and completely ruled by our enemies. Apostle Erastus Snow, who was laboring in Chihuahua, endeavoring to establish colonies of our people, ex-pressed a wish that I should come to Mexico to help him and the brethren. I therefore resolved to follow his recommendation and leaving my wife Mary and also Henry, Emily and Ida at St George, I started for Mexico, accompanied by my wife Deseret and by Edward C. Anna M and Andrew T. We left on February 10th 1887 and reached the old camp of Colonia Juarez on April 8.

Wm L. Brundage. We rested for 2 or 3 days and visited old friends. It was quite warm the thermometer reaching 90�. Bro Eli Whipple and a portion of his family were our traveling companions. The trip was expensive, as we had to buy water for our teams in a good many places and being on the road for 8 weeks it consumed considerable grain.\n\nWhen we reached Camp Juarez we were kindly received by the brethren and sisters and moved into a temporary house which Bro Snow had erected. He himself was absent. Bp Wm Maughan from Wellsville Cache Co was there on a visit. 1 renewed my acquaintance with, we having crossed the Atlantic together returning from Europe in 1878.\n\nOur provisions having become exhausted, we were unable to obtain suitable food and lived principally on beans, without grease or meat, seasoned with a little red pepper.\n\n1887: Edward, after staying with us a short time returned, with a view to earn some means in the U S.\n\nBro Ammon Rappleyea"
