        "text": "A very strange thing happened last month, and I never thought to write it down till just now. Some Mormon missionary sisters came to my home at about 9am, and I was bored enough to chat with them, having completed all my housework in a whirlwind of activity between 7am and 8:30am. They finally invited me to attend church, with the understanding that I'm Jewish and would not be converting; though they did look smug enough that I'm sure they felt I would change my mind. I said I would attend their sacrament meeting in the interest of fostering tolerance, if they would attend my synagogue's services the Friday night afterward. To my surprise, they agreed.\n\nI didn't mention to them that I'd attended a sacrament meeting before this occasion, so they were obsessed with letting me know how to behave; I found it amusing enough that I just let them ramble. Don't wear trousers, if I have a skirt (which I do). Don't wear anything low-cut, or sleeveless (Fine by me, I'm a modest person.) Don't eat the bread or drink the water at sacrament (I wouldn't). Those things were useful to know, if I hadn't already known from my own religious teachings and/or sensibilities.\n\nThen they got personal. I shouldn't talk during services, but if I had a question about something that was happening right then, I could ask them quietly. I shouldn't get up and leave during services unless it was an emergency. I should be especially polite with the bishop, the stake president, and the mission president. I started to think that maybe they thought I was some sort of barbarian, since these things are second nature to me, and I wouldn't have had to be told. What in the world do they think non-Mormons are? But I let them go on, because it was still fairly amusing to wonder what they thought I'd behave like if they didn't teach me how to behave.\n\nThe service was what you'd expect. Lifeless singing, a few people bearing testimonies in generic terms, sacrament, prayer with people crossing arms over stomachs as if they had nausea or gas (or were throwing silent tantrums), more lifeless singing. The sermon was a bit interesting, though, as the stake president assured everyone that the Mormons were practicing the religion and the rites that were practiced in Solomon's temple. I didn't notice 'my' pet missionaries taking it with any amusement, so I restrained myself. They apparently felt it was entirely true, and that when they came to synagogue with me the following Friday, they would recognize everything they saw.\n\nPrivately I didn't think they'd actually show up, but sure enough, they had given their word and they made it. There were telephone calls ahead of time as the two sisters wondered what they should wear (anything you'd wear to your church), how they should behave (just like you would in church), who was especially important (... uh... everyone), whether they could ask questions during the service (of course, softly, like you would in church). Should they wear their name tags? Actually, that question did give me pause, since I didn't want synagogue members to think I had brought them there to proselytize everyone. In the end, I told them to follow their own consciences and not get in trouble because of mission rules; but that they should introduce themselves by first and last name if anyone asked, and say that they were there only to learn.\n\nThey wore the name tags, dressed appropriately enough, showed up on time, sat right with me. I usually sit near the front so I can hear a little better, but this time I sat with them near the back so that they could see what other people were doing. They had questions every other breath, mostly what the Hebrew prayers meant; I pointed (every single blessed time) to the English translation right below the Hebrew. They looked nervous the entire time.\n\nWhen the service ended, we went outside and I offered to walk them home and ask questions. Finally they said, \"It wasn't anything like sacrament meeting.\" I told them I knew. \"Don't Jews practice the Solomonic rites?\" Uh... since in Solomon's times there were animal sacrifices, and since we no longer have a Holy Temple at which to conduct them, no one actually practices rites that took place in Solomon's times. One of them hesitated and then said, \"This service wasn't anything like the temple.\" The other one shushed her rather rapidly, but the first one persisted to ask, \"Is it okay to ask what the other rites are that you practice?\" What other rites? \"The ones in your temples.\" There was only one temple, and it was destroyed. \"The... sacred rites.\" Oh. Now I was sure they were asking whether we had secret rites, so I told them: We don't have any secret rites. Everything that Jews do is knowable by anyone who happens to be at the synagogue when it's being done. \"Even non-Jews? Even visitors?\" Of course.\n\nThey left, dumbstruck. They haven't called again. I wonder what they're thinking. Glass-Houses wrote:\n\nFrom a story of Leonard Nimoy's, I thought there was one secret rite in Jewish ritual. He said there was one part of a ceremony where the congregation was told not to look, but as a child he peeked and saw the rabbis holding up their hands with the fingers separated--hence the \"Vulcan Salute.\"\n\nThat's not a secret ritual, because everyone knows about it. Also, at some point in their lives, most people do peak -- usually as children, so it's not considered all that serious. It happens during the Birkat Kohanim, also called the Priestly Blessing. The kohanim (kohein = priests), direct descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, are called to the front of the congregation and stand on the bimah (raised area at the front). There, they cover their heads with their prayer shawls and stretch out their hands in the shape of the Hebrew letter Shin (*sigh* The Vulcan salute), signifying one of the names of God. So standing, they sing the Birkat Kohanim found in Numbers 6:24-26, in Hebrew. The rest of the congregation either covers their eyes with their hands or prayer shawls, or trusts their self-control to look at the floor, their shoes, the prayer book, or something else; and when it's over, they say \"Kein, y'hi ratzon,\" which is, \"Yes, may it be willed [by God].\"\n\nEVERYONE knows this happens. It's not a secret. It's like, oh, I don't know, naked people. When you first find out that females and males look different naked, you try to imagine it, and probably fail. Should the opportunity present itself, you look, and then you spend years not looking, and then you look some more (with better permissions, one hopes). But the knowledge is always there, and you can think about it all you want, and if you do see what you think of as this big secret thing it's no great crime.\n\nThe reason people are told not to watch the kohanim when they are delivering the priestly benediction is simply because one should concentrate on the words being said, and not on the individuals who are saying them. It's the same reason we close our eyes when saying the Sh'ma (Hear, Israel: YHVH our God, YHVH is one). It begins with the word Hear, not with the word See, and we're meant to hear the words and concentrate on them, not to look around and be distracted by the other people around us.\n\nAlso, I wonder, but am too lazy to look up, when they abandoned the practice of making women sit in the back (if, in orthodox tradition, they ever did.) Sitting in the back, in some places behind a screen, must have made at least part of the services seem secret to women.\n\nThe Orthodox never abandoned the tradition of separating the genders. Some Conservative and Reconstructionist congregations also separate the genders, while Reform congregations almost never do. However, please note that in many/most congregations, the women's section isn't behind the men's section, but beside it. Women and men are separated from each other, not one gender separated from the religious services. In fact, in my Orthodox synagogue, the synagogue is separated right down the middle, and the mechitza (dividing 'wall') isn't even waist-high to me when I'm standing up. It's a reminder to focus on the prayers, not on the attractive person on the other side of the wall.\n\nAnd by the way, it also keeps the single members of the congregation from standing out too much and looking all alone, which is a benefit that mixed-seating congregations have chosen to overlook. In mixed congregations, anyone who doesn't have someone to sit next to is singled out, but in separate-seating congregations, they have everyone else there to sit with, without 'intruding' on a family situation.\n\nAlso, was animal sacrifice entirely abandoned after the destruction of the temple? Weren't they still selling doves and things as sacrifices even in Jesus' day? Thanks for the interesting post.\n\nRemember, the Holy Temple wasn't destroyed until the year 70 of the Current Era, at least 40 years after the death of Jesus (if he indeed lived, which I'm not prepared to debate for or against). Yes, of course they were selling doves and other animals as sacrifices in the time in which Jesus (allegedly?) lived, and for another forty years after he died. Also, even after the Temple was destroyed, there was a sect which continued to sacrifice near the former Temple site, the Shomronim (Samaritans). To this day, the Samaritans can be found making Passover sacrifices there. The majority of Judaism, however, abandoned animal sacrifices immediately when the Temple was destroyed, and will not reinstate the sacrifices until and unless the Temple is rebuilt in the Messianic age.\n\nThanks for reading, Glass-Houses. I don't know that my post itself was so interesting, but all the replies certainly have been!\n\nDana Terrasanct wrote:\n\nI don't think the sister mishies were twits at all, as someone said. They were very brave to go against their conditioning. I can't imagine two elders would have done the same. The maturity difference between the elders and the sisters is often staggering.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Part of my point, which I probably didn't emphasize nearly enough, was that those two sisters actually kept their word after I went to their church. They had no reason to come to synagogue, since they'd already gotten me to church, which was all they wanted.\n\nYet they did in fact come, and were very concerned about behaving appropriately and with respect to the setting and people. They probably had to answer for it later, too, since they went to a non-Mormon house of worship, and they were there for two hours during a time when they could have been proselytizing, as is their mission priority. They were curious, and asked questions rather than sit there dumbly thinking about other matters; they really did pay attention. After the service, they asked more questions, and really did seem to be looking closely at things they'd been taught.\n\nWhether they find their way out of the cult isn't something I'll ever know, and in truth, I'm not as concerned about it, as long as they stay happy within it. I'm just impressed that they took a learning opportunity instead of letting it pass them by, and that they will probably be thinking more clearly about what they're taught. Maybe at some point someone will say something ridiculous, and instead of nodding and smiling, maybe these two sisters will think, \"Well, he doesn't know everything. He's just a man, after all, and human beings make mistakes.\" That realization alone is worth a thousand repetitions of \"Follow the prophet and the authorities, and they will never lead you astray.\"\n\nDana Good job with the lady mishies, Dana. It always amuses me when a Mormon repeats the \"Mormon temple rites are the same ones practiced in ancient Israel\" nonsense. Particularly since the Mormon rite is built around characters such as Jesus, Peter James & John, and Lucifer, who were unknown in ancient Judaism. Not to mention all the exclusively modern Mormon features of the endowment, which could not possibly have been part of any ancient rituals. And the ancient Hebrew temple rites are spelled out in great detail in the Old Testament, and they bear no resemblance whatsoever to the Mormon rites.\n\nOf course, the Mormon \"party line\" says that Freemasonry is the \"corrupted\" version of the ancient Hebrew temple rite, and that is why the Mormon endowment is so similar to Masonic rites. However, that idea is impossible, since modern Masonic rites which Joseph Smith borrowed from were first invented in medieval times:\n\n\"The traditional origin of Freemasonry (which 'enlightened' Masons view as mythological or legendary) is the construction of Solomon's temple by Master Mason Hiram Abiff. Actually, Freemasonry was a development of the craft guilds during the construction of the great European cathedrals during the tenth to seventeenth centuries. After the Middle Ages, lodges in Scotland and Great Britain began to accept honorary members and worked out rudimentary ceremonies to distinguish members of trade organizations. In 1717 four fraternal lodges, perhaps actual masons' lodges, united as the Grand Lodge ofE ngland, considered the beginning of organized Freemasonry or 'speculative Masonry.' The order spread quickly to other countries and included such prominent adherents as Mozart, Voltaire, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin. Some historians believe that Masons staged the Boston Tea Party. Latter-day Saints may feel that Masonry constitutes a biblical-times source of uncorrupted knowledge from which the temple ceremony could be drawn. However, historians of Freemasonry generally agree that the trigradal system of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, as practiced in Nauvoo, cannot be traced further back than the eighteenth century.\n\nAccording to Douglas Knoop and G. P. Jones, two knowledgeable twentieth-century historians, it is 'highly probable' that the system of Masonry practiced at the organization of the Grand Lodge in London 'did not consist of three distinct degrees.' They warn, 'It would probably not be safe to fix a date earlier than 1723 or 1725 for the origin' of the trigradalsystem. 'Accepted Masonry underwent gradual changes throughout a period of years stretching from well before 1717 to well after that date.... The earliest speculative phase of Freemasonry may be regarded as beginning about 1730.... Though some symbolism had doubtless crept into Masonry by that date, it would not appear to have reached its full development for another forty or fifty years.' \"\n\n(\"The Mysteries of Godliness: A History of Mormon Temple Worship,\" pp. 45-46.)"
