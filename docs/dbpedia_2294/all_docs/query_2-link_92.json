        "text": "But when her break from Mormonism came, it called everything into question, including the origin stories of this 19th-century American religious movement, the institutionalised homophobia and the hefty time and financial commitments.\n\nEach year the Church reports to the charities’ regulator that it raises close to $100 million in Australia through a charitable trust fund, with nearly all of that thought to be income from tithes. It is an impressively large sum for a religion with only about 60,000 adherents in Australia, according to the Census.\n\nYet it is not all it seems. An investigation by The Age and Sydney Morning Herald has revealed that the Church may have engaged in a tax evasion, allowing its adherents to collect exemptions not lawfully available to followers of other religions.\n\nAustralia is unusual among English-speaking countries in that it does not allow tax deductions for tithing or church donations. Instead, it allows generous deductibility for charitable giving. The church appears to have structured itself to maximise that tax benefit through payments of $70 million a year through a charity with no paid staff.\n\nIt has meant Mormons have been able to draw on $400 million in tax write-offs since 2015. There are serious questions about whether this is permissible, although a Church spokesman insists it complies with Australian tax laws and runs the charity from Australia, as required by the law.\n\nThat $70 million a year in donations is completely out of step with what Mormons give in other countries, including the United States, where it has more than six million followers. It is also in stark contrast with what the Church said they had given previously from Australia, a total of $900,000 between 1985 and 2010.\n\nGiven’s experience of the LDS Church - along with other senior ex-Mormons interviewed for this piece - was one where charitable giving was limited. “As far as helping people who were actually in need, there’s just not a lot of that happening. The Mormon Church isn’t providing soup kitchens, homeless shelters and the kind of aid which some other churches do,” she says.\n\nA Church spokesman said it had been able to boost charitable spending from Australia as “there was a desire and the ability to significantly increase the support”. They did not elaborate further.\n\nAround the world the Church has extensive business interests, including shopping malls and some of the biggest farms in the United States. In 2020, it also emerged that the Church ran an investment fund, Ensign Peak Advisors, with more than $US100 billion ($133 billion) in assets, generating substantial tax-free returns.\n\nIt was not always so. In the 19th century the Church was chased out of much of the United States and took up arms against the federal government. It settled, after a great migration, in frontier Utah, where it supported polygamy.\n\nUniversity of Tampa professor of sociology Ryan Cragun, an expert on Mormonism who grew up in the religion, said the Church was vastly different then than it is today.\n\n“Nineteenth-century Mormonism has polygamy, they still drink alcohol, they had all sorts of weird practices … that all shifts with the end of polygamy, and then kind of the formalisation of the ‘Word of Wisdom’, which is, you know, no drinking coffee, no alcohol, no tea, no smoking, all of that,” he says.\n\nBy the mid-20th century - and till today - it represents a kind of all-American wholesomeness with its fresh-faced, clean-cut, suited missionaries. “And if you look at it, it’s very much like a middle-class corporate church in an American Salt Lake City kind of way.”\n\nCragun says Church leaders live comfortably but all this wealth - the $US100 billion investment fund, the tax minimisation - is not about personal enrichment. Rather, he suspects, it’s about long-term corporate planning.\n\nMany of its current leaders - called apostles - have backgrounds in senior positions from the corporate world and run the Church as a business, he says.\n\n“My sense is they know what’s coming. As far as secularisation goes, they’re losing young people in droves. They’re not really getting any converts in Australia or New Zealand, or most of Western Europe at this point. Even Eastern Europe, they’re not getting anybody, Africa, OK, they’re doing OK there. But even in South America, they’ve kind of mined that,” he says.\n\n”My sense is they’re reading the tea leaves saying… that donating members are going to begin to shrink. How are we going to maintain all the properties that we own, all the stuff that we’re doing?“\n\nHe surmises that the “massive war chest” is designed to allow them to “just live off the revenue from that indefinitely into the future, that’s my best interpretation”.\n\nCragun says Mormons were unusual in how much they paid in tithing. A North American study showed they paid more than 7 per cent of their income in tithes - slightly less than they are meant to, but a “stunningly high” amount compared to other religions.\n\nThere are no comparable figures for the Church in Australia, but its financial accounts indicate that local Mormons are paying a high rate of tithing.\n\nThere is considerable pressure on Mormons to pay tithes, he says, and once a year, they are required to meet with their bishop. This tithing settlement is important, determining, essentially, whether they are in good standing and can be recommended to go to Temple, an important step in the path to the afterlife.\n\nDespite the large financial commitment, another feature of Mormonism, Cragun claims, is how little the Church spends on charity; less than 1 per cent of its income (based on its own previously publicly released figures).\n\nIt makes a situation like Australia - where tithing is not tax-deductible - tricky for the Church. Without the tax benefit, individual Mormons here would be substantially worse off financially than Mormons in the US, Britain or Canada.\n\nCragun suggests that the Church may “milk the system for every tax deduction they can, which is why you’re seeing this.\n\n“Getting a spokesperson to admit that is probably impossible... because that makes them look very ungenerous.“\n\nMike Perritt was born into the Church and became its national emergency response coordinator, working with the Red Cross and other agencies. He’d regularly work 25 hours a week on Church activities.\n\n“To retain its tax status as a charity or religion it has to give money to charities, but it doesn’t like to do that,” he says.\n\nNow in his sixties, he left the Church in 2015 as he believed its origin stories were based on “fraudulent claims”. He had paid almost $400,000 in tithes.\n\nPerritt says he saw many people on low incomes struggle to afford the tithes and that tithing dropped off when tax deductibility was reduced to 75 per cent for a time. “The Church is very focused on its wealth, it always has been,” he says.\n\nThe Church’s tax practices have resulted in a complaint being lodged last year with the Australian Charities and not-for-profits Commission. The regulator is legally prevented from providing information on the status of its response - if any - to complaints.\n\nSenior ex-Mormon Simon Southerton alleges that the Church is involved in tax evasion through its practices. He is quick to note that it is the Church hierarchy and not ordinary Mormons who are to blame for any claimed tax evasion.\n\n“Mormons are encouraged to be honest and truthful in their dealings. It’s just dishonest, to make it look like the Church is so extremely charitable when it’s not,” he says. “I don’t blame ordinary Mormons here … this smacks of US lawyers exploiting legal loopholes to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian government.”\n\nBarrister Neville Rochow, QC, was until 2018 the Church’s representative to the European Union and served as a bishop and in stake (similar to an archdiocese) and missionary presidencies.\n\nHe converted in his teens and served in missions in Tasmania and later Germany, where he met his wife. The church had many positives for him: “I came from a fairly dysfunctional childhood and was really looking for a way to have a happy family.”\n\nRochow says he was “so bloody faithful” and was seen “as a repository of all knowledge on doctrine”. “I was their pin-up boy; I was respectable and had letters after my name. The Church would trot me out when they needed someone respectable that could talk with anyone about anything.”\n\nHe spoke at the House of Lords, the European Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights. “[The Church] opened a lot of doors for us, we derived a lot of benefit from it.”\n\nYet when he returned to Australia from Europe in 2018 he experienced a loss of faith, after extensive reading and his wife being diagnosed with cancer.\n\n“For the first time, instead of just going on ‘in faith’ and accepting explanations we were fed, I extended the principle of following where the evidence led,” he said. “We soon both realised that it was, to use the vernacular, a load of crap. There was barely a single claim that withstood objective scrutiny.”\n\nHe is speaking out now due to what he claims is the Church’s financial engineering. “I don’t have any resentment or anger at all but I do not want any church to benefit from fraud of the Tax Commissioner of any kind. I don’t think that’s right.”\n\nSue Given is also angry at the perceived tax practices of the Church. She joined a US class action to reclaim the tithing she paid over decades, which she said was not voluntary.\n\n“My husband is a lot more positive than me. He sees the positives in Mormonism’s focus on family and I could agree with those positives if they indeed applied to all families, including LGBTQ+,” she says. “As a family we have never been closer or happier than we are now, out of the Church.”"
