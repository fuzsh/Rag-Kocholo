        "text": "In this episode, Skyler is joined by Dr. Ed Romine to review and respond to LDS President Russell M. Nelson’s April 2024 General Conference talk “Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys”.\n\nCorrection/Clarification: I brought up the 1838 First Vision Account, and then made the comparative point with the other accounts in a way that wasn’t as clear as it should've been. More technically, I should have said JSH-1, which includes the First Vision account. The Elijah portion quoted, which was also placed in D&C 2 in 1876, comes from the “Moroni” visit of JSH-1 (notice: not Nephi), and, similarly, that portion is also a part that is not mentioned in the other accounts of Nephi/Moroni.\n\nMoreover, the Sept. 23, 1823 Moroni-visit may more accurately be called the “First Vision” depending on how one argues the dating of what they now call the First Vision (wherein he claims to see God, the Father and Jesus Christ). If the dating is 1820, it would be prior to the Moroni visit in 1823, but would also have a social context that is anachronistic; if 1825, then the context of revival would be fitting, yet it would obviously date to after the Moroni visit.\n\n“Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys” by Russell M.

Howlett\n\nNOTE (from an earlier episode): Who is Elias? What is the spirit of Elijah? Malachi's Prophecy and John's Fulfillment -\n\nThough in the Bible Elias and Elijah are the same person, with just a difference in the transliteration of the name - Joseph Smith claimed they were different people, and that they (both) appeared to him. In other words, Elias is simply the Greek form of the OT prophet Elijah's Hebrew name. They are the same person. Yet, according to Joseph Smith, they are two different people who both appeared to him.\n\nTeachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp. 335-338; D&C 110\n\nWhy did Moses, Elias, and Elijah appear in the Kirtland Temple? (Notice the footnotes on Elias)\n\nNot only do LDS see the coming of Elijah as actually fulfilled in the Kirtland Temple (though some, including a Mormon prophet outside the LDS church, dispute this) - but they connect the \"spirit of Elijah\" to temple work (including vicarious rituals for the dead). One irony about this is that John (who is biblically associated with Elijah and the prophecy of Malachi) is born to parents of a priestly lineage (of Aaron) - and yet, one of the LDS distinctives is that the Aaronic priesthood is unable to do sealings, and thus, John would not have qualified in their system.\n\nThe Malachi prophecy that the Bible teaches as fulfilled in John the Baptist preparing the way for The Lord features in a key place in Joseph Smith's story (JSH 1. 38-39, D&C 2:1-2); and the spirit of Elijah is described in ways linked to genealogy and temple work, such as: \"Elijah would restore the sealing powers so families could be sealed together. He would also inspire people to be concerned about their ancestors and descendants.\" (here, here also here)\n\nYet, Jesus says this prophecy of Elijah/Elias (who are one and the same) was fulfilled in John the Baptist. (Matt. 11. 13, 17.12-13). In fact, the prophecy - including the language about turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and vice versa (language of covenant, and covenant-faithfulness, in context) - is literally stated by the angel Gabriel to Zechariah in Luke 1:13-17 to be about the mission of John, specifically.\n\nMoreover, Luke's presentation of John the Baptist fulfilling prophecy in 3.4-5 is changed by Joseph Smith in order to make these verses about events associated with the second coming. (JST Luke 3, D&C 49.23)\n\nEven the utilization of the ministry of Elijah by Jesus in Luke 4 (where Jesus reads from Isaiah 61) is likewise obfuscated in Mormon teaching - since they have historically treated Isaiah 61 as about liberating spirits from spirit prison (also linked to their temple rituals). (here, D&C 128, D&C 138) Harrell states, relative to this, \"Of course, in Mormonism it is more than hearing the gospel that delivers spirits from spirit prison.\" And \"In current LDS discourse on salvation for the dead, Isaiah 61.1-2 is interpreted almost exclusively as having reference to the liberation of spirits from spirit prison, or hell, into paradise once the living perform saving ordinances on their behalf.\" (p.344)\n\nMormonism and the Magic World View by D. Michael Quinn\n\nTemple Made With Hands? (Jason Wallace)\n\n\"Most modern KJV's follow the revision made by Benjamin Blayney in 1769.\" (There was the original 1611, the 1612, 1613, 1616, 1629, 1638 - and then in 1769 Cambridge Edition of Benjamin Blayley; The King James Only Controversy by James White, pp. 124-126; also see p. 288, and footnote 13 on that page) On the LDS version of the KJV - \"Leaders took steps in the early 1970s to produce their own edition of the KJV that would fill such desires, completing the effort in 1979...[Their] new Bible boasts seven major features distinguishing it from other editions of the KJV...\" (Mormons and the Bible by Philip Barlow, pp. 227-228, also here)\n\nGod's Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible by Adam Nicolson\n\nIn the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How it Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture by Alister McGrath\n\nIn this episode, Skyler interviews Dr. James Renihan about his book Confessing the Impassible God: The Biblical, Classical, & Confessional Doctrine of Divine Impassibility.\n\nThe LDS have historically rejected any notion of any god being “without body, parts, or passions.” This teaching was even explicitly identified as a Luciferian deception through the character of a Reformed Minister (called a “hireling of Satan”) in the LDS temple until 1990 (also here). Today, we ask Dr. James Renihan if the doctrine of Divine Impassibility is what the Bible actually teaches, what Christians have historically believed – and why Christianity must confess One God “without body, parts, or passions.”\n\nJames Renihan lectures:\n\n\"God Before the Beginning”\n\n“The Eternal God’s Eternal Love”\n\n“The Trinity: The Foundation of Our Faith”\n\nAlso mentioned were his books:\n\nFaith and Life for Baptists: The Documents of the London Particular Baptist General Assemblies, 1689-1694\n\nA Toolkit For Confessions: Symbolics 101 – Helps for the Study of English Puritan Confessions of Faith\n\nAgainst the Gods by John Currid\n\nAll That Is In God by James Dolezal\n\nThe Suffering of the Impassible God by Paul Gavrilyuk\n\nChristianity and Classical Culture by Jaroslav Pelikan\n\nBrigham Young: 10.192 ; 13.309\n\nJohn Taylor: JD 14.267-70\n\nLDS Temple transcript: here and here\n\n“Strange Creeds of Christendom” by LeGrand Richards\n\n“The Only True God and Jesus Christ Whom He Hath Sent” by Jeffrey Holland\n\nThe Great Apostasy; Jesus the Christ by James Talmage\n\nThe Truth, The Way, The Life: An Elementary Treatise on Theology by B.H. Roberts\n\nThe God Who Weeps; Wrestling the Angel by Terryl Givens\n\nBrigham Young clearly taught that “the God that I serve is progressing eternally, and so are his children: they will increase to all eternity, if they are faithful.” (JD 11.286) However, there has been some voices to the contrary, though still stated within a context which accepts eternal progression (i.e. gods becoming gods by obedience to law, acquisition of knowledge, etc, etc)\n\nCompare President Wilford Woodruff and Elder Bruce R. McConkie on the question of eternal progression:\n\n\"If there was a point where man in his progression could not proceed any further, the very idea would throw a gloom over every intelligent and reflecting mind. God himself is increasing and progressing in knowledge, power, and dominion, and will do so, worlds without end. It is just so with us. We are in a probation, which is a school of experience.\" (Wilford Woodruff, JD 6.120)\n\n\"Now may I suggest the list of heresies. Heresy one: There are those who say that God is progressing in knowledge and is learning new truths. This is false - utterly, totally, and completely. There is not one sliver of truth in it.\" (Bruce R. McConkie; Seven Deadly Heresies; Notice the condemnation of earlier men of higher church-rank then himself - including but not limited to Presidents/Prophets Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff.)\n\nEven Orson Pratt, in his \"confession\" and \"apology\" for opposing Brigham Young on the eternal progression of even the highest gods, stated that “[w]e are told that every God will continue to progress in knowledge to all ages of eternity; and we are told this by the highest authority on the earth.” (the line was in the original sermon, edited out of JD 7.371-76, but see Conflict in the Quorum by Gary Bergera, p.163. To see more context on the issue, Bergera's book is well-worth reading.)\n\nGiven recent coverage of MMP in the news, including two interviews with historians of Mormonism, Skyler and Colin give their immediate reaction to what they see as PR-Mormonism obfuscating the point and purpose of the doctrine. With all due respect, these historians either should know better - or at least be interested in knowing better!\n\nWhy would any LDS believe MMP, to begin with? Are there any historical and theological reasons to believe it? Do people believe it in spite of Mormonism, or because of Mormonism? Is it only extreme crazy-people and/or criminals who would believe it?\n\nPlease note the correction below.\n\nTo get the most out of this interview, one may consult these two interviews (at least the indicated time stamps) prior to hearing our discussion:\n\n\"Are Chad and Lori Daybell's beliefs in line with LDS teachings? Religious expert explains.\" (East Idaho News); especially timestamp: 26:22-28:33\n\n\"LDS Historian on Chad Daybell Beliefs\" (Hidden True Crime); especially timestamp: 1:03:00-1:15:34\n\nAlso, of interest, e.g.:\n\nLori Vallow's cousin (who is himself a \"faithful LDS\", currently!) is also open to the doctrine\n\nAs well as the straw man of the doctrine presented by Melanie Gibb (1:01:15f)\n\nSunstone\n\nCorrection: Orson F. Whitney was bishop of the 18th Ward, not the 19th Ward. Also, I mentioned the Improvement Era as a source. I had conflated some sources in my memory and misstated this piece of evidence. The Improvement Era article in mind was “A Lesson from the Book of Job” in November 1918. The term is not here.\n\nThe source that was in mind is from Orson’s Saturday Night Thoughts, in which he cites an author named Maeterlinck. He mentions how a play of his “inspired mind” was Mormon in its understanding. However, it is actually in a different play of Maeterlinck, The Mountain Path, that the term “expiations” was used. Given Orson F. Whitney’s own views, it is an interesting connection – though clearly not as direct as was stated in the episode. I apologize for the error.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Orson cites Eliza R. Snow, who –in her works in their totality - are evidence of MMP, in both citations above.\n\nThe hypocrisy of calling out historians on details while getting a few wrong myself is not lost on me. However, I hope these couple details don’t detract from the overall reaction toward this pattern of historian-minimization that I was so critical of in this episode.\n\nIn this series, Brendon and Skye are going through the book Crisis of Confidence by Carl Trueman.
