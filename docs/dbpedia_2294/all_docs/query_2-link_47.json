        "text": "The Mormon church has said for the first time that its founder Joseph Smith had up to 40 wives.\n\nIn an essay published on its website, external quoting \"careful estimates\", the church said the wives included a 14-year-old and others who were already married.\n\nThe Mormon church banned polygamy in 1890 and now excommunicates anyone who practises it.\n\nThe church has previously sought to portray Smith as loyal to his first wife Emma.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time that the church has admitted his polygamy, as previously reported here.\n\nThe essay, entitled Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo, said: \"Joseph married many additional wives and authorised other Latter-day Saints to practise plural marriage.\"\n\nIt said \"plural marriage was difficult for all involved\"; for Emma it was an \"excruciating ordeal\"."
