        "text": "John Fowlke was born 26 December 1803, in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England. He was the son of John Fowlke and Hannah Mee. A history of John Fowlke states: \"John Fowlke was the son of John Fowlke and Hannah Mee, the eighth child in a family of twelve children. He was a wood turner by trade while residing in England. He married Harriet Raynor June 14, 1823 in Nottingham, England.\" (Life History of John Fowlke, II; www.fowlkefamily.org)\n\nJohn married Harriet Raynor in 1823 in Nottingham. Harriet Raynor was born in Nottingham on 10 September 1803, the daughter of Catherine Frost Raynor. Eleven children were born to John and Harriet in Nottingham: Catherine Elizabeth, John, Harriet, Drucilla, Eliza, Emma, William, Louisa, Frederick, Sarah, and Clara. Harriet and Emma died before becoming adults.\n\nThe Fowlkes are found in the 1841 census in Snenton, Nottinghamshire (Sneinton is a southeastern suburb of Nottingham):\n\nJohn Fowkes, age 35, occupation - turnerHarriott, age 35Elizabeth, age 15, lace menderJohn, age 15, ap turnerHarrott, age 13, lace menderDrucilla, age 11, lace menderEliza, age 9William, age 3Louisa, age 1\n\nThey are found in the 1851 census in Nottingham:\n\n1851 English census, Nottingham\n\nThe Fowlke family are found at 34 Island Street in St. Mary's parish, Nottingham in the 1851 census. The census shows:\n\nJohn Fowlke, head, married, 50, Engeneer, born in Nottingham\n\nHarriett Fowlke, wife, married, 49, born in Nottingham\n\nElizabeth Fowlke, daughter, 26, Lace mender, born in Nottingham\n\nDrucilla Fowlke, daughter, 20, Lace mender, born in Nottingham\n\nWilliam Fowlke, son, 15, Coach builder, born in Nottingham\n\nLoisa Fowlke, daughter 11, Lace mender, born in Nottingham\n\nFredrick Fowlke, son, 8, scholar, born in Nottingham\n\nSarah Fowlke, daughter, 6, scholar, born in Nottingham\n\nClara Fowlke, daughter, 3, scholar, born in Nottingham\n\nA history of John Fowlke describes how the family was converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints: \"The gospel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was brought to the attention of John and Harriet by their daughter Louisa. Several members of the family joined the church. Louisa joined the church on Dec 7, 1854. John and three other children were baptized on February 24, 1855.\" (Life History of John Fowlke, II; www.fowlkefamily.org) This caused some division in the family: \"Three other children, Catherine Elizabeth, John, and William remained in England. John and William were engineers. They refused to have anything to do with the family after they joined the church. They were both strong and powerful men. One of them whipped the wrestling champ in a fight in a public house.\" (Life History of John Fowlke, II; www.fowlkefamily.org)\n\nA history of Clara Fowlke shares these details of their conversion: \"One of the girls when going home from work passed by the place the Mormon missionaries held their meetings. She was attracted by the Elders' singing. It so impressed her that each evening she tried to be present when the Mormon meeting was conducted so that she might learn and listen to their singing and teachings. Someone who knew her folks told them of seeing her there and warning them of the Elders. Her parents then tried to stop her from going to these meetings but she was so enthused she attended anyway. Deciding that if she insisted on going, she must not go alone, they sent a sister along with her. When they returned, this sister, too, was as much impressed as the first. Other sisters went and finally the mother was persuaded to accompany them to the meetings. She, too, could feel the truthfulness of the things spoken by the elders. Her husband, however, could not be persuaded to attend with them, but one day they invited the elders to their home. There he met the elders and he, too, was converted to the truthfulness of this everlasting gospel.\" (James and Clara Fowlke Cullimore -- Brief History, on familysearch.org) Later in her life Clara said, \"I am very thankful that some kind elder took the gospel to my parents, which was the means of my coming to this goodly land, the land which the Lord wished the saints to gather to, and that I have raised my family here, and for this I am very thankful.\" (James and Clara Fowlke Cullimore -- Brief History, on familysearch.org)\n\nClara's story also tells about her early life, and the need to work as a child: \"At the age of six, Clara started to work in a lace and bead factory. She received 12 cents per week wages and became very skilled at her work. While still very young she would take her sister's place as overseer in her sister's absence.\" (James and Clara Fowlke Cullimore -- Brief History, on familysearch.org) Her brother Frederick said, \"the Fowlke men would leave for work in the morning, before daylight, and would return home after dark.\" (Life History of Frederick Fowlke) The entire family worked hard to support themselves. The Latter-Day Saint missionaries contacted the family. John and Harriet, and five of their children embraced the gospel. Louisa was the first to be baptized in 1854. She was only fourteen years old at the time. Her father John was baptized in 1855. It is not known when Harriet was baptized. Of the other children, Eliza and her husband, Elias Aston, were baptized in 1856; Frederick, Sarah, and Clara were also baptized. Like thousands of other British converts, the family was \"waiting for the missionaries to find them, and when they heard the message, they believed, were baptized, told their friends, adored and cared for those who had brought the message. and prepared to leave the Babylon of the world for the kingdom of God being built in America...Beside being willing to accept the missionaries' testimonies about the restoration of the original Church of Christ spoken of in the Bible, these British Saints also obeyed the counsel to gather to Zion. Before the end of the century, some fifty-five thousand had crossed the ocean and the continental U.S. to make their homes in the West. Not all were enthusiastic to come, but most, perhaps the most converted, scrimped and saved until they had enough to pay passage for a family.\" (\"Truth Prevailing\"; Douglas F. Tobler; Ensign, July 1987)\n\nTo aid the immigrants in their desire to join the Saints in Zion, the Church in 1849 created the Perpetual Emigration Fund. The fund helped the costs of the trip, but the family was expected to reimburse the fund after settling in Utah. John and Harriet, and the younger children immigrated to America on the ship Underwriter. The European Emigration Card Index shows:\n\nFoulkes, John (57) Turner\n\nHarriet (57) Wife\n\nFrederick (18) Joiner\n\nSarah Ann (15)Spinster\n\nClara (13)\n\nLouise (20)\n\nArthur* (2) *Louise's son\n\nThe ship sailed from Liverpool on April 23, 1861. On board ship \"the agent appointed a president and two counselors (usually missionaries returning to America) to preside over the company. After receiving the sustaining vote of the group, the presidency divided the company into wards or branches, usually along the lines of the travelers's home districts. Each ward or branch was then provided with presiding officers and assigned a separate portion of the ship...Once underway, the emigrants were expected to rise at an early hour, clean their quarters, assemble for prayer, and then eat breakfast. Contemporary observers were impressed by the prevailing order, cleanliness, and decency aboard Mormon ships\". Charles Dickens described the Mormon emigrants in a chapter of The Uncommon Traveler:\n\n\"They had not been a couple of hours on board when they established their own police, made their own regulations, and set their own watches at all the hatchways. Before nine o'clock the ship was as orderly and quiet as a man-of-war...there was no disorder, hurry, or difficulty...I afterwards learned that a Despatch was sent home by the captain, before he struck out into the wide Atlantic, highly extolling the behavior of these Emigrants and the perfect order and propriety of all their social arrangements.\"\n\n\"Converts often arrived on the American frontier with only a short time to prepare for the trek to Utah...To economize, emigrants were expected to purchase cotton fabric for the wagon covers in England and stitch it during the voyage.\" (The Mormon Experience; Leonard J. Arrington). The Fowlkes's ship took six weeks to cross the ocean. Another passenger on the Underwriter, Charles W. Penrose awoke one morning to find that a mother rat had given birth in his shoe during the night. (Life on Board a Mormon Emigrant Ship; David H. Pratt and Paul F. Smart). Sometimes the ship made no progress because of the lack of wind to fill the sails.. They rejoiced when they arrived in New York on May 22.\n\nFrom the Millennial Star: The clipper ship Underwriter cleared on the 22nd instant, and sailed on the evening of the 23rd, from this port for New York, having 624 Saints on board, under the presidency of Elder Milo Andrus, assisted by Elders Homer Duncan and C.W. Penrose as counselors. Presidents Lyman, Rich, and Cannon visited the ship on Sunday, the 21st, as she lay in the river, and held a meeting, giving the Saints their parting blessing and many choice instructions relative to their journey. The unanimity and good feeling which pervaded the deliverance having arrived, tended to make a fine and intelligent looking company double interesting; and we have no doubt that, under the wise direction of President Andrus their ocean trip will prove both agreeable and instructive. May God bless them in their journeyings onwards to the home of the Saints in the valley of the mountains! (Millennial Star, May 4, 1861)\n\nClara Fowlke remembered: \"Crossing the sea was the worst part of the trip. I was so very sick all the way. We could not eat the rations, thick fat bacon and sea biscuits (hard tack as it is now called). I never tasted bread for a month. I did wish I could have a little piece of bread.\" (James and Clara Fowlke Cullimore -- Brief History, on familysearch.org)\n\nThe clipper ship Underwriter sailed from Liverpool, with 624 Saints, under the presidency of Milo Andrus, Homer Duncan and Charles William Penrose. The company arrived at New York May 22nd, and at Florence (Nebraska) June 2nd. (Millennial Star, Apr 23, 1861)\n\nThe family then proceeded to the outfitting station at Council Bluffs, Iowa. At the outfitting station the immigrants were provided with \"one wagon, two yoke of oxen, two cows, and a tent.\" (The Mormon Experience; Arrington). The Journal History of the Church shows \"John Foulke and family\" joined Capt. Ira Eldredge's ox train to travel over the plains to Salt Lake City. (Journal History, Sept. 15, 1861). The Fowlke family was unaccustomed to the hardships and way of life that lay before them. They were city people and used to city life. They cared for and drove an ox team across the plains. The family walked alongside the wagon most of the 1500 miles. When at Florence, Nebraska, the Saints suffered much from the severe rain and thunder storms. They arrived at Salt Lake City on 15 September 1861.\n\nIt was with relief and joy that the family found that \"whether they arrived by wagon, handcart, or railroad, the immigrants were greeted warmly in Utah...The already established Saints were under instructions to take the new arrivals into their homes, care for them, and provide employment until they could begin to farm or practice their own occupations. The sense of gathering was confirmed by the food and festivities that welcomed immigrants in Emigration Square. Soon afterward they dispersed to the colonies scattered throughout the Great Basin. The dispersal began with a \"placement meeting\" attended by all local bishops. Each was asked how many families could be absorbed into his ward for the winter and what special skill were desirable.\" (The Mormon Experience; Arrington).\n\nTheir arrival is recounted in a history of Clara Fowlke: \"The company arrived in Salt Lake City on September 15, 1861. The Fowlke family stayed there at the camping grounds overnight and next morning pushed on to Pleasant Grove, to the part now called Lindon. William Marriot, who was their teamster, took them to Holman's when they arrived in Pleasant Grove. Sister Nancy Holman cooked supper for them, chicken and biscuits, the first good meal they had had in five months\" (James and Clara Fowlke Cullimore -- Brief History, on familysearch.org)\n\nJohn Fowlke's skills as a machinist and engineer were needed in Zion. Leonard Arrington in The Mormon Experience tells us, \"Suffused with a desire to promote economic independence, the church became involved in nearly every important industrial development during the first two decades of settlement...Most American-born Mormons were lifelong farmers possessing few industrial skills. Foreign converts, on the other hand, tended to be craftsmen and mechanics, reflecting in the variety of their skills the higher stage of industrialization Europe had achieved. Quick to recognize the importance of this expertise to his dream of building an independent commonwealth, Brigham Young instructed church agents and missionaries in Great Britain to seek out skilled workers, especially iron manufacturers, metal workers, textile manufacturers, and potters. Such persons were to be encourage to \"emigrate immediately...in preference to anyone else.\" Each of the major industrial enterprises attempted by the church during the first decade drew upon European converts for technical expertise.\"\n\nThe family settled in Pleasant Grove in 1861. It was a peaceful farming community in the Utah Valley, founded in 1850, with groves of cottonwood trees, and sparkling streams of fresh water. \"That fall they made for themselves a dugout to live in. For a broom they had a bunch of little willows tied together. At night the fire had to be banked so there would be red coals to start the fire in the morning as there were no matches. If the coals were out in the morning, it was necessary for one of them to walk about a mile to get some red coals to start the fire again.\" (James and Clara Fowlke Cullimore -- Brief History, on familysearch.org) It appears that John married a plural wife, Elizabeth Carlin in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City on 8 July 1865.\n\nIn the 1870 census of Pleasant Grove, John and Harriet are found living next to their son Frederick and his family, along with Elizabeth Fowlke, age 57:\n\n1870 census, Pleasant Grove, Utah County, Utah\n\nIn the 1880 census of Pleasant Grove, John and Harriet Fowlke are shown living in Pleasant Grove next to their son, Frederick and his family, and their daughter Clara, now married to James Cullimore. Elizabeth is shown as a boarder and is using her maiden name.\n\n1880 census, Pleasant Grove\n\nJames and Claras daughter, Elizabeth, remembers that when just a small girl she loved to go to her grandmothers house and wash off all the chairs with a rag. Daughter Eliza and her husband Elias Aston were near neighbors. John worked as a machinist and engineer, and a farmer. John and Harriet, like other British Saints, \"most of whom gained no fame except that chiseled into the lives of a grateful and expanding posterity, became part of the bedrock of the growing kingdom.\" (The Mormon Experience; Arrington). John was active in the priesthood, and was ordained a High Priest. His photograph in Pioneers and Prominent Men of Utah shows a man of determination and courage. The description which accompanies the photo states:\n\n\"FOWLKE, JOHN (son of John Fowlke and Anna May, both of Nottingham, Eng.). Born Dec. 26, 1803. Came to Utah Sept. 17, 1861, Horace S. Eldredge company.\n\nMarried Harriet Raynor about 1823 at Nottingham, Eng. (daughter of Mr. Raynor and Catherine Frost, of Nottingham, pioneers Sept. 17, 1861, Horace S. Eldredge company).

Died at Lindon.\" (Pioneers and Prominent Men of Utah; Frank Esshom).\n\nHe died 9 March 1886, at his home in Lindon, and was buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery.\n\nHarriet lived two more years, and died in Mt. Pleasant on 13 September 1888. A biography of her son Frederick said, \"She was at the home of her daughter Mrs. John Truscott at the time of her death.\" (Life History of Frederick Fowlke) Harriet was buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery with her husband.\n\nANCESTRY OF JOHN FOWLKE\n\nFrom \"Genealogy of William Marrott and Louisa Fowlke, LDS Pioneers\"\n\nBy Kenneth C.
