        "meta_description": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints – the mainstream Mormon Church – has been seeking to establish itself in the People’s Republic of China since the 1980s. Unlike other religious movements of Christian and foreign origin, which have chosen to go underground, the LDS Church has adopted a strategy of complying with the law and negotiating with the state to obtain official authorisation to conduct its religious activities. The aim of this article is to describe and examine the basis, the form, and certain observable effects of such a strategy, both on an institutional level and in terms of the religious identities that are produced.",

        "text": "From missionary church to diplomatic church\n\n16 Statement made by Dallin H. Oaks and Russel M. Nelson, Church News, 28 January 1989, www.ld-schurch (...)\n\nWe have assurance from the highest levels of Chinese government that people are free to practice religious beliefs in China. […] We were assured that the people in China or Chinese citizens who are abroad are free to join any religious denomination they choose and to practice the tenets of that religion in China without fear of repression. […]You can be a Latter-day Saint and live in the People’s Republic of China, and you won’t be isolated from your fellow members of the Church or penalised for your beliefs.”\n\n62010 marked another change of direction, when three major announcements were made concerning the situation of Mormonism in China. On 30 August 2010, the LDS Church released a short statement concerning its activities in China:\n\n19 The First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles form a body made up of the 15 highest-r (...)\n\nThe First Presidency and other senior leaders at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City have had discussions with a senior official of the People’s Republic of China from Beijing, and have established a relationship, which we expect will lead to regularising the activities of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in China.\n\n21 Lds.org, 31 December 2012, www.lds.org/church/news/elder-russell-m-nelson-urges-missionaries-to-ref (...)\n\nOne popular rumor in circulation is in regard to missionaries who are called to one area and transferred to open the work in another formerly closed area, such as China […] Such rumors are absolutely false. […] Leaders of this Church enter countries new to the Church through the front door. We do not go in through the back door or via the alley. Our relationships are based on honesty, openness, integrity, and complete compliance with local law.\n\nThe “red church” strategy?\n\n26 Dallin H. Oaks, “Getting to Know China,” art. cit.\n\nPeople sometimes ask me about what can be done to “open China.” In response, I state my belief that China is already “open” – it is we who are closed. […] We expect the Orient to be the same as the West, China to be the same as Canada or Chile. We must open our minds and our hearts to the people of this ancient realm (sic) and this magnificent culture. We must understand their way of thinking, their aspirations, and their impressive accomplishments. We must observe their laws and follow their example of patience. We must deserve to be their friends.\n\nAcquiring instrumental legitimacy\n\n15Amidst the demands linked to its structure, doctrine, and historical heritage and those imposed by the religious and political context of China, the LDS Church has been attempting in a variety of ways since 1979 to forge an image considered respectable by the Chinese elites in order to increase its margins of manoeuvre.\n\n17There are also a number of academic exchange programmes linking LDS Church-affiliated universities with certain Chinese universities. Such exchanges help create links of cooperation with China and the Chinese elite, while also contributing, marginally, to the spread of Mormonism in China: by enabling Chinese citizens to visit the United States, the LDS Church is giving itself the chance to convert Chinese nationals outside their country who could, in the long term, fill its congregations in China.\n\n18The LDS Church also uses other instruments of a non-proselytising nature to convince the government of its social usefulness. For example, LDS Charities, a Mormon non-governmental organisation (NGO), has a presence in China through volunteer senior couples whose skills and past positions give them an increased level of legitimacy. It establishes relations with local actors by setting up humanitarian, educational, and social projects in the least developed regions of China. Certain legal NGOs that depend directly on the LDS Church contribute to the dialogue with the authorities by offering their expertise and assistance to the rulers and legal players of China in terms of developing ideas to improve the setting up of the rule of law.\n\nMargins for manoeuvre and limitations\n\nThe Mormon distinction: Some hypotheses\n\n28Aside from the legal problem posed by the situation of the LDS Church, research into the limitations and margins of manoeuvre revealed that the restrictions imposed on the Church promote the development of an educated and economically active Mormon population that is equipped with international experience and is receptive to the cultural content of Mormonism, capable of taking responsibility for the movement at a local level and encouraged to do so. Broadly speaking, it is not unlike the new generation of city-dwelling Chinese Protestants. The situation brings together the elements needed for swift and successful inculturation. The major question that remains is to what extent the conditions in which the LDS Church is spreading in China and the specific nature of the strategy used influence the future of converts in terms of differentiating them from (or confusing them with) the rest of Protestant Christianity in China and the rest of transnational Mormonism. Although the extent of the research we carried out does not enable us to give a categorical answer, it does give rise to the following hypotheses that future research will need to verify.\n\n29In the light of the interviews that we conducted, it became clear that the above-mentioned strategy of observing the rules could promote a self-sustaining stigmatisation mechanism giving rise, to a certain degree, to an innovation in terms of sense of identity. No doubt due to the fact that Mormonism only recently established itself in China, it is less subject to specific criticism and social condemnation there than in other countries. Distinctive Mormon practices such as the prohibition of alcohol and tobacco consumption, observing a day of rest on Sunday, and customs characterised by moral conservatism, do not set it significantly apart on the Chinese religious scene. Many evangelical churches share similar distinctive practices, and dietary restrictions are a common feature of other established traditions (vegetarianism for practising Buddhists, non-consumption of pork or alcohol for Muslims, the historical ban on eating beef, etc.). The diverse evangelical congregation, in particular, despite the fact that it is developing illegally, produces believers who emphasise their Christian identity and claim a strong social distinction. Our observations, which are based on followers attending various evangelical house churches, demonstrate a strong affirmation of faith ranging from wearing visible religious symbols to organising “evangelisation” concerts, not to mention organising office prayer meetings in non-Christian companies.\n\n30The LDS Church appears to nurture this same social distinction on an international scale, sending recognisable missionaries around the world, financing advertising campaigns intended to enhance the image of the movement and its members, and building its speeches around the assertion that it makes a positive difference. Yet one thing that became clear from the interviews we conducted with practising LDS Church converts was a tendency to limit the visibility of their identity markers. Their accounts concerning the practice of concealing or toning down religious markers revealed such behaviour to be all the more pronounced when the marker in question was specific to our Mormon sample. A 30-year-old doctor who had converted to Mormonism during a period of study abroad described this phenomenon as follows:\n\nI do not drink alcohol, tea, or coffee, unlike the people with whom I work. Sometimes they ask me why, and I tell them that it’s for religious reasons, but I do not say any more than that, because it is a very sensitive subject.\n\n31C., a 29-year-old graduate from a European university receiving training in an international company, shares the same point of view and the same attitude:\n\nI have not told anyone at work that I am a Mormon, because I’m a bit afraid to do so. I don’t want people to start asking questions or the girls in the department to start spreading rumours (…) I want to behave like a good person, a fair person, and be a good worker. Then, people will see me as a good person and one day, when they find out I’m a Mormon, they’ll say: ‘He’s a Mormon, you know. And he is not a bad person.’\n\n32Others choose to portray themselves as Christians when responding to the questions asked by those around them, thus adopting an identity marker that is both more widespread and more prestigious. The wish to limit the visibility of their Mormon identity is illustrated, in particular, in a position repeated in several interviews concerning marriage choices. Although the LDS religion advocates religious homogamy – the “sealing” or “celestial marriage” (gaoji guodu de hunyin 高級國度的婚姻), forming the highest ritual to attain salvation, is only open to couples who are legitimately married and share their Mormon faith – some unmarried converts tend to minimise the importance of this point in their answers and strategies. For example, one convert stated the following with regard to his non-Mormon fiancée:\n\nMarrying a member is good because it’s easy, and you can be sealed and have an eternal family (...). But L. is a truly good person. She is like a traditional sister, like a Mormon sister. She respects her family and loves family life, she respects her elders and looks after her parents, and she does not have worldly concerns, so she is a really good girl, which is important. So I think that although she is not a Mormon, she is a wonderful sister.\n\n33Another convert, who has spent time as a missionary for the LDS Church, also accepts the possibility of marrying a non-convert:\n\nIt’s better if he’s a member, but there are not many brothers, and there are still many people that I could meet and get to know; people who also need… need our help. So it would definitely need to be someone who can accept the change in me. After that, God has his ways.\n\n34If confirmed, this minimisation of Mormon identity markers, which finds expression even in the marriage strategies of some converts, could be attributed to two connected factors. Firstly, it is possible that the religious limitations in place distort the mechanisms that socialise members towards the models advocated as standard by the LDS Church. As touched upon in the extract above, the restricted size of Mormon communities most certainly limits the total fulfilment of the religious project on both the individual and community levels. Secondly, it seems that the enthusiasm of the Mormon authorities to comply with the laws of the country gives rise among converts to the idea that their religious identity is an identity that presents problems, whereas this element is not present in the statements of believers affiliated to clandestine evangelical movements that do not foster direct relations with the authorities. The Mormons we interviewed made numerous comments concerning the political and social risk that could result if they made too much of a display of their religious identity, and concerning the strangeness of their situation. One young convert described the following situation:\n\nThey have installed surveillance cameras [at the church]… That gives you a strange feeling. […] Because there were more than 50 of us, they were watching us in case something a bit questionable happened.\n\n35Yet they all accept the position of the leaders concerning the strategy that needs to be followed, even when describing the difficulty arising from this situation:\n\nIf I gave a Book of Mormon [to my girlfriend] that would be frowned upon because it is against the law in China. You can’t do that. […] I think the Church is taking the right course of action, because… if you tell people that you’re a Mormon, they will think that it’s an American church… so you need to be careful."
