        "text": "MORMONS embrace elements of Christianity, as well as guidance from their founder, Joseph Smith.\n\nHere, we look at what they believe in and other facts about the group.\n\nWhat is Mormonism?\n\nA Mormon is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was founded in 19th century America and has around 16 million followers around the world.\n\nMormonism came to the UK in 1837 and has around 190,000 members.\n\nMormons believe that other Christian churches have gone astray and theirs is a restoration of the Church as Jesus had intended.\n\nThe Mormon church was created by a man called Joseph Smith, and later was developed by Brigham Young, who moved with the new Mormons to Salt Lake City in 1847.\n\nWhat is the Book of Mormon?\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the movement, which Mormons used alongside the Bible for teaching.\n\nMormons believe that the Book of Mormon tells the story of God's dealing with Americans in the ancient world.\n\nIt was first published by Joseph Smith in 1830, and is believed to have been narrated by the prophet-historian Mormon, who is said to have lived in the 4th century AD.\n\nMormons believe that the Book of Mormon was translated correctly, unlike the Bible, and is the word of God.\n\nIn 2011, the satire musical Book of Mormon was first staged, and follows the tale of two Mormon missionaries who go to Africa to spread the word.\n\nWhat are the beliefs of a Mormon?\n\nMormonism is centred on strong traditional family life and values.\n\nAnd “sins” such as gambling, smoking, drinking alcohol, drugs, tea, coffee, homosexuality, pornography, and sex outside of marriage are forbidden.\n\nMormons hold fast to the belief that God has a physical presence and is married and can have children.\n\nThey also believe that mankind can become gods after they die.\n\nWhy can Mormons have multiple wives?\n\nPolygamy, or having more than one marital partner, was taught by the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for more than half of the 19th century.\n\nThe tradition was stopped, however, over a century ago and mainstream churches even excommunicate anyone who practices it.\n\nDespite this, many people still hold the misconception that all Mormons are involved in polygamous relationships.\n\nThat being said, there are fundamentalist offshoots of the mainstream Mormon Church which still continue to practice polygamy."
