        "text": "Notes Charles William Allen (February 22, 1942 - Died April 14, 2013) Charles William Allen, 71, of Nauvoo, Illinois, passed away Sunday, April 14, 2013 at 12:14 P.M. at Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois. Charles was born on February 22, 1942 in Rock Springs, Wyoming to Wilford Howard (Bill) and Thelma Grace Alexander Allen. He was a life-long member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. In April, 1942, Charles moved with his parents to Spokane Valley, Washington, where he was raised with six younger siblings. He attended Trent Grade School and West Valley High School where he participated in sports, lettering in football, basketball and track, and was elected Student Body President. After graduation, 1960, he attended BYU and awaited his mission call. In April, 1961, he entered the Central States Mission, Independence, MO, and served until April, 1963. After his last transfer in January, 1963 to Des Moines, IA, he met Susann Eau Claire, taught her the gospel and baptized her a member of the LDS Church on March 14. On September 12, 1963, Charles and Susann were married in the Salt Lake Temple. The couple were blessed with six children: Craig William Allen was born on March 14, 1965 and was later diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis. Since Craig struggled with many health issues in Wyoming, the family moved to Liberty, Missouri. Craig's battle ended when he passed away at home in Far West, MO, in his parents' arms a week before his 16th birthday in 1981. Following Craig were: Carolyn Sue was born on 3/7/1966, Charles Marcus was born on 8/31/1970, Christina Bronwyn on 12/9/1973, Camille Eau Claire on 2/19/1975 and Charlene Ruth on 4/15/1978. At the time of Craig's birth, the family lived in Murray, Utah and moved to Lyman, Wyoming in December 1965 to begin a retail business with Charles's parents called Lyman Mercantile, Inc. The fifth child, Camille, was also diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis. She passed away November 22, 1994 at the age of 19. The family was then living in Nauvoo, IL. Charles's oldest daughter, Carolyn, died of breast cancer on 11/11/2004. His wife, Susann, died of cancer on 12/21/2003, after sharing 40 loving years together. A granddaughter, Camille Bronwyn, died in 1996. He was also preceded in death by his parents, and one sister, Judy. On March 18, 2004, Charles married Debbie Daines in the Nauvoo Temple. She survives in Nauvoo. In addition to his wife, he is survived by five sons: Marcus (Kathy ) Allen of Kearney, MO, Brandon Condren of Morgan Hill, CA, Dustin Condren of Brooklyn, NY, Kevin Condren of Nauvoo, IL and Joseph (Britina ) Condren of Keokuk, IA; three daughters: Christie (Mike ) Rogers of Clarksburg, Maryland, Charlene (Curtis) Holbrook of Las Vegas, NV and Corey Condren of San Jose, CA; grandchildren: Ashlie, Maya, Craig, Andrew, Lani, Abigail, Luke, Ty, Jake, Christine, Chase and Joseph; his brother: Robert; and four sisters: Helen, Sandy, Carol and Barbara. Throughout most of Charles's life, he worked with wood to earn a living. Beginning in 1975, he specialized in designing and building windows and doors for historic projects across the country. Though he moved to Nauvoo in 1989, he was instrumental in the restoration of old Nauvoo since the 1970's. His most challenging experience was the assignment to design, build, finish, and install the Nauvoo Temple windows and front doors, a project that took Charles and his crew from 1999 to 2002 to complete. In his later years, Charles spent most of his time researching and writing books. He published books, including, \"The Gift\", \"Window Maker\", \"Out of Captivity\", and \"Journey of Promise\". He was currently working on a book on a topic he knew well, adversity. On-site research of LDS church historic sites in northern Missouri during the 1970's and 1980's prepared Charles to become an author. This experience also caused him to understand the importance of keeping a personal journal, which he has done daily since 1981. Charles loved to serve in the church, he served as a full-time missionary, Stake Missionary, Stake Mission President, seminary teacher, Sunday school teacher, branch president, bishopric, bishop, high counselor, and first counselor in the Nauvoo Stake Presidency. With all of his accomplishments, his family remained the most important part of his life. Services will be held Saturday, April 20, 2013 at 1:00 PM at Nauvoo Stake, Church of Latter-Day Saints, Nauvoo, IL. Burial in Nauvoo City Cemetery, Nauvoo, IL. Visitation will be held Friday, April 19, 2013 between 4:00 and 8:00 at Nauvoo Stake, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Nauvoo, IL.

In the 1930's, Hollywood's \"golden age\" was still in its infancy. Many of the great stars of the time were just beginning their careers and hadn't yet made their way into the American consciousness. It was during this time that my mother, Marion Ahern, moved from her home in Utah to Hollywood with her brother Jack. My mother was an accomplished dancer, and with her near 5-foot 11-inch stature and striking appearance, producers of the day wasted no time casting her to dance in musicals for what was then the biggest studio in the worldMGM. Naturally, working on the set at MGM, my mom became friends with many of the stars of the golden age when they were still on the rise. My father, Charles Curran, came from Oklahoma. He had a knack for cameras, so when he moved to Hollywood, he quickly found work behind the camera, shooting hundreds of the old Movietone news reels that used to play in movie houses before or between features. He developed a reputation for being very good at hand-held camera and promotional work and was soon hired by the publicity department at Twentieth Century Fox. My father, on loan from Fox, went to MGM on a publicity assignment and while working there, met my mother. Fortunately for me, the spark between my mom and dad was strong; even strong enough for him to steal her heart away from the man she was dating at the time--none other than the great Hollywood leading man, Robert Taylor. (Don't you worry about Mr. Taylor though: he soon met and married Barbara Stanwyck.) Mom and dad began dating, were soon married, and in due time, I was born. Despite that bit of romantic history, my parents remained close friends with Robert and Barbara. In fact, it was through Mr. Taylor that my dad met and became friends with the reigning \"King of Hollywood,\" Clark Gable. Impressed with my dad's camera work, Mr. Gable asked my dad to be his personal camera man and stand-in photo double; a working relationship--and close personal friendship--that lasted throughout Mr. Gable's storied career.\n\nGrenade the Actor\n\nMy mom put me in my first commercial when I was just a baby. From there, many other opportunities came my way. I was selected to attend Dory Cheri's acting class, and later Ben Bard's acting talent class at Twentieth Century Fox. A few years later, I attended Richard Boone's impromptu acting class along with future stars James Coburn, Michael Landon and Doug McClure. From my youngest years I had opportunities to play small parts in some of Hollywood's biggest productions of the time. I remember swinging from the riggings as the waves crashed over me in a pirate movie when I was 10 years old (I've since forgotten the name of the film). I remember running with other kids over a bridge on the set of one of Danny Kaye's movie. There are so many memories. It was a great childhood, growing up with a sound stage as my living room and the biggest back lots in the world as my back yard.\n\nGrenade the Dancer\n\nIn the 1940's, I started dance classes. I had some natural talent, thanks to my mother, but once I developed my skills as a dancer, I was sent by MGM to the studio of Nico Charisse (Cyd's husband) for a dancing \"cattle call\" and was picked as a background dancer for the musical, Rosemarie. I guess I did well, because the choreographer called the famous couple-choreographers, Marge and Gower Champion, to come take a look at me. They picked me to be a background dancer on the film, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, on which I also worked as the double for brother Frank. The Champions then introduced me to Gene Kelly, who came to watch me and asked me to be a background and street dancer in his famous film, Singin' in the Rain. When production was finished on Singin', Mr. Kelly told his good friend, Fred Astaire, about me. Mr. Astaire offered me the opportunity to work on his films Silk Stalkings and The Band Wagon. During this same time, Nico Charisse also picked me as a rehearsal partner for Ava Gardner for her film, The Barefoot Contessa. I loved acting, but dance gave me some of my fondest memories.\n\nGrenade the Producer\n\nI had spent many of my younger years in front of the camera; but I was always fascinated with the magic of movies, which happens mostly behind the camera. I had learned so many of the tricks of the trade during my career to this point, so I decided to try my hand behind the scenes. My years in production roles led me from wardrobe, through set production, production management and ultimately to producing and directing. One of my early opportunities came when MGM sent me to Walt Disney studios to work as a safety diver for their production of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. That opened the door for me to work with Fess Parker on Davy Crockett, and from there with Annette Funicello on The Mouseketeers. One day, Walt Disney called me to his office and assigned me to work on the live telecast of the World Premiere Invitational Opening of Disneyland. I had the distinct honor of riding in the Autopia car in the very first Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck Main Street Parade. That historic event afforded me the opportunity to work with famous TV host Art Linkletter and event co-hosts Ronald Reagan and Robert Cummins, not to mention all the big movie stars who were in attendance.\n\nLife in Hollywood\n\nSo much of Hollywood is about who you know and I was fortunate, starting with my own parents, to get to know so many great actors, choreographers, directors, producers and performers. These are just a few of the great memories I have collected during my life on and off the set in Hollywood.
