These families include but aren't necessarily limited to those of Joseph Smith Jr., Heber C. Kimball, Brigham Young, Parley and Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, and John Taylor. A project goal would be to include all known spouses, children, siblings and parents of the individuals covered. Project participates will work with existing profile owners and encourage them to make their ancestor's profiles \"public\" and therefore accessible to all users.\n\nA project goal is to include biographical information that helps place them in both their family context and their contribution to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Because this is a broad survey project most of these biographies will be extracted from 3rd party sources initially in order to populate as many of the profiles with information as possible. Please document where the information is summarized from by linking to the original web page or providing a full citation.\n\nIn addition to prominent restored church leaders this project may also include profiles of no-chruch members whose history impacted the early church like Governor Boggs, Thomas L. Kane, E. B. Grandin and others. The project will also include profiles of those that became disaffected from the church like Sidney Rigdon and John C. Bennett.\n\nThis project will also includes profiles for the 136 people mentioned in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint edition of the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nTime Frame:\n\nThe project covers early church leaders form the time of Joseph Smith Jr. until the start of the 20th century (~1805-~1900) Although this project focuses on \"early\" church leaders and will not extensively cover leaders after Heber J. Grant ( the 7th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) later leaders will sometimes be included when their inclusion is found to be warranted.\n\nFinding Aids\n\nPioneer's and Prominent Men of Utah\n\nRoots Web Early LDS Database\n\nBYU Studies\n\nFamily Histories at the BYU Harold B.
