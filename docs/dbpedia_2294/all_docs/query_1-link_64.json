        "text": "PIPE SPRING Cultures at a Crossroads: An Administrative History\n\nNOTES\n\nIntroduction\n\n1 Although the word \"pioneer\" has long been used when describing the exploration and settlement activities of Euroamericans, the author has refrained from using the term in this report, except in quotations. \"Pioneer\" is defined in one dictionary as \"one who ventures into unknown or unclaimed territory to settle.\" Contemporary historians, anthropologists, and Native Americans argue that the Americas were neither unknown nor uninhabited, and that the use of this term perpetuates a myth and is offensive to some. For this reason, the author has chosen to use the less culturally-laden word, \"settler.\"\n\nPart I - Background\n\n2 From this point on in the history, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is referred to as the \"Church,\" and its followers as \"Latter-day Saints\" or \"Mormons.\" Today, the Church frowns on the use of the term \"Mormon\" being used to describe either its followers or the Church, and requests that the term be used only in the context of the Book of Mormon. Both the Church and its followers, however, have for generations been referred to as \"Mormon,\" much as the members of the Religious Society of Friends are called (and call each other) \"Quakers.\" In both cases, what once was a somewhat pejorative nickname has become Â— to most, anyway - acceptable.\n\n3 The official name of the Tribe is \"The Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians.\" Past documentation, however, indicates a variety of names has been used in official reports and correspondence: Kaibab Indians, Kaibab-Paiute (hyphenated), and more recently, the Kaibab Paiute. The latter is used throughout this document.\n\n4 William J. Hunt, Jr., \"Archeological Study of Historic Structures HS-2 and HS-3, Pipe Springs National Monument, Arizona.

One strategy used to regain access to their appropriated resources was conversion to the Mormon religion (Kaibab Paiute History, 17).\n\n23 According to Charles S. Peterson, the location of this Utah mission was south of Cedar City to Santa Clara, extending to Las Vegas, including Harmony and New Harmony; for a time it may have also included Washington, Utah (Peterson's handwritten comments on draft manuscript, January 1999).\n\n24 Andrew Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia (Salt Lake City, Utah: Andrew Jenson History Co., 1920): 569-570.\n\n25 Leonard J.

He is not to be confused with the Sauk and Fox leader Black Hawk, who joined Shawnee leader Tecumseh's alliance of Indian tribes with the British to fight the United States government during the War of 1812. The author was advised by Charles S. Peterson that University of Utah Press will be publishing a definitive history of the Black Hawk Indian War in the fall of 1999 (title not provided).\n\n42 Arrington, 229.\n\n43 Woodbury, 168.\n\n44 d'Azevedo, ed., 387.\n\n45 One could argue a certain amount of wisdom in the proclivity of the Paiute to form alliances and live in proximity to Mormon settlements. In doing so, they were less susceptible to Navajo raiders. They also could appeal to Mormon charity in hard times. Moreover, where other Indians fought against the Militia and/or U.S. Army and lost, most were removed from the very areas they fought hardest to protect. The Kaibab Paiute, on the other hand, have retained a small part of their original territory.\n\n46 For information about the role of mission \"calls\" in Mormon settlement, see Charles S. Peterson's Take Up Your Mission Â— Mormon Colonizing Along the Little Colorado River, 1870-1900 (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1973). \"Mission calls were extended by the authority of church leaders and received full validity by public announcement and popular ratification.\" (Peterson, 42)\n\n47 Clyde A.

(New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1970): 33.\n\n52 Some dissident Paiute allied with the Navajo in defense of their territory, report Stoffle and Evans (Kaibab Paiute History, 13) but the majority sided with whites (Woodbury, 169). One source says that Paiute, \"often abetted by Navajo, began hostilities in southern Utah\" with a horse stealing raid on the settlement of Kanab in December 1865 (Bradley, 3). The alliance of most with the Mormons provided a measure of self-protection against the far more numerous and powerful Navajo, while sparing them from warring with the Mormons and U.S. Army.\n\n53 Dan L.

McClintock, Mormon Settlement in Arizona Â— A Record of Peaceful Conquest of the Desert (Phoenix: 1921): 79.\n\n55 Woodbury, 177. Woodbury writes that there was one other incident during the winter of 1873-1874 that threatened the peace, involving the shooting by whites of three Navajo in Grass Valley. Hamblin was able to convince the angry Navajo that the killers were non-Mormons and further conflict was averted.\n\n56 C. Gregory Crampton, Land of Living Rock, The Grand Canyon and the High Plateaus: Arizona, Utah, Nevada. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1972): 143.\n\n57 Peterson, Take Up Your Mission: 68-90. The most western of the two roads, pioneered by Jacob Hamblin, headed south from St. George to cross the Colorado River at Pearce's Ferry. Another version of this route followed a more southwesterly route from St. George, crossing at Stone's Ferry. These two wagon trails intersected at various points, finally becoming a single route that headed east toward the Little Colorado. This was called Stone's and Pearce's route. A second route, know as the San Juan Route, traversed the southeastern part of Utah and was promoted for a time by Erastus Snow as the best route to Arizona.\n\n58 Ibid., 146.\n\n59 A Bureau of Land Management archeologist, Rick Malcomson, worked off and on for 13- 14 years on a draft National Register nomination for portions of the trail that crossed BLM land in Arizona and Utah. The most current draft dates to 1992 and has been reviewed by both Arizona and Utah Historic Preservation Offices. Malcomson retired in 1992. The Arizona State Historic Preservation Office is currently negotiating with the Arizona Strip District Office of the Bureau of Land Management in St. George for an archeologist do some final ground truthing before finalizing the nomination.\n\n60 Arrington, 5.\n\n61 Cited in Peterson, Utah, A History, 42.\n\n62 Peterson, Utah, A History, 41.\n\n63 Such views of cultural superiority and a sense of religious duty to \"save\" native peoples is, of course, not unlike that held by many European and Euroamerican colonists of earlier periods and in other parts of the continent. The highly organized, Church-sponsored manner in which these views were implemented, however, serves to distinguish Mormon colonizing from most earlier (as well as later) colonizing efforts, particularly those made by mainstream Protestants. One could argue, however, that the role of the Catholic Church during Spanish exploration and settlement during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries was quite similar to the role played by the 19th century Mormon Church and its followers.\n\n64 Peterson, Utah, A History, 36.\n\n65 Recorded under the heading, \"Pipe Springs, or Home of the Pahutes [sic], or the Indians.\" This is a subsection of \"The Pipe Spring Story,\" Edwin D. Woolley-Erastus Snow Collection (Woolley/Snow Family Collection), MSS1403, Harold B. Lee Library, Special Collections, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. It is uncertain which Woolley family member prepared the transcript, but it was most likely either Bert or Dilworth Woolley, sons of Edwin D. Woolley, Jr.\n\n66 Ibid.\n\n67 Ibid.\n\n68 According to a personal communication from Park Service Ethnographer David E. Ruppert, the view of many native groups in the desert west as \"lowly\" or \"backward\" was commonly held by Euroamericans. Late 19th century thought regarding social evolution relied on a scale of \"progress\" from savage and barbarian (not exhibiting the material wealth of Europeans) to civilized (epitomized by the English gentleman). There was a tendency for white observers to place these desert dwellers on the bottom of this scale. Such a crude scale of \"progress\" is totally rejected today.\n\n69 The ecological impacts to the Kaibab Paiute by the presence and activities of Mormon settlers are discussed in Stoffle's and Evans' Kaibab Paiute History and the Ethnographic Overview and Assessment prepared by Stoffle et al.\n\n70 Stoffle and Evans, Kaibab Paiute History, 8-9.\n\n71 Woodbury, 22.\n\n72 Jacob Hamblin, Nov. 1, 1880. Slightly different excerpts from this letter are cited in Stoffle and Evans, p. 15, and in Robert H. Keller and Michael F. Turek, American Indians and National Parks (Tucson, AZ, University of Arizona Press, 1998): 70-71.\n\n73 Stoffle and Evans, Kaibab Paiute History, 13. See pp. 13-16 for the effects on the Kaibab Paiute resulting from the settlers' appropriation of resources.\n\n74 For a summary of Pipe Spring ownership, see Appendix I.\n\n75 Woodbury, 166. In A History of Southern Utah and Its National Parks, Woodbury states that W. B. Maxwell established a ranch at Short Creek \"some time prior to 1863\" and that James M. Whitmore located ranches at Pipe Springs and Moccasin not long after. This in conflict with reports by C. Leonard Heaton and others that Maxwell, not Whitmore, first settled Moccasin in 1865. No other source linking Whitmore to Moccasin was found.\n\n76 Actually, there are one or more lesser springs at each location, thus these places were often referred to as \"Pipe Springs\" and \"Moccasin Springs.\" The main spring at each of these respective sites, however, is called \"Pipe Spring\" or \"Moccasin Spring.\"\n\n77 Kate B. Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage (Salt Lake City, Utah: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 1958): 54.\n\n78 Book A, Records of Washington County, Utah Territory. Located in the Washington County Recorder's Office in St. George, Utah. See supporting document No. 5 in Geerdes' report, \"The Ownership of Pipe Spring: A Legal and Historical Brief \" (unpublished manuscript, January 1, 1970). See also pp. 11-12.\n\n79 Documentation indicates that the Whitmore family continued to reside in St. George, thus the dugout was most likely used only as temporary shelter for him and/or McIntyre. A record of Whitmore's developments is contained in a May 28, 1865 report by President Snow and party to the area. (PISP vertical files)\n\n80 Leonard Heaton, \"Historical [sic] and Facts Pertaining to Pipe Spring National Monument,\" p. 6. Lloyd Sandberg (p. 6) also reported McIntyre was a brother-in-law; Woodward (p. 8) and Jenson (p. 659) call him Whitmore's \"herder;\" Carter (p. 202) refers to McIntyre as \"a hired man;\" Bradley (p. 3) reports various writers also refer to McIntyre as son-in-law, brother-in-law, and stepson. See also reference to Mrs. McIntyre later in this chapter.\n\n81 Peter Gottfredson, Indian Depradations In Utah, (Salt Lake City, 1919): 179-160. Cited in Woodward's, \"Brief Historical Sketch of Pipe Springs, Arizona,\" 8.\n\n82 C. Leonard Heaton, \"Historical [sic] and Facts Pertaining to Pipe Spring National Monument, Arizona,\" ca. 1946, 6-C (monument archives).\n\n83 Flora Snow Woolley wrote that the son left in the dugout was eight years old (\"History of the Pipe Springs Monument\" November 9, 1934, Edwin D. Woolley and Erastus Snow Family Collection, MSS 1403, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT). Historian Arthur Woodward said the name of the son left in the dugout wasn't found in historical accounts but the only son of an appropriate age was James Jr., age eleven (\"A Brief Historical Sketch of Pipe Springs, Arizona\" June 1, 1941).\n\n84 C. Gregory Crampton wrote that men of the Iron County Militia were responsible for locating the bodies of Whitmore and McIntyre and capturing and killing the Paiute. Crampton, \"Mormon Colonization in Southern Utah,\" 125.\n\n85 \"Memorandum made by Charles Ellis Johnson in July 1914.\" Church Archives, MS 7941. This memo incorrectly identifies Andrus as \"Jim Andrews.\" The misspelling \"Androus\" has also been seen.\n\n86 According to Flora Snow Woolley, the bodies were found four miles southeast of the dugout. F. S. Woolley, op. cit.\n\n87 Angus Woodbury reported the story differently in A History of Southern Utah and Its National Parks. He wrote that the first two Paiute taken captive were questioned and tortured, and that the Militia made a surprise dawn raid upon the camp, killing two Paiute and capturing five. These captives were also tortured before they consented to taking the Mormons to the bodies of Whitmore and McIntyre. The captives claimed innocence, but clothing of the dead men was in their possession and thus considered proof of guilt. Perhaps to avoid the unpleasantness of shooting men face-to-face, the Indians were turned loose and were shot as they attempted to run. This version of the story, like that of Andrus, suggests that nine Paiute were killed (Woodbury, p. 168). Unfortunately, Woodbury did not cite the source for his account. Arizona State Historian James McClintock also reported nine Indians were killed \"in a short engagement\" (p. 72). Several other accounts say that seven Paiute men were killed. In yet another reference to the incident, recorded by Dilworth Woolley, a man named Ruben Dodge reported that \"Jim Andrus' posse caught the Indians, permitted them to run the gauntlet, killed all but one boy who Jim raised.\" (\"Dilworth on Pipe Springs, from his orange notebook,\" Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit.) Finally, Alonzo Winsor, son of A. P. Winsor, \"was under the impression that 13 Indians were killed,\" reported Leonard Heaton in his \"Early History of Pipe Spring,\" Southwestern Monuments Report Supplement, April 1936: 304. An lengthy article could be written just about the plethora of stories associated with the Whitmore-McIntyre slayings and subsequent retaliatory killings of Paiute.\n\n88 Crampton, \"Mormon Colonization in Southern Utah,\" 126.\n\n89 C. Leonard Heaton, \"Historical [sic] and Facts Pertaining to Pipe Spring National Monument\" (unpublished, undated manuscript, probably 1949). This report contains numerous versions of the Whitmore-McIntyre story. Heaton reported that Hamblin later learned of the Paiute men's innocence during his visits to \"Navajo Indian Country.\" Robert W. Olsen, Jr., reported that a Paiute told Hamblin in 1869 that three of his tribe led the Navajo to Whitmore's sheep, and at least one accompanied them back across the Colorado River (\"Pipe Spring,\" 1965).\n\n90 Winsor's son, Alonzo, recounted the story of how this happened to Leonard Heaton in 1936. It is cited in Bradley, 7-8.\n\n91 Crampton, \"Mormon Colonization in Southern Utah,\" 126.\n\n92 Henry P. Walker and Don Bufkin, Historical Atlas of Arizona.

Most often, sources indicate it was to ensure a stable water supply for the fort's occupants and the Church's tithed cattle herds. One source, published in Arizona, A State Guide in 1941, was unique in that it stated the fort \"was constructed over the springs to prevent Indians from poisoning the settlement's water supply.\" No source was cited for this information and while it was stated as fact, it is likely based on rumor.

Olsen, Jr., and David Lavender have incorrectly reported the amount of authorized capital stock was $50,000.\n\n107 The Church subscribed to $10,000; Brigham Young, Sr., to $2,350, A. P.

Trumbull, located about 60 miles southeast of St. George (Crampton, \"Mormon Colonization in Southern Utah,\" 160).\n\n123 Berle Clemensen speculates that the size was reduced because of the small size of the work force; this may certainly also have been a factor.\n\n124 Clemensen, 11.\n\n125 Dilworth Woolley wrote to his brother, H. E. Woolley, on August 21, 1943, correcting the Park Service booklet being used at Pipe Spring, which said the north building was erected directly over the spring. Woolley wrote that the spring was located about 15 feet outside the building. Numerous other sources, including Anson P. Winsor's son, L. M. Winsor, contradict him.\n\n126 See Clemensen, op. cit., and David Lavender's The History of Arizona's Pipe Spring National Monument.\n\n127 Crampton, \"Mormon Colonization in Southern Utah,\" 171-172. A news article in the Arizona Daily Star states that the telegraph line was used as the telephone line until 1937 (\"Pipe Spring Monument Is a Complete Museum,\" Denver Service Center Library, undated, ca. 1940). For information on the 1965 reconstruction of the historic telegraph line within monument boundaries, see Part X.\n\n128 \"Material on Pipe Springs furnished by Mr. L. M.

This period is referred to by the authors as \"Lost Times\" for the Kaibab Paiute, dating from 1870 to 1900.\n\n133 Between 1850 and 1900, more than 90,000 came from abroad \"to strengthen Zion's union and redeem its wastelands\" (Peterson, Utah, A History, 36). All were presumably Mormon converts.\n\n134 Clemensen, 14. See also, \"Anson Perry Winsor,\" St. George Stake H.P. Quo. Record, #15649, page 272, which states: \"I, Anson Perry Winsor in 1869 was called to settle and build up Pipe Springs, and remained there until called by President Young to labor in the Temple of St. George in September 1876.\" The date given for when Winsor left Pipe Spring varies somewhat, according to source. One author states that Winsor left Pipe Spring in 1875 (Carter, 153). Another source says he was called to St. George in 1877, perhaps because the Temple was not dedicated until 1877 (Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 570). September 1876 appears to be correct, given that Winsor's son had to fill in for a brief time prior to the arrival of Pulsipher in January 1877. Anson P. Winsor lived to be 99 years old.\n\n135 Edwin D. Woolley, Jr., \"The Pipe Spring Story,\" Chapter VI: 5. Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit. This information is taken from Charles Pulsipher's autobiography, quoted by Woolley.\n\n136 Clemensen, 14. This date is consistent with an excerpt from Pulsipher's autobiography, quoted in Woolley, which says when the St. George Temple was completed on January 1, 1877, Pulsipher received a telegram from Brigham Young commanding him to come to St. George. He arrived there the next day, where Young directed him to leave immediately for \"Winsor Ranch\" to take over operations there.\n\n137 \"The Pulsipher Family Comes to Pipe Spring,\" Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit. According to genealogical and family records, the first wife was Ann Beers. No children are recorded of that marriage. There is no mention of her living at Pipe Spring in Clemensen, who mentions the other two wives (p. 15). At the same time Brigham Young directed Pulsipher to oversee the ranch at Pipe Spring, he told him to get a young wife and raise more family, his other four children by Sariah being nearly grown. He married Julia on December 13, 1877, and had 12 more children with her.\n\n138 Crampton, \"Mormon Colonization in Southern Utah,\" 55.\n\n139 Geerdes, \"The Ownership of Pipe Spring,\" 18.\n\n140 Arrington, 356. Arrington wrote an article for Pacific Historical Review, Vol. XXII (1952), \"The Settlement of the Brigham Young Estate, 1877-1879,\" which would most likely list the date of final settlement.\n\n141 Edwin D. Woolley, Jr., reports that Pulsipher was at the ranch until the winter of 1880, thus it appears he did not leave Pipe Spring until sometime after Emett's arrival. \"The Pipe Spring Story,\" Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit. In an unpublished biographical sketch, Pulsipher wrote that he \"labored there three years...\"\n\n142 Gurnsey and Harriet Brown were Flora Snow Woolley's uncle and aunt. F. S. Woolley, \"History of the Pipe Springs Monument,\" Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit. Elizabeth Woolley Jenson wrote that Brown purchased the ranch lease in 1881 (Geerdes, \"The Ownership of Pipe Spring,\" 56).\n\n143 Sometime during his tenure at Pipe Spring (1961-1966), Park Historian Robert Olsen borrowed the original drawing from Ena Spendlove of Kanab to have it photographed. The drawing had been passed down in her family. Its whereabouts today are unknown to the author.\n\n144 Edwin D. Woolley, Jr. (1845-1920), had a half-brother named Edwin Gordon Woolley (1845-1930). Both were sons of Edwin Dilworth Woolley, Sr., (1807-1881) whose first wife was Mary Wickersham Woolley, mother of Edwin D. Woolley. Woolley, Sr.'s second (plural) wife was Louisa Chaplin Gordon, mother of Edwin G. Woolley. When Louisa died in Nauvoo, Illinois in 1849, the child was sent to Massachusetts to be raised by Louisa's mother. Meanwhile, Woolley left with his other family and the Saints to Salt Lake City. After settling in Utah, the father returned to get five-year-old Edwin G. and took him to live with his family in Utah. Edwin D., just three months older than Edwin G., were \"raised together more like twins than as ordinary brothers,\" said a family account. The two half-brothers later married the Bentley sisters.\n\n145 Flora was 29 years old when she went to Pipe Spring. E. D. Woolley, Jr.'s first wife in Kanab was Emma Geneva Bentley, sister to Mary Lavinia Bentley, who married E. G. Woolley. For additional detail on Woolley's Kanab property, see letter from H. E. Woolley to Dilworth Woolley, August 15, 1943, attached to memorandum from A. E. Demaray to Newton Drury, September 15, 1943.\n\n146 Clemensen, 22.\n\n147 On the quitclaim deed from Seegmiller to B. F. Saunders, the name is spelled \"McFarland.\" This is a typographical error. Reference is made to the McFarlane survey by Dilworth Woolley in his letter to his brother, H. E. Woolley, dated August 21, 1943 (appended to A. E. Demaray's letter to Newton B. Drury, September 15, 1943). Dilworth was present when the survey lines were run.\n\n148 Bill of Sale from Benjamin and Tacy Saunders to Bulloch and Jones, signed and dated March 8, 1898. It is not known what circumstances are connected to the reduction of James M. Whitmore's 160-acre tract to the 140 purchased by the Winsor Castle Stock Growing Company or how the property was reduced another 100 acres by the time of the 1886 McFarlane survey. One possibility is that the Church either sold part of the land or transferred it to the United Order of Orderville prior to the survey.\n\n149 Ken Verdoia and Richard Frimage, Utah: The Struggle for Statehood.

Earnings from California Gold Rush returnees provided the initial financial base. Brigham Young served as president of the company until his death (Arrington, 77-78).\n\n152 Arrington, 361.\n\n153 Arrington, 359.\n\n154 During \"the Raid,\" polygamous husbands sought to find locations for their families in out-of-the way places unlikely to be visited by federal deputies (Arrington, 383).\n\n155 \"In Two Worlds - The Recollections of Florence Snow Woolley\" (as dictated to her daughter, Elizabeth Woolley Jenson; undated, unpublished manuscript in monument's vertical files): 62; and \"Pipe Springs Becomes a Sanctuary/Place of Refuge,\" Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit.

The Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887 made the hiding of Church holdings even more imperative, thus the lack of physical evidence recording transfer of Pipe Spring property during this era may have been the result of deliberate intent by Church officials.\n\n170 Arrington, 364.\n\n171 The kinship tie to Brigham Young is cited in Arrington, 283.\n\n172 Geerdes, \"The Ownership of Pipe Spring,\" 60. See also Clemensen, 27.\n\n173 Geerdes' interviews with a number of people who knew of Seegmiller's and Woolley's management of the Church's herds suggest that Seegmiller was not alone in his underhanded dealings, and that Woolley too had similar shortcomings. While Seegmiller was fired, Woolley was only admonished by Anthony W. Ivins, the two men's supervisor.\n\n174 Historian Charles S. Peterson suggested to the author that J. W. Young may have masterminded Seegmiller's filing on Pipe Spring with Valentine scrip. Seegmiller was Young's foreman for the Arizona Land and Cattle Company. For additional information see Earle R. Forrest's Arizona's Dark and Bloody Ground and Peterson's Take Up Your Mission: Mormon Colonizing Along the Little Colorado River (Peterson's handwritten comments on draft manuscript, January 1999).\n\n175 Copy of Act, Forty-second Congress, Sess. III, Chapt. 89, 92-95, 1872.\n\n176 Geerdes researched the Valentine scrip matter in 1969 in connection with researching the history of Pipe Spring ownership. Geerdes states that Seegmiller's application to the Prescott Land Office was denied because the land had not yet been surveyed. Had one been made, he wrote, it would have revealed the Pipe Spring property already had a long history of use and development (Geerdes, \"The Ownership of Pipe Spring,\" 39). The author has not located documents supporting two of Geerdes' conclusions: 1) that Seegmiller's application was denied, and 2) that Valentine scrip could only be filed on surveyed land.\n\n177 This is speculation on Geerdes' part, but he provides some strong evidence for his conclusion. There was so much Mormon subterfuge during this period (in attempts to hide Church assets) that it is often impossible to ascertain some people's motives for acquiring - or attempting to acquire - Church property.\n\n178 Geerdes, \"The Ownership of Pipe Spring,\" 43.\n\n179 Ken Chamberlain, letter to A.

Leonard Heaton, \"A Brief History of the Town of Moccasin, Arizona,\" undated). Also, \"Arizona Strip Town Peopled by One Family,\" newspaper article published ca. 1940, echoes the 1865 date but probably used Heaton as their source.\n\n206 Crampton cites Andrew Jenson's Encyclopedic History (1941) as his source for information on the early settlement of Moccasin (Jenson, pp. 522-523). In C. Leonard Heaton's \"A Brief History of the Town of Moccasin, Arizona,\" Heaton reported that Maxwell sold the Moccasin ranch soon after acquiring it to \"an unknown man\" who built a cabin and lived there about eight years.\n\n207 Southern Paiute periodic use and occupation of the site was part of a pattern of regular use and occupation. Although a specific site was not occupied year round, the larger region of use was permanently occupied.\n\n208 Emma Carroll Seegmiller, \"Voices from Within - The Story of the United Order,\" unpublished manuscript (MS 1000, Folder 1), Church Library and Archives, Salt Lake City, UT.\n\n209 It may seem peculiar to \"gentiles\" that at the beginning of the 20th century Mormons and Paiute were praying for a U.S. President who had been dead since December 14, 1799. Praying for the conversion of souls of deceased non-Mormons was and still is an important part of Church practice. This is one of the reasons for the Mormons' intense interest in genealogy.\n\n210 \"Dilworth on Pipe Springs, from his orange notebook,\" Woolley/Snow Family Collection, op. cit. This information is taken from a statement made by Silas Smith Young to Dilworth Woolley on March 3, 1944.\n\n211 This part of the history is recorded in a sworn affidavit taken January 18, 1921, and signed by Charles C. Heaton, Edward Carroll, Henry Blackburn, Henry W. Esplin and Jonathan Heaton, per C. C. Heaton. The affidavit is attached to a petition requesting that certain lands be withdrawn from the Kaibab Indian Reservation. Both are under filed cover letter of March 16, 1921, from John H.

Rowe Groesbeck, May 23, 1961.\n\n217 See Chubbuck's quote under the section, \"The Federal Government's Response: Creation of the Kaibab Indian Reservation.\" It is highly characteristic of the times that the Church bought the one-third water rights from its own company, the Canaan Cooperative Cattle Company. Also, a news article published ca. 1940 (\"Arizona Strip Town Peopled by One Family\") states, \"One-third of the water was granted the Paiutes by the church in the early eighties...\" Other researchers Â— Lavender, and Stoffle and Evans - reported that the one-third flow of Moccasin Spring was given to the Indians \"in the early 1900s,\" p. 34, or \"probably just before 1907,\" p. 18, respectively. They wrote that the Church prevailed upon the Heatons to give up this share of water. Both are incorrect. The Church appears to have held one-third water rights to Moccasin since the early 1870s. In a 1938 history of the reservation located in BIA files, Phoenix, Arizona, it states the Church established a mission at Moccasin Springs in 1875. (\"Reservation Â— Kaibab: History of Reservation;\" see BIA, Phoenix records file.)\n\n218 C. Leonard Heaton, \"A Brief History of the Town of Moccasin, Arizona,\" op. cit.

(The exact location of the lands purchased by Heaton is not described.)\n\n224 C. Leonard Heaton, \"A Brief History of the Town of Moccasin, Arizona,\" op. cit.

He does not give the date the property came into the five brothers' hands, but this is reported in a newspaper article, \"Arizona Strip Town Peopled by One Family.\"\n\n225 Jonathan Heaton's first wife was Clarissa Amy Hoyt, whom he married on September 27, 1875. The couple had 15 children and maintained a home in Alton, Utah. He married Lucy Elizabeth Carroll on December 6, 1878. They lived in Moccasin, Arizona, and had 11 children.\n\n226 C. Leonard Heaton, \"A Brief History of the Town of Moccasin, Arizona,\" op. cit.

While several other documents use the 3,000-acre figure to describe the fenced lands, many documents - especially those later prepared by the Office of Indian Affairs - state the amount of fenced land was 4,000 acres. Some of Farrow's correspondence state 3,600 acres were fenced. Not knowing which of these figures is correct, the author has quoted all documents as they are written. In a letter dated September 13, 1922, from First Assistant Secretary E. C. Finney to Senator Carl Hayden, the 4,000 acre figure is used, for example (Hayden Papers, ASU, Tempe, AZ).

Heaton said Colvin lived at the fort from 1908-1914. This, along with photographs of the fort taken in 1908 by Charles C.

Tolson to A. E. Demaray, October 22, 1943).\n\n418 Given the Arizona Strip's close historical and cultural ties to Utah, it is almost easy to forget that Pipe Spring fell under the political jurisdiction of Arizona. Attempts by the researcher to locate newspaper articles published about Pipe Spring in the Mohave Miner, local newspaper of Kingman, Arizona (the Mohave County seat), at the time of the monument's establishment were unsuccessful. It is possible that a search of Phoenix's Arizona Republic might turn up an article related to the event, or that Governor Hunt's official papers might contain some correspondence on the matter.\n\nThe vast majority of National Park Service records related to Pipe Spring, however, document that Mather was in much closer contact with Church and state officials in Utah on the matter than with those in Arizona. While Senator Hayden was very involved in trying to help Charles C. Heaton protect his ownership rights to Pipe Spring, a search of his official papers disclosed no correspondence related to the establishment of the monument. This is an area that could use some additional research.\n\n419 Roger W. Toll, letter to Arno B. Cammerer, November 8, 1932.\n\n420 While it is not known for certain if Mather was aware of its plans, the company hardly kept it a secret, having written about their plans in their company magazine in January 1922, referenced earlier in this report.\n\n421 Knack, 225. Knack reports that nearly all the small ranchers went out of business until, by 1935, only the Heatons remained.\n\n422 Thomas C. Parker, letter to Director Horace Albright, June 6, 1933. The record of the discussion between Heaton and Demaray is referenced in the July 30, 1923, letter from Demaray to Grant.\n\n423 While Albright correctly identifies some of the primary contributors toward Pipe Spring's purchase, he neglects to recognize the private citizens who made contributions. The Heatons, of course, also made a considerable contribution.\n\n424 One source states that school sections could not be sold in less than a 40-acre tract, so it appears that Utah sold UP 40 acres with the \"deal\" that UP would then give back 19 of those acres to the state (land that comprised the canyon's rim). Thus one finds some news articles reporting that 40 acres were sold and others saying that 21 acres were sold. Both are in a sense correct, but it's important to know that UP did not end up with 40 acres.\n\n425 \"State Agrees to Sell Bryce Canyon Land to Railroad for Hotel Site,\" Deseret News, June 4, 1923, and \"State to Keep Title to Land,\" Salt Lake Tribune, June 5, 1923.

On September 9 they parted company with Daniel Hull (who set out for El Tovar), heading north from Grand Canyon to Kanab. This time they did not make the detour to Pipe Spring, having concluded their business there on September 7. That evening in Kanab's Rust Highway Hotel, Mather, Harris, and Farquhar made remarks at a meeting of the Young People's Mutual Improvement Association, after which the Honorable James W. Good presented an oration, \"Come, come, ye Saints,\" and \"Utah, Star of the West.\" En route to Bryce Canyon the following day, the party briefly visited with the bishops of Mt. Carmel, Orderville, and Glendale (Sorenson, Carroll, and Hopkins, respectively). On September 10 and 11 Mather's party toured Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks, then returned to Cedar City by night train. The next day they attended \"Old Home Celebration\" and the official dedication of the Union Pacific's spur line to Cedar City. Mather took part in the ceremonies, which were held in the tabernacle, presided over by Randall L. Jones. An entire morning of oratory followed, presented by a host of local and state dignitaries; as well as Union Pacific officials from Los Angeles. Mather and Good also addressed those assembled. A belated train arrived at two o'clock. More speeches ensued, including one by Senator Reed Smoot. Finally, the Harding memorial golden rail was laid. Farquhar, probably worn quite thin at the end of nine long, hot days of auto touring and a day of speeches, wryly listed the VIPs in attendance: \"President Heber J. Grant, President Ivins, Governor Charles R. Mabey, Vice-president Adams of the Union Pacific, Dan S. Spencer, District Forester R. H. Rutledge, President H. W. Lunt, General Sherman, Mr. Lancaster, Carl McStay; not to mention Dusty Rhodes and Goodrich Mudd.\" As he wound down his log of the day's events, Farquhar humorously remarked that the \"Big wind from the orators brought on rain.\"\n\n455 Francis P. Farquhar, letter to Amy Heaton, October 16, 1923 (F. P. Farquhar Papers, Bancroft Library). Myrtle White was Pipe Spring caretaker John White's wife.\n\n456 President Grant had informed Mather in May 1923 that Heaton would sell the property for $5,000, as stated earlier in this report.\n\n457 For a discussion of the economic and religious tensions between the idealistic Latter-day Saint settlers and Indians on Utah's southern frontier, see Charles S.

Fall's adjustment is referred to by Keller and Turek, 73, with no citation or detail given. It apparently excluded the Pipe Spring tract given that Heaton was asking for a new public water reserve to be established.\n\n465 Stephen T. Mather to Charles Burke, March 13, 1924. Cited in Clemensen, 37.\n\n466 In a later report, Engle writes this section of land was known as \"Pasture 2.\" C. A. Engle, report to Commissioner of Indian Affairs, May 14, 1924. Engle is not saying Farrow had developed tunnel spring, only that he had improved Pasture 2.\n\n467 This date is inconsistent with the date of August 26, 1920, given by Charles C. Heaton at the September 7, 1923, Pipe Spring meeting when terms of agreement for sale were made with Mather.\n\n468 C. A.

Leonard Heaton on Pipe Springs National Monument\" [Heaton Journal] January 1928. Heaton began to keep a monthly journal in early 1928, which became almost a daily journal beginning in February. He continued this only through May 1928. (He did send monthly reports to Pinkley, however, and Pinkley then excerpted portions of Heaton's remarks for his own monthly reports to the director.) Heaton did not resume his journal keeping until October 1935. From that point on, he maintained a daily journal until his retirement in September 1964.\n\n514 Heaton Journal, February 1928.\n\n515 Heaton Journal, May 23, 1928.\n\n516 The monument has also in its collection film footage of the men at Pipe Spring that day (Andrea Bornemeier, review comment to Kathleen L.

It is not known where roundups were held this year or in later ones. The year had been very dry resulting in poor grazing conditions. Most of the cattlemen planned to sell most of their stock that fall, figuring on significant losses if the winter brought snow.

(This was common practice in Fredonia at the time, monument staff informed the author.) Frequently a few of the captured fawn would die before Heaton could sell them.\n\n612 Many of these landscape features are shown on sketch map of the monument prepared in 1932 by Leonard Heaton. That map is included in Part IV of this report.\n\n613 Clemensen, 42.\n\n614 Frank Pinkley, letter report to Stephen T.
