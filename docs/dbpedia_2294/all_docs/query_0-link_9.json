Having never been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles prior to his call to the First Presidency, a rarity, there has been some dispute as to whether or not Winder was ordained an Apostle at the time of his appointment as first counselor. The LDS Church has no record of Winder being ordained to the office of Apostle.

In 1888, Joseph F. Smith accused Young of unethically using church funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle.[31] By April 1889, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were discussing Young's release. In response, Young resigned from his position on October 3, 1891.[31] For another 33 years, Young remained a church apostle, but never again served as a general authority.

Before he undertook the Mormon practice of polygamy, Zebedee Coltrin's first marriage (1828) to Julia Ann Jennings (1812-1841) was a happy one, but as with the five children Julia ultimately bore him, she also died — at Kirtland, Ohio, at only 29 years of age. Zebedee's second wife, Mary Mott (1820-1886), gave birth to ten more children. She and Zebedee were married 'for time' in 1843, and later, on 20 January 1846, 'sealed for eternity,' in the Nauvoo Temple by Brigham Young — after which, Apostle Parley P. Pratt conferred upon them additional endowment blessings; Mary also stood as proxy that day in the sealing of first wife Julia to their husband. Coltrin married Hannah Husted (1797-1862) and Sarah Oyler (1800-1886) at Nauvoo in 1846, and also Lavinia Elizabeth Fullmer (1838-1907) in 1857 and one Marriet Chaddock in 1874 at Salt Lake City. Finally, noting that none of these additional wives bore him children, it is known that Coltrin found a seventh wife in one Amanda Norwood.

Along the Mormon Trail, Stillman lost to disease and death not only his second wife at Winter Quarters, Nebraska, but also — almost incomprehensibly and in utterly devastating circumstances — 8 children from both his first and second marriages (including 18-year-old Abigail, a plural bride of Presiding Bishop Newell K. Whitney). Having earlier lost also his first wife to a New England Yellow Fever epidemic in 1833 (the 33-year-old mother having borne him 5 children), he went on to enter into three additional unions in Utah Territory from 1852 to 1870. Although Stillman suffered divorce from his fourth wife in 1855, all five women bore him children, making him grand-patriarch to a sea of descendants scattered throughout the intermountain West and beyond: Almyra Whittemore (1800-1833), Maria Louisa Davis (1812-1847), Abigail Thorn (1821–1904), Elizabeth Joan Bessac (1813-1875), and Anna Regina Swenson (1837-1909).
