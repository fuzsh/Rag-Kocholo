        "text": "Introduction\n\nMembers of any of several denominations that trace their origins to a religion founded by Joseph Smith in 1830 are known as Mormons. The term Mormon comes from the Book of Mormon, a work published by Smith and accepted by adherents of Mormonism as divinely inspired and supplemental to the Bible. The principal formal body embracing Mormonism is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and had more than 11 million members worldwide by the early 21st century. The next largest Mormon denomination, the Community of Christ (until 2001 the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), is headquartered in Independence, Missouri, and had a membership of approximately 250,000 in the early 21st century.\n\nScriptures\n\nThe Community of Christ uses Smith’s unfinished translation of the Bible, which incorporates prophecies of his own coming and of the Book of Mormon. The church in Utah, however, prefers the King James Version. Of great importance to all Mormon groups is the Book of Mormon, first published in Palmyra, New York, in 1830. It tells the story of a group of Hebrews, led by the prophet Lehi, who left Jerusalem in about 600 bc and came to North America. There they are said to have eventually split into two factions: the Lamanites, who forgot their beliefs and became ancestors of the American Indians, and the Nephites, who were instructed by Jesus Christ before being destroyed by the Lamanites in about ad 400. A prophet named Mormon recorded their history on gold plates. His son Moroni made additions and buried the plates in the ground, where they remained for some 1,400 years, until Moroni appeared to Smith in angelic form and revealed their location. According to Smith, he excavated these plates, translated their text into English to produce the Book of Mormon, and subsequently returned the plates to Moroni.\n\nOther revealed writings, including Smith’s translation of “Egyptian” texts that he declared to be the Book of Abraham, were incorporated into the Pearl of Great Price. The Doctrines and Covenants contains Smith’s ongoing revelations through 1844. The editions of the Utah church and of the Community of Christ add the revelations of their respective church presidents (who, like Smith, are regarded as prophets). The Community of Christ’s version of the Doctrines and Covenants omits several of Smith’s revelations that appear in the Utah edition.\n\nBeliefs and Practices\n\nUnlike the doctrines of most other Christian denominations, Mormon belief asserts that the three persons of the Godhead (the Trinity) are three separate beings. Although Mormons believe that Christ came to Earth so that all might be saved, they maintain that a person’s future is determined by his own actions as well as by the grace of God. They also stress faith, repentance, and acceptance of the ordinances of the church, including baptism by immersion and laying on of hands to confer the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Mormons administer the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper as a memorial of Christ’s death.\n\nMormons believe that faithful members of the church may receive God’s fullness and thus become gods themselves. Everyone who ever lived, save for a few who reject God having known his power, will receive some degree of glory in the afterlife. At Christ’s return to Earth, he will establish a millennial kingdom. After the millennium, Earth will become a celestial sphere and the inheritance of the righteous. Others will be assigned to lesser kingdoms named terrestrial and “telestial.”\n\nAlthough they stand apart from the mainstream of most Christian denominations, Mormons are considered to be Christians and they share much of Christian culture, though Mormons believe that other Christian churches do not have the full truth and that Mormon teachings add to the good already present in those other churches. Through Smith, they believe, God had restored the “true church”—i.e., the primitive Christian church—and had reasserted the true faith from which the various Christian churches had strayed.\n\nFaithful Mormons attend temple worship regularly. They also obey strict prohibitions on alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. In addition, many Mormons accept the call to missionary work. Young men, generally between the ages of 19 and 21, undertake a 24-month proselytizing mission, as do young women of age 21 and older. Many older married couples serve as missionaries for 18 months. This missionary work helped to make Mormonism one of the fastest-growing religions in the world.\n\nThe Utah branch of Mormonism dissolves the distinctions between the priesthood and the laity. At age 12, all worthy males (a category which until 1978 generally did not include black men) become deacons in the Aaronic priesthood; they become teachers at age 14 and priests at age 16. About two years later they may enter the Melchizedek priesthood as elders, and thereafter they may enter the upper ranks of the church priesthood hierarchy.\n\nAlso in the Utah branch, as well as in certain other Mormon branches, members may undergo baptism on behalf of a deceased person who is considered to have died without knowledge of the truth. This practice is known as baptism by proxy. The Mormons’ interest in genealogy proceeds from their concern to save the deceased population of Earth; meticulous genealogical information is compiled in order to identify candidates for baptism by proxy. In 2010, after complaints from some Jewish groups, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints changed its procedure for collecting genealogical information, in order to prevent the names of Jews who had died during the Holocaust from being proposed for baptism by proxy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Mormonism was quite turbulent during the 19th century. In the 20th century it became an established and accepted institution.\n\nJoseph Smith and six associates organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York. Smith and his followers soon moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where he established a headquarters. Another center was established in Missouri, to which a number of Mormons had migrated. Wherever they lived the Mormons were victims of persecution by non-Mormons. Armed skirmishes led several thousand Mormons to leave Missouri in 1839 to found Nauvoo, Illinois. Following more trouble with nonmembers the Mormon leaders were thrown into jail in Carthage, Illinois. On June 27, 1844, a mob stormed the jail and killed Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum.\n\nIt was at this point that the Mormons decided to leave Illinois and move to the Far West. Leadership had passed to Brigham Young. In 1846–47 he led his membership on a thousand-mile trek to the Great Salt Lake in what is now Utah. They arrived in July 1847. This first band of emigrants consisted of 143 men, three women, and two children. Envisioning a new state that he called Deseret, Young helped to establish more than 300 communities in Utah and neighboring territories. To build the population, he sent missionaries across North America and into Europe. Converts were urged to migrate to the new land, and it is estimated that about 80,000 Mormon pioneers traveling by wagon, by handcart, or on foot had reached Salt Lake City by 1869, when the arrival of the railroads made the journey much easier (see Utah, “History”).\n\nThough the pioneers made steady progress in settling the area, their petition for statehood in 1849 was denied by the U.S. government, which instead organized the area as a territory, with Young as its first governor. Future efforts to gain statehood were blocked by the announcement in 1852 of the church’s belief in polygamy, or multiple marriage. This practice had begun quietly among the church leaders during the Nauvoo period. Conflicts between Young and federal officials over polygamy and over Mormon attempts to establish a theocratic government continued, and in 1857 U.S. Pres. James Buchanan sent troops to take control of the territory and to impose a non-Mormon, Alfred Cummings, as governor. This marked the end of direct Mormon political control of the state.\n\nAfter Young’s death in 1877, he was succeeded as president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by John Taylor. During Taylor’s presidency, the U.S. government intensified its campaign against polygamy. In 1890 Taylor’s successor, Wilford Woodruff, announced the church’s abandonment of the practice in order to conform with U.S. law, and in 1896 the territory of Utah was admitted into the union as the 45th state.\n\nIn the history of Mormonism, more than 150 different independent groups have formed to follow new prophets, to defend polygamy, or to continue other practices that were discarded by the main Mormon church. An important minority of Mormons, for example, repudiated Brigham Young’s leadership and remained in the Midwest. The largest of these groups, which gained the cooperation of Smith’s widow Emma and his son Joseph Smith III, formed the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now known as the Community of Christ) in 1852–60. The Community of Christ holds less firmly to the Book of Mormon than does the Utah church and rejects various teachings, especially baptism on behalf of the dead. It also never practiced polygamy. The office of church president was for many years passed to lineal descendants of Joseph Smith III, but this ended with the retirement of Wallace B. Smith as president of the church in 1996."
