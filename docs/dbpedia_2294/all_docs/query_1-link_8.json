His attempts to persuade Brigham Young to relocate to California instead of Utah proved unsuccessful. Fiercely independent, Brannan remained in California and amassed a fortune with the discovery of gold there in 1849.

A friend of many Indian tribes, he founded the trading post Fort Bridger in 1843. The coming of the Mormons was a bittersweet experience for Bridger, ensuring greater trade with incoming settlers but reducing the Indian fur trade.
