        "text": "Joseph Smith\n\nHe is one of the most complex figures in religious history and the enigma at the core of the Mormon religion.\n\nJoseph Smith's Revelations\n\nThe story Smith told of his first, astonishing vision and the visions/revelations that came after became the anchors for the Mormon faith and what devout Mormons believe happened.\n\nThe Book of Mormon\n\nA look at the book's historical claims, the challenges to its authenticity and how Mormons have rooted their faith in the truth of the golden plates from which it was translated.\n\nRevelation\n\nThe process of revelation is a central and defining one in the Mormon faith and is supposed to be possible for everybody. Five Mormons talk here about revelation and how it works in their own lives.\n\nThe Temple\n\nMormons describe the experience of being in the temple, what happens there and why the temple is the essence of Mormonism.\n\nThe Afterlife\n\nMormons talk about their very real and personal sense of what awaits them in the afterlife -- what it will be like and who will be with them.\n\nBaptism for the Dead\n\nAn overview of the religious reasons behind the practice of trying to baptize the world's dead and the continuing controversy about it.\n\nAre Mormons Christians?\n\nLDS Church members have always regarded themselves as Christians, but there are some differences between them and institutional Christianity.\n\nLiving a Mormon Life\n\nViews on how the Mormon belief system and its culture work at an emotional, spiritual level that can powerfully influence how people live their lives.\n\nSmith's Revelation on Polygamy\n\nPolygamy's origins are unclear. What is known is that in 1843, Joseph Smith dictated the revelation authorizing polygamy, claiming God had commanded his people to live in plural marriages and thereby progress to the highest level of heaven.\n\nPolygamy's Religious Context\n\nPlural marriage was far more than a sexual arrangement; it tied directly to spiritual principles and Mormon theology -- for example, how one is saved.\n\nThe Renunciation of Polygamy\n\nIn 1890, under enormous pressure, prophet Wilford Woodruff issued a manifesto that he would only years later describe as a revelation. In it he announced that the Mormon Church renounced polygamy.\n\nThe Great Accommodation\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the path taken by the Latter-day Saints helped them emerge as a new face of Americanism.\n\nThe Prohibition Against Blacks in the Priesthood\n\nA look at the forces at work that culminated in the lifting of the ban in 1978, and President current LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley's personal account of this landmark moment.\n\nGrowth and Conversion\n\nAn overview of how Mormonism became an international, multicultural church and some of the inherent tensions that came with such growth.\n\nWomen and the Mormon Church\n\nIn the Mormon faith, gender roles are ordained by the church. Fathers preside over the family and hold the priesthood. Mothers are primarily responsible for nurturing the children.\n\nThe Mormon Church and Gays\n\nWhile the family is the spiritual core of Mormon life, not everyone feels welcome at the table.\n\nThe Mormon Church and Dissent\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the church began to forcefully discipline its intellectuals who challenged the orthodox view of Mormon history."
