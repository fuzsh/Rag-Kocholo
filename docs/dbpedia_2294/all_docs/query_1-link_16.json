        "text": "A. B. ANDRUS\n\nA. B. Andrus is the mayor of St. George and a representative of one of the most prominent and honored families of this section of the state. He was born February 14, 1875, in the city which is still his home and of which he is now chief executive. His parents were James and Manomas L. (Gibson) Andrus. The father came to Utah during the period of its early settlement and in 1861 was called to settle Dixie. He was a man well qualified for a task of this character, for he possessed enterprise, initiative and adaptability. He was a successful stock raiser, who through experience and investigation acquired a comprehensive knowledge of all that has to do with success in that field of business. He could talk to the Indians in their native tongue and did more to keep them under control than any man of southern Utah. He was captain of a splendid company of Minutemen but preferred to secure the cooperation of the Indians through friendship than through military force. He first settled at Grafton and later at St. George, where he followed farming and stock raising. He became the manager of the Canaan Stock Herd, an extensive organization, continuing in that position from 1880 until 1893, when the herd was sold. He was also heavily interested in the Woolley, Lund & Judd Company and in later years bought out the entire merchandise stock of this company and organized the firm of James Andrus & Sons. The sons are still continuing the business. The father was also one of the organizers of the Bank of St. George, of which he became the vice president. He filled missions in addition to his call to Dixie, going once to England and on another occasion to the eastern states for missionary work. He served as bishop of St. George, was a member of the High Council and at all times did everything in his power to advance the upbuilding of the church. For two terms he was chairman of the board of county commissioners and he was representative of his district in the first state legislature. His life was constantly reaching out along broadening lines of labor and influence; contributing to the development, upbuilding and progress of the state. He died in1914, beloved by all, and his memory and his example are a benediction and an inspiration to those who knew him. The mother is still living.\n\nA. B. Andrus of this review acquired his early education in the public schools of St. George and afterward attended the Brigham Young University and the Agricultural College of Logan, Utah, where he specialized in a commercial course. In 1896, having had thorough business training under the direction of his father, he took the management of the Andrus & Sons' mercantile interests and with the incorporation of the company in 1916 became its president and has since continued in this position. They have one of the large mercantile enterprises of Washington county and southern Utah, carrying an extensive line of goods, while their store is most attractive in its appointments and in the business methods followed. They have ever recognized the fact that satisfied patrons are the best advertisement and they have put forth every effort to please, holding to the highest standards in the personnel of the house, in the line of goods carried and in the treatment accorded patrons. Mr. Andrus is also a director of the Bank of St. George.\n\nOn the 25th of September, 1902, A. B. Andrus was married at St. George to Miss Catherine Macfarlane, a daughter of John and Ann Elizabeth Macfarlane. Her father was one of the early settlers of the state and of Washington county. He filled several positions of trust, both in the church and in civic connections, acting as surveyor and as judge, having practiced law in his later years. He has passed away but the mother of Mrs. Andrus is still living. Mr. and Mrs. Andrus became the parents of one child, whose birth occurred on the 3d of February, 1904, and nine days later the wife and mother, Mrs. Catherine Andrus, passed away. On the 2d of September, 1906, at St. George, Mr. Andrus married Rosilla Brooks, daughter of George and Cornelia (Branch) Brooks. Her father came to Utah with his parents in his boyhood days and spent his life in St. George. He served as city marshal and as county sheriff. He was a stonecutter by trade and worked on the temple, on the high school and other buildings, and he also had a farm, as did all of the early settlers of Dixie. Both he and his wife survive and now make their home in St. George. The children born to A. B. and Rosilla Andrus are five in number: Roman, who was born in July, 1907; Calvert Brooks, born in August, 1910; Reva, born November 24, 1913; and Mary and Pearl, twins, born May 2, 1917.\n\nA believer in the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, A. B. Andrus filled a two years' mission in the eastern states and during the last eighteen months of that period was secretary of the mission. He has also been stake secretary of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association for several years. In politics he is an earnest republican and in 1909 was elected on the party ticket to the city council, serving for six years. In 1917 he was reelected and in 1919 was chosen by popular suffrage to the office of mayor of St. George, in which connection he is now wisely directing the civic affairs of his community. For four years, from 1915 until 1919, he was chairman of the board of county commissioners. Like his father, he is a very prominent and influential citizen and one who is contributing in substantial measure to the welfare and progress of the district in which he lives. His judgment is sound, his discrimination keen and his loyalty to the public welfare is above question.

JAMES ANDRUS\n\nJames Andrus was the son of Milo Andrus and Abigail Jane Dailey, and was born at Florence, Ohio, June 14, 1835, In 1846, he started west with his parents, remained at Winter Quarters during the winter of 1847, and in 1848, his father having gone as a missionary to Europe, James, then only 15 years of age, went on to Utah with his mother and family, driving a team of two yoke of oxen, and a yoke of cows, the entire distance from the Missouri river to the Salt Lake Valley. Soon after his arrival in Utah he went to northern Montana with Van Netten, where he engaged in trade with the Nez Perce, Flat Head, Black Foot and Shoshone Indians. During the time occupied in these trading expeditions, he became familiar with the Indian character, and to an extent with their languages, which fitted him for the work he was to do, in the stirring events which occurred in Southern Utah, where he went with the Dixie Pioneers. He was made a captain of militia, and no other name was so well known, and universally feared, and in some instances thoroughly hated, by the Indians, as that of Jim An-du-ru, as he was called by them. He was present and participated in the activities at Pipe Springs, at the time of the killing of Whitmore and Mclntire, and commanded a detachment of militia which followed the Indians to the Ute Crossing on the Colorado, On this expedition a fight occurred on the Kaibab Mountain, to which reference will be made later. With a small detachment of men he later overtook and fought the Navajos, at Bull Rush, near Pipe Springs, inflicting the most disastrous defeat the Indians ever suffered] and led many other expeditions against them. While performing splendid service for the state, James Andrus was equally loyal in his obligation to the Church, and was a missionary of peace to the red men, as he was an enemy in war. In 1857, he went as a missionary to Europe, pulling a handcart from the Salt Lake Valley to the Missouri river. He crossed the great plains seven times, made three round trips over the old trail from Utah to California, went as a missionary to the Ute Indians in the Uinta Basin, in 1859, and was a missionary to the Oribas, with Jacob Hamblin. He was a successful rancher, merchant, banker and statesman, having served as representative in the State legislature, and was for many years bishop of the combined four wards of St. George; one of those rare temperaments in which the qualities of the soldier, statesman, financier and churchman are so harmoniously blended, that not any one dominates to the exclusion of the others. He died at St, George, Utah, December 8, 1914, the last of Utah's great frontiersman, scouts, and Indian fighters.
