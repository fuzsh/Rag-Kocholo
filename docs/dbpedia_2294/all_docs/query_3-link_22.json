        "text": "By April Makgoeng\n\nI. Course Overview\n\nWhat role does media play in the construction of religious identity in America? Inspired by the Harvard Religious Literacy Initiative (RLI), this course considers how journalism, film, television, and social media influence American perceptions of religion. Based on America’s significant daily consumption of screen content, media \"may well be the primary site where Americans encounter other religions.”[1]For this reason, American audiences need be equipped to critically analyze religious representations in the media. Using a cultural studies approach introduced by Stuart Hall, this class will examine media producers, text, and audiences. What are the motivations, intentions, and backgrounds of the producers and publishers? Do the media narratives, themes, and characters reinforce religious stereotypes or challenge them? How are religious complexities, controversies, and sacred beliefs portrayed? Do audiences accept or reject the intended message? As a case study, this class will survey a range of media produced about, by, and/or for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The course objective is for students to be able to analyze the role of media producers, content, and audiences in the construction of a Latter-day Saint cultural identity. In order to accomplish this goal, students must also gain some knowledge of the religion’s history, beliefs, and practices.\n\nFor nearly two centuries, Americans have been both captivated and outraged by Latter-day Saints, a faith considered to be outside the American mainstream. Media depictions of Latter-day Saints over the decades have ranged from pejorative to praiseworthy. These portrayals have influenced not only the public perception of Latter-day Saints, but also Latter-day Saints themselves. The Church of Jesus Christ offers an excellent case study of how a new religious identity becomes constructed under the influences of media, politics, and religious pluralism. In this class, we will explore key themes pertaining to media and Latter-day Saints including theology, gender & sexuality, and religious versus state authority. A study of these themes will allow us to explore two meaningful questions raised by the Harvard RLI project. “On the one hand, what role does media play in the ongoing process by which religious groups claim a place as “American”? On the other hand, what role does media play in determining how audiences view other religious groups with regard to dominant notions of American identity?”\n\nStudents will showcase their critical thinking and writing skills in weekly journals, essay exams, and a research paper. Students will also have the opportunity during class discussions to articulate their evaluations of readings and viewings. Drawing on methodologies from religious studies, cultural studies, and media studies, students will explore the changing media landscape and its impact on American perceptions of the Latter-day Saint religion and people.\n\n[1]https://rlp.hds.harvard.edu/programs/religious-literacy-and-professions-initiative/business/case-studies.\n\nII. Course Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nExplain fundamental aspects of Mormon history, doctrine, and ideology.\n\nArticulate the ways in which Mormonism has been portrayed in the media since the nineteenth century.\n\nThink critically about the role of the media in shaping public perceptions of religion.\n\nAnalyze and discuss the role of media producers, content, and audiences in the construction of a religious identity.\n\nScrutinize and discuss how media frames religious themes, rituals, characters, ethical issues, and moral dilemmas.\n\nIncorporate culturalist methods and theories in writing about religion and media.\n\nConduct original research and analysis on a topic dealing with religion and media.\n\nWrite critically and incisively on questions dealing with religion and media.\n\nIII. Required Reading\n\nA. Course Text\n\nDuffy, John-Charles and David J Howlett. Mormonism: The Basics. Routledge, 2017. (Copies also on reserve at library.)\n\nThere are several excellent introductory textbooks on Latter-day Saints (formerly known as Mormons), but none specifically on Latter-day Saints and media. Therefore, the only required textbook for the class is Mormonism: The Basics. This text covers not only the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but other branches related to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon as well. Additionally, one of the authors, John-Charles Duffy, has written several essays dealing with Latter-day Saints and media that are assigned reading.\n\nB. Additional Readings\n\nReadings on Latter-day Saints and media will be covered through academic book chapters and journal articles made available online. Since this is a course on media, assigned readings will also include news articles, church publications, and publications written by both those inside and outside the Church of Jesus Christ. When reading it is important to keep in mind who is writing, the publisher, and the intended audience.\n\nIV. Course Requirements\n\nOverview\n\nAttendance & Participation: Read assignments & be prepared to discuss in class.\n\nClass Journals: Essays responding to reading homework and media presented in class.\n\nEssay Exams: Mid-term and final.\n\nResearch Paper: a 2,250 to 2,500-word paper consisting of original research and analysis on an aspect of Mormon media\n\nA. Class Attendance & Participation (20% of final grade):\n\n1. Attendance\n\nYou are expected to punctually attend all class sessions. Attendance will be taken; non-attendance and habitual tardiness will negatively impact your grade. Excused absences are given for illness or emergences only (work, class projects, etc. are not reasons for an excused absence), please email me prior to class. If there is a special circumstance that requires you to leave early, please notify me before class. You are allowed one absence with no impact on your grade. More than four unexcused absences will result in a failing grade. Attendance points CAN NOT be made up for any reason other than an excused absence. If you miss a class, please get notes from a fellow student.\n\nYour registration details list your legal name. Please let me know early in the semester if you prefer to be addressed by an alternate name.\n\n2. Participation\n\nYou must complete all readings and be ready to discuss and/or write about them in class. Together we have a responsibility for maintaining a civil and conducive learning environment. For this reason, please do not use laptops or cell phones during class unless you have a documented need. One study shows that taking notes by hand improves comprehension. Another study indicates that students using laptops in the classroom impair the learning environment for others. Finally, as the lecturer, I am distracted when I notice students multitasking on a laptop rather than engaging with the lecture.\n\nProfessional courtesy and sensitivity are important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. I expect you treat each other with politeness, respect, and kindness. Questions are welcome, the only requirement is that the questioner respects the opinion of others and does not monopolize class time.\n\nB. Class Journal (20% of final grade)\n\nEach class period, you will write on the assigned readings and media presented in class by responding to a given question. (You will usually have time to write in class.) The journal provides you with an opportunity to reflect critically on readings, discussions, and lectures. Because you will submit your writings each day, it would be best to keep your journal in a binder so that you can easily remove and replace pages. Journals may be handwritten but write legibly. You should refer to the readings and viewings in your entries. Quality of your comments is more important that quantity. In your writing, focus less on conveying factual data and more focused on critical reflection. Your work will be judged on style (grammar and writing), organization and argument (does it make its point clearly), as well as its ideas. Due dates: Journals are due at the end of each class period. All final journal entries (including APPROVED make-up journals) are due the last class period.\n\nC. Exams (25% of final grade)\n\nThe mid-term exam will include two essay questions worth 10% of your final grade. The final exam will include three essay questions worth 15% of your final grade.\n\nD. Research paper (35% of final grade)\n\nEach student will submit a 2,250 to 2,500-word paper consisting of original research and analysis on an aspect of Mormon media. All choices must be pre-approved by the instructor. Your research must include references to at least 5 scholarly works (i.e. academic books or peer-reviewed journal articles) to draw on for your argument and analysis. Please refer to our reading, “Chapter 3: Getting Started,” by Jane Stokes in How to do Media and Cultures Studies , pp. 51-70, for guidance on topic selection and how to prepare a research question.\n\nPossible research topics include but are not limited to:\n\nMedia representations of Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\nThe films of Richard Dutcher\n\nPolitical cartoons about Latter-day Saints\n\nNews coverage of the Mitt Romney presidential campaign\n\nNews coverage of Latter-day Saints during the Trump campaign or Presidency\n\nAudience reactions to the Book of Mormon musical\n\nLatter-day Saint bloggers or Youtubers (i.e. the Shaytards, “Mommy” blogs)\n\nLatter-day Saint themes in Twilight\n\nLatter-day Saint business people or politicians in the media\n\nPortrayals of Latter-day Saint criminals in the media\n\nLatter-day Saint themes in Studio C\n\nContemporary portrayals of polygamy in the media\n\nLatter-day Saint characters in reality television\n\nMasculinity in Sister Wives\n\nMedia use in the Church of Jesus Christ’s visitor centers\n\nAudience reactions to videos on the Church of Jesus Christ’s Youtube channel\n\n1.
