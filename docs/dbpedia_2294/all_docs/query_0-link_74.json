The plates were not nearby\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nJoseph translated the plates by looking at his seer stone in his hat. The plates were not nearby.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nIsaac Hale, \"Mormonism,\" Susquehanna Register, and Northern Pennsylvanian, May 1, 1834, p. 1.\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim is based upon correct information - The author is providing knowledge concerning some particular fact, subject, or event\n\nJoseph translated the plates while looking at the seer stone, which was placed in a hat to block out the light. The plates could remain covered on the table.\n\nQuestion: Why were the gold plates needed at all if they weren't used directly during the translation process?\n\nJoseph did not need the plates physically present to translate, since the translation was done by revelation\n\nMuch is made of the fact that Joseph used a seer stone, which he placed in a hat, to dictate the text of the Book of Mormon without viewing the plates directly. [1]\n\nSome witness accounts suggest that Joseph was able to translate while the plates were covered, or when they were not even in the same room with him. [2] Therefore, if the plates themselves were not being used during the translation process, why was it necessary to have plates at all?\n\nJoseph did not need the plates physically present to translate, since the translation was done by revelation. The existence of the plates was vital, however, to demonstrate that the story he was translating was literally true.\n\nThe existence of the physical plates attested to the reality of the Nephite record\n\nIf there had been no plates, and Joseph had simply received the entire Book of Mormon through revelation, there would have been no Anthon visit, nor would there have been any witnesses. The very fact that plates existed served a greater purpose, even if they were not directly viewed during all of the translation process.\n\nThe plates served a variety of purposes.\n\nThey were viewed by witnesses as solid evidence that Joseph did indeed have an ancient record.\n\nJoseph's efforts to obtain them over a four year period taught him and matured him in preparation for performing the translation,\n\nJoseph's efforts to protect and preserve them helped build his character. If Joseph were perpetrating a fraud, it would have been much simpler to claim direct revelation from God and forgo the physical plates.\n\nJoseph copied characters off the plates to give to Martin Harris, which he subsequently showed to Charles Anthon. This was enough to convince Martin to assist with the production of the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe plates' existence as material artifacts eliminated the possibility that Joseph was simply honestly mistaken. Either Joseph was knowingly perpetuating a fraud, or he was a genuine prophet.\n\nThe existence of actual plates eliminates the idea that the Book of Mormon was \"spiritually true,\" but fictional\n\nFurthermore, the existence of actual plates eliminates the idea that the Book of Mormon was \"spiritually true,\" but fictional. There is a great difference between an allegorical or moral fiction about Nephites, and real, literal Nephites who saw a literal Christ who was literally resurrected.\n\nResponse to claim: 57, 358-9n47 - Each sentence and word in the 1830 Book of Mormon \"had supposedly come directly from God\"\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nEach sentence and word in the 1830 Book of Mormon \"had supposedly come directly from God.\"\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nJoseph F. Smith, quoted by Oliver B. Huntington, Journal of Oliver Huntington, p. 168.\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim contains propaganda - The author, or the author's source, is providing information or ideas in a slanted way in order to instill a particular attitude or response in the reader\n\nThis is fundamentalist speculation.\n\nQuestion: Was every word of the Book of Mormon translation provided directly from God?\n\nJoseph's view of revelation is nuanced in this regard\n\nSome readers of the Book of Mormon and other students of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have become concerned with issues that might, in their view, preclude the view that the translation of the Book of Mormon was given word-for-word, directly by God such as the presence of language from the King James Bible in the text. Such a view (that the translation was given word-for word) was expressed by early witnesses to the translation; but Joseph's own view of revelation appears to more nuanced and allow for some flexibility in this regard.\n\nWe read in Doctrine and Covenants 1:24:\n\n24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.\n\nKey phrases in this verse include \"in their weakness\" and \"after the manner of their language.\" While the translation of the Book of Mormon may come directly from God, this does not preclude the role that Joseph would play in adapting the language of the Book of Mormon to a cultural and linguistic framework that would both establish that the text was authentic and inspired while also communicating the Book's message clearly. Thus Joseph's model of revelation is one in which God could use things such as King James language as the means to the end of establishing his everlasting covenant and calling his children to repentance. This theology of translation may feel strange to some Latter-day Saints that might only accept the view that a translation provided by God can only be a formally equivalent (word-for-word) rendering of the Reformed Egyptian into English. Though, this view might build our conviction of the reality of God's love and the truth that we are all God's children and thus gods in embryo given that God, using this instance as an example, recognized the divine potential of Joseph Smith and chose to respect his agency. He worked in cooperation with Joseph (instead of merely subjecting his mind to the revelation) to get his message out to his children. He exalted the human. \"Exalting the human\" should feel right at home to Latter-day Saints whose theology sees divinity as the fullest expression of humanity.\n\nResponse to claim: 57-58, 359n49 - A voice from heaven proclaimed that the translation was correct, therefore no further editing should have been required\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nA voice from heaven proclaimed that the translation was correct, therefore no further editing should have been required.\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim contains propaganda - The author, or the author's source, is providing information or ideas in a slanted way in order to instill a particular attitude or response in the reader\n\nA translation may be correct, and yet another way of expressing the idea may be equally (or more) correct. There is no such thing as a perfect or \"one true\" translation.\n\nResponse to claim: 58, 359n50-51 - The use of the word \"synagogue\" in the Book of Mormon is an anachronism\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nThe use of the word \"synagogue\" in the Book of Mormon is an anachronism.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nBook of Mormon, 1830 edition, p. 268\n\nAlma 16꞉13\n\nThe New International Dictionary of the Bible, p. 972\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: The author has stated erroneous information or misinterpreted their sources\n\nThe claim that no synagogues were present before the Babylonian captivity is based on out-of-date information.\n\nQuestion: Why does the Book of Mormon mention \"synagogues\" when they were not present among the Jews until after the Babylonian captivity?\n\nAssemblies for Jewish worship were known and used prior to the Babylonian captivity\n\nThe Book of Mormon mentions \"synagogues\" twenty five times. It is claimed that \"synagogues\" were not present among the Jews until after the Babylonian captivity, and thus Lehi and his family cannot have known of them. The critics insist, therefore, that Book of Mormon use of synagogues is anachronistic.\n\nAssemblies for Jewish worship were known and used prior to the Babylonian captivity. The term \"synagogue\" is a translation, and need not be the actual Nephites word for these structures. However, pre-captivity Jews had such sites for communal worship. In any case, nothing prevents Nephites from independently developing the idea of a building for group worship, and Joseph Smith translating such a concept as \"synagogue.\"\n\n[Lee] Levine, a leading scholar on the history of the synagogue, has suggested that synagogues did exist before the Babylonian captivity in the form of chambers in the city gates. Such gates have been excavated by archaeologists at such important Old Testament sites as Beersheba, Gezer, Lachish, and Megiddo. Each of these has\n\nat least one chamber (which is nearly square) lined with stone benches around the interior walls (the benched chamber at Lachish has two tiers of benches),\n\na single doorway, and\n\nwhere there is enough of the original wall left to determine it, a niche. I suggest that these niches were used for storing special ritual items, perhaps even sacred scrolls.\n\nLevine concludes that since later synagogues closely mirror the architecture of the gate chambers, these chambers may well have been the original synagogues. This conclusion is supported by a number of biblical passages that indicate that the city gate and its vicinity were the hub of a community's life. The gate area served as\n\nthe market place (see 2 Kings 7:1),\n\nthe general court (see Genesis 23:10,18; Deuteronomy 17:5, Deuteronomy 21:19 and Deuteronomy 22:24; Ruth 4:1–12; Jeremiah 38:7; Daniel 2:48–49; and Esther 5:9,13; Esther 6:10),\n\nthe royal court (see 2 Samuel 18:4 and 2 Samuel 19:8; and 1 Kings 22:10, which equals 2 Chronicles 18:9), and\n\na place of worship (see 2 Kings 23:8 and Nehemiah 8:1).\n\nSupport for Levine's conclusion is also found in the Old Testament terminology for worship service. Several Old Testament writers (see Hosea 2:11; Jeremiah in Lamentations 2:6; Ezekiel 44:24) link Sabbath worship with the Hebrew word mo‘ed which means \"assembly, meeting.\"\n\nIf Levine is correct, then, before the captivity, a town's or city's social activities centered around the city gate, and it seems reasonable that these social activities included Sabbath worship in a chamber of the gate that resembled later synagogues and functioned similarly.[3]\n\nFurther information on the chambers in city-gates being a proto-synagogue as a result of Josiah's centralization of Temple worship in Jerusalem and the establishment of congregations meeting for non-sacrificial worship in the chambers of city-gates is available in non-LDS works.[4]\n\nResponse to claim: 58, 359n52-53 - There are anachronistic references to cows and oxen in the New World hundreds of years before Christ\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nThere are anachronistic references to cows in the New World hundreds of years before Christ.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\n1 Nephi 18꞉25\n\nThomas D.S.

There is, however, some evidence to the contrary.\n\nSorenson: \"The Miami Indians, for example, were unfamiliar with the buffalo and simply called them 'wild cows'\"\n\nJohn L. Sorenson:\n\nAs with many other animals in the Book of Mormon, it is likely that these Book of Mormon terms are the product of reassigning familiar labels to unfamiliar items...The Miami Indians, for example, were unfamiliar with the buffalo and simply called them “wild cows.” Likewise the “explorer DeSoto called the buffalo simply vaca, cow. The Delaware Indians named the cow after the deer, and the Miami tribe labeled sheep, when they first saw them, ‘looks-like-a-cow’”[5]\n\nMiller and Roper: \"Bones of domesticated cattle...have been reported from different caves in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico\"\n\nWade E. Miller and Matthew Roper: [6]\n\nBones of domesticated cattle (Bos taurus – see Figure 2) have been reported from different caves in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.[7] In one instance these bones were found with those of an extinct horse, Equus conversidens. It is especially interesting that along with these cow and horse remains, human artifacts were found in association with them! The indication is that domesticated cattle and the horse coexisted with humans in pre-Columbian time. [8]\n\nPietro Martire d'Anghiera (1912): \"the Spaniards noticed herds of deer similar to our herds of cattle\"\n\nThe current consensus is that ancient Americans did not keep herds of large animals for use as food. However, Pietro Martire d'Anghiera noted the following in 1912:\n\nIn all these regions they visited, the Spaniards noticed herds of deer similar to our herds of cattle. These deer bring forth and nourish their young in the houses of the natives. During the daytime they wander freely through the woods in search of their food, and in the evening they come back to their little ones, who have been cared for, allowing themselves to be shut up in the courtyards and even to be milked, when they have suckled their fawns. The only milk the natives know is that of the does, from which they make cheese.[9]\n\nResponse to claim: 58, 359n52-53 - There are anachronistic references to horses in the New World hundreds of years before Christ\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nThere are anachronistic references to horses in the New World hundreds of years before Christ.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\n1 Nephi 18꞉25\n\nThomas D.S. Key, \"\"A Biologist Looks at the Book of Mormon,\"\" Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, June 1985, XXX-VIII, p. 3.\"\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim is based upon correct information - The author is providing knowledge concerning some particular fact, subject, or event\n\nAncient horses are believed to have vanished before the time of the Lehite's arrival, and modern horses were brought to the New World by the Spaniards. Yet there are a few pieces of circumstantial evidence of horses which are currently not accepted as valid by the scientific community. The idea that all defenders of the Church (e.g. \"apologists\") believe that New World horses are actually \"tapirs\" is a popular strawman put forth by the ex-Mormon community, and only represents a single suggestion offered by LDS anthropologist John L. Sorenson.\n\nQuestion: Why are horses considered an anachronism in the Book of Mormon?\n\nHorses existed in the New World anciently and spread to other parts of the world, however, it is currently believed that \"The last prehistoric North American horses died out between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene.\" [10]\n\nModern horses did not arrive in the New World until they were brought by Spanish explorers. Thus, the mention of \"horses\" in the Americas during Book of Mormon times presents an anachronism--something that doesn't fit the time frame for which it is claimed.\n\nThere are at least two possible resolutions to the \"horse\" problem in the Book of Mormon:\n\nHorses were present but their remains have not been found.\n\nDefinitions of the word \"horse\" were expanded to include new meanings.\n\nQuestion: What is the origin of the modern horse in the New World?\n\nMost scientists believe that the horse originated in the Americas and spread across land bridges from the Americas to Asia, eventually migrating into Africa and Europe. Over the course of millions of years the horse evolved from a smaller breed to the larger horses of today. Near the end of the Pleistocene period--about 10,000 years ago--the most recent ice-age came to an end. During this time many large mammals that once roamed the Americas became extinct. Among these were mammoths, camels, and the mid-sized horses that once lived in abundance in the New World. Scientists typically postulate that these animals died off due to climate changes and possible over-hunting. In other parts of the world, however, horses continued to thrive and eventually evolved into modern-day horses. When the Spaniards came to the New World in the early sixteenth century, they brought horses with them. Some horses eventually escaped and multiplied in the wild.\n\nVerses in the Book of Mormon that talk about \"horses\"\n\nHorses associated with travel and chariots\n\nAlma 18꞉9-10\n\nAnd they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi...Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished...\n\nAlma 18꞉12\n\nAnd it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants...\n\nAlma 20꞉6\n\nNow when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make ready his horses and his chariots.\n\n3 Nephi 3꞉22\n\nAnd it came to pass in the *seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.\n\n(It should be noted that we are not told if these chariots served a purpose in riding, or if they were for transport of goods, or if they had a ceremonial function. One assumes some sort of practicality or ritual use in war, since they brought chariots to the siege in 3 Nephi.)\n\nHorse mentioned in quotes of Old World scripture\n\n2 Nephi 12꞉7\n\nTheir land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.\n\n2 Nephi 15꞉28\n\nWhose arrows shall be sharp, and all their bows bent, and their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind, their roaring like a lion.\n\n3 Nephi 21꞉14\n\nYea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots;\n\nWild horses\n\n1 Nephi 18꞉25\n\nAnd it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men.\n\nDomesticated horses\n\nEnos 1꞉21\n\nAnd it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.\n\nHorses as a potential source of food\n\n3 Nephi 4꞉4\n\nTherefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years...\n\n3 Nephi 6꞉1\n\nAnd now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own lands in the *twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and his cattle...\n\nEther 9꞉19\n\nAnd they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and more especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms.\n\nIt is interesting that the horses are often grouped with cattle, and seem to have played a role in the diet (though this may have been under the exigencies of the siege of 3 Nephi.)\n\nThe Book of Mormon never mentions horses pulling chariots or being ridden\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nThe Book of Mormon does not mention horses pulling chariots. The BOM does not mention horses being ridden. Horses are mentioned with chariots several times. Assuming that they were present in order to pull the chariots must be extrapolated.\n\nThe Old Testament and New Testament do mention horses being ridden. The D&C mentions that horses can be ridden.\n\nJoseph knew much about horses yet in the Book of Mormon, they are not used in any way he was familiar with. They are not mentioned as being used for work, transportation or battle.\n\nJoseph likely knew, as everyone did, that the European horse was introduced by the Spanish. Why, then, did he make such a clumsy error in his forgery?\n\nCritics of the Church falsely attributes the possibility of the word \"horse\" as a description of a similar animal to Joseph mistranslating the text. No one claimed that Joseph \"mistranslated\" the term deer for horse. The accurate position is that early Nephites may have labeled deer \"horses.\" This conjecture is based on the fact that The Amerindians called horses \"deer\" when they first saw them.\n\nQuestion: What role do horses not play in the Book of Mormon?\n\nHorses are never ridden or used in battle\n\nConspicuously absent is any role of the horse in the many journeys recorded in the Book of Mormon. Nor does the Book of Mormon text indicate that horses or chariots play any role in the many Nephite wars (despite a popular classic Book of Mormon painting by Arnold Friburg depicting Helaman leading the 2000 stripling warriors while astride a battle-ready horse); this is in stark contrast to the Biblical account, in which the chariots of Egypt, Babylon, and the Philistines are feared super-weapons upon the plains of Israel.\n\nNor do we see a role for the horse in gallant cavalry charges that were the romantic warrior ideal in Joseph Smith's day. Nor is there any sign of the rapid war of maneuver and skirmish favored by the cavalry of the western nations. These are not the horses of the nineteenth century's practical realities or fanciful dreams.\n\nThere are societies in which the horse was vital, such as among the Hun warriors of Asia and Eastern Europe, for whom horses were a sign of wealth and status, and for whom they were essential for food, clothing, and war. Yet, there is no known horse bone from this period in the archaeological record.[11]\n\nQuestion: Have any ancient horse remains from the Nephite period been found in the New World?\n\nWild horses were present in ancient America during the Pleistocene period (Ice Age), yet were not present at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards. Horses thrived once they were re-introduced by the Spaniards into the New World. The question then is: \"Why were horses missing when the Spaniards arrived?\" Is it possible that real horses lived in the Americas during Book of Mormon times? And if so, why does there seem to be no archaeological support?\n\nAt least a few non-Mormon scholars believe that real horses (of a stature smaller than modern horses) may have survived New World extinction. The late British anthropologist, M.F. Ashley Montague, a non-LDS scholar who taught at Harvard, suggested that the horse never became extinct in America. According to Montague, the size of post-Columbian horses provides evidence that the European horses bred with early American horses.[12]\n\nNon-LDS Canadian researcher, Yuri Kuchinsky, also believes that there were pre-Columbian horses. Kuchinsky, however, believes that horses (smaller than our modern horses) were reintroduced into the west coast of the Americas about 2000 years ago from Asians who came by ship. Among Kuchinsky's evidences for pre-Columbian horses are:\n\nHorse traditions among the Indians that may pre-date the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nSupposedly pre-Columbian petroglyphs that appear to depict horses.\n\nNoticeable differences between the typical Spanish horse and the much smaller American Indian ponies.[13]\n\nLatter-day Saint scholars have also addressed this issue in various venues:\n\nWade Miller, \"The Presence of Pre-Columbian Horses in America,\" 2018 FairMormon Conference\n\nWade Miller, et al., et al., “Post-Pleistocene Horses (Equus) from México,” The Texas Journal of Science 74:1 (2022).\n\nWade E. Miller and Matthew Roper, “Animals in the Book of Mormon,: Challenges and Perspectives,” BYU Studies Quarterly 56:4 (2017).\n\nDaniel Johnson, “‘Hard’ Evidence of Ancient American Horses,” BYU Studies Quarterly 54 (2015).\n\nQuestion: Why don't potential pre-Columbian horse remains in the New World receive greater attention from scientists?\n\nTheories that horses survived extinction after the Pleistocene extinction are viewed as fringe by mainstream scholars and are dismissed\n\nUnfortunately for this solution for the Book of Mormon, however, such theories are typically seen as fringe among mainstream scholars. Due to the dearth of archaeological support, most scholars continue to believe that horses became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene period.\n\nWe know, for example, that the Norsemen probably introduced horses, cows, sheep, goats, and pigs into the Eastern North America in the eleventh century A.D., yet these animals didn't spread throughout the continent and they left no archeological remains.[14] According to one non-LDS authority on ancient American, the Olmecs had domesticated dogs and turkeys but the damp acidic Mesoamerican soil would have destroyed any remains and any archaeological evidence of such animal domestication.[15]\n\nEven in areas of the world where animals lived in abundance, we sometimes have problems finding archaeological remains. The textual evidence for lions in Israel, for example, suggests that lions were present in Israel from ancient times until at least the sixteenth century AD. Robert R. Bennett of the Neal A. Maxwell Institute Of Religious Scholarship notes,\n\nA parallel example from the Bible is instructive. The biblical narrative mentions lions, yet it was not until very recently that the only other evidence for lions in Palestine was pictographic or literary. Before the announcement in a 1988 publication of two bone samples, there was no archaeological evidence to confirm the existence of lions in that region.6 Thus there is often a gap between what historical records such as the Book of Mormon claim existed and what the limited archaeological record may yield. In addition, archaeological excavations in Bible lands have been under way for decades longer and on a much larger scale than those in proposed Book of Mormon lands.[16]\n\nIn the Bible we read that Abraham had camels while in Egypt, yet archaeologists used to believe that this was an anachronism because camels were supposedly unknown in Egypt until Greek and Roman times. More recently, however, some researchers have shown that camels were used in Egypt from pre-historic times until the present day.\n\nThe fact is, however, that there does appear to be archaeological support that horses existed in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. In 1957, for instance, at Mayapan (a site corresponding to Book of Mormon lands/times) horse remains were discovered at a depth considered to be pre-Columbian. Likewise, in southwest Yucatan, a non-Mormon archaeologist found what may likely be pre-Columbian horse remains in three caves. Excavations in a cave in the Mayan lowlands in 1978 also turned up horse remains.[17]\n\nAs an article for the Academy of Natural Science explains, such discoveries are typically \"either dismissed or ignored by the European scientific community.\"[18] The problem may be one of pre-conceived paradigms. Dr. Sorenson recently related the story of a non-LDS archaeologist colleague who was digging at an archaeological dig in Tula and discovered a horse tooth. He took it to his supervisor--the chief archaeologist--who said, \"Oh, that's a modern horse, throw it away\" (which he did)--it was never dated.[19]\n\nDr. John Clark, director of the New World Archaeological Foundation has expressed similar concerns:\n\nThe problem is archaeologists get in the same hole that everybody else gets in. If you find a horse--if I'm digging a site and I find a horse bone--if I actually know enough to know that it is a horse bone, because that takes some expertise--my assumption would be that there's something wrong with my site. And so archaeologists who find a horse bone and say, \"Ah! Somebody's screwing around with my archaeology.\" So we would never date it. Why am I going to throw away $600 to date the horse bone when I already know [that they're modern]? ...I think that hole's screwed up. If I dig a hole and I find plastic in the bottom, I'm not going to run the [radio]carbon, that's all there is to it. Because ...I don't want to waste the money.[20]\n\nQuestion: Could ancient Americans have expanded the definition of \"horse\" to include new meanings?\n\nLoan shifting: We must consider the possibility that the ancient author was applying familiar terms to unfamiliar animals that were encountered in the New World\n\nJoseph Smith obviously knew what a \"horse\" looked like. It stands to reason, therefore, that when Joseph said \"horse\" that this is exactly what he meant. If we consider, however, that Joseph was receiving revelation that simply conveyed what was written by the ancient author, we must consider the possibility that the ancient author was applying familiar terms to unfamiliar animals that were encountered in the New World. It is important to remember that the Book of Mormon itself is not an ancient text—it is a nineteenth-century translation of an ancient text. Modern readers need to have an understanding of what the ancient author was attempting to convey. Some of the things that seem \"plain\" to us are not so \"plain\" upon further investigation or once we understand the culture that produced the text.\n\nFor a detailed response, see: Loan shifting: \"Horses\" as deer and tapirs\n\nSee also Neal Rappleye's \"Put Away Childish Things: Learning to read the Book of Mormon with Mature Historical Thought\" from the 2017 FairMormon Conference. It details other loanshifts.\n\nEuropeans coming to the New World were not the only ones who struggled to label new animal species. The introduction of Old World animals into the New World, such as horses and cattle, also created labeling problems for Native Americans and terms for widely different species—such as deer, tapirs, and most commonly dogs—were loanshifted to horses by various native cultures throughout the Americas (see table 2)…\n\nJournal of Book of Mormon Studies: \"Pottery and other cultural materials were found in levels VII and above. But in some of those artifact-bearing strata there were horse bones, even in level II\"\n\nThe Journal of Book of Mormon Studies: [21]\n\nPublications from the late 1950s reported results from excavations by scientists working on the Yucatan Peninsula. Excavations at the site of Mayapan, which dates to a few centuries before the Spaniards arrived, yielded horse bones in four spots. (Two of the lots were from the surface, however, and might represent Spanish horses.) From another site, the Cenote (water hole) Ch'en Mul, came other traces, this time from a firm archaeological context. In the bottom stratum in a sequence of levels of unconsolidated earth almost two meters in thickness, two horse teeth were found. They were partially mineralized, indicating that they were definitely ancient and could not have come from any Spanish animal. The interesting thing is that Maya pottery was also found in the stratified soil where the teeth were located. [22]\n\nSubsequent digging has expanded the evidence for an association of humans with horses. But the full story actually goes back to 1895, when American paleontologist Henry C. Mercer went to Yucatan hoping to find remains of Ice Age man. He visited 29 caves in the hill area—the Puuc—of the peninsula and tried stratigraphic excavation in 10 of them. But the results were confused, and he came away disillusioned. He did find horse bones in three caves (Actun Sayab, Actun Lara, and Chektalen). In terms of their visible characteristics, those bones should have been classified as from the Pleistocene American horse species, then called Equus occidentalis L. However, Mercer decided that since the remains were near the surface, they must actually be from the modern horse, Equus equus, that the Spaniards had brought with them to the New World, and so he reported them as such.[23] In 1947 Robert T. Hatt repeated Mercer's activities. He found within Actun Lara and one other cave more remains of the American horse (in his day it was called Equus conversidens), along with bones of other extinct animals. Hatt recommended that any future work concentrate on Loltun Cave, where abundant animal and cultural remains could be seen.[24]\n\nIt took until 1977 before that recommendation bore fruit. Two Mexican archaeologists carried out a project that included a complete survey of the complex system of subterranean cavities (made by underground water that had dissolved the subsurface limestone). They also did stratigraphic excavation in areas in the Lóltun complex not previously visited. The pits they excavated revealed a sequence of 16 layers, which they numbered from the surface downward. Bones of extinct animals (including mammoth) appear in the lowest layers.\n\nPottery and other cultural materials were found in levels VII and above. But in some of those artifact-bearing strata there were horse bones, even in level II. A radiocarbon date for the beginning of VII turned out to be around 1800 BC. The pottery fragments above that would place some portions in the range of at least 900–400 BC and possibly later. The report on this work concludes with the observation that \"something went on here that is still difficult to explain.\" Some archaeologists have suggested that the horse bones were stirred upward from lower to higher levels by the action of tunneling rodents, but they admit that this explanation is not easy to accept. The statement has also been made that paleontologists will not be pleased at the idea that horses survived to such a late date as to be involved with civilized or near-civilized people whose remains are seen in the ceramic-using levels.[25] Surprisingly, the Mexican researchers show no awareness of the horse teeth discovered in 1957 by Carnegie Institution scientists Pollock and Ray. (Some uncomfortable scientific facts seem to need rediscovering time and time again.)\n\nMartin: \"no theoretical reason why a herd of mastodons, horses, or ground sloths could not have survived in some small refuge until 8000 or even 4000 years ago\"\n\nPaul S. Martin:\n\nAdmittedly, there is no theoretical reason why a herd of mastodons, horses, or ground sloths could not have survived in some small refuge until 8000 or even 4000 years ago. But in the past two decades, concordant stratiagraphic, palynological, archeological, and radiocarbon evidence to demonstrate beyond doubt the post-glacial survival of an extinct large mammal has been confined to extinct species of Bison…No evidence of similar quality has been mustered to show that mammoths, mastodons, or any of the other 29 genera of extinct large mammals of North America were alive 10,000 years ago. The coincidence in time between massive extinction and the first arrival of big game hunters cannot be ignored.[26]\n\nGrayson: \"extinct North American mammals...losses began in Mexico and Alaska during the Pleistocene and ended in Florida perhaps as recently as 2000 years ago\"\n\nGrayson:\n\nIn the first thorough review of radiocarbon dates associated with the extinct North American mammals, Martin (1958) concluded that the losses began in Mexico and Alaska during the Pleistocene and ended in Florida perhaps as recently as 2000 years ago (1958:405). Soon after, however, Hester (1960:58) concluded that the great majority of herd animals seemed to have been lost swiftly and together around 8,000 years ago even if some, like the mastodon, may have lingered on beyond then. Hester was thus the first to suggest, based on radiocarbon evidence, that a significant number, if not all, of the North American extinctions were synchronous.

Miller and Matthew Roper: [32]\n\nGoats are mentioned among the animals once had by the Jaredites (Ether 9:18). Later, after their arrival in the land of promise Lehi’s family encountered “the goat and the wild goat” as they traveled in the wilderness in the land southward (1 Nephi 18:25). Sometime after the death of his father Jacob, Enos wrote that the Nephites raised “flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats” (Enos 1:21). During Alma and Amulek’s miraculous escape from the prison in Ammonihah, their terrified persecutors are said to have fled “even as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions” (Alma 14:29). There is no indication in the text that the Lehites brought goats with them to the land of promise; however, it is possible that they may have been included among those flocks and herds brought by the Jaredites in their journey over the sea (Ether 6:4). If so, it is possible that some of those encountered later by Lehi’s people were descendants of those had by the Jaredites. They would have been a useful animal to both the Jaredites and Nephites, just as they have been for man through the ages in the Old World. Evidence of goats associated with pre-Columbian man also comes from caves in Yucatan. [33] It was not made clear whether this was a wild or a domesticated type of goat.\n\nMiller and Roper: \"In post-biblical Jewish literature some Jewish writers distinguished between wild and domestic cattle such as goats\"\n\nWade E. Miller and Matthew Roper: [34]\n\nMention of the “wild goat” may at first seem peculiar. Biblical animals that could be eaten under the Law of Moses included the “goat” and the “wild goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4-5). In post-biblical Jewish literature some Jewish writers distinguished between wild and domestic cattle such as goats. Both were considered clean and could be eaten, but only the domestic variety was thought acceptable for sacrifice. [35] .... The only native wild goat in North America is the Mountain Goat, Oreamnos americanus. Its geographic range, though, currently only extends south from southwest Alaska down to the northwest United States. Even with a possible extended range for this animal during Book of Mormon time, it is extremely unlikely it got as far south as Mesoamerica. A closely related, but extinct, species is Oreamnos harringtoni. This goat did have a much more southerly distribution, extending into Mexico. While this goat might have survived much past the terminal Pleistocene along with other animals, there is not sufficient evidence yet for this.\n\nIt has already been indicated that a referenced animal in the Book of Mormon could actually be something somewhat different, but had a similar appearance. There is an animal now living in Mesoamerica that fits this description, the Red Brocket deer, Mazama americana. Unlike other deer it has but a single goat-like horn – which is really an antler that is shed and regrown annually like other cervids.

( Index of claims )\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim contains propaganda - The author, or the author's source, is providing information or ideas in a slanted way in order to instill a particular attitude or response in the reader\n\nThe author is simply repeating Fawn Brodie's speculation.\n\nQuestion: Did Joseph Smith believe that the Book of Mormon explained local legends associated with the \"Mound Builders\" of the Eastern United States?\n\nWhen the Book of Mormon appeared, it was a natural assumption by many that the book was the story of the mysterious \"Mound Builders\"\n\nJoseph Smith himself initially believed that the presence of the mounds supported the story related in the Book of Mormon. In fact, as Zion's Camp passed through southern Illinois, Heber C. Kimball and several other participants claimed that Joseph identified a set of bones discovered in one of these mounds as \"Zelph\", a \"white Lamanite.\" In a letter that Joseph wrote to Emma the day after this discovery, he stated:\n\nThe whole of our journey, in the midst of so large a company of social honest and sincere men, wandering over the plains of the Nephites, recounting occasionally the history of the Book of Mormon, roving over the mounds of that once beloved people of the Lord, picking up their skulls & their bones, as a proof of its divine authenticity, and gazing upon a country the fertility, the splendour and the goodness so indescribable, all serves to pass away time unnoticed.[37]\n\nStatements made by Joseph Smith clearly indicate that his thinking regarding the actual location of Book of Mormon events evolved over time\n\nJoseph felt that the presence of the mounds in North America and ruined cities in Central America supported the Book of Mormon. Since information about the ruined cities in Central America came to light after the publication of the Book of Mormon, it actually strengthens the theories and evidences which place the Book of Mormon in a Mesoamerican setting--Joseph was willing to consider a setting of which he apparently had no previous knowledge. The description of the ancestors of the American Indians as a highly civilized culture capable of building great cities was not a concept which would have been deduced from the contemporary beliefs regarding the Mound Builders.\n\nThe presence of numerous burial mounds in the eastern United States was the source of great speculation to those that settled there. The construction of such mounds was not considered to be within the ability of the Native Americans, who were considered to be savages. It was assumed that such sophisticated constructions constituted evidence of a long lost, highly civilized society which had long since vanished. Some even postulated the existence of separate civilized and a savage societies, with the highly civilized group eventually being destroyed by the savage one. After years of research, however, it was concluded that the mounds had indeed been constructed by the ancestors of the Indians that continued to live in the area.\n\nJoseph clearly believed not only the region of the mounds to be part of Book of Mormon lands, but the entire continent, including Central America. The Book of Mormon itself, however, makes no mention of mounds.\n\nIn 1841, the Times and Seasons, of which Joseph was the editor at the time, commented on a popular book by John Lloyd Stephens called Incidents of travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan. This book described amazing ruined cities that had been found in Central America.\n\nJoseph Smith himself, as editor of the Times and Seasons wrote and signed (as \"ED[itor]\") the following on July 15, 1842. Notice that he mentions both the mounds and the ruins in Guatemala as supporting the Book of Mormon:\n\nIf men, in their researches into the history of this country, in noticing the mounds, fortifications, statues, architecture, implements of war, of husbandry, and ornaments of silver, brass, &c.-were to examine the Book of Mormon, their conjectures would be removed, and their opinions altered; uncertainty and doubt would be changed into certainty and facts; and they would find that those things that they are anxiously prying into were matters of history, unfolded in that book. They would find their conjectures were more than realized-that a great and a mighty people had inhabited this continent-that the arts sciences and religion, had prevailed to a very great extent, and that there was as great and mighty cities on this continent as on the continent of Asia. Babylon, Ninevah, nor any of the ruins of the Levant could boast of more perfect sculpture, better architectural designs, and more imperishable ruins, than what are found on this continent. Stephens and Catherwood's researches in Central America abundantly testify of this thing. The stupendous ruins, the elegant sculpture, and the magnificence of the ruins of Guatamala [Guatemala], and other cities, corroborate this statement, and show that a great and mighty people-men of great minds, clear intellect, bright genius, and comprehensive designs inhabited this continent. Their ruins speak of their greatness; the Book of Mormen [Mormon} unfolds their history.-ED.[38]\n\nA later Times and Seasons article, published on October 1, 1842 under Joseph's editorial supervision (though not signed by Joseph Smith as editor) stated:\n\nIt would not be a bad plan to compare Mr. Stephens' ruined cities with those in the Book of Mormon: Light cleaves to light and facts are supported by facts. The truth injures no one....[39]\n\nIf someone of that era were to attempt to write a book about a history of the North American Indians, they would not have written about advanced civilizations with advanced technology\n\nOne thing that critics do not consider is that if someone of that era were to attempt to write a book about a history of the North American Indians, he or she would not have written about advanced civilizations with advanced technology. The mysterious \"Mound Builders\" were not considered to be the ancestors of the current \"savage\" race that were inhabiting the land at that time.\n\nSome of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon realized that there were going to be problems with this assumption after the publication of the Book of Mormon. In a interview, David Whitmer said:\n\nWhen we [the Witnesses] were first told to publish our statement, we felt sure that the people would not believe it, for the Book told of a people who were refined and dwelt in large cities; but the Lord told us that He would make it known to the people, and people should discover evidence of the truth of what is written in the Book.[40]\n\nResponse to claim: 60, 360n58 - Joseph Smith incorporated text from Josiah Priest's The Wonders of Nature into the Book of Mormon\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nJoseph Smith incorporated text from Josiah Priest's The Wonders of Nature into the Book of Mormon.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nJosiah Priest, The Wonders of Nature, 1825\n\nAbanes, p. 69\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim contains propaganda - The author, or the author's source, is providing information or ideas in a slanted way in order to instill a particular attitude or response in the reader\n\nThe Tanners are the source of this comparison, although it is not explicitly stated by the author. The author does mention that the Tanners demonstrate that a copy of the book was available in the Manchester library. However, just because a book was available in the library does not prove that Joseph used Priest's book to produce Book of Mormon text. There is no evidence that such a thing ever happened.\n\nQuestion: Did Joseph Smith plagiarize Josiah Priest's The Wonders of Nature and Providence Displayed?\n\nThere is so little of The Wonders of Nature that has parallels with the Book of Mormon that it would provide a forger with little help\n\nIt is claimed that Joseph Smith plagiarized Josiah Priest's The Wonders of Nature and Providence Displayed in order to write portions of The Book of Mormon.\n\nMatthew Roper makes several observations regarding this claim:\n\nThere is no evidence that Joseph Smith ever read Priest's book before he translated the Book of Mormon.\n\nThat there are very few ways to describe an isthmus. Roper states, \"In his 1828 dictionary, Noah Webster defines the word neck as 'a long narrow tract of land projecting from the main body, or a narrow tract connecting two larger tracts; as the neck of land between Boston and Roxbury.' \"[41]\n\nNarrow neck\n\nThe Wonders of Nature(1825) Book of Mormon Other similar phrases For instance, in many places, such as the isthmus of Darien, a narrow neck of land is interposed betwixt two vast oceans. (p. 598) And they built a great city by the narrow neck of land, by the place where the sea divides the land. (Ether 10:20) A long narrow tract of land projecting from the main body, or a narrow tract connecting two larger tracts; as the neck of land between Boston and Roxbury. (Webster's Dictionary (1828)\n\nVapour and darkness\n\nThe Wonders of Nature(1825) Book of Mormon Other similar phrases \"Darkness which may be felt.... vapours ... so thick as to prevent the rays of the sun from penetrating an extraordinary thick mist. ... no artificial light could be procured ... vapours would prevent lamps, etc. from burning. ... [T]he darkness lasted for three days.\" (p. 524) \"[They] could feel the vapour of darkness, and there could be no light ... neither candles, neither torches, ... neither the sun ... for so great were the mists of darkness ... [I]t did last for the space of three days.\" (3 Nephi 8꞉20-23) They saw not one another. So deep was the obscurity, and probably such was its nature, that no artificial light could be procured; as the thick clammy vapors would prevent lamps, &c., from burning, or if they even could be ignited, the light through the palpable obscurity, could diffuse itself to no distance from the burning body. The author of the book of Wisdom, chap. xvii. 2-19, gives a fearful description of this plague. He says, \"The Egyptians were shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness: and were fettered with the bonds of a long night. They were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished and troubled with strange apparitions; for neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear; but noises as of waters falling down sounded about them; and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.\n\nNo power of the fire could give them light-only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself very dreadful; for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not. For though no terrible thing did scare them, yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear: for whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken; for they were all bound with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of tripping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains, these things made them to swoon for fear.\" See Psalms 78:49.\n\nTo this description nothing need be added except this circumstance, that the darkness, with its attendant horrors, lasted for three days.

H. Roberts' list of parallels, which only had validity if one applied a hemispheric geography model to the Book of Mormon\n\nThe View of the Hebrews theory is yet another attempt to fit a secular origin to the Book of Mormon. Many of the criticisms proposed are based upon B. H. Roberts' list of parallels, which only had validity if one applied a hemispheric geography model to the Book of Mormon. There are a significant number of differences between the two books, which are easily discovered upon reading Ethan Smith's work. Many points that Ethan Smith thought were important are not mentioned at all in the Book of Mormon, and many of the \"parallels\" are no longer valid based upon current scholarship.[42]\n\nAdvocates of the Ethan Smith theory must also explain why Joseph, the ostensible forger, had the chutzpah to point out the source of his forgery. They must also explain why, if Joseph found this evidence so compelling, he did not exploit it for use in the Book of Mormon text itself, since the Book of Mormon contains no reference to the many \"unparallels\" that Ethan assured his readers virtually guaranteed a Hebrew connection to the Amerindians.\n\nQuestion: Was the View of the Hebrews theory of Book of Mormon origin advanced during the lifetime of Joseph Smith?\n\nThe theory the Joseph Smith plagiarized View of the Hebrews was never advanced during Joseph Smith's lifetime\n\nThe theory the Joseph Smith plagiarized View of the Hebrews was never advanced during his lifetime. The prevailing theory of the day was the Spalding Theory, which quickly lost credibility upon the discovery of an actual Spalding manuscript in 1884 which bore no resemblance to the Book of Mormon. There are no records which indicate that Joseph Smith came into contact with the View of the Hebrews during the period of time that he was translating the Book of Mormon. The View of the Hebrews theory was in fact first proposed by I. Woodbridge Riley in 1902, 58 years after the death of the prophet.[43]\n\nJoseph Smith quoted View of the Hebrews as supporting the Book of Mormon\n\nThere was, however, a reference to View of the Hebrews within Joseph Smith's lifetime, but it came from the prophet himself. In an article published in the Times and Seasons on June 1, 1842, Joseph quoted View of the Hebrews in support of the Book of Mormon:\n\nIf such may have been the fact, that a part of the Ten Tribes came over to America, in the way we have supposed, leaving the cold regions of Assareth behind them in quest of a milder climate, it would be natural to look for tokens of the presence of Jews of some sort, along countries adjacent to the Atlantic. In order to this, we shall here make an extract from an able work: written exclusively on the subject of the Ten Tribes having come from Asia by the way of Bherings Strait, by the Rev. Ethan Smith, Pultney, Vt., who relates as follows: \"Joseph Merrick, Esq., a highly respectable character in the church at Pittsfield, gave the following account: That in 1815, he was leveling some ground under and near an old wood shed, standing on a place of his, situated on (Indian Hill)... [Joseph then discusses the supposed phylacteries found among Amerindians, citing View of the Hebrews p. 220, 223.][44]\n\nIt strains credulity to claim that Joseph drew attention to the work from which he derived most of his ideas. Why would he call attention to the source of his forgery?\n\nQuestion: What are the similarities and differences between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon?\n\nExamples of parallels and differences\n\nSome parallels do exist between the two books. For example, View of the Hebrews postulates the existence of a civilized and a barbarous nation who were constantly at war with one another, with the civilized society eventually being destroyed by their uncivilized brethren. This has obvious similarities to the story of the Nephites and the Lamanites in the Book of Mormon.\n\n\"Parallels\" that actually aren't parallels\n\nMany of the \"parallels\" that are discussed are not actually parallels at all once they are fully examined:\n\nBoth speak of... View of the Hebrews Book of Mormon ...the destruction of Jerusalem... ...by the Romans in A.D. 70. ...by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. ...Israelites coming to the American continent... ...via dry land across the Bering Strait. ...via the ocean on board a ship. ...colonists spread out to fill the entire land... ...from the North to the South. ...from the South to the North. ...a great lawgiver (whom some assume to be associated with the legend of Quetzalcoatl)... ...who is identified as Moses. ...who is identified as Jesus Christ. ...an ancient book that was preserved for a long time and then buried... ...because they had lost the knowledge of reading it and it would be of no further use to them. [45] ...in order to preserve the writings of prophets for future generations. ...a buried book taken from the earth... ...in the form of four, dark yellow, folded leaves of old parchment.[46] ...in the form of a set of gold metal plates. ...the Egyptian language, since ...an Egyptian influence is present in hieroglyphic paintings made by native Americans.[47] ...a reformed Egyptian was used to record a sacred history.\n\nParallels that are everywhere\n\nSome \"parallels\" between the Book of Mormon and View of the Hebrews are actually parallels with the Bible as well:\n\nThe Book of Mormon View of the Hebrews The King James Bible The Book of Mormon tells the story of inspired seers and prophets. View of the Hebrews talks of Indian traditions that state that their fathers were able to foretell the future and control nature. The Bible tells the story of inspired seers and prophets. The Book of Mormon was translated by means of the Nephite interpreters, which consisted of two stones fastened to a breastplate, and later by means of a seer stone, both of which were later referred to by the name \"Urim and Thummim\" three years after the translation was completed. View of the Hebrews describes a breastplate with two white buttons fastened to it as resembling the Urim and Thummim. The Bible describes the Urim and Thummim as being fastened to a breastplate (Exodus 28:30).\n\nThis highlights the fact that general parallels are likely to be found between works that treat the same types of subjects, such as ancient history. In what ancient conflict did one side not see themselves as representing light and civilization against the dark barbarism of their enemies?\n\n\"Unparallels\"\n\nCritics generally ignore the presence of many \"unparallels\"—these are elements of Ethan Smith's book which would have provided a rich source of material for Joseph to use in order to persuade his contemporaries that the Book of Mormon was an ancient history of the American Indians, and that they were descended from Israel. Yet, the Book of Mormon consistently ignores such supposed \"bulls-eyes,\" which is good news for proponents of the Book of Mormon's authenticity, since virtually all of Ethan's \"evidences\" have been judged to be false or misleading.\n\nThe lack of such \"unparallels\" is bad news, however, for anyone wanting to claim that Joseph got his inspiration or information from Ethan Smith.\n\nScripture use in View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon\n\nIf the View of the Hebrews served as the basis for the Book of Mormon, one would think that the Bible scriptures used by Ethan Smith would be mined by Joseph Smith for the Book of Mormon. Yet, this is not the case.\n\nWhy was this only discovered later?\n\nNo contemporary critic of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon pointed out the supposedly \"obvious\" connection to the View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon. It is only with the failure of the Spaulding theory that critics began seeking a new naturalistic explanation for Joseph's production of a 500+ book of scripture. As Stephen Ricks notes:\n\nBeyond these \"unparallels,\" there is a further question that must be answered by proponents of the View of the Hebrews hypothesis: why do none of the early critics of the Book of Mormon mention Ethan Smith in their attacks on it? If the parallels are so evident, why weren't they noticed by individuals who were not only acquainted with Ethan Smith's book, but were also existentially interested in its claims? Why wasn't it prominently mentioned as a source for the Book of Mormon until the beginning of the twentieth century, when the book itself had only an antiquarian interest and its contents were no longer so widely a part of popular discussion? My suspicion is that what appear today to be \"distinctives\" of View of the Hebrews, eschatological and otherwise, seemed less so in the early part of the nineteenth century, when these ideas flowed freely in published and unpublished forums.[48]\n\nResponse to claim: 61 - Anyone who looked on the gold plates would die\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nAnyone who looked on the gold plates would die.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nMartin Harris, Tiffany's Monthly interview, 1859.\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: The author has stated erroneous information or misinterpreted their sources\n\nJoseph said that he would be destroyed if he showed the plates to anyone, not that anyone else would be destroyed.\n\nQuestion: Did Joseph Smith say that viewing the gold plates would result in death?\n\nThe only first-person account—that made by Joseph Smith himself—says that it was Joseph who would be destroyed if he showed the plates to any other person unless commanded to do so by the Lord\n\nIt is claimed that Joseph Smith said that the penalty for viewing the gold plates was death, and that this was just a way for Joseph to hide the fact that the plates really didn't exist. However, the only first-person account—that made by Joseph Smith himself—says that it was Joseph who would be destroyed if he showed the plates to any other person unless commanded to do so by the Lord. Many accounts attributed to Joseph in which he is supposed to have claimed that anyone else who viewed the plates would die originated with people who were hostile to Joseph and the Church. Significantly, Emma's statement makes no mention of the alleged penalty associated with the unauthorized viewing of the plates.\n\nPrimary source: Joseph Smith's own words\n\nJoseph Smith-History 1:42 describes the conditions under which Joseph was to handle the plates:\n\nAgain, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken—for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it. (emphasis added)\n\nAccording to this, it was Joseph who risked destruction if he showed the plates to anyone unless explicitly commanded to do so by the Lord, not the person to whom he showed them.\n\nOf course, we also have the testimony of the Three and Eight witnesses, who all viewed the plates without any threat of destruction.\n\nThe idea that God would \"strike down\" anyone who viewed the plates came from a hostile secondary source\n\nFawn Brodie claimed that Joseph told Martin Harris that God's wrath would strike him down if he examined the plates or looked at him while he was translating. This is supported by a second-hand source: Charles Anthon's statement regarding the visit of Martin Harris in Eber D. Howe's anti-Mormon book Mormonism Unvailed. Anthon stated:\n\nI adverted once more to the roguery which had been in my opinion practised upon [Harris], and asked him what had become of the gold plates. He informed me that they were in a trunk with the large pair of spectacles. I advised him to go to a magistrate and have the trunk examined. He said the \"curse of God\" would come upon him should he do this. [49]\n\nIn the critical bookMormonism Unvailed, Peter Ingersoll and Sophia Lewis claimed that Joseph told them that anyone who viewed the plates would perish.\n\nPeter Ingersoll was a hostile source. Here is what he claims that Joseph said to him:\n\n...On my entering the house, I found the family at the table eating dinner. They were all anxious to know the contents of my frock. At that moment, I happened to think of what I had heard about a history found in Canada, called the golden Bible; so I very gravely told them it was the golden Bible. To my surprise, they were credulous enough to believe what I said. Accordingly I told them that I had received a commandment to let no one see it, for, says I, no man can see it with the naked eye and live. However, I offered to take out the book and show it to them, but they refuse to see it, and left the room.\" Now, said Jo, \"I have got the damned fools fixed, and will carry out the fun.\" Notwithstanding, he told me he had no such book, and believed there never was any such book....(emphasis added)[50]\n\nHere we have a statement alleged to have been made by Joseph Smith that \"no man can see it with the naked eye and live.\" However, we also see that, according to Peter Ingersoll, Joseph came up with the entire idea of the \"golden bible\" on the spur of the moment as a way to have \"fun.\" Then he claims that Joseph confided to him that the plates didn't actually exist at all. There are so many inconsistencies between this story and the statements of numerous other witnesses that one wonders if Peter Ingersoll was the one who was having some \"fun\" with his audience. Ingersoll can also be discredited on his claim that Joseph made the story up on the spot, because Joseph was telling various people about his Moroni visits well before recovering the plates (see for example various Knight family recollections).\n\nExamining the testimony of Sophia Lewis we find:\n\nSOPHIA LEWIS, certifies that she \"heard a conversation between Joseph Smith, Jr., and the Rev. James B. Roach, in which Smith called Mr. R. a d-----d fool. Smith also said in the same conversation that he (Smith) was as good as Jesus Christ;\" and that she \"has frequently heard Smith use profane language. She states that she heard Smith say \"the Book of Plates could not be opened under penalty of death by any other person but his (Smith's) first-born, which was to be a male.\" She says she \"was present at the birth of this child, and that it was still-born and very much deformed.\"(emphasis added)[51]\n\nHere we find that not only could the plates not be viewed by another person, but that the only person who could \"open\" them would be Joseph's first-born child. Sophia Lewis's testimony is suspicious however. Hezekiah M'Kune, Levi Lewis and Sophia Lewis went together to make their depositions before the justice. Their testimonies bear a remarkable similarity and contain the unique claim that Joseph claimed to be \"as good as Jesus Christ.\" This claim is not related by any other individuals who knew the Prophet, suggesting that these three individuals planned and coordinated their story before giving their depositions. [52]\n\nJoseph's wife Emma did not recall any specific threat of destruction associated with the unauthorized viewing of the plates\n\nIt is interesting to note that Emma Smith, admittedly much closer to her husband Joseph than the hostile sources previously quoted, never mentioned a penalty for viewing the plates. In fact, in an interview with her son Joseph Smith III in 1879, the following conversation was recorded:\n\n[Joseph Smith III} Q: I should suppose that you would have uncovered the plates and examined them?\n\n[Emma Smith Bidamon] A. I did not attempt to handle the plates, other than I have told you, nor uncover them to look at them. I was satisfied that it was the work of God, and therefore did not feel it to be necessary to do so.\n\nMajor Bidamon here suggested: Did Mr. Smith forbid your examining the plates?\n\n[Emma] A. I do not think he did. I knew that he had them, and was not specially curious about them. I moved them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work.\n\n[JS III] Q. Mother, what is your belief about the authenticity, or origin, of the Book of Mormon?\n\n[Emma] A. My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity - I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.(emphasis added)[53]\n\nEmma, therefore, did not recall any specific threat of destruction associated with the unauthorized viewing of the plates.\n\nResponse to claim: 62, 361n69-72 - The witnesses never actually physically saw the plates - they only saw them in visions\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nThe witnesses never actually physically saw the plates - they only saw them in visions.\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nGrant H. Palmer, An Insider's View of Mormon Origins (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002) 175-176. ( Index of claims )\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: This claim is false\n\nThe author takes Grant Palmer's assertion and treats it as fact. There are many statements from the witnesses indicating that they physically viewed the plates.\n\nQuestion: Did the three witnesses's experience of seeing the plates and the angel take place only in their minds?\n\nThe Three Witnesses were very explicit that they had actually seen the angel and the plates\n\nSome critics suggest that the witnesses’ encounter with the angel and the plates took place solely in their minds. They claim that witnesses saw the angel in a “vision” and equate “vision” with imagination. To bolster this claim they generally cite two supposed quotes from Martin Harris. Supposedly Harris was once asked if he saw the plates with his “naked eyes” to which he responded, “No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.”[54] In another interview Harris allegedly claimed that he only saw the plates in a “visionary or entranced state.”[55]\n\nOliver Cowdery wrote explicitly for himself and Martin Harris when he replied, in a November 1829 letter, to questions about whether \"juggling\" (i.e., trickery or conjuring) could have explained what they saw:\n\n\"It was a clear, open beautiful day, far from any inhabitants, in a remote field, at the time we saw the record, of which it has been spoken, brought and laid before us, by an angel, arrayed in glorious light, [who] ascend [descended I suppose] out of the midst of heaven. Now if this is human juggling—judge ye.\"[56]\n\nCritics impose their own interpretation on phrases that do not match what the witnesses reported in many separate interviews. When challenged on the very point which the critics wish to read into their statements—their literal reality—both Harris and the other witnesses were adamant that their experience was literal, real, and undeniable. As early convert William E. McLellin reported:\n\n\"D[avid] Whitmer then arose and bore testimony to having seen an Holy Angel who had made known the truth of this record to him. [A]ll these strange things I pondered in my heart.\"[57]\n\nResponse to claim: 64 - Martin Harris said that he never saw the plates with his \"natural eyes\"\n\nThe author(s) of Becoming Gods make(s) the following claim:\n\nMartin Harris said that he never saw the plates with his \"natural eyes.\"\n\nAuthor's sources:\n\nLDS apostle Stephen Burnett, letter to Lyman E. Johnson, April 15, 1838 reprinted in Vogel, Early Mormon Documents 2:291\n\nFAIR's Response\n\nFact checking results: The author has stated erroneous information or misinterpreted their sources\n\nMisrepresentation of source Harris said many times that he actually saw the plates, but he sometimes used scriptural language to describe the experience. Critics assume this to mean that he didn't actually see them, or that it was his imagination.\n\nQuestion: Did Martin Harris tell people that he did not see the plates with his natural eyes, but rather the \"eye of faith\"?\n\nA former pastor, John A. Clark, said that a \"gentleman in Palmyra\" told him that Harris said that he saw the plates with the \"eye of faith\"\n\nJohn A. Clark, a former pastor who considered Joseph Smith a fraud and the Book of Mormon “an imposture,” states,\n\nTo know how much this testimony [of three witnesses] is worth I will state one fact. A gentleman in Palmyra, bred to the law, a professor of religion, and of undoubted veracity told me that on one occasion, he appealed to Harris and asked him directly,-”Did you see those plates?” Harris replied, he did. “Did you see the plates, and the engraving on them with your bodily eyes?” Harris replied, “Yes, I saw them with my eyes,-they were shown unto me by the power of God and not of man.” “But did you see them with your natural,-your bodily eyes, just as you see this pencil-case in my hand? Now say no or yes to this.” Harris replied,-”Why I did not see them as I do that pencil-case, yet I saw them with the eye of faith; I saw them just as distinctly as I see any thing around me,-though at the time they were covered over with a cloth.[58]\n\nJohn A. Clark did not interview Martin Harris - he was repeating what someone else told him\n\nThe source cited is “Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 & 1828,” Early Mormon Documents 2:270. However, rather than being an interview between Clark and Harris, as implied by the title of reference work using in the citation, Clark’s actual statement clearly says that he received his information from a “gentleman in Palmyra…a professor of religion,” who said that he had talked with Harris. This is not an interview between Clark and Harris.\n\nLarry E. Morris notes that the “claim that ‘Harris told John A. Clark’ is not accurate. This is not secondhand testimony but thirdhand—’he said that he said that he said.’….As if that weren’t enough, Clark does not name his source—making it impossible to judge that person’s honesty or reliability. What we have is a thirdhand, anonymous account of what Martin Harris supposedly said.” (Larry E. Morris, FARMS Review, Vol. 15, Issue 1.)\n\nClark's account mixes elements from both before and after Harris viewed the plates as one of the Three Witnesses and portrays Harris as contradicting himself\n\nThe two elements that are mixed together in Clark's account are the following:\n\nMartin Harris said that he only saw the plates through the \"eye of faith\" when they were covered with a cloth prior to his experience as a witness.\n\nMartin Harris saw the plates uncovered as one of the three witnesses.\n\nNote also that the date assigned to these comments places them prior to the publication of the Book of Mormon, yet Clark’s statement appears to include elements from both before and after Harris viewed the plates as a witness. Harris “saw them” with his eyes when he acted as one of the Three Witnesses, but he only saw them through the “eye of faith” when they were covered with a cloth prior to his being a witness. Clark’s third-hand hostile relation of another hostile source, makes no distinction between these events, and instead portrays Harris as contradicting himself.\n\nWhen Martin Harris said that he had seen the angel and the plates with his \"spiritual eyes\" or with an \"eye of faith\" he may have simply been employing some scriptural language that he was familiar with. Such statements do not mean that the angel and the plates were imaginary, hallucinatory, or just an inner mental image—the earliest accounts of Martin Harris' testimony makes the literal nature of the experience unmistakable.\n\nRather than being hallucinatory or \"merely\" spiritual, Martin claimed that the plates and angel were seen by physical eyes that had been enhanced by the power of God to view more objects than a mortal could normally see (cf. D&C 76꞉12; D&C 67꞉10-13).\n\nQuestion: Did Martin Harris tell people that he only saw the plates with his \"spiritual eye\"?\n\nJohn H. Gilbert, who printed the Book of Mormon, reported that Harris said that he saw the plates with his \"spiritual eye\"\n\nJohn H. Gilbert:\n\nMartin was in the office when I finished setting up the testimony of the three witnesses,—(Harris—Cowdery and Whitmer—) I said to him,—\"Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?\" Martin looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, \"No, I saw them with a spir[i]tual eye.\"[59]\n\nPomeroy Tucker told of Harris usi"
