Guru Hargobind also had a platform constructed in honour of Guru Nanak. The villagers obeyed Guru Hargobind and shifted to the site of the present village from where they would come to make obeisance at the Thara Sahib, or the sacred platform, and to have a dip in the holy pool.

(2) Shri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji tied his horse to a Karir Tree. Later when the construction of Gurudwara Sahib was going on, some person unknowingly cut the Karir tree and constructed a room there. But with passing of time Karir tree grew up again and came out of the roof of the room. Another compound houses the Guru ka Langar. The old pond has been lined and converted into a sarovar.

Once Sant Atar Singh came to Sunam and held a congregation. He told the present sangat about the importance of the place about Guru Nanak’s visit and asked the sangat to construct a suitable Gurdwara at the place commemorating Gru Nanak’s vsit. It will be a great center of worship and spifitjual centre and people will throng from near and far to visit it. With Captain Ram Singh leading, the sangat joined hand to construct a marvellous struture in honour of Guru Nanak Dev ji. Sant Baba Jagtar Singh and sant baba Kirpal Singh ji added further to its glory adding sarovar, langar hall and residential place for the tourists. Now regular congregtions are held on various gurpurabs and historical days and the sangat comes in large number.\n\nGurdwara Patshahi Pehli is situated at a distance of 19 km from the city of Sangrur in a town called Sunam. This religious edifice was built to honour Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji - the first guru.

This gurdwara is constructed in 1919 and refurbished in 1966. It consists of a rectangular hall, gallery, a verandah, a brick-paved courtyard and a domed tower.
