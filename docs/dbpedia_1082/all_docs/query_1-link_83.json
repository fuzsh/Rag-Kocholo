        "text": "Meanwhile, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh skipped the state-level function held here to mark the 79th death anniversary of the freedom fighter due to an ‘urgent meeting’ in Delhi.\n\nIn CM’s absence, Dharamsot presided over the function. Cabinet ministers Razia Sultana and Vijay Inder Singla, Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh, local Congress leader Daman Thind Bajwa and Dhuri MLA Dalbir Singh Goldy were also present on the occasion.\n\n“The CM had to attend an urgent meeting in Delhi. However, he asked me to make the announcement regarding the memorial,” he said while addressing the gathering.\n\nNotably, the land for Shaheed Udham Singh memorial was acquired under the previous SAD-BJP government, but it could not be developed for lack of funds.\n\n“It is unfortunate that former finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa, who had represented Sunam constituency, could not provide the required funds for the martyr’s memorial during his tenure,” said Dharamsot.\n\nIt is for the second time when the CM missed a state-level function held in the district this year. Earlier, he could not attend the farm debt waiver event in Bhawanigarh on April 12 after his chopper developed a glitch.\n\nLip chief also pays homage\n\nMeanwhile, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjeet Singh Bains separately reached Sunam along with his supporters and paid homage to the martyr at his statue.\n\nReacting to Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann’s tweet over the crisis in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bains said if Mann is disheartened, he should join Bathinda convention scheduled to be held on August 2, called by Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who has been removed as leader of opposition"
