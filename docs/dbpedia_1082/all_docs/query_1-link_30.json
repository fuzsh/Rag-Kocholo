        "text": "Sardar Udham Singh was tried and executed by the British Government in 1940 for the murder of Sir Michael O'Dwyer, who was involved in the infamous Jallinawala Bagh massacre.\n\nKey Points\n\nOn 13 April 1919, British troops fired at a gathering of unarmed Indians at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar leading to the deaths of at least a thousand people.\n\nMichael O’Dwyer was the lieutenant governor of Punjab at the time of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar.\n\nDue to the deteriorating law and order situation in the province of Punjab, Michael O’Dwyer authorized British Army General, Reginal Dyer, to take necessary steps to bring about order in the province.\n\nThis held Michael O’Dwyer directly responsible for the massacre at Amritsar.\n\nThe Jallinawala Bagh massacre also had a profound effect on Sardar Udham Singh who at that point became actively involved in revolutionary activities and politics.\n\nUdham Singh was born as Sher Singh in 1899 in Sangrur district of Punjab.\n\nHe was named Udham Singh following Sikh rites.\n\nOn March 13, 1940, Michael O’Dwyer was scheduled to speak at a meeting in Caxton Hall in London.\n\nHe was shot dead at this meeting by Sardar Udham Singh in retaliation for the massacre in Amritsar.\n\nSardar Udham Singh, in his trial, stated that he did it in revenge against the horrific acts of the British Empire at Jallinawala Bagh.\n\nUdham Singh was charged for the assassination of Michael O’Dwyer by the British Government and executed on July 31st, 1940.\n\nHence, the correct answer is - Sardar Udham Singh.\n\n-> The UGC NET Exam Dates for the re-examination have been released.\n\n-> The UGC NET June 2024 exam will be conducted in CBT Mode from 21st August to 4th September 2024.\n\n-> The UGC-NET exam takes place in CBT mode for more than 80 subjects, to determine the eligibility for 'Junior Research Fellowship’ and ‘Assistant Professor’ posts.\n\n-> The exam comprises two papers - Paper I and Paper II. Paper I consists of 50 questions and Paper II consists of 100 questions.\n\n-> The candidates who are preparing for the exam can check the UGC NET Previous Year Papers and UGC NET Test Series to boost their preparations."
