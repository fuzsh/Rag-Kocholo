        "text": "UDHAM SINGH\n\nUdham Singh was born on 26th December, 1899 at Sunam. His father, Sardar Tehal Singh was a railway gate-keeper at Sunam. While he was a child, both his father and mother died leaving him an orphan. He was bought up and educated at the Sikh orphanage, Putli Ghar, Amritsar. At the time of Jallianwala Bagh Tragedy, he was one of the volunteers serving water at the meeting. When he saw the tragedy, he decided to avenge this massacre. He left India in 1920 and reached England after staying for some time in Africa and the United States of America where he met the members of revolutionary Ghadr Party. He returned to India in 1923 and was jailed for four years under the Arms Act. While in India he used to call himself Ram Mohammed Singh to symbolize Hindu-Muslim-Sikh unity. After his release from prison he went to Germany and from there he reached England again.\n\nOn March 13, 1940 at a meeting held in Caxton Hall, London, he shot dead Sir Michael O’Dwyer. Those injured included Lord Zetland, then Secretary of State for India and Sir Louis Dane, a former Liieut. Governor of Punjab. Udham Singh remained calm and according to news despatches he “stood almost non-chalantly after he was arrested”. Writing to a friend from the jail on 30th March, Udham Singh said he was not at all afraid of death. He did not even want himself to be defended. He pleaded guilty and was hanged on July 31, 1940. “What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland”, he had told the court.\n\nHis remains were bought to India on July 19, 1974 and recieved a great welcome in Delhi and all the towns of the Punjab including his home town, Sunam"
