He said that as of now the pistol of Shaheed Udham Singh is in Scotland with which he killed the then Lt. Governor of Punjab Michael O'Dwyer and diary is also somewhere there.\n\nSingh further said that the government of India should further take up this matter with the British High Commission so as to get these back.\n\nThe Chief Minister said there are several memorials like Jallianwala Bagh, Hussainiwala and now the newly built Shaheed Udham Singh and soon another memorial in the memory of numerous unknown heroes of freedom struggle would be constructed so as to pay glowing tributes to these sons of the soil. He said such monuments always remind us of our glorious legacy of valour and are instrumental in imbibing the spirit of patriotism amongst youngsters. (ANI)"
