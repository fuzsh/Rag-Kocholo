        "text": "Sangrur: After a struggle of 11 years, Sunam residents have succeeded in getting their railway station renamed to Sunam Udham Singh Wala. Railway authorities issued a notification in this regard two days back.\n\nEleven years ago, the then state government has said that the name of the town should be changed to Sunam Udham Singh Wala, but did not follow up the matter with the Railways properly which caused the delay to this matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name was changed to pay respect to martyr Udham Singh who belonged to the town. But when the state authorities failed to take up the matter with the Railways, residents started efforts for it in 2006.\n\nJatinder Jain, a local RTI activist, requested Punjab and Haryana High Court advocate HC Arora to file a PIL in November 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ministry replied regarding this matter that it did not have any problem with the name change, but it had not received the mandatory proposal and documents from the state government. All steps had only been taken verbally. It made things clear to all that the state government was at fault, not the Railways.\n\nDalip Yadav, commercial inspector of Railways posted at Sangrur, confirmed that Railways had issued a notification to change the name of the railway station and they have started the process. Adding on he said that we will change the board and other material of Sunam station to Sunam Udham Singh Wala on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nend-of"
