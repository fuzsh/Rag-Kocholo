Bhagwant Singh Mann said that Badals ignored the interests of the state only for the sake of constructing a canal to their farm house by Haryana as reward for his treachery with the state. He said that not only this the business of Badals in terms of Hotels, vilas, transport and others have flourished at the cost of the progress of the state, which will be told to the people in detail.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that Sukhbir is contesting the case for saving his property whereas he will go to the court to save the people. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that he will tell the world about all the misdeeds of the Badal family due to which the state had lagged behind in various fields. He said that the hands of the Badal family are drenched with the blood of the Punjab and Punjabis adding that people of the state can never forgive them for their sins.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that those people who used to claim that they will rule the state for 25 years have been totally rejected by the people. He said that these leaders have not been able to get their 25 MLAs elected as they have been trounced by the people. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that these haughty leaders have been shown a door by the people and have been sent to political oblivion.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that during the previous government the quotas of the political leaders had usurped the interests of the common man. However, Bhagwant Singh Mann said that after assuming the charge of office he has accorded top priority to end all such quotas and usher a new era of empowerment of common man. He said that the main motive is to ensure the welfare and progress of the people and ensure comprehensive development of the common man.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the traditional parties are envious of him because he hails from a common family and is working tirelessly to ensure welfare of people. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that these leaders had always believed that they have divine right to rule the state due to which they are not able to digest that a common man is running the state efficiently. He said that these leaders have befooled the people for a long time but now people are not getting swayed by their misleading propaganda.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the Union government has maliciously stalled the Mukh Mantri Teerth Yatra Scheme by not giving the trains to us. He said that the trains scheduled on December 7 and 15 have not been given to the state despite payment done in advance. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the sole motive is to deprive people of not paying obeisance at revered places adding that these designs of union government will not be successful as he will resume this yatra through airplane.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the Union government has insulted the great martyrs including Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Shaheed Rajguru, Shaheed Sukhdev, Lala Lajpat Rai, Shaheed Udham Singh, Shaheed Kartar Singh Sarabha, Mai Bhago, Ghadri Baabe and others by rejecting the tableau of the state. He said that the union government is trying to belittle their contribution and sacrifice of these heroes by not including their tableaus in the Republic Day parade. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that this cannot be tolerated as it is the grave insult of these great patriots and national leaders adding that the state government will showcase this contribution in tableaus across the state.\n\nThe Chief Minister predicted that the people are so fed up with corrupt leaders of these parties that we will sweep all the seats in the state during the coming general elections. He said that people have made up their mind to give all the 13 seats of the state in upcoming general elections to them. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the tally in coming Lok Sabha elections will be 13-0 where 13 will be in the favor of them and the other parties will not even be open to their accounts.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the state has created history by purchasing Goindwal power plant owned by a private company GVK Power. He said that for the first time this reverse trend has started that the government has purchased any private power plant whereas in the past the state governments used to sell their assets to the favorite individuals at ‘throw away’ prices. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that as coal from Pachwara coal mine can be used only for government power plants so with purchase of this power plant this coal can be aptly utilized for producing power to provide it to every sector of the state.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that now complete transformation is being witnessed in hospitals, schools and new medical colleges are coming up for the well being of the common man adding that 90% of the consumers are getting zero power bill . He said that these decisions are being taken only by those who are aware about the problems of the people at grass root levels. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the traditional political parties have ruined the state and now they are shamelessly making huge talks of morality.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the state government has earmarked more than Rs 29 crore for development of villages in Dhuri.

He said that all the promises made with the people by his government are being fulfilled in the right earnest to give boost to development of the state. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that he is easily accessible to all due to which every issue of the state is now resolved promptly to the satisfaction of people.\n\n-------\n\nCM CONTINUES SPREE TO SET UP ULTRA MODERN LIBRARIES IN THE STATE\n\nDEDICATES 14 NEW ULTRA MODERN LIBRARIES IN SANGRUR DISTRICT CONSTRUCTED AT A COST OF 4.62 CRORE\n\nENVISION THAT THESE LIBRARIES WILL ACT AS A HARBINGER OF GROWTH AND PROSPERITY IN THE STATE\n\nINAUGURATES WEIGHT LIFTING CENTRE AND ASTRO TURF AT THE WAR HEROES STADIUM\n\nSangrur, January 11-Continuing his spree to set up ultra modern libraries in the state, the Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann on Thursday dedicated 14 new ultra modern libraries in the Sangrur districts constructed at a cost of 4.62 crore.\n\nThe Chief Minister envisioned that these libraries will act as a harbinger of growth and prosperity in the state adding that this path breaking initiative is aimed at inculcating reading habits amongst the youth of the state.

ISSUES ADVISORY TO PROTECT LIVESTOCK FROM COLD WAVE\n\n• Keep animals under covered sheds; ensure nutrient quality feed to avoid hypothermia during extreme cold conditions\n\nChandigarh, January 11:On the directions of Punjab Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries Minister S. Gurmeet Singh Khudian, the Animal Husbandry department has issued an advisory to protect the livestock from bone-chilling cold weather accompanied by severe winds, which could prove hazardous for livestock and cause significant problems to their owners.\n\nUnder extreme winter storm conditions, the advisory suggests, simple shelters alone cannot be effective in protecting livestock so livestock farmers have been advised to use ‘pallis’ made from gunny bags in animal sheds. Keep animals indoors during extreme cold conditions and monitor them often. Monitor the temperature under the sheds, use heaters if required. Keep bedding as dry and clean as possible in order to avoid increased ammonia fumes. Blankets can be used on individual animals if required as Hypothermia occurs when the body temperature drops well below normal. In general terms, with cattle, mild hypothermia occurs with a body temperature of 30°C-32 (86°F-89°F), moderate hypothermia at 22°F-29°C (71°F-85°F) and severe hypothermia below 20°C (68°F). Cows are not able to return to normal temperature without assistance through warming and the administration of warm fluids.\n\nIn the advisory, it has also been recommended not to graze cattle in extreme cold weather and maintain a larger feed storage. Very young, very old or sick animals will typically have additional nutritional needs during winter as compared to healthy, middle aged animals. Having abundant and accessible feed will help animals maintain body temperature and survive cold temperatures. Farmers have been asked to ensure that stored winter feed is of good nutrient quality.\n\nApart from this, consuming enough water is pivotal for animal health and well-being during the winter season. Livestock will not consume an adequate amount of water if it is too cold. Therefore, the livestock farmers have been advised to ensure access to fresh water for livestock.\n\nIt has been recommended to seek veterinary treatment immediately to address any concerns especially for pregnant and very young or very old animals, which require special attention.\n\n------------\n\nCHETAN SINGH JAURAMAJRA ASSURES ALL POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO POTATO GROWERS\n\nChandigarh, January 11:Punjab Horticulture Minister S.
