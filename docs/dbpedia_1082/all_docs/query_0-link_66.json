He said that as now the pistol of Shaheed Udham Singh is in Scotland with which he killed the then Lt. Governor of Punjab Michael Oâ€™Dwyer and diary is also somewhere there.\n\nCapt Amarinder said the Union Government should further take up this matter with the British High Commission to get these back. After getting these pride possessions of legendary martyr from abroad would be kept in the museum here for the general public as the government intends to make this historic memorial as a world class, he added."
