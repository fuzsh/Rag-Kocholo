        "text": "FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH TO ENSURE WELFARE OF EVERY SECTION OF SOCIETY- SAYS CM\n\nJagdish Thind\n\nSangrur, June 29-\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann on Saturday said that his government in the state was following the footsteps of Sher-E- Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh to ensure the wellbeing of every strata of society.\n\nThe Chief Minister, while addressing the gathering during a state level function to mark death anniversary of Maharaja here today, said that Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a great emperor who practiced the ethos of secularism and socialism in right earnest as propagated by our great Sikh gurus. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that as an ardent Sikh, Maharaja Ranjit Singh ensured dispensation of justice and the welfare of all his subjects adding that he even toured the state in disguise during night to feel the pulse of his subjects. He said that due to his love and affection towards people Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a true monarch of masses.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that Sher-E-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the founder of the Sikh empire that vastly extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, and Tibet in the east. He said that following the footsteps of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the state government has initiated a number of pro people schemes for welfare of every strata of society. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that every effort is being made by the state government to perpetuate the glorious legacy of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\n\nThe Chief Minister also said that he was fortunate that he has got an opportunity to visit this sacred place blessed by Sant Baba Attar Singh ji. He said that despite being a king in those times, Maharaja Ranjit Singh readily accepted the punishment bestowed to him from Sri Akal Takht Sahib. However, Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the previous leaders of the state who claimed to give governance like Maharaja Ranjit Singh left no stone unturned to demean the authority of Sri Akal Takht Sahib.\n\nThe Chief Minister bemoaned that the successive governments in the state ignored this sacred land associated with Maharaja Ranjit Singh. On the contrary, he said that the previous regimes patronized the drug mafia in the state due to which the younger generations of the state have been ruined. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that legendary martyrs like Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Shaheed Sukhdev, Shaheed Rajguru, Shaheed Kartar Singh Sarabha, Shaheed Udham Singh and others had sacrificed their lives for the sake of country whereas the previous rulers of the state had left no stone unturned to plunder the state.\n\nThe Chief Minister thanked the people of Sangrur Parliamentary segment for electing Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer as the MP from the seat adding that the new Parliamentarian will vehemently raise voice of the region in Lok Sabha. He said that massive development of Sangrur segment is on cards as now the MP and state government will synchronize their efforts to give fillip to its development. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the state government is leaving no stone unturned for the progress of the state and prosperity of its people adding that the state will see unprecedented development in the coming two years.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the leaders of opposition parties are building castles in air by claiming that his government was unstable and will fall soon. However, he said that his government will complete its tenure with the support of people who have given verdict in the favor of the pro-people government by giving 92 seats. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the Akali Dal formed in 1920 is in dire straits and is on verge of extinction after 2020 whereas they claimed that they will rule for 25 years.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that people will never forgive Akalis as they had committed the unpardonable crime of sacrilege of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that he will not seek funds from the centre for the development of the state but the state will generate its own resources. He said that the centre is adopting step motherly treatment with the state as people of Punjab have ousted them by not even giving a single seat to them.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the state government will now give wheat to people under the Ghar Ghar ration scheme and that too for four months. He said that the state government will soon recruit 10,000 new cops in the Punjab Police for which notification has already been issued. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the state government is committed for embarking on an era of reverse migration in the state by empowering the youth.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that for the first time in the history of the state water has reached the tail end of the canal adding that it will play a pivotal role in saving ground water. He quipped that people of Punjab worship ‘Khwaza Peer’ but leaders like Captain and Sukhbir are not aware about this water deity as they never visited the ground. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that every effort is being made by the state government to facilitate the people whereas the earlier rulers had never bothered about it.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the traditional parties are envious of him because he hails from a common family due to which they spit venom against him daily. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that these leaders who believed that they have divine right to rule the state due to which they are not able to digest that a common man is running the state efficiently. He said that these leaders have befooled the people for a long time but now people are not getting swayed by their misleading propaganda.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the state government had scripted a new success story by purchasing Goindwal power plant earlier owned by a private company GVK Power. He said that for the first time a reverse trend was witnessed in the state as the government purchased a private power plant whereas in the past the state governments used to sell their assets to the favorite individuals at ‘throw away’ prices. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that this power plant is the cheapest purchase made by any state/private company and is a historic initiative but the opposition never praises it despite the fact that 90% power consumers are getting free power.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the state government will soon construct Malwa canal to cater to the needs of the farmers in the Malwa region of the state. He said that the areas like Gidderbaha. Lambi and others will be benefited from it adding that it will be the first canal to be constructed in the post independence era. Bhagwant Singh Mann the previous rulers had never bothered about these issues and had ignored these matters much to the dismay of the common man.\n\nThe Chief Minister dared leaders like Sukhbir Singh Badal, Bikram Singh Majithia, Partap Singh Bajwa, Sukhpal Singh Khaira and others to clear even basic written exams of Punjabi. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that it is sure that these power mad politicians must be knowing the name of the capital of state but he said that it is doubly sure that they can’t write it in Punjabi. He said that these leaders who had taken education from Sanawar and Doon school are not aware of the basic Punjabi and can’t clear this exam.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that Chief Minister’s help desks are being set in every district of the state, so that people could avail the benefits of government services through them adding that dedicated officers will be sitting at this desk and receiving the applications from the general public for getting their routine administrative works done. He said that the applications pertaining to the administrative works within the district will be sent to the concerned department, for immediate execution of the work, adding that the works related to the state government will be sent to his office from where it will be further sent to the administrative departments for their early resolution. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that the Chief Minister’s dashboard will be continuously monitoring the entire activity, across the districts along with taking feedback from the general public regarding their applications and pending works.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the state government is committed for setting up a Medical College at Mastuana Sahib adding that they are already mulling several proposals for it. He unequivocally said that forces inimical to development of state have stalled this ambitious project, which could have transformed the fortunes of the people of the region. Bhagwant Singh Mann said that these people have no interest in the well being of the people but they are always bothered about their vested political interests.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Minister also paid tributes to Sher-E-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh at his memorial in his maternal village.\n\nProminent amongst others present on the occasion included Cabinet Minister Aman Arora, MLA Narinder Kaur Bharaj and other dignitaries."
