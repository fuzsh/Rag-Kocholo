        "text": "News\n\nCity News\n\nchandigarh News\n\nBritish Spied On Udham For Years Before OâDwyer Killing\n\nThis story is from December 23, 2023\n\nBritish Spied On Udham For Years Before OâDwyer Killing\n\nBritish spies had been tracking Udham Singh's activities in England for four years before the Caxton Hall firing. Udham's activities had become a source of curiosity for British authorities in 1936. He had sought endorsement from British authorities to visit several European countries. British records reveal that Udham visited Poland, Latvia, and Russia, which raised suspicions. Despite being under surveillance, Udham managed to enter Caxton Hall and accomplish his task of killing Michael O'Dwyer in the presence of other prominent elites.\n\nUdham Singh had claimed to have lived at Thurlestone village in South Devon, England, in 1931\n\nNumerous books, stories and countless popular culture tales have told generations of Indians that martyr Udham Singh, the avenger of Jallianwala Bagh massacre whose 124th birth anniversary falls on December 26, caught the British unawares.\n\nThat Udham, around 21 years after the massacre, suddenly and without being noticed, had surfaced on March 13, 1940, in the heart of the British capital and took moments to kill Michael OâDwyer , who was Punjabâs lieutenant governor at the time of Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nHowever, if one believes extracts from âsecretâ notes exchanged between British intelligence sleuths active in England in 1930s, British spies had been tracking Udhamâs activities in England for four years before the Caxton Hall firing.\n\nAvailable extracts of files have revealed that British authorities began tracking Udham from mid-1936, when Dwyerâs killing was still four years away. For nearly 57 years after the incident, the entire official record related to Dwyer murder had remained inaccessible till 1997, when members of Brimingham-based Shaheed Udham Singh Welfare Trust gained access to a set of five files after an eight-year campaign.\n\nFor the first time, the content of files became public after it was reproduced in the book 'Emergence of The Image: Redact Documents of Udham Singh', which was co-authored by Dr Navtej Singh, retired professor at department of historical research, Punjabi University, Patiala, and Avtar Singh Jouhl, the then general secretary of Indian Workers Association of Great Britain and a visiting fellow at University of Warwick.\n\nExtracts from these files suggested that Udham Singh had become a source of âcuriosityâ for British authorities in 1936, when Udham, while residing in England, had sought âendorsementâ (permission) from British authorities to visit Holland, Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary and Italy on May 10, 1936.\n\nIn a communication written on May 25, 1936, a British official noted, âI agree that this case has some curious features, but I donât think the endorsement should be refused if the applicant UDHAM SINGH (sic) applied again.â\n\nUdham was arrested by Britishish. WhileIndian police in Amritsar in 1927 on the charges of possessing illegal arms and possessing prohibited literature and issues of Ghadr Di Gunj â the magazine published by Ghadar party.\n\nHe spent five years in jail. In the official records of those years, he mentioned his name as Ude Singh. However, after his release, he obtained passport no. 52753 from Lahore, under the name Udham Singh on March 20, 1933. Apart from other factors, similarity in names was one of the reasons that had made him âcuriousâ for the British.\n\nAs per British records, Udham visited Poland, Latvia and Russia and returned to London on June 25, 1936. His last spot during the sojourn was the Russian city of Leningrad â then a hub of communist activities. This visit to Leningrad raised British suspicions.\n\nExtract from another report, which was written in November 1936, clearly gives a glimpse of this suspicion. âThis Indian (Udham Singh), to whose arrival from Leningrad reference was made in previous report, has been heard to express subservice views and to boast that he has smuggled revolvers to Indiaâ, the authorities wrote in a âsecretâ report.\n\nThis report, along with several such other communications exchanged between British authorities years before the Caxton Hall firing incident, reveals British spies' desperation to dig out details of his residence in England and what his subject was up to.\n\nâHe declared that he was residing at 30, Church Lane, E. But subsequent enquiries disclosed that the address is occupied by the firm of merchants and general warehouse-men â¦ he has never resided there and his whereabouts are unknown to this company,â reads the âsecretâ report. It is believed that he is cohabiting with a white woman somewhere in the West End of London and working at intervals on âcrowd-scenesâ at film studios,â concludes the report.\n\nBut by October 1937, British intelligence sleuths appeared to have joined all the dots and concluded that the person they were tailing since 1936 was none other than Ude Singh, a Ghadar party activist. In a secret communication dated October 11, 1937, the official noted, âUdham Singh, whose real name is Ude Singh, has a bad record, as will be seen from the attached summary of his history sheet.\n\nIn view of his conviction for arms smuggling in 1927 and his association with the Ghadar Party, the Indian authorities are strongly opposed to the grant of any endorsements which would facilitate his making new contacts with that party in the countries, which he now desires to visit.â\n\nâMoreover, he secured his current passport at Lahore by giving his name as Udham Singh instead of Ude Singh and by indulging in a series of skillful prevarications as to previous travel documents and precious applications made by him.\n\nThe question of his prosecution on this score after his return to India is still under consideration by Indian authorities, who would in any event oppose renewal of his passport, which is due to expire next March, should he apply for such a renewal. It is therefore recommended that Udham Singhâs present application should be refused,â reads the communication.\n\nSimilar communication was post-ed 40 days later, on November 22, 1937, wherein the officer wrote: âYou will see from this note that Udham Singh spent some seven years in the USAâ¦Udham Singh served five years imprisonment in India in 1927-1931 for having smuggled in two revolvers and ammunition. It was clear at the same time that in so doing, he was infected by Ghadar propaganda as the result of contact with the Ghadar party in California.\n\nThere are adequate grounds therefore for maintaining a refusal to give him an endorsement for the USA.â\n\nBy February 1938, the British were not only tracking Udham but also keeping record of politically active persons whom he was meeting.\n\nIn an intelligence report of February 23, 1938, authorities noted: âUdham Singh left Dover for France on February 15. It was ascertained that he was being met at Dunkirk by Dr Hazara Singh. Udham Singh returned on February 19, accompanied by two other British Indians viz Habib G Patel and VR Koppikar, who had apparently recently arrived (in) France from Indiaâ¦On arrival in London, the three proceeded to the Indian Students Hostel, Gower Street, WC.â\n\nAvailable records reveal that atleast three more intelligence reports concerning Udham were prepared by British sleuths in July, August and October months of 1938. Interestingly, these reports were not based on any political activity of Udham Singh but were centered around a minor personal dispute, which the revolutionary and his friend had with the Indian owner of their company.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether British spies continued to extensively track Udham Singh for the whole of 1939 and first quarter of 1940 or their attention diverted to other events in the beginning of World War II. Extracts from the secret intelligence reports donât offer an answer to this aspect of Udhamâs case.\n\nHowever, what they definitely answer is the fact that Udham, despite being under rigorous surveillance of British spies continuously for four years, had given them the slip. He managed to enter Caxton Hall in the heart of London city, that too duringthe years of World War II.\n\nHe managed to accomplish his task at a venue where, apart from Dwyer, some other prominent elites were also present, including Lawrence John Lumley Dundas (Lord Zetland), former secretary of state of British India; former brigadiergeneral of British Army, Sir Percy Sykes; and former governor of Bombay, Charles Cochrane-Baillie (Lord Lamington).\n\nHow did he manage that? The answer might have gone along with the revered martyr. Or, it is still lying buried in files stacked in dark corners of the British archives.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n8 flowers and plants that will attract birds to your garden\n\nLifestyle\n\n9 habits which will keep your skin young\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 delicious dishes to pair with Idli beyond Sambhar\n\nFood\n\nInternational Tiger Day: Indian national parks famous for Bengal tigers\n\ntravel\n\n10 negative impacts of strict parenting\n\nLifestyle\n\nInternational Beer Day 2024: 8 types of beer and ingredients used in making them\n\nFood\n\nâBeautiful baby girl names with letter 'M'â\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 most famous wildlife safaris across the globe\n\ntravel\n\nSawan special: Easy Makhana Mango Barfi made under 10 mins\n\nFood\n\n10 bird species extinct due to loss of habitat\n\nLifestyle"
