        "text": "Grievance Redressal Policy\n\nThe Mechanism of Redressal for Students\n\nVarious committees/cells have been formed to create a healthy environment in the college. Out of which Disciplinary Committee, Grievance Redressal Committee, Anti-Ragging Committee, Women Welfare Club, Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell and SC/ST/OBC Welfare Committee etc. are prominent. In these committees, any student can file a complaint or any suggestion or demand for any kind of discrimination. This complaint/suggestion or demand can be submitted in off-line and online mode (both). The facility of online complaint/suggestion or requisition submission is available at the college from the session 2018-19. The student can directly put the complaint/suggestion or demand letter in the complaint box installed in the library or can directly give this complaint/suggestion or demand letter to the concerned committee member or the principal. This complaint/suggestion is resolved only with the mutual cooperation of the concerned committees and the principal and with the consent of the complainant/demander.\n\nCollege policy regarding Student Grievance Redressal Cell (SGRC)\n\nIntroduction :-\n\nWe believe that the most important part of the institution is the students enrolled in various academic programs. Therefore, it is important that the institution provides a safe and comfortable environment to the students so that they can fully focus on their learning skills. Our institution is committed to create a friendly and comfortable environment for students. Therefore, we are making all possible efforts to make students feel comfortable in the premises of the institution. Our institution is well aware of the fact that one cannot remain indifferent to the possible incidents in relation to academic or non-academic which may affect any category of students. A Grievance Redressal Cell (GRC) was constituted in the college a few years back to keep in mind several such potential issues that could harm the academic structure and reputation of the institution, but in April 2023, following the new UGC norms. In doing so we have restructured it and constituted it under the name of Student Grievance Redressal Cell (SGRC). All kinds of grievances of the students related to the institution are first referred to the Student Grievance Redressal Cell (SCGRC). It is a regulatory body whose main function is to resolve issues related to student grievances.\n\nConstitution and Authority :-\n\nComposition of Student Grievance Redressal Committee as per UGC Student Grievance Rules 2023:-\n\nChairman (Professor or senior faculty member-only one)\n\nMembers (Professors or Senior Faculty Members - only four)\n\nMember (Student Representative-One Only)\n\nIn this way, a total six member committee is constituted. whose tenure is two years but student representative's tenure is only one year. Any committee member who is party to the grievance shall not serve as a member in the grievance redressal committee. The Principal reserves the right to nominate any other qualified faculty member on occasion to complete the number of members. One member of the committee must be a woman and one member must belong to the AC category. Its main objective is to ensure that no student is discriminated against on the basis of caste, race, religion, language, gender or disability. In order to run the Student Grievance Redressal Committee in a systematic manner, other committees of the institution work as collaborators. These committees are as follows:-\n\nDiscipline and Anti Ragging Committee.\n\nWomen Welfare and Prevention Sexual Harassment Cell.\n\nSC/ST/OBC Welfare Committee.\n\nFunctions of the Committee :-\n\nInteracting with students and departments to create a healthy and transparent academic environment.\n\nAnalyzing and resolving academic and administrative issues of students within the institution.\n\nLiaison between students and their department for redressal of grievances.\n\nAddressing harassment, or ragging or other such issues.\n\nProper provision for filing complaints under SGRC through college website and complaint box set up in library.\n\nEnsuring that information about SGRC is widely disseminated through various means.\n\nTo ensure that meetings of SGRC are held within the college premises during the working days of the college.\n\nTo ensure that the grievance redressal procedure followed by SGRC is basically drawn up on the basis of the guidelines received from time to time from the University, State Government and UGC.\n\nTo ensure that the concerned student can appear in person as well as present his/her parents or any special person to represent him/her if necessary.\n\nRedressal of any complaint within 15 days.\n\nThe language of the entire proceedings shall normally be Punjabi but providing Hindi and English translation as required.\n\nTo ensure that efforts are made to resolve the grievance only after hearing all the parties concerned.\n\nThe committee member shall prepare minutes of SGRC meeting and action taken report (ATR).\n\nObjectives of the Committee:-\n\nThe institution should provide students with transparent, fair learning systems as well as all opportunities for holistic development without any discrimination.\n\nTo prevent any undisciplined disposal.\n\nTo maintain a fair academic environment for students.\n\nCreating a healthy environment where people with genuine grievances can come forward without hesitation.\n\nUpholding the dignity of the institution and protecting its values, norms and principles.\n\nSupporting those who have been denied their rightful claim/service by the organization.\n\nTo ensure proper redressal of genuine grievances.\n\nWho can file a complaint with SGRC?\n\nAny student can file a complaint.\n\nProcedure of lodging a complaint:-\n\nAny student can lodge his complaint regarding any academic and non-academic matter within the campus online and through the complaint box established in the library.
