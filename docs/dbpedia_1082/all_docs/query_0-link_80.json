        "text": "Artist Gurdish Pannu was born and brought up in Punjab state of India. From the very beginning he was attracted towards the world of art just like a moth gets attracted towards the light. His initial education was completed in sangrur itself and then he moved to Chandigarh in order to complete his graduation in Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) from Govt. College of Art. He is a nature lover and a figurative artist who loves to paint in acrylic colors, oil colors and water colors. He gets inspiration from the works of great masters like Pablo Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh, Georges Braque, Michelangelo and Paul Cezanne. His first love is to visit as many places as possible around the world and reflect the different shades of our beloved nature in his artworks. His emotions are thoroughly exhibited through each and every one of his paintings. He believes it may take hours or even years to present a thought upon the canvas and sometimes it takes only a few seconds to do the job. He always tries to keep up with the modern world and its changing dynamics. Recently, he's been working with the acrylic colors using knife as his main tool and developing a mixture of surrealism and abstract art pieces. He's been presented with the following awards; - 1980 Punjab educational board (Sangrur region) appreciation award. - 1981 Punjab educational board (Patiala region) appreciation award. - 1982 Punjab educational board (Sangrur region) appreciation award. -1982 Science and Cultural Exhibition appreciation award. -1983 Punjab educational board (Sangrur region) appreciation award. -1985 Techno Fest 85 Exhibition (Chandigarh) appreciation award. - 1986 appreciation award at Govt. Polytechnic College, Ambala city, Haryana. -2000 appreciation award by Environment Welfare society, Punjab. -2013 appreciation award by Lalit Kala Akademy, Punjab."
