It has an average elevation of 231 metres (757 feet). Sunam falls under the district of Sangrur. Located on the Ludhiana-Hisar railway line, it is connected, by road with Patiala (64 km), Sangrur (13 km), Bathinda(95 km), Ludhiana (90 km), and Chandigarh (129 km).[2]\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of 2011 India census,[3] Sunam had a population of 334,641.

Sunam has an average literacy rate of 75.6%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 79.6%, and female literacy is 71%. In Sunam, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nHistory\n\nSunam is listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under the sarkar of Sirhind, producing a revenue of 7,067,696 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 2000 infantry and 500 cavalry. It had a brick fort at the time.[4]\n\nShaheed Udham Singh\n\nSunam is the birthplace of Shaheed Udham Singh, who shot former British Indian governor Michael O'Dwyer in revenge for his support of the notorious Jallianwala Bagh massacre on 13 March 1940.\n\nSamadh Baba Bhai Mool Chand Sahib Ji\n\nThis is a place in Sunam where people from all religions/communities come to pay homage to a great saint of the 17th century. Descendants of his legacy are known as 'Bhaike' as they all are from a small village near Sunam named 'Bhai Ki Pishour'. Once every year they congregate in this ancestral village named ' Chhajjli' app. 10 km from Sunam, of theirs in a social gathering known as 'Babe Mitti'. Now some of them are settled in Sunam mostly known by their surname 'Moudgil Modgil Joshi'. This is by far the most visited place in Sunam.\n\nOther famous religious places\n\nShaheed Udham Singh House\n\nBaba Bhai Mool Chand Sahib Ji\n\nMata Modi Mandir\n\nNaina Devi Mandir\n\nSantoshi Mata Mandir\n\nSuraj Kund\n\nSeeta Sar Mandir\n\nMandir mohini poriyan\n\nGeeta bhawan\n\nGurudwara Pehli Patshahi\n\nGurudwara Nanakpura sahib\n\nPeer Baba Banna Banoi\n\nSitasar\n\nIt is an ancient tank spread over 80 bighas. It is said that Sita, wife of Lord Rama, washed her hair in this tank when she was turned out of the house by Rama. Even now the widows of the surrounding area come here and wash ltheir hair. It is also said that at one time kumb fair of the Punjab was held here. The tank is, now, not in good condition. Shiv Mandirs have been built in the south west and north of the tank. A small Shitla Mata Mandir has also been built in the south of the tank in which an ancient idol of Mata has been installed. This tank, it is said, was filled with the water of River Saraswati. In The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient And Mediaeval India 1927) The Mubarak Shahi gives us some idea of Firuz Shah's canal digging activity during this period. The river Sarsati (Saraswati) comes from the great mountains and falls into the Sutlej. An earthen hillock near a place called Barwar, Firuz was informed, separated the River Saraswati from the Salima canal (of Firuz Shah). If this hillock was dug up, the water of the Saraswati would flow into the canal which could then be taken to Sahrind or Sirhind, Mansurpura and further on to Sunam. Firuz went to the place and began digging up the hillock.\n\nGurudwaras\n\nThere are number of Gurudwaras in Sunam. The most well known is the Gurdwara of the first Guruji Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Gurudwara Pehli Patshahi well known as Wadda Gurudwara where Guruji stayed for a night. Gurudwara Sri Patshahi Pehli - Sunam\n\nSunam (SO`P`N, 75\"48`E), an ancient town in Sangrur district of the Punjab, was visited by Guru Nanak during his travels through the Malva region. According to local tradition, he first stayed on the bank of the Sirhind stream, near what is now called Sita Sar. From there a devotee took him to his own house where a shrine was later established. It is located in the Gurdwara Mohalla and is known as Gurdwara Pahili Patshahi. The building constructed in 1919 was renovated in 1966. It consists of a rectangular hall, with a gallery at one end and a verandah in front. The sanctum in the centre of the hall is richly painted in multicoloured floral and geometrical designs. Three volumes of the Guru Granth Sahib are seated in it behind pipalleaf archways. There is a domed tower in front of the verandah. Rooms for the granthiand Guru ka Langar are across a narrow brickpaved courtyard. The Gurdwara is managed by a committee representing the sangat of the locality. Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji Sahib Ji visited this place on call of one old Mata ji. Kar Sewa of Gurdwara Sahib was started in year 1987 by Baba Jagtar Singh ji Kar Sewa Tarn Taran wale and was completed in year 1994 with cooperation of Jathedars and sangat\n\nBefore Partition of Punjab Sunam's population was predominantly Muslim, legend has it that if there would have been 1 more peer it would have been the first 'Peergah' (Makka) in the region with 100 peers but that did not happen as 1 peer lies just outside the boundary of the city and now Muslim Community constitutes about 15 families in Sunam. Peer Banna Banoi is an Islamic shrine in Sunam. People of all faiths pay homage as Peer Banna Banoi was a God fearing and a true Muslim who sacrificed his life on the day of his marriage to save the Hindu and Sikh girls from being kidnapped by the armed goons.\n\nEducation\n\nSunam has two colleges, the Guru Nanak Dev Dental College Sunam, and Shaheed Udham Singh Govt College Sunam.[5]\n\nHindu Sabha High School\n\nThis is one of three oldest public high schools of Sunam.
