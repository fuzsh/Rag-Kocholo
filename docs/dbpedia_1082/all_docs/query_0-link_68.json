One such hero was Shaheed Sardar Udham Singh .\n\nBorn on 26 December,1899 in Shahpur Kalan village in Sunam Tehsil in Sangrur district of Punjab. Udham Singh's father was a watchman on a railway crossing in the village of Upalli.\n\nAfter 1907, he lived his childhood in Central Khalsa orphanage Putlighar in Amritsar because of the untimely death of as his mother and father.\n\nSingh was trained in various arts and crafts there. He passed his matriculation examination in 1918 and left the orphanage in 1919.\n\nHe reached Africa in 1920, moving to Nairobi in 1921. Singh tried for a passage to the United States but was unsuccessful.\n\nHe returned to India in 1924, reaching the U.S. that same year. There, Singh became actively involved with members of the Gadar Party, an Indian group known for its revolutionary politics and its founder, Sohan Singh Bhakna.
