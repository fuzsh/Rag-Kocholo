        "text": "History of Shaheed Udham Singh\n\nIn 1931, Sardar Udham Singh took revenge for the Jallianwla bagh massacre by shooting the british officer Micheal O’Dwyer, who was the Governor General of Punjab, in London. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place on 13th April,1931 in Amritsar, Punjab.\n\nOn that day of Baisakhi, a contingent of the British Army, on the orders of Brigadier General Brigadier General REH Dyer, fired indiscriminately on the protesters who were peacefully protesting against the Rowlatt Act. More than 1000 unarmed women, men and children were killed in his massacre. More than 1200 people were injured. To save their lives, hundreds of women, elderly people and children jumped into a well built there, due to which they died.\n\nAlso Check Other Holiday in July 2024\n\nRatha Yatra\n\nMHIP Day 2024\n\nGuru Hargobind Sahib Ji Jayanti\n\nBhanu Jayanti\n\nMuharram\n\nMartyr's Day Kashmir\n\nGeneral Dyer had carried out his barbaric firing on the orders of the then Governor of Punjab, General Michael O’Dwyer. 21 years after this massacre, on 13th March 1940, Sardar Udham Singh went to Caxton Hall in London and shot Michael O’Dwyer. At that time he was going to take his seat after giving a speech at a meeting of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society. Dyer died within a few minutes.\n\nUdham Singh had taken a revolver hidden in a book to shoot Dyer. After the incident, Udham Singh was arrested and prosecuted. Udham Singh was hanged on 31st July,1940.\n\nIn conclusion, Shaheed Udham Singh’s legacy transcends boundaries of time and geography, standing tall as a beacon of hope and defiance. His life serves as a reminder that the struggle for justice and freedom is a continuous journey, one that demands unwavering determination, courage and sacrifice."
