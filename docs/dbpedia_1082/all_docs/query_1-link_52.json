        "text": "Women Welfare Club (WWC)\n\nIt is said that being a woman is the most sensitive and delicate form of human being. In a way, woman is considered to be sensitive, soft, kind, polite, concerned, patient, compassionate, self-effacing and having more understanding towards aesthetics. Today women do not shy away from speaking their minds and are also known as wonderful communicators, negotiators and politicians. Women have the ability to make better deals and personal connections with people due to their influential personality and unmatched art of oratory. Keeping this issue in mind, the Women Welfare Cell of the college has been working for the last many years. The most important objective of this cell is to protect the self-respect and rights of female students; To empower them to participate in all college activities and make them feel that they are no longer inferior to men. In this way this club is a blessing for young girls. This club helps young girl students to become active, smart and confident.\n\nClub's functions\n\nTo create social awareness towards women's problems.\n\nTo encourage participation in educational, cultural and other activities.\n\nTo review the safety and security measures for women in the college campus.\n\nTo organize various training programs to create awareness on health, hygiene and women empowerment.\n\nOrganizing programs related to gender equity.\n\nMembers of Club"
