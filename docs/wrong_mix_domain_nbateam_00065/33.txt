Jason "The Jet" Terry could become the new head coach of the Utah Jazz after getting interviewed for the vacancy on Saturday, according to Tony Jones of The Athletic.

Terry, 44, is a former Dallas Mavericks guard who was part of their 2011 NBA Championship run. He is currently the head coach for the Grand Rapids Gold of the NBA G-League -- a Denver Nuggets affiliate team.

"The Utah Jazz interviewed Jason Terry today for their vacant head coaching job, League Sources tell The Athletic," wrote Jones on Twitter. "Internal candidates Alex Jensen and Lamar Skeeter interviewed for the position this week. The Jazz are continuing with their first round of interviews."

Jason Terry is ready for the NBA

Terry is also under consideration for multiple assistant coach positions with several other NBA teams, according to reports from The Athletic's Shams Charania. The former Arizona Wildcats guard and assistant coach has long been open about his goal of one day coaching in the NBA.

"I definitely am equipped to be the head coach of an NBA franchise, a Division I college program, at this particular time because of my experience, my ability to connect with the players, and then my ability to motivate, mentor and teach at the highest level," Terry said.

Jason Terry played 19 seasons in the NBA

If Terry doesn't replace Quin Snyder as the head coach of the Jazz, he could join Jason Kidd on the coaching staff of the Mavericks, where the two played together alongside Dirk Nowitzki. Terry spent nearly a decade at Dallas before playing on four different teams in the final six years of his career.
