        "text": "Jason Terry has sneakily been making NBA franchises pay for his vacations across the United States under the guise of still being an actual NBA player ever since leaving the Mavericks in 2012. The latest team the 38-year-old has tricked into a contract is the Bucks, but he apparently really wanted it to be the Lakers.\n\nI called my good friend Luke. I told him if he needed any help, veteran leadership, in that capacity – Lakers – with an ability to coach at the end of my deal, then that was something I would be looking forward to. He utterly declined, and I respect him for that\n\nThat’s what JET said on SiriusXM NBA radio, with a tip of the cap to Pro Basketball Talk for finding and transcribing the audio.\n\nMan, that’s weird. The Lakers have signed all sorts of players this offseason, even giving Timofey Mozgov $60 million. I feel like there must be a valid reason that the Lakers would not want to sign Terry, but I can’t quite think of what it might be.\n\nIs it because ... hm.\n\nI’m really trying to think here.\n\nThere has to be something.\n\nLike, I dunno. Maybe he said something mean about the Lakers?\n\nOr ...\n\nOH!\n\nIt’s because of that one time.\n\nI think I got it.\n\nIt had to do with, like, facing them in the playoffs, and something about Game Fo—\n\nOH YEAH THIS IS DEFINITELY IT OH MAN I’M LAUGHING VERY HARD AGAIN\n\nTHIS MAN TIED AN NBA PLAYOFF RECORD AGAINST THE TWO-TIME DEFENDING CHAMPIONS TO COMPLETE A FOUR-GAME SWEEP IN A 40-POINT BLOWOUT AHAHAHA [catches breath] hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhaahahahaaahhahaha\n\nhahahahahahahaha\n\nhahahahah\n\nha\n\na\n\nhahahahahahahhahahahahhaha\n\nalso Peja totally went six-of-six on threes this game too\n\nI’m now imagining Terry sending a resume to the Lakers, and under “special skills,” it’s just a link to this video."
