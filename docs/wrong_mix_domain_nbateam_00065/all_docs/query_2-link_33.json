        "text": "After 19 NBA seasons, former Wildcats standout Jason Terry is transitioning to a new role in the Texas Legends’ front office. Last Tuesday, the Mavericks’ G League affiliate announced that Terry had been hired as the franchise’s assistant general manager.\n\nThis week I spoke with Terry, who turned 42 this month, about this new phase in his life. We also reflected on his playing career in the NBA and at Arizona, and he was eager to share some of his favorite memories with The Athletic.\n\nThe conversation has been edited for both length and clarity.\n\nWhat has “The Jet ” been up to these days?\n\nSince I retired, I’ve just been working on my post-playing career. Doing some broadcasting for Turner, Players Only, and then … I just accepted a position as assistant general manager with the Texas Legends. A career in management or coaching is something I aspire to do — NBA coaching or college. Obviously (working) in the front office in the NBA is something that interests me. I’m a basketball lifer. I’ll be a part of the game in some way, shape or form.\n\nHow did this opportunity with the Texas Legends come about?\n\nWell, I’ve always kept a great relationship with Mark Cuban and Donnie Nelson since I left the Mavericks in 2012. They’ve always told me when I finished playing, they’d have a position for me in whatever capacity that I wanted with the organization. Again, just trying to continue to learn more about the business side of basketball while still having my hands on the development of players, coaching, this position allows me to do so.\n\nHas the transition to the business side of basketball been easier than you thought? More difficult?\n\nI think it’s been a smooth transition — let’s put it at that. Every day is a day to learn. For example, I’ll be attending a city council meeting today. They are voting on if they’re going to name a street after the great Dirk Nowitzki, so I’ll be a representative for the Mavericks at that meeting. That part of it is always easy for me — showing up, shaking hands, kissing babies, striking deals. But as far as the day-to-day… the other day we had a Legends tryout with over 200 invitees, evaluating talent and giving my opinion on personnel has been seamlessly easy for me. It’s something I’ve always grown accustomed to. So, the transition has been smooth.\n\nIt’s the Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis era in Dallas now. What are your thoughts on the current makeup of the Mavericks roster?\n\nI definitely like the direction that the Mavs are headed in. They have two stars, very similar to what they had with Dirk and Steve. Nash. They’re young and a part of the Mavericks, and they (will) grow into stars overnight. Luka Doncic, obviously what he accomplished last year as a rookie, leading that team not to the playoffs, but to contention. To being competitive. Then adding a healthy Kristaps Porzingis to the roster has definitely given them two superstars. If you look at the landscape of the NBA now that Golden State has broken up their dynasty, each team now seems to have at least two superstars. I think you could pencil in Dallas as one of those teams.\n\nYou played eight of your 19 NBA seasons in Dallas. It’s where you won your first NBA championship. Just how important is that city to you?\n\nIt’s definitely very important to me. What we accomplished here in Dallas during my tenure was something I’ll never put into words, but it meant a lot to me. The city has been here for me. It’s definitely a second home. I’ve been here since 2004, raised my family here, all my daughters went to school and grew up and graduated high school from Dallas. This is home. When you win a championship in a city that’s never won one before, you’ve carved out your special place in the hearts of all the fans.\n\nGot any exclusive locker room stories from your time in the league that you’re willing to share?\n\nI’ll just never forget coming in that locker room in 2005-06 with tears all over my face and utter disappointment after losing to the Miami Heat. And then getting on that plane in 2011 after winning the championship, and just the feeling of sweet vindication and just knowing what that meant to the city and all parties that were Mavs fans, it was just a tremendous feeling and a tremendous time in my career.\n\nI imagine that Tucson, Arizona, also holds a special place in your heart. When you look back at your career with the Wildcats, what were some of your favorite moments?\n\nThere were so many great moments. I think the first moment, for me, before I became a Wildcat I was on my visit and I spent the night at Damon Stoudamire’s house. I slept on his couch and I watched The Road To The Final Four that they had in 1984 and I just remember having a feeling in my mind that I wanted to feel what they felt. I wanted to go to the Final Four. I wanted to put that jersey on and be a Wildcat because of the tradition. My second memory was going to the Sweet 16 my freshman year and losing to Kansas. The feeling that we felt in that locker room, seeing the seniors that aspired to win a championship that didn’t get that opportunity. And then the next year in 1997, going to the championship, knocking off three No. 1 seeds and win it. Holding up that trophy not only for my teammates, but for the Wildcats that came before me — Steve Kerr, Sean Elliott, Kenny Lofton — all the former Wildcats that didn’t get a chance to win a championship, that was special. And then 1999, having a senior year run that I had personally with a young team and winning National Player of the Year, becoming an All-American, being drafted in the lottery that year, as well, was just a lasting memory. And one more: just the parade, just coming home after winning a championship in 1997 and the parade of people from the airport all the way to (campus) was just unreal and is still one of the greatest moments of my athletic career.\n\nWe know how the 1997 season ended for your Wildcats, but kind of take me through that year. What were some of the ups and downs you guys experienced, and what was the point when you guys realized you were a championship-caliber team?\n\nWe were a self-confident team. Obviously, Mike Bibby was a freshman, high expectations for him, McDonald’s All-American. Miles Simon and Michael Dickerson were juniors. They had a lot of hype around themselves. Then myself and A. J. Bramlett were the lone sophomores. Starting out early, we faced a lot of adversity because Miles Simon was ruled academically ineligible, so that thrusted me into the starting lineup. Now, we didn’t know we would perform well without him because he was our leader, but we did. We had some success early and then when he came back from the suspension, there was an instance where Coach (Lute) Olson brought me in his office and said, “Look, somebody’s going to have to sacrifice and come off the bench.” I kind of took upon that role myself just knowing what it would mean for Miles to come back his junior season and to be a starter and what that meant to him. I made that sacrifice, we got off to a shaky start in Pac-10 play, but as we turned it around. We knew in our hearts, though our record didn’t say so, that we had a team that was tough to beat. We were very athletic at multiple positions. We could score. We played defense, and that alone would help us win games come tournament time. And as you know, we had a historic run. Obviously being coached by Lute, Lute had been there before, leaning on his experience. All the talks he had with us about seizing the moment, “Nobody remembers who finished second.” All those types of conversations are what helped us along our journey to winning it all.\n\nYou mentioned that you gave up your starting spot to Miles Simon because you knew what it meant to him. Is that where your mentality as a super sixth man was born?\n\nOne hundred percent. That was the time when the sixth man was born. And for me, I’d been a starter since high school. I obviously didn’t start my freshman year, I was kind of the sixth man for the Wildcats. But sophomore year is really when that role took on a life of its own. I relished that. I always thought it was something special to have starter-type ability, but to own a different role and have that be your role and star in your role, it just meant a lot to the team and I understood that. Not a lot of guys do, but I did. I think it was just a time in my career where I was just happy to be a part of the team. I didn’t lose anything by being the sixth man because I always finished the game, and Lute would always talk about it. He’d say, “It’s not about who starts, it’s about who finishes,” and nine times out of 10 I was on the floor at the end of the game.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Lute Olson story?\n\nMy favorite story would probably have to be after we won the championship. He has this kind of has this aura about himself where he has the slick white hair that was perfectly placed. We always had a running joke in the locker room. A good friend of mine Bennett Davison,\n\nwho played with us and won the championship with us, said, “Man, what I would do to one day to just ruffle his hair and mess it up.” We’re like, “Nah, man. I wouldn’t do that. You never touch Lute, let alone touch his hair.” So he was like, “Nah I’m telling you. If we win it, it’s the first thing I’m going to do.” And it plays on all the videos, the “One Shining Moment.” Right after the game, Bennett doesn’t go to any of his teammates, doesn’t go to his parents or anything. He runs right up to Lute and he just messed his hair up. Hair was all over the place for about 10 seconds. That’s how long it took, 10 seconds, and then that hair was right back perfectly placed on his head. Not a single hair out of place. We were all dying laughing — it was hilarious.\n\nWho were your closest teammates during your time at Arizona?\n\nNo doubt about it, A.J. Bramlett and I were attached at the hip — we still remain in contact. Mike Bibby, Miles Simon, Michael Dickerson, also. But, I will tell you two football players that I roomed with that are still close with me now: Kelvin Eafon and Ortege Jenkins. It was truly a family, and I’m talking about all athletics. I have as many football alum friends as I do basketball alum friends. Kelvin Eafon and Ortege Jenkins are lifetime friends of mine. Funny story for me was, I actually thought I was on the football team. I mean, every Saturday when they suited up, I’d throw on my Wildcats pants that I stole from the equipment manager, my Wildcats football jersey and then my football helmet. And I would sit there and watch the game in my room if they were on the road. If they were at home, I’d be at the game. I’d put that uniform on and act as if I were out there. And then another story, one spring, I actually got to go out and run routes with Dennis Northcutt and Ortege Jenkins threw the ball to me. That was pretty fun.\n\nYou’re no stranger to trash talk. Who are the biggest trash talkers you played against at the college and pro levels?\n\nAt the college level, Baron Davis, one of my rivals, was a big trash talker. Eddie House, another one who was our rival at Arizona State, would probably be the other trash talker. In the NBA, my mentor, Gary Payton, was the biggest trash talker. And then I would say Kevin Garnett and Stephen Jackson. And a story about Stephen Jackson, he was actually supposed to be on our 1998 Wildcats team, but he didn’t qualify. But he was on the trip, he was all signed up, he was committed and that would’ve been, aw man. We already had a good team, but had he come in 1998 we would’ve really been something special.\n\nAll right, give me your all-time Arizona basketball starting five.\n\nYou have to start with the G.O.A.T, Sean Elliott. I’d put myself in the backcourt with Mike Bibby. We’re going to be a small backcourt, but we’re going to compete. You have to put Damon Stoudamire in there. My sixth man would be Steve Kerr because I love shooting. Then if I had to put a big man in the middle, I would have to go with Deandre Ayton. Ayton was a beast. Now, you can’t just give five. You have to fill out the team because there were so many great Wildcats that have come through this program — Andre Iguodala, Gilbert Arenas, Richard Jefferson — I mean the names go on and on. All of those guys have a special place in my heart. Those would’ve been the five guys with me, plus the sixth man Steve Kerr.\n\nJust for the sake of argument, among those five guys, who’s winning a game of king of the hill?\n\nOh, I’m winning king of the hill, no doubt about it. Sean Elliott is going to fight me to death over that one. But I’ll tell you right now, it’s just something about me in that building, special things seem to happen when the ball is in my hands. When the game is on the line, I’m taking me over anyone else.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current state of the Arizona basketball program?\n\nI love where we’re at right now from a players perspective because the program is about the players. It always has been, and it always will be. I think Sean Miller has done an outstanding job of making sure we have top recruiting classes coming in and out. He’s doing a great job developing players, and you’ve seen we’ve put out some great pros from his teams. Now you look at the classes coming in — Nico Mannion, Josh Green — these guys are potential NBA players. I don’t really like the one-and-done rule because I like tradition, I like guys to be there three or four years. But there’s something to be said about bringing in a top-five recruiting class and I think we’re going to have a special season this year.\n\n(Top photo: Todd Warshaw / Allsport)"
