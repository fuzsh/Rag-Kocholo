        "text": "The 1996-1997 season was a magical one for Arizona basketball. Despite finishing just 5th in the Pac-10, and 25-9 overall, the team went on arguably the greatest postseason season run in college basketball history. That Arizona team was the only team to ever beat THREE number one seeds in the NCAA tournament in the same year when they ousted Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky.\n\nWith the way that season started, you never would've guessed that it was going to end that way, however. Star player Miles Simon, who was a junior at the time, was ruled academically ineligible for the fall semester. With Ben Davis graduating the year prior, Simon was the returning leading scorer for Arizona. It was expected that Simon and highly-touted incoming freshman Mike Bibby were going to make up one of the most dynamic backcourts in the nation. Obviously that all changed when Simon was now going to be forced to miss the first 11 games of the season.\n\nThe question now was: who was going to fill the void created by Simon's absence? Lute Olson turned to the sophomore, Jason Terry.\n\nBefore the season began though, Terry wasn't an obvious candidate to take on such a large role. In his freshman season, Terry played just under 10 minutes per game, and scored just 3.1 points per game. Was he really ready to fill in for Miles Simon? Initially it didn't look like it. In the first game of the '96-'97 season, the Cats would face the then No. 7 North Carolina Tar Heels, a team that featured Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter. Terry struggled mightily. He played 39 minutes, and went just 2-11 from the field. Despite Terry's shooting deficiencies, Arizona stunned the Tar Heels, and won 83-72. Mike Bibby and Michael Dickerson combined for 53 points.\n\nEight days later, Terry struggled again. This time against No. 19 New Mexico. In 32 minutes, Terry scored just 6 points while going a dismal 3-11 from the field as the Wildcats lost 84-77. Terry looked overwhelmed in the starting role.\n\nOr so we thought. The very next game, Arizona squared off against the Utah Utes, who were ranked third at the time. Terry had a breakout game as the Cats were able to pull off the upset. Jason scored 19 points on 7-10 shooting, while grabbing 4 rebounds, and dishing out 3 assists as well. It proved to be a turning point of his season. In the next 5 games, Terry averaged 15.6 points per game including two more 19 point performances.\n\nThe fall semester ended, and Miles Simon returned on January 11th for a game against Arizona State in Tempe. However, because the Cats started off the Pac-10 season with two tough wins over Cal and Stanford before Simon's return, Olson elected to leave Terry in the starting lineup and have Simon come off the bench. Before Simon's return, Terry averaged 12.8 points per game.\n\nTerry took advantage of his time as a starter. In an early February game against Washington in Seattle, Terry had one of the best games of his career. He must have been looking to put on a show for his hometown as he scored a season-high (which was also a career-high at the time) 23 points on 10-14 shooting and also grabbed 4 rebounds and had 5 assists. Unfortunately, Miles Simon and Michael Dickerson shot a combined 11-35 from the field and the No. 10 Wildcats lost 92-88.\n\nOddly enough, this was Terry's second-to-last game as a starter as Lute Olson decided to go with Miles Simon with the NCAA Tournament drawing near.\n\nTerry became the sixth man, and in that role, he averaged just under 9 points per game in the regular season, which included two 17 point outbursts against Stanford and USC. While Terry was still productive, and was arguably the best sixth man in the country, the team was fading a bit.\n\nIn the 9 games after this switch, Arizona went just 5-4, including being on the wrong end of a sweep in the Bay Area to close out the regular season. Despite being ranked as high as sixth earlier in the year, the Wildcats finished as the No. 15 team. It appeared that Arizona might have peaked too early.\n\nWas the lineup change the right move? Did it mess up Arizona's chemistry?\n\nAs the NCAA tournament began, Arizona earned a 4 seed and were scheduled to play South Alabama in the first round. This game was a little too close for comfort though. The Wildcats were trailing 28-26 at halftime but fortunately were able to get their offense back on par and came back to win 65-57. Terry scored 8 points and had 5 assists in this game.\n\nNext up was the 12-seed College of Charleston, which had just upset a fifth-seeded Maryland team. This game came down to the wire too. The Cats trailed by 1 at halftime and were down by 10 at one point in the second half. Terry scored 11 points on 4-8 shooting and helped spark a second half comeback with a timely three. On a night where Bibby and Dickerson struggled, Terry's contributions probably saved the season.\n\nIn the Sweet Sixteen, Arizona was forced to face a loaded Kansas team that included Paul Pierce and Raef LaFrentz. Terry didn't have a great game as he scored just 5 points in this one. Thankfully, Simon, Bibby, and Dickerson carried the load and combined for 58 points as Arizona beat the Jayhawks 85-82.\n\nIt would appear that things were going to get a little easier when Arizona faced 10-seed Providence in the Elite Eight. This game was a dogfight too. Michael Dickerson fouled out, and Terry was desperately needed to provide his usual scoring off the bench. Terry delivered as he had 11 points, and 5 assists as the Wildcats would win in overtime and advance to the Final Four.\n\nWhen Arizona arrived in Indianapolis, another number one seed awaited them as they were scheduled for a rematch with North Carolina. History repeated itself here as Terry struggled, but the Wildcats still managed to beat the Tar Heels. This was Terry's worst game in the NCAA tournament, as he went 1-6 from the field and had 3 turnovers in just 20 minutes on the floor. Nonetheless, Arizona was moving on and they were to face Kentucky in the National Championship game.\n\nKentucky would represent the third number one seed that Arizona would have to face. This game would go to overtime, and in the overtime period, Terry sank two clutch free throws to put Arizona up 79-74 with two minutes left in the game. The Cats would never look back as they held on to win the program's only National Championship, and as mentioned earlier, they became (and still are) the only team to beat three number one seeds in one year. Terry finished this game with 8 points, 5 assists, and 3 steals.\n\nWhile Simon, Bibby, and Dickerson were Arizona's three best players that year, Jason Terry's role certainly can't be understated. He gave the Wildcats a scoring punch off the bench, he could run and facilitate the offense, and was a tenacious and opportunistic defender. Equally important, when he was demoted to the bench, he didn't gripe, he didn't complain. Instead he took advantage of the opportunity. Lute Olson had high praise for Terry and his willingness to put the team first. Olson said, \"We’ve had a lot of great team players, but I don’t think there’s anybody that can be characterized as a greater team player than Jason was.\"\n\nWithout Terry's ability and unselfishness, Arizona would still be without a National Championship. He finished the 1996-1997 season averaging 10.6 points per game (on 44.3% shooting), 4.4 assists per game, and 2.5 steals per game. This was just Terry's second year of a storied four-year career at Arizona, and although he'd do great things in his final two years, such as being a consensus All-American and National Player of the Year in 1999, he'd likely be the first one to tell you that this National Championship year meant the most.\n\nThanks for the memories, Jason."
