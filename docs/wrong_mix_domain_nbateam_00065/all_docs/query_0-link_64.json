        "text": "Tonight the Utah Jazz will attempt to avenge an early season heart-breaking loss to the Dallas Mavericks. I’m not going to write much here because I have a bad head ache. So yeah, not tonight, honey . . .\n\n.\n\nSight Reading:\n\nThere is a lot of D in Dallas – they flat out shut down teams. They are big on steals and causing turn overs. Our side? We’re a little light on defense, but have a Top 10 offense right now. We try to not turn it over ever. Furthermore, we do play some defense by blocking shots. Ultimately, this is going to be a rebounding issue. We’re Tops in keeping the other team off the glass; and they are 5th best in getting rebounds.\n\n.\n\nMuch more info after the jump!\n\nRecapitulation:\n\nWe hosted these guys a week ago in our gym, and lost Mavs 94 – Jazz 91; and it was a game where the fans all over the world left bad about losing, but felt good about our team. Earl Watson was sticking up for the young guys, there were techs, there were dunks, and there was Derrick Favors getting tossed for being young. We hope to have the same time of fire in this game from our team. I hope hope hope hope we do bring it to Dallas. We have to see them 2 more times after this game, and I’d like to go back with a chance to still win the season series.\n\n.\n\nThe Beats and the Rests:\n\nDirk is out, Odom may start (I guess, I don’t know – I haven’t really done any scouting for this game). Big Al may not play either. Harris is actually playing better than Kidd right now. I’m amazed.\n\n.\n\nSoloists:\n\nSadly, the soloists this time around are going to be their bench against ours – mainly Lamar Odom and Jason Terry vs. C.J. Miles and Josh Howard. If we win that match-up, we will probably win the game.\n\n.\n\nThe Remix:\n\nWe fought hard last time, and some calls didn’t go in our favor, and we lost. The remix this time around is to play with passion and finish with a win. There is no other outcome we demand.\n\n.\n\nLiner Notes:\n\nDirk Nowitzki is out\n\nVince Carter is a GTD\n\nDelonte West is a GTD\n\nAl Jefferson is a GTD <-- IS A GO FOR TONIGHT\n\nRaja Bell is a GTD\n\nJamaal Tinsley is out, again, with dermatitis\n\n.\n\nMusic Reviews / Opponent Blogs"
