        "text": "Jason Terry has plenty of fond memories from eight seasons spent playing for the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nTerry will be going against his former team on Wednesday night for the first time since signing a three-year contract worth about $15.7 million in July.\n\nThe veteran guard won a NBA championsihp with the Mavericks in 2011 when Dallas defeated the Miami Heat. But Tyson Chandler and Jose Barea left via free agency and the Mavs were ousted from the playoffs in the first round in 2012.\n\n\"They've got the same team name, but it's not the same team,'' said Terry after practice on Tuesday afternoon. \"It's a totally different ball club. Dirk (Nowitzki) is not even in uniform. Shawn Marion may not be out there (due to an injury). Those are the guys I won the championship with and they're not there.''\n\nOnly four players from the title team in the 2011-12 season are still on the Dallas roster."
