        "text": "Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Terry has made a fair amount of money in his solid 12-year NBA career. He’s never been an All-Star, but he ranks amongst some of the better players of his generation to have never made an All-Star team, he more than earned that 2009 Sixth Man of the Year award, and he’s been an integral member of both an NCAA (2007) and NBA (2011) championship teams. He’s also, to this guy at least, one of the more entertaining players in the NBA both on and off the court. And now, even though the paychecks might not be rolling in anytime soon due to the NBA lockout, he’s ready to party as his 34th birthday lines up on September 15th. With Jamie Foxx, L’il Kim, you name it. Various rappers and the declaration that you’re supposed to wear “All blue errythang?” You got it. Want to see the poster? It’s rather large, so click the jump.\n\nDressed in a black t-shirt, gold chain, sunglasses and a Mavericks hat cocked a bit to the side, Terry plays hype man during the filming of a video for a track by rapper Young Jeezy. The song, titled “Win”, has an easy-to-remember chorus: “Win. Win win. Win Win. Win. Win win.” Yes, repeating the same is easier than finding a rhyming word and it still produces most of the desired auditory effect. Anyway, in the video, a pool game breaks out and the camera gets trained on Terry, who apparently is not a shark and recently lost a friendly wager. “Lose. Lose, lose,” Terry says, mimicking the song’s chorus. “I feel like LeBron and them right there.” Laughter erupts from the background, as it should.\n\nTerry has seen other players opt for deals overseas and said he understands that each player has to do what he feels is best for him financially. But Terry isn’t going anywhere. “I’m not even looking,” Terry said. “My season next year’s going to be with the Mavericks. All the money in the world couldn’t amount to being a champion and being able to defend that title next year.”\n\nThe website for AMS Pictures recently published a story announcing the idea of a Terry-based reality show called “Homecourt Advantage.” A statement on the site stated: “Set in the glitzy world of NBA basketball star Jason Terry, this is a comical, never before-seen look at his off-court life with high school sweetheart wife, four young daughters, crazy mom and pimp dad.” Two months ago, it was reported that when the NBA Finals concluded, Shawn Marion would be working on a similar show called “The Ladies in My Life.” “It’s just me, predicated about my life, about my mother, my sisters and me being single,” Marion said in May. “And how I help single mothers. My foundation is for single mothers. It’s a little bit of everybody.”"
