        "text": "Jason’s NBA journey began when he was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in 1999. What started as a simple selection led to a trophy-laden career, with the legend even lifting an NBA Championship title with Dallas Mavericks in 2011. Other teams he played for include the Houston Rockets, Brooklyn Nets, Boston Celtics, and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nSince he was drafted in 1999, Jason has won numerous awards throughout his playing career, both at the team level and as an individual. In addition to the accolades already mentioned, he was the Pac-10 Player of the Year in 1999, the same year he was selected into the NBA draft. That year also saw him win the Consensus first-team All-American.\n\nBut where did it all begin? Well, Jayson started playing basketball in high school before playing at the University of Arizona. Here, he made history as the only player to achieve 200 career steals and 1,000 career points. In what looked like a befitting honor to a legend, both University of Arizona and Jason’s high school retired his No. 31 jersey.\n\nAway from basketball, Jason conducts film sessions and sit-ins in meetings with Jason Kidd’s Staff in Milwaukee. You may also see him doing studio work for ESPN and Players Only broadcasts for Turner.\n\nSee keynotes with Jason Terry"
