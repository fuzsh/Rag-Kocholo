        "text": "BOSTON — Jason “The Jet” Terry made 2,282 3-pointers across 19 seasons in the NBA.\n\nHe’s tenth on the all-time 3-pointers made list and is revered as one of the association’s deadliest shooters of his generation. In an era when 3-point snippers came at a premium, Terry’s name is synonymous with the elites, such as Ray Allen (2nd-2,973), Kyle Korver (6th-2,450), and Jamal Crawford (11th-2,221); all of whom hover in and around the top-10 list.\n\nNowadays, 3-point shooting is much easier to find compared to the way things were at the turn of the century. Back when teams enlisted role players, whose sole purpose in games was to get open and make as many threes as possible. Today, shooting is an overall team effort, and every coach on every team encourages most of their players to take them, including, Terry, who’s now an assistant under Utah Jazz’s second-year head coach Will Hardy.\n\nAfter retiring as a player in 2018, Jason transitioned to an assistant coaching position for his Arizona Wildcats alma mater. Then, spent last year coaching the champion Denver Nuggets’ G League affiliate — the Grand Rapids Gold before joining Hardy’s staff.\n\nBefore taking on his former Celtics, I got a chance to catch up with Terry, who opened up about his playing days, working for Hardy and the Jazz, how the 3-point shot has evolved in the NBA over the years, and more.\n\n(The following interview has been edited for length and clarity)"
