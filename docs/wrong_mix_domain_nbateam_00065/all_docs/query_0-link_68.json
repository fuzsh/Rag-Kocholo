Never a problems off the court, always stand up on the court. True Atlanta Hawk fans appreciate all you did for the franchise. Thank you JC!\n\nNajehDavenpoop\n\nJazz playing like Danny Ainge saw the loss column before the game and gave the order\n\nNajehDavenpoop\n\nWill Kris Dunn get a tribute video?\n\nNajehDavenpoop\n\nIf I was a Jazz fan who wanted that team to win I would be so mad about their front court rotation lmao. Markkanen-Kessler should be out there until Kessler fouls out\n\nNajehDavenpoop\n\nWait was that Jason Terry on the Jazz bench???\n\nNajehDavenpoop\n\nFor all the non-passers Utah has in their rotation it‚Äôs actually pretty impressive that Will Hardy has them outside the bottom 5 in offense\n\nNajehDavenpoop\n\nIt is mind boggling how bad the Jazz are at getting Markkanen‚Äôs big ass the ball\n\nNo-Forever-6104\n\nTrae couldn‚Äôt be at John Collins‚Äô homecoming yep they‚Äôre still beefing\n\nblingera\n\nlook at our boy ü•π\n\nahend1999\n\njc was tearing up ü•≤ understandably\n\ndatasxienxe\n\nI‚Äôm tearing up man. They traded a fan favorite for nothing. Now we show up big in #20s and will cheer loudly everytime he scores.\n\nthessalylarissa\n\nJC my beloved: forever and always.\n\nperniciouspepeparrot\n\nI hate our FO for how terribly they treated JC year after year.\n\nblocktherock\n\nJC dribble off leg out of bounds is classic JC\n\nmyhellcatgotRepod\n\nI‚Äôm already ripping a hole in my lungs from laughing so hard at these John Collins turnovers\n\nhe‚Äôs giving the fans a show alright !!!!!!!\n\nTop-Flamingo7828\n\nJC tribute vid got me tearing up\n\nMiserable-Sun7577\n\nI hope John comes back home towards the end of his career\n\nPykeTheTitan\n\nI would sell my soul to get Lauri markanennenanen\n\nmyhellcatgotRepod\n\nThe Jazz gotta be doing this on purpose they can‚Äôt be this ass and careless with the ball\n\nDripGodAirborne\n\nWhere‚Äôs Kris Dunn‚Äôs tribute video\n\nahend1999\n\nwalker kessler looks like the high school bully in a netflix movie\n\ngivemesome1ce1\n\nGod bless will Hardy‚Äôs decision to start Collins at five because if Kessler started we would‚Äôve been tied or losing right now\n\ncblocktherock\n\n6‚Äô11‚Äù Markannen passing out of a layup over 6‚Äô5‚Äù Bogi is hilariously bad. Utah is poverty\n\ndillpickles007\n\nKessler is a fking menace\n\ncblocktherock\n\nHow is Kessler not a starter? He‚Äôs one of the best bigs in the league lol. Utah coach is a dumbass\n\nThe_Truth_Hurts_Yu\n\nBecause Jazz won 15 out of 20 starting JC at Center and turned their season around. But then sold off the pieces at trade deadline\n\nmyhellcatgotRepod\n\nWalker Kessler is fouling his ass off but because he‚Äôs white refs letting it go thats the only explanation possible for how he‚Äôs getting away with it\n\ncblocktherock\n\nMost white privilege game I‚Äôve ever seen\n\nArthurSmithNepoBaby\n\nWalker Kessler looks like the best friend of a girl that goes missing in a young adult novel where everyone in the small town she lives in has a secret\n\nThe_Truth_Hurts_Yu\n\nJazz won like 15 out of 20 at one point this season starting Dunn at Pg. Then they decide to sell at trade deadline and bench Dunn. They‚Äôve been ass since then and apparently all the gaurds on this team forget Lauri is the best player.\n\nArthurSmithNepoBaby\n\nThe Utah Jazz the type of team to miss two free throws on purpose so fans can get homophobic chicken sandwiches\n\nThe_Truth_Hurts_Yu\n\nWhy does Lauri want to be on this team???????\n\nmyhellcatgot\n\nI‚Äôm having the time of my life watching this John Collins disasterclass\n\nDripGodAirborne\n\nCapela just sonned JC üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nahend1999\n\nGETTING SONNED BY CLINT CAPELA IN 2024 HAVE SHAME\n\nTreephortPhan\n\nHow do the hawks get Kessler on the team? He looks amazing\n\ndillpickles007\n\nKessler would be so perfect for us\n\nSpecialist_Office274\n\nthese jazz announcers are boring as hell\n\ndillpickles007\n\nJazz announcers are awful, such homers. Some of the worst away announcers I‚Äôve heard this year.\n\nThe_Truth_Hurts_Yu\n\nPull the starters man\n\nUfcjunkies\n\nFr. Up 20. Shut it down Quin\n\nahend1999\n\nshut em down quinith\n\nThe_Truth_Hurts_Yu\n\nLol THT. If this guy isn‚Äôt made for YMCA\n\nmyhellcatgotRepod\n\nJazz DNP‚Äôd Horton-Tucker for like 10 games in the middle of the season and made a playoff push and now they‚Äôre losing games again cause they wanna play his bald ass\n\n_TheChosenOne88_\n\nHeld em under 100..good job"
