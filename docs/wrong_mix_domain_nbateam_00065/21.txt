The Utah Jazz received permission to interview Jason Terry for the team's vacant head coaching position, sources told The Athletic's Shams Charania.

Terry is currently employed as head coach of the G League's Grand Rapids Gold, a position he's held since August 2021. Prior to taking the position with the Denver Nuggets' affiliate, Terry worked as an assistant coach at Arizona during the 2020-21 campaign and was assistant general manager of the G League's Texas Legends in 2019-20.

The 44-year-old was named Sixth Man of the Year in 2008-09 and won an NBA championship in 2011 while playing for the Dallas Mavericks. Terry also played for the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets, and Milwaukee Bucks during his 19-year career. His 1,410 career games played are the ninth-most in NBA history.

Terry is also being considered for assistant coaching vacancies within the league, Charania notes.

Utah is looking to replace longtime head coach Quin Snyder, who recently stepped down from his role with the organization after eight seasons.
