Eric made Tommy laugh all the time, and Tommy seemed to be a bit more intelligent than Eric from time to time (he corrects Eric when Eric mixes up right and left).\n\nTommy helped Eric pack his stuff and move out from his apartment. He also wanted to visit Eric's baby brother Joshua, who got very sick in the hospital. He urged Eric to adopt him, but when Eric refused after he realized he can't care for Tommy, Tommy became angry. Nonetheless, he gave Eric one last visit before he went to another family who adopted him from California."
