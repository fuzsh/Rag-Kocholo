        "text": "Photo: Marjorie Elzey\n\nThe Philadelphia Union traveled to Kansas City and faced Sporting KC in what was a fairly pedestrian game for 90-some minutes. A wild few minutes of injury time salvaged a point for the Union, as a 19th-minute goal by Sporting’s Rémi Walter was canceled out by a 95th-minute stunner from Alejandro Bedoya.\n\nA sold-out Children Mercy’s Park crowd enjoyed a warm and clear night at the start of the game, which saw the Union playing their fourth match in twelve nights. Head coach Jim Curtin fielded a vastly different lineup than in the Union’s first three matches.\n\nOliver Semmle started between the goalposts for the third straight game as Andre Blake continues to recover from a groin injury. Damion Lowe and Jack Elliott centered the back four, while Kai Wagner was given a rest as Nathan Harriel started at left back and Olivier Mbaizo at right back.\n\nJosé Martínez returned to the starting lineup to anchor the midfield diamond. Jack McGlynn returned on the left of the midfield, while Jesús Bueno slotted in at the right. Jeremey Rafanello was given his first MLS start at the tip of the diamond.\n\nQuinn Sullivan moved up front and started alongside Chris Donovan at striker. The multitude of changes were necessitated by the 120 minutes plus injury time played on Tuesday and the specter of a home match in just three days against a tough Pachuca team.\n\nSporting dominated the first half\n\nThe home side started the game by probing Philadelphia’s defense, focusing on the Union’s left flank. Semmle was called on to make his first save early, in the third minute, on a strike from Johnny Russell after he got around Lowe. A few minutes later, Semmle smothered another shot as Alan Pulido tried to find Erik Thommy in the box.\n\nThe Union had its first sustained possession in the eighth minute, but it was short-lived. The team struggled throughout the first half to find any kind of rhythm, perhaps unsurprisingly, as the shuffled line-up failed to gel.\n\nSporting continued to dominate on the ball, and the Union were correctly saved by the offside flag—though the play again showed the ease with which Sporting found holes in the Union midfield and defense.\n\nThe Union had a moment in the attacking third of Sporting when Martínez struck a hard shot from distance but went down after taking a knock to his knee on the follow-through—perhaps foreshadowing what was to follow.\n\nAnother Sporting attack down the Union’s left flank saw a cross blocked into the path of Martínez, who stumbled trying to get his boot to the ball and left it in the path of an onrushing Walter who scored from 20 yards out in the 19th minute. Martínez remained down briefly and was limping slightly as he returned to play.\n\nThe Union did not threaten much in the first half, as Rafanello struggled to connect the midfield with his forwards. Instead, Sporting looked like the team the Union normally strive to be, as the KC forwards kept the Union on their heels. On the other half of play, the Union failed to create much pressure on Sporting.\n\nAnother defensive lapse by the Union in the 45th minute saw Semmle parry a nice shot, but he left the rebound for Russell who shot wide right. Sporting created few chances in the first half, despite dominating possession. However, they had four shots on goal to the Union’s zero.\n\nDespite the poor play, the Union left the field at half only down one goal.\n\nSecond-half recovery for the Union\n\nThe second half started with three Union substitutions—Dániel Gazdag replacing Jeremy Rafanello, Kai Wagner coming in for Mbaizo, and Bedoya for Martínez. Harriel moved to right back with the introduction of Wagner, Bueno moved to the base of the diamond, and Bedoya moved into the right side of the midfield.\n\nThe Union started the second half better with a bit more pressure up front, but chances were still scarce. Bedoya was first in the book for either team as he tackled Walter from behind in the 48th minute.\n\nIt took a few minutes for the new lineup to get in sync.\n\nThe 51st minute saw McGlynn with a nice defensive takeaway, but Gazdag was shouldered off the pass and Sporting took the ball the other way. At the other end moments later in the 54th minute, Bedoya took a left-footed shot from the corner of the 18-yard box but got no power behind it and Melia made an easy save.\n\nA minute later, in the Union’s best opportunity of the game to that point, Gazdag took a pass on the half-volley and rifled a shot just wide left. The Union kept the pressure on as Sullivan crossed a nice ball that was shuffled out by a defender off a Union player for a goal kick. A minute later, Mikael Uhre came on for Donovan.\n\nLowe saw himself booked for a hard challenge on Russell in the 58th minute. The resulting free kick was headed out by Elliott for a corner, who also dealt with the resulting corner. Sporting kept the pressure on in the box but couldn’t get off a clean shot.\n\nDuring a Sporting corner minutes later, referee Rafael Bonilla missed an elbow from Andreu Fontàs into what appeared to be Bueno’s neck, who went down in the six-yard box. This resulted in a Russell header on goal, which saw Lowe clear off the line with a header of his own.\n\nThe Union tried to make some chances on the counterattack, but a pass was too far for Uhre and Melia handled it without any hassle. The Union had a rare set piece in the 72nd minute after a foul by Daniel Rosero on Uhre, but the resulting Wagner free kick was headed high and out of play by Harriel.\n\nThe Union continued to pressure Sporting and were nearly rewarded when a rushing Bedoya forced Tim Liebold to hit a clearance off his own crossbar. Going the other way, a sliding tackle by Jacob Davis resulted in the ball making its way to Russel—who dribbled to the near post only to have Semmle smother his shot.\n\nAs the game entered the final minutes, the Union grew more desperate and a cross by Uhre in the 90th minute was swatted away by Melia before Anderson could get to it. Seconds later, a Sullivan free kick found Anderson’s head who knocked it just wide of the post. The Union continued to press, and in injury time Gazdag had a penalty appeal brushed away after another Uhre cross from the left side.\n\nThe Union finally found the tying goal, but not without some controversy. A ball was played over the sideline off the foot of Uhre, though Bonilla indicated a Union throw-in. The resulting play led to a corner kick, which Melia parried away. The ball fell right in front of Bedoya who volleyed the ball into the far corner of the goal in the 95th minute.\n\nThe game continued for another two minutes, including another Sporting corner, before the final whistle. Sporting manager Peter Vermes remonstrated to the officials at midfield but to no avail.\n\nDespite a poor start and a controversial ending, the Union walked away with a point.\n\nThree Points\n\nJim Curtin vs Peter Vermes – The two longest-tenured MLS coaches faced off for the ninth time in MLS play. Curtin maintained his slight edge with three wins but Vermes will surely feel Sporting deserved a win on the night.\n\nQuinn Sullivan – Apple TV’s pre-game show rightly praised Sullivan, who has had a stellar start to the season. However, he was not great (though not bad) on the night as a striker and remains more effective as an attacking midfielder. Let’s play him there.\n\nThe left side of things – With Wagner and Glesnes getting some deserved rest, Harriel filled at left-back for the ninth time in his career. Lowe took Elliott’s normal left-back position as Elliott moved over to the right. Sporting took full advantage of this makeshift line in the first half, continuously driving down the right to attack the Union’s left flank. Sporting’s one goal came down the left flank. Is Wagner irreplaceable at left-back?\n\nLineups\n\nPhiladelphia Union (4-4-2)\n\nOliver Semmle, Jack Elliott, Damion Lowe, Nathan Harriel, Olivier Mbaizo (Kai Wagner), José Martínez (Alejandro Bedoya 46’), Jesús Bueno, Jack McGlynn (Markus Anderson 83’), Jeremy Rafanello (Dániel Gazdag 46’), Quinn Sullivan, Chris Donovan (Mikael Uhre 57’)\n\nUnused Subs: Andrew Rick, Jakob Glesnes, Matt Real, Tai Baribo\n\nSporting KC (4-3-3)\n\nTim Melia, Jacob Davis, Daniel Rosero, Andreu Fontàs, Tim Leibold, Erik Thommy (Memo Rodriguez 80’), Nemanja Radoja, Rémi Walter, Johnny Russell, Alan Pulido (William Agada 80’), Daniel Salloi (Stephen Afrifa 87’)\n\nUnused subs: John Pulskamp, Robert Voloder, Robert Castellanos, Zorhan Bassong, Felipe Hernández, Alenis Vargas\n\nScoring Summary\n\nKS – Rémi Walter 19’\n\nPHL – Alejandro Bedoya 90+5’\n\nDiscipline Summary\n\nPHL – Bedoya (Yellow Card, 48′ – Foul)\n\nPHI – Lowe (Yellow Card, 58′ – Foul)\n\nKS – Russell (Yellow Card, 93′ – Foul)"
