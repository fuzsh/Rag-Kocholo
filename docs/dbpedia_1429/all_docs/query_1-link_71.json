        "text": "The Seattle Sounders are visiting Sporting Kansas City on Saturday in their first of two meetings on the season. Here is everything you need to know:\n\nWHERE TO WATCH: The match will be available to watch on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nWHERE TO LISTEN: The match will air on 950 KJR AM and in Spanish on El Rey 1360AM.\n\nPREVIOUS MEETING: Sporting defeated the Sounders 2-1 at Lumen Field on May 7, 2023, behind two first-half goals by Erik Thommy and Alan Pulido. NicolÃ¡s Lodeiro pulled one back for Seattle from the penalty spot in the 66th minute.\n\nINTERNATIONAL DUTY: Seattle will be without the services of defenders Nouhou and Stuart Hawkins, who are away with the Cameroon and United States U-19 national teams, respectively. Cameroon is taking on Cape Verde and Angola in a pair of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, while the U.S. U-19s will play Argentina and Uruguay in a couple of friendlies in South America.\n\nMORRIS RETURNS: Sounders attacker Jordan Morris returns to Childrenâs Mercy Park where he famously scored all four Sounders goals in a 4-1 rout last March. Morrisâ output was a club record, and he was only the 16th player in MLS history to record four goals in a match.\n\nRESPECTABLE ROAD RESULTS: Despite a difficult time at Lumen Field this season, the Sounders have fared fairly well away from home. They are 3-5-1 away from Seattle.\n\nTROUBLE IN KC: Sporting Kansas City enters this weekend last in the Western Conference with the fewest wins (two) in the league. SKC is tied with the San Jose Earthquakes with the fewest Points Per Game (0.69) this season and hasnât won an MLS match since March 30.\n\nTOUGH ON BOTH ENDS: SKCâs tough start to the season has come as a result of struggles on both ends of the pitch. They own an Expected Goal Differential of -8.07, which is fourth-worst in the league."
