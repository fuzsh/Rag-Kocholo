        "text": "Leipzig's Timo Werner in action with 1.FSV Mainz 05's Moussa Niakhate during a German Bundesliga soccer match between FSV Mainz 05 and RB Leipzig in Mainz, Germany, Sunday, May 24, 2020. (Kai Pfaffenbach/pool via AP)BERLIN Leipzig seemed to enjoy playing in an empty stadium with no protesters as it routed host Mainz 5-0 to move third in the Bundesliga on Sunday. Leipzig has got used to protests from rival fans due to its support from backer Red Bull. Leipzig players have been regularly whistled at away grounds, and Union Berlin supporters even held a funeral march for soccer before their teams game in Leipzig earlier this season. Leipzig, which beat Mainz 8-0 in front of its own fans earlier this season, took advantage of Borussia Mnchengladbachs 3-1 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday as it stayed three points behind second-place Borussia Dortmund."
