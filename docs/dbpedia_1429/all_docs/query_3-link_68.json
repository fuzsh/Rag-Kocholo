        "text": "If it is, could you instead of giving your interpretation, quote each step from the new PHB (with page number)?\n\nIf you send me your copy, I can give you plenty of page numbers. Do you have a particular reason to believe that perception and search are not in the PHB?\n\nI've strung the separate rules together and that leaves a LOT of interpretation and making pretty big leaps between each rule.\n\nFor example the Hide Action talks about 'finding', that isn't a game term. Why talk about a Hide Action and then not about a Find/Detect/Search Action?\n\nBecause finding can mean different things. The Paladin Divine Sense is a magic action using their channel divinity, yet it also explicitly finds the exact location of any undead within 60 ft regardless of cover. Dwarven tremorsense does not explicitly say it \"finds hidden creatures\" but it would allow you to \"see\" and therefore find any creature that is touching the same stone surface, rendering invisibility and hiding behind a door equally pointless. It is a bonus action, and not any particular kind of action.\n\nSo, it doesn't make sense to limit \"finding\" to only a specific action type, because that will naturally exclude other ways of finding people or objects.\n\nAlso a DC 15 base for hiding means that an average human with no stealth skill has only a 30% chance of hiding, and that would mean that an average human would never detect a hidden person with a passive perception... You either need to be super human or have a very high level and have the perception skill... Or actively searching for something.\n\nThat doesn't sound like a question. Yes, that is math. Will you be needing PHB quotes with page numbers for where they break down percentage chances of passing DCs for human commoners as well?\n\nLet's just accept that the 'invisible' condition is just a status name and not the actual effect. But you get the same condition when you cast the Invisible spell... You only use different conditions for it to end...\n\nYes, that is what you should do.\n\nSure, I understand that DM rules for running monsters should be in the DMG OR the MM. Except that WotC decided to not release the DMG til 2 months later or the MM 5 months later. How the heck are you supposed to run a smooth game like that?\n\nFeel free to open a US based printing company that can handle the overwhelming volume of a WoTC core rule book trio printing. Or feel free to open a storage facility that doesn't charge WoTC for storing likely millions of books for a few months. Otherwise, complaining about the realities of their print production is a bit silly. As is somehow expecting that this will be any different than when we had the literal exact same scenario in 2014.\n\nEspecially when the 2014 PHB was quite clear in how that worked for the DM:\n\nThat is crystal clear! Where can I find that one paragraph in the 2024 PHB that explains the surprise mechanics this concise and this clear?\n\nWith the surprise rules. These are not the surprise rules being discussed.\n\nAlso, if that is the rules you want to use, then since that one paragraph doesn't specify anything about cover, if my PC is attempting to be stealthy in a brightly lit, featureless white-room, then I would roll my stealthy and get surprise against any enemies which.. well in a separate paragraph tells me that I just took away their entire turn because I was trying to be stealthy. And since those are the rules, that would be the absurdist RAW correct?\n\nSorry, didn't realize you had missed all of my earlier posts on this.\n\nIf a PC hides, then quickly moves from cover to cover on their turn, they continue to benefit from the hide action.\n\nIf a PC hides, then slips out from an empty room, behind a guard patrol, and down a different hallway, they continue to benefit from the hide action.\n\nIf a PC hides, then scrambles up to cling to the ceiling as a guard patrol rounds the corner and passes under them, they continue to benefit from the hide action.\n\nIf a PC hides, then rushes out of cover to stab a guard in the back, then they lose the benefits of the hide action after their attack.\n\nIf a PC hides, then bursts out of cover in front of a guard, makes funny faces at them, flips them the double bird, then darts down a hallway... they do not continue to have the benefits of the hide action unless they make a new stealth check.\n\nOK. Most of your interpretations seem to assume that the PC should only briefly leave the cover in order to maintain the condition. And it would be nice if rules required such, but they don't.\n\nAnd we don't need to assume intentional bad faith play from the player for weirdness and ambiguity to arise. By the rules the character could move around in a room full of people as long as they like, and remain undetected, especially if the people there had no reason to suspect anyone would be there and would not take search action. Now at what point this becomes absurd? How many people there need to be, how long must the PC move around in the room?\n\nI think clause that hidden character must end their turn in cover if they wish to remain hidden would at least significantly lessen absurdities whilst maintaining usefulness of the action."
