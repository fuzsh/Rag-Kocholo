The ball took a deflection off Santiago Moreno before Agada found it and hit a left-footed shot on his first touch into the top-right corner of the goal.\n\nSKC â Dany Rosero (Memo Rodriguez), 38th minute:Â Off a corner kick, Memo Rodriguez served a ball into the penalty kick spot, where Dany Rosero rose to finish the play with a header.\n\nSKC â William Agada (Robert Voloder), 48th minute:Â Dany Rosero took a free kick, sending the ball into the box to find Robert Voloder. Voloder, unmarked, headed the ball into the six-yard box for William Agada to finish the play with a right-footed shot into the middle of the goal.\n\nPOR â Evander (penalty kick), 64th minute:Â Kansas City conceded a foul in the box. Evander converted a goal from the penalty kick spot.\n\nPOR â Felipe Mora (JonathanÂ RodrÃ­guez), 66th minute:Â Antony dribbled down the right wing and crossed a long ball to find Jonathan RodrÃ­guez, who controlled the ball with his chest and sent it into the six-yard box. Felipe Mora tapped the ball in.\n\nPOR â Eric Miller, 81st minute:Â Cristhian Paredes rose in the box and headed the ball on target, forcing a save on Tim Melia. The ball rebounded into the six-yard box where Eric Miller pounced and finished the play with a right-footed ball into the lower-left corner of the goal.\n\nMATCHCENTER\n\nNotes\n\nThe Timbers completed their first-ever comeback result after trailing by three or more goals today.Â\n\nPortland is oneÂ of nine teams to have scored seven or more goals in the second half of the match.Â\n\nFive of those goals have come in the last 15 minutes of the second half, tied for most in the league (Chicago, Minnesota).Â\n\nPortlandÂ hasÂ scored 14Â goals through sevenÂ matches this season, tied for the most in the Western Conference andÂ secondÂ most in the league.Â\n\nThe Timbers have scored multiple goals in five out of their seven matches this season.\n\nEvander tallied his team-leading third goal today and first as a penalty kick.Â\n\nIn his third appearance of the season, Felipe Mora scored his second goal in the 66th minute.Â\n\nBoth of Moraâs goals this season have come in the second half after checking on to the field as a substitute.Â\n\nNotably, Evander and Mora logged consecutive goals in todayâs road match after scoring a goal each against Vancouver Whitecaps FC on March 27.
