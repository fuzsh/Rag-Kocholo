        "text": "PORTLAND, Oregon — Sporting Kansas City gave up a late goal and had late opportunities that they failed to capitalize on in their 2-1 loss to the Portland Timbers.\n\nThe loss has dropped Sporting KC to last in the MLS Western Conference standings with a 2-7-5 record and six points outside of a playoff spot.\n\nThe deciding goal in the 79th minute came from Portland midfielder Evander Ferreira who scored off of a header in the box although the offside flag came up during the score- to disallow the goal. VAR review overturned the flag and ruled striker Felipe Mora onside.\n\nKC Current edge Utah to keep unbeaten streak alive\n\nSKC’s best chance after the goal came in the 97th minute when a Johnny Russell header was saved by Portland goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau.\n\nMemo Rodriguez equalized for Sporting in the 63rd minute with a goal from right outside the box. After a scoreless first half, a Mora header from an Evander cross got Portland on the board in the 51st minute.\n\nMidfielder Felipe Hernández subbed in for Erik Thommy who went down with a hamstring injury. Head coach Peter Vermes said he doesn’t know the severity of the injury.\n\nLeBron James comes to Kansas City for AAU tournament\n\nSporting was outshot 11-6 with only two shots on goal and 0.28 xG despite having 57% possession.\n\nSporting goalkeeper Tim Melia reached more than 25,000 SKC minutes played across all competitions in the match and center-back Andreu Fontàs reached more than 10,000 regular season minutes played for the club.\n\nSporting comes back home to face Vancouver Whitecaps FC on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
