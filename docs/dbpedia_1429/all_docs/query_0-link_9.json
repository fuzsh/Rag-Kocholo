        "text": "UPDATE, June 24: Sporting Kansas City have signed midfielder Erik Thommy from German Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart, the club announced Thursday. The contract will run through the 2024 season with a club option for 2025.\n\nThommy, 27, will occupy an international roster spot and be available to join the team once the MLS Secondary Transfer Window begins on July 7. He will be eligible to make his debut for Sporting KC's Week 19 match at CF MontrÃ©al on July 9.\n\nâThis is a big step for me in my career,â Thommy said. âI have had very good conversations with Peter Vermes and I am excited to join MLS, a league that has developed a lot in the last few years. This club has great fans, great facilities and a great stadium. I want to give my best for the team and I am ready for the challenge.â\n\nThe versatile playmaker can line up centrally or out wide. He has 42 goals and 33 assists across his nine seasons in his native Germany, with nine goals and 14 assists in 96 appearances in the top-flight Bundesliga.\n\nThommy is SKC's second signing on the day after the announced acquisition of forward William Agada, as the club looks to bring in reinforcements during an injury-riddled start to the season.\n\nThat's according to Taylor Twellman, who claims the club will announce two signings \"over the next 48 to 72 hours\" in the form of German midfielder Erik Thommy and Nigerian striker William Agada.\n\nBoth signings come amid a disastrous 2022 for Sporting KC, who are last in the West with just 13 points in 16 games (3W-9L-4D record). That's due in part to a long list of injuries that includes Designated Players Alan Pulido and Gadi Kinda, who are both out for the year with knee ailments."
