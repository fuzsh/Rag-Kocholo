        "text": "Austin FC defeated Sporting Kansas City 3-2 on Saturday night at Q2 Stadium, thanks to two (2) goals by JÃ¡der Obrian and another by SebastiÃ¡n Driussi. The result was Austinâs fifth consecutive home victory, and the match attendance of 20,738 marked the 61st consecutive MLS home sellout for Austin FC, extending the leagueâs longest active streak.\n\nAustin FC had the ball in the net in the fifth minute but Dani Pereiraâs strike was then disallowed for an offside infraction during the buildup. Sporting Kansas City took the lead themselves in the 19th minute until Obrian equalized nine (9) minutes later, set up by Pereira after the Venezuelan international intercepted a pass from SKC goalkeeper Tim Melia. That same pair combined again in the 39th minute as Pereira once again found Obrian in space in the box, and Obrian made no mistake with the finish. Brad Stuver made a crucial save before the end of the first half to preserve Austinâs lead at halftime.\n\nAustin hit the ground running in the first minute of the second half, as Driussi guided in a header off a cross from Gyasi Zardes to establish a two-goal advantage. Sporting KC would pull a goal back with a strike from distance by Jake Davis, but the Verde & Blackâs three (3) goals proved to be enough to claim victory on the night.\n\nGoal-Scoring Summary\n\nSKC (0-1) - Johnny Russell (assisted by Alan Pulido, Memo RodrÃ­guez) 19â\n\nATX (1-1) - JÃ¡der Obrian (assisted by Dani Pereira) 28â\n\nATX (2-1) - JÃ¡der Obrian (assisted by Dani Pereira, Jhojan Valencia) 39â\n\nATX (3-1) - SebastiÃ¡n Driussi (assisted by Gyasi Zardes) 46â\n\nSKC (3-2) - Jake Davis (assisted by Erik Thommy) 63â\n\nMatch Information\n\nVenue: Q2 Stadium (Austin, Texas)\n\nAttendance: 20,738\n\nWeather: Sunny, 91 degrees\n\nReferee: Sergii Boiko\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Jason White\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Nicholas Balcer\n\nFourth Official: Sergii Demianchuk\n\nVAR: Sorin Stoica\n\nStatistical source: MLSSoccer.com\n\nNext Match\n\nAustin FC will play its seventh away match and fifteenth match overall of the 2024 Major League Soccer regular season against San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday, May 25 at 9:30 p.m. CT/7:30 p.m. CT.
