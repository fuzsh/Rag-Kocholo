        "text": "-Hi.\n\nI'm Rick Steves, back with more of the best of Europe.\n\nThis time, rather than a particular place, we're going thematic and traveling anywhere that theme takes us.\n\nThis time, it's the art of the Roman Empire.\n\nConsider this -- at its peak, the word \"Rome\" meant not the city, but what Romans considered the entire civilized world.\n\nHop on our chariot as we leave the city of Rome for the marvels of its far-flung empire.\n\nThanks for joining us.\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ -Ancient Rome lasted a thousand years, roughly 500 B.C.\n\nto 500 A.D.\n\nIt grew for 500 years, peaked for 200 years, and fell for 300 years.\n\nOver those centuries, the Romans, with their vast empire, gave Europe its first taste of a common culture and left an enduring legacy of great art.\n\nWe'll start at the peak of the empire -- the 1st and 2nd centuries when no one could stand against the emperor, a forced peace called the Pax Romana.\n\nWalking streets that still survive, and marveling at art that told its story and gives a sense of a cohesive empire made possible by great roads and infrastructure as never before seen.\n\nTouring the remains of Roman cities from Anatolia to Britannia, we'll see the art of empire.\n\nBut then, as Rome fell, the empire split and retreated east to Constantinople.\n\nRuled from there, the empire carried on, leaving sumptuous art and a cultural heritage that would provide a foundation for the rise of today's Europe.\n\nExploring the far reaches of the vast Roman Empire, we'll travel from the capital to Pompeii in the south and to Bath and Hadrian's Wall in the north.\n\nWe'll see cultural treasures from southern France to great cities in the east like Ravenna, Ephesus, and Constantinople.\n\nUnder the Pax Romana, the Romans ruled an empire stretching from the Nile all the way to Britain, and it was laced together with an extraordinary network of roads.\n\nTravelers today can find remains of the empire throughout most of Europe, and everywhere, you'll find the same features -- the same grid-planned streets, the aqueducts, Colosseum-inspired arenas... baths... ...public toilets... ...temples... ...monuments... and on pedestals far and wide, a statue of the emperor.\n\nPompeii, an early conquest of Roman, was a typical Roman city in southern Italy, with all those typical features, from forums and temples... ...to public baths and brothels.\n\nBut with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., life in Pompeii was stopped in its tracks.\n\nTragic, I know, but for archeologists, Pompeii was a shake-and-bake windfall.\n\nThe excavated art and architecture of this once-busy town offers an intimate look at the richness of ancient Roman life.\n\n♪ The main square, or forum, was Pompeii's commercial, religious, and political center.\n\nThe curia housed the government.\n\nIt was built of no-nonsense brick and mortar, originally faced with a veneer of gleaming marble.\n\nThe basilica, or law court, was nearby.\n\nThe basilica floor plan, a rectangular space divided into a central nave and side aisles by two rows of columns, was ideal for a meeting hall.\n\nRemains of homes at Pompeii give a glimpse into how the wealthy lived and enjoyed their art.\n\nThe House of Vettii, the home of a rich merchant, shows the typical layout of a mansion.\n\nIts colonnaded inner courtyard, a formal garden with water flowing to give freshness, was ringed by colorfully frescoed rooms.\n\nDining rooms were often richly decorated.\n\nHere, little cupids go about everyday life in Pompeii, harvesting crops... ...taking your knocks on a chariot... ...and enjoying the local wine.\n\nWater was abundant in this well-plumbed city.\n\nFountains provided a social center at intersections, and a steady stream of water flushed the chariot-rutted streets clean.\n\nSo, why the stones in the street here?\n\n-Well, there was always water flowing along the roads and washing the roads, so that's why the sidewalk all over and the stepping stones.\n\n-So the pedestrians walk across and not get wet.\n\n-Yes, good cross road, avoiding wet feet.\n\n-Very smart.\n\nPompeii's artifacts show off the ancient city's love of art and the good life.\n\n♪ These bronze statues, like so much of the art from Pompeii, are 1st-century B.C.\n\nRoman copies of 4th-century B.C.\n\nGreek originals.\n\nResting Hermes, with his tired little heel wings, is taking a break, but it's clear he'll be flying off again soon.\n\nThis wine-loving woodland God, or satyr, singing and snapping his fingers to the beat is clearly living for the moment, true to the Epicurean seize-the-day philosophy many Romans embraced and celebrated.\n\nPompeii's many finely-crafted mosaics reflect the sophistication and wealth of the city and its people.\n\nCulture, including music and theater, thrived at Pompeii.\n\nThis mosaic takes us backstage, just before curtain time.\n\nActors get dressed, instruments tuned, and the masks of comedy and tragedy are ready to go.\n\nThis detailed and realistic mosaic shows street musicians boisterously entertaining those not quite up to a night at the theater.\n\nVenus, the Goddess of Love, was a Pompeii favorite.\n\nStatues are intimate and impressively realistic.\n\nThe much-copied Three Graces celebrated elegance, beauty, and a love of life, a reminder of how fleeting life is, and was, on the fateful day nearly 2,000 years ago when that volcano blew.\n\nThe comforts of Roman life stretched to the far reaches of the empire, even to the cold, rainy British Isles.\n\nFor example, the Roman city of Bath was famous as a spa town.\n\nTaking full advantage of its mineral hot springs, it was like Rome away from Rome.\n\nThis pool is still lined with its original lead, nine tons of it.\n\nYou can almost imagine those Romans lounging around, sipping wine, schmoozing, just like they did far away in the city of Rome.\n\nColorful mosaics and mysterious reliefs are a reminder of the elegance and artfulness of Roman life even in distant Britannia.\n\nThe hot thermal water still bubbles past ancient bricks.\n\nEnjoy some quality time looking into the eyes of Minerva, goddess of the hot springs, then pop upstairs to enjoy a glass of the same healing waters ancient Romans choked down so long ago.\n\n-What's it taste like?\n\n-Sulfur.\n\n[ Laughter ] -The emperor's agenda was to Romanize his people, to create a populace that was thoroughly Roman.\n\nWherever they lived in the empire, people expected and got the standard features of a Roman city -- roads, running water, arenas, and theaters.\n\nAnd this was for good reason.\n\nIt was a bribe.\n\nConquered people would accept Roman rule in exchange for the infrastructure of good living.\n\nRome's legacy shines to this day in huge construction projects across its vast empire.\n\nWherever they conquered, they built.\n\nAnd that included walls to protect it all.\n\nThis once-mighty wall, built by Emperor Hadrian, stretched 70 miles across northern England, close to today's border with Scotland, to protect Britannia and mark the northernmost reach of the empire.\n\n♪ Water infrastructure was a Roman engineering forte and vital for the empire.\n\nThe Pont du Gard in southern France is just one of many ancient aqueducts surviving across Europe.\n\nThey heralded the greatness of Rome, reminding the far-flung empire subjects how fortunate they were to be on the winning team.\n\nThis perfectly preserved Roman bridge supported a canal, or aqueduct, on the very top.\n\nThe Pont du Gard was a critical link, helping keep a steady river of water flowing cross-country and across this river.\n\nRemarkably, it was engineered so that the water dropped only one inch for every 300 feet, for 30 miles, harnessing gravity to flow all the way to the city of Nîmes.\n\nThe Pont du Gard's main arch is the largest the Romans ever built.\n\nThe bridge itself has no mortar, just ingeniously stacked stones.\n\nTaking full advantage of that Roman specialty, the round arch, the structure is held in place by gravity.\n\nSimple as it may seem, the round arch was key to Roman architectural greatness.\n\nPrevious structures were limited by two vertical posts spanned by a lintel, which was structurally weak.\n\nA round arch could span a much wider gap.\n\nAnd once the central keystone is placed, the arch can support just about whatever you want to build on top of it.\n\nWithout the round arch, none of Rome's greatest structures would have been possible.\n\nArenas like this one in southern France are another fine example of Roman engineering and Roman propaganda.\n\nIn the spirit of \"give the masses bread and circuses,\" admission to arenas and theaters was free, another perk for subjects of Team Rome.\n\n♪ The ancient city of Ephesus, on the west coast of today's Turkey, was Greek before it became Roman, a good example of cultural Romanization.\n\nIts main street, once lined with fine buildings, leads past a striking temple dedicated to the Greek-loving Roman Emperor Hadrian.\n\nAnd the city's library, filled with books in both Latin and Greek, showed off the Romans' cosmopolitan flair.\n\nThis striking facade, featuring statues of women who symbolized the virtues of learning and wisdom, inspired the citizenry.\n\n♪ Like any great Roman city, Ephesus had a fine theater.\n\nWith good acoustics designed into the semicircular seating and the sound wall behind the stage, huge gatherings could enjoy plays and events here with unamplified voices.\n\nIts acoustics, remarkable back then, remain so to this day.\n\n-[ Singing operatically in native language ] ♪ ♪ [ Cheers and applause ] -To estimate an ancient city's population, archeologists consider the capacity of its theater.\n\nEphesus was big.\n\nIt needed a theater that could seat 25,000.\n\nAnd imagine, it was just one city in the vast Roman Empire.\n\nFrom Egypt and Greece to Spain and Britain, the Roman world seemed united, and it seemed the Roman Empire would last forever.\n\nBut there was just one small flaw in the plan -- people.\n\nAfter centuries of relative stability, Rome began its fall, partly because of some bad emperors.\n\nSure, some were good and some were mediocre, but many were downright evil.\n\nAs they were invested with immense, almost godlike power, with egos as supersized as their empire, they left plenty of portrait busts.\n\nThere were empire builders like Augustus, wise leaders like Hadrian, and crazy rulers like Caligula.\n\nThe last great emperor of the Pax Romana, Marcus Aurelius, sits on his horse atop Capitoline Hill in Rome.\n\nThe original, housed nearby, out of the acidic modern air, is a rare surviving equestrian statue from antiquity and a great symbol of Rome at its peak.\n\n♪ But after Marcus Aurelius, Rome was ruled by an unfortunate string of ineffective, incompetent, and now mostly forgotten emperors.\n\nThe son of Marcus, Commodus, was a cruel tyrant.\n\nHe declared himself a god, dressed up like Hercules, and clubbed innocent subjects to death.\n\nBy this time, the fall of Rome was inevitable.\n\nBut its decline was gradual, stretching across two centuries.\n\nAnd even during its fall, Rome produced some wonderful art.\n\nWith its imperial might and all the stories of persecutions and hungry lions in the Colosseum, it's easy to forget that in Rome's later years, it was both threatened by, and then energized by, an obscure new religion creeping in from the East -- Christianity.\n\nAt first, pagan Rome persecuted the Christians.\n\nThey worshiped secretly and buried their dead in underground catacombs scattered outside the walls of the city.\n\nThe tomb-lined tunnels stretch for miles and are many layers deep.\n\nSome of the early Christians buried here had been killed for their faith.\n\nAnd later Christians carved out niches nearby to be buried close to these early saints and martyrs.\n\nEven before Christians could worship openly, they communicated through art, and much of that was funerary art, as seen on these sarcophagi.\n\nThe anchor was a symbol of salvation before the cross was used.\n\nIn ancient times, Jesus was portrayed as a good shepherd, and people prayed or praised God with hands raised.\n\n♪ Christianity became increasingly popular.\n\nFinally, Emperor Constantine made a bold and perhaps pragmatic move.\n\nFollowing a vision that he would triumph in battle under the sign of the cross, Constantine legalized the upstart religion in the year 312.\n\nOnce legalized, Christianity spread all across the empire.\n\nPagan Europe soon morphed into Christian Europe.\n\nThe emperor converted, and before long, the once-obscure Jewish sect became the state religion of the entire Roman Empire.\n\n♪ In the year 300, you could be killed for being a Christian.\n\nIn the year 400, you could be killed for not being a Christian.\n\nChurch attendance boomed, and Emperor Constantine built the first great Christian church right here, San Giovanni in Laterano, St. John's.\n\nGrand churches sprang up everywhere.\n\nSan Giovanni in Laterano became the first Vatican, the original home of the bishop of Rome, or pope.\n\nToday's 17th-century Baroque church, which sits upon its ancient foundations, is filled with symbols of Christianity's triumph -- the gilded bronze columns that once adorned a pagan temple, the original doors from Rome's Senate House, and in a box above the altar, the supposed skulls of those early Christian pioneers and martyrs Peter and Paul.\n\nWith the acceptance and growth of the church, Christian art and architecture could now blossom.\n\nAs Rome was the empire's capital, it now became the capital of Christianity.\n\nIt was a magnet for pilgrims.\n\nThe Holy Stairs were a major stop.\n\nThey're supposedly from the palace of Pontius Pilate, brought to Rome by Emperor Constantine's mother.\n\nPilgrims, believing Jesus climbed these very stairs, hoped, as pilgrims still do, to be blessed if they scaled them on their knees.\n\nAnd the great art all around them inspires to this day.\n\nThe Roman Empire that had united Europe for centuries was crumbling, government was collapsing, the city of Rome had been sacked, and marauding tribes ravaged the landscape.\n\nBut in all that turmoil, one last institution was standing strong against the chaos -- the Roman church.\n\nChristianity transformed the ancient city of Rome.\n\nThe pagan Pantheon Temple was rebranded as a Christian church.\n\nStatues of senators were rechristened as saints.\n\nAn emperors' tomb became the pope's fortress.\n\nTrajan's Column would be topped with a saint, and the spot where Peter had been executed and buried would eventually be crowned by the grandest building in the city, St. Peter's Basilica.\n\n♪ By the way, many churches are called basilicas, even though that term predates Christianity.\n\nWhen their religion became legal, suddenly Christians needed a large public space in which to worship.\n\nRather than invent something new, they adopted the long-established basilica floor plan, which ancient Romans used for meeting halls.\n\nThis gave churches their standard layout, a nave lined by columns leading up to the altar, with aisles on either side.\n\nAnd they were decorated with the signature artwork of the Roman Empire -- stunning mosaics.\n\nRome's decline was gradual and fitful, but rulers still commissioned great art.\n\nIn Ravenna, this 5th-century mausoleum was intended for the sister of one of Rome's last emperors.\n\nIts precious mosaics, while dating from the fall of Rome, are considered the finest from ancient times.\n\nThe light that sneaks through the thin alabaster panels brings a glow and a twinkle to the early Christian symbolism.\n\nThe dome is filled with stars.\n\nDoves drink from fountains, symbolic of souls finding nourishment in the Word of God.\n\n♪ This 5th-century work shows the standard ancient Roman portrayal of Christ as the good shepherd.\n\nJesus, dressed in gold and purple like a Roman emperor, is the king of Paradise, welcoming the faithful, who were represented by lambs and surrounded by this timeless beauty.\n\n♪ This church captures the last chapter of Roman glory.\n\nIts sanctuary, an oasis of order, was meant to assure everyone that despite the chaos around them, all was right with the world.\n\nIts familiar Roman mosaics, countless vibrantly colored cubes the size of your fingernail, give the church an ethereal glow.\n\n♪ Christ is calmly in charge, overseeing the peaceful world below.\n\nAnd running things here on Earth is his partner, the last emperor to rule a united Rome -- Justinian.\n\nSporting both a halo and a crown, he unites both church and state, supported by bishops and generals, who, with steady gazes, radiate a sense of stability.\n\nFacing the emperor is his powerful wife, Theodora, and her elegant entourage.\n\nThe former dancer, who became his mistress, then empress, is decked out in rich jewels and pearls and carries a chalice to consecrate the new church.\n\nThe art here is propaganda, a celebration of the Roman world.\n\nEverything is in good order.\n\nThe ancient portrayal of Christ symbolizes perfection.\n\nThe stylized cross is flanked by two angels declaring victory.\n\nThe ceiling is a festival of God's creation, with nearly a hundred different birds, most still flying around this part of Italy.\n\nAnd everything swirls around a sacrificial lamb, which symbolizes Christ, supported by four angels.\n\nNotice how this Christ is beardless, the style of the ancient Romans, while, just steps away, this bearded Christ is the standard medieval portrayal of Jesus.\n\nThese are some of the last artworks of ancient Rome and the first of medieval works to come, bridging the ancient and medieval worlds.\n\nWith its harmonious atmosphere, it's a poignant reminder of the peace and stability of a Roman order that was coming to an end.\n\n♪ Despite the stabilizing influence of Christianity, Rome's decline was inevitable.\n\nThe once-great capital city of a million people, repeatedly ravaged by barbarians and plagues, eventually lost over 95% of its population.\n\nThe place where Rome began, the forum, was abandoned, later nicknamed the Cow Field.\n\nRome's grand structures crumbled, were built over, and eventually got buried under centuries of rubble, silt, and today's modern city.\n\nYes, Rome fell, but its spirit lived on in the Latin language, in laws and literature, in the Roman Catholic Church, and in its monumental art and architecture, grandeur that would inspire Europe for centuries to come.\n\nEurope offers a lifetime of artistic treasures, and the more you understand its art, the more you'll appreciate the society that created it.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed our sweep through the highlights of the Roman Empire, its dramatic rise, and a tumultuous fall that left Europe with a political vacuum that lasted for centuries.\n\nI'm Rick Steves.\n\nUntil next time, keep on travelin'.\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ ♪"
