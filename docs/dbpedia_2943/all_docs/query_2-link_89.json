        "text": "Draculaura is a 2010-introduced and all-around character. She is a Hungarian-Romanian (Székely) vampire, and the adopted daughter of Dracula. She attends Monster High as a student.\n\nHaving spent much of her childhood at the Vampire Court, Draculaura is used to being pampered. She is prone to crying when she has to deal with obstacles, and acts very ungrateful and easily frustrated. Like not being able to check her appearance in the mirror, though over the past years she has grown to follow that up with action. In particular her mission to find her childhood friend Elissabat and convince her to accept her role as the next Vampire Queen made waves in the monster world and was what earned her full access to her vampire powers. On an average day, Draculaura spends her time on schoolwork, hanging out with her friends and in particular, her BFF Clawdeen, fearleading, dating her boyfriend Clawd, tending to her vegetable garden, shopping, and catching up on the latest gossip. She has turned 1,600[2] and in \"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?\" and despite her old age, she is teenage age in vampire years or normie years (human years), being 15 years old at age 1,599 and being 16 years old at 1600.\n\nCharacter[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nDraculaura is the biological daughter of Camilla and Gaius, human residents in the Roman Empire. She was born in 412 AD. It so happens that Gaius, a Roman soldier, is the great-great-grandson of Trajan, one of Dracula's servants and friends. However, after he impregnates Camilla, he is killed in a battle, leaving the widow alone and with no means to support the soon-to-be-born child. In a move of compassion and honor of his old friend, Dracula gives aid to Camilla and receives them in his castle.\n\nSoon Draculaura is born, her name given as an honor to Dracula, who saved both her and her mother's lives. The family decides to move to the Dacia province, modern day Transylvania in Romania, to offer Draculaura the environment she needs. Kindhearted, Draculaura grows to be a happy child, and so did Camilla's and Dracula's relationship, as the vampire promotes her to head of the house and soon falls in love with her.\n\nHowever, as Dracula leaves Dacia to attend an old business in Rome, a plague invades the province, killing many of the inhabitants, in which Camilla is included. Dracula arrives home to find that the love of his life is dead and that Draculaura is sick too, so to prevent her death, he adopts her and converts her into a vampire, giving the child immortality and immunity to the plague.\n\nFrom that moment on, she was solely raised by Dracula in the Vampire Court, where she met her friend and fellow vampire, Elissabat, and spent most of her days being pampered or attending fabulous balls. [3]\n\nEventually, she started attending high school, in Transylvania, where she met her first boyfriend, Kieran Valentine, who secretly intended to fill her heart with love only to break it and add it to his sick collection of broken hearts. [4] Luckily, she escaped when she was sighted by humans, during a picnic, while eating a tomato. The humans mistook Draculaura's tomato for blood, calling an angry mob that forced them to run away from home and settle in Scaremerica.\n\nWhile in Scaremerica, Draculaura finds herself in the Division of the Worlds, with her father being an important supporter of the New World project, along with figures such as Hexicah Steam and Bloodgood, and stands for equality within the monster races, growing up to be the accepting girl she is, and eventually, she meets Clawdeen Wolf.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDraculaura is sweet, energetic, friendly, sensitive, and easygoing, though she can be a bit childish. She was one of Frankie's first friends and in New Ghoul @ School helped Frankie realize that she just might fit in. Even though she doesn't seem to care much of what other monsters think of her, Draculaura is much of a trend follower, as well as a \"gossip ghoul\", following Spectra's blog, the Ghostly Gossip, by heart.\n\nDraculaura is usually ecstatic and gets distracted easily, making her prone to accidents and mixed information, so she's usually portrayed as naïve, but ignorance is bliss as Draculaura's happiness rarely fades. She's the most emotional of the girls and cries the easiest. She's also shown to be a bit of a flirt, having the most crushes out of the cast. Being a vegan, she arranges her own food mostly from her vegetable garden. [5] Draculaura will faint when seeing meat in front of her. [6] [7] [8]Though this isn’t shown as a main running gag, but as a recurring joke.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nDraculaura is a slim, pale pink-skinned teenage vampire with grayish-violet eyes, a hot-pink heart-shaped beauty mark under her left eye, dark maroon brows, thick lashes and long, upper-thigh-length black hair with multiple deep-pink streaks, several of them on her straight bangs. While she can be seen in different hairstyles, her main hairstyle is that of fitted pigtails shaped like bat wings that are curled on the end. As per her type of monster, she sports pointy ears, sharp fangs, and skin that is sensitive to sunlight. Draculaura also wears makeup consisting of thick mascara, hot-pink eyeshadow, deep-pink lipstick, and hot-pink nail polish painted on her finger nails.\n\nDraculaura's attire is that of a Victorian-inspired wear with motives leaning more to both her vampire heritage, as well as her own taste such as shades of pink, with several shapes of hearts and layers of sparkles; she wears a set of white safety pin-shaped earrings, and a deep-pink either bat or flower shaped necklace which accessorized her white lace jabot. Her jabot serves as a decoration for her deep-pink vest with two gray buttons, worn over a long-sleeved dark grayish-violet mesh-blouse which includes noticeable glitter specks and light pink accents on their lace white cuffs. She also wore matching mesh-tights which are worn under her white frilled miniskirt - the skirt itself possesses deep-pink stitching around the thick waistband and fishnet-mesh trimming at the bottom. Draculaura also wore pink calf-high, high-heeled boots which includes light gray hearts placed on the top, black laces and black ribbons, as well as light gray soles and heels. She can also be seen carrying a black and deep-pink parasol which includes a skull-shaped tip, as well a bat-shaped handle.\n\nIn the cartoon series, Draculaura is notably shorter than all her friends, even in heels. In fact, she's the shortest of the main cast, being taller than only a few backgrounders and only looks about the same height as Ghoulia since the latter is never seen standing up straight, due to being a zombie. She and Howleen Wolf are almost the same height.\n\nDraculaura's Student Files[]\n\nParental Participation[]\n\nAcademic Standing[]\n\nSocial Interaction[]\n\nOverall[]\n\nFacebook Description[]\n\nDraculaura is a vegetarian vampire (I know, it's totally fangtastic, right?) She's 1,599 years old (later 1,600 years old) and the daughter of Dracula, but don't expect to find any black outfits in her wardrobe. Instead she prefers to splash in some cherry pink and accessorize with her frilly umbrella, which makes it so much easier to walk in the sun. It really sucks that she can't see her reflection in the mirror-I mean how does she know if her makeup and hair are just right? Of course, she has over one thousand years to practice. Oh, and she has a scary-cute pet bat, Count Fabulous, who she's always dressing up in the cutest little outfits!\n\nAbilities[]\n\nDraculaura holds the standard abilities and characteristics of a vampire, such as an allergy to anything that has garlic or to have a reflection in the mirror and the need to be invited into places before entering. However, Draculaura does not drink blood due to her vegan nature. Additionally:\n\nVampire Powers: After finding the rightful vampire queen Elissabat with her friends, Draculaura acquired her Vampire Powers, and consequently, the ability to turn into a bat at will. Despite this, she still has a lot to learn about such powers as she tends to have little control over them yet.\n\nLevitation: Like all vampires with their vampire powers, she can levitate at a small height.\n\nBat-changing: Draculaura is able to change into a bat at will. But this, as revealed in \"The Good, the Bat, and the Fabulous\", is a power vampires only get when they are old enough. In \"Frights, Camera, Action!\", it is then stated that a vampire can only gain the power to change into a bat when they do something outrageously of a good deed, such as Gory Fangtell had saved an important vampire lord from a sunburn.\n\nHanging from surfaces: Draculaura can hang from any ceiling no matter what material. In one webisode, she could even hang from a felt ceiling.\n\nImmortality: Like all vampires, she is immortal.\n\nEternal Youth: Since she's immortal, Draculaura has stopped aging.\n\nBat Communication: Draculaura is quite fluent in the Bat Language and because of it, she can talk to bats.\n\nSkillset[]\n\nWriting: Draculaura has a special liking for writing and storytelling and is talented in doing so. With this, she has decided to join various clubs, such as the school magazines and newspaper, and is a faithful reader of Spectra's Ghostly Gossip due to her love for gossip talk. It is however unknown how she feels about the revamp of the blog, now called the Gory Gazette.\n\nActing: Draculaura also has a rather hidden talent for drama, as shown by her ease to perform plays. [9]Although she does not act or have any lines in the movie that she had helped be performed by Elissabat, who goes by the alter ego Veronica Von Vamp, Draculaura is, however, is the one who gave Elissabat the line for her newest movie. [10]\n\nEmbroidery: Draculaura has another hidden talent, Embroidery. She picked it up in a boring week last century and thought it was so scary fun that she never really stopped. Even though it’s not a skill that comes in handy that often, but at least she can put cute designs on her pet Count Fabulous.\n\nMusic: As another special talent of hers, Draculaura is a talented singer, guitarist, and xylophone player.\n\nCheerleading: Draculaura is a good cheerleader (or \"fear leader\") and the most acrobatic in the Fear Squad.\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nGarlic: Draculaura has an allergy to garlic. In \"Fright On!\", she was ridden into acne as an effect.\n\nReflection: She doesn’t see herself in the mirror. Despite this, she has an app on her iCoffin, which is actually similar to the real life Camera app.\n\nSunlight: Contact to the sun will give Draculaura sunburn instead of transforming into dust. That explains why she has to SPF 500, and carries around an umbrella.\n\nBlood: Being a vegetarian, blood freaks Draculaura out so much it makes her faint. Multiple instances from the webisodes show her fainting at the sight of blood and this has been used against her by Torelai Stripe.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nDraculaura's Back to School diary reveals that Draculaura is in fact Dracula's adoptive daughter, not biological, and that he took in her and her mother \"when no one else would\". She also reveals that her father is not the Dracula who Bram Stoker wrote about.[11]\n\nDraculaura was born in AD 412[12] as the daughter of a centurion, Gaius.[13] Killed in a battle, he left Draculaura and her mother homeless. After some time, the two made their way to the province of Dacia, which in modern days partially overlaps with Transylvania,[12] where Draculaura's mother became a housekeeper of Dracula.[13] She and her mother fell subject to a wasting disease (presumably tuberculosis) and her mother, Alina/Camilla, died because of it. Dracula turned Draculaura into a vampire before she could die too, beginning her life as an immortal. One way or another, Draculaura ended up being adopted by Dracula and eventually moved with him to the USA after being chased away by angry villagers.\n\nDraculaura and her father live on the same street as Holt Hyde/Jackson Jekyll \"in what is either a gigantic mansion or a small castle. I guess you'd have to go with mansion, but only because there isn't a moat and a drawbridge.\"[14] Draculaura gets along with her father, although she thinks he is very old fashioned (he bought her Victorian dresses for back-to-school clothes).[15] Every year he tries to convince her to be a more traditional vampire, including keeping nighttime hours and drinking blood.[16]\n\nShe has a cousin named Thad. [17]\n\nIn the Monster High book series, she lives with her father (he is the leader of the RADs), her grandparents, and other relatives. The Ghoul Next Door mentions that she has an uncle named Vlad. In Back and Deader Than Ever, in an argument, Draculaura has a flashback to when her mother dies and she was turned into a vampire. Her biological parents are her mother Camilla and her father Gaius.\n\nHer father met Ramoanah while on business in Antarctica. The two later married, and Ramoanah became Draculaura’s stepmother.[18]\n\nFriends[]\n\nDraculaura is best friends with Clawdeen Wolf, and the two have accepted Frankie Stein within their group. Draculaura's outgoing nature has earned her many other friends too, including Lagoona Blue, Ghoulia Yelps, Spectra Vondergeist, Abbey Bominable and Cleo de Nile.\n\nWhile living in Transylvania, Draculaura was good friends with Elissabat. Elissabat comes back in \"Frights, Camera, Action!\" and is seen with her in Master of Hiss-guise. She is very popular in school with friends and is also friends with Operetta and Spectra Vondergeist, along with Clawdeen's sister Howleen Wolf|Howleen. In the books, Draculaura is also friends with Jackson Jekyll, his girlfriend Melody Carver, and his alter-ego D.J. Hyde.\n\nPets[]\n\nDraculaura's pet bat is named Count Fabulous. She likes to dress him up in pink, coordinated outfits, and gen made an online account to post his newest looks, most adorable outfits, he loves to pose! (“Theres no bat fashionable count fabulous” says Draculaura) isn’t He's just most elegant insectivore in the world? Her diet for him is composed of small insects and sometimes fruits, like bananas. And she calls him her BFF (Bat Friend Forever).\n\nIn the Monster High book series, her full list of pets includes a dog named Teeny Turner, a snake named Snake Gyllenhaal, an orange kitten named Kitson, a lactose-intolerant parakeet named The Worminator, a rat named Rat-a-tat, two turtles, a white bunny and two pets of unknown species named Fuego and Caliente.\n\nRomance[]\n\nDraculaura is a romantic idealist who places a lot of value on finding the right one and maintaining a relationship that is \"perfect\". Currently, she has found her perfect partner in Clawd Wolf, a kind, athletic, smart, and loyal werewolf who also happens to be her best friend's brother. The two of them have experienced several ups and downs, such as when Clawd was convinced by his werewolf pals that a vampire was a bad partner choice in \"Fright On!\" and when another vampire out for Draculaura's heart hypnotized her into loving him in \"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?\". Through it all, though, the spell was broken, the two have stayed strong together, and are more in love than ever, even sharing a kiss by the end of the movie.\n\nPrior to her dating Clawd, Draculaura has had an interest in many guys. In the webisode \"The Hot Boy\", she forms a crush on Heath Burns and is also seen dancing with him at the Justin Biter concert in \"New Ghoul @ School\", but is over him by the episode \"Fur Will Fly\", calling him \"conceited\". However, he later \"wears her down\" about going to the Spirit Rally Dance with him in \"Why We Fright\"; she chooses not to go with him after he mocks her in the next webisode. That is when Clawd offers to take her to the dance instead, beginning their budding romance. In the early webisodes of Volume 1 (specifically early webisodes or earlier webisodes, per se), she has a crush on Justin Biter. She soon got over him for the Jaundice Brothers according to \"Fur Will Fly\" and \"New Ghoul @ School\".\n\nIn the earlier webisodes, she was also attracted to a mysterious student known only as the \"Perfect Guy\" in the webisode \"Horrorscope\". His face is never seen, and he seems to have been a character exclusive to that one episode. She’s one of the many girls that glanced at Archer as he walks by. The Stich-uation She dated a vampire named Kieran Valentine in the past, prior to her time in Monster High, as seen in \"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?\". In her diary, it is stated that she also had a crush on Jackson Jekyll at one point, when he first moved into her neighborhood. However, nothing came of this relationship due to Jackson forgetting all of their plans for evening dates.[19] However, at the club they planned to go to together, she meets Holt Hyde, and the two tear it up on the dance floor, he stated in his journal what a \"little vampire hottie\" she is. It is shown that she has developed feelings for Clawd Wolf when he rescues her from a sudden downpour. [20]He drops her off at her doorstep, and she gives him a kiss on the cheek before quickly going inside, hinting at their relationship to come.\n\nBooks[]\n\nIn the Monster High book series, Draculaura is often called Lala by her friends, while Draculaura is her RAD (Regular Attribute Dodger) name. She often has makeup smears and smudges because she can't see her reflection. She is often wearing cashmere and spending her time in the steam room because she is always cold due to having no pulse. She has pale skin, pink highlighted hair (which matches her makeup and outfits), and fangs.\n\nDraculaura is a vegan in both the Monster High books and the cartoon series. At one point, she complained to Blue (Lagoona) that there was a lack of vegan options in the cafeteria and her having to consume iron supplements. She also complained that Clawdeen had burger breath.\n\nAccording to her, Melody's family rented their house from Lala's grandparents. In The Ghoul Next Door, she takes part in the documentary of the same name. But her part of the documentary is audio only, and pictures were put in her place, due to her not showing up on film.\n\nIn Where There's a Wolf, There's a Way, she is sent out to her grandparents' house, much to her dismay. However, she shows up at Clawdeen's hideout with her father's permission, where she develops a crush on Clawd and even convinces him to let her give him a mohawk. She is present at Clawdeen's party, where she flaunts her RAD status.\n\nIn Back and Deader Than Ever, she submits the T'eau Dally admittance letter, only to find out she's one of the finalists. When she found out about her father's plan of establishing a RAD-only school, she deals with him that if she won his plan, it would be annulled; it's unknown if Merston won the contest, but its loss was somewhat implied, thus making Monster High.\n\nLogs[]\n\nTimeline[]\n\nOctober 23, 2007: Mattel requests the trademark for Ula D which was originally to be Draculaura's name.\n\nSeptember 8, 2008: Mattel requests the trademark for Draculaura.\n\nFebruary 25, 2010: Mattel requests the trademark for Draculaura in the costume category.\n\nMay 05, 2010: The Monster High website goes live, featuring Draculaura's profile.\n\nMay 05, 2010: Draculaura's profile art is revealed.\n\nMay 05, 2010: Draculaura makes her animated debut in the Higher Deaducation commercial.\n\nMay 05, 2010: Draculaura makes her 2D cartoon debut in \"Jaundice Brothers\".\n\nEarly July, 2010: Draculaura's debut doll is released as part of the 'Basic' series.\n\nEarly July, 2010: Draculaura makes her diary debut in her 'Basic' diary.\n\nEarly July, 2010: Draculaura's debut plushie is released as part of the Friends series.\n\nAugust 29, 2011: Mattel abandons the trademark for Ula D.\n\nSeptember 01, 2010: Draculaura makes her Monster High book debut in Monster High.\n\nFebruary 12, 2012: Draculaura makes her 3D cartoon debut in \"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?\".\n\nSeptember 05, 2012: Draculaura makes her Ghoulfriends book debut in Ghoulfriends Forever.\n\nOctober 22, 2014: Draculaura makes her anime debut in \"Monster High Life Is Amazing!\".\n\nNotes[]\n\nEarly on, Draculaura was supposed to be vegan, a character trait referenced in the Higher Deaducation commercial and website version of her profile. This was changed into her being vegetarian, which she is said to be in the doll version of her profile, in the cartoon series, and in the Monster High books.\n\nIn one commercial, Draculaura spoke in an American accent instead of her usual Transylvania accent.\n\nIn the movie “Great Scarrier Reef ”, she was more pushy about carnivores (and I do mean pushy).\n\nConsidering Dracula is Székely (a Hungarian ethnic group living predominantly in Romania), that means so is Draculaura.\n\nDraculaura speaks with a Hungarian accent. The accent is based off Béla Lugosi's accent. He was the first person to ever portray Dracula.\n\nThis is later confirmed in \"We Stop Hate\" that she mentioned her size and she talks kind of funny.\n\nHer human name by her mother was Laura, before it was Draculaura. She was also called \"Laura\" in \"Back and Deader Than Ever.\"\n\nAlthough Ula D was confirmed to be her nickname, it wasn't mentioned in any media.\n\nShe and Howleen Wolf both love poetry.\n\nAs mentioned in the website, Draculaura is the president of two clubs: The Newspaper Club and the Drama Club.\n\nUnlike most vampires, Draculaura can pronounce her \"W\" words.\n\nDraculaura is hemophobic, which means she faints from the sight of blood, and meat products.\n\nHer full birthday was February 14th, 412 AD, which means her star sign is Aquaris.\n\nShe was raised as an only child by a single parent, later Dracula would go on to marry Romoanah.\n\nShe can remember the elements of the periodic table backwards.\n\nThe only vegetable that she can't stand is obviously garlic.\n\nGallery\n\nClick here to view the Gallery of Draculaura (G1).\n\nReferences[]"
