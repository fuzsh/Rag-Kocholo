        "text": "*The Alfred Hitchcock theme plays as The Warlock pops up*\n\nW: Welcome ladies and gentlemen to a special tribute month here on Warlock’s Movie Realm. Last August one of the best film critics and colleagues Emer Prevost, the architect of Reaction & Review, unfortunately passed away. In honor of Emer, I dedicate this entire month to doing movies that he either mentioned or covered on his amazing web series. Some of his best hits and misses will be featured this month. We begin this month with a solo effort and I’ll get to why in a moment. Tonight we kick off Emer Prevost’s Tribute month with one of the most controversial movies of all time. That’s right I’m talking about the 1979 horror drama….\n\n*holds up DVD box*\n\nW: ……Caligula. Here’s a little bit of history behind this. Tinto Brass and Gore Vidal wanted to make a 90 minute feature length film about the life and times of Gaius Caligula, the fourth Emperor of the Roman Empire. At the same time Larry Flynt of the world famous porn mag Hustler wanted to do a one hour porno film about the same thing with Bob Guccione at the helm. Rather than do two separate entities, the major domos decided that they would combine their effort into a 2 1/2 hour marathon of a movie. That’s why I will be flying solo today because there’s no way I’m making D, America, my father or Neyz sit through 2 1/2 hours of a high budget porno. Now before I begin I must admit I’ve always been a fan of Ancient Roman history, so I will be treating this differently than a lot of others will. Is the film any good? The only way I’m gonna find out is if I shut up and push play and I’m gonna do that, right now. So without further adieu its time to kick back, relax and check out Caligula.\n\nWritten by Bob Guccione and Gore Vidal\n\nDirected by Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione\n\nCast:\n\nCaligula (Malcolm McDowell)\n\nJulia Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy)\n\nMacro (Guido Mannari)\n\nMacro’s voice (Patrick Allen)\n\nNerva (John Gielgud)\n\nTiberius (Peter O’Toole)\n\nClaudius (Giancarlo Badessi)\n\nGemellus (Bruno Brive)\n\nEnnia (Adriana Asti)\n\nCharicles (Leopoldo Trieste)\n\nChaerea (Paulo Bonacelli)\n\nChaerea’s voice (Joss Ackland)\n\nLonginus (John Steiner)\n\nLivia (Mirella D’Angelo)\n\nCaesonia (Helen Mirren)\n\nMnester (Rick Parets)\n\nSubura Singer (Paula Mitchell)\n\nGiant (Osiride Pevarello)\n\nProculus (Donato Placido)\n\nMessalina (Anneka Di Lorenzo)\n\nAgrippina (Lori Wagner)\n\nRoman Soldiers (Gerardo Amato, Pino Ammendola and Fortunato Arena)\n\nHigh Priest of Rome (Eduardo Bergara Leumann)\n\nImperial Brothel Worker (Signe Berger)\n\nThe Executioner (Eolo Capritti)\n\nPriestess of Isis (Valerie Rae Clark)\n\n*The Warlock reads the tagline*\n\nW: “Details the graphic and shocking, yet undeniably tragic story of Rome’s most infamous Caesar, Gaius Germanicus Caligula.”\n\nW: And an hour long porno mixed in there.\n\n*Opening graphic Pagan Rome 37-41 AD*\n\nA 4 year reign of terror.\n\n*Sheep run by as Caligula and Julia Drusilla make out by a tree*\n\nW: For you youngsters that don’t know, that’s Caligula’s biological sister. I guess they’re taking the “rumor” that they were lovers and coming right out with it.\n\n*Caligula and Drusilla frolic in the woods before stopping to mack by a different tree*\n\nW: For those who want to know, it was still taboo yet more accepted to mack your sister in those days….but marrying them was a no-no.\n\n*Caligula coin bleeds from its eyes. Caligula’s voice gives a short promo claiming he is a God taking the form of Caligula. Opening credits*\n\nW: Creeeeepy\n\n*Drusilla and Caligula roll around naked and Caligula insults Claudius*\n\nW: This is no longer the worst movie of all time.\n\n*Macro walks in as Drusilla splits*\n\nW: Yeah even Roman imperials didn’t approve of their relationship.\n\n*Macro says Tiberius wants to see him one last time. Caligula says may he live forever. He asks how Macro’s wife Ennia is and he tells him not well. Caligula tells him to wait outside and he embraces Drusilla when he’s gone*\n\nW: Everyone moved up by assassination back then.\n\n*Naked men smash rock with hammers as Caligula is carried to the Emperor’s quarters. Caligula asks Nerva why so many friends of theirs were killed by Tiberius*\n\nW: He’s an asshole!\n\n*A bunch of women breast feed babies with naked girls all over the place. Tiberius swims with young boys*\n\nW: Everyone was fucked up then.\n\n*Tiberius wants Caligula to do his dance that he used to do for the soldiers. Caligula dances while Tiberius is surrounded by teenagers in the water. Claudius laughs at Caligula*\n\nW: Believe it or not this was common practice in ancient Rome. Also gotta love the guard trying not to laugh for real. Claudius is having a jolly old time though.\n\n*Tiberius exits the water as do the kids. Tiberius asks him why he wishes his death. Caligula denies it. Tiberius says his little fishes love him as we get a closeup shot of some kid’s uncircumsized dick and a girl’s vagina*\n\nW: If they’re not 18, Tinto Brass deserves to be put in a stockade.\n\n*Nerva says Tiberius is the third Emperor behind Julius Caesar and Augustus*\n\nW: Yay, a real fact.\n\n*Tiberius tells Nerva to watch out for Macro when he’s dead*\n\nW: Macro’s right there, he can’t feel too good.\n\n*Tiberius says when he’s gone he and Gemellus are his heirs…and Claudius. Caligula says he’s a god and Tiberius says he’s not. Caligula says Julius Caesar and Augustus are gods and Tiberius says the senate says so but he knows otherwise*\n\nW: At least he’s self aware.\n\n*Caligula pushes Claudius into the pool*\n\nW: Hahahaha\n\n*Macro ties a bag to some guy’s dick as some woman plays with herself. He then drowns the guy in wine*\n\nW: Waste none.\n\n*Tiberius walks by a brothel with Caligula in tow. One woman says she’s from Britain*\n\nW: Great Britain was apart of the Roman Empire.\n\n*Orgy commences when Tiberius cracks a whip*\n\nW: Here’s the Guccione stuff.\n\n*Tiberus says one particular woman is the best*\n\nW: I love how Caligula doesn’t seem interested. He wants Drusilla.\n\n*Tiberius says he didn’t want to become Emperor but he had to. He said if someone else had been emperor, he would have been killed as would Caligula*\n\nW: True story. Every emperor wanted to wipe out the previous regime. Like mob bosses in the 1920’s.\n\n*A naked juggler performs*\n\nW: I wonder if that guy told his kids that he was in a porno/movie and just juggled.\n\n*Macro kills the guy he was torturing with wine then tells him the Senator sent documents over*\n\nW: You can tell how bad the looping is dubbed. Guy probably couldn’t speak English like Goldfinger couldn’t.\n\n*Macro says the Senator is guilty of treason, Tiberius says they are all guilty of treason. The senate is an enemy of all Caesars. Tiberius asks Caligula how good Ennia is in bed and he says ask Macro. Then he asks how good Julia Drusilla is and Caligula pretends to not know. Tiberius tells him he knows everything*\n\nW: Tiberius is no fool.\n\n*Gemellus walks downstairs and Tiberius says he’s too young to be Emperor. Tiberius embraces Gemellus and says he is his grandson, Caligula says he is too but Tiberius says Caligula was adopted. Gemellus is the last of Julius Caesar’s bloodline*\n\nW: Another true fact.\n\n*Tiberius tells Gemellus that once Tiberius is dead, Caligula will kill him unlesss Caligula dies first*\n\nW: Its a race of who’s gonna kill who.\n\n*Caligula wakes up next to Julia and says “he’s going to kill us just the way he killed our papa and our friends.” Julia tries to talk sense by saying Gemellus is too young and Claudius is too old, Caligula will be emperor. Caligula wants her to be his queen and she says no, you can’t. He says they can in Egypt and she says they’re not in Egypt*\n\nW: Yeah, like I said earlier fucking your sister was taboo yet still somewhat accepted in the imperial class, but marrying her was still a complete no-no. Have to remember it wasn’t until Constantine made the Roman Empire follow Christianity that they started going by their rules, sacraments, etc. Incest, adultery and treachery reigned supreme back in these times.\n\n*Caligula admits he promised Ennia to be his queen*\n\nW: Yuck.\n\n*Caligula finds a bird under the bed*\n\nW: Best supporting actor?\n\n*Macro brings Ennia to Caligula wearing a pink towel on his head*\n\nW: He looks very Sheik this evening.\n\n*Ennia tells him to take the Emperor title. Caligula fondles her breasts until Tiberius screams out. Everyone turns and looks and apparently Nerva has slit his wrists in a bathtub*\n\nW: That was ancient Rome’s suicide ritual. You’d have a huge party and then off yourself in a bathtub. They mentioned it in The Godfather Part 2.\n\n*Tiberius asks how he could do it and Nerva says he’s old and hates his life*\n\nW: He needed Dr Kevorkian.\n\n*Nerva says when Tiberius dies, Macro will kill him. Tiberius says he’ll have Macro killed. Nerva says if Macro doesn’t do it, “the reptile” meaning Caligula will. Nerva says Tiberius had his whole family killed and he’s turned into a monster, Nerva has had enough*\n\nW: Can’t blame the guy for being smart enough to see the writing on the wall.\n\n*Tiberius leaves and Caligula gets excited and asks Nerva what’s it like to be dying*\n\nW: Jesus, give the guy a break, he just wants to die in peace.\n\n*Caligula asks if he can see the goddess Isis and Nerva says no. Head slapping effect*\n\nW: Right out of the Stooges.\n\n*Caligula asks what Isis is like and Nerva says he sees nothing. Caligula drowns him*\n\nW: He was already dead though.\n\n*Useless footage of people milling around naked*\n\nW: Guccione’s doing.\n\n*High Priest argues with Caligula watching. Close up of his eyes*\n\nW: He’s planning his takeoer.\n\n*Macro says Charicles has news for Caligula. Tiberius has less than a year to live. Caligula kisses Macro on the lips*\n\nW: The Roman kiss of death.\n\n*Macro intentionally burns his hand in loyalty to Caligula. Meanwhile Claudius plays with dice*\n\nW: I know Claudius was written to be a bit eccentric but they’re making him out to be a retard in this movie.\n\n*Macro throws everyone out of Tiberius chamber. Caligula stays behind and pulls his ring off and puts it on, thinking he’s Emperor. Tiberius wakes up and demand his ring back. Caligula refuses and goes to level him with a mirror. Tiberius “YOU…DO…NOT…DARE!” Macro runs in and takes the mirror from him*\n\nW: Macro to the rescue.\n\n*Macro turns and strangles Tiberius to death with a scarf*\n\nW: Nevermind.\n\n*Macro hails Caligula as the new Caesar. He’ll get everyone assembled tomorrow for the announcement. He leaves and Caligula looks at Tiberius’ corpse. He then calls out for Gemellus. Gemellus runs over and kisses his ring*\n\nW: Yeah he’s not gonna last.\n\n*Caligula says they must love each other. Next frame is Tiberius funeral/Caligula’s coronation. Drusilla says he is Caesar now, lord of the world. Caligula “Lord of the world…I like this”\n\nW: Drunk with power.\n\n*Caligula reads parchment proclaiming himself to be Emperor. Longinus turns his back and Claudius falls asleep*\n\nW: Nice.\n\n*Tiberius supporters shout at Caligula. Caligula drowns them out by saying he grants general amnesty. Macro shuts up the crowd. Caligula names Claudius his right hand man and he “adopts” Gemellus as his son*\n\nW: That’s like Eddie Guerrero naming Chavo as his “son”.\n\n*Caligula names Drusilla as one of his aides. Macro whispers to be careful of Gemellus. Later Caligula laughs about naming Drusilla as his trusted aide just to piss everyone off. He kisses up on her and says he can do anything he likes to anyone. He goes to mack her but someone is coming. He looks outside to see a transexual getting a blowjob*\n\nW: What…the…hell?\n\n*Julia says to get rid of Macro. At the coronation Caligula tells Macro to go get Gemellus. Caligula tells Charicles to stand next to him. Longinus doesn’t like what Caligula is doing but Caligula tells him to stand against the wall. He tells Gemellus to look at the men on the wall and point out who killed Tiberius. Gemellus fingers Macro with Caligula nodding at Macro to assist him. Caligula feigns ignorance and labels Macro a murderer before having him arrested. Nobody moves. He bribes all the guards with 10 gold pieces to arrest him. Macro “Don’t you dare!” and he walks away. Caligula laughs and celebrates with Julia when Chaerea walks in saying he’s got business. Caligula messes around with his parchments and proclamations*\n\nW: This is partily why they wanted to axe Caligula, he didn’t take his position seriously.\n\n*A bunch of men jack off into a chalise*\n\nW: As gross as that is, that’s symbolism of the male dominance.\n\n*Caligula runs into Ennia’s chamber and tells her she looks beautiful. Ennia says they will be married soon and the divorce will take a few days. Caligula says why not move to Egypt? She says why would they move to Egypt? Caligula says hes not moving while taking a piss*\n\nW: That’s an integral part of the movie.\n\n*Longinus and Chaerea walk in and says the order of execution will be carried out. Caligula tosses something to Chaerea and says he’s the new leader of the armed guards. Ennia asks what happened to Macro and Chaerea says he’s been arrested for treason. Ennia says he made Caligula, he denies it. Caligula says he took his destiny in his own hands and he fondles her. He says Ennia is to be banished. She shouts that he betrayed Macro*\n\nW: What an asshole.\n\n*Caligula runs to Drusilla and says they don’t have to worry about divorce now. Julia says he still needs to find a suitable wife. He says no and fondles her breasts, he chooses her. Julia says he can’t do that*\n\nW: Jesus christ, is her pussy THAT amazing?\n\n*Caligula says lets go to Egypt and he runs around “Caesar cannot be a fooooooool” Julia says he is to marry a lady from the Senatorial class. She wants him to have an heir and he counters by saying the heir will kill him. She is having a Lady of Isis party later and he’s to marry one of them, he continues to refuse*\n\nW: Here comes the Guccione footage.\n\n*More orgy footage with Drusilla and Caligula watching*\n\nW: You know, they’re probably so used to nudity he’s probably thinking “What makes these girls all special?”\n\n*Caligula chooses Livia and Julia says she’s already taken. Two girls make out with each other, another fondles herself. Caligula spots Caesonia and says she’s the one. Drusilla says she’s the most mysterious woman in Rome. Caligula says “Perfect!”\n\nW: Stop being picky!\n\n*Caligula wants Caesonia and Julia tries to talk him out of it. He says it is the will of Rome and send her to him*\n\nW: Maybe I’m thinking too much but these people are depicted to being having sex all day every day, wouldn’t that get kind of boring?\n\n*Caligula chooses Caesonia, cuts her neck and drinks her blood*\n\nW: What is he a vampire now?\n\n*Caligula hits Caesonia from the back*\n\nW: Not wasting any time is he? Damn Helen Mirren was hot back in the day.\n\n*Score plays as he takes Caesonia*\n\nW: This score is haunting yet cool at the same time.\n\n*Giant threshing lawnmowing device kills people buried in the dirt. Gemellus, Caligula, Claudius and Drusilla all throw eggs at Macro as his head is chopped off. Caligula says “if only all of Rome had just one neck*\n\nW: That takes care of Macro but I don’t remember machines like that built in 37 AD.\n\n*Livia is with Proculus. Caligula calls over Longinus and says to take Proculus out*\n\nW: Fucking A.\n\n*Caligula, Caesonia and Drusilla attend a feast. Giant dicks and vaginas are around*\n\nW: This was normal actually. Even in Pompeii they had dicks painted on walls to show the locations of brothels.\n\n*Caligula brings brings Livia and Proculous into the kitchen. Julia says she thought he didn’t like virgins, he says he’s never known one. Caligula takes Livia and tells her to take her robe off. She does and we get a closeup of his hands on her ass before giving it a smack*\n\nW: Gotta love Italian bubble booty.\n\n*Caligula spreads her wide and asks Proculus if she’s a virgin, he says yes. Caligula says you can never be too sure. He then rapes her and tells Proculus to open his eyes and watch. He cums inside her and the whole party stops*\n\nW: He wanted her first, Julia.\n\n*Caligula wipes the blood from her vagina and says “She really was a virgin.” He makes Proculus take his robe off. He bends over Proculus, wipes soap on his hand*\n\nW: He’s not gonna do what I think he is….is he?\n\n*Caligula fists Proculus, wipes the blood off and gives his blessings to them both*\n\nW: He did…..\n\n*Caligula’s next target is Gemellus. He runs out into the rain and shouts for Gemellus. He shouts “Jupiter loves me!” Caligula starts dancing around naked and Caesonia calls out for Drusilla. Caligula claims Gemellus wants him dead and he collapses. He’s carried back to his chamber*\n\nW: I’d say that was a bad trip, but I don’t think narcotics were around in 37 AD.\n\n*Caligula kisses up on Drusilla and Caesonia as two naked chicks wrestle over to look at them through a peephole*\n\nW: Haha.\n\n*The two girls start making out*\n\nW: More Guccione footage.\n\n*One girl ass worships the other*\n\nW: Now we’re talking, although I can see why this was part of the hour cut from the theatrical release.\n\n*Alternating footage of Caligula’s three way with girl on girl action*\n\nW: Roger Ebert was totally disgusted by this….I’m loving it.\n\n*Two girls 69 each other and get off*\n\nW: Jesus.\n\n*Caligula has his citizens hail his horse*\n\nW: Hahahaha.\n\n*Caligula asks Claudius if he should make himself king of the republic. Longingus says he’s better than any king. Caligula says hell be a god when he’s dead*\n\nW: Again, Claudius was a bit of a nut but they make him out to be a moron here.\n\n*Caligula asks what’s wrong with Gemellus and Gemellus says he took an antidote thinking he was about to be poisoned. Caligula yells at him that such accusation is treason and has Chaerea arrest him. He’s taken away kicking and screaming. Caligula quips that there’s no antidote for him. Drusilla is pissed and Caligula says he’s a threat. She says he’s not a threat and Caesonia is carrying his child. Caligula says Gemellus will die anyway and she calls him an amateur. He slaps her down and the room stops*\n\nW: Wow, someone kill him.\n\n*Julia runs away and Caligula eats and says “It wasn’t even poisoned.” Everyone laughs as Caligula gags and pretends to be sick. Caesonia “Well done, but what to do about Drusilla, what she said was treason.” Caligula says he’ll handle her and he wants Caesonia to dance. She’s afraid of the baby and Caligula says he doesn’t care. She has the worst looking baby bump as she performs for the orgy crowd*\n\nW: I like the score but this is taking too long.\n\n*Caligula calls the horse beautiful and says Drusilla before throwing up*\n\nW: So was he poisoned or what?\n\n*Chaerea says Caligula’s fever will break soon. Caligula hysterically asks for Drusilla and she runs toward him. He says hes dying and she says he’s not. He wants to make his will and he wants Longinus. Longinus meets with Claudius and Chaerea about killing Caligula and Caesonia overhears them. She calls Longinus over and Caligula wants to make out a will. He wants Drusilla to be the new Emperor and he apologizes for arguing. He tells her to not let him die. She strokes him and Chaerea says its contagious. She doesn’t listen and Claudius says he’ll give his life to Jupiter if Caligula survives. He pops up and says to have him executed. They lead him away*\n\nW: He’s not gonna die.\n\n*Caligula has to announce his proclomation before signing every document. He starts speeding up his speech to make it go quicker*\n\nW: Hahaha\n\n*Caligula says to hell with this and has Proculus strung up. He says Livia is pregnant but doesn’t know if the father is Proculous or God. He stabs him and jumps on him asking if he can see Isis. Caligula has his guards kill him but is mad it went too quick. A woman pisses on the corpse*\n\nW: Yeah, classy.\n\n*Caligula tells Longinus to cut Proculus dick off and send it to Livia as a message. Longinus cuts it off and feeds it to the dog, says to send his remains to Livia*\n\nW: The symbolism is that Longinus doesn’t like Caligula.\n\n*Caligula hears someone cry out. Its Caesonia having the baby, we see the babys head coming out*\n\nW: Oh we actually get to see it? Mind if I eat?\n\n*Caligula proclaims his son to be his heir and Caesonia to be his wife. The baby is born just fine…only its a girl. Caligula is pissed and Julia says there will be other children. Caligula says his SON is Julia Drusilla and one gold coin to everyone in Rome. Meanwhile the real Julia Drusilla collapses from the same fever that Caligula had*\n\nW: Ancient Rome STD. Not to mention Tiberius was dying of syphilis before they offed him.\n\n*Caligula tends to Drusilla. Chaerea says he’s doing all that he can but the fever has to take its course. Caligula prays to the gods to take him instead but Julia stops moving. Chaerea calls out to Caligula and Caligula slow burns when he sees Julia, she’s dead*\n\nW: He’s gonna flip….he was nuts already but now he’s gonna FLIP!\n\n*Caesonia ses Drusilla dead and runs out crying*\n\nW: There goes her competition.\n\n*Caligula throws everyone out and goes berserk*\n\nW: Yup, saw that coming.\n\n*Caligula smashes the statue of Isis in a rage*\n\nW: That’s why you don’t pray to gods.\n\n*Caligula kisses her lips and rips her clothes off*\n\nW: Oh boy, above everything else we’ve seen, now we get necrophilia.\n\n*Caligula makes love to Julia’s corpse including ass worshiping her*\n\nW: If what they say is true about losing bowel control when you die, that should have been fucking disgusting.\n\n*Caligula carries Drusilla out of the chamber as we get a montage of their relationship in the movie*\n\nW: Yay, flashback scenes. As if we didn’t already have enough padding with the porno footage.\n\n*Caligula screams and we cut to a party*\n\nW: Yeah, nothing says mourning like orgies.\n\n*Caligula walks through Rome in disguuse and a proclomation is sent out that for a solid month no one is to laugh or have sex or they will be executed*\n\nW: NO MORE FUN OF ANY KIND!\n\n*Caligula finds the citizens of Rome not listening to the proclomation and talking shit about him. A ceremony takes place with a human pyramid to make fun of him and Drusilla. Caligula crashes the party and tries to kill the woman but he’s restrained and thrown out of the party*\n\nW: Love how nobody recognizes him.\n\n*Next scene has all the hecklers rounded up in a caged carriage as the guards wake up Caligula*\n\nW: How did they know where to find him?\n\n*Caesonia asks Longinus how Caligula is. Longinus says he’s gone to Egypt or Greece. She asks him what he really thinks and Longinus says he could be anywhere. Meanwhile more prisoners are thrown into the dungeon including Caligula himself. He watches the debauchery first hand*\n\nW: Getting a taste of his own medicine.\n\n*Caligula takes his ring off and does a magic trick with it to delight the crowd. The leader of the prisoners realizes its Caligula. Caligula is released and he drags the man with him to the imperial palace. He kicks Claudius out of the way and says “I have existed from the morning of the world and I shall exist until the last star falls from the night. Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula I am all men as I am no man and therefore I am….a God. Crowd mumbles*\n\nW: They’re like “Yeah ok, he’s lost it.”\n\n*Caligula proclaims himself to be a God and Chaerea scoffs. Caligula makes goat noises and proclaims the period of mourning is now over. Longinus says “He’s mad!”\n\nW: Ya think?\n\n*Caesonia tells Caligula to enjoy himself and take care before sharing a kiss*\n\nW: Where’s he going, China?\n\n*Caligula calls Longinus the financial wizard.

Last frame is of dead Caligula*\n\nW: Goodbye you madman.\n\n*End credits*\n\nW: I MADE IT! I MADE IT!!!!!!!\n\nThe Warlock’s Assessment: This is going to be different because I have to review in essence two different movies. If you take away the porn clips this is an easy 8 out of 10. The acting was amazing, the story was accurate except for Claudius and it had a whole creepy vibe the whole film. The problem was the hour of porn footage thrown in, it just just seemed to drag on and on. So if you’re watching the theatrical version, great fucking movie…8 out of 10. If you’re watching the unrated version, 6 out of 10 and a chore to sit through.\n\nFinal Grade: 6 or 8 out of 10 – Good or Outstanding.\n\nWarlock: Well guys that was Caligula, let me shut that off. Okay….where do I begin with this? As I mentioned earlier if this was just the 90 minute movie I would have had a BLAST watching this. It was a mostly accurate portrayal of pagan Rome and the debauchery that occurred under Caligula’s rule. The acting here was superb and it was a gritty, dirty, bloody movie that is going to make most people sick if they watch it. Do I recommend this? Yes, no and maybe. If you’re not into a 2 1/2 hour porno then don’t bother, if you’re not into Ancient Rome or horror then don’t bother. If you’re into nudity and into Ancient Rome you may like the 2 hour 36 minute movie. If you’re a complete sick fuck like I am I highly recommend the 90 minute movie. Well Emer Prevost tribute month is off to a rollicking start, next time I’ll pick something better. With that we come to the close of another edition of Warlock’s Movie Realm. Until next time ladies and gentlemen, take care and I will see you all in the near future. Peace!"
