The Renaissance produced outstanding artists such as Donatello, Botticelli, Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; but these artists could not have existed without their patrons. It is this inter-connection which is our theme. The course will examine the emergence of Renaissance Florence via site visits to churches, palaces, museums and classroom sessions. The story is an unprecedented and excititng one: one small city produced a staggering array of artistic talent in a short period of time. Classical antiquity was the model, not only in artistic terms but in philosophical and political ones as well: Florence saw the rebirth of classical antiquity. The impact of that rebirth, that renaissance, still affects us today: our ways of thought, our ways of seeing are conditioned by that momentous period which changed the past forever, and ushered in the first modern era.\n\n3 ART1300CDrawing I\n\nThis course includes creative expression and communication using a variety of black and white media.\n\n3 AST1002Planets/Stars/Galaxies\n\nThis course provides general acquaintance with some of the facts, concepts and scientific methods of astronomy.
