Additionally, IES Abroad reserves the right to cancel a course due to insufficient enrollment or circumstances beyond our control.\n\nPartner Institution Courses\n\nAccademia di Costume e Moda\n\nThe Accademia di Costume e Moda is only offered during the Fall semester.

The group will have lunch in the area and then move to a tiny medieval village...\n\nPart-Time Internships\n\nDid you know that, while in Rome, you can intern as part of your study abroad experience? With a part-time internship, you’ll gain global work experience that will increase your job readiness and give you an advantage after graduation. With an internship, you will:\n\nTake an important step in your career development by navigating the professional world with our support.\n\nLearn more about yourself both personally and professionally and build confidence in the process.\n\nExperience what working in Rome is really like and gain an authentic understanding of the workplace culture while developing real, applicable job skills that will bolster your career readiness.\n\nBegin building an international network by making connections with coworkers and peers.\n\nAll of our internships are supervised and earn IES Abroad credit.

These cause-driven placements have you working alongside local people toward a common goal, in which you experience firsthand some of the social issues that affect Rome.\n\nA community-based learning experience consists of time spent with a local organization, accompanied by an academic, for-credit seminar. Through the seminar, you have structured time for reflection and discussion as you explore human development, social business, and the need for closer contact between economics and ethics.\n\nPlacement examples include development and Microfinance, education, environment and food policies, human rights, immigration, public health, social inclusion.\n\nProgram Cost\n\nConsider these prices as a starting point.
