        "text": "The Roman Empire: From Ancient Glory to Modern Fascination\n\nby Christina Hilburger on in History, News & Current Events, World Languages and Cultures | 0 Comments\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of social media trends, TikTok has proven itself as a platform capable of sparking conversations about some of the most unexpected topics. One such trend that took the internet by storm recently was a question posed to men: \"How often do you think about the Roman Empire?\" See this short news article, \"Why is everyone talking about the Roman Empire? Inside the TikTok trend that's become a surprising litmus test.\" The responses were surprising, with some individuals admitting to thinking about the fallen empire daily or even more frequently. But why would anyone in 2023 be preoccupied with an ancient civilization that thrived over two millennia ago? We posed this question to folks visiting Reed Library and have received some entertaining responses:\n\nLet's explore the enduring influence of the Roman Empire and why it continues to capture the imagination of people around the world, with insights drawn from resources available at Reed Library.\n\nThe Roman Empire: A Brief Overview\n\nThe Roman Empire, which spanned from 27 BC to 476 AD, holds a remarkable place in human history. At its zenith, it covered vast territories across Europe, Africa, and Asia, making it one of the most expansive empires ever known. Its enduring legacy is evident in several aspects of contemporary culture, from architecture and film to literature and politics.\n\nArchitectural Marvels: Explore the architectural wonders of the Roman Empire through books like \"Principles of Roman Architecture\" by Mark Wilson Jones (NA310 .W55 2000) and \"A Companion to Roman Architecture\" by Roger B. Ulrich and Caroline K. Quenemoen, available online through EBook Central. These resources delve into the intricate details of Roman construction and design techniques, shedding light on how they continue to shape modern architecture and culture.\n\nFilm and Television: Hollywood has long been fascinated by the intrigue and drama of ancient Rome. Delve deeper into the development of the myth of ancient Roman history through an insightful article titled, \"Gladiator and the Myths of Rome\" by T.P. Wiseman, published in History Today. This article explores the portrayal of the fall of the Roman Empire in the film \"Gladiator,\" directed by Ridley Scott. It also examines the survival of the city against the battles with Hannibal in 217 and 216 BC, as recounted by the Greek historian Polybius. Moreover, it sheds light on the factors that corrupted the Roman Republic. Discover how ancient Rome is brought to life in unexpected ways through an article titled \"History Meets Fiction in 'Doctor Who,' the Fires of Pompeii'\" by Fiona Hobden. This intriguing article explores the reception of ancient Rome on screen and online through the lens of the popular BBC series 'Doctor Who.'

Written by the Roman historian in 121 AD during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, this 500-page compendium offers an in-depth look at the lives and reigns of these influential leaders. Suetonius, who served as Hadrian's personal secretary, provides valuable historical insights and biographical details, making this work an essential read for those interested in the intricacies of Roman leadership and the power struggles of the time.\n\nPolitical and Legal Systems: Dive into the political and legal legacies of Rome with resources like \"A Dictionary of World History (3 ed.),\" edited by Anne Kerr and Edmund Wright. Published by Oxford University Press, this authoritative reference work offers a comprehensive overview of world history, including key events, figures, and developments that shaped the political and legal systems of various civilizations, including Rome. You can access this invaluable resource online, making it a convenient tool for exploring the historical foundations of modern governance and legal systems.

Season 1, episode 5, Ancient Rome: the mobile society\" by the A&E Television Network. In this episode, viewers are taken on a journey to the heart of the Roman Empire to examine its remarkable civil engineering project—a 53-thousand mile network of highways. Host Michael Guillen invites us to take a chariot ride through ancient Rome, revealing that many of the highway amenities we imagine as modern developments actually date back over 2000 years. It's a fascinating look at a travel network where so little has changed after so many years, highlighting the enduring legacy of Roman engineering and infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis Roman Empire TikTok trend has shed light on a fascinating aspect of our contemporary culture—the enduring fascination with an ancient civilization that continues to shape our world.
