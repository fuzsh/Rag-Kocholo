        "text": "At the local community college where I am a non-tenured faculty member/contract instructor I’ve designed and taught several honor courses. One of the courses I designed and teach every other semester is a course entitled: Film as History. During the course the class views films from different time periods and different historical/cultural topics. For instance, we view the Atomic Café and discuss its view of 1950’s propaganda and its production in the 1980’s. Additionally we view films from the 1950’s such as The Wild One’s (written and produced in the same time period) and its use of slang and view of youth. Points of view of the films are compared, contrasted, and discussed.\n\nThe course also investigates the movies themselves as to what they show in technology of the age, such as phone booths, party lines, even the idea of switchboard operators connecting calls, special times for long distance calls and even the concept of airmail with special paper and envelopes. In fact, when looking at movies from the late 1880’s and 1890’s we discuss just what was filmed and why? The students also notice that in many ways people don’t really change when they are in front of a camera. Those shots of people looking at cameras in the street in the 1920’s would fit right in with the crowd outside NBC’s Today Show crowd in the plaza.\n\nAnother aspect of the course is looking at films that purport to show history. The class views movies such as Birth of a Nation, Braveheart, and Nanook of the North, etc. Each time we tear it apart in what was factual, contrived and just false.\n\nOne film we review is Gladiator. Naturally when looking at any historic-style film we discuss those parts that are purely Hollywood fiction. This concerns conversations that are between two or three individuals or that set-up action of some sort. It also concerns composite characters that show cultural tendencies, or the political sympathies that were active during the time period.\n\nAs a class we look at what are the factual and non-factual/nearly-factual aspects of the movie. Naturally we hit the easy stuff such as the tractor trails in the fields or the fact that Romans didn’t use stirrups Some mistakes were a little more blaring with depictions of the Romans winning against the German or slaves using horses. It should also be doubtful that the Romans used German Shepherds. We look at aspects that tend to be more controversial also that include topics as “thumbs-up/thumps-down” usage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, we look at the major “players” of the film and how accurately they are portrayed. This includes any composite characters. In Gladiator two of the most important composites is Maximus who represents a faction of Rome that had an obligation and respect for duty to the state. The other composite character was the Senator Gracchus who along with Maximus wanted to restore rights to the Senate.\n\nThe historical characters include Marcus Aurelius who was emperor from 161-180 CE. His depiction is fairly historical. He was known as a philosopher and followed Stoic teachings writing The Mediations (167 CE) which discuss his Stoic philosophies and his experiences that taught him about life.[1] Obviously, any conversations between Marcus and Maximus are Hollywood additions for the plot. Lucilla is portrayed fairly historically but Hollywood made numerous additions to the story and left some information out. One example is that of Lucilla’s husband, Lucius Verus, who before his death, was co-ruler with Marcus.\n\nWhen we view the portrayal of Commodus one can only comment that Hollywood toned him down a bit. Even though the movie promotes the concept that his father didn’t want Commodus to inherit the throne, this is false. Marcus gave his son an excellent education and made him a co-emperor with himself. However, when he did become sole-emperor he devalued the money and took little or no interest in running the government. He left the day-to-day operation to his cronies who acted in his name as Chamberlains. He treated the Senate with derision even renaming it to the Commodian Fortunate Senate along with renaming the City of Rome to Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana. Commodus even renamed the months of the year after himself.[2]\n\nMarcus Aurelius was not only a philosopher but was a fiscally responsible too. One example was his limiting of the gladiatorial games. He felt they drained the treasury and was counterproductive to society.[3] Commodus operated oppositely of his father. He brought back the games and expanded them. He gave to the general public and taxed the Senatorial order for these donations and for lavish gladiatorial games he provided. The public saw Commodus as a populace, one of the people. The wars were fewer, the general public was living a little better and the entertainment was plentiful. Overall, they were kept amused as the empire was changing. As for the military, they liked Commodus, they liked the high status he gave them. They were victorious in the skirmishes they were involved with and had no major wars.\n\nOne aspect of Commodus brought out in the movie was his thinking of himself as a gladiator. It’s historically accurate that he would train with them and even fight them, always winning of course. However, unlike his death in the movie he didn’t die in the ring in front of thousands. He was murdered as part of a conspiracy in his bath by his wrestling partner Narcissus.[4]\n\nAs could be imagined after viewing any of the movies class discussions can be pretty lively with many aspects of the movie and the history it’s portraying discussed at length. We would also look into what was culturally occurring at the time of the movies their production. Things such as the world political and financial situations along with the significant world leaders and their policies.\n\nFor example, looking at Gladiator we find that it was written and directed in the 1990’s. The film debuted during 2000 after President Clinton’s dalliances in the White House. The economy was doing well with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in 1999 above 10,000 for the first time.\n\nAll of this information is brought into the discussion and more importantly there is a comparison to current national and world events. A number of parallels were brought up such as gladiatorial games being similar to our modern sports exhibitions. Even to the point that the winning team/individual is often being invited to the White House. There were a number of similarities mentioned between the characters, real and composite, to contemporary politicians. One student at the end of class stated how it reminded them of the differences between Trump and Obama corresponding with the difference between Commodus and Marcus Aurelius. Both in temperament and politics.\n\nAs I thought more about what they had said I found I had to agree. Barack Obama was very similar to Marcus Aurelius. Now Obama was neither a great philosopher nor a great military leader. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence that some of his political prerogatives were misguided and actually detrimental. However, Obama was open minded, valued people uplifting themselves either through higher education or through apprenticeship/training programs and was fiscally responsible taking the nation and indirectly the world out of a sever financial crisis. He was seen by many as a stable thoughtful leader.\n\nCommodus was nothing like his father. He was a self-centered populist. The new sole emperor cared little about taking the business of the empire seriously. He endeared himself to the people amusing them with gladiatorial games and open generosity. We also find he suffered from what is known as narcissism. All the games, gifts, personal exploits and mismanagement drained the treasury and caused financial complications over time.[5]\n\nIn Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Chapter 3) Gibbon tells us \"If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.\" After Commodus there was civil war for four years until a new dynasty (Severan) comes to power. Although the civil war ends there is political turmoil for another thirty-seven years after which the empire, in the west, goes into terminal decline.\n\nAfter looking at current World and US events, the radical ideologies that have begun to resurface in the US, and the response of the president and his administration to the many domestic and foreign situations, one must ask the question: Has the US elected Commodus?\n\n[1] Cook, John Anthony. \"Marcus Aurelius.\" Encyclopædia Britannica.
