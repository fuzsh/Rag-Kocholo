        "text": "HIST 1 examines the development of western civilization, beginning with the ancient world of the Mediterranean, Europe, and Mesopotamia, and continuing through Early Modern Europe, which involves the Reformation, the Counter-Reformation, and the early period of the Age of Exploration. The course is intended to introduce aspects of Ancient, Medieval and Early Modern history that has helped to shape the developments of Western Civilization. The examination of written and visual primary sources, as well as secondary sources, allows this course to examine the political, religious, economic, and cultural development of the western world. The variety of sources used in the course aids the students in learning how to understand and interpret history, and encourages the students to develop a critical method by which to evaluate primary and secondary historical sources.\n\nThis survey examines the history of \"Western\" civilization from the period of Early Modern Europe to the present. The development of social, political, and religious movements in Europe and the development of European colonies around the world had far-reaching, global repercussions. Among the broad developments of this complex period are the creation and collapse of several political and economic global empires, the development of modern nation states, revolutions in technology and industry, and the rise of nationalism, liberalism, socialism, and neoconservatism. The variety of sources used in this course will aid students in learning how to understand and interpret history and in encouraging them to develop a critical method by which to evaluate primary and secondary historical sources and to examine the political, religious, economic, and cultural developments of the \"Western\" world in the Early Modern and Modern periods.\n\nThis honors-level survey examines the history of \"Western\" civilization from the period of Early Modern Europe to the present.

Faculty can structure their particular theme for this course, allowing for the incorporation of a wide range of materials, out of class field trips, examination of popular culture, primary source documents, and/or seminar-style discussions. For example, in recent years this course has been structured around the themes of \"Utopianism in America\" and \"The Life, Times, and Legacies of Abraham Lincoln\". In-depth examinations of such themes in American history offer students the opportunity to work closely with faculty in their area of interest, and to gain an understanding of American historiography and the historical profession.\n\nSurvey of the history and cultures of ancient Mediterranean civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syro-Levant, Anatolia, Greece, and Rome. CAMS (HIST) 5 Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations (3) (GH;IL) This course provides an introduction to the history and cultural traditions of the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. From the origins of cities and the invention of writing, it surveys the intellectual, artistic, and political traditions that laid the foundations for the later civilizations of Europe and western Asia. Students will acquire a basic historical framework for the ancient Mediterranean from the third millennium BCE through the end of antiquity in the first millennium CE. Within this framework cross-cultural relationships of time and ideas will be established among religious texts, epic literatures, and political and legal traditions. In the part of the world where the division between Asia and the East and Europe and the West was born, the course will examine the development of regional and ethnic identities along with the historical development of concepts of the universal nature of humanity. This course is designed to serve as the foundation course for all majors in the department of Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies (CAMS).\n\nIn HIST 6N / METEO 6N, we'll survey how weather and history are integrated throughout time. Moving from past to present, the course will use case studies to navigate historical moments where weather shaped the outcome. Each case study will have a historical, cultural, and meteorological analysis of the event so students gain a deeper understanding of the national or international event and the integration of science and history. Weather has shaped the outcome of major world events. For example, a weather forecast led to the delay of the Allied invasion of Normandy (DDay), record cold weather in Florida led to the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion, General George Washington used fog to conceal the withdrawal of his troops at the Battle of Long Island, and the list goes on. The case studies range from the Revolutionary War through present day, and this period of history has been selected because there are firsthand accounts of the weather and/or recorded weather data for each event. The meteorological study examines the event's atmospheric conditions. How or why did they occur? How did they affect the event? Therefore, students will learn basic meteorology and climatology. They will also analyze weather maps and scientific data. The historical study provides context for the event. What lead to the event? What happened during the event? What are the event's lasting impacts? To better understand the decisions that leaders faced, students will be asked to assess risk and make decisions based on the same weather data or information leaders at the time had. Students will also explain the context, cause, and effects of major historical moments in everyday language to an audience of their peers through discussions and/or projects. The cultural study examines each event from a psychological and sociological point of view. What were the mindsets of the people and cultures involved in the event? How does the event connect to or parallel things in today's society? How would a present day culture react? This study will give students a better understanding of cultural differences in the world and how those cultural differences can alter the course of history. Time in the course is equally split between United States and international topics, and there will be frequent discussion of current events.\n\nAn historical survey of the political, social, and economic development of America from colonial settlement through the Civil War and Reconstruction. This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. HIST 20 provides a historical overview of change over time in North America before 1877 with a focus on the diverse experiences of different groups of Americans. Students will receive an overview of the most important historical developments in America History from the colonial period through Reconstruction, including the history of American slavery, the evolution of American political systems, gender roles, and regional differences, changes in immigration, economic development, and the American Civil War and Reconstruction. While \"knowing the facts\" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or \"order\" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations / arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the diverse histories of the peoples of the United States prior to 1877; (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the domestic, transnational and global political and economic processes that have shaped the lives, labor, institutions and cultures of the United States before 1877; (3) Students will learn how to \"think historically\" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of American history prior to 1877. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Americans prior to 1877. Demonstrate an understanding of the economic, social, and political structures that emerged before 1877 and continue to shape the modern United States.\n\nThis course offers a writing-intensive historical survey of the political, social, and economic development of America from colonial period through the Civil War and Reconstruction, including the history of American slavery, the evolution of American political systems, gender roles, and regional differences, changes in immigration, economic development, and the American Civil War and Reconstruction. HIST 20Y provides a historical overview of change over time in North America before 1877 with a focus on the diverse experiences of different groups of Americans. Students learn how to \"think historically\", interpreting facts drawn from primary and secondary sources with the goal of understanding how historical events in America unfolded as they did. Students will learn how to recognize the relevance of the past to the present, and how to write to learn in ways that help them think about new material and learn to write in a historical genre.\n\nAn historical survey of the American experience from the emergence of urban-industrial society in the late nineteenth century to the present. This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. HIST 21 seeks to introduce students to salient events, developments, and themes of United State history since 1877, including westward expansion and the decline of the Native American, the industrial revolution, urbanization, immigration, Gilded Age culture and politics, the labor movement, imperialism, Progressivism, segregation and African-American response, the women's movement, World War I, the Great Depression and New Deal, World War II, post-war prosperity, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, the disillusionment of the 'Seventies', the Reagan revolution, and America in the post-Cold War era. The social and ideological diversity of the American experience is a prominent theme of HIST 21. Students learn how to \"think historically\", developing their capacity to identify and analyze key themes and issues from the past, critically assess primary sources, and sharpen their skills in marshaling data and concepts, and expressing them cogently in discussions and in writing.\n\nThe Greek world from the earliest Aegean cultures to the death of Alexander the Great and the beginnings of Hellenistic civilization. CAMS 100 / HIST 100 Ancient Greece (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The course presents a survey of ancient Greek history and culture beginning with the Bronze Age palace-states of Crete and Mycenae, examines the emergence of Greek city-states, notably Athens and Sparta, traces their transformation through conflicts among themselves and with the Persian empire, and describes their eventual eclipse by the kingdom of Macedon. Since this course treats the beginnings of historical writing among the Greeks, students learn to evaluate diverse historical texts and their relationship to legend, myth, and poetry. The nature of historical thought itself is emphasized throughout the course. Also emphasized is the debate between the egalitarian Justice of democracy, the sober wisdom of oligarchy, and the overwhelming power of monarchy, as experienced by the Greeks down to the end of the fourth century B.C.E.\n\nHistory of the Roman Republic and Empire from the origins of Rome to the disintegration of the Empire. CAMS 101 / HIST 101 The Roman Republic and Empire (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements and fulfills 3 credits of the General Education-Humanities (GH) requirement. The course provides an introduction to the ancient Roman empire: how that empire came into being, how it evolved, how it came to govern much of the Mediterranean and European world, and how that empire declined. The course demonstrates the social and legal structures employed by a past society to govern an ethnically and religiously diverse population. The course also introduces students to the sources of our knowledge of the past, and illustrates how these sources are to be critically evaluated. This course complements other courses on the ancient Mediterranean world (such as HIST 100 / CAMS 100) and is a prerequisite to more advanced (400-level) courses in ancient Mediterranean history.\n\nMore than perhaps any other set of human afflictions, the phenomena that have gone under the names of \"madness,\" \"insanity,\" \"lunacy,\" and \"mental illness\" have historically provoked a wide variety of often contradictory reactions. Those who have been in the throes of \"madness\" have described experiences ranging from an ecstatic sense of holiness to being beset by undeniable impulses to feelings of unending despair. Observers have sought explanations for the behavior of \"touched\" and \"crazy\" individuals by invoking such things as sin, destiny, heredity, moral degeneracy, upbringing, trauma, fatigue, and body chemistry. Those afflicted have been admired, pitied, mocked, hidden from public view, canonized, imprisoned, restrained, operated on, sterilized, hospitalized, killed, counseled, analyzed, and medicated. Why? This course will examine the ideas that have shaped European and American perceptions of madness, insanity, and mental illness. This course will be an introduction to the modern history of \"madness\" in the Western world. In particular, we will examine the ideas that have shaped European and American perceptions of madness, insanity, and mental illness; the changing experiences of those afflicted; the development of those professions designed to look after those deemed mad, insane, and mentally ill; and the social and cultural assumptions behind treatments, policies, and public opinions.\n\nThis course will track the history of Egypt, the first nation state in the world, covering a time span of over 3,000 years. The investigation of the history will focus primarily on the major players (i.e. the pharaohs themselves) and the political events that shaped their reigns. Its history involves not only the Nile Valley, but also that of the entire northeast African continent and lands of Western Asia. The magnificent ruins and artifacts that have survived offer the student a visual examination of the ancients and will provide illustration to a great extent of the specific time periods and dramatic incidents. The student will also be confronted at every turn by textual sources (in translation) and the archaeological evidence. The latter will be addressed at length with introduction to archaeological expeditions. This will serve to teach the student the contribution of archaeological method and interpretation in the knowledge and understanding of the history of the Near East.\n\nThis course explores the major themes of U.S. Environmental History, examining changes in the American landscape, the development of ideas about nature in the United States, and the history of U.S. environmental activism. Throughout the course, we will be exploring definitions of nature, environment, and environmental history as we investigate the interactions between Americans and their physical worlds. HIST 109 provides an introduction to environmental history as a field of scholarship that examines changing relationships between human beings and the natural world. Environmental history centers on the examination of various questions about such relationships, including exploring how natural forces shape history, how humankind affects nature, and how those ecological changes then reciprocally influence human life. Major themes of the course include: (1) recognizing that American history has a natural context; (2) that relationships between nature and culture change over time; and (3) that knowledge about nature is socially constructed and historically contingent.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to the history of human relationships with nature throughout the world. The human relationship with the natural environment the world of plants, animals, and microbes, of air, water, and land is an important historical subject. History 110 provides a broad, thematic description and analysis of major global trends and shifts, with an emphasis on contemporary issues and problem solving. The most important goal of the course is to provide students with the historical context necessary to construct a thoughtful appreciation of the environmental dilemmas of our time. Ecology has contributed a great deal to historical understanding in terms of specific examples or case studies; however, it has also begun to reconstruct the overall structure of the history that we teach. History 110 seeks to leverage this new paradigm by encouraging students to break down the barriers that often divide the humanities and the sciences. This course utilizes environmental science to demonstrate and explain specific human tendencies. Finally, this course is structured to help students better situate the history of the United States in a more global centered view of both the past and contemporary environmental concerns. Particularly in relation to contemporary environmental issues, History 110 will make clear that many environmental problems are local in neither their construction nor impact. The course will focus on several critical points, including: How has the non-human world shaped the course of human history? What were the environmental impacts of historic changes in the ways humans produced and consumed resources? What ideas shaped the ways different groups of people defined and used specific resources? What role have science and technology played in changing popular attitudes about the human place in the world?\n\nChronological and topical survey of the story of Jewish life in America. We will trace the social, religious, cultural, and political developments in the Jewish community from the Colonial Period to the present. Topics to be covered include immigration, acculturation, ethnicity, gender, politics, and communal and religious innovation. While \"knowing the facts\" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or \"order\" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the relationship between the experiences of members of the American Jewish community and United States history as a whole. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped the American Jewish experience. (3) Students will learn how to \"think historically\" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of American Jewish history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Americans. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped the American Jewish experience and continue to shape the modern United States.\n\nHIST 117 / WMNST 117 provides students with an overview of the most important historical developments in the history of women in the United States, including women's actual experiences as members of a class, a race, and an ethnic community, the progress women have made as individuals, workers, and citizens as well as the opposition they have faced. While ¿knowing the facts¿ is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or ¿order¿ to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of American women. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped the history of women in the United States. (3) Students will learn how to ¿think historically¿ by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of United States women¿s history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of American women. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped the history of American women and continue to shape the modern United States.\n\nModern Jewish history is a complex and fascinating story. Some scholars depicted it as a long period of suffering and isolation that culminated in the Holocaust and only ended with the founding of the state of Israel. In recent decades a more balanced perspective has found wide acceptance. Today scholars highlight Jewish agency and different conditions in the various places Jews settled without downplaying anti-Jewish prejudice and violence. A recurring theme in this course concerns the relationship between individual Jews and Jewish communities, and on a broader level, the perception and treatment of Jews by societies and states. As Jews in Western and Central Europe \"left the Ghetto\" around 1800 and became citizens of states, they redefined their relationship to Jewish communities in strikingly different ways. Some Jewish women and men emerged as agents of change, others resisted change. We will explore Jewish \"responses to modernity,\" ranging from assimilation, Zionism, and socialism to migration. While many Jews in Western Europe and the United States prospered, the lives of Jews (and their neighbors) in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire were shaped by social and economic crisis (albeit not constantly and not everywhere). For the twentieth century the course will concentrate on three major events that had a dramatic impact on Jews, especially in Europe: the First World War and the collapse of the large multiethnic Empires in Eastern Europe, the Holocaust and the founding of the first modern Jewish state, Israel.\n\nThe main goal of this course is to think through and understand major developments, ideas and issues in natural philosophy. \"Natural philosophy\" is the premodern term for science. The term \"science\" began to acquire its modern meanings around 1840. The geographic focus of this course is the Mediterranean region and Europe, but we will also investigate early science in China, the Indian subcontinent, and the Islamic world. The temporal coverage of this course is vast: from about 10,000 years ago to the 19th century. As is common in history courses, it will be essential for us temporarily to set aside modern and contemporary biases and ways of thinking. Our goal is to understand the world as ancient and premodern people did. Issues of religion will constantly make appearances in this course. If you have studied world religions already, that is great, but if not, the books and lectures will provide the essential points as we go along. You should also use Wikipedia or similar reference tools to look up any key term or concept that does not make sense to you, whether with respect to lectures or the books. It is your job to make an active effort to master the material. This course is ideal for anyone pursuing a scientific or technical major, but anyone should benefit from it. We will be exploring some of the most important issues that have shaped our world, key developments in the human capacity for creating knowledge and useful technologies, and, in some cases, innovative solutions to vexing problems. We will also examine some of the ways that social institutions, belief systems, and paradigms (models) have helped both to organize and to constrain human knowledge. If all goes reasonably well, this course will enhance your knowledge and open your mind to hitherto unfamiliar ways of thinking and approaches to problems.\n\nInfectious diseases once thought to be nearly eradicated have seen a resurgence in recent years. The majority of the cases arose from people who deliberately chose not to vaccinate their children against these disease. Even in the twenty-first century the nature of disease and how to prevent it is not merely a matter of science, but an issue laden with cultural, political, and religious concerns. This course charts the history of disease both as a subject of scientific inquiry and a cultural and religious phenomenon. We will begin with early Greek and Egyptian attempts to understand disease as a foreign entity attacking the body and end in the twenty-first century with current ideas surrounding the use of antibiotics, vaccines, and emerging threats throughout the world. Along the way we will discuss the impact of significant epidemics - for example, Bubonic Plague, Syphilis, and Influenza - as well as changing scientific thinking of both how to deal with disease and how to understand the natural world. In tandem with the historical background key scientific ideas necessary for studying disease - including current understanding of the microbial world, microscopy techniques, and modern gene theory - will be presented to the students through classroom instruction and virtual laboratories.\n\nThis course will investigate the development of mathematical thought in multiple Afro-Eurasian cultures from the Bronze Age through the early medieval period, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, India, China, and the Islamic world. Math will be examined as a cultural product, with specific developments contextualized in the generating civilization's history, socio-political structures, economic systems, artistic and literary movements, and prevailing religious and philosophical ideas. Students will investigate the ways in which specific aspects of a culture influenced the development of specific ideas about, approaches to, and techniques regarding number and mathematical processes. Key themes in this respect will be what social forces encourage the development of practical or theoretical mathematics; how a society determines what is truth; the conception of abstract ideas such as zero and negative, infinite, and irrational numbers; the social status of mathematicians and their relationship with political and social authorities; and what social forces hinder the development of practical and/or theoretical mathematics. Students will also consider how the availability of certain mathematical knowledge enabled the development of particular social systems, architectural achievements, and more. Key themes in this respect will be the mathematical needs of specific political systems (such as the accounting involved in imperial administration), legal systems (such as fair division of goods), and religious systems (such as the calculation of accurate systems of time). At the same time, students will draw connections across time periods and cultures by examining the interactions between civilizations and how those interactions influenced the development of mathematics as a human endeavor. Key themes in this respect will be understanding what political, economic, and other forces cause cultures to come into contact or seek out contact; and how the exchange of knowledge shapes both the receiving culture and the study of mathematics as a whole. As part of this course, students will study both specific mathematical ideas (e.g., number systems, deductive reasoning, geometric algebra, and the motivating problems that spurred development) and the specific ancient and medieval cultures named above.\n\nThis course will examine the \"world\" of chocolate throughout human history. First cultivated by the ancient peoples of the Americas and then manufactured by Europeans and Pennsylvanians alike, chocolate has played a privileged role as a luxury good. An interdomain course, \"Chocolate Worlds\" is interdisciplinary, taught by faculty in the departments of Plant Science, Anthropology, and History. As a team we investigate the how diverse societies have differentially interacted with this crop. Rather than be organized chronologically, this course will be divided into course Units, such as the history of cocoa uses and cultivation, cocoa plant science and farming issues, chocolate making and markets, and the state of the global chocolate industry. The course's lectures and assigned readings work in concert equally directed by scientific inquiry and the queries of the social sciences and humanities. Assignments will address real world questions relating to contemporary cocoa cultivation and production, and its role in international development and social justice. As a class we will take field trips to sites such as local chocolate manufacturing facilities and cocoa research sites and laboratories. The learning objectives of this course include students' broad knowledge of cacao production, its history, and ethnical issues surrounding its cultivation in today's global economy. Additionally, students will gain an historical appreciation for the role this crop his played in diverse human societies and a scientific understanding of its genetic structure.\n\nSurvey of the causes and consequences of America's deadliest conflict, the Civil War, from the end of the U.S.-Mexican War in 1848 through the end of Reconstruction in 1877. This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. HIST 130 is a general survey of the American Civil War Era that satisfies the Gen Ed GH requirement. Course content features the causes of the war, the conflict itself, the consequences for the meaning of freedom in the United States, and the continuing relevance of this conflict today. Students will become familiar with American slavery; Northern and Southern social, cultural, political, and economic composition; the military progress of the war; problems on the home front; the struggle for emancipation; and the creation of a new nation based on free labor.\n\nSurvey of the causes and consequences of America's deadliest conflict, the Civil War, from the end of the U.S.-Mexican War in 1848 through the end of Reconstruction in 1877. HIST 130H is an honors course surveying the American Civil War Era that satisfies the Gen Ed GH requirement. Course content features the causes of the war, the conflict itself, the consequences for the meaning of freedom in the United States, and the continuing relevance of this conflict today. Students will become familiar with American slavery; Northern and Southern social, cultural, political, and economic composition; the military progress of the war; problems on the home front; the struggle for emancipation; and the creation of a new nation based on free labor. The honors course will also take time to go further in depth in discussion and analysis of significant trends and topics in the history of the Civil War Era through intensive focus on primary sources in discussion and written assignments.\n\nThis course provides a general introduction to two very different modes of thinking about race and slavery in the United States between the 1770s and the 1860s. The first half of the class will present historians' interpretations of the lives of slaves, the politics of slavery, and the Civil War. The other half of the class is devoted to examining cinematic and artistic treatments of slavery and the Civil War. Overall, the course will focus on the differences and tensions between historians' methods and ways of knowing about and understanding the world, versus the essential truths that artists try to present in film while focusing on the specifics of slavery and the Civil War in the United States. Rather than privileging one way of knowing over the other, the course will focus on the strengths and limits of each. In addition, the course will examine how collective historical memories concerning race, slavery, and the Civil War are created and contested. The first half of the class offers an historical analysis of the history of slavery in the United States between the American Revolution in the 1770s and the American Civil War in the 1860s. The second part of the class will focus on cinematic presentations of slavery and the Civil War. The second part of the course will NOT focus on using historical facts to evaluate a film's fidelity to history as a scholarly discipline. It will instead examine film as art, as a commercial endeavor, and as a cultural product. It will then explore how different filmmakers portray slavery and the Civil War in different genres; how films reflect the period of their production and the personality of their producers; the commercial demands of filmmaking and how that limits subject matter; and how films shape collective historical memories. Students will also learn the basics of film criticism.\n\nThis course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of Latinas and Latinos in the United States. The course includes a historical overview of the major events in the U.S. Southwest, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America that led to the creation of Latina/o communities in this country. Students will examine the formation of racial and class hierarchies within U.S. Latina/o communities; the processes of (international and regional) migration; gendered hierarchies and responses to sexism; and the complexities of U.S. Latina/o identity. HIST 134 provides a survey of the history and cultures of Great Britain and Ireland from 1400 to 1800. The course particularly focuses on the diversity of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish cultures and customs, their influence on early forms of nationalism in the British Isles, and their importance in the formation of the modern British nation-state. The relationships between English and Scottish protestants, the importance of translating the Book of Common Prayer from English to Welsh, and the influence of Irish-born families of English descent on the governance of early modern Ireland were all key elements in the emergence of an empire under the authority of an English dynastic state whose practical control over the territories it claimed to govern often remained quite limited. Through an examination of primary and secondary historical sources. students will consider the dynamism of this process, involving complex interrelationships, rather than the simple supremacy of one ethnic group over another.\n\nThis course examines the complex history of Penn State. The time period covered extends from mid-19th century origins as the Farmers' High School to the highly complex, multi-faceted, modern \"research university\" of the early 21st century. The course will study closely: the conduct, leadership, perspectives, and educational visions of notable presidents, administrators, and faculty (such as George Atherton, Edwin Sparks, Ralph Hetzel, Milton Eisenhower, Eric Walker, Jesse Arnelle, Howard Davidson, Della Durant, Seth Williams among many others); various dimensions of student life (including student protest and the demise of loci parentis); race and gender relations; athletics; and the challenges of university life, research, admissions, co-education and achieving diversity in the post-World War II era. The Penn State experience will be examined in the context of larger historical developments in American higher education, student life and attitudes, and the broad political / economic / social and legal environment. Comparisons will be made to other colleges and universities. Using primary and secondary historical sources, this course pursues a distinctly historical angle; particular emphasis will be placed on chronicling and evaluating change over time and thoughtful consideration of a diversity of voices and perspectives\n\nChronological and topical survey of the history of African Americans from the colonial period to the early twenty-first century. This course covers major themes in African American history including the societies and cultures of Africa, the Middle Passage, the Colonial experience, slavery, abolition, and the quest for freedom, Civil War and emancipation, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Great Migration, African American cultural expressions, WWII and the seeds of Civil Rights, the Freedom Movement, Black politics and White backlash. While \"knowing the facts\" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or \"order\" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the relationship between the experiences of African Americans and United States history as a whole. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped African American history. (3) Students will learn how to \"think historically\" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of African American history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Americans. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped African American history and continue to shape the modern United States.\n\nHIST 153 provides students with an overview of the most important historical developments in the history of America's Native people, including first contact with Europeans, diplomacy and war, assimilation and cultural traditions, military service and the rise of Native casinos. While \"knowing the facts\" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or \"order\" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Native people. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped Native American history. (3) Students will learn how to \"think historically\" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of Native America history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Native peoples. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped the history of Native peoples and continue to shape the modern United States.\n\nHIST157 shows that, without railroads, the United States would not have become the United States. It provides a panoramic view of 200 years, from the earliest rail lines to the current day and shows how the rail industry affected everything, from the economy to daily life. One of the course's central objectives is to demonstrate how these changes were experienced differently by different communities and social groups.. The first half of the course investigates how and why the American rail network was built and how the public and government reacted to the changes it brought. It reviews the financial, geographical, and legal resources needed to build the first rail lines and why they proved to be superior to roads and canals. During and after the Civil War, the building of the transcontinental lines relied heavily on federal aid and the labor of minorities (including African American, Irish, and Chinese). Although many Americans initially embraced the railroad industry, after experiencing improvements in their local economies and lifestyles, many turned against it in the late nineteenth century. Hard economic times turned labor against management, farmers against the industrial centers, nativist Americans against immigrants, and so on. After two decades of protest, the reformers of the Progressive era passed sweeping legislation to regulate the industry. The second half of the course studies how railroads declined during the twentieth century and how government regulations were relaxed. In addition to the challenges of two world wars and The Great Depression, it explores how railroads experienced new economic and technological pressures. These include competition from motor vehicles and airplanes, which led railroads to lose most of their passengers and much of their freight. The change from steam to diesel locomotives brought difficulties for rail communities and rail workers. The course investigates how demands made by labor often served to alienate public opinion. Although streamlined passenger trains briefly regained public enthusiasm, this soon dwindled in the post-WW2 years, as Americans embraced the automobile and the airplane. By the 1970s, railroad troubles were extreme enough to test America's sense of balance between free enterprise and government aid. Despite public criticism, the federal government intervened, to create Amtrak and then Conrail. The final sections of the course investigate how the relaxation of federal regulations led to a partial rail renaissance. It shows how freight service has been a great success but why inter-city passenger service continues to be unattractive to many American citizens and investors.\n\nChronological survey of the History of the FBI since its founding in 1908, focused on the evolution of Federal law enforcement, bureaucracy, the increasing power of the Executive branch, the targeting of various minority groups, civil rights and civil liberties issues, and the growth of a national security role for the federal government over time. In its long history the FBI has intersected with a wide variety of groups and issues, and this reality will further expose students to the histories of African Americans, gays and lesbians, women's groups, Latinos, Native Americans, war protesters, students, various political dissenters, immigrants, targeting of morality, obscenity, and labor organizing. Because the FBI is responsive to both the political and policy interests of presidents and the influences of American society, students will come to appreciate the influences that politics has on bureaucracy and law enforcement, as well as the different social, political, economic, and cultural influences that each historical time period have exerted on the FBI to help shape its priorities and structure.\n\nWhen Thomas Jefferson elevated one pursuit to stand with life and liberty as inalienable rights, he eschewed others. The Declaration of Independence features the pursuit of happiness rather than that of amusements, consumer goods, status, money, or ease. Happiness carried a history of deeper meanings in philosophy and religion. In 1776, \"happiness\" peppered discussions of individualism, rights, civilization, economics, and government, and echoed Ancient Greek dialogues about virtue and civil society. In America, \"happiness\" joined the religious language of salvation, rapture, and joy to define states of grace. By the twentieth century, happiness became suspect as the term frequently represented a superficial type of enjoyment in needless consumption manipulated through marketing. As happiness came to be twined with wealth and goods, so too did it align increasingly with success in all pursuits. Happiness became a form of winning and a status marker whose overt pursuit was as likely to lead to psychological and social problems as to health. We open with ancient philosophers and modern positive psychologists. The pursuit of happiness reached zenith speed in the history of American literature. From transcendentalists, to pragmatists, self-help, children's fantasy, psychoanalysis, or post-modernism, genres fell out of themselves in the pursuit to merely understand happiness. Novels, poems, memoirs, films, popular psychology, medical literature, memes, and blogs addressed happiness from nearly every conceivable angle to explore strategies such as choosing positive thoughts; stilling thoughts; cultivating enriching interests and habits; influencing our moods and emotions; and optimizing strategies for securing the resources, skill-sets, possessions, and relationships that encourage happiness. Some of these achievements aligned with health and economic benefits and introduced limitations in access or cultural relevance. Bio-behaviorists are exploring correlation vs. causation and ways of assessing social and individual well-being. Bringing modern bio-behavioral methodologies into the chronological narrative creates unprecedented opportunities for integrative study. Experiential elements of wellness fulfill goals of General Health and Wellness, identifying \"wellness as a positive state of well-being, not merely the absence of disease.\" Students will learn the most promising research on generating tangible, healthful benefits in individuals and communities and be introduced to sources for further learning, continuing to learn and pursue long-term happiness.\n\nThis course explores Asian histories through film. We will watch and analyze Asian films for the light they cast on numerous problems of modern life and historical interpretation in selected Asian countries: How have Asians depicted their own histories? How have they dealt with war, revolution, and social and cultural change? What have been the effects of major historical events and transitions on individuals, families, societies, and states? Approaching film as documentation, interpretation, commentary, propaganda, nostalgia, vision for the future, and reflection of social norms and problems, we will also consider films as products of specific historical environments: why did certain movies appear when they did? Through this course, students will gain a visual introduction to Asian cultures and societies, explore their histories, and learn to read films as both interpretations and products of history.\n\nThis course will study the history of Brazil, the only Portuguese-speaking nation in Latin America, from the colonial to the present period. We will examine Brazil's transformation from Portuguese colony to the seat of a nineteenth century transcontinental empire ruled by the only European monarch to rule from the Americas, and discuss developments such as plantation slavery and industrialization that transformed Brazil into an international powerhouse. We will examine political, economic, cultural and racial movements and institutions that defined Brazilian history during the empire, the first republic, the Vargas era, and the military dictatorship. We will conclude with a look at Brazil's struggles with democracy from the 1980s to the present as well as the rise of contemporary populist leaders, Brazil's struggles surrounding policing, political corruption, affirmative action, and its hosting international sporting events in the twenty-first century. This course is designed to introduce students to the making of the modern Brazilian state focusing on the period from the rise of the Brazilian Empire in 1808 through the modern day. We will survey major historical trends in Brazilian society, from its roots as a Portuguese colony and its role at the center of slavery and the slave trade in the Americas to its distinctive patterns of independence and nationhood. Brazil's experience as an independent nation during the nineteenth century (it became the only long-term monarchy in the Americas) offers an interesting point of comparison to the history of republican nationhood elsewhere in North and South America. We will also examine the challenges of state and nation building during the nineteenth and early twentieth century as well as the challenges associated with late industrialization and state-sponsored development.\n\nWMNST/HIST 166 History of Sexuality (3) (GH;US)This is a 100-level course on the history of sexuality, spanning several centuries and a wide range of contexts. The study of sexuality offers a particularly good lens for developing students' analytical ability to think historically about something that is often considered both natural and exclusively modern. Topics will include the role of religion, medicine, law, and politics in controlling and shaping sexuality; change and controversy over birth control, abortion, and gender roles; the connections between prescriptive literature and lived experience; the origins and meanings and racial violence in the context of ideas about sexuality; the concept of respectability; and the experiences and conflicts that have shaped the emergence of modern lesbian, gay, and trans identities. Students evaluate large questions about sources, methods, and analysis that historians face, including: How do we recover stories of private life, from societies and eras different from our own? How does our own understanding of what sexuality \"is\" complicate our historical exploration? What can we learn about gender and sexuality, repression and resistance, deviance and acceptance, identity and community from studying persons of nonconforming gender from the past? How has racism been employed to justify particular reproductive and sexual practices, as well as to limit claims to sexual respectability? To what extent is the study of sexuality inherently a study of gender, sex roles, and feminism? While focused primarily on the United States, the course will offer students opportunities to examine these questions in other, transnational contexts.\n\nThis course will introduce students to major themes in the history of ancient and medieval South Asia, a region that is now made up of the nation-states of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Students will gain a firm understanding of the key political, economic and socio-cultural traditions and practices that shaped the formation of diverse social groups, sectarian and religious communities and political institutions in the region. While developing a chronological perspective on the history of pre-modern South Asia, this course will encourage students to look beyond the modern nation-state boundaries in order to gain a firm understanding of the region's shared political and cultural past in the period up to 1500. Students will learn to critically read primary sources and secondary literature, to identify historical arguments and take a position in a scholarly conversation in written assignments.\n\nSurvey of cultural, institutional, and political history from ancient times to the present. HIST 176 Survey of Indian History (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course surveys the history and civilization of India or South Asia from the earliest times to the modern period. The goal of the course is to enable students to form a comprehensive conception of the various facets of Indian or, South Asian civilization in a historical context. This course is an excellent foundation for the history of modern India and also complements a variety of existing courses on the history of the non-western world. In addition to satisfying the GI requirement, HIST 175 satisfies the general credit requirements for the history major or minor, including the 'non-western' component of the major. Non-majors may use this course to satisfy a general education humanities selection. Typically, students will be evaluated on in-class quizzes, written exams, participation in class discussions of assigned readings and critical reviews of books. This course is offered once every year and has an enrollment of 50 students.\n\nThis course looks at Southeast Asia from the rise of early empires to the present. Beginning with the great empires of Southeast Asia this course surveys the rise of Southeast Asian politics, culture and society before examining the colonial period when the region was dominated by European imperial powers, and concluding with the formation of the modern-day nations of Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines. As part of this discussion, issues of Indianization, colonization, life under Japanese during World War II, and the way in which Cold War politics shaped the region. By the end of the course, students should have a firm understanding of changes in Southeast Asia and be able to assess these historical factors that shaped the current societies.\n\nThis course examines the history of Latin America from c. 1450 to 1820, a period encompassing Iberia and the New World before and after the conquest; the course is a survey of three centuries, from the initial encounter on New World soil of Iberian, African, and native cultures and races, to the birth of independent culturally- and racially-mixed nations. Historical topics include the conquest of the New World, the development of colonial institutions and their impact on indigenous cultures, the maintenance of slavery and forced labor systems, the development of multi-ethnic communities, and the origins of independence movements. We will also study colonial-era documents produced by or about the people who lived in colonial Latin America (what historians call primary sources), including Spaniards and Portuguese; African slaves and free blacks; Mayas, Nahuas/Aztecs, and Incas; mixed race peoples called castas; wealthy and poor; and women, men, and children. Particular emphases of the course focus on various patterns of conquest and cultural encounters, the processes of colonial rule, the nature of interaction between social groups, and the cultural impact of the colonial experience upon all colonial Latin America's peoples.\n\nThis course examines the history of modern Latin America from the period of independence in the early nineteenth century until the present day. Students will learn about the geographic and political development of the region, the development of various economic models, and the widespread extraction of labor focusing on This African slavery and Indigenous exploitation. The course examines significant events and historical trends in local, national, regional and global contexts. The goal of this class is for students to think critically and analytically about important issues and themes in Latin America, and to understand how historical events have shaped this region. We will look mostly chronologically at important historical themes such as social, economic, gender, and racial conditions, as well as politics, focusing on events throughout select Latin American nations and regions. The course will focus on the following periods: the Independence and post-Independence period of the Spanish Americas (1810-1850); the period of Brazilian Empire (1808-1889); the integration of Latin America into the modern world economy (1850-1914); the rise of oligarchic and military governments (1914-86); Latin America and the US in the Cold War (1945-1989); and concludes with the recent rise of the Populist New Left and the Conservative Right backlash and violence that has recently threatened many nations of Latin America. This course fulfills the requirements for Bachelor of Arts: Humanities (BA), International Cultures (IL), General Education: Humanities (GH) and fulfills the requirement for Latin American Studies Major and Minor as well as the general credit requirement for the History Major.\n\nHistorical survey of the evolution of warfare in the ancient Mediterranean region from prehistoric times to the Later Roman Empire. CAMS 180 CAMS (HIST) 180 Ancient Warfare (3) (GH;IL) Warfare has occupied a central place in the civilizations of the Mediterranean from the earliest times. The prehistoric origins of warfare is a hotly debated topic and constitutes the starting point for this course. Most scholars are agreed that military culture grew in step with sociopolitical development over the course of the third millennium BCE. In the following centuries, the Egyptians, and later the Assyrians and Persians, took great strides in developing sophisticated tactical systems, using infantry, chariotry, and cavalry. These matters occupy a little over the first third of the course. Across the Aegean Sea, Bronze Age (Mycenaean) Greece was ruled by elites occupying massively walled citadels, their leaders buried surrounded by their weapons. But how did these warriors fight? Do the epic poems of Homer memorialize Bronze Age combat? In the Archaic Period (700-500 BCE) infantry warfare in Greece was transformed by the appearance of the heavily-armored infantryman (the hoplite), deployed in a tight formation (the phalanx). The processes involved in the appearance of this kind of warfare, its nature, and its affects on Greek society and culture will be the focus of our attention for the second third of the course. On the periphery of the Mediterranean basin stood a variety of warrior cultures (the Scythians, Celts, or Germans). Numerous warrior-dominated polities vied with each other in Archaic Italy, but one of them, sitting on a ford of the river Tiber, ultimately rose to be the greatest military power produced by the ancient Mediterranean world: Rome. The Roman legions first won and then ensured the security of a Mediterranean-wide empire that stood for 700 years and evolved ultimately into world's first standing army of professional volunteers. The Roman military system holds our attention for the final third of the course. The course defines warfare broadly to include both tactical and strategic, as well as cultural and ideological, matters. Even this canvas is too vast to be surveyed in all its richness, so the major themes explored are: (i) what is war, where does it come from, and how did it change as civilization spread?; (ii) in what ways did warfare develop in the periods under study, in terms of strategy, tactics, and weapons technology?; (iii) how do different warfare practices reflect essential facets of the various cultures under consideration?\n\nAn historical overview of economy, industrialization, globalization and capitalism in Asia from the 16th century to present. ASIA (HIST) 182 Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Asian economies have experienced spectacular growth in the second half of the 20th century. But this growth is part of a longer story of Asian commerce and trade and its relationship to and integration with (and, in some cases, isolation from) global patterns of exchange. Moreover, these exchanges are best understood alongside the politics, society, and culture--sometimes local, sometimes regional--that shaped trade and business in entrepots, capitals, and hinterlands throughout Asia. This course begins with a historical exploration of the economic development and social change and ends by asking what lies in store for one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economic regions. By offering a historical frame for Asian economic experience , students will gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of prevailing theories that tend to overstate centralized control, market mechanisms, and cultural determination. Asian economies and markets are quite diverse, consisting of emerging and mature markets, making it difficult to view them through a single lens. As a result this course seeks to introduce students to a variety of conceptual frameworks in these countries. Examinations of the major economic players China, India, and Japan form the backbone of the course, but the precise geographic emphasis will vary with instructor, and may also include discussions of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other Asian states. Themes of the course will vary depending on instructor, but may include industrialization, sustainability and the environment, gender and labor, protest and political reform, and consumerism and advertising, among others. The course will also offer a general introduction to economic theories that underpin the concepts of globalization, capitalism, and socialism as they are understood in an Asian context. This course is intended as an introduction to Asia for those with particular interests in Business, Economics, Global Studies, Labor, and/or Government. Through weekly readings, films and class discussion students will be introduced to the development of Asian economies in the global context.\n\nFew places generate as much curiosity, interest, or controversy, in the Western mind than Tibet. This course examines Tibet from a variety of perspectives from Tibet's political unification under a single ruler in the seventh century up to Tibet's incorporation into the People's Republic of China in the latter half of the twentieth century. Adopting a Tibet-centered focus, this course examines three core dimensions of Tibet namely its people, its religion and its strong sense of place to allow for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of Tibet to emerge. No background or specialized knowledge about Tibet is expected though a willingness to read primary documents on a variety of religious, ethnic and political themes will be quite useful. In this course students can expect to gain an appreciation for how religion, history and politics contribute to contemporary portrayals of Tibet, Tibetans and their society.\n\nThis course covers the history of modern Iran from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The course examines significant events and historical trends with attention to local, regional, and global contexts, and examines causes and consequences of policies, protests, and revolutions from a variety of sources and perspectives. Through class lectures and discussions, and reading and written assignments, students will learn important terms, concepts, contexts, individuals, and events. They will learn to identify and analyze trends and patterns in Iran¿s history, make meaningful comparisons, locate specific events in meaningful context, and explain their significance. By the end of the course students will be able to explain current events in terms of Iran¿s long history of revolution as well as in terms of the more immediate history of the Islamic republic. Students will be able to discuss how the modern history of Iran is an example of larger historical trends of the twentieth century.\n\nJerusalem, a city sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, is often depicted as the spiritual and physical center of the world. Throughout its 5000-year history, Jerusalem has attracted diverse cultures, empires, and peoples who have vied for control of this city that is both religiously significant and a very ordinary site of urban life. Jerusalem: Sacred and Profane surveys the archaeological, religious, cultural, political, social, and historical record of Jerusalem in the ancient, medieval, and modern periods. We will explore a series of themes in the city¿s history: the built urban environment, political power in and over the city, sacred sites and pilgrimage, the everyday experiences of Jerusalemites, the changing cultural meanings of the city across various religious and national traditions, and war, violence, and memory in the urban landscape. The significance of Jerusalem's past, its impact on contemporary society and politics in the modern Middle East, and differing visions for this contested city's future are examined in light of various interpretations of the historical evidence.\n\nThe history and memory of the Holocaust, the Armenian, Cambodian and other forms of genocide are often taught separately in different disciplines. This course will examine them together through the various ways different societies dealt with, experienced and understood these. Using the extensive literature on the history of genocide this course further suggests ways in which these tragic events affected and were entangled by each other's. Specific content will vary according to individual instructor, but topics may include victim cultures, ethnic cleansing, trauma, human rights, dark tourism, memorials, architecture as well as the general impact of these tragedies on global politics, or the way the memories of the tragedies were entangled with the civil rights and other struggles in American and global history.\n\nHIST 203N course considers the role of the supernatural and otherworldly forces in a variety of human societies. The course focuses on narratives of the supernatural/anomalous, as well as the social power that such stories can afford their tellers, who may include poets, writers, filmmakers, journalists, and camp counselors, among many others. Students will read and analyze texts from history, folklore, anthropology, and popular media. A primary tool for describing and understanding the supernatural in human history is ethnography; as such, ethnographic texts dealing with the supernatural will also form an important component of the course, and students will have the opportunity to conduct ethnographic research of their own. In all cases, supernatural beliefs will be considered in their social contexts, rather than as texts divorced from the lives of groups and individuals.\n\nA natural disaster is the result of a natural hazard impinging upon human society. In this course we examine seismicity as a geophysical phenomenon and as a natural hazard that interacts with the built environment and the social structures of human societies. Whenever possible, we approach this subject historically. Among other topics, we examine the history of how earthquakes have been understood as well as the impact of earthquakes and seismicity on the history and development of certain societies. Our specific perspectives include: Earthquakes as understood by modern and contemporary earth science Major conceptions of earthquakes in the past Impacts of seismic hazards on the built environment of past societies Impacts of seismic hazards on politics, economic development and social policies of past societies Seismic hazards, earthquake-related technology, and contemporary societies By examining earthquakes in these ways, the study of earthquakes becomes a vehicle for enhancing skills in analytical reasoning. In particular, this course focusses on applications of modern scientific analysis and the approaches commonly employed in historical investigation. Specific skills addressed in this course include, processing and quantifying information, problem solving using evidence and sound reasoning, and expressing ideas with clarity. Immersion in the study of earthquakes affords an opportunity to think more broadly about how people have dealt with natural disasters in the past and to explore the roles that science, technology, and social policy play in defining and addressing natural hazards in contemporary societies and in the future. Class meetings include lectures, discussions, and in-class activities. We analyze scientific observations that have led to increased understanding of earthquakes, earthquake hazards and risk. We also make extensive use of case studies as concrete examples of different types of earthquakes, the historical evolution of ideas about earthquakes, and the range of social impacts of earthquakes. Reading assignments provide essential background for class sessions.\n\nThe course provides students with basic knowledge on major topics in Palestinian and Israeli societies and cultures with a thematic analysis of these topics. It examines the encounter between Palestinians and Israelis from a perspective that questions our ability to understand them separately and it emphasizes interdependency between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and internal tension within Palestinian and Israeli societies. Some of the major themes under discussion are: the place of religion in defining national identities and boundaries, intra-ethnic divides, competing discourses of citizenship, the fragile status of Palestinian citizens and non-citizens under the Israeli control system, struggles over collective memory, and the place of gender and sexuality in the conflict. The course emphasizes the intersection of politics and culture, demonstrating the political relevance of cultural fields such as music, cinema, and sports.\n\nThis course surveys the institutions and social networks in which European fine arts were created, consumed and critiqued. Beginning with the medieval period and ranging to the early 20th century, the course will examine the variety of communities where public and private often intersected and which sponsored innovations in the arts. Often indexing social movements and political change, such communities include convents and cathedrals, royal academies and courts, coffee houses, salons, and theaters. Artists, performers, patrons, politicians, journalists, and others collaborated and competed in these spaces. Such communities could embody political and economic power, or foster resistance to it. This approach to the history of the arts in western culture puts the focus less on the individual creative genius of great composers, writers, painters, and sculptors, and more on the social exchanges and institutions that sponsored and received their work. Such an approach brings to light particularly the ways in which women played significant roles in the production and reception of culture: as salon hostesses, patronesses, and divas, women often enabled and enacted cultural production. Some examples of particular units of study might include: the German convent of Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), where monophonic chant and allegorical morality plays developed; the Mantuan (Italy) court of Isabella d'Este ,the first lady of the world, (1474-1539) where the roots of the madrigal began and where notable painters found support and sponsorship; the French salons of Mme. Geoffrin (1699-1777) and Mme. de Staël (1766-1817); and the student residences in Madrid where avant-garde writers and artists interacted. Each unit will also consider the relationships between the aesthetic norms and values of a period and the economic and political realities of sponsorship. The course will require that students attend at least one musical performance or concert held on campus during the semester and complete a brief writing project based on that experience. This requirement will encourage students to think about their own university as a contemporary space of cultural sponsorship.\n\nA survey course exploring the emergence and historical evolution of the modern Caribbean. This course will explore the evolution of the Caribbean region from the eve of the arrival of Columbus to the 21st century. It will explore Indigenous societies prior to the arrival of Columbus and the interactions that lead to their destruction and the consolidation of European colonial empires. We will explore the coercive labor systems that emerged in the region including indentureship, Indigenous enslavement, transportation of Europeans, the establishment of African slavery, and the establishment of the plantation system that defined the region until the 20th century using both free and unfree labor to maintain its dominance in these island societies. Themes examined will include revolutions in Haiti and Cuba, the struggle for independence, slavery and racial hierarchy, the rise of U.S. neo-colonialism and hegemonic control in the region, nationalism, tourism, and the economic underdevelopment that defines the Caribbean until today.\n\nThe \"Arab Spring\" of 2011 that spread rapidly across the region and featured movements for democratization, social justice, and minority rights collapsed into authoritarian military rule, struggles over the role of political Islam, sectarian and civil violence, massive refugee flight and urban destruction, and outside intervention. This course places the 21st century Middle Eastern revolutions and their aftermath in a broader historical perspective. What were the political, economic, religious, social, and geopolitical factors that contributed to the outbreak of revolution throughout the region? In which ways were these revolutions new, and in which ways were they extensions of earlier, unresolved struggles? How can we understand the distinct trajectories of revolution and counter-revolution across the region? We will focus on several country case studies framed against their late 19th and 20th century histories. The class integrates extensive interdisciplinary and multi-media sources, including novels and memoirs, movies and songs, websites and twitter feeds.\n\nThrough the medium of film, HIST/JST 260 examines the contemporary and historical transformation of the Middle East from the Ottoman period, through the British and French mandates, and the eventual establishment of the modern nation-states. This course analyzes the political-religious-social tensions of this region, and through film illuminates many of the conflicts in a different light. This course engages in specific film define certain moments in the contemporary history of the Middle East. The films reveal the culture perception of politics, the Arab-Israeli conflict, views on and of religious and ethic minorities, women and gender issues, carious elements of political Islam, and the generational shift in politics and culture. The course will watch, analyze and engage in films (with subtitles) from - among other states - Iran before and after the revolution, Turkey, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, and Tunisia.\n\nThis course will explore the social and cultural history of witches and witchcraft from the late Middle ages in Europe and the U.S. to the present. The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as fictions: figures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and films, fictional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and fiction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do fictions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, and in opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities. The course will be organized chronologically and move back and forth between history, such as the Salem witch trials, and the representations of that history in art, literature and film. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual arts, from the engravings of German Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the gothic paintings of Francisco Goya during the Romantic period, to contemporary artist Louise Bourgeois' monument to those executed as witches in Norway. The course will end with analysis of images of witches in popular culture, movies and television, and with a discussion of the modern representations of the domesticated witch and the femme fatale.\n\nThematic or topical investigation; emphasis on historical criticism and analysis. HIST 302W Undergraduate Seminar (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The principal aim of the course is to assist in training History Majors in writing, analysis, and criticism by pursuing the study of one historical topic in detail. The precise contents of the course may vary in accordance with the teaching and research interests of the instructors. The course is not a conventional lecture course. It is, instead, designed in the seminar format with emphasis on discussion, sequential writing assignments, and further developing the core skills of the historian. Several features reflect its writing intensive designation. The course requires a series of writing exercises (with on-going instructor feedback), attention to relevant methods of research, all leading to the production of a final seminar paper. The final paper should effectively advance a reasoned argument derived from multiple sources (a portion of which must be primary sources when the historical topic permits).\n\nThis course examines different case studies of agriculture, food production, and food availability in diverse settings to show how access to food and its denial intersects with ethnic and nationalist politics, imperial and colonial encounters, and global asymmetries. The course reveals the close association of food to social and cultural identities and to conflicts in a global history framework. Spanning case studies from the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-nineteenth century to the Russian Famine of early twentieth century to the Bengal Famine of mid-twentieth century, the course focuses on disparity in access to food for social classes. It focuses on discrete social classes (landlords, farmers, labor, women), but also on modernizers, agronomists and scientists, on state, and on global diplomacy and developmentalist perspectives in the post-World War II era to show the embeddedness of food production and consumption in social relations and in emergent political economy contexts.\n\nRussia is the largest country on earth. It has had a major influence on world events, especially during the Soviet period. The Soviet period represents the greatest economic experiment ever undertaken. Russia has had a vast imperial experience, and its economy has proven capable of producing nuclear weapons and space exploration. Yet, its economy remains dependent on natural resources. Russia is a literary, nuclear and geopolitical superpower but not an economic superpower. This juxtaposition is unique. The aim of the course is to provide a review of Russian economic history together with main concepts explaining the peculiarities of economic and institutional development of the country. The course combines historical narrative with formal economic analyses. We will utilize both an economics and a history perspective. We will explore the development of the Russian economy in the Tsarist period, the abolition of serfdom and Russian industrialization before the Russian Revolution, and we will explore the economic history of the Soviet period. We will also explore the interaction of economic history with social history. The course will conclude by examining the myriad economic and social difficulties encountered in transitioning from a socialist to capitalist economy.\n\nPublic historians build essential bridges between ordinary citizens and the knowledge and understanding of the past required by any self-governing society. Knowing how time has acted upon a society, how things came to be the way they are, helps individuals and groups move toward where they want that society to go, what they want it to become. This class will lay the groundwork for what is expected of public historians in the many professional settings available to them, which include museums, art galleries, national parks, historical societies, non-profit organizations, park and recreation commissions, historic homes, battlefields, foundations, corporations, government departments, preservation organizations, archives, libraries, living history organizations, tourism councils, convention and visitors' bureaus, and universities. This course allows students to experience of some of these roles and places, and more importantly, to develop a lived sense of how they all can fit together in an individual career. The course does this partly in the classroom and partly through direct engagement with doing public history, well-supported by faculty and classmates. The course invites students to meet public historians and to participate in the public history process - mobilizing accurate history to stimulate emotions that then produce citizen engagement. The heart of public history practice involves sharing authority with audiences and confronting the line between entertainment and education. The first several weeks of the course introduce students to specific elements of practice and examples of public history, followed by an extended public history work project that can be actual and/or virtual. After the completion of the project, students gather to reflect on their practice and develop a deeper theoretical understanding of what they have come to know. Together, the three sections of the course create the capacity, and the motivation, to become active public historians either as professionals or as participants in the communities students will encounter in their own lives.\n\nSurveys the history of anti-Semitism from antiquity through the Middle Ages to the present. HIST (J ST) 409Y (RL ST 407Y) European Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Present (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course analyzes major episodes in the history of anti-Semitism and tries to clarify the motives and dynamics involved. It seeks to understand what these episodes have in common and what is unique in each case--is there a single universal, eternal antisemitism? Or are there rather 'anti-Semitisms' each belonging to a unique historical context? Is there a single continuous line of development in anti-Semitism? What is the relationship of a particular anti-Semitism to the national culture in which it originates?We will be reading the major original texts of anti-Semitism from Roman and ancient writers, through early Christian texts and medieval Christian Blood Libels against the Jews, documents of the Spanish expulsion, Lutheran tracts, Voltaire's essays, German philosophical texts from Kant to Marx, Wagner's racial essays, the Protocols of Zion, and documents of Nazi anti-Semitism by Hitler and Streicher. The major part of the grade will depend on a short research paper which will be presented in various drafts, so that the final version represents the culmination of discussion and constructive criticism and advice. This course is a parallel course to J ST/HIST 416 (Zionist History) and J ST/HIST 118 (Modern Jewish History). This course will count toward the Religious Studies, Jewish Studies, and History majors and minors in the 400-level category.\n\nAlthough sport is popularly considered as a sphere separate from other aspects of social and political dynamics, this course illustrates the contrary reality that both active and passive involvements in competitive sports have taken part in shaping and undermining social structures, political mobilizations, collective identities, patterns of domination, and more. This course takes a global and comparative perspective to follow the processes through which national, racial, ethnic, civic, religious, local, and gender identities have been constructed by sport. Special emphasis is given to: the relation between sports, colonialism, and anti-colonialism; sports as a political battleground for the production of meanings in ethno-national conflicts and colonial contexts; the importance of sport in deeply divided societies; and the implications of sport globalization on various collective identities. Theoretical themes are illustrated through various particular case studies from around the globe, including North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, India, the Middle East, and Papua-New Guinea.\n\nThis course is an in-depth study of the history of the Holocaust in Europe that puts special emphasis on primary sources. HIST 426 / JST 426 Holocaust (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The Holocaust stands out as the most terrible and challenging phenomenon of the 20th Century. Societies and the scholarship struggled for decades to fully grasp how much the Holocaust has questioned widely shared assumptions about modernity and progress. This course pursues the overarching question how the Holocaust could have taken place. Who were the perpetrators, victims and bystanders? How much agency did they have? How was the Holocaust organized? The course will encourage students to critically engage with the Holocaust, and will consider a variety of different kinds of sources and means of representation, including oral testimony, film and fiction, as well as more conventional documentation. After discussing some of the most important studies about the Holocaust and identifying the main historiographical debates, students will look at the origins and the evolution of the \"Final Solution.\" The class will touch on the function of the \"Ghettos,\" the role of the mobile killing units, the extermination camps, and Jewish resistance. The course will also deal with Jewish responses to the Holocaust, notably with attempts to enable Jews to emigrate to safe countries; with efforts to alert the public to the systematic killing after 1940; and the support especially of American Jews for Jewish survivors and DPs. Apart from discussing the historiography, students will work mostly with primary sources. Students are expected to do extensive reading for this class and prepare oral presentations on their respective paper topic. The research paper for this course will be based largely on primary sources. Apart from discussing the historiography, the sessions will concentrate on the interpretation of primary sources: - documents created by the perpetrators, bystanders, and victims; - files relating to postwar trials of perpetrators; - photographs; - representations of objects relating to the Holocaust; - memoirs by survivors; - interviews with survivors and bystanders.\n\nThis course deals with American foreign policy and Black liberation in Africa since 1945. AFAM 431 / HIST 431 Black Liberation and American Foreign Policy (3) (US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Black Liberation and American Foreign Policy in Africa since 1945 presents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of American foreign policy in Africa. Course readings will consist of both secondary and primary sources to explore the evolution of American policy toward the continent over the last half-century, and the meaning of the American engagement with Africa for American politics and society. The course will also examine the reasons that Africa has served as a focus of concern among African Americans both prior to, and, over the period 1945 to the present. Of particular concern will be the ways in which American policy has reflected pressures from African Americans as a constituency in foreign policy. The focus of the course will be student-centered written research and discussion. Students will be required to select topics from the course outline for presentation in class with the instructor serving as the moderator of discussion and guide to relevant research materials. Students will be encouraged to use both primary and secondary sources for their research. Students will be expected to prepare two individual written presentations which will serve as the basis for class discussion (30% of the grade), a book review (10% of the grade), and a research paper of 15 pages (40% of the grade) on a topic drawn from the areas identified in the course outline. The final 20% of the grade will be awarded for participation in class discussion.\n\nAn exploration of the political evolution of the Caribbean Region over the course of the 20th Century. HIST 432 / AFAM 432 Between Nation and Empire: The Caribbean in the 20th Century (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course will explore the political evolution of the Caribbean Region over the course of the 20th century. Its focus will be the ways in which imperial rule and the search for national identity have been the parameters that have shaped Caribbean political history over that period. Students will explore, in written assignments and class presentations, the ways in which the region which has historically been a theatre of confrontation among the major powers in the international system continued to serve that role over the course of the 20th century. The costs that have been borne by the people of the region from these conflicts have been enormous and crippling for several societies, especially Haiti, Cuba, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. Among those costs have also been the continued dependence of these societies upon human migration, limited economic strategies of transformation, increasing levels of poverty, and the emergence of a wide variety of political systems that reflect different historical experiences, demographic diversity, varying levels of political autonomy, and a remarkable level of cultural similarities. Evaluation will be based upon two class presentations; one research paper and class participation. The course will be required for students pursuing the African Diaspora minor and for those seeking to broaden their diversity requirements. It can be used to meet non-Western history requirements in the History major.\n\nAnalysis of women's experience in the Holocaust and exploration of the role of gender in Holocaust Studies. J ST (HIST/WMNST) 439 Women and the Holocaust (3) Most of the early study of the Holocaust focused almost exclusively on the experiences of Jewish men. It was men who wrote the first and most widely read Holocaust memoirs and men who produced the first studies of the Holocaust. The first question motivating this class is thus what we can learn from examining women's experiences. Is it possible that the ghetto, the camp, and the forest look different from women's perspectives? Are there factors we miss when we read primary documents written by only half of the participants in these historical events? Beyond this, however, our exploration will also lead us to look more broadly at gender as a category of analysis. What do we gain by bringing questions of gender to bear on our study of the Holocaust? Are there any ethical concerns that should inform our approach?\n\nJews have been part of Middle Eastern societies for thousands of years. They flourished at times and endured hardships at others, but they have been part of every significant social and cultural transformation of the Middle East. In this class, students will discuss the significant contribution of the Jewish community to the development of various Middle Eastern societies throughout the centuries. Students will critically read and analyze primary sources and secondary literature. We will delve into national historiographies of places such as Morocco, Egypt, and Iran-to name a few-and seek to discover a nuanced narrative of Jewish histories of the region. We will also analyze popular culture products, such as documentaries, television, and literature. The course will follow a chronological and thematic order, and will examine Jewish history in conjunction with global and interregional processes in the Middle East and beyond, such as colonialism, imperialism, nationalism, relations with the West, the formation of the modern nation states of the Middle East, and the Israeli-Arab conflict.\n\nContemporary economic, social, and political aspects of the United States and its role as a world power since 1945. AMST 447 / HIST 447 Recent American History (3)This course covers the history of the United States from the end of World War II to the present. Topics include but are not limited to the Marshall Plan, the Cold War, the Korean War, the rise of television, atomic power, the Eisenhower presidency, the Civil Rights and Women's Movements, the Vietnam War and protests, the space race, Watergate, the Reagan presidency, the two Iraq Wars, the Dot-com revolution, 9-11 and the War on Terror, and the Obama presidency. While addressing major historical movements, the course will also explore the culture of the period - art, literature, music, sports, television, religion, and film. Even though the course covers a relatively short span of years, students will see that American society has undergone dramatic changes in this period as the result of social movements, immigration, wars, political scandal, and technological innovation. The course will close by speculating on the current direction of the United States in light of the serious challenges the nation faces.\n\nThe origins and impact of American consumer society since 1870. HIST 451HIST 451 The Consumer Revolution (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This lecture course shows how the United States became a nation of consumers from 1870 to the present. It is designed both for the business and communications student as well as the liberal arts major. The origins of department stores, name-brand goods, fast-food chains, modern advertising, and mass entertainment show us how American business and culture was transformed by the consumer revolution. We will explore how the automobile became the leading consumer good of the 20th century and analyze its impact on how Americans shopped. The rise of advertising and its linkage to home-based mass entertainment through the radio and TV will interest us. We will also consider how events like the Great Depression, World War II, the counter-cultural movement of the 1960s, the energy crisis of the 1970s, and the economic deregulation of the 1980s and 90s shaped consumer attitudes and advertising. \" The Consumer Revolution\" also briefly explains how American consumer culture has been globalized (with companies like Coca Cola, Disney, and Ford).The course also explores how new consumer goods shaped the experience of childhood, youth, family and home life, and retirement. In particular, we will consider how youth-oriented goods in fashion, foods, and entertainment created a unique youth consumer culture. Also important are the intellectual debates about the meaning and value of consumer society: Is mass consumption the real meaning of American democracy or is it a perversion of it? Are consumer needs unlimited and where does the desire for goods come from? Because consumer society seemed to threaten so many traditional values, we will also analyze movements for restricting consumption. We will consider the origins and impact of Prohibition, dieting and health food crazes, and movements to restrict advertising and sale of goods like cigarettes.In addition to lectures and visual presentations in class, students will read chapters from major studies of the above topics, some of which will be discussed in class. Grades will be based on performance in discussion and essay exams.\n\nThis course introduces the history of epidemics from the 1300s to the present day through historical case studies from across the globe, including examples such as the Black eath; Smallpox; Cholera; Influenza; HIV/AIDS; Zika; and most recently, COVID-19. A central focus of the course examines how epidemic and infectious diseases, and human responses to them, have shaped the world history socially, politically, environmentally, medically, and economically to the present day. The analysis of written and visual primary sources, as well as secondary sources, allows this course to ask and answer questions about the experiences of women, men, and children who witnessed epidemics, treated the sick, lived and died during various epidemic outbreaks, and attempted to understand death and disease from a range of perspectives.\n\nThe history and memory of the Holocaust and Hiroshima and Nagasaki are often taught separately in different disciplines. This course will examine them together through the various ways different societies remembered, understood and commemorated these. Using the extensive literature on the history of memory, this course further suggests ways in"
