        "text": "This semester/year program is a great program for studying in Rome! The American University of Rome (AUR) offers courses across a variety of subject areas, including: Archeology, Arts, Business, Communication, History, International Relations, Italian language, Literature, Marketing, Political Science, Social Science, and more.\n\nYou will enroll in a total of 12-16 semester credits per semester. Courses will be taught by local and international faculty. Classmates are international students, the majority of whom are North American. Internships are available for Academic Year students only. Courses are taught in English (except for Italian language courses). No Italian language experience is required for this program, although if you have not taken Italian language, you are strongly encouraged to choose language as one of your courses on this program. Some courses may require additional fees. Gap students, 18 years old and older, are also eligible for this program.\n\nEnjoy Flexibility with ISA Flex\n\nWe’ve partnered with Arizona State University (ASU) to help you overcome common study abroad challenges by adding an ASU Online course to your ISA program. With more than 2,100 courses to choose from, ISA Flex minimizes academic challenges, like major requirements and limited course options, so you can make the most of your experience abroad. Once you’ve applied, access the Flex form in your ISA Student Portal for more information on how to add this to your program and enroll in the course you need.\n\nFor ISA programs at The American University of Rome, students will stay in shared, fully-furnished student apartments. There are generally only one or two student apartment units per building, and neighboring residents are typically middle-class Italian families who own their apartment. Most ISA apartments have 2-3 bedrooms, a lounge/living room, kitchen and bathroom(s). Bedrooms are typically double-occupancy. Each apartment includes one single bed per student with bed linens. A computer that is connected to the internet via a cable modem is to be shared by all occupants and wifi is provided in all apartments. All apartment units include a washing machine."
