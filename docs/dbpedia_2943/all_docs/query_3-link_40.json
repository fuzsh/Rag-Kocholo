Full contemporary mid-brown calf with early 20th century rebacks (vol. 1 fully renewed at the same time) and replaced endpapers, raised bands, red lettering piece and black numbering piece. Tips worn and exposed, boards edge-worn. Sporadic light foxing throughout. A handful of small closed tears and marginal stains. Vol. 1 has some offsetting from engraved frontispiece portrait to title page as well as heavy foxing to both; first page of preface torn and missing about half; small wax stain on pages 471-4. Vol. 2: both maps present with small marginal tears but no loss. Vol. 3: binder mistakenly placed duplicate of map, \"The western Part of the Roman Empire,\" in previous volume rather than \"The eastern Part...\" map. An attractive set of Gibbons' magnificent history. Item #160730004"
