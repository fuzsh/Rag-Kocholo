        "text": "Lesson 4 – The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\n\n​Hundreds of years of warfare and conquest resulted in the Roman Empire growing larger and larger. By the time of the death of the Emperor Trajan in AD 117, this huge Empire was at its largest. By then it stretched from the modern borders of England and Scotland in the north to the edge of the Sahara desert in the south. From west to east it lay between the Atlantic Ocean and modern Syria. The map below shows the fullest extent of the Roman Empire by A.D. 117.\n\nActivity 1 - Discussion\n\nHistorians like to group ideas together under big headings. The reasons for the growth in the Roman Empire can be divided into political, economic, social and military. Read again through the text above and find examples of reasons which fit under each of the four big headings.\n\nWhy the Empire declined (and more big headings)\n\nReaching the end."
