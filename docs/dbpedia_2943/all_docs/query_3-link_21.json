        "text": "Two of the greatest problems in history\n\nare how to account for the rise of Rome\n\nand how to account for her fall.\n\nWe may come nearer to understanding\n\nthe truth,\n\nif we remember that the fall of Rome,\n\nlike her rise,\n\nhad not one cause, but many.\n\nAnd it was not an event,\n\nbut a process spread over 300 years.\n\nSome nations have not lasted as long\n\nas Rome fell.\n\nIn the year 180 A.D.,\n\nthe Emperor Marcus Aurelius,\n\nwas leading his Roman legions\n\nagainst the Germanic tribes along\n\nthe Danube frontier.\n\nMy lord, Caesar. The omens are bad.\n\nI could not find its heart.\n\nWhen I was a child, Timonides,\n\nI had a secret fear\n\nthat night would come\n\nand would never end.\n\nThat we would live out our lives\n\nin total darkness.\n\nIt was a small fear then.\n\nYet my lord, Caesar,\n\nthe sun always rises,\n\nand will again.\n\nSo you say.\n\nIt is said more people die this moment\n\nwhen night is about to give way to day\n\nthan at any other time.\n\nIt seems to me night whispers:\n\n\"Come away with me... \"\n\n\"to the west, abd sleep forever.\"\n\nWhat has another day to offer you?\n\nWhat has another day to offer you,\n\nTimonides?\n\nWarmth...\n\nLife...\n\nColor...\n\nPeople.\n\nMy lord, Caesar,\n\nThe sun.\n\nAs you predicted.\n\nI congratulate you, Timonides.\n\nTimonides. Livius.\n\nLivius.\n\nHow is Caesar?\n\nWell, in order to answer that question,\n\none must consider three aspects of\n\nthe situation.\n\nOne, our emperor has been\n\nat the wars for 17 years\n\nand lived under\n\nvery difficult conditions.\n\nTwo, no one could ever describe\n\nMarcus Aurelius\n\nas a robust man.\n\nThere's a joke among the soldiers here\n\nabout Timonides.\n\nThey say:\n\nAsk Timonides what day is it,\n\nand he will lecture you\n\non the history of the calendar.\n\nYou are well my lord, Caesar.\n\nIt seems that every governor, every king\n\nin the whole empire\n\nis waiting in the valley below.\n\nI invited them here\n\nfor a particular purpose.\n\nI've also asked my son, Commodus.\n\nYour great friend, Commodus.\n\nTell me of your last campaign\n\nin these barbarian forests.\n\nTwo or three times,\n\nwe thought we had Balimar, their leader,\n\nbut each time he was able to get away.\n\nA few days longer, Caesar,\n\nwe'll bring you his head.\n\nNo, Livius.\n\nplease don't bring me his head.\n\nI wouldn't know what to do with it.\n\nBring him to me alive.\n\nBut he is the heart of the barbarians.\n\nThen bring me\n\nthe heart of the barbarians.\n\nI wish to speak with him.\n\nSpeak with him?\n\nRome has existed for a thousand years,\n\nit is time we find peaceful ways\n\nto live with those\n\nyou call barbarians,\n\nso bring me this Balimar\n\nalive, and quickly.\n\nThere was a rumour that Lucilla was here.\n\nLucilla, Caesar's daughter.\n\nAh yes, Caesar's daughter.\n\nAs the dove fears the eagle,\n\nas the lamb fears the wolf,\n\nso is my heart heavy with fear.\n\nOh, mother Vesta,\n\neternal mother of Rome.\n\nHelp me.\n\nBring back the health of my father.\n\nProtect us from the danger\n\nwhich hangs over the empire.\n\nLet there be peace over all Rome.\n\nLucilla.\n\nLivius.\n\nLucilla...\n\nYou are beautiful.\n\nYou are beautiful...\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt has been so long.\n\nI had forgotten.\n\nWhy didn't you ever try to see me\n\nwhen you were in Rome?\n\nIt seemed you did not\n\nreally want to see anyone.\n\nI thought by living alone away\n\nfrom the world,\n\nI could find peace.\n\nThen I found there is no real peace\n\nin being alone.\n\nThere is only loneliness.\n\nI too have been lonely, Lucilla.\n\nI'm here now, Livius.\n\nAnd if my father's health improves,\n\nand if your duties\n\nas a soldier do not prevent it,\n\nwe may see each other,\n\nif you want to.\n\nI want to.\n\nMithridates, king of Petra.\n\nWelcome, Mithridates. Welcome Petra.\n\nCostobacus, king of the Omnia.\n\nGreetings, Costobacus, king of the Omnia.\n\nServerus, proconsul of Judea.\n\nAfrica.\n\nWelcome...\n\n- Virgilianus, proconsul of Syria.\n\nMarcellus, governor of Egypt, I think.\n\nMarcellus, friend of Caesar.\n\nAnd who would this be, Timonides?\n\nVirgilianus, proconsul of Syria.\n\nMy greatful thanks, Timonides.\n\nVirgilianus, friend of Caesar.\n\nWelcome...\n\nPericles, proconsul of Athens.\n\nPericles of Athens.\n\nRome is honored, Sohamus,\n\nthat Armenia's king is with us.\n\nMy lord, Caesar.\n\nArmenia hopes for\n\neven closer ties to Rome.\n\nPertinax, Britannia.\n\nWelcome, Pertinax.\n\nWelcome, Britannia.\n\nHail Caesar!\n\nHail Caesar! Hail Caesar!\n\nHail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!\n\nHail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!\n\nHail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!\n\nGovernors, consuls,\n\nprinces.\n\nYou have come from the deserts of Egypt,\n\nfrom the mountains of Armenia,\n\nfrom the forests of Gaul,\n\nand the prairies of Spain.\n\nYou do not resemble each other,\n\nnor do you wear the same clothes,\n\nnor sing the same songs,\n\nnor worship the same gods.\n\nYet, like a mighty tree\n\nwith green leaves and black roots,\n\nyou are the unity which is Rome.\n\nLook about you and look at yourselves,\n\nand see the greatness of Rome.\n\nTwo hundred years ago\n\nthe Gauls were our fiercest enemies.\n\nNow we greet them as friends.\n\nIn the whole world,\n\nonly two small frontiers\n\nare still hostile to us.\n\nOne here in the north which separates us\n\nfrom those who are called barbarians.\n\nThe other in the east, Persia.\n\nOnly on these two borders will you find\n\nWalls, palisades,\n\nForts, and hatred.\n\nBut these are not\n\nthe frontiers Rome wants.\n\nRome wants and needs human frontiers.\n\nWe've had to fight long wars.\n\nYour burdens have been great.\n\nBut we come now to the\n\nend of the road.\n\nHere,\n\nwithin our reach,\n\ngolden centuries of peace.\n\nA true Pax Romana.\n\nWherever you live,\n\nwhatever the color of your skin.\n\nwhen peace is achieved,\n\nit will bring to all,\n\nAll!\n\nthe supreme rights of Roman citizenship.\n\nMy lord, Caesar. Are you ill?\n\nA small pain in my side. It will pass.\n\nNo longer provinces, or colonies\n\nbut Rome,\n\nRome everywhere.\n\nA family of equal nations.\n\nThat is what lies ahead.\n\nMay the Gods hasten the day.\n\nLucilla,\n\nEach time I see you\n\nI wonder how it is possible,\n\nI've fathered something so beautiful.\n\nYou make it hard for me\n\nto take leave of this life.\n\nFather,\n\nyou have a long life ahead of you.\n\nDeath is in the order of things.\n\nDidn't they teach you that at school?\n\nI will not let you leave me.\n\nIs there a choice?\n\nSoon this trickle of blood,\n\nthese few bones,\n\nthis net woven of nerves\n\nand arteries will be dust.\n\nNo choice.\n\nNow that I'm here.\n\nI will see that\n\nyou take better care of yourself.\n\nEven so,\n\ntime is short.\n\nAnd there is a decision\n\nwhich I can no longer delay.\n\nI must sacrifice the love of my son.\n\nCommodus must never be my heir.\n\nLivius,\n\nIt is my wish that you should succeed me.\n\nAnd I intend to present you\n\nto the leaders of the empire,\n\nopenly, as my successor.\n\nBut,\n\nyou said yourself, Caesar.\n\nIt needs someone who will change,\n\nwho will find new ways.\n\nA man of the tenth century of Rome.\n\nI know only the ways of war.\n\nI would not know how to make allies\n\nout of the barbarians.\n\nYou will find new ways.\n\nYou have a heart for it, Livius.\n\nBut Commodus already\n\nshares the throne with you.\n\nI had hoped that position and"
