        "text": "They played three shows over two days in the city, according to reports, and then were heading to Madison, Wisconsin, to play at another gig on December 10.\n\nThe plane took off, despite weather warnings, and only four miles from their destination the plane crashed into Lake Monona.\n\nOnly one person survived the crash, musician Ben Cauley, while Otis along with seven others died.\n\nBen explained what happened, saying he was in the water and was unable to save his friends due to his being unable to swim.\n\nAs reported in Eugene Register-Guard at the time, Ben said he heard his bandmate Ronnie Caldwell ‘screaming for help,’ but was unable to reach him.\n\nOf these men, all were under-30 and all of the Bar-Kays band members and Matthew Kelly were teenagers.\n\nJames Brown, a fellow soul and blues singer, claimed to have tried to convince Otis not to fly that night, due to poor visibility, as explored in Geoff Brown’s book Otis Redding: Try a Little Tenderness.\n\nOtis’ body was recovered the following day, on December 11, after the lake was searched, and a funeral took place on December 18.\n\nMore than 4,500 people attended, and Otis was then entombed at his ranch in Round Oak near Macon, Georgia.\n\nOtis was survived by his wife, Zelma, who he had married at the age of 20 when she was only 17."
