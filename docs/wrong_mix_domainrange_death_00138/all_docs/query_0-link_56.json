        "text": "The Grateful Dead added a pair of concerts to its final 50th anniversary Fare Thee Well Tour. Originally three gigs were set at Chicago’s 61,500-capacity Soldier Field over the Fourth of July weekend. Those shows sold out instantly as more than a half-million ticket orders were received.\n\nThe new shows will take place in June 27-28 near the band’s home in San Francisco, at Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, in Santa Clara. Organizers said 65,000 tickets each night were available, but it’s anticipated that these shows also sold out immediately.\n\nAs with the Chicago gigs, the four main surviving Dead members, singer-guitarist Bob Weir, bassist Phil Lesh and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, will be joined by Phish singer-guitarist Trey Anastasio, former Dead singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, who plays in Weir’s band Ratdog and has played in The Grateful Dead’s post-1995 groups The Dead and Furthur.\n\nThe Kinks win big\n\nThe Kinks-inspired West End musical, “Sunny Afternoon,” was the big winner at Britain’s version of Broadway’s Tony Awards, the 39th annual Olivier Awards in London, reports NME. The show picked up four awards, including Best New Musical.\n\nThe production’s stars, John Dagleish and George Macguire, who play The Kinks founding brothers, Ray and Dave Davies, respectively, were awarded Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor awards in the musical category. Davies himself won for Outstanding Achievement in Music for the show’s score, which is comprised of music from The Kinks catalog.\n\nUpon accepting his award, the 70-year-old Davies explained, “Without people, we have no plays, we have no films. People are the source of my material. (So) the next time you are sitting in a park somewhere and you see me looking at you, don’t phone the police. I’m just (thinking about) writing about you.”\n\nNME also reports that the Davies brothers, whose fights over the decades are notorious, have put most of their animosity behind them and have begun to work together on new songs.\n\nJagger and Richards on retirement\n\nThe Rolling Stones braintrust, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both 71, have no plans to retire, each said in separate interviews with Rolling Stone magazine. Both men said they want to record a new Stones album in the near future.\n\nWhen asked about quitting it for a life of ease, Jagger said, “Nah, not (at) the moment. I’m thinking about what the next tour is. I’m planning the next set of tours. So, the answer is, no.”\n\nRichards was asked whether he sees the end of Stones tours. “No, I never think about that. As long as I feel like it and there’s people to listen to it, we’ll do it,” was his reply.\n\nAs for a new Stones album, Jagger said, “It would e very nice to make a new album. I’ve got a lot of new songs … which I would love to record, so let’s hope so.” Richards agreed, “We’re talking about doing some recording after this tour. I’d like to get the boys back in the studio again.”\n\nAs for The Stones’ next tour, the 15-show Zip Code Tour of North America kicks off May 24 at Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres.\n\nTwisted Sister to retire\n\nAfter four decades off and on, heavy metal hair band Twisted Sister is calling it quits.

Some of those years are absolutely gone,” he says. He adds, “I was mad (about the breakup). For 20 years.” He and wife Barbara Bach got sober together in 1988 and have remained that way.\n\nThis weekend, Paul McCartney will induct Ringo into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This will be his second induction as he was first inducted as a member of The Beatles in 1988, their first year of eligibility (artists must wait 25 years after the release of their first records).\n\nIn October, Ringo and his All-Starr Band are hitting the road again on a 21-date tour with possibly more shows to be added.\n\nRecord Store Day\n\nApril 18 is the annual Record Store Day.

I would to (meet with and) talk to the kids; give them some encouragement. It’s a disappointing loss and a bummer all around.”\n\nCountry rocker Billy Ray Cyrus of “Achy Breaky Heart” fame created a sitcom, “Still the King,” that will on CMT in which he’ll play an Elvis impersonator who becomes a minister who preaches at a church outside Nashville.
