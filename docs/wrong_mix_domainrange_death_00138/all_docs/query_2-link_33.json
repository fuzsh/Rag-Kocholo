        "text": "Around a bend in the San Francisco Bay is a tranquil community of bobbing houseboats and wailing seagulls.\n\nThere, more than a half-century ago, an American classic was born.\n\nThe soul singer Otis Redding had come to San Francisco in August of 1967 for a six-night gig at Basin Street West. According to Jonathan Gould, a Redding biographer, the rock promoter Bill Graham offered Redding the use of his houseboat in Sausalito, on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nA country boy at heart, the Georgia-born singer accepted.\n\nWhile relaxing on the boat, Redding is said to have strummed a guitar and come up with these words:\n\nSittin’ in the mornin’ sun\n\nI’ll be sittin’ when the evenin’ come\n\nWatching the ships roll in\n\nAnd then I watch ’em roll away again, yeah\n\nA few months later, with writing help from guitarist Steve Cropper, “(Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay” was recorded during a session in Memphis.\n\nIt turned out to be Redding’s final work. He died a couple weeks later in a plane crash in Madison, Wis., on Dec. 10, 1967. He was 26.\n\nIt was this week in 1968 that “Dock of the Bay” was posthumously released.\n\nThe single was a huge hit and over time became one of the most frequently performed songs of the 20th century. Redding never heard the finished version."
