The plane crashed into Lake Monona several miles from the Madison airport.\n\nOne survivor, Ben Cauley of the Bar-Kays, later reported that he had been asleep until just before the crash. He saw his friend in the band, Phalon Jones, look out the window of the small plane and exclaim “Oh no!” and, before he knew it, he was in a frigid lake holding onto a seat cushion. The following day, the lake was dragged and the bodies of the victims were recovered. A storm in Madison that day was a factor in the crash but the exact cause was never determined.\nFour months after his death at the age of 26, Otis Redding’s “Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay,” the last song he ever recorded, reached the top spot on the pop music charts. It was his first No. 1 hit. \n\n#otisredding #RandB #sittinonthedockofthebay #Music #PlaneCrash #BarKays #soul #soulsinger #the1960s #blackexcellence #soulmusic #kingofsoul #greatestofalltime #singer #songwriter #ivebeenlovingyoutoolong #tooyoungtodie #blackhistory #americanhistory #music\".",
