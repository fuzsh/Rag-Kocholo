        "text": "In terms of \"essential\" I'd say:\n\nThe singles:\n\nThese Arms of Mine\n\nPain in My Heart\n\nMr. Pitiful/That's How Strong My Love Is\n\nI've Been Loving You Too Long\n\nRespect/Ole Man Troube\n\nI Can't Turn You Loose\n\nFa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)\n\nTry a Little Tenderness\n\nTramp\n\nDock of the Bay\n\nHappy Song\n\nHard to Handle\n\nDreams to Remember/Nobody's Fault but Mine\n\nAnd the live albums:\n\nLive in Europe (with the titanic rendition of \"Try a Little Tenderness\")\n\nIn Person at the Whisky a Go Go\n\nThere aren't too many Otis Redding recordings though, so you could just ago all in with the six studio albums he released in his life (including the duet album with Carla Thomas) and the first three posthumous albums -- Dock of the Bay, The Immortal and Love Man. None of the albums is great start to finish in my opinion (the best of 'em to me is the posthumous collection of material from the December 1967 dates, The Immortal Otis Redding, by far my favorite Redding album), but that's the way it was in the '60s with soul music, it wasn't really an albums genre.\n\nOr buy the live albums and the Rhino 4-CD collection Otis! The Definitive Collection, which also will give you pre-Stax stuff, all the essential singles, and lots of great album and live tracks.\n\nI'm not the world's biggest Otis Redding fan. There are quite a few soul acts of the '60s, and soul and gospel singers of the '60s I prefer. I think he kind of had one dimension as a singer -- hard, whether singing uptempo or a ballad. And a set of stock ticks (\"gotta, gotta, gotta\" and \"woo, woo, woo\") that he over relied on. But he had a country quality that he didn't shy away from in an era when an urban and urbane, second-generation-northerner mentality was more the thing in soul music, which was great and I think makes him appeal to lots of contemporary audiences (\"Mr. Pitiful,\" in another arrangement could have been a hit for George Jones). And I think the material he and Steve Cropper were working on at the end of Redding's life was really pushing toward the kind of album-oriented and crossover soul era that he didn't live to see. Also, he had a way of just driving a band and getting them to respond to him and just building energy that was second to none, which is why those live recordings may be the best way to hear him.\n\nRE:\n\nIt's weird how that worked out. I tend to favor that LP too. It wasn't like it was planned out in advance, and yet it somehow turned into a killer album from start to finish, and possibly ending up as his best studio LP.\n\nYeah, it is weird. It almost feels like a modern album in the way that the contemporaneous albums, or a later patchwork posthumous one like Love Man, don't. I suspect that as R&B pushed toward it's album-oriented era at the end of the decade/beginning of the '70s (with Funkadelic, and What's Going On and Stevie Wonder's records), Redding would have been right there with them. And I know I criticized Redding above for always and only going hard, but with this later material -- stuff on this record like \"Think About It\" and \"Champagne and Wine\" -- and of course \"Dock of the Bay\" -- there's the addition of something contemplative and lyrical to the Redding arsenal."
