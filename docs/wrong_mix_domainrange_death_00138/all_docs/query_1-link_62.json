Richardson), and Tommy Allsup (Waylon & Tommy were backup musicians).\n\nThey were to travel on their bus, but it had developed problems with its heater. Disgusted with the cold bus, and because Richardson had developed a fever, they chartered a single-engined aircraft... a Beechcraft Bonanza. There wasn't room for everyone, and Waylon told Richardson \"go ahead, I'll ride the bus\".\n\nAllsup and Valens flipped a coin for the remaining seat, and Valens \"won\".\n\nWaylon & Allsup, thinking they had got the worse deal, got on the bus, along with Dion and the Belmonts.\n\nShortly after takeoff into a snowstorm, the Beech crashed, killing all aboard.\n\nMany know of Waylon Jennings, but Allsup became a producer, working with many big names in music.\n\nNew"
