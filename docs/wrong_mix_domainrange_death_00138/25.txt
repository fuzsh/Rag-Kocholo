Otis Redding III, the son of rock and soul sensation, Otis Redding, passed away on Tuesday due to complications with cancer.

Redding’s death was announced in a statement shared Wednesday by his sister, Karla Redding-Andrews.

“It is with heavy hearts that the family of Otis Redding III confirms that he lost his battle with cancer last evening at Atrium Health Navicent in Macon, Ga. Otis was 59 years old,” she wrote. “Please keep our family in your prayers at this time and please respect our privacy as we consume this huge loss. Arrangements will be announced at a later date.”

Redding III was only three years old when his father died with several band members in a plane crash on Dec. 10, 1967.

Following in his dad’s large footsteps, Redding III, along with brother Dexter and cousin Mark Lockett founded the soul band, The Reddings. The band peaked in the 1980s, releasing a total of six albums, notable for hits such as, “Remote Control,” and “Funkin on the One.” While the group made appearances on the Billboard charts, they were unable to gain the same success as their father.

Redding III later became heavily involved in his family’s charitable foundation, The “Otis Redding Foundation.” In addition to his sister Karla Redding-Andrews, he is survived by sister Demetria Redding and brother Dexter Redding.
