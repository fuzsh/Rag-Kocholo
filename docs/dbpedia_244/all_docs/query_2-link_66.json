        "text": "The Yorkton Public Library will remain located downtown for now, because the building's buyer backed out.\n\nCity council initially approved the sale of the library on June 5. Councillors learned that the sale fell through in a private meeting on Monday, according to a city news release.\n\nThat happened after an environmental study was done as part of the teardown of a building adjacent to the library. The study revealed there were issues stemming from an old SaskPower diesel plant that once operated near the northern parking lot.\n\n\"In light of the environmental issues — which are currently being remediated by SaskPower — at a former site that was knocked down a few months back, the prospective purchaser and the library building is not proceeding with the sale,\" said Yorkton Mayor Mitch Hippsley.\n\nAlthough the sale fell through, Hippsley said the land has never been considered a safety concern or issue for the city, which bought the land about 20 years ago.\n\nThe power plant operated from 1913 to 1960.\n\n\"During that time, the area was pretty heavily contaminated with various hydrocarbons and [polychlorinated biphenyls] and that sort of thing,\" said Joel Cherry, SaskPower spokesperson.\n\nLibrary still suitable for use\n\nCherry said they could not speak to whether the ground contamination could cause health issues, but SaskPower has been working with the Ministry of Environment to remove the contaminated soil.\n\nAbout 11,000 cubic metres of soil — 2,750 square metres at about four metres deep — is expected to be removed from the area.\n\nThe structural integrity of the library building is not affected by the impacted soil — making the building suitable for continued public use, according to the Crown corporation. The library parking lot is also be unaffected.\n\nCherry said SaskPower continued to operate on the site until 2021, which is why remediation efforts are underway now.\n\n\"We had to remove the building, firstly, to get at the ground underneath, and all the soil is removed and it's placed in a specially certified landfill and then testing is done,\" Cherry said.\n\nSaskPower is covering the cost of the remediation, although it's not clear yet what the price tag will be.\n\nDrug issues at current location to be addressed\n\nWhen the city first approved the sale, Hippsley said they wanted to relocate the building because of people using drugs at the central location.\n\nThe decision drew ire from library staff, who argued that violence and drug use in libraries is prevalent nationwide — and moving locations won't solve those issues.\n\nHippsley said the city is gathering more information and data for council to make decisions on how to manage substance use at the location and more officers are visiting it.\n\n\"We haven't determined exactly what we're doing, but I would suspect there will be more security cameras. We'll be looking at some employment perhaps and just taking a whole new holistic look at how we can look at the library and move it forward,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not gone rampant, by no means, but it is a situation we have to deal with,\" he added.\n\nThe city had been considering relocating the library to the Gallagher Centre, which is located on the city's outskirts. Now, the city is calling off the search.\n\nGet the news you need without restrictions. Download our free CBC News App.\n\nHippsley said its likely to stay at its location for the near future."
