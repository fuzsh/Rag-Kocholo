The finish is glossy and should allow for use with erasable markers.\n\nMatte Plastic\n\nMap is printed directly on matte polypropylene stock which provides a more durable product. Please note this is NOT a glossy finish - the page is not appropriate for erasable markers.\n\nCanvas Rolled\n\nPrinted directly on canvas and rolled for shipping. There is approximately 5\" of unprinted border to allow for stretching the canvas print onto a frame. Ideal for large and decorative maps."
