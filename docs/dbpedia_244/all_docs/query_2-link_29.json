        "text": "Yorkton lies two hours northeast of Regina, and not far from the Manitoba border. This prairie town is named after the nearby York Lake, one of three major lakes in the area. Leech Lake is about half an hour's drive from town, and Rousay Lake and the Upper Rousay Bird Sanctuary are just a few minutes by car to the southwest. When planning your stay, the staff at Home Inn & Suites Yorkton will be happy to recommend popular things to do, nearby golf courses, and more. We can't wait to share our hometown with you!\n\nThere isn’t much you can’t find here in Yorkton. The downtown area is home to many fine, independently owned retail shops and major retailers. Yorkton has three major grocery stores open seven days a week and features a farmers’ market on Thursdays and Saturdays at the Parkland Mall, where you will also find more great shopping options.\n\nYorkton boasts two fantastic golf courses - pick one, or try them both! The Deer Park Municipal Golf Course is located just down the street from our hotel (make sure to check out our Stay, Play & Golf package) and features an 18-hole course with par 72, driving range, practicing areas, a pro shop, rentals, and food and beverage service.\n\nThe York Lake Golf and Country Club is located two miles south of Yorkton, just off Highway 10 South. This course also features 18 holes, with a driving range, rentals, and licensed clubhouse.\n\nYorkton is close to four provincial parks that offer access to sport fishing, including Duck Mountain Provincial Park, Good Spirit Lake, and the fishing lakes of the Qu'Appelle Valley. Here you will find an abundance of northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye. Sport hunting opportunities in the Yorkton area include whitetail deer, moose, black bear, and upland birds including partridge, and ducks.\n\nYorkton Bowl Arena has open bowling for all ages, including glow bowling, as well as a licensed facility. Or, hit up one of Yorkton's great parks: Knights of Columbus Park features walking paths, an activity hill, an outdoor rink and tennis courts, as well as a playground and baseball diamond. If things are heating up outside, splash around at Weinmaster Park, a wheelchair-accessible facility with a new play structure and spray park.\n\nA walking tour is a great way to spend the afternoon. A self-guided tour will take you about an hour, and will lead you past 30 private and public buildings that capture the history of Yorkton. Brochures for this tour are available from Tourism Yorkton and City Hall.\n\nIf you are interested in the lives of Yorkton's early pioneers, it may be best to start with their deaths, on the City Cemetery Walking Tour. This 1.5-hour self-guided tour takes you through the city cemetery and all the colourful details of Yorkton's historic community. The walking tour book is available for $3 at Yorkton City Hall, Tourism Yorkton, or the Western Development Museum."
