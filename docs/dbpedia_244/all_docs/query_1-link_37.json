        "text": "REUSCH - It is with sad hearts that we announce that Brent Reusch (husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather) of Yorkton, Saskatchewan passed away Monday, February 20, 2012. Brent was born September 11, 1932, son of Fred and Bertha (Kuhn) Reusch. He is survived by his wife Bernice (of 57 years), their son Garry (Milagros) with his sons, Kristen and Bennett and their daughter Ariana; their daughter Rhonda (Yves) Daigle with their sons Yuri and Maurhy; their daughter Janet (Dennis) Rurak; their son Kirk (Marcie) with their daughter Cynthia (Aaron) Zilke and their grandson Sawyer, their daughter Rochelle and son Spencer. Brent is also survived by his sister Marilyn Shaw of Kingston, Ontario and family, sister-in-law Audrey Reusch of Fergus Falls, Minnesota and family, brother- in-law Alfred Achtymichuk and family of Yorkton and sister-in-law Lenore Stewart and family of Yorkton. He was predeceased by his brother Milton, brother-in-law Robert Shaw, sister-in-law Georgina Achtymichuk, brother-in-law Brent Stewart and new-born grandson Mathew. Brent graduated from the Yorkton Collegiate Institute (YCI) and continued his education with the School of Agriculture for two years at the University of Saskatchewan. Later, he was in sales with Lever Detergents (Unilever International) for some 30 years, with CFIB representing small business for five years, as well as working with his son Garry until he retired. Brent enjoyed a lifetime of summer days spent at Madge Lake with his family. He built a ski boat, as well as a cabin at the lake. As a result, there were many happy times spent waterskiing and swimming, as well as barbeques with family and friends. He arranged for the whole family to enjoy a variety of winter sports. Brent also loved to dance, especially with his beloved Bernice. Brent was a model airplane enthusiast from an early age with a special talent for designing, building and flying unique models. Several of his construction articles were published in hobby magazines. He shared his knowledge of the hobby freely; helping many novice flyers get started and experts to further their skills. Brent competed both locally and internationally throughout his life. This took the family around the world making many friends and lasting memories. Brent was inducted into Canada's Model Airplane Hall of Fame in 2002. Yet even during his interest of airplanes he had an inclination toward spiritual things. He read publications and magazines of the Watchtower Society, went to conventions, and allowed his family to attend the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses. In so doing he proved to be a father that truly cared for the spiritual growth of his family. As time passed, Brent came to see that there was a need for cultivating the interest he had in spiritual things. In his early 70's, he came to understand from the Bible that the Almighty God Jehovah gives real purpose and meaning to life. In October of 2006 he symbolized his dedication to Jehovah God by means of baptism. His new focus in life was to let people know of God's will to transform the earth into a beautiful paradise where there will be no more sickness and death. If Brent was here today, he would encourage all of us to read and study the Bible to learn more about God's purpose for the earth and mankind. Funeral Services were held on Friday, February 24, 2012 from the Yorkton Memorial Gardens Family Centre with Gerry Kreba of the Yorkton Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses officiating. The congregation joined in the singing of â€˜He Will Call'. Interment took place in the Reusch family plot in the Yorkton City Cemetery. Condolences can be sent to the family at www.baileysfuneralhome.com . Cremation and Funeral arrangements entrusted to Bailey's Funeral Home. Service Information Friday, February 24th, 2012 3:00pm, Yorkton Memorial Gardens Family Centre Interment Details Yorkton City Cemetery"
