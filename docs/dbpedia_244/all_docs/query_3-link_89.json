        "text": "Yorkton High School\n\nYorkton, Saskatchewan\n\n1908 1909, Jessie McPhee by door. Teacher W.S. Cram\n\nYorkton is near the Rural Municipality of Orkney No. 244. Yorkton was founded in 1882; became a village July 11, 1894, incorporated as a town on April 16, 1900, and with a population count of 5,000 + people incorporated as a city as of February 1, 1928. The current population is over 15,000 (2011).\n\nMarilynn Cooper and and her husband, Brian D. Gushulak , inherited the photos of her grandmother, Eva (Neiley) Cooper.\n\n\"Eva (Neiley) Cooper completed Normal School in Regina in 1910 and taught at a couple of one room schools in Saskatchewan for two years before moving to Vancouver to attend nursing college.\" This is one of her photos.... \"of her students at Glyndwr School from June 1911.\"\n\nEva Neiley was born in Kings County Nova Scotia in 1891. Her mother died three years later and her father remarried. He left Nova Scotia in 1906 and homesteaded near Saltcoats. Following graduation from Yorkton High School Eva attended Normal School in Regina in 1910 and then taught for approximately two years ( Glyndwr and Clova). Her father passed in 1912 after which she went on to fulfill a dream to become a nurse. Graduating from Vancouver General Hospital\"s nursing college in 1915 she returned to Unity, Saskatchewan where she was matron of the small hospital until she married a local farmer, Samuel Ward Cooper. Eva died in 1977.\n\nBrian D.
