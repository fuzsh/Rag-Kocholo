        "text": "Saskatchewan reported 1,259 sales in October, a year-over-year gain of 11 per cent and nearly 13 per cent above long-term, 10-year trends. Above-average October sales in the province can be attributed to gains in the detached, apartment and townhouse/row-style sectors. Despite year-to-date sales remaining slightly below levels experienced last year, Saskatchewan continues to report sales activity much stronger than the 10-year average.\n\nAs seen in prior months, supply challenges continued to persist across many regions of the province in October. Inventory levels fell by over 15 per cent compared to last year and remain over 30 per cent below the 10-year average. Adjustments to sales and inventory levels, paired with declining new listings, resulted in the province reporting below five months of supply in October, a 23 per cent year-over-year decrease and over 40 per cent below long-term, 10-year averages.\n\n“Higher lending rates continue to impact both demand and new listings in our market, which is likely preventing even stronger October sales numbers,” noted Association CEO, Chris Guérette. “Prospective move-up buyers are facing challenges amid higher interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures, and we’re seeing a trickle-down effect with limited supply growth in the lower price ranges, which remain extremely competitive.”\n\nWith 4.5 months of supply, the province is reporting the tightest conditions heading into November since 2007. Despite tight market conditions, home prices remained relatively stable this month. Saskatchewan reported a benchmark price of $327,300 in October, down from $328,000 in September and up nearly 2 per cent from October 2022.\n\n“Our market continues to demonstrate its resilience, as many have predicted, and we’re once again reporting strong sales despite inventory challenges, inflationary pressures, and higher lending rates,” said Guérette. “Saskatchewan is affordable, we’re growing at the fastest pace in over a century, and we’re well positioned for stable demand in home ownership.”\n\n###\n\nRegional Highlights\n\nApart from the Melville-Yorkton Region, all regions across the province continue to report year-over-year sales activity above long-term, 10-year trends. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis, the Northern Region of the province is the only region not reporting an increase in sales.\n\nWith just over three months of supply reported in October, the Saskatoon-Biggar region continues to experience the tightest conditions in the province, along with the highest year-to-date growth in benchmark price.\n\nPrice Trends\n\nBenchmark prices continued to vary across Saskatchewan communities in October, as Humboldt, Meadow Lake, Melfort, Melville, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, and Saskatoon reported year-over-year price gains. Meanwhile, the cities of Estevan, North Battleford, Regina, Swift Current, Weyburn, and Yorkton reported year-over-year price declines.\n\nDespite some monthly variations, year-to-date price movements have ranged from a decline of over five per cent in North Battleford – to a five per cent gain in Humboldt.\n\nCity of Regina\n\nThe City of Regina reported a record high 312 sales in October, a year-over-year increase of 24 per cent and 29 per cent above long-term, 10-year trends. While the Queen City experienced a year-over-year gain in new listings, record October sales prevented inventory gains, as Regina continues to report inventory levels nearly 30 per cent below the 10-year average.\n\nRegina is once again reporting below three months of supply, and the more affordable segment of the market continues to be extremely competitive. Despite record sales and tight market conditions, Regina reported a benchmark price of $308,500 in October, down slightly from $308,700 in September and 1.2 per cent below October 2022.\n\nCity of Saskatoon\n\nThe City of Saskatoon reported 382 sales in October, a year-over-year gain of 20 per cent and 12 per cent above long-term, 10-year trends. New listings failed to offset a sixth consecutive month of above-average sales, resulting in the lowest October inventory levels reported in the Bridge City since 2007.\n\nWith just over two months of supply in Saskatoon, we see upward pressure on home prices. The benchmark price reached $382,700 in October, up from $381,900 in September and nearly 4 per cent above October 2022. Year-over-year price gains were reported in all property types, ranging from one per cent in semi-detached properties – to an eight per cent increase in townhouse/row-style properties."
