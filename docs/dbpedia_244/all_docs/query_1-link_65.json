According to Stats Canada, a population spike like this hasn’t occurred in decades. 1957 was the last comparable year when Canadians witnessed a population boom of 198,000 people. Since May of 2024, Canada’s population has increased with over 430,000 people.\n\nThe official Statistics Canada website has the live population clock you can watch, to see how our population is accounted for.\n\nThe population clock constantly moves as the minutes go by, accounting for these many factors."
