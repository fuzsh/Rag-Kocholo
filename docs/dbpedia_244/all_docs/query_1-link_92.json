The family resided in Yorkton until 1973 when they built a new house and started a new life on the family farm. Ambrose's whole life was devoted to his love of farming. He started driving tractors at the age of 9. Always available to help anyone, he never refused a neighbour with calving troubles, and would spend hours in his shop welding, building, fixing, servicing and providing basic carpentry for all in need. John Deere equipment held a soft spot for Ambrose but his favorite was a little Allis chore tractor that he used daily. For 30 years he cleared the snow off the road to the highway so JoAnne would not miss work; he also stopped along the way to clear the neighbors' yards and have a cup of tea as well. In 2001, the land was rented out and Ambrose began working for Earl, helping him with seeding, harvesting and building a shop. Ambrose loved to read and watch TV, but visiting on the phone, going for coffee with family and friends were a delight. Collecting coins, toy cars, tractors & trucks were a favorite passion. You have never danced a polka until you danced with Ambrose; he looked forward to Veselka, Grayson Polka Festival & Malinka every year. For many years he dedicated his time to St. Mary's Cultural Centre where he was one of the best meat carvers. After a diagnosis of Cancer in April of 2002, an auction sale was held and Ambrose and JoAnne moved to their retirement home in Yorkton, where he enjoyed the new neighbors even if it was only for a short time.

They spent countless hours exploring the countryside by quad, working together in the yard and enjoying the fellowship of their neighbours. Special thanks to Ron & Karen Mehling - your capacity for caring and giving of yourselves enriched and comforted the last few months of Fred's life.
