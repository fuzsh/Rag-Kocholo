        "text": "This report presents the results of a 2015 survey of community and business leaders on perceptions of changes in the economy, community, and crime and safety over the last two decades. Survey respondents indicated that economic growth had been quite strong over the previous decade and a slight majority expected similarly strong growth in the future. Respondents indicated that migrants were important for growth, and that migrant families integrated well into their communities, but less so for single migrant workers. As increasing migration movements have been empirically tied to increases in property crime, communities have a heightened incentive to better integrate new migrants and to improve awareness of crime prevention methods and initiatives when people move into and out of communities. Respondents believed that the police force had a strong presence in their communities, and that there were as many or more community safety, youth employment, and youth activities available in their communities than in the previous decade. However, the majority of respondents believed that illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, and youth gangs, were problems in their communities. Strong majorities (at or just above 70%) also indicated that property crime and youth crime were problems in their communities, with almost half (45-46%) perceiving that property and youth crime increased over the past decade, and slightly less than half (40%) believing that the extent of property and youth crime over the past decade was similar to that of the previous decade. In general, these results and perceptions are comparable to those reported by other recent surveys on perceptions of the economy, crime and safety. Community leaders have an opportunity to better educate the public on the decline in crime since 2003 and on crime prevention initiatives. The results also hint at the changes occurring over 2014-15, as a result of the drop in oil prices, the downturn in the economy, and the rise in crime rates. The Saskatchewan economy has contracted and crime rates have increased over the two years following the survey. Forecasts suggest that the Saskatchewan economy will begin to grow again in the coming years, and it is hoped that crime rates will return to a trend decline, and that the recent rise in crime rates is only temporary.\n\nThis report is the third preliminary report of a larger research project focusing on the changing economy and demography of Saskatchewan and its impact on crime and policing. The first report presented an overview of economic, demographic, policing, and crime trends over the last two decades in Saskatchewan and its ten major cities, with the additional context of developments in the other Prairie provinces, and in Canada as a whole. The second report provided a review of the literature on the theoretical and empirical determinants of criminal behaviour and crime. This report examines crime patterns in Saskatchewan and investigates their determinants, with a particular focus on demographic and economic influences. Property crime rates rose from the 1960s to 1988 in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and to 1991 in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Afterwards, these rates started a trend decline. However, rates of property crime were subject to two exceptionally large one-period jumps after which property crime rates re-established the trend decline: in 1998 with the shift in reporting from UCR1 to UCR2 methodologies; and in 2003 with other changes in police-reporting practices. Among the economic and demographic factors examined, the estimation results provide evidence that declining property crime rates coincided with: 1. rising real household incomes per capita 2. increasing real per capita alcohol sales 3. declining unemployment rates 4. declining share of youth in the population 5. decreasing population movements, through a. decreases in the immigration rate b. decreases in the inter-provincial in-migration rate c. decreases in the interprovincial out-migration rate The influences of the economic and demographic variables on rates of property crime in Saskatchewan have been found to be empirically important, and yet the results suggest that approximately sixty percent of the decline in the rate of property crime in Saskatchewan from 2003 to 2013 may be attributed to unexplained time trends, and province-specific factors. During this period, economic improvements in Saskatchewan coincided with declines in rates of property crime, but those economic improvements also coincided with increases in population movements which put offsetting upward pressure on the rate of property crime. Rates of violent crime generally rose from the 1960s to the end of the twentieth century in Canada. Rates of violent crime have only recently been in decline, since 2000 in Ontario and Manitoba, since 2003 in Saskatchewan, since 2005 in BC and since 2008 in Alberta. The estimation results suggest that the decreases in the rate of violent crime were associated with: 1. decreases in the unemployment rate 2. decreases in real per capita alcohol sales 3. decreases in international and inter-provincial in-migration 4. increases in inter-provincial out-migration However, changes in the economic and demographic variables available for this study were found to have offsetting effects and overall held very little influence on rates of violent crime in the five western provinces. All of the decline in the rate of violent crime in Saskatchewan from 2003 to 2013 may be attributed to undefined deterministic trends and province-specific factors. In addition, rates of violent crime were influenced by the shift from UCR1 to UCR2 reporting methodologies, with rates jumping by 27% in Saskatchewan, and up to 34% (in British Columbia) in 1998. The crime rates of breaking and entering, motor vehicle theft, fraud, homicide, and of robbery were also examined in this study. The estimation results indicate that changes in four of these crime categories, the exception being motor vehicle theft, were all positively linked with changes in unemployment rates, and that changes in the proportion of youth in the population were positively related to changes in all five of these crime categories. It is important to note, once again, that economic and demographic factors available for this study ultimately had little impact on these crime rates. Strong unexplained forces appear to be driving changes in crime rates. Over a shorter time period, from 1981 to 2011, the following additional relationships were found to hold empirically: 1. Housing price increases were linked to increases in property crime rates and were weakly linked to increases in violent crime rates. 2. Increases in income inequality were weakly linked to increases in violent crime rates. 3. Increases in rates of incarceration were linked to decreases in rates of violent crime. 4. Increases in police officer strength (officers per capita) were contemporaneously linked to decreases in violent crime, but linked to increases in crime rates in the following year. These results (1, 2) suggest that housing price inflation and changes income inequality may affect the impoverished and influence criminal activity. In addition, these results (3, 4) suggest that incarceration may have deterrent and incapacitation effects on criminal activity, and that increasing police strength may serve as an immediate deterrent on crime, but may cause a subsequent increase in crime rates through improved investigation and reporting. Promising avenues for future research to help explain the as yet empirically unidentified forces include the investigation into changes in reporting and recording practices, the evolution of private security, the development and implementation of crime prevention initiatives, and cross-sectional analyses of crime rate variation at the police detachment regional level."
