        "text": "Published:\n\nYorkton, Canada, April 11, 2023 – Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC), a leading global merchant and processor of agricultural goods, announced today the expansion of its canola processing complex in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada, reinforcing its capacity to supply food, feed and energy customers.\n\n“This investment supports the Group’s strategic growth plans by reinforcing core merchandizing activities, in this case with additional capacity to originate and process Canadian canola seeds to provide nourishment for people and livestock. It also positions LDC as a strategic feedstock provider to renewable energy producers and accelerates our contribution to a global energy transition that we are excited to be a part of,” said Michael Gelchie, LDC’s Chief Executive Officer.\n\nLDC has operated its canola processing complex in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada, since 2009, employing approximately 120 people today, in the production of food grade canola oil and feed meal. This industry-leading facility is strategically located in the country’s most productive agricultural zone, where canola is the dominant crop, and benefits from dual rail and good road infrastructure. The enlarged complex will create further operational synergies and enhance canola seed sourcing capabilities.\n\n“This project reflects our long-term commitment to North America as a key market for LDC, both in terms of origination and distribution, and is expected to contribute to continued local economic development,” said Brian Conn, LDC’s Country Manager for Canada.\n\nConstruction of the additional canola crushing line is expected to begin later this year and will more than double the facility’s annual crush capacity to over 2 million metric tons upon completion, reinforcing LDC’s presence in the Canadian crush industry.\n\n###\n\nAbout Louis Dreyfus Company\n\nLouis Dreyfus Company is a leading merchant and processor of agricultural goods, founded in 1851.
