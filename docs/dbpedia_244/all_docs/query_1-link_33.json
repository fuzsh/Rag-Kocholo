Standard of play and rules\n\nBy streamlining the application of Playing Rules for the same age group, athletes, coaches and officials participating in sanctioned western Junior A leagues will gain experience and develop in a similar environment to the WHL.\n\nAll participating western Junior A leagues will adopt the WHL Rule Book, except for Section 1 – Playing Area, Section 3 – Equipment, Rule 34.6 – Television, Rule 38 – Video Goal Judge and Rule 46.14 – Major Penalty.\n\nFighting in the western Junior A leagues will continue to follow the existing Hockey Canada Rule 7.10.\n\nAs part of the pilot, players 18 years of age or older as of December 31 of the current season may choose to wear half-face protection, while those under the age of 18 must continue to wear full-face protection, in line with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Rule 202.\n\n2. Roster composition\n\nTo increase flexibility in the development pathway for 15- and 16-year-old players in Western Canada, a number of changes will be implemented, including:\n\nAll 15-year-old affiliate players will be eligible to play up to 10 games with their WHL Club, the same as 16-year-old affiliate players.\n\nInstead of rostering a maximum of five 15-year-old affiliate players in a season, WHL Clubs will be allowed to name up to nine by January 10.\n\nIf a WHL Club cannot dress a full roster of 20 players for a game, the team will now be eligible to dress two 15-year-old affiliate players.\n\nWHL Clubs will be able to designate one 16-year-old player, who upon being returned to a Junior A, Canadian Sport School Hockey League or U18 team, will be allowed to play up to 15 games in the WHL.\n\nIf one of the four Members participating in the pilot has granted a 12-, 13- or 14-year-old player special status to play in an advanced age category, any such player must be evaluated to ensure they currently meet and are deemed to continue with special player status in their 15-year-old year to qualify and continue to be eligible to play up to 34 games in the WHL.\n\n“This unprecedented collaboration between the WHL, Junior A leagues and the Western Branches is an unmistakably player-first approach and is one that responds in a substantive way to the evolving demands of players and their families,” commented WHL commissioner Dan Near. “Each of these organizations share a common priority – developing players on and off the ice. The Western Hockey League sits atop the development pyramid for elite players in the West and we will always look for ways to enhance our delivery to players and their families.”\n\n“Establishing this pilot project is a very important part of the exciting steps being taken to evolve our junior hockey pathways in Western Canada, and the initiative will provide our players with even more opportunity and flexibility in their development,” said Cameron Hope, chief executive officer of BC Hockey. “We look forward to the coming season and working together with our Junior A leagues, the WHL and Hockey Canada to ensure the sanctioned junior hockey system continues to strengthen and flourish in our Branch and beyond.”\n\n“This collaboration resets the foundation for developmental opportunities for athletes across Western Canada,” stated AJHL commissioner Ryan Bartoshyk. “As a unified group, we can proactively approach the dynamic nature of our game while adapting and evolving over the duration of this initiative and beyond. We are appreciative of the trust placed in our collective hands and thank the Hockey Canada Board and staff for their support.”\n\nThe pilot project will be reviewed on an ongoing basis during the 2024-25 season, and it is anticipated that its scope will expand in future seasons.\n\nTo learn more about Hockey Canada, please visit HockeyCanada.ca, or follow along through social media on Facebook, X and Instagram.\n\nCALGARY, Alberta – Hockey Canada has hired Trevor Murphy as the organization’s vice-president of hockey development, a role that will lead the strategic direction for grassroots hockey development across the country.\n\nBorn and raised in Mount Pearl, NL, Murphy joins Hockey Canada from the 2025 Canada Games Host Society senior leadership team, and previously held progressive executive roles with the St. John’s IceCaps of the American Hockey League and the ECHL’s Newfoundland Growlers, including as the Growlers’ president and alternate governor in his last season.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2008, Murphy led the delivery of hockey development programs in Atlantic Canada as the manager of Hockey Canada’s Regional Centre in Saint John, NB, before working three seasons with the Edmonton Oilers in community and consumer partnerships.\n\n“Throughout his career, Trevor has made significant contributions to hockey as an executive, administrator, official and volunteer coach, and we are extremely fortunate to welcome him as Hockey Canada’s next vice-president of hockey development,” said Pat McLaughlin, chief operating officer and executive vice-president of strategy for Hockey Canada. “Adding Trevor comes at an exciting time for hockey in our country, after the number of registered participants during the 2023-24 season surpassed our pre-COVID-19 totals and for the first time ever, more than 100,000 girls and women laced up their skates in Hockey Canada programs.\n\n“His hiring is another important step to continue advancing our Player Pathways, the Canadian Development Model and further establish Canada as an international leader in hockey development.”\n\nA graduate from Memorial University of Newfoundland, Murphy has received a number of awards for his contributions to sport, including the Queen’s Jubilee Medal for commitment and dedication to the game of hockey, Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador’s Outstanding Service Award and is a provincial and territorial recipient of Baseball Canada’s National Grassroots Coach Award.\n\n“It’s a privilege to be returning to Hockey Canada as the vice-president of hockey development,” Murphy said. “I am excited to work with the tremendous Members, volunteers and staff throughout the country to build upon the foundation that has been created for development programs as we look to take them to new heights and impact all hockey participants in a very positive manner.\n\n“From grassroots to high-performance, development on and off the ice is something that should be a key focus for all leaders in the game and I am excited to get to work in this new role.”\n\nMurphy will join Hockey Canada’s senior leadership team on July 15 and be based in St. John’s, NL.\n\nTo learn more about Hockey Canada, please visit HockeyCanada.ca, or follow along through social media on Facebook, X and Instagram."
