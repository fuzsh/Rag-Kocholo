        "text": "Context 1\n\n... breaking and entering for Canada, Manitoba, and Alberta, also all declined from 1997 to 2002, suddenly rose in 2003, and then continued to decline to 2012. The rate of breaking and entering in Saskatchewan has been converging to that in Manitoba, which is now only seven percent lower than that in Saskatchewan. Rates in Alberta and Canada in 2012 were 499 and 504 respectively, both about thirty-five percent lower than the Saskatchewan rate. These rates are shown in Panel F. The motor vehicle theft crime rate in Saskatchewan grew from 522 thefts per hundred-thousand residents in 1995, to a peak of 799 in 2001, and has since been halved, to 401 in 2012. In comparison, motor vehicle thefts had been much more prevalent in Manitoba up to 2006, when the rate was 1,366 per hundred-thousand, but the province has made major strides combating these thefts, dramatically reducing the rate to 294 in 2012. Alberta also experienced an increasing rate of motor vehicle theft up to 2006, and then a decline thereafter. The trends in these rates are depicted in Panel G. The rate of fraud violations in Saskatchewan has generally declined since the 1990s from 586 violations per hundred-thousand residents in 1995, to 316 in 2012. The rate did experience a temporary upswing from 2000 to 2004, when the rate rose from 414 to 470, and a most recent upswing, from 283 in 2009 to 337 in 2011. This rate is shown along with those for Manitoba, Alberta, and Canada as a whole, in Panel H. Saskatchewan and Alberta have experienced similar rates of fraud, while the rate in Manitoba remained consistently lowest amongst the three Prairie Provinces, and lower than that of the country since 2000. The final major crime category for investigation is drug-related offenses. The rate of these offenses in Saskatchewan rose from under 200 violations per 100,000 residents in the 1990s to 300 during the first decade of the 2000s. In 2010, the rate rose to 366, and then to 509 in 2011, and to 564 in 2012. This recent rise in the rate of drug-related offenses in Saskatchewan is in stark contrast to the stable rates experienced in Manitoba, Alberta and in Canada as a whole, which remained near 300 offenses per 100,000 residents. The rates of drug-related offenses in Manitoba, Alberta and Canada in 2012 were 260, 303, and 314. The rate in Saskatchewan was eighty percent higher than the rate for Canada in 2012. Saskatchewan is in the midst of an economic and population boom. From 2006 to 2012, the population of Saskatchewan grew by 1.6% per year. Median household income grew at an average annual rate of 5.7% from 2005 to 2010. And the prevalence of poverty has fallen, from 17.8% of individuals in low- income households in 2005, to only 11.3% in 2011. Saskatchewan has experienced substantial reductions in rates of violent crime and of property crime since 2003, while economic conditions in the province improved. Police forces have also increased their strength, with a 2.1% average annual growth in the number of police officers, and a 3.4% average annual growth in additional personnel, from 2006 to 2012. Unfortunately, crime rates are still higher than those in Manitoba, and substantially higher than those in Alberta and for the nation as a whole. Saskatchewan has the highest rates of crime of all the Canadian provinces. Its two largest cities, Regina and Saskatoon, had the highest crime severity index rankings of all Canadian census metropolitan areas in 2012. Most recently, since the 2009 world recession, the province is dealing with a dramatic surge in drug-related offenses. Next, we shift our focus to the major cities of the province. Section 4 will present the demographic, economic, policing and crime trends in the ten major cities of Saskatchewan, prior to the examination of possible relationships between crime rates and demographic and economic conditions for the provinces in Section 5. Saskatchewan currently has nine cities with populations in excess of 10,000. Itâs tenth largest city, Lloydminster, had a population of 9,770 in 2011, yet is in a unique situation: Lloydminster is a city with a population of 27,800 as of the 2011 Census, with 18,030 of those residents living on the Alberta side of the city. This report will focus on the ten largest cities in the province of Saskatchewan, and will treat Lloydminster as one of those cities, including information of that cityâs residents from the two neighboring provinces. Those ten cities, and their Saskatchewan population sizes are depicted in 9 . Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population Each of these cities serves as a regional centre, for the agricultural community, for industry, for trade, and for government and community services. For the most part, these major cities are well-dispersed across the southern geographic portion of the province, with the northern-most city, Prince Albert, and the provinceâs largest city, Saskatoon, servicing the sparsely-populated northern half of the province. Figure 10 is a map of the province, with its major cities identified. These cities have different natural resource endowments, demographic and economic pressures, industrial structures, and community advantages. These will be introduced in this preliminary report. Each community also has its own crime and policing pressures. These are also a focus of this report. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police provides policing services to most of the communities in the province. The cities of Lloydminster, North Battleford, Swift Current, and Yorkton are among those that contract their services with the RCMP. Thirteen communities maintain their own police services. They include the major cities of Estevan, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Regina, Saskatoon, and Weyburn. 14 This section introduces each city in order of its population size, starting with Saskatoon, and ending with the border city of Lloydminster. A brief discussion of its location and some of its economic and community strengths is followed by various summary demographic, education, labour market, income, and policing and crime indicators. An emphasis is placed on the period from 1995 to 2012, using data from the 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011 Census surveys, the 2011 National Household Survey, the Uniform Crime Reporting Surveys and the Police Administration Surveys. The summary indicators are also used for intercity comparisons. Saskatoon is the most highly-populated city in the province. It is located in the heart of Saskatchewanâs populated area, 225 km east of Alberta, and 350 km north of the US border. Saskatoon is a major industrial, business, social, and cultural centre for central and northern Saskatchewan. The development of potash, oil and wheat gave rise to its referral as the POW city, with natural resources and agriculture playing key roles in the growth of the city. Potash Co, BHP Billiton, and Cameco all have a major presence in Saskatoon. The technology sector is another strong growth sector, spurred on by Innovation Place and the many businesses that have located there to benefit from relationships with the University of Saskatchewan, the largest research-oriented university in the province. Saskatoon is the key social and cultural centre in the heart of the province, with professional theatre, a symphony orchestra, museums, art galleries, a zoo, parks and convention centres. Saskatoon experienced a major population surge in recent years, growing by 10% from 2006 to 2011, to 222,185 residents, an average annual growth rate of 1.9% over the five-year intercensal period. Population growth was spread across most age groups, but predominantly among young families, and the university-aged cohort (20-24 years), as Saskatoon bristled with educational and employment opportunities for people from the city, from other regions of the province, from outside the province, and from outside the country. This inflow reversed the aging of the population as the median age fell from 35.9 years in 2006 to 35.6 in 2011. In prior intercensal periods, Saskatoon had lost university graduates and young families to other regions and provinces, as they sought careers that were not available within the city. With recent improved prosperity in the province, Saskatoon welcomed many more immigrants into the community as the proportion of immigrants rose from 9.2% in 2006 to 13.8% in 2011, the highest proportion of immigrants of the ten major cities in the province (as shown in Figure 11) . The largest city in the province, with the largest university and other important post-secondary institutions, also had the largest proportion of its working-age population with post-secondary degrees in the province in 2011, at 55.5%, and with the largest proportion of the population holding university degrees, at 24.3%. Of the working-age population, 27.3% had high school diplomas as their highest level of education, while 17.2% had not completed high school by 2011. These are strong improvements over 1996, when 44.0% of the working-age population had post-secondary degrees, and 31.7% had not completed high school. Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 National Household Survey The labour market has strengthened over the years. Employment rates have steadily increased, from 63.5% in 1996, to 65.9% in 2006, and to 67.4% in 2011. Although the employment rate has increased since 2006, labour force growth has been slightly stronger, leading to a slight increase in the unemployment rate, from 5.5% in 2006, to 5.7% in 2011. However, these rates are much better than those in 2001 (7.2%) and 1996 (7.8%) before the recent natural resource boom. Improved employment opportunities have contributed to strong income growth. The median income in 2010 was $33,740 in 2010, growing at an annual average rate of 5.5% since 2005, and at 4.2% since 1996. In real terms, median income grew at an annual average rate of 3.1% since 2005, and at 1.9% since 1995. 15 Many residents have benefitted from improved prosperity. ..."
