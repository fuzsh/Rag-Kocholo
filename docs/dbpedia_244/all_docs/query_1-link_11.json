        "text": "This is a list of the census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada by population, using data from the 2021 Canadian census and the 2016 Canadian census.[1] Each entry is identified as a census metropolitan area (CMA) or a census agglomeration (CA) as defined by Statistics Canada.\n\nA city's metropolitan area in colloquial or administrative terms may be different from its CMA as defined by Statistics Canada, resulting in differing populations. Such is the case with the Greater Toronto Area, where its metro population is notably higher than its CMA population due to its inclusion of the neighbouring Oshawa CMA to the east and the Burlington portion of the neighbouring Hamilton CMA to the west.[2]\n\nIn 2021, 27,465,137 people (71.9% of Canada's population) lived in a CMA, while 4,596,279 (12.0%) lived in a CA.[citation needed]\n\nRecent growth\n\nBetween 2016 and 2021, the five CMAs with the highest percentage growth were located in British Columbia and Southern Ontario. The five CMAs with the lowest percentage growth were in Quebec, Alberta, Northern Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador. There were no CMAs for which negative growth was recorded in the 2021 census. The five CAs that grew the fastest were in British Columbia, Southern Ontario, and Alberta, while the five CAs whose population declined the most were in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Northern British Columbia, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the six fastest-growing CMAs by percentage growth were located in Western Canada, with Alberta's two CMAs, Calgary and Edmonton, leading the country. Saskatoon, Regina, and Lethbridge rounded out the top five in the country and each grew by at least 10%. Of the remaining 30 CMAs, population growth was recorded in all but two of them. Those that experienced population decline were Brantford and Saint John.[3][4][5] Ten of the fifteen fastest-growing CAs in Canada between the two most recent censuses were located in Alberta. The other five were located in British Columbia with two, and Manitoba, Ontario and Yukon each with one.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011, twenty-four CAs experienced population decline. The fifteen CAs that experienced the greatest population decline were located in British Columbia (two), Manitoba (one), New Brunswick (one), Nova Scotia (three), Ontario (four) and Quebec (four). Okotoks experienced the greatest increase while Thompson experienced the greatest decline.[3][4]\n\nList\n\nCanada had 41 CMAs and 111 CAs at the 2021 census. The number of CMAs increased from 35 in 2016 with the promotion of the Nanaimo, Kamloops, Chilliwack, Fredericton, Drummondville and Red Deer CAs.[6] Overall, between promotion to CMA, absorption, and dissolution, the number of CAs decreased by seven. Amos was reinstated as a CA and Ladysmith, Trail and Essa were added as new CAs. The Carleton Place and Arnprior CAs were dissolved as they were added to the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA, the Leamington CA was dissolved as it was added to the Windsor CMA, and the Cold Lake and Bay Roberts CAs were dissolved as their urban population decreased below 10,000. 2016 rankings in the chart below are based on 2021 boundaries and exclude the five CAs dissolved in 2021 but include the four new/reinstated CAs.\n\nCanada had 35 CMAs and 117 CAs at the 2016 census. The number of CMAs increased from 33 in 2011 with the promotion of the Belleville and Lethbridge CAs.[7] The number of CAs increased from 113 through the creation of eight new CAs – Arnprior, Carleton Place, Gander, Nelson, Sainte-Marie, Wasaga Beach, Weyburn and Winkler – the demotion of two CAs – Amos and Temiskaming Shores – and the promotion of Belleville and Lethbridge to CMAs.[7]\n\nToronto (6,202,225)\n\nMontreal (4,291,732)\n\nVancouver (2,642,825)\n\nOttawa (1,488,307)\n\nCalgary (1,481,806)\n\nEdmonton (1,418,118)\n\nRank (2021) Rank (2016) Geographic name Province Type Population Change Land area (km2)[8] Population density (/km2) (2021)[8] (2016)[8] 1 1 Toronto Ontario CMA 6,202,225 5,928,040 +4.63% 5902.75 1,050.7 2 2 Montreal Quebec CMA 4,291,732 4,104,074 +4.57% 4670.10 919.0 3 3 Vancouver British Columbia CMA 2,642,825 2,463,431 +7.28% 2878.93 918.0 4 5 Ottawa–Gatineau Ontario/Quebec CMA 1,488,307 1,371,576 +8.51% 8046.99 185.0 5 4 Calgary Alberta CMA 1,481,806 1,392,609 +6.41% 5098.68 290.6 6 6 Edmonton Alberta CMA 1,418,118 1,321,441 +7.32% 9416.19 150.6 7 7 Quebec City Quebec CMA 839,311 806,406 +4.08% 3499.46 239.8 8 8 Winnipeg Manitoba CMA 834,678 783,099 +6.59% 5285.46 157.9 9 9 Hamilton Ontario CMA 785,184 747,545 +5.04% 1373.15 571.8 10 10 Kitchener–Cambridge–Waterloo Ontario CMA 575,847 523,894 +9.92% 1092.33 527.2 11 11 London Ontario CMA 543,551 494,069 +10.02% 2661.48 204.2 12 12 Halifax Nova Scotia CMA 465,703 426,932 +9.08% 7276.22 64.0 13 13 St. Catharines–Niagara Ontario CMA 433,604 406,074 +6.78% 1397.09 310.4 14 14 Windsor Ontario CMA 422,630 398,718 +6.00% 1803.17 234.4 15 15 Oshawa Ontario CMA 415,311 379,848 +9.34% 903.25 459.8 16 16 Victoria British Columbia CMA 397,237 367,770 +8.01% 695.29 571.3 17 17 Saskatoon Saskatchewan CMA 317,480 295,095 +7.59% 5864.48 54.1 18 18 Regina Saskatchewan CMA 249,217 236,695 +5.29% 4323.66 57.6 19 19 Sherbrooke Quebec CMA 227,398 212,105 +7.21% 1458.10 156.0 20 22 Kelowna British Columbia CMA 222,162 194,892 +13.99% 2902.45 76.5 21 21 Barrie Ontario CMA 212,856 197,059 +8.02% 897.26 237.2 22 20 St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador CMA 212,579 208,418 +2.00% 931.56 228.2 23 23 Abbotsford–Mission British Columbia CMA 195,726 180,518 +8.42% 606.72 322.6 24 26 Kingston Ontario CMA 172,546 161,175 +7.06% 1919.17 89.9 25 24 Greater Sudbury Ontario CMA 170,605 165,958 +2.80% 4187.40 40.7 26 28 Guelph Ontario CMA 165,588 151,984 +8.95% 595.08 278.3 27 25 Saguenay Quebec CMA 161,567 161,520 +0.03% 3133.53 51.6 28 27 Trois-Rivières Quebec CMA 161,489 156,042 +3.49% 1038.64 155.5 29 29 Moncton New Brunswick CMA 157,717 144,810 +8.91% 2562.47 61.5 30 30 Brantford Ontario CMA 144,162 134,203 +7.42% 1074.00 134.2 31 31 Saint John New Brunswick CMA 130,613 126,202 +3.50% 3505.66 37.3 32 32 Peterborough Ontario CMA 128,624 121,721 +5.67% 1508.44 85.3 33 34 Lethbridge Alberta CMA 123,847 117,394 +5.50% 2958.96 41.9 34 33 Thunder Bay Ontario CMA 123,258 121,621 +1.35% 2550.79 48.3 35 35 Nanaimo British Columbia CMA 115,459 104,936 +10.03% 1279.28 90.3 36 36 Kamloops British Columbia CMA 114,142 103,811 +9.95% 5654.08 20.2 37 40 Chilliwack British Columbia CMA 113,767 101,512 +12.07% 1444.02 78.8 38 37 Belleville–Quinte West Ontario CMA 111,184 103,401 +7.53% 1337.50 83.1 39 38 Fredericton New Brunswick CMA 108,610 102,690 +5.76% 6014.66 18.1 40 39 Chatham-Kent Ontario CA 104,316 102,042 +2.23% 2464.52 42.3 41 43 Drummondville Quebec CMA 101,610 97,149 +4.59% 1094.36 92.8 42 41 Red Deer Alberta CMA 100,844 100,418 +0.42% 104.34 966.5 43 42 Cape Breton Nova Scotia CA 98,318 98,722 −0.41% 2457.21 40.0 44 44 Sarnia Ontario CA 97,592 96,151 +1.50% 1117.20 87.4 45 46 Granby Quebec CA 90,833 85,056 +6.79% 494.10 183.8 46 45 Prince George British Columbia CA 89,490 86,622 +3.31% 17650.99 5.1 47 49 Kawartha Lakes Ontario CA 79,247 75,423 +5.07% 3033.66 26.1 48 51 Charlottetown Prince Edward Island CA 78,858 71,821 +9.80% 1112.43 70.9 49 47 Sault Ste.
