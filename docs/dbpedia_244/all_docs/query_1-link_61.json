the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 62.5 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip;\n\n(b) a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 30, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 62.5 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip;\n\n(c) a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 03, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 375 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 60 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and\n\n(d) a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 21, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 375 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 60 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.\n\nPART IIIDescription of the Outer Surface\n\nThe outer surface, shown on Public Works Canada Yorkton Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1876 dated March 7, 1985, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.\n\nPART IVDescription of the Strips\n\nThe strips associated with runways 12-30 and 03-21, as shown on Public Works Canada Yorkton Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1876 dated March 7, 1985, are described as follows:\n\n(a) the strip associated with runway 12-30 is 90 m in width, 45 m on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 156.3 m in length; and\n\n(b) the strip associated with runway 03-21 is 150 m in width, 75 m on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 583 m in length.\n\nPART VDescription of the Transitional Surface\n\nThe transitional surfaces, shown on Public Works Canada Yorkton Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1876 dated March 7, 1985, are described as follows:\n\n(a) the transitional surface associated with runway 12-30, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and\n\n(b) the transitional surface associated with runway 03-21, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.\n\nPART VIDescription of the Lands to Which These Regulations Apply\n\nThe boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Public Works Canada Yorkton Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1876 dated March 7, 1985, is described as follows:\n\nCommencing at the North West corner of the North West Quarter of Section Twenty-eight (28), Township Twenty-six (26), Range Four (4), West of the Second (2nd) Meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan;
