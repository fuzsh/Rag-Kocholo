        "text": "Yorkton is located on the TransCanada Yellowhead Highway, near the eastern border of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Yellowhead crosses four provinces, providing a the most scenic and varied route across western Canada from Winnipeg to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nYorkton is at the cross-roads of three major highways. It is approximately halfway on the TransCanada Yellowhead between the major centres of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and is a convenient point for travellers to take a break for a meal, refreshments, or an overnight stay.\n\nHighway 9 joins northern Saskatchewan with the U.S. cities of Minot and Bismarck, North Dakota and points south.\n\nHighway 10 brings travellers from Regina, Saskatchewan's capital city, and continues east to Dauphin, Manitoba, and the popular Riding Mountain National Park.\n\nThe closest airport with commercial flights is Regina SK, a two-hour drive to the southwest of Yorkton. It is served by scheduled flights from points in Canada operated by Air Canada and WestJet.\n\nCar rentals are available at the Regina Airport, and Tourism Yorkton can help you make arrangements for charter bus or shuttle service from Regina to Yorkton for large groups and conventions.\n\nYorkton Airport is operated by the city of Yorkton and provides facilities for private aircraft. It is an IFR approved airport, located three miles north of the city. Runway 03-21 (SW to NE) is paved and 4,800 feet long. Runway 12-30 (SE to NW) is 3,000 feet with a gravel surface."
