From 2011 to 2016, it grew by 6.3 per cent, higher than the national growth of five per cent.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nBut outside the three largest cities — Saskatoon (up 7.7 per cent), Regina (5.3 per cent) and Prince Albert (5.1 per cent) and a handful of communities near them — the population has stayed static or declined.\n\nAside from Martensville (9.3 per cent) and Warman (12.7), both Saskatoon bedroom communities, growth in Saskatchewan’s other 11 cities trailed the provincial average.\n\nHumboldt did the best among these at 2.8 per cent, but that’s disappointing when you consider the same city grew by 13.6 per cent from 2006 to 2011.\n\nEstevan did the worst with a decline of 5.5 per cent or 632 people, a stunning drop for the southeastern city that expanded by 1,399 people or 13.8 per cent over the previous decade.\n\nNorth Battleford’s population dropped by 3.3 per cent and is home to fewer people than a decade ago.\n\nThe population of Moose Jaw, the province’s fourth largest city, decreased slightly, as did those of Meadow Lake, Melfort, Melville and Yorkton.\n\nWeyburn, Swift Current and Lloydminster registered modest growth below two per cent.\n\nIf you remove Saskatoon, Regina and Prince Albert and the growth they attract, you’ve got a population that’s as stagnant as a slough.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd the growth halos around those cities don’t extend far. Pilot Butte, a Regina bedroom community, exploded by 23.4 per cent. But Balgonie, about 12 kilometres farther from the Queen City, decreased slightly.\n\nShellbrook, about 45 kilometres west of Prince Albert, grew by 4.6 per cent, while Rosthern, about 75 km south, dropped 5.1 per cent.\n\nBoth of those towns are located in Premier Scott Moe’s constituency.\n\nSaskatchewan remains the most rural province west of the Atlantic time zone, but the population in areas classified as rural dropped by nearly two per cent over the last five years.\n\nThe decline in Saskatchewan’s rural population ranks third behind Newfoundland and Labrador and Alberta amid a stable national rural population.\n\nDespite the most provocative name in the province, the village of Climax suffered a drop of nearly 30 per cent to 137 people, who presumably are still satisfied living there.\n\nAbout a third of Saskatchewan’s population still lives in rural areas, but another decline of the magnitude of the last five years will push the rural share below 30 per cent for the first time. From 2011 to 2016, Saskatchewan’s rural population remained stable.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe global shift from rural to urban has been happening in Saskatchewan since its founding, but the trend to larger urban areas is also accelerating.\n\nFamily farms have transformed into factories with fewer owners and fewer people working on them. In 2020, the number of people employed in agriculture in the province declined by 22 per cent to about 30,000.\n\nSaskatchewan is beginning to look like a smaller Alberta, with two large, growing urban areas depleting the population in the rest of the province.\n\nBut urban growth is slowing, too. Saskatoon grew by nearly 11 per cent from 2011 to 2016 and Regina grew by more than 11 per cent. That means Regina’s growth has slowed to half of what it was.\n\nPerhaps those growth rates proved unsustainable or maybe Saskatchewan has reached a tipping point.\n\nRegardless, Moe’s Saskatchewan Party government has made growth a key plank of its appeal.\n\nThe party’s impenetrable political armour since it swept to power in 2007 has been forged by pointing repeatedly and derisively to population drops under the previous NDP government\n\nSaskatchewan’s population undeniably declined under the NDP’s watch from 1991 to 2007, but the province first dropped below one million people during the second term of Grant Devine’s Progressive Conservatives in the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBoasting about a record of population growth now will ring hollow throughout most of an emptier Saskatchewan.\n\nPhil Tank is the digital opinion editor at the Saskatoon StarPhoenix.\n\nptank@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/thinktankSK\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nTank: The NDP is thriving in Western Canada, except in Saskatchewan\n\nTank: Measuring COVID-19 in Saskatoon is now a total (expletive) show\n\nWant to know how we decide what to cover and how editorial decisions are made at the Saskatoon StarPhoenix and Regina Leader-Post?
