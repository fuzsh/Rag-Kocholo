        "text": "Spending three weeks in Saskatchewan, explaining the details of his “District Vibrant Clubs Award” to the board members of 17 Rotary Clubs has not dampened DG Ed’s enthusiasm for his personal plan to award $4000 to one club accumulating the most points doing what vibrant clubs should be doing – to put towards a project of their own choice.\n\nSome clubs were not particularly interested in going through the exercise of gathering information from their members for fundraising activities, attending meetings at other clubs, participating in their own and other club’s projects or activities. Some even thought this was a program initiated by Rotary International.\n\nAlthough it’s based on RI’s “Effective Clubs” and “Vibrant Club” forms, the point system to quantify effectiveness and vibrancy are solely the work of DG Ed (and not of his wife, as one board member suggested). These reluctant clubs did, nevertheless, have at least one board member who could see the benefits to their club of undertaking such an exercise. The key benefit which supportive board members appreciated was the ability to measure, compare and improve their club’s vibrancy from year to year.\n\nThere have also been suggestions made to give more prominence to certain programs in the point count such as participation in the student exchange program, which one board member said adds significantly to a club’s vibrancy.\n\nDG Ed’s presentation to club members provided information about the end game in the eradication of Polio from the face of the earth, and the challenges and strengths of Rotary International as published in a recent study by Siegel and Gale that had been commissioned by RI. This study provided some very interesting results that members appeared to be pleased to hear about.\n\nBesides attending 17 Rotary Board meetings and experiencing the fellowship of 17 regular Rotary Club meetings, (where Paul Harris awards and perfect attendance awards were also presented), DG Ed has also participated in social activities. These included\n\nthe steak barbecue/meeting and tour of Lake Manitou (Camp Easter Seals, the Spa, Danceland and a beautiful sunset over Manitou Lake) with President Al of the Rotary Club of Watrous,\n\nsocializing with the Hillsdens – in their home, at Jack & Keaton’s BBQ and Grill, and for Grace’s 70th birthday party,\n\nattending the play “Forget Me Not” at Regina’s Fringe Festival,\n\ntaking part in a farewell picnic at Wascana Park for the soon to be departing exchange student Maite from Belgium,\n\nvisiting the RCMP Heritage Centre and watching the Tuesday evening Sunset-Retreat Ceremony on the Parade Square at the RCMP Depot,\n\njoining several members of the Regina Eastview Club in experiencing the divine “Coronation Chicken” prepared by President Ann,\n\nattending the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ trouncing of the Hamilton Tiger Cats at Mosaic Stadium (courtesy of President André of the Regina Oskaya club),\n\ntouring Moose Jaw and viewing its many Rotary projects with Assistant Governor Yves and\n\nattending the barbecue/meeting of the Fort Qu’appelle Rotary Club.\n\nIn addition, Regina also provided an “act of God” experience, wherein a hailstorm passing through the eastern side of Regina pounded the DG’s car into a dimpled red mass and required replacement of all the plastic vent covers in his motorhome.\n\nAlthough DG Ed is known (by his family and his own Rotary club) to arrive late at events, he has arrived on time for all the meetings – with two exceptions - and these were as a result of two clubs having changed their meeting location (as far as DG Ed and his “handler” knew).\n\nSeveral things struck DG Ed at the Estevan Rotary Club meeting. One was the way the club exhibited their banners, using folding wood & fabric room separators. The other was a lady who single-handedly set up the meeting room (with tablecloths, cutlery in napkins and cups), brought in the plates, bowls and food for the buffet lunch, (we didn’t ask if she also prepared all the food), served the soup then removed all the plates, cutlery, tablecloths, etc, and cleaned up after the meeting was done. For her incredible service, the Estevan Rotary Club has awarded her a Paul Harris Fellow.The third was the presence of a sweet young lady, Payton, about 5 or 6 years of age, at the club meeting, who was there with her Rotarian mother, Andrea. Andrea indicated that Payton enjoys coming to Rotary meetings because she likes the opportunity to dress up. That day Payton was colour coordinated with a long pink and white dress, a pink purse and pink high-heeled shoes decorated with rhinestones. She said she had several pairs of shoes like those, each in a different colour!\n\nWell. It has been a busy winter for us. The ice is still here and probably will be for a while. Although the shoreline is starting to open up a little, time will tell. We promised some fishing for some conference attendees. Odds are that the shoreline will be open enough to do that. Bring your rods and a couple of CD11 Rapala (blue , gold, silver). They are best for offshore unless you want to set up a bait rig.\n\nConference 2013 Set for The Pas\n\nAnd the conference is coming up pretty quick. May 30th we will be golfing to start it off. We’ve got some excellent speakers, a representative from the Restorative Action Program (RAP) in Saskatoon, an Ambassador from Guatemala, an RI rep that has been around the world involved in many Rotary programs, and some great food. The entertainment and opening ceremony will be something you don’t want to miss. The northern “pipers” will be worth the admission.\n\nCanadian Rotarians Excel for PolioPlus\n\nAt the Vaccine Summit that is being held in Abu Dhabi, Minister Fantino has announced that the Canadian Government will commit $250 million between 2013-2018 to the Polio Eradication Effort.\n\nCongratulations to all Rotarians who helped to influence the government.\n\nCanadian Rotarians have raised $2 million for polio matched 3 to 1 by Government of Canada and Gates Foundation. That means $6 million for polio eradication. $400,000 was raised in one week when the Government of Canada and the Gates Foundation announced on February 23 an extension of the matching agreement to remove the maximum limit of $1 million for the March 1 deadline. Well done.\n\nTravel & Events\n\nThe revised District Manual of Policies and Procedures (MOPP) should be ready to approve at the Annual general meeting. Thanks for all the assistance to make it all come together.\n\nWe made a few trips including Youth Exchange program (YEP) events, Paul Harris Fellow presentations, general business, and even got to go on a little vacation to the Rockies. And a special trip to Winnipeg to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the new Museum of Human Rights.\n\nUnfortunately, we did have a couple of outstanding Rotarians pass on. Our thoughts are with the clubs and are certain they will be remembered.\n\nWe did miss one important event and regret not being there. The Rotary Club of Estevan celebrated ninety years of Rotary success. There were 180 people in attendance along with the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan. PDGs Peter Peters and Wayne Claypoole were there to present Paul Harris Fellowships and pass along their congratulations and mine. Thank you everyone and again my apologies.\n\nWe did get to the Paul Harris night in Neepawa and presented the awards to Rotarians and citizens of Neepawa. It is always a pleasure to meet such dedicated people. We had an enjoyable evening and as always- great food.\n\nWe left the next morning for Winnipeg, spent the day there, turned around and went to Russell that evening. The YEP orientation took place with all of our inbound and outbound students. We have to congratulate the committee on a very well run event. We were on hand to see Jackie Taylor pass the reins over to Leanne Kessler. Jackie has been the Outbound chair for umpteen years and has decided to retire from her position. (something to do with horse shows). We certainly wish Jackie all the best and am glad she will remain an active Rotarian with the Nipawin club. Leanne has been working with Jackie the last year and is not only suited for the job, but, is doing it very well.\n\nWe were able to have the exchange students visit us in The Pas for “The Pas Winterfest”. They all enjoyed dog sled rides, skidoo rides, Inuit games, and camaraderie. They will be at District conference to\n\nentertain you and then catch their bus for the Western trip. We have to Thank Ted Smook for all the arranging, chaperoning and driving for this annual trip. They will have one more group outing at Camp Whitney provided by the Flin Flon Rotary club. It is always a great time and the District appreciates the many years the Flin Flon club has dedicated to this program. Then it will be time for the students to travel home. Next year the Minnedosa club will be holding the Halloween event. The YEP is one of our longest and most important programs. We appreciate that most of the clubs in the District have been involved in one way or another.\n\nRemember to help your student raise some money!! They were all given a challenge to raise funds for either Shelterbox or Polio. Although they are to present their gains at the District conference, they can still carry on until they leave.\n\nWORLD PEACE PARTNERS HAS DONE IT AGAIN! Congratulations on a terrific step towards the goal of Peace and Understanding. District 5550 will be on the map!\n\nOn May 10, 2013 we signed the MOU with Stuart Murray, CEO of the Museum of Human Rights. It is an agreement with District 5550, World Peace Partners and the Museum of Human Rights to assist in the education of youth. We will have a presentation on this at District Conference. Further information can also be had on the World Peace Partners website.\n\nAfter the signing, David and Brenda Newman took us to the Model United Nations Assembly (MUNA) headquarters. Another great Rotary Program. A big “Thanks!” to all the volunteers. Elly has done a super job in organizing the MUNA event for our students. We didn’t get to participate, but the students we spoke to were thoroughly enjoying the experience.\n\nThere have been many fundraising activities and service projects going on in our District in the last few months. Some were old standbys and some were new adventures. Keep up the good work.\n\nThe Pas club has assisted in sending Dental techs to Guatemala for an annual working program with participants from Red River College and North Dakota. We are looking at this program for a future Vocational Training team mission. It has been going on for eight years and Rotary has not been involved. Maybe that will change.\n\nDauphin Rotary club has a new fundraiser- a mud race. It is scheduled for this summer and looks like a good one. August 10, 2013 Manitoba Mud Run | Facebook\n\nIt’s not too late to sign up for conference- see y’all there!\n\nWe got a late start to 2013! We spent the evening with “what else?”--- Another Rotarian!\n\nWe were in the middle of “what else,” but another Rotary discussion! When someone said “Oops, we missed the moment”! It was about ten minutes past the stroke of midnight. We hugged, offered best wishes and “yes” carried on the conversation.\n\nThe important dialogue was the planning of The Pas Winterfest where we get to host the Youth Exchange students in March. This event will take place March 7-10, 2013.\n\nWe spent the weekend of January 18-21 with the students in Melfort, SK and filled them in about The Pas. The Melfort weekend went well despite the very cold weather. The Melfort Club did very well considering the juggling of events because of the cold. The previous weekend had been cancelled due to a winter storm. Skiing and snowboarding were great but the hayride had to be cancelled.\n\nIndoor events of swimming, bowling, and curling were enjoyed and the Sunday dinner was excellent. We had expected no less from this club that has hosted exchange student programs for so many, many years. Thank you and keep up the great work!\n\nWe have special Thanks to Jackie Taylor from the Nipawin Club. Jackie has been our Outbound Student Coordinator for the Youth Exchange Program for longer than I can remember. We have always enjoyed working with Jackie. Jackie assures us that her replacement, Leanne Kessler, from Saskatoon Meewasin will be a big asset to the program. Congratulations, Leanne. And Thank you for doing this huge job for the students. Leanne officially takes over at the end of April at the orientation in Russell.\n\nThe majority of our time has been spent working on the Manual of Procedure and our conference planning. We did get out fishing twice and caught well. Snow blowing has been more than last year already and we still have three more months of winter.\n\nConference plans are doing well. We have on line registration up and running at http://rotary5550conference.ca/. Some of the events are still being organized and will be on the website as soon as possible.\n\nThe Manual has been rewritten and is awaiting adjustment. We have to thank our legal advisor and Parliamentarian David who has helped a lot with this. David came up with a plan for a new Organizational Chart which will improve the continuity of the manual and by-laws. We are just finishing this chart. We expect to have the Executive approve it in early February. Once this is done we can coordinate the manual to the chart. The next step will be to have the board members agree. We expect to have the final draft at the general meeting at conference for final approval.\n\nThe District Transition team and Training team have been working hard and steady, making sure that we are ready for July 1st and the new grants management system.\n\nAs an added note from the RI Stewardship department:\n\n“I am happy to inform you that District 5550 was 100% up-to-date with reporting requirements for grants sponsored by the district and its clubs as of the January 2013 analysis.”\n\nOur Membership Chair, Gail Dodds (Estevan Club) has informed us that there is a slight increase in the overall District membership. Although we have had some members leave for various reasons, some clubs have been able to increase membership. We do have 25 percent female members in our District which is higher than the RI average of 17%. Gail will be at PETS to discuss some of the ideas that clubs have used for this progression.\n\nA $5,000 donation to the Lake of the Woods Hospital Foundation has been made in honour of Rotarian Earl Nelson. Pictured left to right is President Mike Szajewski, Foundation Managing Director Jess Rheault, Earl's son Rotarian David Nelson, and Community Services Director John Dahl.\n\nUnfortunately we have had a great Rotarian pass on and would like to offer our condolences to his family. On January 10th, the Rotary Club of Kenora’s Earl Nelson, a Rotarian for 58 years passed away. (see obituary).\n\nCongratulations to PDG Nancy Morris (and driver Dave, too). Nancy has been asked by President Tanaka to represent him at the District 7820 conference in May. This will take place in Halifax the week before our conference. What a great honor for Nancy and our District. We know Governor Tom McCaughey (7820) and were thinking of calling ahead and offering Dave’s services as a driver!\n\nDG Tom has since sent a letter asking for the clubs to support a literacy program throughout Rotary. The club Presidents have received a copy of this request. In his letter Tom says:\n\nDid you know that low adult literacy costs Canadian businesses over $4 billion annually?\n\nThe 2005 Statistics Canada presented their findings on the 2003 International Adult and Literacy Skills Survey showing that 48% of Canadians 16 years of age and older do not have the literacy skills they need to keep pace with the escalating demands of our society and economy. …\n\nThe first step in addressing workplace literacy is to understand what employers know about the topic and to gauge their willingness/opinions on an approach. An ABC Life Literacy Canada survey has been adapted and the goal is to have every Rotarian in Canada take it to their company and have it completed by the appropriate individual.\n\nPlease do the survey.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/BCG6DZS\n\nRotary Foundation reports show that our District contributions are on par with last year. If clubs continue with their donations as per their Annual Program Fund goals, they should surpass 2011-12. Keep up the good work and thank you for your support!\n\nWe have received some interesting information about Polio from our Zones 24-32, Rotary International, Director (2012-14), Bryn Styles. He wrote:\n\n“The IPPC (International Polio Plus Committee) committee and our support staff are anxious to quantify the success in Canada so the advocacy program can be encouraged worldwide….\n\nWhat we need is to find out how many clubs are planning on having an event during the week of the 17 Feb 2013 or are planning an event at a later date.\n\nCould you please contact your clubs and find out if a club is having an event, the type of event, when it will be held and if there will be media coverage? If there is other information that clubs wish to share then that would be most welcome.\n\nAll of this information can be used when our Rotary senior leaders talk with the Canadian government and we can indicate to them the support for polio eradication within Canada.”\n\nPlease send me the information at your earliest convenience at rghubbs@gmail.com\n\nWe have received some special Polio days from a few clubs and hope for more. We have also gotten one Presidential Citation application. Be sure to consider filling one out for your club.\n\nDistrict Governor Elect Ed and our Foundation Chair Eva have been undergoing their training for an exciting year bringing in the new Future Vision plan. Although there seems to be some questions as to how and why, it should be beneficial. It is interesting to see Ed’s new theme. But for now, let’s just remember: “Peace through Service”\n\nEnjoy the snow. Don’t shovel too much, and stay warm and safe!\n\nAlthough Fran and I would like to wish everyone a joyous and safe holiday season we were first and foremost saddened to hear the news of the passing of two Rotarian partners in the last two weeks.\n\nHence we extend our condolences to Past District Governor (PDG) Harold Empe and to Gary Morrish of The Rotary Club of The Pas. Both of these men are long standing and respected Rotarians. Both we know, will miss the support of their partners. We can assure them that they will continue to have that support in the Rotary world.\n\nOn a more pleasant note, we congratulate the Rotaract Club of Regina Auxillium. They had a wonderful event which raised over $3,000.00 towards Polio. GOOD on you!\n\nWe also attended the 75th anniversary of the Rotary Club of Selkirk.It was a very nice evening with accolades presented by several community leaders. Amongst their many service projects this club is a big supporter of World Peace Partners. David Newman spoke to that and was proud to have one of the program’s students share her success story with us.\n\nFran and I do wish everyone a joyous and safe holiday season. Although we are not looking at a new Rotary year; the calendar new year will begin many new experiences for Rotarians. Our District governors: elect, nominee, and nominee designate will be working on their “new years\" to come. We wish them well.\n\nThank you all for your continued support and have a great New Year!\n\nGimli Rotarian, Ken Krebs Nominated as District Governor for 2015-2016\n\nCongratulations to Ken and Donna Krebs\n\nKen Krebs has been chosen to be the District Governor of District 5550 for the Rotary year 2015-2016. We are confident that Ken will more than fill the role.\n\nFran and I wish Ken and Donna an interesting, educational, and exciting future. There will be many challenging and fun adventures over the next two years leading up to this position. Do your best to enjoy them all.\n\nWe can now call Ken \"Mr. DGND\"\n\nOn behalf of the members of District 5550 thank you for what you have done and will be doing for the good of Rotary.\n\nDistrict 5550 Rotarians Prominent in Movember Movement to Raise Funds for Prostate Cancer Research and Mens' Mental Health\n\nWhen Dryden Rotarian and District 5550 Communications Director, John Borst, asked me at the last moment if he could use the ClubRunner software to raise funds for prostate cancer research I quickly replied yes.\n\nThe response was very positive so I asked him to share the results with you because I suspect next year this could become quite a competition among our District 5550 clubs and within Rotary in Canada.\n\nTotal Amount for all countries raised by 1,125,529 participants for the Movember Foundation as of December 9, 2012 is $122,074,491\n\nOn Dec 6th the CBC reported the top individual fundraiser as Reed Ludwig of Medstead, Saskatchewan (located about 170 kilometres west of Prince Albert) with donations of $96,321. However on December 9th Bill Doherty of the Walton Group, headquartered out of Calgary, is the leader with $166,690.00. The third ($90,791), fourth ($75,200) and fifth ($47,994) biggest individual fundraisers are also from Canada.\n\nIt should be no surprise then to find Canada as the top fundraiser among the world’s nations with $38,910,315 in contributions. Other countries raising in excess of one million dollars are: the United Kingdom- $30,692,665; Australia- $24,916,480; USA- $19,140,244; Ireland- $1,900,414 and New Zealand- $1,173,552.\n\nCanadian Rotarians were also the only Rotarians to really organize themselves into a “Network” for purpose of injecting a little competition. Fifteen clubs from across Canada registered and together raised $19,730.00. District 7040’s Iqaluit “Mo’tary” as they called themselves beat all comers by raising $5,617.00. District 5550’s Dryden Rotary came second with $3,157.00, while Saskatoon’s Meewasin club raised $1,400. However, on December 7th I received an e-mail from Brian Martin of the Prince Albert club. Brian led a group which raise $1,055 in honour of their current President, Clint Thierman, who had prostate cancer three years ago. Even though the group was not under the Rotary banner, it does mean that District 5550 collectively raised $5,612.00 just shy of District 7040’s total.\n\nThe Movember program places everyone who raises $1000.00 or more in the “Platinum Club”. Four Rotarians from Canada achieved that standard. Among the 62 Rotarians District 5550’s John Borst topped out at $2030.00.\n\nRotary Friendship Exchange to the State of New Mexico is a “GO!”\n\nOn December 3rd, Kevin Wilson, chair of our Rotary Friendship Exchange team sent me the following message.\n\nI am pleased to report that the New Mexico Friendship Exchange is going ahead. At the moment, the team includes one couple and three singles. However, there is a good chance that an additional couple will join them. My contact in New Mexico is aware that the team is smaller than usual, but she is OK with that. As you know from experience the team is bound to have a wonderful time.\n\nKevin would also like to compile a list of all District Rotarians who have participated in a Friendship Exchange. If you are one of those Rotarians please contact Kevin at kevin.wilson@usask.ca or watch for a bulletin in the near future.\n\nWe have finished our club visits and are definitely wiser! We have found that each club is autonomous in the fact that there are no two clubs alike. Each club has their way of doing things. It was very interesting to visit and see how the clubs operated and all the different fundraising and service projects they have. We are happy to report that every club does something with children.\n\nWe did learn one thing- we need to share more ideas. An example would be children’s books. Clubs should be aware of who holds book sales and how they could benefit from having access to these books.\n\nWeyburn Club\n\nDiscussion with Exchange Student\n\nCheque for Polio, Regina South\n\nPromoting Literacy, Weyburn\n\nWe have clubs working with needy children that could use reading books.\n\nThe key issue appears to be membership and retention. This is a hot topic throughout Rotary. What is the answer? In our opinion, it all comes down to “education” and “engagement”. We have to do more to not only educate our members but, the public as well. When we have a new member, mentorship is a good thing to educate. Hands on projects are good times to invite potential members and to keep other members engaged. Our meetings should make a person want to attend. If you are bored; find a new project and do it. Some clubs did indicate that they were tired of the same old thing and were looking for something new. There are lots of fundraising projects on the website. Maybe there is one for you.\n\nProjectLINK is a great spot to look\n\nSpeaking of projects- we are looking for someone to partner with a club in India to help equip a school. The District has committed some funds from our DDF and we need a club with $5000 to share this.\n\nFran’s Cook Book Cancelled\n\nThe Cookbook project has been put on hold.\n\nFran’s Cookbook\n\na. We have decided to terminate the cookbook project\n\nb. Thank you to those that have sent in recipes!\n\nc. We received a logical suggestion that has made us decide\n\nd. If we carry on with the book, we will not have enough time to make the March cutoff for tripling the Polio donations\n\ne. If each club donates a minimum of $500.00 before March; the amounts will be matched by the Canadian Government and Bill Gates Foundation (3 times your dollar!)\n\nf. This will result in more than we can make on the cookbook\n\nA Great Way to Thank a Rotary Club\n\nAl Mosewich sent me a thank you picture which ran in the Watrous Manitou weekly. What a great way to say thank you!\n\nThe Governor Elect Training Symposium (GETS) Experience\n\n(L-R) DGE Ed Thompson, Elaine Thompson, Fran Hubbs, DG Rick Hubbs\n\nFran and I attended GETS along with Governor Elect Ed Thompson and his wife Elaine in Vancouver. There was discussion on membership and membership and membership. Public Relations and membership! We heard a little more about Future vision, name branding, marketing, and Rotary education. It was a good thing. The Ripple Effect program was a highlight for many. We actually met Peter Peters there too. He is everywhere!\n\nOn Friday afternoon about 400 of us went on an “End Polio Now” walk along the breakwater. Somebody must have seen us; we all had red rain jackets on! Surely there was some PR and awareness there. And, Peter and Marg where there!!\n\nThanks to Ray for letting us store the car and the airport pickups.\n\nWe have to Thank our group of assistant governors for all their support, help, and chauffeuring.\n\nAfter we had a couple days at home we went down to Russell to attend the Rotary Leadership Institute (RLI) and Future Vision Grants sessions. The training team and Transition team had everything organized and it was very informative. Thanks for the great work!\n\nWe learned and laughed and made more money for Polio. What a great group of Rotarians.\n\nWhile we were there it was a privilege to present a letter of gratitude to the Russell Inn for their excellent customer service. The return comments were in full respect of Rotary and what we do for them and their community.\n\nOf course it snowed; when doesn’t it snow in Russell? Everyone made it home safe. We all left by Sunday noon, except for our diligent Training team. Joanne, Peter, and Darren stayed over Monday to organize for next year’s training sessions. So, remember, when they invite you to PETS or an Assembly, consider the work they have done to prepare you for your year.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Selkirk is celebrating 75 years this month. Congratulations! November 17 will be their gala dinner and celebration with Mr. David Newman as a key speaker.\n\nWorld Peace Partners signs agreement with Travel Manitoba\n\nWorld Peace Partners is doing a lot of work with our youth, promoting education and peace initiatives. They are presently meeting with Travel Manitoba and the new Museum to further promote their programs.\n\nDavid Newman, World Peace Partner co-chair reports:\n\n“Travel Manitoba and Tourism Winnipeg and Continental Travel have agreed to be part of a strategic alliance with District 5550, the Museum and universities involved in a student travel program called Adventure in Human Rights. On November 24th we are having a brainstorming meeting from 10 to 2 at Irwin Kumka's offices to determine who does what in this collaboration and to get started with the plan. We have made clear that administrative capacity, marketing and information technology services must be provided by our new allies. We will have to protect Rotary privacy. The Museum and participating universities will create the course content with input from us. We will seek a Rotary education component just as we did with AGC. Our District role will be to provide access to Rotarians at International and District Conferences to promote the program and to encourage other clubs and districts to support student participation from their area.”\n\nThis is, and will be, a unique program for District 5550 and World Peace Partners. If you are looking for a cause, think about this one.\n\n2013 PR Program to Focus on TV Ads\n\nWe have been asked by a few people about the PR grant information this upcoming year. We have made an agreement with CTV for promotion of Rotary in our District.\n\nPublic Relations chair Allen Oruski reports:\n\n“Approval in principle was agreed upon with CTV in Saskatoon and in Winnipeg to air Rotary commercials as prescribed by Rotary International. The campaign began on the week of October 29, in Manitoba and Western Ontario as well as Saskatchewan. In the first two weeks of the campaign, 7 ads will be airedin Saskatchewan on programs including Anderson live, W-Five and Sportscenter. As for Manitoba and Western Ontario, 16 ads will be aired on programs including Dr OZ, Anderson Live, Live With Kelly & Michael, CTV Morning Live, and CSI New York. All ads are spots of 30 seconds. For the present, we will be using Polio Plus WE ARE THAT CLOSE ads we obtained from Rotary International.\n\nIt should be noted that this program and the success of implementation is largely due to the efforts of Robin Cennon, a former Rotarian and sales director for CTV in Saskatoon. Robin was able to utilize information and documentation from past Rotary PR programs. Although there is not a formal agreement for services in kind, it has been my experience that CTV will do Rotary well. We expect to conclude this campaign by mid April of 2013.\n\nI have discussed with CTV the possibility of obtaining their support and services in producing an ad specific to our District. Issues such as membership (recruitment) were some of the ideas discussed. I would like to finance this part of our PR campaign through a levy on all Clubs within the District. This levy would probably amount to $3,000.00 based upon membership numbers within each Club. As for a decision on the topic, perhaps a road trip throughout the District filming individual members would be in order? As a point of interest, in the past, RI would produce and distribute PSAs to the television stations for use as fillers. Two years ago, RI stopped doing this. It's up to us to take the lead now.”\n\nWe are pleased with the financial arrangement with CTV and it allows us to follow Rotary International regulations for grant money. Thank you Al and Robin! Watch for the ads.\n\nWe will be working on the rewriting of our Manual of Policy and Procedure over the next few weeks.
