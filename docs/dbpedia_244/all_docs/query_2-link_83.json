        "text": "Yorkton Residential Real Estate for Sale\n\nAll Listings\n\nUnder $100,000\n\n$100,000 - $200,000\n\n$200,000 - $300,000\n\n$300,000 - $400,000\n\n$400,000 - $500,000\n\n$500,000 - $600,000\n\n$600,000 - $700,000\n\nYorkton, SK At A Glance\n\nYorkton is a city that joins together highways 16, 10, and 9. The two national Railroads, CN and CP, bisect the city in their respective routes. As a result, Yorkton has become the hub of activity in Southeastern Saskatchewan. Businesses thrive on the growing population of the city, as well as the vast amount of people that shop in Yorkton from the surrounding area. Residents benefit from having many public services available to them, such as health services, housing programs, public transit, fully staffed fire and police services, a regional library, a Public and Catholic school system, walk-in clinics, large recreational facilities, parks, different media services, an art gallery, a museum, and clubs.\n\nWhile a city, Yorkton still retains all the charm of small towns. You're a neighbour no matter which side of town you live on, and driving across town to get to the grocery store takes 7-10 minutes at most. Good things happen here because good people ARE here!\n\nDiscover Yorkton Homes For Sale\n\nThe housing market in Yorkton comprises an exciting mixture of new, modern homes and older, historic properties. Arguably, one of the biggest charms of the city is its rich history, but those searching for a home have a lot of choice. This extends to both architecture and price points, as Yorkton has quite a range for both.\n\nYorkton’s center is primarily made up of charming, older bunglows. With construction dates as early as the 1920s and 1930s, homebuyers desiring a historic property can find one at relatively competitive prices. Many of these homes have kept the original features, including hardwood floors, fireplaces, and solid wood doors, although other owners have updated these properties over the years. Although these homes typically have smaller square footage, they do offer something quite unique—including excellent locations near the city’s shops and restaurants.\n\nIn contrast, Yorkton is also expanding, and this means new construction homes for sale. The northeastern section of the city has seen a lot of development, and homes typically get larger in size as they move further away from the city center. Architecturally, these properties range more significantly than their historic counterparts, and include traditional suburban styles as well as sleek, modern designs. Neighbourhoods such as Riverside Grove are desirable for their beautiful properties and quiet, residential streets. Home interiors for new construction properties often carry through the modern design, with contemporary finishes and upgrades.\n\nYorkton Highlights & Amenities\n\nThis city has a lot to offer in regards to amenities. Mixing residential and commercial areas, it offers the privacy of small-town living with the retail and dining opportunities of a larger city. This includes both local businesses and chain stores, which also attract those from smaller, surrounding areas. Residents of Yorkton can quickly pick up necessities, as well as explore the region outside of the city.\n\nIn regards to education, there are several schools in Yorkton, including (but not limited to) DR. Brass Elementary School, St Alphonsus Elementary School, Yorkdale Central School, St. Michael’s School, Sacred Heart High School, and Yorkton Regional High School.\n\nOther Yorkton highlights include Deer Park Golf Course, the Western Development Museum, the Gallagher Centre, and the Yorkton Public LIbrary. There are also a number of parks and green spaces in the city, such as Ravine Ecological Preserve and Logan Green Park, and smaller areas, including Jubilee Park, Patrick Park, Heritage Heights Park, and Weinmaster Park."
