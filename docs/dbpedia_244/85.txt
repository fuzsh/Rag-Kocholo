They were impressed with the crown land available near the Manitoba border and purchased portions of six townships near the Little Whitesand River (now Yorkton Creek) for settlement and to establish a trade centre, which became known as York Colony. The colony was relocated alongside a new rail line in 1889 and was incorporated as a city in 1928.
