Biographical History

Anne McCaffrey (1926-2011) was an American-Irish author, best known for her Dragonriders of Pern books (Dragonflight, Dragonquest, Dragonsinger, etc.). Many of her novels feature strong female characters; McCaffrey has been widely quoted as saying that her novel Restoree, for example, was intended as a rebuttal to the way women were usually portrayed in science fiction.

She has won numerous awards and accolades, including becoming the first woman to win a Hugo Award (1968) and the first to win a Nebula Award (1969). In 1999, she received the American Library Association's Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for teens. In 2005 she was named a Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2006. Since her death, her son Todd McCaffrey has continued writing books set in the Pern universe.
