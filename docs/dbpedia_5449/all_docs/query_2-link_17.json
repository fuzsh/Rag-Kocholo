        "text": "LoAR\n\nof the College of Arms\n\nof the\n\nSociety for Creative Anachronism, Inc.\n\nMarch 1993\n\nTHE FOLLOWING NAMES AND ARMORIES HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND REGISTERED:\n\nAN TIR\n\nDarien Tevarson. Household name for House Perseverance.\n\nThe household name was submitted as Hushåll Ihärdighet. We aren't sure whether this is idiomatic Swedish for \"House Perseverance\", the intended meaning -- or whether this would be a reasonable household name in Swedish even if the construction were correct idiom. However, the English translation appears reasonable: as Lord Palimpsest notes, given the period examples of Alexander Mirthe and Gilbert Rage, a hypothetical John Perseverance would be acceptable -- and so, therefore, would be House Perseverance. The submitter has explicitly allowed us to register the English translation. Should he succeed in documenting the Swedish (both in idiom and in usage), he can resubmit.\n\nJohann Künster of the Sweord Ora. Name and device. Per chevron sable and argent, two pens in saltire Or and a closed book palewise azure garnished Or.\n\nThe occupational name (\"artisan\") was submitted as Künstler, which appears to be modern German. We felt we could accept a mix of Old English with its contemporary German, but not Old English with modern German. We've substituted a medieval form of the word, as found in Bahlow's Deutches Namenlexicon. Better still would be to translate the entire name into either Old English (replacing Künst(l)er with Wyrhta) or German (which would probably mean deleting the toponymic altogether). You might suggest one of these to the submitter.\n\nKimura Tetsuo. Name and device. Sable, a plate issuant from a Japanese stream, within five drawer-handles conjoined in annulo argent.\n\nThe peripheral charges (and their blazon) gave us some problems, and we were afraid we'd have to return this for lack of documentation on the charge, as well as lack of blazonability. Drawer-handles are found in Japanese Design Motifs (compiled by the Matsuya Piece-Goods Store) and Dower's Elements of Japanese Design; but neither of these works describe actual Mon, but simply designs suitable for Mon. Dower's book, however, notes the origin of the charge: kan (handles) seem to be an artistic variant of the mokko, a slice of segmented melon. Hawley's Mon, p.18, gives several examples of actual use under that blazon. We don't object, in this case, to using a modern term for a period charge, and it does make the blazon more readily renderable.\n\nLettice Chandler. Name.\n\nNannina Fiora Scozzonatore da Lucca. Name.\n\nSaundra the Incorrigible. Name and device. Per bend sinister argent and azure, a pair of lips gules and three increscents argent.\n\nThe given name seems a reasonable interpolation between the documented given names Saundre and Sandra.\n\nWhile we have no period evidence for the use of lips as charges, we do have examples of other body parts: hands, arms, feet, legs, heads, eyes, teeth and mustaches. On the basis of these, we've registered ears and toes in the SCA. Lips thus appear to be compatible with period armory, though I'd be willing to count them a \"weirdness\" pending better documentation.\n\nStevyn Corde the Corsair. Name and device. Argent, a bend sinister counter-compony Or and sable, overall a unicorn's head erased azure.\n\nTaliesin Sigrid. Name.\n\nATENVELDT\n\nAlexander Michael Connor O'Malley. Name and device. Per chevron embattled vert and argent, two trefoils and a turtle counterchanged.\n\nThe charge in base was submitted as a sea-turtle; but that term in heraldry would refer to a fish-tailed demi-turtle, not the natural sea-turtle. Since there's no heraldic difference between a natural sea-turtle and a regular turtle, we've used the latter term.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Title for Crane's Wing Pursuivant.\n\nBengta Rolfsdotter. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nThe byname was submitted as Ralfsdatter. Unfortunately, Ralf is the English derivative of ON Ráðúlfr, or possibly Hrólfr; it may not be used with the Danish suffix -datter. Lady Harpy has documented Rolf, a Swedish name c.1431; we've used the Swedish suffix -dotter to register the name. The submitter could also use the Old Norse Ráðúlfsdóttir or Hrólfsdóttir.\n\nCaitlin Ross of Cairngorm. Badge. Per bend sinister azure and gules, a bend sinister engrailed between two arrows bendwise sinister, that in base inverted argent.\n\nCormac Silverhawke of Cairngorm. Name and device. Per bend sinister purpure and vert, a hawk striking contourny, holding an arrow in its talons, a bordure argent.\n\nDafydd of Whitetree. Device. Azure, on a tree eradicated Or trunked argent, a sword inverted gules, in chief three mullets of eight points Or.\n\nThough the LOI gave this as a new name and device submission, the name had already been registered, on the LoAR of Dec 92. Please instruct the submitter to draw the sword larger henceforth.\n\nGabrielle Antoinette Dubois. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nGuillaume de la Vallée de l'Ouest du Lac Salé. Badge. Purpure ermined Or, on a pile dovetailed Or a tower sable.\n\nHugh Michael Sinclair. Name and device. Argent, a wyvern statant, wings displayed and on a chief azure, three mullets of eight points argent.\n\nLinnet Morningstar. Name and device. Per chevron purpure mullety of six points argent, and argent, in base a spiked ball and chain bendwise sable, a chief embattled argent.\n\nThe charge in base was blazoned as a morningstar, for canting purposes. We will make great allowances in a blazon for the sake of a cant, but nonetheless insist that they be correct. In this case, the charge is neither the morningstar as defined in Stone's Glossary of Arms and Armor (which we'd call a spiked mace in the SCA) nor the morningstar as defined in SCA armory (which is the submitted charge with a long wooden handle attached -- essentially a spiky flail). If the submitter wishes to keep her cant, she'll have to resubmit with one of the above types of morningstar.\n\nOdinel Reidleck. Device. Quarterly gules and sable, a dragon passant contourny and a bordure argent.\n\nRadulfr Arnason. Device. Per bend sinister indented Or and sable, a mullet of ten points sable and a decrescent argent.\n\nThough similar, this is clear of Catherine of Southdowns (SCA), Per bend sinister Or and sable, a compass star and an increscent counterchanged, with CDs for complex field division and tincture and orientation of the charge in base. A comparison of the emblazons showed no visual conflict.\n\nSentinels' Keep, Barony of. Name change (from Sentinels' Keep, Shire of) and name for the Order of the Argent Plume.\n\nSentinels' Keep, Barony of. Name for the Order of the Jewel of the Keep.\n\nATLANTIA\n\nAlastar Clark Bowman. Device. Per pale argent and sable, on a pale gules between two sealions respectant counterchanged, an arrow argent.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the pale a bit wider henceforth.\n\nArtorius Conchobhar. Name.\n\nAtlantia, Kingdom of. Title for Argent Snail Herald.\n\nBran Trefonin. Device. Per pale argent and gules, on a sun counterchanged a raven displayed and facing sinister, a bordure sable.\n\nCaroline de Chesnei. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nCassandra Grey. Name and device. Checky sable and argent, on a chevron cotised gules three mullets argent.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw the cotises wider.\n\nCathair Dhaibhaidh, College of. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nThis was submitted as Caer Daibhidh, combining Welsh and Scots Gaelic in a single phrase. This isn't normally permitted, per Rule III.2.a, and has been the reason for the last three returns of their name. The submitters provided evidence (augmented by Lady Harpy) that the element caer- is found in many Scots placenames: e.g. Caerlaverock, Caerlanrig, Caer Ruther. However, in those cases caer- doesn't seem to be from Welsh; the prefix derives either from the Gaelic cathair or from the extinct Cumbric cair, and is only spelled Caer in its modern form, due to the Welsh influence.\n\nIt could be argued that, even if Caer were derived from the Gaelic cathair, the submitted name would still seem acceptable, given the cited examples. Most of those examples, though, are anglicized forms; and while an anglicized Caerdavid would be perfectly acceptable, the submitted Gaelic spelling of Daibhidh requires a plausible construction for that language. Not only must Daibhidh be put into the genitive case, but an unanglicized form of Caer must be used. The submission forms do not forbid grammatical corrections, so we've substituted the correct Gaelic spelling; the pronunciation is nearly unchanged from their submitted form. If they prefer the spelling Caer, they may resubmit Caerdavid or the fully Welsh Caer Ddafydd.\n\nClare de Chesnei. Name and device. Argent, a tree eradicated proper, a bordure azure semy of acorns Or.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw fewer and larger acorns.\n\nDonnachadh Balquhidder. Name.\n\nGalyarde's Bastion, Canton of. Name and device. Per pale purpure and argent, a tower within a laurel wreath counterchanged.\n\nGodfrey of Huntington. Name change (from Alexander Godfrey) (see RETURNS for device).\n\nIan Úlfsson. Name and device. Azure, two lightning bolts crossed in saltire, overall a wolf's head palewise erased argent.\n\nThe LOI spelled the patronymic Úlfssonn, but the forms spelled it as above, with a single N. Since that matches the cited documentation, and since no documentation could be found for Úlfssonn, we've substituted the correct spelling.\n\nMargaret Terryll. Name and device. Azure, on a chevron argent a leaved branch sable, in chief a lizard statant argent.\n\nMichaela Nürnberger. Name.\n\nPenelope Cambden. Name and device. Per pale sable and gules, a unicorn horn throughout between two roundels in bend sinister argent.\n\nThe device would be far better if the roundels were in fess.\n\nSabine la Peureuse. Device change. Per saltire vert and argent, a cross of four lozenges counterchanged, a base enarched and indented argent.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the base larger. We recommend adding a point or three to the base, then fitting the cross into one of the base's notches.\n\nHer previous device (Argent, a fox salient sable, on a chief indented purpure five lozenges argent) is released.\n\nSacred Stone, Barony of the. Name for the Order of the Yeomen of the Sacred Stone.\n\nThis was submitted as the Order of the Yeoman of the Sacred Stone, but we assume there will be more than one individual admitted. We've therefore substituted the plural. The name is something of an oxymoron, since an order is by definition gentle or noble, while yeomen by definition aren't; this would be better simply as the Yeomen of the Sacred Stone, without the Order of. The College has registered similar \"peasant orders\" in the past, however (v. the Order of the Franklins of Dreiburgen), and we recognize that some people prefer peasant personae.\n\nThorin von der Schwarzrose. Device. Ermine, a kingfisher contourny azure maintaining a pen between four roses in cross sable.\n\nWilliam the Stout. Device. Checky argent and azure, a cross flory issuant from base and on a chief Or, three roses gules.\n\nZillah de Barcelona. Device. Per pale sable and argent, a mullet inverted between in chief three roundels one and two counterchanged, a chief indented purpure.\n\nThe arrangement of the roundels is a \"weirdness\", being poor style and awkward of blazon; since it was noted in her previous return, it needed to be changed or justified before the submission could be registered. In this case, the motif is already registered to the submitter's husband, Geoffrey Blacksteel (Per pale argent and sable, a mullet inverted between in chief three roundels one and two all counterchanged); the Grandfather Clause permits her to register it as well.\n\nCALONTIR\n\nAlanna Margaret Rennaut. Name and device. Per bend sinister argent and vert, two Catherine wheels counterchanged.\n\nCearan Mac Brendan. Name and device. Argent, three demi-lightning bolts palewise issuant from chief azure, a bordure purpure.\n\nDolan Madoc of Harlech. Name.\n\nNote that the standard anglicizations of the Irish Dubhshláine would be Dowlaney or Dulany; however, since the patronymic form is anglicized O'Dolan, and since the name is the same in patronymic constructions (i.e. the nominative and genitive cases seem to be identical), this should be a reasonable anglicization as well.\n\nGillian Esmond of Dragon's Ley. Name.\n\nLuigsech ní Ifearnáin. Name.\n\nThe patronymic was submitted as ni hIfearnain. Since ó is the only patronynmic particle that prefixes an h to vowels, we've dropped the h from the patronymic. This would be better as Luigsech ingen Iffernáin, a consistent 12th century form.\n\nWilliam Abberley of Richmond. Name.\n\nEAST\n\nAilean mac an Daraich. Device. Per chevron gules and argent, in base an oak tree eradicated within a bordure embattled sable.\n\nAislinn ní Bhaotháin. Name.\n\nThe byname was submitted as ni Baothan. The use of the particle ní casts the following word into the genitive case, and causes aspiration as well. We've corrected the grammar.\n\nAn Dubhaigeainn, Barony of. Name and badge for the Order of the Silver Feather. Azure, a feather fesswise argent.\n\nAnastasia Diaz de León. Name and device. Or, a dragon couchant reguardant, wings displayed vert, a bordure gules.\n\nArtemius Andreas Magnus. Name.\n\nAvraham ben Shimon ha-Granadi. Name.\n\nCarwen Leigh. Name.\n\nCedric the Humble. Name.\n\nCiarnat ferch Cynan. Name change (from Ciarnat d'Avignon).\n\nEast, Kingdom of the. Title for Maunch Pursuivant.\n\nThe title is taken from the Order of the Maunch, already registered to the East Kingdom. It is an ancient and honorable tradition to name heraldic offices after orders: Garter and Toison d'Or (Golden Fleece) are well-known medieval examples, while the classic Society example is (ahem) Laurel.\n\nEast, Kingdom of the. Title for Silver Crescent Pursuivant.\n\nThe Order of the Silver Crescent is already registered to the East Kingdom. The Grandfather Clause thus prevents this from being returned for conflict with the Crescent Herald.\n\nEast, Kingdom of the. Title for Troubador Pursuivant.\n\nThe title is taken from the Order of the Troubador, already registered to the East Kingdom.\n\nGareth of Stonemarche. Device. Counter-ermine, on a maunch argent a heart vert.\n\nGary of Dragon's Aerie. Holding name (see RETURNS) and device. Sable, on a pale between two wolves combattant argent a rose slipped and leaved sable.\n\nThis was submitted under the name Drake Greystarr.\n\nGormlaith MacHale. Name.\n\nGuglielmo Migliore di Trentino. Name.\n\nThe given name was submitted as Gugliemo, supposed to be a variant from of Guglielmo. None of the evidence supports this variant; we've substituted the documented form.\n\nJacquetta de Mehun. Device. Azure, in pale three horses courant contourny argent within a bordure embattled Or.\n\nJeanne de Rennes. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nThe byname was submitted as du Rennes. Since du is a contraction of de le \"of the\", it should only be used with placenames that require the definite article. Since Rennes does not, we've substituted the correct preposition.\n\nJohn Blackwolf. Name and device. Argent, a wolf's head erased affronty sable, on a chief gules a cross argent.\n\nJudith of Kirtland. Name (see PENDED for device).\n\nLaurencia du Fond. Name and device. Purpure, a fleur-de-lys and a bordure wavy Or.\n\nLothar the Wanderer. Name and device. Sable, a serpent nowed with a head at either end, on a chief argent three caltraps sable.\n\nOrm of Loch Mor. Name.\n\nPhilippe d'Alsace. Name.\n\nRhodri ap Ithel. Name.\n\nRichenza the Confused. Name.\n\nWhile the name is registerable, perhaps you could interest the submitter in a more period byname: e.g. Mussard \"absent-minded\" or Unsiker \"unsure\".\n\nSaint Swithin's Bog, Shire of. Badge. (fieldless) On a cloud argent, three gouts in fess purpure.\n\nStefan Skywatcher. Device. Per pale sable and argent, in fess three comets counterchanged.\n\nThe heraldic comet is palewise, with its head to chief, by default.\n\nTakashina Nichiro. Name and device. Azure, a torii gate within an orle of cinquefoils argent.\n\nTerry Bedford. Name.\n\nThyri Oddsdottir. Name and device. Azure, a sprig bendwise sinister within a bordure Or.\n\nWolfgang von Wallenhorst. Name.\n\nMERIDIES\n\nArtemesia Leonora Simonetta d'Este. Name .\n\nAs an historical note: this gentle first submitted as Leonora d'Este, which was returned Dec 82 for conflict (since it was the name of a famous scion of the Dukes of Ferrara). She resubmitted as Leonora Simonetta d'Este, which was returned Nov 83 for the same conflict: the addition of the middle name was held to be insufficient difference in this case. She has now resubmitted with two added names, which definitely removes the conflict; but you might inform her that, under the current Rules, Leonora Simonetta d'Este would no longer conflict.\n\nBlackwood, Shire of. Name.\n\nBrand Björnsson. Name.\n\nThe byname was submitted as Bjornson, with a single S. The standard form of the patronymic would be Bjarnarson, but there are examples of Björnsson dating from the 10th Century. We've substituted this documented form.\n\nConall Mac Roigh. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nJean-Pierre de Lyon. Name.\n\nThe byname was submitted as de Lyons. Lyons is the English spelling of the city; the submitter indicated he preferred the French spelling. We've amended the name accordingly.\n\nKatherine of the Garden. Name and device. Per bend sinister vert and Or, a sun in his splendour Or and a daisy purpure.\n\nMarared ferch Gruffydd. Name.\n\nMichael Devlin Mac Mathghamhna. Name and device. Argent, on a chevron cotised sable a plate, a bordure sable platy.\n\nThe patronymic was submitted as Mac Mathghamhain. The particle Mac requires the following word to be in the genitive case; we've corrected the grammar. Please instruct the submitter to draw his cotises much thicker henceforth.\n\nMorgan Rowantree. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nWilliam FitzJohn. Device. Argent, a chevron rompu sable between two trefoils vert and a sheaf of three arrows inverted sable.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting.\n\nMIDDLE\n\nAbiel ben Hiel. Name.\n\nLord Crescent has noted that the only instance of Hiel in the Bible is the name of a man \"cursed before the Lord\"; he suggests that, for this reason, Hiel would never have actually been used in the Middle Ages. In fact, the names of \"cursed\" people in the Bible were often used by the non-cursed, even by saints; it's assumed that the name was perfectly innocent before its use by one wicked person. Judas, for instance, was used both by the betrayer of Christ and by one of the Apostles (John 14:22). There's also Ananias, the name of a man struck dead for lying to Peter (Acts 5:5) and of the disciple who restored Paul's sight (Acts 9:17). There are too many such examples for us to disallow a valid period name solely because of \"guilt by association\"; the name must be shown to be uniquely (or at least overwhelmingly) associated with its \"cursed\" holder. Lacking such evidence for Hiel, the name should be available for SCA use.\n\nÆlfstan le Cygne Gris. Name and device. Vert, a swan displayed argent, a chief enarched Or semy of maple leaves vert.\n\nÆlfwynn Elswith. Name and device. Argent, three wolves' teeth issuant from sinister and in dexter chief a step-cut gem purpure.\n\nThe step-cut gem is found in period jewelry, if not armory; see some of Holbein's portraits of Henry VIII, for instance. Please advise the submitter to draw the gem without its \"glint\" of light. The \"glint\" is an artistic conceit that's only found in the Pictorial Dictionary (and which I intend to remove from the next edition; too many submitters seem to think that glint is mandatory).\n\nAelwyth the Grey. Name and device. Per chevron throughout azure and argent, two stags springing respectant argent and a fir tree eradicated vert.\n\nAffrica nic Pharlain Sidhein Mhoir. Name.\n\nThe byname was submitted as of Sidhean Mor, with the note that the submitter wished the correct Gaelic construction. We've put the place name into the genitive case.\n\n'A'isha bint Khalil al-Herati. Name.\n\nAkiyama Yoshiie. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nAlaric de Navarre. Name and device. Vert, two gores and in chief an eagle's foot Or .\n\nAlaric Gareth Graimere. Name.\n\nAlexander MacIntosh of Islay. Name and device. Per pall sable, gules and argent, in pale an increscent argent surmounted by an arrow fesswise reversed Or, and an owl displayed azure.\n\nThe device is on the very edge of acceptable complexity.\n\nLord Obelisk has noted a Laurel precedent (v. Duncan Forbes of Crathes, LoAR of Nov 90) that disallowed any use of a Scots surname with a Scots toponymic, as it \"implies landedness in possession of a feudal barony.\" I suspect this was not intended to be a permanent change in our policy, which hitherto had disallowed the use of a Scots clan surname with the seat of the clan. Certainly, in the months following the above ruling, we registered Duncan MacFergus of Kintyre (Dec 90, p.7), John MacRobert of Grandloch (Feb 91, p.6), Fergus MacKillop of Skye (April 91, p.5), Gareth MacGunther of Gordon (April 91, p.8), etc. I believe that, in practice if not explicitly, the Nov 90 precedent has been overturned.\n\nMoreover, there is counter-evidence suggesting that Scots surname-toponymic combinations don't necessarily imply possession of a feudal barony. Frank Adams (Clans, Septs and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands) gives an instance (p.402) of a small homestead, about five acres, being sufficient to warrant the addition of the toponymic. Adams notes that clan names could be modified for a number of reasons, not all of which concern nobiliary claims: he cites \"those who, though unconnected by blood with the clan, had become bound to it by bonds of manrent\", and \"those of the clan who were ... distinguished by the name of the part of the clan territory occupied by them\" (p.398). Black (Surnames of Scotland) corroborates this in several of his entries; for instance, on p.xxiv we find two examples (Jhon Mour de Sanchar, Robert Mour de Skeldowy), taken from a guild roster of 1431: non-noble, unconnected to the chief of Clan Muir, but definitely combining a Scots surname with a Scots patronymic.\n\nWe will continue to prohibit the use of a Scots clan name with the seat or territory of that clan (e.g. Cameron of Lochiel), or a surname with the phrase of that Ilk (or its functional equivalent, e.g. Macintosh of Macintosh). That usage, with or without the given name, is the title of the actual chief of the clan or his immediate kin; its use in the SCA represents a direct infringement on actual nobility, and also appears to be a claim to rank, either of which is grounds for return. But by and large, the use of a Scots surname with a Scots placename is acceptable for SCA use.\n\nThere remains the question of whether this submission falls into one of these prohibited categories. While the Macintosh clan does seem to descend from \"Good John of Islay\", Islay is currently the territory of the Clan McDonnell. The only titles for the chief of Clan Macintosh of which I have evidence are Macintosh of Macintosh, or even more succintly, The Macintosh. This submission therefore doesn't appear to be a claim to clan chiefship; it should be acceptable.\n\nAlissandre de Picardie. Name and device. Per pale wavy vert and argent, a caduceus argent and a thistle proper, a chief counterermine.\n\nThe client is a Registered Nurse, and thus may use a caduceus.\n\nAlysandria of the Fosse Way. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nThe byname was submitted as of Fosse Way. The documentation on the Fosse Way always showed it with a definite article; we have therefore inserted it.\n\nAnderewe Fouchier of the White Dove. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nAndrew MacBain the Purple. Name and device. Purpure, a winged sea-unicorn between in fess two rapiers argent.\n\nThe patronymic particle was spelled Mc on the LOI, but Mac on the submitter's forms. Assuming the omission was merely a typo, we've reinserted it.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the rapiers more visibly, and to add a beard to the sea-unicorn. (Both sea-horses and sea-unicorns have webbed forefeet and a fish's tail; most of the characteristics that distinguish a standard unicorn from a horse can't apply. The omission of the beard in this case isn't enough to mandate a reblazon as a unicornate sea-horse, which would be reason for return.)\n\nAnia Dahlbergh. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nAnna Tanner. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nArdal of Stonegrave. Name.\n\nArinwald Rotstein. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nAurildis Peregrina. Name and device. Sable, a falcon argent between three dandelions slipped and leaved Or, on a chief argent three urchins contourny gules.\n\nThe byname was submitted as de Peregrina. The documentation cited in the LOI doesn't support the use of the preposition: peregrinus \"pilgrim\" is an epithet, not a placename or patronymic, so the de is inappropriate. The submitter's forms likewise do not have the preposition; we have therefore deleted it.\n\nAurildis Peregrina. Badge. Per fess sable and gules, a heart argent goutty de sang.\n\nAylwyn of Griffinholme. Name and device. Per bend purpure and vert, a griffin sejant erect Or within a bordure engrailed argent.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the engrailing bolder; as drawn, it's teetering on the edge of unacceptability.\n\nBalthasar of Eastwick. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nBarbara of Caer Anterth. Holding name (see RETURNS) and device. Per chevron azure and vert, a pall inverted erminois between two goblets and a bunch of grapes slipped and leaved Or.\n\nThis was submitted under the name Marisela the Vintner.\n\nBótólfr frá Skógtjörn. Name and device. Per chevron inverted azure and vert, a chevron inverted between a tree blasted and eradicated and a wolf statant argent.\n\nThe byname was submitted as fra Skogtjörn; we've added the appropriate diacritical marks.\n\nBrand the Black. Household name for the Black Company of the Inland Seas.\n\nThe household name is to be associated with the submitter's registered badge: (fieldless) An angel affronty proper, vested gules, winged argent, crined sable, haloed in flames and holding to its breast by their blades two swords in saltire Or.\n\nBrand the Black. Badge. Gules, two staves in saltire between four trillium blossoms argent, barbed vert, a bordure embattled argent.\n\nBrénainn mac Donnchaidh. Name and device. Per chevron wavy vert and Or, two double-axes and a tree eradicated counterchanged.\n\nCaitlyn verch Llewellyn. Name and device. Vert, a lion passant contourny argent within a bordure quarterly sable and argent.\n\nCaitriona Jenne. Device. Per pale azure and vert, a windmill between three candles argent lit proper.\n\nCassandra Eleanora Milano. Name and device. Gules, a tree blasted and eradicated and on a chief Or, three card piques sable.\n\nCassiana of Dracanmor. Name and device. Ermine, a dolphin naiant bendwise gules within a bordure sable.\n\nCatherine de la Rose. Household name and badge for Casa dei Cognoscenti. Azure, a Greek sphinx sejant Or within an orle of plates.\n\nCatherine of Deva. Name and device. Azure, a pavilion between three suns Or.\n\nThe city now called Chester ceased to be called Deva around the time of the birth of Christ; the use of the latter with the name of a 3rd Century martyr is, in Lady Harpy's words, \"screamingly improbable.\" It is, however, the only \"weirdness\" in the name, and we're generally forgiving of such anachronisms.\n\nCeleste Creirwy verch Dafydd. Name and device. Per fess sable and gules, all estencely argent, a mullet of seven points within and conjoined to a decrescent argent.\n\nCodran Bloodaxe. Device. Per pale argent and sable, two battleaxes, blades to center, and a chief all counterchanged.\n\nColleen of Jararvellir. Name.\n\nCollwyn MacErnin Caernarfon. Name and device. Sable, a wolf's head couped within a crescent inverted argent, a bordure argent semy of hearts sable.\n\nThe toponymic was submitted as of Caernarfon, with the submitter's request that it be converted to the correct Welsh form. We have done so, by deleting the of.\n\nConstantine FitzPayn. Name and device. Lozengy argent and vert, on a pale argent a scaling ladder sable.\n\nStriking armory.\n\nConstantine McGuire. Name.\n\nCorydon Rathbone. Name.\n\nCú Ulad Ó Cuileannáin. Name and device. Per pale argent and vert, a stag's head cabossed and on a chief triangular sable, a plate.\n\nThe given name was submitted as Cúulad; however, the documentation shows the name as two words, even in modern usage. We've corrected the spelling to the standard form.\n\nCurnán Wesley MacLeod. Name and device. Per pale sable and gules, a sea-horse naiant and a chief invected argent.\n\nDamán Ponder. Name and device. Gules, a dove rising contourny, wings displayed, sustaining in its beak an arrow bendwise sinister inverted, within a bordure argent charged with double-axes gules.\n\nDamiana of Rookshead. Name and device. Per fess embattled argent and sable masoned argent, three raven's heads erased sable and a mullet argent.\n\nDanahild nic Choluim. Name and device. Per chevron inverted azure and sable, a chevron inverted between a dove volant and three harps argent.\n\nWe've kept the LOI's blazon of the bird as a dove to preserve the cant. However, as drawn, the bird is indistinguishable from any generic bird. The heraldic dove is generally drawn with a small tuft on the head, to assist with identifiability. Please instruct the submitter on the correct depiction of her device.\n\nDaniel of Winchelsea. Name and device. Vert, on a saltire argent, four mullets of four points azure, a chief argent.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the saltire and the mullets larger.\n\nDaniila of Dacia. Name and device. Ermine, a chess knight sable within a bordure vert.\n\nThe Roman province of Dacia (comprising what is today Rumania) kept its name well into the 3rd Century AD, when it was abandoned by the Emperor Aurelian (CLG 480). Its use with a Biblical given name variant doesn't break the bounds of plausibility, though it does stretch them a bit.\n\nThe ermine spots need to be more numerous and prominent. Please instruct the submitter.\n\nDeirdre Colintrie. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nDermot Lachlan MacDermot. Device. Purpure, a shakefork between three thistles argent within a bordure compony argent and gules.\n\nEalasaid ingen Ioan. Name and device. Per saltire Or and argent, a tree blasted and eradicated purpure.\n\nEdward of Bath. Name.\n\nEiric MacBean. Name and device. Per bend sinister Or and azure, a bend sinister argent between two winged lions dormant, that in chief contourny counterchanged.\n\nEirik Grálokkr. Name and device. Per fess azure and sable, on a fess argent, a Viking longship sable.\n\nEleanor MacBeth. Name and device. Argent, a castle triple-towered within an orle of ivy vert.\n\nEleri Langdoun. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nEstrella de La Trinité. Device. Sable mullety argent, a swan naiant Or.\n\nThe heraldic swan is rousant by default. This is therefore clear of Bourgeois (Rietstap), Sable, a swan Or, with a CD for posture and a CD for the mullets.\n\nFabrice le Lion Fou de la Vienne. Name.\n\nThe first byname was submitted on the LOI as le Lion Fol, intended to mean \"the crazy lion\". We've substituted the corrent French Fou.\n\nFinnseach de Lochiell. Name.\n\nGareth of Staggmoor. Name and device. Sable, two stag's heads couped addorsed argent, on a chief embattled Or, a bow sable.\n\nThe OED cites stagg as a variant spelling of stag. While Stagmoor or Stagenmoor would be more probable, this seemed acceptable.\n\nGauselin the Lost. Name and device. Quarterly sable and purpure, a griffin segreant double queued argent, in chief two bars wavy Or.\n\nGerard de Langeleye. Device. Ermine, a lymphad and a chief azure.\n\nThough blazoned on the LOI as in full sail, the lymphad was drawn with its sails furled and oars in action -- its default posture.\n\nGerard von Löwenstein. Device change. Azure, a bend sinister bretessed between two lions passant argent.\n\nHis previous device (Azure, a bend sinister bretessed between an annulet surmounted by a mullet of four points and a lion passant to sinister argent) is released. This is much improved.\n\nGiovanna Costanza. Device. Sable, a fess invected Or, in base a bear passant argent, a chief ermine.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting.\n\nGiovanni Salvatore Di Capua. Name.\n\nThe LOI spelled the toponymic Di Cápua, with an accent. That appears to have been simply an emphasis mark in the dictionary, not part of the city's name; we have therefore deleted it.\n\nGrim Kirk of Greymoor. Name and device (see RETURNS for badge). Purpure, a bend sinister sable fimbriated between a stag's massacre Or and a fleur-de-lys, all within a bordure argent.\n\nGrimmund Blackwing. Name and device. Per pale embattled argent and azure, a triskelion of raven's wings sable and a tankard bendwise sinister inverted argent.\n\nHalldórr Hjálmkljúfr. Name and device. Vert, a spear within an orle argent.\n\nThe byname was submitted as Hjálmkljófari \"helm-cleaver\"; however, it doesn't seem to use the correct conjugation for Old Norse \"cleave\". Following Geirr Bassi's citation of hausakljúfr \"skull-cleaver\", we've corrected the construction.\n\nHilary of Langeforde. Name and device. Vert, a panpipe bendwise sinister Or.\n\nNice, simple armory!\n\nHöskuld Thorleiksson. Name and device. Per chevron throughout wavy Or and purpure, two cups sable and a seal erect ermine maintaining a double axe Or.\n\nWe added the necessary umlaut over the \"o\" in Höskuld (properly Höskuldr).\n\nHugh Prescott. Device. Checky gules and argent, a pair of compasses sable, on a chief Or a cross sable.\n\nIlya Mstislavich. Device. Azure, a foot couped within a bordure argent charged with three trident heads sable.\n\nIngibjörg Thorgeirsdottir. Name.\n\nThe given name was submitted as Ingebjorg, but that spelling didn't quite match the documented forms (Ingeborg, Ingibjörg, Ingeberg). Since the submitter seems to want an Old Norse name, we've substituted the documented Old Norse spelling.\n\nIngrede Haustmyrkr Hrossbjarnardóttir. Name.\n\nIrene the Questing. Device. Sable, a reremouse within a bordure ermine.\n\nIsabel Sinclair. Name.\n\nJames Thomas Seabrig. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nThe OED, under \"bridge\", cites brigge used to mean a bridge of boats, c.1387: \"A roadway supported by boats moored abreast across a stream or other body of water.\" A sea-bridge connecting an island to the mainland is thus not unreasonable.\n\nJean de Beauvoir. Name.\n\nJean Paul Pierrepont. Name and device. Purpure, a chevron vert fimbriated between two fleurs-de-lys and a rose Or.\n\nJean Xavier Devereaux. Device. Per fess gules and argent, a fess Or between five fleurs-de-lys three and two counterchanged.\n\nJohannes Kaspar Zurfluh. Name.\n\nJohn Silvertree. Name and device. Per pale argent and sable, a bend indented per pale gules and argent.\n\nUnder current precedent, this is clear of the arms of Robinson (Papworth 194): Per pale argent and gules, a bend engrailed counterchanged. There's a CD for the field, and per previous rulings (LoAR of Feb 90, p.6), a CD for engrailed vs. indented. See the cover letter for a further discussion of the latter policy.\n\nJonathas Fitche de Abercrombie. Name and device. Per bend sinister gules and sable, a bend sinister Or, overall a bear rampant contourny ermine.\n\nThe bynames are sufficiently differenced from Abercrombie and Fitch (a chain of exclusive camping-gear stores) to no longer be considered either infringement or intrusively modern.\n\nJosceline Levesque. Badge. (fieldless) An aspen leaf azure pierced by a wand bendwise Or.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting.\n\nKarl Arnwulf von Ravensburg. Name and device. Per pale sable and gules, a cross formy between four mullets three and one Or.\n\nKaterina die Hebamme. Name.\n\nKateryn Bronwen of Gloucester. Name and device. Vairy sable and Or, a unicorn rampant argent, on a chief Or three roses purpure.\n\nThe full-sized emblazon shows the unicorn with a lion's tail and a (tiny but visible) beard. You might advise the submitter to emphasize all the unicorn's distinguishing characteristics when she draws this henceforth.\n\nKatharina Nüss. Name and device. Per fess purpure and Or, an acorn within a bordure counterchanged.\n\nThe byname was submitted as Nüb, which was a misreading of the submitter's form: she had submitted Nüß, using the German character \"ess-zett\" (ß). The ess-zett isn't a \"b\", but a double-S. For clarity's sake, we are registering the byname as Nüss, with a double-S; but she may certainly use the ß in private correspondence, if she wishes.\n\nKatherine Lenge. Name.\n\nKiar of Auburn. Name.\n\nKonrad Matthias Jaeger. Device. Or chapé gules, three gouts de sang and in chief a demi-sun issuant from the line of division sable.\n\nThe charges -- most especially the gouts -- need to be drawn much larger. Please instruct the submitter.\n\nKunrad Fuchs. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nLothair the Valiant. Device. Argent, a sword inverted azure between two griffins combatant gules.\n\nThere should be a CD for sword vs. sword inverted, when the primary charge in the device. This is therefore clear of Spalding (Papworth 1102), Argent, a two-handed sword in pale azure.\n\nLothar von Nürnberg. Name.\n\nLynette Jaclyn Davéjean. Name and device. Azure, a dove and on a chief argent, two roses proper.\n\nMartiniana Vinokurova. Name and device. Per bend sinister argent and gules, a grape bunch gules, slipped and leaved vert, and a goblet argent.\n\nThe byname was submitted as Vinokurov, which is the masculine construction; we've substituted the feminine form.\n\nMatthew Aelfwine the Silent. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nMegan Rhys. Name and device. Azure, a pegasus statant argent between three harps Or.\n\nMiddle, Kingdom of the. Title for Evergreen Herald.\n\nMiddle, Kingdom of the. Title for Taurine Pursuivant.\n\nThe title had been submitted as Taurean, which has not been documented as having been used in period: the OED's first citation of the word is 1656. We've substituted Taurine, which has a similiar sound, identical meaning, and is documented within our \"grey area\" (1613).\n\nWhile most heraldic titles in period are nouns (Garter, Lyon), there are a few examples taken from war-cries (Montjoie) and adjectives (Volant). The current submission is not a problem.\n\nMuireann Caitlín ny Phelan. Name and device. Argent, a longbow drawn with arrow nocked sable between three Celtic crosses purpure.\n\nThe byname was submitted as ní Phelan, combining a purely Gaelic particle with an anglicized patronymic. We've changed the spelling slightly, to a fully anglicized form; if the submitter would prefer a fully Gaelic form, we'd suggest ní Fhaoláin.\n\nNechton inn Eyverski Snækolfsson Eyjolfssonar. Name and device. Gules, on a bend sinister vert fimbriated between two boars statant contourny, three equal-armed Celtic crosses palewise Or.\n\nNicodemus of Roaring Wastes. Device. Per pale vert and sable, three crescents conjoined in pall inverted, horns outward, between three nightingales contourny argent.\n\nNigellus le Haie. Badge. Per bend dovetailed gules and azure, two apples Or.\n\nOdd Grimsson. Device. Or, a dolphin naiant vert within a bordure counter-compony vert and Or.\n\nOewyn nic Neill. Device reblazon. Per fess Or and azure, a water lily blossom affronty argent seeded Or.\n\nWhen registered in April 81, the field was misblazoned as Per pale Or and azure, and the water lily was blazoned proper (complete with Latin genus and species). Since we had to correct the blazon of the field anyway, we decided to remove the Linnaean heresy as well.\n\nPádraig McNeil. Device. Argent, a turtle rampant and on a chief vert, three turtles tergiant fesswise argent.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting.\n\nPatrick Angus Flynn. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nRaedmund de Arden. Name.\n\nRaffaello Caccianemico di Aldobrandi. Name and device. Gules, a gore sinister rayonny Or, in dexter chief a dragon's head couped contourny argent.\n\nRaffaello Caccianemico di Aldobrandi. Badge. Gules, a dragon's head erased contourny argent within a bordure rayonny Or.\n\nRagnar Tryggvason. Device. Gules, a valknut inverted Or.\n\nRaphael van Antwerpen. Name.\n\nRichard Makreith. Name and device. Lozengy sable and Or, a yale sejant contourny gules, in base a decrescent argent.\n\nThe byname was submitted as MaKreith, with a capital K; as no documentation for the odd capitalization was given, we have changed it to lower case, as documented. If he truly prefers the capital K, he might consider MacKreith.\n\nRigunth af Bern. Device. Counter-ermine, on a pall Or three crescents vert.\n\nRobert Edouard La Tour. Name and device. Quarterly vert and sable, a tower argent within a bordure argent semy-de-lys sable.\n\nRobert of Dragon's Mark. Holding name (see RETURNS) and device. Argent, two chevronels gules, overall a dirk inverted sable within a bordure embattled gules.\n\nThis was submitted under the name Robert MacGreigor.\n\nRobert of Griffinholme. Name.\n\nRoelof Doldersum. Device. Or, embedded in a tree stump an axe bendwise sinister inverted, on a chief sable three ravens Or.\n\nRoland Silvervale. Household name and badge for House Silvervale. Sable, a decrescent within a bordure argent charged with an orle of holly vert.\n\nRomas the Mapmaker. Name and device. Per fess gules mullety Or, and vert, a dance and in base a terrestrial sphere Or.\n\nRowan Berengier. Name.\n\nSigný of Orkney. Device. Argent, a salamander tergiant sable enflamed proper, on a chief indented azure three Latin crosses flory Or.\n\nSigný Söngvari Svansdóttir. Name and device. Sable estencely Or, six crescents in annulo argent.\n\nStefan Simonovich. Name and device. Argent, a cross-peen hammer bendwise sinister pean.\n\nA striking device [as it were....]\n\nTaichleach Selwyn. Name and device. Or chapé gules, four armored legs sable issuant in saltire from a drum, the legs within and conjoined to an annulet gules.\n\nWhile the LOI gave the given name as Taicheach, the submission forms spelled it as above (and as documented).\n\nTaichleach Selwyn. Badge (see RETURNS for household name). (fieldless) Four armored legs sable issuant in saltire from a drum, the legs within and conjoined to an annulet gules.\n\nThis was submitted as a household badge; however, with the return of the household name, we've registered this as a personal badge.\n\nTatiana Keenan. Device. Per fess purpure and azure, a unicorn argent and a wingless dragon Or combattant.\n\nTeffany Seuerne. Name.\n\nTheodora Jourdain. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nTodd of Northwoods. Holding name and device. Per pale vert and gules, a boar's head couped close argent crowned with a chaplet of thorn vert, between in fess two claymores inverted argent.\n\nThis was submitted under the name Angus Mackinnon, which was returned for conflict Oct 92. We've registered the armory under a holding name.\n\nTóth István. Name and device. Per fess sable and vert, a fess wavy argent between three armored arms fesswise embowed, each brandishing a hammer Or.\n\nThe name was submitted as Istvan Tóth. According to Kálmán's The World of Names, Hungarian names put the surname first; we've corrected the structure of the name accordingly.\n\nUna Wynifreed Berry. Household name and badge for Domus Artium Utilium. Per pale Or and gules, a sun counterchanged, on a chief sable a hammer Or.\n\nThe household name was submitted as Domus Artis Utilis; we've corrected the grammar for the intended meaning of \"House of the Useful Arts\". This isn't an unreasonable name for, e.g., a school; it follows the pattern of the Academia Secretorum Naturae, founded at Naples in 1560 (1911 E.Brit. , vol.I, p.99).\n\nValgard Leifsson. Name and device. Sable, a wyvern displayed and sinister facing Or, charged on each wing with a goblet gules.\n\n[This must be the dragon with the flagon and the chalice from the palace.... ]\n\nWilliam Boag the Hunter. Name.\n\nWulfgar der Krieger. Name and device. Gyronny of six palewise sable and argent, a wolf's head erased contourny Or.\n\nGyronny of six is correctly drawn with one line fesswise, not one line palewise as here (Parker 301; Guillim 366-367). When faced with gyronny of six palewise [sic], I normally attempt to reblazon it as Per pale and per saltire; but that option was not available to me here. I will register this submission using the Society's normal blazon; but henceforth, I intend to insist on correct period emblazons for this field. Pending documentation of its use in period, gyronny of six palewise will no longer be considered acceptable for SCA use.\n\nWulfhere Nordwulf. Name and device. Quarterly sable and azure, two arrows inverted in saltire argent, barbed and flighted Or, surmounted by a sword proper, between in cross four compass stars argent.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the mullets larger.\n\nOUTLANDS\n\nAl-Barran, Barony of. Badge for the Order of the Desert Fawn. (fieldless) A wheel sable charged with a doe lodged guardant Or.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting. Note that the doe is entirely within the bounds of the wheel, making it the equivalent of a tertiary charge, rather than an overall charge.\n\nAleksandrina Petrovna Danilova. Name change (from Freygard Magnusdottir).\n\nAriannah Rose of Bishop's Lynn. Device. Sable, a cross crosslet fitchy and on a chief embattled argent, three roses proper.\n\nCecelia Cormary. Name.\n\nThe byname was submitted as Cormaire, intended to be the anglicization of an Irish Gaelic construction Corr Máire \"Mary's Hill\". Such a construction would require Máire \"Mary\" to be in the aspirated genitive case Mháire; the most likely anglicizations would be Corvarry or Cormary. We've substituted the latter, as being closest to the submitted form.\n\nCerdic of Ælfwida. Name.\n\nThe toponymic was submitted as Ælfwidu, which is the nominative form of the noun. Following the preposition of, it should decline to the dative case; we've corrected the grammar.\n\nChristiana Leigh. Name and device. Per pale vert and argent, a cross flory within an annulet charged with four hearts in cross, all counterchanged.\n\nChristopher Blackwood. Name and device. Erminois, a chevron gules between two trees and a demi-sun issuant from base sable.\n\nThe chevron needs to be drawn with a sharper angle. Please instruct the submitter.\n\nDarius of Jaxartes. Name.\n\nDrahomira Jaroslavovna. Device. Per saltire vert and gules, a fret and overall an oak chaplet, a bordure Or.\n\nFritz von dem Bienenstocke. Name and device. Per bend Or and sable, an anvil between two bees counterchanged.\n\nThe byname was submitted as von Bienenstod, \"of Beehive\", which is ungrammatical, and which misspells the German for \"beehive\", bienenstock. We've corrected the grammar by adding the definite article, and (as it must, following von) declining it to the dative case.\n\nGregor von Münchhausen. Badge. (fieldless) An armored cubit arm fesswise Or sustaining by the tail a wyvern erect gules.\n\nGuillaume Joseph Robert de Bayeux. Name change (from Guillaume Joseph Robert).\n\nInigo Needham Bledsoe. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nJacqueline de Champagne. Name and device. Per pale azure and argent, two horses combattant within a bordure charged with mullets of six points counterchanged.\n\nJulian of Aldeford. Name and device. Vert, two chevronels inverted between a open scroll fesswise argent and three pears Or.\n\nKatya Anna Sylvan. Device. Per chevron throughout purpure and argent, two compass stars argent and a fox sejant gules.\n\nPlease instruct the submitter to draw the fox in a more heraldic style.\n\nLeah de Montgomerie of Lark Hall. Name and device. Per pale azure and argent, on a chevron per pale Or and azure between three vols, five crosses formy floretty all counterchanged.\n\nLeah de Montgomerie of Lark Hall. Badge. On a demi-eagle per pale argent and azure, a cross formy floretty Or.\n\nLêofsige Ó Caoimh. Name.\n\nThe name is acceptable, although not the best style; a more temporally compatible form would be Lêofsige Ua Caím.\n\nMaerwynn Coed y Cwm. Device. Argent, a domestic cat sejant guardant gules between three mullets, a bordure vert.\n\nMark Lasie of Westminster. Augmentation of arms. Per fess gules and sable, a saltire argent, and for augmentation, an escutcheon overall Or charged with a pair of stag's attires sable.\n\nMelisende Barlais d'Outremer. Device. Per bend sinister engrailed argent and azure, two roses proper springing from a single branch vert and two estoiles Or.\n\nNahrun Kabirun, Shire of. Badge (see RETURNS for order name). Azure crusilly flory, on a bend argent five crosses flory azure.\n\nRayner le Falcon. Name (see RETURNS for household badge).\n\nSalim ibn abd al-Rahman al-Rashid. Name and device. Argent, two crescents sable and a fleur-de-lys azure, on a point pointed sable an Arabic ceremonial saddle argent.\n\nThe Arabic ceremonial saddle (qubbah) is a highly stylized charge from Moslem heraldry, according to the article by Lord Clarion in The Islamic World (Complete Anachronist #51, p.63).\n\nSeán ua Néill the Staffmaker. Name and badge. (fieldless) Two wooden staves proper, surmounted by a palmer's scrip Or.\n\nThe byname was submitted as Uí Neall, which uses the nominative case of the father's name. We've corrected the grammar to the genitive case, and put the preposition into the singular instead of the plural.\n\nThis is acceptable under our current standards for overall charges in fieldless badges: the underlying charges are long and skinny, and readily identifiable.\n\nTorcail Gilleghaolain. Device change. Azure, a mouse rampant to sinister Or and in chief three mullets argent.\n\nHis previous device (Azure, a mouse rampant to sinister Or between two apples in bend sinister argent) is released.\n\nVincent John Devereaux. Name.\n\nWilhelmina Martini. Name.\n\nTRIMARIS\n\nJosef of Itil. Name and device. Per chevron embattled argent and azure, two stars of David and a wolf's head cabossed counterchanged.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting.\n\nThurwulf Ragnarsson. Device. Per pale sable and Or, a two-headed raven displayed counterchanged, on a chief triangular gules a sprig of mistletoe argent.\n\nThis had been pended from the Oct 92 meeting.\n\nWEST\n\nAnastasia Pokusaeva. Device. Sable, a spider argent charged with two triangles in pale, points conjoined gules.\n\nTechnically, no, this isn't a black widow spider...\n\nBernard the Nameless. Device change. Counter-ermine, a bicorporate lion argent within a bordure Or.\n\nHis previous device (Per fess rayonny Or and purpure, a bunch of grapes purpure, stemmed and leaved vert, and a sheaf of three stalks of wheat Or) is released.\n\nDonata Ivanovna Basistova. Badge. (fieldless) A cross swallowtailed purpure.\n\nNice, simple badge. I'd grant a CD between this cross and a cross flory or a cross patonce (which were considered the same charge by medieval heralds). I might not have granted difference against a Maltese cross or a cross fourchy, but no conflicts were cited containing such crosses.\n\nDuncan Blackthorne. Name.\n\nGwyneth Catriona McClellan. Name and device. Per bend sinister azure and vert, a bend sinister cotised between a wyvern sejant, wings displayed, and a lion statant argent.\n\nIain MacIain Galloglass. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nMadeline of Hawkscrest. Name and device. Vert, a saltire ermine surmounted by a hawk argent, a bordure ermine.\n\nThe ermine spots seem to have been drawn upside down. Please instruct the submitter on their correct depiction.\n\nMargaret Bellasys of Northumberland. Device. Per pale ermine and azure, on a bend gules three bells palewise Or.\n\nMarion of Sherebrooke. Device. Purpure estencely, a gore sinister argent.\n\nSimple!\n\nPeyre de Barat. Name.\n\nRamón de Castellón de la Plana. Name.\n\nRíoghán Longespee. Name.\n\nSian Llwydwyn. Device. Sable, a dragon displayed and on a chief argent three garden roses sable.\n\nTalon Graymane. Device. Per pale purpure and Or, three wolves' teeth issuant from the dexter flank and three wolves' teeth issuant from the sinister flank, counterchanged.\n\nSiebmacher's Wappenbuch of 1605 shows the arms of von Keudell (plate 135): Argent, a fess vert, in chief three wolves' teeth issuant from dexter and three issuant from sinister sable. The use of wolves' teeth from both sides of the shield seems acceptable, at least in a design as simple as this.\n\nTatiana Todhunter. Name and device. Vert, four hearts in saltire points to center Or.\n\nThe submitter documents period interaction between England and Russia: Ivan the Terrible took some pains to cultivate a friendly relationship with England. He chartered the London-based Muscovy Company in 1555 to set up trading depots throughout Muscovy (Basil Dmytryshyn, Medieval Russia: A Source Book, 900-1700), and himself sought to marry one of Queen Elizabeth's ladies (1911 E.Brit. , vol.xv, p.90). Henceforth, we will register English-Russian names from that period.\n\nThe spelling of the byname is acceptable. However, if the submitter wants to show connection with Gareth Logan Toddhunter -- and comparison of their respective forms suggests such a connection -- one or the other might consider changing their spelling of the surname.\n\nWhile this device is acceptable, it has a small identifiability problem as drawn: it could be misinterpreted as Or, a cross within a bordure [funky] vert. The emblazon would be greatly improved if the hearts were drawn all the same size and shape, with the points being something other than 90° angles. Please instruct the submitter.\n\nTeleri Tawel. Device. Sable, a winged mouse sejant erect, tail nowed in base Or.\n\nThifania Chanson de Champagne. Name.\n\nThomas Longespee. Name.\n\nWilliam de Ness. Device. Argent, a frog statant erect affronty vert holding in its mouth a dagger sable, a chief gules.\n\nZahraa' al-'Amiriya. Name change (from Athena Zahraa' Chandani).\n\nTHE FOLLOWING SUBMISSIONS HAVE BEEN RETURNED:\n\nAN TIR\n\nDavid Falkemeister. Name.\n\nThe correct German for \"master of falcons\" would be Falkenmeister. However, meister (master) is a reserved title in the SCA, and may not be registered -- either alone, or in combination. The submitter might consider resubmitting as Velkner, a period spelling of Falkner \"falconer\".\n\nGiuliana Audaci. Device. Pily bendy wavy sable and argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of de la Warde (Papworth 56), Barry wavy sable and argent; and of Plater (Papworth 291), Bendy wavy of six argent and sable. In each case, there's a CD for the field division, but no more; there would have to be a change in tincture or complex line for the second necessary CD.\n\nATENVELDT\n\nBengta Rolfsdotter. Device. Azure, on a mullet of four points argent, a Viking longship sable.\n\nThis conflicts with the device of Yerek the Inert (SCA), Sable, a mullet of four points voided argent. This could as easily be blazoned Sable, on a mullet of four points argent another sable, and by that blazon the conflict is clearer: there's a CD for the field, but none for change of type of the tertiary charge.\n\nIt also conflicts with the badge of Astra Christiana Benedict (SCA), (tinctureless) On a mullet a cross crosslet. There's a CD for fieldlessness, but nothing for type only of tertiary charge; and we grant no difference between mullet of four points and mullet of five points.\n\nFinally, it conflicts with several mundane armories, such as the arms of Coldham (Papworth 992): Azure, a mullet argent charged with a torteau. There's a CD for the changes to the tertiary charge, but as above, no difference for the number of points on the mullet.\n\nBrangwain Forrestier. Name (see PENDED for device).\n\nBrangwain does not appear to be a valid given name; Morgan & Morgan cites it as a surname only. We need evidence of its use as a period given name before we can register it. We might have substituted a similar name (e.g. Branwen), but the submitter disallowed corrections to her name. Her armory was pended under the holding name Sonya of Stan Wyrm.\n\nGabrielle Antoinette Dubois. Name and device. Per saltire argent and gules, in pale a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy joined in bend and a pine tree couped, a bordure indented sable.\n\nThe indentations on the bordure are too small to be identified from a distance. This must be returned for redrawing, per Rule VIII.3. Should she resubmit with theatrical masks, please instruct her to separate the charges, not have them overlap; they should be distinct charges, to aid identifiability.\n\nHengist of Cantia. Device. Argent, a bend sinister sable between a garden rose gules, leaved vert, and a dragon sejant erect vert.\n\n(The name was returned October 1992.) This conflicts with the arms of Benigni (Woodward 133): Argent, a bend sinister sable. There's a single CD, for the addition of the secondary charges. Additionally, most of the commenters found the garden rose unidentifiable as such; at the least, it needs to be redrawn. He would be even better advised to resubmit with an honest heraldic rose.\n\nHengist of Cantia. Badge. Argent, in pale a garden rose gules, leaved vert, and a dragon statant vert, a bordure gules.\n\nThis conflicts with the badge of the British 42nd Division (MilOrd #674): Argent, a rose of Lancaster [gules], seeded Or, barbed vert, within a bordure gules. There's a CD for addition of the dragon, but none for heraldic rose vs. garden rose.\n\nAdditionally, most of the commenters found the garden rose unidentifiable as such; at the least, it needs to be redrawn. He would be even better advised to resubmit with an honest heraldic rose.\n\nSakura Kita Maikeru. Device resubmission. Sable, a branch of cherry blossoms bendwise within a crescent bendwise sinister inverted conjoined in annulo to a triple-crested wave argent.\n\nThis same submission had been returned July 86 for complexity and lack of blazonability: \"The design is busy, and difficult to to blazon in conventional heraldic terms. Please choose a simpler design.\" The submitter has appealed, documenting each of the elements from Dower's Elements of Japanese Design.\n\nThe appeal, unfortunately, misses the point. The use of these elements had not been in doubt. The reasons for the previous return -- complexity and lack of blazonability -- are still valid, and still grounds for return. Moreover, if the three conjoined charges are considered a single group of charges -- which, since they have equal visual weight, is not unreasonable -- then the current Rules provide a new reason for return, per VIII.1.a.\n\nYou should remind the submitter that simply documenting the charges from Japanese Mon is not necessarily sufficient. The way the charges are arranged must also be acceptable. As was pointed out to him in his first return (LoAR of 17 April 83): \"All mon must be blazonable by European heraldic terminology or they cannot be registered. Japanese personas are visitors registering mon as arms with a European College of Arms.\" We suggest he simplify the design by deleting one of the charges, and rearranging the others in a more symmetrical fashion.\n\nSentinels' Keep, Barony of. Name for the Order of the Vigilant Sword.\n\nThis conflicts with the Order of the Sword, a Swedish order founded 1522 (Franklyn & Tanner 322). Per Rule V.2, the addition of the adjective is insufficient difference.\n\nATLANTIA\n\nCaroline de Chesnei. Device. Azure, on a bend argent between two griffins segreant Or, three acorns palewise azure.\n\nConflicts with Jean-Marc de Folleville (SCA): Azure, on a bend argent between a mace erect and a barrel palewise Or, three fleurs-de-lys palewise azure. There's a CD for the change in type of secondary charge. Since Jean-Marc's secondaries are dissimilar, Rule X.4.j.ii doesn't apply to this case; it requires both the armories under comparison to be simple. We thus cannot grant a CD for the single change (of type) of the tertiary charges.\n\nCathair Dhaibhaidh, College of. Device resubmission. Argent, on a pale azure a plate indented, overall a laurel wreath vert.\n\nThis conflicts with the badge for the King of Caid (SCA): Argent, on a pale azure a crescent argent. There's a CD for the addition of the laurel wreath, but the case is not simple enough for Rule X.4.j.ii to apply; change of tertiary type alone is not enough for the second needed CD.\n\nSome commenters had wondered whether the presence of an overall charge automatically brings a design outside the scope of X.4.j.ii. As currently worded, Rule X.4.j.ii.b applies to \"an ordinary ... accompanied only by a single group of identical charges on the field.\" Overall charges, in most cases, are not considered in the same class as charges on the field: they are separate categories of difference (X.4.b and X.4.c), for instance, and VIII.2.b.i refers to contrast between the field and \"every charge placed directly on it and with charges placed overall\", implying these are separate. Since the Rules don't seem to consider overall charges to be \"directly on the field\", X.4.j.ii.b doesn't apply to overall charges.\n\nLord Owen gives another argument: Rule X.4.j.ii.b only applies if the ordinary is charged, not the accompanying secondary charge. If the secondary charge were to overlie the ordinary, it would crowd the tertiaries and render them harder to identify. That seems to contradict the intended purpose of the Rule, that simple armorial design meet less stringent difference standards. I have to agree with this. The presence of the overall charge prevents this design from being considered \"simple armory\" within the meaning of Rule X.4.j.ii. No CDs can be granted for type alone of tertiary. This remains a conflict with the badge of Caid. They might consider changing the tincture of the tertiary, or of the field.\n\nGodfrey of Huntington. Device. Per pale Or and sable, a griffin segreant counterchanged.\n\nDevice withdrawn by the Principal Herald.\n\nCALONTIR\n\nNone!\n\nEAST\n\nDrake Greystarr. Name.\n\nDrake doesn't appear to be a valid given name. The citation from Hanks & Hodges' Dictionary of Surnames supports only the use of Draca or Draki as given names; the English Drake seems to be solely a byname and surname. Without better evidence, we cannot register it as a given name.\n\nThe submitter's armory was registered under the holding name Gary of Dragon's Aerie.\n\nHelena Janowska z Bedzina. Device. Per pale gules and argent, a fleur-de-lys within a bordure counterchanged.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Flushart (Rietstap): Parti de gueules et d'argent, à une fleur-de-lis de l'un en l'autre (Per pale gules and argent, a fleur-de-lys counterchanged). There's a single CD, for the bordure.\n\nHelena Janowska z Bedzina. Badge. (fieldless) A fleur-de-lys per pale argent and gules.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Flushart (Rietstap): Parti de gueules et d'argent, à une fleur-de-lis de l'un en l'autre (Per pale gules and argent, a fleur-de-lys counterchanged). There's a single CD, for fieldlessness.\n\nIt also conflicts with the tinctureless badge of James III of Scotland (Fox-Davies' Heraldic Badges): A fleur-de-lys. There's a CD for fieldlessness (tincturelessness), but the second CD must come from some category unrelated to tincture.\n\nJeanne de Rennes. Device. Per fess argent and azure, two swans naiant, that in base inverted and contourny counterchanged.\n\nIt was the consensus of the College that the use of the inverted animate charge and hyper-symmetric design is not compatible with period heraldic style. We'd suggest using two swans in their standard posture.\n\nKamilla van Anderlecht. Device. Azure, on a pile argent between two bezants, a red fox salient contourny proper.\n\nAs colored on the submission form, the fox is half tawny orange and half argent. As such, it has insufficient contrast against the argent pile. We suggest she resubmit with a fox gules.\n\nMERIDIES\n\nConall Mac Roigh. Device. Argent mailed sable, a boar statant azure.\n\nThis conflicts with the badge of de Vere, Earls of Oxford (Fox-Davies' Heraldic Badges, p.133): (Fieldless) A boar statant azure. There's a single CD, for the field (including the maily field treatment).\n\nMorgan Rowantree. Device. Purpure, a bend sinister wavy between in chief a fox sejant to sinister and in base a crescent and a crescent inverted Or.\n\nThe wavy line of the bend sinister is not bold enough; it cannot be seen or identified from a distance. This is in itself a reason for return, per Rule VIII.3. When she resubmits, we'd suggest she draw the fox more vulpine, less like a caricature.\n\nThe secondaries are technically not a group of dissimilar charges (\"slot-machine heraldry\"), and not ground for return; however, the design isn't the ideal period style, and would be considerably improved by deleting one of the crescents.\n\nUlf Bjornson. Name\n\nThe byname should be in the documented form Björnsson, with a double-S. However it's spelled, the name conflicts with Wulf Beornsson, registered Sept 88. The two names are cognates, and are audially indistinct.\n\nMIDDLE\n\nAkiyama Yoshiie. Device. Gules, on a \"cherry blossom\" within an octagon voided argent, four katanas in cross, tips to center sable.\n\nThe primary charge looks nothing like a cherry blossom, or indeed like any kind of flower. As drawn in Japanese Mon, the cherry blossom has five petals, each with a notch in the end. As drawn here, the charge looks more like a roundel invected -- with invecting shallow enough to warrant return, were it so blazoned. Please have the client resubmit with an identifiably drawn cherry blossom.\n\nAlysandria of the Fosse Way. Device. Gules, an ounce rampant Or spotted of diverse tinctures, on a chief Or three roses gules.\n\nThis has several conflicts, of which the arms of Gillow are typical (Papworth 106): Gules, a lion rampant Or, on a chief of the last three fleurs-de-lis of the first. There's a CD for the changes to the tertiary charge group. The creature is not a panther, as blazoned on the LOI (for it isn't incensed of flame), but an ounce or maneless lion. As such, it gets no difference from a standard lion; and its spots here count for no more than the spots on any other spotted cat (e.g. a natural leopard). If she resubmits with a genuine panther, charged with large roundels -- better yet, with a Continental panther -- it should be clear of these conflicts.\n\nAnderewe Fouchier of the White Dove. Device. Per chevron Or and sable, two wood planes in chevron and a bear dormant contourny counterchanged.\n\nAs has been noted in the past, the dormant posture should be used cautiously, as it all too often obscures the beast's head, tail and feet, rendering it unidentifiable. That's the case here: the bear is indistinguishable from a \"meatloaf\". This must be returned for redrawing.\n\nWhen he resubmits, please instruct the submitter to supply documentation for the wood plane. As his submission would be the defining instance of the charge, we need some evidence of this form in period. My quick check of a handy source (Singer et al, A History of Technology, vol.II, pp.230-231 and plate 30-A) showed period planes rather more like the modern form than the form shown here.\n\nAnia Dahlbergh. Device. Argent, a goblet sable with ribbons issuant from its mouth gules, within an orle of grapevine proper.\n\nThis conflicts with Cleuere (Papworth 676), Argent, a cup covered sable. There's a CD for the vine, but the \"maintained\" ribbons count for no difference.\n\nAnna Tanner. Device. Per chevron sable and vert, two mullets and a crescent argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Clerc (Rietstap): D'azur à deux étoiles (5) d'argent en chef et un croissant du même en pointe (Azure, two mullets [of five points] and a crescent argent). There's a single CD, for the field.\n\nArinwald Rotstein. Device. Vair, a tower and on a chief dovetailed gules, three eagles displayed Or.\n\nThe dovetailing on the chief is drawn far too small to be identifiable from any distance. This must be returned, per Rule VIII.3.\n\nBalthasar of Eastwick. Name and device. Per bend sinister Or and azure, a wingless dragon displayed and facing sinister sable.\n\nThe displayed posture is not applicable to non-winged creatures, just as rampant is no longer applicable to birds (LoAR of May 91). No other blazon adequately describes this posture (although if the dragon's back were to the viewer, instead of its belly, it might be tergiant).\n\nMoreover, since the dragon's posture (however blazoned) is indistinguishable from tergiant, this conflicts with the badge of the Barony of Bhakail (SCA): Or, a natural salamander tergiant sable. There's a CD for the field, but putting the dragon in this posture greatly reduces any difference to be granted for type of reptile.\n\nCathan MacCullaich. Device. Sable, on a chief dovetailed argent, in pale a pineapple inverted and a bar vert.\n\nUnfortunately, even in the full-sized emblazon, the charge on the chief was not identifiable as a pineapple. Laurel's staff couldn't tell whether the submitter intended the period meaning of the term (= \"pine cone\") or the modern meaning (= spiky fruit from Hawaii); we couldn't even tell if it was inverted or not.\n\nAssuming the submitter intended the period meaning of the term, we suggest he redraw this so that the pine cone, and its posture, can be identified. Better still would be a slight redesign, using three pine cones and deleting the bar on the chief.\n\nCatlin Elisabeth Feverfalke. Name.\n\nThe byname is German for \"fire hawk\", which doesn't seem to match period exemplars for bynames. In the recent case of Gaius Firehawk MacLeod (LoAR of Jan 93), Firehawk was acceptable only because of its meaning of \"proud hawk\" (fire is an alternate spelling of ME fere, \"proud\"). No such justification can apply to the current submission; it can only mean \"hawk [made] of fire\", a highly suspect meaning. We have no evidence that a bird made of flame is a reasonable period concept -- even the phoenix was only issuant from flame, not composed of it -- and we need such evidence before we can register the epithet.\n\nCatriona nicHugh McLae. Device change. Argent, three cinquefoils and a chief wavy azure.\n\nThe flowers were blazoned on the LOI as gillyflowers, but were drawn as cinquefoils. Under that blazon, this conflicts with the arms of Chokke (Papworth 871): Argent, three cinquefoils azure. There's a single CD, for the chief.\n\nDaniel de Lincoln. Badge. (fieldless) A cross nowy couped argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the badge of the George Cross, founded by King George VI in 1940: A cross couped surmounted by a medallion silver. There are inscriptions in the formal medallion, which contribute no difference in this case. (The informal medallion, hung from a chest ribbon, hasn't even the inscriptions: it's simply a cross surmounted by a plate.) The Cross is described by Franklyn & Tanner, p.146; and as the order's name is on our list of Protected Orders, in fairness the order's badge should be equally protected.\n\nDeirdre Colintrie. Device. Azure, a dexter hand fesswise reversed, palm to chief argent, maintaining a flame gules fimbriated Or, between four escallops in cross, hinges to center argent.\n\nThe flame was blazoned on the LOI as proper, but it is fact gules fimbriated Or. Such fimbriation of complex charges is disallowed, per Rule VIII.3. Also, the cupped hand is not in a particularly recognizable posture.\n\nSome commenters wondered whether the central charge could be considered a hand of glory, which isn't permitted in Society heraldry. The hand of glory is essentially a hand on fire: it's usually seen apaumy, and issuant small flames (especially at its fingers). The hand shown in this submission is simply holding a flame, and is not a hand of glory.\n\nEleri Langdoun. Device. Argent, a pale dovetailed vert, overall a raven maintaining a chasing hammer argent hafted sable.\n\nThe device has two problems of identifiability. First, the argent chasing hammer has insufficient contrast with the argent field. While \"held\" charges are not held to the Rule of Contrast as strictly as most charges, they still may not share a tincture with the field. Second, the dovetailed line on the pale is too small to be visible from a distance -- a problem exacerbated by the overall charge obscuring the line. This must be returned.\n\nWhile I would consider dovetailed to be negligibly different from embattled, I'd grant it a CD from urdy (champaine). This is therefore clear of Bowman (Papworth 1003), Argent, a pale champaine vert.\n\nGerrich de la Foy. Device. Or, a gopher rampant and on a chief vert, a chalice between two Latin crosses Or.\n\nWe have no evidence that the gopher was known to period Europeans: the OED, for instance, dates gopher in this context only to 1818. (There's also the Biblical gopher-wood, but that doesn't apply to this submission.) Since the gopher is a rodent from the North American plains, we can't automatically assume that it was known to period Europeans; we need some hard evidence before we can accept the charge.\n\nGregorius Hlaehtorunhold. Name.\n\nHlaehtorunhold doesn't seem to follow any known period pattern for Old English bynames. It was stated to mean \"laughter not in the proper order of the world\"; but that is neither a reasonable epithet, nor the actual meaning of this byname. It seems to be simply a portmanteau word combining the Old English for \"laughter\", negation, and \"gracious\", which makes it a questionable construction. Given Lord Palimpsest's citations of beadurôf \"battle-bold\" and dômgeorn \"glory-eager\", this byname might possibly be stretched to mean \"laughter-disliking\" -- but that's a far leap to make without more solid documentation.\n\nGrim Kirk of Greymoor. Badge. Purpure, a fleur-de-lys argent within a stag's massacre Or.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Höger (Rietstap): De gueules à une fleur-de-lys d'argent posée entre les cornes d'un massacre de cerf d'Or (Gules, a fleur-de-lys argent within a stag's massacre Or). There's a single CD, for the field.\n\nJacobine the Fairhaired. Name.\n\nThe documentation in the LOI cites Jacobin as a surname, not a given name. Since jacobine is also a common noun in English, we need solid evidence of its use as a given name before we can register it as such. She might consider resubmitting as Jacoba Fairhare, which has the same meaning in documented ME forms.\n\nJames Thomas Seabrig. Device. Argent, on a bend between two Catherine wheels sable, a Catherine wheel argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Riddall (Papworth 256): Argent, on a bend sable three Catherine wheels of the first. There's a CD for adding the secondaries; but changing the tertiaries' number is not, by itself, worth a CD under Rule X.4.j.\n\nJohn Skinner of Rivenstar. Badge. (fieldless) Two straight trumpets in saltire, bells in base argent.\n\nThe use of two straight trumpets in saltire is reserved to the seals of Principal Heralds, and has been since at least 1983. It is the motif itself that's reserved; changes of tincture, addition of charges, or (as here) inversion of the trumpets, don't affect the reservation of that motif, any more than they affect the reservation of crowns to the armory of royal peers.\n\nKeja Tselebnik. Name and device. Azure, an owl displayed within two concentric annulets argent.\n\nNo documentation was presented to support the use of Keja as a given name -- not even a quote from the cited source, let alone photocopies. None of the commenters could provide documentation for Keja; without such documentation, the name cannot be registered.\n\nThe device has multiple conflicts, notably the arms of Cayne (Papworth 298), Azure, an eagle displayed argent, and Wampage (Papworth 316), Azure, an eagle displayed within a double-tressure argent. In each case, there's a CD for addition (or change) of the secondary charges, but none for type of raptor in similar postures.\n\nShould she resubmit with an owl displayed, please instruct her to draw it in the true heraldic posture of displayed, not in the \"striking affronty\" posture of this submission.\n\nKunrad Fuchs. Device. Argent, a bend sinister azure between two fox's masks per pale Or and gules.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Kabbel (Rietstap): D'argent à une barre d'azure (Argent, a bend sinister azure). There's a single CD for the addition of the fox's masks.\n\nMarisela the Vintner. Name.\n\nThe given name was submitted as a variant of a feminized form of the Spanish masculine name Maricel. Unfortunately, the latter would not be pronounced with a hard S, according to Putnam's Spanish-English Dictionary: the CE combination is pronounced almost like a soft THE, with a lisp. We could accept the documented Marsella, or a hypothetical Maricela, but not a variant of a hypothetical that changes the pronunciation. The submitter permitted no corrections to grammar or spelling; however, as she did permit a holding name to be formed, her armory was registered under the name Barbara of Caer Anterth.\n\nMatthew Aelfwine the Silent. Device. Per bend purpure and Or, a five-man morris board counterchanged.\n\nAs drawn, this is not a five-man morris board: it's the markings from a five-man morris board. The board would be essentially a delf (with artistic markings); the markings alone are unheraldic. Even under our relaxed standards of voiding, this is unacceptably \"thin-line heraldry\", returnable under Rule VIII.3.\n\nFYI: Lord Dolphin has found evidence that the markings on this device belong to a six-man morris board, not five. He cites R.C. Bell's Board and Table Games From Many Civilizations, Volume 1, p.93. If the submitter has evidence of the board's use in five-man morris, we'd be interested in a copy.\n\nPatrick Angus Flynn. Device. Azure, on a bend sinister argent between a standing balance and an open book Or, three keys palewise sable.\n\nThis conflicts with Michael Anwyl (SCA): Azure, on a bend sinister argent between two suns Or, three pheons palewise inverted sable. Patrick's submission uses dissimilar charges around the bend, so it doesn't qualify as \"simple armory\" per the definition of Rule X.4.j.ii; therefore, change in type alone of tertiaries is not worth a CD. The only difference that can be granted is for type of secondaries.\n\nWhen he resubmits, please instruct him not to draw the book in trian aspect (three-quarter view); that alone is grounds for return.\n\nRobert MacGreigor. Name.\n\nConflicts with Robert MacGregor (b.1671), better known as Rob Roy. Since his name is found in general references (e.g. Webster's Biographic Dictionary, p.635), he is important enough to protect. The submitter's armory was registered under the holding name Robert of Dragon's Mark.\n\nTaichleach Selwyn. Household name for The Caravan.\n\nThe household name runs afoul of Rule III.1, which requires all names to have at least two name elements; group names must have a designator and \"at least one descriptive element\" (III.1.b). To put it another way, the name is too generic to be reserved to a single group. Just as we would decline to register The Household or The Group -- or, just as we declined to register The Buttery (Marion of Edwinstowe, LoAR of April 89) -- so must we return this name. If they add a descriptive element (and assuming no conflicts), it should be acceptable.\n\nTheodora Jourdain. Device. Sable, on a lozenge Or a lozenge purpure charged with a fleur-de-lys Or.\n\nThis was blazoned on the LOI as Or, on a lozenge purpure a fleur-de-lys Or, all within a bordure sable. However, the equal-width parallel stripes gave an overwhelming appearance of a sable field and a gold lozenge charged with a purple lozenge, charged with a fleur. (Since the black stripe is as wide as the gold stripe, the former can hardly be a bordure, and the latter can't very well be fimbriation.) As such, the device must be returned for the use of a quaternary charge. We'd suggest redrawing this to make it clear that the Or \"stripe\" is, in fact, the field.\n\nWulfhere Nordwulf. Household name for Haus von den Nordwulfs.\n\nNo forms for the submission were included. Without forms, it must be returned.\n\nThe household name would be better as either Haus von den Nordwülfen or Haus der Nordwülfe. You might pass that on to the submitter.\n\nOUTLANDS\n\nAedhán Brecc. Device. Vair, on a bend Or a wolf passant sable.\n\nThis conflicts with the device of William of Jutland (SCA): Vair, on a bend Or a label of seven points sable. It also conflicts with the mundane arms of Norman McCaskie (Lyon Ordinary II, p.26): Vair, on a bend Or three crosses urdée gules. In each case there's a single CD, for the changes to the charges on the bend.\n\nIt also conflicts with the device of Ceri of Glanymorniwi (SCA): Potent in point, on a bend Or in chief a garden rose slipped and leaved azure. Again, there's a CD for the changes to the tertiary charge; but we grant no difference for the artistic distinctions among the vair-type furs. That is, no difference for vair vs. vair ancient (indeed, we don't even blazon this, leaving it to the artist), no difference for vair vs. potent, no difference for vair in pale vs. vair in point vs. counter-vair, etc.\n\nAurora Gillybary. Device. Purpure semy of compass stars, a moon in her plentitude argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Baillie de Walstoun (Rietstap): Azure, a moon in her plenitude between nine mullets of eight points, rays adorned at the angles, three, two, three and one argent. There's a CD for the field, but no difference for type of mullets -- and Baillie's mullets are negligibly different from a semy.\n\nCala of Savatthi. Device resubmission. Gules, in pale a butterfly and a lotus flower in profile argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of Rancrolles (Rietstap): Gules, a butterfly argent, marked sable. There's a CD, for adding the lotus flower.\n\nThe blazon on the LOI had omitted the tincture of the charges. Normally, the submission would be pended to allow for commentary under the correct blazon; however, having discovered the above conflict, it seemed unfair to make the submitter wait longer than needful. We regret not having noted this conflict during her previous submission.\n\nDragonsspine, Barony of. Badge. (fieldless) On a triangle inverted Or, a dragon's head cabossed purpure.\n\nIf a charge can be considered a medium for heraldic display, it may not bear a tertiary in a fieldless badge: such a design is interpretable as a display of arms, with the tertiary as a primary. For instance, we don't permit (fieldless) On a lozenge argent a fleur-de-lys gules: since the lozenge is a medium for heraldic display, this looks like a display of Argent, a fleur-de-lys gules. Such arms-badge confusion is reason enough for return, even if the display in question doesn't conflict. In this case, the triangle inverted must be considered such a medium, comparable to the escutcheon, lozenge, or roundel. It may be considered either an early-style shield (Neubecker's Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meanings, p.76), or a lance-pennon.\n\nMoreover, considered as a display, on a triangular shield, of Or, a dragon's head cabossed purpure, this conflicts with the badge for the Exchequer of the Kingdom of the East (SCA): Or, a dragon's head couped purpure. There is a single CD, for the head's posture.\n\nFaustina von Schwarzwald. Badge. (fieldless) A demi-reremouse displayed and sinister facing Or issuant from a joscelyn fesswise argent and sable, belled Or.\n\nThe College does not register crests (LoAR of 20 Sept 81), partially to avoid having to decide who may or may not be entitled to them, and partially to save ourselves work. This submission is a crest by virtue of its being set atop a torse. (A joscelyn is simply a torse with bells added. On a \"joscelyn fesswise\", those bells are invisible, and count for nothing.) The submitter may certainly register a standard fieldless badge, which she may use as she pleases; but we cannot register this crest.\n\nGerome of Heyswyndon. Device. Per bend gules and purpure, a dragon couchant contourny, saddled and wings displayed argent, maintaining in its forepaws a harp, in chief a flute fesswise Or.\n\nThere are two problems with the submission. First, the dragon is not in an heraldic posture: it isn't truly couchant, but closer to couchant bendwise sinister [sic]; and its wings aren't truly displayed (since the tops, not the undersides, are shown). The dragon needs to be redrawn in a standard heraldic posture.\n\nSecond, this contains too many references to Pern, the world of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonrider series. Pern has a technology advanced well beyond that compatible with the SCA's period. The white dragon, saddled for a dragonrider, with the symbols of the Harper Hall, all combine to form an inescapable Pernish reference.\n\nInigo Needham Bledsoe. Device resubmission. Per chevron wavy azure and gules, a pig rampant to sinister, its dexter hind limb a peg-leg argent.\n\nThe complex line of division is not visible from any distance: the waves are not drawn boldly, and the pig obscures the division between the two dark tinctures of the field. This must be returned, per Rule VIII.3.\n\nSeveral commenters wondered whether the porcine prosthesis was compatible with period armory. I consider this on a par with the arms of Finland (Gules semy of roses argent, a lion rampant crowned Or, its dexter limb an armored arm brandishing a sword, standing atop a scimitar fesswise reversed argent). There should be no problem with the peg-leg.\n\nLachlan O'Sheridan of Falconhold. Badge. Per pale Or and sable, a monster composed of the body of a horse with lion's feet rampant purpure.\n\nWhile newly-invented chimerical monsters are usually permitted, they must be recognizable in all their parts. This monster is unidentifiable, and so unacceptable. Half the monster has extremely poor contrast against the black half of the field. The part with good contrast, against the gold half of the field, has its outline obscured by the non-standard stylization of the mane. That might not have been fatal, had this been a horse or a lion; but when the creature is a composite of the two, identifiability is paramount. This must be returned.\n\nLeah Kasmira of Natterhelm. Blazon correction. Gules, a cat-a-mountain couchant guardant, tail reflexed to base Or, orbed vert, within a bordure vair ancient.\n\nThe submitter wishes her device's blazon to specify the exact placement of the cat's tail. (She's also added the tincture of the eyes, which isn't in the current blazon, registered 31 Oct 82.) While I sympathize with the submitter's wish to have her emblazon rendered as she prefers, this can't be done at the expense of correct blazonry. The posture of the tail is heraldically insignificant; moreover, the proposed reblazon doesn't use standard heraldic terms. Reflexed to base is not to be found in Parker, Franklyn & Tanner, Woodward, or any of our normal texts; nor is it found in the OED. As Lord Crescent noted, it seems pointless to \"clarify\" a blazon with an ambiguous phrase. This seems to be a problem more easily solved by communication with the artists than by torturous reblazon.\n\nMedhbh O'Duibhdabhoireann of Clontarf. Badge resubmission. (fieldless) A reremouse azure.\n\nThis still conflicts with the Mon of Komori Yamamoto (Hawley 57): Dark, a bat light. The Mon being considered equivalent to a tinctureless seal, there is a single CD for fieldlessness; but the second CD must come from some change other than tincture. Just as with her previous submission, this must be returned.\n\nNahrun Kabirun, Shire of. Order name for Le Garde Méridional.\n\nThe name must be returned for two reasons. First, we received no submission forms for this name. Second, if this indeed a \"secondary [?] order name\", as stated in the LOI, then the Shire may not register it: only branches with ceremonial heads (Baronies, Principalities and Kingdoms) may register orders and awards. This follows from the section of Corpora (VII.B.4) that permits only royalty and Territorial Baronage to bestow awards.\n\nPlease note that, as submitted, the name means \"the Southern Guardsman\". The French for \"the Southern Guard\" (i.e. a corps of watchmen) would use the feminine: la Garde Méridionale.\n\nOutlands, Kingdom of the. Badge. Vert, a stag's attires Or surmounted by a rapier argent.\n\nThis conflicts with the arms of van der Haeghen (Rietstap): De sinople à une ramure de cerf d'or (Vert, a stag's attires Or). There's a single CD, for the addition of the overall charge.\n\nRayner le Falcon. Household badge; to be held jointly with Christiana Leigh. Or, a hammer inverted issuant from chief sable.\n\nConflicts with Olaf Brunharet Magnusson (SCA): Or, in pale a Thor's hammer sable and an ape passant proper. There is a single CD, for the removal of the ape. Since a Thor's hammer is inverted by definition, we get no difference for posture of the hammer -- and issuance from chief is worth no difference in this case.\n\nUnwod the Lapp. Name and device. Vert, a water lily in profile argent.\n\nUnwod is not a given name, but an epithet meaning roughly \"unfrenzied\". No evidence was supplied to show it was used as a given name, and without such evidence we can't register it as a given name. As for the byname, there was some concern that the term was uncomplimentary -- the OED compares Lapp to the MHG lappe \"simpleton\" -- but that's a matter for the submitter and his persona. More to the purpose is the fact that Lapp, as an English term (which it must be, following the English article the) can be dated in the OED only to 1859. The period English terms for a Laplander are Lappian (1599), Lapponian (1607), and possibly Laplander (1637).\n\nThe device has multiple conflicts, of which the closest is the device of Katja Dara (SCA): Per chevron vert and sable, a lotus flower [in profile] argent. There's also the device of Arabella Cleophea Winterhalter (SCA): Purpure ermined Or, a lotus blossom in profile argent. In each case, there's a CD for the field, but nothing for type or posture of flower.\n\nAgainst the badge of India (Fox-Davies' Heraldic Badges, p.117), [fieldless] A lotus argent, a check of the annotated edition of his Complete Guide to Heraldy suggests that the lotus is affronty in that badge; we get a CD for the field and a CD for posture. Against the device of Oewyn nic Neill, reblazoned elsewhere on this LoAR (Per fess Or and azure, a water lily blossom affronty argent seeded Or), a similar point count holds. Finally, against the device of Sibylla Penrose of Netherhay, registered July 92 (Vert, an octofoil argent), I'd give a CD for type and a CD for posture of the flower; I'm less certain of this call, however, and would be willing to entertain arguments either way. (Not that such arguments are needed in this case.)\n\nWEST\n\nGarrett Logan Toddhunter. Device. Per pale azure and gules, a ram's head couped affronty Or.\n\nThis conflicts with Perrot de Traonvilin (Rietstap): Sable, a ram's head cabossed Or. There's a single CD, for the field.\n\nIain MacIain Galloglass. Device. Or, a saltire wavy sable between four arming buckles gules.\n\nConflicts with the arms of Tacquet (Rietstap): Or, a saltire wavy sable. There's a single CD for the secondary charges.\n\nNihonyama, Port of. Name and device. Per fess wavy Or and azure, a cormorant volant to sinister sable and a laurel wreath Or.\n\nName and device submission withdrawn by the Principal Herald.\n\nStanislaw Jan Ossolinski. Badge appeal. (fieldless) A cross \"formy convexed\" argent, charged in each arm with a crescent sable.\n\nThis badge had been returned on the LoAR of May 92 for lack of documentation on the type of cross. (It had been blazoned in the previous submission as a cross formy globate, which term we couldn't find in any of our references.) The submitter has appealed that return, providing evidence of this cross as an artistic motif on a suit of armor c.1630. The term \"convexed\", referring to the bulge of the outer edges of the cross's limbs, is documented in Elvin's Dictionary of Heraldry.\n\nUnfortunately, my main concerns about this cross remain unaddressed. It's not readily blazonable: as drawn, it resembles a roundel with four semi-elliptical notches, not a variant of a cross formy. It's been documented only to within our 50-year \"grey area\", and only as an artistic motif, not an heraldic charge. The only terms that adequately describe it are found in a 19th Century work, compiled by an author whose lack of scholarship is legend. I simply have no grounds for believing this cross to be compatible with period heraldic style.\n\nThis cross has been submitted before, and returned for the above reasons; v. Jamys Ellyn Rothesay of Bannatyne Hall, LoAR of Sept 92, p.49. I'm tempted, I admit, to simply give the cross its own SCA name. (In the immortal words of Baldwin of Erebor, \"Spring is in the air, and the fit is upon me; let me name but one cross before I die!\") But this would do no service to the heralds and scribes who will follow us; we need some assurance that any blazon we devised would be reconstructable. In this case, at the very least we'd need to find this cross mentioned by name in some accessible reference. Failing that, or better evidence that it's a period motif, I must continue to return it.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING SUBMISSIONS HAVE BEEN PENDED:\n\nATENVELDT\n\nSonya of Stan Wyrm. Holding name (see RETURNS) and device. Per chevron throughout vert and argent, two arrows argent and a raven's head erased sable.\n\nThis was submitted under the name Brangwain Forrestier. That name could not be registered, nor did the submitter permit corrections. She does permit a holding name to be formed, but holding names are only used to permit the registration of armory. This armory cannot be registered, because we haven't received an archive copy of the submission.\n\nThis is pended to the July 93 meeting, to allow the Atenveldt College to forward the necessary paperwork. If all goes well, it will then be registered under the holding name Sonya of Stan Wyrm.\n\nEAST\n\nJudith of Kirtland. Device. Per pale vert and azure, an angel argent between in fess two annulets and in base a third Or.\n\nThe angel was blazoned on the LOI as proper, but in fact its flesh, vestments and wings are all argent. (Its hair is Or, but that's a mere artistic detail.) This is pended to the July 93 meeting, to allow for commentary under the correct blazon.\n\nMIDDLE\n\nRobert of Bristol. Device. Or, a horse's head erased between three horseshoes inverted sable, all within a bordure gules.\n\nThe bordure was inadvertently blazoned sable on the LOI. This is pended to the July 93 meeting, to allow for commentary under the correct blazon.\n\nYamamoto Yashinobu. Name.\n\nThe second name was spelled Yoshinobu on the LOI, and documented in that spelling; but the submission forms spell the name Yashinobu, and a call to Lord Dragon confirmed that this was the submitter's desired spelling. This is pended to the July 93 meeting, to allow the Midrealm College to document the correct spelling of the name.\n\nReturn to the LoAR Index Page"
