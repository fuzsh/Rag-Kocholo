        "text": "Christian McCaffrey is a full-blown first-team All-Pro in his first full season away from the Carolina Panthers.\n\nOn Friday, the Associated Press announced its 2023 All-Pro squads. And headlining the first team as one of three unanimous selections is McCaffrey, who had himself a stellar campaign for the NFC’s No. 1-seeded San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMcCaffrey led the entire NFL with 1,459 rushing yards, a total that also accounts as a new career-high. The 27-year-old also led all players in touches (339), yards from scrimmage (2,023) and total touchdowns (21) while setting a few more career-bests in yards per carry (5.4), first downs (114) and receiving scores (seven).\n\n2023 marked McCaffrey’s first full campaign with the 49ers, whom acquired the multi-threat back in a trade with the Panthers in the middle of last season. The deal netted Carolina second-, third- and fourth-round picks in the 2023 NFL draft and a fifth-round pick in 2024.\n\nHere’s what the haul has turned into thus far:\n\n2023 61st overall pick: Traded to Chicago for the rights to the first overall pick (quarterback Bryce Young)\n\n2023 93rd overall pick: Traded to Pittsburgh for the rights to the 80th overall pick (linebacker DJ Johnson)\n\n2023 132nd overall pick: Traded to Pittsburgh for the rights to the 80th overall pick (linebacker DJ Johnson)\n\n2024 fifth-round pick: TBD\n\nMcCaffrey has now earned two first-team All-Pro nods in his seven-year career. The first was bestowed upon in 2019, when he became just the third player in league history to amass a season of at least 1,000 rushing yards and 1,00 receiving yards.\n\nOh, and in case you didn’t figure it out already, the Panthers did not have any All-Pro selections from this season."
