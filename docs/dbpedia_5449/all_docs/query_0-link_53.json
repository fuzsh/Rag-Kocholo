The HD SUV is a purpose-built 4-wheel drive system based on existing sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks. It is equipped with a 6.2-liter V8 engine as well as specialized power steering and front coil-cover shock features. “Announcing this [memorandum of understanding] is a key step for Jankel as we continue to grow our global footprint in the defense and security vehicle space,” Jankel Chairmen Andrew Jankel said. 👉 Get the read: https://lnkd.in/dfZA2mAn #military #technology #innovation #defense #defence #defenseindustry #defenceindustry\n\nThe United States Department of Defense is actively exploring the use of electric vehicles (EVs) for various applications, from tactical vehicles to ground power units. The article highlights how the military is drawn to the advantages of EVs, such as their quiet operation, low heat signature, and reduced maintenance requirements, which can provide an edge on the battlefield. The military is partnering with automakers like GM to develop prototypes like the electric Infantry Squad Vehicle (eISV) and the electric Humvee (eMCV). The Air Force Research Laboratory is collaborating with GM Defense to create an all-electric ground power unit that can power aircraft without using a generator, demonstrating the military's interest in incorporating EV technology. However, the article also notes that the current limitations of EV technology, such as the heavy and bulky infrastructure required for power generation and charging, as well as the fire risk associated with lithium batteries, present challenges for the widespread adoption of EVs in tactical military applications. #MilitaryEVs #TacticalVehicles #AltEnergyDefense #FutureofMilitaryTech #MilitaryAutoInnovation\n\nExciting news from Rolls-Royce at the Eurosatory defense trade fair! They've unveiled a revolutionary hybrid diesel engine designed to make armored vehicles more efficient and stealthier. The new mtu Series 199 hybrid drive puts out over 1,100 kW (1,475 hp) and allows vehicles to run on battery power, reducing noise and heat signatures. This makes the vehicle much quieter and greatly reduces its heat signature, enhancing camouflage and mission range. Additionally, the hybrid engine improves fuel consumption and provides more electric power for future systems like energy weapons. At low speeds, the vehicle is quieter, especially with Rolls-Royce's new customized silencer. At higher speeds, the electric drive combined with the diesel boosts acceleration. Christian Wolf, Head of Development for Military Engines and Systems at Rolls-Royce Power Systems, states, \"This propulsion concept will expand the operational possibilities of future tracked armored vehicles in a way that was previously hardly imaginable.\" Rolls-Royce continues to push the boundaries of military technology, promising a quieter, more efficient, and stealthier future for armored vehicles.

𝗔𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿: 𝗧𝘄𝗼. No, it's not a sci-fi flick or a Photoshop trickery. It's the real deal, and it's straight out of the engineering marvels book. Brace yourselves for this revelation: The U.S. Navy has been catapulting trucks off an aircraft carrier into the open waters. Yes, you heard that right! At first glance, it's hard to believe. It's a spectacle that almost seems too surreal to be true. These trucks catapult off the edge of the colossal USS Gerald R. Ford. So, what's the story behind this display of engineering marvel? The U.S. Navy was putting the catapult system of the USS Gerald R. Ford to the test. This cutting-edge aircraft carrier is the first of its kind, equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system, a significant departure from the older steam-powered launch systems used by Nimitz-class carriers. Ensuring the reliability of this technology. Intriguingly, this video isn't recent; it goes back to the summer of 2015. But regardless of the date, what truly matters is the incredible display of engineering prowess. It's a testament to human ingenuity and innovation, showcasing how we continually push boundaries. #engineering #innovation #usa #aircraft\n\nThe Hybrid Air Vehicles Airlander 10 (originally developed as the HAV 304; nicknamed \"The Flying Bum\") is a hybrid airship designed and built by British manufacturer Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV). Comprising a helium airship with auxiliary wing and tail surfaces, it flies using both aerostatic and aerodynamic lift and is powered by four diesel engine-driven ducted propellers. The HAV 304 was originally built for the United States Army's Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) programme. Its maiden flight took place in 2012 at Lakehurst, New Jersey, in the US. In 2013, the LEMV project was cancelled by the US Army. HAV reacquired the airship and brought it back to Cardington Airfield in England. It was reassembled and modified for civilian use, and in this form was redesignated the Airlander 10. The modified aircraft completed design certification testing before being written off [2] when it came loose from its moorings in a high wind on 18 November 2017 at Cardington Airfield. As of 2021, production of the Airlander 10 was planned for 2025. As of 2023, deliveries are expected in 2026 #technology #future #engineering #innovation\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has a new vehicle called the Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), which is often compared to the fictional Autobot leader Optimus Prime from the Transformers franchise. The LVSR is a highly versatile and capable vehicle that can transform into three different configurations: a wrecker (tow truck), a tractor, and a cargo carrier. It boasts impressive specs, including a 600-horsepower engine, 10-wheel drive, and the ability to haul a 33,000-pound payload. The LVSR was designed to replace the aging Logistics Vehicle System and meet the demands of modern combat operations. The article highlights the LVSR's advanced features, such as its integrated mounting points for armor plating, sophisticated suspension, and four-wheel steering, which make it highly maneuverable and resilient in challenging terrain. The LVSR's ability to perform multiple roles and its overall engineering prowess are compared to the transformative capabilities of Optimus Prime. The LVSR represents a significant advancement in military vehicle technology, providing the U.S. Marine Corps with a highly capable and adaptable platform for logistics and support operations. Its versatility and impressive performance make it a real-life counterpart to the iconic Transformers character. #USMC #MilitaryTechnology #Logistics #VehicleDesign #Transformers #OshkoshDefense\n\nRENK America (RAM), a leading provider of vehicle mobility solutions, is pleased to announce the award of a significant order worth over $100 million for the HMPT transmission, contracted by the United States Army. This milestone order reaffirms RENK America’s position as a trusted partner of the US military: The US Army continues to deploy more vehicles equipped with RENK transmissions. The HMPT transmission is widely recognized for its reliability and exceptional performance in the most demanding environments. This transmission has been in production in Korea (K21) since 2009 and in the United States since 2014 with Bradley Fighting Vehicle Systems (BFVS), Paladin Integrated Management (PIM), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The HMPT 800 delivers exceptional performance in with industry-leading power density while retaining the same envelope and interfaces as the HMPT 500 Series. This lightweight package enables maneuverability and agility that will be needed for system survivability on the battlefields of the future. RENK America is currently in development on an upgrade to the HMPT, known as Project Wolverine. Wolverine is designed for 1,000 HP and retain the same interfaces as the HMPT 800. The upgrade will drive improved dash speed, efficiency, and reliable operation at 50 Tons. Wolverine adds Drive-by-Wire and High Speed Reverse to meet the requirements of new vehicles, while still maintaining the cost and logistics benefits of the HMPT in the current fleet. #military #defense #defence #militaryleak #renk https://lnkd.in/gD7CWT-F"
