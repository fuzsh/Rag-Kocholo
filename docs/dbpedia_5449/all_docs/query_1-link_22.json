        "text": "Anne Inez McCaffrey (1 April 1926 — 21 November 2011) was an author of science fiction and fantasy novels, best known for her Dragonriders of Pern series. Born in the United States, she was a long-term resident of Ireland.\n\nLife[]\n\nAnne McCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts to George Herbert McCaffrey and Anne Dorothy McElroy. She had two brothers: Hugh (deceased 1988), a Major in the US Army, and Kevin Richard McCaffrey, still living.\n\nAnne passed away at the age of 85 on 21 November 2011 at her home in Ireland after suffering a stroke.[1]\n\nAnne was educated at Stuart Hall, an all-girl boarding school in Staunton, Virginia. She then went to Montclair High School, Montclair, New Jersey, and graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College majoring in Slavonic Languages and Literature in 1947.\n\nShe studied voice for nine years, performed in the first music circus in 1949, once directed a play, and worked for a record label, Liberty Music Shop.\n\nShe married H. Wright Johnson in 1950 and has three children: Alec Anthony, born in 1952, Todd McCaffrey, born in 1956, and Georgeanne (Gigi), born in 1959. She was divorced in 1970, after which she emigrated to Ireland with her two younger children. McCaffrey lived in a house of her own design in County Wicklow, Ireland and called her home Dragonhold-Underhill.\n\nWorks[]\n\nMcCaffrey's most famous works are the Dragonriders of Pern series. These are set on a fictional planet known as Pern, settled by colonists from Earth. The advanced technology of their ancestors has been lost, so the inhabitants of Pern have reverted to a society similar to Earth's medieval times. However, before the loss of this advanced technology, the original colonists produced genetically engineered dragons. These dragons are bound to and flown by elite «dragonriders», who communicate telepathically with their dragons. Together they defend Pern against pernicious «threads» which cross space periodically from a nearby «red star» and threaten to destroy all vegetation on Pern. The short story «Weyr Search» (published in 1967 in Analog Science Fiction and Fact), the initial story in the Dragonriders of Pern series, won a Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1968. McCaffrey thus became the first woman to win a Hugo for fiction. The following year, she won the Nebula Award for Best Novella for Dragonrider.\n\nAt the 2005 Nebula Award ceremonies, McCaffrey was named the 22nd Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America organization. In 2006 she was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame.[2]\n\nBooks[]\n\nFederated Sentient Planets universe[]\n\nWhile many of McCaffrey's most famous works are set in a universe which is governed by The Federated Sentient Planets or «FSP», these are not set in the same universe. The FSP is a story telling background that the author has found to be a useful tool for this series.\n\nDragonriders of Pern series[]\n\nMain article: Dragonriders of Pern\n\nMain article: Gallery of Books\n\n«Weyr Search» (novella, first published in Analog, October 1967)\n\n«Dragonrider» (novella first published in two issues of Analog, December 1967-January 1968)\n\nDragonflight (1968) (a fix-up of «Weyr Search» and «Dragonrider») ISBN 0-345-45633-5, ISBN 0-552-08453-0\n\n«The Smallest Dragonboy» (appeared in Science Fiction Tales ed. by Roger Elwood, 1973), republished in A Gift of Dragons and also Get Off the Unicorn collections.\n\nA Time When (1975) (NESFA Press) ISBN 0-915368-07-2\n\n(became the first part of The White Dragon)\n\nDragonsong (1976) ISBN 0-689-86008-0[3]\n\nDragonsinger (1977) ISBN 0-689-86007-2\n\nThe White Dragon (1978) ISBN 0-345-34167-8\n\nDragondrums (1979) ISBN 0-689-86006-4\n\nMoreta: Dragonlady of Pern (1983) ISBN 0-345-29873-X\n\nNerilka's Story (1986) ISBN 0-345-33949-5\n\nThe Girl Who Heard Dragons (novella, 1986, also included in the non-Pern collection of the same name)\n\nDragonsdawn (1988) ISBN 0-345-36286-1\n\nThe Renegades of Pern (1989) (Included «The Girl Who Heard Dragons») ISBN 0-345-36933-5\n\nAll the Weyrs of Pern (1991) ISBN 0-345-36893-2\n\n«Rescue Run» (1991) (a short story; appeared in Analog, v111 #10, August 1991)\n\nThe Chronicles of Pern: First Fall (1993) ISBN 0-345-36899-1 (Pern short story collection)\n\n«The P.E.R.N.

With sensory input and motor nerves tied into a computer, they serve as starship pilots or colony administrators, seeing and feeling the colony or ship as an extension of their own body. They perform this job to pay off their debt for education and hardware, and then in whatever capacity they choose once the debt is paid, as free agents.\n\nIt is generally considered impossible for a person to make the necessary adjustments to become a shell unless it is done at a very early age (under 2-3 years old). A notable exception is in The Ship Who Searched where the Shell-person was 7 at the time she became quadriplegic.\n\nIt should be noted that the Ship books are set in the same universe as the Crystal Singer books, as Brainship-Brawn pairings were characters in the second and third volumes of that series.\n\nThe Ship Who Sang (1969) (short story collection with stories from 1961, 1966, and 1969) ISBN 0-345-33431-0\n\nThe story of Helva and Niall was continued in the short story Honeymoon, reprinted in Get Off the Unicorn.\n\nPartnerShip (1992) with Margaret Ball, ISBN 0-671-72109-7\n\nThe Ship Who Searched (1992) with Mercedes Lackey, ISBN 0-671-72129-1\n\nThe City Who Fought (1993) with S.

Under a permanent biohazard travel restriction, Ballybran is home to one of the FSP's wealthiest, yet most reclusive organizations—the Heptite Guild. Source of invaluable crystals vital to various industries, the Heptite Guild is known to require absolute, perfect pitch in hearing and voice for all applicants, especially those seeking to mine crystal by song…\n\nCrystal Singer (1982) ISBN 0-345-32786-1 (first published in four parts in Continuum 1, 2, 3, & 4, edited by Roger Elwood)\n\nKillashandra (1986) ISBN 0-345-31600-2 (includes a Brainship from the Ship series above, in a minor role.
