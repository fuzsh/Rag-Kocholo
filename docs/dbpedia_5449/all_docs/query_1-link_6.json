Tagged: Author.\n\nWorking name of Todd Johnson (1956- ), US computer programmer and author, son of Anne McCaffrey, and brother of Gigi McCaffrey; best known for his collaborations with his mother on later volumes of the multi-generation Pern sequence. Earlier, as Johnson, he began publishing as a Sharecropper, with Combat Command #4: In the World of David Drake's Hammer's Slammers: Slammers Down! (1988), a Tie to the Combat Command Gamebook franchise and to David Drake's Hammer's Slammers universe. He began to publish work using his mother's maiden surname with Dragonholder: The Life and Dreams (So Far) of Anne McCaffrey (1999), an affectionate memoir of his mother; and moved from there into Pern proper, collaborating with his mother on several late instalments, beginning with Dragon's Kin (2003) with Anne McCaffrey, and publishing a solo volume in the sequence, Dragonsblood (2005).
