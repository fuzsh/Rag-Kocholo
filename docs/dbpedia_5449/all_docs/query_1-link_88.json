        "text": "I was delighted when author Jody Lynn Nye—whom I interviewed on this website on July 4, 2016 (her birthday!)—introduced me to Todd McCaffrey. I was even more pleased when this noted science fiction author consented to being interviewed. A New York Times bestselling author, Todd has written more than one dozen books, including eight in the Dragonriders of Pern® universe. He has published numerous short stories, the latest being “Robin Redbreast” in “When the Villain Comes Home.”\n\nHis most recent release, the one I am featuring today, initially published by Foxxe Frey Books in 2011, was re-released by WordFire Press in May, 2016.\n\nWordFire Press describes City of Angels this way:\n\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN ANGELS?\n\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN NANOTECH?\n\nShe is Ellay, a name drawn from the city she loves, the city of her birth. She’s smart, she’s fast, she’s the first of her kind. And she knows that very soon, something horrible is going to happen.\n\nEllay is an A.I.—Artificial Intelligence. Machines that think like humans, only faster. But what if, like all living things, an AI starts out just like a baby: cold, wet, lonely, scared, and crying for attention? Can she convince the government to believe her, or will they hunt her down before she gets the chance to really help?\n\nCity of Angels is a radical departure from the Dragon series for which readers know both you and your mother. Will you tell us why you decided to move into sci-fi and away from fantasy, at least for the present?\n\nActually, many people confuse The Dragonriders of Pern® with fantasy but it’s really science fiction.\n\nSo City of Angels is not a radical departure at all. It is, however, more of a science thriller than science fiction, so I can see where the confusion arises.\n\nWhen I first thought of the idea, I outlined it to my mother who said, “If you don’t write it, I will!”\n\nWhy do you say Dragon Riders is science fiction and not fantasy? That answer took me by surprise.\n\nBecause it is. You’ll see that in the original Introductions to Dragonflight.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhen is a legend a legend? Why is a myth a myth? How old and disused must a fact be for it to be relegated to the category “Fairy-tale”? And why do certain facts remain incontrovertible while others lose their validity to assume a shabby, unstable character?\n\nRukbat, in the Sagittarian sector, was a golden G-type star. It had five planets, and one stray it had attracted and held in recent millennia. Its third planet was enveloped by air man could breathe, boasted water he could drink, and possessed a gravity that permitted man to walk confidently erect. Men discovered it and promptly colonized it. They did that to every habitable planet, and then— whether callously or through collapse of empire, the colonists never discovered and eventually forgot to ask— left the colonies to fend for themselves.\n\nWhen men first settled on Rukbat’s third world and named it Pern, they had taken little notice of the stranger-planet, swinging around its adopted primary in a wildly erratic elliptical orbit. Within a few generations they had forgotten its existence. The desperate path the wanderer pursued brought it close to its step-sister every two hundred (Terran) years at perihelion.\n\nMcCaffrey, Anne. Dragonflight: The first novel in The Dragonriders of Pern . Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.\n\nI’m sure many of your readers will appreciate this explanation.\n\nReturning to City, I find it fascinating that an AI comprised of millions of nanobots becomes increasingly human as the story progresses, while artificial entities comprised of humans—namely the Catholic Church, the government, the military and corporations—become increasingly less so. Is this lesson the core of what drove this story into being? Or did it necessarily evolve during the creation process?\n\nI wanted to get people thinking about AI as a force for good. We’ve seen so many stories about evil AI that I wanted people to think: what if AI was good? What if it could help us?\n\nAs a follow-up to my previous inquiry, the story brings into question what it means to be human. Would you care to comment more on this theme?\n\nI think I would say, rather, what it means to be humane? An AI is no more our kin than dogs and cats, yet we’re willing to treat them well and they have a welcome place in our lives. I’m hoping that we will have a more intimate and respectful relationship, but at the end of the day what matters is: how does the AI treat us?\n\nThe intricate convergence of multiple subplots argues strongly that the story must have been outlined. Would you care to discuss your process in depth? Or, if, in fact, you wrote as a pantser, would you please let us in on how you managed to keep track of all the story’s ins and outs?\n\nOh, it was very outlined! And the outline was refined, particularly as the original version was 202,000+ words and the final version is a mere 176,000+ words. A story this big needs an outline or it falls apart.\n\nAt one point, I tore the novel apart into the individual sub-plotlines to be sure that they all worked.\n\nOne of the joys of writing is finding subtle ways to show while not telling. An especially enjoyable example of this is when Ellay tucks Ryan’s blanket around him while he’s sleeping—a show of her developing humanity.\n\nHow often does this sort of inspiration arrive—perhaps in the middle of the night—and are there any circumstances that seem to encourage it?\n\nMy biggest emphasis is on character. When I have a character fully realized, they do things I don’t expect. Ellay taking care of Ryan was one of those things. That’s when I knew she was real.\n\nIt’s quite obvious that a lot of research went into this book. On the first of two areas: Where did you acquire your knowledge of seismology, especially as it applies to the Whittier Narrows, the Newport-Inglewood and Northridge faults? I ask because, while events in the 6.5 magnitude range, although big, are neither the most unusual nor the most—I hate to use the term, but it fits—spectacular as seismic events go, you portray three coinciding events of this magnitude along these three fault lines as uniquely devastating.\n\nI lived through the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the many aftershocks so I had firsthand knowledge. I researched the fault lines through the internet and read many books to add to my knowledge base. Of course, with all books, most of what I read you don’t see on the page—it’s just that I have to know it so that it’s real to me.\n\nYears after I came up with the idea I was pleased to read in the newspaper that my triple earthquake was a real possibility—it shows that I was on the right track!\n\nOn the second: you’ve also acquired at least a superficial understanding of many things legal, such as patent law and court procedure. How did your knowledge in this arena come about? Did you consult with an attorney, or did you find relevant information online?\n\nI’ve read a lot of contracts and I researched. Most of the stuff comes from understanding copyright law—which every writer and artist needs to know.\n\nFor those visitors who haven’t yet read your book, this question won’t make any sense. Please answer it only if you can do so without either of us creating a spoiler. When did the Peter Pan/Tinker Bell inspiration strike?\n\nOh that was from the very beginning! What I hadn’t seen was how it paid off. That’s why I let my characters do most of the plotting for me—they’re in the thick of things, they see connections I don’t!\n\nI won’t ask if you’re currently working on anything else. You’re a prolific writer, so of course you are. Kevin J. Anderson, your publisher, has sent me The Jupiter Game’s cover. What I’m trying to edge into sideways is, would you care to give us a glimpse?\n\nThe Jupiter Game: A close encounter with aliens who watch Howdy Doody.\n\nYet another surprise!\n\nI always follow my interviews with a Lightning Round, because the answers to these questions often provide my visitors with interesting insights. In as few words as possible, please answer the following:\n\nMy best friend would tell you I’m… Awesome.\n\nThe one thing I cannot do without is: Coffee.\n\nThe one thing I would change about my life is: Rejuvenation.\n\nMy biggest peeve is: We haven’t got a stardrive yet.\n\nSo right on that one. Finally, the thing I’m most satisfied with is: SpaceX.\n\nHere is one of Todd’s Social Links, in case you’d like to follow him:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/todd.mccaffrey.5\n\nShould you care to purchase any of his books, you may do so here:\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Todd-J.-McCaffrey/e/B00288X5NQ/\n\nFinally, for those of you who are interested in sampling City of Angels, here is Chapter One:\n\nWashington, DC\n\nMay 27th, D-Day: -271\n\n05:23 EDT UTC-4\n\nCybersecurity Operations—or, Ops: low light, cold air, and a tension level that crackled on the skin.\n\nGeorgia MacDonald lengthened her stride as she headed to her workstation. Harry Norman didn’t look up from his desk as she approached. He was bent over his keyboard, shoulders hunched, typing as quickly as he could, sweat visible on his face.\n\nOne of those days, Georgia thought to herself, grabbing her chair and keyboard in one swift, graceful move. She pulled a copy of Harry’s displays, pursed her lips for a moment, started to work.\n\nHarry was fighting with someone trying to hack into the Department of Defense—they were after the nuclear launch codes. That wasn’t out of the ordinary—it happened at least twice a week—but this guy was beating Harry.\n\n“I’m in,” Georgia said. “I put him in the Philippines, but I think that’s a fake.”\n\n“He got around the first level like it was butter,” Harry said. “He was into the second level before—” He stopped speaking as his fingers flew over his keyboard—more software programs into the defense.\n\nGeorgia said nothing, her fingers flying—one of her programs. A tense moment, then she slumped in her chair, relieved. “He’s in the honeypot.”\n\nA honeypot was a network of computers specially designed to lure hackers.\n\n“He’s got the ‘GO’ codes,” Harry said, leaning back in his chair and turning his head to flash Georgia a smile.\n\n“He just bought the worst of all worlds,” Georgia set another routine running and raised her eyebrows when the results popped up. “He’s using three machines.”\n\n“That’s light,” Harry said. “Maybe he’s a solo.”\n\n“Those are mighty powerful machines,” Georgia observed. Certain foreign powers—not just governments, either—would pay a great deal for the keys to the United States’ nuclear arsenal—enough to finance the hundreds of solo operations that every day tried to do just that. “He could be working for our friends.”\n\nGeorgia searched her folders for a particular program and, with an evil grin, sent it after the three computers.\n\n“Just try hacking into the US, twerp!” she said.\n\nA minute later, all three computers flashed off the net. Dead.\n\n“Wow, Georgia, you sure showed that nasty eleven-year-old!” The voice that came from behind her belonged to Johnny Jones—a short, dark-haired New Yorker with all the brash and none of the sophistication.\n\n“Just my job, Jonesy.”\n\n“Another idiot tried to hack into DoD and get our missile launch codes. We sent him to a honeypot—and Georgia reformatted his hard drives,” Harry said, reaching up an outstretched hand to Georgia for a high-five.\n\n“Oh, wow, Georgia’s decided to play with the real boys!” Jones said. “Didja give up on Rome?”\n\n“Jonesy, what this kid spent half a day doing, an AI could do in a millisecond.”\n\n“Something like what your friend Ryan wanted to make?” Johnny Jones asked. “A real live talks-to-you-and-holds-your-hand sort artificial intelligence that’s smarter than anything?”\n\n“Yeah,” Georgia returned coldly, “just like that.”\n\nJones smirked at her. “If it’s hand-holding you want, Georgia, I’m there for you any time!”\n\nGeorgia ignored him, starting up her morning routines.\n\n“Ah, Georgie, and I had such hopes!” Jones cried.\n\n“Don’t you have work to do?” Harry Norman asked.\n\n“LA can look after itself, it’s not going anywhere. The only thing worth watching is that Fleet Streets launch—that’ll be a laugh,” Jones said negligently, but Georgia heard his footsteps heading back toward his own work area where Alan Manning was waiting for his relief.\n\n“He’s an asshole,” Harry said as he rose and moved over to Georgia’s area.\n\n“But he’s our asshole,” Georgia agreed bitterly. She changed the topic. “Anything from Rome?”\n\n“Rome’s your baby,” Harry said. He caught her look and added, “But, no, nothing that I noticed. I think they shut it down when Lawson left.”\n\nLawson was good. Georgia was certain he’d been the one to convince the Vatican in to this wild idea, but she was pretty sure that since then he’d lost control.\n\nThe trouble with Rome was, since the departure of Father Lawson a few weeks ago, there had been very little to learn. The network activity log looked no different than it had for the past month—the part Georgia had tentatively identified as their active phase.\n\n“Georgia,” a gruff voice spoke beside her.\n\n“Morning, Chief.”\n\n“How are our friends in Rome?”\n\n“Still active,” Georgia said. She shrugged. “Their research is funded to the end of the year.”\n\n“So there’s no reason to stop,” Sam Bennett agreed. He pointed to the screen—where the results of Georgia’s counterattack were still visible.\n\n“Did you get his prints?”\n\n“The honeypot’s still analyzing: we stand a good chance,” Georgia said. Prints in this case were a sophisticated analysis of the hacker’s coding, approach, and methods. The idea had been Georgia’s; in fact, it had been one of the two ideas which had brought her to the attention of Sam Bennett and the CSC in the first place.\n\nThe other idea had been the one that got her to join the Department of Defense’s Cyber Security Center—and had ended her relationship with Jim Ryan. Ryan had believed that any artificial intelligence naturally had to be good. Georgia wasn’t sure. She thought that, just like any animal, if an AI was treated badly or hurt, it would defend itself. It might even kill.\n\nSam Bennett, interviewing her for an “unknown” agency, had asked Georgia, “So, Ms. MacDonald, if you found an AI that was treated badly, that felt it had to defend itself, what would you do?”\n\n“If we couldn’t reason with it,” Georgia had begun, “if it decided to be ‘evil’—” she paused, seeing the tension growing in Jim Ryan’s eyes, worrying about how he’d react to her next words.\n\nSam Bennett motioned for her to continue.\n\nShe took a deep breath and said, “—then we kill it.”\n\nJim gave an angry cry but she continued, adding, “Before it kills us.”\n\np n p\n\nWhich was how Georgia MacDonald ended up watching Rome. Because Father John Lawson, formerly Donal Lawson of CalTech, had convinced the Vatican to attempt to create the first artificial intelligence.\n\n“We need to get someone in there,” Georgia said, pulling herself back from the memory. “Or we need to talk with Father Lawson.”\n\n“We can’t,” Bennett said. “Remember, we don’t exist.”\n\n“NSA, CIA, whatever,” Georgia said, flicking her hand dismissively as she listed the “real” agencies that could represent them. “If they do make an AI and it gets out …”\n\n“Assuming you’re right, how do you get to it?”\n\n“Heck, I still don’t even know how to figure out if they can make one,” Georgia said, shaking her head. “And that’s probably the best news—if I can’t break into their system, there’s a good chance any AI will find it hard to break out.”\n\n“Mmm,” Bennett murmured in agreement. His phone beeped. Bennett pulled it out of his pocket and glanced at it. “Well, we know where Father Lawson is.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Los Angeles.”\n\n“Really?” Georgia said, her eyebrows going up.\n\n“And?”\n\n“Well, Jim’s out there,” Georgia said. “He signed on with DynaCorps for the Fleet Streets project—”\n\n“That was a change for him, wasn’t it?” Bennett asked. He gave Georgia a thoughtful look. “You don’t think—?”\n\n“He’s all stuck into nanotechnology and nanobots,” Georgia said, shaking her head. “From what Jonesy’s been saying, he might be trying to tie them into Fleet Streets, but that’d mean nothing more than a big expert system, not a true AI.”\n\n“Nanobots?”\n\n“Yeah, the dork they got to build their real-time database bailed,” Jones called from over by his desk. “Mackey—the VP of software—handed the patch-up job to Ryan.” Jones snorted and shook his head, staring at Georgia. “He’s gonna fail and get fired. Again.”\n\nBennett nodded his thanks for the news and turned back to Georgia. “What about Ryan?”\n\n“Maybe if I talked with him, told him about Father Lawson—”\n\n“From what I understand, your Mr. Ryan has his hands full at this particular moment.”\n\n“He’s so ADD all I have to do is point and say, ‘Look! Bright, shiny!’” Georgia said. “Anyway, he and Lawson have a history. If he talked with Lawson, he’d get a good feel for what they managed to accomplish in Rome.”\n\nBennett’s eyes narrowed. “If that’s so, why didn’t Rome get Dr. Ryan?”\n\nGeorgia shrugged. “I’m still surprised that DynaCorps picked him up.”\n\n“No doubt they know what they’re doing,” Bennett said. Georgia turned her chair around to stare up at him directly. Bennett gestured to his phone. “I’ve got to go.”\n\n“So, can I call him?”\n\n“Well, not now—you’re working,” Bennett told her. “Of course,” he added, his eyes twinkling, “I cannot dictate how you spend your off hours, Miss MacDonald.”"
