        "text": "Our fourth session in year two of the series focuses on Anne McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern trilogy, her early novels published in 1968, 1970, and 1978. These would lead into dozens of other Pern-situated novels, written at first by Anne McCaffery, and then collaboratively by her and her son, Todd McCaffery. We will be discussing the narrative world she constructed, and five of the key philosophical themes featured in her works.\n\nThe talk took place Thursday, April 13 at the Brookfield Public Library. Here is the videorecording of the talk:\n\nPern is a world explored and colonized by human beings, who early on engineerer diminutive fire-lizards into the giant dragons used to fight the Thread. These are mycorrhizoid spores, originally from the Red Star (a wandering planet), that fall upon Pern, and devour and destroy whatever life they encounter. Over time, they abandon or forget much of their advanced technology, and develop into a hierarchical, agrarian society, divided into the Dragonriders of the Weyrs, the craftspeople of the Halls, and the bulk of the population, who reside in the Holds.\n\nThe philosophical themes I plan to focus upon during the talk are:\n\nthe bond between dragon and human\n\nstratified society and the classes\n\ntensions produced by technology\n\nparadoxes of time travel\n\nfacing danger, honor, and the common good\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern Trilogy\n\nFor those who would like to purchase or otherwise acquire the books, here are some Amazon links to them.\n\nDragonflight (1968)\n\nDragonquest (1970)\n\nThe White Dragon (1978)\n\nLinks and Resources of Interest\n\nThe discussion will be drawn primarily from the novels, but there are a number of online resources that may be of interest for those reading McCaffrey’s works. Here are some that I think particularly worth taking a look at – and after the session, there may be more to post, since participants often bring up those they found worthwhile as well.\n\nEssays on and Interviews with McCaffrey\n\nInterview with Albedo One (1996)\n\nQuestions and Answers on Pern with Anne McCaffery\n\nWorldbuilding from the Ground Up, panel discussion with Dave Duncan, Dennis Jones, Anne McCaffrey and Juliet McKenna (200)\n\nInterview of Todd McCaffrey by Buzzy Mag(2014)\n\nSites and Entries on McCaffrey"
