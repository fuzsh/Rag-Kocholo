        "text": "Have you read the X-Wing series? I have several other Star Wars books sitting on my to be read shelf, but I haven't gotten around to them. I don't want to start not at the beginning of a series, and somehow I always seem to end up with books 2 and 3 of a trilogy, or some such nonsense.\n\nI have read the Han Solo Trilogy several times, the Corellian trilogy, and the original Han Solo trilogy. The books for episodes 1, 4, 5, and 6 and the books that are set just after each of those. And of course the whole X-Wing series. My favorite quote of all time comes from there.\n\n\"Pretty,\" Donos said. \"What do we blow up first?\" Star Wars X-Wing: Solo Command, Aaron Allston.\n\nI love that. It seems like something that would fit DoGA pretty good.\n\nUnless there has been a new Talent book come out this year then I am up on them. I am still behind on Pern, though. I have only read two of the ones Todd McCaffrey has been in on. I liked the one about the watch weyrs. Though, I have heard that some people didn't like that the focus was not on the dragons."
