        "text": "St. Cloud Technical & Community College Named Best for Vets St. Cloud, Minn.‚ÄîSt. Cloud Technical & Community College has been named to the Military Times‚Äô 2023 Best for Vets: College list. Military Times Best for Vets: Colleges is the largest and most comprehensive annual ranking of schools for military service members and veterans. ‚ÄúSCTCC‚Äôs inclusion on the Military Times‚Äô list informs veterans that SCTCC is ensuring our servicemembers and their families feel welcome and have an easy transition to civilian life,‚Äù said Heidi Smith, advisor to the Student Veterans of America Club. ‚ÄúThe College has and will continue to support veterans and military members by offering resources, shared spaces, and personal assistance.‚Äù The Military Times survey is sent to colleges and universities across the nation asking about their programs for veterans. The results are then analyzed, along with public data about colleges and universities obtained from the Department of Education and Department of Veterans Affairs, and turned into an official ranking. The methodology for the rankings is based on quantitative data and includes student success metrics, admissions, resources, human resources, financials, and recordkeeping. In 2023, 325 higher education institutions made the list, which includes public, private, and for-profit universities and colleges at the four- and two-year levels. SCTCC is one of three Minnesota institutions that made the list and one of two Minnesota State colleges. The 2023 rankings can be found on the Best for Vets website. ‚ÄúOur comprehensive survey and thoughtful methodology make our rankings best in class‚Äù said Mike Gruss, editor-in-chief at Sightline Media Group, parent company of Military Times. SCTCC is regularly listed on the Best for Vets lists and offers supports and services specifically for military veterans and their families. Additionally, SCTCC is a Yellow Ribbon Company, which shows that key areas within a company structure create a network that proactively supports servicemembers and military families. About Military Times The Military Times is the trusted source for independent news and information for service members and their families.

Cray Pack's story is the perfect case study in why PreVeteran's Military Transition 2.0 program needs to be the military transition program of record because it empowers the individual to successfully create their own unique, post-military outcomes. Here are some highlights about Cray: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Departed the United States Marine Corps at the 12-year point 2Ô∏è‚É£ He began PreVeteran initial training 15 months prior to separation 3Ô∏è‚É£ Was a Cobra pilot but no longer wanted to fly, so like many other #servicemembers out there, he needed to pivot into something new 4Ô∏è‚É£ Entered our PreVeteran Military Transition 2.0 System via our 5-Week virtual Employment Prep Course (EPC), then entered our PreVeteran Alumni Community for additional training & support 5Ô∏è‚É£ With his new tools he learned in the EPC, he began exploring different industries in a supported, community environment 6Ô∏è‚É£ He explored Aerospace & Defense & ruled it out because the industry was not healthy 14 months ago ‚è≠ He then explored Finance and ruled that out because it was not a good culture fit ‚è≠ He then explored Oil & Gas and found a great fit 7Ô∏è‚É£ By using PreVeteran tools, he was fully prepared...so when he entered his employment window (90-120 days before separation), he had two companies from the Oil & Gas industry offer him 8Ô∏è‚É£ Cray just passed his 1-year anniversary with his company and continues to thrive! üí™ üòé Listen to Cray in his own words explain his experience with PreVeteran. #militarytransition #transitioningmilitary #betteroutcomes #preveteran #training #military #wellness\n\nKatie üåô Helbling and I are going to chatting about this soon... the idea of reinstating the draft is a solution in search of a problem. And, since Congress has neglected to fix the Selective Service system, it's a solution that already has issues to resolve before it could be workable. The idea of mandatory national service has merit, but only if it offers broader options beyond military service, e.g., Habitat for Humanity, Peace Corps, etc., and is tied to a post-9/11 GI Bill-type program that extends benefits to a broader array of service while allowing a greater range of options for utilization of those benefits. That kind of a program could be transformative for our country, for our society, and for future generations. But throwing around the idea of a draft is short-sighted and poorly conceived. Not that that slows anyone down.\n\nThis Veterans Day - and always - we honor and celebrate the past, current, and future members of our armed services. Our nation‚Äôs servicemembers lead in teaching and community-serving positions across the country, and it's with great gratitude that we thank each veteran, and their families, for their selfless service, courage, and dedication. We are the home of the free because of the brave. In honor of Veterans Day, we highlight an analysis by Chad Aldeman, of The 74 Media: ‚ÄúMilitary Service Should Count as a Successful Pathway for Students. But First We Need Better Data About Graduates.‚Äù Aldeman‚Äôs analysis breaks down the challenges in tracking successful post-high school outcomes beyond college enrollment to also include career and military service. In response, \"a group of state education chiefs [are] working behind the scenes to ask the United States Department of Defense for help in using military service as an indicator of student success.\" üîó: https://lnkd.in/gha-nBcA Please join us in honoring all of our nation's veterans, including those who have served across our K-12 partners, candidates, team, and our very own President Joe E. Ross, this Veterans Day. üá∫üá∏\n\nSt Louis, MO Lambert Airport Boeing Experimental Weapons HQ US Marines and US Navy Offices. Plausible is that the New Berger Marines embraced DARPA partnerships with Navy Research to be in vogue adopting current operations experiments that in our St Louis story is the selection, cultivation of children MK Ultra experiments of phenomenon and the Super Soldier as Wizzo in Marine Aviation and ISR. Steinmans Aviation Kids that may link to around the Nation. Plausible is the continued expansion of contracting DARPA programs and services fused with the Marines. Question is who is the Captain charged with St Louis Weapons Experiments of DARPA and Kids as Super Soldiers? It is the new Marine Corps breaking away from historical footing to establish relevance? DARPA central to this Special Operations Aviation and exploited as a shadow military operating independent in St Louis for what Program Manager? https://lnkd.in/gN-TKHHR https://lnkd.in/g-X3aCFK https://lnkd.in/gYEYKaGv\n\nWhat data is used to determine the best college for veterans? I mean that sincerely because I can‚Äôt seem to figure out these rankings. According to the 2024 U.S World News Report, the number 1 listed college for Veterans DOES NOT have the following: 1. A Veterans Resource Center 2. Priority Enrollment for GI Bill Users 3. Transfer of Military Credits It does have a 95% graduation rate, with just over 90 undergraduate veterans enrolled, 604 GI Bill User‚Äôs, and as of 2020, 2 TA users. It also does a TON of research and philanthropy benefiting veterans & military families within the state. Now this is a great school, and I‚Äôm sure the veterans enrolled have access to the resources they need for success. My point is - with such a small number of actual veterans attending and lack of basic resources that lower ranked schools have for veterans- why the number 1 spot? Are these rankings based on fundraising, research, and political visibility, or rankings based on resources available to #studentveterans ? I'd love to hear your thoughts. *Note: The number 1 ranking is a tie between 2 other schools, but listed alphabetically. All data presented on this post is based on first school listed. ** I am in no way saying these aren't deserving, reputable institutions- but curious about the criteria measured to be ranked #1 for veterans."
