        "text": "Of course we had to kick off this list with the series McCaffrey is most known for: Dragonriders of Pern. Beginning with Dragonflight, we meet Lessa, an outcast on the planet Pern.\n\nWhen Lessa's family was slaughtered, she learned to use her telepathic abilities to ensure she didn't stand out as a survivor.\n\nBut then the Thread, a long-dormant threat to Pern, reemerges. Lessa and the dragon queen with whom she shares a telepathic connection are the only ones who can save the colonized planet.\n\nTo defeat the Thread and revive the power of dragons and their riders, Lessa must embrace the glory she was born into.\n\nHelva was born human, but her mind was implanted into an interstellar brainship. After training in her new cyborg identity, Helva must choose a male or female partner—the 'brawn' to her 'brain'—with whom to explore and serve the galaxy.\n\nHelva's existence as a brainship promises to be a fulfilling adventure. But then Helva XH-834 defies expectations for brainships...by falling in love.\n\nThe book is dedicated to McCaffrey's father, who died in 1954. McCaffrey later said that writing The Ship Who Sang helped her process his loss.\n\nOne of the few series by McCaffrey that doesn’t feature dragons, The Crystal Singer saga follows a young aspiring opera singer named Killashandra Ree. After ten years of demanding training, Killashandra is no closer to achieving her dreams.\n\nBut then an enigmatic man tells her about the Heptite Guild on the planet Ballybran, an elusive group that is said to provide fortune and fame for those lucky enough to qualify. Killashandra is enthralled by the unique relationship between the black crystals and their singers.\n\nShe's willing to risk her safety—and sanity—to learn more.\n\nThe first of McCaffrey's novels to be published, Restoree is a sci-fi romance.\n\nSara was kidnapped from her home in New York. On Earth, she was used to being a wallflower who enjoyed her own company. But now, she doesn't recognize the gorgeous new body she's been placed in. Sara is trapped in an unfamiliar physical form, and is held within a jail cell where she must care for a strange, incapacitated man.\n\nOnce Sara learns the truth about her captives, she devises a plan to rescue the man under her care, and to help her fellow 'restorees' escape. But what if freedom is more dangerous than captivity?\n\nPublisher’s Weekly states that “McCaffrey’s world of the Talented is as vivid as that of Pern and its dragons.”\n\nIn The Talents Saga, McCaffrey introduces Henry Darrow, a 20th century human gifted with psionic talents.\n\nWhen the paranormal abilities of people like Henry are exposed to the wider population, society fears that the psionic-powered humans known as the Talents can't be trusted. A few isolated incidents of dangerous Talents further this hysteria.\n\nThe average person believes the only option is to repress the gifted humans. However, Henry and his fellow Talents see other plans for the future.\n\nBuilding off of the world from To Ride Pegasus, McCaffrey’s The Rowan is the first installment in The Tower and the Hive series.\n\nThe Rowan is an orphan, and a powerful Prime whose psionic abilities are the backbone that keeps the galaxy functioning.\n\nShe's lucky to have survived the disaster that killed her family, but the Rowan's powers keep her isolated—until she meets the one Prime who might be more powerful than her: Jeff Raven.\n\nThe first of four books in The Catteni Sequence, Freedom’s Landing follows Kristin Bjornsen, a human whose life is forever changed when the alien Catteni invade and begin taking humans as slaves.\n\nKristin survives as a slave, but that's only the first of many tests the extraterrestrials put her through.\n\nThe aliens have discovered a new planet, and their best way of learning whether or not it is habitable is to use slaves as test subjects.\n\nTo survive on this inhospitable world, Kristin must develop an unlikely alliance with a Catteni hiding from his own people.\n\nLady Nimisha Boynton-Rondymense has never been one to sit back and watch others be in control. Craving adventure and excitement, she begins to work as the secret assistant to her father Lord Tionel, the owner and founder of Rondymense Shipyards.\n\nWhen a deadly accident occurs and Nimisha inherits her father's business, his male heir is enraged.\n\nNimisha overlooks the backlash, until she travels through a wormhole on a solo voyage and becomes marooned on a deadly planet.\n\nNow, the only person protecting the shipyard back on Vega III is Nimisha’s daughter—but just like her mother, she won't back down from a fight.\n\nThe first of ten books in the Acorna series (the first two of which are a collaboration between Margaret Ball and McCaffrey), this title introduces the titular young unicorn girl.\n\nOrphaned Acorna is found by miners, drifting in an escape pod through space. At a glance, she seems human—but on closer inspection it's possible to observe her horned forehead, her hoofs, and her healing powers.\n\nThe miners take Acorna to the planet Kezdet, where she can grow in peace. But Kezdet isn't the safe haven it first seems.\n\nThe planet's economy is based off exploitative child labor, championed by a sinister figure called \"the Piper.\" Unfortunately for him, Acorna will never be complacent in the face of injustice.\n\nMcCaffrey teams up with author Elizabeth Ann Scarborough for the Petaybee Trilogy, which begins with Powers That Be.\n\nDisabled combat veteran Yanaba Maddock is stationed on the frigid planet Petaybee for her final mission. Her role is to work with the geological teams to extract local resources, but Yanaba soon realizes that the planet and its indigenous inhabitants are more powerful than anyone knows.\n\nAs Yanaba's strength miraculously returns on the planet, she grows closer to the native population, and decides she will do whatever it takes to protect her new home—even if it could cost her life.\n\nWhen Kai and Varian set out to explore the flora and fauna of the planet Ireta, they didn't expect to find such deadly predators. Things only get worse when the members of their exploration crew start acting strangely and the rescue ship sent for them disappears. Just as McCaffrey often juggles science fiction and fantasy, the old and the new, Kai and Varian are suddenly faced with the possibility that humanity's distant past may just be their very real future.\n\nThis standalone novel follows the titular Lady Nimisha Boynton Rondymense, whose father owns the Rondymense shipyards. When tragedy strikes and Nimisha finds herself in charge, she must contend with the jealous male suitor who believed he should have been put in charge.\n\nNimistra tries to ignore his jealousy, which proves to be a terrible mistake. Betrayed and stranded on a planet lightyears from home, Nimistra must find a way to survive and, more importantly, help her daughter who must stand alone against Nimistra's enemies."
