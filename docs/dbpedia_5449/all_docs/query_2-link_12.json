They begin at the very bottom in 2015, the year the author went full-time.\n\n(Want to send Sever Bronny a letter? Do so here.)\n\nF E A T U R E D P I N:\n\nHello Sever,\n\nI just finished reading Flames of Stone. I really wanted to tell you this may be your best work so far. It is mature, adult fiction for sure. I am 83, have raised four kids, been through divorce, real love (the last 37 years and gong strong) and have lived a lot of life, and have been reading sci-fi and fantasy since I was in the 6th grade back in 1951\n\nso I really feel I can say this was a very special book you wrote. You’ve captured the emotions vividly that someone going through what you characters lived, their suffering and their joy. You included unexpected compassion, depth of understanding, relationships forming, growing, being betrayed and lost.\n\nI hope it sells well!\n\n—Chuck from Pinerolo Italy, letter sent to author after the launch of Flames of Stone.\n\n———–\n\nLATEST SELECTED LETTERS TO THE AUTHOR:\n\n———–\n\nHello\n\nMy name is [redacted for privacy]. I am 15 years old. I was just wondering if I could tell you about how your books have helped me throughout the past year and a half. So, I was going through a rough time, and I was very suicidal at the time but your books kept me going. Every time I read a book I needed to know what happened in the next. I eventually went through a break up and some harsh words were exchanged, wounding my mental health horribly. After hearing so many awful things said to me I wanted to leave this world more than anything. Your books were the only reason I stayed here. They inspired me to keep going. I eventually found a new relationship and we’ve had some tough times, but as I kept reading I saw the same things happen with Augum and Leera. Seeing those moments made me realize that love is a journey, and it’s meant to be rough. I realized that in the end it would all be worth it. I honestly owe this relationship to you. I owe my life to you. Thank you for making these beautiful stories and worlds where i could go when I was down. They brought me so much joy and I feel as if the stories are real memories in my mind. Thank you for helping me lose my mind, and find my soul. I hope this message gets to you, and is seen by your eyes.\n\n(Author replied via email)\n\n)* * *\n\nCongratulations Sever Bronny! I don’t think I’ve ever read an author who is so amazing at making me absolutely LOATHE the antagonists. It’s like you outdo yourself with every new book!\n\nSeriously though, if you haven’t read his stuff yet you NEED TO get on it. Best new fantasy I’ve read/some of the best fantasy I’ve ever read.\n\n-Tom, via Facebook\n\n* * *\n\nSubject:\n\nYour books\n\nComment:\n\nGood morning Sever,\n\nYou may or may not know, your audience reaches far beyond the YA category. I’ve just finished reading all of your books for the third time, in order. Each time you write a new book I need to rediscover the rest of them anew. I expect I will continue to do so as long as you write. I look forward to reading more stories in this series, as well as seeing what you dream up that is completely new. You may be interested in knowing the other authors I read religiously are Anne and Todd McCaffrey, Mercedes Lackey, Larry Niven, Roger Zelazney, Andre Norton, Orson Scott Card, Piers Anthony, Terry Brooks, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Eddings, Raymond Feist, Margaret Weis and Tad Williams, in no particular order, to name a few. You are in very good company. For me, your books are a way to relax and leave the stresses of work and life behind. Your characters and story lines are well thought out and come alive so I can immerse myself. Thank you for giving me this way to disconnect and recharge. I am 60 years old this June, and will continue reading your books for as long as I can see, and you write.\n\nWarmly,\n\n-Laura, via contact form on this site\n\n* * *\n\nSubject:\n\nMy love of reading\n\nComment:\n\nHello! My name is River, I’m 13 years old, turning 14 in a month. My entire family has always been readers, when I was 7 I got my first Kindle Fire, on which I found I had the Kindle App. After about a year of having it, my brother (2 years older) found a series. When he finished it, he came to me and said “Hey I think you’d really like this!” The series that he showed me was The Arinthian Line. As of this point in my life, I’ve read The Arinthian Line and Fury of a Rising Dragon about 4 times each. My one disappointment is that I have never been able to find your books in any bookstore I look in. Everywhere I go I try to visit a bookstore to see if they have it but they don’t :( I’m finally going to give in and just purchase them off Amazon lol. These series were the ones that made me love reading and fantasy. The only reason I haven’t read Ana’s books yet is because I want to read them with the books in my hands. Since I started reading, there hasn’t been a book series that has even come close to taking this one’s spot as my #1 favorite. Thank you for all that you do!\n\n-River, via contact form on this site\n\n* * *\n\nI wanted to take a moment to express my genuine admiration for your new book. It is truly amazing! From the very first page, I was captivated by the story and the way you expertly crafted each character. The depth and complexity of the plot kept me on the edge of my seat, eagerly turning the pages to unravel the mysteries and surprises that awaited. Your writing style is simply captivating, effortlessly painting vivid scenes and evoking a range of emotions within me. I found myself completely immersed in the world you created, feeling a connection to the characters and their journeys. Your ability to convey such depth of emotion and thought-provoking themes is truly exceptional. This book has left a lasting impact on me, and I cannot thank you enough for sharing your talent with the world. It is a masterpiece that I will treasure and recommend to others. Thank youfor writing a lovely and spectacular ending to Anna’s series! I additionaly wanted to offer my assistance in any way I can for your books. I believe in its potential and would be thrilled to help.\n\n-Quark, via the fan-run Discord\n\n* * *\n\nThe only other book series I’ve read were the Percy Jackson books because it’s hard to hold my attention, but the books you’ve written are even better on my opinion. I love the trio the most and can’t wait to get back into their story next year.\n\n-Zack, via Facebook\n\n* * *\n\nI’m on my 7th or 8th cycle on arinthian line and fury of a rising dragon at the moment on audible\n\nMoira quirk did an amazing job capturing the essence of Anna, both as a child and young adult.\n\nQuarrel quarrel for the light…\n\n-Alexander, via Facebook\n\n* * *\n\nI have enjoyed all of your works so far and cannot wait to enjoy this one. I never reach out like this but it seemed appropriate this time. Please continue your awesome works I will forever buy and support you.\n\n-Matthew, via Facebook\n\n* * *\n\nYour books are what got me back into reading what I loved growing up and what I still crave and love getting lost into… fantasy and magic!!! Please don’t stop writing 🙏\n\n-Anonymous (comment left on author’s blog)\n\n* * *\n\nDear Sever Bronny,\n\nThank you so much for creating the stories that you do. I am an 18 year old boy who first discovered Arcane on my mom’s amazon kindle back in fifth grade, and I have never stopped loving your books. They are one of my top five fantasy series of all time, up there with Lord of the Rings in my opinion. I love how you show the growth of the characters and turn some fantasy tropes on their heads, such as the generic “villian is hero’s father,” which you used to explore the psyche of Lividius and how to defeat him. I also appreciate the way you’ve dealt with serious topics throughout your books, such as survivor’s guilt, homophobia, sexism, disability, violence, psychological effects of killing someone, et cetera. It’s all quite impressive, and I devour every new book as soon as I can.\n\n-Nate\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Fan-girling over your books :)\n\nComment: Hi there! I’m Eve, and probably one of your biggest fans. I absolutely love your work! I’ve been thinking over how to word this email because I’m so excited, so I’ll start with this:\n\nI’m going to be honest, I didn’t want to read the Arinthian Line book 1 at first. My grandmother got it for me for Christmas two years ago, and I wasn’t originally planning to read it. I didn’t have anything else to read a couple months after Christmas, so I started to read it. I’ve always loved fantasy and anything with Witches, wizards, and magic; or in this case, arcanery and warlocks. It was a slow start, but I ended up loving the book! Im REALLY glad I chose to read it, instead of letting in sit on my shelf and collect dust :D\n\nI would have missed out on my favorite series, and I’m so extremely glad I didn’t. I really, really, really enjoy all the books you’ve written. I do have one question: What does a Canterran accent sound like? Or the other kingdom’s accents? I kinda imagined Canterrans with British accents, but I’d love to know what the accent does actually sound like. I’m currently rereading all the series, like I have six other times in the past two years, and my parents always tell me to find something else to read, but I CANT STOP. One of my sisters reads historical fiction and isn’t into the fantasy genre, so I don’t get to fangirl with anyone, because none of my friends reads this series. I’m obsessed with reading these books, and I can’t thank you enough for creating this world.\n\nI wish you all the best, Eve\n\nP.S. Your series is SO much better than Harry Potter and all the other fantasy books I’ve read\n\n* * *\n\nOk I totally just fangirled out for a minute! My husband and I stumbled on the first book as a free audible download and I misread arinthian as authurian. It was one of the best mistakes I ever made! We were absolutely hooked. The road trip was so much more enjoyable with the story. We bought the second and third book before we got home. It was fitting that we found your work on an anniversary trip since we met over a book series. We both really do love your books.\n\n-Jen, via Facebook\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nSubject:\n\nThe Arcane Artist.\n\nComment:\n\nI finished reading ‘The Arcane Artist’ today and I just wanted to say, thank you so much for this masterpiece. From all the stories ive read in my life anna’s speaks to me on a level ive never before experienced, and to be frank it brought me to tears on several occasions. You as an author truly have a skill to bring a story to life and make a connection, something other author’s fail to hit the mark with. I have high hopes and can not wait for the next adventure.\n\n(Ps. please include more Ice warlocks, I feel as thought they get a bad rep with the whole ‘heart as cold as ice’ thing)\n\n—Jonah, email via author’s contact page\n\n* * *\n\nI am a huge fan of your books and just finished reading both the Arinthian Line series and the Fury of a Rising Dragon series for a second time. I hope to get the Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone books that are out. I think your books are probably my favorite series, dare I say even better than the Harry Potter series. I have to admit after I read your books I sometimes stare at an object in an attempt of telekinesis and hope that you somehow caused a rift between the world in your books and our world, and those able can learn the arcane arts. I had a question regarding dual arcane inclinations. Would a healing warlock be able to have an inclination to another element? And if so, would they be able to ethically train in it and use it?\n\n—LucyD (comment left on author’s website)\n\n* * *\n\nI absolutely love the series. Most series I’ve read start to get dull after the 5th or 6th book but The Fury of a Rising Dragon provides every bit and even more excitement than The Arinthian Line. I’ve read every book at least 3 times and I love it. The series still has potential because you have created an entire world, sort of like Lord of the Rings. I’m looking forward to the continuance of the Trio’s adventures.\n\n—Charles (via con tact form on author’s site)\n\n* * *\n\n“\n\n* * *\n\nOh my goodness! I didn’t think I could love another character like I do the trio, but you’ve done it again! I absolutely LOVE Anna! I felt for her in ways I didn’t think possible for a character in a book. Her hardships, her triumphs and her desire to just want to be loved by those she loved caused such an array of emotions in me.\n\nI’m only upset now that I have to wait for book 2 for what I’m sure will feel like forever.\n\nThank you again for all that you do and the amazing stories you write that bring such a joy to my life!\n\nKind regards,\n\n—Sean\n\n* * *\n\nHello sir,\n\nI am so glad that I found your email! I would like to express my thanks and admiration to you. Your stories are heartfelt and brilliant. I for one will be looking for the next addition soon!\n\nThanks again.\n\n—Johnathen\n\nPs. If you actually read this email and have the chance to respond i thank you even more.\n\n* * *\n\n[Arcane:] The book that started it all. I was the same age as Augum when I first read this book, I definitely tried copy pasting his personality on myself. I learned about books 2 and 3, and read them. Completely fell in love with the story. Since the release of the 1st FoaRD book, I’ve grown up at the same time as Augum, and I still try and be just like him some times. Thank you for writing the series that has gotten me through more hard times, taken me on more adventures, and brought more smiles to my face than any other. I emailed you several years ago saying how the Arinthian Line trumped any other series, be that Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, and I still believe that to be true. Thank you for creating this amazing world in your mind, I can’t wait for Anna’s next chapter. I’ve got all the audio and E-books, I’ve just gotta finish my paper back collection till I’ve read every book on every form of media. Except for PoT, I got it on paperback the week it released, and the audiobook fairly quick as well. I hope to one day change people’s life like you have changed mine, but through a different medium. You’re definitely my biggest inspiration. I seriously can’t thank you enough\n\n—A brief exchange from author’s instagram\n\n* * *\n\nello, I just wanted to say that my wife and I love your books. We were long distance when we were dating and we wanted to find something we could do separate and talk about together later. I received a copy of Arcane with my Audible Plus membership and she and I listened to it. We were instantly sucked into your amazing world. We loved the stories and talking about them together, trying to guess what would happen next, brought us closer together. Thank you.\n\n—Pauly (message via author’s Discord server)\n\n* * *\n\nI just got around to reading Prodigy of Thunder and it was amazing. You writing has gotten so much better through years. Also I love how it feels your books grow with audience. I feel like it's hard to really find that in most authors. So I just wanted to say thank you, you along with Neal Shusterman are my favorite authors of all time. I started reading your books when I was 15 and I'm 18 now and am looking forward to reading yours books for as long as you put books out. Thank you\n\nOh and are we ever going to see any more books with Augum, Bridget, and Leera as the main characters.\n\n* * *\n\nThis is my first time ever writing an email to an author, but such was the extent that I enjoyed reading all of your books detailing the adventures of Augum, Leera & Bridget that I had to write this right after finishing Champions Wrath. I consider myself an avid fantasy fan, having read the majority of the popular books in the genre, including the all-time classics. I can honestly say that this series, with these set of characters is now my favourite. For me, your series (both the Arinthinian Line and Fury of the Rising Dragon) are as close to a perfect story that I have yet to read, which for me indicates we’d have a great chat over a beer! I’m really looking forward to reading your work on Anna Stone next, and finally just wanted to say thank you for your hard work in creating this world that gave me such enjoyment, it will always be extremley special to me.\n\nKind Regards,\n\n—Nathan.\n\n* * *\n\nAll I can say is I loved it as I knew I would..I found it extremely hard to put down and as usual you had me captivated from start to finish with a story about one of many of my favorite characters of yours. Thank you continuing to write such amazing stories and giving me so much enjoyment in reading them.Being disabled and not able to do a lot of things I used too, I find a place to get lost in your stories and the characters you bring to life in their pages.You are a very talented author and I have enjoyed every single book you have written.\n\n—Gale\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s so funny that you just posted about the paperback copy of ‘Arcane’ as I looked on FB. I just put down “Prodigy of Thunder” for the night and was planning to message you anyway. Synchronicity!\n\nI can’t thank you enough for this wonderful story (ALL the wonderful stories!) I’m at about 50% through – maybe a bit more, and thoroughly loving it. I got Prodigy as soon as it was released but I wanted to clear all my other queued books before I started it and that’s taken a bit longer than expected.\n\nBut I’m completely invested in Anna’s journey now. It’s an emotional journey I can totally relate to and you’ve managed to get my crying several times already, which worries me a bit, because I’m certain she has much more challenges and suffering ahead. I know they will lead her to great triumphs too but my heart breaks for her already.\n\nThanks again for these wondrous adventures that are also providing much needed respite from a troubling world in challenging times.\n\nI look forward to the day that a filmmaker of talent and vision wants to faithfully adapt your books into a fabulous prestige TV series!\n\n—David\n\n* * *\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is Mattea Stevens, and I’ve been fussing over how to word this email for 10 minutes. I’m 15 years old (16 this July) and a Sophomore in High School, or tenth grade. I’d like to begin by simply saying how utterly exciting it is to finally be writing an e-mail to you, as I have wanted to do so badly since I read my first book of yours, Burden’s Edge. I don’t want to take up too much of your time, and I tend to be quite long winded (especially typing), so I’ll keep this relatively short. Your writing is an inspiration and a half to me, and you have almost singlehandedly encouraged me to continue writing. I love writing, but motivation is so hard to come by in my life that I almost never do, however finding the first book of the Anna Stone series available gave me so much joy that I’m already overflowing with enthusiasm, and I’m not even done with the book yet!! You’re an outstanding person Mr. Bronny, and I really hope you know that. Please keep writing and keep being a role model for aspiring authors like myself.\n\nWith sincere gratitude and a full heart,\n\n—Mattea\n\n* * *\n\nJust finished the new book. I wasn’t sure what to expect in a story of Anna Atticus Stone. Whatever it was, you blew me away with it. I think I enjoyed this one more than the Arinthian Line series. I was rooting for Anna from page one! Well done, Sir, Well Done! I have put you on the pedestal next to Terry Goodkind and David Eddings as my favorite authors, and if I may say so, coming from me that’s a big deal.\n\n—Jason\n\n* * *\n\nHello!\n\nI know there is probably a large chance that you might not read this but Im willing to take that chance. I just want to say that you are one of my absolute favorite authors, and you have been for a few years now. I stumbled on arcane while I was pregnant with my daughter two , almost three years ago , and I believe I read the entire series in around three weeks. I could barely tear myself away I was so engrossed in your work. I hold your arcane series at a higher regard then any other series, including Harry Potter and lord of the rings. For Christmas all I asked for was Kindle membership again so I could finish fury of a riding dragon series since I had to cut my membership off before the last book had been published. It was absolutely amazing and I am beyond excited for your newest series. I just started reading the first book a few hours ago and I can barley stop. I will always support your work. I know for a fact I’ve gotten no less then 20 people to read your series. I have a friend who just finished clash and he only started reading arcane a week ago. Keep doing the amazing work. I hope one day we’ll be able to read about more of trios adventures. I’m really holding out on them finding knowledge in ley that will help Augum and Leera continue the Arinthian line .\n\nI would love to hear back from you . I started writing my own fantasy novel and I would love pointers or ideas. Again, thank you for your amazing works. They’re a treasure and I hope nothing but the highest success from you.\n\n—Kathleen\n\n* * *\n\nJust catching up on the lastest and greatest and saw your reply to my\n\ncomment in September (yes long tine ago but what can I say work took over)\n\nWas going to take a picture ealier but felt should wait for the lastest\n\nedition which arrived last week :)\n\nWhilst I love the kindle nothing beats a good book (or 10) in the hand\n\n:) – have to say you dont realise how much you have written until its\n\nthere in the physical world !\n\nLoved every moment of learning about Anna, only bad part was the\n\ncomplete lack of sleep from pulling the all nighter to finish .. meh\n\ncant put a good book down !!!\n\nHave a Merry Christmas and my daughter and I look forward to your next\n\nbook :)\n\n—Matt\n\n* * *\n\nSever,I write this email in the midst of my own final examinations and it is with great appreciation that I do so! I’ve read all ten of your books to this point and it’s difficult to explain how much I have appreciated each one. I began reading Burden’s Edge without knowing that the Arcane Line series existed. As soon as I found out, I bought each book and read all of them from Arcane to Mercy’s Trial within 27 days (according to your tabulations to that point in 2020 the combined books contained a whopping 1.48 million words).\n\nAs a lifelong fan of the fantasy genre, I have your books topping my list of best books/book series I’ve ever read. And that is quite the feat as I’ve been absorbing books like Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, Brandon Mull’s Fablehaven series, Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea, and Christopher Paolini’s Inheritance Cycle since I was in elementary school! I’ve come to delight in the rich detail and distinct relatability of each character and their development from petulant children into strong men and women in their own right.\n\nI simply cannot explain how deeply the Prodigy of Thunder touched me. With my own life being so ridiculously busy and swinging on the pendulum of extremes from perfectionism to self-loathing like Anna, I feel a kindred spirit to the prodigy of thunder herself.\n\nAlthough, I must add, she is MUCH cooler than I am. :)\n\nEnough about me and on to the good part–the gratitude! Thank you ever so much for putting yourself out there and writing and rewriting and revising and re-rewriting these books. With all the help I know authors receive, they are often quick to choose humility in the face of achievement which I admire greatly! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\nCheers to you and those you love,\n\n—Tanner\n\n* * *\n\n[Author’s notes in bold]: The following email came to me tonight after an off-and-on correspondence with a young fan who can be found on this page by searching the name “Hailey,” diagnosed with terminal cancer at 17 years of age. Her sister Phoenix took over correspondence when she was unable to do so herself due to the cancer progressing. Only a portion of said correspondence is published here.\n\nMr. Bronny,\n\nI am at a loss of what write to you. Hailey passed away a few hours ago in her sleep. I read your last email to her and she thought you articulated as well as you do in your books. (That’s a good thing.)\n\nI think she was holding on for you to finish your last book. She would never have told you but it was a struggle for her these last few months.\n\nI want to thank you again so much for all you did for her, even though you never met her, it meant more than anything to me and her. To take the time to write to someone you didn’t know takes such an amazing person.\n\n—Phoenix (Hailey’s sister)\n\nPhoenix also said the following to me in the prior email, after having read Prodigy of Thunder to her sister: “She [Hailey] wants me to thank you for taking her on a final journey and adventure.”\n\nMy reply to Phoenix, to pass on to her sister, was as follows:\n\n[LETTER START]\n\nOof, talk about a gut punch. I shed tears reading that. I truly did.\n\nWas the wait worth reading about Anna’s trials? Because she suffered. You two had that in common–suffering, that is. But you weren’t lonely. You had your sister. Anna’s sister was cruel. But at least Anna had Bun-Bun. I hope you had a Bun-Bun too.\n\nI find myself unable to articulate a letter worthy of what remains of your time. Forgive me my ploddings.\n\nPerhaps the lesson you have taught me best is that we should all appreciate what few moments we have left.\n\nFor what is time but a measure of joy?\n\nYou have honored me with your time.\n\nI will never forget that.\n\n[LETTER END]\n\nIt’s extremely difficult for me to articulate how much I value that this young lady spent some of her precious remaining hours reading my work and occasionally emailing me. She was brave, quiet, and afraid to waste my time. My time, even though hers was far more valuable! It is beyond humbling, and I find myself at a loss for words, nor do I feel like anything I wrote to her was nearly as meaningful as her remaining hours, some of which she chose to whittle away on my books.\n\nAlthough these words may be nothing than organized bits on a screen, they represent real people, real spent time, real experiences. I thus publish this correspondence as a reminder of the value of the moment, the fragility and shortness of life, and how much words matter. Hailey taught me to appreciate what time I have left, to appreciate those whom I love, and to make sure that my words matter—that they are worthy of people’s time.\n\nLastly, I publish this correspondence to honor Hailey, a young lady I have never met, yet one who suffered greatly.\n\nMy deep condolences to her sister Phoenix and her entire family.\n\nRest in eternal peace, Hailey.\n\nOn the evening of December 10th, 2021\n\n* * *\n\nComment: Hi Sever! Or Mr. Bronny, I guess.\n\nI’m an 18-year-old Senior in high school in Anderson, SC, USA, and I was just going to let you know that I have read all of your books to date and wanted to say just how fantastic they were. I’m sure you get that a lot, but anyway. I’m going to collage to be a history major and then on to law school to be an attorney. But I have developed a passion over the years, and that’s one for writing. I was floundering a little, especially as I haven’t had the opportunity to take a creative writing class yet (It’s on the list for electives, don’t worry) I was just going to say that your books have quite the style, and once I read yours, it’s like I understand what it’s like to build a conversation with people inside a story, and with the trio especially, you can FEEL the connection there. Even if they were not warlocks, I feel like even as normal teenagers you’d be able to feel that friendship. You have a unique way of writing, and you have opened my eyes in how to really write a story. I have had the opportunity to write a lot over COVID, and I have a few completed short stories, and a couple books I’m working on. I guess I should thank you for inadvertently showing me how to write, and I apologize in advance if I steal your writing style (I won’t steal your storyline though, that’s YOURS :)). It Just clicks with me! Anyway, hope you and your writing career stays well! Thanks for your time and effort in creating these fantastic stories!\n\n—Evan\n\n* * *\n\nI just finished the last line of Champion’s Wrath after reading, scratch that, devoring the whole Arinthian Line and Fury of a Rising Dragon saga. Wow. I started two month ago and just couldn’t put it down, and it has taken so much of my thoughts and dreams recently that I can scarcely believe it’s finished. I am an avid reader, but it’s been a long time since I have been that enthralled with a book! A thousand Thank You Sever for your amazing work! I came to this website hoping you planned to publish more, and here I discovered that an Anna Atticus Stone chronicle was to be released in a month: now that really feels like an early Christmas present. I. CAN’T. WAIT!!\n\nPS: oh and please write soon the next adventures of our favorite Arcaners when they build back their prestigious order. 1 or 2 million words will suffice, thank you kind sir :)\n\n—Drawbridget (comment left on author’s books page)\n\n* * *\n\nI’m so happy to receive this message from you, as I’ve been patiently waiting for your new series. Words can’t describe how much I love the world you have created in your books. I truly get lost in the reading and love the way you write your stories. My 10 year old is also excited because he has been right there with me as I read all your books aloud to him!! Im sure you hear this a lot but we truly are in our hearts your #1 Fans!!! I hope one day I’ll get to see Augum, Bridget, Leera, Anna on the Big screen. I truly believe it would be as big or bigger then Harry Potter. Anyways I don’t wanna bore you with my ranting. God Bless you and your Family Good Sir and may you live a long and healthy life!! Wow If you can’t tell , Im extremely excited!!!\n\n—Danny\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Just finished the Last book!\n\nComment: Hey! I just finished reading/Listening to the last book of Fury of a Rising Dragon. It took me longer than usual because I didn’t want the story to end! I ordered the 4th book within an hour of it being released and was so glad that I did. I would take it everywhere with me just in case I had a spare minute when I had to wait in line, or at an appointment. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Leera, even though me as a person related more to Bridget because of her matter-of-fact way of thinking and her big heart. The way she puts other people’s feelings before her anger and her own feelings. The way she always gives the benefit of the doubt and is so kindhearted. She is a true Empath which is, in its self, a hard road to walk. I WISH I was more like Leera. She has such a loving spirit, and she gives into her own desires just for the fun of it. It may not be the smartest thing, but it will for sure be much better than what they are supposed to be doing! Her Love with Augum is so tender and playful, I love their hearts together.\n\nMy favorite part of all the books is the antagonist at the time. Sounds weird but I like those scenes because of how much they go through and knowing that they will overcome them somehow, and I love the satisfaction when they finally do! Worst of which was Katrina of course. She got away with EVERYTHING throughout the books, it made my blood boil for them! I think I really liked the old mentor Harvus they had while Anna was on the run. I say “like” but I love to hate that guy! He just made it so easy. I just really enjoyed growing with the Trio and their friends after every heart shattering event. You can really see how they have matured and learned from each situation. Someone says they have to take on the world, they shrug and say “no one else will, so I guess we will give it a try.”\n\nI’m really look forward to learning more about Annas youth and her story. I am also very much looking forward to what the Trio is in store for next! I am excited for it all. Every heart ache, breakdown, catastrophic event, just so I can see how much more they are going to grow form it all. I seriously cannot wait and will be looking forward to reading every word.\n\nThank you for writing this story. It is by far my favorite series of all time. I am a major reader have been from a kid. I have read all the Lord of the Rings books, Hobbit, Harry Potter, 90% of Brandon Sanderson’s Universe and so many others, but your story is what I hold close. I cry with them and laugh with them like I have never done before with a book. I was listening to the very end of the last book on my dive to work when you dropped that bomb about Leera and it was all I could do to keep it together when I got to work! Very few people really understand the connection you can create with characters that “don’t exist.” They are as real as anyone in my heart. So again, THANK YOU and please never stop writing. Those books have been, and always will be, a light in a dark place for me.\n\n—Lacey\n\n* * *\n\nI have severe dyslexia but books have always been my escape from life and it’s troubles and when audible was launched I was hooked o listen to books all day while I’m at work 10 hours. Then I listen while I make dinner and wait for my wife to get home from work. In less then 3 years of having the app I have listened to over 250 books and most multiple times. You’re series have been one of my top 2 since I found arcane.\n\n—Trai, via Author’s Facebook page.\n\n* * *\n\nI just discovered your books literally last week haven’t been able to put them down they are amazing! The robin augum fight was some of the best writing I’ve had the privilege of reading.\n\nIncredible. I don’t know any other way to describe your books other than incredible. Not long ago I finished the Harry Potter books start to finish and I can tell you with full confidence that as much as I loved not only those books but countless other ones, that your books are by far my favorite I’ve books that I’ve ever read. The way you’ve told the stories had a way of trapping you in those pages where the rest of the world disappears and I feel as if I’m standing right beside the trio cheering or mourning or just as mad as they are in situations in the book. These books will forever remain in my life and intend fully to give my daughter the chance experience these books these works of art. I cannot wait to see what else you write in the coming years. Thank you for this opportunity!!!\n\n—Steven (via author’s Facebook)\n\n* * *\n\nI just finished reading through all of the Arinthian books for the third time, and what a joy it is every time. I am very excited to read about Anna’s story!\n\nIn reflection after finishing Champions Wrath, I do so hope that after getting to experience Anna’s story, that more is to come on the legendary trio with the adventures they experience throughout their life.\n\nI also hope with all of my being that a legendary spell from Ley can give [REDACTED DUE TO SPOILER]. But only after MUCH more adventures in Sithesia and perhaps the unknown beyond. Maybe an unknown ancient evil beyond Sithesia that Anna learns about in Ley and warns the trio about.\n\nJust some thoughts, day dreams and ideas. I won’t charge anything if you decide to use them for inspiration. ;)\n\nThanks again for all that you do.\n\n—Sean\n\n* * *\n\nHi\n\nIt’s been quite a while since the last time I emailed (where has the\n\nyear gone?!)\n\nI began re-reading the series, starting with Arcane (obviously).\n\nI’m nearly finished with Arcane, and I have noticed how much\n\nforeshadowing and little hints you littered throughout the manuscript!\n\nAll the books that Mrs. Stone was reading at Mt. Barrow when she\n\nfirst found Augum for instance (I’ve used my kindle to mark the\n\nothers, but I don’t have it with me right now).\n\nI don’t have any new favorite characters (Still Jez, Leera, and Augum,\n\nprobably in that order) but I definitely have a new-found love for the\n\nseries. I can’t wait to read your new book (early, even, as I’m on the\n\nART! Yay!)\n\nI also finally bought the first 5 books in paperback format. It just\n\nlooks so much nicer on the bookshelf than a kindle ;) I’ll send a\n\npicture when they arrive. And maybe some day, when the world is less\n\ncrazy, if you do a book tour (or heck, even a movie tour!) I could\n\nbring my favorite and snag an autograph. Perhaps.\n\nI hope all is well, best wishes for you and your family!\n\n—Andrew\n\n* * *\n\nHi, I got Arcane for Christmas last year and as soon as I started reading it I new I needed to read the rest. Thank you for writing these amazing books.\n\n—Andrew (different Andrew than one above)\n\n* * *\n\nDear Mr Bronny,\n\nMy name is Christina and I wanted to say I absolutely loved your series. I started the first book a month ago and subsequently tore through the entire series. The rules of Archanery you applied to the world of Solia were flawless and the characters inspiring. I look forward to reading your next book and I hope you continue with the world of Solia, maybe even them going to lay and facing a threat there as adults with Mrs. Stone? Thank you for allowing me to live alongside the trio and their friends. Jez and Ning are brilliant and I loved Ning laughing when they teleported castle Arinthian. I also hope you regale us of tales of Leland as his story has just begun. Thank you,Christina Ps. How do you come up with the dialog? Absolutely brilliant\n\n—Christina\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Finishing the series\n\nHello! In March of this year [2021], my friend suggested that we do a book club together. His suggestion was this book series called “The Arinthian Line,” which he had already read and loved. Well, 5 books later and I had found my absolute favorite book series. I am an avid reader and have read many brilliant books and stories; however, the character development, raw emotions, philosophy, and life lessons of your books are unmatched so far. It was so easy to fall in love with Bridget, Leera, and Augum!!! I just feel obliged to express my gratitude to you for writing such brilliant books that have helped me escape into an amazing world during a very hard few months. Truthfully, my family has gone through much turmoil and hardship since 2021 began, yet I have found comfort in the words and teaching of your books. I just finished Mercy’s Trial (Spirit of the Dragon is amazing, by the way) and am eagerly starting the last book, Champion’s Wrath, today. Each book just gets better and better. I am astounded by your talent and ability to not only create more fascinating storylines (like introducing Arcaners and dragons!), but to also further develop the characters that we already know so intimately. I have always had an immense amount of respect for authors who can create a different world altogether that a reader can live in for a time—i personally think it’s one of the most beautiful parts of life. And your mastery of the art of beautiful story-crafting has affected my life in so many more ways than can be described. I hope you never stop writing and I very much look forward to future series!!\n\nThank you again for writing this magnificent story of Augum, Bridget, Leera, and all the other beautiful characters.\n\nMuch gratitude,\n\n—Elise\n\n* * *\n\nComment: Mr. Bronny,\n\nThank you so much for writing your books. Its been a while since I last sent an email to you but life, you know? When Mercy’s Trial was released, I read half way through it but when you introduced the path archons, I got huge anxiety for it and had to not read the book till I was in a better mind set. That time was recent. I not only started the series again, but finished the rest of the series. OMG!!! SEVER!!! I absolutely loved it! When I finished the books late last night, I felt this empty feeling that I haven’t felt in so long. I am in love with your writing. When you first wrote The Arinthian Line, those books saved my life. They gave me something to look forward to doing when in a low point of my life. Now, I cherish all your books and all are close to my heart. I was very [SPOILER REMOVED] by what happened to Leera, but I also see the plot point and why you did so. To counter balance the last of the edgeworth with the end of arinthians. Also could be a possible quest?!!\n\nThank you so much,\n\n—Toby\n\n* * *\n\nHi Sever!\n\nI’ve never written to you before, but I’m about 70% through Mercy’s Trial and trying not to read too fast, because I can’t imagine a time when I don’t get to escape into the trio’s world on my lunch breaks or every night when I go to bed.\n\nI started the Arinthian Line in October last year when the pandemic and all the social events of 2020 were a bit too much. Finding those books gave me somewhere to go to get away from reality and I couldn’t be more grateful. Now that I’m into the dragon series and 2021 is really looking up, I appreciate your intermittent focus on true social injustices and how the trio’s ethical and moral values shine through in their own Era.\n\nSo, I actually started this email a couple months ago, and about 15 seconds ago, I finished Champion’s Wrath. I’ve spent the last 7 months with Augum, Leera, and Bridget (and tons of other characters of course) and I feel such a huge hole in my heart knowing I turned that last page. I’ve been anticipating this very feeling and intermittently forced myself to take a few days off reading to prolong the inevitable.\n\nFrom day one, when I started reading about the complex structure of the degrees and spells and the elements, to the very last battle using the simul of the dragon and frenzy, I’ve been blown away by your extreme creativity and imagination. I’ve also been so impressed with the character development, and wondered how you managed to keep such well defined personalities for every character, but also portrayed a massive amount of growth and maturity! The relationship between Augum and Leera is a whole other topic in itself, I just love them so much!\n\nEven though I physically spent most of the last year stuck inside, walking the dog, or at work like everyone else, I consider myself much more lucky than others! I’ve gotten to witness the exploration of castles, floated through infinite darkness to the brink of starvation, survived the wrath of extremely dangerous creatures in a beautiful jungle, flown through the skies, found true love, dueled in an arena to an almost deafening chant, teleported through the arcane ether, smelt the rotting stench of a massive wraith while fighting to survive, been reunited with lost loved ones, conquered evil with the power of true friendship, and SO much more.\n\nUltimately, I just wanted to say: Thank you so much Sever. I will forever look forward to every new book you publish!\n\nSincerely,\n\n—Katy\n\n* * *\n\nRespected author,I’ve never emailed an author before. Please ignore my use of words. I don’t know if you will read this email but I really love your series and characters. The trio is awesome. My favorite character is Leera Jones. I really hope this series becomes famous one day. Harry potter is nothing compared to ‘fury of the rising dragon’ and ‘the Arinthian line’. I really wish this series would become a movie one day. I recommended this book to my friends but they don’t have a kindle so they can’t read it. I wouldn’t be lying if I told you this is my all time favorite book. I can’t wait for the fifth book of ‘fury of the rising dragon’. I hope you solve Leera’s ‘issue’.\n\nWith love,\n\n—Anonymous\n\n* * *\n\nEvening/Morning Mr. Bronny,\n\nI am unsure as if you would see this email with the possible swamp of others you may have. But I still wanted to reach out and give you as much praise for the book series you have crafted as I possibly could. I say this with my full heart, that your books are the best fantasy books I’ve ever read. And I read a lot. From the romance to the fighting, the relationships to the lore, everything is just amazing. You had me crying laughing shouting and smiling all the way through the trios adventures. I’m saddened to see that Augum won’t continue his lineage, but I think the sadness is an excellent touch. Gotta have those lows to have highs in books and I respect it. Furthermore, I have to say, you really know how to capture a reader since I read ALL of Champions Wrath in less than 4 days. It is an impecable piece of art, and I highly look forward to reading more of the trios adventures. I also look forward to reading more lore and seeing more of what the group has in store for them. And one more thing, just thank you. These books helped me get through Covid and a lot of hard patches. You are incredible and I really really enjoy your books.\n\nSincerely,\n\n—Payton\n\n* * *\n\n@SeverBronny Honors price was THE TRUTH. Great experience. Thanks for the ride. Im gonna take the next two a little slower. I don’t want it to be over just yet. Well done.\n\n—Tweet to author\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nLet me say good sir that it has been a joy to read your work. As you posted this I finally finished the latest story. It was hard as i had started it when it came out and then my father got covid and succumbed to it. As I stumble thru the days with grief and anger, I picked up the book again and found a welcome escape, into the most intense story of the trio yet. Tho i have a long way to go to heal, know good sir, that your story helped my troubled soul in this time. I will forever be a fan and will always be in anticipation of your next work. Hope to one day see the trios story get the series or movies they deserve and will support all over again in that medium. Thank you @severbronny from the bottom of my broken heart.\n\n—comment via author’s Instagram\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: My Appreciation and Upmost Respect For Your Work\n\nComment: Hello Mr. Bronny,\n\nMy name is Brandon I began my journey through all of your stories about 3 years ago and I must say each time I am just blown away by the stories they hold. I have just finished your most recent story within the span of 3 days and I am already in suspense for the next story. I just wanted to let you know that each story has left me with a sense of pure joy and eagerness. Throughout these difficult times your stories have helped me escape to a better place. For that I just wanted to say thank you and I look forward to whatever else you have in plan.\n\nSincerely,\n\n—Brandon\n\nP.S.\n\nGive my boy Brandon Summers some more fight scenes I’d love to see him in action :)\n\n* * *\n\nHope all is well Mr. Bronny. I’ve just been waiting and thinking about your next book and can’t wait to read it. While I’ve been waiting I have almost went thru Rick Riordan’s Trials of Apollo. His books are great and I’m a big fan of a lot of different stories and stuff. That being said I’ve honestly never read a story that fulfilled my love of fantasy and imagination like yours. You are truly a master at your craft and I feel privileged to have had the chance to read all your books. Everyone I’ve read fills me up fully , but also makes me hungry for more if that makes since. Looking forward to your future stories and wish you nothing but the best.\n\n—Danny\n\n* * *\n\nRespected author,I have never emailed an author before and I’m sorry if I make any spelling mistakes. But I love the Arinthian line series and the fury of the rising dragon. I can’t wait for the fifth book!!! I adore Leera Jones. I can’t express on words how much I love her. I really hope the books are converted into a movie and if they are I would love to play the part of Leera Jones. I don’t know if I’m a good actor but I’d love to at least audition for her part. I’m rereading both the series now and I’m noticing way more details. I mean its way better than harry potter. Harry Potter is not even half as good as the series you wrote (I apologize for criticizing hp). I love the book a lot!! Thank you for writing this awesome book.\n\nThanks\n\n—Anonymous\n\n* * *\n\nWonderful books. Loved all of them. I hope you continue such amazing writing and don’t rush them. I even got my wife to read your books and she loved them too. We constantly find ourselves making references to different parts of the books. Truly the best book series and characters EVER!\n\n—Anonymous, via author’s discussion page.\n\n* * *\n\nHi Mr. Bronny,\n\nA year ago I was diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 17 and reading became my whole life. Before I was diagnosed I had read religiously, but after, reading became my new home and adventure. I found your series on my Amazon account and since then have been glued to reading and re-reading it. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter but I think yours might top them!\n\nI got lost in your world and I can’t thank you enough for the hours I got lost in your books and took me away from all the cancer treatments and being a kid in a hospital 24/7.\n\nI am hoping you continue your writing and that the next journey you write will come out before I go so I can get lost in yet another journey.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n—Hailey\n\nHello, Hailey.\n\nI do not know what to say, other than I am truly sorry about what has stricken you so cruelly and unfairly. I don’t think any words of mine will be any consolation, and perhaps I will only cheapen what you are going through by trying.\n\nI am glad that my beloved trio have lent you some happiness. And don’t worry, it won’t be their last story (I plan to write about them as adults. For now, I am writing a story about Anna Stone’s first term; it’s just I need a break from them–and they me–after writing them for nine years straight).\n\nHave you ever read a book titled “The Last Lecture?” It’s about a young man who knew he only had so much time left, and so he squeezed the juice out of what he had, a lesson for us all to appreciate the most precious thing of all . . . time.\n\nAll my best to you and those you love, Hailey,\n\n—Sever\n\nMr. Bronny,\n\nJust the fact you’ve written back is enough to make me happy forever. So many writers don’t have enough time to write back to fans and I can’t think of a better gift you’ve given me. I am so excited to hear you are writing more of their story and Anna Stone’s! I think that those adventures will be quite a story. I’ve had so many ideas of where Anna had begun in her lifetime and my brain has gone wild trying to figure out what went on past the little tidbits you have suggested in previous books. If you ever want a fans perspective just let me know. (Although I know you need no help in the matter.)\n\nThank you so much for the book suggestion I will for sure be reading it in the next few days…or hours!\n\nMuch thanks,\n\n—Hailey\n\n* * *\n\nComment: Hello,\n\nLast Christmas, my parents gave my older brother Arcane, and he quickly read it, as well as checked out all of the other The Arinthian Line books. He then, not even a week ago, introduced me to your books, which I really love. I’ve not finished the series (I’m in Valor), but I have been engrossed with these books ever since. I’ve always judged how well an author creates his characters by how I react to them. If I had to have an issue with your books, it’s that the characters aren’t real, and I can’t go hang out with them (because that would be the coolest thing to ever happen to me). So, I want to thank you for creating these books, because a) they’ve given me something to do in my free time b) inspiring to me write (I’ve always loved writing, but kind of fell out of it, and your books have brought me back into the writing world), and c) for giving me something that my siblings and I bond over. We’re all working on getting each of the spells memorized so we can have fake battles using them.\n\n—Brynn\n\n* * *\n\nI just wanted to drop a note and say hi. I hope that your writing is going well. I am looking forward to the next book. If you haven’t been told lately, your work is important. You bring joy and entertainment to so many people, including me and my kids. Even when things get tough, remember that what you do, and you yourself, are important.\n\nSome of us have a calling to teach, like I do, some have a calling to be doctors, lawyers, mechanics, engineers, and so on.\n\nYours is to write. You have a gift, and I am glad that I am able to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Thank you for all you do.\n\n—Robert\n\n* * *\n\nI’m not sure I really know where to begin with this letter other than thank you for the wonderful books you have written over the years! I recently finished Champion’s Wrath, and I loved every moment of thestory, beginning to end. I think seeing Augum, Leera, and Bridget persevere through so many hardships has in a way inspired me to better myself. This year I am a Freshman in College after missing the last 1/4 of my senior year at highschool due to the pandemic. I was taking an amazing class called Creative Writing with an equally amazing teacher who was in the process of publishing her first fiction novel. She was an amazing teacher that I believe first truly began kindling my aspirations to became an author myself. However, the transition to online classes meant I never had the opportunity to properly thank her for all she had done for me, or even say goodbye. Our school also neglected to hold a graduation ceremony for safety precautions and even though I understand why and support it, I could not but feel robbed of that moment that should have been mine. That moment where all my hard work through school should have paid off, in a way similar to the Trio’s victory and parade through Blackhaven. I believe my point in saying all that jibberish was to just say thank you for concocting such a wonderful, entertaining, touching, and inspiring story. I believe that I want to become a fantasy Author one day and have the competence to create my own world, my own characters, and my own rules in a manner as magnificent as yours. If you have read this far into my simple email to you, I sincerely appreciate it and the time you spent reading some poor kid’s email among thousands you must receive. And if you have the time, might I ask for some help or insight on how to become a writer?\n\nAgain, thank you so much for the wonderful story. I anxiously await the next installment in the series and to see the next tale from Sithesia! And we all hope to one day become as honorable and humble as Augum Arithian Stone.\n\nSincerely,\n\n—Max\n\n* * *\n\nLet the heralds know that it took more than a month, but I finally finished all nine of Sever Bronny’s books, cover-to-cover, in a row. It was absolutely incredible to see the trio’s journey in full, and a reminder of how hard Mr. Bronny has worked. Thank you Sever Bronny for one of the best literary adventures of my life!\n\n—Ben (comment left on author’s Discussion page)\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Champions Wrath\n\nComment: I just finished your newest book and I had write to you to gush about how great was! I know at 48 years old I am not your typical fan, but you are my favorite author. I am learning disabled so I don’t connect with most adult books. I have to say that I cried my eyes out during the scene where Augum goes to clean Atrius Arinthian’s tomb and he breaks down. I haven’t cried so much since the last Harry Potter book! I can’t wait to see what you have in store for the trio in the future.\n\n—Amy\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Letter of appreciation\n\nComment: Good day Mr. Bronny\n\nI have been a follower of you for a few years now, but this is the first time writing to you. I recently finished your latest book and would like to thank you. I absolutely love the world you have created. After every one of your books, I can’t help but dream and think about the world and story for a few weeks, especially after Champion’s Wrath. The plot twist with Leera not being able to have children has really messed with my head a bit, that was really surprising and unanticipated. I would also like to commend you on doing a brilliant job with the after-effects of the dragon simul. The fight scene was really well written and showed the brutality of the spell without stretching it out to long or turning the reader against the main characters.\n\nI can’t express how glad I am to read that you will be continuing to build on the story as I truly feared Champions Wrath would be the last book after reading your endnotes in both Champions Wrath and Mercy’s Trail. I hope you choose to give a time skip in the next book, as a twenty-something I always ask myself what Augum would be like at my age, after finishing at the academy. Not only have the responsibility of building and expanding the order but also struggling with the thought of hitting his sealing without achieving level 20 in the lightning element. Having the same struggle as Jez did in one of your previous books. As someone who only has a few good friends, I’m trying to imagine Bridget’s reaction to the news of Augum and Leera not being able to have children and the thought of the Artherian line coming to an end. In my imagination, I can truly see her offering to carry Augums child much like a sperm transplant in the real world but being done with some crazy unheard of spell. You have built yourself such a good base with so much to build on, you truly are incredible.\n\nAnyways, I am not trying to prescribe how to write your books, I just get very excited when thinking of the story. Thank you for bringing this story to life in such a wonderful way, I truly can not wait to see what happens next.\n\nKind Regards,\n\n—Hendrik\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Fury of a Rising Dragon\n\nComment: Hi, just wanted to let you know that i absolutely LOVED these books. They are expertly written and have an amazing story line. I thought it was cool how they are 16-17 throughout this series. Just recently i turned 17 so its cool to think that kids my age were turning into dragons and getting into epic kingdom wide battles. Just wanted to let you know that these series have been great and I can’t wait to see what you do next. Looking forward to future series with our current cast of characters.\n\nWishing you the Best,\n\n—Jonah\n\n* * *\n\nHello, thank you for your literary contribution to my life! While I am a huge fan of epic fantasy my main reading preference is more grim dark like gentlemen bastards. With that said the arinthian line series was an amazing read that held my attention through book after book! And that’s not easy for me!\n\n—Tommy\n\n* * *\n\nHello Mr. Bronny! I have just finishing Mercy’s Trail on audible and am now fully caught up on the series! This is my absolute favorite series I’ve come across so far far exceeding all expectations and overtaking the inheritance cycle by Paolini as my all time favorite. I know it’s a long shot for a response but wanted to let you know how much I’ve enjoyed that series so far and if you happen to have release date for the finale coming to audible? Thanks for reading and thanks for you amazing writing!\n\n—Scott\n\nAuthor’s reply: I just signed the contract with the publisher to have Champion’s Wrath made into an audiobook. I will announce the news and a release date as soon as I have details.\n\n* * *\n\nDear Mr. Bronny,\n\nI just want to thank you so much for all the joy you’ve brought me. Arcane and Fury of a Rising Dragon are my FAVORITE books ever! Your writing is incredible, and never stop writing about Augum, Bridget, and Leera. Excited for the next books!\n\nFrom,\n\nA happy fan.\n\n* * *\n\nHey Mr. Bronny!\n\nI have just finished Champions Wrath and I loved it! I was so happy to dive back into the trio’s world. The ending was beautiful and heartbreaking, and I was kinda mad at you but I think if a reader is mad at the author than that’s a success because you know you’re reader loves your characters. I have so much respect for you and hope with all my heart you keep writing.\n\nYou’re world building is spectacular. I can see the effort you put in simmer under the pages. I love you characters, especially Leera, Augum, Bridget, Olaf, Mrs. Stone, Jez, Jengo, Sir Pawsalot, and the list goes on. I really love Leera though, for she is just amazing and I love her personality, how she doesn’t care what people think of her and she is so kind. I also love that you put a cat in the story.\n\nI do have a question. You might have answered this in the past books and if so, then I just forgot. Here is my question: Is there a specific reason that people have different elements? Why do they have the element that they have? Does it have to do with personality or there ancestry? Is there a way a warlock can guess there element before they start seeing signs of Arcanery? I was curious and needed to know, so I thought why not email the author himself?\n\nAnyways, thank you so much for writing such an epic series. I love your books. Even today at school my classmates where giving me weird looks because I was pretending to cast spells. I hope you have a good year and thanks again for writing.\n\nA faithful reader,\n\n—Kara\n\nP.S I’ve written to you before so hello again.\n\n* * *\n\nI want to start by saying thank you. Thank you for being an author who not only stands by his readers but also stands by his characters. Too many authors let the clinking of adding up coin cloud their amazing minds and thus, as you wisely put it in the back of champions wrath, taints the story. You stand by your characters and let the story unfold as only an author dedicated to his story can. And you have my eternal thanks for that as there is nothing in this world like reading a book that shakes you to your core so thoroughly that you can take a deep breathe and feel like a different person after finishing it. Many books written today do not hold an internal meaning that rings so true in the world we live in. The wisdom you have put into your books and thus shared with us incredibly lucky readers is something that I have come to adopt into my own life. Namely the words spoken through the ancient one Esha. ‘We must not let ourselves fall into the trap of living in the past, but instead humble ourselves before the thing that matters, the moment. Among many other memorable quotes another that rings true especially in the dark year we have endured is from Laudine, ‘Quarrel, quarrel for the light. Know naught but darkness should you lose the fight.’ which has so much meaning and so many contexts that is again something I have chosen to live by. But I digress for you of course fondly know these quotes as they come from your own wisdom portrayed by valiant characters. None the less I thank you again for bringing such passion and wisdom together to create these beautiful works of art. And humbly beg you to please never lose sight of what truly makes your stories what they are. And that is your passion and devotion to letting the characters flow rather than fit a mold anyone tries to put them in. Once more, thank you, and I will forever await the next beautiful writing to see where our heroes journey to next.\n\nSincerely,\n\n—Nicholas\n\n* * *\n\nHi Sever how are you? I hope you had a great Holiday season. I was so hoping you will write about Mrs. Stone when she was young. Plus i love the way you bring your stories to life. Your characters seem so real. It’s like you are right there with them. I hope you don’t mind me emailing time to time. I would be embarrassed to tell you how many times i have read your books. But they take me away from my troubles.\n\nYour great fan,\n\n—Evey\n\n* * *\n\nWhen I got champions wrath for christmas I had just started reading the arinthian line series for a third time and I refuse to skip books. So I read the arinthian line and the fury of a rising dragon series for a second time before reading champions wrath. I got so stuck to It that I read for roughly 15 hours straight. At the end I felt like bawling and now a day later I still do. Just go to show how great your series is and how life like the characters feel. Your series is the BEST fantasy series for me up there with Eragon. I love them and will continue to love them forever. (who know maybe your belief in them created there universe somewhere in the vast multiverse)\n\n—Ian (comment left on discussion page)\n\n* * *\n\nI just finished the book. I read and re-read both series before reading it.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThank you for many hours of reading pleasure.\n\nI am 66 years young and have always enjoyed the fantasy and sci-fi type of books.\n\n—Casey\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Your writing\n\nSubject: Nothing in particular, just some comments\n\nComment: Hello,\n\nJust a quick introduction, my name is Jack, 15, and I have been reading your books ever since you released “Arcane” in the Arinthian Line series. Ever since then my parents have been giving one of your books every Christmas, when they are usually released, which I am sure it isn’t a coincidence that they are always released just be fire Christmas. Anyways, I have always enjoyed your books, my parents gave me champions wrath this year as a Christmas gift, which I finished in just two days! I will say it may be my favorite of you books so far. While waiting for your next book in 2021 I will probably re-read the arinthian line and fury of a rising dragon again… I thought all of your books were great. The only thing that I ever… Not necessarily disliked but, perhaps it just annoyed be a little bit, was in clash and riven, maybe just a little do but of the “my love” between augum and leera, them again this is just my personal opinion, and the books are already written so I suppose I am just being nit-picky, but it just seemed like any time augum or leera addressed each other they always used the phrase “my love”. Just my opinion but I would love to hear your opinion on this. Anyways, I am excited to hear about your new book and I look forward to reading more of your work! Thanks for being such a creative and amazing author!\n\nThanks,\n\n—Jack\n\n* * *\n\nI’ve just finished reading Champions Wrath and it was amazing. I can officially say now I’ve read all your books so far. Your stories to me are amazing and when I start reading about the trio , the adventure grabs me and I have a hard time setting the book down :-) Anyways I thank you for sharing these stories and look forward to more and I hope there are a lot especially since the trio are currently 17years of age. Thanks, I wish you and your family the best hope you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n—Danny\n\n* * *\n\nHoly freaking crap I absolutely loved this book and series! I cannot wait to see what you do with the upcoming years of their lives! Absolutely brilliant man. I laughed and cried (witch isn’t easy to admit, being a soldier and firefighter that I am) (all tough and stuff). Bud I appreciate you and can’t tell ya how much I have learned about myself, and how much I enjoy reading about these courageous young men and women. I couldn’t put this book down and had to remember to eat lol. I especially love the relationships of each character and how just when it would seam all is lost they come through! I had times when I seriously thought there is no way Augum was going to get out of this situation and you were going to have him taken out to find him press on and triumph. Seriously loved that. For example: when he ported after killing Tyranecron, and fighting with Katrina, had to fight off the two soldiers while in reversion from the dragon simul without arcanery… freaking blood pounding awesomeness! Good work sir. Please keep going and I am soo looking forward to the next chapter in their lives! I’ll be checking my email for the next release every so often for the next book as I did this one. I’m already excited to read on. You’ve got me hooked good sir! Best wishes and God bless.\n\n—Dakota\n\n* * *\n\nComment: Hello,\n\nI recently finished both of your series- and I feel I should say this: I read a lot of fantasy. At least at the rate I currently go, I will have. I can read anywhere from one to five books in a day, depending on size and daily activities. The series that had really stuck in my heart was Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson & Heroes of Olympus, but for reasons still not all that clear to me, they kindof faded away. I think it had to do with a culmination of a couple things, but I feel that writing them would go to far off topic.\n\nHowever with that said, I can safely say that your series have sucessfully stolen first place in my heart. I found myself boiling at the fact that the leyans could have prevented Leera’s infertility and a fair number of the many of the problems simply by taking a ever so small side in right or wrong. As far as I am concerned, Ley doesn’t deserve Anna Stone, and she is only there to benefit the mortals; & I would be disappointed if Augum or any of his friends accepted an invitation to ley. I found a small amount of comfort in the ending “the future isn’t yet written”- I think that’s how the dragon series ended? And that Augum and Leera still have a chance -however small- at having a child.\n\nHowever despite the fondness I have for the characters and the world, the writing could have been slightly better. I don’t really have a place to talk as I am young and an aspiring author myself with nearly zero experience, but aspects became repetitive.\n\nNow I personally dislike romance novels, but I also understand the circle of life and appreciate a story that can underlay a building relationship without going to deep, and I feel you nearly hit the spot- given it would seem the target is for a slightly more mature audience. The problems I felt -and this is just my opinion- was that the little problems between Augum and Leera were slightly forced and over populated. I understand that what they were going through was beyond our comprehension, but that was also part of tbe problem- they made up too quickly and easily.\n\nAnd I know that sounds cruel and ill-intented, but given the horrendus stress and other problems, I find it a little hard to believe that they were always so forgiving. And yet on the other hand, the amount of violence, death, work, stress, and fighting they were constantly experiencing would’ve drove them insane- life likes to make sure it will go on- if you catch my meaning…\n\nI also felt that the love-trap incident in the beginning of the fourth book of the first series was a little exagerated and really thrown in there. However- Augum’s response to the trap and Leera’s over exaggerated response hit home so hard it took my breath away. I knew exactly how he felt when he curled up in a ball and cried until he decided to turn off his emotions like a rock- now I didn’t have the same context behind it but the same end feeling was so familar to me.\n\nI know what its like to have people rip you apart no matter what you do until your heart cant heal no more and decides to just turn into a rock- did you know that for the longest time, I could not cry? It was like my heart was a blackhole: the more offensive or painful something was to me, the more my heart seemed to not exist. I would attempt to let out my feelings in any way: talking to someone, cry, anything, but nothing worked. But when I read Augum’s response, I bawled. It felt good to feel that little bit again, and your two series made me cry twice more. Thank you so much for that. Slowly, little by little, different things are softening me up, and your stories are a major one.\n\nTalking about the fourth book of the first series, that later half of the book was amazing! Never before had I though that I would experience a three hour adrenaline surge from a book! I laid in my bed squirming with the fight or flight response of adrenaline, and it didn’t fade until I finished the book!\n\nI hope that we haven’t seen the last of the characters we have drawn close to, and most sincerely that your universe will have a little forgiveness or mercy and let Augum and Leera have a child.\n\n—Yonathan\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Connecting\n\nComment: Wanted to tell you how much I am enjoying your writings. I am 69 yrs young and love fantasy literature. Esp when dragons are involved. Since college days I have feasted on Tolkien, Lewis, then Donaldson. Even reading Tolkien’s and lewis’s mentors before them.

All the way to the end. Great book, the Champions won their fights with all of the logical means available to them. They are heroes for Solia and growing in their capabilities. Sad to see the Grizzly go, he always added a bit of controversy to the threesome. And as always you have left story lines scattered throughout the book with unanswered questions for the next book. Which makes me anxious for the next book.\n\nGee, wonder if Ms. Stone (bring her back please) will have a solution to Leera’s infertility in future stories. And the whole story of rebuilding the arcane order is waiting to be told.\n\nGreat book, one of your longest that used most of my stamina to keep reading well into the evenings missing many of my favorite TV shows. Told my wife that I finished your book, and she at last you can start on the chores list. Hum, got any other books in the works?\n\nSever, thanks again for the great week of entertainment and a story line that sticks in my head long after I read the book\n\nBest Regards,\n\n—Mike\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Great books!\n\nComment: I just finished the last book. I just wanted to say what a great book/books! My wife asked what I was reading because I couldn’t put it down. I told here it was like Game of Thrones meets Harry Potter. She was immediately intrigued.\n\nI just wanted to give you a shout out and say awesome work! Oh and how I wish it could be made a movie or HBO series. I know everyone I know would watch that!! Can’t wait to see what comes next.\n\n—Jason\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Books\n\nComment: These books are phenomenal.\n\nI cant get enough at all . Im working on the last book now. I started roughly 4 weeks ago and have to say they are fantastic. The world you’ve created is amazing. Thank you.\n\n—Eric\n\n* * *\n\nYou make great books, and I’m just writing this email because I’m a fan and I want to know what caused those scratches and gouges on castle arinthian. Also you are my favorite author and if you should never ever and i mean ever ever ever think of quitting your writing job.\n\nAlso I hope I’m not disturbing you with this email.\n\n—Sid\n\n* * *\n\nComment: Hello Mr. Bronny,\n\nFirst I just wanted to say that I am in love with these books! I am not the type of person to sit down and read a book, I am very picky and your series was perfect. I compare it to the Percy Jackson books but yours are far better. I also was wondering if you could help me with my book project, I have to think of a catchphrase or slogan that is used a lot in the first book and I figured that I would ask Sever Bronny because why not. My project is due on the 11th but I figured you would not see it in time. I was wondering if you were planning on making movies with your books, I think they would be a hit. And maybe I could be in it? I’m just kidding unless your not. But I also was curious about how you became a writer. When did you know because it seems like a dream to write books and get them published. How long did it take for the book to publish and did you base the characters off of anybody that you know personally? Thank you so much and I hope you reply!!\n\nThou dearest fan,\n\n—Loula\n\nOh my goodness, I really wasn’t expecting you to reply so quickly or even reply at all. But I really liked how you gave Augum a very determined mindset, to never give up and always give it his all. In the first book I thought that some of the minor details really made the book. I also liked all of the expeditions they went on, repairing the library, finding the map, finding blackbite, and cleaning the maids room. I also liked how u set up Sir Westwood as a role model for Augum, his teachings really stood out. Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that your books are going to keep me busy during winter break! My favorite thing is to grab your book and read all night, I end up falling asleep at around 4 am. And I also think it’s really cool that you take time out of your day to read these emails. I know other authors don’t even acknowledge them.\n\n—Loula\n\n* * *\n\nI’ve never written to an author, but this series has moved me.\n\nIn the series my eyes have teared, my pulse raced, and my heart swelled. Only moments ago having finished Champion’s Wrath, I am beside myself. I am desperately going to miss the Trio and their group of friends, Jez, and Arinthia. As well as mourn the loss of the Griz.\n\nI do not know if you will continue the series, but I deeply hope so. Not a reflective novel, but the next chapter.\n\nWith deep appreciation of your work, and love for those within;\n\n—Robert\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: The best experience I’ve ever had reading a book.\n\nComment: Thank you, Sever.\n\nChampions Wrath is the best book that I have ever read, and I mean that without a shadow of a doubt. Champions Wrath is also (in my opinion) your best book, and I know I said that about Honor’s Price as well, but thats just a testament to your phenomanal ability as a writer and your ability to constantly outdo yourself.\n\nReading this book was a highly emotional experience for me, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I cried both happy and sad tears at several parts throughout the story. You managed to perfectly portray the severity of the trio’s situation and the consequences of their actions, which made the book that much more enjoyable and immersive.\n\nOne of my favourite moments in this book was the final battle, they are such a well written scenes that play out perfectly in my minds eye, it’s like I’m watching a movie, and the sheer awesomeness of it all was palpable.\n\nThe other scene that stood out to me was [CENSORED DUE TO SPOILER]. It was so simple and yet so beautiful, something that was being worked towards for the entirety of both series.\n\nI have not hesitated and will not hestitate to reccomend your books to anyone that asks for a recommendation and to anyone who is even slightly interested in reading.\n\n“Today we become more than we are” – Augum Arinthian Stone, 15th day of the 4th month of the year 3343.\n\n—MacLayne\n\n* * *\n\nDear Sever Bronny,\n\nThank you for all of your hard work. I just finished Champion’s Wrath and what a tale it was. I started reading the trio’s adventures a little over a year ago and have blown through each of the books. After reading through the series a second time during the almost unbearable wait for Champion’s Wrath, I noticed how your writing became more and more immersive over time, pulling me stronger than Augum’s telekinesis. I’ve read the Harry Potter series many,many times, and it will always be one of my all time favorites, but I can confidently say, without a shadow of a doubt, that both of your series rank above it. I look forward to seeing your next books (after a well deserved break of course :) ).\n\nSincerely,\n\n—Nick, Age 13\n\nOmnio incipus equa liberatus corsisi mei.\n\nP.S.I hope you stay healthy and well. The world needs a great author during a time like this. :)\n\n* * *\n\nThat is so awesome, I’m almost done reading Mercy’s Trial and just love your books and the story of the Trio and all they have been thru is just , I don’t even have words. I get swept away by the story and the characters, I don’t even have words to describe how much I hope you create another series. I put your story right up there with greats, actually to me it’s better then anything I’ve ever watched or read. Anyways , just know that I love your work, look forward to more and wish you all the best in life!!!!\n\n—Danny\n\n* * *\n\nYour books are amazing. The thing I love most about your books is that you care so much about the characters and you love them.\n\n—Dylan\n\n* * *\n\nHello Sever! I am so excited to get the book!! I have been waiting for so long I feel like it’s an early Christmas present! I have been having a really difficult year. I have been dealing with work issues, family issues, personal and relationship issues as well. After my grandfather on my fathers side passed away earlier this year I have found myself struggling mentally. My grandfather on my mother’s side was diagnosed with cancer and recently we received word the treatments aren’t working as well as they hoped. I have found myself getting lost in reading the books and find myself not worrying about my issues when I am hearing all about the trios adventures. I haven’t connected with a series and the characters like this since reading Harry Potter. I just want to extend a thank you for the universe that you’ve created and the happiness reading the series gives me! I have read the entire series through three times now, I have been keeping up with the books since your first release! Sorry for the long story, I just wanted to share my gratitude for the amazing work you do!\n\nYour loyal reader and fan,\n\n—Jason\n\n* * *\n\nHello again,\n\nThanks for the reply, and thank you for the reminder that you (of\n\ncourse!) get tons of email and that remembering who sent what isn’t\n\nreally feasible ;)\n\nJust a quick context refresh, I had sent you an email near the end of\n\nseptember about how stumbling across Arcane had rekindled my love of\n\nreading.\n\n2 months and 8 books later… Now I can finally answer your questions\n\n(which I’ll answer all in the same email this time, to keep the\n\ncontext together)\n\nJez is still my favorite character, even though she ‘missed the boat’\n\nin the last book ;) Though the surprise reunion with a very Jez-like\n\nMrs. Stone made up for it!\n\nMy favorite scene… That one was REALLY difficult. There were many\n\nsections of the book that spoke to me; sometimes at a very deep level:\n\nEvery time that Augum managed to overcome one of his (many)\n\nweaknesses, every time the trio overcame some problem facing them with\n\nquick thinking and sometimes quicker action, The sorrows they faced\n\nand honestly the damage to their souls that they had to endure each\n\ntime they took someone’s life, or lost something dear to them. I\n\nespecially enjoyed watching Leera shine as the only person who could\n\nfigure out the teleport strike extension! Though the trio’s time in\n\nthe Antioc Library learning and overcoming their fears was probably my\n\nfavorite ‘arc’ if you will.\n\nMy favorite scene (or what I will consider small enough to be a scene)\n\nwas when Mrs. Stone rescued them from Bahbel. Ok, the sinkhole next to\n\nBahabel (the trio already did the hard work ;)). I believe it was “and\n\nthen he heard the most beautiful sound in all of sithesia as Mrs.\n\nStone blinked into existence” or something to that effect; It honestly\n\ngave me goosebumps the first time I read it.\n\nThe Warlock Tournament in Antioc. Augum’s final battle against\n\nRobin… and the aftermath. I really felt like I was there, watching\n\nit with my own eyes from the front row.\n\nWhile I’m definitely disappointed I missed the cutoff for this year’s\n\nART (I swear I had been watching the webpage and it was still open\n\nwhen I started Mercy’s Trial, so I thought I’d have enough time to\n\nfinish it first!) I *completely* understand. I will keep my eyes open\n\nand check back in 4-6 months as you suggested, and I cannot stress\n\nenough how much I am looking forward to your next work (and beyond!)\n\nOn a somewhat personal note, If you ever end up doing a book tour or\n\nsomething in my area, I’d love to be able to thank you in person. In\n\naddition to rekindling my love of reading, these books have helped\n\n(are helping) me get through a rather difficult personal time.\n\nThank you so very much for sharing your gift of storytelling,\n\n—Andrew\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Just finished Mercy’s Trial\n\nComment: Hi there,\n\nI must say I have thoroughly enjoyed reading your books\n\nI have read the 5 Arinthian Line books too. My son Adam recommended your books to me, and I am a 64 yr old Grandma, so they have no age or gender boundaries. I always read at night before nodding off on my trusty kindle, and whenever I am I a waiting room or when I’m not knitting hehe. During COVID I have knitted 4 jumpers for myself amongst other projects. But I just love reading your books, they keep you so intrigued and in suspense at times.\n\nI live in Regional Victoria, Australia where we are currently coming out of the lockdown, 2nd wave of COVID. All my family live in N.S.W or W.A I do hope you and your loved ones are safe and well.\n\nI will have to call me son Adam (40 yrs) and ask him what he recommends next to read while I eagerly await your 4th book. I adore Augum and the rest of the clan, and the sweet love stories amidst their serious endeavours .\n\nStay safe and well Sever, kindest regards,\n\n—Avril\n\n* * *\n\nHey sever!! I’m a super big fan of your books and was just wondering when the 4th book of fury of a rising dragon was gonna come out? I’ve read all the arinthian line books like 5 times cus I just can’t stop reading them. You have a real talent for writing and I’m so glad that you decided to pursue being an author. But yea just please if u could be able to get back to me on the release date I would be super happy. Have a wonderful day and keep writing bangers!\n\n—Justin\n\n* * *\n\nHi Sever, just wanted to say that the trios adventures really helped me out emotionally when i had to move countries and honestly all authors feel lackluster when compared to you!\n\nOn another note i think it would be awesome if the trios next adventure would take place in a world where the continent of sithesia is thriving in trade and the trio are celebrated as being the hero of not just Solia but the entire continent.\n\nAlso i think that an overwhelming, unknown outside force would be a really cool addition to the next books story, as Mrs Stone has mentioned life beyond Sithesia.\n\n—Dan (comment left on author’s Discussion page).\n\n* * *\n\nSever; I chose to use Audible as my attention span for reading has waned over the years. The last books I truly appreciated were Tolkien’s Hobbit and Lord of the Rings Trilogy. After listening to your books I am considering purchasing them and reading them they are truly worthy of the effort.I have listened to all of the books in your series and had to come to your website to see if you were working on a fourth book in the Fury of A Rising Dragon when Mercy’s Trial ended with everyone still in Leey. I was wondering how you could leave the trio there, I was very excited to see you were working on a fourth book and I can’t wait to read it.\n\n—Mike\n\n* * *\n\nHi Sever,I actually just finished the Fury of a Rising Dragon series to Book 3, awaiting Book 4! I may go back to the beginning though to read the prequels to this series, but I already know how some things turn out! haha.\n\nI’m an older reader of fantasy which is so much nicer than today’s world. Your books are quite entertaining albeit for a bit younger audience than I am (retired) but I’m finding other folks like me that enjoy these other worlds.\n\nI look forward to hearing when the next book is available. I’ll certainly leave a nice review on Amazon. :-)\n\nBest,\n\n—Anne\n\n* * *\n\nSo Mr. Bronny, I have just recently discovered your work and I have absolutely loved it so far. I have been listening to your books through audible as I don’t have much time to read but love this genre, and am able to listen while I work. Your fury of a rising dragon series has been one of my favorite fantasy series to date. I am 36 years old and upon reading a bio you wrote saw that you grew up on DragonLance books. Those books were what sparked my love of reading when I was young and it has continued to this day. Reading about the lives of Caramon and Raistlin especially hooked me. I find your work to be on par with if not better than many of those books I read as a young man and just wanted to reach out and share my thanks. Looking forward to the last book in December and can’t wait to have a reason to buy a hardcover book and make time to read it again. Keep up the great work and I’ll keep buying! Cheers!\n\n—Brandon\n\n* * *\n\nHello again :)\n\nYou had mentioned you were looking forward to my thoughts on the series as a whole…Epic.I think it took me exactly about a month to finish the entire series. I think I’ve now read more in the past month than the past decade, easily.I just felt so *attached* to the trio, and their friends and companions. The story never felt cheap, contrived, or dry. There were definitely a few times I had to cringe along with (or at) Augum, but then of course, I was 15 once too (a while ago…) :)I thought the ending was perfect. I absolutely loved the final battle; Cron wasn’t some super spell that automatically won them the day. It was just another tool in their bag! (Albeit a VERY sharp one)I also appreciated how despite the fact that they lost the scions (so far I have no reason to believe otherwise ;)) it didn’t just leave him ‘normal’ they all had the benefit of studying “in the old way”.\n\nI also just finished burden’s edge! Totally different feel to it, but I really enjoyed it still.Two last things I wanted to say. First, I really appreciate how you are able to intertwine today’s social issues into your stories in a way that doesn’t feel preachy. The surprise about Eric was just that, a complete surprise! But the way you wrote about it, and made it about the people involved and not the act of being ‘wayward’, I really wish there were more people like you.\n\nLastly, I plan to apply to the advanced reader team :) I’ll be spending some time catching up and putting my review of the series on amazon, then I’ll apply\n\nThank you again,Simply put, reading your books really makes me happy.\n\n—Andrew\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Thank you for your books…\n\nComment: First I am going to say that I love the books. I started reading them last summer and have read them all now, 3 times. First to last. Yep I can safely say that doesn’t happen very often. I have only one other series of books that I love and respect and those are by David Eddings. That being said, I personally think a story about Mrs. Stone and how she grew up, would be a fantastic way to start off. You obviously have a lot of back story developed so it would be easy to stir it up a bit and make something great! Looking forward to the last book. I love the title name.\n\nBy the way, in case you are curious about this reader, I am a Educational Technologist (Teacher) working for US Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) and stationed overseas in Japan. I work on a military base teaching students of military families. Thank you.\n\n—Travis\n\n* * *\n\nWhen will u put an update on ur blog? I want to know if you planned to release the book early, if you do I would probably scream around my house with my hands in the air. Everybody in this entire universe who has read ur books will want u to release ur book early and read it. I mean ur my favourite author and I’m itching to find out if augum achieves MASTERY and if occulus gets revived.\n\n—Comment left on author’s discussion page)\n\n* * *\n\nHi Sever! The AL and FoARD series are my favorite books and nothing even comes close! (except for Wings of Fire by Tui T. Sutherland). I read all of 1.5 million words in about two months. I hated when the Von Edgeworths stole the castle and I hated Robin so I was really happy when he got defeated by everyone he had killed. I think Laudine is a really neat character and was sad when she got left behind in the dome. I know you probably get this alot but I want to see a detailed list of spells including all of the incantations, thoughts, motions, etc. I would also like to explore the world in which they reside ‘cuz the farthest they get out of Sithesia is Crimson Tooth and that’s still in it. I also would like a list of creatures like the bears of Ohm and the things in Endraga Ra. I also wanted to know how long you think it will be before you finish every possible thing about your world including if you sell rights to a movie or game. ;}\n\nP.S. my name is Kagen. (Comment left on author’s discussion page)\n\n* * *\n\nHello Sever,\n\nMy son loves your books. I signed up for your newsletter, so I can watch for the December release. I hope the book comes out in time for me to give it to him as a Christmas gift. My son even started re-reading the series.\n\nThank you for a great series.\n\n—Julie\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you and your family are staying healthy.\n\nI was just thinking what a wonderfully way to celebrate the end of this new series ( and just in time for Christmas) would be to release some swag. Maybe an iconic bookmark, a stylish poster, or limited edition hardcover…\n\nSeriously though, do you have any plans for producing some sweet swag? I think it would be very popular.\n\n—Joel\n\n* * *\n\nI’ve re-read both series twice and just love the world you created! Can’t wait for the final book of the series. Id love to see what happens to the trio in the future and if any of them reach mastery in their element\n\n—Lucas (comment left on author’s discussion page)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nDear, Sever Bronny. I’m sure theres no harm in me simply thanking you for the story arcs you have been writing. I’m a soldier so I found myself trying to get into reading while on long training days and deployments, and your books have single handedly pulled me into the reading hobby as a whole. I look forward to your next book as well as to collecting your book series.\n\n—A Thankful Reader\n\n* * *\n\nHi,I used to enjoy reading but fell away from it over the past decade or so. I got a Kindle from my wife for my birthday this year. A friend suggested the guild wars 2 books, which I enjoyed.When I was finished with them, he recommended Arcane.\n\nI want to say it took me 3 evenings to finish… I would have loved to finish it in one sitting. I really don’t know what it was about the book that spoke to me. I can see why some people might not like it; it has a bit of a star wars/harry potter feel to it, but I loved it, because it ISN’T any of those it really manages to be it’s own unique story!I’m starting book 2 tonight.The last time I made it to book 2 in a series was when I read the Wizard’s Bane series, by Rick Cook 20 some years ago.\n\nSorry for rambling. I thanked my friend for recommending your series to me, but I also wanted to thank you for creating it.\n\n—Andrew\n\n* * *\n\nI’m so excited for this last book, I’m a huge fan of both The Arinthian Line and Fury of a rising dragon, and I feel like they really capture the spirit of a true coming of age story. Thank you for the amazing stories and I’m looking forward to reading your future books.\n\n—Richard (comment left on author’s blog post)\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: A thank you and hope everything is ok\n\nComment: Hello Mr. Bronny\n\nI wanted to write you because I had to thank you for your amazing books and I also wanted to make sure you are OK. Between your website, Reddit, and Twitter you seemed to have a mostly regular presence online but then you just completely disappeared for about the last two months. I’m sure it’s nothing but I was a little worried, I hope everything is going quite well for you.\n\nOn to the thanks, I feel it necessary because your books and that world have become my absolute favorite, and a true refuge for me at this point. And that’s not saying nothing as I just finished my 232’nd fantasy book. Maybe not a record but certainly a decent pool. Your characters are just so realistic and easy to love. Your world building is complex, interesting, and unique despite having familiar and comfortable elements. Your stories are well thought out, well written, and extremely difficult to put down. When I read each one the first time, once I finished I just immediately flipped to the front and started over. I’ve read each a minimum of 6 times. Some, like Legend and Mercy’s Trial I’ve read more than twice that.\n\nI really hope we will see Augum and Leera’s wedding in the next book. Those two more than deserve it. Their relationship is an absolutely beautiful thing and gives me hope just to read it. I also very much hope that you continue to write about their lives at different parts going forward. I can’t imagine not getting to see how they continue live and grow. My own life is considerably more boring so getting to live vicariously through them is a true blessing.\n\nHope you are well and all the best wishes for the future,\n\n—David\n\n[Author replied in full by email, but just aside for those reading, the author sometimes needs a little break from social media to finish the work. Updates coming soon]\n\n* * *\n\nI finished the 4th of 3d book(i last read it months back…I was in the book where they cross into the other world(i forgot what’s it called..forgive me)\n\nSo far…it has been the best book I have ever read…and I have read alot. The magic system is unrivalled. It is so sad to see (in my opinion) average books like Harry potter doing better than this series in terms of popularity…..\n\nI can’t wait for more books…once they are published i will binge read the whole series from start…\n\nI kinda wonder what Blackstone would have achieved if occulus’ descendants would have taught him all they knew….\n\n—Ram (comment left on author’s blog post)\n\n* * *\n\nSubject: Coming of age helped me with coming home\n\nComment: Mr. Bronny,\n\nI will start off, as most of these emails start I’m sure, By saying how big of a fan of these books I am and how I have read and reread every single one. I recommend them to all my like minded friends and it is genuinely a beautiful work of art.\n\nThis being said I have typed, erased, and retyped this very message a dozen times over the last couple years not having the courage, liquid or otherwise, to pull the trigger on it. However, I sit here in my room away from my family and have decided to take my proverbial leap.\n\nI am a US service member and have been for the past decade. Most of my life has been during the global war on terrorism and the middle third has been spent fighting it. Though I do not claim to be a special forces operator or even a traditionally combat arms ground pounder, I have been in my fair share of scrapes and close calls. I work in and around indigenous people and within close knit 2-3 man/woman groups (ring any bells?).\n\nBecause of my combat deployments and the genuine fulfillment and sense of purpose while executing my job in a combat zone where the stakes are higher and life is simpler, primal even, I have developed a certain outer crust and a slightly altered view of self worth.\n\nI write this to commend how well you capture Augum’s struggle to deal with mundane aspects of his new life as a ruler of his people and the day to day of everyday classes. Reading these parts and how closely his worth and comfort are tied to conflict, violence, and the closeness war brings between comrades helped me see the same in myself. The time I used to spend out of a combat zone felt like I was floating through a mundane and less meaningful life, apart from time with my daughter of course. I always felt I belonged elsewhere, “forever locked in war.”\n\nI have overcome such thoughts as I am here again overseas, and have forced myself to realize I am needed in other ways, but I appreciate the help your characters gave me and the feeling of home they always provide no matter where I am.\n\nI apologize for the length. Thank you for your time.\n\n—Taylor\n\n* * *\n\nI feel that there is something Sever Bronny doesn’t get enough credit for: writing female characters, most notably Bridget and Leera.\n\nIn fiction, I feel that too many writers will put their female characters up on a pedestal, declare them flawless, for fear of being labeled misogynistic. Those characters are one-dimensional and boring, and make for extremely underwhelming stories. *COUGH* Looking at you, Rey Skywalker. *COUGH*\n\nOf course, some other authors do the opposite. They only use female characters for the “Damsel in Distress” trope, and it definitely gets old after a while.\n\nYou, Sever Bronny, have not made those mistakes. Instead, we have two incredible female characters. They are incredible fighters, but they also appreciate some of the finer thing"
