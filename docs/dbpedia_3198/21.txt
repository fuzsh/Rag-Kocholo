Biography

Jim McConaughey is Notable.

Jim McConaughey is one of twins.

James and his twin sister, Barbara Frances, were born on 7 NOV 1929 in Jackson, Mississippi to Hugh Donald McConaughey and Barbara Maitland. The family was living in Meridian, Lauderdale County, Mississippi at the time of the 1930 Census.[1]

Sometime before 1935, James and his family had moved to New Orleans, Louisiana,[2] where he played football during high school.[citation needed]

After graduation, James played for the University of Kentucky as a first-string defensive end, and he was part of the team that participate in the 1949 Orange Bowl.[3]

In 1950, James was listed as a student in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky.[4] Sometime after this, he transferred to the University of Houston in the Missouri Valley Conference and played for Coach Clyde Lee.[3][5] While he was still attending University of Houston, James married Mary Kathlene McCabe on 22 Dec 1951 in Orleans Parish, Louisiana.[6]

Jim was picked up by the Green Bay Packers in the 1953 NFL Draft, but, unfortunately, he was released before the season began and never played an official NFL game.[7][8] At least one source reports that he played for a year, but this appears to be in error.[9]

In 1954, their son Michael Patrick was born in Harris County, Texas,[10] and Patrick James was born 9 years later, also in Harris County, Texas.[11]

Inexplicably, there is another marriage record for James and Kathleen dated 28 Jul 1968 in Bexar County, Texas.[12][13] Did they divorce and remarry? It was after this second marriage that their son Matthew was born.[14]

James died on 17 AUG 1992 in Fort Bend County, Texas.[15] His burial location is private.[16]
