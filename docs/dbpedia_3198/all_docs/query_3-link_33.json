        "text": "Wiltshire's homes account for 26 per cent of the county's total carbon emissions, with around three-quarters of this coming from our heating systems. Decarbonising domestic heating and improving the energy efficiency of homes is a major part of reaching net zero.\n\nGet free and impartial energy saving advice from GOV.UK: Find ways to save energy in your home (opens new window) or on 0800 444202 (freephone helpline). The Energy Saving Trust: Energy at home (opens new window) also provides information and resources to help make your home more energy efficient, reduce your carbon emissions and lower your energy bills.\n\nHere are some further energy saving resources:\n\nuse GOV.UK: Find ways to save energy in your home (opens new window) to access personalised information on energy efficiency and any grants that might be available in your area\n\nfind free or low-cost suggestions on Centre for Sustainable Energy: What can tenants do? (opens new window)\n\nfind out which appliances in your household which are contributing most to your carbon footprint on Carbon Footprint: Household Energy Consumption (opens new window)\n\nmonitor your energy usage in real-time by upgrading to a smart meter Smart Energy GB: Smart Meters - How smart meters can help to reduce your carbon footprint (opens new window)\n\nThere are two main types of energy efficient light bulbs available, Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).\n\nCFLs are what you typically think of as an energy efficient light bulb. CFLs are a cost-effective option for most general lighting requirements. Replacing a traditional light bulb with a CFL will save you around £3 per year, or £50 over the lifetime of the bulb.\n\nLEDs though more expensive to buy initially, are more efficient than CFLs and will save you more money in the long term. Replacing a halogen spotlight with an equivalent LED will save you around £4 each year, or £140 over the bulb's lifetime.\n\nWash at 30 ºC: Washing clothes at 30 °C uses around 57% less electricity than at higher temperatures.\n\nAvoiding half loads will also save energy and money; for more information visit Energy Saving Trust: How to save energy when using your washing machine (opens new window).\n\nReduce/stop tumble dryer usage; tumble dryers can be the most energy hungry of all domestic appliances, therefore the less you use it the more money you will save.\n\nDrying clothes outdoors on a washing line costs nothing and uses no energy, so it is the ideal way to dry your clothes. Indoors on a rack can also be a no-cost, no-energy solution, although you should be mindful of the increase in moisture levels. Keep the room ventilated so that that moisture doesn't turn into damp.\n\nIt is best to look at how you can improve and reduce the energy use of the existing building first ('fabric first approach'), prior to installing low carbon technologies. There are a range of measures that can be undertaken from simple steps, such as draught proofing, to large scale works, such as external wall insulation. A well-insulated building will allow low carbon heat technologies such as heat pumps, to then work most effectively.\n\nIf you are renovating your home, consider the following:\n\ninsulation and draught proofing - as you work on the building you may be able to identify problem areas, or things that could be improved. Well insulated homes require less energy to keep warm. This costs you less money and reduces your carbon footprint. For more information visit Energy Saving Trust: Draught-proofing (opens new window).\n\ncan you use more environmentally friendly materials? Embodied carbon is important (the emissions from the production and shipping of the material) as well as thinking about how it will be reused or recycled at the end of its life.\n\nreducing chemicals in your home and furnishings - this affects indoor air quality so chemicals and ventilation are important to consider when you may be making your home more air tight to avoid carbon emissions and keep cosy.\n\nbuild in low energy solutions into your renovation project - think about your heating, appliances (energy rating, and switching to electric cooking), lighting and smart controls\n\nasking your contractors questions - even if they haven't got the answers you will raise awareness that there is demand for greener solutions.\n\nFor further information visit:\n\nCentre for Sustainable Energy: Resources (opens new window)​\n\nCentre for Alternative Technology Charity Limited (CAT): Info & Resources (opens new window)\n\nEnergy Saving Trust: Energy at home (opens new window)​\n\nEnergy Saving Trust: Installing renewables (opens new window)\n\nGOV.UK: Find ways to save energy in your home (opens new window) - Government endorsed advice site\n\nFutureProof (opens new window) is a pay for service to help homeowners and builders in the South West of England (including Wiltshire) to carry out energy saving home improvements and refurbishments with confidence.\n\nThe following information has been developed by Bath and North East Somerset Council, but provides detailed useful information on different retrofitting options and how these can relate to different house types. Bath & North East Somerset Council (BANES): Energy efficiency, retrofitting, and sustainable construction supplementary planning document (opens new window) and Bath & North East Somerset Council (BANES): An introduction to the typical house types (opens new window).\n\nHistoric buildings, in particular those that are listed, need careful consideration as to what technologies and measures can be installed, but there are growing examples of how this can be done. Historic England provide some good information, with case studies. For more information visit Historic England: Energy Efficiency and Retrofit in Historic Buildings (opens new window)​ or Historic England: Low and Zero Carbon Technologies (opens new window).\n\nWarm and Safe Wiltshire (opens new window) is a commitment by Wiltshire Council, Swindon Borough Council, Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, in partnership with the Centre for Sustainable Energy. The initiative aims to give residents access to advice and support to improve energy efficiency and fire safety in the home. This initiative supports people who are unable to afford to heat their home and are exposed to potential health risks associated with living in cold homes, such as respiratory conditions.\n\nReducing your waste is about cutting down the amount of waste you make and is a great way of reducing your impact on the environment.\n\nFor some tips on how to reduce your waste visit Reducing your waste and composting.\n\nAs well as reducing the amount of waste going to landfill, recycling helps conserve raw materials and protect natural habitats.\n\nAll our clothing can be either reused or recycled. See Love Your Clothes (opens new window) for lots of ways to make the most of your clothes.\n\nIf something is broken, consider repairing instead of replacing.\n\nNot sure if an item can be recycled in Wiltshire? See What you can bring to a HRC.\n\nReduce food waste: A third of the food prepared does not make it from farm to fork. Producing uneaten food squanders a whole host of resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labour, money - and generates greenhouse gases at every stage. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.\n\nBuy local food\n\nBuying Wiltshire produce supports Wiltshire's economy, reduces your 'food miles' and means you know exactly where your food has come from. It's fresher, it's tastier and it's good for Wiltshire.\n\nBalanced diet\n\nMost of us need to reduce the amount of dairy and meat we consume. Eating meat and dairy less often could allow more of us to afford to support better quality local meat and dairy.\n\nBuy British\n\nGrazing land for imported meat and the need for land to grow animal feed is the single greatest driver of deforestation, including in the Amazon, which has major consequences for biodiversity loss.\n\nWhy not try to adopt meat free Monday into your week.\n\n68% of all car journeys taken across the UK are under 5 miles (and 23% are under 1 mile). The latest local authority carbon dioxide emissions data (opens new window) shows transport is one of the largest contributors to Wiltshire's carbon footprint at 45%. If we had just one car free day every week, we could save over £120 a year on petrol bills and around 300 kilograms of CO2 emissions as well.\n\nInformation on how to travel sustainably can be found on the Connecting Wiltshire (opens new window) website.\n\nTo find out more about electric vehicles visit Energy Saving Trust: Low carbon travel (opens new window).\n\nA commuter can typically save around £1,000 a year by car-sharing. Car sharing is a great way of alleviating the stress caused by travel and reducing road and parking congestion. Liftshare has found that by sharing regular car journeys rather than travelling alone, you can cut your carbon footprint by over 10% a year.\n\nCar clubs are a great new way to get access to a car without the costs or stress of ownership. They can give you the flexibility to use a car at work, while commuting by public transport. Businesses can also save money using car clubs instead of operating pool cars. If you drive less than 6000 miles a year, a car club can save you up to £3,500 every year.\n\nA list of car clubs in Wiltshire can be found on the Connecting Wiltshire - Car Clubs (opens new window) website.\n\nClimate change makes water an important resource in your garden. Using less water in your garden not only saves you money, it helps the water industry ensure we all have water during peak demand, and don't forget water from your tap also has a carbon footprint!\n\nUsing mulches and homemade compost is one way of saving water, by keeping it in the soil there is less need to water your garden.\n\nCollecting, storing, and re-using makes use of the water that falls on your garden and can help with the expected increased frequency of water shortages.\n\nFor more information visit: RHS (The Royal Horticultural Society): Managing water in your garden (opens new window)."
