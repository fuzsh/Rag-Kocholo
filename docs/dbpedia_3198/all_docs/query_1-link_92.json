        "text": "WEAVERVILLE – James Donald Yelton (Don) a resident of Weaverville passed away at his home on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. After multiple hospitalizations in 2023, Don was able to spend his last week at home enjoying time with his wife Deborah, friends, and his beloved “fur baby” Molly and Molly’s best friend, Bella. The number of friends Don leaves behind is innumerable.\n\nDon was born in Asheville, the youngest son of Wilma Duck Yelton and William Clarence Yelton. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Deborah Metcalf Yelton; sister-in-law, Margie Yelton; brother-in-law, Rodney Metcalf and wife Marcia; two nieces, two nephews, five great-nephews and two great-nieces; multiple cousins in both the Yelton and Duck families. Don is predeceased by his parents, and brother, William Dwight Yelton.\n\nDon graduated from UNC-Asheville in 1970 with a double major in Biology and Psychology. He earned a Master’s degree in Biology from East Tennessee State in 1972 and a Master’s degree in Environmental Systems Engineering from Clemson University in 1976. He was a member of the honor society Phi Kappa Phi. Over the years, his employment tapestry was a colorful one – ranging from Water Quality Management, sales, and teaching in college. He was nothing, if not diverse.\n\nDon was a man of principle and conviction, who never backed down from what he believed. He was a man of strong faith, which was never in doubt. He was a member of Newbridge Baptist Church for many years.\n\nTrue to Don Yelton form, he did not want a traditional funeral with “weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth”. A Celebration of Life will be held at 11:00 am, Saturday, August 26, 2023, in the Beth Anderson Family Life Center at Newbridge Baptist Church, 199 Elkwood Avenue, Asheville, NC 28804. Reverend Clark Henderson will officiate.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to your favorite charity.\n\nWest Funeral Home is honored to serve Don’s family."
