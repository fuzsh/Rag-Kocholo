Our partnership number is OC399656 and our registered office is:\n\nChippenham Community Hospital\n\nRowden Hill\n\nChippenham\n\nWiltshire\n\nSN15 2AJ\n\nWe are an NHS partnership formed by the three local Foundation Trusts which serve Wiltshire:\n\nGreat Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\nRoyal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust\n\nSalisbury NHS Foundation Trust\n\nWe are responsible for the delivery of adult community health services in Wiltshire, with our contract extended to 31 March 2025.\n\nWe have our own Board, dedicated leadership and plan. We draw on the expertise of committed professionals, along with drive and the ambition to work in partnership with organisations across Wiltshire to care for our local population.\n\nWe have a long term plan for services and know we can only achieve our aims by forming effective partnerships with GPs, primary care, social services, our acute partners, mental health services, voluntary sector organisations and engaging with the people of Wiltshire.\n\nWiltshire Health and Care is a member of the Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire (BSW) Partnership Integrated Care System (ICS).What are integrated care systems?Integrated care is about giving people the support they need, joined up across local councils, the NHS, and other partners. It removes traditional divisions between hospitals and family doctors, between physical and mental health, and between NHS and council services. In the past, these divisions have meant that too many people experienced disjointed care.Integrated care systems (ICSs) are new partnerships between the organisations that meet health and care needs across an area, to coordinate services and to plan in a way that improves population health and reduces inequalities between different groups. Since 2018, they have been deepening the relationship in many areas between the NHS, local councils and other important strategic partners such as the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector. They have developed better and more convenient services, invested in keeping people healthy and out of hospital and set shared priorities for the future. The NHS Long Term Plan confirmed that all parts of England would be served by an integrated care system from April 2021, building on the lessons of the earliest systems and the achievements of earlier work through sustainability and transformation partnerships and vanguards.\n\nWith each part of the country now ready to function as an ICS, NHS England and NHS Improvement has asked the Government and Parliament to establish ICSs in law and to remove legal barriers to integrated care for patients and communities. Decisions on legislation will now be for Government and Parliament to make."
