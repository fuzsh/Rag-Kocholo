They may face other practical challenges, for example unstable housing, poverty and discrimination.\n\nThe care pathway within the service involves Moving On After Trauma (MOAT) groups and one-to-one specialist trauma-focused psychological support.\n\nWe also provide wellbeing initiatives, such as a walking group and art group. These are run by our recovery coordinators, working with voluntary sector partners where possible.\n\nWe work closely with Bristol Refugee Rights, Borderlands, Mind and Unseen to ensure our service users receive specialist support across their different needs."
