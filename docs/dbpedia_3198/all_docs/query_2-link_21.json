        "text": "James Donald Tarter, a beloved husband, father, educator, coach, and friend, passed away on January 12, 2024, at the age of 71. James was born on January 6, 1953, in Lubbock, TX as the only child of the late A. T. and Bernice (Setliff) Tarter. He happily grew up on a farm outside of New Deal, Texas with his parents and grandparents. James graduated from New Deal High School in 1971, then he received his B.S.Ed. from Lubbock Christian College (now LCU) in 1975. Later, he received his M.Ed. from Texas Tech University in 1996.\n\nJames dedicated himself to education and spent 30 years as a coach, teacher, and vice-principal, shaping the minds and hearts of his students. He began his coaching career in Kress, TX before coming to Shallowater, TX in 1980, where he spent the majority of his career. James treasured his time spent at Shallowater working with the other coaches, educators, and students both on and off the field. Although he coached other sports, his true passion was football, where he was the defensive coordinator. In later years, he coached in both Post, TX and at Lubbock Estacado. He retired from education in 2006, but his hardworking spirit, stubbornness, and wife wouldn’t let him fully retire. He got back to his childhood roots of agriculture by becoming a Crop Insurance Adjuster, which he continued until the time of his death.\n\nOn June 4, 1983, James and Kathy (Harding) got married at the church where they first met in the spring of 1982. 5 years later, in the heart of football season, they welcomed Shelly Kathleen, whose arrival, according to James, helped the Mustangs win their football game the next day in overtime. Then, 2 years later, they welcomed Julie Kathryn in the middle of basketball season, which he jokingly said got him out of working the Shallowater Shootout that weekend.\n\nA man of God with integrity and compassion, James nurtured meaningful connections with everyone he met and was dearly treasured by his family. He is survived by his loving wife, Kathy, and his two devoted daughters, Shelly and Julie. His presence will also be deeply missed by his extended family and friends who were privileged to know him and call him Coach.\n\nTo summarize his years with Kathy, Shelly, Julie, the rest of his extended family, colleagues, the coaches, his students, and his players, James would reference one of his favorite songs, “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life”.\n\nCoach Tarter’s family kindly requests that donations be made in his honor to the Children’s Home of Lubbock at https://childshome.org or a charity of your choice, to continue his legacy of making a positive impact within the community."
