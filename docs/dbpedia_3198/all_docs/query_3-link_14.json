        "text": "The Start of a Career\n\nThe media interest soon turned nationwide and the seven year old Stephen Wiltshire made his first steps to launch his lifelong career. The same year he sold his first work and by the time he turned 8, he received his first commission from the British Prime Minister to create a drawing of Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nIn February 1987 Stephen appeared in The Foolish Wise Ones. (The show also featured savants with musical and mathematical talents.) During his segment Hugh Casson, a former president of London's Royal Academy of Arts, referred to him as \"possibly the best child artist in Britain.\"\n\nCasson introduced Stephen to Margaret Hewson, a literary agent who helped Stephen field incoming book deals and soon became a trusted mentor. She helped Stephen publish his first book, Drawings (1987), a volume of his early sketches that featured a preface by Casson. Hewson, known for her careful stewardship of her clients' financial interests, made sure a trust was established in Stephen's name so that his fees and royalties were used wisely.\n\nHewson arranged Stephen's first trip abroad, to New York City, where he sketched such legendary skyscrapers as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, as part of a feature being prepared by the London-based International Television News. Meanwhile in New York Stephen met Oliver Sacks.\n\nSacks was fascinated by the young artist, and the two struck up a long friendship; Sacks would ultimately write extensively about Stephen. The resulting illustrations from his visit - along with sketches of sites in the London Docklands, Paris, and Edinburgh - formed the basis for his second book, Cities (1989), which also included some drawings of purely imaginary metropolises.\n\nAt about this time Stephen embarked on a drawing tour of Venice, Amsterdam, Leningrad, and Moscow, attracting crowds wherever he stopped to draw. He was accompanied part of the time by Sacks, who was conducting research for a new book on Stephen's story. These drawings testify to an assured draughtsmanship and an ability to convey complex perspective with consummate ease. But more importantly, they reveal his mysterious creative ability to capture the sensibility of a building and that which determines its character and its voice. It is this genius which sets him apart and confers upon him the status of artist. His third book, Floating Cities (1991), contains the elaborate drawings he made on the tour.\n\nIn 1992 Stephen accepted the invitation of a Tokyo-based television company to tour Japan and make drawings of various landmark structures, including the Tokyo metropolitan government building, in Shinjuku, and the Ginza shopping district. He then traveled to America once again, a trip that resulted in the book American Dream (1993), which featured cityscapes of Chicago, San Francisco, and New York, as well as the desert landscape of Arizona.\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen's artwork was being exhibited frequently in venues all over the world.\n\nSell Out Exhibitons & City Panoramas\n\nIn 2001, he appeared in another BBC documentary, Fragments of Genius, for which he was filmed flying over London aboard a helicopter and subsequently completing a detailed and perfectly scaled aerial illustration of a four-square-mile area within three hours; his drawing included 12 historic landmarks and 200 other structures.\n\nIn late 2003 the Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham, England, held the first major retrospective of Wiltshire's works, spanning a period of 20 years; more than 40,000 visitors attended the exhibit, shattering the gallery's attendance records.\n\nStephen took on his largest project to date in May 2005, when he returned to Tokyo to make a panoramic drawing - the largest of his career - of the city. Two months later he drew a similarly detailed picture of Rome, including the Vatican and St. Peter's Cathedral, entirely from memory.\n\nIn December, after a 20-minute helicopter ride, Stephen spent a week creating a 10-meter-long drawing of Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour and the surrounding urban scene. (He dedicated the work as a Christmas present to the city's residents.) Later on he added Frankfurt, Madrid, Dubai, Jerusalem and London to his collection.\n\nThe following drawing in the series was of his spiritual home, New York where he embarked a five day marathon drawing on a 6 metres canvas live on CBS.\n\nFurther trips followed to Sydney, Shanghai, Brisbane, Singapore, Istanbul, Houston, Mexico City and Doha, Qatar later.\n\nArtist of Many Talents\n\nContrary to the popular misconception that Stephen is only interested in capturing architecture and classic american cars, he often draws portraits of celebrities and close friends in his private sketchbook. Stephen started creating caricatures of his teachers at primary school, and has since then produced many caricature 'snap shots' documenting amusing incidents encountered on his trips abroad as well.\n\nStephen Wiltshire's passion for buildings, cityscapes and skylines continuously inspires him to revisit his favourite cities as well as discover new destinations while travelling the world. In a recent interview in New York he revealed that the most intriguing qualities of an exciting city must have 'chaos and order at the same time, the avenues and squares, skyscrapers as well as traffic jams, the chaotic rush hour and people'.\n\nIn January 2006 it was announced that Stephen was being named by Queen Elizabeth II as a Member of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his services to the art world. \"It's an absolute honour,\" his sister, Annette, told Geoffrey Wansell for the London Daily Mail (January 3, 2006). \"It brought tears to my Mum's eyes and to mine, because we've all worked so hard for Stephen.\"\n\nLater that year, with the encouragement of Annette and her husband, Zoltan, Stephen Wiltshire founded his own permanent Art Gallery in London's Royal Opera Arcade, London's oldest shopping arcade. The popular artistic venue moved to more spacious premises in West London in 2019. Stephen's new private Art Studio is now located in Chelsea Harbour, London welcoming his collectors on an appointment only basis.\n\nGenius Grows Up\n\nIn July 2014, Stephen was commissioned by Singapore PH to create a panoramic drawing of the city, which became part of the National Collection of Singapore to celebrate the nation's 50th birthday. 150,000 visitors attend his exhibition in just 5 days, setting an attendance record in the history of the country.\n\nTrips followed to Istanbul, Houston, Mexico City and Doha, Qatar. In 2019, the newly redesigned 80th floor observatory of the Empire State Building, New York officially reopened bearing Stephen's design based on his panorama drawing of the city he created in 2017 in the very same building as a part of his live drawing show. The $165 million redevelopment also includes a new 10,000 square feet museum space where visitors can purchase reproductions of our artist's work.\n\nDid you know?\n\nFavourite artist\n\nStephen's favourite artist is Richard Estes.

Stephen is also a regular guest at Apple's London flagship store to demonstrate his digital sketching skills at public events.\n\nStephen Wiltshire Phd\n\nHe earnt his postgraduate degree in drawing and printmaking at the prestigious City & Guilds Art School in 1998.\n\nMusic\n\nStephen has perfect pitch and had been endorsed by The Royal College of Music to perform his piano and singing skills.
