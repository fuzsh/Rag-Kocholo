        "text": "New York, NY – October 10, 2017— Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: ESRT) today announced that it commissioned internationally acclaimed artist Stephen Wiltshire to create a one-of-a-kind piece to be on display at the Empire State Building. Following a 45-minute helicopter ride around Manhattan, Wiltshire will draw a cityscape on canvas with the Empire State Building as its centerpiece – live and from memory on the 80th floor of the Empire State Building. The London-based artist’s progress will be visible to Observatory visitors as he draws from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily beginning Tuesday, October 10, 2017, and culminating on Saturday, October 14, 2017.\n\n“Stephen Wiltshire has a truly special gift, and we are thrilled to share his enormous talent with visitors to the Empire State Building,” said Anthony E. Malkin, Chairman and CEO of ESRT. “We are excited to offer guests the unique opportunity to observe Stephen create his work throughout the day and watch his progress throughout the week. We are eager to see his final creation and look forward to proudly displaying it at the Empire State Building in the future.”\n\nSince age 3, Wiltshire has communicated with the world through the language of drawing. He was an award-winning artist in children’s art competitions, and he received his first commission from the British Prime Minister at age 8. In 2006, he was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to the art world, and later that year founded his gallery at the Royal Opera Arcade in London.\n\nWiltshire’s unique talent and fondness for cityscapes have taken him around the world to Tokyo, Madrid, Dubai, Jerusalem, Singapore, Sydney, Shanghai, Istanbul, Mexico City and Rome, among many other locations. New York City remains a favorite metropolis, second only to his home in London.\n\n“After many, many years of traveling and sketching cities across the globe, I always come back to Manhattan as a place for inspiration,” said Wiltshire. “The Empire State Building has long been my favorite building in the world, and while I had the opportunity to sketch it in 2015, I am eager to create a piece that will find a home in the world’s most famous building for years to come.”\n\nAbout the Empire State Building\n\nSoaring 1,454 feet above Midtown Manhattan (from base to antenna), the Empire State Building, owned by Empire State Realty Trust, Inc., is the “World’s Most Famous Building.” With new investments in energy efficiency, infrastructure, public areas and amenities, the Empire State Building has attracted first-rate tenants in a diverse array of industries from around the world. The skyscraper’s robust broadcasting technology supports major television and FM radio stations in the New York metropolitan market. The Empire State Building was named America’s favorite building in a poll conducted by the American Institute of Architects, and the Empire State Building Observatory is one of the world’s most beloved attractions as the region’s #1 tourist destination.
