        "text": "Gabriela M. NaiMe\n\nResearch Assistant\n\nGabriela M. Naime is a recent graduate of the University of Texas at El Paso, completing a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience with a concentration in Psychology. Raised as a part of a military family and military tradition, her upbringing occurred both in the United States and overseas. Despite the moves required of her family, Gabriela has spent almost half of her life in El Paso and, with deep family roots in Texas, she considers El Paso to be her true home. Her introduction to research began in her sophomore year of college at El Paso Community College. While at EPCC, she was granted the honor of candidacy in the RISE Bridge Research Program. A part of RISE, Gabriela focused her studies and research work in microbiology and neurobiology. It was there she found her greatest passion to be for neuroscience, which she later pursued at UTEP. As a student at UTEP, Gabriela has worked in several labs, including those focused on behavioral psychology, computational biological sciences, and neuropharmacology. Gabriela plans to continue her education in graduate school and work toward a career in clinical research, contributing to efforts in increasing accessibility and effective alternative treatment within mental healthcare. Her work with Dr. Wilshire and as a part of the Wiltshire Lab for Teachers and Children will enable her to explore new facets of research that will help diversify her experience and solidify a strong foundation for her future academic endeavors. She is most excited to collaborate on a project highlighting an important, yet underrepresented demographic of individuals, aligning with her goal of utilizing research to extend opportunity and give voice to those that deserve to be heard."
