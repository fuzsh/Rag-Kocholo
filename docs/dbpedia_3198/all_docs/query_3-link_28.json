        "text": "Watch Stephen Wiltshire and sister Annette making an appearance on stage at PINC in Sarasota, Florida in December 2019. Annette and Stephen talk about growing up, struggles, willpower, inspiration, ambitions, diligence and achievements in their first ever live debut together.\n\nBorn 1974, who knew that a young boy diagnosed with autism in the mid-seventies would grow to become an outstanding and inspirational international artist, renowned for his extraordinary ability to recreate everyday urban living, and downscale to a size that can be proudly observed on any wall, whether at home, office, galleries and museums.\n\nStephen Wiltshire MBE FSSA now in his forties continues to wow the crowd with his ability to absorb detail to its finest.\n\nMy name is Annette, his sister. Having observed this all my life it baffles me still. Naturally, pride and a sense of accomplishment resonates. His skills are infectious, spreads rapidly and injects joy, recollection, a memory we all relate to when we recognise a specific building, which holds dear memories.\n\nStephen has grown, he had developed his talent further and continues to be a perfectionist.\n\nHis admiration for architecture is humbling. His knowledge is puzzling but appreciated.\n\nAs a creative audience awaits in haste to see the next masterpiece. We can only honour and respect when his pencil will once again flow across the pad and show its existence of well organised lines forming its image, and make the importance of the pen as important as the paper.\n\nAnnette Wiltshire"
