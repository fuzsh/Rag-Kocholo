        "text": "Jim began working at a young age with his dad and older brother Larry in the woods. He worked multiple jobs before hiring on with the Alger County Road Commission. After 40 years of dedicated work, he was able to retire. Jim instilled his strong work ethic in his children and grandchildren.\n\nIn 1966, Jim married Gloria Tyner and together they raised their four children. They were married for 34 years before she passed away in the spring of 2000.\n\nJim enjoyed working with his “spoiled” draft horses. He loved watching the horse pulls in Champion and Escanaba. He was always happy to talk about horses. Jim didn’t pay much attention to new shiny things, but a rusty horsedrawn plow behind an old barn always caught his eye. He really enjoyed spending time with Joe Zimmerman talking about mules and horses.\n\nAnother great joy he had from a young age was motorcycles. He rode many miles with his great friend Terry Nolan. He also enjoyed riding and spending time with his cousin Pat Milligan and wife Deb. Jim passed down his love of bikes to his sons and they enjoyed many trips together.\n\nSome of his other hobbies were spearing pike in the ice shack with his boys and often nephews. He also loved to deer hunt at his camp and in the later years in the blind behind his house.\n\nJim loved his dog Augie. He was always by his side. Jim enjoyed taking Augie to Akerman Lake where they often met new friends. They put many miles on the road in the truck.\n\nAbove all, Jim loved his family. He cherished Sunday dinner with his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Jim travelled with his daughters to San Diego to see his grandson. A few years later he travelled with his family to Maine and was happy to have seen both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans in his lifetime. Every Friday Jim looked forward to a lunch date and scenic drive with his daughter Carol “Boots”. During the week (he perhaps didn’t look forward to) his daughter Bonnie “Punk” was at his home lovingly nagging him to do this or that. Jim was always eager to help his sons Dan and Steve with whatever projects they had going on or just to have a cup of coffee on their back porch.\n\nJim’s greatest pride was the family he raised with Gloria. Providing a good home and instilling values were very important to him. His children could attest, “We couldn’t have had it any better. He was a great father, Papa, and friend.”\n\nJim is survived by his children, Carol (Jeff) Seger, Bonnie (Tom) Johnson, and Steve (Kristi) Charlebois; daughter-in-law, Julie Begovac; 13 grandchildren, Chase and Grace Seger, Brittany (Keith) Maki, Jacques (Molly), Cole, and Charlotte Charlebois, Gloria, Ruth, and Marlene Johnson, Stella, Jacob, Andrew, and Sam Charlebois; six great-grandchildren, Myron and Hesper Maki, Heidi and Iver Charlebois, and Gracelynn and Danielle LaBreck; sisters, Mary Charlebois, Janet Beauleau and Franny Hakkola. He was preceded in death by his wife, Gloria Charlebois; son, Dan Charlebois; brother, Larry Charlebois; and sister, Joyce Newton.\n\nA gathering for friends and family to celebrate Jim’s life will take place on Friday, July 19, at Jim’s home beginning at 5 p.m."
