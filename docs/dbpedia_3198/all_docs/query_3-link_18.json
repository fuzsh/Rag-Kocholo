        "text": "Here's a handful of people you may know- or may be surprised to find out - lived or worked in the unique market town of Devizes.\n\nDo they make you proud to be from here?\n\n1. David Domoney\n\nYou might recognise his face from TV, as Domoney currently co-presents the TV gardening programme Love Your Garden with Alan Titchmarsh, and is the gardener on ITV1's This Morning.\n\nHe was born back in 1963 in Devizes and had two siblings. He is also the son of Raymond Domoney, who was a British Telecoms senior executive.\n\nDomoney later attended Moseley School in Birmingham, leaving in 1979, aged 16.\n\nHe went on to further study at Warwickshire College of Agriculture and the rest was history as he fell in love with all things outdoors, and gardening.\n\n2. Charlotte Waylen Tebay\n\nTebay was born in Devizes and was one of the first females to work as a philatelist. She helped to organise the first stamp exhibitions in London.\n\nShe was one of the first members of the Royal Philatelic Society, London, being elected in April 1876.\n\nIn 1897, Tebay was one of the first collectors to exhibit the primitive Ugandan Cowrie stamps.\n\nShe died on December 22, 1901, at the age of 82.\n\n3. Charlotte Long\n\nOne person who has certainly done the town proud is Charlotte Long.\n\nCharlotte Helen Long was a British actress, the youngest daughter of the 4th Viscount Long.\n\nShe was born in Devizes where she attended the Fitzmaurice Grammar School until its closure in 1980 and then St Laurence Comprehensive School.\n\nShe played Eloise de Ricordeau in the first series of the BBC Drama The Tripods but died before filming the second series.\n\nLong was the victim of an accident on the M4 motorway when a lorry unfortunately crashed into her parked car after it had broken down.\n\n4. Daniel Ings\n\nActor, Daniel Ings also grew up in the market town.\n\nIngs attended Dauntseyâ€™s school before going on to pursue Theatre studies at Lancaster University.\n\nHe later went on to land a big break with Netflix, where he played Luke in the rom-com Lovesick.\n\nHe has also been in Channel 4's Pete versus Life, the BBC's Psychoville and W1A, as well as Sky 1's The Cafe and the Billie Piper drama I Hate Suzie."
