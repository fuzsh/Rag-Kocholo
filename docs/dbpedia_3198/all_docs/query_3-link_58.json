        "text": "A major impediment to clinical implantation of pharmacogenetic information is the availability of cost-effective clinical tests at the time of prescribing. A major initiative of our program has been to develop a pharmacogenetic assay that is\n\ncomprehensive in covering all of the genes with prescribing guidance available (currently 22 genes),\n\ninexpensive to perform ($100),\n\npreemptively tested in order to provide the information in advance of prescribing drugs and\n\nguided with a report to educate clinicians and patients regarding the outcome of the assay.\n\nTo develop this project, we have used a methodology called MIPs, which stands for molecular inversion probes. This approach is essentially a custom pull-down or capture of the 22 genes for which we wish to determine genetic information. We can capture those genes for each patient and fully sequence them to identify genetic variation. The genetic variations are interpreted according to already published guidelines as to the patient’s responses to various drugs. These data allow us to produce a report for each patient which details their responses to over 100 drugs that can then be used to provide the guidance for “the right drug or the right dose of drug” on an individualized basis.\n\nPharmacogenes that we target in PGx1:\n\nABCB1, BCHE, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, DPYD, G6PD, HLA-A, HLA-B, IL28B, ITPA, NAT2, NUDT15, RYR1, SLCO1B1, TPMT, TYMS, UGT1A1, and VKORC1"
