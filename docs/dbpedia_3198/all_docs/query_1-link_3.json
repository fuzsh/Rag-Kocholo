        "text": "James Robert MacGeorge Donald was the fourth son of a Presbyterian Minister.\n\nThe six-foot, eleven-stone actor made his first professional stage appearence on the London stage in October 1938 in \"The White Guard\" but would not achieve theatrical stardom until 1943`s \"Present Laughter\".\n\nHe made his debut in British films in 1942, fitting quite comfortably into the stoic war-era mold with roles in such noteworthy military sagas.\n\nJames projected the idealism of the scientific visionary. He specialized in playing authority figures; military officers, doctors or scientists. Donald also appeared regulary in many TV dramas in the UK and the USA, as well as on stage.\n\nIn 1961 James was nominated for an emmy for his role as Prince Albert in Victoria Regina.\n\nJames Donald retired from acting because of his poor health.\n\nIn later years, he grew grapes and made wine in Wiltshire."
