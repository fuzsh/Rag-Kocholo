        "text": "The population passed half a million\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of Wiltshire increased by 8.4%, from around 471,000 in 2011 to around 510,300 in 2021.\n\nThe population here increased at a similar rate to the overall population of the South West (7.8%), but by a greater percentage than the overall population of England (up 6.6% since the 2011 Census).\n\nIn 2021, Wiltshire was home to around 1.1 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 1.0 in 2011. This area was among the lowest 15% for population density across English local authority areas at the last census.\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was higher in Wiltshire than across the South West\n\nPercentage population change, Wiltshire and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% South West ▲7.8% Wiltshire ▲8.4% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nAn older Wiltshire\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of Wiltshire increased by two years, from 42 to 44 years of age.\n\nThis area had a similar average (median) age to the South West as a whole in 2021 (44 years) but a higher average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 50 to 64 years rose by around 15,800 (an increase of 17.0%), while the number of residents between 35 and 49 years fell by around 9,700 (9.4% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 50 and 64 years increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nFamily in Wiltshire\n\nWiltshire saw the South West's joint second-largest percentage-point rise (alongside Torbay and East Devon ) in the proportion of households including a couple with only non-dependent children (from 5.9% in 2011 to 6.5% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Swindon saw a greater rise in the percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children (from 5.7% to 6.5%).\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children increased from 5.6% to 5.9%, while the percentage in nearby Test Valley increased from 6.5% to 6.6%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children in Wiltshire increased by 0.6 percentage points\n\nUnpaid care in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 4.6% of Wiltshire residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 7.4% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, 1.6% of residents (aged five years and over) reported providing between 20 and 49 hours of unpaid care each week, compared with 1.2% in 2011. The proportion of Wiltshire residents (aged five years and over) that provided at least 50 hours of weekly unpaid care increased from 2.2% to 2.4%.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Wiltshire (2.8 percentage points) was similar to the decrease across the South West (2.8 percentage points, from 7.5% to 4.7%). Across England, the proportion fell by 2.8 percentage points, from 7.2% to 4.4%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Wiltshire decreased by 2.8 percentage points\n\nReligion in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 41.3% of Wiltshire residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 26.5% in 2011. The rise of 14.7 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in Wiltshire. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 29.3% to 44.1%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 50.2% of people in Wiltshire described themselves as Christian (down from 64.0%), while 6.0% did not state their religion (down from 7.7% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 41.3% of usual residents in Wiltshire reported having \"No religion\"\n\nWiltshire residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 438,600 Wiltshire residents said they were born in England. This represented 86.0% of the local population. The figure has risen from just under 412,100 in 2011, which at the time represented 87.5% of Wiltshire's population.\n\nWales was the next most represented, with just over 9,800 Wiltshire residents reporting this country of birth (1.9%). This figure was down from just over 10,200 in 2011, which at the time represented 2.2% of the population of Wiltshire.\n\nThe number of Wiltshire residents born in Scotland fell from around 8,700 in 2011 (1.8% of the local population) to around 8,300 in 2021 (1.6%).\n\nIn 2021, 86.0% of Wiltshire residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nHealth in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 50.5% of Wiltshire residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 48.9% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" fell from 34.5% to 34.0%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of Wiltshire residents describing their health as \"very bad\" was 0.8% (similar to 2011), while those describing their health as \"bad\" remained 3.2%.\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nIn 2021, 3.2% of usual residents said their health was bad in Wiltshire\n\nPeople looking after their family or home in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 3.8% of Wiltshire residents (aged 16 years and over) said they were economically inactive because they were looking after their family or home. This figure was at a similar level in 2011 (3.6%).\n\nThe percentage of people who were economically inactive because they were looking after their family or home increased from 3.3% to 3.7% across the South West. Across England, the percentage increased from 4.0% to 4.8%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were looking after their family or home (economically inactive) in Wiltshire increased by 0.2 percentage points\n\nNational identity in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 4.8% of Wiltshire residents did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK. This figure increased from 3.6% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, 1.5% of residents identified with a UK and non-UK national identity, compared with 0.6% in 2011. The percentage of residents in Wiltshire that identified as \"British only\" increased from 17.1% to 57.5%.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK was greater across the South West (1.7 percentage points, from 4.4% to 6.1%) than in Wiltshire (1.2 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 1.7 percentage points, from 8.2% to 10.0%.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in Wiltshire increased by 1.2 percentage points\n\nFewer adults working long hours\n\nWiltshire saw the South West's largest percentage-point fall in the proportion of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week (from 15.8% in 2011 to 12.2% in 2021).\n\nWest Devon saw the South West's next largest decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week (from 18.0% in 2011 to 14.5% in 2021).\n\nEvery local authority area across the South West saw a fall in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week, as the regional percentage fell from 13.3% to 10.8%.\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults in employment who worked 49 hours or more in Wiltshire decreased by 3.6 percentage points\n\nMore adults never married or in a civil partnership\n\nOf Wiltshire residents aged 16 years and over, 30.3% said they had never been married or in a civil partnership in 2021, up from 27.4% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just over one in two people (51.1%) said they were married or in a registered civil partnership, compared with 53.7% in 2011. The percentage of adults in Wiltshire that had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership increased from 9.5% to 10.0%.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who had never been married or in a civil partnership was greater across the South West (3.5 percentage points, from 31.1% to 34.7%) than in Wiltshire (2.8 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 3.3 percentage points, from 34.6% to 37.9%.\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who had never married or registered a civil partnership in Wiltshire increased by 2.8 percentage points\n\nChange in housing in Wiltshire\n\nOf Wiltshire households, 66.8% owned their home in 2021, down from 67.5% in 2011.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of households that owned their home was greater across the South West (1.6 percentage points, from 67.4% to 65.9%) than in Wiltshire (0.7 percentage points). Across England, the percentage fell by 2.0 percentage points, from 63.3% to 61.3%.\n\nThe rate of home ownership in Wiltshire decreased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nDisability in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 6.0% of Wiltshire residents were identified as being disabled and limited a lot. This figure decreased from 6.8% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, just over 1 in 10 people (10.4%) were identified as being disabled and limited a little, compared with 9.6% in 2011. The proportion of Wiltshire residents who were not disabled remained at 83.6%.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot was greater across the South West (1.1 percentage points, from 8.1% to 7.0%) than in Wiltshire (0.8 percentage points). Across England, the proportion fell by 1.6 percentage points, from 9.1% to 7.5%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in Wiltshire decreased by 0.8 percentage points\n\nEthnic groups in Wiltshire\n\nIn 2021, 2.1% of Wiltshire residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category, up from 1.3% in 2011. The 0.8 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of people from the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" ethnic group increased from 2.0% to 2.8%, while across England the percentage increased from 7.8% to 9.6%.\n\nIn 2021, 94.3% of people in Wiltshire identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 96.6% in 2011), while 1.7% identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category (compared with 1.2% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" category increased from 0.7% in 2011 to 1.1% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 2.1% of usual residents in Wiltshire identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales.
