The family was living in Meridian, Lauderdale County, Mississippi at the time of the 1930 Census.[1]\n\nSometime before 1935, James and his family had moved to New Orleans, Louisiana,[2] where he played football during high school.[citation needed]\n\nAfter graduation, James played for the University of Kentucky as a first-string defensive end, and he was part of the team that participate in the 1949 Orange Bowl.[3]\n\nIn 1950, James was listed as a student in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky.[4] Sometime after this, he transferred to the University of Houston in the Missouri Valley Conference and played for Coach Clyde Lee.[3][5] While he was still attending University of Houston, James married Mary Kathlene McCabe on 22 Dec 1951 in Orleans Parish, Louisiana.[6]\n\nJim was picked up by the Green Bay Packers in the 1953 NFL Draft, but, unfortunately, he was released before the season began and never played an official NFL game.[7][8] At least one source reports that he played for a year, but this appears to be in error.[9]\n\nIn 1954, their son Michael Patrick was born in Harris County, Texas,[10] and Patrick James was born 9 years later, also in Harris County, Texas.[11]\n\nInexplicably, there is another marriage record for James and Kathleen dated 28 Jul 1968 in Bexar County, Texas.[12][13] Did they divorce and remarry? It was after this second marriage that their son Matthew was born.[14]\n\nJames died on 17 AUG 1992 in Fort Bend County, Texas.[15] His burial location is private.[16]\n\nSources\n\n↑ United States Census, 1930,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XM16-TW1 : accessed 21 July 2022), James D Mcconoughey in household of H D Mcconoughey, Meridian, Lauderdale, Mississippi, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 16, sheet 2A, line 6, family 23, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 1153; FHL microfilm 2,340,888.\n\n↑ 1940 Census: \"United States Census, 1940\"\n\nciting Affiliate Publication Number: T627; Line: 20;\n\nFamilySearch Record: VYPB-CNG (accessed 27 July 2022)\n\nFamilySearch Image: 3QS7-89MR-5W2X\n\nJames D McConaughey (10), single son, in household of Kathryn C McConaughey (1) in New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana, United States.\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 El Paso Herald-Post, El Paso, Texas; 17 Sep 1951, Mon, Page 11 (https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8989411/)\n\n↑ 1950 Census: \"1950 United States Federal Census\"\n\nUnited States of America, Bureau of the Census; Washington, D.C.; Seventeenth Census of the United States, 1950; Record Group: Records of the Bureau of the Census, 1790-2007; Record Group Number: 29; Residence Date: 1950; Home in 1950: Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky; Roll: 2425; Sheet Number: 3; Enumeration District: 34-76\n\nAncestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 62308 #86953391 (accessed 27 July 2022)\n\nJames D McConnaughey (20) student in household of John O Baldwin (19) in Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky, USA.
