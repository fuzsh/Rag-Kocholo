        "text": "James âJimâ Donald Hicks, 82, of May, Texas formerly of Onalaska, Texas passed away June 19, 2024 at his home in May, Texas. A Celebration of Life service will be held at the Trickham Union Church, located next to the Trickham Cemetery. Interment will be directly following the service at Trickham Cemetery and a reception will be held in the Trickham community building following the services.\n\nJim was born to Encil and Minnie (Baker) Hicks in St. Clairsville, Ohio. He attended school in Ohio and moved to Texas to work as an Engineer. Jim was an amazing father, husband, friend and grandfather. To know Jim was to love Jim. Jim never met a stranger. He was as adventurous as it came. He traveled hundreds of miles across the United States with his wife Ruth on the back of his bike or her own bike right beside him. Jim loved history, so every trip he took if it was on his bike or in a car he was stopping at every historical marker or town. Jim could do anything. So, this set the bar high for whoever his daughters were to marry. It made it impossible to have the kind of knowledge he did. Believe me Dad could fix anything and the girls would let you know it. His love for woodworking was extraordinary. If you could tell him, you wanted something built, he could do it. He built toys, cradles, rocking horses, pens and so much more. But his love for Folk music got him started in building musical instruments such as the Dulcimer. Once he perfected that he went on to build a Fiddle. The detail of his work far exceeded most woodworking you would see. Jim loved the water just as much, so he decided to buy a sailboat. What an adventure Ruth and him got to share together. They spent countless hours, days and nights on that sailboat. Everything he did or touched became perfection. Jim loved a beautiful yard with mowed grass and flowers. So, it was no surprise that he tried to mow grass up to the very last day he spent on earth. Even though we could help, that was his job and only he could do it right. No job for him was ever too big or too small. He enjoyed doing it all. He had so much talent. His love for his grandchildren was priceless. It didnât matter if he drove five hours for a one-hour program, if the grandchildren were involved, he was going. He came as fast as he could too. He spent many hours at horse arenas watching barrel racing, always on the sidelines of volleyball, basketball, or baseball or any other function all because he wouldnât miss that moment to spend with the grandchildren. This warmed his heart. Each one had a special place in his heart. According to him his grandchildren could do no wrong. If you ask any of them, they would all say they were his favorite. Thatâs because they all were. Jim was the best Pap Pap those children could have. No matter what Jim faced in life he stayed humble and continued to show love and kindness to everyone. By trade Jim was a Mechanical Engineer but as you can see, he was a man of many talents. Jim will be missed by many and hard to replace because he was one of a kind. Jim was brave to the end of his battle, and still worried everyday if would be okay without him. I am not sure if we will be okay, but one thing we do know is he loved us unconditionally, he was brave, he was strong, he was perfect for us.\n\nJim is survived by his loving wife, Ruth Hicks of May, Texas; daughters, Cyndi Amendt of May, Texas & Diana Hilderbrand of Lafferty, OH; sons, Keith Henke and Michelle of George West, Texas, David Joyce and Annette of Katy, Tx, Darren Joyce and Cherie of Bay Cliff, TX & Danny Joyce and Karen of Bayard, N.M.; 14 grandchildren, 14 great grandchildren, 1 great-great grandchild; and many nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.\n\nJim was preceded in death by his daughters, Kim Iafrate, Debbie Brockel, Cheryl Bates; son, Brian Hicks; parents, Encil & Minnie; 4 brothers & 1 sister."
