Biographical Notes

James Giles was born in Highworth, Wiltshire in 1829 to John Giles, probably a woodworker, and Esther Avenell who had married three years earlier in Highworth on 21 May 1826.

By 1851, James was living in Lady Wood Lane, Edgbaston, Warwickshire, England lodging with the Collins family and working as a clerk.

In 1861 he married Ann Cubley from Birmingham. The ceremony took place in Walsall, Stafford, and they started married life at 216 Hatherton Street, Walsall; later moving to Essex Terrace Cottage in the town.

Whilst in Walsall, James and his wife had 6 children and there is a record of a further daughter being born in Sheffield in 1880, three years after James had died. The family legend says that she was a gypsy’s child as she was very dark.

Their seven children were James Thomas (b. 1862, Lydia Dorothy (b. 1864), William A. (b. 1866), Catherine A. (b. 1868), Jemmima (b. 1870), Harry (b. 1876) and Edith (b. 1880).

According to Jones Directory of the Iron District of South Staffordshire and Kelly’s Directory of Staffordshire), James had a studio at 140 Bridgeman Street, Walsall from 1864 and moved to Bradford Street, Walsall in 1865. His last trade directory advertisement is dated 1876 and James died the following year on the 1 March 1877 at the age of 48.
