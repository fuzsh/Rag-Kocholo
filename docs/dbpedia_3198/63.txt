He was previously Professor of Media at Curtin University of Technology in Western Australia, and before that, in England, he had worked in the School of Education at the Open University and helped to establish Media Studies at the University of Sussex. In the late 1970s, James Donald was editor of the journal Screen Education, and went on to found New Formations. He has written books about modern education and the modern city, and co-authored the Penguin Atlas of Media and Information. He has edited over a dozen books on cinema, the media, education, and cultural and social theory, as well as contributing to a variety of books and journals. His current research includes a project, supported in its early stages by an ARC Discovery Grant, on the significance of two Black American stars, Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson, in the transnational culture of modernism between the World Wars, and a comparative and historical account of universities and the media as modern institutions. He is still trying to work out what sort of thing cinema is going to be in the twenty-first century.
