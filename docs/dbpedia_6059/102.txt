"She is a wonderful character: free-spirited, passionate, impulsive, fiery, frustrating, selfish and a brilliant human-being," she told the BBC, adding: "I was attracted to the story as the two women are so linked but so different. The subject matter feels completely relevant, it's potent, nuancedâ€¦"

Lily continued: "The choices she makes at times feel harsh and quite brutal but I instinctively feel I understand her and love her deeply. I recognise a lot of myself in her."

The actress, who will appear in the new three-part series alongside Emily Beecham, Dominic West and Andrew Scott, even revealed she found her own diaries from her younger days to help prepare her for the part.

"I was texting Emily Mortimer months ago as I had found my old diaries. Some of the things I wrote were so Linda. I wish I was as brave and courageous as her, she lives for herself. I relate to her passion and her open heart. I think people want to be more like Linda."
