        "text": "Lily James has been acting for quite some time with roles in projects like Mamma Mia 2, Baby Driver, and Cinderella. James' new project, Pam & Tommy, hits the small screen on Friday, February 2nd and promises to tell the tale of rocker Tommy Lee (played by Sebastian Stan) and Pamela Anderson's (played by Lily James) roller coaster relationship — including their stolen sex-tape scandal.\n\nWhile talking with Net-A-Porter, James revealed that she did a lot of research on Anderson, including reading Anderson's writing and interviews.\n\n\"My sole intention was to take care of the story and to play Pamela authentically,\" James said.\n\nBefore you dive in to the new drama series, here are some fun facts about James.\n\nJames isn't her actual last name\n\nBorn Lily Chloe Ninette Thompson, the star wanted to pay respects to her late father, Jamie Thompson, by adopting Lily James as her stage name. Her father passed away in 2008 from cancer.\n\nShe is a big fan of the 90's girl group, the Spice Girls\n\nOn numerous occasions, Lily James has talked about her love for the Spice Girls. In a 2019 interview with James Corden, she talked about seeing the spice girls in concert when the girl group reunited and her fangirl moment meeting \"Baby Spice,\" Emma Bunton.\n\n\"I was fighting the tears,\" James explained, \"It was one of the best days of my life.\"\n\nMeryl Streep and James are distant relatives\n\nThe Mamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again co-stars are distant cousins. In an article written by Mirror, the two actresses are ninth cousins, three times removed. Streep spoke on the revelation, calling it \"absolutely wonderful.\"\n\nJames' grandmother is actress as well\n\nTalent runs in the family. James isn't the first actor from her family — her grandmother is Alien and Superman III actress Helen Horton. She was in the acting industry from 1953 to 1990 and died in 2009.\n\nHer rise to fame began when she was cast as Disney's new Cinderella\n\nJames had become more well-known in the industry when she was casted as lead Cinderella in Disney's 2015 adaptation of the classic film. She starred alongside Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nAfter her role in the live action remake, it led the path for James to appear in many other films down the road.\n\nIn an interview with ABC's Nightline, James revealed that she actually didn't audition as the lead at first.\n\n\"I actually originally went in for one of the sisters, to play Anastasia,\" she admitted. With help from her recently dyed blonde hair, the casting director asked her to read parts for Ella and the rest is history."
