Broadway star Fitzroy Wynn (Christopher Plummer) is thrilled when his wife Lily (Dame Maggie Smith) writes a new script with a brilliant lead role. While egocentric Fitz thinks himself perfect for the role, Lily dashes his hopes when she admits she wants to find someone different for the part. Fitz refuses to give up his pursuit. Enlisting the reluctant help of his agent, Fitz poses as Roberto Terranova, a young Italian actor and the exact model of what Lily wants for the role. But trouble arises when Lily appears to be falling for the charming Italian, and Fitz is left to wonder just how serious she was about finding someone different.",

        "text": "First off, let me say that I believe Dame Maggie Smith to be the classiest actress in cinema. Her eyes are mesmerizing - she can look so coy and yet still patronize with a little curl in her grin. She certainly does not disappoint in this tale of comedic deception and romance.\n\nThe set-up is cute...Christopher Plummer plays Fitz Wynn, a truly talented but overly-satisfied stage actor who wants to star in a new movie written by his wife, Lily (Smith). Lily doesn't feel her Fitz is right for the part, and explains to him why and what she's looking for in the role. Fitz proceeds to orchestrate his own transformation (with the reluctant assistance of his agent) into Roberto Terranova, a blonde Italian who seems to be exactly what Lily wants. His deception seems successful, but does Lily want Roberto for more than just her movie?\n\nIt is at this point where the movie struggles - the initial delicious tension goes bland with redundancies; and although some wit is regained at the climax, the movie struggles through some sort of resolution, leaving us wondering just when the credits will roll?\n\nPlummer does fine - his 'tantrums' seem contrived, but I don't really blame him. Smith is as witty as a lady can be with this material, which seems so dated now - especially the music (groan). As for the rest of the cast, Elke Sommer is totally wasted, and the remainders are unrecognizable and unimpressive.\n\nIn summary, the sole reason to watch *Lily in Love* is to watch Maggie Smith. She is graceful, she is radiant, and she is the perpetual professional. Rating 5/10 for the film :: 10/10 for Dame Maggie Smith"
