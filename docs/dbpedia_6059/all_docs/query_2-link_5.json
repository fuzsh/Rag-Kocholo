        "text": "Lily Martha Hale (née Calloway) is the third oldest daughter of Greg and Samantha Calloway, Greg being the CEO of popular soft drink brand Fizz. She is the wife to Loren Hale, their ship name is Lilo. Shy and sometimes awkward; she's a Calloway sister who's addicted to sex in the Addicted Series.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nLily has green eyes and straight shoulder-length brown hair, that is usually greasy from forgetting to wash it (this gets better throughout the series). Lily blushes, like intense tomato-red. It is described as rash-like patches that dot her neck and arms as if she's allergic to embarrassment. Lily is flat-chested and gaunt. Lily is also described as looking a bit skeletal. She has fair skin. She crinkles her nose when she's thinking hard or when she's confused.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nLily is described as a wild card by the people around her. She's the most introverted and shy out of the core six and struggles with anxiety. Lily has low self esteem, is hyper sensitive and can be selfish at times but it is never on purpose. Through out the books Lily tries to overcome her addiction to sex and succeeds. Generally, Lily is very kind, loving and emotionally intelligent. Lily is slightly aloof but still approachable.\n\nEarly History[]\n\nIn kindergarten, Lily was too shy to say the Pledge of Allegiance. Samantha used to use a wooden spoon on her kids.\n\nWhen Lily was really little, Samantha used to put her in classes like; Art, Singing, Piano. She lasted about a day in each. Lily never picked up talents like Poppy and Rose. When the school sent her to remedial math in third grade, that was the last time Samantha paid attention to her.\n\nIn fifth grade, Lily played a teapot in an Alice in Wonderland play. She only had two lines but she still managed to forget them.\n\nSince she was seven, Lily has been afraid of heights ever since Harry Chesswater pushed her off a jungle gym. Lily broke her arm. Lo put a firecracker in his backpack in retaliation. Lily played a tree in the Wizard of Oz production. She accidentally threw an apple at Dorothy and gave her a black eye.\n\nWhen they were seven, Lily and Lo snuck into the indoor pool in Jonathan's house. They'd dare each other to jump in. Lo always ended up pushing Lily in, and she'd scream. One night they woke up the staff, and the butler ended up telling Jonathan that they'd been swimming. After Jonathan found out, he locked the pool.\n\nIn fourth grade Lily had a chicken bone thrown at her.\n\nLily stayed the night at Lo's a lot growing up. In middle school, it was about four days a week, and then she kept coming over more and more until high school, when she slept over almost every night. Every day, Lily asked her mother if she could spend the night at Lo's house. The answer was always the same. Then when Lily was fourteen or fifteen, Samantha finally told them both to just stop asking, that she'd approve no matter what. That night Lily cried into Lo's pillow. She never told Lo straight out, but Lo knew the only reason Lily even asked Samantha in the first place was because she wanted to hear the word no. A single sign that her mother cared about her the same way that she did Poppy, Rose, and Daisy. That she wasn't undeserving of her mother's time and attention.\n\nLily started touching herself when she was nine, but started doing it to porn when she was eleven after she found one of Lo's porn magazines.\n\nIn their senior year of high school, Lily and Lo had started their fake relationship and Aaron realized that there was a way to reach Lo without him running away. Aaron started following Lily to class, then a week later, he blocked her against a wall, ever so casually, with his lacrosse player friends in tow. One day while Lily was driving home, Aaron tailed her with his lacrosse buddies. After Lily confessed to Lo everything Aaron had been doing to her, Lo called Aaron and threatened his college career if he didn't stop harassing Lily. With the Hale name, Lo had plenty of contacts and one phone call from him or his father, and Aaron's collegiate career would be over. Aaron called his bluff, so Lo called the college. Aaron was reduced to his safety school, losing out the lacrosse stardom.\n\nIn English class in sixth grade, a few boys scooted their desks close to Lily's and whipped out soda cans. Diet Fizz. Fizz Lite. Fizz Red. Just plain Fizz. They took swigs and then left the cans scattered on her desk. The last boy opened his can of Cherry Fizz and smiled and said \"Here, I popped your cherry.\"\n\nWhen she was younger, her downward spiral began with small compulsions, like mustering the nerve to click into an X-rated site. Gradually, she started moving forward. Porn sites became dirty chat pages, five minutes became an hour, and she obsessed about her next opportunity to surf the internet.\n\nLily and Lo's fathers, Greg Calloway and Jonathan Hale, took them both to informal golf games. While their fathers discussed stock, ventures and product placements for their respective trademarked brands, Lily and Lo would play Star Wars with their golf clubs. One time, Lily accidentally bruised Lo's ribs after swinging her light saber too haphazardly and too hard.\n\nBefore she made sense of her compulsions, Lily would spend hours lying in bed, emotionally drained from her ping-ponging thoughts. One minute, she vehemently defended her actions inside her mind. It was her body. Sex made her feel better and stopping would cause more problems than continuing down the destructive path. The next minute, she cried for hours and convinced herself to quit. She told herself she didn't have a problem. She was just a whore looking for a way to justify her constant sexual thoughts. Sometimes she tried to stop. She trashed her porn and refused her body the luxury of climaxing. But she couldn't stomach the withdrawals, and those fruitless goals quickly ended.\n\nFizzle has company tours all the time, the ones where they show the history of the soda and then let you try all the imported flavors. When Lo and Lily were twelve, Greg left them in the museum area. Lily had an idea and said that the real factory was a street over. Lily told them her last name and said her father wanted her to take a mini-tour. When they went in, they darted in another direction. Lo took out his flask and dumped it into the syrup.\n\nLily lost her virginity when she was thirteen to a fifteen year old boy. The boy was the son of her mother's friend. She was at his house for his father's surprise birthday party.\n\nLong before they started fake dating, Lily helped hide Lo's addiction on every occasion. She would smuggle him into one of her guest bedrooms at Villanova until he slept off a hangover. She would kick bottles of Jim Beam and Marker's Mark underneath his bed before the maid lurked around and Jonathan inspected the stateliness of Lo's things. Lo would lie to Lily's sisters about her weekend plans. Most were spent at parties hosted by public school kids.\n\nLily regrets most of her actions, and high school was full of wrong choices and bad decisions. Sleeping with someone who tormented Lo was one of them. She didn't care when it happened, but afterwards, she couldn't have been more ashamed.\n\nIn ninth grade, Lily was in a cotillion. She had to dance with Jeremy Adams all night and he was a whole head shorter than her. Since Lo chose to go to the ball with Juliana Bancroft. Juliana filled Lily's locker with condoms, because Lily unknowingly slept with her boyfriend. The condoms had glittery stickers all over them. Juliana used to carry around a binder with a rainbow unicorn.\n\nIn high school, Lily had sex maybe once a month. Most hours were filled with porn and her imagination. In her senior year of high school, Lily started fake-dating her best friend Loren Hale. When Lily and Lo decided on the same college, their parents proposed that they live together.\n\nWhen Lily was sixteen, Trent Smith sent a package of a dead rabbit to her. The next day Lo doused his door with pig's blood.\n\nWhen they were eighteen, Lo asked Lily what it felt like to go without climaxing for a day, and she told him it felt like someone is burying her head under the sand and pulling her limbs so tight they become taut rubber bands, waiting to be snapped and released. The cravings feel like drowning and being lit on fire at the same time.\n\nWhen they first arrived at Penn, Lily and Lo went to a freshman pyjama party. Lily found lo blacked out on the floor in the morning. Lo's cheek was covered in vomit and Lily thought that he had succumbed to his greatest flaw. All Lo can remember is waking up in the hospital. He had gotten his stomach pumped. After that they made a deal. They said that if it was going to work—Lo and Lily doing whatever they wanted—then Lo would have to know his limits and never exceed them.\n\nOn new years eve 2010, Lily wore a sparkly silver dress and decided to be panty-less the entire night. She thought it would be easier for a quickie in the bathroom with Mr. Random. In retrospect, it was a bad idea. She danced all night at a fancy club and was too inebriated to realize that she flashed the crowds with every hop. Lo ended up dancing beside her, keeping a hand on her shoulder to ease her Kangaroo springs. He even tugged down the back of her dress for her. Near midnight, Lo offered to give Lily his underwear, which she declined.\n\nThe night Lily arrived at fraternity row, Alpha Omega Zeta was hosting a theme party. Unaware, Lily entered the building to be met with buckets of water and guys chanting for her to rip off her bra.\n\nLily went to the pregnancy center. She visits the health clinic to check for STDs every couple days, and she takes pregnancy tests. One afternoon the pink plus sign haunted Lily and the health clinic sent her to the pregnancy center for and ultrasound. It was a false alarm.\n\nVery little excites Lily, and when she finds something that does, she thinks about it constantly. She can barely even last a whole day without being gratified by a set of hands and a male body thrumming against hers.\n\nConnor is Lily's economics tutor. Connor was listed on the economics department website and Lily choose the coolest name. It was between Connor and Henry Everclear.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAddicted Series[]\n\nAddicted to You[]\n\nRicochet[]\n\nAddicted for Now[]\n\nThrive[]\n\nAddicted After All[]\n\nCalloway Sisters Series[]\n\nKiss the Sky[]\n\nChapter 2\n\nChapter 5\n\nChapter 7\n\nChapters 9-10\n\nChapter 12\n\nChapters 16-18\n\nChapter 22\n\nChapters 24-28\n\nChapters 32-36\n\nChapter 38\n\nChapters 41-42\n\nChapter 44\n\nChapters 46-48\n\nChapter 51\n\nHothouse Flower[]\n\nChapter 6\n\nChapter 11\n\nChapter 14\n\nChapter 30\n\nChapters 37-39\n\nChapters 48-52\n\nChapter 54\n\nChapters 57-58\n\nChapter 60\n\nChapter 63\n\nChapters 67-68\n\nChapter 70\n\nFuel the Fire[]\n\nChapters 3-4\n\nChapters 6-8\n\nChapters 18-21\n\nChapter 23\n\nChapter 28\n\nChapters 30-31\n\nChapter 34\n\nChapters 36-38\n\nChapter 43\n\nChapters 46-47\n\nChapters 49-50\n\nChapters 53-54\n\nChapters 58-59\n\nChapter 62\n\nEpilogue\n\nLong Way Down[]\n\nChapter 5\n\nChapter 7\n\nChapter 9\n\nChapters 11-16\n\nChapters 19-23\n\nChapter 25\n\nChapter 28\n\nChapter 30\n\nChapters 34-35\n\nChapters 40-44\n\nChapters 48-49\n\nChapter 52\n\nChapters 56-60\n\nChapters 65-67\n\nEpilogue\n\nSome Kind of Perfect[]\n\nBad Reputation Duet[]\n\nWhatever It Takes[]\n\nWherever You Are[]\n\nLike Us Series[]\n\nDamaged Like Us[]\n\nChapter 27\n\nChapters 31–32\n\nChapters 40–41\n\nLovers Like Us[]\n\nChapter 5\n\nChapter 43\n\nAlphas Like Us[]\n\nChapter 26\n\nChapter 37\n\nTangled Like Us[]\n\nChapter 41\n\nSinful Like Us[]\n\nChapter 41\n\nHeadstrong Like Us[]\n\nChapter 2\n\nChapter 10\n\nChapter 16\n\nChapter 28\n\nChapter 34-35\n\nChapter 42\n\nChapter 44\n\nCharming Like Us[]\n\nWild Like Us[]\n\nFearless Like Us[]\n\nInfamous Like Us[]\n\nMisfits Like Us[]\n\nUnlucky Like Us[]\n\nChapter 1-4\n\nChapter 18-20\n\nChapter 40\n\nNobody Like Us[]\n\nBodyguard[]\n\nGarth: 2012 to August 2034\n\nFarrow Keene: September 2034 to August 2037\n\nLuis Monroe: August 2037 to present\n\nBirthday[]\n\nIn Addicted to You, Lily is 20.\n\nIn Thrive, Lily is 21-23.\n\nIn Thrive, Lily turns 21.
