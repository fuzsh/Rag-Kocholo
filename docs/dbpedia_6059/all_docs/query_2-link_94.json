        "text": "Sure, 2020 wasn't one for the books for most people. But it ended up being Lily Collins' year.\n\nShe spent most of it in sweatpants, like so many others, but that just meant she was extremely comfortable as the results of her very busy 2019 unfolded. Then it was on to 2021, to collect the spoils, which early on included her first-ever Golden Globe nomination for her star turn in one of the most debated shows of quarantine, Emily in Paris.\n\nAnd now, Collins as a producer shares in the Best Comedy Series Emmy nomination for the City of Light-set escapist fare, in which the Chicago-born title character's adorably American ways butt up against the savoir faire of the French at a Parisian fashion company. In fact, she was busy filming season two with co-star Ashley Park when they got the good news.\n\n\"[We] were together on set in my apartment when she read her phone and said, 'Were we? Are we? We were nominated for the Emmys!'\" Collins recalled to W magazine. \"We didn't know they were being announced, and then we just started screaming and had to yell, 'Cut!'\"\n\nBorn in Surrey, England, and raised in Los Angeles by mom Jill Tavelman after her parents split up when she was 5, the raven-haired beauty did seem to have all the elements in place to glide through life like a certain social media maven who takes the City of Light by storm.\n\nShe spent much of her formative life acting, modeling, writing (she made her on-camera debut in a BBC series when she was 2 and had an Elle Girl column at 15) and wielding a microphone—not as a singer, like her famous father Phil Collins, but as an on-the-ground host for Nickelodeon's Kids Pick the President election series in 2008. She dropped out of USC, where she went to study broadcast journalism, but won the Young Hollywood Award for Newest Red Carpet Correspondent instead.\n\nThough she has said that she never spent very much time in Paris before moving there for a few months to shoot the first season of her Netflix series, she had made some memories in the French capital, such as when she made her society debut at the Crillon Ball (now the Le Bal des Débutantes) in 2007. Phil shared a photo of their father-daughter dance at the event in his 2016 memoir, Not Dead Yet, a tradition that's also been experienced over the years by Bruce Willis, Forest Whitaker and Sylvester Stallone with their respective debutante daughters.\n\nAfter just one two-episode guest spot on the CW's 90210, Lily got her big-screen break playing Sandra Bullock's daughter in 2009's The Blind Side. She went on to star in films such as Mirror Mirror opposite Julia Roberts, Rules Don't Apply co-starring and directed by Warren Beatty (for which she earned her first Golden Globe nomination), To the Bone with Keanu Reeves and the Bong Joon Ho-directed Okja.\n\nAll the while, she also became known, if not more so in some circles, for her smart style and cool-best-friend-vibe Instagram account.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she told The Guardian in 2012. \"I look at what I've done and I go: 'What? Really?' It still feels so abnormal not to have had to do those particular sorts of projects [kid-and-teen fare, that is] to get here.\"\n\nBut the outward evidence of a charmed life didn't always reflect the vulnerable person at the heart of it, so she decided to really introduce herself to the world with her 2017 essay collection Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me.\n\nHaving grown up not exactly famous but very much spotlight-adjacent and the daughter of a thrice-divorced father, Collins knew at an early age that there would be certain things that she wouldn't want to share—such as intimate details of her dating life.\n\n\"I entered into this business knowing your private life can't always remain private,\" she explained to Glamour UK in 2013, when she was rumored to be dating her Abduction co-star Taylor Lautner. \"I don't feel the need to profess anything publicly or confirm something that in a normal situation you wouldn't have to speak out about. If I'm out and photographed with someone, then that is what it is. We took that chance and, whatever... it is what it is.\"\n\nShe continued, \"That's always my natural feeling. My family went through a lot of very public situations and I saw that side of it from a young age. My mum raised me to be normal, and I wanted to grow up and find out who I was and who I wanted to spend time with before anyone else did.\"\n\nHaving spent her youth primarily with her mother and eventually shedding her British accent, it took some years to develop the sort of bond with her dad that she craved as a child. But they have a solid relationship now, Lily writing to the Grammy winner on his 70th birthday Jan. 30, \"Words aren't enough to express how much love and pride I have for you. After 7 decades on this planet, countless trips around the world, 5 kids, endless memories and a lifetime of stories... you're not done yet! You mean so much to me and I can't wait for all the adventures and years to come. I love you so much, to the moon and back again...\"\n\nIn 2012, she told The Guardian she had fond memories of summers with her dad in Switzerland, where he moved after the divorce, and Christmases at the family farmhouse in West Sussex. \"It's the best place to be for the holidays—all cold and wintry. Love the food, love the tea. I still feel very European,\" she said. And, despite her parents' rough split, \"I've only ever known growing up across different countries—to me it's just fun.\"\n\nPressed on what sort of relationship she really had with her father growing up, she said, \"I know the truth and I know how it was for me, and I know how much I love my family—and that's all that really matters.\"\n\nPerhaps the publication of Phil's own warts-and-all memoir in 2016 partially inspired her decision to dig deeper and share that truth.\n\nWriting about the end of his marriage to Jill, Collins' mom, Phil—who admitted to cheating but firmly denied the prevalent rumor that he dumped his second wife via fax—reflects on feeling \"so sad for Lily, who is trying to make sense of all this mess her dad has made. I will always be sorry for that. I know that confessing to these feelings will unmoor Jill and Lily's lives, so I make the difficult decision to take the coward's way out: I say nothing.\"\n\nWhich is why Jill is the \"total bad ass rock star\" in Collins' actual book. She traveled the world with her mom, and credits her in Unfiltered for not only always being there for her, but for exposing her and her friends \"to people from all walks of life,\" encouraging them \"to step outside our comfort zones and experience the unknown.\"\n\nThey were so close, she explained, that she felt both inordinately excited to venture out on her own and a little guilty for leaving her mom (though when Lily first moved out she only went as far as down the street). But at the end of every day, Collins wrote, \"She's my best friend, inspiration, role model, confidante, and partner in crime.\"\n\nMeanwhile, her dad \"may have still been alive, but most of the time it felt as if he were completely gone,\" she wrote. Lily recalls being constantly worried about living up to his expectations, craving approval that he wasn't there to give. Not being able to tell him how she felt only made her angrier, and she says it took about a decade before she drummed up the courage to speak her mind.\n\nNot that having one huge talk solved everything (dads aren't always the best listeners, she notes), and Collins wrote in a letter to her father included in the essay about him in the book, \"I forgive the mistakes you made. And although it may seem like it's too late, it's not. There's still so much time to move forward. And I want to. I'm inviting you to join me.\"\n\nSo, the situation was far more complicated than Collins had been ready to share five years beforehand.\n\nNo wonder she didn't find the accolades for Mank—in which she played Rita Alexander, the stenographer tasked with keeping Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) sober enough to hammer out the screenplay for Citizen Kane while laid up with a broken leg—or the prospect of all the Oscar nominations the David Fincher-directed film was a shoo-in for particularly nerve-racking.\n\n\"I'm just really proud to be part of such an amazing ensemble,\" Collins said on Daily Pop. \"And to be a part of something that people are responding to like this is really special.\"\n\nMank ended up with 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and won two, but Collins skipped the pandemic-delayed ceremony in April.\n\nAfter shooting both Mank and Emily in Paris in 2019, she wasn't entirely averse to slowing down in 2020—though she hadn't planned on quite so much free time. For instance, she was excited to inject more of Emily's joie de vivre into her own wardrobe and there promised to be a long list of appearances for both projects, not to mention award season.\n\n\"Aaaaand then we went into lockdown,\" she quipped on Daily Pop.\n\nAt least that allowed for some sweet alone time with her fiancé, whom she met in 2019 when she was cast in his upcoming film, Gilded Rage—and then promptly fell in love with him.\n\n\"It was kind of one of those situations where I knew the second that I met him that I wanted to be his wife one day, and so it was just a matter of when really,\" she recalled on Live With Kelly and Ryan.\n\nDuring quarantine McDowell taught her how to surf, which, she told InStyle, served as \"a fun way to get over a fear of failing publicly.\" She read up on meditation (being able to savor the moment hasn't always come easy to her) and listened to Unlocking Us With Brené Brown, growing ever more in touch with herself always near the top of her to-do list. And it came in handy to have a boyfriend who knew his way around a camera so, when W came calling for a story, he could photograph her himself.\n\n\"I know it's super strange, but I haven't been stationary in one place for this long in—I can't remember how long,\" Collins told the magazine.\n\nBut though all was obviously going well 18 months into their relationship, she was still completely surprised when McDowell popped the question while they were on an RV trip through New Mexico and Arizona with their dog Redford. He had apprised their families of his plan ahead of time, but managed to keep her entirely in the dark—even when he was planting a camera to capture the moment for posterity.\n\n\"We all have our insecurities,\" she told Kelly Clarkson. \"For me, body image was a really big thing. I've been very vocal and open about my experiences with eating disorders and, just, now my fiancé is so supportive, and it's about finding new ways to feel centered and not reverting back to old ways...We all just need to say, we all go through these things and we're not crazy, and no one of us is alone. I think we all have those little things.\"\n\nAnd when Drew Barrymore asked Lily how she had come to be \"this person who exudes and conveys kindness and goodness,\" she again credited her mom for instilling her with her moral compass from the beginning. \"I don't know,\" the actress said, \"I'm just so grateful for every opportunity that I get and I'm just an innately happy, optimistic person, I guess.\"\n\nThey both agreed that being born into that world came with certain advantages, but it also could mean that you feel the urge to prove yourself that much faster.\n\n\"It gave me such a drive to want to feel like I deserved to be where I am,\" Lily said. \"For a certain amount of time, a last name could be something that's interesting but, at the end of the day, you've got to bring something to the table. And yeah, I maybe had to grow up a little bit quicker, but I was also exposed to the pros and cons at an early age and I still chose it for me.\"\n\nThe people have spoken—23.7 million on Instagram and counting, 676 million minutes of Emily in Paris binged in its first week—and they've chosen her right back."
