Those of you who are not actors but have a voice, have a story that needs to be heard.\" –Lily Gladstone. As we move closer to the Academy Awards (they're on March 10th), the next important set of winners have been revealed. The 30th annual SAG Awards (Screen Actors Guild Awards) honor the finest performances from 2023, as chosen by other actors which means this is one of the most definitive lists of the very best. All of the nominees, too. Actors know their profession better than anyone and are very particular about good performances. What did they decide should win this year? Big news - Oppenheimer won the most awards, taking home Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Ensemble. This means it is probably going to win Best Picture and tons of Oscars next (same as Everything Everywhere All at Once last year). Lily Gladstone also won, over Emma Stone for Best Female Actor, along with the wonderful Da'Vine Joy Randolph from The Holdovers.
