        "text": "On March 14th, 1972, the film The Godfather premiered for the first time in New York City. Widely regarded as one of the best films in history with an outstanding cast, I still found myself skeptical of this title before I ever sat down to watch the film. However, now on March 14th, 2024, I can confidently say I would rank The Godfather equally as high as everyone else seems to. I found myself captivated by the plot, action, score, cinematography, and characters in a way I had never before in a film. A year ago, me saying that would have meant absolutely nothing, but I have discovered so many different films in the past twelve months that I hold each film I watch to very high standards and expectations. But, the thing about films is that they are subjective and can be interpreted differently depending upon the viewer.\n\nI absolutely love watching, talking, and writing about films and the art of filmmaking in general. It is truly one of the most interesting concepts and so uniquely personalized for every single individual. There is a film for everyone out there somewhere.\n\nWhen I say I have “experienced” film this past year, what I mean is that I have discovered so many different genres, directors, actors, and films that I had never before. I don’t know what exactly drew me into watching a film a night every single night during the end of my junior year, but I think a big part of it was having a sort of escape for two hours and experiencing different ideas, people, and places through a screen. I also believe that film itself is an experience and films have the power to produce powerful emotions and actions.\n\nThe first film I watched that I remember as completely blowing me away was The Dark Knight. I watched it one night last March and stayed up until 1:00 am on a random weeknight because I could not find a stopping point or wait until the next day to find out how it ended. I had never watched any superhero movies or even the first movie from the TDK Trilogy, but it did not matter, I was hooked. I know “superhero movies” are deemed as controversial for being legitimate films, but I have them to thank because, without TDK, I would not have seen the number of films I have today.\n\nLooking back, this time last year was stressful for me with school, college prep, SATs, etc, and I think watching different films served as a distraction from everything I had on my plate at the time.\n\nI then watched the third movie in the trilogy The Dark Knight Rises, and then the first movie Batman Begins the following night. Those movies were what cemented Christopher Nolan as one of my favorite directors. It speaks volumes to his skills that I could turn on one of his movies with absolutely no prior knowledge of the film or film trilogy, yet still be so captivated by the film. Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker was incredible and earned him an Academy Award. He completed an intense round of method acting for the role and I don’t think anybody could have played the Joker better than him.\n\nAfterward, I watched more of Nolan’s films such as Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk, Tenet, and Memento, and was beyond excited to see Oppenheimer later that summer (I ended up seeing it twice in the theater). He is truly one of the most talented filmmakers of all time and I was so happy to see him finally receive his flowers from the Academy by winning Best Director at the Oscars a few nights ago (and of course seeing Oppenheimer win Best Picture and Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy receive Academy Awards as well).\n\nI branched out a lot more during the summer and explored different genres, and film classics, and discovered new actors whose movies I would binge. Now, I would consider myself to be fairly well-rounded in film watching and I want to share some of my film favorites to look back on.\n\nMy absolute favorite actor of all time is Robert De Niro. I always knew he was a big deal in Hollywood but up until several months ago, I hadn’t seen any of his work. Some of my very favorite films include him and also my favorite director, Martin Scorsese. This pair together has produced three of my favorite films of all time. Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, and Raging Bull. Each is considered a film classic, with De Niro cast as the main character, where he takes on three completely different personas, yet all tell an unforgettable story.\n\nIronically, one of my favorite recently released films, Joker, was inspired by De Niro’s characters in Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (plus De Niro was in Joker), which I did not realize initially, but now makes sense as to why I liked it so much.\n\nThe components of films I gravitate to the most are the cinematography and the film score, and all three of these films have a unique aspect of each component. Taxi Driver in particular is my favorite because I love the cinematography (done by Michael Chapman, who also did the cinematography for Raging Bull) and the way New York City is portrayed to show the grimy and ugly parts of it, which is uncommon. The camera panning and slow-motion shots are also interesting and add depth to the plot of the film. The film score composed by Bernard Herrman (he finished the score hours before he died) is a blend of melancholic jazz music that has quickly become my favorite score to date.\n\nListen to the Taxi Driver film score here!\n\nI found Raging Bull intriguing initially because of Scorsese’s bold choice to capture the film completely in black and white. This was a relatively risky choice for the 1980’s, but it paid off well and won De Niro his second Oscar.\n\nvideo credit to @jordie919xp on Tik Tok - the best film editor!\n\nSomething I admire so deeply about Scorsese is that he has such a distinct, personal vision for all of his films and his passion for cinema is so clear in all of his films. He does not shy away from showing the ugliness in people and society, which is something I find fascinating. Similarly with De Niro, his passion for his craft is present in each of his films and he completely indulges his talents in each character he plays, whether that be learning Sicilian, getting semi-permanent tattoos for a role, or shedding half his body weight, he was beyond dedicated to his work as an actor.\n\nSome of My Film Favorites\n\nActors\n\nChristian Bale\n\nRyan Gosling\n\nJake Gyllenhaal\n\nHeath Ledger\n\nPaul Mescal\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nAl Pacino\n\nJoe Pesci\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nActresses\n\nEmily Blunt\n\nJodie Foster\n\nJennifer Garner\n\nLucy Liu\n\nSarah Jessica Parker\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nJulia Roberts\n\nWinona Ryder\n\nDirectors (in order)\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola\n\nQuentin Tarantino\n\nLetterboxd Four Favorite Films:\n\nTaxi Driver, Frankie and Johnny, Raging Bull, Edward Scissorhands\n\nMy Top Film Recommendations (oldest to newest)\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\nThe Godfather (Part 1 and 2)\n\nRocky\n\nScarface\n\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off\n\nDead Poets Society\n\nGoodfellas\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nMy Own Private Idaho\n\nCape Fear\n\nA Bronx Tale\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nCasino\n\nHeat\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nNotting Hill\n\nFight Club\n\nAmerican Psycho\n\n13 Going on 30\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nThe Dark Knight Trilogy\n\n500 Days of Summer\n\nInception\n\nBlack Swan\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\nPrisoners\n\nWhiplash\n\nInterstellar\n\nLa La Land\n\nCall Me By Your Name\n\nI, Tonya\n\nBeautiful Boy\n\nJoker\n\nSoul\n\nAftersun\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nOppenheimer\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nLike I said, the art of film is subjective and I think that is why it is so beautiful, because it is a different experience for each individual person.\n\nI am really happy that I have gotten myself into films of all kinds because it has quickly become my favorite pastime, a comfort, and something to look forward to. There are so many more films, genres, and actors I want to get into and I cannot wait.\n\nWhile I do not see it as a full-time career, I can envision myself writing and directing a film of some kind one day, I already have ideas…\n\n“Now more than ever we need to talk to each other, to listen to each other and understand how we see the world, and cinema is the best medium for doing this.” - Martin Scorsese\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nMarch 21st: Welcoming Spring\n\nMarch 7th: The Impact of Core-ification on Fashion (click to read)\n\n- Lily"
