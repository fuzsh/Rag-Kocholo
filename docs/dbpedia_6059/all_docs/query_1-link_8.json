Later that year, she had her breakthrough starring in the film The Blind Side as Collins Tuohy, the daughter of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock's character).[12] It was a commercial success,[13][14] grossing over $250 million at and emerging as the highest-grossing sports drama of all time.[15]\n\nIn 2011, she played the warrior priest's daughter Lucy in the thriller Priest,[16] opposite Paul Bettany.[17][18] Although it was a critical and commercial failure, she was praised for her performance, and MTV Networks' NextMovie.com named her one of the Breakout Stars to Watch for in 2011.[19] She co-starred in the 2011 action film Abduction with Taylor Lautner.[20]\n\nIn 2012, Collins played Snow White in Mirror Mirror, an adaptation of the fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Robbie Collin from the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote of her: \"She has an adorable, sensational, almost perfect face for cinema; think Audrey Hepburn with the eyebrows of Liam Gallagher. Her smile is the platonic ideal of cheeky.\"[21] Collins made her singing debut in the film, performing an English rewritten cover of \"I Believe (in Love)\". Also in 2012, she portrayed Samantha in Stuck in Love.[22]\n\n2013–2016: Rise to prominence and critical recognition\n\nCollins was initially cast as the lead in the 2013 remake of Evil Dead, but dropped out due to a scheduling issue.[23][24] She played the title role as an earth-visiting alien in M83's music video \"Claudia Lewis\", released in August 2013.

Filming began in February 2018 in Belgium and Northern France.[46] Critics praised Collins's performance as Fantine; Alexandra Pollard of The Independent wrote that \"[Collins] plays the tragic Fantine with steeliness and grace,\" in a \"magnificent\"[47] performance, while another critic stated that \"Lily Collins does not sing her anguished soul out when she is abandoned by her lover. So much so, she impressed me from the get-go with her emotionally rich performance.\"[48]\n\nIn 2019, Collins co-starred with Zac Efron in the drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, directed by Joe Berlinger. She plays Elizabeth Kendall, Ted Bundy's long-time girlfriend, who struggles to accept that her boyfriend is a serial killer.
