        "text": "Lily Jean Olsen (they/them/he) is an actor and artist hailing from Aurora, Ohio. Though they are typically cast as a “troubled” character, they also love to play the comic relief - or sometimes, both! His favorite roles at CCM have been Cassandra in The Trojan Women and a Geezer in Lysistrata, but they have also enjoyed playing characters they have created as part of devised theatre or film projects. Not just interested in being on the stage or in front of the camera, Lily considers themself an amateur but impassioned playwright, screenwriter, and poet. In his free time, Lily can be found playing their guitar, crafting and talking to their three-legged ferret, Todd."
