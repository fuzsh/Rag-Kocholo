        "text": "Diving into the Past: M.F.A. Actor Lily Narbonne's Carol Experience\n\nBy Taylor Steinbeck\n\nBeautiful and haunting, the Ghost of Christmas Past's sweeping entrance across the Geary stage is one of the most memorable moments in A.C.T.'s time-honored classic, A Christmas Carol. The actor who plays the ghost each year is tasked with the unique challenge of being strapped into a swing and hoisted above the audience, all the while maintaining an air of elegance. Third-year Master of Fine Arts Program actor, and self-proclaimed daredevil Lily Narbonne was undaunted by this though. We sat down with Narbonne to chat about defying gravity, embracing the past, and scaring Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Past (Lily Narbonne) in\n\nA.C.T.'s 2017 production of A Christmas Carol.\n\nWhat can you tell me about Christmas Past’s costume?\n\nShe has an ethereal, otherworldly nature about her and the costume reflects that. In Charles Dickens’s original text, he describes her like a light, so in our production, she is supposed to be the embodiment of a flame. What’s amazing about the costume is that it’s one of costume designer Beaver Bauer’s original creations from the first production of Carol. And you can kind of tell because it has some wear to it, but it really works since it’s Past’s costume.\n\nThere’s also a lot of secrets with the costume. Underneath the dress I have these biker shorts and the harness for the swing over them. So that’s kind of brilliant, I didn’t realize that it would be as compact as it is, so it can easily go onto the costume.\n\nHow has the swing been? Are you comfortable in it?\n\nIt’s great! I love heights actually. I like cliff jumping—I haven’t done it in a while, but I used to dive into quarries in Massachusetts. So yeah, being in the swing is exhilarating. It’s like 25 feet or so up in the air. But that’s not the challenge. The hard thing for me is landing the graceful dismount in a way that isn’t noticeable.\n\nWhat has it been like performing on the Geary stage for the first time?\n\nAmazing! I’ve been on the Geary stage a couple of times for readings and classes, but it’s a completely different story when you’ve got awesome actors like Jim Carpenter (Scrooge) to work with and a whole intense costume and a wig.\n\nDraper Keely Weiman and M.F.A. Program actor Lily Narbonne during her costume fitting.\n\nPhoto by Elspeth Sweatman.\n\nThis is the first year that Christmas Past doesn’t sing her song. Is there a reason for that?\n\nEvery ghost used to have a song, but over the years, they’ve gradually been cut, so Christmas Past's was the only one that still had one. For this year’s production, our director Domenique (Lozano) wanted her presence to be more terrifying, and the song just made her seem too friendly and warm, which doesn’t really make sense given that Jacob Marley tells Scrooge, “You will be haunted by three ghosts.” Scrooge can’t be so willing right away to follow her into the past. And that’s just not our world right now. It’s not easy to sway people who are emotionally blocked or are money-hungry. It’s takes work.\n\nWhat has been your favorite part of this experience so far?\n\nIt’s been wonderful to work with the Young Conservatory actors. They have so much energy—it’s contagious. And then the adult company has performed Carol so many times that they do it with such ease. They’re also so open-hearted to us. So it’s been a really amazing transition from my third year of the M.F.A. Program into this professional opportunity.\n\nCome celebrate the holidays with us! A.C.T.'s production of A Christmas Carol runs through December 24 at The Geary Theater.

Publications Staff The opening line of Hamlet ’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy is theater’s most iconic, most referenced quote. What’s less known is the famous speech’s history, with Hamlet ’s earliest publications offering varying versions of its language. Also questioned is its meaning—is Hamlet contemplating suicide or is he weighing the consequences of murder? Though definitive answers are unlikely to arise, the questions “To be or not to be” asks have kept audiences, scholars, and actors engaged for centuries.

The first edition, or First Quarto (Q1), of Hamlet was published in 1603. Because the text is much shorter than later editions and its language is less poetic, it is nicknamed the “Bad Quarto” by scholars. “To be or not to be” in Q1 reads as: To be, or not to be—ay, there’s the point. To die,\n\nThe American Sound: The Evolution of Jazz\n\nBy Cecilia Padilla There is nothing so uniquely American as jazz music. In its simplest form, jazz embodies the essence of the American people: bold and inventive. The improvisation of the jazz ensemble can even be seen as a metaphor for the American democratic ideal: musicians playing solos have the liberty to express themselves as long as they adhere to the overall structure of the tune—individual freedom but with responsibility to the group. The evolution of jazz music also carries with it the social development of our nation from slavery to the swinging songs of World War II. Musically, jazz contributed immensely to the way contemporary musicians approach instrumentation, composition, and vocal arrangements. It is difficult to find a popular tune today that does not derive from such jazz icons as Joe Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Thelonious Monk. Jazz is the great equalizer; for more than a hundred years, it has been the common ground between blacks and whites, me\n\nPurely Pinteresque: The Elements of Pinter's Language\n\nBy Taylor Steinbeck Most artists take years to establish their voice and style. This wasn’t the case for playwright Harold Pinter. His first West End play, The Birthday Party, showcases the elements of Pinter’s aesthetic that would later be evident throughout his 29 plays and 23 screenplays: the rhythm of colloquial language punctuated by pauses and silences, mysterious characters who rarely say what they mean, and the unsettling, yet witty juxtaposition of comedy and terror. Suspenseful and comical, familiar and foreign, disturbing and alluring, The Birthday Party is quintessential Pinter. Graphite drawing of Harold Pinter. By A.C.T. Senior Graphic Designer Brad Amorosino. Pinter is a playwright who uses the back-and-forth of everyday conversation to create conflict and shape power dynamics between characters. “My characters tend to use words not to express what they think or feel,” said Pinter in a 1995 speech, “but to disguise what they think or feel, to mask their actual"
