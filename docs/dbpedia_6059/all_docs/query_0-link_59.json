        "text": "To celebrate the release of Fifteen-Love, the new drama series streaming on Amazon Prime, we had the pleasure of chatting to the cast of the show that’s set to put the tension in tennis.\n\nThe series follows former tennis prodigy, Justine Pearce (Ella Lily-Hyland), who five years after her sudden and early retirement makes explosive allegations against her former coach, Glenn Lapthorn (Aidan Turner). It’s a gripping exploration of trust, power and obsession within the world of elite tennis.\n\nFirst, we chat to Aiden Turner and Ella Lily-Hyland about the lure of the series, the relationship between their characters and the initial starting point for them, the difficulties of bringing sport to the screen, and why the show will be the audience’s latest binge-watch. Next, we chat with Jess Darrow, Harmony Rose Bremner & Tom Varey about their roles in the show, whether they knew how it would all end, why they believe the story is a timely one about power and trust, and much more.\n\nYou can watch the interviews below:"
