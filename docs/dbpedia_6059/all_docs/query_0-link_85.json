        "text": "Lily James seems to be in the middle of a real life drama, as the actress has been rumored to be in a relationship with her married co-star Dominic West, causing her to cancel some of her TV appearances and interviews amid the scandal.\n\nThe star of Mamma Mia! was schedule to promote her new Netflix drama Rebecca alongside Armie Hammer in three high-profile TV shows, NBCâ€™s Today Show, the Graham Norton Show and the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nBoth stars have yet to address the relationship, however photos of a romantic date in Rome have revealed they were together kissing, enjoying lunch, and riding around the city in what seemed to be a true Italian getaway.\n\nThe actress is said to have cancelled her TV commitments because she was expecting to face questions about her relationship with the married actor, especially during her most recent appearance where she was set to be interviewed with Sam Smith, Matthew McConaughey and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe actor is best known for playing Detective McNulty in the HBO series The Wire, however the couple seem to have a long history together, as they first met in a London production in 2011, and recently reuniting during the summer for a classic period film titled The Pursuit of Love."
