Born in Surrey, England to drummer and pop singer Phil Collins and his second wife, Jill Tavelman, when her parents divorced, she relocated with her mother to Los Angeles as a child. She began her career as a toddler, appearing in the British series \"Growing Pains\" (BBC1, 1992-93). While a teenager, she began modeling and writing pieces for magazines like Elle Girl and Teen Vogue. She began acting with a role on the television show \"90210\" (Fox, 2008-13). Her film career started by playing Sandra Bullock's daughter in the football-themed film \"The Blind Side\" (2009). She then played the endangered niece of Paul Bettany's vampire hunting cleric in \"Priest\" (2011). She stepped into a starring role when she played Snow White opposite Julia Roberts in the fantasy adventure \"Mirror, Mirror\" (2012). Collins then truly took center stage in \"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones\" (2013), playing the heroine of Cassandra Clare's popular book series.
