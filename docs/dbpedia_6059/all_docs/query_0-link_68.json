That is what made her fall in love with me is that I was very big and also very small in some way. I don't know what that means,\" he joked.\n\nDavid was filming Marvel movie Black Widow when he met Lily. The film was later released in 2021.\n\nRomance rumours\n\nThe actor and singer-songwriter were first romantically linked in January 2019, when they attended the BAFTA Tea party.\n\nDavid and Lily were later spotted together in London in August of the same year, as he filmed Black Widow.\n\nLater, the pair were spotted at Saturday Night Live's afterparty in October, which celebrated David fronting the acclaimed comedy programme.\n\nIn the same month, the pair appeared to confirmed their romance as Lily shared photos from David's SNL appearance.\n\nAs Lily posted photos of the actor flexing his biceps in a sketch to parody a spin class, she captioned the snaps as: \"Mine\".

Especially now Marnie's getting so big,\" she said. \"It's like, 'No, my babies!'\"\n\nBut, Lily revealed she's in no rush to get pregnant anytime soon as she said: \"I'm in a really good place. I don't know if I'd mess with my hormones, at this particular point.\"\n\nMarried life\n\nSince tying the knot in a Las Vegas ceremony two years ago, the couple continue to enjoy married life together.\n\nDavid gushed about his wife to People in December 2020 as he said: \"I married a beautiful, incredible woman who I love.\n\n\"I have never met someone who is so deeply kind as her. I've never felt so taken care of and cared for by another human being. She really is just a deeply kind individual and I love that about her.\"\n\nAnd, earlier this year, Lily and her two daughter supported David at the Stranger Things season four premiere as the family were pictured together on the red carpet."
