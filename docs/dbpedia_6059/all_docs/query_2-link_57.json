        "text": "You’ve played detective on Instagram. You’ve patrolled the Reddit boards. You’ve sent up tiny prayers that their happily ever afters look more like Lauren and Cameron’s and less like… well, take your pick.\n\nBut the question remains: Which couples from Love Is BlindSeason 4 have continued to make it work? And for those who didn’t tie the knot or even make it to the altar, what does life and love look like since the pods closed?\n\nNow that we’ve seen each of their stories unfold (and unravel) after the finale and reunion, it’s time to check back in with the Season 4 pod squad. For some, married life has been positively blissful, and for others it’s been — to borrow a phrase — the (too) real thing. As for the newly minted singles, is there hope for reconciliation? Or is getting back together with exes better left to the Bennifers of the world?\n\nHear from each of the couples and singles below about what life looks like now, and catch up with everything that went down on Love Is Blind: After the Altar.\n\nThe couples\n\nKwame and Chelsea are working through marriage “growing pains.”\n\nMarried life for Kwame and Chelsea has “not been easy,” but the two are focused on “finding happiness in the little things.” Directly following the wedding ceremony, their first step as husband and wife was moving into a new apartment in Seattle once Kwame agreed to leave Portland.\n\nAs they’ve blended friends, families and lifestyles, both agree that there’s been “a lot of growth and lots of growing pains” so far. “This is a marriage. We are real people,” Chelsea tells Tudum. “We have jobs, we have stressors and the speed of this process is intense.”\n\nThe couple’s taking a relatively slower pace when it comes to building a relationship with Kwame’s mother, who didn’t initially approve of their marriage. Since the experiment ended, Kwame and his mother are “getting to a better place every day” and have taken taken major steps, including a first visit with Chelsea. “My mom first had to be OK with me making this decision before she would think, ‘OK, now let me accept this whole new person into my family,’ ” he says. Chelsea, meanwhile, has learned to “have a lot of grace for [Kwame’s mother] and for her journey,” given how their nontraditional love story is “unknown to that generation.” The good news? Chelsea’s become “best friends” with Kwame’s sister, who she says has been a “gift to our family” and a “buffer to this experience with his mom.”\n\nLooking ahead, Chelsea and Kwame feel hopeful about “putting together all of these pieces” into the “massive puzzle” that is their future. “This has been transformative,” Chelsea says. “We’ve both grown so much and we’re really, really proud of where we are now and the foundation that we’ve built.”\n\nOne year into marriage, the couple is better at appreciating the highs and the challenges of a once-in-a-lifetime connection. “I got into marriage possibly slightly naively. I was so optimistic,” Chelsea says in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. “I don’t say it’s necessarily harder, but it’s deeper and it’s more moving to me.” The pair have continued to stick by each other through thick and thin — and with the help of close friends Zack and Bliss, who live less than 10 minutes away.\n\nThey’ve made significant progress in better integrating their families, but their other main hurdle — Kwame’s move from Portland to Seattle — is still proving to be an adjustment. As Chelsea’s job and schedule have kept the couple mostly at home, Kwame has had to sacrifice his love of travel and adventure for the time being. “It makes me sad that we haven’t gotten to that yet, but I know our time is coming,” Chelsea says. Kwame more than agrees, adding, “I’m excited and ready to start experiencing more with Chelsea.”\n\nLife has only gotten easier since then, after Chelsea changed jobs and granted the couple some long-awaited flexibility. As for that job, Chelsea now helps cast Love Is Blind, which she can do from just about anywhere. “I get to talk to brave, bold, courageous singles all over the United States that may make the leap that we all did,” she says at the Season 6 reunion. As for Kwame, he shares that Chelsea has “bonded really closely” with his nieces and nephews during their trips to the east coast. “We’re doing great,” Chelsea adds. “We are so proud and happy after almost 2 years of marriage.”\n\nTiffany and Brett’s love has only grown “deeper and deeper.”\n\nTiffany and Brett’s happily ever after began with her moving into his Portland apartment, which she notes now has room for both of their shoe collections. While married life is not without its hiccups, both agree that their “relationship has only gotten stronger” since we last saw them at the altar.\n\n“I love that my love for him has just grown deeper and deeper,” Tiffany tells Tudum. “I wake up every morning and I’m just so thankful. Like, oh my gosh, I’m still pinching myself that I found him on a TV show.”\n\nBrett, for one, has been “surprised at just how well our lives have continued to just join,” as Tiffany’s tried to establish her own friends, while building relationships with his “core group.” When they’re not traveling around the country or visiting Brett’s family in North Carolina, life for these newlyweds is “very normal” with a once-a-week date night minimum. Communication around any issues that do arise is key, as the couple has found a “way of resolving them” by “making sure that we’re working to be better people for each other.”\n\n“Ultimately, we’ve been doing as great as we could’ve ever hoped to have been doing at this point in time,” says Brett. “I’m happy. I’m very happy.\"\n\nIf the two were to fast-forward a few years, Brett has his eye on “homeownership” before starting a family one day. “We both really want to enjoy this time together and not introduce kids into it too early,” he says. “So that’s in the future at some point.”\n\nAfter leaving her hometown of Seattle behind, Tiffany is still getting used to a “slower paced” life in Portland, where Brett currently works. He, for one, couldn’t be more grateful for Tiffany’s sacrifice, which has made him fall even more deeply in love with her. She feels the same, especially when Brett busts out his pitch-perfect impressions of their fellow pod squad members. In the year since they tied the knot, the couple has invested in “just us” time, which included a spontaneous trip to Cartagena, Colombia planned by Tiffany after an idyllic honeymoon getaway in Mexico. But no matter where they are, all the Browns need is each other. “The best part about married life is just having somebody that understands me,” Tiffany says in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. “I know that he’s not going to judge me. Even when I’m questioning or doubting myself, he’s that reassurance for me.”\n\nSince then, the couple’s bond has only gotten stronger with Tiffany sharing at the Season 6 reunion that Brett is “doing great” as a husband. She also reveals that they have plans to jet off to Japan in the coming months, as well as to lay down roots in Portland. “We’re actually looking for homes right now,” she says. “It’ll be our first home, so I’m excited to get that started.”\n\nBliss and Zack are new parents to a baby girl.\n\nIn the words of the incomparable Lee Ann Womack, Zack and Bliss haven’t lost that sense of wonder for each other. After tying the knot following Zack’s short-lived engagement to Irina, he and Bliss have settled into life as husband and wife. In fact, Zack says that he’s “so much more in love with Bliss than I ever was when we got married.”\n\nFor Bliss, their unprecedented, bumpy courtship unfolded exactly how it was supposed to. “He’s such a good man,” she tells Tudum. “He tried to follow through on his word and even though it was a mistake, he was going to try to go at it with respect and care.”\n\nAfter splitting time between each other’s places, they’re now living in Zack’s apartment in Seattle with plans of finding a bigger home together in the future. While Zack says he’s never lived with anyone before, Bliss says cohabitating has been remarkably “easy,” especially given his habit of cooking for her every night. And they’ve got the support of new couple friends like Kwame and Chelsea, whom they hang out with frequently.\n\nBlending their lives hit a major roadblock, however, when it came to Bliss’ furry friends. Due to Zack’s severe allergies, she made the difficult choice to re-home her goldendoodle puppy and Siberian cat with her family. “The fact she was willing to make that sacrifice for me just tells you everything you need to know about her heart,” Zack says. “She was willing to give that up so we could be together.” But, fear not, this story has a happy ending! With the help of medication and monthly allergy shots to build up his immunity, Zack surprised Bliss by bringing her puppy home again. “I was just sobbing,” she says. “It was really just so sweet and touching.”\n\nLooking ahead, both are on the same page when it comes to their next steps, which include planning their much-delayed European honeymoon, buying a home together and starting a family one day.\n\n“It’s kind of a cool feeling being the Goytowskis,” Zack says in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. “That’s my favorite part. I’m not alone anymore. My story is us.” In the chapter they’ve written together since the reunion, Zack and Bliss are happier than ever — especially now that their “fur babies” are finally back home after an extended vacation. Music is still very much a part of their lives, as Zack will unleash his talents for a few “one-to-two hour serenade sessions” from time to time. And, hey, there’s much to sing about after celebrating their one-year anniversary together. After traveling around North America, Zack and Bliss finally embarked on their long-awaited honeymoon. And, better yet? The trip was fully parent-sponsored: “My dad was like, ‘If you guys make it a year, I’ll get y’all a honeymoon,’ ” Bliss said.\n\nIn April 2024, the couple welcomed their first child together, a baby girl named Galileo Terri Rayne. \"We are so in love with our precious, beautiful baby girl,\" they told People at the time. \"We are forever changed and are so blessed to spend the rest of our lives loving her. She is our moon, our stars, the center of our universe.\"\n\nThe pair initially shared the happy news that they were expecting a baby girl at the Season 6 reunion. They’ve had the support of the pod squad ever step of their journey into parenthood, as Kwame, Chelsea, Tiffany, Brett, and Marshall among others were all in attendance at the baby shower.\n\nJackie is ready to “go to the courthouse” and marry Josh.\n\nFollowing a tumultuous breakup with ex-fiancé Marshall, Jackie pursued a relationship with Josh, another strong connection from the pods. “I’m definitely his twin in a girl version,” she tells Tudum. “We get along so well.”\n\nSo well, in fact, that the two moved in together “probably after three, four days of meeting,” which she acknowledges is really quick. Unlike her time with Marshall, however, Jackie says that living together is going smoothly because she and Josh barely fight. Instead, the two enjoy being “couch potatoes” together. And when they do leave, family time is a priority, as Josh hangs out with her brother all the time. “My people are his people,” she adds.\n\nWhile their path might not have been the most conventional, Jackie couldn’t be happier with her decision. “I can’t even believe that I found Josh on this platform,” she says. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing to find somebody on a show, let alone continue to be with them.”\n\nAs for their future together, Jackie shares that she “got off birth control.” “If the good Lord wants it, then it’ll happen,” she says about the possibility of having a baby. But there’s no question about whether they plan to tie the knot one day since Jackie says marriage is “definitely” on their minds. “If he were to sit here and be like, ‘Let’s go to the courthouse and get married,’ then I’m with it. Let’s go,” she says. “I don’t need a piece of paper to sit here and tell me that that’s my man, because that’s my man regardless.”\n\nIn the self-described “hard year” since we last saw them, Jackie and Josh have continued to boss up together despite some challenges. While “getting reamed” on the internet after her split with Marshall was difficult, Jackie completely stands by her decision to this day. “I didn’t expect to come in here and fall in love with someone completely different than who I chose,” she says in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. The couple has moved into their first joint apartment together — and that’s a big enough step for now, as they’ve decided to take it slow on the marriage front. “We’re in love and we don’t need a ring or necessarily a wedding to prove that,” says Josh.\n\nWith some time and space, Jackie and Marshall finally reunite at Chelsea’s birthday party, and both take accountability for how their actions led to the downfall of their relationship. “I never wanted to hurt you,” she tells him. “You deserve everything and more.” But just when the mess seems fully behind them, Josh’s ex-fiancée and Jackie’s pod bestie Monica enter the chat, leading to a dramatic confrontation.\n\nThe singles\n\nMicah is searching for someone who’s “sure” about her.\n\nMicah and Paul’s love story comes to an end after he turns her down at the altar. Looking back on that time, Micah tells Tudum that she was “really going through it” when the cameras stopped filming. “After that moment at the altar, I was like, ‘I need to get out of here.’ So I spent a few days holed up in a hotel room in Seattle.”\n\nShortly after, Micah headed back to her home in Scottsdale, Arizona (she splits her time between both cities), to process with her friends and family. As for a potential rekindling down the road, Micah admits she “can’t say never” when it comes to Paul — especially since they revealed during the reunion that they briefly dated after their breakup — but she is more focused on her own self-growth at the moment. “There’s a lot that happened, and it’s not easy to just move on after something like that and just [go back to] business as normal,” she says.\n\nNow, she’s back in Seattle palling around with the rest of the pod squad. Should her Prince Charming come knocking one day, Micah’s clear that it should be someone who’s “undoubtedly sure about me” — unlike a certain curly-haired scientist. “I want to feel that in every moment of the day, because I feel like I give a really reassuring commitment to people and I just want that back,” she says. Ultimately, Micah’s “not trying to find someone desperately,” but keeping her options open. “I just want to continue to grow and work on myself. If someone comes along, then it’s perfect.”\n\nOne year later, Micah is still sorting through her feelings for Paul — with some help from his mom, Elizabeth, who lets her know that her son is dating someone new. “We’re both kind of healing,” Micah says in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. “It’s hard when you’re angry with someone, but they’re also the only person you want to talk to.” Ultimately, the exes amicably put an end to their relationship, as Micah decides to “protect [her] own heart” and stop communicating with Paul… for now.\n\nMicah’s search for love will continues on Perfect Match Season 2. While she finds a connection in the villa with Dated and Related alum Kaz, the two ultimately went their separate ways after filming. “Our relationship stayed in Mexico where it was meant to live … and die,” she tells Tudum in the official Season 2 status update. “I definitely don’t regret spending my time with him. There was a lot of drama and turmoil, but also a lot really great and fun moments that I’m really happy I experienced. He’s just not the person for me.” While her romantic future is still uncertain, Micah walked away from the experience with a special friendship with Love Is Blind Season 6 alum Jess, who she says is one of the biggest rocks she’s ever had in her entire life.\n\nPaul is “mostly” in his single era.\n\nJust like Micah, Paul isn’t officially closing the door on the relationship after their wedding day ended in tears. While the two have gone their separate ways, and even dated a bit after officially breaking up at the altar, life is “more complicated” now that they share a history that’ll always pull them together.\n\n“[I’m] trying to figure out to what degree, to what capacity do we have to be in each other’s lives,” he tells Tudum. “So it’s an ongoing thing.” But whatever the future holds, Paul is still looking for his perfect match, confirming that he’s “mostly” in his single era.\n\nIn Love Is Blind: After the Altar, Paul is caught between his feelings for Micah and a budding relationship with a new woman in his life. “She’s super supportive of all my hobbies,” Paul says about his new girlfriend. “Micah tolerated my cooking... This girl just loves it.” While he’ll always have a special place in his heart for Micah, Paul says goodbye to his ex for the time being, allowing each to finally get closure on their broken engagement. Since then, Paul has hard launched a new relationship on Instagram with girlfriend Geneva Dunham, sharing photos of the couple traveling around the world together.\n\nMarshall is “seeing someone” new.\n\nCall off your thirsty DMs, because Marshall has found love. The formerly heartbroken marketing manager is “doing great” after splitting with Jackie before their wedding day. As for details about his special someone, Marshall tells Tudum that they’ve been together for “some time now.”\n\n“I’ve just taken everything from [the experience on Love Is Blind] and applied it to my life and I’m thriving, growing every day,” he says.\n\nThe new woman in Marshall’s life is someone who he says is “healed, or in the process of healing” and willing to “put in the work” when it comes to their well-being. After his relationship with Jackie, Marshall says he gravitates toward people “who appreciate open dialogue, communication and vulnerability.”\n\n“That’s just one of the things that I learned,” he says. “Some things that are nonnegotiable and things that I absolutely need to have a thriving and happy relationship.”\n\nDuring the Love Is Blind reunion, Marshall revealed that he pursed a connection with Kacia after his relationship with Jackie ended. The two explored their feelings in the real world, but ultimately chose to go their separate ways after \"one singular date.\" Marshall explained that he wanted to \"distance\" himself from the experience after having his heart broken by Jackie, but calls Kacia a \"very caring and loving\" person.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes for Marshall, who’s finally moving on after putting the drama with Jackie in the rearview. Now, he’s fully invested in his relationship with girlfriend Chay, who he’s been dating for nearly a year now. During a double date with Tiffany and Brett, Marshall says that Chay, a doctor, makes him “feel secure in who I am as a man and she accepts me for me.” While the two aren’t engaged just yet, Marshall says he hopes to spend the rest of their lives together. “Chay is literally the perfect woman for me. She’s the yin to my yang,” he says in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. “She’s quite literally my opposite and we mesh so well. That’s what I love the most about her.”\n\nIrina says she wants to “learn from my mistakes.”\n\nThe last time we saw Irina, she’d broken off her engagement with Zack, expressed an attraction to Paul and got a talking-to from her crush’s then-fiancée, Micah. Despite all that and more, however, her Love Is Blind journey hasn’t shaken her spirit. As Irina tells Tudum, she’s been “thriving” and focusing on running her business since the show ended.\n\nShould her next relationship come along (she says she’s only “dated around a little bit” in recent months), Irina’s all about listening to her intuition and not “looking past red flags” when they pop up. “Being with someone that I didn’t work out with, it made me really want to be with someone that it does work out with,” she says. “I feel really open to anything. The DMs are open!”\n\nReflecting on her romance with Zack, Irina says she ultimately didn’t “feel safe or comfortable” with him. The pair’s “really good connection” in the pods almost immediately dissipated once they laid eyes on each other. Despite her gut instinct that something wasn’t right, Irina chose to keep moving forward — and that’s the behavior she’s trying to change in her next relationship.\n\n“It makes me want to be selfish, in a good way, of choosing myself,” she says. “If I feel something that I don’t want for my future, I want to just be able to cut it off.”\n\nBut all good things come in time, and Irina know she needs to “put in a lot of work” to find the guy of her dreams. “I just want to put my best foot forward,” she says. “After the whole entire show, I want to continue to be myself, be genuine and learn from my mistakes.”\n\nIrina is proudly still a work in progress, one year later. She’s staying single for the moment, choosing instead to focus the energy she might otherwise put toward relationship and channel it inward. “I wanna be the person that I’m looking for,” she tells Micah over drinks in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. “I feel like there’s so much transition and changing in my life, and I think I need to do this on my own and kind of get to healthy place of healing before I’m in a place to meet somebody.” Speaking of healing, Irina pulls Amber aside at Chelsea’s birthday party to apologize in person for her mean girl behavior in the pods. While they don’t entirely see eye to eye, the two decide to move on from the drama and “be better.”"
